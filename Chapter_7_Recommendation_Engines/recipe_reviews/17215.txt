I saw the comments about the loaf's tendancy to fall and would like to suggest adding about 1/2 tsp more salt into your machine when you bake the bread.  Salt regulates yeast activity and strengthens dough structure.  Too little salt can cause the dough to rise rapidly and then fall. I've seen that for 2 1/4 tsp (.25 oz) of bread machine yeast, the general salt amount is 1.5 tsp. I made this recipe with the extra salt and it turned out really well.  It is the best loaf of white bread I've gotten from my machine so far -- and it rose really high (it had me slightly concerned it might over rise).  But it was a beautiful loaf in the end.

This recipe flies in the face of conventional wisdom.  It says to place the yeast in the water for 10 minutes before adding the flour!  My bread machine instructions, "Electric Bread" cookbook, and even the bottle of yeast said to not allow the yeast to touch the liquid in advance.  They all recommend adding water first, then the flour mixture, and yeast on top of that.
     Well, what do I have to lose?  I tried this recipe the way it was written, and for the first time ever, I had a light fluffy loaf that rose to the top of my machine!
     Never has a loaf of bread made from scratch turned out this well.  Thank you!

This was the best bread that ever came out of my bread machine yet.  On my 2nd loaf, however, I made a few changes:  I used 3 Tablespoons sugar and reduced the yeast to 2 teaspoons instead of the 2 1/4 teaspoon measurement that is in the 1 packet that it calls for.  This reduced the rising just enough so that the slices near the top of the loaf weren't as "airy" thus, held up better during slicing.  Also, instead of using 3 cups of white flour, I substituted 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and  2 1/2 cups of white, and the result was a lovely, soft, very light white/wheat bread with a flaky crust, perfect for sandwiches!  This recipe has become a favorite!

Being new to bread making and having a new bread machine I have been looking for different recipes to try.
It scared me a bit mixing the yeast, sugar, and water together but it all turned out fine. The bread is just great! This is a wonderful white bread recipe that I will be making again and again.
My biggest confusion was that I had Bread Machine Yeast in a jar, not in a packet. After some searching I found that 2 1/4 teaspoons equals one packet of Bread Machine Yeast.

I have to say, I was practically terrified making this bread. It went against the manufacturer's instructions on how to add ingredients (which firmly said to add yeast last, on top of flour). I also only had regular yeast & flour. But... I got my breadmaker yesterday for Christmas and had to try it. It was delicious! It turned out light and fluffy, despite all of my blundering. It wasn't dense at all, like with my mom's bread machine recipe. It tasted just like my grandmother's hand-made recipe- except without all the work! Thanks for the great recipe. Oh, and my third loaf is baking as I type this! *G*

The basic recipe is good but has some issues:

1) "Bread Machine Yeast" is just another name (purely for marketing) for "Instant Dry Yeast" (IDY) which is INSTANT and therefore does not require pre-proofing in water. Simply add it to your dry ingredients and continue without the "dissolve and foam" step noted. There, you've save 10 minutes!

2) Active Dry Yeast is not Bread Machine/Instant Dry Yeast and it *does* like to be pre proofed as noted in the original recipe. 

Active Dry yeast is in little round beads about the size of a pin head. Instant yeast is very small and more like little threads of yeast, much smaller than Active. You would need about 25% more Active yeast than Instant. 

3) Salt:

Salt is normally 2% of a recipe's flour amount. Here we have 410g of flour (check the metric version) so we want 8 grams of salt, or about 1 1/2 teaspoon. The recipe as given is therefore missing 33% of the required salt which is more than just a "taste" problem.

Salt will not only improve the taste of your bread (this or any other) but is needed to help the gluten's strength by tightening the gluten strands a little. Bread with too little salt will not only taste bland, it will also be too soft. 

Try this experiment: 

Make this recipe with the correct 1-1/2 tsp (8 grams) of salt then again without salt and compare the two for taste and structure. You can use the saltless loaf for breadcrumbs or feed the birds afterwards.

I absolutely love this recipe.  Some modifications that I make:  I substitue the sugar with 2 very generous tablespoons of honey, add just a pinch extra salt and add 1 tablespoon of softened butter to the bread machine with the other ingredients.  I only make the dough in the bread machine, then I take it out and put it in my silicone bread pan, split the top length wise with a knife and stuff the bread with pieces of butter (1 tablespoon total) then I brush the top of the bread with melted butter and bake in a 375 degree preheated oven for about 30 minutes.  

I also put a pan with water on the bottom of the oven, i just think the bread comes out so much better that way.

My family loves this recipe, we use the bread for sandwiches, toast and just eat it plain!  yummy

This is an excellent starter recipe.  I make a few alterations though, as my family likes whole wheat...  Here's my exact recipe.  This makes a 2-lb loaf.

1-1/3 cups warm water (about 115°)
3.5 tsp bread machine yeast
1/4 cup sugar
1/3 cup oil
2 cups bread flour (essential to be bread flour!)
2 cups whole wheat flour
2 tbls gluten (or 1 tbls per cup of ww flour)
2 tsp salt
1/4 cup dry milk powder (makes the crust flaky)

Follow the directions in the original recipe. I like to bake mine inthe oven however.  I find that the dough cycle is actually too long on my machine if you use bread machine yeast (1.5 hours), because the end of it is a rise cycle, which I want done in my bread pan.  The reason for this is that bread machine yeast actually cuts out the need for a second rise.  So, after the final pulse cycle (you'll have to pay attention to your machine to see when this is -- mine is at 50 minutes into the dough cycle), take it out, shape it into your loaf and place it your pan to rise for 30 minutes.  Then, bake it at 350° for about 25 minutes.  Bread should be brown on top, not just golden.

Let the loaf cool completely before cutting!  I also like to smear the crust with butter to keep it soft, but if you like really crusty crust, then don't do that.

I've tried many recipes, and this is by far the best basic bread recipe I've found. It's perfect for sandwiches, french toast, or anything else you'd use store-bought bread for.

This is the best bread machine recipe I have ever tried!  It hits the window every time!  Thank you Karen.  I am using my bread machine every day now.  I made a few changes to the recipe.  I didn't have any bread machine flour or prepackaged yeast, so I use regular white flour and 2 teaspoons of quick rise yeast and it works great!

This recipe goes against the grain of any bread recipe I have ever seen or tried.  Scary!!! Scary!!!  Scary!!!  But trust the recipe and try it - this was the best bread ever.  Turned out so light, fluffy and just downright wonderful....  It turned out so well, that I threw out all the other bread recipes I had on file!  This is my new number one, go to recipe!!!  UPDATE:  Try carmelizing onions, dicing them, and adding them plus 1/2 tsp of onion powder to the top of the ingredient mixture and let your bread machine do the rest.

If you're new at working with yeast and bread machines like I am, try this recipe - it's wonderful!  And if you're avoiding it because it calls for packaged yeast and all you have is yeast in a jar (me again), check the jar - I found the equivilant measurement on the side.  Who knew it could be this easy?  :)

I was so glad to find this recipe since I can't have milk or eggs.  I have been using this recipe for months.  I average 6 loaves of bread a week.  We love it!  So far it is the best homemade bread we have found for sandwiches.  Our 9 year old will even asks for slices plain!  We no longer buy bread from the store.  I was happy to find that you can change a few things and this bread still turns out.  For instance, because of the 10 minutes the yeast sets in the warm water with the sugar, I tried using   regular yeast.  It works GREAT!  No more high-cost bread machine yeast!  To make it healthier, I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil - great again!  Sometimes I throw in a cup of oatmeal with 1 T. of gluten - again it is wonderful!  If you find the bread hitting the top of the machine and then collapsing (we had to switch to a bread machine that made 1 pound loaves for awhile and so had to  experiment), reduce your water 1-2 T. at a time until the problem is fixed.  I am going to try adding a sourdough sponge to it soon.  And, thanks to another reveiwer, I am going to try beer instead of water.

I made this in my machine and added 2.5 tbls of brown sugar, 2 tsp of cinnamon, 2 tbls of honey and 2/3 c. of raisins to the dispenser (no white sugar) and set my machine to "fruit & nut bread" setting, it turned out PERFECT. The best cinnamon raisin bread I've ever had, it was very moist and fluffy and everyone at work devoured it. I had used another recipe a few days ago for cinnamon raisin and it was horrible compared to this one.

After trying most of the recipes that came with my bread machine, I was starting to think that spending 100 dollars on the machine was a big mistake.  Then I decided to try this recipe, with the addition of an extra 1/2 tsp of salt.  I'm glad I did, the bread turned out perfect!  It is light and fluffy but has a nice crust.  I also really like that this recipe does not contain any milk.  Just a tip, this recipe makes a perfect 1.5 pound loaf (in case your machine has different size settings).  Thanks for the great recipe and for restoring my hope that I didn't waste my money on my bread machine.

This bread was so great, that I went out and bought another bread machine, I now have 2, so I can make 2 loaves at once.  The one thing I did change was to put it on the dough cycle, and when that is complete, I put it in a loaf pan and put it in the oven that has been preheated to 200 degrees and turned off.  I cover it with a tea towel and let it rise for 20 minutes..I then remove it from the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees and then bake the bread for 30 minutes...soooo delicious.  I have not bought store  bread since I discovered this recipe.

The previous reviewer must have done something horribly wrong. I live in Denver where baking bread is always a challenge because of the altitude. I've pretty much given up since almost every loaf I make either collapses or is extremely dense/chewy. I took another reviewers advice and added another half teaspoon of salt. I am not sure if that was the MAGIC solution but I got the most tender, flakey loaf of bread I've baked in the twenty years I've lived here! If other reviews criticize this bread it is NOT due to this recipe but rather baking technique. I got a PERFECT loaf of bread and I couldn't be happier. I'll be making this all the time, thank you, thank you, thank you.

My 4 year old said this is the best bread he's ever tasted and eats it plain. Took a couple of the suggestions: 2 TBSP honey instead of sugar and sub 1/2 cup wheat flour for 1/2 cup white.  I  make the dough in the breadmachine and when ready fold it under itself trying not to deflate it too much, put it in a slightly greased breadpan, top it with a damp towel, and place in a warm spot to rise again for ~30 minutes.  Baked in 375 degree oven for 30 minutes.  Took it out of breadpan and placed on rack when done to prevent softening.   Very easy.

I never used a BM recipe that went against my BM mfg. instructions but this is great. Simple tasty white bread. Will go in my BM recipe book as one of my best and easiest. As a treat we love fresh warm bread, only slightly cooled, out of the machine. It still has that yummy yeasty flavor. Heaven with butter! But I also HIGHLY recommend slicing what’s leftover of the loaf, when mostly cool, with an electric knife and a Bread Slicing Guide. The knives are under $20 and the Guide is under $10. The guide is a non-mechanical plastic loaf holder with slots to guide the knife in uniform slices. Various models are found where bread machines are sold. It is well worth the investment. Makes your bread machine lots more appealing and useful. The evenly pre-sliced bread is ready for toast or sandwiches and the whole loaf is always eaten with no waste. Also handy, plastic containers made especially to store bread machine loaves are sold or you can re-use empty commercial plastic bread bags with the twisty ties.

I read several of the lowest ratings and they all said that the bread either did not rise or rose too much and then fell.  Many of the disappointed bakers admitted that they added extra yeast.  Well, that's the problem.  Too much yeast.  In this case, more is definitely not better.  I fiddled around with my bread machine and found that the ideal amount of yeast for me is 5/8 of a teaspoon.  For any bread recipe, not just this one, if the bread rises and then falls, leaving a depression in the top, try reducing the yeast an eighth of a teaspoon at a time until you get a good loaf.  Trust me.  Or, trust your bread machine manual.  That's where I found the advice to reduce, not increase, the yeast.

Excellent!! This loaf turned out perfectly ~ no problems with sinking or anything! I had added about a Tbsp of italian seasoning and about a Tbsp of chopped sun-dried tomatoes and the bread had a very nice taste!! I will add more of each of these next time (probably about 2 Tbsp each)! Yummy! I look forward to experimenting with other ingredients too!
UPDATE: this is a staple recipe for me that I have made more than a dozen times...always turns out great and there are so many seasonings/ingredients you can experiment with. EXCELLENT recipe!

This is an awesome recipe. I use 3T sugar and 1 1/2 tsp. sea salt. I also use 1/4 cup real butter instead of oil. Turns out perfect every time after I learned the following: When measuring flour, don't dip the measuring cup into the bag. Take a spoon and dip the flour out and put in the measuring cup, then take a knife and scrape across the top to make an accurate measure. I put the measuring cup on a paper plate so I can save the flour that spills over. I haven't had any problems with the loaf falling. It comes out soft with a nice crust.

After my first very positive review I am coming back and say few more words. After months and months of baking this bread I continue to appreciate easiness and variability of this recipe. I use different flours, from specialized bread machine flours through whole wheat until the cheapest all purpose flour. And surprise - it is all working nicely. In this moment I have in machine mix of whole wheat and all purpose with olive oil and dried marjoram. And I know it will come out perfect. That is one from what I love about this recipe - reliability.

This is indeed the Best Bread Machine Bread.   I recently bought a bread machine and was using the recipes included with the instructions...they were pretty bad...bread hot out of the oven should taste good but these ones just had a weird almost moist cloth sort of texture.  They were only bearable when they were cooled or toasted.  Also they were very dense, didn't rise well (mini loaves) and could never be kept for more than a day because they got hard very quickly. I tried your recipe and was astonished with the difference.  The bread is amazing warm and equally good cooled or toasted. It is so soft and will keep for days it also rose to the top of my bread machine to make a full loaf.   This is how bread should be.  Thanks for this great recipe I will be using it again and again.

YUM!! Perfect white bread!  I use plain ol' yeast and plain ol' flour and prefer the taste over that made with the listed ingredients (it has the consistency of a major grocery chains famous french bread).  Super simple, totally foolproof!

So disheartened!  First time, the bread didn't rise - realized I didn't use 'bread maker' yeast. 2nd time, even with 'bread maker' yeast, it didn't rise.  Obviously, I'm the exception to the bullet and idiot proof comments but would greatly appreciate any suggestions as to what I may be doing wrong. Thank you!

After discovering this recipe, I asked my 13 year old son if he wanted to make it. This was his first time to make bread. He followed the directions without changing anything. The bread came out delicious. My 13 yr old and I had been reading the reviews about how light and fluffy it was and that it was better than store bought bread but we didn't say anything to the rest of the family. The bread was ready just in time for dinner and my husband started asking me how expensive it is to make bread and maybe I should consider making this instead of buying bread. I thought my 16 yr old son was going to explode before he stopped eating it . I would have to say the recipe is a keeper, anyone can make it. I think I may try different variations but this will definitely be my basic bread.
I can't wait to try a grilled cheese out of it. My son wants to make croutons...lol.

I had the settings on basic with a medium crust, it took 3 1/2 hours from the time he started the machine.

Great and simple recipe!  Some advice from a long-time bread baker:

1) Don't worry about mixing the yeast and water in the bread machine.  This is just fine!  This allows you're yeast to bloom and become active, and is the norm for traditional hand methods.  THE EXCEPTION is if you are using a delay cycle for your machine (i.e., throw it together in the morning, and have it start 4 hours later).

2) To keep the dough from falling apart, as a few had problems with, it's important to give the bread a 'peek' once or twice during the kneading cycle.  If it is crumbly or in pieces, just add a little water about 1 teaspoon at a time.  In general, a wetter load is better than a dry one.  The ideal dough is still slightly tacky, yet will stay together when kneaded.

This recipe is excellent because it is so easy and flavorful. The only changes I made were:  1. Use 2.5 unbleached white flour, .5 wholemeal.
2. Use 3 tablespoons of sugar
3. Add 3 tablespoons of gluten powder (found in WholeFoods and most grocery stores) for better texture. Gluten powder will create fluffier, softer and chewier texture. It's definitely worth it.

Tip: You can add in Splenda for additional sweetness. It will sweeten without affecting the texture of the bread. This bread is fine as is though, in terms of sweetness.

This bread was outstanding!!!  For those who had trouble slicing the bread, cut with an electric knife when the loaf has cooled. I also use a "bread slicing guide" for uniform slices. It's worth the investment.. believe me (SEE MY PHOTO).
Also for those who use jarred BREAD MACHINE yeast, the amount is 2 teaspoons for a 1 1/2 pound loaf and 
2 3/4 teaspoons for a 2 pound loaf. (Keep in mind the measurements differ for "active dry" yeast versus "bread machine yeast").Thanks for the GREAT recipe, using simple ingredients!!!

FYI on the yeast: A .25oz package is equal to 2 1/4 tsp not what has been said by other reviewers.
Nice bread though.

I replaced most of the oil with butter, so I'm not going to rate this.  But I have to say... this is probably my favorite bread that has ever come out of my bread machine!  Very versatile, and a nice texture, too.  I rubbed it with garlic butter and toasted it on the barbeque while I was grilling steak last night and it completed the meal.  This morning I made a few pieces into french toast - delicious!  Tonight we see how it stands up to clubhouse sandwiches!  Thanks for this recipe Karen, it's a keeper!

This recipe is wonderful! The first time I made it I did not follow the instructions, in terms of mixing the yeast with the water first. I did what my bread machine instruction booklet said: ALWAYS ADD THE YEAST AT THE END.  HOWEVER... When making this a second time I followed the exact instructions of the recipe and it turned out even better!  Definitely mix the yeast with the water prior to adding the other ingredients.  Thanks!

The first time making this recipe, I made some of the changes suggested in prior reviews.  I increased the salt to 1.5 tsp, cut the yeast back to 2 tsp and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  What a disaster!!!  I got a rock solid lump that not only looked terrible, it tasted horrible!  Figuring that the 400+ rave reviews for this recipe just couldn't be wrong, I went back and tried again.  I still increased the salt to 1.5 tsp and decreased the yeast to 2 tsp, but this time I used veggie oil as called for in the recipe and I cut back the bread flour from 3 cups to 2 3/4 cups.  DEEEEELISH!!!  I got a perfect loaf (for the first time ever!) out of my bread machine that not only tasted great but it looked perfect!  I had read a lot of the reviews that talked about the loaf over-rising and sometimes collapsing, so when it started to rise too much, I simply poked the top of the loaf a few times with a toothpick.  What I ended up with was a loaf that looks as perfect as store bought but tastes better!  

If I was forced to say anything negative about this recipe, I would have to say that the loaf may be too light to use for sandwiches.  I don't know though....we gobbled up the loaf warm out of the bread machine with lots of butter.  I'll test the sandwich theory when the loaf that's in my bread machine now is done!!!

This is the best!!  However I too tweaked it a bit.  I add 1 1/2 tsp. salt (as others suggested) and 2 TBS Agave nectar or Honey instead of the white sugar and also 1/3 cup olive oil (instead of 1/4 vegetable oil), I also add 2TBS of dry instant milk.  I use this for my basic recipe and change it up depending on what kind of bread I am making.   For wheat bread  I use 1 1/2 cup King Arthur Bread flour and 1 1/2 cup King Arthur Wheat Flour and add 4tsp. of Vital Wheat Gluten, and many times add either  2/3 cup sunflower seeds or flax seeds.   I  use the basic recipe to make french bread and just put it on the dough cycle, shape 2 French Bread loaves and let rise for about 45 min. before baking.  Makes great cinnamon raisin bread too...just add raisins and cinnamon!   LOVE THIS BREAD!!    Only recipe you ever need.

Just like my favorite bread at Papa Vino's Italian restaurant.  I made it using the dough cycle, then stretched long, thin (approx 1-1/2" diameter), it makes 2 loaves.  Put in a greased french bread pan and let rise before baking at 350 deg. After it was browned and hot, we dipped into seasoned olive oil with roasted garlic in the bottom of the dish. The bread needs to be torn gently, it's very soft and it compresses down to pick up all the good garlic in the plate.  Thanks for the recipe, it allowed me master a long sought out recipe!!!

What can you say, except WOW!  Just like everyone else I resurrected my bread machine after 10+ years of no use.  Its great as is or as a starter base. I've added seasonings to make pizza crusts, fried dough, biscuits, etc...  Just a great recipe all around. Trust me, ignore any negative input about it.  You'll love your machine and create lovely food!  Enjoy!

I am using a Sunbeam Model 5891 bought brand new and this was my first time ever using a bread machine. I've tried this recipe twice now and both times it collapsed while baking.  The second time I added a little more salt, which was recommended by someone who had the same problem. But it still fell. But I've finally perfected this recipe, at least in MY bread machine:  1 1/4 cup water (approx. 110 degrees) 2 Tbsp sugar 2 tsp bread machine yeast Mix together in bread pan(don't forget paddle)and let proof for approx. 10 minutes.  Add: 4 cups bread flour 1/4 cup oil (I use olive oil) 1 1/2 tsp salt 1 Tbsp dry milk 1 or 2 Tbsp butter (optional)  Even though it's 4 cups of flour, I set my machine for light color and 1.5 lb loaf. It turns out perfect and delicious every single time. And it doesn't collapse!

I got a bread machine yesterday and this was the very first bread I've ever made.  I don't know what Bread Machine Yeast is (I didn't see anything called that in my grocery store) so I used active dry yeast, but other than that I followed everything to the T. It was so easy and came out delicious. We couldn't wait to dig into it! The bread was a very light with a crisp crust on the reg. crust cycle. I was very impressed and now know that I will get tons of use out of my bread machine. I hope all my bread recipes are as tasty and easy as this one. Definitely worth trying!

I'd felt uneasy about going against the manufacturer's instructions, when it came to mixing the yeast with water/sugar and letting it foam for ten minutes. My bread machine has an initial preheat cycle and I was worried that this prolonged waiting period might further jeopardize the effectiveness of the yeast. However, based on the 1400+ positive reviews, I felt like I had to give this recipe a try. I'm so glad I did! The bread turned out wonderful, soft and fluffy with a crunchy crust. My family loved it. I used 1/2 tsp. more salt, as previous reviewers suggested and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  My bread maker has a 2 lbs max capacity and this recipe filled the bread pan, completely. There is no comparison between the dense white bread recipe that came with my bread maker and this one. This is the ultimate winner!

Sooooo yummy!  I followed the recipe very closely except I used traditional active dry yeast instead of instant/bread machine yeast---made no difference.  Will definitely make this bread again!

Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!  I've had my Zojirushi bread machine for 3 years and stopped using it after the first 6 months because we absolutely hated every recipe in the manuel.  Every loaf turned out brick hard for the first half inch or so all the way around the loaf.  The loaves were also very packy and not light and fluffy like my mom's Wilbilt machine.  I spent $200 on this machine that was supposed to be amazing, so you can imagine my disappointment.
Well, I recently pulled it out of the closet and decided to try a recipe that wasn't in the owner's manuel.  I couldn't believe it when you said to add the yeast directly to the water (forbidden in the manuel).  Wow! Who would have EVER thought that my machine that previously had only produced bricks could produce such a soft, fluffy and oh so tasty loaf of bread!!!  THANK YOU SO MUCH for saving my machine from being sold on e-bay! I am still shocked that all I had to do was find a different recipe.  (I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and apparently it didn't hurt anything because it was delicious!)

WOW!  I tried a million variations on the recipe that came with my bread maker, but it would always collapse and come out too dense.  This came out perfect the first time!  Don't be scared of mixing the yeast with water first.  The crust is just the right amount of flaky and the bread is very soft.  The first one I made I accidentally used too much yeast (thanks to the person who posted the correct amount of jarred yeast) and the bread came out delicious, but too soft for sandwiches -- great for just ripping apart and eating, though!  The right amount of yeast and substituting in some wheat flour made it firm enough for sandwiches too.  I wish I could give it six stars, thanks Karen!!

The perfect loaf of bread.  We like to use the dough setting on the bread maker, then shape into a loaf, let it rise for about half an hour, and pop into the oven at 375 for 30 mins.

Really yummy! I wanted an aromatic bread so I altered the recipe slightly by throwing in some herbs (rosemary, sage and oregano), I also added in some garlic- my house smells amazing! I did as others advised and increased the salt amount, (doubled, really)no sunken loaf for me! I will be making this again and again!

Awesome base recipe! I made a few changes based on others comments. I changed the sugar to 2 heaping TBSP of Honey, used a package of regular yeast, changed the vegetable oil to olive oil, used 2 1/2 cups of bread flour and 1/2 cup wheat flour and a rounded tsp of salt. I made the dough in my bread machine and then put in a bread pan and allowed it to rise an additional 30-40 mins. split the top and and brushed with melted butter. Baked at 350 degrees for 30-40 mins till golden brown. (Tip: place dish of boiling water in bottom of oven. makes for great crust)   soo good! thanks! Recipes do not get a hand written card in my recipe box unless they are keepers and this one is already in there!

I used my bread machine for the first time and baked my first bread. I was so easy and  tasty. I accidently used the wrong bake setting but it still turn out good. Maybe it would taste even better if use the right setting. Used melted butter instead of oil. 
(Update) Tried it using multi-purpose flour. It tasted even better with a softer texture.

I read all the reviews and thought I would try a new recipe instead of the one I normally use.  This bread did NOT come out tasting good.  It tasted very bland and the crust was way too thick. I thought I may have did it wrong so I tried again and followed the instructions to the t, but again icky.  I will not make this again.

This is the quickest and easiest bread machine recipe ever.  Makes a perfect loaf. I replaced a cup of bread flour with whole wheat flour and that came out great, too.  I recommend using the light crust setting on your machine with this recipe.  If you're cost conscious you'll like knowing that this recipe costs about .55 cents per loaf to make,  .60 cents for wheat...much better than even thrift store prices!

My girlfriend and I were browsing through a Goodwill store and I happened on a Sunbeam Bread Maker, that looked brand new.  For $10 I figured I couldn't go wrong.  My girlfriend, on the other hand, thought I was crazy.  Being from the Philippines she thought making bread was a long, arduous process.  When we got home I told her to watch and learn.  I found this recipe, read a couple of reviews, made a couple of changes and put it all together.  She was just sitting at the table watching, probably wondering when the "real" work would start.  After putting everything in the pan and dropping it into the breadmaker, I pressed a couple of buttons and turned and walked out of the kitchen saying, "that's it."  "Huh?  Don't you have to mix the dough?"  "No, the machine will do that."  "How about getting the dough to rise properly."  "Uh, machine will do that."  "Well, what do you have to do?"  "Actually, I'm pretty much finished.  The only thing to do now is wait about three hours, come back and pull the pan out and drop the bread out of it.  Wait about ten to fifteen minutes and then cut it up and enjoy it with you."  She didn't believe me.  Three hours later she was right there by my side as I pulled the pan out of the machine and popped the bread out of the pan onto a paper towel.  "Ooooooo.  That looks good and it smells great."  A few minutes later we each had a thick slice of bread with some Country Crock and she was completely converted.  The changes I made were pretty much wh

This recipe makes excellent hamburger buns. I expanded it by 1/3 (changed to servings to 16) and loaded into my Zojirushi machine letting the yeast cure first as recommended in the original. I put the Zo on the dough cycle and pulled the dough out at the end of 2nd rising, shaped the dough into ten flat buns and let them rise another 45 minutes. Baked in regular oven for 20 minutes at 400 degrees. Outstanding result.

I didn't feel like taking out my bread machine so I just made it with my kitchen aid mixer and it turned out wonderful!  It was flavorful, soft and my kids DEVOURED it.  If you're wondering how to do it without the bread machine: Proof your yeast with the sugar in the bowl until foamy/creamy (about 10 minute). Add the rest of the ingredients on low, then mix on high for a few minutes. Place in a well-oiled bowl covered with a damp cloth in a nice warm place (like your oven with the light turned on) and let it rise for about an hour or until doubled in size.  Punch down put in well oiled bread pan and let it rise again for about half an hour or until it rises above your bread pan. Bake at 350 for about 20 minutes.   On a side note I doubled the recipe,  ended up using less flour than called for and added 1 and 1/2 tsp of salt for every package of yeast.

I got a bread machine 6 yrs ago for my wedding, made a few loaves using the manufacturers instructions, and they were so dense, that it sat for all this time on the shelf.  I saw this recipe and thought I'd try it.  I was also scared as it is totally against what the manufacturer recommends.  Boy am I glad I tried this...the bread is PERFECT...crusty on outside and soft on inside, still fairly easy to cut with a bread knife.  Followed recipe to the letter except for I only used 2 tsp of yeast instead of 2 1/4, glad I did as it rose right to the window.  It made a tall loaf (I have a horizontal breadmaker) but that was fine as we all fought over this bread and it was gone within 1/2 an hour!  Will be using this again, and not buying expensive store bought with who knows what chemicals, and not very fresh.  Thanks for this AWESOME recipe!

I held my breath when I took the dough out because the directions are completely different from the manufacturer's.  I used the dough only cycle, rapid rise yeast, and canola oil.  Bread turned out perfect!  When I lifted the dough out of the bread pan, I knew it was a winner by the way it felt.  Baked it in a buttered 9" aluminum loaf pan for 30 mins. at 375.  Brushed the top generously with melted butter before baking it which prevented the flakes.  Did tent it with foil after 20 mins.s to prevent overbrowning.  I was absolutely thrilled with the results!  The recipe that came with my machine is no match for this recipe!!!!!  Will NOT make it again.  WILL make this recipe over and over.

This truly is the BEST bread macine loaf ever. It is made weekly in our home as I dont buy storebought bread. It slices oh so nicely, and is moist until we eat the very last piece. I did use others' suggestions of 3 Tbsp sugar, and use 1 1/2 tsp salt, sometimes I even add a Tbsp of butter extract, but every way we fix it, it is excellent. Thanks for a great recipe!!**i just today added an egg and reduced the water by 3 Tbsp. This bread is now over the top of perfection, and soft for days.

We took our bread machine with us on a cross country trip & made this recipe for folks we visited along the way.  I've made this bread at least 25 times. It always comes out great. Only 2 modifications: 
1. I decreased the bread machine yeast from 1 1/2 to slightly over 1 tsp. bread machine yeast. (Less collapse on the top of the bread.) 
2. I used Canola Oil.
The recipe works great with my two machines: Sunbeam 5891 & Oster 9050
I also think the Ingredients list should go:
Water,Oil,Flour,Sugar,Salt,Yeast. That's the order  the bread machine instructions give.  
Try the bread, you won't be sorry. Thanks for the original post! (Houston guy "Coopdude" whose bread collapsed, try this recipe, we have the same machine, so it should work for you. Too much yeast is usually the cause.)

This is the easiest and best bread I've ever made!  I don't care for how my machine bakes the bread, so I opt to use just the dough setting, allow it to rise a 2nd time and then bake my own loaf or rolls in the oven.  I also substitute beer for the water, for a very subtle yeastier beer flavor to the bread, which is heavenly with honey butter.  Also try mixing whole garlic cloves into the bread for a really delicious garlic bread.

This bread tastes WAY BETTER than the recipe that came with my bread machine! It's very soft, and I only rate it a 4 because I wanted it a bit softer/flakier crust.

I stopped looking at the photos when I got to 5thsister's BLT on toast and made a run for my bread machine.  No disappointment here.  Invited neighbor to share lunch with this homemade bread and homemade veggie/beef soup.  Pure Heaven. She took the few slices of leftover bread and bread recipe home with her!  Will definitely and happily do this again!  Thank you!!

This bread turned out so fresh, soft, and delicious!  I have made it twice and the second loaf was better than the first.  I think the first loaf -I didn't let the yeast foam enough and maybe my water was too hot.  Last night, I made it again and the foam was good and thick and I made sure the thermometer was right on when I let my yeast dissolve.  It rose to the window! I sliced off a piece for the kiddos and they asked me why all the other breads I have been making weren't this soft?  I guess this is THE bread from now on!

Things I changed from the first loaf: added a dash more salt and used honey instead of sugar and olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  

LOVE THIS BREAD!!

This is the absolute best bread for a bread machine.  It is so light and fluffy with a good taste.
What I don't understand is how people change a recipe without trying the original first...then they give it a bad review.  At least try the recipe as written before slamming it.
Trust me...if made the way it is written you'll love this bread!!!

Wow, great loaf of bread.  Like other reviewers, I increased the salt to 1-1/2 tsp.  I also buy bread machine yeast in the jar, so one packet is equivalent to 2-1/4 tsp. yeast.  I used the dough cycle on my bread machine and then put the dough in an oiled bread pan, let it rise for 30 minutes, then baked for 30 minutes at 350°.  It makes a soft, dense loaf, and the taste is excellent.

Use the dough cycle then shape into loaves, let rise 1 hr., and bake at 350 for 35 minutes. Great white bread.

I used the dough setting on my machine and then used half of the dough for cinnamon rolls and the other half for dinner rolls.  The cinnamon rolls were wonderful!  I kneaded the dough a few times, then rolled it out.  Then spread margerine on it, sprinkle cinnamon, white sugar, and chopped nuts.  Roll it up jelly roll stlye, cut it into 4 inch slices. Put it on end in round cooking container (I use a pie plate).  I then put it in the fridge overnight and put them out first thing in the morning to rise.  After they have risen I bake them at 350 until brown.  Then ice with simple powdered sugar icing.  They were wonderful for Christmas breakfast.  I then made the remainder dough into dinner rolls for Christmas dinner.  The rolls were OK, but not near as good as the cinnamon rolls.  This will be my recipe for cinnamon rolls, but I will keep looking for a dinner roll recipe.

Great bread recipe! I also use it for breadsticks by decreasing the sugar by 1 Tbsp and using the dough cycle. You can add garlic and parmesan if you like. When dough is ready just roll out and slice into breadsticks and let rise and bake 375 for about 12-15 min.Brushing with (garlic)butter when done :)

One word - WOW!!!  I was skeptical when I saw how few ingredients there were... and I felt like I needed to look over my shoulder at letting the yeast touch the water against my machine's instructions... but followed the recipe to the letter.  Phenominal.  Had three slices (with butter - yum) before it had been done 15 minutes!  Fabulous recipe!

This really does come out great! I followed other suggestions and subbed 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour for 1/2 cup of bread flour and used 1 1/2 tsp salt. I was surprised at how much it rose. Will be making this many more times. Thanks SHECOOKS2.

Absolutely fabulous! Terrific flavour and so easy to substitute and play with. I would never have thought about adding the yeast to the sugar and water as it goes against every bread machine recipe on the planet but it truly makes an enormous difference in loft...it filled up my full 2 lb machine at 1.5lb setting! Not to airy...just right for a basic bread. If you want it a tad denser for sandwiches and toast drop 1/4 tsp yeast and add a smidge more sugar....try it with 3 tablespoons of fancy molasses instead of the sugar for a taste variation:)

Great recipe! As others I adjusted the salt.  Also I incresed the recipe to make a 2 pound loaf.  I added 1/2 cup water, 1/4 t yeast, made the oil 1/3 c, 1 cup flour and 1 t salt.  The bread rose to the lid of my machine but all was well!  came out light and airy!

The bread "flopped" in the middle and partially uncooked.  The bread rose so high it got stuck on the top of the maker. The only thing I did differnent is that I used 2 tsp of yeast since I did not have a package....I "thought" the package contained 2 tsp!!! My maker has a "10 cup" capacity so maybe I need to find a "smaller" recipe.....

I tried making this bread.  I read all the comments about it over rising and being worried about over flow.  It didn't rise at all.  This has to be the worst yeast bread recipe I've seen.

Having just received my bread machine in the mail yesterday afternoon, was really wanting to try it out and used this recipe, exactly as written.  I used my candy themometer to make sure the water temperature was correct.  Set machine for 1.5 pound loaf and off she took.  Oh the smell as it was rising and than finally baking was like being a little girl again and being with grandma and mom as they made "fresh" homemade bread!!  What wonderful memories this bread brought back to me!!  Had to wait to slice this morning and sliced very nicely and evenly with a bread knife, no problems at all and taste just like what grandma use to make!  Thanks, Karen, for my first successful try with my new machine!!

I debated whether or not to give this bread 3 or 4 stars.  I ended up with 4 stars simply because unlike a lot of other bread machine recipes I have used, this one didn't have that heavy, thick crusted consistency that all the others did.  The crust was wonderfully crisp and flaky and the bread itself was light and fluffy.  BUT...the bread is almost tasteless...it tasted like something was missing.  I've been mulling it over and have even compared it to other recipes and I can't figure out what it is. (perhaps not enough salt??...maybe another 1/2 tsp will make a difference? Maybe EVOO instead of vegetable oil?)  Also, the bread rose very, VERY high...lifted the lid of my breadmaker.  Next time I may cut back on the yeast a little.  But I will make this bread again because even with its flaws, it's still a good bread machine recipe.

I made this for an office brunch, and it was the first item to go, over all the breakfast casseroles and pastries.  Everyone told me this really was the best bread they had tasted, not to mention the smell was heavenly while it was baking.  I paired it with the Cinnamon Honey Butter Spread also posted on this website, and the combination was a unbelievable.

Perfect every time.  I premeasure all the dry ingredients (with the exception of yeast) into ziploc bags and keep them stored away.  Just add oil and water, dump in the package and it's ready to go - love, love, love it.

This is my basic bread dough.  I've taken it out and flattened it to make italian flat bread, I've also added cinamon and raisins for a cinammon raison bread - perfect all around!

This recipe has me hooked!  Such a fluffy white loaf compared to the other dense loaf I have made!  
I did up the salt to 1.5tsp like reviews said and 1 packet of yeast equals 2.5tsp!  it makes a 1.5 lb loaf .
My new favorite recipe for cinnamon raisin loaf also!!  Same recipe mAke it the same way except when the kneading is done press pause (machine usually beats) take the loaf out roll it flat ( use a little bread flour to roll if needed) add the mix on top of the rolled put dough ( 4tbsp white sugar, 2.5 tbsp brown sugar, 2 tsp cinnamon, pinch nutmeg, 2/3 cup raisins)  roll loaf back into a cylinder and tuck sides under to keep the mixture inside.  Return to the pan and press start again!  Last 10 minutes of baking I brush the top with cinnamon sugar butter.  Will be the best gooey cinnamon raisin loaf you ever had!

Just as it says, flaky, soft and foolproof! I added an extra 1/2tsp of salt as others had said, and I also added 1/2tsp of garlic powder, basil, thyme, and oregano. Turned out perfect and my house smells amazing! Into the recipe box this ones goes. :)

i made a few alterations and have used some suggestions after reading some of the other reviews, and have come out with a perfect loaf!! i proof 2.25tsp TRADITIONAL yeast in the loaf pan with the water and sugar. i use 2 cups all purpose white flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat, and 1/8 cup gluten. i use 2 tsp salt and it turns out great!! (sometimes i have to add a bit more water, but i do that by eye.) this loaf rises evenly, and i don't even get the hard bottom, soft, airy top...it's airy all the way through!! highly recommended

Like this recipe needs another review :)  But, what can I say that hasnt been said before?  Delish!  I added the 1.5t of salt as recommended by others.  DH cant wait for the next loaf to come out of the machine; then he is already envisioning cinnamon-raisin and parmesan-garlic loaves in the near future.  Thanks so much!

This bread is absolutely delicious. I love that taste you get when you make a hearty loaf of bread or homemade rolls. My husband likes it also - but when it comes to sandwiches for his lunch or grilled cheese he likes the taste of regular store bought white bread. I've searched long and far and this is the first recipe I've found that gives us both. I like it warm because I know it's fresh home baked but it has such a light flavor it really truly reminds me of white bread you buy at the store. I haven't changed the recipe at all, although I might try to replace some of the white flour with whole wheat the next time I make it. This recipes is a staple at our house now and I love how simple it is. There are no special ingredients and no special prep. Thanks!

I usually make the white bread recipe that came with my bread machine, but it's so dense and very salty tasting.  I decided to give this recipe a try and it was soooo good!  It really was light and fluffy and I couldn't taste the salt.  I also was worried about going against my breadmaker's instructions, but it turned out perfect.  I'm excited to make it again, but next time I will just make up the dough in the machine and then bake it in the oven so it's a nicer size loaf.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

Thank you so much for this wonderful bread recipe. I have never ever tasted such great bread from my machine. I modified the recipe too (as advised by others) - 3 tablespoon white sugar, 6 tablespoons melted salted butter, 1.5 teaspoons salt and 1.5 teaspoons yeast.

I've been using my bread machine on a regular basis for 7 years and have made some wonderful breads using this website. This afternoon, after reading MANY reviews, I decided to make this particular recipe "Best Bread Machine Bread" and I rated this recipe with 3 stars. Why? Although the shape and texture were perfect, I felt that the flavor was lacking. Yes, it was a very soft bread and yes, it did slice thinly using an electric knife, but it wasn't the good old "stick to your ribs" type of homemade bread. It tasted bland, like the grocery store variety of white sandwich bread. We much prefer a hardier, chewier loaf of bread.

This recipe is fool proof! I have all these ingredients on hand, which is great when I want fresh bread and not have to run to the store for special ingredients. It rises everytime (make sure flour is room temp). LOVE IT! Yum!

I've made this recipe many times now. I first baked it exactly as listed. I found it to be a very soft loaf that rated very high with my son in comparison to several other white bread recipes I have used in the past.

Now that I've found the base recipe to be stable, I then started variations. So far all of my variations have turned out just as well. Some of the variations have been a substitution of 10 grain flour mix for the bread flour. Another was all purpose flour with 1 T of gluten per 1 cup of all purpose flour. The last variation I've made was the addition of 1/2 C of granola with pumpkin seeds. It's been just perfect each time. I've not attempted adding milk or eggs to this but I will in the future. I'm very very happy and this is part of my list of successful bread machine recipes.

This is definately the best bread I have ever had. I use the machine to make the dough and then I transfer it to a oan and cook it in my oven. I like to separate the dough in half, roll each half into a tube shape with my hands and then twist them around each other to look like a rope-bread. I have also added about a half-cuo sugar to make a sweeter variation and also topped it at times with melted butter and garlic to go with pasta dishes. Definately a keeper.

This is a great recipe. I didnt have bread flour so I used all purpose flour and the texture size and density were wonderful. I served it with cinnamon butter which is easy to make: 1 softened stick of butter, 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, and 1 tsp of honey stirred together to make a tasty spread. The bread lasted for 5 minutes at best!Everybody loved it. Thank you :-)

This was really easy to make, smelled heavenly
while baking, and tasted great even though I used all-purpose flour instead of bread flour.  The bread was easy to cut even while hot, and my
kids devoured half the loaf immediately.  This recipe's a keeper.

This bread is AWESOME.  Light, fluffy, and very tasty.  Not heavy and dense like so many other loaves I have made before.  Smells great while it bakes, and tastes DELICIOUS.

I AM ECSTATIC! I've been trying to make a really good bread with my new bread machine for weeks. I came across this recipe and decided to try it, using the dough cycle and finishing the bread in the oven.
WHEN THE DOUGH CYCLE WAS COMPLETED, I removed the dough from the bread machine;preheated the oven to 200 degrees (turning it off immediately after it reached 200 degrees); I cut the dough in half; shaped my loaves (I made two from this recipe); decided to just use a baking sheet (no bread pan); lined my baking sheet first with foil (I hate a mess) then placed greased parchment paper (I buy the sheets, and used only one) on top of the foil; placed my loaves on the baking sheet; covered the loaves with a  greased sheet of waxed paper, then a kitchen towel, and placed them in the warm oven to raise for about 30 minutes (till they doubled in size). I then took them out of the oven(keeping them covered till the oven was heated); heated the oven to 350 degrees and immediately placed the loaves on the center rack and baked for about 24 minutes - till the crust was nice and brown, then checking for a nice hollow sound when I knocked on the bottom of the loaf with my knuckles.
 They were beautiful and delicious. YAY!
You're my hero "SHECOOKS2." Mucho Gracias
PS: The only thing I changed, was to increase the salt to one and one half teaspoons. A professional baker, online, recommended that for a good loaf you need to use a half teaspoon of salt per cup of flour.

I followed BERMYROSE's alterations to this recipe, 3TB sugar, 1.5 tsp sea salt, 2.5C white flour, 1/2C whole wheat (dropped into the cup and leveled, not scooped out of the canister) and it came out PERFECT on a 3 hour light crust basic setting on my Oster 5858.  I've made it this way twice now and each one was identical.

The trick to this is to make sure your measurements are EXACT.  Too much water, or too much yeast, or not enough salt will cause it to fall, and that is precisely why I came looking for a new white bread recipe in the first place, which landed me here.    

If you follow this recipe with exact measurements, you will not go wrong, it will come out great every time.

I used Kirkland Sea Salt, and olive oil, store brand active dry yeast, store brand all purpose flour, and King Arthur Whole Wheat flour, started the yeast for 10 minutes before adding the oil and dry ingredients.  With both loaves, I checked on it during each knead cycle and added a TB or so flour at each knead, and each came out perfect. 

This is a great sandwich bread, soft and fluffy, but knife sturdy on the inside, and just right on the crust for cutting without falling apart.  PERFECT RECIPE!!!

This recipe has 6 ingredients.  Consider that next time you are in the bread isle, deciding on a store bought bread, and look at the ingredient list.

I scaled this down to a 1 lb loaf and I should have made the full 1 1/2 lb because my husband and son inhaled it.  I did the proofing of the yeast, which I had never done before but followed other reviewer's suggestions and went ahead and gave it a try.  My husband said it was one of the best loaves I've made...nice crust and soft on the inside.

I downloaded this recipe two weeks ago. I did reduce the yeast to 2 tsps as the first time I made it with the full amount of yeast it acutally lifted the lid of my breadmaker. My husband loves this bread which I have made at least five times, and each time it comes out perfect.  I also made hamburger buns with this recipe using the dough cycle, then cutting the resulting dough into 8 pcs, shaping into rolls. Left them to rise again on a parchment lined baking tray until doubled baked at 375F for 20 minutes. My husband has stated he does not want store bought buns again. Love this recipe and have now laminated the printed receipt to keep it clean.
Definitely 5 stars.

Foolproof is right! I even forgot to add the salt and the bread still came out light and fluffy. It is in the oven now becoming croutons. But I wanted to say that putting the yeast together with the water first definitely does not fly against all the rules of breadmaking. In fact in all breadmaking apart from bread machines, it is one of the keys to success. It is called "proofing" the yeast. This way you are sure that your yeast is alive before you go through all the trouble of kneading and/or wasting the rest of your ingredients. What you don't want to do is add salt to your water. That can kill the yeast.  So add that as per instructions after the flour. Can't wait to try this again later with the salt lol. Thanks for a great recipe and instructions.

BY FAR THE VERY BEST AND EASIEST BREAD I EVER TRIED TO MAKE.   EVEN THOUGH I COOK ALL THE TIME, HESITATE WITH BREAD MAKING BECAUSE IT NEVER TURNS OUT RIGHT, BUT THIS WAS FOOLPROOF.    AFTER READING MANY OF  THE REVIEWS, I TOO DECIDED TO USE THE BREAD MACHINE ONLY FOR THE DOUGH CYCLE AND THEN PUT IT IN A GREASED BREAD PAN AND LET IT RISE IN AN OVEN WHICH HAD BEEN PRE-WARMED TO 200 DEGREES. I COVERED IT WITH A DISH TOWEL AND   AS SOON AS IT ROSE, I BAKED IT ABOUT 30 MIN. AT 350 DEGREES.   IT WAS JUST THE VERY BEST BREAD---EVEN PRETTY AND VERY TASTY.    I ALSO MADE A SECOND LOAF AS ANOTHER REVIEWER SUGGESTED WITH CINNAMON/BROWN SUGAR AND RAISINS WHICH WAS EQUALLY GOOD.    THANKS FOR A GREAT FOOLPROOF RECIPE!!!!!   DON'T BE AFRAID TO PUT THE YEAST IN THE LIQUID EVEN THOUGH YOUR BREAD MACHINE ADVISES AGAINST IT.   IF ALL THEIR RECIPES WERE SO GREAT, WHY DO I SEE BREAD MACHINES AT EVERY GARAGE SALE I GO TO???  I DO THINK THAT BAKING IT IN THE OVEN OFFERED A MORE UNIFORM, CONSISTENT SIZED BREAD AND DON'T THINK I WILL EVER LET IT BAKE IN THE BREAD MACHINE.   IT WAS JUST TOO PRETTY COMING OUT OF THE OVEN  THIS WAY.

great recipe.  I've made it just as directed and it's great.  I've also altered it with an extra 1/2 tsp salt and 1/3 cup whole wheat flour and 2 and 2/3 cups bread flour and also great!  Also have substituted some of the oil with melted butter.  The recipe holds up well to alterations.  The family loves it!

I took everyone's advice and stuck to the recipe.  It came out REALLY light and airy, and so SO good!!  It's a nice standard bread for everyday, but could easily be dressed up with herbs.  

Oh, and I didn't have vegetable oil on hand so ended up using olive oil (not virgin) and see no need to try it another way.  A good substitution if you want to make this more heart healthy.  Thank you!

Like other reviewers, I was hesitant about letting the yeast sit in the water first, but I had no problems at all with this bread rising.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  The only thing I did different was I only used my bread machine on the dough setting.   When that was done, I pulled the dough out and put it in a regular bread pan & baked it at 350 for 30 min.  This dough rose fast & beautifully.  I think better than other dough recipe I have used.  When I first glanced in the bread machine, I thought this dough was going to be sticky, but it wasn't.  I was able to turn it out of the bread maker into my counter easily.  Nice elastic dough.  I'm making more of this bread today.

WOW!!  This is the BEST bread machine recipe I have ever used!  The only thing I changed was I used Splenda instead of sugar due to special dietary needs.  I put it on the medium setting and the crust did turn out a little light so next time I'll put it on the dark setting.  Still, the crust is flaky and has a nice crunch.  The inside is incredibly soft.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!  I will definitely be using this again!!

I make this about twice a week for our sandwich loafs.  Make the dough in the bread machine, but finish it off in the oven.  If you do this, cut a slit down the center and allow the dough to rise in bread pan for 40 minutes.  I brush with milk and bake at 350 for 30 minutes.  Also I put a cake pan filled with water underneath the bread as it bakes.  Perfect every time.  I've also used the dough to make rolls (was pretty good that way, but much better as loaf)

I nearly passed up this recipe because the idea of dissolving the yeast in the pan of a bread machine seemed absurd. I never realized how perfect a loaf could come out of my machine until I tried it. Pillowy soft, flaky crust, it rised to the top of the pan too.

Simple recipe that tastes terrific. It's a good everyday loaf, easily sliced for sandwiches. I have made it at least 10 times now, and it is good as is, or with whole wheat flour substituted for 1/2-1 cup of the flour. Thanks for sharing this terrific recipe.

This is a great starter recipe and allowed me to finally have soft bread from the bread machine. If you are looking for something to be used for sandwiches, this is it! Since I've gotten my bread machine and found this recipe, I have not purchased store bought bread. I've used the recipe as is but now have made changes to make it healthier. I use olive oil, a combination of bread flour and whole wheat flour, add oatmeal and wheat gluten and it is perfect.

I have mixed feelings about this bread.  It rose really high and then as soon as the bake setting started, it fell (it almost looked like a split-top loaf).  I sliced it and made some toast for myself and the flavor was good, but I could tell that there was just too much yeast.  This could also be due to the "proofing" method that this recipe uses.  Bread machine yeast does not need to be proofed, that is why the recipes always call for adding the yeast last.  I'm going to do some experimenting with this recipe and see what works best.

OK now I am sure there must be something wrong with my bread machine. This came out dense and flavourless and salty.

Thank you! I had almost given up on my bread machine. I tried the recipes included with the machine, various ones from websites and newsletters - this is the best! Followed the recipe as written and set the machine on "light". This is so great... thank you, thank you!

This is the best bread machine bread I have found. I did use 1 1/2 tsp of salt like most people suggested.   I used the dough cycle because I don't like the shape of the bread from the machine.  It is a square loaf.  I like the more traditional style.
I put it in the pan and let it rise for about a half hour.  I then put it in the oven at 350 degrees and let it bake about 30 minutes.  After it was done I brushed melted butter over the top which made the crust softer.  I have made it twice and both times they turned out great.

I used 1 cup 115°F  water, 3 T real cane sugar, 2 tsp bread machine yeast, ¼ cup EVOO, 2 ½ cups bread flour, ½ cup wheat flour, and 1 ½ tsp salt, combining a few reviews I read. I just got my brand new breadmaker today, and have not made bread in 10 years because the results (by hand) were awful. This recipe make PERFECT, AWESOME bread. I let it sit for 15 minutes after immediately removing it from the breadmaker pan and was able to slice it perfectly then, and after it cooled with no “smooshing” or too much crumb loss. Definitely will reuse this!!

This was my first time using a recipe for my breadmaker other than the ones provided. Every time I would make bread from the enclosed recipes it NEVER turned out.

This recipe was PERFECT! I like my bread a little saltier, so I added a bit more salt to the flour. This way it is perfect for sandwiches!

The bread was so good, and so easy to make. I used active dry yeast instead of breadmaker yeast and it worked REALLY well!

The crust was delicious, and the bread was soft and wonderful on the inside! Thansk for sharing!

This was my first time using my own bread machine, but I've had lots of bread machine bread before.  This is the best I've ever tasted!  It reminded me of the bread my grandmother made when I was growing up.  The texture wasn't quite as nice, but the taste was there...especially the next day!  I look forward to making many variations of this bread in the future.  Thanks!

***My new favorite variation is to use 1/2 to 1 cup of whole wheat flour, honey instead of sugar, and applesauce instead of oil.  Yum!

Just used a flour called Manitoba Flour, produced from 100% Canadian Wheat its a strong protein flour ideal for bread & pasta, you only need 2 & 1/3 cups of the flour [if you use the recommended 3 cups its rises too much & pushed up the lid of my bread maker by about 1/4 of an inch!!] if you live in England the flour is produced by Marriages The Master Millers based in Chelmsford, try it the results are excellent, makes the bread even better [hard to believe, I know but trust me]

This recipe saved our bread machine from being recycled. Perfect bread finally.  I did follow the suggestion of changing the salt to 1 1/2 tsp which is needed. Bread flour is the best, and I sometimes use 1/3 cup oil instead of 1/4 cup. Recently I started making homemade Greek yogurt and had lots of whey left over after draining it. I use 1 cup of the whey instead of water and the bread is even better! Kind of like sourdough, and full of extra protein. bread usually gets eaten up within the same day by my family.

Like another poster, I was scared about putting the yeast in with the water, but the results were AMAZING!  Fluffy and crusty and just perfect! I used butter for the oil because that's what I had, and turbinado sugar for the same reason, but I did have bread flour so I don't know if regular flour would work the same way. I also used a heaping tsp of salt instead of a flat measure because of what another poster said. Subsequently, this was the BEST white bread recipe I've tried in my bread maker so far. I'll try the yeast+water thing with all my bread maker bread. I think that's what makes it work so well.

This is good tasting bread overall, however I followed others suggestions and added the extra 1/2 tsp of salt which I thought was too much, the bread just seemed to taste slightly salty to me. I may try sticking with the 1 tsp as per the recipe next time. I also made the following changes of my own, instead of 3 c of white flour I used 1/3c soy flour, 1 1/3c white flour and 1 1/3c whole wheat flour. The loaf came out very nice.

had to tinker with this a little, since it didn't rise much. I tried adding the extra 1/2tsp of salt, as several users suggested, but that was too much. the perfect loaf ended up being 1.25tsp salt, 3tbsp sugar, and 3 cups of all-purpose flour with 2tsp baking soda added. I live below sea level so rising is usually a problem. but I love this recipe with the slight modifications. great bread for sandwiches. I stopped buying store bread completely.

I use this recipe exclusively for white bread.  The only change I have made is to use 2 and 1/2 tsp. of salt, as suggested by ICYBLUEROSE.  Allow the yeast to percolate in the water and sugar for at least ten minutes before adding oil and the dry ingredients.  Perfect white bread every time.  Would love to have a foolproof, whole wheat bread recipe as easy as this white bread.

My bread machine instructions, like so many others, says to not let the yeast touch the liquid, but I made this as directed and it turned out lovely!  I realized, last night, that I didn't have bread for my son's lunch.  Neither did I have time to run to the store, so I threw the ingredients in my bread machine and he and I are both tickled with the results.  Great sandwich bread AND the house smelled great (a perk you just can't get from store bought bread).

This bread made me throw away the recipe book that came with my new bread machine. I've made it twice and highly recommend it, with a minor tweak. As written, it's pretty close to my memory of Wonder Bread, extremely light and very fluffy. Just a tiny bit too fluffy for me. The second batch I baked using LUBSY's variation for a whole wheat loaf. Check the "most helpful" reviews, it's at or near the top. This was a better match for my taste. We prefer Arnold's/Oroweat brands, and the whole wheat variation is spot on. I screwed up and forgot the dry milk. It still rocked, soft and fluffy. Can't wait to add hot cereal to it for a multi-grain loaf. For burger/hotdog rolls, use the original recipe with the following changes: use butter instead of oil, increase sugar to 3 tablespoons, add ¼ cup dry milk.  Delicious. I used an egg white wash to adhere sesame seeds to my hamburger rolls, and tossed the yolk into the dough. *UPDATE* After returning my Hamilton Beach and West Bend machines in favor of a Zo Virtuoso, the difference is night and day. The Zo bakes ~70º lower than most other machines, giving this loaf the soft flaky crust it should have. I no longer need to proof the yeast at all, and I can sub 1 cup WW w/o adding gluten. I also add dry milk for flavor and use honey in both the white and wheat. The white bread is so soft I have to keep it in the fridge so I can cut it. I may switch to white WW to add a little extra body to it. Truly, the Zo is a miracle bread maker.

I have been on the site for years and this is the first time I felt the need to write a review. This bread recipe is really the best bread machine recipe ever. I have tried to make bread in the machine before it always turns out good but this recipe turned out nice and fluffy the first time I made it. This is my new favorite recipe I am no longer buying store bought bread. As a previous reviewer wrote about adding extra salt, I took that suggestion and added the extra salt and it turned out perfect.

This really is the best bread! I followed the directions, using Active Dry yeast mixed with the warm water and sugar in the pan prior to adding the remaining ingredients. Instead of vegetable oil, I used olive oil because it is what I had on hand. This was used for the 1.5 lb bread setting, on light or medium color. Even my 9-year old, who hasn't been a fan of my homemade bread, told me it tasted like store bought. Thank you so much for this recipe! I'm already making a second loaf!

My interest for this recipe was peaked when I read the instructions.  This method reminded me of making bread prior to my having a bread machine.  So I followed the recipe exactly for loaf #1.  The bread turned out good.  I then made loaf #2 following the machine instructions (adding yeast last, etc.).  Loaf #2 turned out better.  It rose more and therefore was less dense.  I don’t know if anyone tried this, but in my opinion, follow the machine instructions and save yourself some time.

This is a wonderful, basic recipe.  Turns out very well.  It turns out just fine if I skip the yeast dissolving.  My machine's book said to not let the yeast and water touch each other so that if you were making a loaf in advance, the yeast would not begin to grow.  Doing it on the spot is fine, it you want to spend the time. Also, I've subbed up to 1/2 of the flour with whole wheat.  I do use more salt as one reviewer suggested.  Yum!

I'm new to using my bread machine and was nervous about using a recipe that went against the instructions that came with my machine.  However, the bread is amazing!  I've taken to making one loaf at the beginning of the week and then another loaf at the end of the week.  My family has been able to avoid buying bread from the store for a whole month!  Awesome!  
The last two weeks I started to use honey instead of sugar to activate the yeast and then used 1 c. of wheat flour along with 2 c. bread flour.  I've been using olive oil the whole time and I put in about 1 t. of kosher salt.  The results are spectacular!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I learned two things when I tried this recipe.  One is that the bread machine instructions for baking bread need to be tossed out a window.  Two is that I need a bigger bread machine, as this method of activating the yeast prior to adding the other ingredients (which is completely contrary to what the recipe in the machine booklet tells you to do) prompted the loaf to rise about 50% higher than it normally does in my machine.

A few notes: I used plain old all purpose flour because it's what I had on hand, and substituted honey for the sugar, and this bread is amazing.  The crust is just crunchy and chewy enough, and the inside is amazingly soft and tender.  Definitely worth me now having to scrape baked-on bread off the lid of my bread machine because the loaf rose so high.  This one is absolutely a keeper.

This is really the best bread recipe ever! I was really sceptical at first due to adding the yeast to the water but after reading all the reviews, I figured I'd give it a try. Boy am I ever glad I did! I tried it for the 1st time a few weeks ago & the hubby & I loved it so much that I've been making 2 loaves a week. I tried it exactly as the recipe called for 1st, then slowly, each time I tried some of the suggestions. I do however, use bread machine yeast and oly use about 1 1/2 teaspoons of yeast, instead of the 2 1/4 that everyone else seems to be using. My bread still turns out great & fluffy and I don't need to add more salt. I made another loaf last night & it was the best one. I used honey instead of sugar, 2 cups of all purpose flour, 1 cup of whole wheat flour, and then when the machine beeped to add more ingredients, I added just over 1/4 cup of ground flax seed. It was amazing & we loved it!

Great recipe. Made this last night, and it turned out perfectly. I only added a little vanilla, because I always do that. Perfectly crusty outside, and perfectly pillow soft on the inside. Thank you! I will make this again and again.

LOVE this recipe!!! So quick and easy. I do sub 1C whole wheat flour/ 2C bread flour, honey for sugar & olive oil for veg oil just to keep it a little healthier. 

QUICK TIP: I put all my dry ingredients into a Ziploc bag & make enough bags for the week. In the AM I just put in the water, honey, and oil... dump in the bag & I'm ready to go! Since we have a large family I make bread every morning. This is easy enough to do while waiting on my coffee to brew :-)

Foolproof recipe indeed... Worked like a miracle for me after several failures in my new kenwood bread machine. I thought buying the machine was a fault but I guess now I got no regrets. Going by the book(user manual) is of no good here. Rather mixing the sugar and yeast first in water as given here in this recipe does indeed swing the magic wand. I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour with 1 cup all-purpose flour and 200ml warm water and 50 ml milk(instead of 1 cup warm water=250ml. My mother is diabetic so I reduce the sugar to 1 tablespoon. Rest all ingredients were of the same quantity as given here n I got a real nice, soft, fluffy, a hot  and sexy bread ready!!!!

I made this recipe this morning and what a beautiful loaf of bread it is.  The inside texture is light and airy and the flavor is just amazing.  

I will never follow the bread machine instructions again concerning the placement of the yeast.  Adding the yeast to the warm liquid first with the sugar makes a world of difference in the end result of bread machine bread. 

Thank you for a fabulous recipe!!!

Awesome...I have made this many times. as written- great but you need to add the other half teaspoon of salt- it makes a difference.

I have never proofed yeast in a bread machine but I will do it from now on.
This is my go to recipe for sure- I do 3 TBS of sugar (we like a little sweet- it sounds like a ton but it isn't) , I also use 2 cups bread flour and 1 cup whole wheat.
I also use the dough cycle- pull it out and then let it rise for another 30-60 minutes in a greased Pampered Chef stone loaf pan. I then bake it about 25 minutes on 350 in the oven.
Great sandwich bread! Amazing!

For those who gave bad reviews, not sure why...this is awesome. 
Thanks so much for sharing this easily customizable awesome recipe!

Excellent!  Finally made a great loaf of bread from my machine.  I had given up years ago because following the manufacturers' directions yielded a poor product.  The only change I made was to increase the salt to 1 1/2 tsp as others suggested.
Thanks SO MUCH!!

Fantastic loaf of bread!  I've tried this loaf exactly as written, nd I've made modifications like so many other reviewers and it has always been delicious!  This time I have added some reconstituted onions & a little onion powder, again came out wondeful!

I have made this bread several times now and it has come out perfectly every time.  I used regular all purpose flour because that's all I had, and it was outstanding.  I don't think I've ever actually made it with bread flour!

I calculated this recipe to make 8 servings which brought the amount of flour used to 2 cups. I was hesitant to try this since the conventional way of using the bread machine always uses the yeast last. I am so glad I made this bread! Delicious and fluffy white bread out of the machine! Even with reducing the recipe servings this bread rose to the top of the machine. Make this if you haven't. Make it again if you have.

used regular yeast and flour due to not having anything else on hand. Followed the recipe exactly as written and its awesome! Came out beautiful. I have no idea why some people have issues with it rising to much..maybe climate is the reason?

This is a great recipe, as is. However, for a 'fluffier' sandwich-suitable bread similar to store bought, I like to use 2 tbsp of agave nectar instead of sugar. I use the bread machine yeast (1 1/4 tsp.). 

I ran out of bread flour and tried 1/2 with whole wheat flour- and it was even better! Great basic recipe.

This was a wonderful, simple white bread.  I used 1 1/2 tsp of yeast from the jar and chose the light setting.  I will definitely make it again.

SUPER good bread. Way better than expected. I used the dough cycle on my bread machine, baked it in my oven. I put corn meal in the bread pan, which gave it a nice added crunch. Making third loaf in 2 days, it's going fast.

This is the best bread I have ever tried, and I make a lot of bread! This is the only recipe I've ever rated as well. I added 3 T of vital wheat gluten and 1/4 cup of oats. I don't have a bread machine so kneaded it, let it rise for 45 minutes, punched it down, shaped it, put it in the pan and let it rise for another 30 minutes. I baked it at 350 for 30 minutes and it was perfect!

Terrific recipe! If you want a really crispy crust just leave out the oil. It dries out faster but never lasts longer than a day in my house anyway.  I have also made it with two and a half cups of white bread flour and a half cup of stone ground rye flour - delicious!

I use this as my main bread recipe.  My only changes are using olive oil instead of veg oil, and using 2 cups white flour, 1 cup wheat and also adding about 1/4 cup flax seed.  This makes a very healthy bread and it's still soft!

I wouldnt say this recipe was foolproof for me.. because it took me several times to get it right because I like to use other flour in my bread so finding the right mixture so it would still rise was a challenge.  I use 1/3 white, 1/3 wheat, and 1/3 oat flour.. anyways.. this recipe and the order in which you are to do it is amazing.. I wont ever look for another recipe!  Rises everytime!

OMG! This is without a doubt, the best bread that has ever come out of my bread machine! I had always put in the yeast last and the bread comes out like a brick. Proofing the yeast first is the best thing to do! I actually substituted 3/4 cup of corn meal for 3/4 cup of regular flour and it absolutely came out amazing! I will never, ever, lose this recipe!

Huh. I'm dumbfounded.  This is the lightest bread machine bread we have EVER had.  Usually our bread machine bread doesn't rise well and is extremely dense.  I wonder if the bread machine makers had it wrong this whole time! My husband liked it so well, he requested it again!  He never does that!  Thanks a bunch!

Caution - someone said that .25 oz of yeast = 1  1/2 tsp of bulk yeast but according to every reference I have found on the Web, .25 oz actually = 2 1/4 tsp.    Using the 2 1/4 tsp of bread machine yeast, I followed the recipe using, as recommended, 1 1/2 tsp salt. I had to use AP flour as I had no bread flour.  I have an old bread maker and though it did not rise as much as some others had described, it still made amazing bread.  We had it for dinner with a thick broccoli cheese soup and Wow! The heels of the bread were my favorite.  They were tender and crunchy!  Unlike any homemade bread I have tried before.    My bread maker makes an odd shaped loaf, however, which is difficult to slice for sandwiches and doesn't fit in my toaster so I am going to try it again today but using my KitchenAid dough hooks and cooking in a bread pan as another reviewer suggested.  I think I will also use butter rather than oil and make another loaf tomorrow with olive oil.  Also, I am thinking of using regular instead of bread machine yeast because, as one other reviewer said - it isn't necessary to proof bread machine yeast.

I mistakenly used only 1 1/4 t yeast, and it still baked beautifully in the bread maker.  I wouldn't have wanted it to rise any higher!

Found this recipe this morning, made it, and LOVE it.  My 3 children said this is the best bread I have ever made (in my bread machine).  Thanks for sharing this recipe and for all the high ratings which made me want to try it. YUM!

I had to alter the recipe for high altitude (over 7,500') and this is the first bread I have baked in a bread machine at this altitude that has not collapsed. Following your directions, I've made several loaves that have all come out perfectly! These are the ingredients I use: 1 1/3 cup tepid water, 1 1/2 Tbsp sugar, 1 1/2 tsp cold yeast, 1/4 cup olive oil, 3 cups bread flour (more if needed,) 1 1/2 tsp salt. I think proofing the yeast is the important part, I'll try this with other recipes as soon as I am willing to take a chance on failure.  Right now this recipe is a sure thing!

This DID NOT work for me.  I followed the directions precisely and ended up with a lumpy loaf that did not rise (made with brand new yeast).  This is the 5th bread machine recipe I have tried and was the only one that did not rise.  The loaf ended up being dense with a crunchy crust.  I have already thrown this recipe away.  :(

After trying out many different bread machine recipes I found this one to be the best.  If it lasts for several days it is still soft unlike many other recipes.  It tastes great and everyone that I have had try it loves it.  Never buying grocery bread again.  This one is a winner.  **Note: Like other reviewers have stated it will rise very high and sometimes kisses the top of my bread machine.  Still wonderful anyways.

I've been trying to avoid buying store bought bread. We are in the middle of packing to move to a new house, and my bread machine recipe book was already packed.  (But the machine wasn't...)  I only had 2.25 tsp of yeast left.  I prayed as I started making the bread... especially since it was going totally against what my 10 year old bread machine said I should do...  I will not use the machines recipe book for white bread ever again.  This was the best loaf of bread that has ever come out of that machine.  And trust me, I've tried quite a few times with other recipes just trying to get the results that I got with this simple and yes fool-proof recipe.

In fact, as I type this review (the next morning) I am typing as I enjoy two slices of the bread toasted with butter and jelly and some coffee.  I will need to go out and stock up on my yeast, because this is the bread that I will make always.

Thank you so much for this awesome bread recipe.

BTW, I did add an extra 1/2 teaspoon of salt like others suggested...

My bread turned out to be a brick!  I tried it twice thinking that it was user error, but it turned out the same both times.  Very disappointing and we had to throw it out.

I made this exactly as written but I didn't bake this in the bread machine. I just needed the dough for some kraut burgers (aka bierocks or Runza's) so I just set this on the dough setting. Worked beautifully and everything came out just great - taste was great, too! Way less time intensive than my homemade bread. Thanks so much!!

I love this recipe!!  I put in 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 2 cups of bread flour.  I also substitute the oil with 1/4 cup of applesauce and it turns out great.  I make it at least 4 times a week!!  Thank you!!!

This was very good! I did not disolve yeast like it said, as I set the timer on my machine.  I added liquids, sugar, flour, salt and lastly yeast.  Came home to perfect loaf of bread!  The second time I made this I stayed at home, so I did desolve the yeast like it said, used canola oil and 1.5 teaspoons of salt and the loaf was better than the first.  Great recipe!!!

I followed recommendations of adding an extra 1/2 tsp salt, and it rose beautifully. This was really soft inside with a crunchy outside. I like this, and didn't taste any oil flavour - as others said they had. This is soft enough to use for sandwiches.

This bread is awesome.  Came out really good, fluffy, soft, tasty, and flakey crust.  What more could I ask for?  FOR THOSE THAT ARE HAVING TROUBLE WITH BREAD FALLING....ADD ANOTHER HALF A TSP. OF SALT.  IT WILL RISE WONDERFULLY.

The first time I tried this recipe my head was most certainly not into what I was supposed to be doing. First, I forgot to attach the little paddle until most of the flour had been added, so as carefully as possible I dug down in there and attached it. Then, as I was measuring the yeast into the only dry spot left in the flour where I could dig a little hole, I for some reason remembered the yeast container stating 'refrigerate after opening' the first time I used it. My next thought was "I didn't take this out of the refrigerator, so what..?" I was ever so carefully measuring Beef Boullion powder into that little hole. That whole mess went straight into the trash and I started all over again. This time I paid attention to what I was doing and made one mighty fine loaf of bread. I loved the flavor and the texture as perfect. I will most definitly make it again!

I got a bread machine for Christmas and used this recipe - it was awesome. I added 1.5 tsp. bread machine yeast (which made it rise a little more after the first loaf - I made 3) After the kneading was done about 45 mins. I added 1 cup of chopped cheddar cheese and it was the best bread I have ever had! Thank you! I made 3 loaves and can't wait to make more!

This was a good, beginning recipe, and it went well with my homemade chicken soup.
I added the extra salt recommended in another posting and when I found out that I was out of vegetable oil, I substituted olive oil.
One suggestion though. Keep and eye on the dough during the first kneading cycle, and adjust accordingly with extra flour or liquid.

I am sitting here eating a warm slice right now and I love it! I gave some to my daughter with her snack with jam and she said it was the best I have made.
   I made 2 loaves today. The only difference I did between them was I used kosher salt and that one raised to the top of my  machine. The other raised a normal height, which I like better, so I might stick to the regular recipe amount with the kosher next time.
   I have made many different white loaves in my Bread Machine and this one has turned out the best. Very light and fluffy like opening a bag of wonder bread without that nasty preservative smell. It tastes like a normal bread that you would use to make toast, sandwhiches or just spread some butter on and enjoy.If you want more flavor hten just add something like garlic powder to the flour.
  I read other comments before hand and I tweaked it like suggested: 1 1/2 tsp salt,3 tbs Vital wheat glueten (you take 3 tbs away from the flour and add the gluten to it) and I used olive oil instead of the veggie oil. I plan on making another loaf for tomorrows spaghetti dinner, adding some basil and garlic to the oil....
Also a tip: always use room temp ingrediants (except the water).

I used this recipe today and I loved it it's soft,tasty. I hope noone get's mad at me but I don't think we should give someone less stars just because we feel like the bread tasted bland because when someone post there recipes they have made up that recipes for there tast, familys tast so you should already know that you might have to fix the recipe to tast the way you,your family would like it.

I used 2 1/2 cups bread flour & 1/2 cup whole wheat flour.  I did not wait the 10 minutes for the yeast to foam; I simply added the ingredients to my bread machine as usual.  It made a delicious bread that rose beautifully and freezes well.  Thank you.

I was so glad I found this recipe.  I had inherited a bread machine without the instruction book, so I never knew which order to add the ingredients.  This recipe worked perfectly, and I have made a-loaf using this method.  I have made a couple of changes to perfect each one - I add only half the sugar and the other half I use raw honey.  I use beer instead of water and butter instead of oil.  I have also added garlic and onion powder for garlic bread, and I have tried it with sourdough flour, whole wheat flour, ground oats, flaxseed, poppyseeds and lemon juice.  I am never disappointed!  Thanks so much for sharing!

This is a good recipe! I used corn oil and 1 ts of rapid rise bread machine yeast and was very impressed with the results. The texture was fantastic--light, fluffy, with a chewy crust. Good all-around white bread.

Also, I did not dissolve the yeast or salt into the water and the bread was great.

I followed the recipe exactly except I baked it in a regular bread pan in the oven at 350 for approx. 35 min.  It's the best white bread that I've ever baked... really fluffy, like store-bought bread. My husband said that it was better than Wonder, which is his favorite.

It doesnt get any easier or better than this bread. Delicious and easy. I usually fool around with recipes but I stuck exactly to the recipe and it turned out absoutely perfect. Light flakey crust and perfect texture on the inside. I have resurrected my bread machine and will be dumping wonder bread :)
Thanks for sharing your recipe!

If I could give this recipie more stars, I would.  The entire family loved this bread.  My husband wants me to make more.  I followed the recipie to the letter and the result was a large, tall loaf that had a crunchy crust on the outside and was soft on the inside (just like a loaf of fresh-baked french bread).  I will definitely make this over and over.

This is the best recipe I've found for the bread machine. Way better than the one that came with it. The bread is light and tender not heavy and hard like i was used to. I followed the recipe exactly and am extremely happy with the results.

Very nice bread. Makes a great white sandwich bread. Same as I was buying at a local shop. I used 1 1/2 teaspoons of yeast. The bread was nice and tall in the machine. The crust was nice and chewy, and the inside texture was very soft. I did not follow the recipe directions. I followed the guidlines of my bread machine to put the ingredients in the machine in the order the bread machine requires. Each machine is different.

This was the first loaf of bread I made in my brand new 2# bread machine. What can I say? It rose right, it looked right, it tasted right. It's a very good basic white bread recipe. The bread has great texture, and the loaf I made would work really well for sandwiches or French toast. UPDATE: I also tried making this bread without first proofing the yeast and just following the instructions for my bread machine (wet - dry - then yeast). It came out identical to the last one where I followed the recipe exactly. Just make sure you use bread machine yeast if you do it this way. I also tried adding 2 T butter, which did not seem to affect it at all, but I'm not sure it really added much to the flavor so I probably will just stick to the original ingredients from now on.

This is excellent bread. I was feeling like I couldn't use my bread machine after my last loaf, it turned out very dense and didn't rise. This was perfect. I made it last night, and it is already gone! No changes to this recipe, it is a definate keeper. Thanks

What a great recipe!  I made two loaves.  The first I used all-purpose unbleached flour and olive oil.  It turned out fabulous!  The second loaf, I used 2 cups of the same flour, 1/2 cup of oatmeal and 1/2 cup of wheat germ.  That loaf turned out just as lovely.  I use my bread machine on the dough setting and then let the dough rise for the second time in a stoneware bread pan and bake in the oven at 350 until browned.  YUM!  It's perfect for sandwiches, too!

This is the only recipe that works consistently with my bread machine.  I swap out 1/2 the sugar for an equal amount of 100% maple syrup, I use canola oil instead for vegetable oil, and 1/2-1 c of the flour for whole wheat (to give it a little more body and nutrition).  It's really delicious, and it works every time.

I have to say this recipe is incredible. I have made 22 loaves and none have failed. I tried using 2 cups white flour and 1 cup wheat flour and it was wonderful wheat bread. I use the dough setting and then bake in the oven. I bag it while it is still pretty warm and it softens very well. I have to say if you can't make this bread turn out good stop trying to make bread. You must not be cut out to be a cook. I recommend this recipe highly

Not that my voice needs to be added to the chorus of great reviews on this recipe, nevertheless, I just had to say that this is THE best bread machine recipe I have come across.  The bread was light, flavorful and the crust was not the usual thick skin that my bread machine produces.  In fact, the crust was wonderfully flaky and the bread made incredible grilled cheese sandwiches.  I can guarantee that I will be using this recipe often!  5 Stars Karen! Thanks!

First recipe tried other than recipes bought with machine (tried several since). This was great! Very crusty and extremely light and fluffy. A touch sweet - but personal taste. My 3 yr old liked it. From over 20 loaves tried so far is definately the best. Shall be making regularly.

I used this dough to make Pepperoni bread.  I simply set the machine on dough cycle, rolled dough out onto a jelly roll pan (about 1/4" thick) placed a layer of thin sliced pepperoni & added a layer of low moisture mozzerella, rolled the bread into a long loaf (sealing the seams) brushed with an egg wash & baked at 350 for 25 min.  My family loves it!

I don't have vegtable oil, so substituted with Garbonella Olive Oil.
Resulting in excellent loaf. I couldn't get other breads to rise properly using bread machine's manufacturers instructions, i.e. don't let yeast touch liquid at start. Using this recipe you get a better rise, though you must keep an eye on it on the final bake cycle as the top crust may push against the window.

Wonderful!  Here in Enland it appears difficult to find recipes that work like this one and produces a light bread.  I have tried using 2 cups bread flour to one of granary or wheatmeal or wholemeal for a change.  Yummy!

I have tried many bread machine recipes and this one takes the cake!  It uses fewer ingredients and it's healthier to use oil instead of butter.  I, too, was afraid of putting the yeast in the water after bread machine recipes specifically state not to do so - go figure!  It's the best basic white bread recipe I have ever tried.  Thank you!

With a few modifications this recipe is AMAZING!! Instead of 1tsp of salt I added 1.5 tsp. I also used regular flour instead of bread flour(it's all I had). I used my bread maker to kneed, pound and rise the dough. When the cooking step comes I remove the dough from the bread maker. I put it in a loaf pan lightly sprayed with cooking spray. I let the dough rise covered with a damp cloth for 30min. I then cook the dough @ 375 for 30min. It's so delicious!!! I will never buy bread anymore!!

I've tried A LOT of homemade bread recipes as I have a child with severe food allergies and we have to know what goes into his food that he eats.  This one is my favorite!  The texture is wonderful, and the crust is crisp.  The best homemade bread recipe I've ever made!

I had almost given up on my bread machine as the bread wasn't rising and I was ending up with dense bread.  I pulled my machine out and proofed the yeast first with the sugar and water.  I did this in a separate bowl.  Then I added it to my machine.  I added the balance of the ingredients.  It made a beautiful loaf.  It was good toasted and also for grilled cheese sandwiches.  If you are having the same problem I was, try it this way.  I now realize that the water was not warm enough when I put my past bread recipe ingredients I was using in my machine.  When I proofed the yeast, I knew it was going to rise.  The temperature of the water is very important.  If you are just doing it by feel, the water needs to be hotter than what you might think  warm water is.

I believe this lived up to its name.   This was the first recipe I chose for my new bread machine, and it was perfect.  The final product was so soft and had the nice light texture that has previously eluded me in my homemade bread.  I have a feeling this is going to become a go-to recipe for us. Thanks!

Very good.  I made it exact except I used more salt as others recommended.  I don't have one thing I would change.  Basically my husband and I ate bread for dinner.  Well... bread, butter & jam.
Having bread wasn't pathetic plan. It turned out we kept cutting "just another slice" until we were too full to eat anything else.

HOLY COW!!! I was one more hard, dense, doorstop of a loaf away from shelving my very expensive (zojirushi) bread machine good until I saw this recipe. Put the yeast in the water! It's the only thing I hadn't tried. This loaf is AMAZING! So high I can barely fit it in my bread box, so light and airy it is difficult to slice without squishing it (it bounces back). We ate half of it in one sitting and we have barely eaten any bread since I bought the machine! Make this, follow the recipe , and learn to love your bread machine!

I've had a bread machine for 13 years. I've been making this recipe for all of those 13 years. It is the BEST basic bread recipe. It's perfect for Texas toast and especially French toast. The crust isn't tough and it stands up to the egg mixture very well. I use it to make bread crumbs, croutons (herbs added of course) and any number of sandwiches. When our son lived here he couldn't wait for it to be done. He'd eat big chunks of it right off the loaf. 

You will not be disappointed in this recipe. You can always add some things to it. It's very forgiving. I've added cinnamon and raisins with a little bit of brown sugar. Craisins and pecans, blue berries for blue berry french toast. Let your imagination run wild. Best basic bread recipe ever.

The BEST, plain white bread in a machine, that we ever made. I was hesitant because, as other comments shared, the process is the opposite of recipes and instructions included with your bread machine. My Breadman has a more traditional style pan (horizontal) than some that a vertical and uniform loaf. After reading many comments, the only change I made was an extra large pinch of salt (not even another 1/2 tsp. as some suggested) to hopefully keep the bread from falling after baking. My bread was a full 7" high after baking and did not fall. I sliced it thick (Texas style) for French toast and it was the best I've ever made. I used 10 eggs with milk, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla for my batter to make French toast from this one loaf. It was so fluffy and moist that you'll quit going to your local restaurant for French toast. It was wonderful.

My whole family loves this bread! I didn't follow the instructions, though, i put the ingredients in the order recommended by the manufacturer (liquid first, then solid and yeast on top) and it still comes out absolutely delicious - it also is very quick, takes me under 5 minutes each night and then we have a delicious breakfast! thank you!

Im a relatively new bread maker so I wanted something tried and tested by the Allrecipes family! :) I found this recipe and got to work. I did the recipe exactly as stated, though I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I put the ingredients in the bread machine to kneed the dough but then I put it in a bread pan to rise for 30 mins and then cooked at 375 for 30 mins, as was suggested here. AMAZING! It's melt in your mouth good. Slightly crispy crust and soft inside. I've since made it several times. Favorite recipe so far!

This made a beautiful loaf -- firm, crunchy crust and a light, tender crumb. My only substitution was honey for the sugar. On a side note, I have noticed repeatedly that in bread making, weighing the flour is far more accurate than the old scoop n' sweep method of measuring.

I never could understand why the "yeast should never touch the liquid" when using a machine - after all, many hand made recipes instruct you to dissolve the yeast in warm liquid. This recipe is proof that it works in your machine too. The texture is tender and light, the crust is not too hard and the flavor is fabulous! Now I need a whole wheat loaf that is as good as this!

I actually love this recipe based on the notion that you give the yeast and sugar a head start to work their magic.  However, because the salt amount asked for is wrong I had to give this only 3 stars.  If you add an extra teaspoon of salt (to make 2 teaspoons total) it's perfect!  I also always use one cup of whole wheat flour to give it a little more density and nutrition.  Unfortunately, using any more whole wheat flour than that doesn't allow the bread to actually rise enough, so you have to use at least two cups of white bread flour, especially if you are using the rapid rise cycle.  It also makes a really excellent white bread loaf if that's what you prefer, but I figure I'll at least pretend to be a little healthy!  It helps to buy the yeast that actually says "Rapid Rise" on the label, too.

This is an excellent recipe! The end product is moist, light and has a pleasant "yeasty" flavour. I decided to use my Kitchen Aid stand mixer as I didn't want to dig out my bread machine. The result was the best bread I've had in quite some time. It has become my husband's favourite. I increased the serving size to 16 slices to make a good-sized double loaf. I also used olive oil instead of the vegetable oil which worked very well. Highly recommended!

This is my FAVORITE bread machine recipe! I did modify it slightly - I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and added chopped garlic. I also didn't have bread flour, so used unbleached instead, and used regular active dry yeast. As far as directions, I did exactly as the recipe said. It had by far the best texture of any loaf I have ever made in the machine. We WILL be making this again - maybe tomorrow!

Perfect sandwich bread! The texture of this bread is exactly what I've been looking for - soft and chewy on the inside with a crispy (but not too crispy) crust. It also seems to stay fresh for several days after making it. I have been making 1-2 loaves a week for my family of 5 and I'm not getting tired of it. I do like to make a few changes: I like to substitute 1 cup of bread flour for whole wheat flour and I add 1-2 tbsp of cracked wheat for some texture. And like another reviewer suggested, I add 1 1/2 tsp of salt. I also prefer to only use my bread machine to make the dough. Then I transfer the dough to a greased bread pan and let rise until it's above the edge of the pan (it will rise a bit more in the oven).  Baking at 375 degrees for 20 minutes, turning the pan, then baking another 10 minutes will give you a perfectly golden, brown crust. I have also made this recipe as written. Both are delicious!

Excellent white bread recipe.  The only thing I would change would be to bake it using the light crust option rather than medium.  It came out beautifully....just like my crust on sandwich bread lighter.  It held up very well to our BLTs.  I'll do this one again.  Thanks!

Tasted excellent! My third loaf is in the machine now. This time I tried adding a little vinegar to make the bread stay fresh a little longer, hope it helps.

This is the easiest recipe and comes out great. I will throw the ingredients into the machine a couple of hours before dinner and serve it hot. I brought some into work and told everyone how easy it was to make. After that a couple of the guys went out a bought a machine just to make this recipe.

With so many positive reviews, you'd think that there was something very special about this simple recipe...well, there is.  It is the best loaf that ever came out of my bread machine.  I followed the recipe, but made the following changes:  Swap out 2/3 of the white flour for local milled whole wheat flour, and used 1 1/4 tsp of sea salt instead of the 1 tsp of table salt.  I used a Panasonic bread machine on the XL setting, rapid bake, with the 'light' crust setting.  It took about 1:45 mins to base and the bread came out so perfect that it's difficult to describe just how good it was.  5 mins out of the bread machine I cut several THICK slices (difficult to cut because it is such an airy loaf), covered them with fresh butter and raw honey and delivered them around the house to my family.  There was much rejoicing.

Outstanding. I used the dough cycle and then shaped and placed in a 9"x5" greased bread pan to raise again and then to bake, at 350 degrees for 35 minutes.  I did substitute an equal amout of honey for the sugar and added 2 T of vital wheat qluten. The bread is perfection. Thanks for sharing.

This bread was delicious! I followed the directions to a T except I added the additional 1/2 tsp of salt that one person recommended. I made this to go along with homemade beef stew and I made a honey butter to go along with the bread. The loaf was nearly gone before supper! lol I had to swat hands trying to sneak it all or it would have been gone! My hubby and kids and I thought it was great. Can't wait to make it again. Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this a few times. It's incredibly easy to throw together and have a loaf of fresh-baked bread waiting for you in a few hours. Sometimes I'll put this together on a whim on a Saturday night to have fresh bread ready for french toast on Sunday morning. The loaf turns out perfectly!

Just wanted to add my two cents. This is just a great way to make excellent bread. I've used plain flour, bread flour, plain yeast, bread machine yeast and all came out terrific. The only changes I made are salt 1-1/2 tsp and sugar to 3 TBS (just personal taste). Anyone can make this and be a family kitchen hero. Thank you Shecooks2!

Wonderful basic bread - I used coarse salt - turned out better than expected as bread machine recipies can be hit or miss. Slices easily and toasts great - Definitely a repeat! thank you for sharing.

Very good recipe. Easy to follow and hard to mess-up. I've made this recipe about 40 times and it has always turned out well. I've even substituted half the flour for white whole wheat flour and it still turns out very good (just add a couple of teaspoons of vital wheat gluten to help the whole wheat rise).

I know someone wrote that they had good results substituting the flour with all whole wheat. I've had poor results trying to use all whole wheat with this recipe. I bake often with whole grains, so I'm familiar with it, and I would not recommend using all whole wheat flour. You can usually get away substituting about 50% with almost any recipe.

This has been the best loaf so far for my wife's sandwiches.  I use half bread flour and half whole wheat.  I also add flax seeds, wheat germ, pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds. Still the lightest and fluffiest.

I made this bread last night, and just put on a second batch tonight. I can't believe I ever bought packaged machine Breads in the past, This is easy, cheap to make and turned out "Perfect". I did add the added salt as suggested. I will make this weekly for the family and try to stay away from it so I dont gain 100 lbs... YUMMIE

I have had my bread machine for over 15 years when we got married. When we first got it, we tried the recipes that came with the machine, and the bread always turned out horrible - rocky hard. We haven't used the machine since, until now when I discovered this recipe!

The first time I made this recipe, I followed other's suggestion of adding 1.5 tsp salt. The bread came out really soft, light and fluffy! The second time I made some additional modifications: used half whole wheat flour and half bread flour, added 3/4 cup raisins, and 1.5 tsp cinnamon, substituted water with milk. The loaf came out a little denser than the white bread due to the whole wheat flour, but it was still delicious! My husband and my kids loved my breads! My third loaf is now being baked as I'm typing!

Tried exactly as written first & it was great. Just a little 'airy' at the top. So adjusted sugar to 3T for proofing, increased salt, used 2 1/2 c bread flour & 1/2 c wheat, added powdered milk & used olive oil instead. After 3 or 4 loaves have reduced setting to 1 1/2 lb. Now we still get the HUGE loaves just a more tender less baked crust. This is now my family's fav & no more store bought bread in our house.

My favorite basic bread recipe so far for my machine!  I use olive oil, and sometimes substitute whole wheat flour for 2 of the 3 cups of bread flour.  I'm always happy with it.

Best bread I've made by a recipe (meaning not from a box) in my bread machine! I finally came across the best recipe thus far! Thank you so much! My family enjoyed the bread. We've had a problem with the bread being too dense, not tasty, hard as a rock....until now! I will definitely use this recipe again! I will state that I used 1.5 tsp of salt like one of the previous reviews suggested. You can't go wrong with this recipe!

This was my first bread machine attempt. Good, basic bread. Super easy. I followed a tipster's advice by adding the xtra .5 t salt...turned out perfect in consistency, and decent taste. Looking for something with a little more flavor for and "aah" factor, though. If I compared the taste to a commercial brand...probably Whitewheat.

The best and easiest machine bread I've ever made!  I used 2 cups bread flour and 1 cup whole wheat with no other modifications and it turned out PERFECT!

This is by far the best recipe I have come across for a simple white bread. I followed all the other recipes from my bread machine, but it was never this good. I would like to say though for people who have issues with it being too "airy"...the recipe calls for .25 ounce which is about 1.5 tsp. I have noticed that the packets are bigger than 1.5 tsp. This is how much I have been using (1.5 tsp), and it's perfect consistency everytime.

Wow, just made this bread today-exactly as mentioned except I used ICYBLUEROSE advice of adding the extra 1/2 teaspoon salt. My bread came out great! yay. I was so worried about the order of ingredients too-but it came out just fine.

I totally agree with phlipj and lily because I  have my bread machine for 4 yrs and those recipes that I tried was failed too, except this one. It came out  so soft, so tasty and so .......Today is my 3rd loaf within this week and I made 2 lbs bread.  I used 4 cups AP flour,
1.5 tsp salt, 2 tsp bread machine yeast, 1 and 1/4 cups of warm water, sugar and oil still the same. I will keep on making this.  Thanks.

I LOVE this bread! The only changes I make (which I don't think change the taste/texture of the original recipe-- which I have also made-- is:
canola oil instead of vegetable oil
2 1/2 c. bread flour + 1/2 c. whole wheat flour
1 1/2 tsp. salt

LOVE this bread!! Thank you so much for the recipe! I have tried others, and this is the best! THANKS :)

I followed this recipe with one change: the addition of one TBSP of vital wheat gluten. My photo speaks for itself. My family didn't even wait for the loaf to cool. By the time I was able to take a picture, not much was left of it. It was great, and I will make it again - probably tonight.

5 stars cos it beats any recipe by the bread machine companies.  Can't understand how these big companies with their professional cooks & labs can't even give a easy workable recipe. All the breads I have made turn out dense like bricks as another reviewer said, only barely edible if eaten immediately. This loaf on first try turned out a lovely high domed loaf shape with a suitably soft texture. So happy that I can finally make full use of my bread maker instead of just making dough. Thank you so much for this simple & easy recipe!

This is the best bread recipe that I have found. I will probably never make another loaf the "machine directed" way again. I felt that all of the raters/users before made excellent suggestions and applied them to my bread making as well. Add 1/2 tsp more of salt - used honey instead of sugar, substituted a little wheat for white. I made the dough in my bread machine, pulled it out and let it rise another 30 - 60 minutes. IT was so HUGE. I had never had dough rise like that. And when I baked it I put it in my oven with a pan of water at the bottom. The end result was sweet, soft and perfect. Thank you to all who commented - it helps us new-bee's out on changing up our recipes!!!

If you want a nice rounded loaf with even "air bubbles" throughout check the dough after 10 minutes of first neading. if the dough ball is smooth and elastic it is just right ( try to pull a small piece off - it should spring back) if the dough is lumpy add a SMALL amount of water about a teaspoon and check again in 5 minutes. If the ball is soupy or sticky ( it should not sick to the sides of the pan)add a SMALL amount of flour about a teaspoon and check again in 5 minutes.  Works every time!!

This was my first time baking bread in my bread machine and this recipe was very simple. It turned out tasty. Flaky crust and moist on the inside. The only thing is that I should have read the recommendations and added more salt -- it did indeed fall in the middle! Next time I will make note of that.

I tried this recipe even though it goes against the instructions of my bread machine and it made the best bread!! I think pre-proofing the yeast makes a huge difference, though my bread machine instructions say to not let the yeast come in contact with liquids when adding ingredients. The bread rose beautifully and is light and fluffy. This is definitely my new white bread recipe!

This was going to be my last attempt at making bread in my mom's ancient bread machine.  I had used it so many times and got such odd results I was sure the machine was "toast". This recipe is perfect!! I did increase the salt to 1.5 tsp and it was fantastic! THANKS!!!

I prepared this with my KitchenAid and oven instead of using a bread machine. It was delicious. I doubled the recipe and accidently let the yeast proof for about 30 minutes instead of the recommended 10. I think that turned out well.

Great reciepe! I took the advice about the salt and the bread came out better. I also had problems with the bread falling apart and couldn't figure out why and now I know. One package of the yeast and 1.5 teaspoon of salt.

This bread turned out great!!  I have been looking for a fluffy sandwich bread for my husbands lunch, this is perfect.  I used olive oil, (since our trip to Italy, I try to use olive oil as much as possible.) and 1 1/2 tsp of salt.  I will make this again and again.  Thanks!!

I loved this recipe.  I made it with a little more fibre.  I substituted the 3 cups of flour, with 1 1/2 cups unbleached flour, 1 cup whole wheat flour, and 1/2 cup raw bran.  I also used 1.5 tsp salt. The bread is amazing.

i just made this, this morning it was very good, and smelt wonderful. Next time i will put half the amount of white flour and use some whole wheat, for even more flavor. ( i feel too guilty eating white bread ) :)

made this with AP flour and regular yeast and followed directions to a T.  Bread was light and fluffy.  Crust was crunchy and golden brown.  Making another loaf on Raptd cycle and will see how that comes out.

I thought this tasted a little bland.  The loaf did bake up nicely and had good texture.  Need to find a better tasting recipe than this one.

After trying this recipe for bread, I liked it so much I decided to try it with rolls for a New Year's Eve dinner. I used the dough cycle and increased the sugar to 3 table spoons, when the dough cycle was finished, I rolled out 1 oz. pieces and lined them in a buttered glass baking dish, about one inch apart. I put a cloth towel over it and put them in the microwave with it off for a hour just so they rise again. Then baked them on 375 for 20 minutes. Took them out and brushed melted butter over them, and baked them for 10 more minutes. They were the best rolls I have ever eaten. My guests couldn't stop eating them. All I heard all night was how good the rolls were.

The family just got a new bread machine, and being new daughter in law, I wanted to impress. I never used a bread machine for real before, and it worked out beatuifully! But of course I added my own twist. Instead of the 2T of sugar, I added 1T of sugar and alittle more than a 1T of honey. And I replaced the oil with butter, and added a 1T of extra butter, so, 5T of butter. It came out so nice and soft and delicate! My inlaws were raving!! butter is always better! :)

I don't usually alter recipes too much, I like to try them as they are written so I can get a feel for the cook that has shared it and also so I can give a fair review. However, our family prefers brown breads, so I used 1 cup whole wheat flour & 2 cups white. I didn't go all wheat because I am a novice bread maker and not comfortable yet with making too many changes. Bottom line; who wants to ruin a loaf of bread, right? I added ingreadients in the exact order listed and let it cook! It was really yummy with a very crispy crust, but not dry and that was on the medium crust setting for my machine. We used it for our after Thanksgiving turkey sandwiches. Winner! Very delish! For anyone new to this, I suggest waiting for it cool before slicing. We were so excited we sliced it just a few minutes out of the machine! It was great, but difficult to slice hot. I think I will give it an hour of cooling time before attempting slicing the loaf that is cooking now. I will also try this recipe in a loaf pan, in the oven as well. Oh, and I added 3 Tbsp of roasted flax seeds this time, also. Thanks for such a great recipe, easy & taste's great :)

The best bread machine recipe ever!  I tried this several times removing the dough before the last rise and putting it in my own bread pans like I have always had to do because I really have not had any luck using the bread machine for the entire process.  Since this recipe produces such a nice loaf I thought today I would try and leave it to bake in the bread machine and low and behold it still bakes perfectly, the only thing I changed was adding 1 more tsp of salt.

the previous review by KIMALLI1 pretty much describes my experience with this recipe. brand new yeast, no rise, lumpy, dense, crunchy crust, and no idea why I followed every direction. This was my first experience using the bread machine so i hope i find a better one so i can continue to use it. it smelled pretty good though!

I normally don't use my bread machine, except to make the bagels on this site. I have never liked bread machine bread...until now! I upped the salt to 1.5 tsp, and since I had run out of oil, I used a couple of Tbs. (or thereabouts)of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter. This is to die for. The crust was so light and flaky, and the bread so moist. I can hardly believe it came from my machine. Now after 10 years of marriage I will put it to more use.

I almost freecycled my bread machine 2 weeks ago.  But, just recently, I lost my job and thought to myself, "Self, give one more go!  If it doesn't do anything THEN you can freecycle it!"  So I did.  The loaf was TERRIBLE.  However, after realizing that it might be the yeast that was the problem, I proofed the yeast and... that was it.  Off I went to buy more yeast.   Can I just say WOW?  I mean, this recipe saved my bread machines life.  The crust was fantastic, the flavor--unbelievable and it was so easy to do, it was close to sinful!  I followed this recipe to an exact T except.... I used 2.25 cups of WHITE flour and .75 cups of whole wheat flower.  The result?  I may never buy bread from a store again.   Thank you for this recipe.  You have saved me time, money and flavor!

When my 6 year old eats half the loaf I have to give it 5 stars.  I did follow the advise of others and added 1.5 tea salt.  It is the best bread recipe I have found and I have been cooking bread for 15 years. Soft with a flaky crust just like they said. Thank you Diggetydog so much.

This is AMAZING!!! The bread is so soft and the texture is PERFECT! I used all whole wheat flour, unsweetened applesauce instead of the oil, and I also took IcyBlueRose's advice about increasing the yeast and salt. I made the dough in the breadmaker, but baked it in the oven. I doubled the recipe and it made two of the best loaves of bread I have ever tasted. Give this a try! You won't regret it! (and you probably won't buy storebought bread ever again)

Years ago when the bread machines just came out my grandpa use to make bread all the time and I really wish he had this recipe.  This was my first attempt at making bread with a bread maker and even though this recipe goes against what the bread machine instructions say, dont worry about it!!  This bread is perfect.  Only thing I did differently than the original instructions was put 1/2 teaspoon more of salt.  Fantastic!

Great recipe! I used about 3 Tbsp. canola oil & 1 Tbsp. olive oil, and upped the salt to 1.5 tsp. as recommended by others. I'm not sure if there's a difference between "bread machine flour" & bread flour - but I just used the bread flour as usual. I also just used 1 packet of regular yeast. So, SO delicious! The crust is beautifully crunchy, and the inside is fluffy & soft! Also, it smelled DIVINE while baking.

This is the only recipe I use, I have tried a lot of bread machine breads, both shaped and baked in the oven and in the bread machine.  I make this bread on dough setting (if you don't have that control, just use your regular control), I let it finish the kneading for me, then I take it out, let it rise until double in size in an lightly oiled/buttered bowl.  I then punch it down, shape it into a loaf of bread, dinner rolls, or cinnamen rolls. Let them rise till double in size, bake in a 350 degree oven for 30-35 min.  When you take out your bread dump it on a bread board, tap the bottom if it sounds hollow then  your bread is done.  I like not having to make sure that I don't have to be careful with the yeast.

Absolutely the best bread ever out of a machine.  I will never buy the box mixes again.  I used regular packaged yeast and increased the salt by 1/2 tsp as recommended by another contributor.  This one will stay at the top of my recipe box

this was excellent sandwich bread.  I did use 1 1/2 tsp of salk as some reviewers recommended.  As soon as it was cool, I sliced the whole loaf and made my son's sandwiches for the week. I got 5 sandwiches out of the loaf, which I froze (PB and J) and he loved them in his lunch.  I love when I make that stuff ahead of time!!

I have never had success with my bread machine but this recipe changed my mind about my bread machine.  I have had it for years and had given up on making bread with it.  I did add the 1/2 tsp of salt as one of the others suggested and it turned out great.  Thank you for this recipe.  Update 12/24/2008  I made this bread dough in my machine and then transferred it to the bread pan and baked in the oven.  It turned out perfect and it rose perfectly.  UPDATE:  I had to add a picture of this bread.  It is a great recipe and I have to use my bread machine all the time now.

Every bread recipe that I had used made hard crusty bread, but this one came out perfect! I've been making it a lot lately. I wrote out the ingredients on a post-it note, and I keep it on my bread maker.

wonderful bread. My husband just requested it again for the third time. Has such a wonderful texture and smell. I went ahead and took the suggestions and used 1 1/2tsp salt, 3tbl sugar, and only 2 tsp yeast.

Excellent bread! I followed the recipe exactly except I proofed the yeast before adding it to my machine. This recipe is really foolproof, it turned out great. Very nice top crust, and wonderful soft texture inside. I baked it in my bread machine on regular cycle, and turned out nice. But next time I may do the dough in the machine and bake it in my oven for a softer crust. My bread machine makes a too thick of a crust. I have solved the hard crust problem with putting the loaf in a plastic zip bag as soon as it comes out of the oven. The steam softens the crust and leaves the inside the same. Super yummy recipe!

This is absolutely the best bread machine recipe that I've ever had! Thank you so much! It was emailed to me by my sister. I used the ingredients and the measurements that were given, however I followed the manufacturer's instructions and put the ingredients in the order that they suggested, and kept the yeast separate. I also only used the dough cycle on my bread machine, and placed the dough in a greased loaf pan, let it rise, and bake it at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes. My bread turned out with a beautiful color, very light and fluffy, and absolutely perfect! Thanks again, this is an awesome recipe and I would recommend it to anyone.

I am a traditional person and have hated bread machines for years.  Preferring to bake my bread the old fashioned way.  I got a new machine and today I tried this recipe.  Ok, from a die-hard traditionalist I must say this is the BEST bread machine bread I have ever tried!  It is so close to the "real" thing.  Thank you so much for this one.  Got any more?  :)

Because of this recipe, there is no more store bought bread in our home! I made it “as is” and it was great. To add some fiber in our diets, I made the following modifications: used 3 tablespoons sugar, 2 teaspoons bread machine yeast, 1 cup whole wheat flour, 2 cups bread flour and followed the remainder of the recipe as stated. I use canola oil and have no oil taste that I can discern. I’ve tried the “Express Bake” function and it turned out nicely, but I recommend the “White” or “Basic” setting with a light crust.

I made this bread yesterday in my old Oster bread machine.  It came out looking like real bread!  I was happy with this recipe as is, it worked GREAT!!  I can't say enough about this.

having read some excellent reviews and a couple not so good i decided to give it ago- albiet a bit uneasy about how it would work- it did and it worked beautifully. I took everyones advice and i added almost 2 tsp salt and i added one tablespoon extra of flour and I have no idea if any of these made a difference but the loaf was fluffy and light.

I have been making bread in my bread machine for over 20 years and this is the best, by far.  It is tasty, easy to put together, takes few ingredients and is less expensive than my original recipe. I used only 1T of sugar instead of 2T.  Worked out just as if I used the 2T.  This recipe is, as Martha says, "A Good Thing".

I love this recipe. It has the best crust of any bread machine bread recipe I've tried ever. My mother-in-law was here last year when I made this and she took the recipe back to England when she went home and converted it to metric. She makes it all the time now.

Great recipe and really easy. I did a couple of the modifications that Bermyrose suggested 2 tsp yeast and 1.5 tsp salt.  I also like to bake it in the oven after I let the bread machine do all of the hard work.

Very good - nice light texture, just too small for my 2 1/2 pound bread machine... will double recipe next time.   Also to tame the yeast from rising too much, some readers said they increased the salt by half teaspoon  - I did that AND I used regular butter to enhance the flavor as some other readers suggested... I WARN you NOT to use the two together: the bread tasted WAY too salty.  Either decrease the yeast by half teaspoon & used regular butter OR increase the salt & use either unsalted butter or vegetable oil.  But all in all, IT WAS AWESOME & A KEEPER!

Absolutely the best bread machine recipe that I have tried.  This recipe produces a soft crust and a dense bread that is good even the next day.  I use 3 tablespoons of sugar and 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt.  Yummy!

Got a new bread machine for Christmas, and after two failed loaves (not this recipe), I decided to try this recipe. I have to admit, I was leary of mixing the yeast, water and sugar in the bottom of the loaf pan - this was contrary to the generic recipe instructions included with my machine. Followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out GREAT! It rose perfectly, crust and crumb were great as well. Thank you so much for this unorthodox but great recipe. I am looking forward to modifying it and using part whole wheat flour and honey instead of the sugar.

I make this bread all the time and modify it when I feel like it by adding things to it. The last additions I made were to substitute a cup of Bass Ale for the water and brown sugar for white. It is a very versatile recipe. Thanks.

We make this bread 2 times a week.  I set the bread machine on dough setting and turn it out on a floured counter, fold a couple times and set it on a cookie sheet for 40 min to rise, preheat the oven at 350 for 15 min, it's the best.

This recipe is very easy and it works beautifully, even for a novice bread machine user (this was the second bread machine loaf I made). I used the scaling and metric features to change the recipe to make a 1 pound loaf. I used olive oil and followed the directions. The bread came out exactly as promised - soft, with a nice crust, and a delicious sweet smell, not yeasty at all. It is not too sweet. Perfect.

This is so easy and my 4 year old loves it!  I didn't have bread flour, so I used 1 C of whole wheat (sneak in something healthier) and 2 C of unbleached flour.  It just worked easily and it is something I will do again and again and again.

This is a great recipe! I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 2 cups of all-purpose flour (I was out of bread flour), and it turned out really good. I also used 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt as others had suggested.  Nice and soft- not crumbly. I will make it again.

I made this bread yesterday, and it was very good.  I am only giving it 3 stars because it did not rise very much!  The loaf didn't come close to filling the bread pan... I am trying it again tonight to re-test - alot of factors can cause bread to not turn out, so I will post the results.  The bread itself is very good - moist and chewy.  Worth a shot.

Usually when I try a new recipe it is a success the first time only. I have made this one about 30 times now, and it is successful every time. I have to add that it does not have a chance to get cold - eaten within 15 minutes of taking out of the machine. We just love it!

This recipe makes a beautiful 1.5lb loaf. I've followed suggestions of other reviewers: 2tsp yeast, 1.5 tsp salt, olive oil instead of vegetable oil. (Set the 1/4 cup of oil in a pan of warm water, to warm it.) I use a different mix of flours each time, and it's always good. I add 1Tbsp of flax seeds at the "mix-ins" beep. To test the temperature of the water, I use an extra fever thermometer, held under running water until I get the temp right.

This recipe is now one of my favorites and it IS my husband's favorite. I made several loaves over Christmas to give as gifts and made several for our own family. Everyone loved it. Time and time again this recipe has been consistent. It has a good flavor, holds together well and cuts very nicely. Makes a very good sandwich bread. This is a keeper.

This really IS the best! I follow the recipe to a "t" and it comes out perfect every time. This bread makes great toast (I like mine sliced thin) and is perfect for fondue because it holds up to the cheese very well and doesn't leave crumbs in the fondue pot.

Fantastic, no-fail recipe.  Very easy to make.  Crust is softer on the bottom than most bread machine breads, which is definitely a plus.  Great for sandwiches, or as toast for dinner or breakfast.  My experience w/ this recipe is that it does stale rather quickly.  By the second day, it is just as any biscuits or anything you would make---just not very fresh tasting, but still suitable for toast, croutons, or making bread crumbs.  I make this recipe about 4-5 times weekly.  A keeper!!!

Tasty and delicious! Boyfriend ate the entire first loaf. Added black pepper and oregano for a more savory second try. Can't wait to give the whole wheat bread flour a try.

I tried this last night in my Sunbeam bread machine and it came out great. I was very happy with this recipe, as I saw someone else suggest, I increased the salt to 1.5 tsp. I used 2.25 teaspoons of bread machine yeast. The loaf rose up high and most importantly it didn't fall in the middle like so many 1.5 lb recipes seem to do in this machine. It tastes great, has a nice crust, a soft crumb, and makes wonderful toast. This is a keeper.

After developing arthritis several years ago I broke down and submitted to a bread machine for making my dough.  This classic french bread recipe is great but since I only use all purpose flour, I reduce to 2½ C and I've only ever used 1 tsp of sugar.  I shape it and let it rise 45 minutes before baking in the oven.  If I use quick rise yeast I simply put it on top of all the other ingredients... and use a rapid setting if using the machine to bake it.

This recipe lives up to its name!  I have never *ever* gotten my machine to make a loaf anywhere *near* this soft, moist, light, and perfect.

I followed the directions, but added 2 tablespoons of dried milk (as my machine's recipe indicates).  Also, I took a chance on another reviewer's suggestion, and used only the dough cycle (even though it doesn't kneed the dough twice as it would had I used the quick bread or white bread cycles), then transfered the dough to a buttered loaf pan for 30 minutes in a 375 oven.  

Again, perfect!  Mahalo nui loa!!!

I followed the recipe to a "T" and ended up with fluffy bread but it tasted like sugar and yeast. It wasn't the worst bread I've ever had but I won't make it again. Still searching for the perfect white bread recipe.

This was pretty good.  I don't know if it was my bread machine, but even though I set the crust on "Light," I had a really dark and thick crust.  Also, it was stale almost from taking it out of the machine.  It had good flavor and texture inside, but I think I'll look for a different recipe to make all the time.  Thanks for the recipe, Karen.

This bread is so awesome!  I have NEVER before made bread in my machine with a soft crust!  I have a group of farm hands that comes in the house every morning for lunch and they all love homemade bread.  They all ask now if this is the "new soft bread" when I put it on the table.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe with us!  ***I wrote my rating before reading the other reviews.  I can't believe people didn't like this recipe.  I had no problem with it rising or browning.  I have also made sandwiches with it and had no problem with it falling apart or drying out.  I get a tall, soft, golden loaf every time and it disappears as fast as I make it.  (Maybe that's why mine doesn't dry out!) :)  Thanks again for a great recipe!

After reading all the rave reviews I was anxious to give this recipe a try, what a disappointment!  The bread was very grainy & dry, we actually threw it away.  I would not make this again there are much better options out there than this bland recipe.

Unbelievable, 5 stars! I am the worst bread baker in the world and even I was able to make this recipe turn out! Shazam! I followed the instructions to a "T". The only revision I made was to increase the sugar to 3 TBS. This was a very good bread, nothing fancy but heck, I figure now that it has turned out I can experiment in the future. I appreciate the previous reviewer that said that the .25 oz equals 1 1/2 tsp of yeast. I made sure to use bread maker yeast and flour. I used my candy thermometer to make sure the water was the correct temperature and then I let the water, sugar and yeast sit for 10 minutes in the bottom of the breadmaker. My ancient breadmaker has experienced a rebirth! Whose your carb momma!?!

The best bread recipe I have found to date!  So easy to make.  I followed the instructions to the letter using Gold Medal flour made for bread machines and a packet of FRESH fleishmann's rapid rise yeast.  I think that freshness is important for these ingredients.  My loaf turned out perfect!  Yummy crust and a great texture on the inside!  Two thumbs up, Karen!

This is a great starter for a bread machine recipe.  I added more about 1 teas more sugar and some garlic, italian seasonings, etc.  Just for the taste.  My yeast suggestion is to make sure that you use the full 10 minutes to let the yeast desolve....it really works well.  Also, bread flour has worked every time and I have made it about 6 times now--it has never fallen with bread flour.

Thanks!

Very easy and very soft!  I have baked with this recipe many a time and each time it is wonderful.  It is also a good base recipe to work with and add to - so add rosemary and parmesan or basil and olives to the mix and you have a terrific dinner loaf!

Just to add, I forgot to put in the oil in this last loaf, rose well and tasted like Italian bread, firmer center and hard crust, enjoyed just as well...gotta love this recipe!___Just got a bread machine, saw this recipe, read the reviews and now 3 loaves later (since last night!)I just had to write a review.  This is THE best bread I have ever tried and will look no further. I accidentally put it on the 2 lb setting and it was wonderful!  I think I will keep it like that. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe and thanks to this site for letting us submit our opinions on recipes, I think it's great!

This bread is amazing!!! I cannot believe it came out of my bread maker. Thank you for posting this recipe!!! I have made this two times; once completely as written and a second time with some modifications. While as written it is a fabulous loaf of bread, it makes an enormously tall loaf. So, I scaled it down by 1/3 and used my 1lb loaf setting. This small change made it much easier to slice since it is an extremely soft bread. Now for a few ingredient modifications; I traded out 1/3 of the white flour for whole wheat to give it density and nutrition. I decreased the yeast to 2 tsp as another suggested to  help with structure. I subbed honey for sugar (simply for taste preference) and increased it to 3 TBSP. I used melted coconut oil instead of veg oil because I used the last of the veg oil on the first loaf. I didn't notice a difference in taste, but it's nice to know it doesn't have an adverse affect. I'm sure butter would be delicious too though. Whether you make it as written or try my mods you will not be disappointed. Now, go make yourself a yummy loaf of bread.

I melded this recipe with the "Herb Cheese Bread" recipe by D. Reichel, tweaked, and came out with a perfect loaf of bread. One cup of water, substituted two Tbls of olive oil for the butter. 2 Tbls granulated sugar, and, per another reviewer's recommendations, I added 1 1/2 tsp of salt to be in correct balance with the amount of flour in the recipe. Two Tbls non-fat milk powder, 1 tsp each Rosemary, Thyme, Basil, and Oregano, approx 1/4 c Mozzarella cheese. 3 c. bread flour. 2 1/4 tsp bread machine yeast. Set for basic 1 1/2 lb white w/light crust. PERFECTION!

Followed the recipe and added an extra 1/2 tsp of salt per what others have mentioned.  The bread turned out great!  As a side note, the "most helpful critical review" says to NOT use canola oil.  Not sure what that is all about, I used canola oil and the bread came out perfect and delicious.

Perfect! Very similar to a very old dinner roll recipe my grandmother handed down. I used regular yeast, melted butter instead of oil, and regular flour with a 1/2 teaspoon of gluten added, all because those are the staples I had on hand. I used 1&1/2 teaspoons of salt as recomended below. The results were a soft pillowy high loaf w a slightly crip crust. I made it and ran out to work and on my way out the door my Mom who's visiting called out not to be mad if it's all gone when I return. Best loaf I've ever made.

I started this in my Welbilt machine, after the last kneading I took it out  of the machine. Shaped into loaf and placed in large loaf pan. Allowed it to rise another 40 mins. Baked at 375 degrees about 30 mins.  My family and I loved this bread, it is light and airy.   I added the ingredients as listed in this recipe even though my machine says to do the opposite.  I added 1 T. Softened butter to the oil and increased the salt by 1/2 t.

Seriously, this bread was the most fantastic creation to come out of my bread machine to-date. I swapped bread flour for 2 c. white, 1 c. wheat flour and it still turned out phenomenal. Made grilled cheese sandwiches that would put most restaurants to shame. This is definitely going to be my "everyday" go-to bread recipe.

This bread is amazing. First loaf was not great and it was quite crumbly but thanks to all the comments I learnt using all purpose flour instead of bread flour could be the cause. For the next loaf I used bread flour, honey instead of sugar and 2 tsps of salt turned out amazing. I have been searching for so long trialing so many recipes but they turned out like bricks, I have found the winning recipe and will never use another!

I have a Regal breadmaker and I never could bake any bread that didn't come out like a lumpy doorstop until I found this recipe! I think it must have something to do with putting the yeast in the sugar water first, then flour, then oil. It may have something to do with where I live (deep South) and the high humidity or maybe it is the bread machine. Anyway, after three years of not touching the machine, this recipe has changed all that! I love the smell of baking bread and the simplicity of this recipe. It's a snap and it's fullproof! Now my husband doesn't have to lie and say he likes my bread, he's loving it!

Great recipe! I've made it many times now, and prefer it with the following changes (though it's also great as-is):

2-3 Tbsp Honey instead of sugar

Additional 4 Tbsp warm water

2c whole wheat flour, 1/8c ground flax, 1/8c wheat germ, and 3/4c AP flour (in place of the 3c flour)

I make bread every 2 weeks and this recipe is very good. I did alter the recipe per reviews and I am happy I did. I used olive oil instead of canola oil, used 2 cups bread flour and 1 cup of wheat flour. I did as another reviewer suggested and added the yeast to the water at the bottom of the container initially. This is a keeper!!

I made this bread last night after searching for a recipe that would produce a better, less dense bread in my machine.  Like others, I questioned the idea of: 1) discarding the directions of my bread machine, 2) adding the yeast to the liquids and letting it sit for 10 minutes!  But let me tell you, this bread is gorgeous!  Fluffy, light, beautiful crust!  Plus my 9 year old told me it is better than store bread!  In a time when I am not thrilled with the food industry in general, this recipe gives me the bread my family will love and the piece of mind I crave knowing exactly what I am feeding them.  Thanks so much for sharing this gem!

Excellent taste and texture. Ignore your bread machine's warnings. I've made this several times and it always comes out great, much better than the recipes that came with the machine. I followed the advice of others-increased sugar to 3 Tbl, decreased yeast to 2 tsp. I also replaced 2 Tbl of oil with 2 Tbl melted butter. You should definitely try this recipe!

I have made this numerous times.  I usually double the recipe and replace some of the bread flour for white whole wheat.  I use canola oil too :)
I only use the machine to make the dough.  Then I divide it evenly in two greased loaf pans and set them in the microwave until double in size (30 mins).  Then I bake them 350F for 30 minutes.  AWESOME!!!
 One child came home today and greeted me with "That was good bread"...and now owes her friend bread :)  The other made a sandwich because I only gave him a slice with his lunch today :)

I tried about 4 different bread recipes and they weren't just quite right until I found this one. It's perfect, just soft enough it doesn't fall apart when you cut it, and tastes just as white bread should taste...I make this every week and stopped buying bread!

This bread was tasty. I increased the salt to 1.5 tsp, did not wait the 10 minutes, took it out after the dough cycle, placed it in a loaf pan with a damp towel on it for 30 min. I then baked it at 350° for 30 min.

Used AP flour for first 2 rounds. First go around I forgot the salt. Great texture, weird taste. Second go turned out much better. This 3rd time around using bread flour and putting the salt right beside the machine. Fingers crossed. Fantastic starter recipe. Lots of room to tweak it to your liking. Thank you.

This has been my go-to recipe for years of bread making.  The only thing different is that I add 2 T. dry milk.  I use the bread machine to mix for 1 hour 20 minutes (dough stage), form it into a loaf and let rise until doubled, then  bake it in the 360º oven.     Phyllis

Very nice bread machine bread. Whenever I use the recipes that come with the bread machine, they seem so dense. That's why I sought out a different one. This bread comes out light and fluffy. My husband says he could eat the whole loaf himself. Absolutely delicious!

Love this recipe! I have made it many times, and it always turns out perfectly. The only change I made was to use 1.5 tsp of salt (instead of just 1 tsp). I usually make it on the dough setting in my bread machine, then bake it in the oven. This is definitely my favourite recipe for my bread machine.

I just made this recipe last night. It was the first time making a bread recipe and WOW! This bread came out fantastic! It has a nice crispy crust and very airy texture on the inside...and so moist. I was skeptical because I have never made a bread before (only cinnamon roles - another fav from allrecipes.com - Clone of a Cinabon recipe!) and this recipe asked to dissolve the yeast first. I tried, and the first time didn't trust the yeast and sugar mixture so threw out and tried again. Used the second mixture and poured the rest of the ingredients into the bread machine. Let it cook and what an amazing bread. Will definitely make again...VERY SOON! Toasted next day and was great with some butter. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Excellent recipe, I sub avocado oil (1/3 cup) and honey, molasses or maple syrup for the sugar. Also I will throw in a tbsp or 2 of red river cereal for multigrain, and will throw in half a tbsp of bran for extra Fibre.  Any more than that and you can "tell it's healthy". At our house we're into trickery with healthy things. Avocado oil is available from Costco. It's better for our hair, skin and nails and you can't tell the difference. I take it out of my bread maker to rise in a lightly warmed oven for 20 minutes until more than doubled then leave it in while I turn on the oven to 350. Bake until brown and loaf sounds hollow when you tap it. I get a perfect loaf every time. Also, I use plain, ordinary flour either whole wheat or white, not bread flour and I get perfect bread.

I followed the recipe to a T, so I feel I have the right to review this recipe.  After all, if I had made modifications, then a review wouldn't be appropriate or accurate, right?  ;)

I've been making bread with a bread maker for almost 20 years and this recipe and method is the best basic white bread that has ever come out of my bread maker.  So often, bread from a bread maker is on the heavy side and the bread texture is often times rather heavy.

The bread, using this recipe came out with a delicious flakey crust and a nice and somewhat creamy interior.  It was truly delicious and I don't plan on changing a thing.

Thank you so much, shecooks2.  I have saved this recipe to my recipe cookbook as a permanent fixture.

Very good but I changed it to 1/2 whole wheat, used coconut oil or butter instead or vegetable oil.  It's a good recipe and I'm glad I tried it!

I meant to leave this review a long  time ago. This is one AWESOME bread! Love it. Sometimes I switch out a 1/8C bread flour for potato flour, yum! Also add another 1/2 tsp salt.

Made this today. I changed the recipe by some of the others suggestions. I used 2-1/4 tsp. bread machine yeast, 2-1/2 cups bread flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1-1/2 tsp. salt. Didn't have vegetable oil, so used olive oil. Other than these changes, I followed the recipe exactly. Before the last rising, I quickly took the paddle out, placed the dough back into the pan & back into the bread maker. The bread came out perfect & no big paddle hole in the bottom. (I have an older bread machine & this was the 1st time I tried taking the paddle out) Next time, I'm going to try baking it in the oven for a change. This is definitely a keeper!

Tastes better than it looks but will try it again. I'm disappointed at the size though. Any suggestions?

I just made this bread and it was excellent. I used olive oil rather than vegetable oil and I could taste it (very subtle taste). I also added a bit more salt as recommended by a previous reviewer and it worked. Definitely recommend this recipe.

Excellent! I use 2 1/2 cups white flour and 1/2 cup flax meal. I substitute honey for sugar. Substitute coconut oil for vegetable oil. Add a dash of cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla. Great morning toast and healthy?

Never made bread before so was a lil nervous since this recipe seemed do easy. Honestly it was the easiest recipe I've ever used. The bread turned out amazing! It was perfect. My husband and children loved it.

Best white bread recipe!  I was afraid to add the yeast directly to the water, as the machine strongly discouraged, but I am so glad I did!!  The bread is always light and fluffy and has never fallen or failed to rise. I have added many variations including cheese, onions, etc. and turns out perfect every time. Will never buy a loaf of bread from the store again!!

Day 2 of owning my bread machine, and I have already made two loaves - this being the 2nd. It probably doesn't sound like a lot except my husband is out of town and the first loaf (honey wheat) was consumed by me and my 2 year old. This white bread was delicious - soft inside, flaky crust just as described. It rose so high, it hit the top of my bread machine and could barely fit in my progressive bread box. My son ate a slice even before was a fully cooled and asked for 2 more slices before he went to bed. I will definitely make this bread again. Now I question why it took me so long to get a bread machine. Thanks, SheCooks2

I've made this bread 3 times this week since coming across the recipe for my hubbie, 2 year old, and myself, and we aren't the 'bread with every dinner, sandwich every day for lunch' type of people-it's so good!  I make it exactly as the recipe says, using either olive oil or vegetable oil, although I may try butter next time to see how it turns out.  I have been making bread for a long time, but not so long that I was turned away by the mixing method.  I make the dough in my machine then put it in a 9x5 pan (the Gold ones from Williams-Sonoma are fantastic), let it rise again then bake at 350.  Even the first loaf I made that I forgot to let rise turned out pretty well, just more dense.  Can't go wrong with this recipe.

I decided I was going to buy a bread machine and start making our own bread.  I researched and purchased a very expensive machine that was supposed to be as "easy as adding the ingredients." This recipe went against every recipe I have tried and the manufactor's strict warnings.   I figured, though, not one of those recipes had worked so I would try this one.  I made a promise to myself that if this loaf of bread did not turn out, I was taking the machine to the Goodwill.  I was so tired of the disappointment of taking the loaf out and having it be HARD as a rock.  

I wanted to let anyone know that this recipe is easy, restores your confidence, and works perfectly.  Thank you so much! I am going to throw out all those other recipes and just use this one. I followed the directions to the exact specifications and it was PERFECT.

My bread machine also instructs users to prevent the yeast from coming in contact with water prior to mixing and kneading. I, however, followed the recipe as written (aside from adding an extra half teaspoon of salt). The temperature of the water is very important too. This recipe was so easy. I set the bread machine as directed and left it alone. My family loved it on its own, plain! The outside was crusty but the inside was heavenly soft and delicious!

Great recipe. It's our go-to recipe and we've gone through at least 25 lbs flour using it and our bread machine.

I like to weight ingredients, and here are the gram equivalents, in the order we add them to the machine:

1 Cup Water (236G)
1/4 Cup Vegetable Oil (56G)
1 Tsp Salt (4.2G)
2 Tbsp Sugar (16G)
3 Cups Flour (384G All Purpose or 408G Bread)
1/4 Oz Yeast (7g)

Enjoy!

Excellent bread!  I went completely rebellious and just dumped everything into my bread machine without waiting for the yeast to foam and it still came out perfectly.  Seemed much less dense & tasted better, must be the oil instead of the butter my bread machine's recipe book recommends.  I've found my new staple...very happy!!

This recipe is amazing!  I love it.  When I first started making it in my bread maker, the loaves were kind of compact, but still good.  I made this bread for several weeks before I made a discovery.  If you use 1 cup of warm milk (110 degrees) instead of water, the bread loaf will be almost twice the size.  I don't use bread machine yeast, just regular yeast.  However, I do use bread flour.  The loaf made with milk was lighter, had an even better flavor and produced far fewer crumbs than the loaf made with water.  My family ate the entire loaf within two hours.  This recipe will definitely be a staple in our house.

I have had my bread machine many years and this has to be the easiest, best bread ever.  I have now quit buying bread altogether.  Now, I do use a more nutritious wheat bread flour so I increase the water to 1 1/3 cups and since we don't use processed white sugar I use 3 tbsp honey.  Perfection!

Nothing compares to this bread.  I live in Europe and I would rather eat this bread than the bread from the local boulangerie!!!!  I was very skeptical about putting the ingredients in the wrong order, but it works perfect every single time!  I added 1/2t salt and I do half whole wheat, half bread flour.  I make 2 loaves every weekend for us to use for sandwiches and toast throughout the week.  Amazing and truly the BEST bread machine bread!

Worst bread machine recipe I've ever made -- and this wasn't my first rodeo. Followed directions and didn't change a thing. Bread fell flat and was dense in the middle. Won't be making this one again.

While I have no problems with the rise, density and texture of this bread using my Breadman TR2700, I found it to be quite bland when compared to other machine and hand-made breads. I made the recipe exactly as directed, but I believe it needs more salt and possibly a little more sugar to be a five-star recipe. If you like to eat bread without loading it down with spread, you'll want to beef up the flavor; I will probably make this again, but I will definitely modify it.

I have made this many times now and it never fails to impress. I let the yeast rise for more like 30 minutes now and it makes for an even fluffier bread. This is definitely a keeper.

I love this recipe. I made a few changes. One, I can't seem to follow a recipe as written to save my life. Two, I am not a fan of white bread. I sub one cup of the bread flour for organic whole wheat flour. I add one tablespoon of gluten. I up my yeast to 2 1/2 teaspoons. If I want honey wheat bread, I add 1/3 cup of honey. This bread rises so well, no big air pockets, and the entire family enjoys it.

This is the best bread machine recipe I've tried! 
I like to do a slight variation by adding some chopped walnuts, a tablespoon more of the sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract to make it extra yummy for the kids. 

I also found grapeseed oil is the best for a light bread such as this one. 100% failproof and 200% delicious!

I admit I was a little nervous to go against my bread makers suggested order of ingredients, but this bread turned out fantastic!!!  I used whole wheat bread flour and canola oil and it worked very well.  I followed these instructions to a T (used basic setting instead of whole wheat)  I also used the 1.5 loaf setting and medium darkness.  Next time I will choose light.

great recipe!! I followed the advice from previous members and added 1 1/2 teaspoons of quick yeast to the recipe, cooked it in the oven after I used the "dough" cycle on my machine, for 23 minutes at 350F. It was beautiful! I topped it with melted butter, YUM! I will be saving this one.

Just wanted to share the 100% whole wheat version: I used 3 tablespoons of raw honey instead of sugar-- 2 cups of stone ground  whole wheat flour -- One cup of white whole wheat flour --  and 3 tablespoons of vital wheat gluten. That would be 1 tablespoon per 1 cup of whole wheat flour. when I add my wet ingredients and my yeast I allow them to sit for 10 minutes to activate the east. Then I add my one cup of whole wheat flour mix and allowed to sit for 20 minutes. Then add the rest of the ingredients with a little more warm water.  make sure the dough is mixed but not too sticky.  Continue following the recipe stated above. I make three loaves every week and it turns out perfect every time.

Best homemade bread ever. Kids make me bake this at leasrt once a week and eat the whole loaf in one sitting. I also add the extra bit of salt. I also use melted butter instead of oil. Sometimes I also add some honey. This recipe makes a 1.5 lb loaf.

Excellent recipe.  The recipe tends to over-proof in the bread machine, even with 1 1/2 tsp of salt. Over-proofing results in a loaf that doesn't rise (or may even collapse) during the bake cycle. I add 1 tablespoons of vital wheat gluten (70%) for a more chewy texture.

I get best results using the dough cycle on my machine and baking the loaf in the oven.   After using dough cycle, I gently knead to remove air pockets and shape the loaf (on a floured surface to prevent sticking).  I put the loaf in a greased pan, score the top of the loaf and lightly brush with melted butter (oil is also fine, just doesn't have the same flavour).  I cover the pan, leave it in a warm spot for 25 minutes and then bake at 350 for 35 to 40 minutes.  The loaf will rise considerably in the first 15 minutes of baking.  

If I use the bread machine for the entire process, I stop the second raising cycle 10 minutes early and then use the bake cycle.

It is so versatile! I do it plain, with raisins and cinnamon, with thyme, parsley, and onion powder, with bacon crumbles and bacon fat sub for the oil... It is great every time!

I've made this about 10 times now and our family LOVES this bread! It is simple enough that I, an absolute non-baker, can make it without even thinking about it anymore. Which means it lives up to its description- foolproof! I usually make it exactly as written, but I have tried subbing in 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and it was also delicious that way as well. I prefer to set the machine to basic with light crust. Thank you!

I made this the exact way it says and it came out amazing! I had never usedmy bread machine before this was a first time for me. So easy and really good. I cut the bread kind of thick and used it for sausage and peppers. My super picky fiance loved it!! 

( I tried to put 5 stars but my computer is being weird)

With only 2 T sugar and no milk or eggs, this is the perfect recipe for my diabetic granddaughter and vegan in-laws.  My husband's eyes lit up and he said it was the best bread I have ever made! I didn't have bread flour, bread machine yeast, or vegetable oil so I used sifted all-purpose flour, regular yeast, and canola oil.  I set the bread machine to the dough setting.  When done, I divided the dough into 4 equal portions, put each portion into a mini-loaf pan, let rise for about 30 minutes, then baked in a 350 oven for 20-25 minutes.  The second batch (2 batches in 1 day!) i substituted 2T honey for the sugar and whole wheat flour for 1/2 of the white flour.  It was just as good. The third version I used the 2 T homey, 1 2/3 c. sifted all-purpose flour, 1/3 c. quick-cooking oats, and 1 c. whole wheat flour.  Turned out perfect again!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!!!

Used olive oil instead of vegetable and had no problems. Easy and tasty.. oh and I didn't do the first step as directed. I added the liquid first, then the dry ingredients as my bread machine directed.

Wow. So simple and so good.  I have a old Sunbeam 1.5lb breadmachine. Followed the directions, putting the water, sugar and yeast in first.   Used 1 active dry yeast packet which is 1/4oz or 7 grams.  Increased the salt to 1.5 teaspoons, I did use Kosher salt.  Towards the end of the final mixing, when my machine beeped, I added some chopped garlic, basil, oregano and parmasean cheese, all room temperature.  

The result was an amazing loaf of crusty italian bread.  Yummy!

I initially tried a different white bread recipe and that failed horribly so I decided to try this one.  My bread came out perfectly.  I took the recommendation of adding 1/2 tsp more salt and also added 1Tbsp of wheat gluten.  The bread rose beautifully with a nice crust and very soft inside.  I would use it for making sandwiches and to serve with dinner.

I've made this so many times over the years I couldn't tell you. Delicious. It's a delicate bread, so not good for sandwiches. I make it as an alternative to dinner rolls to have with things such as goulash and beef stew. I use the "rapid bake" setting sometimes and it comes out just as good.

Good basic white bread, soft and fluffy. I am not sure what I did wrong the first time except my water was too hot, it came out super flat. Second time I did the right temp and it was great!

Great bread! The best I've made yet. Insanely huge,  fluffy loaves. It really does hit the top of the maker! It makes wonderful herb bread too, just add what ever you like to the mix. I lost this recipe and I can't tell you how happy I am to have found it again. Printed it out this time so I wont lose it again.

Made this bread with active yeast instead of bread machine yeast. Loaf didn't really rise. Bread was flavorful, but too dense. I will try next time with bread machine yeast.

I know this recipe needs another great review like it needs a hole in the head, but this really was AWESOME bread. I used half all purpose flour and half whole wheat flour and it was great. My husband ate half the loaf before I got home from work! I also added  tad more salt as per another suggestion that I read in previous reviews. This will be my go to recipe! I also like that there's no dairy.

A very good basic white bread recipe. The first bread I baked in my new bread maker! 

A few days later I used the leftover bread to make cinnamon french toast. It was the best french toast my husband has ever had :)

I just received a new bread machine. Having never used one, I immediately went to the included recipe book to try out  simple, white flour loaf. It failed, miserably and turned out looking shriveled and dry. So...I came to allrecipes.com and pulled up this beauty. I followed the instructions exactly as written and create the most perfect loaf of homemade bread I've ever had.

I have tried numerous bread machine recipes over the years and none of them were "quite right".  This one is.  I used a packet of regular yeast and ever forgot to use the oil and added it after the ingredients were mixed and the machine was kneading.  It still turned out beautifully.  I did use the 1.5 tsp salt.  I have already written this recipe in the front of one of my Cooks Illustrated Cookbooks, that's where I keep my best tried and true recipes.

Like most people I was hesitant to proof the yeast. The instructions on my bread machine do not call for that. However, I followed the recipe and ended up with the best bread machine bread I have ever had. I now proof the yeast in all my bread machine recipes if I'm not using the time delay function.

I make this at least once a week. I increased the recipe like another reviewer suggested, and only make the dough in my machine. I stop the cycle after about an hour, form two loaves and bake them in the oven. They always rise amazingly well and bake up DELICIOUS. No need to look any further for a bread recipe.

Not sure what happened.   First time I made this recipe it was fantastic.  Second time I tried someones suggestion and increased the salt.  The recipe was a flop.   The dough did not rise and the bread came out pale and very doughy.  Very disappointed the second time around.

The flavor of this bread was really good but it came out very dense and a much smaller loaf than expected. When I sliced it to use for sandwiches it fell apart. I followed the recipe exactly so I am not sure what happened.

I tried this bread in my Regal bread machine today despite its being opposite of all I had been told to do before IE yeast IN the water first-when it was mixing I was skeptical and had to add some flour-and I dropped the yeast to 1 teaspoon-but while a bit odd shaped on the top this is by far the best white bread I have ever made in the 10+ years of using a bread machine! It is officially my favorite-it is so soft inside-a texture I much prefer. THANKS for posting this awesome recipe! I even shared it on my facebook page!

Very good but also very light. I was hoping for a bread that could be used for sandwiches but this is way too airy for that -- also a very crispy crust -- which I love but also not good for sandwiches.

This was fantastic! The only changes I made were brown sugar instead of white, 1 teaspoon of kosher salt (equivalent to 1.25 tsp regular salt) instead of regular salt, and substituted 1 cup of flour with multigrain flour. The bread was moist, not too dense and had a crispy crust. I used the "Sandwich" setting for a 2 lb loaf on my Sunbeam. Thanks so much for the great recipe!!

This was my first successful bread machine made bread.  I failed so many times that I left the bread machine to my husband.  I'm homeschooling, and we have home economics...  This recipe was a great success.  It came out perfect, and it tasted great.  Gone in one meal.  If I had made an extra, it would have been gone too.

Hi, thanks for the + reviews....just wanted to add a comment about putting the yeast in with the water.  You can add a little flour, too.  This is making a 'sponge' something my Italian grandmother did as a first step in bread making.  She didn't have a machine of any kind--she used her hands and made 6 loaves at a time!

This bread was AWESOME! I was quite nervous - I was making it to accompany my cassarole and salad for dinner. the whole loaf was gone when dinner ended - only four of us - 1-1/2 lbs. of yummy! Very easy and don't hesitate because the directions go against the breadmakers manual as I did. Served up warm with butter....oh my!
Thanks so much for my new favorite white bread recipe.

By far the BEST bread recipe for my Sunbeam machine.  Very light and crusty.  Followed recipe exactly and had no trouble.  No more dense bread for me and my family.  Use my bread machine now more than ever before.

I make this all the time. I have implemented the addition of 1.5 tsp salt and sometimes-like on humid days I'll add a little less yeast due to it over rising. But otherwise this is the best tasting recipe I have found on here.

This is an amazing recipe just as it's written.  I make a loaf every other day. Last night I tried a little experimentation and came up with an excellent variation.  First added 1 Tbs brown sugar and 1 Tbs molasses to the machine.  Then added 2 slightly rounded Tsp of Red Star Active Dry Yeast followed by 1 cup of 110 degree F water.  Let set 10 mins.  Next I added 1/4 cup grapeseed oil, 1 cup of bulk Oat Flour, 1 cup of Bob's Red Mill Unbleached White Flour, 1/2 cup of bulk Whole Wheat Flour, and 1/2 cup of bulk High Gluten Flour, followed by 2 Tsp. of salt.  Set the machine for Basic Dark Crust and got a great loaf of a darker bread for toast, sandwiches, or just sliced with butter and jam.  When I call flour "bulk" above, I mean flour I purchased from a market that sells grains and flours in "bulk".  You just scoop out what you want into a bag and they weigh it at check out.

This is a great recipe for basic bread. I've found my machine doesn't bake it very well and so I use this recipe on dough setting. All I do is pop it into the oven and it makes perfect baguettes.

This is the best recipe for making delish fluffy bread!! The only modifications I make is using 2 tsp salt, adding 1/4 c of honey, 1/4 c flax seeds, and occasionally 1/4 c poppy seeds.. I mix and let the dough rise in the bread machine; however, I bake the bread in the oven (it seems to cook better here as opposed to the bread machine) at 375 degrees for 35 minutes.  It's hard not to take a bite of the top when it is cooling!!

Excellent recipe.  Better than the ones that come with the bread machine.  First loaf did fall just slightly took another reviewers comment and went with 1-1/2 teaspoon salt.  Also changed to extra virgin olive oil and swithced out a 1/4 cup of bread flour to whole wheat flour kids don't notice the difference.  Works great.

Don't be afraid to put the yeast in the water like the recipe says it really works.  Bread is lighter and better then I ever thought it would be.  Making my 4th loaf in one week.  Everyone who has tried it thinks it is better then any of the box mixes or the other recipes I have tried.  Got a loaf in the machine right now.

Just tasted my first piece & hubby & I agreed that it was the lightest bread to come out of either of our bread machines - ever!  We've each had a bread machine for 12 or 13 years, so a lot of loaves.  I did follow the recommendation to add 1.5 t salt.  I used AP flour & followed the Joy of Baking's substitution rule of 140 grams AP.  When I cut into this bread, I joked with my husband that we'd made a loaf of Wonder bread.  Much tastier, but that gives you the idea of how light it is.

My daughter has never liked bread made by a bread machine until now.  Her complaint has always been the bread is too dense.  This recipe makes a light bread.  Very Yummy!  I made a batch using 2 cups whole wheat and one cup white all purpose flour and it was great.

I just tried this recipe and it turned out really good. The only think I did different was use "regular" packaged yeast and not "bread machine" yeast. It hit to top of my 1.5 pound machine so I'm not complaining :)

I have tried this recipe 3 times since finding it last week.  I love it.  It's exactly what I was looking for in a "light" soft sandwich bread.  I make the dough in my bread machine but I have found that baking it in the oven in a loaf pan makes for a higher rise and better shape for sandwiches.  Thanks for posting this.  I thought I would not be able to give up buying bread and making it.  So now I can make many loaves of bread for the price of one store bought loaf AND I can control whats in it.

Made this tonight after reading all the great reviews.  Thought I goofed by adding the salt along with the yeast, sugar (I used Splenda) and water (didn't check the temp, just used hot water), but the bread rose perfectly and tasted delicious.  I've made bread from scratch before and baked it in the oven, but the bread machine worked like a charm.  Guess I'll be making this a lot in the future!

Yes, this is the best recipe.  The only thing I changed was to change to 2 3/4 cup of flour and 1/4 cup of vital wheat gluten.  YUMMMY and the flavor is so delicious!

Excellent bread!  The only change I made was to bake it in the oven instead of in the bread machine.  We run the dough cycle and bake it at 350 degrees for 22 minutes.  Comes out perfect!

Great bread.  I've made a couple of changes that made this a really good bread.  I've used 2 1/4 tsp. of bulk fast rising bread machine yeast, 2 1/2 cups bread flour and 1/2 cup of wheat flour and 1 1/2  tsp. sea salt.  I like oven baked loafs of bread better than the bread machine loaf.  I did as directed in the bread machine until the first rise and right after the punch I removed from machine and placed the dough in a greased bread pan.  Let rise for approx. 60 min. or until the size you desire.  Bake at 350 for 30 min.  Texture and taste was perfect.   I'll be making the bread this way from now on.  A big hit with my family.

I just got a bread machine and this is one of the first recipes.  It turned out really good!

Changes I made:
I used regular Active Dry yeast 2-1/4 tsp
I I increased the salt to 1-1/4 tsp on the recommendation of a previous poster.

I did everything else exactly as in the instructions.  My bread machine is supposed to be capable of a 2.5 pound loaf.  However this recipe fillled the bread pan to capacity!  The texture is nice.  The crust is flaky and crunchy.  I liked the crust but some people in my family did not.  Just personal preference.

Dough was very dry while mixing, and then when it finished it had dropped down in the pan.  Will not try it again.

I make this about twice a week now.  It is the best and easiest bread machine recipe I have used in ages.  It is great as is or you can use honey instead of sugar and 1/2 white 1/2 wheat flour.  Thanks

One word can say it all - AWESOME!  But one word isn't enough to describe such an easy, delicious bread.  I doubled the salt but, other than that, I baked it exactly as the recipe said.  (My bread machine also has an option for light, med., or dark.  I selected medium.)

We enjoyed the aroma while it baked.  The second it was done, it was out of the bread machine and on the cutting board.  It was beautiful!  Golden crust, fluffy and tasty bread!  No time for a picture!

I used what little was left for toast this morning and it was excellent.  Unfortunately it's already gone.  WILL DEFINITELY MAKE AGAIN!  Thank you for sharing!

So good I had to write my comments...this is my first review ever.

I picked up a bread machine at a thrift store and this was the very best of several recipes from this site that I've tried.  Aside from using canola instead of vegetable oil, I followed the recipe exactly and had a light, tasty loaf with a nice crust.  I don't have a thermometer and got excellent results using hot tap water.  I agree 100% with the recipe title!

I was a first time bread maker and I used this recipe last night and it was so so good. So easy to use with my new bread maker. I was nervous too with mixing the yeast with the wet but the outcome was great! Thanks for the recipe.

This bread was amazing! The texture was so much different than your usual bread machine bread.  My husband ate half the loaf as soon as it cooled off and that's saying something since he's a very light eater. Excellent toasted with butter and raspberry jam. Will be making again for sure.

I had made the basic white bread recipe from the Zojirushi 2lb loaf bread machine on med. and it was pretty good. Then I tried putting the water, sugar and yeast in first and it made a world of difference. The bread was lighter and had a better texture and flavor. I stayed with the 2lb loaf recipe but added 1/2 tsp more salt and cooked it on light.

I just got my first bread machine today - a Sunbeam 5891.  I made this recipe as soon as I had it washed - it was PHENOMENAL!  I was told to expect some failures at first, but it was a perfect loaf, high rise, DELICIOUS!  I used olive oil instead of veg. and 1-1/2 tsp salt, though next time will put 2 tsp.  We devoured it heated back up with butter.  YUM!  A great start to making my own bread!

After reading many reviews, I added that 1/2 teaspoon of extra salt, that was the only change I made. Wow, is right, I felt like the bread was going to rise out of the machine. This was the best bread I have made after 10 years with a bread machine. I also was one of those that never let the yeast touch the water before starting the batch. What a mistake. That 10 min yeast activation, with that slight extra touch of salt. WoW!

Such a simple recipe and it tastes amazing. I make this every week now instead of buying bread. I did make one small adjustment, I use 1.5 tsp of salt.

This is my second loaf of bread in my new breadmaker. The first was a recipe from the manual that came out bland, tough and dense. This recipe makes an amazing white bread! I too added an extra 1/2 tsp salt and an extra tbsp of sugar. It rose within a half inch of the top of the breadmaker. The kids love it! Tastes like the homemade white bread I remember eating as a kid.  I am going to try some substitutions such as applesauce in place of oil as one other reviewer did to cut down on calories. I think I will also try using honey instead of sugar too since it is better for you, and probably adding in some ww flour in place of half of the bread flour.  But don't get me wrong, the recipe is awesome as it is. I just try to use healthier substitutions when I can.  Thanks for posting!!

This bread turned out amazing!!!  I was a little worried at first because it says to add the yeast first, which is a bread machine"no, no".  But by far this recipe turned out a great soft loaf, not dense at all.  Amazing!!!

We make this recipe a few times a week and it always turns out yummy.  It's so easy that I now have it memorized.  Today I'm trying it with 1/3 of the flour whole wheat... it's an experiment.  We'll see how it goes.

This bread tasted REALLY good and it was very moist and soft but it didn't rise up high at all like reviewers had said. I didn't use bread machine yeast, though, so that might be why.

I was very hesitant to try this recipe as I have only had my machine a couple weeks. I have only tried making french bread and the white bread recipe they had in the book. The white bread did not turn out good but my family loves the french bread. This recipe went against everything I was told so I read all the reviews and made some suggested adjustments. I reduced the yeast to 2 tsps. and subsituted 2 tbsps of honey for the sugar. Added just a little extra salt and a tbsp of butter in with the dry ingredients. Also did 2 1/2 cups of bread flour and 1/2 cup of wheat flour. I cooked it on the 1 1/2 lb setting for white with light crust and it came out amazing. easy to slice for sandwich bread and my family is loving it. If you are new to bread making or even if you aren't try this recipe.. it is excellent!!

YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS BREAD!!!  I have had my bread machine for 15 years and I was never happy with the results.  This recipe made the best loaf ever.  The crust is flaky, the bread was airy and it toasted really well.  I may never buy another loaf of bread again...seriously.  I have to try other bread machine recipes using the water/sugar/yeast combo first, then add the flour.

Great recipe! Success first time.  I used 1.5 teaspoons salt as someone suggested.  I also used all-purpose flour and it still turned out wonderful.  Best bread ever from my machine.  Using other recipes the bread is heavy in comparison.

20 years ago when I bought my Bread Machine I used it to make 4 loaves of bread. Each of them, had I been a bricklayer, could have substituted for a mising brick. This recipe has removed me from the necessity of buyiing baked bread at Safeway. It is very good, and quite soft, and I really didn't believe that it was possible. My last loaf was the best, very moist, soft, and It didn't last very long once my Wife and I got ahold of it. I use an electric knife to cut it, and that's a good idea for you too.

Awesome! Thank you for the recipe! I made as directed except I only had regular yeast, which turned out to be all right because it gets activated by the warm water that it sits in for 10 minutes before you turn the machine on!  made my  first loaf for dinner tonight, but it disappeared so quickly that I am in the middle of making the 2nd loaf! Thanks for sharing.

Brilliant bread recipe! I followed the suggestion of increasing the salt - I replaced one tablespoon of sugar with a giant squeeze of honey, and used Safflower Oil rather than Vegetable oil.  I've made this bread twice and I had excellent results both times in the bread machine.

I would. I increased the salt to 1.5 tsp (as suggested by several other AR bakers) and had great results.  If I could give this recipe a 10-star rating, I would.

The inside of the loaf was excellent, and the loaf overall was beautiful.  Only complaint is that the crust was really, really thick.  Though, that may be an artifact of the breadmaker having to cook such a thick loaf all the way through.  Next time, maybe I'll use the Dough setting and bake in the oven in a real bread pan.

Wow. This is my fourth attempt at making bread. The first three loaves came from a recipe with the manual and they tasted good, but not great.   But this recipe tastes amazing! I followed another user's suggestion by trying 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, and 2 1/2 cups bread flour. I also only used 2 teaspoons of yeast. I added 4 teaspoons of gluten, which is supposed to make the bread rise and soften.   The bread tasted amazing! I was real nervous about leaving the yeast in the water, too. The inside of the loaf was soft and perfectly cooked throughout, the crust was not as hard as the previous loaves, the quality of the bread was soft and chewy. I love it!

I hesitantly followed this recipe as it is laid out rather than putting the ingredients in in the order my machine instructions say. It did not turn out well. It did not rise well, was very dense, and not cooked thoroughly in parts. I also had a really hard time getting it to come out of the pan. I may give it another go, but rearrange the order I load up the pan.

This is our everyday bread.  I have tried other recipes and this one is the best.  Great flavor and texture.  I now use 1.5 cups of whole wheat flour and it is still delicious.

2-6-11. Made more of this easy bread. Used one cup of whole wheat flour and added 1 Tbs vital glutin. Bread comes out great!  Since we were in a blizzard this week I made a second loaf all white, and added I egg. This is a really great bread!


This is the first bread I baked today in my garage sale 12 year old Regal Kitchenpro bread machine. WONDERFUL!  The crust came out perfect!  After reading other reviews, I did add the 1.5 tsp Salt, and it tastes great!  Slicing and eating this bread warm is Heaven! Will defiantly try it with half wheat and the wheat rye combo!  BTW my old ABM is the vertical kind.  Was anxious to see it work and Voila!

This was good bread but it wasn't something I would be able to use on a regular basis. It was light and fluffy but wouldn't hold up well for toast or sandwiches, which is important to me. Otherwise a good recipe.

I've tried many different recipes for white bread and this is a definite favorite. I had to add just a little flour to keep it from being too sticky but I've yet to make anything in my machine that didn't need to be tweaked a little. I followed the suggestions of another reviewer and just used the dough setting on the machine, then baked the bread in my oven with some butter brushed on top. Awesome! This is one that I think my kids will eat without throwing away the crust.

This has become our white bread recipe that we make 1-2 times per week for the kids. I prefer a more flavorful bread for my husband and me, but the kids just want a regular white bread and this is it. It always comes out great.

My mother just gave me her bread machine (she got a new one) and this was the very 1st recipe I've used on it ever and I am sooooo very happy that I did. The only change I made was to increase the salt to 1.5 tsp, (as per other recommendations) and everything else was followed word for word. I just finished a warm piece with melted butter and oh-my-gosh! This was PERFECT!!! Great texture, and the crust was perfectly crisp. This will be my go-to recipe for bread and I'm thrilled that it worked on my first go! Thank you for this recipe!

My daughter sent us a bread machine for our February birthdays.  I started with pre-packaged mixes, and while very good, they are also expensive.  I found this recipe while searching for a lighter, less dense bread.  It does go against everything my bread machine manual instructs!  I tried it with the variation of adding 1/2 tsp. more of salt and it came out great.  Then I got a little bolder and tried the variation using 2 cups of white bread flour and 1 cup of wheat flour, and 3 tablespoons of sugar.  I left the salt at 1 tsp. as in the original recipe.  Every time I make it it comes out perfect.  It' the family favorite now!  Thanks!

As everyone says, this bread rises higher than most and is lighter and fluffier, not dense and heavy.  I used 1-1/2 tsp. salt and 2-1/4 tsp. bread machine yeast.

throw away your bread machine recipe - nothing works better than this.  be sure to set your machine properly for a 1-1/2 lb loaf; that's the only mistake i made.

This recipe is fantastic!  I was nervous about putting the ingredients in the machine in the order given, but I trusted the other reviewers and it turned out great!  I used regular flour and yeast because I didn't have any specifically for bread machines.  It didn't matter.  The top of my first loaf fell, so I took another reviewers advise and increased the salt to 1 1/2 tsp.  My second loaf didn't fall and was beautiful.  We were so broke this week I couldn't even afford to go buy a loaf at the store and still had three days of lunches to make for my husband.  I pulled out my machine, dusted it off and gave this a try.  What a life saver!  Thanks Diggetydog and to all the people who took the time to review!

I didn't think this recipe would turn out properly because, as with other reviews, my machine directs to NOT allow the yeast to touch the liquid...the exact opposite of this recipe. I was never really satisfied with the texture of the bread from my machine. It was always heavy and dense. I decided to give this unconventional recipe a try and I was so glad I did! It is AMAZING! The texture is perfect....better than any homemade bread I'd ever produced. I did increase the salt to 1.5 tsp and increased the sugar to 3 Tbls on the advice of other reviewers. Hands down, the best basic bread recipe ever! Thank you for submitting this recipe! I've learned my lesson: always give the unexpected a try!

Made this today. So yummy and easy to make. I followed directions exactly but than added a handful of flax seeds. The taste is so much better than store bought bread. I even enjoyed eating the "butt" or end of the bread and that is something I can't do with the store bought kind.

I make this bread atleast twice a week and have been for some time now.  It is so easy and makes perfect bread for sandwiches.  I usually cut off the top and use for garlic bread with dinner one night and slice the rest for sandwiches since it rises way past the conventional sandwich bread size.  It's also nice because it's dairy free and my wife has a dairy allergy. Great Bread!!

Perfect bread!  I was a bit scared to put the yeast and sugar in with the water and let is sit for 10 minutes because that was against what the owner's manual said to do.  However, I went ahead and now I'm glad we did!  Our family has a new favorite bread!  It rose perfectly, had perfect coloring, and tase as good as it looks!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

I made this recipe as directed except I only used the dough cycle in the bread machine and then put in regular loaf pan, let it rise for about 45 more minutes, and then baked at 375 for about 30 minutes.  Very, very good.  Will make dinner rolls next time with this recipe.----oh yeah, i forgot.  I did use 2 1/2 cups AP flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat.

Wow, this is the highest I've seen a bread rise in my machine!  Proofing the yeast first definitely helps.  I used the dough cycle and then baked it up as a round loaf in my oven for spinach dip.  It came out wonderful.  I can't wait to try it again and have the bread machine do all the work next time!

Used this recipe last night to make Dinner Rolls.  I added everything to Bread Machine as listed, however I did add a little extra salt as 1 reviewer recommended.  I was in a hurry, so did not let the yeast and water sit for the 10 minutes called for.  This bread rose very nicely on the dough cycle.  I then removed and shaped into 12 dinner rolls and placed in a sprayed 9x13 pan, and baked at 350 degrees for 20 min. after removing from oven I rubbed butter all over the browned tops....yummy!  Will use this recipe again and again.

I think this is one of the best loafs I have ever made!  It goes against everything your breadmaker instructions tell you, and is PERFECT every time, I make this about once a week!  Terrific!  Thanks Diggetydog!

I almost gave up on my bread machine until I tried this recipe. It produced the best bread I've tasted so far from my bread machine. I took the advice of other reviewer when I baked it the second time by putting 3 tbs of sugar and 2 tsp of yeast. It produced a much better bread from my bread machine. Definitely recommend this recipe to other bread machine newbies.

I loved it!  Hadn't had any luck with my new bread machine's recipe.  Was about to contact the company.  But after trying this recipe out, I am completely satisfied.  This bread raised beautifully and was light and delicious.  Thank you so much, will be using this recipe from now on, just will substitute some whole wheat for white flour to see if it works as well.

Unbelievable! I am both astounded and thrilled to death! My first loaf of bread from this recipe came out of my machine about half an hour ago...and I LOVE it!! I had a bread machine years ago, and gave it away because no one wanted to eat the heavy, tough and dense bread that came out of it. I recently bought another machine because the closest grocery store is 45 minutes away AND I had found this recipe and it gave me hope that not all bread machine bread is tough and chewy. This recipe tastes NOTHING like others I have tried. I am sooo excited!! I was concerned about the over-rising of the bread, so I did add 1/2 tsp. salt to keep that from happening. I love the smell, the flavor, the crisp crust, the wonderful soft insides. It's not the least bit tough!! I am soooo excited! Thank You!!!!

The reviews say it all.  Foolproof and delicious.  I did take another reviewers advice and use 1.5 tsp of salt and it turned out great.  So simple and uses stuff you always have in your pantry.

I'm not sure why but it kind of sunk down on top.  I felt like there was something missing also, like it needed more salt but that may have just been me.  My husband loved it!

Delicious flavor but did not rise right.  I followed the directions to the letter: exact measurements, fresh yeast that bubbled, warm water, but the loaf appeared to rise and then fall hard.  The crust was crunchy and hard. The inside tasted good but needed a little more salt. My bread machine manual DID warn that yeast is never to touch liquid, but so many gave positive reviews that I tried to do it as written.  May try again putting ingredients in different order.

Despite some really interesting suggestions from other reviewers, I followed this recipe to the letter and it turned out fantastic! So light, fluffy and easy to make. My only complaint would be that the intoxicating smell of the bread woke me up at 5:00am. Something tells me that I may need to reset my timer!

YUM! I just made some of this but tweaked the recipe a bit.  I used a half cup of milk and a half cup of water.  I also used 1.5 cups of white flour, 1 cup of whole wheat flour, .5 cup of wheat germ and .5 cup of ground flaxseed for the 3 cups of flour the recipe calls for.  Turned out fabulous! Lovely texture and good for you--will definitely make again and again.

I have been working my way through all of the bread machine recipes on this site and so far this is my favorite.My boyfriend thought it tasted too commercial, but I love the light texture. I did try this technique on another recipe and it didn't rise like this, nor was it fluffy like this loaf, so I guess it's an anomaly that only works with this combination of ingredients. I will be making this again as soon as I finish the rest on the site. Thanks for a delicious and easy bread.

A basic, plain white bread that'll make the bf happy bc I don't make white bread without additions very often.  The proportions of ingredients were spot on.  I made the dough in the bread machine and took it out to let rise, then baked at 375 for 60 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe!

While this bread is nice and fluffy, it is a lot like store bread. It lacked a punch in taste, even though the texture was quite nice.   I won't be making this again.

We've had bread machines for years, and this is the best white bread they've ever produced.  Crusty, fluffy, YUMMY.  I use 2 tsp of salt, the 1.5 lb loaf setting, and it fluffs up to the top of the pan.

It would be great if you were going for store bought white bread taste.  It was nice and fluffy with the extra salt some reviewers suggested but I won't be making it again, if I want bread like this I will spend $1 at the store and save myself the effort.

Added another 1/2 tsp of salt and replaced 1/2 c of flour with wheat flour, otherwise I followed the recipe and directions and came out with an excellent loaf of bread.  Will definitely make again.

I am a newbie bread baker and even I paused when I read to add the yeast to the water first, as this is contrary to every direction I've read.  I am converted to this method!  I have never had such a successful loaf of bread before!  It rose quite high, giving that distinct "loaf" shape.  I added some vital wheat gluten flour to my plain flour, and a bit more salt.  No more box mixes for me... now I know what's going into the bread, so I can experiment more.  Very excited about this recipe!

Unfortunately this recipe didn't work for me at all. I'm practically dating my bread machine so I was expecting much better results. Mine collapsed both times I tried this recipe, so next time I will try to remedy this with extra salt. The crust was super hard and crunchy. I think it would have been better on the "light" setting rather than the white bread setting that was recommended. But I like the idea of the recipe and will keep tinkering with it.

Ohh my, awesome, awesome, awesome! My husband and I have been baking bread for a few months now, when out of the blue my mom bought us a bread machine. The first loaf was ok, the second sucked, so I got online and found this recipe. I followed it exactly, except added an extra tablespoon of sugar, 2 tablespoons of water during kneading, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. I was worried at first because it wasn't seeming to rise, but in the end we ended up with a golden brown loaf of delicious, soft, melt-in-your-mouth bread. I will use this recipe from now on and add-in extras if I want different flavors or varieties. Thanks for this recipe, I'm in love!

I made this dough in the bread machine with an extra 1/2 teaspoon of salt as previously recommended, removed it and formed two french shaped loaves. Baked it for 15 minutes in a 350 degree oven. Best bread ever!! Thanks for the recipe.

I tried this 3 different times following the instructions and all three times it came out to be a small hard loaf. So I don't know what went wrong but this was not the recipe for me to use.

Amazing! I added the extra salt as reccomended in previous reviews.  I didn't have any butter milk so used the substitution as follows: 1tbsp lemon juice 1 cup of milk.  I used powdered milk and added the lemon juice to it.  I poured off the extra 1/4 cup and added 3/4 cup to the bread maker. It was easily the yummiest bread I've made! My young children and my neighbours loved it too! Only challenge I faced was could I turn out a second loaf fast enough!  Thanks for the recipe!

I have been making all of my family's bread using this recipe for about a year now with fool-proof, fantastic results. I recently switched from whole wheat to whole GRAIN flour and for the first time, this recipe failed me. My bread would rise to a point, then it would seem to struggle under the weight or structure of the flour. I reached out to other allrecipe memebers for help via the buzz and Marie C. suggested I try VITAL WHEAT GLUTEN. The package said to add 1 TBSP of vital wheat gluten per cup of flour, so I reduced my flour by 3 TBSP and added the vital wheat gluten in it's place and... I GOT MY RISE BACK! All you have to do is check out my profile picture to see the difference it made. Thanks SHECOOKS for the awesome recipe, and thanks Marie C. and those fellow cooks who offer advice and help on the buzz for helping  me get my rise back :)

Great Recipe.  This is the recipe that usually converts non-believers of bread machines into ardent fans.  

It tastes amazing -- about 80,000 times better than storebought and is especially good when it's toasted.

My family loves this recipe!  I use 1 1/2 tsp of salt instead of 1 tsp, and I use the DOUGH cycle of my bread machine then let it rise in mini or regular loaf pans and bake it in the oven - it always turns out wonderful!

Good bread, easy to prepare.  Nice taste.  Texture is a little too airy for my tastes.  I wonder if that is my bread machine though, because all my breads are like that in the machine.

This was my first experience with my new bread machine and it came out perfect.  I replaced a half cup of the bread flour with whole wheat, and I got a light, airy bread with a nice flaky crust.  I spent less than 15 minutes making it and cleaning up, including the 10 minutes letting the yeast sit.  Will definitely make again, and again and again...

Absolutely delicious & soft.  Not like other bread machine recipes which are always so dense.  I did mine on dough cycle and placed in 2 bread pans sprayed with cooking spray.  Baked for 30 min. at 325 degrees.  Next time will place in one pan to have a better sized loaf.  Definitely a keeper and delicioso!

Great basic bread recipe! Proofing the yeast first was an unusual, welcome change. I've tried packaged bread-machine breads & other recipes that do NOT stand up to this one's ease & consistent results. The short ingredient list is a definite plus!  If white bread is too bland for you, I've modified it at times to change the taste (like adding sesame seeds, toasted pumpkins seeds, cinnamon, using wheat flour, etc.) & the recipe stands up to these additions. My bread machine makes a thick crust, too, so thanks for the tip on how to soften it (put bread in a plastic bag directly after baking so that it's own steam will soften the crust). Thank you for sharing this recipe...This has become a staple at my house!

the reviews were so on the money, and so is the name!  this is the absolute best bread machine recipie that i've ever tried.  I follow it to the 'T', but, I do it in the dough only cycle, and divide it into two sprayed pyrex bread pans.  30 mins. on 325 in the oven, and it comes out absolutely perfect!  I made 8 loaves over thanksgiving weekend, and gave a few out to friends and family, and it's already time for more!  so good!  and very light and fluffy!

This really is the best bread machine recipe I've come across.  I did substitute 1/4 cup of flax meal for 1/4 cup of the flour, but followed the recipe otherwise.  The bread rose very nicely and turned out light and fluffy.  I'll definitely make this one again.

Was very good. I made it using the timer so I didn't let the yeast soak for 10 minutes. Will try that the next time.

I've tried dozens of bread machine recipes over the years. This recipe yields a very tasty loaf of bread with a soft, full inside texture, nice crusty outside, and slices easier and thinner than many other loaves. Yum!

This was delicious!  I hate the little hole the mixer in my breadmaker makes on the bottom of the bread, so I used the dough setting on my breadmaker, then let it rise in a greased pie plate for 1 1/2 hours, then baked at 350 degrees for about 20-30 minutes.  Followed the recipe except I didn't have bread flour, so I used all purpose, and it still came out great!  I'll be using this one a lot!

I have owned my machine since 2003 and have used it alot. Never have I made such a wonderful light and fluffy bread. I love my machine but was tired of bread that wasn't soft like the store bought. So I tried this recipe and like many was a bit leary on the mixing yeast with the water. My machine says not too. But I listened to my trusty family on line here and WOW this was truly amazing. 
I follwed the suggestions of eveyone and added an extra 1/2 tsp salt.
I used some Whole wheat flour as well.
I set the machine and took off. When my family come home there was a beautiful loaf of perfect bread waiting for us to chow on. Only one problem.....we ate it all too fast and now it's gone...have to make more.
I love that there are only 6 ingredients!!

This bread is the best that has come out of my machine.  It has the nicest soft airy texture that the whole house loved.  I added the extra 1/2 teaspoon of salt as per the reviews.  I also used 1/2 whiteWW 1/2 bread flours and threw in 2T flax meal.  I layered ingred according to my machine's directions with the yeast on top.  It worked out fine.

This is a good bread.  I made this recipe late last night and had a piece when it was warm with some melted butter.  I follwed the ingredients measurements, but I placed the ingredients in my bread machine according to it's directions...liquids first, dry ingredients and make a well for the yeast. I didn't have any issues other reviewers mentioned about the bread falling. The flavor is 5-star, but the instructions I think may be the cause of the issues.

Although my bread machine acted up midway through and I had to bake it in the oven (@ 350 for 40 min.), this has been my best bread that I have made in a long time.  I did increase the salt to 1 1/2 teaspoons like the other reviews said.  I will definetely make this bread again.

This ws my 1st attempt at bread using a bread machine. As I have no instructions for the machine (it was donated to me!) I just had a go. I subed the white flour for wholewheat. Bunged everything and was quite pleased by the result. It looked as though somebody had punched it in the top though when it was done, taste was lovely. I'll try a different order with the ingrediants next time and see how I go. Definately a keeper for me!! Cheers!

Worked well for my first attempt at using a bread machine.  I think I'll just use it for the dough cycle next time and bake it in the oven.  Thanks.

This is good bread. I took the advice of others and used 1 1/2 tsp. of salt and it turned out perfectly. I will probably make this every chance I get from now on. Thanks for sharing.

I was given a bread machine without the instruction book. I followed this recipe after seeing all the great reviews on it, and for the first time my bread turned out GREAT!! It was fluffy and perfect. I did do as suggested by others of adding 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt it turned out great, definantly will make many more times. My husband loved it too!!

I recently bought my Oster bread machine in the U.S.  I carefully followed the white bread recipe to the letter, it was heavy and looked overbaked.  I tried it a second time with the same results.  So then I turned to All Recipes and found this recipe.  It turned out just wonderful.  I added the extra salt and instead of baking it for one hour at the end of the kneading processes, I baked it for 40 minutes.  Perfect loaf and just delicious.  For those of you who follow the machine instructions and are not happy, try reducing the bake time.  Also worth a mention is that the bread flour in the U.S. seems heavier than that in Canada, thus the Canadian flour makes a lighter loaf.  Thank you to the person who submitted this recipe and to All Recipes for putting it online for all of us!

I did 2.5 tsp of yeast and 1.5 tsp of salt as recommended. I have made it several times and it is consistently a great bread.  One note...I have 'bread machine yeast' and it says to let it come to room temperature before using.  I didn't wait for it to come to room temperature the second time I was making this bread, and it turned out much drier - not light and moist like it did every other time.

Based on the other reviews I used 1 1/2 teaspoons salt in what turned out to be the Best Bread Machine White Bread I've ever made. My 6 year-old now makes this bread for us every day. Thanks for a great recipe and to all the reviewers.

This bread is OUTSTANDING!! Even though I came up short on ingredients ( no oil, used butter, no bread flour, used all-purpose, and yeast that didn't proof well ) , this bread surely is foolproof!! It still rose to about 3/4 of a loaf, and with an extra 1/2 tsp.salt, had a wonderful taste that is better than my go-to recipe!!  I guess I will be stocking my pantry with 50# 's of bread flour and lots of new yeast!! PLEASE GIVE THIS A TRY!!!! You will NOT be disappointed.  Thanks for a terrific recipe!!

I was about to give up on my bread machine when I stumbled on this recipe. This is the best bread machine bread, ever! 

The only modification I did was add 0.5 tsp more salt as another commenter suggested and the top of the bread was perfect! My SO ate 1/2 of the loaf in one sitting...and he doesn't even like bread that much. It's that good. 

Thanks for posting this awesome recipe!

This is by far the BEST bread I have made in my bread machine! I've already made it three times this week. My husband has declared "no more store bought bread please". We hardly let it cool before devouring it. Please dont let the order of ingredients scare you... if you haven't tried this it's a must you wont regret it!

I followed the recipe with the help of of few hints that I read. Such as upping the sugar to 3 T. and the salt to 1 1/2 t. and it was awesome! 
This is the first bread that I have made from scratch in my machine and it beets all the box mixes by far! The bread was perfect!No big air holes nothing, just like getting at a bakery. I am so excited I can not wait to make more and try more new recipes.

This was a good bread. Not the best I've had out of my machine, but still good.  Seemed rather plain or something, like bread you'd get out of a bag.  I made exactly as is and its basically fool proof, so its easy to come out with a great loaf of bread.  I'd make again.

I asked for a bread machine for Christmas 4 years ago. After receiving it, I used it once, threw away the bread because of the taste and texture and never used it again. This recipe has kept me using my bread machine on a weekly basis and it has encouraged me to try to find other good recipes. I plan to try adding wheat flour like others suggested next time. Hope it has the same great taste and texture as the white bread had. I like to use 2 Tbsp. olive oil and 2 Tbsp. honey instead of the 1/4 cup veggie oil.

It rose beautifully, and tastes wonderful - soft in the middle with a perfectly flaky, crispy crust. Delicious! I will definitely be making this again.

The recipe is perfect! And for my first time using my bread machine, the bread was a big hit! Very simple, but very tasty. I had to bake on lighter setting than the normal one, it came out a bit to chewy the first time.

I agree with all the raves of previous posters. This is the first white bread recipe I've ever even THOUGHT about keeping - and I certainly will. I love th texture . . . stable enough to make a sandwich or spread something on it, but light and fluffy in the mouth.
Thank you!!

Very tender. Easy to slice. Cooked perfectly, but I thought it was bland without loading it with butter or seasonings.

We tried this recipe 3 months ago just to see if we could find something that would work in our machines -- we lost the owners manuals.  This bread is so easy to make and so consistantly good that we have not purchased store-bought bread in about 3 months.  

This recipe also makes GREAT hot dog and hamburger buns in an oven.  Its fool-proof and tastes light, fluffy and exceptionally fresh.

I love this bread.  I use half grainary and half white bread flour instead of all white bread flour.  I also sometimes substitue honey for sugar and butter for oil.  Always a good loaf! Thanks for the recipe.

I made 2 loaves using the disposable bread pans.  They were oh so cute and I gave one away.  Now I am badgered daily to make more.....only now I use a traditional size bread pan. YUM! My suggestion is to keep this one a secret if you do not want to bake everyday.

I just made this loaf.  Proofed the yeast in the pan, worked well, used the bread machine dough cycle then put dough in a loaf pan and let rise about 30 min., then baked at 350 degrees for 30 min.  Awesome, Awesome, Awesome !!!  Love the tasten the crispy crust, tender insides, and the ease of making it.  Can't wait to try some of the variations mentioned in people's reviews.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Excellent bread! Moist, not crumbly; I used 1 c. whole wheat flour and 2 c. white flour; light and very tasty! This recipe may become a staple in my bread machine.

I just bought a brand new bread machine at a rummage sale that did not come with intructions. So I decided to try this recipe for my test loaf.

  I have to admit, I was about 3 tablespoons short for my 3 cups of flour. Since my 2 year old was sleeping, and I didn't want to wake him to run to town for more flour, I added some powdered milk to make up for the difference.

 The taste was still excellent. The loaf did fall a bit but that was probably do to my hap-hazzard substition and the fact that I just guessed on what setting to put the bread machine on since I didn't have the manual..

 It did come out very flaky and delicious. My husband tore into it. 

 I will use this again, (next time with the proper amount of flour). I could only be better when I do it the proper way.

I received a bread machine for Christmas and have since been on a quest to find the perfect bread.  This is it!  My boyfriend described it as his "favorite bread ever!"  I did follow  BERMYROSE's advice, making the exact same substitutions as she did.  This is definitely a keeper!

I gave a 2 star instead of 3 star due to existing high rating overall.  might make a nice base for french toast, or bread pudding, but too sweet for me as a white bread.  My husband refrained from comment - that's a bad sign.  Given the high rating, I was VERY dissapointed. Never have I been so in disagreement with the general reviews.  I don't understand the high rating.  The quality of bread was good; the crust too flaky - like a croisant; but the taste failed because it was not a white bread -- too sweet, and it wasn't sweet enough to qualify as a sweet bread.

It's official...I'm a convert. I've been struggling with pitiful attempt after pitiful attempt at breadmaking and just recently purchased a bread machine. My first attempt was this recipe and let me say, never again will I knead a lump of dough. I'm sure there are many who will cringe at this admission and - I'm sorry! This was just amazingly easy, so quick and still the end result was a wonderful smell wafting through my home and fluffy, delicious (not to mention edible!) bread. 
A very forgiving recipe this one. I had only all-purpose flour and quick rise yeast on hand so that is what I used. Also, in place of veggie oil I used olive oil. In spite of all these liberties, this loaf still came out beautifully. YUM!

Good flavor, but far too "wet" after bake. Recipe calls for 1/4 CUP of oil, which is probably the culprit. Will try it again with about 2T and update.

This bread came out so light and fluffy.  I just threw everything into the machine and started it.  I didn't let the yeast foam for 10 minutes.  I used Olive Oil instead.  It turned out amazing!

My husband made this bread last night. He didn't change the recipe, but he did put hot water in the bread maker pan to warm it up prior to making the bread. The crust is flaky and crispy, and the inside is soft and delicous. Good consistancy throughout the entire loaf. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I just took out my fifth loaf of this bread. I love it, and it stays fresh several days. I add a little extra sugar, and preheat my pan with hot water, and use my thermometer for accurate yeast temperature. I warm the oil in the micro for a few seconds. Keep the yeast happy for a perfect loaf of bread. Great Recipe.

This bread was very easy to make and was very delicious!!  The top of it came out lumpy, but other than that, it was perfect!  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  Will make again!!

Excellent!! I've made this several times and each time it comes out wonderful! I use regular rapid rise yeast, and all purpose flour. I also have started using about 1/4 c. of sugar and it comes out sooooo delicious and soft with a great flaky crust. My family gobbles it up before it's even cooled down!  Also...I followed the recipe directions even though my machine says to add the ingredients differently. I was skeptical at first, but it comes out perfect each time.

I have tried lots of recipes for my bread machine.I have never been happy with any of them.I tried this one and loved it. The loaf was light and moist.It rose perfectly.Will make it often.I also made it using applesauce for oil,honey for sugar,1cup whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup soy flour,1 1/2cup bread flour plus wheat gluten. It turned out good also.

Delicious! I found my '94 black and decker machine and dusted it off and tried this recipe after my neighbour said she never buys store bread anymore, only uses her machine. To make it a tad healthier - I used 1 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cup bread flour. It turned out moist and tender with a crisp and yummy crust. I will make this daily now

I bake 1-2 loaves of bread a day for my family.  We don't buy premade bread, so I was looking for a new recipe.  I have tried this recipe now four different times in two different bread machines.  I have tried two different bread flours and I have come up with same results every time.  The bread will raise up and then sink and be knotty on top.  The taste of the bread is good enough and it's easy enough to put together, but I have yet to get a nice loaf.  Today, I tried reducing the sugar to 1 tbsp + 1 tsp instead of the 2 tablespoons called for and it was still knotty on top, but didn't collapse quite as bad.  Next time I will try even less sugar.  I think that it's a decent recipe, but something isn't right.  I'll experiment :-)

This recipe is easy and good! For some reason I have trouble baking bread in my bread machine.  It sticks, gets burned, etc.  Yesterday I tried this recipe.  I set the machine to turn on a couple of hours after I left the house and it finished about 1/2 hr before I returned.  It was perfect.  I followed the recipe except used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  It came out of the bread pan with no trouble and was a perfect color (I used light crust).

This was a wonderful easy recipe, even in my ancient bread machine.  I substituted 2 1/4 teaspoons of quick acting yeast for the bread flour yeast and unsalted butter for the oil, and the bread is delicious!  Can't wait to try some of the variations listed here.

Fantastic! This bread baked up so light and fluffy I could hardly believe it came from my breadmaker. I subbed 1 c of the regular flour with whole wheat and used olive oil instead of the vegetable oil. I'm not a huge fan of the way my bread maker bakes the bread so I usually just use the dough setting and bake it in a loaf pan in the oven, but you really can't beat the simplicity of this recipe. I am going to try baking it in the oven as well to see if I like it even better. I think this has become my favorite regular bread recipe! Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is very good.  I allow the yeast sugar and warm water to sit (unlike the bread machines directions) then I use the basic mode on the bread machine because I use active dry yeast (not the quick acting).  I have made this bread several times and it is always wonderful.  It doesn't even get dry the next day (if it lasts that long).  Thanks for this recipe.

I wasn't expecting much from this recipe since I'm a first time bread machine user, however this recipe is excellent.  It's easy, simple and idiot-proof.  And for the flavour..it was awesome, even my parents were impressed.

I found a second-hand bread machine for $3  and it works just fine so I've begun making bread. This recipe was just what I wanted:e ingredients are easy to assemble and dump into the machine (2) the yeast was a single packet (no using part of a second packet here) and (3) exactly 3 hours after I started my $3 machine,  I had a big golden loaf with a nice texture and pretty color.

Easy, yummy, what more could you ask for?  I did change the order of ingredients per manufacturers instructions for my bread machine.  I also added 4 tsp. of wheat gluten to add some protein and help it rise.  Will definetly be making this again!

This bread turned out great, my 1st success. Had a problem with proofing the yeast in the pan so i threw it away and started another one  in my pyrex 2 cup glass measuring cup and mixed the sugar and water real well before adding the yeast and it proofed beautifully. Set the crust on light as others suggested and ended up with a perfect loaf of white bread. Going to try with wheat flour today. Thanks karen.

I followed recipe exactly, but it came out very dense. We didn't even finish it and normally bread disappears in our house. I may use this as a base and play with the recipe, but as is we won't use it.

I tried this again and made bread sticks and they are delicious.  The only changes I made was to use 1 cup of white whole wheat flour in place of the AP and butter as others suggested.

Although and experienced cook, this is my first time with a bread machine and this must make too large a loaf for my Breadman machine. The dough overflowed and caused the lid to lift during the cooking process and clean up was a mess. My machine indicated it is 1 1/2 pound size and I measured precisely ... not sure what the problem is. Any advice?

Finally a great white bread recipe that works in my bread machine!  I've made this twice in the past week and it has turned out perfect!  Easy to make, wonderful aroma as it bakes and almost as good as my Grandma's homemade bread used to taste (with a faction of the work time!).  I used yeast that I knew was fresh and bread flour as indicated in the recipe - the quality of these two ingredients and proofing the yeast are what I believe make this recipe a success.  If it doesn't turn out for you, make sure you have "good, fresh" yeast!.  Will pass this along to family members and this will now be my "Regular" bread machine white bread recipe!!!!*****

I didn't have any bread machine flour or bread machine yeast.  I substituted these items with Gold Metal flour and used 1 package of Fleishman's Yeast.  I also used 1/2 t. salt instead of the full teaspoon of salt in the recipe.  The bread sank a little on one end, but not quite as bad as I have experienced with other favorite bread machine recipes.  The inside was very light, flaky and soft.  The exterior was crusty golden brown.  My husband thought this was very good bread.  Thanks!

Yup. I concur. This is a super bread. The crumb is soft and moist, the crust a perfect golden brown. It makes fantastic toast. My SO is *very* picky about his bread - he rarely buys loaves of bread but instead makes it in our ABM. He has one recipe that he sticks to like an old stubborn mule. And even he said this was a good bread. What I like is that it's so simple - no milk, no powdered milk, no egg - just the basics. Thanks, Karen K.!

Fluffy inside, flaky and crisp outside.  I had to use olive oil instead of vegetable oil, but the bread still turned out well.  To avoid collapse in this and any other bread machine recipe, make sure that you're not using too much liquid (water, milk, etc.)--I've found that collapse occurs when the dough isn't thick enough.  Good luck, and enjoy!

This is excellent bread. I didn't have any trouble with it collapsing. I used 2 1/4 tsps of bread machine yeast. I also used roughly 3 cups of bread flour, maybe just shy of 3 cups. The bread is fantastic! Thanks for sharing!

I read some of the reviews and got a little worried about how good the recipe is, but the other reviews gave me some confidence. The recipe is definitely very easy to make, comes out with a great crust color and very soft on the inside. My hubby loves it! But definitely stick to the recipe, especially the sugar (I'll even increase it to 2.5 tablespn), or it'll taste a little too bland.

I just discovered this recipe yesterday, and am now making my 3rd loaf. It tastes INCREDIBLE. I, like others, have issues with it collapsing, but it still tastes great. When my husband got home last night, he started devouring the loaf I had done. I now am on a mission to figure out how to get it to stop collapsing (I'll report back once I figure out where the problem lies). My machine is a Welbilt ABM4900. In any case, the bread is wonderful, it's so easy to make I've already memorized the recipe, and I may stop buying bread, and just invest in the flour etc. so I can make a fresh loaf of this every day (I can even get it ready the night before when I get the coffee machine, etc. prepped for morning use and set the timer so it's done for breakfast).

*update* I made a loaf yesterday with bread flour instead of all-purpose flour, and it came out PERFECT! Hit the top of the machine. My husband used a slice for his hot dog, loved it. I used it for french toast this morning, and it was fantastic! Now we'll be having this fresh daily - no more store-bought bread here!

What a relief to find a recipe that actually works in the bread machine!  Mine has been sitting on a shelf in my garage until today... This bread turned out GREAT!  It is light and flaky and delicious.  I highly reccomend it to anyone who is frusterated with hard, dense bread from the bread machine.  I am handing this out to all of my friends.  DELICIOUS!

Excellent! I was beginning to give up on finding a good basic white bread recipe. I tried the recipe that came with my machine and it flopped. It was dense and sticky and had a sweet flavor to it. I was worried about adding the ingredients against the directions that came with my machine (water first, then flour and yeast on top), but don't doubt it! It works! The only thing I changed was using olive oil because it's what I had on hand. This bread was light and airy with a perfecly crisp crust. I don't know if it will work with the rapid setting I have on my machine, but I'm going to give that a try next using the rapid rise yeast. This recipe is definitely a keeper in my book. Thanks!

My bread rose and then fell, so it didn't do as well as I thought it would.  It still tastes very good though., and I am going to give it another try.

I hate to write a disappointing review after all the praise for this recipe, but I didn't care for this bread.  It was dry in the machine and didn't incorporate into a kneaded ball--it was the first loaf I had to take out and knead myself.  The bread had an excellent consistancy and great crust but one thing lacked: a taste.  It tasted like pure flour.  Kind of disappointing.  I'm tempted to try this recipe again to see if it's any better, but as for now the only redeeming taste quality is the herbs and parmesan I sprinkled on top of the loaf the last 20 minutes of baking.  =)

I have to agree with the others. I've had my machine for years and just couldn't find the "right white bread recipe" This definately is it! I make the dough in my maker then shape,let rise and bake in my stone loaf pan. Try it. It's even better!
Thanks for sharing.

Very declicious!! I usually do on the dough cycle and then shape into loaf and place in bread pan. I then let it rise for 20-30 mins in warm oven and then bake at 350 deg for about 30 mins. very tasty and easy bread to make!

Used this recipe for my first loaf in a bread machine ever and it turned out fantastic!! I followed directions as written, except I did add an extra 1/2 tsp salt per reviewers suggestions. I was bit nervous because I wasn’t sure what size loaf to set my machine on (the recipe doesn’t specify) so I ran it on my machines default, which is 1 1/2 lb loaf. It turned out great!

Really impressed with the difference of letting yeast activate for 10 minutes, instead of throw in with flour. Excellent

Amazing results, I’m so happy thank you @SHECOOKS2 .  it’s the first bread ever to come out so soft and amazing..  my husband was shocked, poor man has tried my other ..that was a brick. The few things I change is the yeast to 1 1/ 2 teaspoon. And I choose light crust. Also I used olive oil only because I don't have vegetable oil.  thank you, thank you, thank you.

Easy recipe that makes a good looking loaf. I agree with the others that his recipe needs 1.5 teaspoons of salt for the best outcome.

Adding 1/2 tsp of salt made all the difference. Previous loaves were a bit dense and didn’t rise fully. When I added the additional salt, the bread rose to the top of the bread oven and the texture was great!

Turned out perfectly, I was *very* surprised to see that it came out so very light, fluffy and moist, as if I had baked it by hand.  I used bread flour and bread machine yeast as well as the extra 1/2 tsp of salt as suggested, and used the bread machine method of adding the yeast last into a little well on top of the flour (2.25 tsp).  I baked it in a Black and Decker 3 in 1, and put the machine on 2lb loaf, white bread setting and light crust. As I said, it turned out absolutely perfectly.  This will be my perfect go-to for a wonderful basic white bread.

I've made this recipe twice now.  The second time, I made a mistake and added Canola oil instead of vegetable oil!  That one bad review said not to use canola and I just did.  When the second loaf finally cooled and I got to taste it, I was shocked to find it tasted........exactly like the first loaf.  I take that back, it actually tasted a little better according to my family.  

So, don't take the advice of the reviewer who cryptically writes " Don't use canola oil, you have been warned." without any other information provided.   Use canola or vegetable and you'll enjoy the bread just the same.

This is the best and most versatile bread machine recipe you will ever find. It has tons of  excellent reviews. A few bakers had an issue with cratering. Several causes & solutions were given. Another cause of cratering may be humidity! I made a beautiful loaf in the morning and another loaf which cratered in the afternoon. The only difference was the morning was clear & during the afternoon it was pouring down rain! Apparently, a high humidity causes yeast to rise higher than in a low humidity environment. You must try the cinnamon raisin variation given previously by aliciaVR6 dated Dec 4 2007! It is positively delicious. Only change is I soaked the raisins in hot water for 10 minutes to soften & plump them.

This is an exceptional recipe! I made it countless times with consistent fab results! It actually replaced all my other bread machine recipes! I even made it with fresh yeast (I prefer it when it comes to bread making), whole wheat, every single time it turned out soft, airy and delicious! It slices to perfection, the kids throw slices in the toaster all the time, it doesn't crumble like other breads I've made. Sometimes a loaf would last three days before it gets devoured, and even after three days it is still soft and fresh, with a great texture. I never had bread left over longer than 3 days, but I think it would easily last 4-5 days if stored in a plastic bag. Thank you for this amazing recipe!

totally not an experienced bread machine user. i have only used mine twice. both with this recipe. the first time i tried with the extra salt like other ppl suggested. it was good, but my second loaf done -exactly- as the recipe was posted was much better. also, i used canola oil. i'm not sure why someone said not to use it, because they didn't say why. both loaves were made with canola oil and came out great. when i googled it to see why you shouldn't use it, everything i found said canola oil works perfectly fine in place of vegetable oil because it IS a vegetable oil (i prefer to use it because i'm allergic to soy and most vegetable oils use soy in them). the only thing i could find against it is that if you aren't used to canola, it can possibly have a fishy taste. so if you use canola oil in everything and are used to the taste, you should be fine using canola

This was awesome! It's the first loaf I've made that has been edible!(I'm a lousy cook) I followed someone's advice and added 1 extra tbsp sugar.   And also a little more salt.     I'm very pleased

This recipe is super easy and makes amazing bread!!! My family loves it and this is now my go to bread recipe. I make this every couple of days. I stopped using bread flour a while back, though, and it's still just as amazing with cheaper flour.

Great bread. We prefer half honey, half sugar, but it does make the bread a tiny bit denser. If your bread turns out really dense, use filtered water and increase salt to a heaping teaspoon instead of a flat teaspoon.

I have tried numerous recipes that have failed me.  I tried this once.  I set it to the 1.5 lb loaf, medium crust and it turned out perfect.  This is now my go to recipe and I made small changes every time from adding herbs, garlic and cheese, etc and still has turned out amazing.

My special education students used this recipe to test different brands of yeast for their science fair project.  The boys precisely measured all  ingredients then weighed them on a postal scale.  Ever loaf turned out beautifully and the judges loved the project!    (Oh yes,  one  yeast  brand did rise  higher than the others.)

I made this bread . I put 2 tsp yeast and changed the flour to - 2 cups bread flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour and the result was wonderfully soft bread. This is a great recipe.

This bread is everything you want bread to be sweet,  yeasty soft on the inside crusty on the outside. Doesn't taste like bread machine bread at all, taste like wonderful homemade bread.   My family went crazy for it and ate it all in 1 day! I've made it 3 times with the change of 1 1/2 t. salt as others suggested and all was fine.

Awesome! Made as directed but increased salt to 1 1/2tsp total. Otherwise didn't change anything. This was the first bread that I've made that could actually be used for sandwiches. Soft crust but darker than I would have liked so next time will use the light color option on my machine. Made about 10 useable sandwich slices!

Turned out light and airy and taste delicious.  The previous batch of bread I made, using the recipe that came with my bread maker, didn't rise enough and was very dense and heavy.  I thought my yeast was bad, but I used the same yeast for this recipe and it came out perfect.

Delicious!! I was afraid that it was going to rise out of the bread machine pan so before it started the bake cycle, so I dumped it into a loaf pan and let it rise. I buttered the top and baked it at 350 for about 20 minutes, buttered the top some more and baked for another 30-40 minutes. It was amazing!! Now I just use the dough cycle on my bread machine and bake in my oven. I guess it defeats the purpose of a bread machine, fix and forget, but at least I don't have to knead the dough by hand and make a huge floury mess! Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is not only super easy but absolutely delicious!
Have made it several times and each time it was perfection. The only change I made to the original recipe was to increase the salt to 1 1/2 tsp. and add 2 tsp. vital wheat gluten. The amount of ingredients are way too much for my Kitchen  Aid bread machine so I generally make the full recipe, divide the dough in half before the final rise and bake in 2 Cuisine Pro loaf pans. Tried substituting 1/2 whole wheat flour this time and it's our new favorite. Instead of 2 Tbs. white sugar, I used 1 Tbs. white and 1 honey, then added an additional 2 Tbs. honey with the dry ingredients. I also increased the vital wheat gluten to 2 Tbs. My husband is not a great whole wheat fan but even he enjoyed this. If I were making it for just myself, I'd probably use 2 C. whole wheat and 1 C. bread flour but regardless, it's a winner any way you make it. Can't wait to try a rye version. Thanks to the person who shared the original recipe!

Very much liked the simplicity of this recipe. The flavor was plain, but then again it's white bread! This would be good for sandwiches, etc. I used 1 1/2 t salt and 1.5 loaf size.

Buy increasing the salt a 1/4 tsp and using bread flour and bread machine yeast  and not prepping the yeast for 10 minutes worked a lot better than it did with my first loaf which was too dense and fell and turned to dough. Awesome taste and worked great with those minor adjustments.

I was so pleasantly surprised when I tasted this bread! I read through a couple of reviews prior to baking my loaf. I did tweek the recipe-I upped the salt by a half a teaspoon and the sugar by 1 tablespoon. It turned out slightly crusty and totally flavorful! Will make again and again!

Made it with a Magic Chef machine. Turned out perfect. Made it the second time with a tablespoon of flaxseed added, turned out a bit dry that time, maybe a bit more water would have helped. I added this recipe to the family cookbook , its reliable. Quick and easy thanks

I made this according to the recipe and it makes a very light and fluffy bread. I wish I had taken the dough out of the bread maker instead of letting it bake in there. It was good, but kind of bland, like supermarket white bread and I like my homemade bread to have a little more character. I will probably make this again but perhaps with some whole wheat or extra salt.

Will not disappoint. "Kid-friendly".  Great flavor and texture!  TIP:  Some of you are expressing concern over the loaf falling - try adding a tiny bit more salt.  The better answer to fixing this issue is to understand this:  The best way to BAKE ANYTHING is to measure by weight using the metric system.  We Americans differ from almost every other country in the world (except Liberia and Myanmar) in that we use the US Customary measurement system (based off the now defunct Imperial system).  The Metric System measures by weight which accounts for DENSITY.  Here is why that is important - for example:  1/8 cup of kosher salt is very different than 1/8 cup of fine sea salt.  That amount of kosher weighs 1.1 ounces, while the sea salt weighs 1.4 ounces.  The grain is different, the weight is different, the DENSITY is different,  and this affects all the other ingredients.  In baking, US Customary recipes fail far more often than metric.   The fix is to whip out your kitchen scale and start weighing your ingredients.  You will greatly increase your success rate.  Good luck.

I didn't have bread flour so I used all purpose flour.  It turned out great,  it is not as fluffy because of the different flour but it won't matter.  Very easy and DELICIOUS.  Thank you.

Not sure why some bakers find it odd that the warm water, sugar and yeast are put in the bread pan first for 10 minutes.  It's called proofing.  But the ‘hue and cry’ may be because the instructions for using bread machine yeast recommend that it be added last on top of the dry ingredients.  I believe  that the only purpose of bread machine yeast is for convenience.  I, personally, have never used it for any bread machine recipe.  I don’t mind the extra few minutes to let the traditional yeast proof - at least I know it’s alive.  When the yeast is foamy - about 10 mins - I add any other wet ingredients (e.g. oil), then the dry ingredients and process on the dough cycle.  I bake the bread in the oven (not in the bread machine).  That is how I made this recipe and I LIKE the outcome.

This recipe is great, because we typically have all the ingredients on hand.  Nothing fancy about it, but  good basic white bread recipe.

I vowed to make bread for my family in 2016 and purchased a bread maker. This was my 3rd and BEST loaf.  Sunk a bit on the top. However I substituted butter and didn't have the instant yeast. I think based on the substitutions and my experience level of ZERO this recipe rocks. Will make it again. Definitely a favorite!

Made it exactly as written and it turned out very good, just as described. However, I was hoping for the flavor of homemade bread and this was the flavor of any packaged white bread.  There's a certain flavor to a homemade bread that this just didn't have for us. Good recipe though - I'm going to use it for French toast, but I probably wouldn't make again.

This is the BEST bread I have ever made! Im not sure why a reviewer said not to use canola oil. I used it and it came out perfect and delicious! I do not bake my bread in the machine though. That's the only thing I did different, everything else was exactly as the recipe says. I mix it on the dough setting. Once done, I punch it down to remove air bubbles, roll and place into a greased bread pan and bake for 30-35 minutes at 350. Wonderful!

Just a small note, in culinary school anytime I ever made bread of any kind i always started with yeast and water, esp. With active dry yeast it must be activated. The "foaminess" is the yeast releasing gasses, the same gasses which make bread rise. I'm not sure if the same principal generally applies to bread machines.

I made it, and it was pretty good, and got me started but it got a lot better for us with the following changes: instead of 3 cups flour, use 1 cup sourdough starter, 2 + 2/3 cup flour, also added 2 + 2/3 tsp vital wheat gluten, increased to 2 tsp salt decreased to 220 mL water.  I use the french bread cycle on my charlescraft machine.  When I want to use the timer function on the bread maker I put room temperature sourdough starter on top of warm yeast/water/sugar mixture, then flour then vital wheat gluten and salt then substitute unsalted butter for oil putting the butter right at the top

This was by far the best loaf that I've ever made! Turned out awesome! Tall, soft & moist. I read the other reviews & figured I'd be on the safe side and added a pinch of extra salt. I also used olive oil as that is all we use in our house. I was also skeptical about adding yeast to the water as all other recipes go against it, but trust me, it works much better!!!!

Amazing! I made exactly as the recipe calls except I did not have bread flour so I used all-purpose and it came out great. I'm still in disbelief how easy it is to cut without falling apart and we cut thin slices!

This is my memorized go-to recipe. Makes the lightest bread with crunchy crust. The best. Some tips on my best loaf from this recipe: 
-More salt. I use a heaping teaspoon of good sea salt. It needs it for flavor and I've never had a loaf rise and fall.
-Do not use "bread flour." It's too glutinous and makes for a much more dense loaf. 
-Sub just a 1/2 cup white flour for white whole wheat. Gives depth and nuttier flavor without changing light texture.
-Add 3/4c cooked & cooled wheat berries. (Make sure you cook them until fully soft before adding- too chewy and they will re-harden while baking). They are sweet and chewy and add such a great texture component. 
-Do not use crappy vegetable oil. Yuck!  Using melted Ghee is THE BEST I think- Especially if you use your bread for toast or re-warm it. But I also love using nut oils- walnut, pecan or almond oils if I'm going to use the loaf for eating at room temp- like sandwich bread. The oils make for a softer interior at room temp.

Me and the kid made this today.  I followed a review on here's suggestion of using 2tsp yeast and 3Tbs sugar.  The first time I tried to make it the yeast didn't really foam up so I dumped it out, cleaned out the pan and dug out my food thermometer.  Once I made sure I was using 110F water, it looked much better.  Question if anyone reads this, are you supposed to stir the water, yeast, sugar mixture?  I gave it a quick stir before it started activating but I wondered what was recommended.  Bread is good, kid loves it.  Crust is a bit hard but I didn't know if I should put the machine to 1.5lb or 2lb so I put it at 2 with medium darkness of crust and it was a bit thick and dark...but more than likely that was a user error.  I will definitely make this again and try it with the bread machine set to 1.5lb and with a lighter crust.  We're still eating it with butter and jelly though!

It was strange putting the yeast and liquids in first and I was a bit skeptical however the bread turned out ok. Not great but ok. Mine seemed to be a little over risen and the center did fall a little bit, the crumb was loose and the crusty was really crispy. I think with a few tweeks this might be a good one.

I was afraid to make it as suggested as my bread maker book said to never proof the yeast. But, I followed the recipe to a T. Best bread ever! I think it might be a 1.5 lb loaf. My bread maker does both 1.5 and 2 lb loaves. Asbolutely beautiful bread.

I use only 2 T. Oil and another 1/2 t. Salt.  This is my favorite recipe. I have vegans in my family and this is their favorite. A family secret is to add a little flour when softening yeast. I bake this on the long or quick bake settings and it works every time.

Thank you, thank you and thank you for this wonderful recipe.
Wow, I could not believe what I got in my first try. Such good bread with wonderful texture. 
I did take other readers' suggestion later: reduce the yeast to 2 tsp instead of 2 ¼ tsp. Also, it's very hard to get bread out of my bread machine, I followed someone's suggestion that remove the blades before the last rising. It is perfect now.

The manual for my bread machine says do not let the yeast come in contact with liquids, but I tried this recipe and it is absolutely delicious.  The closest I have ever come to store bought from a machine.  One person said not to use canola oil and it is the only oil I had but the bread turned out wonderful.  This is the recipe I will use from now on to make bread.

This turned out so well! Going to make it again and use butter instead of the oil, and add a bit more salt. I followed these directions exactly to get great results. My yeast was brand new,  and that makes all the difference compared to past attempts  at using my bread machine!  This bread toasts beautifully, and has a really nice crust. Love this!

I've made this several times and it turns out great as is! I have substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil and I now reduce the yeast to 2 tsp. which keeps it from rising so much as suggested by another reviewer. I've used flavored olive oil several times and it adds subtle flavor.... Garlic is our favorite, but chili flavored also turned out well....perfect with pasta! My kids now ask if we can have my bread with dinner. Since I can preset the bread machine before I go to work, the answer is yes! Thanks for the great recipe.

Very good.  easy and fool proof.  I used all purpose flour because I was out of bread flour, and quick yeast - not the specific bread machine yeast.  I did proof it first and followed the directions.  I've made it too many times to count, this way and it has been perfect every time.  Excellent flavor. I do, most often, use something like country crock (its made from veg oil) in place of the veg oil, and I like the flavor a little better, but it absolutley is not necessary to change it.  I've even done half and half.  It's great no matter what. I want to try others, but I never do because it like this, and don't really want to take any chances.

We've made it 4 times and it's become our favorite white bread. Simple ingredient list.  You'd pay $4+ for this in a store. Enjoy the wholesome goodness and save some dough.

This is a great recipe. It's my go-to for a basic sandwich bread. I usually use about half bread flour and half white whole wheat flour. I also increase the salt to 1.5 tsp/8 g, per another reviewers suggestion. I've made this four times so far and had great results every time.

A great, versatile recipe. I have made this many times swapping out the oil depending on what type of cuisine I am cooking - coconut, olive and peanut.

This is an extremely easy recipe to follow. I did as one reviewer said and added another 1/2 tsp. salt. Also, I don't do canola oil in anything. I used the Wal-mart brand light olive oil for baking, and this comes out perfect every time. In all honesty, I have yet to try any other recipe in my machine and this get made no less than twice per week. My family loves it!

Ok, despite there tremendous amount of positive reviews, I was still concerned that I would mess it up.  Nope!  It was awesome!  Really easy, and despite it goes 'against get instructions' (lego humor).... It was great! I had tried a few recipes from the book that came with the bread machine, and was disappointed, so I had put it away for a while... Glad I hauled it back out to try this recipe!

I'm a beginner in baking & the bread came out very fluffy!
I just got my very first bread machine & since the first bread came out chewy, I tried this recipe.
I'm happy that the recipe is so easy & my bread came out soft!

I was nervous about trying this bread.  Most of the reviews are glowing, but the bad ones are pretty bad.  I read ICYBLUEROSE's advice of increasing the salt to 1.5 tsp to avoid the bread rising and falling.  Decided to give it a shot.  Maybe 5 minutes into the cycle I drizzled in a small amount of water, to help the dough come together.  The bread did rise to the lid of the machine, but did not spill over.  That's the only negative.  The bread tastes good and has a nice texture.  My husband loves white bread, and is really happy with it.  The next time I bake this bread, I will try closer to 1.25 tsp salt, to see if that will prevent it from touching the lid. ~~~Thanks for the recipe!

I made this bread today in my bread machine and it's so delicious. I used rapid rise yeast, so I put the ingredients in per the machine's instructions. The loaf was beautiful with a crispy crust and moist and fluffy inside. I will use this recipe all the time.

Didn't have white sugar so used brown. Also upped the salt as one user suggested. This bread looked really nice for machine bread and tasted delicious with a nice texture. The loaf disappeared fast!

I made my own version based off of this recipe and other suggestions from reviewers. I used 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt, 3 tablespoons of sugar, 1 cup and 1 tablespoon of water, 2 teaspoons of rapid rise yeast, 1/4 cup melted butter, 2 1/2 cups bread flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. I selected 1.5 for loaf size and medium for crust. This is my first ever loaf I've made and it is dense in the bottom and more airy in top. Any suggestions for it to be more dense throughout, rather than airy on the top part of the loaf?

I'd give it a 4.5 It tastes really good and is good for sandwiches, there's just something I can't put my finger on that's 'off' about it. It's good enough to where I've been making it every few days and I'm starting to change a few things to see if I can make it perfect for our family.

Although the instructions go against the machines instructions of yeast last, this was the best I've ever had from a bread machine. Very soft & light. 
As per other reviews I did put in 1.5 tsp of salt to ensure it did not rise too much and fall.

This was the second bread recipe I made after getting a breadmaker.  The first was very dense.  This one was light and tall, will definitely make this one again.  I used 1 1/2 tsp salt and set my maker to 1 1/2lb loaf.  I used regular active yeast and not instant or breadmaker yeast.  I also used sunflower oil.  Thanks for a great recipe!

At the suggestion of others, I added extra salt (I used a heaping tsp as opposed to the regular tsp called for), and it turned out almost perfect. Only a tiny bit fell in the center. The reason for 3 stars instead of 4 is that it had an aftertaste of vegetable oil. Very strange. I think next time I'm going to use butter instead of oil, and subtract a Tbsp of water, see how that works out :-)

Thank you! I had all but given up on my bread machine before trying this recipe! It's just as the description says, soft on the inside and crisp on the outside.

This was easy and turned out great.  Much better than any other recipe I've tried.   Thank you, now I will actually use my bread machine.   As soon as this was finished baking I rubbed butter flavored crisco all over top and sides generously to make the crust softer and it's perfect.

I have tried countless recipes from this and other sites and this recipe makes the least dense, flaky bread I've found. I did up the salt to 1&1/2 teaspoons as suggested by another member and it makes it even lighter. Thanks for the recipe. It's our go to recipe for everything now.

I needed to add an additional 1/2cup of water. I have to do this to all of my bread machine recipes, and it was required for this recipe too.  I also added 1/2tsp of salt.  Best loaf I have ever made!

The bread rose and baked fine, but it's just WAY too sweet.

Followed the suggestions to swap in 1/2 cup wheat flour and extra 1/2 tsp salt.   Also used canola oil instead of vegetable oil because that's all I had.  Don't be afraid to ignore conventional bread machine use and add the ingredients as stated in the recipe.  Amazing perfect bread!

Perfect! I made it exactly as written and it was perfection. Such a soft springy loaf and a nice crunchy chewy crust.

Best white bread recipe we've tried in 2 years of bread machine experience!!! And we've tried lots! Perfect texture, good shelf life (up to 4 days on counter), and simple taste perfect for sandwiches or toast. Freezes nicely too. Just cool completely and seal in plastic bag. :) I think this will make a good base for adding flavors - garlic parmesan or Italian herbs and cheese.

Simple and consistent. I've used this recipe three times now with no modifications. This bread has a crisp crust and the interior of the loaf is dense enough to slice for sandwiches. No annoying bubbles inside. This is now my go to recipe for a homemade white bread.

This was the first time I've used my breadman bread machine in years. I had tried using it a couple times years ago but it wasn't very good so it went to the back of the cupboard. I'm thrilled to have found this recipe and tried it! I only had canola oil so I used that and I did use 1 1/2 tsp of salt after reading the comments. Other than that I followed all the instructions and it came out great! I can't thank you enough for sharing this recipe! I am interested in eating healthier and when I found out some of the things they put in bread at the stores I was determined to make my own. I'm going to start experimenting with this recipe, use some other flours, sweeteners and get some quinoa in there. Thanks again!

This was the very first loaf of bread I have ever made. I used this recipe instead of the ones that came with my machine.  And it was AWESOME! It grew so tall that we had to cut it in half horizontally as it was double the normal bread height.  It was gone in less than 24 hours. Thank you for the recipe SHECOOK52 :)

Great bread recipe, with one slight modification. If you are weighing all of your ingredients and following the recipe exactly, your bread may fall. As another reviewer added, adding a half a teaspoon more salt will fix that problem. I've made lots of variations of this bread now and it's a keeper for us!

Try your bread machine again and make this recipe. Use a half teaspoon more of salt.  It will add more flavor and make it so it won't fall.  You will never buy bread again.   Simply delicious!

I recently bought my bread machine and have tested quite a few bread trying to get a good "sandwich" bread. This is by far the best one I have made! It has a nice texture, it's not crumby, it cuts well, it tastes good and the crust isn't to thick. I will defiantly be using this recipe again and again.

I have to admit I was sceptical about making this bread. I followed the instructions and to my surprise it came out perfect!!! It rose perfectly, the crust was perfect and very moist middle. I used the "medium" level for the crust on my bread maker. Defiantly the best bread I have made with my bread machine. And sooo easy!  I used regular all purpose flour didn't have bread flour still turned out amazing. Thank you for sharing.

Made for the first time today using an Oster bread machine.  The bread came out as advertised.  There was one minor problem.  The bread machine has three settings for doneness LIght, Medium and Dark.  Not knowing how this recipe would respond to these settings I selected medium.  When time was up the loaf was nearly white.  Since the bread machine did not allow the time cycle to be over ridden i.e. adding another 10 minutes to the baking cycle, I took the loaf pan out of the machine and placed it in my regular oven at 350 degrees for 10 minutes.  It came out a perfect brown color just as bread should be.

Other then that making bread in a machine is a simple as it can be.  Having made bread the old fashion way the machine takes all the work and time out of making home made bread.

The only down side of a bread machine is the paddle getting stuck in the bottom of the loaf.  Next time I do this recipe will place the machine on DOUGH ONLY setting.  Then will transfer the dough into a regular loaf pan for baking.  That will make a traditionally looking loaf.

The bread tastes great!  Nice brown crust with a wonderful light, soft texture inside.

BTW, did not use canola since one comment cautioned against it. Use safflower oil instead.

I saved this recipe before my bread maker died but I wanted to try it anyway. I didn't change any of the ingredients. I used canola oil. The method had to change of course. For those without a bread maker - this is how it can be done. Whisk the water, yeast and 1/2 cup flour together. Let sit for 10 mins. Add all other ingredients and in a Kitchen Aide, fitted with a bread hook ,  knead for 10 mins scraping the side of the bowl if needed. Wipe out bowl and drizzle with olive oil, place dough in bowl and turn to coat and let rise for about 1 hour. After it has risen form loaf and let rise again. Brush with well beaten egg and a little water. Bake. This was so moist and tasty. Thanks Shecooks2, this will go into our regular rotation.

I used a sort of amalgam of all of the different alterations I found in the comments here and the loaf turned out fantastic! Until now I've only ever used the recipes that came with my bread machine but the loaves were always really heavy and dense, and the top always caved in. Based on the reviews, this recipe seemed like the perfect antidote to my bread machine slump. I specifically wanted to use it for sandwiches so I used a bit of whole wheat flour to give it substance, 2 1/2 C of bread flour and 1/2 C whole wheat. I also added a heaping tablespoon of honey along with the sugar and, like most here, that extra 1/2 tsp of salt. The result was soft and light, slightly wheaty (not a word, I know), very mildly sweet, and held up PERFECTLY for my turkey sandwiches! My roommate raved about the bread all afternoon! I'm so glad to have this recipe and can't wait to share it with my family and friends!

Baked it today. Followed the recipe, but instead of bread flour used ordinary white flour. Turned out perfect. Used these settings: white bread, light crust, 500g, 3hrs 15min. Definitely the best bread so far baked in my breadmaker. Soft, fluffy yum yum! Will certainly do it again!

My first time using bread machine and making my own bread. This recipe is very simple for an amateur. I made it according to the original recipe. I have it in the bread maker as I am leaving this review.  I'll update later... Bread came out perfect. My husband was standing over it eager to slice into it. He wouldn't even let me get a picture first.

I Could not make a good loaf of bread using the bread maker instruction. So I put it way forever until I came across this new method of bread making.
It only turned out good once or twice in the past.

I used regular flower and went by the instructions using a packet of yeast, my machine is rated for a 1 1\2 loaf size. The bread ball when rotating was very dry and didn't look good, so I kept adding water or a little milk until it improved and stuck to the sides of the bread maker slightly in a soft ball. I kept an eye on this ,opening the lid occasionally to make sure it looked good until it went to the bake cycle. I looked through the top and watched the bread eventually rise and was just touching the top lid. Afraid the lid would open slightly with the force of the loaf , I put weight on the top of the bread maker. I figured if the lid opened even slightly the loaf might co laps. I saw the loaf stopped rising to the top when , it went to the bake cycle. It worked the top of the loaf did drop a inch or two in the end, but it turned out perfectly. I was really happy, will try the little extra salt next time , may not have to weigh down the top.
Wonder if this is why others are having problems with collapsing , maybe the loaf hits the top and cool air makes this happen?
Just a easy recipe to follow! I think it's time for a slice of bread.

Amazing bread. I have one of the cheaper bread machines and have had issues with the bread rising. I upped the salt per one reviewer to 1.5 tsp. Worked great. Even the hubby likes it...and he doesn't like bread machine bread.

Best results when I sprinkle yeast into the water after I stirred and dissolved sugar. Whisked flour and salt before adding to yeast mixture in bread pan. Top off with oil and set machine "bread color" setting to LIGHT.

Awesome!  After reading a lot of reviews, I made a few adjustments.  I used honey instead of sugar, 1 cup whole wheat flour with 2 cups all purpose instead of 3 cups bread flour, and I increased the salt to 1 1/8 tsp.  Delicious!!!  One more thing - someone said not to use Canola oil. I used Canola in my recipe.  I have no complaints and will use it again.

Great!  Have not been using much of my bread machine as I always the finished bread texture a bit hard and chewy.  By re-arranging the procedure makes a great difference.  The bread turn out soft.  I did not use the bread machine to do all the job.  After second raise, I took the dough out from the bread machine and bake it in oven in pullman's tin.  Thanks.

Easy to make and delicious! Might add some garlic or Italian seasoning to it next time.

A very good bread machine recipe. I often add garlic & onion powders (3/4 tsp each), 1 tsp italian seasoning, & 1c shredded med cheese. It's been my go-to for a successful result every time...unless I forget to insert the paddle!

The 'bestest' of all the zillion best recipes I've experimented with! I added a t of onion seeds and that gave it a nice earthy flavour.

I always use honey instead of sugar and a bit more salt. Be careful that the water isn't too hot. I've made this recipe once a week for almost 3 months and it's consistent and delicious! I sometimes sub a cup or two of wheat flour in, or olive oil instead of vegetable oil for variety.

Have tried a few recipes and this one is perfect. Best recipeI I've made, I did put it in a bread pan and baked in the oven @ 350° after letting it rise again for 45mins in the pan.

Absolutely wonderful, this is actually the same as the Amish Bread Recipe but made for the bread machine. Adjust the sugar to your taste. The first time I made it I used 1/3 cups sugar and it was very good. I think I will use less the next time I make it. Very tender and yummy. I don't think I will buy bread ever again.

My first loaf of bread in my new bread machine and it turned out so much better than I expected. The crust was a bit tough so next time will adjust that setting.  Way better than store bought bread that tastes like it is full of additives and usually stale. Very easy!

Made this last night, couldn't be easier!  Just got a bread machine a month ago and this has been the best bread thus far.  My husband he wouldn't know it wasn't store bought.  I read the other reviews and substituted 1/2 cup wheat flour for a 1/2 cup of the bread flour, and also used Olive Oil.  Followed directions instead of recommendations from my bread machine.  This will be our go to sandwich bread, thank you for this recipe!!

Consistantly good, I'm not even going to try any modifications!

I live in Hawaii, where a decent bread costs $7 per loaf...I'll be making my own bread from now on.

Bread rose nicely. I agree with getting a kick-start on the yeast. The cautionary tale of yeast not touching wet ingredients is great for delayed baking. Easy to make but for me and my family, a little flavorless. I could taste the vegetable oil too much. I tried a few times with different oils; canola, blended vegetable, and extra light tasting olive oil. All really came out the same having too much of a cooking oil taste.

Made this for the first recipe trying out my new bread machine.  This is definitely going to be a family favorite.  So easy and the bread comes out softer than what you buy in the store.  I am excited to try variations of this bread!

This recipe was so much better than the ones that came with the machine.  It was very easy to make and was a huge with with my family.  The crust was firm and the bread nice and soft.  Will definitely be making this over and over!

I'm SO glad I found this recipe. I received a bread machine for Christmas and have been having trouble with the provided recipe. Bread was rising too fast resulting in a deformed loaf, also bread was VERY dense. The bread resulting from this recipe came out PERFECT!

Well this is the day after I made this bread & I just had to come back. Still a winner. Perfect for sandwiches & toast. I'm still amazed at the results. I guess I came back more for the folks who had problems with this recipe to urge them to try again. It really is a fantastic recipe. Best ever from my Bread Maker.

A very good white bread recipe.... I use medium crust setting and it always comes out GREAT and it's quick and easy. My whole family loves it they would rather have a sandwich with this bread then anything else. I haven't changed anything about the recipe.

Great recipe, but I made a couple changes of my own. Instead of 3 cups bread flour, I use about 1 cup whole wheat flour and 2 cups bread flour. While the machine is still mixing the other ingredients, I add about 4 Tbs of cinnamon and about 6 Tbs of honey. Local is best is you can find it. If not, I like Clover honey. Since honey is thick, sticky and hard to work with fast, I get that measured and poured into a small wide mouth jar or bowl ahead of time. It turns out great, and the addition of the wheat flour, cinnamon and the honey, gives it a little more healthy kick to it. Naturally those additions make it a sweeter bread, but I've not found it to be unsuitable with any dish I've made so far. Give it a try! Just beware that the delicious smell while it cooks may drive you crazy. lol

I don't review recipes on here often, mostly because I end up "tweaking" the recipe.  With this bread however, I did absolutely nothing to it AND IT IS AMAZING.  I have this bread going all the time now, whether it is in my machine, rising or baking (sometimes all 3 at the same time), my dh and 17 yo son eat this CONSTANTLY!!!
I have also found it to be a VERY forgiving recipe, for those days I am super busy and add too much water, or let it rise for 2 hours instead of 1.  I have found that I prefer the bread with 1/4 of melted BUTTER instead of oil.  I also just make the dough in my machine, then pat it into my loaf pans and let it rise til doubled and bake at 350 for about 10 mins.  Another quirk of mine (from my Gramma), is that I always put a pan of water in the oven when I bake bread.  I also brush the tops of the bread with melted margarine OR butter right before I pop them in the oven.
Seriously, give this recipe a try, you will not be disappointed!
BIG THANK YOU TO SHECOOKS2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Really like this bread recipe.  Used olive oil and mixed multigrain and unbleached white flour.  I used the dough setting, took the dough out and kneaded it before putting in loaf pan.  I let it rise again befors baking at 350 for about 30 min.  Rises pretty high (can't fit in the toaster) so I used a longer loaf pan and it can out great.  Will use this again and again.

Wow, wow, wow! We are weaning our family off of processed foods (I know, I know- white flour here, but it is a process m'kay?) and I was looking for bread machine recipes. This one got so many rave reviews that I had to give it a try.

I used honey instead of sugar (baby steps), but otherwise made the recipe with the recommended ingredients. I did take the dough out and bake it in the oven (gave it a more user-friendly shape). I can report that the bread turned out as-promised. If I sliced it thin enough, no one would believe that it was homemade (except for the heavenly taste). If I can find a similar recipe in whole-wheat, I will be in heaven!

I don't have anything to compare this to because it was my first bread machine experience and first sandwich bread to ever make....It was DELICIOUS!  I used all of the exact ingredients except for the oil I substituted grape seed oil.  I followed my breadman bread machine manual and added the salt and wet ingredients and then the dry minus the yeast.  I put the yeast in last, not touching the water and used the medium crust, 1.5 lbs loaf and basic loaf settings.  The machine did all the work and my husband wanted to eat the whole loaf.  My four year old son ate a half PB&J with it no problem.  I will be passing this recipe along.

Fresh yeast, fresh flour, followed recipe exactly.  Another dense, small loaf - a "brick" best describes it.

I love this recipe, this is by far the best loaf of bread that has ever come out of my bread machine. I did follow the suggestion of increasing the salt to 1.5 tsp, and increasing the sugar to 3 tbsp. I am extremely in love with this recipe

This is my go-to basic bread recipe.  I have make this recipe or a variation thereof 2-4 times a month for 3 years.  Two things I always do with it are temp the water and proof the yeast.  There's nothing worse than waiting 3 hours for delicious fresh bread, only to find that it didn't come out right!  Those two steps prevent that from happening.  Other than that, I frequently do substitutions and variations.  This recipe works fine with all-purpose flour.  I've also substituted a cup of whole wheat flour for one cup that the recipe calls for and had it come out great.  Other substitutions:  brown sugar or honey for the white sugar, olive oil, soft butter or margarine (one time, I even used bacon grease) for the veg oil.  You can also add herbs and/or cheese to this recipe.  If you add cheese, though, it's best to take out a little bit of the water due to the moisture in the cheese.  Too much moisture can make the top of the loaf fall.  Overall, this is just a great recipe, both on its own or as a jumping off point for creative variations.

I have been using this recipe 4 times a week for over a year now.  Amazing results and I am never dissappointed.  Throw out the recipe that came with your bread maker!  I make this on a dough setting, quickly knead the dough in my hands, throw into greased pan, let rise for about 40 minutes in slightly warmish oven,then bake at 350 for half hour or so.  The possibilities are endless for cheese bread, raisin bread, etc.  At first it seemed too easy and I was reluctant, but I am glad I tried it.  By baking it in the oven the house smells divine and you choose your crust color.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Print this out and tape it to the outside of your bread machine. Soft and fragrant.  The link to this was given to me from a friend. It is hers and my go to recipe for bread, rolls and cinnamon rolls. I won first place at the fair with cinnamon rolls with this bread. I got second place for my bread but I added almonds and honey to it. The judges didn't like that.

This recipe is perfect! It has a slightly sweet taste and a great crumb. I used Rapid rise yeast and set my machine to its rapid 1 hour setting which has only one kneading cycle.

Great recipe!  Tried this when I bought my bread maker.  I had tried one of the recipes in the book, with horrible results.  This method makes MUCH more sense to me.  Thank you for sharing.

Just tried this recipe using all purpose flour and it turned out very good.  After reading numerous reviews I added 1/2 tsp of salt to the 1 tsp recipe called for.  I will definitely keep this recipe on hand.  Plan to make again using different ingredients, i.e. wheat flour, etc.

My first time this bread turned out perfect! Everyone loved it, and so here goes my next loaf! TIP: make sure you do the extra 1/2 teaspoon of salt. 
I want to make the cinnamon raisin bread next! I think I will try to make a loaf everyday! At least I know what is in this bread, not sure what is in the bread at the store....

I made this a couple of days ago. It turned out really well and got rave reviews. The only thing that I will do differently next time is to use butter instead of vegetable oil. I didn't have problems with the bread rising then falling like others have said. This is very good bread and it didn't last 24 hours in my house.

This recipe is slightly too large for the Zojirushi mini. It hit the top of the lid so the crust was not browned or completely cooked there but other than that, it was fantastic. So if you have a mini you'll either need to adjust the ingredients or pop it into a bread pan for the second rising then finish in the oven. I may play around with both options.

I also made the following adjustments per other reviewers' suggestions.  I used 2 generous tablespoons of honey instead of sugar and 2 tsp. active dry yeast (regular) and a slightly heaping tsp. of salt.  After the yeast softened and before adding the flour I added about 1 T. of firm butter to the liquids, and 1/4 cup organic high oleic sunflower oil. Then I added 2 cups of bread flour, 1 cup sprouted wheat flour, 1 T. powdered milk, and the salt.

Delicious. Soft on the inside and perfect flaky crust with a lovely and tasty texture/flavor like nothing I've ever had from a bread machine before. The recipe seems fairly forgiving making it amenable to alterations and substitutions. Way better than the recipes that came with my machine. Not even in the same league.

This recipe was successful for me the first time out. It made a nice sandwich bread. I followed a reviewer's suggestion and reduced the yeast to 2 teaspoons and increased the salt to 1 1/2 teaspoons, which worked perfectly. My bread machine, like others, says not to let the yeast touch the water, but I followed the directions here - letting the yeast dissolve and foam for 10 minutes in the warm water before adding the other ingredients - and it worked! 

I'm making it again tonight. Thanks for the great recipe! (And it's so much simpler than the bread recipes that came in the bread machine manual.)

This is hands down the best bread machine recipe I've tried. I've tried quite a variety, and this takes the cake.

After a bit of trial and error, I've made the following changes:
- You do not need to dissolve the yeast for ten minutes if you are using bread machine yeast
- I've adjusted the salt to 1 1/2 teaspoons
- Instead of three cups of bread flour, I use 1 1/2 cups of both white and whole wheat flour (just to make it a bit healthier).

Before I made these small modifications, it was still the best bread recipe I've used, just a little inconsistent. Now, it's amazing bread every time. Thank you!

My first loaf using my bread machine I followed the instructions exactly and got a horrible dense uneven loaf of bread. Went on-line the 2nd time around and found this completely different method and decided to give it a try. Much better! The third time I warmed the water to 115 degrees because it didn't "proof" as much as I thought it should and it turned out even better! Will absolutely use this method every time! Thank you!

Best recipe I've tried yet!  We recently received a Breville breadmaker as my husband LOVES bread.  First few tries were disasters and he told me to throw the machine away.  Seeing that this recipe is preparaed completely opposite the "rules" of the breadmaker I figured I had nothing to lose.  It was so good that my husband ate half the loaf in one sitting and raved about it.  I did it on the medium crust setting and would try darker crust next time but the texture was perfect. I used olive oil and it gives a great flavor

This bread tasted good and had nice texture, but my loaf collapsed during baking, which suggests there was either too much yeast or too much liquid (or both).  The obvious remedy is to reduce the oil to 2T and the yeast to 2t... which just happens to be the same as the default basic recipe supplied by the manufacturer of my machine.

This bread is great! It's the only recipe we use in my house, we've tried three or four others and it's the ONLY one that ever comes out! A nice variation - try two tablespoons of fresh honey in place of the sugar =]

I had good success with this recipe, adjusting for a 2 pound loaf and adding a bit more salt (2 tsp total).  I make a lot of bread but normally with a Kitchenaid mixer, and typically add a little oil.  I never used as much as is called out in this recipe.  I believe it is the oil that makes this work so well for the bread machine.  I played around with my machine (and older model Toastmaster Bread Box was given to me) and couldn't get bread to work out too well, it was too dry and always concave on top.  With this recipe the top was good and the bread soft.  I will have to dig out my really old R2D2 model and see what I can do with that one!

This recipe is terrific and the crust is just perfect.  The loaf has a wonderful texture and taste really good.  I just tried the cinnamon and raisin version and I am in love.  I added crushed pecans, 2 extra tbsp of sugar, 2 tsp of cinnamon,  a tsp of almond extract and 1/4 tsp more of salt to this recipe.  Oh, my the smell from the breadmaker was absolute torture.  I had to leave the house because my breadmaker is so slow.  I felt like an addict waiting for a hit.  Or a kid waiting to open gifts on Christmas. So worth the wait.  The taste was delectable.  This recipe will not dissapoint.  Oh, and stick to the vegetable oil for a better crust.  Tried canola oil previouly, but I feel the crust was so much better with the vegtable oil.

My family likes this bread. I am new at this and it turned out great. I have made it as in the recipe and it came out great. So I have also used 2 cups all purpose flour and 1 cup whole wheat instead of bread flour and it turned out great too. I also used canola oil every time without an issue that I know of.

This does a great basic bread that is very cheap to make. However I did find that I had to add an extra 1/4 cup water to get the right consistency. That might be due to my high elevation in Utah though. Once I got that solved I played with it more. I added garlic and cheese to one loaf, italian herbs and sundried tomatoes to another, and my favorite, cinnamon and chocolate chips. This recipe is now the main one I play with to make fun new types!

Oh wow!  I've never had such success with making bread, this was fantastic!  I followed exactly except that when I checked it half way through the cycle to my surprise it had risen so much it was touching the lid!  So, I took it out, punched it down and then let it rise again in a loaf pan.  I baked it at 400 for 20-22 minutes and it was perfect.  I have made a second batch now but used butter instead of oil and am making it into cinnamon swirl raisin bread!  BTW

Best bread I've made in my machine EVER, hands down!  Followed the recipe to the letter (and I did use canola oil, but it was mentioned in one of the two-star ratings not to use it, but no problem here!), and added nothing extra that was mentioned in the reviews...no problem!  I've also had trouble in the past with my crust being too hard and thick, but not with this recipe...the crust was as good as the rest of the bread!

This is so easy it's rediculous. Even though my machine says to add the liquid last I made it exactly the way the recipe is written putting the yeast/water/sugar in first and letting it proof before adding the remaining ingredients. Results...bread that is light and delicious.

If you want a basic, bakery style white bread then this is the one to try.  This was not the first time I have placed the yeast in the water before adding the other ingredients. No problems with rising at all. Perfect texture on the inside, flaky crust on the outside. Will make again and again.

Soft and delicious!  My whole family loved it.  I used regular yeast, then shaped and allowed to rise another 30 minutes or so after the dough cycle finished on our machine, then baked at 350 for 25 - 30 minutes.  We're looking forward to trying variations of this substituting wheat and/or rye for some of the flour.  Thanks!!!

Wow! for being so simple its delicious.  i followed the recipe to the T except i did add the extra 1/2 tsp salt that was recommended.  the only problem i had with the recipe is that i wasn't sure if it was a 1.5 lb loaf or 2 lb.  i hit the 2 lb button and it came out great.  everybody was fighting over the crust.  the 4 of us ate almost the entire loaf with dinner (jambalaya), and i'm working on the second loaf for the day.  great recipe, thanks!

Ilove this...I have changed it so I use this for a base..  I have replaced the sugar with  Honey.   Start with 2 Tbsp. with the yeast.   Then  I add   1 cup of white flour and 2 cups of wheat along with  1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup of honey.  Add these when recipe tells you too.   Wheat settings  Med this is a family   favorite.   Enjoy

Best bread machine recipe for the kids - replacing my store-bought sandwich bread with this!  I modified recipe - swapping 1 cup of white flour for whole wheat. I tried replacing sugar with honey... but the loaf fell.  I might try more salt as one of the other reviewers mentioned.  I even added some ground flax in - the kids gobble it right up!

This was the first bread I tried in my new bread maker and I was highly disappointed. Granted, it was the first bread I've made, and I could have messed things up because I didn't know better, but I followed the recipe to the letter and it came out hard, lumpy and tasting terrible.

It only got 4 stars because I made some alterations.  I used butter melted instead of oil.  I also added one egg to help bind all the ingredients.  Also for those who are using bulk yeast one package is equivalent to 1 heaping TBSP.
Happy baking!

Hi All, I saw this recipe last night and decided to pull out my bread machine and give it a try.  I put my bread machine away for about 2 years now because I've been so disappointment with the final outcome each time I make a loaf of bread it turns out like a hard, flat and tasteless dry brick.  This time I read all the reviews first and followed the recipe exactly as stated and the bread turned out really great tasting very nice and sweet but still very flat and did not rise the way other people seem to get their bread to do. My bread only rises to the mid section of my machine, can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong?  I could really use some help.  I love the recipe, I used the bread flour plus I added 1/2tsp extra salt even thought the bread flour has salt already in it because I thought that would help plus I used the 2 1/4 of yeast.  Why does my bread not rise?  Why does my loaf look so ugly and small?  any help would be greatly appreciated as I'm ready to put my bread machine  in the garbage bin this time rather then the closet. thank you.

I used 1 c Whole Wheat, 1/2 c of White, 1/4 c ground flax, 1/4 c wheat germ, 2t yeast, 1 1/2 t of salt and it came out very nice, it didn't rise very high like the other people said but it was soft, fluffy and just the right amount of sweetness and oh yeah I put abt 2 T Honey instead of the sugar. Maybe, I'll use less (?) yeast and it will rise higher (?).

This loaf of bread was amazing the kids had it gone in 2 minutes. I did add an extra 1/2 tsp of salt like someone else said and buttered the top while it was still hot.

Some of the best bread I have ever made in a bread machine.I always thought it should be made this way but never tried it.I also changed a few things like the salt to 1&1/2tsp and I used extra virgin olive oil.I will try it with the veg oil and I want to try to make some wheat bread.

Pulled out my bread machine for the first time in over 5 years. Couldn't find my manual so looked for a recipe. My husband doesn't like wheat bread so I found this easy-looking white bread recipe. I did follow suggestions from one reviewer, increased sugar slightly to 2.5 T and decreased yeast from 2 1/4 to 2 tsp, and substitute 1/2 cup of wheat flour for 1/2 cup of the white flour called for. It was simple to make and delicious! Not too heavy, but also not all airy and squishy. both my picky daughter and my wheat-hating husband loved it! Will be making more of this. May try adding some honey next time.

This recipe was my first successful bread recipe! However, my husband pointed out that he would have preferred the loaf to be a bit more sweeter so I decided to try it again with double the amount of sugar (the extra 2Tbsp was added later along with the dry ingredients). I also included milk by switching to warm water(3/4 cup) and liquid milk 1/4 cup(lactose-free)mixture. My first bread went flat at the top toward the end of the bake cycle, so I added an extra 1/2 tsp as suggested by icybluerose user. Bread came out great!

Loved this recipe :) I had several previous trials with my bread machine that were all complete failures! This recipe is simple and very good. I followed it in the exact sequence and it worked very well. Bread was light, fluffy and very tasty :D used honey instead of sugar, all purpose flour instead of the bread flour, and 1.5 tsps salt. Next time I will try adding a tsp of vinegar, as I read once that it helps the bread last longer and doesn't affect the taste. I definitely recommend this recipe :)) Thank you!!

Best bread machine bread...hands down.  I made this loaf today after using a "box" mix earlier this week.  Oh my word, this bread is light, crusty and the best I've ever made.  This one's a keeper!  All I can say is pass the butter please!

After several failed attempts at making bread in my bread machine I tried this recipe last night & it turned out great!! I followed the advice of another reviewer & added an extra 1/2 tsp of salt. My family scarfed down almost a whole loaf to go along with the Italian sausage soup that I made. Thank you so much for such a great recipe!

I am new to bread making with a machine. My first two attempts had the bread fall. I read that increasing the flour by 1/2 cup would work, and that works great for me. With this recipe, I followed someone's advice and added 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour to the mix. The bread turned out great! I softened the crust after baking by rubbing with top with margarine and sliced the loaf evenly with my electric knife. This bread is excellent for making toast.

I used this recipe to test out my new bread maker.  It definitely works great!  It does taste almost exactly like wonderbread, which for me isn't a good thing.  I'm not a fan of white bread.  I gave the loaf away and they thought it was great.  I wouldn't make it again, but for those who are looking for a simply white bread recipe or are new to having a bread machine, this is it!

This bread recipe was amazing! This is my new go to recipe for my bread maker. The only substitute I made was unbleached flour in place of the bread flour.

Very good flavor, and very easy! My only tip would be, DO NOT use olive oil. I didn't have vegtable, so I used olive the first time I made this. It turned out oily and tasted like olive. But other than that, VERY GOOD BREAD!!

WOW! PERFECT! The Best recipe I got to make soft, fluffy and crusty light bread in a bread machine.  Really, it was heavenly in the mouth toasted with butter and cheese on top... yum, yum, yum. I could finish the whole loaf. I followed the recipe very closely, incorating some of the suggestions from reviewers.  Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Best and easiest bread I've ever made.  I take it out of my machine and cook in a loaf pan in the oven because I don't like the size and shape my machine makes.  I use honey and melted butter instead of sugar and oil.

I am new to bread making and bread machines, I have been very disappointed with the quality of bread so far. This recipe is completely against the bread machine process. It is absolutly amazing!!!! It came out perfect even though I used all purpose flour and quick rising yeast. The only thing I changed was using an extra 1/2 tsp of salt. My Husband said this is the best bread he has ever had. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Used a half cup wheat flour instead of white
Used 2 teaspoon bread machine yeast instead of 2 and a quarter (expired so use 2 and quarter)
Add dry italian herbs to water.

This bread is excellent. BUT, it did take me a few times to get it right. One of the things not mentioned by other reviews is that if you are using yeast that has been refrigerated, you must let it come to room temperature before adding to other ingredients. I also had to add an additional 1/2 tsp salt. I still may try to tweak it to get it just right, as I am still not getting the proper rise. This may be because I am baking at altitude. But the flavor and the lightness of the bread is fantastic.

Just what I was looking for. I found if I add about 1/8 extra water plus 2 tsp of gluten to the flour it comes out perfect each and every time. I only use the bread machine to make the dough then put in pan, let rise for an hour or so then bake at 350 for 30-35 min.  perfect every time
Did a double batch, works fine but overflowed in my 3lb bread maker.

The bread came out really nice.. soft with a slightly chewy crust. I added some sunflower seeds, black sesame seeds and flaxseeds and it was absolutely yummy. This will be my new white bread staple from now on.

Best bread machine white bread recipe EVER! I was out of white sugar and oil, so I subbed light brown sugar and melted butter. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I ended up with a perfectly risen, soft loaf of white bread with a flaky, light brown crust. Did I mention it was DELICIOUS?!!!! This recipe is a keeper!!!

This is the best recipe that I have found.  Simple, easy and tastes great.  The idea of putting the water and yeast together in the beginning takes a little getting used to.  But...it turns out better this way!  I upped the salt to 1 1/4 tsp to stabilize the yeast and it was perfect.  Nice tall loaf that is very soft and flaky on top.  Good job!

Great recipe. One note, if you use all purpose flour, add 1 tsp or gluten per cup of flour. Makes great bread, fluffy and tasty.

It flies in the face of my bread maker booklet and is without a doubt the best loaf ever to come out of my machine. Texture is exactly what I've been looking for heartier than store bought but not overly dense. Makes out of this world French Toast and regular toast as well. THUMBS UP!!!

Great recipe!  I have made it about 8 times in the last couple of weeks with just a few tweaks.  I definitely think it needs at least 1.5 tsp salt, and I ended up adding a little milk the last few times as it seemed quite dry despite using proper measuring procedure.  Also, I have tried making it with all purpose flour and bread flour.  While it will work with all purpose flour, bread flour makes MUCH better bread.  If you do have to use all purpose flour, be sure to get the bread out of the machine soon after it's done, or you will end up with flattened bread.  If this happens, don't throw it away...just toast the soggy bottom slices before serving and it will still be pretty good.  For a twist, I also sprinkled a little instant coffee in the liquids before starting the machine for a bit of color and a slightly smokey flavor.

OH MY!! I may never buy bread again! This is the plain, old fashioned white bread recipe for my  bread machine that I have been hunting for! Nothing fancy, just good simple bread like my Mom used to make. Followed the recipe exactly as listed and was very pleased. Used the 2lb setting as this is the smallest setting my machine has.

Great recipe. I too was afraid of going against the manufacturer's recommendation of putting yeast on top. But after reading another review that said they tried it as written, I decided to try as the recipe is written. Turned out perfect. I used 2 1/2 cups white all-purpose flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat. It made a nice light wheat bread.

OMG! I made this recipe today, (LUBSY Version April 7/08)and although I have not sliced into it yet, it is the FIRST loaf I make this week (Just pulled out the old bread machine!) that did not fall when I put it into the oven. I can not wait to let my kids see that I am not a comlete failure with baking bread! thanks so much for the whole wheat version.  You should post it as a recipe for all to try. I cant wait to make the White version now too!

I have been making bread machine bread since the machines first came out.  I have tried probably over 100 recipes...this is by far the best and easiest recipe I have found.  I usually end up feeding the leftover bread to the birds, but this loaf disapeared.  I will be throwing away all my old bread machine cook books!!  This one is a keeper!

Have made this twice now. Once subbing 1/2c flr with whole wheat. This made it a bit denser but still delicious.  The white bread is so soft and fluffy, it filled the 2lb breadmaker. By far the best machine bread. I'll be making this at least once a week. Thank you so much!

I never had any luck making bread in my Black and Decker breadmaker machine.  i did everything what the instuction said but it made terrible bread lol. Until I used your Best Bread Machine White bread recipe and it turned out beautiful!, letting the yeast forment for 10 minutes and sugar and water . 

I wonder if I could make dinner rolls with the same recipe and use other flour like whole wheat and what bread setting would I use .  thank you Jane

Success at last!! This is the perfect bread recipe. After many failures I have made 3 successful  loaves in a row. The only changes I made were adding 1 tbs flour for each cup of flour because I used all-purpose flour instead of bread flour, I also added 1/2 teaspoon more salt. The 2 loaves I made just using the dough cycle then placing dough in a bread pan let rise and baking in my oven were better then the one that I let my bread machine do the whole thing, but they were all great. Thanks a lot.

Shocking! The first loaf didn't turn out so high, the second one was perfect. I made sure the water was a few degrees hotter than the recommended. Also, I turned the machine on so the paddle could mix the water and yeast together a few turns. I also didn't use bread machine yeast and my second loaf was nice and high, and not dry inside. Definate keeper.

I was hunting around for good bread machine recipes since I wanted to learn how to bake bread. Sadly, my bread machine sprung a leak and all my water leaked out of the pan into the machine.

But I still wanted to make this bread!

I used all the ingredients; as is. And I hand kneaded them in a bowl, let it rise, punched it down, flattened it, folded it up and put into a greased loaf pan. I then let it rise a second time. 

I preheated my oven to 350 degrees and let it bake for 30 minutes. Inserted a meat thermo and at 200 degrees, it was done. I let it rest for 10 minutes and then sliced into it (because I wanted to eat it, darnit!)

It was/is FANTASTIC!! Even my Husband loves it! I could not be more thrilled! I thought for sure since I didn't use a bread maker, somehow it wouldn't turn out. I am SO SO glad I went ahead and made it anyway!

I DO suggest that when hand kneading it, you do not put int he extra 1/2 teaspoon of salt. It isn't needed.

I have tried several bread recipes on allrecipes. This is my go to bread for daily use. I have made the recipe as is twice. I have made it with substituting 1 cp of the bread flour for whole wheat flour 4 times and substituted the sugar for 2 heaping tbs of honey. That is my favorite. I also have added 1/2 cp of flax seed to the recipe 3 times as a healthier alternative. I just keep making this same bread over and over again with minor tweaks just so my family isn't eating the same thing every day. Great recipe. This recipe also doesn't seem to dry out as fast as other breads I've made. 5 stars.... thanks! My family loves it.

I made this yesterday and my husband and kids loved it.  I got my bread machine for Christmas and had made a loaf from the recipe that came with the machine.  It was o.k. but not outstanding.  I also made the Cinnamon Honey Butter from this site. OMG!!!... Will be make another loaf today because my husband wants to take it to work with the Cinnamon Honey Butter.

Loved it for a basic bread recipe.  I am not very experienced in bread making, even with a bread machine. I followed the directions exactly and I thought it was great!  This is a keeper!

I just got Zojirushi bread machine and baked first white bread which we enjoyed. But as one viewer mentioned earlier, it was dense(it's ok by me)but got harder so quick.  So I found this recipe and gave a try this morning.  I used exact ingredients except I used 2 1/4 tsp  active dry yeast from the jar that I had(2 1/4 tsp=1 package) and olive oil instead of veg oil.
I also liked this recipe when I read it because it uses 1 tsp salt unlike machine recipe calls for 2 tsp.  The reason I wanted bake a bread at home started because most of store bought bread was salty or too sweet for me.

What a fantastic home made bread machine baked!!!!
Not only it looks tasty but was soft bread I have always dreamed of baking.  Unlike others mentioned that bread was too soft to slice,   my bread was soft but I sliced perfect slice immediately after taking out of machine with a ordinary bread cutting knife.  
It was the best bread I ever baked!!!
I am proud to recommend this recipe to anyone who loves to bake and eat it too.  
Thank you"shecooks2" very much for posting this recipe. I am lucky to say I found the perfect recipe before I make too many mistake.

This bread is delicious! I added a 1/2 tsp of salt and instead of cooking it in the bread machine I took it out after the dough cycle. I then put it in a greased loaf pan and let it rise for 30 minutes. I put it in a preheated oven at 350 for 30 minutes. It is so good! Now I have to try and not eat it all by myself!

Wow! Like many other reviewers have said, I've never had bread machine that tasted this great. This is my first review I've written on Allrecipes after a couple years of being on here, that's how great it is. It doesn't even taste like all the other dense and flavorless bread machine bread I've had before. I thought that was just how bread machine bread had to turn out and there was no way around it. This amazingly soft, airy, delicate, perfect bread is the answer to that. I do like a more yeasty flavor to my bread, and while this has more yeasty flavor than when I put the yeast in last, maybe I'll try a sponge in the future to see if that works. If anyone has done that please write your tips!

I found this recipe last night and I'm currently making my 2nd loaf, just as the recipe is written (and using olive oil instead of vegetable oil and the 1 1/2 tsp of salt everyone has recommended.) After that loaf I'm going to try someones recommendations of adding 1/2 tsp of each: garlic powder, oregano, basil and thyme; adding them to the salt. My first loaf was made at the 1 1/2lb setting, and it came out looking like a 2 lb loaf. I'm emailing this recipe to everyone I know who has a bread machine!

This is the easiest bread and best bread machine I have ever made. It even blows my mother's recipe out of the water and she was a professional baker for 15 years.
I usually just use all purpose flour and it still comes out great. This is one of those recipes that is so good as is it hardly needs any tweaking. I don't, however, prefer the way bread bakes in my bread machine so I remove the dough right before the final rise and transfer it to a silicone loaf pan. So good!!!

FABULOUS!  The BEST-EVER bread using our Dakota wheat products.  Followed recipe with addition of 1/2 t. salt.  Great because it is non-dairy, too.  ;o) 
Many thanks and hugs....Julip

In all the years I've had my bread machine, I've only used boxed bread mixes.  Now that I've tried this recipe, I'll never go back.  It's so easy and versatile--I've customized it to make it fit in with many dishes, but I mostly keep it as simple as this recipe.  I love it--thank you!!

Incredible!
This is the best! It really is! We ate half the loaf last night even though we were full from dinner! The best bread I have ever tasted from a bread machine! 
   Even though I goofed, side-tracked, forgot to put in the salt, and so the loaf collapsed, but it still was light and had a delicious crust! 
   I am making it again tomorrow with the salt.
   I was a bit worried, as I am near Denver, high-altitude, but no problem, it was great.

This bread turned out awesome! I didn't have bread flour so I added an extra 1/8 C of white flour. I used 4 T sugar and 1 1/4 t salt to help the yeast. I love the outcome with letting the yeast sit in the water .. turned out perfect! 
Now I'm going to make cinnamon sugar bread with this recipe .. hope that works too! :)

This recipe is delicious! I set my machine to 1.5 lb loaf and light crust and I got the perfect sandwich bread! The only hard part is not eating the whole loaf fresh from the machine! I did add the additional .5 tsp of salt that many recommended. Thanks!

I made this the first time following the recipe exactly, and adding an additional 1/2 tsp of salt, 1/2 tbsp of rosemary and some ground black pepper. I use olive oil in place of generic vegetable oil. The loaf came up light and delicious, as promised. I am making it again tonight. This will be my go-to recipe from now on. Proofing the yeast really makes a difference.

Very good! This was the very first loaf I made in my new breadmaker. I had to use regular dry active dry yeast and all purpose flour, since I did not have any bread yeast etc. and it turned out perfect. I had a hard time ignoring the instructions to add the yeast last, but you're right, it worked! Thank you for sharing.

Love this recipe.  Makes very light bread.  Even if you make it with 100% whole wheat flour, the bread will be lighter than any other bread machine recipe I have tried using the whole wheat.  It's amazing!

Best loaf of bread to come out of my bread maker yet. I use 1.5 teaspoons of salt to keep it from falling in the middle, perfect every time! Use olive oil and turn it into pizza dough or bread sticks. Use melted butter for pull apart dinner rolls. This recipe can be tweaked to make many different things, thanks for sharing!

Great recipe! I started it in the bread machine just to find that my bread machine doesn't work.I dissolved the yeast in 1 cup of warm water then added the oil and the mixed the dry ingredients together before adding to the water and oil.I put it in the kitchenaid mixer for about 10 mins with the dough hook..put it in a pre-greased bread pan and covered it with saran wrap and a towel and let rise for maybe a half hour and it had risen very nice.I baked it at 350 for about 40 -45 mins and immediately brushed butter on the top to soften it...it tastes wonderful and the top is nice and soft and the middle is very soft but nicely formed.Thanks for sharing!!

As others mentioned, my bread machine instructions suggest adding yeast as the last ingredient but it does mention that it's okay not to; that proofing the yeast will not affect the outcome. I'm not as experienced as some bakers here, but I have done dozens of loaves and was constantly experimenting with the bread machine.  I found that using the machine as the kneading tool to produce a glob of dough and then transfer it to bread pans works best for me. I had developed my own recipe based on this one, some others on this site and other sites and ultimately from the results of my "what-ifs"     
    1/4 cup warm water
    3/4 cup warm milk
    1/3 cup white sugar
    1 package active dry yeast (2-1/4 tspn) 
    1 egg, slightly beaten
    1/3 cup butter, softened or liquid

    3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
    1-1/2 teaspoon salt 

Combining the warm water & milk with sugar and letting it sit for 10 min gets the yeast started really well.  Subbing margarine or veggie oil for the butter works okay, but butter adds to the final flavor. I also add one egg which increases the total liquid content which is adjusted for with the increased flour.  Let rise for an hour (ish) and bake at 400 F for 12-15 min -- OR let the bread machine do the baking.

My first bread from scratch to turn out perfect. Dont know that I will buy bread from the store again! That was too easy. Thanks so much. I followed the advice to use 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt, might try it with just the 1 next time to see if it is still perfect! Also, i only added 2 1/2 cups flour because i had just scooped the flour into the measuring cup and wasnt sure if i had packed it too tightly. It  doesnt say whether or not to lightly place the flour in the measuring cup, being a novice at baking, i need every detail. Lol. Anyway, it rose beautifully. Just fyi,  I have 1.5 lb. bread machine and it took every bit of the space. Will be making this again.

This bread turned out amazing. I just found out my daughter is allergic to soy which is in everything, especially bread. I decided to make my own bread for her instead of paying extra for soy free. I made this recipe with canola oil instead of vegetable oil and it turned out just like I hoped! It's comparable to store bought except the flavor is much better. I am very happy with this recipe.

World if you haven't tried this recipe you are missing the very best bread ever. This is so fast and easy, i have made hamburger/hot dog buns, as well as dinner rolls. Skys the limit. 
I love the fact it slices so easy. 
You can add herbs, spices,garlic and once i used bacon with chedder cheese...yum. 
Really I gave this recipe 5 stars +++ in my own "pass it down" cook book.

This is a great and simple bread recipe for the bread machine! I absolutely love it and the only substitution I do is instead of sugar, I add honey because my family loves the slight honey flavor to the bread. It just gives it a little something more than sugar does. The house always smells heavenly when it is baking. There is just nothing like homemade bread!

I tried this recipe for the first time but used a tablespoon of yeast which I later found was too much. The bread rose high and fell slightly but other than that, it was a soft airy bread and is absolutely delicious. I will be trying this one again.

SValley-Putt:  Re: falling bread:  If you're using bread machine (instant) yeast, try using the QUICK setting.  Also, adding some Vital gluten in with the flour may help.  The gluten bag suggests 4 teaspoons.

This bread is incredible! So soft! My husband said it was too soft. Is that possible? There were no leftovers so I don't know if it stiffens up the next day. LOL. I added herbs to mine. I will never load my bread maker the same again. You just have to proof the yeast first.

Fantastic bread!  Goes against everything written in the instructions for my machine.  Turned out perfect!
Will try other suggestions in time to come but for now will savor every slice.  Guess I'll have to get on the treadmill more often - so yummy!!!

An excellent light, tender & flavorful loaf. This recipe is very close to the Foccacia (sp?) bread recipe I've used for years, which I use for loaves, soft bread sticks, pizza dough & sometimes hard rolls. The differences are: 1 Tbsp less of oil & sugar, bread flour instead of regular flour & the yeast isn't proofed in mine. My bread machine calls for the dry ingredients to be put in first, followed by the wet but this is easily solved by dissolving the sugar & yeast in the water & allowing the yeast to proof outside of the machine.

I didn't go by the directions for the order of the ingredients and got my usual o.k. but not good loaf of bread! Today I will try putting the yeast in the liquid as the recipe reads. I always did think it should be that way anyhow. lol. The flavor was good , it just didn't rise all the way.

I'm wondering if anyone has tried to make this on a delay timer and if so, did you add the yeast as the recipe states or did you add the ingredients as per the bread machine instructions?

I haven't tried this recipe yet......just giving the 5/5 rating so as not to screw up the average.

Thanks!

I used this recipe to make my very first loaf in a bread maching. I've done tons of loaves by hand but was intimidated by the machine. But it came out beautiful!! So simple and so good.
Adding the yeast to the water first makes sense to me...as that is how i do it when I make bread by hand. 
Thank you for this recipe!

This recipe worked very well for me and the bread was delicious.  I added a lot of chopped garlic and herbs from my garden (rosmary, thyme and sage), and I added a tiny bit of extra salt in hopes it would prevent the bread from falling.  However, I found the top of my bread got a little wonky, but it could also be because I used the "light" setting.  I far prefer a slightly fallen top with a soft crust! :)

I made this but I think I did something wrong. I only had coconut oil so I used that in place of the vegetable. I have instant dry yeast, maybe that is what went wrong but mine is quite short and didn't rise as high as I had hoped. It will make a good dinner bread but not a sandwich bread.

Thanks for a great brad machine bread.  This was a life saver.  I'm forced to use the machine being in a high desert area which doesn't provide my bread enough humidity to rise well in the fall and winter months.

I add 3/4 cups of flaxseed + an extra 1/3 cup of water instead of vegetable oil.  I also use sugar in the raw.  The loaf is amazing and has great texture, not to mention omega-3. Awesome

This bread if fantastic!  The only change I made was to use 1 1/2 tsp. salt, but otherwise followed everything else.  I have made 3 loaves so far and every single one has turned out perfect.  We can't get enough of this bread.  It is so much better than store bought bread, and so easy to make!  I am very happy to have found this recipe and to have home made bread from now on instead of spending $3/loaf at the store for bread that doesn't taste nearly as good.

If I can give this recipe a 10-star, I will. I have been baking this bread ever since I can remember. I had tried baking other breads before while I was looking for a good one to bake everytime but this one comes up trumps every single time!

Apart from the basic suggested ingredients and instructions, I also added the other suggestions in the the review like adding 1 and 1/4 tsp of salt. I also am not comfortable with cooking with my bread machine so after it finished it's job in the dough department I take it out and knead a little and rise it again to bake in the oven. What I did differently is that the moment my dough start mixing, I add a cup of either provel cheese or cheddar. When the dough comes out of the machine, risen and ready to bake, I slice the top a little bit then rub melted butter on top. I put it in the oven with a pan of water on the lower rack, bake the bread for 5 minutes, take it out and add some more cheese toppings or roasted sesame seeds. Black sesame seeds are good too. Since there are only two of us here usually in the house, I make 4 mini loaves instead one big one. Yesterday I made those little loaves again for a neighbour for his birthday. The whole family loves it! His son even took one home with him. That was the nicest compliment ever. I really love this bread. I am making a batch today for me and my husband as he loves having my bread instead of the bought one. Thank you so much for this recipe. We really love this one.

I got my first bread machine last week and this is the first recipe I tried because of all the reviews. I also added 1.5 tsp salt.  It turned out perfect!

I did add extra salt like one reviewer said but otherwise, did this exactly according to the recipe. Delicious bread!!! This is definitely the best bread I've made in my bread machine. THANKS!

I just got a bread machine, and I've tried this recipe three times. No luck! And I was so inspired by all the great reviews too. I will keep trying, but I'm a novice bread maker so I'm sure I screwed something up somewhere. Maybe it was the oil I used? Twice safflower and once olive - I don't use soybean or canola, your typical vegetable oils.  I'm only giving this two starts, and that's because of my three loaves, the one that was the best did really taste good. All three of them caved in, and I did increase the salt. One time I used honey instead of sugar, one time I thought the water wasn't warm enough....it's disappointing, especially when so many of the other reviewers so easily made modifications. I will not give up!

Okay...notes on loaf #4. Decreased water by one T, added one T of vital wheat gluten. It seemed to work. I left in the machine too long after it was done so the crust was a bit overdone for me but the rest of it is really good!

Very good bread, I made it again today, but i used butter in place of oil. 1/8 cup cold unsalted and 1/8 cup warm unsalted. Also I found that you can use the mix setting on your machine and add about 3/4 cup sesame seeds or poppy seeds and it comes out very nice.

I don't do it in a bread machine (don't own one), but, I have found this to be a good and simple loaf to throw together quickly. I mix it up in my kitchen aide, takes about 10-12 minutes from start to putting in it the bowl to rise. I do add in other grains to boost the nutrition value (ww fl, flax, teff, spelt, oats, barley, etc). Turns out well. I love that I can get it kneaded up and rising while I'm still getting my kids ready for school. It doesn't take a lot of babysitting, which is a definite plus for me!

Wow! This is the perfect recipe to replace store bought sandwich loaves! Softer and lighter than any bread I've made so far. I used the dough function and baked it in the oven in a more standard loaf pan (as per instructions given by another reviewer). I also added a little honey in addition to the sugar. This is a keeper!

A really nice loaf of bread! I have had hit or miss results with my breadmaker, but followed Icybluerose's suggestion and added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Rose beautifully. Makes delicious, crunchy toast. Thanks for the recipe and the tip re the salt.

I have always made bread by hand, but with a new baby, it was too difficult to find the time so I got a bread machine. I was so disappointed in the recipes that came with it. They did not taste good at all! I have made this bread as is and it tastes wonderful! I have also substituded honey for sugar and whole wheat flour for some of the white and it is almost exactly like my favorite recipe for bread by hand. I will be using this recipe a lot--especially since my husband and I just finished eating the loaf I made only a few hours ago.

I have new bread machine and couldn't find 1.5lb recipe until I found this. I read all the reviews and used 2 1/4 tsp yeast and 1.5 salt as suggested. I wasn't sure of crust colour, so I used light. The bread was very good, but fell when cooling. I think next time I'll use Med.or dark crust.

Wonderful recipe! I followed IcyBlueRose's suggestion to use 1.5 tsp of salt and haven't had an issue with the recipe yet.  It is simple in the bread machine but I've also taken it out and shaped loaves in stone bread pans and it turns out excellent as well!!!

Awesome recipe! The best bread I have ever made and I have made tons! The only difference I had was I did not bake it in the bread machine. I used the dough cycle, put it in a bread pan, put it in a slightly warm oven to rise for 30 minutes, bake it at 350 for 15 minutes and voila! The best bread ever!!!!!!!

This is the best bread recipe ever. I also added the 1.5 tsp. salt and it worked. I can't thank you enough for this. Have been searching for  recipe for years that would come out moist and stay moist. Its the one and only and I make bread all the time now. Thanks Sherrie

Delicious!!!  I took someones advice and used 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and 2 1/2 of bread flour and it turned out great.  I may start to increase the whole wheat flour each time.  Also a few others stated that their bread machine instructions says to add the yeast on top (mine does too) but this bread turns out perfectly!

Have made this bread several times now! It really is fool proof. The bread comes out fluffy and delicious everytime. Definitely do not skip the first part. Letting the yeast sit in the water makes all the difference! Thanks so much for the excellent recipe!

This recipe turned out beautifully. As others have done, I made some adjustments to fit my taste. I did half whole wheat pastry flour and half AP flour (didn't have bread flour on hand) and added 3 tsp of vital wheat gluten to it as well as increasing the amount of salt to 1 1/2 tsp as suggested by another reviewer. It was absolutely delicious!

I love using my bread machine but am not always a fan of the dense bread it makes. I LOVED this crispy, light texture for a change of pace. Especially fresh and warm, my favorite white bread recipe.

GOOD GOD - this is the easiest and best white bread recipe for a bread machine - EVER.  I make this bread twice a week and am now known in my neighborhood as the "Bread Diva".  If you haven't tried this recipe yet - please do - and follow the recipe to the T.  You can't go wrong w/ this.  Very impressive, delicious and perfect every time.  I set to light on the settings.

This is the first bread machine recipe I tried. I am not one to trust the product instruction manual. This bread turned out great! As others suggested I used only 2 tsp of yeast and added and extra 1/2 tsp of salt. This will definitely be my white bread recipe!

I was ready to stop making bread in the bread machine as I felt like all the recipes I tried were too dense.   Then I tried this recipe and I haven't stopped making it since.  It is soft and even when I substitute 1 cup of whole wheat for 1 cup of white flour it still turns out great.  Excellent recipe.

Yummy! My family loved it. I was a little nervous to add the yeast to the liquid but decided to give it a try. I want to try that trick with other recipes now! I did add a little extra salt and used half whole wheat flour and half bread flour. It came out super light, flaky and delicious. Thanks so much for the yummy recipe!

This was the best bread, as the title says!!!  It was high and the texture was light and fluffy.  I did exactly as it said except substituting 1 cp. whole wheat flour for 1 cp. white.  I did not have to tweak it as most of my bread machine recipes...(I usually have to add more water or more flour.  I am making this again...really SOON!

Super easy bread to make. I used the dough cycle on my bread machine, then rolled dough into a loaf pan and baked it for 40 minutes at 375 degrees F. Turned out beautifully crisp on the outside and light and fluffy inside. I will definitely be using this recipe again.

This recipe really lives up to its name! After reading the other reviews, I used 2 teaspoons of active dry yeast (instead of 2-1/4), and substituted 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour for the white bread flour. The loaf came out perfect - it did not hit the window, and was perfectly soft on the inside while crusty on the outside!

I have been making this for years, and it's the method (proof yeast in water) I use for all breads in my bread machine.

My machine makes a 2 or 2.5lb loaf.  I adjust the servings from 12 to 16 for a 2bl loaf.  Never fails.

I made the original recipe (12 servings) on the 2lb loaf setting once and it wasn't good.  Dense, didn't rise.  I wonder if the people who are having trouble are using the wrong recipe size for their machine loaf size?

I bought my husband a bread machine for Christmas and he has made 4-5 loaves of bread from the recipe book that came with the machine.  Each time, the bread would come out very dense so I had him try this recipe and followed it to a T.  The bread turned out to be so soft and the crust was nice and flaky.  Was absolutely delicious!!

This is a five star bread!  The crust is extremely tasty and the interior is wonderful.  I used this bread for sandwiches and to make dressing/stuffing for Christmas.  I am making my third loaf of this in a week.  I did add additional salt as other reviews recommended.

Really foolproof recipe. Great as-is, but the extra 1/2 tsp salt helps density. Works equally well with whole wheat flour. Also works well with agave nectar subst. for the sugar. We are at altitude and have a Welbuilt bread machine.

I love this recipe. The only thing is that I don't like to put so much oil in the things that I bake. So, I substitute the oil for light vanilla activia yogurt. Sometimes I also use half wheat flour and half plain white flour. My husband (who is definitely NOT a health nut) loves it and keeps asking me to make it! Good thing it is so simple to make!!!

If you have never been happy with a loaf of bread in your machine, try this one. I have had a bread machine handed down to me (B&D B1650). I have not been a fan of the texture of the bread from other recipes, however this one changes everything. I would like to tweak it a bit to get the calorie count down, but for now i will leave it as is. I did not think older or even all bread machines were capable of this soft and fluffy bread.

OMG i absolutely love this recipe! Best bread machine recipe yet!! I didnt have any bread flour, so i sifted my all purpose flour 3x. I also added 4 tablespoons of butter on the top before i pressed start. It was such  a hit at my house, i had to make another loaf! On the second loaf, i added chopped peppers! It was amazing!

A good basic bread recipe.  I think I needed more salt.  Mine tended to lack flavor probably because we are use to sour dough.  Next time I will add more salt.  It also could be that my bread machine isn't very good.  I rarely make bread in it because it turns out just ok...I usually just make dough.  I will try it that way next time and bake in oven to see if results are better.

I feel gutted, have tried this recipe twice now because of its excellent reviews and each time I have produced a heavy sunken brick, it rises beautifully and I get really excited and then it just falls to nothing during cooking.  What am I doing wrong?  I use the metric calculation and did it exact.  Please help, I want to produce yummy bread too.

EXCELLENT! I followed the recipe exactly. I've had problems with bread not rising enough, but this bread came out very light and high. Also, homemade bread usually gets stale very quickly, but this bread tasted better and had a great texture after a couple of days. Thank you for the fantastic recipe!!!

This bread was the best I ever made in my bread machine! I did as another suggested and used 2 1/2 cups of flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and increased the sugar to 3 TBS. (I added my own wheat gluten since I didn't have bread flour; 1 TBS per cup of flour) What an excellent loaf of bread! This is now the staple bread in our house!

This was perfect.  The bread is light and fluffy.  I made myself a panini with the bread, roasted turkey, sun-dried tomatoes, swiss cheese and fresh spinach.  The bread got nice and crunchy on the outside and stayed soft on the inside.  This is going in my rotation.

Well, this wasn't foolproof for me.  Followed the directions exactly, and the loaf fell in the middle.  I compared this recipe to the one in the manual and the only major difference is the amount of oil.  The recipe in the manual only calls for 2 Tablespoons of oil.  The bread tastes okay otherwise.

This bread is easily the best breadmaker bread I've ever tasted. It's soft and light, just like regular homemade bread from the oven.  After reading some of the reviews, I upped the salt to 1.5 teaspoons, and to counteract the saltiness, added 3 tablespoons of sugar. It was perfect!

This recipe is perfect! Every other bread machine recipe I've used has created a short, dense, heavy loaf that tasted decent. This one created a larger, lighter, and fluffier loaf which has a very pleasant flavor. It's so easy that after following the instructions once, I had the amounts and procedure memorized. I have made 5 loaves of this bread in the last 4 days (my mom stole one when she came to visit). I made it twice with honey and three times with sugar.

Like many others I was really hesitant to ignore the many warnings to not proof the yeast when using a bread machine. But I've been really bummed to not be able to make a light fluffy loaf for sandwiches, so I was desperate. I'm so glad I tried it! I don't cook with vegetable oil so I subbed olive oil, and I added 1/2 tsp of salt as recommended by others.   I set my machine to 1.5 lb loaf, white bread cycle, medium crust. It looked perfect at about 5 minutes left on the timer, so I turned it off. I have a perfect loaf, soft and fluffy inside, flaky on the outside. I was worried it would get smashed when I sliced it but as long as you use a nice sharp bread knife, it'll be okay. So happy to have found this recipe!

This is a really good recipe!  I, too, have a bread machine that says not to proof the yeast but to put it in last, but I read the reviews and went ahead and followed the recipe as written.  I made four loaves.  Two in the machine and two the machine made the dough and  I oven baked them. I much prefer the oven baking as it does give the nicer crust [not hard] and smoother insides.  This just could not be easier.  Enjoy!

Amazing! Thanks you! I was afraid to let the yeast dissolve and foam first, since I normally dont in the bread maker. But dont be afraid! It is great bread!!! I might have to try that on other variations because this is the highest bread I have made so far and I have been using this machine for 2+ years. Thank you for the recipe diggetydog.

An update to my post: I do NOT add additional salt, rather I am careful not to allow the salt to get into the yeast mixture before I start the machine.  I make a little cavity in the flour to add the salt - excellent results every time! great loaves!

I have tried a variety of bread recipes to find one with a rich texture, moist center, and sturdy crust - this recipe gives all of that AND tastes great! A new staple for my home to replace the additives and preservatives of store bought bread!

I can't tell you how this recipe has changed my thoughts on breadmaking! I bought a breadmaker and then tried a handful of recipes from the booklet that came with it.  They all sounded delicious.  The problem was that I had about a 20% success rate.  I would do the same things, with the same ingredients and get a different result. NOT WITH THIS RECIPE!  I followed it and it worked.  And it worked every single time.  Thank you for this!

This bread was really great! My 4 mo old daughter has a dairy sensitivity, and so I am having to prepare my own everything, and this bread hit the spot. I subbed olive oil for vegetable oil, and added 1/2 tsp salt based on other reviews. I then baked in the oven instead of the bread machine (because I have never made a good loaf cooked in the machine). The taste is wonderful, it will make perfect sandwiches and toast. I am planning to make a cinnamon loaf today, by adding cinnamon sugar at the end of the dough cycle when you normally add nuts and things. I am so happy to have a dairy free bread that is SO easy to make! Thank you for the great recipe!

We are not big bread eaters, but I was looking for something easy to make and this bread is it!  Don't be intimidated by going against the grain and proofing the yeast first, as this will not alter the end result.  I followed a previous reviewer's comments to use 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 2 1/2 cups bread flour, and I used 3 Tbsp. sugar.  This was the easiest recipe for bread I have found, and my kids asked for seconds (they never did before), so this will become a new staple in our house.  Thanks!

i followed the recipe with just one exception: i subbed melted shortening for the oil. the bread was heavy and way too yeasty (and i like yeasty bread). I made a different recipe in my breadmaker right after this one and it was great, so i know it's not my yeast, but this bread was definitely subpar.

Really impressed with this bread.  I followed the directions to a T only changing the amount of salt to 1.5 tsp.  It was really easy AND beautiful and smelled AMAZING.  If I could can the smell I would!!  Came out great the only downside is keeping it fresh after the first cut.  Going to actually make some more now!!

This really does make a great soft bread for the bread machine.  I have made it a couple times now and it has came out great both times.  I first saw this recipe on another popular cooking site and tried it from there.  I was searching on here and found this one and noticed that the ingredients and directions were the same as the other, so I figured I would review it here as well.  Great fool proof recipe!  If your looking for a nice fresh white bread to make in your bread machine, this is the recipe.  Thanks!

This recipe lives up to its name--TRULY THE BEST.  I love the texture of the crumb and it makes great sandwiches.  It makes a lot of sense to dissolve the yeast first.  I don't know why the manufacturers insist on placing the yeast on top of the dry ingredients.  I will be using this recipe from now until a better one comes along which I doubt.

Good recipe for a basic bread.  Sometimes I do half wheat flour and half bread flour.  I mix it in my stand mixer (Kitchen Aid) and bake it in the oven.

Well, 3rd time is a charm!  The first time I made this bread, I was using questionable yeast and I forgot the salt.  It rose but was pretty blah.  The second time, I remembered the salt so it tasted better but for some reason I split it into 2 pans instead of one and got some pretty short loaves.  (I just made the dough in the breadmaker and baked it in the oven.)  Tonight was try #3 and I came out with a BEAUTIFUL loaf of yummy bread!  I will be using this recipe to replace store bought bread!  I used 1 1/4 tsp of salt and olive oil pers some suggestions and I used 1 1/2 C bread flour and 1 1/2 C whole wheat flour.  YUMMY!  Thanks so much for posting!

I don't make bread with my machine very often anymore, but this is the recipe I always come back to. Before trying this one, my bread never rose properly. With this, it comes out beautifully. So, when I try other recipes, I still do the pre-proofing so it will not turn out like a brick. I recommended that for my S-I-L who had just moved across the country, and the old recipe she had always loved never worked anymore. She used this technique, and it works again.

I am a novice bread-baker with a recently bought Zojirushi. I have been struggling to make a good loaf with my breadmaker and trying out different recipes and always ending up frustrated with a hard loaf. I followed the instructions here to proof the yeast first and for the first time I got awesome bread like the one I had always dreamt of making. In fact I used white whole wheat flour instead of bread flour, and my loaf looks awesome. Thanks a lot!!

This makes a nice loaf. I used the extra salt suggested by ICYBLUEROSE and also thought it was going to rise too much but it turned out just right. :)

WOW!!! Much better than my recipes with my machine. I followed the recipe to the tea except, I added 1/2 teaspoon more salt. Very soft inside and crusty outside, awesome, like home-made bread should be.This is what I bought my bread machine for!!! LOVE IT!! Try it, you will too, Joan Bunge/USApeach58

Was okay....I can't seem to find a good bread recipe for my breadmaker.  It always comes out raw.  This one was less raw, but still was boring.  I didn't mind it, but my boyfriend hated it.

I have to say I had some doubts about this, because I've always been quite disappointed with some of the breads I've made with my machine, wondering if maybe my machine was inferior!!  They'd always turn out too "dense" on the inside, and crust too hard!!  I tried this last night...and OMG...I LOVED the bread, I just could NOT get enough of it!!!  SUPERIOR bread, even better than the fresh loaves sold in the bakery section of stores!!!  TY so much, I'm sticking with this recipe for life!!! :)

Perfect!  Even though I used shortening instead of oil, the loaf turned out perfectly.  It is a very soft bread that kids will like.  I also did not read the directions about putting yeast in water first.  Woops.  It didn't make any difference, as far as I'm concerned.  I will use this one again.

By far the best bread machine recipe I've ever tried! I used olive oil, and 1.5tsp of salt as per other reviewer suggestions, and the bread was fluffy and light and had a great store-bought soft texture.  I'll try my previous favourite recipe using this one's method to see if that helps with the texture, but if not this will be my go-to bread recipe from now on!

WOW, this bread is fantastic!  After making recipies found in the bread machine manual and finding them dry, dense and bland, this was music to my tastebuds!  I did, as another reviewer recommended, add about 1-2 tbls of honey and an extra 1/2 tsp of salt, and there were no problems!  yum!!!!

This is so easy & wonderful.  I make the dough in the machine & then roll into buns & bake at 350 in a pampered chef stone pans. We even use this recipe for cinnamon buns ... rolled & cut.

We really liked this bread a lot. I made it more of a wheat bread though by using 1 cup of regular flour and 3 cups of wheat flour (its all I had). Next time I will use bread flour. I love being able to whip up a great loaf of bread in a couple hours.

This recipe was fabulous!! I've used a bread maker for 15 years and tried lots of recipes.  This one is a keeper.  I have a Zojirushi bread machine and haven't been happy with the recipes that were recommended with it.  They all would be dense or actually fall and would make nice doorstops.  Based on all the recommendations for this recipe I tried it yesterday.  I scaled it up to 16 servings for a 2lb loaf, and I shouldn't have!  It rose right up to the window.  And it didn't brown like it should have but I think that was because the loaf was so big that the warm air couldn't circulate correctly to brown the top.  But the loaf itself is light and tasty.  DO dissolve the yeast into the water and sugar.  I increased the salt like others suggested.  I might try to decrease the sugar a bit as I try to stay away from white sugar.  But this loaf ended up being so big I didn't have a bread bag that would fit around it.  AMAZING!

My bread machine has been sitting in the closet for 5 years. This was my fourth try at a bread recipe from this site and it was the best.  The loaf bloomed  to the top of the pan.  It was light and so tasty. Thank you for giving my bread machine a new lease on life.  This will be my go to recipe simple and quick...

Great fluffy loaf! And a easy recipe to modify. I needed to get to bed so I put all the dry ingredients and oil at the bottom of the bread pan (salt on the bottom), and mixed the yeast, water and sugar mixture on the top. Set the timer to start baking after 10min, and voila! Fresh bread in the morning. Also substituted 1 cup flour for whole wheat, and used all-purpose for the rest as I was out of bread flour.

Being a novice bread baker, even with a machine, I was nervous I would bake this into a brick. I did not change the recipe at all (I live above 6000 ft, I did watch it diligently though) and it was perfect bread! I have gained some bread confidence, thanks.

Yep. this is it. Go ahead and throw away any basic recipe you have. Just follow the directions even if they differ from your regular machine recipes.  You might want to add an extra 1/2 tsp of salt, it worked for me.  Good bread making : )

Excellent. I've also made this bread on the super rapid cycle, and having amazing bread in less than an hour is wonderful. I've used honey in place of sugar, and I think I prefer it with the honey. I've also used olive oil in place of vegetable oil, and both are very good. The dough makes wonderful fried breadsticks, too. Try this, it's such a great recipe! Thanks for sharing, DiggetyDog!

My Mother is a stroke victim and is on a VERY strict daily sodium intake.  Since she is limited to only 2,000 mg in a 24 hour period this recipe works out great.  I made this loaf, minus the salt, and it turned out great.  Since the salt was eliminated there is no sodium to count.  She ate the whole loaf in 2 days!  Try it without salt and see what you think.

Oh my goodness!  After a break of a couple of years and two disasters this morning, I discovered this recipe.  I'm never going back!  Delicious bread.  I added an extra 1/ tsp of salt and used olive oil instead of vegetable (as I'd used it up on the other disasters)!

my breadmaker had been confined to the shed thanks to the brick like results it produced with that irritating paddle hole at the bottom.  then I found this recipe for best bread machine bread, and  the breadmaker was restored to the kitchen for one last chance.  now,   the family love this bread   I make it to the recipe in the breadmaker  but use 'dough' setting, then bang it into a bread tin,  there is enough dough for a small round loaf as well, [which I cook in a soup dish] leave to rise  place in the oven which has been heated to gas regulo 8 immediately turning down the heat to reg. 6 and bake for around 30-40 mins.   wow a success  with home baked bread at last  no more commercially produced bread for us, thank you.

I just got a bread machine for Christmas and this was the first type of bread I attempted to make in my machine. I have made it twice now and it is absolutely the best bread I have ever had. My husband also loves is very much. The only change I made was that I added 2 heaping Tbs of Honey just because I like a sweet taste to my bread. I also just use the dough cycle and transfer the dough to 2 9x5 bread pans so the loaf is not so tall.

Excellent basic white bread recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  I do weigh my flour (rather then measure with a cup) as that seems to give me more consistent results.  If you want to try a basic white bread - this one is a great choice.

For as many people to rave about this, you would think it would be simply amazing! But instead it's just simple normal white bread. Nothing to lose sleep over, just a white bread. If you're looking for something amazing then keep searching.

I used this recipe to make dinner rolls by using my bread machine's dough setting, then shaping into rolls. I let them rise again and then baked at 350 till golden on top. Mmmmmm. I used rice milk in place of water to add a little extra protein, but that was the only change. Super bread!!

Excellent recipe. Makes a nice, light loaf. I did use 1 1/2 tsp salt as recommended by others and I had to add several tablespoons of flour to get the right consistency in my bread machine. My new go-to bread recipe.

This was Wonderful! I followed the directions exactly and was So happy with the results. The bread was soft and chewy while the crust had just enough crunch. My family loves it, will make again and again. Thanks so much for sharing.

Excellent recipe.  As others have mentioned, this recipe made my bread machine finally fill the need for good, fresh sandwich bread.  I made all the recipes that came with my machine, but none had the softness of this bread, as all supermarket breads have.  Must be the extra oil.   I will continue to use the Stand Mixer and oven for the fancy breads, but the bread machine will be making this recipe week in, week out.    I also did a substitution on my second loaf, using one cup whole wheat, two cups white flour.  Very nice texture and flavor.

Incredible. I choose this to be my first attempt at making bread using my new bread maker. The bread came out delicious. It's so soft and moist. My 4 year old is still eating right now. I am sure to be using this recipe again and again.

Like everyone else, this is the best recipe ever. I made only one change which was to use olive oil instead of canola or vegetable oil. Long story short, it literally was pushing the top of the bread maker up, not just touching the window. That gave me an idea. I used the dough setting instead. After 1 hour 30 min, I poured the dough out onto a floured surface, punched it down, and filled a commercial 10 inch loaf pan I got from Sur La Table. I let it rise for forty minutes in my oven with some warm water in it that raised the temp to a stable 84 degrees. At the end of that time, it had more than doubled, but, was still just shy of a standard commercial loaf's footprint. I took out the water and set the oven to 380 degrees, in the approx ten minutes to hit 380, it finished rising to the footprint of a standard store bought commercial loaf. From that point it hit the oven beeped me that it hit the 380 degree setting, I gave it another 25 to 30 minutes to finish. What I get out of it is fantastic bread I can use in my son's school lunches that uses olive oil instead of the cheap oils they use in standard white bread. I get the benefits of serving him a perfect loaf of unbleached flour and olive oil. He gets the benefit of great tasting bread he loves and will eat. Also, when I add a 1 tsp of unchopped rosemary or 1/2 tsp of ground rosemary, I get an incredible loaf for either left over turkey sandwiches or an egg salad sandwich.

Like some others, I was skeptical about not following the manufacturers directions for making bread in my bread machine.  I took the risk and it came out fine.  What puzzles me is what all the raving reviews are  about.  The bread tastes just like most of the breads I've made before.  Have none of these people ever produced bread like this from their machines?  It was good, but tastes just like all the other breads I've been making for years.  Also, several people mentioned how huge the loaf was.  Mine was normal in size (or at least what I consider normal)  Perhaps their machines don't make very generous sized loafs?

I have had my Breadman TR2700 for 3 days and I am on my 6th loaf using this recipe.  Every loaf has come out perfect!  The best idea is to proof the yeast prior to adding the other ingredients. I used the med crust setting for the 1 1/2# white bread, baking time 3:05.  This is what I did because I did not have all the "bread machine" flour or yeast onhand.  I mixed 3/4c 2% Milk with 1/4 c water and 2 tablespoons sugar in a glass and microwaved until warm (110degrees). I stirred liquid and poured into pan that was placed in bread machine.  I took 2 teaspoons of Fleischmanns Active Dry Yeast and sprinkled on top of liquid.  Close the lid and let proof for 10 min. In a mixing cup I measured 1/4 canola oil and added 1 1/2 teas salt.  After the 10 minutes, pour the oil and salt into yeast mixture and then add 2 3/4 cup all purpose flour using a measuring cup so the flour is evenly dispursed over the mixture. Close the lid and hit start.  Set it and forget it. UMM UMM  My family inhales this bread  (do not use this proofing method for "delay" baking)  Thanks Diggetydog !!

All I can say is "Hotdiggety Dog!!"  This recipe is DELICIOUS!  I bought Emeril's new bread making machine and was getting ready to pack it up and send it back.  Tried two if his and they were hard as rocks - but this recipe, with its instructions of putting in the yeast, water and sugar first was the bomb!!!  Thanks for the great recipe Diggetydog, I am keeping my machine and my new recipe.  IT WAS LIGHT, TASTY AND DELICIOUS!!!

Sorry, not so good.  Followed the directions for more salt, used fresh yeast, etc. and it fell just before the bake cycle.  Don't know how all you people do it.  Think I'll stick to woodworking.  (It does not fall just before completion)

Recipe so perfect it earned my first ever review. Followed recipe exactly, but used all purpose flour and only had yeast bought in bulk so didnt know how much a "package" contained I used 1 1/2 teaspoons yeast. Raised perfectly. It is best bread machine recipe ever!

If you're on the fence... try this recipe.  Everyone is right.  You cannot mess it up.  I did not have Bread Flour... I used AP... and it came out great.  I didn't use vegetable oil, I went with olive oil.  I also followed the lead of so many of the reviewers, I added an extra 1/2 tsp of salt.  If you're wondering, this is not a dense textured bread.  It is very soft.  It's almost Brioche like.    I know it will become a regular at my house.

I've been successfully baking bread by hand for years, but have never been able to get a decent loaf out of my automatic bread machine.  I wasn't really expecting this one to turn out any better, but I was wrong!  I followed the recipe exactly as written, and it turned out perfectly!  And I don't think it could be any easier.  This recipe is definitely going into my permanent recipe file.  I just made this again for a second time, but this time I replaced the oil with 1/4 cup melted butter, and instead of the sugar I added 3 tablespoons molasses.  I also added 1 tablespoon instant coffee dissolved in the liquid before I added the flour.  It came out even more amazing than the first time!

I followed some helpful suggestions: I increased the sugar to 3 tbs, reduced the yeast to 2 tsp. I used all-purpose flour and it still turned out wonderfully. I thought my first try with a new bread machine (and no instruction manual!) would be a disaster and instead, it was a great experience. Looking forward to making french toast tomorrow with the remainder of my loaf!

I made this bread to use for making grilled cheese sandwiches.  It came out wonderful.  The center of the bread was very moist and soft - a nice change from most white bread recipes I have made in the past.  This would make great toast!

This recipe was great!!!  I produced a very soft and moist white bread that was easy to cut.  It sort of reminded me of the Amish White Bread recipe on this site.  Next time I may try to sub some whole wheat flour to make it healthier.

I love this recipe.  I gave it to my daughter and she and her family love it also.  We always use the dough cycle on our bread machines and make rolls.  The only changes we make is to add a dash of honey and 2 Tablespoons of parmesan cheese and increase salt to 1 1/2 teaspoon.  This is the only bread recipe we use.  Thank you for the delicious recipe.

I got a bread machine a year ago, but after making a very disappointing recipe out of the owner's manual, the bread machine was left forgotten on the counter. This recipe changed all that! I've made two loaves over the past week. I love it!

This recipe is pretty good as is.  The second time I make it I added 3 tablespoons of honey and instead of the 3 cups of bread flour I used 2 1/2 cups white flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat.

I love that this recipe produces a bread that doesn't crumble when you cut or hold! It's actually springy like grocery store bread. That and the fact that it's the only bread machine bread I've ever made to not be super crumbly - I'm off grocery store bread permanently!

WOW!!  So I've never made bread before and my parents bought me a bread machine so I thought I'd try this recipe out first!  IT'S FANTASTIC!!  I added in the extra bit of salt the other poster's recommended...I end up with tall beautiful loafs that are light and airy with a beautiful flaky crust (I didn't even know bread crust could be flaky!!)

I added 3 tbsp sugar because I prefer sweeter bread and used 2 cups of whole wheat bread flour and 1 cup of all purpose flour.  I was afraid of using this method because of the instructions that come with the machine, however, I did it this way and it turned out beautifully!! (I even had less yeast then recommended because I ran out - just under 2 tsp). A good solid basic bread recipe.

This bread is absolutely fabulous! I mixed the ingredients adding the yeast last, rather than the way on the recipe, and it was the best bread I have ever made in the machine. We will be making this one often!

This bread is awesome! I used 1.5 tsp salt, and used the basic white bread setting.  It is delicious, light, and fluffy.  After so many dense, heavy loaves, it's such a relief to find a recipe that turns out like FRESH BAKERY BREAD!

I've made a lot of bread machine bread and this one is my families favorites. I add a little more sugar though...heaping tablespoons full rather than spare. Quick and easy!

I too was skeptical about putting the yeast in water but this recipe is a winner! I've made two loaves and both have been wonderfully moist and delicious. I followed earlier suggestion and substituted 1/3 c honey for the sugar.

Easy! I am new to the breaad machine, but this looked foolproof. It was perfect. Delicious, my 12 year old asked for another piece! Texture and flavor like store bought white bread, but better.

This is actually the first loaf I've ever made using a bread machine...and I'm completely addicted!  Making the second batch right now (the first loaf is almost gone)!  I followed the instructions exactly and am certainly glad I did...FANTASTIC!

This recipe should be called the Oh My Gosh Bread! It is the first loaf of bread from my Breadman that I consider perfect. The crust is flaky and delicious. I didn't have either bread flour or bread machine yeast so I used active dry yeast and unbleached flour with no problems. The only mistake I made was starting too late which meant I was eating warm bread at 8:30 PM and had to try to sleep with that wonderful, fresh baked bread aroma floating through the house! I also used the British measurement for the flour as I had already made two loaves from another recipe that were dense and useless. Sure enough, the 3 cups weighed 400 grams. Follow the mixing instructions without fear, it works! 4/23/09, I made this recipe for the third time. It seems to be even more perfect this time! I added an additional 1/2 tsp salt but think I will cut that down to 1/4 tsp. I also used rapid rise yeast. No problem. I don't know why others are having difficulties. All I know is that I weigh my flour by first fluffing it with a whisk each time before I lightly spoon it into the measuring cup. Then I put it in the container for the scale. If it is measured properly it should equal 400gms. Also added an additional tablespoon of sugar. An amazing recipe. Simply amazing.

So easy, and my kids are loving it. Made it as instructed the first time and got a perfect, tender white loaf that made AWESOME grilled cheese. Second time I took Bermyrose's suggestion to use honey and a bit of wheat flour. Even though I forgot the oil in the wheat batch, this is our new all time favorite sandwich bread. I will never buy at the store again! Thank you for sharing this great recipe.

It must be my bread machine (Welbilt ABM4900) but I tried this recipe twice and both times came out rock hard.  I don't think it rose at all.  The second time I made sure that the yeast wasn't the problem and bought yeast esp. for bread machines but still had the same problem.

THANK YOU..THANK YOU.  This bread was fabulous!  It is the first bread that I have made that actually came out.  I have not been able to make bread either in the machine or oven!  But this recipe was so simple!  I did change one thing from the original recipe and that was to use 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 2 1/2 cups of bread machine flour.   We used the bread for sandwiches this afternoon shortly after it was done and wow!  I definetly will be using this as a base for adding other goodies.  I'm starting my second loaf for the day!  Thanks again!

Excellent!  The first loaf of bread I've made in my machine that actually rose properly!  Usually it comes out in a small, dense loaf, I actually stopped using my bread machine for about 2 years because I never got a good loaf out of it...until now!  Will be making again, thanks.

This recipe was disappointing.  I grew up on home made bread and miss the taste of a piping hot loaf of homemade bread. The texture was good (the only reason for two stars), but it seriously lacked flavor.

This really turns out great! I increased the salt by 1/2 tsp, and used regular flour. I mixed the sugar, water, and yeast in the bottom of the pan just like it said and even though my breadmaker isn't supposed to work like that it turned out perfect. I like my bread a little sweeter, so next time I will increase the sugar. This will definately be my new standby white loaf recipe.

I added the extra salt that was mentioned and it is great.  I am letting the bread do a 2nd rise in the oven over a hot pan of water to have a controlled environment. Rises for 1 hour then I cook at 350 for 30min. Beautiful each time!

I am a first time bread machine user...LITERALLY! I just bought a bread machine 2 nights ago, and this was the first recipe that I made in it. Raised by my grandma, I actually learned the fine arts of bread making (especially therapeutic after an argument/disagreement with your hubby!) This recipe was against everything I knew about making bread, so I was really concerned about how it would turn out, PLUS it was my first time using my bread machine. I pulled up a chair and watched (almost all 3 hours!! LOL) I was amazed to see how everything came together, and produced a WONDERFUL loaf of bread!! This is the only white bread recipe I'll be using!! Absolutely excellent flavor, texture, and aroma for the ease of this recipe!  (BTW...I joined this site JUST to rate and review this recipe! LOL)

The Best! I've tried this in 3 different manufacturers bread machines with great results everytime. (My mom and my friend both have diffrent machines than I do). I made this recipe the first time I ever used a bread machine and it will be the only recipe I use. I had to adjust my crust to a light setting as medium was too crispy for me - but that is a personal choice - other than that I use this recipe just as it is written (use bread flour and 2 1/2 tespoons yeast) no need to change anything. Turnes out excellent! It even got my boyfriend into making bread (and he won't admit to cooking..hahaha)! The lightest, highest, nicest loaf of bread I've seen come from a bread machine (tasts just like mom's). Thank-you for sharing this recipe.

This is absolutely the best recipe for bread machine bread.  It's easy and the bread comes out almost like store bought bread.  I did reduce the yeast to two tsps, and used honey instead of sugar.

After a lot of disappointing results using my bread machine, I didn't have much confidence that this recipe would work any better. I was wrong! I used bread machine flour but only had regular yeast but it came out fine.  I did add the extra 1/2 teaspoon of salt as recommended by several reviewers.  This is an extremely easy, basic bread machine recipe that I will use over and over again.

This is a very good bread. I have also changed it by adding brown sugar and half whole wheat flour.  Good both ways.

Just got my first bread machine as a xmas gift.  I've been trying different recipes and nothing seems to come out to my liking.  Either the bread is too dense, too dry, or just plain not good.  This recipe made me want to actually keep my bread machine.  The bread was delicious.  I cut into about after 20 minutes of cooling time.  It was light and not too airy and had some chew to it.  The crust was crunchy on the sides and the top was a bit flaky.  Mmm..mm..good.  I'll forget about all the other white bread recipes.

I think the recipe should be modified to use regular yeast and not the "rapid rise" bread machine yeast.  For my first loaf I used regular yeast and followed the instructions to the letter.  Bread came out great.  For my second loaf I tried using bread machine yeast AKA rapid rise.  This resulted in a loaf that over rose in the machine.  For my third, I tried out the "rapid" option on my breadmaker to see if this setting would help.  While the bread did not rise as much, it still touched the top of the machine a little bit.  This recipe probably does not need to "proof" the yeast and can probably be used with the regular instructions for your bread machine.  It does make a nice tasting loaf of bread and I loathe to add more salt to a recipe (I'm sensitive).  I would recommend just regular yeast instead of the more expensive bread machine yeast.

This is so easy and delicious. For a variation I add as others have suggested 2 tsp cinnamon, 2 tbsp honey, and 2 tsp brown sugar. Next time I am going to add raisins and see how that comes out. Again this recipe is great all by itself though.

This bread was phenomenal! I have used bread machine mixes in the past, and was always somewhat disappointed with the reseults. The top would fall in, or it just would be an average loaf. This loaf was picture perfect, and was a bit more dense, so it didn't fall apart when I was cutting it. I added 1/2 tsp more salt, and I had jar yeast which said to use 1/2 tsp per cup of flour, so I only used 1.5 tsp of instant yeast. Thank you so much for this recipe, now, instead of spending $2-$3 per loaf by using a mix I can make many more for a lot less, and its better bread!

This bread is very good, but like other reviewers, the top of my bread didn't rise either.  I used 1 1/2 tsp of salt as recommended.

Sensational! I have put this bread through the paces, I froze it, drove 400 miles with it, thawed it, drove another 150 miles, froze it again (accidentally), thawed it again, and just enjoyed three perfect slices of this bread. YUM!

Due to an ongoing construction project, this is the first day my bread machine has been unpacked in a long time.  Since it's been so long I decided to start with a basic recipe.  This one is great, as is, no modifications are needed.  My only recommendation is keeping your yeast frozen until used for longer keeping.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This wasn't the best bread machine recipe.  The texture was good, but it could of used a little more of something...maybe salt.  My bread did fall in the middle.  There was a suggestion to add a 1/2 tsp more of salt.  I guess this will help with the taste too.  I'll give it a 2nd try but, still like Ron's Bread recipe better.

Made this bread last night and it was easy and fantastic!!!  Noticed it was simular to the fast bake recipe that came with my breadmaker however I think starting the yeast first really makes the difference. A+++++ in my recipe book!

I was searching for a GOOD bread recipe and came across this one. Ratings were really good so I decided to try it. I made it for all 40 of our Youth Group kids and 3 tried to pay me to make them another one!!! IT IS BEYOND A 5 STAR! I had to retro the ingredients to fit my bread maker but I wont use any other recipe again! Have already passed recipe along to 5 people this week! FABULOUS!

I have to admit I didn't read the directions. After making it, I couldn't wait to taste it. I thought it tasted bland. Something was missing. After reading other reviews, I will try the proofing first and add a bit more salt. Other than that, it rose well and turned out very soft. Thank you!

I have just found my new bread recipe! I have always struggled to find a recipe for my machine that did not end up drying out after the first slice was cut. This recipe yields a nice, light, yet substantial loaf of bread that actually stays soft once it is cut! I made only a couple of changes - I substituted 2 tablespoons of sorghum + 1 tablespoon of Demerara (evaporated cane juice) for the sugar, 2 1/4 tsp. bread machine yeast (the type in the jar), 1 cup bread flour, 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1 cup ground oatmeal (milled in the food processor), 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt. The sponge seemed sticky while it was cycling, but I resisted the urge to modify. We got a nice, fluffy, chewy loaf of bread that is now on the verge of being gone less than 24 hours later! Despite the addition of whole grains, the bread was not coarse or chunky. LOVE IT!!!

this bread turned out great.  I followed the directions exactly, and was very happy with the results.  It was also easy enough for me to allow my 5-year-old to do much of the "work," and now she's addicted to making bread.  Thanks for the recipe!

this was my very first foray into breadmaking (in my new machine). absolutely wonderful, soft and tasty inside, flaky and chewy outside.  my kids and husband devoured it with amish butter.  gone in 10 minutes, and i felt like a rock star in the bread world LOL!  thanks so much!!! *UPDATE* i have made this bread upwards of ten times in the last couple weeks, just wanted to say that never once has it not "turned out right".  perfect tasty dinner bread every single time!

I've only been baking bread for a few months now and most of the breds are heavy real dense but this one is a keeper. My family had the whole loaf gone with dinner. Thanks for this incredible recipe.

This was the first bread I made in my new bread machine.. which is actually a hand me down from my mom. I was really nervous to make bread for the first time but after reading all the reviews it seemed like everyone had a great turn out with this recipe.. I added a T of honey and a dash more salt and the bread was AWESOME.. I am already making another loaf today because my husband and I ate the first one all up yesterday.

I rated this bread once, but had to come back to give it a different review. This bread is the best bread machine bread I have ever had. The first time it didn't turn out but that was my fault or my bread machines. Remade it today and everyone loves it. Thanks for the wonderful recipe my husband said I had to make it atleast once a week.

I bake bread by hand several times a week, and maybe I'm a "bread snob", or maybe my bread machine isn't very good, but I didn't like the texture or flavor of this bread.  Granted, it rose well, but that is the minimum requirement for a loaf of bread.  Won't be making it again.

The title says it all!!  Followed recipe as written and had a wonderful, tasty loaf of bread as a result.  Boyfriend said it was the best bread he's eaten; he ate two slices before we even sat down to eat dinner.   This recipe is a keeper!!!!

By far, the best loaf of bread I have ever made in my machine. This recipe is a great basic. Fantastic as is, and can be easily "dressed up". 
I added rosemary, thyme, and garlic with the flour and salt and had a fantastic bread for pasta and grilled sandwiches. 
The texture of this bread is simply amazing.

I just made this bread today.  It is Fantastic !!!  We ate half the loaf. My husband who only ate store bread just loved it. The bread just turned out to perfection, light and fluffy. I am a newbie at bread making. I've tried other recipes but this is the BEST.  Only one i'll use from now on.  Thank you for posting it. Leona

AWESOME!  I am so happy I found this recipe.  I received my bread maker for Xmas two years ago.  I made a couple loafs with the recipe provided by the manufacturer.  Both were dense and just not at all pleasant.  I put it away and kind of forgot about it.  

Well, with the bread prices for store bought bread going up and up, I decided it was time to break out the ole' bread machine out and give it another go with a different recipe.  

This recipe is awesome!  I can't believe how light and fluffy this bread came out.  Absolutely delicious.  I was kind of nervous, but it seems this recipe is fool proof.  This is the only bread my family eats now.

The only tip I have is make sure you use warm water, not hot.  Hot water can actually kill the yeast.  I didn't know that and used hot water the first time I made this.  It still came out good, but it's much better with warm water.

Good recipe for sandwiches make sure you don't add the salt to the yeast water mix. This is a great moist loaf. I added the extra half tsp salt. I suggest to use sea salt if you have high blood pressure.

followed all the reviews and added extra salt, went against my better judgement and added the yeast to the liquids. Bread fell and was super dense, so salty it wasnt even edible, only added a half tsp extra. Ive been making bread for years and was very disappointed that this didnt work, it would have been alot easier to use this instead of making it by hand.

Great recipe!  Only 6 ingredients, super easy to make and it taste this good, you can't ask for more. The change I did make was to add 1/2 teaspoon more of the salt and I did punch the dough down midway through rising to prevent it from hitting the top of the bread maker.  The crust was very nice and flaky, my husband loved it (and of course the bread itself). Thanks for the great recipe!

I've tested so many recipes, I was beginning to think you couldn't make good bread in a machine. But this recipe proved me wrong! I was pleasantly surprised of the loaf size, taste and texture of the bread. Gave it 4 stars because I wish it used whole wheat flour, I'm going to try it on my next loaf.

Easy, simple, delicious!  We used all white wheat flour and added 1/2 tsp extra salt and my kids could not get enough!  My 5 year old was begging me to make more!  I love the simplicity of the ingredients and how quick it comes together.

Yummy! Easy AND delicious! This was my first attempt at bread, and it was perfect--I did add the extra salt suggested by some reviewers, and my bread tasted great and didn't fall.  Thanks!

Excellent quality bread that has become one of my family's favorites. Very delicious in it's own right. It's so good that sometimes the kids don't even ask for butter.

I love this bread. I have been trying to find a good recipe that tastes like the bread my husband's grandma makes - and I finally found it! Thank you for the great recipe. I am looking forward to trying different spices and additional ingredients with it! 
(I even goofed up the order of ingredients and it still turned out.) We call it "cabin bread" because we can make it in the bread maker at our cabin. Perfect!

I've made this recipe at least five times now, and while the taste is great, the presentation isn't the best since it ALWAYS falls. I've tried all the suggestions, but alas, nothing has worked. Rather than using only white bread flour, I mix 1 cup whole wheat and 2 cups  bread flour. Overall, a nice bread for sandwiches, if you don't mind the shape.

I have no idea what went wrong!  I made this recipe twice and it won't rise!  I followed the recipe to the letter but it doesn't rise.  I think when u mix the yeast w/ the sugar and water it should foam it did not maybe it the new yeast i just bought.   I gave a 3* because it taste ok/good

I LOVE this recipe! So simple and so tasty!! The first two times I made it, it fell in. So I added a 1/2 cup more flour and 1 tsp more salt and that fixed the problem. I actually only set it on the dough mode and then I bake it in my regular bread pans because I like that shape better than bread machine shape.  Anyway thanks for this recipe!

This bread is very good, and we ate it up quickly, but the amount of oil is very high. There are other excellent recipes with much less, so I'm not likely to make this often.

This is seriously the BEST White bread recipe ever---It's came out very fluffy.  The only change I made was add only 1 Tbs. sugar instead of 3, and 1/2 tsp. more salt.

Will make this again and again.  Thanks so much to the poster.

My husband and I bought a Hitachi bread machine at a yardsale for $1 (no manuals, no cookbooks - just the machine and one recipe on the side of the machine). We both have trouble chewing and digesting tough-crusted breads, so we weren't too impressed at first. Then I found this recipe. It's terrific. I got one piece from the loaf and the husband/kids ate the rest before I could get back to get a second piece.

VERY good, but only as a sandwich bread. It's not really an eat-plain sort of bread.

Very light and delicious.  I was worried about adding water and yeast together before putting it in machine.  Usually yeast is the last ingredient.  However, it worked.  I used 1/4 cup of extra virgin olive oil.  Instead of one teaspoon of salt, I used garlic salt.  It didn't come out garlicy at all.  I recommend this recipe.  Thanks for posting it.  It wasn't dense at all.

Great bread, the only change I made was I used extra virgin olive oil instead of vegtable oil.

I only started baking bread recently. Bought a bread machine and followed the recipe from its book word by word...and all my breads would fall... After 3 or 4 disappointments, I tried this recipe. The only change I made is that I added the 1.5 tsps of salt instead of 1. And the bread turned out wonderful! 
Too bad I was so excited and tried it before I took a picture of it. 
The bread is delicious, best I ever baked for sure, but not the best I ever ate, so giving it 4 stars. 
Will definitely try it again!

It's very tender recipe, I converted to 2.5 tablespoons yeast and added the extra salt. For smidge for flavor I used melted butter instead of oil.

I just made another loaf - this time I followed my bread machine directions and added the liquid ingredients first with the salt, then the flour, then the yeast.  I also substituted butter for the oil and used 1.5 teaspoons of salt.  Perfect loaf.

GREAT recipe.  Allowing the yeast to proof like this makes all the differnce in getting nice fluffy bread.  I have started doubling this recipe and making it by hand without the bread machine.  It is also good using whole wheat for half of the white bread flour.

Couldn't be more simple! I made with the kids in my mom's PreK3 class, and they loved watching, listening, and smelling the bread as it cooked in the machine. They all loved it, and were so proud of their accomplishment! (I know, they didn't really 'make' the bread - no kneading or mixing really, but they did pour the ingredients into the pan in the machine.) :-)

I ignored the few bad reviews to my peril - this bread is pretty bland and you CAN taste the oil!  I like my bread to be dense and flavorful - this one had a little bit of "Wonder Bread" taste, to my mind.

I used this recipe to break in my new bread machine and it turned out perfect.  Great overall texture with a nice lightly crisped crust and very soft inside.  I did increase my salt to 1.5 teaspoons as others suggested (thanks) and I used melted butter in place of the oil.  I just the bread to make the best warm cheese sandwich.  I microwaved the entire sandwich for about thirty seconds and the bread kepts it crispy crust and the inside just got softer.

Definitely a recipe I'll make again and again.

One word: AWESOME!! I use the large loaf, medium crust setting and it turns out absolutely perfect.I joked with my husband, we will now need two bread machines so we can make two loaves at a time as one isnt enough :) I'll be baking this bread for our Christmas brunch with family, I'm sure it'll make awesome toast(we have never had any leftovers to try it yet). I tried many recipes but none has come close, I will never use another white bread machine recipe again. THANK YOU KAREN!

This bread recipe makes a really great loaf of bread. I was amazed how the crust wasn't chewy and hard, but soft. Great for sandwiches. I recommend you try this recipe, you will be glad you did.

I was disappointed with this recipe.  I ended up throwing away half the loaf. The loaf was dense and heavy.  The crust was thicker than I like and the bottom was almost too dense to cut through.  I will probably try this recipe again, but alter it a bit to suit our taste.

I used 1.5 teaspoons of salt instead of the list 1, and I substituted butter for the oil for some added flavor.  It was a decent bread with a nice crust and a light crumb.  It tasted too much like regular white sandwich bread that can be purchased off the shelf of any grocery or convenience store, though.  I plan on making some alterations and additions...

This is indeed the best bread machine recipe! I make it almost weekly. It's great for sandwiches or on its own. Like others, I increased the salt to 1 1/2 tsp because my first loaf fell.

I have not historically had luck with bread, even in the machine, but this came out beautifully.  I was very pleased.  

BUT, that said, since my previous review I have found a recipe with a much better texture and flavor (Amish White Bread, with less sugar per reviews) that I really like a lot more, so, though I initially thought this was a keeper, I'm afraid it will be tossed.  Sorry!

I've made this recipe a few times now.  It's so easy and delicious.  I love the bread just as is in the published recipe, with no changes at all.  And I also love it when I use half white flour and half whole wheat flour and add and extra Tbsp of sugar!  It's so delicious both ways!

I have to admit that I'm not the best cook, but I have mastered bread machine bread, making bread for the last seven years.  But I could never make a good, plain, white loaf.  I gave up and made egg bread.  When my oven broke, I made this recipe instead of rolls for dinner.  WOW!!!  I am a white bread success now!  My family wishes it were healthier, cuz they'd eat it every day.

This is pretty darn good bread.  I'm new to bread making and this is the first loaf that we can eat.  It is so yummy and light.  I'll be making this again for sure.  The crust isn't perfect, so I gave it a 4.  I also increase the salt by 1/2ts as suggested by others.

Favorite very versatile recipe for my dairy/egg allergic kids.  We often sub in up to 1 1/2 cups naturally white whole wheat flour from King Arthur for part of the flour.  Sub up to 3 Tablespoons brown sugar for white sugar.  Found that 1 1/2 teaspoons salt keep the bread from rising and hitting the top of our Cuisinart convection bread maker.  We've done up to 20 variations with very few problems.  Great base recipe.  Makes a nice raisin bread with raisins added after initial mix and extra yeast to handle the cinamin and sugar.

This has to be the best non-sweet bread I've made with my breadmaker. I used 2 tsp yeast, multigrain flour, and baked on the "Basic" setting, and it turned out perfectly. It rose very high (but not to the lid), was soft inside and crusty on the outside. Great recipe! Thank you!

I finally got the recipe that makes a nice light loaf of bread, not thick and dense. I make this with different flour each time, sometimes whole wheat sometimes multigrain or white.

I am sorry to say this was a little disapointing for me. I found that it was too much yeast for a bread machine. My loaf was riseing out of the pan with 1.5 hours left in the cycle. (Maybe thats a machine error, I am not sure. I ended up removing it form the machine and baked it off in the oven. It did have great texture and made a beautiful loaf. It just had no flavor. My family is used to yeast breads made with scaled milk and just didn't care for this one.

What a family pleaser!  Yes, this is very simple and very yummy!  Per reviewer recommendations, I decreased the yeast to 2 tsp, added an extra pinch of sugar, and microwaved my oil 10 seconds to be warm for the yeast.  This bread came out perfect!  Fantastic and delicious!

This is a great recipe that I have made several times now.  It is as basic as basic gets yet still has a nice consistency...not too heavy and not too light.  Being on a farm I don't always have the time or inclination to run to town for a loaf of bread and this recipe is the one I use for an all around loaf that makes great sandwiches as well as a great fresh accompaniment to my pot roasts and other hearty farm meals.

WOW!  This bread is great.  I am not a breadmaker.  In fact I have had a machine for about 10 years and use it about 2 times a year. I live at high altitude so baking can be tricky.  This bread was amazing.  Nice crusty outside, and light inside.  Would be great for toast, homemade croutons, grilled cheese.  YUM!  Of course it is great with butter right out of the oven too!!!  Thanks for sharing

This bread is delicous! It was the first bread recipe I tried in the bread machine that I got for Christmas! It came out exactly as described! Flaky crust and chewy, moist center. The only recommendation I have to make is to use an electric knife when slicing.. Or take the advice of the other rates and lower the amount of yeast..Its hard to cut without breaking it apart. But we used the electric knife and it turned out so pretty! Just like store bought :) I'll use this again.

This is a great recipe for sandwich bread or even for putting butter on to go with soup. It was simple and turned out good. I might try adding some whole wheat flour next time to make it more nutritious. Thanks for the recipe! I'll be making this many more times I'm sure.

I used the dough cycle on my bread machine.  I took it out, punched it down, and then put it in a loaf pan to let rise again.  I baked it at 375 degrees for 30 minutes and it turned out great.

WOW! Even a non-baker can make perfect bread! I haven't used my bread machine in years, but my family was asking for some home baking, so I gave this a try. I have the old 1 lb loaf cylinder machine, so I used the "scaling" option and put in 8 servings instead of the 12 listed. It was in perfect proportion- a beautiful golden top rising just above the rim! It just came out of the machine and I am starting another loaf right away! My yeast packets were "expired", I had to use margarine spread (2 1/2x as much due to water content) and it STILL came out PERFECT!! If I can do it, ANYONE can-thank you for this great recipe!!!

I wasn't sure how this would turn out because it seemed too simple! I did use melted margarine instead of oil, increased the sugar and salt slightly and used regular yeast. This definantly past the test!!! I don't think I will ever make homeade bread the old fashioned way again! Light and fluffy and perfect with a little bit of butter and homeade jam!

This is a keeper, I'm already making a second loaf while we eat the first!

Best Bread Machine Bread recipe? Darn Skippy it is!! I make this 3-5 times a month easy. Its also great because you can vary the recipe easily enough without creating a disaster when you want speciality breads. The only variance I would suggest is either use bread flour specifically made for bread machines or use Wheat Gluten (found in many grocery stores or even health food stores.)

Very easy, very delicious!  Soft and spongy, moist and tender.  Served it last night to in-laws w/ Angel Chicken Pasta from this site.  Everyone raved.  My 8 yr. old son couldn't get enough!

Very tasty and with a flaky crust, as promised.  This is a good recipe to use when you want fresh bread but don't have any eggs or milk in the house.

I have an older bread machine that makes one pound loaves, so I was a bit apprehensive about putting three cups of flour. The flour did spill over a bit while it was mixing but it rose and baked beautifully! My new favourite! WONDERFUL!

I tried this recipe because of its amazing reviews. To confess, I'm mystified. It's not that it's a bad recipe, just average. Fine, but dry crumb. Flavor was bland. Perhaps the addition of a little more salt would help that. I have one that leaves this in the dust for both flavor and texture. Obviously, I won't be making this again.

Wonderful!  This came out perfect.  I seldom use my bread machine because I have never been too successful with it.  Times have changed!  Next time I'm going to use this as the base recipe for some special breads.  My family loves pizza bread.  We'll see what happens!  Thanks!

YEAAAAHHH! I made a perfect loaf of bread. It is soooo good. I am going to keep this recipe for sure. I just got my bread machine and was feeling discouraged by the results. THis recipe went agaist the rules my bread machine. (Yeast does not touch the water) Whatever, now I know why I have never been a rule follower. This is a very perfect white bread. My household has devoured it in the first 15 minutes! Gotta make another tomorrow. Once again, YEAHHH!

This is by far the best recipe for white bread that I have ever tried.  I have tried many that have never produced such a delicious result- but this one works wonderfully.  I followed the recipe even though it contradicts what my bread machine instructions say...maybe that was the problem all along!! :)

Bread tastes great, my only complaint is that it is too tender to actually slice up for sandwiches.  Gets four stars for flavor and simplicity.

I used my bread machine for the first time making this bread, and it turned out perfect!  Very tasty white bread with a smooth texture.  I have already made this bread twice since the first time a few days ago, and am sure that it will be made time and again!

As I was making this bread I wasn't sure how many teaspoons were equal to .25 ounces. I used a shot glass (which wasn't exactly the best measuring tool) and estimated it at 2 teaspoons. Later I did the conversion and it actually should have been 1.5 teaspoons. I ended up with a mushroom loaf! Also, I used the traditional active dry yeast instead of the bread machine yeast so I think the next time I will stick with the recommended 1.5 tsp of the bread machine yeast. The bread was soft in the middle and crusty on the outside and it made a really crunchy toast.

This was the whitest white bread I have ever made.  LOL  It was great except next time I would turn my machine on during those first ten minutes with just the yeast.  The first several minutes on my machine it just sits there preheating and what not so I think the extra delay made my bread not as perfectly shaped as it could have been.  Put the water yeast and sugar in, turn it on and put a timer on for ten minutes so when it's up just quickly add the other stuff.  Someone here said it was bland and it is, but that makes it perfect for putting flavored anything on it, just butter or jam or making it garlic bread...  You could do anything with this, it is a perfect basic bread.  The crust was flaky-good and the whole family loved it.

I followed the recipe EXACTLY, but the bread didnt even rise to the top of the pan, let alone the top of the machine.  Crust was lumpy, not smooth.  I used bread flour and 2-1/4 tsp of bread machine yeast.  Maybe I'll try again, but I'm 99% positive I follwed recipe exact.

This bread turned out pretty well.  It rose to a perfect level.  The crust is good - but not as crispy or flaky as I would have liked.  My only actual problem with this bread was the flavor.  It wasn't bad, just bland.  I made it again, only I added one tablespoon basil leaves and one teaspoon each of oregano, garlic powder, and onion powder.  This one has a much better flavor, but next time I think I'll add even more garlic, onion, and oregano.  Thanks for the recipe!

10 Stars!! Just the best bread recipe ever. 
I use 2-1/2 tsp of yeast & Hollywood oil & it comes out perfect.  I have baked it in the machine & also take it out & let it rise in a 9x5 pan for 30 minutes & bake at 350º for 30 minutes.
I read ever review & have to thank KWEHRHAN on 4-4-02 & BERMYROSE on 11-10-03 for their suggestions.  The peperoni bread was great for a dinner with a salad.  The bread made with 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour was also wonderful.  Plan to e-mail all my friends with this recipe.

I just threw all the ingredients in and walked away.  About 3 hours later I had hot bread waiting.  I'm not sure if I'll ever buy store bought bread again.  I made french toast out of this and it was wonderful!

Excellent recipe, Karen.  I did not vary directions and my bread was perfect not oily.  I thought maybe the person who had the oil problem did not put the ingredients in the proper order or maybe the oil wasn't good.  I used Wesson oil and had no problem.

I've gone to Wonder Bread to this! I don't think I will be buying store bread again.  This is great! I usually through the ingredients in the bread machine the night before and set the timer for the morning and wake up to fresh bread!

This recipe did turn out soft and flaky, as promised.  It also smelled wonderful as it baked.  However, I found it to be completely flavorless.  I suppose we like breads with more personality.

I just got my bread machine so I have been trying a bunch of different recipes.  This is the best white bread recipe that I have found by far!  The bread is so soft (and stays that way for days) and the crust is flaky, not hard like a lot of recipes.

This recipe is foolproof! Even I didn't mess up! I put the dough on 2 kneading cycles. The bread tastes good!

Very good!  I too was skeptical about putting the yeast in first, but the other reviews convinced me.  Thanks Karen K!

This recipe is the best I have found for white bread. It is really yummy!! I used 3 Tbls of sugar instead of two because I like a sweeter bread. I would definitely recommend this to ANYONE who owns a breadmachine. It is that good!!

I've been looking for an easy, yet good Bread Machine recipe for white bread.  I've found it!  Not only was it easy, but there were so few ingredients.  The texture and taste was terrific!! I didn't have bread machine yeast, so I used regular packaged yeast in the same amount.  It worked fine!  thanks for sharing!

Second loaf of bread I made with my new bread machine.  Very impressed with texture and taste of this bread. I found that the yeast took longer than 5-10 min. to foam, waited almost 30 minutes to foam before I added flour, etc., and could not get the bread out of the pan without using a spatula to remove it from the sides.  This one is a keeper!!

The initial stage of the recipe bumps the instructions for adding ingredients in my bread machine. I therefore had my doubts as to whether I would get a good result.

I was sooooooo wrong to be a doubting Thomas. The end product was superb. It was most definitely the best loaf I have made yet, for my taste.

this bread is very easy to make, and it turns out with a great crust.  It isn't a very dense bread and is rather bland by itself.  It toasts great, and is quite good when toasted with garlic spread on it for dinner.

I'm new to bread machines and this is the first recipe that I made that wasn't out of a box and all I can say is good-bye to box mixes and good-bye to store bought white bread.  I followed this recipe to the letter. Had no problems like some other reviewers did.  It was sooooo good!!!!  GRANDMA GRAYCE

Excellent recipe!  I have had a bread machine for almost 7 years and never had any success with an actual loaf of bread until now!  I always have just used the bread machine to make dough but not anymore.  This recipe is wonderful, easy to do, no fancy ingredients-it's just all-around great.  Thanks for sharing it!

I inherited an unloved bread machine that continued to sit, untouched, in my kitchen for another two years.  I ran across this recipe and now I'm using the thing every day!  My kids prefer a hot buttered slice of this bread over any snack foods!  Yummy!

I am a big bread machine user.  I make bread in mine almost everyday and can honestly say this is a GREAT recipe. You wouldn't think that a few little techniques would make any difference, but the crust on this is light and thin, much like bread in the oven.  Usually bread machine bread crust is hard and thick and we slice it off.  Not with this recipe!  Try it!  It is yummy.  Three of us ate the entire loaf for dinner.

I joined just to rite this review. This is the best bread recipe I have ever made. It was easy and came out great. I think the trick is  the water and sugar and yeast sit for 10 mins. Thanks for this great recipe.

This is the absolute best bread I have ever tasted.I would reccomend this recipe to anyone. I have been baking in a bread machine for a while now and have not been able to find a decent recipe(all my roommates told me that I was a bad cook!!). The crust was so flaky and the inside was soft and muy delisioso! You must try this if youn haven't!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have made this bread 6 or 7 times and every time the top falls.  However, this does not affect the quality or good taste, OR the great crust. I have tried MANY white bread recipes for bread machines and this is by far the most consistent, easiest, most tasty one yet. Easy to modify and get same results, too.

This bread is a very good bread.  The only thing I have done to alter the recipie is to use
olive oil instead of vegetable oil.

My 14 yr old son loved this bread so much he was willing to learn how to make it himself.  We've made it several times and it is consistently great!

Good standard white bread.  Very easy to make and it came out cooked great.  I like a lighter crust so next time will use the light crust feature.

This bread has a crispy crust with a soft,light airy center. It practically melts in your mouth. I have tried many different recipes with my bread machine and this one comes highly recommended.
Good Eats!

This is a fast, easy recipe for basic white bread. Texture and flavor are great! There is no need to buy white bread when this is so easy to make, and tastes much better! I make a loaf every Sunday for the week.

What a nice surprise to see this bread turn out so well.  My family loved it.  It couldn't be easier.  My bread machine gives a different order for the ingredients but I followed the directions in the recipe and it turned out perfect. I added 1 1/2 teaspoons of dill weed to my second loaf and it was also great.  This is a "keeper".  Jules

This bread was so delicious.  I felt the crust as I picked it out of the bread machine and immediatly had to have a taste.  This bread stayed with a flaky crust for days after.  You have to try it.

I followed this recipe step for step and omg BEST BREAD I’ve ever tasted. I converted the yeast measurement to 1.5 teaspoons if anyone is having troubles with it. The top rose a little too high but didn’t leave it doughy at all. I’m new to the bread maker world and am so thrilled!! :)

I made this tonight and WOW! Amazing! Dont think I'll ever make a different recipe. One thing that happened though, was the top of the loaf was a tad lopsided and had a few bumps....any recommendations on how to avoid that happening again?

I LOVE THIS BREAD!!!!  Made it tonite to go with homemade stew.  Was a bit concerned when i read about needing extra gluten if using wheat flour, so that was a bit of a concern-but it turned out fine using whole wheat Best for Bread flour.  I'll try with the extra gluten next time just to see what the difference is.  One reviewer said not to use Canola oil....i used canola and the loaf is just fine.  Thanks for this recipe!!!!

This turns out perfectly every time. I follow the recipe exactly, except sometimes I add a tablespoon or two of a spice blend. Rosemary garlic or Italian are our family favorites. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

I was somewhat skeptical about the order of the ingredients but tried it anyway. This was some one of the best white bread I ever had. It was light and airy with an amazing taste. I did add a half teaspoon more of salt. I would highly recommend this recipe. Yummy.

Unbelievable how fabulous this bread turns out.  Use 1.5 teaspoon salt and program for 1.5 pound loaf.   Yummy!

I’ve been making breadmaker bread for 30+ years, in a succession of different machines, using every conceivable recipe—but of course always following the manufacturers’ instructions when putting in those ingredients. Wound up with some tasty stuff, but a leathery crust and dense, spongy texture always made it obvious it came from a machine. This produced a perfect loaf, with a light, airy crumb and a crisp, flaky crust that makes that perfect sound when you bite it. Made as directed except followed other reviewers’ advice and upped salt to 1-1/2 teaspoons. Will never make another bread machine bread without proofing the yeast.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and reduced the amount of yeast by 1/4 tsp. and increased the amount of salt by a scant tsp.  I also measured the temp. of my water to ensure that it was not too hot and not too cool, added it to the yeast and sugar and waited for the foaming and bubbling.  The loaf was perfectly sized, a nice medium crust (as per my bread machine setting) with a tender white center.  This will be my go-to bread recipe.  I never want to buy bread again.  My family agrees!  Thanks for a great, simple recipe and all the wonderful hints and suggestions.

The taste of this bread is in point. I made the recipe exactly as stated and it rose so much that it touched the top of the machine, which is not good because the top ended up not browning. I will make it again with tweaks, because it is really good and worth perfecting.

Other breads have worked fine enough in my bread maker, but not this one. Even with the extra 1/2 tsp of salt another reviewer recommended. Quite disappointing.

I made this and we tore through it pretty quickly. However, can someone please tell me how many pounds this recipe is? My bread machine cooks by pounds.
I did it the first time without even realizing the machine was set for 2 lbs loaf. It seems to have come out fine, but I never get THAT lucky. So please and thank you to whom ever can answer my question! ??

My wife absolutely loved this. I thought it was good. I was also worried about adding the yeast before like mentioned in other reviews but it worked out well. It gave the bread some fluffiness and was not hard packed like usual when I add the yeast after the flour. I did use canola oil and I later saw someone who said don't do it. I want to try with vegatable oil to see how it changes the taste. Will definitely try again!

I followed the recipe except I cut the salt in half and added one package of Knorr’s Vegetable Recipe Mix, to make Vegetable Bread.  It turned out delicious, perfectly golden brown and light and airy.  Can’t wait to make killer sandwiches with this bread.

Instead of using cups as a measurement for flour I weighed my flour instead. 1 cup = 128 g (384g total for this recipe). Then I used Red Star Instant dry yeast but referring to the instructions of 1/2 tsp per cup of flour used (1.5 tsp total for this recipe). Lastly, instead of 1 tsp salt I used 1.5 tsp salt.

This makes a very nicely textured white bread. The crust is a bit on the heavy side even when using the very lightest crust setting on my bread machine. The crust is heavy enough that it burns a bit when toasting.

This is an amazing recipe! I made in a hurry last night and our turned it to be the best loaf I've made in my bread machine to date, in fact im letting the yeast do its thing for another loaf as I comment now! I doubled the salt and sugar and it turned out airy with a flaky crust, perfect! Thank you for sharing!

Followed the review recommendations of upping the salt to 1.5 tsp, but then we found the bread tasted too salty. We’ll make it again as the recipe calls for and see how we like it.

I made the dough in the bread machine then keeded it for a few minutes, shaped it, let it rise in a loaf pan, and baked at 375F for 30 minutes. Simple and delishis.

I use 4 Tablespoons of melted butter in place of the oil. Turns out perfect every time! My favorite bread machine recipe. The bread isn’t as dense as other recipes I tried.

I would have to agree.  This is a pretty great recipe!  We have decided to bake all our own bread so we have been experimenting with several bread machine recipes lately and my kids declared this the winner.  I followed the recipe as written with the exception of adding a pinch more salt as some have suggested.  I set the machine for a 1.5lb loaf and medium crust.  Turned out perfect for sandwiches, etc.  I think I’ll try light crust next time with a little honey to see how that makes up.  One note: I didn’t let the yeast proof as the recipe instructs.  Since I was using active dry yeast, I just added it when I put the flour in.  This is such a straightforward recipe, I’m planning on premixing the dry ingredients for several loaves in separate mason jars and keeping them on hand so I can quickly make new loaves.  Just add the warm water, oil and then the premix to the machine and have bread ready to bake in less than 2 minutes!

Sometimes this bread comes out wonderful! Sometimes it doesn't rise and is very dense. It's hit or miss for me... 
I know my yeast is good cause it bubbled...

This is the best bread I have ever made in my machine.  Why do the makers tell you to put dry yeast on the top?   I added regular active yeast to the water as specified.  I added a little more salt as someone said it might be needed.  Everything else was as the recipe stated.  The bread was smooth, light and fluffy.  Delicious.

This bread is wonderful!!! It is 5 stars with the modification of 1 1/2 tsp of salt instead of 1 tsp. The only other modification was using active dry yeast and using olive oil instead of veg oil.

In my mind, I knew this technique would work in my new machine, but being new to the bread machine world, I used the manufacturer's recipe. My two previous attempts just did not give the results I expected.  Every recipe I researched said the same thing, but then I came across this simple recipe...
 In my opinion, it completely shattered the  the myth of how I must use my bread machine!   
I made one slight change.  I used melted butter instead of oil.  I also added in a little additional softened butter during the the  "Add Mix-Ins" kneading cycle with about a teaspoon of extra flour).  The experimental loaf turned out excellent.  I could smell the difference as it was baking.  I love yeast bread and this did not disappoint.  It rose higher and the texture is so incredibly soft and the butter gives it a brioche-like flavor.

I delayed the start of the machine, therefore I added all the liquid ingredients, then my dry and lastly my yeast. I used quick-rise instant yeast (a whole pouch). My bread is fluffy and delicious! Amazing recipe!

I've made lots of bread in my machine over the years, and this is the best sandwich bread yet! Light but holds up well, perfect crust, delicious! Added extra salt and used olive oil, as some other reviewers mentioned. This will now be my go-to recipe.

This was easy and my family enjoyed it.  The taste was kind of bland.  Next time, I would probably change out butter for the oil hoping the butter adds some flavor.

The perfect recipe.  Simple, easy, and consistent results.  It’s important to use bread flour to get the texture right.  Follow the instructions as written and you’ll agree this is a great recipe for bread.

I put everything and added the extra salt. I peeked in after a half hour and it was a big mess. I told myself to trust the system and the reviews. Checked again,  still a mess. That's when I realized I didn't have the pan locked down. Once I fixed that and restarted, it went like a dream. Formed a really nice dough. Had a very nice rise  and had a nice crust and flavor. Didn't taste the salt, didn't taste sweet. Went really well with the bacon. Hubby toasted his and it sounded crunchy and he ate it so....

I will definitely be making this again. I think it would be great making panninis.

Tasty white bread.  I put in the recommended (from another reviewer) 1.5 teaspoons of salt, the dough rised well.  You can definitely taste the salt, which is not a bad thing.

The crust came out fairly hard; the crumb was awfully light, almost diaphanous ... next time I think I will try to add a skosh more salt, it might help the gluten develop a little more.

Made my first load. Followed one of the Ladies suggestions and added the 1/2 tsp of salt to the ingredients and the loaf cake out nicely. Only problem even completely cooled down the next morning it was really difficult to cut the bread with my bread knife and I have an Oster knife block set that is new and sharp so it isn’t the knife. I did the warm but not too warm water, sugar and yeast. Let it sit for 10 minutes and it bubbles up beautifully. Then I added my bread flour, oil, and 1 1/2  tsp of salt.  I have a brand new Hamilton Beach bread machine and the settings were on: Basic, Medium color, and 1 1/2 lb loaf. I think I did everything right??!!  DID I do something wrong?   I am right this minute making a second loaf of this bread. I have my toes crossed that the second time around it comes out better!!  If it counts my Mom loves the bread and she’s made homemade bread, kneading by hand, all my life and was sooo skeptical about the bread machine!!  Thanks for the recipe it was super fun to do I just hope I didn’t screw it up, TWICE!!  lol

This was not a good recipe. I followed it to the letter. The bread rose to the cover and did not brown. The texture was too light and airy and did not slice well and did not have enough substance to make a sandwich. Gummy taste.

I've had this bread machine for 30 years. I have used this recipe on the two most recent loaves. These loaves of bread are the BEST bread ever to come out of this machine. Soft, moist and delicious. Thanks for this recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly and found the taste comparable to the white bread recipe that came with my bread machine, but the texture was better.  For my family's tastes, I will need to add more salt to the next loaf.  I will be making this again.  Thanks!

Made it...over and OVER again.  Never have ANY issues.  I have added rosemary and chives to a loaf,  cheddar and basil to a loaf, of course just the plain white, and making cinnamon and brown sugar right now.  My family is in LOVE.  So much better than ANYTHING store bought.

It's easy & simple, put in bread maker on 1.5 pound setting, & it rose, & rose, almost hit the lid! Then the heat came on & it sunk, fell like a cake.  I think it rose too much, should set for 1 pound next time. Tasted fine, though!

This is the best shaped loaf and textured bread that I’ve made in my bread maker yet!  I used 1.25 tsp of yeast, stirred the water, sugar and yeast and then covered the yeast solution for the 10 minutes required. I set the bread maker for a 1.5 loaf.  It turned out perfect!!

We made this in my bread maker with a preschool classroom. It turned out perfect. We followed the directions to a T, and it turned out better than I imagined. We were using an old family recipe and it was so dense and overly hard. This was recipe was the turning point to me making bread at home again. The kids loved it! And we even made our own butter.

I made the recipe as written but instead of bread flour I used all purpose flour..... the results the bread was over the pan and slightly touching the lid.... it tasted great. I will be making this again.... I think this time instead of 3 cups flour I’m only going to try 2 since it’s not bread flour and see how that turns out...

My go-to bread recipes.  The only change I make is 1 1/2 tsp of salt instead of 1 tsp.  I take it from the bread machine and bake it in the oven at 350 for about  30 minutes.  It's never failed me.

This recipe is the best!  I have no talent with yeast (this is why I have a bread maker).  I took the suggestions about a tad more sugar and a pinch more salt.  The bread was FANTASTIC and came out just right!

So i am new to a bread machine, and the first few loaves i made, i followed the recipes that came with it.  meh.   Not what i thought it would be like.  i was disappointed to say the least.  Then i found this recipe.   I made it exactly as is the first time, but we have a mini bread maker, so it was a lil too much.   All i did was cut out 1 cup of flour and OMG, this bread is now to die for!!   I was also afraid to go against the mfr direction of not allowing any liquid to touch the yeast.  Trust me, it makes a big difference.   throw those rules out the window!

I read reviews first and increased the salt by 1/2 tsp.  I have the Oster model ckstbr9050 and I used 2lb mode.  This was a success.  Previously I had used the manual that accompanied the bread maker and all attempts taste good but caved in on top

Absolutely wonderful bread!!!! And YES DO add the extra 1/2 tsp of salt I use olive oil and honey, because I don't use veg.oil or processed sugar.  I also don't proof it if using rapid rise or bread machine yeast  comes out perfect and delish! It's my go to white bread recipe  !

Looked at all the comments added in some suggestions gave it a try and.....great results! Was having some disappointments with the suggested recipes for our new bread machine so decided to give the “unconventional “ a try. Worked perfectly! Next up seeing if we can adapt a larger recipe to make a bigger loaf.

I've made this recipe twice now.  It's the first one I have done that didn't require milk or non fat dry milk.  It's flaky, light and delicious.  I was also surprised when realizing that the yeast placement was the exact opposite of all the other recipes.  Works great.

With bread like this, who needs the store-bought stuff!?
I used all-purpose flour (I live in Canada, and the all-purpose flour we have here is high enough in gluten to make bread. Of course, if you have the real bread flour, go for it, but if you don't, no problem.)
Also, I stuck to 1 tsp of salt for the recipe, even though some reviewers mentioned they increased it. I had no problems with it rising (it rose very high) and it tastes quite salty as is. 
Also, I used half olive oil, half vegetable oil, but I don't think it makes any difference in the taste. Furthermore, I don't know why one reviewer mentioned not to use canola oil. I've used it for breads before and never had an issue. 
This is definitely my new go-to bread machine recipe. Yum!

I threw all of the ingredients into the machine on the dough cycle.   Once complete I shaped it on a pan dusted with cornmeal.  Brushed with egg and sprinkled with coarse salt.  Yummy.

I used all purpose flour because I was out of bread flour. It turned out fine. Nice and soft,with a crusty outside. I would definitely make it again.

Best recipe I have found for bread machine white bread.  It will be my go to recipe!  I increased the sugar to 3 tablespoons and was nervous leaving the yeast to rest in the sugar water for 10 minutes.  It was very frothy,  but did not seem to make the bread more dense.  I wonder if it would have risen more uniformly (it coned up in the middle) if the yeast had not been so active when I added the dry ingredients.  I enjoyed the texture and the flavor.

Fool proof as it gets. I use hot water and I add the oil after the flour and water mix for a bit. I use the 2lb loaf option on med crust and It turns out great every time.

I received a bread machine for Christmas this year and decided to browse online for bread recipes.  When I found this recipe and read through several reviews I decided to give it a try - I really wanted a "win" for my first try with the machine. Unfortunately, it was the 2nd loaf that was a "win" (I messed up the yeast measurements in the 1st loaf).  I have now made 4 perfectly delicious loaves (following the recipe exactly) and my family LOVES it.  I see no reason to even bother with the recipes in the manual.  I think I'm ready to start experimenting with flavors, etc.  Thank you SO much for this great recipe and for making my 1st try at baking my own bread a success!  I also thank all of the reviewers for taking the time to post - 2k reviews is the reason I chose this as my first (and only) bread recipe.

I've been making bread in bread machines for years, and was drawn to this recipe be ause it's the first time I ever saw instructions to prep the yeast, or use vegetable oil.
Major fail.   Worst bread I've ever made.   It's pasty and bland, and the loaf was uneven.   I'll stick to the more traditional recipes from now on.   
(Wish I took a photo of this hot mess before I cut it to taste it!)

So far this is the best white bread recipe I have tried in my bread machine. I decided to check it by temperature to ensure it wouldn't overbake, and when I checked it was already 195°, so I immediately stopped the machine and pulled out the pan. Thankfully I did not leave it in the additional 20 minutes left on the cycle! Great tasting bread, nice crumb texture!

I have made this several times now and have gotten compliments on how tasty and good the bread is. It is really a very simple recipe.  I do add some dough enhancer and use 1/2 whole wheat and white flour.  The dough enhancer makes it stay fresh longer.  It was on my counter for a week and was still fresh.

So quick and easy!  My family loved this recipe so much that I have made it twice this week. Did as others suggested and used 1 1/2 cups white and 1 1/2 cups wheat flours.  Also added about 1/4 tsp extra salt.  Served with copycat steakhouse butter (cinnamon and honey). This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I was skeptical with the ten minute step but the reviews convinced me.  I had the most amazing loaf of white bread so fluffy and fragrant.  I am making another loaf now for the next few days.  Makes great sandwiches and I like that I know what is in it.  I added a few new things to mixture this time.  I added dried parsley, garlic powder.  I love this recipe.  I memorized it after one use that is awesome.  Thank you!

I decided to pull my bread machine out of the closet and try and find a recipe that I actually liked.  This was it.  I did make a couple of changes.  I used butter for the oil and added an additional half a teaspoon of salt, as recommended in other reviews.  It turned out great.  I was also very happy to read in another review that this makes a 1.5 lb loaf, because my machine does have different settings.  I wish the recipe would be updated to include that information.

Made this last night. Used 1.5tsp salt like some other reviews recommended. Let the bread cool overnight and sliced it this morning. The bread was moist and delicious. 2 thumbs up from all children and adults! Will definitely be making this again.

Better bread than following the manual's recipe. Solid slices, great for toast. The firm crust makes it easy to slice and the soft inside is oh so yummy.

I've made this bread many times and love it. I increased the salt by a half tsp so it wouldn't drop and ever since it's our favorite. We use olive oil sometimes,  add dried rosemary,  and tried other ideas. Today I'm taking it to dough and plan to make two long sandwiche loaves. Hope it works out.

Worked so well!!!  I actually made 2 loaves in a day... my kids and husband LOVED this one. Light and airy just as everyone says! I added the extra 1/2 tsp salt and another 1 T sugar as some had suggested. My youngest asked me to stop buying bread at the grocery store and just make this bread. I plan to try some variations soon, too. EASY!!  I just had to get past the way my breadmaker says to do things, like everyone else. :)

So thankful that I tried this recipe.  I had contacted my bread machine company, wanting to return it because the bread NEVER came out right with their recipes!  Only used my machine 4 times!  This time, it was wonderful!  I'm not embarrassed or frustrated anymore!  Get to keep the machine, too!
Thanks!!!

I did it and it was delicious! I used regular flour and regular yeast and it was perfect! Ah and I used grape oil and stevia. I did it in the bread machine, in Basic and medium crust. I recommend it!

I loved this recipe! I used 2 1/2 tsp of bread machine yeast instead of the packet of yeast. I also followed another suggestion and tried a little more sugar. It was great with the 2 tablespoons and it was great with the 3 tablespoons! I like sweeter bread with 3 tablespoons and my fiancé likes the 2 tablespoons better. This was so easy to make and absolutely my new go to recipe. I have made it so much that I know it by heart now.

I made this 3 times, my first was a total disaster, on my second I'd read an alternative review which suggested less yeast, Tired and can certainly second this idea, a little less yeast make for a better loaf.

Did not make any changes and followed the directions to a tee and added as recommended the extra salt. What did I do wrong! Fell flat to the height of 3 1/2 to 4 in tall and greasy with only 1/4 cup of veg oil. Will not make again!

I was very skeptical about this recipe, however, it turned out very well. I made a few additions and added a tablespoon of honey and I half a teaspoon of three cheese vinaigrette.The taste was wonderful and I made chicken and egg salad to go on the bread. I added a picture of the bracelet.

Absolutely the best recipe!  Add the extra 1/2 tsp salt.  Even if you’re jaded and disheartened about baking bread, this WILL restore your faith.  You cannot mess it up!

I am a major newbie when it comes to baking in general. I pulled our bread machine out of the basement and wiped a layer of dust off it and immediately made this recipe, except I used canola oil instead of vegetable oil. It came out perfect and is so delicious!

I now have to make this bread twice a week for my family.  They devour it!  Best white bread recipe I've ever used.

After a few failed attempts of trying to make this in my bread machine and it burning (bread machine problem, nothing with the recipe), I can finally say that this bread is DELICIOUS!!  I ended up only using my bread machine to kneed and rise the bread. I finished it in the oven on 375 for about 25-30 mins.  The only things I changed were I added 3 tablespoons of Sugar and 1 and 1/2 tsp of salt and it was perfect. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I'm new at making bread, and new at using a bread machine. I decided to follow other reviews suggestions by increasing the sugar by 1 Tablespoon, increased the salt by 1/2 teaspoon, used 2 teaspoons of bread machine yeast, and substituted the vegetable oil with 1/4 cup melted butter. It turned out PERFECT! It was soft, light and tasted SO good! It's the only recipe I'll use! Thank you for sharing this amazing bread recipe!

It looked good and had a nice consistency/texture...but super bland and tasteless.  I don't get the positive reviews!  Maybe my flour was old?  I don't think I'll make again.

Kids liked it enough that I had to make a second loaf the same day. Simple recipe - takes just a few minutes to assemble and the machine does the rest.

This is a wonderful recipe for using a bread machine to knead, rise and bake a good shaped and tasty loaf. I also used the extra salt as recommended by other reviewers.  I like to make this loaf with half whole wheat and half bread flour, and added 1 T gluten because of the whole wheat flour. With some raisins and cinnamon the recipe is good, too. Has been fool proof for me and my toddler grandson who likes to help and eat. My Oster cookbook recipes that came with the machine were tried but I wont be using them now that I have this recipe. Thank you!

Just made this for the first time and so have to say it worked out perfectly,  my loafs have never been so big and fluffy. I think letting the yeast bubble up first makes a Hugh difference. Thank you...

Very good tasting bread and easy to make. My #1 bread recipe. Have been making this bread for a year. Have not found another white bread recipe to beat it. I use melted butter in place of oil now and still tastes great.

First time making bread and it was super easy and super delicious! I followed the advice of one commentor and added more salt to prevent sagging. I also used olive oil instead of canola since I didn't have any canola. The results were amazing! I will definitely make this again!

Best bread. Looks wonderful and my husband just kept coming back for more. Not so for other recipes I have used. Looks beautiful. Crust perfect. The 2nd time I made it  I made sure the water was 112 degrees as the first one did not rise well enough. Also used regular rise yeast and added 4 tsp. wheat gluten. This one will be made in my home weekly! Love it.

I did take the advice of some of the other reviews and adjusted the recipe slightly. I added 1 1/2 cups King Arthur white whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups bread flour, increased sugar to 3 Tbsp, increased salt to 1 1/2 tsp, and reduced yeast to 2 tsp. Bread comes out absolutely perfectly! I make this every week.

I've made variations of this bread three times in the last week. 1st loaf- stayed true the recipe but increased the salt by a 1/2 tsp as recommended in the reviews, also used melted butter in place of oil...phenomenal! This loaf did collapse a tad on the top right at the end. 2nd loaf- same as first 1st but made with olive oil, 1/2 c white wheat flour, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tbsp. Italian seasoning and 1 cup shredded cheddar-  so good and never collapsed!!! the 3rd as been my favorite by far... I wanted to experiment with a healthier grain bread. I followed other reviews to decrease yeast, while increasing sugar. Used only 2 tsp yeast, 3 tablespoons honey, 1 1/4 c white wheat flour, olive oil and added 2 tbsp flax seed, chopped walnuts and pumpkin seeds to the batter. I also let the last one rise at room temp for an hour then baked at 375 for 30 minutes! Sprinkled oat bran and oats on top! SO AMAZING IN EVERY WAY! I liked the increased sugar, less yeast variation just as much. Such a simple, and obviously flexible and forgiving base to use. Will be trying a cinnamon raisin on next!

I substituted 1/4 cup of butter instead of using oil, added the recommended extra half teaspoon of salt for total of 1-1/2 teaspoons . I also did not have to let the yeast sit 10 minutes in water since I use "Bread machine" aka Instant yeast.  I used #2 on my machine since this is a 1-1/2 lb loaf, finished in 3 hours. The bread rose nice and fluffy without any big holes in it. The texture was perfect, I sliced some thin slices this morning to make toast, better than store bought!  I think next I will substitute some wheat flour for part of the white flour as I prefer wheat bread. This is my new recipe for bread, not having to buy dry milk for the bread machine recipes is great! Thanks for sharing this with us.

Easy and good tasting bread recipe.  I used one package of Fleischmann's Rapid Rise Instant Yeast in this.  It was very good!
I plan to add a 1/2 teaspoon salt next time.

Followed the recipe to a tee and it turned out perfect. I used the setting on my bread maker that took 2 hours and 50 minutes.  I will make this again!

This is my foolproof easy bread machine recipe I always use. I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Just as soft and yummy!

I recently purchased a bread machine and made a few loaves of bread and this was by far the best.  I did make a few changes, I used 1/4c of margarine instead of oil and I added a little garlic powder.  It  came out great.

As written, it was an epic failure. My bread machine says never let the water touch the yeast. Other reviews said ignore that and follow the directions. I followed the directions exactly and ended up with a cooked flour blob. I followed the recipe again with the exact same ingredients, only I disregarded the first step and put the ingredients in the typical bread machine way - water, oil, sugar, flour, salt, yeast (in that order). THAT yields a perfect sandwich bread.  3 stars because the ingredients are spot on.  Knocking two down for the misleading bubble yeast step that wasted a bunch of ingredients.

The best recipe for bread machine bread I've ever used! The bread comes out light and fluffy each time. Well worth taking the time to activate the active dry yeast before assembling all ingredients. I did increase the salt to 2 Tbsp as others recommended. My kids are requesting about a loaf a day. I've been using this as a basic white base recipe. I add dried parsley, onion powder, garlic powder, and Italian Seasonings...and fresh sliced scallions sometimes. It's amazing!

This recipe breaks all of the bread machine rules, but it is so easy and very very good! I've made it 3 times now, once with 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour for a bit more nutrition. Every time it came out perfectly and delicious.

This simple recipe has been my go to bread recipe for years. Here are some tips:

I use 2 teaspoons of bread machine (instant) yeast. The recipe calls for one packet (2  1/2 tsp) of yeast. I find that this causes the bread to rise too much and then collapse.

Once I adjusted the yeast, it's perfect every time!

Been using this recipe for years as is. A couple tips.... no matter what your bread machine instructions say, do the yeast, sugar and water first as explained above. I dissolve the sugar into the warm water by stirring and agitate it occasionally after I put the yeast in to make sure the mixture has a really good frothy start (important). One more thing, but very important... WEIGH the 3 cups of flour in (12.75 oz). Everyone loves this bread and it does comes out perfect every time! I use the “white” setting on bread machine with medium crust usually. Also leave it be till it’s done, it takes only a small shock at the wrong time to make the whole loaf fall!

So glad I tried this recipe.  I'm making my third batch in two days!  Light, fluffy bread every time - this is now my go-to recipe for white bread.  I use the dough setting, make ham and cheese or pepperoni and cheese buns and then bake in the oven at 350 for 25 minutes.  I freeze the buns for a super easy lunch to pack.  The hardest part is keeping up with the demand!

This was a hit with the whole family! I did add an extra 1/2 tsp of salt and an extra tablespoon of sugar.  I couldn’t have asked for a better loaf out of my bread machine.
Update 2/13/19 I didn’t think it could be better but it was! I made Italian Herb this time.   I added 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese, garlic powder and - I toasted 1 T basil, 1/2 T oregano, 1/2 T Savory, 1 t minced onion.

Not only does this make excellent and easy white bread but it's a super base to work off of. So far I've added raisins and cinnamon, raisins and cinnamon and walnuts, dates and walnuts, cranberries and almonds, orange zest as well as lemon zest and blueberries. Every variation has been insanely good and simple to pop into my bread machine.

I've made this and variations based on it several times in the last few weeks. One thing I've changed is I've added an additional 1/4 cup of water and at times have not added the ingredients right at 10 minutes of yeasting. In either case, it has been excellent.

One other alternative that I've done is split whole wheat yeast with regular bread yeast (1.5 cups each) for some excellent wheat bread.

It was better than OK. I made two version of this bread. One using the foaming yeast method, and one using the traditional dry yeast added last into the machine. The foaming yeast method made for a high rise. 

Overall, a good bread. Next I'm substituting the oil for all butter, using the foaming yeast method. I may add a bit more salt too.

These directions are awful.  I made this and the bread come out as hard as a rock.   I found out from my sister who has a bread maker that you are NOT supposed to add the yeast to the water.  You add the yeast last after you add the flour.  You create a hole at the top of the flour and add the yeast.  thanks a lot of wasting my money!

Was skeptical that this woud work...bread machine book says you have to add ingredients in specific order, only had regular yeast and the canola oil one reviewer warns not to use.  I've had my breadmaker for 10+ years and have made MANY loaves of bread...this is absolutely the best one! We've eaten 1/2 the loaf within an hour of it being done. Going to have to make another loaf tomorrow. Oh, and I did use 1-1/2 tsp of salt.

Can't believe how pretty and soft this loaf was.  I added 1/2 tsp extra salt and needed to add extra water as it was stiff in the machine.  I let the machine do the work, then transfer dough to my own bread pan and let it rise a third time before baking at 375*, then lower to 350* for 35 minutes.  I used store brand flour and yeast and it was perfect.  Can't wait to try my luck again.  This is a winner along with my Pinterest recipe that uses pricy King Arthur flour and yeast.  Both do well in the bread machine.  I'm not a fan of baking in the machine, I always bake it in the oven.

I love that this recipe requires few ingredients but I haven't had a lot of success with it. I followed the recipe exactly as should be the first time I made it. The bread rose and fell in the machine, so I was left with a small, dense bread. On my 2nd try, I added a bit more salt, per the other reviewer's suggestion and the same thing happened. I'm using all purpose whole wheat flour. Could that be causing an issue?

Very simple. I've made it both with 1 tsp and 1.5 tsp of salt. Both work well. I prefer to finish in the oven. Turns out much nicer and I brush it with butter while hot out of the oven. If your machine has a dough setting, simply turn it out on a floured surface, flatten into a rectangle, fold into thirds, rotate it 90 degrees and into thirds again.  Place it seam side down into a greased pan, cover with damp cloth and let it rise for 1 to 1.5 hr. Preheat oven to 350 and bake 30 minutes or to an internal tempreture of 190 degrees.  Remove from pan and cool on a wire rack.

The whole family loved this bread. It turned out fluffy with a nice, soft crust. Makes great sandwich bread!

Makes a great loaf of bread.  I read some reviews and did increase the salt by 1/2 teaspoon.  I didn't see the review warning against using canola oil, and since that's what I had on hand I used it, and it still came out great. 

I made it as 1.5 pound loaf with medium crust, scraped the sides a few times during the first mix, but otherwise the machine did all the heavy lifting.  

2500+ reviews since 2003 - tried and true.   Definitely saving this recipe.

So far, the best bread machine bread I have tried.  I did add the extra salt others recommended, but I will try its original recipe the next time to see if there is a difference   I did bake it in the oven and not in the machine.

DO NOT make this without adding the extra salt. As written, the bread is lacking "something" and that thing is MORE SALT (hence my 4-star rating). My second go 'round I used the suggested 1-1/2 teaspoons salt. This loaf was perfect! My machine has options for light/medium/dark. I used the 'light' setting. It also has options for 1.5 or 2 pound loaf. I used the 1.5 pound setting.

First time making bread in my bread machine! Followed the reviews and used 2 1/4 tsp bread yeast and 1 1/2 tsp salt. Rose up perfectly and was a great consistency. Tasted a little bland to us though so only giving 4 stars.

This is the absolute best recipe I have made in my bread machine. I used olive oil in place of oil and I did follow the advice of other reviews when they said to add a 1/2 tsp more of salt. I will be using this over and over - just perfect.

I have been toying with recipies to get a nice moist bread. Finally got it. Except i changed the way the ingredients are placed  recommended by my bread machine. All wet then flour and yeast on top. I also added 1.5 teaspoons of salt as per the first review. Wonderful, soft loaf! Set on 1 pound setting. Made a tall loaf.

Great bread.  Made with equal measures of Wheat Montana Premium All Purpose Flour (High in protein so works in bread machine and is sold in Walmart) and  with whole wheat flour.  I threw in a tablespoon each of flax and poppy seed.  And I followed the directions of putting the yeast and sugar in warm water for 10 minutes and it worked.  I used the dough cycle and put in loaf pan 45 minutes to rise and then baked at 350* for 35 minutes.. As others have said, this will be my go to recipe as it could easily be changed up a bit with herbs and spices.

Very versatile recipe.

Followed directions to the T.  All I got was a hot mess in the bottom of my bread maker.  Did NOT even mix all the ingrediants together.  So I have a partialy cooked bread under 2 cups of loose flour.  AM NOT HAPPY!!!

I didn't have veg oil on hand and saw another review saying not to use canola oil so I used salted butter (melted.).  Amazing!  The bread was a perfect texture with a  mild butter flavor.  The whole family devoured it!  So good.

Great recipe but definitely needs more experimenting based on your breadmaker and personal tastes. I read the comments as well before baking and it definitely helped adding a tad bit of salt more. i added a small pouch of energy mix seeds and it is yum!
My bread maker - Ikon IK-3001 requires a minimum of 900g to be made so this fell short and hence the crust was harder but so soft inside. Love it!

I've had a bread machine tucked away on a top shelf for years. Got tired of paying $3.00 for a decent loaf of bread, only to have to store it in the fridge or lose it to mold within 4 days or so. Got the machine down and came across this recipe. 

It is THE BOMB. I've made it about 6 times so far, making sure to wrap it in a layer of parchment then foil while warm to keep it soft. I love it! The only thing I changed was adding just a few more drops of oil before the final kneading. That's all it needs.

i was very skeptical about adding the yeast first as my machine says add last.

BUT... it came out wonderful! great taste, great texture. My 4 year old loved it!

Just follow recipe and you'll get great results. I didn't modify any ingredients. Set loaf for 1 lb, light crust.

I can imagine just adding raisins and cinnamon for next time!

I used 1.5 teaspoons salt after reading through some of the  comments here.  This bread is decent.  A little rubbery on the inside and not as "fluffy" as I'd like, but I'd make it again.

I love this recipe! It has a really nice taste and is very soft.  This recipe stands out from all the rest. I make this recipe all the time. I tried 4 different recipes for bread machine bread before I found this one. The other recipes were "tougher" and had bigger surface consistency for white bread. This one has a nice consistency more like store bought bread only much better! It is by far the VERY BEST Bread Machine Bread anywhere!   Thank you SHECOOKS2, excellent recipe!

This recipe created a beautiful loaf of bread!  Like one of the other reviewers, I set my bread machine on the dough cycle because I wanted to bake the bread in a loaf pan.  The dough was absolutely perfect and baked in the oven (with a pan of water on the base of the oven) at 350 degrees for 25 minutes.  Not having vegetable oil, I used olive oil and also brushed the loaf with the oil before baking.  The aroma was fantastic and the taste even better!  I can't wait to bake more loaves and experiment with a variety of flours and ingredients!

I've made this several times. Initially added 1 1/2 tsp salt...too much.
favorite modifications so far: 1 1/4 tsp salt, and sub 1/3 c. melted coconut oil for the vegetable oil.
moist and yummy! makes delicious french toast, too.

The secret is to allow the yeast to foam for 10 minutes with the hot water and sugar. Then measure the ingredients correctly. This is toooooo easy and sooooo good. I noticed that spoke bread machines call for the yeast to go on top of the flour.  No. Foam the yeast and you'll get a perfect loaf in 3 hours.

I added an extra 1/2 tsp of salt as another user suggested and used melted butter in place of oil. My first time using a bread machine, and it turned out great!

Great shape and texture and tastes like Grandma used to make.
(I'm just about 70 yrs old) I used olive oil as a replacement; adds a bit more on the nutrition side.

Best tasting BRICK I've ever eaten!
Followed the recipe 4 times, changed it a few times after that. And all i got were really tasty building blocks. Any advice is welcome. Really want to make this one work.

Good recipe.  Soft and flavorful.  If you did not make this exactly as listed do not comment on it.  Altering the recipe in ANY way makes it a different recipe and skews the reviews.  If you must share your changes create a new posting for your recipe.

Like many of you I was reluctant to try this recipe as it goes directly against the instructions that came with my bread machine.  I decided to "throw caution to the wind" and make it.  The only thing I did differently is I used the "dough setting" and then allowed the bread to do its final rising in a bread pan before baking it in the oven at 375 degrees for 30 minutes.  The result was a lovely fluffy loaf of bread with a lovely crust.  My bread machine has a large pan and the bread that comes out of it is too big to fit in the toaster.  It's a million times better than the very dense loaf I was getting with the recipe that came with my bread machine.  This is absolutely the best loaf of bread I've gotten with my machine.  It's now my "go to" recipe for a loaf of delicious white bread.

I didn't have vegetable oil so I used canola oil. Used bread flour .. put my machine on 1 1/2 lb. loaf. Followed exactly everything else. It was delish , light and better than store bought. Will keep as my go to white bread recipe. Loved it!

So simple and delicious....for years I have wanted to make bread. I was always so scared to try. I thought it was so complex and a lot of work. So I went to a thrift store and got a machine that I always see there for $7. Had most of the ingredients, had no idea there was "bread" flour... it came out perfect. My daughter keeps going back for more, and usually hates the crust, but she ate it crust and all. I'll be experimenting with the this thing for a while.

One of the best bread machine recipes I've ever tried.  I may try it again, but only use the bread machine to mix the dough and bake it in a loaf pan in the oven.

Great texture and it rose really well.  Very light.

This recipe is VASTLY improved with a few tweaks:

1.5 cups water instead of 1 cup
double the sugar amount and substitute honey
mix the warm water, honey and yeast in 1st and let  sit for 15-20 mins, then add the other ingredients and start.
most bread recipes can be improved with more water. a 33% water to flour ratio generally produces poor bread. 50% much better, you can go higher as well, experiment.

This is absolutely the best bread I have made. I am only a novice baker, but this had a fantastic rise and came out of the oven with a beautiful brown crust and a soft, tender texture on the inside. I usually use my bread machine on dough cycle and bake the bread in the oven. I find that the shape of the loaf is much better. Besides that, it smells fantastic baking.

Fell like a lead balloon.  Taste is a bit yeasty so I'll have to cut back on the yeast next go around rather than try to add more salt.

I love this recipe it makes a tall light bread that's moist on the inside and a wonderful flaky crust. T he only change I made was 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour for 1/2 cup of white flour. Excellent bread my husband is really picky and he loves it.

I loved it.  I did follow the instructions to a T but added an extra 1/2 t of salt. I watched as it mixed and it needed a little more water and I over did so I added a little more flour. What a great loaf!  I set the machine at 1.5 pound loaf and a medium crust.

Everyone in the family loved it.  Followed the recipe as written but did try one of the reviewers suggestions.  I added a tad more salt to react with the yeast.  This bread had the best consistency I've ever had from bread made in the bread machine.  I really think the yeast being activated prior to the remainder of the ingredients was the secret.

Thanks for an AWESOME recipe!  This comes out every time. I didn't have bread flour the first time and used all purpose...came out fine. I've made a whole wheat version...came out fine. I may never buy a loaf of bread again!

I have made this a few times now and my family and I love it. I have used olive oil but prefer the vegetable oil. I do add about 1 1/2 Tsp. salt and have had great results.  I use instant yeast and let it bubble for about 5 minutes and then add the rest of the ingredients and hit start. It almost lifts the lid of the bread machine. My kids love to watch it mix and rise.

An excellent basic white bread recipe. I've made this a half dozen times so far, and would recommend using a weight for the flour rather than volume measurement. I've had great results using 15 ounces of flour. Experimenting a little now - replacing the water with a light lager to deepen the flavor.

I double the recipe for my 2lb bread machine

*Use the 2 lb setting, light crust and white bread setting*

I also use whole wheat flour instead of white flour

I use melted butter rather than veg oil (better flavor)

I add a little honey since the whole wheat flour needs more moisture than ap flour

This recipe is easy to "play" with and add things to... milk instead of water, butter/olive oil, honey.... it's very forgiving!

I used apf instead of bread flour and it turned out great.   Super soft and fluffy inside.  Nice crispy crust.   Husband loves it.   Might try a tad more salt next time.   The top half fell about 1/2 to 3/4 inch.

Made this today with the following changes, as suggested by other users: used 2 TB honey instead of sugar, used regular flour instead of bread flour, 2 tsp bread maker yeast and 1 1/2 tsp salt, and this came out beautifully. Much, much better than the recipe that came with the bread maker. Was ready to sell my bread maker, but with this recipe, I'm a convert!

Delicious!!!   I read several reviews about the flour, and because I didn't have bread flour, I used enriched white flour.. The loaf was light and fluffy....  It didn't last long!!! I will for sure, make this again. Thank you for your recipe.  I am an inexperienced baker with a bread machine, and my loaf rose so high during the bake cycle, I thought it was going to open on it's own.... but, it was delicious!!

I've made it twice.  Both times I added salt per. other suggestions.  The first time I used organic unbleached white  flour from Costco and an estimated two tablespoons of vital wheat gluten.  The second time I subbed one cup of flour for multigrain bread flour and only one TB gluten.  Both times the bread was quite good and my family polished it off quickly.  The bread as I made it was more of a sandwich bread but it didn't last long enough for us to even try it.

This recipe is so much better than the recipe in my bread machine's manual. The bread made from that recipe went into the garbage. I did add another 1/2 tsp of salt as a reviewer suggested. Other than that followed the directions as written which as others have pointed out is contrary to machine manual recommendation. I'm very curious about that difference.  The loaf was made on a 1.5 lb setting.  New to using a bread machine, I was surprised how small the loaf is but the bread is light and tasty.

Made it just like the recipe, except a tiny bit more salt, came out perfect. I was skeptical of the yeast at first,  but it came out perfect. I think this will be my new go to white bread recipe.

Yummy!!! This turned out great. I will definitely be making this often. I doubled the recipe using the dough setting then split the dough in 2 loaves after the cycle was completed. I let the dough rise in loaf pans for about 45 minutes then baked in a 350 degree oven for 25 minutes . The bread is very moist and delicious. Next time I will bake it a few minutes longer though.

I've made this loaf twice. The first time I found the finished loaf to be very greasy. The flavor was OK but I did not enjoy the texture. The second time I made it I replaced 1/4 c of the water with milk and replaced the oil with butter. The loaf was not greasy, the texture more refined and the flavor was slightly improved.

Best tasting bread to ever come out of my bread machine!! since my house is cold my bread pan was cold so I let the yeast mixture set in the cup I heated the water in than I poured it into the bread pan after the 10min wait period.

loved it. First time I made it in the bread machine was not a fan. So I did it on dough cycle then let it rest for 45 min than in oven 350 for 30 min. Perfect just Perfect Question though why do the instructions not say the size of the loaf to set the bread machine at

This is my new go-to recipe... made it about 5 times now and it is SOOO good.  Unfortunately, it is so good, half of it usually doesn't last until the rest of the dinner is ready to eat!  The outside is crispy, the inside is soft and sweet.  Absolute heaven.

OMG you have to use this recipe! I am not a baker at all. I bought a bread machine and just had to make my first loaf. I followed this recipe, however, after reading the reviews, I added a little more salt.  I put my bread machine on medium crust, 1.5lb and BAM!!! My first loaf came out super perfect! Right now I have this recipe in my machine on the dough feature and I'm making cinnamon buns!

Flavorless to me but it is not bad.  One reviewer said not to use canola oil....He's right.  That gave it an off flavor.  Will either make again or find another recipe.  Like more flavor to my breads.

Added 1/2 tsp of salt. Perfection! Settings were for a 2pd loaf on medium setting. Definitely fool proof. Oh, and I just used regular all purpose flour vs. Bread Flour. It still turned out great though:)

I used one cup whole wheat flour and 2 cups bread flour.  I also used whey instead of the water.  I threw in some ground flax seed.  This came out amazing.  Everyone loved it...even my kids said the crust was almost edible, LOL!

What an excellent bread!   I too was a little taken aback by letting the yeast feed on the sugar water before putting in the flour.  I also used 1 tsp. of salt. It's simple and easy to make. I've made it several times now!

Finally a decent ( make that great!) Loaf of bread from my machine. I will use this method on a all my bread recipes and mixes. This is just the opposite of what all recipes  tell you to do. Light fluffy loaf of bread instead of heavy and crumbly like the other recipes. Thanks!

This turned out perfect! ... I am on my third loaf now ... I used almost, 2 teaspoons of salt and I don't know how much an ounce of yeast is, so I just put  slightly heaped teaspoon in ... other wise exactly the recipe!

Was very tasty! I just made it like any other bread in a bread machine, just made sure I used warm water and all ingredients were room temperature. I also added another tsp of salt. No problems with rising and falling of the dough.

Makes a delicious and tender loaf of white bread.  Versatile recipe.  We've added all sorts of different spices and cheeses and it comes out delicious every time.  One thing we did do different was use ADY (Active Dry Yeast) and proof the yeast in the machine before adding the other ingredients making sure to add salt last, and increased salt to 1-1/2 tsp.  We have done this in the bread machine completely, just on dough cycle and proofed the second time in bread pan before baking, and in the kitchenaid mixer/bread pan.  No matter what, it's foolproof... as long as we proofed the yeast first.

I followed recipe &'directions to a "T", bread never raised...all ingredients had current exp. dates, so that wasn't problem...and I noticed that my yeast my combo of yeast, warm water & sugar did not "foam", like the recipe instruction called for....Any idea of the problem? Anyone else had a similar situation? Sure was disappointed??

I have been using this recipe for several years.  Only difference is that I add the yeast last and place it n the flour.  1 1/2 tsp is all I use in my breadmaker.  
I also use this as my base recipe for other breads - just add seeds or flax and it turns out great every time!

I have tried a ton of bread recipes for my bread maker & most have been a complete flop. I typically use a milk bread recipe that turns out every time but I wanted to have another basic to rotate with. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because I did use some suggestions and altered a few things. I used honey in place of sugar (WIN!), used the 1.5 tsp of salt & I subbed EVOO for the vegetable oil. This turned out perfectly, very moist & tender. I love recipes like this where you can switch out a few things for your taste or shopping preferences and it still turns out well. I think flexible recipes are a must and I really appreciate the scientific reviews and reasons for adjustments, after all, baking is just science! Happy baking!

My mom gave me her old never used bread machine but it didn't have any directions or anything, so I depended solely on this recipe to make my first batch. It turned out lovely! I did add an extra 1/2 tsp of salt as suggested by previous reviewers and it seemed a little saltier than we liked, but overall it was delicious! It rose beautifully and had a crusty golden color. Will definitely make again, and again, and again!

I made this today and it came out beautiful.  I did make a few changes but it was more along the lines of technique.  I did add about 1/3 tsp extra of salt because because I thought it needed it.  I did use canola oil because I never use vegetable oil(personal preference) with out a hitch.  Most importantly though is that  whenever I'm making yeast breads, I always use bottled water and never tap.  Too many additives in tap water that can cause a recipe to fail;  such as fluoride, chlorine, rust or hard water.  So with all that being said, this is the best bread recipe I've made.  Soft and fluffy.

Excellent bread! I was nervous putting the yeast in with the water and sugar, but, really, it turned out perfectly! Gonna try that with my other  bread machine recipes, see how they turn out! Thanks for a great recipe!

This bread is easy and delicious! My 6 year old makes it by herself regularly (with supervision) and considers it the best recipe ever & her signature bread. I did have the loaf fall one time (no more baking after midnight for me!), but it still tasted great.

I've been making this bread 1x a week for about 6 months now. a couple of things I changed was having 3Tbsp of sugar and for the flour, I use 2.5cups white bread flour and 1/2 cup wholewheat bread flour. these are one of the softest breads we've ever made in the bread maker! it also makes amazing croutons for mushroom soup!

I added the 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt and the 2 1/4 of  yeasts.. My recipe modification is also 2 cups of flour and 1 cup of wheat flour.. For me it makes a good basic bread that is both good for toast or sandwiches..

Made this loaf and it was delish!!!!!!! Took the advice and subbed 1/2 c whole wheat in with the white flour and added 1/2 tsp extra of salt. Also used butter instead of oil. Did not let yeast proof as per someone's advice since I had IDY on hand. After 15 years of storage, I think my bread machine will be getting a work out! Very good recipe. Thank you!  :)

Just made this and it was pretty good... I just purchased an OLD breadman machine off Craigslist and failed 3 times using their own instructions/recipe.
  I finally had somewhat of a success with this recipe. I found a huge indentation on the top...So, it must have risen too much and fell...there was a big empty hole under the indentation. But, after cutting that part off...the rest was a beautiful quarter loaf. Pretty tasty, too.
 I had already decreased the yeast to 2 tsp and increased the sugar to 2 1/2Tbl and the salt to 1 1/2tsp. 
I'll have to decrease the yeast again as others have said to do but, increase the sugar to 3tbl and keep the salt the same.

This is so easy, and it comes out perfect every time! I substitute half the white flour with whole wheat, and instead of oil, I use melted butter. In addition, I add two TBS of cooked brown rice to get a chewy texture in the bread. Last but not least, try substituting molasses for the sugar!

Even though my bread machine's manufacturer says that I need to add yeast lastly on flour, I gave this recipe a try. And it turned out a very fluffy, delicious and big bread. I absolutely loved it.

Used 1/2 tsp extra salt as recommended in one of the other comments since I've had problems with bread rising and it came out perfect! Crusty on the outside and nice and soft inside. Will definitely keep this recipe on hand for a good basic white bread.

This is a great recipe.   I added 1 additional tablespoon sugar to the flour.  I used light olive oil for the oil.  I also mixed the  2 T of sugar with the yeast in the bed pan and waited the 10 min suggested in the recipe.   This recipe has never failed and it is light and delicious!

This recipe did not work in my electric Kenmore bread maker. The bread came out hard, flat and did not rise. I did it again but did it the more traditional way and added yeast at the end and didn't let it touch the liquid and it came out to perfection.

Great bread loaf for a beginner! Followed the instructions, but as other baker will reduce the quantity of yeast to 2 tsp, as by loaf fall as well. Regardless, tastes great, crunchy and my man is happy :)

Bread turned out nice and soft. First time baking with my new Kenwood bread machine and it was a success. Will definitely do it again and try some of the modifications with the substituting of 1/2 cup of whole wheat floor for 1/2 cup of bread floor to see the difference.

Worked well, but doesn't make a full size loaf in my machine. I would double the recipe to fill my bread maker.

My daughter-in-law bought me a bread machine for Christmas.  It's been in hiding for 5 years because I could never get a good loaf out of the recipe book that came with it.  I brought it out the other day and tried this recipe.  Superb bread!  The only change I made was to add an extra 1/2 tsp. salt, per the recommendation of a previous reviewer.  Came out perfect!  Here it is two days later, and I'm making it again....

Changes I made, I did dissolve the yeast in warm water and 3 Tbsp. Sugar, then added 1/4 cup melted butter, 2 cups multigrain best for bread flour and 1 cup all purpose white flour and 1 1/2 tsp. salt. Used the Dough setting.  Next time I will try 2 cups all purpose and 1 cup multigrain. Bake at 325 for 25 minutes

This is a nice recipe but the loaf had a tendency to fall.  I also don't use vegetable oil in my bread; I don't like the flavor.  The vegetable oil plus the water was way too much liquid for my machine, and too much liquid can make a loaf fall. So I substituted 1/2 of a stick of butter, cut into small pieces and mixed in with the flour, in place of the oil, and got a beautiful, smooth, high loaf that did not fall.

Perfect loaf.  I used canola oil and 1/2 tsp. more salt called for.  I also used all purpose flour adding 1/4 t. salt and 1 1/2 t. baking powder to each cup flour. Yummy.

The first time I made this bread it was amazing but now I can't seem to make it again. I have tried 6 different times. Followed directions to the T, even tried different oil, new yeast and different sugar when my attempts seemed 'bread'less. Don't know what I am doing wrong. But if I can ever manage to make it again. I am very happy that this bread is really good.

This is like a DUH. The recipe on the jar reads different. This makes more scientific sense and comes out way better.

Only bread I ever really make anymore. I do have a few things to say. If you use QUICK bread settings (1hr I suggest doubling yeast or your bread will be denser and not quite firm at same time. Not the best setting). Second like you've read, add 1/2 tsp of salt or it won't be anything like it should be. Thirdly I have a home in the mountains 7,000 ft elevation. The water ratio is fine. But in my Dallas Texas home I need to eye ball it at first and always need to add a couple tbsp of water at a time to get it to mix. Usually 4-6 tbsp is enough and if it does get sticky I sprinkle a tiny bit of flour. But I don't get it completely mixed in my oster bread maker with out a little extra water. I have a 2 lb bread maker and this rises till it touches the glass. It's fluffy and yummy. And super easy for a family of five to scarf with a meal lol. It's THAT good. Yummmmm have it in the oven. Ow. Who needs glade plug ins when you have a bread maker???!!! :)

I didn't have "bread flour" just regular all purpose flour.  The yeast didn't "foam" at all.  The bread didn't rise.  It is just a solid, heavy ball.  It tastes ok.  I won't be using this recipe again.

Based on a positive review, I added 1/2 tsp more salt than the recipe called for as suggested to regulate the yeast activity.  I didn't care for it.  Had a faint "salty" taste."

So easy and turns out great every time!  Sometimes I make it as is, other times I change out some white flour for whole wheat, add ground flax or change oil for melted butter.  Each times it's delicious and my family devours it!  Yum!

Best and easiest bread I've ever made! I did increase the salt to 1.5 tsp and used instant yeast without soaking it first. Turned out phenomenal! Have to be careful not to eat the whole loaf in one sitting!

I saw IcyBlueRose's comment about adding the 1/2 tsp extra salt and did that my first time making it. I was feeding about 8 people who all said the bread was delicious. I haven't tried it with the regular amount of salt the recipe calls for, so I have nothing to compare the results to, but it is a good loaf a bread, and simple enough my 4 year old can help make most of it! I made my loaf last night, and have another one started for tonights dinner!

A year or so ago I  tried a friends home made machine bread and was very disappointed. 
Surprise Surprise. My very first loaf in a brand new machine came out almost perfect. Great recipe. No more store bought for me.

This recipe is so easy and I have ALWAYS had good results with it. One thing I change is that I make it in the dough cycle and then transfer it to a greased loaf pan and let it rise for 30 minutes. Then I bake it at 350 for about 30 minutes. My family inhales it! Our favorite way to eat it is with honey butter. Mix with a fork a half stick of room temp butter with 2 Tbl honey. Sooooo good!

This is a good basic recipe, however I think you have to be careful not to add salt to the yeast mix (use one and a half total), because when I added a little and prepared it as the recipe said, I got a fluffy, tangled loaf that was hollowing, fallen, and more pull-apart then slice. I tried it again according to the bread machine and used kosher salt and t was perfect for slicing. I even subbed one cup of flour for white whole wheat and it has great texture.

I followed the Most Helpful Review and added an extra 1/2 tsp of salt to combat the potential rise issue and I had no problems whatsoever. I made it exactly as the recipe states and it was a big hit. The house smell wonderful and the warm bread with butter made the 3 hour wait worthwhile! I had no trouble removing the blade from the loaf pan of the bread maker. Next time I will add some rosemary just for fun. This is a terrific base recipe to use as is and build upon!

Excellent bread machine recipe. I made this the other day and it came out perfect, I will try reducing the amount of sugar in it to improve the flavor otherwise it's the best bread that has come out of my bread machine!

This was delicious!!! My family loves fresh bread. I started this recipe in my machine with the dough setting. Then I baked it in the oven at 375* for 30 minutes after punching it down, splitting the dough into two loaf pans and letting it rise again for about 40min.  Turned out perfectly!

Everyone LOVES this bread.  It is 100% the favorite go to that will never disappoint.  I have changed a few minor things… I added a little molasses, honey and applesauce, total free style portion.  I also filled the required 1/4 cup vegetable oil with 1/2 coconut oil (so 1/8 of each). I don't think those changes are necessary but it always turns out delicious.  :)

Great recipe! I often do half wheat flour,  and it turns out delicious (but doesn't rise as high,  not sure how to fix that). This bread is wonderful for sandwiches and toast!

I followed the recipe as is and it delivered exactly as promised ... nice crusty outside with a delicious soft and fluffy inside. Made it several times since and it doesn't last 10 minutes in my house.

I don't know what went wrong...  Along with all of the other reviewers, I went against what the instruction book said.  I put the yeast, water and honey (instead of sugar) in, left it froth for 10 minutes, then added the other ingredients and set it on white.  It came out dense and very short - the height of a regular loaf of bread, rather than as tall as the pan (like other breads).  I increased the salt to 1.5 tsp, since a reviewer said something about doing that because of the tendency to fall, and I did add a tablespoon of butter like another reviewer said.  It tastes good, but is definitely not light and fluffy.

I love this recipe. I adjusted salt to 1&1/2 tsp as precious review suggested. I also added 2t honey to the mix because I was looking for a sweeter breakfast bread, and reduced yeast to 2&1/8 t to counteract the way the honey caused the bread to rise the top of the machine.  Overall we love the taste and texture of this recipe. It makes me hesitant to go back to the bread machine instructions at all, since this works so well.

Made with butter.  Use 1 1/2 tsp salt and a little more sugar.  Sub 1/2 c. Whole wheat flour.  Excellent bread.

Try  2.5 tbls of brown sugar, 2 tsp of cinnamon, 2 tbls of honey and 2/3 c. of raisins  (no white sugar) and set machine to "fruit & nut bread" setting.

Best recipe I have tried. It differs from the bread machine instructions to include yeast with the other dry ingredients. I haven't had good luck with other recipes, but this is easy and makes a delicious loaf. I find 2 teaspoons fresh yeast is plenty because apparently you don't want to over yeast. Also, I use 2-3 tablespoons sugar and find it doesn't matter if all purpose or bread flour. Sometimes I sprinkle some cinnamon in with the flour for a more fragrant loaf. It is good toasted or not.

It was good, but I had a hard time cutting it even with my bread knife!
I am going to try it again by adding a little more salt as one viewer mentioned.  I'll let you know.

My first try at my new bread maker.  I used this recipe but altered the measurements based on the other posts I read (increased salt a bit, decreased yeast, etc). Bread came out great!

Hands down.  Easiest and tastiest bread I have made.  Use an electric knife to cut and it does not fall.  Also let the bread rest for 10 min.  Again...amazing.

I would like to try this recipe right now, but I  not sure what loaf size to choose on my machine (Cuisinart CBK 200)
The recipe says 1 or 1.5 pound. But there are two different buttons on the machine, which one will be better? 
Should I choose 1 or 1.5 pound loaf program? 
Thank you very much for any tips!

I was afraid this wasn't going to rise because the directions require that you add the yeast to the water and not to the dry ingredients as is usually recommended. Instead it rose too much; puffing out to fill the top of the breadmaker, and as a result, not browning on top. I finished it in the oven under the broiler for a minute or two. I had to cut off the "muffin top" to be able to slice the rest of the loaf for sandwiches. Taste and texture very good for sandwiches. Might need to tweak this a little to get it to bake more uniformly.

I have made this bread several times by the exact recipe and we LOVE it!  There have been times when I didn't have bread flour and just substituted all-purpose flour. The results have always been great!  Earlier this week, my husband asked me to make it for Communion. It's been a while since I made it so I was having difficulty locating the printed recipe.  I gave up and began searching this website.  Hoping I had the right one, I decided that from now on I will store the recipe inside the bread machine so I wouldn't lose it again. When I got ready to make the bread this morning, I opened my bread machine, and found my printed copy.  I guess I had the same great idea last time, haha.

I had no issues with the basic white bread recipe, but I did find it too sweet. I'd be apt to leave the sugar out completely next time; it's not necessary.

This is the BEST Bread we have made yet! We changed a couple items and its wonderful! We use coconut oil instead of the vegetable oil, also we use all natural unbleached sugar. This is so good that it is all the family wants to eat bread wise anymore.

I really like this bread I did change it up a bit. Instead of adding extra salt, so it does'ent fall I add a Tab.S.of salted butter and use honey instead of sugar.And I do use Canola oil I hav'ent had a prob. with it... Very good. Also could add fresh rose mary and a egg it's a little heavier but good...

What's with the random warning against canola oil, without details, and what's with all the "helpful" votes?  How is that helpful?  This recipe works fine as written, except I, too, used an extra 1/2 tsp salt.

I followed the recipe to the letter (something I rarely do). I even used a thermometer to test the water temp. It didn't rise so it was a lump of dough that actually burned on the bottom. I had just bought the yeast and it's supposed to be good for 2 more years. I will try again with another new packet of yeast. I have had success with other breads in my bread machine so I know it's not the machine. I'll let you know how the next batch does!

This  recipe is great and so easy to follow. I put all the ingredients in my bread machine and I'm done. I set my machine and we have fresh hot homemade bread. This is not a fussy recipe, very simple to follow. I love it.

Thank you I had given up on making my own bread but forgot to buy some when I went shopping, so I looked for an easy recipe and came across yours. It turned out great for my first time bread making in ages, just had a slice with jam....hmmmmm. I was never happy with my previous attempts as they were too dense and heavy, now I'm looking forward to trying wholemeal and fruit loaves and rolls. No more bought bread for me.

Never used a bread machine before, found this recipe and LOVE it. Putting the yeast and the water together made a huge difference. Can't wait to try other breads.

This recipe is fantastic! I've made three different breads with it now, and they all turned out great! For raisin bread, I added two tbs cinnamon and one cup of raisins. For wheat bread, I used two cups of whole wheat flour and one cup bread flour. Delicious !

I made this bread at a higher altitude ( I live at 8000 ft!) so I added 1 tsp more of salt and cooked it on the wheat setting of my bread machine.  Perfect!

Perfect! Nothing wrong with this recipe at all!!!!  My daughter who is picky loved it!  Easy and simple.  FYI - I did make one mistake there is a review here that recommends their own version of this recipe but as a cinnamon raisin bread from AliciaVR6. DO NOT MAKE IT!!  It was really bad when I made it.  I mean really really bad.  I made it twice to see what I was doing wrong since the original recipe is so good.  I ruined two good loaves of bread and will have to throw them into bread pudding instead.  Something goes wrong and the bread is very doughy and somehow the yeast is affected as it will not rise as well as the original recipe.  I am going to just stick to this recipe and get great bread every time!!

I just made this for the first time in my hand-me-down bread machine from my mom. Everyone loved it and its nearly gone...well 1/3 is left after packing lunches. I saw alot of diff reviews i followed the instruction and the crust was crunchy middle soft and fluffy add butter and melt in your mouth. It was a sandwich dinner night with a fresh homemade loaf of bread. I have decided to try homemade breads since i have the machine and will be looking forward to trying new recipes :)

Just tried this bread for the first time.. yummy... my husband is on his 4th piece.  I tried the suggestion of adding 1/2 tsp more of salt and I used Canola Oil.  Great rise and great texture.  Will be using the recipe again!

Best recipe I've found yet!!!  I made it exactly as written the first time, except I used coconut oil and it tasted very buttery!!!  Loved it!!!  I'm still playing with it...  Made a few modifications today and even better!!!  I added 1/4 cup (unground) flaxseed, used honey rather than sugar and reduced the salt to 1 1/2 tsp, as recommended by many!  I used the "light crust" setting and 1 1/2 lb. loaf size.  Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!!!

This recipe has given me trust issues. Why? Because CLEARLY the bread machine people don't want us to have perfect bread with all their crazy rules and no water-touching-yeast business. I've been using my bread machine for ages now and I've actually had loaves FAIL. How hard can bread machine bread be!? But this..wow. The crust ALONE is worth making it. I did modify but purely by necessity; I ran out of yeast and used 2 tsp instead of 2.25 tsp (absolutely no difference from what I can see/taste and I did a 2 lb loaf) and I used part unbleached white flour and part whole wheat (more unbleached than WW). I also only let the yeast proof for 7 minutes because I was excited/in a rush to get the bread going. Again, huge delicious loaf that I now have to try and save some for the rest of the family!

I tried this recipe recently and although it was tasty it was very crumbly probably due to being dry. I think it probably needed more oil.

Good simple recipie. In previous reviews people talk about consistence issues. I take the dough out while its mixing. Break it into small pieces and put it back in to be churned. Before it cooks I put the dough into a slightly above room temp oven to prooof. After it rose I'd put a few cuts in the top and bake. I only use the machine to kneed essentially

I made this for my family and they LOVED it.  I added an traditional half a teaspoon of salt as another review mentioned.  The texture was amazing.  We commented that this would be great for fondue, french toast, and sandwiches.  This is a keeper.  NOTE:  It took me 4 hours in my bread machine.  We were finished with dinner when my loaf was done.  It became the first course of dessert.  ;o)

This turned out beautifully though I have to add an additional 1/2 cup of flour like all other bread recipes due to my bread machine.  I also bake my bread in the oven for 30 minutes at 375 as my machine's bread pan is an awkward shape.  My hubby loves this bread for his sandwiches.  Thanks for sharing.

Top sunk in and the bread fell apart. I was hoping that it would work as a soup-dipper until I tasted it. It was bland, almost bitter. If it helps anyone I'm using a Sanyo 10 home bakery.

Well it certainly doesn't look like the picture up there (I don't think that much bread will fit in a machine) however, it did come out very good.  I'm trying it again today with Bread flour and Cinnamon to see how that turns out.

On my third loaf now, I used a bit more yeast, a bit more salt, melted better instead of oil and cheddar and bacon bits. My husband loves it!

Have tried various bread machine recipes and I must admit this is best by FAR. The loaf went the same day and its now a regular in my house. Even my fussy eating children love it. I followed the method to the t even doubting the packaged yeast process but it works beautifully and I think makes the difference to the texture.

Have to say I've been avoiding this recipe for awhile. But when you get to the store and pay over $3 for a loaf of bread you re-organize cabinets.  Excellent results!  My new best friend! I need to play with it to make rolls then shoot my keyboard!

I agree with ICYBLUEROSE I used 1.5 tsp of salt instead of 1tsp. It was the only bread that rose to the top and it is wonderful! I'm so grateful for this recipe. Thank you!

I haven't made this recipe yet. Just wondering why you use rapid rise yeast but don't use the rapid bake setting. Before I make it I want to be sure I am using the right setting. I just bought the cuisinart bread machine and the first two loaves were pretty heavy and dense. The third loaf I made I used the rapid rise recipe and it is kind of small but tastes pretty good. I think the water perhaps could have been warmer. I put it in the microwave to warm up but wasn't close to 100 degrees. Probably 70 degrees. I hope I get a response here. I can't wait to try this recipe.

I used 2.5 c bread flour and .5 c rye flour, added caraway seeds.  Also Dec yeast to 2 top and Inc salt to 1.5 tsp.  PERFECTION.  Soft in middle and crew crust, better than what you get at the market.  I took out of bread machine for the 3rd rise and baked in oven at 350 for 30 minutes as I wanted regular bread  shape and I don't like the paddle stuck in bread.

I tried this recipe as is the first time around because i am a firm believer in trying the recipe before making any modifications. It was really good but too dense for my taste. My second time around here is what i modified; i subbed the sugar for honey, the oil for clarified butter and increased the salt to 1 1/2 tsp. it was amazing! Great taste, not too dense or too airy. I am only giving this 4 stars because of the modifications. The taste was excellent both times.

This has become my favorite, never fail recipe. I make it every 3 or 4 days. Turns out great every time! I am in a higher elevation, so I had to fiddle with the yeast, but it makes a soft bread that doesn't dry out.

Amazing!!!  This is the first time we were able to make bread this soft with our bread machine - my kids totally loved it (but not the ones we made without foaming as we used Active Dry Yeast).  Thanks and I'm sure we'll stay with this for a very long time.

Oh this bread is divine! Easy to make. And I am into making my life easier. Very few ingredients and that is a plus for me. Love the texture of this bread and I can't keep it very long before I have to make another loaf. I did exchange some of the bread flour for whole wheat. I like whole wheat bread.

The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly. It was delicious. I have also made it with half whole wheat flour and added a 1/4 cup of ground flax seed. Also delicious.  The texture, moisture level, crust, and flavor are fantastic. This is really a great base recipe just waiting for any mix-ins you can dream up. The only thing even close to negative I could say is that the loaf is HUGE. My boyfriend had to eat some of his lunch sandwich before going to work because it was too big for his sandwich container (He thought that was pretty cool).

Soooo I bought my first bread maker at a garage sale for $8! Came home and looked up some recipes. Then one hadthe best reviews so I gave it a shot. I out the water,sugar,and yeast in the bread making basket thinngy ans d let it foam for the 10 mins. and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I put it in the bread maker at night to be ready in the morning. It was PERFECTTTT!!!! Such a delicious loaf!

Amazing bread recipe!! I did what another reviewer said and only added 2tsp of yeast- excellent!! I also play with the flour I use, I mix it up half whole wheat, half white, or half multigrain with half amount of white. Doesn't matter what flour I use, it turns out great every time. We cut loaf in half as it rises so well!

This bread is delicious! Followed the recipe exactly and the bread was the best I ever made. I have had a bread machine for several years and could never get the bread to turn out right. I tried different recipes and always had the same "not so great" results. But this bread was fantastic. I finally found a good recipe! Makes me so happy !!

This recipe is excellent. I don't know exactly how many loves I have made but I am now on my third bag of bread flour. Switching one cup of white with whole wheat works well. We have not bought store bread now for quite a while. For the last few loaves I have baked in oven because I prefer the shape of the loaf in a bread pan. This bread makes excellent toast, especially with whole wheat variety.

This is my go-to recipe for making bread in my bread machine. I'm not sure why others have had issues with this bread "falling" as I have yet to have this problem. It tastes wonderful and the texture is perfect. I even have a neighbor that loved it so much that he pays me to bake him fresh bread!

Just came out of the bread machine & it smells so good. I tried what other reviewers have said by adding honey & 1/2 cup of wheat flour. Oh Yum! I will try olive oil next time. I added a sprinkle more salt as well.

I added the extra 1/2 teaspoon salt. I also added 2 tablespoons powdered milk. The results were the best tasting white bread I have ever eaten in my life.

I've tried this recipe twice. Once as directed in the recipe, once with the addition of a little extra salt. Both times it failed to rise and made a dense loaf without much flavor. I won't be using this recipe again.

I was recently gifted a bread machine and promptly went searching for a good bread recipe. This was a good starter recipe, rose up well, and tasted nice. I've used this one a number of times now while getting used to my bread machine. It's a good basic recipe, though I will say it is best eaten fresh, as it is not very good the next day. Overall, though, it was decent.

Just ok.  Crust was good, golden but not as lite and airy as expected.  Will keep as a backup recipe but not excited about it.

After trying several recipes for Bread Machines, this is the only one that worked. The recipe is quick and easy . I followed my machines' instructions (yeast last) and it still turned out perfect. My bread reached the top, and was soft and tasty.  Now I'm going to experiment with adding other ingredients such as rasins, carrots, etc. I'm very pleased to find this recipe.

I've used this recipe many times and it always turns out good.  However, the last couple of times I made it I used semolina flour to make semolina bread.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe, other than using semolina flour instead of all purpose flour, and it turned out perfect!  The first time I did it, I thought it might be a fluke, but after today, I know this is the perfect recipe for semolina bread too!  I set my machine on the basic setting with a medium crust for a 1.5 lb. loaf.  I don't know why one reviewer said to not use Canola oil.  I use it all the time without any problem.  I use a Cooks bread machine, and I get semolina flour at an Amish market in Columbus, New Jersey. Thanks for a great, easy recipe that ALWAYS yields a perfect loaf.  I'm going to try rye flour next!

First home made bread I have made. We eat it hot straight from the bread maker with butter and jam.  My family really liked it.  I feel like something is missing though, like it needs maybe a little more salt or something not sure?

I've had a bread machine for over 20 years, and have tried many recipes (both with the machine and without). This is a very interesting preparation, and I have made it a few times with very good results. I use canola oil, and find the bread turns out well regardless of the oil type used. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Excellent crusty, plain white bread. This was the first recipe I tried in my new bread machine, and it came out beautifully. Tastes like a water challah for those familiar with challahs.

British bread!!  Ok, if you are like me and you are on the search for moist, chewy English style bread then look no further.  Your search has ended.  Some slight modifications are required to make it taste exactly like warburtons loaf.  Double the water (to 2 cups) and add 4 teaspoons of gluten.  Add a bit more oil (I use grape seed) and a bit more salt.  Thank god, no more dry, fluffy garbage from the supermarket.  Quality bread.  Outstanding!

Awesome recipe! I have modified this to add the extra salt and use 2 tbs agave instead if sugar. It makes a great loaf that is soft and stYs that way. I gave to stop my breadmaker about 10 mins early to prevent overbrownong even on the light cycle. This isn't the recipe, it is just my particular machine. Just added that if anyone has the same problem to let them know it's ok to stop the machines baking time early.

This is the best white bread ever! The first time I made this, I followed the instructions even though it went against the order my machine says to put them in and was impressed with how big the bread got.  The second time, we decided to follow the order stated in my owners manuel (liquid, dry ingredients, yeast last in a well)and the bread got too tall for the machine.  It was actually pressed against the glass window.  lol  We will be making this recipe a lot.  We didn't make any changes to the ingredient list or the measurements.  This is perfect as is! Thank you for posting such an amazing recipe and to those who have posted reviews about this (which is why I chose to try it in the first place).

This is my favorite white bread recipe. It is so versatile and easy to make. I like to just use the dough setting in my breadmachine and then make the dough into whatever I want. The rolls are my family's favorites.

Wonderful! I've never used my bread-maker before this and was nervous. Used 2 1/2 cups white four and 1/2 cup wheat flour. I'm going to up it to 1 cup wheat flour next time! A wonderful, basic sandwich bread.

Used all the right ingredients and followed the recipe. Bread turned out extremely dense and dry, and the crust was really thick. Didn't taste bad, but not really great bread like all the other reviews suggested. I won't be making it again.

The only thing I did differently was add a little more salt as suggested in a couple other comments. My sons loved it. It never made it to the bread container.

Very good, light and fluffy. Much better than the basic recipe that came with my bread machine's recipe book.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I ended up making two loaves yesterday because my first loaf was gone within minutes. I'm not even kidding. I did add some Italian seasoning, parsley, and garlic powder because I love seasoned bread. I didn't measure it out, but I did end up having to add about 1/2cup more water because the dough was very dry. It was definitely because of the added seasonings, because I followed the recipe as written for the second loaf. I also read through other reviews and many said to add 2 tsp of salt instead of 1 tsp to keep it from falling. Worked like a charm. I will definitely be making this one (multiple times a day!) again.

This recipe was really easy and delicious. I did have a problem however with the crust being to hard. I do think I just need to mess with my bread machine and change some settings. Other than the crust it was awesome!

I just tried this recipe, and it does seem to be pretty foolproof, I even changed a couple of things, I used half self rising flour(a def no no according to my bread maker instructions) and half all purpose flour for the flour part, and active yeast for the yeast part..when fully cooked it was about a half inch from the top of the pan, and might have been a little denser than some would like, but I actually like the uniform texture, it slices easily, and makes great sandwiches :)

I actually joined this site because this recipe was that awesome. It came out light, fluffy, just as advertised. The next time I make this, I'm going to go with slightly less yeast, just to give it more density. Using an Oster Expressbake, this came out better than store bought bread, and it slices great after cooling. It also toasts well in a toaster oven once made.

The absolute best bread! I increased the salt to 1 1/2 tsp, used 2 TBS of honey. I also used 1 1/2c organic whole wheat flour and 1 1/2c unbleached organic white flour instead of the bread flour. I waited until the yeast, water and honey were nice and foamy before I added the rest of the recipe. I did use canola oil. I baked 2 loaves, 1 in the bread machine and 1 in my loaf pan. I allowed the dough to rise for 45 min in the loaf pan before placing it a preheat 350 deg oven. It took about 18min. My 12 son saw it cooling and said "that is one ugly loaf of bread". He tasted it and said "unless dad doesn't like it, we will never again buy store bread". I am not a big bread eater but this is the bomb!!! Super super easy.

Seriously LOVE this recipe. I love it the way it is, and I love the small alterations I've made to it. I typically add about 2 tbsp. milk to this recipe because it's a tad bit too dry when I measure it out. I sometimes add 1/4 cup of local honey as well. It always comes out tender, delicious, and makes my home smell like a fresh bakery. Everyone in my house loves it (including my picky two year old, picky four year old, and husband!)

It's the only recipe so far that seems to work correctly in my bread machine, but the downside, if you can call it that, is that it taste  like ordinary bread that I buy from the store. I may have to try some suggestions from other reviewers here about different ingredients.

All the other recipes I tried came out way too dense, but the bread itself was outstandingly delicious, almost like a pastry. Just munching on the crust was a real treat. But being so dense it was unsuitable for sandwiches. I may have to try them again using regular yeast and adding a little more salt like I did with this one.

I added a little less than 1/2 tsp more of salt and used sunflower oil and this bread came out incredible good. Now, since it doesn't have any spoiling ingredients I set it up overnight and wake up to the smell of bread, it smells like a bakery. Thanks for the recipe and tips.

Made this last week in a Magic Chef Bread Machine that I picked up for $8 at a second hand store. It turned out wonderfully and my husband gobbled it up. We used it for sandwiches and toast and it was GREAT. Will be my go to white bread recipe from now on.

Enjoyed this bread. It is a solid loaf with a nice light taste. Will certainly make it again. BTW - I used EVOO (extra virgin olive oil) and increased salt to 1 1/2 tsp.

This came out sooo soft and chewy! BEWARE: for those considering following the advice to add more salt like I did....it made my bread rise too high. It was touching the top of my bread maker and left a yucky doughy mess on the lid and window! Next time, I will stick with 2 tsp of salt. But this for sure will be my go-to bread recipe from now on!!

Good but the top of mine fell in. I used 1/2 cup of wheat flour. Maybe add more salt next time to prevent top from falling.

This is the only recipe I use now, and I make it 2-3 times a week. For variety I sometimes use 2 cups of bread flour, and one cup of whole wheat flour,1/4 cup of ground flax seeds and 1 tablespoon of vital wheat gluten. Either way is delicious, and both methods also make great toast!

I loved this recipe, but it works so much better when you do use warm water and make it at that moment. Not leaving it there for it to be ready for tomorrow morning. I put chopped walnuts in this last time and it was awesome! BTW I used olive oil every time ;)

Th.is is the best bread my bread maker has ever put out. Usually my bread turns out hard.  This is a great sandwich loaf.  I've made a loaf every day this week. I also sent two loafs to my son in La...Light bread. But, my maker cooks in 3 hrs & 30 min.Ruderuth

crust was hard and the bread was dry.  I will try it again, but don't expect much to change.  I did follow the directions and took the advice of adding more salt.

I did not like this recipe. Followed the recipe exactly and my bread was dry and crumbly but I DO live at altitude so maybe that is why

I tried this recipe for the first time today, but changed the warm water to warm milk, use olive oil, and added 1 tablespoon of brown sugar in addition to the white sugar after I added the flour to the yeast mixture. I replaced 1 cup of bread flour with wheat flour... the outcome is a fluffy wheat bread with a hint of sweetness!!! LOVE IT!  Thank you so much for this recipe!

Now my go-to bread recipe. I had a bit of over-rising for my liking when I first used it, but added whole wheat flour, gradually increasing the amount until I had the more dense texture I like.  I also use grape seed or olive oil.  I LOVE this recipe and will try the other suggestions--seems so adaptable and is therefore BEST.

Wow I was scared as there was one really bad review about this bread.
WOW IT WAS WRONG!!!

This bread rocked!!! I did use 1 1/2 tsp salt as I do believe in the science of the bread and yum!!!!

Do you think the bad comment person was having a bad day?

 Do it!!!!! It rocks!!!

This recipe is amazing! Definitely the best one I have found to date. I prefer to use the "Dough" setting and bake the bread in the oven. Turned out better than expected. I will be using this one from now on, hands down. Easy, few ingredients and an impressive loaf when done!

This is by far the best bread recipe I have tried.  This is my for keeps recipe, its easy, ingredients are always on hand, the bread comes out soft, easy to slice and delicious just like store bought without the preservatives. I did however substitute butter in place of oil since I love that butter smell in bread.

I tried this in my old sojirushi and pressed quick bread (instead of basic bread)setting accidentally. It did a great job Kudos to the ol soji!!!But the bread seemed bland. Next time I will make adjustments for flavor.So good formula, but consider reviews of those who didn't change the entire thing(lol) but only made a few subs.

I have been making this for months now. I cannot, ok , will not buy bread now. The only thing I do different like another poster suggested was to bake this in 2 9 x 5 loaf pans for 25 minutes. This is THE BEST BREAD I have ever had!

I have been trying to make bread for years in my machine with very limited success. This one came out great though. Really perfect sandwich bread. I subbed a cup each of bread flour, all purpose, and whole wheat. I also cut the sugar down to a short Tbs. and put in a bit of honey with the yeast. It rose nicely and evenly, and it tastes delicious. Thanks! This will be a weekly recipe for me!

Adjusted to 16 servings, used 1 tbsp of yeast. Came out the same size as the 3 pound recipes in my book, but very fluffy, not dense or chewy at all. Very nice.

My family and I love this recipe both with and without the vegetable oil.  Making this recipe without the oil makes the bread a bit less moist; however, it gives the bread a sweeter flavor.

The only good thing about this recipe, is that it is super easy!  It made a loaf of bread just fine (rose to very top of bread machine, but still ok), but the taste was not good at all.  It was bland and salty, and you could definitely tell that it had been made with oil and not butter! I am going to try this same concept recipe, but use butter instead of the oil, decrease both the yeast and salt amounts and maybe add an extra sprinkle of sugar.

This is the first recipe I have made in my bread machine that I actually LOVED!  I was beginning to think I would never enjoy any bread I baked in there.  The only modification I made was using honey instead of sugar as other reviewers suggested.  Thank you for posting this recipe - it will definitely be a staple in my house!!!

This is the best machine bread I've had!I used a half tablespoon more sugar and a touch more salt as the other reviews suggested.  I followed the instructions exactly and it turned out wonderful. Had it as toast this morning and made sandwiches for lunch with it.  Nice crust, nice rise, great texture.

This was really good. I made exactly as stated. I think the next time I will turn the crust down to light instead of medium as it got a bit dark but that is my machine not the recipes fault. My hunny was like a little kid with it and keep watching the bread maker and then was sitting on the floor with grape jelly and the leftover bag of bread when I got home the next day. Will be using this recipe as stated often in the future. I didn't have bread machine yeast but the active dry worked well in this recipe

THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!! This bread is awesome!  I was a little worried about doing it this way than the way the manual tells you to do it. It asked for liquid, dry then yeast. But if you follow this recipe as exactly as follows, then the result is amazing! I was so shocked to see how good it turned out. It was perfect. Nice crust on the outside and the inside was nice and soft. PERFECT BREAD RECIPE. I will keep this one for sure. **** you hAve to use bread flour. Reading some of the reviews made me nervous, but it turned out wonderfully! THANKS FOR SHARING! :)  my husband says Thank you too!

Good enough bread. Nothing extra special. I used melted butter instead of oil and as per reader suggestions increased the amount of salt to 1-1/4 tsp. I did like the fact that the crust was not thick like the other recipes I have tried in my bread maker.

I just tried this recipe. I have a 3 lb breadmaker so I figured it couldn't hurt to give a 1 1/2 lb loaf a try....wrong!  The smoke is clearing out of my house as I type.  This recipe overflowed and went all over the element.  I would be very skeptical to try a recipe again that let the yeast work prior to adding the other ingredients.  I would love to know what I did wrong.

This turned out perfectly delicious the first time with the recipe exactly as written (other than added 1.5 TB wheat gluten). The bread was perfectly slice-able for sandwiches with 3TB wheat gluten the second time around (one TB per cup of flour). Regardless of the gluten, this recipe is a KEEPER.

Yesterday, I bought a bread machine and made my first (basic) loaf of bread. It was bland...bland, bland, bland. Tonight, I attempted this recipe. I followed the instructions to a T, and I experienced what I've seen many other bakers seem to have experienced. It fell. :( Which is quite a shame, because the taste was wonderful, and it seemed quite promising! The crust was a bit crunchier than I'd prefer, and I used the "Light" crust setting. I'm hoping to try again using some of the suggestions in the comments.

I was nervous to try this recipe because it didn't follow the conventional recipe methods for my machine. I had recently acquired a bread machine and was dying to use it. This recipe was simple, and the bread was simply wonderful! I did modify based on other comments and added an extra 1/2 tsp of salt. Absolutely delicious! Enjoy!

I've had my bread machine for over a year, using only the recipes that came with the machine.  Decided to give this one a try.  ABSOLUTELY the BEST loaves out of my bread machine.  I have made numerous times..using a couple alterations after reading other reviews.....more sugar 3 T (have also used honey) and a bit more salt (1 1/2 t) and I use 2 C bread flour, 1 C whole wheat.  I use the basic setting on the bread machine, light crust setting  This is my Go To recipe for every day bread...I make one or two loaves a week for my hubby & I.  You won't be disappointed.

I have made this bread 7 times already, it is the go to recipe we need for the daily bread we are making lately. The first time used recipe followed exactly. Based on another reviewer who said she puts in 1 1/2 teaspoon of salt into ingredients, I did with even better results (of larger expansion of final product). Thank you for sharing, much appreciated.

Tried this recipe to the letter, thanks for the format of placing wet ingredients first. After experimenting with different flour and yeast.  King Arthur Bread flour and Hodgson Mill active dry yeast packet  gave me the best rise and much better tasting loaf. I also used 4 tablespoons of canola oil and placed the 1-1/2 teaspoon of salt last on top of the flour.

This recipe was AMAZING! It was my first attempt at using a Bread Machine. Even though I tend to tweak recipes to my liking, I left this one as is to see how it worked out. The bread was perfect! DONT SUBSTITUTE A THING!! :)  It's beyond perfect!

Great recipe! I set my machine on the dough setting, then took it out to cook in the oven after (in an 8x4 pan at 375 F for about 30 min). Turned out really yummy, will make great sandwich bread.

Well made this bread yesterday, and only have one small piece left. So guess what I'm doing right now? Yup, making another loaf, to take to work for the week, hope it last that long.
Yesterday while I was making it, I messed up on the amount of flour, but the bread was perfect, so I guess if you make a mistake just go ahead and see what happens! This is a keeper for me :)

So... I thought this recipe was disgusting. Mind you, my ingredients were sparse so I've been making the peasant bread recipe on allrecipes and loved it - but when I got oil, I wanted to try another recipe and tried this one. The flavor was very 'blah'. The texture was okay and it rose well enough. However, the bread also fell apart the moment I cut it. The peasant bread didn't do that. This recipe was just...a letdown, all around.

The BEST one out here!! Used the dough setting on the bread machine, rolled it out into an oiled bowl & let it rise/double. Punched it down & folded it over itself several times & the placed in loaf pan. After another rise doubling in size we ran a knife down the middle about 1/4 inch and then drizzled honey over the entire top of it. Bread Love!!

Very good when it's straight from the bread machine and still warm but I was a bit disappointed in the bread after it was one day old. I substituted one cup of wheat flour.

I love this bread. Every other recipe I've used, the bread has always been dense, or the crust too hard. The only thing is that it fell during the last 30  minutes, but I will try some of the suggestions of more salt, or less oil, etc and see how it comes out. But the bread is soft and the crust is nice and "crusty."  Even if it keeps falling that little bit in the middle, I am going to keep using this recipe. It is that good.

This bread came out awesome! Made it with honey instead of sugar and used olive oil for the vegetable oil.  It was delicious!! Will definitely make it again. The directions of letting the yeast sit in the warm water for 10 minutes was perfect!

Like a lot of other reviewers I, too, was very hesitant about leaving the yeast in the water & sugar for 10 minutes but I did as instructed and I have to say, this is the BEST recipe for basic white bread I've ever used!! Better even than the recipe that came with my machine. I'm making my 3rd loaf in 4 days as I write this review. My family LOVES this bread! I am taking the advice of a reviewer and added an extra 1/2 tsp of salt as I've had problems with the loaf falling so we'll see how that goes, but overall I would recommend this recipe to anyone who wants a great tasting loaf of basic white bread. Thank you for sharing!!

This is the MOST VERSATILE bread recipe I've encountered! I make this loaf in the BREAD MAKER but bake it in the oven. I add wet ingredients then dry then yeast on top and this recipe has never failed me! Differences in the recipe from above are a slight increase in yeast, added 0.33c RAW pumpkin seeds, 0.25c RAW sunflower seeds and 2 tbsp sesame seeds to the mixture.  For the flour I use the Multigrain Bread Flour Mix from Robin Hood (2 cups), and 1 cup of organic whole wheat flour, and increased the water to 1.25c.  Lastly, I mixed the dough  only on the dough cycle, remove the dough at the end of the cycle, and baked at 350 for 60min.  One more thing, before putting the dough in the oven to bake, I pressed the top of the loaf into parchment with sesame seeds and rolled oats on it, flipped it over and set it in the pan to bake.  Enjoy!

This was GOOD. I added the extra 1/2 tsp of salt as one of the comments suggested. Was the crust supposed to be so tough though? It definitely was beyond "flaky" and actually more like french bread, not that that's a bad thing!

This recipe was very dry and tasteless.  I'll return to my old, tried and true recipe next time.  I was very disappointed in this loaf.

Well I added the extra salt and my bread collapsed as soon as it started cooking but I'm sure I made an error somewhere!  I can't wait to get this right.  Next time I also want to cook it in the oven not bread machine.

I love this bread machine recipe!!!  The only problem is that it falls when it bakes.  To fix this, I added a little less than a cup of water (perhaps a tablespoon or two).  I also cut down on the oil a little bit.  Came out perfectly after those changes!

Totally went agains all that I know about making bread in my machine but rolled the dice on this and I have to say... I am quite the believer now. The bread turned out amazingly this will soon become a staple in the house. I may even experiment with this yeast first thing and try it in a recipe I have been having problems with... Thanks for the recipe!

really love this recipe. I turn my machine off after the second kneading, and let it rest until it gets to where I feel it's 'high' enough...then I put it on 'bake' for 50 minutes...it's perfect, you can slice thinner slices!! Very basic and tasty!!! THANK YOU!
(very FEW crumbs too!!!) By the way, I used Canola oil and have not had one problem whatsoever. (I just read the warning posted by someone else that says to NOT use Canola oil...I disagree with a smile)

I make this bread a couple times a week, get HUGE loaves, with no problems falling. Best bread recipe I have found for my daughter and I.  The only modification to this recipe I made was using AP Flour.  It works great and tastes even better.

This turned out perfect!  Couldn't believe how easy this was!  I used this as a base and put 1 cup raisins, 2extra tablespoons of sugar, and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon for a wonderful cinnamon raisin bread!  Just wait to add the raisins til the 'add in' beep happens towards the end of the 2nd kneading. Just made 4 of them for Christmas presents for work colleagues.

So i just kinda riffed off this.  used hot tap water.  doubled the salt.  Used olive oil.  added the sugar.  added 2 teaspoons of yeast with the second slightly rounded.  added tablespoon and a half of dried rosemary.  generous pinch of thyme.  3 cups all purpose flour.  and then drizzled wild blossom honey stitching over top.  set my machine for white bread, 1.5 loaf, light crust.  let it run 5 minutes, restart it.  i open the machine for about 2 minutes while it was rising.  then right before its done cooking i gave it a butter glaze.   i must say, this is some of the most delicious bread i've ever had.  its like eating a chicken roast or enjoying some savory cake.  my loaf rose very well and i have the desired 'love handles' up top as well as a perfect juicy, fluffy, chewy center and a crispy buttery crust.  this bread also slices perfect for toast and sandwiches!  so apparently this is a solid enough recipe to mess around and still come out on top!

I made this one exactly by the recipe (for "vegetable oil" I used melted coconut oil) and it turned out perfect and fluffy, not one of those dense bricks I had been making! I was on the verge of selling my bread machine but now I will be playing with this recipe. Who knew that doing the opposite of the manual's instructions would be the key!

So Good! I cooked mine on medium crust the first time and found that my bread had a half inch thick crust. After cooking it on light crust, however, it was perfect!

This recipe turned out great.  I've made it twice now.  I'm new to the bread machines and this is the first recipe I've found that came out good! I added a little bit extra salt (1/4 tsp more), but other than that just followed the simple recipe.  It's delish!

WOW! I finally found a great bread recipe that comes out perfect in my bread machine. My bread machine had been collecting dust for years and I finally tried to give it another shot. I just followed the directions and voila! The bread came out beautifully. My picky husband loved it. I will keep this recipe forever. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Simple and fool proof!  I have an old pie safe that I put the bread in.  Kept it soft and moist.  I also took a stick of butter and rubbed the outside of the bread when it came out of the oven - this may have helped too!  Very easy to slice and use for sandwiches.

I have been looking for a bread recipe for my bread machine that gave me a lighter/not so dense bread. I finally found it. Like some others I was a bit surprised about mixing the yeast with water instead of adding it on the top of the flour because of the recommendations from the instructions in the bread machine, but I tried it anyways and loved the result. The first loaf disappeared so fast I hardly had time to try it, but the kids all gave me the thumbs up.A big favorite now :)

Been trying different variations with flour. I did 1 cup whole wheat with 2 cups white; I tried white flour mixed with millet flour. I will try making other whole grain breads. I love the overall ease and simplicity of this recipe.

The loaf of bread looked beautiful and had a nice flaky crust but when I took a first bite it tasted sour. I followed the directions perfectly, and just opened up a new bottle of yeast.

This is my go-to bread machine recipe, one which I have used for years.  I often substitute other flours for 1-2 cups bread (I use unbleached white) flour, which have included spelt, amaranth, barley, whole wheat, or a bit (a 1/2 cup or less) of almond flour.  When using substitutes other than the almond flour I'll also add an extra tablespoon of water, and I've recently been adding a teaspoon or two of malted barley flour for enhanced heft and height (though it's just fine without as well).  I have also at times added about 1/2 cup of whole grain teff in addition to the 3 cups flour for a nice grainy texture.  Great basic recipe!

Have made this bread four weeks in a row, once a week in my Zojirushi Bread Machine on the Medium Crust Setting.  Perfect every time!  I followed the advice of others and increased the salt by a 1/4 of a tsp.  I used straight Canola Oil and it worked fine - don;t know why others have had trouble...old oil maybe?  I also started subbing in Agave in lieu of White Sugar...totally worked fine as well.  
Finally a bread that I can make with Organic Bread Flour and other Organic Ingredients that I don't have to worry about - no more failed bread and ruined expensive ingredients!

Delicious and easy! Added an extra 1/2 T of salt, as others suggested. I used extra virgin olive oil as the vegetable oil. Light flavor and sliced easily. Looks like I may need to bake one a day!  Thank you.

I just try this recipe today. It came out very very good. The bread is very soft.  I add 3 Tables of sugar instead of 2 tablespoons. I add some raisin close to the end of kneading cycle. My son suggest me to add cinnamon next time which I think it is a good idea. I only added 1t spoon  salt and the bread did not collapse so I will stick with the recipe for healthy reason. I use grape seeds oil instead of vegetable oil.

This is amazing bread! I add whole wheat bread flour and white bread flour. I have also substituted the sugar for honey and brown sugar, and added wheat germ to some loaves they have came out great every time! The only suggestion I have is that you do not use any other oil then Vegetable or Canola. We don't buy bread in the stores anymore!

Really lovely and springy bread, and very fast to throw together! Olive oil and coconut (the non-smelly/ de-flavored) oils work fine in this, but butter is the best. Vegetable oil is just gross in general, so I substitute for one of the real oils as the mood strikes.

Very easy basic bread recipe.  Mine came out a little drier than I would have liked but that could just be my machine.  Still much better than store bought!  Thanks for sharing, SHECOOKS2!

yum yum, delicious
Next time I will bake them as rolls, as the bread was too soft for cutting.  All I had was canola oil, so I opted for 1/4 cup of melted margarine. The bread turned out perfect and was eaten all up with the Beef Stew I made for Dinner.

Best bread to ever come out of my bread machine! Following this recipe to the letter I get good tasting white bread that rises beautifully, and needs no adjustments. 

If you have a breadmaker this recipe is a must.

Excellent bread and directions. This will be my "go to" recipe.  My machine is an old DAK and this worked just fine.  The texture is great for toasting and slicing thin to cut our carb intake!  Thanks!

OMgosh this was the best bread I have ever made!! I don't think I will ever be able to eat bagged bread again. The best part about it is you get it hot or I just sliced it and put it in a bread bag I had. Awesome breakfast!!! I followed the instructions to a T. I will be making this again!!

This is a great bread machine recipe. The 2nd time I made it, it was flat and dry. Why, because I used RAPID RISE YEAST. the 2nd time I used ACTIVE YEAST, RECIPE WITHOUT REALIZING IT. SO CHECK TO SEE YOU HAVE ACTIVE YEAST. YOU WILL HAVE TOO PUT 1 CUP 110 DEGREES, ADD YEAST, ADD SUGAR, AND LEAVE ALONE FOR 10 MIN. Just thought I would pass this along to people, like me, who use a bread machine. Happy Baking!

What a great and fantastic recipe and it was the second time I made bread in a machine. The first told me to do the total opposite with the yeast. Now I know that sometimes, it's ok to break the rules.. for cooking anyway!!!

I love this bread.  I substituted amaranth flour for 2/3 cup of the flour.  I used the dough setting andi braided the dough, eggwashed it and sprinkled with sesame seeds before baking it.  Yummmmmmmmm.

I bought a bread machine for $4 dollars at a garage sale since my mother wont give up the one she doesnt use.. anyway it had no directions or anything. So I tried to find some thing super easy that would also turn out good. This is just good basic bread. And my four dollar  bread machine worked!!! Tasty and Easy!

I substituted veg oil with extra virgin olive oil.  Bread was wonderful!!!  I am making my third loaf in a week!  Only need 1 slice for a sandwich for lunch, that makes a big 1/2 sandwich, which is plenty! My husband didn't even notice that I used olive oil.

Awesome! I followed the instructions to increase the salt to 1 1/2 tsp and it came out perfect. I also used 2 cups of all purpose flour and 1 cup of whole wheat flour. I have never had a loaf of bread rise all the way to the top of my machine before this one, and it just made a perfect light a fluffy loaf.

Fantastic. You do need fresh yeast and may have to set the machine differently if you are using wheat or other types of flour. I will be using this as my base for all sorts of bread. Real easy to make. May take a couple of times to get it right but it is real good stuff.

This is an awesome recipe! The only change I make is adding a little more salt, as for every 2 1/4 tsp of bread yeast you should add 1 1/2 tsp salt. Other than that I make NO changes what-so-ever and EVERYONE loves it! =)

This is the best bread. It's called proofing the yeast and this is how my mom nmade homemade bread, lot easier in the maching, then I take the dough our, put in pans, let rise and bake, I have made 2 smaller loaves in a smaller loaf pan. Very good. Haven't changed the recipe at all.

Every time I've made this, it has come out exceptionally well.  Better than hand-made bread, better than store bought.  One slice, cut in half makes a very filling sandwich!

Excellent bread...I did do a few changes to this recipe. Since I have a warmer on my bread machine it did not like me doing the yeast first like the recipe calls for so I did it with the yeast last. I also made a few other changes and just customized to my families taste.

I wanted a dairy free recipe due to lactose intolerance.  This recipe is perfect! I used 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour in place of white flour.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I added a pinch extra of sugar, salt, and yeast to compensate for the heaviness of the wheat flour.  The bread came out fluffy inside with a flaky crust using the 1.5 lb/med crust setting on the bread machine.  I'm saving this recipe to make again!  Next time I'll try using more wheat flour and honey instead of white sugar.

I recently got my bread machine out of the moth balls (yikes!), and have been using recipes that came out of the owner's manual, a box mixes are just too expensive now. Well, needless to say, I've been less than thrilled with the recipes. They dry out so fast that the remaining loaf could soak up the entire Arkansas River!
I tried this just as the recipes stated for the first loaf, and I am sold! I have never, ever had a loaf of bread come out as well as store quality (the premium bread), but this did!
I made my second loaf, tweaked with some other reviewer's helpful hints, and tried cutting back on the yeast a bit, as the first loaf doubled as it was cooking! Monster loaf of bread! lol
The second also rose up more in the oven, but I divided the dough and made a little mini-loaf, and I will divide further next time, as it's still a little to big. I cannot wait to taste this one, as I cut back flour to 21/2 cups and added the 1/2 cup of wheat flour.
I have also never made bread that called for letting the yeast set in water for 10 minutes to foam up - but I wish I had known this trick years ago, as it would also let you know if you killed your yeast without wasting all the other ingredients as well! All I can say is, you learn something new everyday.
I made the first loaf 3 days ago, and at the very end of it, it was just starting to turn dry, so I am going to share this recipe with my daughter. Plus, no eggs/milk, cheaper to make!
No way to go wrong, so it's a win win!

Very happy with the results.  I did increase the salt to 1 1/2 tsp, that was the only change. Great rise, good flavor and texture.  Will make it again soon!

I made this by hand as I don't have a bread machine and it rose very well and was nice and soft. It was almost completely tasteless though, perhaps 1-1/2 tsp. of salt would make it better?

Outstanding! Just like my mom's! Of course I improvised a bit:
A: Reduced yeast by 3/4tsp
B: 1c vital gluten and 2c all purpose flower
This made for a great rise, great crumb and no yeasty flavor!

Thanks SHEEKOOKS2 for an outstanding bread machine recipe. my whole family LOVES it!

This is an amazing recipe! Not only is it super easy, but it's so yummy! I made a few changes from the suggestions of others. I swapped out the sugar for the same amount of honey and replaced the vegetable oil with olive oil. Then I replaced a half cup of the bread flour with whole wheat flour. It turned out so light and fluffy! This is not the normal dense bread machine bread recipe!

The BEST white bread my bread machine ever made! I do mine on the dough cycle, then let rise in a loaf pan and bake at 350° for 25 mins. We just like a more traditional size loaf. I never buy bread from the store any more!

OMG....made bread for the first time this morning.....as per other reviews..added extra 1/2 tsp of salt so the loaf would rise nicely and hold together better. Loaf turned out soooo good.  I have now become a bread baker .Can't wait to try other bread recipes.

This bread is fantastic! Yes, it goes against everything your breadmachine manual tells you, but you can't argue with the results. On the advise of other reviewers, I did increase the salt to 1 1/4 tsp, and also exchanged some of the white flour for wholewheat. It's absolutely delicious, and more importantly, my kids love it too!!!

So far this is the best white bread I've made in my bread machine!  So soft...  I find the recipes that came with my machine make very dry bread that seems stale immediately and would hurt my mouth.  Not so with this recipe!  Soft and delicious.

Don't know what I did wrong but my bread was really small. Maybe about a quarter high of my Container in my Bread Machine.
Since we over 4000ft added  extra salt, which was 1/2 tsp. more.

Any suggestions? The taste is good, but wished that the Bread itself was bigger.

This is a very good white bread made in a bread machine. I added 1/2 tsp more salt as someone suggested and my loaf rose beautifully. The bread is soft, but more dense than the sandwich loaves you buy in the store.

Tried this recipe for the first time. The only changes I've made is I'm using 1.5 tsp of salt instead of only 1 tsp of it. And the bread came out perfect, soft & fluffy! :)

The BEST bread machine bread is right! I have made this 20+ times and it always turns out just right. I do add the extra salt making it 1.5 tsp. The crust is crunchy and the inside soft and tasty! And as an added bonus it make out of this world french toast for the next morning!

Oh my gosh!!  This is fantastic.  Light and fluffy.  Oh so tender.  All these years years of bread machine use and who knew to put the yeast in first.  Better than any other loaf I made even the ones I usually make on dough cycle and bake in the oven.  I am so looking forward to adding all the wonderful ideas from other viewers.  Thank you this is a keeper.

This was very good.  Crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  The only change I made was that I used 1 1/2 tsp of salt after reading other reviews.

Absolutely amazing!  Incredibly light and airy.  Melts in your mouth!  

Even tried it with 1/3 whole wheat flour, still light an airy and very delicious.  Going to try 2/3 whole wheat flour and see what happens.

This is the ONLY bread machine recipe I've made thus far (7 attempts)  that has WORKED.  THANK YOU!!!!!   Ignore your machine's instructions which tell you (at least mine does) to add liquids then dry ingredients.  That does not work.  Add the yeast to the water/sugar mixture first and you will have a beautiful loaf.

This recipe is exceptional and now my absolute go-to.  I started by making it as described, and enjoyed the chewy loaf that made perfect sandwich bread with a really lovely crispy crust.   From there, I've used the basic outline of it, and had great success with modifications...

The same loaf made with 100% whole wheat bread flour turned out great.  Another time when I only had all-purpose white flour (not bread flour) I used that with the addition of a little bit of lemon juice, and it rose up beautifully and was soft and chewy.   I've added heaps of seeds and raisins and dates and nuts, with no problem rising.  I have a machine whose pan is a little squatter and wider than many, which I believe makes a better loaf.  That said, I am a complete convert to foaming the yeast first (like you do when you make bread by hand) rather than keeping the ingredients separate like typical instructions tell you for bread machines.  I haven't used another bread machine recipe since finding this one!

Great base recipe.  Tweaked it just a little.  1-1/2 cups each of King Arthur whole wheat white flour and white flour.  Added an extra 1/2 tsp of salt.  Use my bread machine to prepare the dough.  After the end of the cycle, put the dough into a greased loaf pan, cover it and leave it to rise for about 30 mins.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Bake for 25 mins until the top is nicely browned.  I can't keep it in the house.  My husband cuts into it before it's even partially cooled and will polish off 1/2 loaf in an hour.  This is such an easy recipe, I have no problem baking several batches a week.  So much better than store-bought.

Wow. I made my first bread using this recipe - Hecker's All Purpose flour. Instead of using sugar, I used honey and instead of v. oil, I used melted butter.  The result is a bread that taste naturally sweet with a tinge of buttery!  Also my butter was salted so 1 tsp of salt is enough - i added 1.25 tsp because i read that it will hold up better but the bread did taste a tad of salt.  Held up so perfectly (no collapsing) and while light and fluffy, it was so sturdy and great for sandwiches. In fact, it was so good I have been noshing on it on its own. KEEPER!

First time trier:  Good Stuff, being located in the Panhandle of Texas, I had to add a tablespoon of water during the first mixing cycle. But after making six loaves today, I will begin experimenting tomorrow.  Need something to ramp up the aroma though, it's good but not as strong as I remember momma's being.

This is a great, simple white bread recipe for the bread machine. I did take the advice of another reviewer and added the extra half a teaspoon of salt to the recipe. It turned out perfectly. I loved letting the yeast dissolve and activate at the start. There's nothing like that smell to let you know you'll have fresh bread in a few hours.

This is only the second bread recipe I've tried in my new bread maker, and it far outshines the first one, which came with the bread maker. The bread was very soft and the crust was flaky. I used the basic bread setting with a light crust. It's embarrassing to admit, but my husband and I ate a little less than half the loaf as butter bread shortly after it came out :)

This recipe is REALLY good!  I started out making the original recipe exactly and I was pretty impressed.  My husband mentioned that it was a bit crumbly so in my next batch, I used 1/2 c. oil and 1/2 tablespoon of salt.  It came out even BETTER!!!!   Love this recipe!

This is by far the best bread machine recipe that I have used yet! The recipe is great as is but I like to use olive oil and sometimes I like to substitute honey for the sugar. This is now a staple in my household. Even my picky husband likes this bread!

Awesome!  Got rave reviews from my guests - good flavor, texture and appearance.  I brushed alittle butter on after it came out of the machine and sliced it after it cooled.  It sliced easily.  I didn't intentionally substitute, but i used olive oil instead of a standard vegetable oil. Delicious!  Great starter bread machine recipe.

A tip for anybody baking bread, get good quality bread flour and measure it by weight as it tends to settle. I use King Arthur bread flour and measure 4.25 oz per cup - this recipe has turned out perfect everytime.

I've had my bread machine for a year now, and have tried a couple recipes. This is the FIRST time I've ever enjoyed eating the bread I made. This is the bread I remember eating at my grandmothers when I was little. I made 3 loaves today just to share with family.

My sister had given me her bread machine, and this was the first recipe I tried. It turned out fantastic! My family loved it. A perfect, warm treat, smeared with butter. I'll be making this one many more times!

I've tried this recipe twice and both times it rose nicely & looked great, but then fell at about 50 mins. to go in the process.
After reading the other reviews, I added more salt but it still fell.....quite disappointing! 
The bread itself is good.... it's a good recipe except for it falling and making the top not so great!!
Any other suggestions besides adding more (unwanted) salt to the recipe?
Thanks!

HELP! Am I missing something???? There is not enough liquid to make dough. I tried this recipe as written but it was too dry. I had to add liquid in order to make it into bread.

I gave this a 5 star. It is just the easiest and most delicious bread. I didn't have any bread flour so I just all purpose. It may not have rose to It's full potential, but it was still amazing!!!!

I followed the recipe exactly and couldn't rate this is the "best" I'd ever had.  I've made other breads in my bread machine before that were a lot better. Sigh.  I was so looking forward to having a wonderful recipe, too!

Some breadmachines ask you to keep salt and yeast in recipes separate if you use the time delay feature, otherwise it's not a problem.

I followed the directions exactly and ran into a few problems.
1. Loaf collapsed. I do see that others recommend adding more salt to remedy this, however.
2. The loaf stuck to the sides of my bread machine tin and I'm not sure why. I've never had a loaf stick before so this baffled me. I had to pretty much hack at it to get it out.

The chunks of it I ate were pretty good, however. I am wondering if the problems are because my bread machine is a bit larger than others?
I will try it again but add the extra salt and see what happens! :)

All in all it is a very quick, easy, and good bread to make!

I made this bread yesterday according to the recipe and it really did seem logical to me to add the yeast to the water.  Toward the end of the cycle, I watched the dough rise nicely.  Then after 15 minutes I checked it again, and the dough collapsed just before the bake cycle.  But I thought well there’s nothing more I could do about it and I just let the machine run its course.  I took the bread out of the pan turned it upside down on a rack.  I was surprised to see the crust was beautifully browned and when I cut into it, it had a wonderful texture.  Well needless to say we had the bread for supper.  It was excellent!  The next time I will add a little more salt like so many reviewers suggested.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Did not work for me. Bread was heavy. Am baking a new loaf now using the same 'traditional' method by making a well in the flour and placing the yeast in the well. The loaf is proofing beautifully. No idea why it worked for most but not mine...

I made this while sleeping last night!  woke up to the great smell of fresh baked bread throughout my whole home!  Yum!

I was scared, like some other reviewers reported to be as well, in adding yeast to water.  My machine states to add it to the flour mixture last, not touching water.  But i liked the comment that was posted " what did I have to lose" so I tried it....without fail!!!

My bread for the first time in a LONG TIME turned out so perfect.  it rose so big.  the only change i made 9 not bc I wanted to but bc that is all I had in the house) was i added EVO instead of veg oil.  I also used 1 1/2 white and 1 1/2 whole wheat flour.

this is a KEEPER!!! Thanks for sharing

I just made this bread last night and it came out so fantastic! Very soft and light. It rose just fine (I used about 1/4 more salt than the recipe called for). I think I want to use this as the basis for other breads I make (I'm new to the bread machine). I cant wait to try this out in whole wheat or rye!

I made this without a machine and it was only the second loaf of bread I had ever made. It surpassed my expectations and it is a wonderful "basic" bread. I feel like I'll never buy bread at the store ever again.

This is the easiest bread that I have ever made with my bread machine!  It comes out perfect every time and I even tried tweaking the recipe a little to see if I could improve but to no avail! However, don't try this with whole wheat flour or else it will come out kind of dense.. maybe reduce the amount of flour, but then again, I'm no cook!

I love this bread!  We make a loaf of this bread every week for our sandwiches.  I either make it exactly as the recipe states or I will add 1 1/2 tblsps more sugar, depending on if it's a pb&j week or a turkey and ham.  Both ways will come out soft and delicious.  Super easy, great taste!  Thank you for the recipe!

This is the best bread I made in my machine to date! It truly came out light and fluffy! My daughter thought it might have needed a little more sugar and I was thinking maybe a touch more salt. However it turned out great (not heavy and dense like my other recipes) so I give it 5 stars for that!

Has quickly became my #1 sandwich loaf.How could something so good be so easy. I slightly tweeked it by adding 3-4T's of powdered milk. I also find it works best if you portion your dry ingredients by weight instead of volume.
 go metric!!!

This was so delicious. I added an extra tbsp of sugar and upped the salt to 1.5 tsp. But it was so easy to make and was good. Better than store bought. This will definitely be in heavy rotation at my house.

My first try at home made bread and using plain all purpose flour. This works every time now in my bread maker, and makes some fantastic toasted cheese sandwiches. I don't need to measure precisely and it makes this recipe rather simple. Once, I added cinnamon and ground cloves for a change, and while baking,, mmm it made the house smell so good.

Very nice bread!  I did add another teaspoon of salt as per other reviews.  Prepping the yeast first worked amazingly well.  Thanks.

It's great!  My machine was out of order until I got around to buying a new part and this is the first loaf I have made in about 9 months.  This bread is light and good.

its fluffy enough except...
- taste is not great. the yeast smell is overpowering from prep to bake time. 
- you cant use express settings (it says 3hours to make so i did the regular 3 hours)
- the top collapsed, but did not affect the inside fluffiness. the underside had moisture when i removed from pan, and at first slice, parts were slightly damp. the sides are still burnt despite Light setting.

overall, its okay, but not the best I've done. id watch out for the tweaks that other people have done.

I have made this bread a number of times. It taste alright, but just not what I feel homemade bread should be like. I can't understand why mine comes out so "Bumpy". I'm trying another recipe to see if it's just the machine.

This recipe worked great.  My bread machine came out of several years of storage when I saw this recipe.  I could never get it to work right before.  But this recipe worked perfectly.  Great taste and texture and crust came out perfect.  I used a 50/50 blend of all purpose and whole wheat flour.  I did not have veg oil so used olive oil instead.  This will be a regular recipe for the machine.  Thanks!

I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil to make it healthier, used active dry yeast (b/c that's what I had) and also followed the directions of a previous reviewer to keep the loaf from rising and then collapsing.  Bread came out nice and fluffy instead of the thick and heavy loaf that my machine's cook book came with.

Everyone raves about this bread when I make it. I use a bread machine so this is super easy. I substitute about 1/2 cup of wheat flour and the bread always turns out great and the flavor is wonderful.

This bread was soooo delicious. I was a little apprehensive b/c this was my first bread making experience, I didn't have all the right ingredients, and because a few ppl said the bread was horrible. But I took a chance and I am glad I did. Firstly I didn't have bread machine yeast so I substituted w reg dry active yeast. Secondly I didn't have bread flour so I used 2 cups off all purpose and then threw in a cup of self rising for good measure. Third, although I did have vegetable oil I always substitute butter for oil. Well the bread was so awesome. It was so light and fluffy. I will definitely make it again and I will try different variations for different flavors. I will also make it as the recipe calls I just didn't happen to have all of those ingredients. A+

Fantastic recipe!  I tried two recipes that came with my bread machine, and they were horrible.  I made no changes to this recipe.  The top fell ever so slightly - not a big deal.  Crispy crust, tender inside, light/yeasty flavor.  It's wonderful.  This is a great recipe!

Holy YUM!  I made this with the exact recipe ingredients.  The only think I did differently was mix the warm water and sugar and yeast in a bowl first, stirring occasionally during the ten minutes.  I guess I just tend to hover a little ;).  Anyway, the bread smelled FANTASTIC cooking an the taste does not disappoint.  Very crunchy crust, perfectly moist and light inside, just a touch sweet which I adore.  I'll make this bread A LOT.

Who's kidding who here?  This was a flop in terms of texture, taste, you name it.  I proofed my yeast first to be sure of it, then followed instructions to the letter.  My bread machine flour was only a month old and has been kept airtight.  All ingredients other than the water were at room temperature.  My machine has not been used much so this can't be the reason.  This is very strange - - any ideas from anyone would be appreciated to help solve this mystery!

Well - I just don't know what I did wrong.  I read through the comments, and changed the following things (used 2t yeast in a jar), used 1/2c whole wheat flour + 2.5c bread flour, used 1/4c olive oil (rather than veg oil).  The bread came out very condensed and "bumpy" looking.  :-( Such rave reviews, so I was very disappointed.  It's not because my bread machine is older is it?  HELP.

The BEST bread maker recipe ever! Easy to make, super consistent results!  Like others, I added 1/2 t extra salt, replaced 1/2 c flour with whole wheat, and substituted olive oil.  Good for sandwiches and just eating still warm with some butter!

WOW!  Finally a bread recipe that works, haha!  After receivingmy new Kenmore bread maker for Christmas, I tried out the recipe provided in the manual- the bread turned out to be a HUGE mass of weird, crumbly mess.  This recipe's ratios sounded better, the dough looked better (tacky to the touch).  Don't be afraid to let the yeast proof w/ the water/sugar b4 adding dry ingredients.  I used evoo instead of veg oil and 2 tsp salt both added great flavor.  I will save this recipe!

This bread is amazing. I just purchased a bread machine for christmas (West Bend), and the recipes in the booklet that came with it are just so-so. When I read all the reviews, I thought I'd give this a try. The only change I made is that I used butter instead of oil. The crust came out beautifully crispy, the interior was light and fluffy, and a very nice, mild flavor to it. I was really amazed at how much the bread rose - it was bigger and fluffier than all the other breads I made so far, and it used less flour!  I guess I found my white bread recipe, now it's on to the next quest: finding the perfect whole wheat bread recipe for my bread machine.

This is perhaps one of the best, basic white bread recipes around.  Just the right amount of salt and sugar, great consistency, and very tasty.  Comes our perfectly every time.

The best bread machine recipe I've ever used. This made a beautiful loaf of bread that smells wonderful. I'm going to slice a piece right now. Yummy!

Made this recipe plus 1/2 tsp more salt as suggested.  It was delicious, but I'm still searching for something out of this world.

This was great!  My loaf just finished and I'm onto making another everyone liked it so much!  Mixing the yeast with the water is not a normal part of baking bread in a machine, but it worked perfectly.

Turned out great!  First time using this bread machine, or any for that matter, and I'm not a baker...  I followed the instructions explicitly, and chose to use unbleached white flour, organic sugar, kosher salt, canola oil, and regular fast acting yeast, all from my local Henry's here in So Cal...  The top sank a little, but I'm not sure what it's supposed to look like, so I think it was okay.  The crust was light brown and lightly crunchy, and the bread had a nice consistency.  It made awesome toast this morning!  Next time I may experiment with the ingredients just as others here do, but the basic recipe is so good and simple, you can't go wrong!  BTW, I used a DAK Turbo V baker my neighbor gave me years ago, and it did an incredible job... Total time was 3.5 hours on normal, not turbo...

My very first recipe w/ my new bread machine.. Super yummy!  As others suggested, I added a touch more salt, and replaced the vegetable oil w/ extra virgin olive oil.  I did not have bread flour, but used the exact equivalent (3c) of all purpose.  Definitely will make again!

The first time I made this, I used the "fast bake" setting on my machine, bcz the manual said to use that setting if I use rapid rise yeast (bread machine yeast). The first time it came out very heavy. I followed the directions this time &used the normal rise and bake setting, except for using olive oil and an extra 1/2 tsp salt. It came out beautiful! So light and fluffy..great with butter and honey. A little too fluffy/crumbly for sandwiches, but regardless, this bread is so tasty for it being such a simple recipe-and the aroma while baking made everyone hungry! It was gone in a day.

So apparently I am incapable of making bread! I have tried this recipe and others and they always turn out dense and/or don't rise. Is there something I am missing. I have tried different yeast, the break machine and regular yeast and still no change..! I use to make bread with my grandmother and it seemed so simple, but i have this fancy cuisinart thing and don't understand what I am doing.

This was officially my first ever homemade bread. haha.  I chose this recipe because it seemed fairly simple and a good intro to my new bread machine.  It was very easy and pretty good!  I would like to experiement with using more whole wheat and honey in place of the bread flour and sugar.

This bread is AWESOME!!  Have had my bread machine for many years.  Never have I made bread that the crust wasn't tough and even tougher the next day.  This bread was the exact OPPOSITE!!  Crust is tender and flaky and equally as wonderful the next day!!  Definitely a keeper!!!  After reading the reviews, I did increase the salt to 1 1/2 tsp.  I am actually going to make another loaf today!!

I found absolutely NOTHING to complain about, or alter in this recipe. I am always light-handed with salt, but I use natural (unrefined) sea salt, so I am used to cutting salt by about half in all of my recipes. I am ready to pop in another batch as I write this. I think I may add a plop of honey to this batcfh for giggles. Dynamite recipe, thanks so much for sharing!

I assumed that this bread would probably taste bland because it is so simple to make...but I was plesantly surprised.  The texture is light and fluffy and the crust is rich and golden.  Make sure you use yeast made for the bread machine or it doesn't rise.  A wonderful recipe that I will use again and again=:)

We just bought a $10 bread machine off Craigslist and this was our 'test' recipe.  We followed ICEYBLUEROSE's suggestion of increasing the salt to 1-1/2 teaspoon and the loaf was PERFECT!  Wow! It made such an awesome loaf and tasted just like a french baguette!  This recipe is definitely a keeper for our recipe box!

Great results with no effort. My 3 year old son made it. All I did was press the buttons on the bread machine and tell him how much of what to put in it.

I was sooo Leary of this recipe since it asks you to do EVERYTHING the bread machine manual tells you not to...but it turned out awesome.  Honestly, I think I may try this technique with other bread machine recipes (adding the yeast to the water) to see how it turns out. Thank you diggetydog!

I've used my bread maker for 12 years & just found this recipe.  By far the BEST I've ever made! I was amazed with the results & I'm sure it's due to proofing the yeast first-something totally opposite that every other recipe states. YUM!!

This is a very fantastic bread.  I only make a couple changes.  I use olive oil instead of veg. oil and I ad in an extra tablespoon or so of agave syrup.  I also just use the dough cycle and bake the bread at 374 for about 25 mins with a water bath underneath.

Made this for my husband at his request. While I normally like to make my bread in the oven as I find the breadmaker usually gives a really thick and hard crust that I don't care for, I was alone with my 2 babies (both under 2 years) while the hubster was at school. Anyway, he got this fresh out of the machine and said that it was very good and the best bread he's ever had out of a bread machine. He definitely wanted me to keep this in rotation. And as easy as it is, I have no problem with that!!!

This truly is THE BEST EVER! I have been looking for a recipe like this for a long time, just like my mom made it. This bread is light and fluffy. I cooked it for a light crust, which was perfect. The crust is flakey, but not a dry flaky. The flakes literally melt in your mouth as you eat it! I dipped mine in basil pesto.

Easy and foolproof indeed!  Comes out perfect every time.  The only time i messed it up was when i forgot the salt until it was too late to add it.  The bread still turned out good, even though i could taste the difference without the salt.  The lack of salt also affected the rising of the dough.  It didn't rise the same.

I have used this recipe many times, often following the exact recipe, and other times with the following variations:

2-1/2 c. white flour + 1/2 c. whole wheat flour

2 c. white flour + 1 c. whole wheat flour

olive oil instead of vegetable oil

sea salt instead of regular salt

the past few times, i've made it with some less refined, tan-colored, granulated sugar (can't remember what it was called)

i have also used Sucanat (a brand of whole cane sugar)

Great, easy recipe!  I love this bread!!

I'm giving this the highest rating because it's the best loaf of bread that I've made so far.  I've only had my machine for a couple of weeks, and this is only my fourth loaf.  The bread is yummy, especially toasted.  It is light and super crispy on the outside. My only problem is that it did not rise to the heights that others have mentioned.  I followed the recipe to the letter:  bought the bread machine yeast (it foamed up tremendously in the bottom), used bread flour, and increased the salt.  I think that it only rose about 20% from the raw ingredients.  Is this how it is supposed to be?

I went searching for a recipe for basic bread as I've been having trouble with the taste and density of our breadmakers recipe book recipes; Too bland and too dense.    I decided to follow this recipe using the changes that BERMYROSE suggested.  I was happy with the taste (although may be a touch too sweet), but the density come out very thick for me and therefore the bread I have is not able to be used for sandwiches etc.  I will be trying the recipe again, using the original one submitted, as I truly wish to find a recipe that bakes a decent loaf of bread that can be used daily in our home.

Awesome bread recipe.  I made mine without the bread machine yeast (I just had regular yeast) and I used two teaspoons of lite salt (half the sodium) and it was AWESOME!  I also used the quick bake cycle on my bread machine so it was all made within the hour!  Yum.

Fantastic recipe!  I have tried many bread machine recipes and most make really nice bread but somewhat dense.  I enjoy this at times but often my preference is for a light fluffy loaf and until now I have been unable to acheive this.  However this recipe nails it!  The loaf in incredibly light and also has a wonderful taste.  This is going to be my standard bread recipe from now on.

A perfect everyday bread...this will replace my store bought bread.  I increased the salt to 1&1/2 tsp on the advice of other reviewers and baked it on the medium setting.  Perfect for toast and sandwiches!

The bread itself was good, but mine deflated.  At one point when I checked, it looked great, so I think it must have hit the top of the bread machine and fell flat.  I may try reducing the water or just put the ingredients in the order I usually do.

I have made this countless times. I can honestly say I've never had any trouble with it, except the time my bread machine fell off the counter spilling the dough onto the floor. Had to start over. But I bring it to dough stage in the machine and then form 2 smaller loaves that I let rise then bake on a stone. I always get tons of compliments on this bread!! Thanks!

Another review! Admit I was concerned about the method of adding ingredients, but what's to  lose? Absolutely nothing...best white bread my machine ever produced. Plain, with butter...sandwich... toast, makes no difference. Great bread.

We've made this recipe numerous times.  I've taken it to work, - but frankly... it doesn't normally make it to work.  Great bread - we also added a bit more salt.  Love, love the smell of this baking.

I just bought my first bread machine and was looking for a nice simple recipe to try. Just took the bread out and tried a slice and it's wonderful. I'm hopeless at backing and this came out nice and fluffy with a great flavor. Can't wait to try something more complex!

I also added the extra 1/2 tsp of salt but otherwise made it exactly as the instructions say.  This is the absolute BEST loaf of bread I've made in my bread machine.  It's very light and fluffy and has a wonderful homemade bread taste.  I will definitely make this one again!

This makes a wonderful sandwich bread.  However, I have discovered that it makes delicious garlic bread/texas toast.  I cut the slices about an inch thick, soften a stick of butter and add about 1 T of garlic poweder.  Butter both sides of the bread and bake for 5-7 minutes at 425.  Be sure to flip!  It is the highlight of my family's spaghetti night! YUM!!!!

This was awesome in my bread machine. Added a little extra salt.  Should have used light crust setting instead of medium though, crust was a bit too thick for my taste. Boyfriend was super excited the entire 3 hours the bread was rising and baking.  He liked the crust.

Awesome.  First time my bread machine has made a loaf I've enjoyed.  For the longest time I've only used it on the dough setting but gave this recipe a try.  THANK YOU.  My bread machine is now going to start earning its counter space!!

This bread is amazing.  It's just like Mom used to make - light and fluffy.  I've had my bread machine for years and all the recipes I'd tried were too dense.  The machine spent a lot of time in the cabinet because I'd get so frustrated.  Now I'll just keep the machine on the counter because I'll be using it so much it'll be a pain pulling it out of the cabinet all the time.  My 12 year old just cut off a chunk and ate it plain - no butter, no toppings, just bread.    My only problem was that it hit the top of the machine so it didn't form properly.  I'll try another users suggestion and add a little more salt next time.    Thank you thank you thank you diggetydog!

I was skeptical about the way this bread is put together with the yeast but it was the best bread I have ever made yet. Absolutely delicious and looked so wonderful when presented. Thanks DIGGETYDOG

Great Bread. Just the right amount of sugar, salt and oil.  I used kosher salt. I used my bread maker and will definately make again for a great white loaf.

This was not to my liking!! I went EXACTLY by the recipe. Horrible for bread great for bricks. I tried it again and added a little more water and an egg and added the yeast to the flour instead of the way the recipe stated it helped some. It rose that time.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it came out wonderful. Plan to try again substituting some wheat flour next time and may also try throwing a little flax meal in there. I liked learning the different method of using the yeast and may try it with other recipes.

Wow! This just cut 2+ hours off my standard recipe cooking time. Bread came out perfectly. The recipe was also much simpler than my old standby ~ I love it when you can easily throw it together without having to consult your recipe constantly. Plus, now that we are "budgetizing" with great earnest, I can quickly make this bread before work with no sweat. Yeah!

The flavor was delicious, but my crust was soooo crunchy and when I went to cut it, it would all squish together because it's soo soft and fluffy.  Any tips??

Lovely recipe..easy and produces great bread. I changed salt to 1.25 tsp, and sugar to 3 tablespoon, just for taste preferences. Bread rises well either way. KEEPER!

A huge hit at Easter Brunch.  The only change I made was increase salt by 1/2 t.  I did not have bread flour, just all-purpose, and it was still wonderful.  Set machine on 1.5 lbs. size loaf.  Will definitely make again soon.

This kind of the bread recipe is the best I ever tried! Make sure you fallow this directions, and not the bread machine's directions. Ones I used an olive oil for an experiment, and it made the bread taste better, in my opinion. It is very fluffy and light bread, the way my family and I  like it.

This bread is soooo great.   Some reviews mentioned the loaf falling in the middle. We followed the directions to a T and it came out perfect. The dough seems very wet in comparison to other breads we've made and I was half tempted to add some flour... but nothing erks me more than when people change the recipe and then give bad remarks... so I stuck to it and boy was I glad I did.  Well worth the little leg work at the beginning. This is the only bread machine recipe I've used where you buck the system and create a yeast starter rather than following the manufacturers ingredient order. It is incredibly soft and tasty. This will be our staple bread we make and then we'll just have fun on the side.  We live overseas and finding soft bread is always so hard. We actually buy 4-5 loaves at Fuddruckers up in the capital city whenever we travel there (4 hours away) and bring it back home. Thanks Diggetydog for providing my family with soft bread again!

I've made many many loaves of bread in my breadman, but this, by far, is the easiest, best recipe I have EVER come upon. I was skeptical, like many other viewers, but decided to give it a try. I used a pinch more salt and active dry yeast instead of bread machine yeast. I also use high protein flour. It was AMAZING. So light and fluffy. A definite staple in my house, now.

Well, like the others trying this recipe, I was shocked at putting the instant breadmachine yeast, luke warm water and sugar together in the bread pan. But there were so many great comments that I couldn't resist to try it.  I have made this recipe 3 times in the past 3 days. Each time the bread rose a little more than the time before. Each time I used different breadmachine setting, decreased the sugar amount and allowed the yeast to rise longer than 10mins in bread pan. Today, I think that I have perfected it.  I have a 2 lbs Regal KitchenPro Bread machine which is over 15 yrs old(still in great working condition).  Before adding 2 1/2 tsps yeast, I warmed the outside of the bad pan by running hot water over it, meanwhile in a measuring cup I put 1 1/4 cp lukewarm water added 1 1/2 tblsp of sugar until dissolved, then in the warmed bread pan added the bread machine yeast then poured the measuring cup with lukewarm sugar water over it. Once the yeast rose (became bubbly in the pan) I added 1/4cp olive oil, 3cps flour,1 1/2tspn salt, dried herbs 1 tsp & 1-2 tsps flaxseeds.e dough doesn't form a ball & still dry add warm water a tblspn at a time until it forms a ball. I just took baked bread out of the machine and it rose to the top of the 2 lbs pan! ammazing!  I hope this helps others!

Although this recipe goes completely against the manufacturer's instructions for the ingredient order, it has turned out the best of any bread I have tried.  I made it with multi-grain bread flour and it turned out fantastic!  A keeper!

After many attepmts to make a normal size loaf it was finally accomplished! Even after putting the timer for an 8 hour cycle it still turned out perfect! It was so easy we had to double check ourselves! Highly Recommended for those frustrated with manuals and lousy loaves. LOL Now I want to make a heallthier version and then I will be in heaven!

As with most homemade bread, this tastes soooo much better when freshly baked.  The next day it was just alright - nothing so spectacular.  Just good ole plain white bread.  Any leftover bread would be great as french toast or as a dessert in butterscotch bread pudding.

The bread machine instructions say to put the yeast on top of the flour.   I was unsure to do this, tried it and turned out GREAT!!  Used this recipe the other day and turned out better than the box recipe bought at the store.  This recipe cooked to the top of the bread machine.  Using this again today and love it!!!!

This is the BEST recipe I have tried in my bread machine.  Yes, like other reviewers...it is just bread but its very moist, light, and easy.  I also added a little more salt as other reviewers did.  This is a definate keeper.... when my family walked in from school and work, they loved the aroma.  One loaf gone!!

I love this bread.  I did make one adjustment, I added the .5 tsp of salt as the other reveiwers suggested.  The bread rose prefectly and it taste wonderful. Definately a keeper.

OMG!!  This is the best bread recipe.   I decided to make bread today and started out with a box mix and after four hours it did not completely rise, but browned beautifully. So I tossed it and  I decided to use this recipe and follow it exactly and it is great.  My house smells so good. I'm making more in the morning.l

The recipe is perfect as-is except it doesn't work well in my machine.  I use the dough setting, turn it into a bread pan, let it rise and then bake @ 375 for 20 minutes.  Wonderful, light & fluffy bread-shaped bread!  It's also really nice with dried onion and Italian seasoning added - herbed bread that tastes like stuffing.

I was really disappointed in this.  If I had read the reviews carefully, I would have understood that this was designed to be an imitation of store-bought bread, with it's lack of heft and consistency that makes homemade bread so special.  So, it gets 4 stars because it definitely achieves this for those who prefer that style. I will definitely be going back to the more traditional method that gives some chew and texture to the bread.

This makes a nice loaf of bread. I don't buy bread at the store anymore. I use this recipe and make at least 4 loaves of this bread each week. I do as a previous poster recommended and add 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt instead of the 1 teaspoon in the recipe. I use the dough cycle of the bread machine which takes it through the first rise. I knead the dough and let it rise a second time, then brush with egg whites and bake at 375 degree F for 30 minutes. It's perfect every time.

Good, but mine didn't rise like other reviewers'. My loaf was a cute but smallish little thing that didn't rise nearly to the top of the pan. I did stir the sugar and yeast together in the water in the beginning, and maybe that killed some yeast. I'm new to breadmaking, and would try this again based on the reviews. Either way, a mediocre home loaf is a million times better than a store-bought loaf!

Well, this was a good bread. Typical bread machine bread though, just with a little extra fuss. No better than the recipe I have. In fact, I followed it to a t ( I don't like to alter, then post everything I have done, since then it's no longer the same recipe) and it didn't rise as well as my usual recipe. I am certain it was the salt, or lack there of.  Not worth all the raving, not bad, but nothing special.

I have made this recipe twice. Once, exactly the way it was written for making pepperoni rolls. They were SO tender! Then the 2nd time, with 1/2 whole wheat 1/2 white, and made into large hamburger buns. Fantastic! My new favorite bread recipe!

After making this recipe four times, I increased the salt to 2 teas instead of 1 teas.  Now it's perfect.  The bread always comes out beautifully, but the first four times we found it to be a little bland tasting.  Increasing the salt solved the problem. This is a very good recipe and it's pretty much foolproof! I make it every week.

This is great bread! I do add a 1/2 tbl more sugar and 1/2 teaspoon more salt but its great without that extra flavor too. Very fluffy. Tried the amish bread on this site and it didnt compare at all! Like others, I wasnt sure about adding yeast to the water but it was PERFECT!

The absolute best white bread recipe for a bread machine I've found during the 6 years I've owned a bread machine.  Perfect crust, texture and flavor.  My change:  1/2 extra salt for the basic white recipe.  I've also used flavored oils, olive oil, added flax seed, added a cup of wheat flour in place of a cup of white flour, and cut back the salt and added honey.  All have been outstanding.  Great basic recipe!  Thank you!

I was a little worried making this since it was my first attempt at making bread with my new bread machine. It turned out really delicious. I think i might let it cool a little longer next time since it was difficult to cut and serve straight out of the bread maker.

I needed a recipe for bread that didn't call for milk (I was out). I followed LUBSY's variation, as I wanted a larger loaf with a mix of whole wheat and white flours. It turned out very nice, except that as my loaf cooled the sides sucked in a little. I think my loaf may have been a little too moist... because I prefer to prepare the dough by hand, and use the bread machine only for baking, I'm not sure if my bake time was too short or if I just needed to add a little more flour. When I let my machine do all the work, loaves tend to be misshapen and I have to pull the paddles out of the loaf. Otherwise, the loaf had a great texture and flavor and I was very pleased.

A little too crusty for me.  Bread texture was great though and definitely rose well to fill the pan.  I'll try the light crust setting next time.

Great bread!  I followed the suggestion to up the amount of salt to 2 1/4 tsp and the bread did not fall!  Thank you for the great recipe.  It is becoming my "go to" for a great bread.

This is the best bread that has ever come out of our bread machine. I substituted 1/4 cup of unsweetened apple sauce for the vegetable oil. We now have a new family favourite.

omg this is the best bread ever!! I tried the recipes that cam with the breadmaker and TWICE it came out awful, all dense and flavorless. Tried this and it was perfect! It was light, fluffy, and tasted like it should. The real difference lies in allowing the yeast to dissolve first and then add the rest of the ingredients like you normally would. Thanks to BERMYROSE for the modifications! Extra great with the extra sugar and wheat flour.

Fabulous! I have tried several different bread recipes and they have always been too heavy. I have been looking for a bread recipe that is light and fluffy and I've finally found it! Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Yes! Yes! A thousand times YES! As per other reviewers I did 1.5 tsp of salt. AMAZING! So simple to follow and it comes out so good! I followed another recipe that was practically identical except for letting the yeast sit for a moment and the results were awful. Letting the yeast activate first makes all the difference. Thanks!

Watch that water temperature! I killed the first batch of proofed yeast with too high a heat and had to throw it away. After that lesson was learned, I've gotten consistently good results.

I tried this recipe in my new bread machine today. After making a loaf yesterday that came out like a football....this one was FABULOUS! I did as a few others had suggested and increased the salt to 1.5 tsp. I also increased the sugar to 3 tbs as I like my bread a bit sweeter. It came out awesome and everyone just gobbled it up!...even my 23 month old twins thought it was great! Thanks for the great recipe...I'm saving this one for sure!

This turned out wonderfully. I added a bit more salt, as per the reviews, and I substituted 1 cup whole wheat, 2 cups white. Perfect loaf of bread.

This is a good start to a basic white bread. I don't know if it's just me but I feel like the bread is going to fall apart when I'm slicing it. Should I wait until the bread is completely cool to slice it?  Texturewise it needs some tweaking but taste is spot on.

I normally make bread using milk and egg recipe, but alas I was out of both and needed alternate.  I found this recipe and tried it, and OMG, it is wonderful.  Couldn't really tell a differennce,  much more economical.  I used 3 tablespoons of sugar instead, I like mine a little sweeter. Will definitley make this my primary recie.  Thanks

Great recipe!  I am always looking for ways to make great recipes even more healthful, so I substituted 1/4 of flour for 1/4 cup of whole ground flax seed and added some garlic powder too.  The loaf turned out amazingly well AND has 4800mg of Omega 3 and 8 grams of fiber!  (That's 400mg of Omega 3 per serving!)  Thanks for sharing this!  I have never tried putting in the yeast WITH the water at the same time!

This was the best bread recipe that I have ever used in my machine. My husband usually hates white bread out of a machine , but this was a huge hit! I did add the 1/2 tsp more salt, it was great! I am making another loaf today. I am going to make this for my christmas party spaghetti dinner!

This bread machine recipe was the one last chance for my breadmachine to proove it really works.  I didn't change a thing with this recipe, it works perfectly.  While the other suggestions are nice they are not needed, this recipe as written is fine!  The bread rose perfectly, and collapsing bread was an issure prior to this recipe.  It's basic, and most importantly it works.  Great job!  Thanks for the submission.

OMG!  Such an easy recipe and absolutely to die for.  High Altitude changes were minimal, you have to just have a "feel" for the dough and add water or flour to make it the right consitency.

Excellent and oh so easy!  Can use with the bread machine's dough cycle and use as dough for whatever you please.  I have used it as dough for cooking a loaf in the oven, which makes a more "traditional" shaped loaf, and have also used it as a base dough for making pizza, cinnamon buns, dinner rolls, etc.  You can use the "dough" cycle on your bread machine and the results are great.  First time I used this recipe it tasted a little yeasty, but I had 3 year's expired yeast and had upped the yeast to compansate.  After buying fresh yeast, followed the recipe exactly and have had great results ever since.  Thanks!

This recipe was EXACTLY what I was looking for! I am new to using a bread machine.. and my first 4 loaves were a flop-rock hard and just a generally bad texture. This is exactly like my grandma used to make, just lots less work! The only adjustment I made was I used 1 1/2 c bread flour and 1 1/2 c regular all purpose, along with 1.5 tsp salt. PERFECT! Thank you for the recipe!

This recipe made an unbelievable loaf of bread!!  Soft, fluffy texture and it rose perfectly.  Will definitely keep this recipe handy for future bread making.

I've made this recipe last week and it turned out great. I just use the dough cycle, took the dough out, let it rise 1 hr, shape it and let it rise for another hour before baking it in a 350 oven for 20 minutes. One question - how do you make homemade bread last? The ones I made usually spoil in 2-3 days.

Thanks for this recipe.  I added an extra half teaspoon of salt and it turned out perfectly.  I made this bread once before using only one teaspoon of salt and it rose too much and was difficult to remove from the machine without destroying the top of the loaf.  This time it was perfect and delicious.

I have made this recipe for a few years now and never had a bad loaf!  This works equally as well using the Express Bake cycle found on many machines.  This way I am able to have it ready in just over an hour.  I always preproof my yeast now as it makes the dough just right.  Add any herbs you want to make this your own.

Well I have never been able to make good white bread until now!  Did what another reviewer said and added extra salt, and the bread came up to the window.  I don't ever let my machine cook all the way though, usually cut out about l5 minutes of cooking as bread is done.  BEST BREAD IN THE MACHINE YET!!!

This was my first time using a bread machine too and I also put the extra salt however I was a little worried that it had not rose enough because at its highest point it was just barely at the top of the inside basket and that happened during baking. But when it was all done apparently that was enough because it was really good. Next time I am going to use the original amount of salt.

This was my first time using my bread machine. I am SO glad I found this recipe and read all the reviews. I added 1/2 tsp salt like a lot of reviewers suggested. I also used all purpose flour because that's all I had. It came out great! We ate the whole loaf in an hour! Then after the bread machine cooled down, I actually made ANOTHER loaf for this morning.

Lovely bread, my 4th loaf EVER, and the only one that came out of my new bread machine fluffy. (Never baked any bread before the bread machine) I did as the recipe said, starting the yeast with the water and sugar 1st. I adjusted as many reviewers said, using 1.5 tsp of salt, and I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I also used 2.75 c. all-purpose flour because that's what I have. (I'll get bread flour next trip to a food retailer) and added some herbs (Italian seasoning, fresh rosemary) for a less bland loaf. Due to my previous "experiments", I was on my way to pre-activating the yeast, so this recipe fell right in with what I was thinking anyways. I will from now on ALWAYS pre-activate the yeast for yeast breads. Yay!

This bread is great. I've tried several different recipes since I received my bread machine and this was the best. I was concerned about the yeast being put in first with the water since it contradicted my machine's instructions,but the bread was the best I've made so far. This will be made often.

Love it!!!!  Make sure you add an additional 1/2tsp of salt.  It helps keep the bread raised instead of deflated.

This recipe was wonderful! I did make a few changes to our liking...I used 2 cups regular flour & 1 cup whole wheat flour, turbinado sugar & canola oil. I mixed the dough in my bread machine, then shaped into rolls.(I've just about worn my bread machine out-the bake cycle no longer works:) The rolls rose beautifully and tasted like heaven! My family couldn't get enough of the bread. This recipe is definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing.

Fantastic recipe!  Goes against what I've always done to make bread, but comes out perfectly every time.  Sometimes I substitute 1 cup of whole wheat flour, as my family prefers wheat to white bread.  I use the 1 lb setting and light crust on my bread machine.

I thought this was pretty good, but my boyfriend loved it. I should have baked the bread in the oven because my bread machine makes a funky looking shape of bread. Other than that, I would definitely make this again for him. For me, I still prefer the amish breads on this site. P.S. it was my first time using my bread machine too.

I have been making bread machine bread for 15 years and this recipe, without a doubt, is the most reliable and produces the best loaf of bread we have ever experienced with a bread machine. Texture, color, taste- all as good as or better than the bake shop down the street. We are now enjoying our 6th loaf with this recipe and every one of them was a winner.

This is a "no fail" bread machine recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and it was an all around great bread. You can slice it thin and it still holds up because of the consistent texture. I will use this bread recipe for company also. Hint: If you wrap the loaf in clear plastic wrap the outside gets a little softer.

This is a perfect recipe and is now a staple in our house. The only change I made was the suggestion to increase the salt to 1.5 tsp.

Used the dough cycle and then took it out and baked it. It's a little dense, but not unpleasantly so. Very delicious, excellent flavor.

Very good.  I generally don't like bread baked in my bread machine -- I always use the dough cycle, then take it out and finish it in the oven -- but I thought I would give this a try.  It was good, but I still think some of the other recipes I have tried are a tad better.

This is, as someone else said, the best bread to come out of my bread machine.  I took it out of the machine before the last rise and put it in a nonstick bread pan and it made a perfect loaf.  Another time, I used olive oil for the oil and made the perfect pizza crust.  Good stuff!

very good slicing bread, easy to make and rises really well.  I used regular red star quick rise yeast.  Add nuts for texture, a great recipe.

Easy and Good. I wouldn't say great, but still have it 5 stars because it was so easy and still had a good taste.  Like another review, I did not have bread machine yeast nor flour.  I used regular for both and it turned out fine.

Easy to make - I had all the ingredients on hand.  However, my family just didn't rave about this bread.  They said it was somewhat tasteless.  I'll keep looking for the perfect bread recipe.

The BEST white bread recipe. It is foolproof and very simple. I did substitute warm milk for the water. It came out very tender inside w/ wonderful crust. So simple but flavorful!

This bread was incredible! I just got about a ten year old bread machine from my mom; in working condition, but no handbook. So after reading the comments on this bread I gave it a shot, and it worked perfect! Wonderful white bread!

This is a great sandwich bread. Nice and light bread that my kid will eat. Not a whole lot of overpowering taste to it, but I like my bread that way for sandwiches. I also upped the salt to 1 1/4 tsp. and used half whole wheat flour and half bread flour. You could probably add some spices or something to give it a bit more kick if you like your bread to have more of a taste to it.

Really foolproof.  I use extra virgin olive oil instead of the vegetable oil.  Also, adding an additional 1/2 tsp of salt seems to prevent those weird collapses that sometimes happen.  The extra salt was suggested by someone else who rated this bread.  I've had no problems since adding it.

I can add and modify.  Making this for the 2nd time with garlic, herbs and a small amount of cheese. I have tried in bread maker (without bread flour) and turns out just fine.

This bread recipe made a very tasty finished product but, the texture just doesn't work for me. I tried the recipe, as it is written, the first time. It rose and then promptly fell. When it finished baking, it had more of a dry, crumbly, falling apart cake-like texture rather than a bread. Then I tried some of the alterations provided by other reviewers and still got a totally unsatisfactory loaf of bread. It falls apart if I try to make anything with the finished product other than toast. I'm sure, especially after reading other reviews, that this is an excellent bread recipe for some bread machines but, not for mine. Thanks for submitting the recipe so that I could try it out.  :)

This recipe was SO much better than the basic white bread recipe that came with my bread maker.  I used a pinch of Stevia rather than the sugar, and was delighted with the results.  My husband always complains about the crust of most breads, but was quite pleased with this one.  Thanks!

as one of the reviewers suggested i used 2 tsp yeast and 3 Tb sugar. i also used all purpose flour and it turned out great. the measurements are much more straightforward than the white bread recipe that came with my bread machine. awesome!! cant wait to try sneaking some wheat flour in it!

Great tasting bread. I added extra salt as some of the other reviewers recommended, but the bread still did not rise very well - I think it might be my machine. Regardless, the taste of the bread is wonderful and I'm going to make french toast tomorrow morning with the bread. Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

I used this recipe with whole wheat flour as my first recipe with my toastmaster bread machine. And, I wish I could have tasted it warm, because I am not sure if I care for it with the wheat flour. I will have to make a batch with regular flour this weekend. But, I love how it didn't require any eggs or milk.

the bread did fall a little but nothing too drastic.  The taste was just ok, like store bought white bread. was not as fresh/soft the next moring.

This turned out perfectly.  All the bread machine box mixes aren't available in my grocery store anymore, so I am delighted to have a good recipe that is simple as well.

Yum! My stepkids love this warm with melted butter. I followed other reviewers' suggestions to increase the salt by 1/2 a teaspoon, and I used half whole wheat flour and half bread flour. And, I always follow my bread machine manufacturer's directions--liquids first. But even with these modifications to the recipe we love it!

I thought this turned out very well.  I have made it twice now, and will keep it for many more times.  I added honey to my second time making it.

Yummy! Just had it for breakfast with the family, and the bread is almost gone. I did what one of the reviewer suggested: used 1/2 cup whole wheat and 2 1/2 cup all purpose, and 2 tsp yeast. It came out soft in the inside with nice crust.

Followed instructions to the "T" and it looked and smelled gorgeous! It was a dry spongy bread though. If I try again, I will  use light bread setting. The texture just wasn't to my liking though.

This is an exceptionally easy loaf of bread to make and my children loved it. I have made it a few times now. I dont think however that it is as flavorful as the bread I have made with other recipies. But it takes the cake in easy to make. Soooo very simple.

First time I tried it, I had no bread flour or gluten to pump it up with, I did it anyway. It wasn't as pretty to look at, but it still tasted great. I got some bread flour and did it right the second time, tasted fabulous and it was so pretty it could bring a tear to your eye. You can't beat that! Great recipe. Thanks!

This was okay. I made it exactly as directed even though, like others' said, it is against my machine's directions. It baked just fine but it made my machine go off balance (maybe just a coincidence) and my machine toppled onto the floor and the lid broke! This has NEVER happened before and I use my bread machine all the time. I was able to just set the lid back on and continue with the bread. I gave this 3 stars for taste. I didn't think this was any better than any other white bread I've made. I won't make it again due to the machine issues.

OMG! This was so good!! My yeast didn't 'foam' like it said, so I was worried. However, it turned out great!! I think I'am going to make another loaf tomorrow to bring to a friend.

This is definately The Best Bread Machine Bread recipe...... I have made it with all white flour and a combination (2cups wheat and 1cup white flour) and both turned out great. I had to add 1/2 tsp salt both times. A keeper. Will try an all wheat bread after I am finished experimenting with the sour dough bread bread machine recipes.

I have only made two loaves of bread EVER, since I just got my bread machine 2 days ago (hence the 4 stars - I only really have store bought to compare to! ;)). However, the first loaf I made from the recipes provided through the manufacturer was dense and the crust was HARD as a rock!  Soooo... I turned to my favorite recipe site and found this one - and it is moist, fluffy and gorgeous - and it rose more than the other loaf I made with the manufacturers' directions!!  FORGET THE RULES! ;) Obviously, they are meant to be broken if the result is this bread!!  (Will check back and provide a more thorough and insightful review when I have experimented a bit more. GREAT bread!! :D)
August 23, 2010 - Edited to add: This is still my go-to recipe for bread, 1.5 years later! I have made several different types of loaves since by adding other ingredients: Shredded cheddar cheese, onion, egg, milk, even cinnamon and raisins! This loaf comes out great every.single.time! :D A+++++++++++++++!!!!!!

This recipe isn't bad, but for some reason both loaves I've made have turned out too hard.  The second loaf I added 1/4 cup more water and took it out as soon as It was done cooking (which frankly defeats the purpose of using my bread machine).  The second loaf turned out a but better, but still not as soft as I would like.  I gave it 4 stars because it is a simple recipe, and does make good tasting bread.

This recipe turns out perfectly in my machine. Usually I have to watch the machine while it kneads the dough and add extra flour or water to get the proper dough consistency. This loaf is perfect every time, even if I add moisture-absorbing ingredients like chia seeds.

I am trying different recipes to see which work best in my Cuisinart bread machine. This recipe produced a beautiful loaf with delicious homemade taste and texture. I added a 1/4 tsp more salt as suggested by another reviewer but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. This bread was a winner with my very picky husband and daughter. It will be my standard white bread recipe.

My very first loaf of bread machine bread and it was pretty good.  Didn't rise as much as I had hoped so I'll use more salt next time as suggested. Overall, a good experience for my first try.

Wasnt awful but came out as a small dense lump pretty much the same as the boxed mixes always do.  That said and in all fairness it may also have been a yeast issue on my part.

I have been using my bread machine for many years, and have been just ok with the recipes.  This recipe I made today for the first time, and it was great!  The only thing I did different was swap one of the cups of white bread flour with one cup white whole wheat flour.  I prefer whole wheat bread, but was hesitant to swap all the flour.  May try to do 1/2 & 1/2 next time.  Don't really understand why this bread is so good, but it sure is.  Thanks for a winner.

My Mom just gave me her bread machine and I couldn't wait to use it. All the reviews raved about this recipe I thought I would just try it. First off it was very easy to do and the smell in my kitchen was wonderful while it was baking, the kids kept asking when it would be done, we cut it while it was still hot and put real butter on it and it was just so darn good. We will have it for breakfast maybe toasted with honey. Followed the recipe directions and did add 1/2 tsp more salt. This was great will be making again real soon. Thanks!!!!

I did add the extra pinch of salt as other reviewers suggested.  However, my problem was that the bread didn't rise as much.  The kids complained that the bread tasted 'stale' the second it cooled off.  Hot it was 'okay.'

So just a heads up if your bread machine has a large loaf option pick the regular size loaf.  I thought it would've been a large loaf until I read (half way through baking) that a regular loaf was 2 1/2-3 cups of flour.  The bread was still good, but it would've probably been better If I cooked it right!  Ha!  Jen

This was the best basic bread I've gotten from my bread machine.  Great texture, nice full loaf and flaky crust.
I went upon recommendation of another reviewer to use an extra 1/2 tspn of salt and it rose beautifully!

Fabulous!
increased salt to almost 2 tsps per reviews otherwise followed recipe.
tastes wonderful.  Had put my bread machine away for over a year because I didn't like the bread it would make. This changes that completely. Nothing beats warm buttered bread.

The best recipe I've used so far!  I was starting to think maybe my bread machine was the problem, as most other recipes I've tried have risen to much or ended up being dry and grainy.  This was perfect.

I'm not a fan of white flour so I used 2 cups multigrain flour and 1 cup white and it turned out perfectly.  Also dropped the yeast to 2 tsp to accomodate for a higher altitude.

I think next time I will try honey instead of sugar and maybe add some milk powder.  This recipe is a keeper though.

This is good - if you follow directions. The first time I made it, I needed to put the machine on the timer, so I didn't mix the yeast, water and sugar first, and it wasn't too great. The next time I followed directions, and it was much better. I use an additional 1 T. of sugar and replace 1/2-1 c. of the flour with whole wheat. It tastes utterly different than store bought bread, but it's good.

i was not impressed with this recipe. when it came out, the outside was quite hard and the inside was very doughy still. some of the edges were burned and the bread itself was very dense. maybe I'm doing something wrong. i dont know. but from what i did, i didnt like it.

All I have made in my breadmaker since I got it a few years ago are the boxed mixes.  Maybe I was just unlucky in my choices of mixes, but none of them was that great. When I saw this I thought that it was worth a try.  Wow; it was great! The texture and flavor are great, and it was so easy to make! I may just leave it on the counter instead of stuffing it away, and just make fresh bread every few days!  I intend to make it again for sandwich bread for leftover turkey. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was the best tasting bread I've ever made!  I thought the texture was so awesome!  I have made loaves and it's perfect for sandwiches.  I'm making rolls today for Thanksgiving!  I did add the extra salt as other reviewers suggested, just in case.

On the whole a good cheescake recipe. Texture is firm and fullbodied but lacks complex favors. I would suggest increasing the sugar to 2cups and adding a stripped vanilla bean to the batter, or 2 tablespoons of lemon juice.

Thanks so much for this recipe! My husband never likes the bread from our bread machine...but this was a HUGE hit with him. He's requesting it for his sanwiches!

I made the original recipe as written and it turned out perfectly every time. Some tweeks that I've incorporated over time include using 2-1/2 c flour and 1/2 c potato flakes. I have also used milk or buttermilk in place of the water. Those changes have given me a loaf that stays fresh for nearly a week!!

Try slitting the top and brushing with butter....

Thanks again for a fabulous recipe!

This is a very good recipe for a clone of the light fluffy white bread you get at the store, but home made. I prefer a denser loaf but this is perfect for the kids, they took to this bread very well. It makes great sandwiches and toast.

For kids who are used to store-bought high fructose corn syrup loaded white bread, I use this recipe and use organic sugar, increasing to 5 T., add 1t. cinnamon and they love it. Just don't forget that you added the cinnamon and then try using it for garlic bread. OY!!

I had put my bread machine on a shelf. I was tired of consistently turning out Rock Bread. I threw out flour, threw out yeast, thinking that there was some problem with them. Not so. It was the recopies. Even my kid who hates everything but burgers liked this bread. The only problem is that he and I ate so much that we may not have enough for dinner tonite!

OK, this seriously compares to Baba's homemade bread. I never imagined my bread machine could make something so amazing. I substituted butter for the oil and am afraid to do it any other way; why mess with perfection?

New to using a bread machine and this is the best recipe I have tried so far. I did mess it up a few times before I got it right because I used bread machine yeast and it uses a lot less of that type of yeast then called for. I learned by looking on the Red Star Yeast website that you only use 1/2 tsp yeast per cup of flour. That coupled with living at 4500 feet elevation here in Salt Lake City, well, you can imagine how much that first loaf rose...

Really nice basic white bread recipe. I messed it up the first time as I'm new to bread making and it came out tasting kinda sour but I tried it again tonight and it's really good!

This is my favourite recipe for bread now! Sometimes I add in things like flax seed, or herbs, or sub in some whole wheat flour. I've even added some raisins, cinnamon, and oat bran to it. The combinations are endless, and it always turns out great!

This one was just ok.  I like a crisper outside and the inside was a bit dense for my tastes.  The daycare kiddos and my own ate it up no problem though.

Tasted great but fell even though I added extra salt as another reviewer suggested.  I will try adding a half cup of flour next time to see if it makes a difference.

This bread is the best.I do agree add 1/2 more tsp. salt. The bread raised really good. The flavor was very good. It took less than 1 hour for this to be gone. Thanks!

This has to be the best white bread ever to come out of my bread machine.  Very light, fluffy, even with all-purpose flour - no overpowering yeasty flavor. When toasted, it is crisp on the outside, tender on the inside - texture-wise similar to an English Muffin, but tastes fantastic.  Making loaf #2 now. Yum.

I received a handy-me-down bread machine and wanted to try it out to see how it worked. The recipes in the manual were old and used powdered milk and shortening (Yuck) so I looked up this one. The 1st batch I used 1.5 tsp salt and 2 tsp instant yeast and it was good, but just a tad too salty. The 2nd batch I used 2.25 tsp yeast and melted butter for the oil and only 1 tsp salt and it was great! I didn't have any problem either time with the rise, but the second was higher which I liked a little better. The one with butter tasted a little different but I liked both equally. Oh, and I let the water/yeast foam 10 min. like directed the first time, but the second poured it in the machine, layered the oil, flour, with salt on top and pushed start. My machine had a 15 min. wait before mixing automatically so that worked out just fine! (Black & Decker B1600) As a freebee its doing great with THIS recipe!

I'm not sure if I did something wrong with this recipe or not.  I used the bread maker like instructed.  My loaf fell during cooking and the bread was very dense and almost rubber-ie.  Perhaps it was my process or my maker (though I dont see what....) but everybody else seemed to have great results.  I may try this again some time.

VERY GOOD recipe!  I used 2 cups freshly ground hard white wheat and 1 cup bread flour, to make an awesome loaf.  It had the texture my husband loves and the healthy benefit of the freshly ground grain.  Thanks!

Really, the best white bread I have tasted from the machine. I think I might try whole wheat flour mixed with regular flour next. I also prefer to bake mine in the oven. I just remove it after it rises the first time, put it in a pan to rise again for an hour and bake it.

So simple and yet so good.  Who knew you could make a beautiful loaf of bread so easily?  I read other reviews and did use 1 1/2 tsp salt however, other than that perfection!!

We tried this yesterday. It came out a bit funky looking (top was "swirly" and uneven) but it tasted ever so good! This is a very good basic recipe and I will add this to my bread rotation. Thank you!

WOW!  Very fast, very easy and turned out great.

Like others, I added the extra 1/2 tsp salt.  I didn't have confidence it would turn out, adding the yeast and letting it "foam" but it worked great.  I put my machine on the Dough setting.  Then, baked it at 350 for 30 minutes.  Perfect bread and great for sandwiches!

I didn't follow the recipe exactly, as I added the ingredients according to my bread machine directions.  I did increase the salt per one suggestion on this board.  I was happy with the results, light fluffy, & soft.  Our family doesn't do bromated white flour, but, I did use white bread flour that was not bromated (King Authur Brand).  Turned out to be the best loaf of bread I have attempted in my machine.

4 1/2 stars!  I followed the advice of reviewers and added 1/2 t more of salt.  I also used 1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour and 2 1/2 cups unbleached bread flour.  My family thought it was delicious!  I also liked that it was very easy to make, inexpensive, and used ingredients we usually have on hand. My kids would have liked a softer crust, but I may just need to experiment with my bread machine settings.

The first time I made this bread it fell and had a "yeasty" taste to it.  I had to throw the loaf away.  But after adjusting some of the measurements, I had success and a very good loaf of bread machine bread.  This is what I did:
only 2 tsp. of yeast instead of 2 1/2
added 1 T. of sugar for a total of 3 T. instead of 2 T.
changed the 1/4 c. of oil to butter
added 1/2 tsp. of salt for a total of 1 1/2 tsp.
I didn't find this bread to be too sweet, like some other reviews.  The texture was light and slightly on the chewy side.  Overall, above average.

Ok, here's what I did....divided flour evenly between white whole wheat and bread flour.  Added the extra 1/2 tsp of salt, subbed brown sugar for the white and added in 2 tbsp of milled flax seed.  I've only tested the  bottom end of the bread and I did bake it on "medium- basic".  It did fall somewhat even with the extra salt. Next time I will make it on the "medium-light" setting.

Awesome, so easy!  I did what others have recommended and added an extra 1/2 tsp of salt.  Also, because I wanted to use the timer function on my bread machine, I did not premix the yeast with the hot water and instead made a well in the flour and put the yeast in.  Love the smell of fresh baked bread in the morning!

This is really  good bread!! I am a newbie at bread making but this was so simple. I made it with 1/2 cup wheat flour and 2-1/2 cups white flour. I also added 1/2 teaspoon more salt because I was afraid it might fall like other reviewers mentioned. Mine came out perfect!!

This recipe has several issues. One is that it does not specify flour by weight. Two is that it calls for the yeast to pre-soak when my bread machine (Panasonic) specifically says not to do this (I assume because it has its own rest cycle).

Delicious!  Seriously fool-proof!  You can make the recipe as directed, or follow the suggestions from other reviewers - either way, it'll be delicious!  I add 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and used 3 1/2 cups bread flour per another review.

I think this would be the best bread that I've tried in a bread machine. I did not give it a 5 because -unlike the featured picture, it still came out like bread machine bread and had the taste of it too. It was much more  moist than the usual bread mach. bread though.

MUCH better than the recipes that come with the bread machines. I had almost given up on trying to make bread but this recipe came out great. It did fall in the center a bit while baking but the taste was great!

Our family loves this bread! It's so simple. I substituted melted butter for the vegetable oil, and only put 2 tsp of yeast. It came out perfect! Warning, if the water is too hot it won't turn out right!

I followed the recipe exactly, the bread over-rose to press against the top of the machine, then fell when i took it out, because it didn't cook all the way--I popped it into the oven to try to save it.  After about 10 minutes, it was sufficiently  browned.  Not only was it a hassle, it was also a big disappointment.  The flavor is really bland, and you get an oily aftertaste that lingers.
Definitely the Worst bread machine bread I've ever made.

Excellent!  Thank you so much for a great recipe.  It rose to the perfect height.  I think it's the perfect white bread for sandwiches and to compliment dinner.  I took other reviewers suggestions and used 1.5 Tsp salt instead of 1 Tsp. Yum!

My family and I love this recipe. I took the advise of several in here and use 3 tablespoons sugar, 2 teaspoons yeast, 2 cups white bread flour, and 1 cup whole wheat flour.  This gives us a wonderful texture and makes a great wheat/white bread.

I'm not sure if using wheat flour messed this up or having used the wrong setting on the bread machine messed it up.  It was very dense, heavy and didn't rise. It wasn't what I consider good at all, but I'm not sure it is the recipes fault.  I'm going to try this again with white flour and see if it is any better.  I'll write an update to this.

This is the best! As suggested, I used 1.5 tsp of salt - and I also used a little less oil. I'm sure it'd be great as is or with the tweaks. Can't wait to experiment with the flavors on this recipe.

This recipe worked very well even though I did it in my standing mixer and not a bread machine.  I substituted melted butter for the oil.  The loaf baked beautifully and had a delicate crumb.

New Review:  Try adjusting the setting on the bread machine.  I needed to take my bread machine in to my son's class for a pot luck and the teacher wanted a basic white bread.  I thought I would give this recipe another try.  I added the additional 1/2 tsp. salt as suggested and the loaf did not fall and looked beautiful, but it tasted a bit salty-I usually cook with sea salt or kosher - so I do not know if that made the saltier flavor, but I have other bread recipes that use as much as a tablespoon of salt to tablespoon of sugar ratio.  I tried the original recipe again, but adjusted my setting on the bread machine to small/regular loaf instead of large white and the loaf looked perfect.  I have made it again using butter instead of oil and if you like a softer, finer crumb use the butter.  If you like a firmer, open crumb use oil.  For a basic white bread, I prefer the butter and would give it 5 stars.  I would give the oil recipe 4 stars and the leftovers made wonderful bread cubes for stuffing.  

Original review (3 stars)I will have to try this again.  Mine turned out a little dense and fell.  Read review that suggested more salt and will see if that helps.  I also thought the flavor was a little more bland than most white bread recipes.  Since I usually make bread from scratch and don't use the machine as much...I will blame the results on operator error.

Something went wrong with this. The bread didn't rise so the loaf was tiny. Maybe the packet of yeast I used was bad? The bread was nice & crusty on the outside & soft in the middle but it tasted slightly yeasty and of course the loaf too small.

I inherited a bread machine with no instructions.  I have never made bread before in my life.  This recipe was wonderful, easy, and delicious.  My 2 children ages 4 & 6, had the whole loaf gone within an hour (they are very picky).  Tonight I am attempting my 2nd loaf (I think I figured out the timer on the machine) and hopefully will wake up to fresh tasty bread in the morning.  I will let everyone know!

What I loved about this bread was that it was not only soft and tasty, but 'solid' enough that you could make super thin slices.  I'll make this again and again.

Delicious! I don't have AC in my kitchen so I wanted to find an easy recipe that I could throw together quickly and not have to heat up my kitchen this summer. I used kosher salt and my bread rose to the top of my machine. My whole family loves it! Will make again and again and again!

Thank you!  I've been trying different recipes, and this is the best on, yet.  It's a life saver, because I'm on a restricted diet for another week. It's great to have a slice of bread that I can enjoy eating.  It's just what I needed.  I can't wait to get home and make another loaf.

Great recipe!  I tried it with 1.5tsp yeast, 1/4 walnut oil instead of veggie oil and 1c whole wheat/2c white flour.  Turned out wonderfully with a nice nutty flavour.

This was a very good bread - a little on the sweeter side, but only midly so. Had a nice texture.

Excellent - I added some garlic powder and some parsley for some delicious garlic bread.  I used my breadmaker for the dough, then baked at 350 degrees for 35 minutes.

I'm going to ditto what MEGAN said on her review. I've tried making the bread listed in the book I got with my bread machine. I never got a decent loaf out of it so the machine went in the basement. I resurrected it just to try this recipe & I'm glad I did. The loaf was soft and easy to cut. I did think that there was something it still needed, maybe a little more salt would do it. I still thought it was great!

This bread turned out perfect!  The only thing I did different from the recipe was that I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil because I didn't have any vegetable oil.

This is wonderful bread. My husband won't eat plain white bread and he LOVES this one. It has a great texture and the crust is not as overwhelming as alot of bread machine crusts. This is so simple. Thanks for the great recipe!

**Update: Tried this with half home-ground whole wheat flour and half bread flour, 1 1/2 tsp of salt, 1 1/2 Tbs. vital wheat gluten, and 1 Tbs. of dough enhancer. Turned out beautifully! It was a spongier texture this way and held up well for sandwiches.**

The best white bread recipe ever.  Easy and delicious.  Slightly on the sweetened side, which makes it taste less yeasty.

Excellent texture and rise; but the bread is a little bland. I think it will be great for sandwiches when you want a substitute for commercial white bread. However, I will keep looking for one with a bit more flavor for when I want the bread to stand alone.

This was a very nice bread. It was slightly sweet and had a very regular, smooth texture - I usually prefer a less-sweet, more rustic bread, but as far as these breads go it was fabulous. More suited to sandwhiches than dunking into soups. Thanks for sharing.

Hooray for Karen K!!!  I got my breadmaker for my birthday and after eagerly trying the recipe it came with, I was very dissapointed.  So I came here...  The bread is fantastic!  I followed the recipe to the letter.  The crust is light and flaky and the middle is soft and squishy...  Definatly a keeper!  Thanks Karen K for sharing your great recipe!!!

It's been several years since I used my bread machine, but I decided to make bread again.  I followed this recipe as written and it was delicious! My husband asked me to cut a slice 5 minutes after it was done - just to be sure it was okay to eat! Oh yes it was and the texture and flavor were excellent. I'll be making this recipe a lot!

Excellent bread! I have done it for the first time this morning without much conviction (sort of national French pride), but it turned out excellent. Moist with a crisp crust, and my husband just loves it. Definitely adopted recipe!!

This is the best bread ever!  I used my bread machine to make the dough and then baked it for 30min although I think the next time I will leave it in a little longer because the middle was doughy.  I added one Tbls of butter to the dough as suggested and it was great.  I will be making this for many more years.

This is the first bread I made in my bread machine that wasn't a dense little cube.  It rose until it was just about touching the window in the bread maker.  Great recipe!  I'll keep this one and try adding some ingredients to it.

This bread is incredible!!  So moist and fresh even 4 days later.  Very easy to slice.  I substituted with olive oil, sea salt, and I used raw sugar. It still came out great!  I have made at least 20 loaves of this bread and it comes out great every time!

Very good! I bake it in a regular pan in the oven since my breadmaker is old and makes cylindrical loaves. :p

Tried it twice: once with 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and once with all white. The white turned out lighter in texture. May try it again with the wheat flour but add a bit more yeast. (I have a thing against pure white bread, but hubby wants light, fluffy bread!)

I loved the taste of this bread.  It is exactly like homemade bread should be.  It was light and fluffy, almost too fluffy...I had trouble cutting it and it tore easy but it was DELICIOUS!!

This is a great basic white bread recipe.  It came out very even textured, soft with a flakey crust. This will become my quick white bread staple!! Thanks for posting this recipe.

This bread was AWESOME!  I've tried quite a few bread recipes both from the bread machine manual and this site, and this one has so far been the BEST!  Brought it to dinner at a friends house and everyone loved it!  Thank you so much for the recipe!!!

A delicious white bread!  I have made it about 4 times and it always comes out nicely.  I substituted about 1/2 wheat flour as another reviewer suggested and it turned out well too...I prefer using honey in wheat breads though, so I will try that instead of sugar next time.  The dough was a little dry at first so I have been adding an extra tablespoon or two of water if necessary.  I use the dough setting on my machine and finished it off in a 350 oven for 30 mins. after letting it rise for an extra half hour...perfect every time!  Thanks for the recipe!

The only complaint I have about this bread is it disappears to fast!! Today was the first day I let the yeast sit in the pan as I never even read the directions.  I threw everything in at once and it came out great!  No need to wait.  Today we'll see how it comes out. I did use olive oil instead of veggie oil, but otherwise than that I didn't change anything.  This bread has a wonderful texture and is very easy to slice.  I make it about every other day!  I don't even bother buying bread at the store anymore!  This is great.

This recipe was the best bread I have ever made in my machine! It came out very soft in the middle with a nice medium shade crust. My husband and kids ate the entire loaf in a day! This one is a definate keeper! Thank you!

This is the first recipe I've tried that didn't come with my bread machine, and now I'm ready to throw that cookbook out.  All of the machine's recipes ended in dense, flat-topped loaves.  This recipe is huge, flaky, fluffy, and delicately flavored.  It actually tastes like hand-kneaded bread.  Amazing.  I'm on love.

This was the best basic bread recipe that I have ever tried.  It is very tasty, soft and wonderful.  I substituted butter for the oil. I will be making this one often.

Pretty good basic recipe, but I prefer something with a tad bit of sweetness.  I think next time Ill add some honey.

This bread was so easy to make and so delicious! I subsituted butter for the oil and added a teaspoon of milk. It turned out perfectly, with a light, flaky crust and fluffy, buttery soft inside. It almost tastes like a croissant! This was my first time using my bread machine and I am so pleased! Thank you!

I used this recipe as a test for an old bread machine that was given to me. I wanted to see if it worked. Well it did work and the bread was wonderful!! everybody loved it. However I didn't have any bread flour so I just used all purpose flour and brown sugas instead of white and it came out wonderful! I will be making it again!

This is much like the cafateria breads that go best with something else.  It's farily tasteless and a bit heavy.

Initially this bread had the moist texture of oven baked bread but was fairly dry the next day (despite being wrapped). The biggest problem was that it fell apart easily - not good for sandwiches. It was also bland; substituting melted butter for oil might be an improvement.

OMG!  This is by far the BEST bread that has come out of my bread machine.  I actually hadn't used my machine in a couple of years because I was continually disappointed with how the bread turned out.  This recipe drew me to drag it out of the closet and give it a shot....the entire loaf was devoured within 15 minutes and now I'm making more.  So nice to FINALLY have a recipe that looks and tastes as good as it should!  Kudos!!

I was afraid to make this bread when I saw all the negative reviews! Having fresh yeast is a MUST. I dissolved the sugar in the warm water, then stirred in the yeast b4 I put it in the machine. The foaming was not drastic, but the bread turned out great....so tall, so soft.

This was the best loaf of bread I've made in my bread machine.  I was hesitant to mix the yeast and water because the instructions that came with the bread machine say to put the yeast on top of the flour, but maybe thats why it never turns out as good.  This loaf was excellent!

I read many of the reviews here before making this bread.  I followed the recipe exactly, and I believe that it turned out just as it should.  I did not find it to be too dense or too oily, as some have said.  The crust was nice and crusty, the texture of the bread excellent, although perhaps just a tiny bit dry.  In fact, this WOULD BE a wonderful recipe for white bread...if it had any flavor at all!!!  It was SO BLAND!          Kind of like pasta with NOTHING on it, except not as sticky.  Oh well.

I tried this recipe twice, a second time just to make sure I had it right.  It was heavy and the flavor was very disapointing.  I have found lots of other good bread recipes here and will use those instead.

I've made this several times and it always turns out great. The inside is soft and fluffy like store-bought bread. Usually my homemade breads turn out too dense, but not this one. A keeper.

I had almost given up on making bread in my bread machine, but this recipe changed my mind.  The bread turned out perfectly and was delicious.  I took others advice and also used part wheat flour and added some garlic powder and herbs.  Thank you for sharing this recipe Karen!

I found this bread to be very crusty and dry which is something that I personally do not prefer.  I also found it to be tasteless, definetly not even close to the taste that a homemade bread should taste.

I really liked this bread.  It is a much easier recipe than the one that came with my bread machine.  The crust is very thick and crunchy.  I will definately make again.  Thanks!

This bread came out good. I made it for my family's Easter dinner and they enjoyed it. I do think that it could use a little more flavor. It is very good with honey-butter. Thanks!

This is the best homemade bread I've ever made. It was crusty on the outside and so soft in the middle I will be using this one again and again.

Tasted great, but the bread rose two times more than it should have!  Maybe I did something wrong - but I followed the recipe exactly.

I made this recipe twice to make sure I didn't goof it up since it got so many rave reviews, but it was disappointing each time. The bread was not fluffy as I had hoped, instead it was dense and...greasy!! The first time I made this bread, I was thinking 1/4 C of oil was a lot and I was right. The bread left an oily sheen on my hand as I cut it. I baked this last night again for the second time to make sure I followed the recipe to the T and it was the same thing! First loaf went into the trash, second loaf...well, I am making the husband eat it since he doesn't seem to mind the greasiness.

I finally got a bread machine for Christmas and have been making bread like a mad person. I've tried 6 different types of bread, but I always seem to come back to this recipe. It turns out wonderful and tastes great every time I make it.

I'm still having trouble with this bread falling as it begins to bake.  It's good even then...but it is great if it doesn't collapse.  Any suggestions?

I can't believe that I have to write a disappointing review after all these raves! The bread tastes great but TWO attempts last night flopped in the middle. I saw that they were rising beautifully but then when the cycle ended floppo! I was exact with measurements!!!! Maybe a little less yeast...I'll keep trying.

Nice light loaf - everyone loved it.  Rose right to the top of the machine.  Bigger than I thought it would be for a 1-1/2 pound loaf.  Have already gotten requests for more.

Yum!  My husband said to make sure I didn't lose this recipe.  It makes soft bread that is great for sandwiches.  Yummy, tender crust! Sometimes I slice it and bake it in the oven with garlic salt and butter or melt mozzarella cheese over the top for a great side dish!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

WOW.  Honestly, I didn't know my breadmaker could MAKE bread like this.  I don't have a "light crust" option on my machine, but the crust was still crispy without being hard.  The bread itself...well, it just came out and it's almost gone.  My two-year-old said, "Mmmmm, good bread, Mama!"  If that's not an endorsement, I don't know what is!

One note - my jar of yeast said to use 1/2 tsp per cup of flour.  Next time I'll use two teaspoons instead of 1.5 - but it's still exceptional!  No more mixes for me!!

***For those that worry about adding yeast to water first, contrary to the machine instructions, it is perfectly fine as long as you are not using the delay settings. Liquid activates the yeast.  If using delay, then yeast should go on top so it is not activated prematurely.  Just be sure  it does not sit in contact with the salt.

Didn't change a thing and it worked (using bread flour)!  It also won't spoil on time delay like the recipes with milk, butter or eggs, so it's nice to time it to be ready for dinner after work.

I was skeptical when I read the recipe since it broke from traditional "add yeast last" but I was so pleased with the results. My family loved it, plus it was so easy. This is a keeper for sure.

Last night was the first time that I used a bread machine and after reading all the reviews I figured this would be the best bet (due to the simplicity).  It was great, very simple, as so many indicated, great crust, and a good flavor.  This is a keeper - rray

This is the best white bread recipe I have used with my breadmaker.  I had always made loaf bread by hand, so it took some getting used to. I prefer to make it to the dough stage in the breadmaker and then shape it and rise it by hand in a loaf pan.
