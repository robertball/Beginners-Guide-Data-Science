I made it almost exactly by the recipe.  I did add a little yellow mustard for a little extra zip.  Like it on crackers and rice cakes.

I made this almost exactly by the recipe. However, I didn't have a whole onion so only used 1/4 of a red onion. Thank goodness!  If I had put a whole onion in it would have been onion salad rather than egg salad. Didn't have parsley, either. Very good even with those minor changes.

I really like this, although it's more of a spread than salad. I didn't have parsley and snipped some chives instead. I also eliminated the onion. I spread it over a toasted plain bagel and it was awesome! I think shallot or scallion would be great in it as well.
