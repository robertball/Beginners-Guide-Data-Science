wow, this was great!  My husband is a big fan of buffalo wings, but doesn't like how much "work" it is to get enough meat off the wings, so this sounded perfect for him.  I only had 2 boneless skinless breasts (.88 lb) so I cut the recipe in half.  I just barely had enough of the flour/spice mix to cover the meat, I think if I had had a full pound of chicken, I would have needed more.  The sauce didn't look like enough, but turned out to be the exact right amount.  It was the perfect combination of spicy and sweet for us, not too much of either.  Even my two year old loved it!  Thanks for the great recipe.

Tastes great as is or make it your own.  I made this as written and all the flavors came through, nice and simple.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was really good. The recipe calls for chicken breast pieces cut into chunks, but I used bone-in wing pieces, only because that is what my husband likes.
The sauce was very good and flavorful. Just enough kick to it, not overly hot with a touch of sweetness.
I will make this again.

I followed the recipe just the way it's written at first. However when I tasted the sauce it just tasted like soy sauce to me so I added more hot sauce. Also after tossing the chicken in the sauce I threw it under the broiler for a bit and I think that made it way better.

I will make this again but I will use my own fried chicken tender recipe. I wasn't big on the flavors used in this one. It wasn't bad I just like mine better. Also I will cut way down on the soy sauce next time and continue to broil the chicken for a few minutes after covered in sauce. 

All in all this tasted a lot more like teriyaki to me than buffalo flavor. Still good and worth making though.

To much breading. Tasted like soy sauce had to add more hot sauce.

This recipe is awesome!  Tweaked the sauce for my family's taste.  I used 2 pounds of tenders - ran out of flour mixture but the amount of sauce was perfect! We had it in flour tortillas with shredded lettuce & blue cheese.  Define keeper.  Thank you!

I've made this recipe multiple times.  My family and friends love it! I always use bone-in thighs and/or drumsticks, which I bake instead of fry -- probably less crispy, but less fat I hope.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Great mixture of seasonings. I don't measure my seasonings just go with what looks and feels right. I will definitely use this recipe again. Forgot to rate with first submission.

Yum! This recipe is so flavorful! My husband requests this once a week. We cut up chicken breasts and make chicken fingers, and I omit the sauce for the kids. The entire family loves them!
