I used 3 eggs and NEVER scald my milk... Always use a 9 inch un-baked pie crust and nutmeg to dust the top of the pie... cooked at 425 for 10 minutes and then @ 325 for an add'l 35- 45 minutes... I always allow the pie to cool 1 hour on a rack and then refrigerate to cool... delicious....

I know this recipe, and most definitely it's still the best custard pie I've had. I had made one at Christmas and my sister sat down right next to me. As we reminised about Christmases past when our mom made all the goodies, we just couldn't wait until it cooled. We began to just nibble at first, but then it turned to bigger and bigger bites. Before we knew it, it was all gone. Of course when the kids came in from making "snow angels" they got the whiff of something good. hehehehe They were so disappointed to find out it was all gone. Since it's a really super easy pie to make, we ended up making three more later that night. One for my sister, one for me & one for the rest of them. Somehow, though, they didn't think that was fair.(I still laugh thinking about it.)

Good but there isn't a lot of filling.  It isn't as thick as it is in the picture.

This is an excellent 7" custard pie, perhaps my favorite, with just a little less nutmeg. I have made it a few times, and prefer the look and taste of this pie when just a pinch of nutmeg is sprinkled on top and not mixed in. Some cooks have complained that there is not enough filling. The recipe states it is a small 7" pie! To make this recipe as a standard 9" pie, increase the ingredients by 50%, making it 3 eggs, 3 T. sugar, and 1 7/8 cup milk. You might need to increase the last baking time slightly. Follow the instructions to heat the milk because it makes it bake more quickly and evenly. One of the nicest things about this version is the small amount of sugar, which allows the custard flavor to come through well.

This recipe was pretty good. I like the fact that it only calls for 2T of sugar, but i did modify it a little. I used a 9 inch pie crust, used 3 eggs instead of 2 and used soy milk instead of milk and it turned out nicely. However, I'd probably omit the nutmeg next time as i thought it was overpowering.

Excellent custard pie. I've made three batches since I found the recipe three weeks ago. This is the best recipe that I tried for Egg Custard Pie.

I followed the recipe except I used 3 eggs. The liquid wasn't enough to fill the pie crust to the top so I mixed up half the recipe in a mixer bowl and added it to the mixture in the pie crust. The extra mix filled my 9" pie to the top. I'm baking it now in the oven. Will post a follow up after I taste it.

This recipe turned out great! The eater wanted something sweeter, so I doubled the sugar and used honey instead. Worked pretty well.

I used graham cracker crumb crust - BAD IDEA. Half of it absorbed into the crumbs, the rest formed an omlette-like layer on top. Woops. I'm dealing with a husband that doesn't like pastry crust, so maybe what I need to do is make the custard pudding seperately, and dump it into a graham-cracker crumb crust before serving. I'll give that a go.

This recipe turned out great! It makes about 10 and is a really easy, good bake. I would suggest adding about 1/2 tsp of vanilla, but other than that it was very good.

Thought I was making a dessert pie.  It was more like a quiche with no flavor.  I do not recommend this recipe.

I made this pie today.  I used 3 eggs and it made a very, very thin pie.  Also it was not a sweet tasting custard at all.

It's a good, simple recipe! I make my own pie crust, and it pairs up nicely. I also use six egg yolks (left over from another recipe) instead of two eggs. Makes for a richer taste.
