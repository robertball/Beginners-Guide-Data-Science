This was definitely a hit at our house!  I made it for the in-laws (who are VERY picky eaters), and they even enjoyed it.  I did think preparation was a little long for a sandwich, but would be absolutely great for left over chicken.  I also put the chicken mixture in the loaf, put mozerella cheese on top, closed the baguette, wrapped in tin foil, and placed in the oven at 350 for about 15 minutes.  It was absolutely terrific!

Terrific!  Very delicious.  Next time I'll make it on wider bread than a baguette as the ingredients make so much filling that it can't be contained in the skinny baguette.

I made this for a party.  Everyone loved it - even my picky husband.  He requested that I add chopped, hard-boiled eggs.  I also omitted the avocado dip because I couldn't find any at the store.  It was wonderful.  I think I will make it tonight for dinner!
