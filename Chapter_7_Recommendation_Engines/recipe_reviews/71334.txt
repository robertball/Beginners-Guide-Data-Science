Used a little less flakes and hot sauce, and this was still plenty hot for us.  I thought it needed some salt (but I love salt).  Served with ruffled pasta and steamed broccoli.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I blended 4-5 tomatoes, 2 jalapenos, 1/4 onion and several healthy shakes of tapatio, but im sure the recipe will change each time dependent on what I have on hand.  I would use a can of mexican stewed tomatoes or Rotel Mexican recipe next time as well.  I also browned the pork chops with salt and pepper on each side for a couple minutes before removing to sautee the onions and peppers.

I've made this 4 or 5 times now, since I have a bottle of dried sage I need to use up.
I've made this exactly as written, except that I didn't think I had a skillet large enough for this dish, so I used a large pot with a glass lid. I sauteed the veggies for the full 3 minutes, even though I didn't think this step would do much for the recipe. Oh, and I seeded the bell pepper, but not the jalape√±o. And I cooked the whole dish for 30 minutes.
This dish kind of grew on me. It's pretty easy to make, and the pork chops cook well, and taste pretty good. The sauce isn't spicy enough for me - in fact, I found it surprisingly mild, given the spicy ingredients. But I'd still recommend this as a quick, easy, tasty and spicy pork chop recipe. Thanks!

Whew!  That's one spicy tomato sauce!!  And I only used 1 TSP of crushed red pepper and no hot sauce since I was out.  My husband and I love spicy foods but I'm glad I reduced the red pepper.   Otherwise, it was very good.  I made a few substitutions to use what I had on hand but no drastic changes.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and tomato sauce instead of tomato puree, and I used thin pork chops instead of thick pork chops.  Overall, the dish had a great flavor but would be very spicy as written.  However, it is an easy, spicy, healthy, quick one-dish meal that is only 4 weight watchers points.  Next time I will cut back on the crushed red pepper and it will be a 5-star recipe!

We made this using a lot of fresh, chopped tomato from our garden instead of using puree - we just let them cook down with the meat and the other ingredients.  We used the dutch oven, which was the perfect pot for this recipe.  Wonderful flavor from simple ingredients.

My husband has started the Paleo Diet and we came across this recipe,because he cannot eat anything fried,no bbq, or anything with cheese. We usually aren't ones to try anything new either,but this turned out lovely. Tastey AND spicey! We would definetely recommend to others.

Wow.  Was spicy, not for the faint of heart or children.  My husband (a long time hot sauce lover) absolutely loved this dish (as did I).  I didn't have any bell pepper and I used 4 different hot sauces (Tapatio, Franks, Chalula, Tabasco).  I added a Tbs of minced garlic to the onions when they were sauteing.  I also added about 2 tsp of salt to the whole dish.  I used 6 thinly sliced bone out Pork Loin Chops.  Served it with Stuffing and Suddenly Salad, with Hawaian Sweet bread.  Wonderful and will be making it again.

We did not care for this flavor. For me it was the sage that added an odd note to the tomato sauce.  It was very easy and I used boneless chops which cooked much quicker than bone-in.

Pretty darn good...the thing the wife and I agree upon is there was a lack of spice for the pork chops...we might tweak it a bit for next time...

YUMMY! We inhaled this dish.  I used a can of tomato soup instead of puree (didn't have), no jalapeno (didn't have), and included two (2) fresh minced garlic cloves (using my Pampered Chef garlic press) and cooked on very, very low for a few hours in a cast iron skillet.  This was an easy dish to make, the house smelled great - I will definitely make again.  The green peppers and onions were a very great combination with the chops.

Too spicy even without the jalapeno pepper, which I didn't have. Yet pork chops themselves were bland. Definitely needs salt. Has potential, but can't recommend as is.

I made this dish for my husband and he loved it. The spicy flavor adds a lot, and cooking the chops low and slow for a while in the tomato puree makes them come out very tender. Easy and tasty.

I used my own canned tomatoes instead of fresh......increased the wine to 2/3 cup........enhanced the chicken stock w/base and eliminated the red pepper flakes.
We loved it and it is now a keeper.

I liked it, but it was too spicy for my wife, even after I cut back on the hot sauce and added no red pepper flakes. I used fresh sage, chopped, but the sage flavor didn't come through. The onions and peppers were a nice touch. If you don't like spicy, cut back and enjoy it anyway.

I made these pork chops for the wife and I. I loved it my wife was not a fan due to the tomato puree. So I took it to work to share with my coworkers and they loved it to. Only thing I did different was I chopped Yukon gold potatoes instead of onions because I was out of onions, I served the pork chops with rice, delicious.

I had to substitute a few things like, I had thin pork chips instead of thick, I had red and orange peppers instead of green, and crushed tomatoes with a can of sauce instead of pur√©ed tomatoes and I added a little white wine to loosen the sauce a little bit but besides that, i followed the recipe and OMG it was sooooooo good!!!!! It had just enough spiciness without being too hot to eat. I had it over white rice and it was delicious!!! I would definitely recommend this if you like spicy. The meat was so tender. If I could fit more in my stomach, I'd still be eating it!!!  Hubby agrees 100%!

A busy day so I made the marinade (added a teaspoon of garlic ??) in the morning, threw in the pork chops, we have a rice cooker with a timer so  set it up, when we walked in the door started the grill, the wife started the veggies, 15 minutes after walking through the front door sat down to a DELICIOUS dinner!!! Will definitely make this many more times!
