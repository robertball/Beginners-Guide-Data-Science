We thought this was delicious - however I made this with fresh asparagus that I chopped into 1 1/2 inch pieces and microwaved for 5 minutes so it was just done but still crisp.

This recipe doesn't call any sodium, therefore it tastes flat.  I added some salt and hint of soy sauce then it's gotten better.

Great salad. Add a little more mustard to make it a little tangier.

I made this for my weight loss support group holiday party and it was a hit.  One of the member's 2 year old daughter even loved it.  My mother, who HATES yogurt wanted more.

I used fresh asparagus so I microwaved it first.  It's so tasty and knowing that it's good for you makes it even better.

This is a great and nutritious side dish.  I added a little salt and pepper just to bring the flavors together.  I like this on the side of any fish dish.

Beautiful salad and very tasty. Since I had to start limiting my salt, I've started getting used to enjoying the flavors of foods without it. This is one recipe I will use again and share with my friends.

This wasn't bad.  I skipped the onions (don't like them raw) and used sliced cherry tomatoes.  But the dressing was just boring.  I added salt and pepper to make it acceptable to our palattes, but even then we just thought it was mediocre.  It was a very pretty salad, but not tasty enough that to make it again.

Unique and healthy!! I thought this dressing had a great flavor but it's also a very strong taste so next time i think i'll add just enough to lightly cover everything.  I also followed the advice of the other reviewers and added a little salt.

Very mild and refreshing flavor. I like my food kicked up a bit, so I added about 3 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese, a pinch of salt, and a generous turn of the pepper mill.  Used coarse ground dijon mustard to mix, because it adds texture and color to the dressing. I also chopped and cooked fresh asparagus in butter first before adding it to the salad. Used halved grape tomatoes because they're tastier! I also added feta cheese to the salad. All tossed together, it was simply delicious. This is my new favorite Greek dressing! Thanks!

I made this salad as written, using Greek yogurt and Dijon mustard.  It seemed like it was missing something, so I added some fresh dill that I had leftover from the night before and some more Parmesan cheese.  With those additions, it turned out great -- definitely a keeper.

I made this on the weekend and took the suggestions of others who had made it. We have always been afraid to try asparagus because we did not know what it would taste like.  We like all the ingredients so I thought I would make it. It was good and my husband even liked it.  I used fresh asparagus and steamed it in the microwave.  I used dijohn mustard and added a little Old Bay seasoning and black pepper.  I used low fat vanilla yogurt because I did not have any plain and I also used the asiago cheese. I will make it again but when I do I will make it a day ahead because it tasted really good after it sat in the refrigerator overnight. Thanks.

I took others suggestions and microwaved fresh asparagus, substituted white onion for green onion and added a little horseradish for tang.  Yummy.  Next time I'd chop some celery in for crunch.

Dee-licious.  The differences:  (1) used a head of romaine; (2) used a little over a pound of fresh asparagus and cooked it in the oven at 400 with a generous amount of shaker parmesan and olive oil (5 minutes each side); (3) accidentily mixed my dressing in a bowl that was previously occupied with minced garlic-- thumbs up!; (4) also thought the dressing was a little bland, so I added some lemon juice, fresh cracked pepper, and salt.  Totally gonna make this again.

Excellent for a low calorie salad.  Unfortunately  my local market did not have any frozen asparagus, so I had to use canned.  I am imagining it would be much better with fresh asparagus, but was still enjoyable.

I really liked this recipe, I added a can of tuna for some protein and really liked it.  I about doubled the mustard as well, but I like the taste. Good, refreshing and healthful meal.

I love this salad! I made it as a side dish for dinner then used it on top of some baby spinach, drizzled a little Italian dressing, sprinkled with some goat cheese & dried cherries for lunch! Yummy! I did use fresh asparagus instead of frozen cut it into 1 inch pieces and microwaved for 5 mins.

This reminded me of a fancy side salad at a nice restaraunt.  It's a very simple salad but the asparagus and dressing is what makes it such a hit.  All the flavors blend together so well.  I made it with other's suggestions by using fresh asparagus chopped into 1 inch bites and microwaving for a few minutes to soften.  I also added a little extra Dijon Mustard for the tanginess.  Delish!!!

we love asparagus & tomatoes, so i was really looking forward to making this salad.  however, for me, the dressing was too bland and i had a hard time finishing my helping.   next time I will experiment with different dressings.

I used hot mustard, which gave it a nice kick.

I was so sure that I'd love this dish because I like all of its ingredients. But I ended up feeling sad that I used some of the best fresh asparagus of the spring for this disappointing result. I can't even offer any ideas for improvement - the flavors just did not work well together for me.

This is a unique combination of tastes.  I like it, esp with fresh steamed asparagus.  (I would not make it withe frozen because the fresh has a much nicer consistency.)  Make sure you like mustard if you make this; that is the predominant flavor.  I love that it is so low in fat.

My husband and I both LOVED this salad! I cooked the asparagus in the Microwave for 5 minutes so it was a tiny bit more tender. The dressing was excellent! Mild, yet tangy! It was very surprising. GREAT RECIPE!

Simple, but delicious.  I would never have thought to put this together.  I did use roasted asparagus and dijon mustard instead of prepared yellow.  Thank you for sharing!!

I added a splash of red wine vinegar to it for a little extra flavor. I'm not an asparagus fan, but the family loved it. I used it as a side dish for the garlic parmesan chicken.

I made it the way the recipe calls for and it had no taste.
So I added a touch of lemon and garlic and it was much better oh, and add asiago cheese.

I loved the combo of the asparagus and tomato but the dressing wasn't my favourite. It was too tangy with both the mustard and the yogurt. I would probably use a different dressing if I were to make this again.

Very disappointing, the ingredients just don't mix well together. Sour and peppery.

I made just the yogurt sauce to stir into Leah Perez's "zucchini saute", and it was absolutely delicious. Next time, I'll likely add more mustard, and I'll be sure to use real, freshly grated parmesan. Asiago would be great too!

This is a creative way to have dressing. I like that it's low-fat. I skipped the green onions, asparagus and the mustard, and used fresh grated parmesan cheese and plain greek yogurt with cherry tomatoes and romaine. It is tangy and delicious, no salt needed. Oh, and I blended the yogurt and cheese to a very thin, dressing-like consistency. Overall, a pretty good salad.

I really liked the greens, but the dressing was pretty bland.

This was delicious!  I used fresh steamed asparagus instead of frozen, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It was a great light side dish for a hot summer day.  Thanks so much, I'll be making this one again!

I eyeball double it for a family gathering.  Also, I don't normally use plain yogurt, so I just bought a tiny little jar and used all of it.  Cut the lettuce and stirred it into the rest.  Yummy

The Yogurt, mustard, Parmesan sauce would also be wonderful with chopped chicken, eggs, or tuna for sandwiches.

I thought this would be awesome for those on a low cal diet.  And it was!  But I needed to add some minced garlic and salt and pepper to make it better.  And it was!  :) And steamed fresh asparagus as it is in season.

Added an avocado and a pinch of salt and lemon juice. Refreshing way to get a couple of servings of veggies.
