I read the other two reviews, one fantastic, one poor, so decided to try this for myself and give it to my unsuspecting husband and 18 year old son.  They loved it.  My son said it "kinda" tasted "something like coconut".  I did end up warning my husband so I could see the look on his face, he was itching to try it.  We ate it cold, not sure how it would have tasted warm.    

I did not have too much liquid.  The other user may have not drained the sauerkraut well enough...  I did follow the first reviewers advice and added some cinnamon, that killed the sauerkraut smell right away.  Once I drained the sauerkraut, I put it in my food chopper for a few seconds and then redrained it.  This was perfect for one pie, I had to bake it 45 minutes but I don't know if its because I am high altitude.  This really is a fantastic pie, now I'm on the look out for more pies that seem off the wall!  Next time I make it, I'm going to try nutmeg and see how that goes.    Thinking about some sort of light nut to try in it too.  I am going to try this with splenda now that I've tried it with sugar just to see if it turns out as well.  If you make this during the day and no one sees the sauerkraut can in the trash, no one would guess that this has sauerkraut in it, especially since the cinnamon addes such a pleasant scent.

I made this with 4 eggs and only 2 cups of milk, because I was concerned about reports of the result being too wet.  It fit perfectly in a regular-depth 9" pie shell.  I also upped the vanilla to 1-1/4 tsp, and used about 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg.    I didn't use any cinnamon.  Before serving the pie, I sprinkled the top with confectioners sugar, and finished it off with a dash of ground nutmeg.

I entered the pie in a pie competition, and it came in 2nd place out of 3 pies.  So it's not totally below notice.  The other two pies were both apple pies, and there were 3 judges on the panel.

One apple pie got 2 winning votes from the judges, the Sauerkraut Custard got one vote, and the second apple pie received no votes.

Mmm! To spice this one up for my kids I added about 4 tbs. of cinnamon. It's really great for family gatherings and is so delicious for brunches!

I like sauerkraut but nothing you do this dish will improve it.  Still, reading the other reviews I went out of my way to drain any excess liquid yet there was still more then there should have been.  I added cinnamon to cover the smell.  Time to bake ran almost 2 hours.  The entire family tasted it and it does NOT taste like coconut.  It was horrible to be bluntly honest and the smell was not of this world.  Thankfully, it didn't go to waste:  Living out in the country, I tossed it to the possums.  If you try this recipe ... don't expect a miracle but you can still pray over it before you start.  Good luck!

Who thought it was coconut?  I can smell sauerkraut!  The filling was too much and too loose.  It coagulated and there was a lot of water.  I used just the half of the filling but I didn't want to make another pie with the rest.  Maybe you can rinse sauerkraut or cook until soft and chop finely.

The pie looked nice (I even submitted a photo), but even with other reveiwers suggestions about adding cinnamon, it still tasted too much like saur kraut.  The sweet custard was nice, but the cabbage and vinegar from the kraut was too strong.  I even used my hands to squeeze as much liquid as possible from the kraout.  Even though I like saur kraut, I won't make this again.
