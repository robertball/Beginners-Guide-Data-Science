This is my recipe, so of course I am gonna give it 5 stars!   I tried to figure out a way to add a note to the recipe and was not successful, so I'll add the note this way and hope it reaches people.    It seems that reviewers have mixed feelings about the cinnamon in this recipe.  Some seem to really like it and add more, and others think that it detracts.  So, if you're gonna make this recipe, maybe it would be wise to take into account your palate for cinnamon and adjust accordingly.

A friend of mine gave me some tuna. I tried the rub and I was not a fan of the cinnamon in it. I made a salad and chopped up the tuna using a squeeze of lime on it. I am sorry ABoston this was not for me.

Really good but cut the cooking time to about 20 seconds per side if you like it rare.

I have tried 3-4 of the best recipes here for seared Tuna, but WOW! Using mostly fresh ingredients,  I put half of the marinade in the bottom of the pan and smeared the other half on top after only about a 40 minute rest period, max.  Cooked it till I could see the color change a quarter of the way up and less than half that on the second side. (Never pay attention to how many minutes to sear a tuna as they are different thicknesses, different temperatures and contain different amounts of water in the meat.) oh my god, the thick marinated gave it the sweetest crust, I love this recipe and my husband said I rose to the challenge and outdid myself.  We get competitive in our cooking!  Like this morning, he made a frittata with feta, basil and durian jelly ( an indescribable pleasure we have here in Bali). Enjoy this delight to the taste buds!

Lowered salt to 1/2,(ground sea salt) then put half of the cinnamon, added half wasabi powder. (used ground and fresh ground pepper mixed) seared at high temperture 2 mins one side , one on the other than lowered heat for additional 1 1/2 minutes which toasted the cinnamon. A little bit of fresh squeezed lime (or lemon) while finishing and WOW!  My Ahi Tuna Steaks were a little over an inch thick and turned out perfect everyone loved them and were all amazed that there was cinnamon on them, although you could smell it once you knew. Great base recipe' . Thanks I would have never tried it otherwise.

Absolutely delicious! I made it as stated and the very slight hint of cinnamon made all the spices come together.It does NOT take long for the Tuna to cook! I paired it with the Spinach and cantaloupe salad.

I didn't have any lemon zest so I used lemon infused olive oil, other than that I followed the recipe exactly. It was delicious! My husband really enjoyed it as well! We served it with a side salad. Would be delicious on a bed of arugula or with a salad and sweet potato on the side.

Fantastic rub - thank you.

However, just a word of caution about "3 min per side". For a 1" tuna steak this would get you well done at med-high heat on stovetop so just beware not to overcook...

I think 60-90 seconds per side would be the go here if you like it pink in the middle.

Did not have all the ingredients, I substituted. As for cooking the t. steaks, I used the recipe with more heat and longer cook time for medium doneness for better storage. I am happy with the recipe. Thank you.

I made this for myself in no time flatland it was delish!  One tune steak 5 oz, cut all the spice measurements in half, only needed 1/2 oz of olive oil for the rub and cooked in nonstick pan (copper fry pan).  No extra olive oil needed to cook!  If you truly like it pan seared- raw in the middle, cook side one2-3 min's and side two for only 2 mins

omg that was delicious!  First time I have been motivated to comment on a recipe. I did not use the lemon - cooking for someone who can't have it - wonderful anyway. I used the drippings as an extra sauce over the tuna, pureed spinach, and toast. Def a keeper. I foresee playing with the spices - cardamom? allspice? - and trying the same technique with other fish. Also, I'd cook it half as long next time - overdone but the spices saved it. Would add photo but...nothing left.

Nice flavor.  I used a lemon off the tree so the zest was super strong. I also added a small amount of sweetener to blend the flavors. I would rank this a 9. My wife said a 10. Will make again.

Had this rub at a friend's house recently and had to try it since my husband and I both loved it.  I made as directed as I didn't have time to read other reviews.  Only change I will make next time is to reduce the cinnamon.  But we still loved it!

UPDATE: i'm so glad i tried this again as i kept more true to the recipe and made a paste/wet rub rather than a marinade.. only difference was using fresh ginger (a little more than called for) in place of the dried.. it reminded me of something moroccan.. probably bc of the cinnamon.. super yummy.. ty again.. ~~ORIGINAL: this was really good.. i cut the recipe in half and used it on a 13 oz fillet of tilapia.. instead of making a rub, i turned this into a marinade by subbing a little over 1/4 cup of lime juice for the lemon zest.. i marinated all day and cooked this on the gas grill.. it was delicious! ty so much for the recipe

Nice recipe! I just made a couple changes--I like my tuna rare, so I decreased cooking time to less than a minute per side, and also added a bit of cayenne pepper to the marinade/rub. Really good!

I liked this. However next time I will certainly use less cinnamon, and would add soy sauce. Otherwise it was very good! Cant wait to try again

I didn't have any lemon or coriander on hand and did modify from olive oil to horseradish sauce. It was fantastic! The cinammon added just a perfect amount of sweetness to counteract the spicy.

GREAT recipe! I didn't have a lemon, so I used 1 tablespoon lemon juice instead. Turned out awesome!
