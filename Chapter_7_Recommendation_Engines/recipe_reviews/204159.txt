It was pretty good, but I made some modification. I used a can of chopped tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes, added some dried basil, black pepper, paprika, and sea salt. Scooped out fat by the ladlefuls and added more water. I also added about 2 tbsp of vinegar at the end and simmered it for another hour to develop the taste. Next time, I'm going to use the pressure cooker to get the Oxtail more tender to cut the cooking time. I don't have 3+ hours to cook a stew when I can do it in less than half the time. Overall not too bad for a basic stew, but you'll have to tweak to your liking.

Reminds me of the stew my mom used to make!  Simple, delicious and the oxtail adds such a great flavor.  1. I used extra carrots (5) since I'm a fiend 2. Added parsnips which was a great cinnamon flavor 3. Used Lawry's seasoning salt for add'l flavor (salt / pepper / paprika / onion & garlic powder work) 4.  Next time, I will use less water.  Soup ended up less thick than in photo 5. I used only 1.5 lbs oxtail and kept rest of portions the same and it was fine

I didn't follow this recipe exactly, but it was delish! I substituted beef stew meat for oxtail and added celery. The flavor of this stew is wonderful due to the wine, soy sauce, and tomato paste. I will be making this again very soon. I will probably try it with potatoes this time.

A great tasty meal, my husband loved it...i added 2 tablespoons of paprika and some black olives for a richer flavour. I also used a presure cooker to cut back on the cooking time to 1 1/2 hours from the required 3 hours but some of the meat stuck to the bottom of the pot and did not pressurize well enough during the last half hour. Will definitely do this meal again.

It's so easy! I made it twice and both turned out great. It smelled so delicious I could hardly wait for the ox tail to stew for 3 hours. The only modification I would suggest is to add some brown sugar (1/4 cup) to the soup base - I like mine on the sweet side! Also, I think it gets too watered down if you cover the oxtail with water. I would stew with beef broth instead.

It's ok. If you notice all the reviews below, they ALL MODIFIED the recipe to make something better. I also had to add more seasoning and more vegetables. As it sits, this soup is a lot of effort for not a lot of flavor. The recipe by itself is not worth it. You will need to be prepared to make additions to what exists here. So, with pass all together or be ready to add a bunch of stuff not listed here to get some more flavor.

I write this as I finish up a bowl of this hearty stew. Delicious! A couple of modifications, I used 1 cup of pinot noir from Trader Joe's. I used 1 can of diced tomatoes in the 1st step instead of fresh tomatoes. I used 3 handfuls of baby carrots. My tomato paste was double-concentrated. I separated out some of the liquid broth after step 1 before putting in the fresh veggies. I'll probably use this liquid to stew some beef stew meat and then add it to my oxtail leftovers. Looking forward it making it again for friends!

Final product turned out pretty good, but I made some adjustments:
1. Added salt and pepper to the flour coating step and during the 3 hours of stewing 
2. Added cubed potatoes along with the carrots and onion
3. Should use slightly less tomatoes 
4. Used less water and more beef broth
Overall, the stew turned out quite yummy!

Great recipe.  I used chopped stewed tomatoes with the onions, some mushrooms, corn and peas and then just a hint of cyanne pepper.
