There are a couple of typos in this recipe. It should say 1/2 cup mint sauce (not 1/2 ounce) in the ingredients. The second step should say to mix 1/4 cup of the mint sauce (not "the remaining 1/4 c.) and should say to add 4 Tbsp of olive oil (not "the remaining 1/4 c. Olive oil"). This is a simple but fabulous recipe!

The sauce was a great hit in my house. My wife does not like lamb so I had cooked her a steak well I had the lamb chops. I served both with a side of the sauce,  with a side of the sauce, which we loved. My daughter used the sauce the next day in replace of mayo in her wraps for lunch.

ABSOLUTLEY AMAZING!!! this dish is so delicious  I didn't add anything and followed the recipe BUT please read before you make there are some typos. I think I figured out the correct amount see below

In the ingredients list it says 1/2 ounce Cross & Blackwell Mint sauce Divided. It should be 1/2 cup divided

on step two it says "remaining 1/4 cup olive oil" this should be 4 tablespoons of olive oil and then in step 3 you use the remaining 2 tablespoons in the skillet.

other than that this is a great recipes thanks for sharing

Simply exceptional!!! Made it exactly as shown and the chops were so delish. It's a keeper for sure. My husband said he prefers this to the other way....there it is.
