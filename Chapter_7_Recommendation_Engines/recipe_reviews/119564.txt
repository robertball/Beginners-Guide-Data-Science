This was very good although I did it a little different.  I left the squash in peices.  After I mixed in the lemon & syrup I acutally drained the juices into a saucepan and thickened it with corn starch...so I then had a thick sauce to pour over my butternut squash peices.  I bet it tasted the same and I liked the idea of having the squash cubed instead of pureed.

This is a quick, easy way to prepare butternut squash.  I added 1 1/2 tsp of high quality cinnamon - Vietnamese Cassia - which I purchased at Penzey's Spices, and 1/2 tsp of ground allspice.  I like butternut squash more than sweet potatoes.  The flavor is milder.  Simply heavenly recipe.  Tastes like dessert but this is very healthy!

Was afraid the maple syrup would overpower the squash, but it was a much milder flavor than I expected. It had the aroma of maple, but not too much mapley taste - which for me was perfect! The lemon balanced out the sweetness of the squash and syrup, and brought out the flavor of the squash very nicely. A minescule amount of extra work made plain 'ol squash sparkle. Brought this dish to Thanksgiving dinner with the family, and everyone who tried it liked it a lot. Will definitely use this recipe again. :)

This was a great alternative side for lemon tilapia.  It has a subtle sweetness that can not be duplicated with imitation maple syrup so make sure you get the real thing!  The lemon zest brings out the freshness of the squash and gives a twist of summer to a traditionally fall food.  We really enjoyed it and will make it again.

This is delicious with subtle hints of maple & lemon (use fresh squeezed for better results). I only used a fork to smooth everything together....didn't need the mixer :)   NOTE-the water in the recipe is not to be included with the final ingredients. Use it ONLY to put in the bottom of a roasting pan & DISCARDED after the squash is cooked.

I bought a butternut squash on a whim and then it sat on the kitchen counter for a while whilst I wondered what to do with it.  I found this recipe and boy, I'm glad I did.  I used sugar free maple syrup, but that's the only change I made and it wasn't a big one.  I couldn't stay away from this stuff.  I know I had at least three helpings.  Thanks so very much for the post.  Now I'm not afraid of squash any more.  Great recipe!

Wow . . . . . YUM!  DH loved this so much he asked me to double it (or even triple it) and bring it to dinner on Christmas Eve, with enough left over to bring some the next day to my in-laws' for Christmas Day.  Very easy, healthy and very, very tasty.  :o)

It's a very flavorful combination of squash and lemon. But it seems a bit too sweet from my point of view. Next time I'll add just a tablespoon of maple syrup. Oh, I added some salt to it and baked cubed squash instead. These were the only changes I've made.

This was great. I'm an older person and believe it or not my husband nor I had ever eaten butternut squash. Since we are trending toward healthier meals meaning less sugsr etc. I decided to try this recipe and am pleased thst I did. This is excellent for first time squash eaters.

This was okay, a little on the bland side, I suppose it would depend on your size of butternut squash also. I wished mine had been a little sweeter. Thanks for sharing!

My first time making squash as a lone side dish and it was delicious. I had a small squash so I cut back on the syrup and butter. Passing this recipe on!

This was a big hit at our Thanksgiving meal this year. Just sweet enough and the lemon, which I added right at the end, give it an interesting citrus twist. I used the squash I had on hand which ended up being a combination of 2/3 butternut and 1/3 kabocha.

Very good. This is one of the simplest and tasty ways I've found to prepare butternut squash. The lemon really brightens up the flavor, and 100% maple syrup is subtle but flavorful. I can't imagine that it would work as well with fake maple syrup.

I am not sure if my butternut squash was just really small or what but there was WAY too much liquid and it was WAY too sweet.  I ended up making two decent size sweet potatoes and mixing that with the squash and the sauce.  That helped even out the consistency and the sweetness but it was still a little too sweet for my taste.

I thought this tasted just OK.  My mother in law loved it, but my hubby, kids, and I agreed that the lemon flavor was too much.  Perhaps I didn't have as much squash as the original recipe had, since squashes do differ in size. Still, I just wasn't into the lemon flavor at all.  I will go back to my usual concoction of squash, butter, and brown sugar.

So good! I might have baked my squash with too much water in the dish because it came out a bit watery. But it was an easy fix..I tossed it in a pot and let it simmer for a few minutes to cook out the liquid. Love the fresh lemon..it added a bright tangy flavor and the maple syrup didn't overpower any of it. I used real maple syrup from Canada and added a dash of salt. Served it with roasted chicken, veggies and cranberry sauce. Definitely a keeper..easy and delicious..how could anyone not like this dish? I might add sweet potatoes and/or apples next time just to play around with the recipe, but it's great as is!

My family loved it! I didn't particularly care for it. The flavor was a little on the bland side (I love loads of spice!) and it came out a bit more watery than would have liked. Next time I will probably cube it.

LOVE this recipe.  Cooking for a family that refuses to like squash, I was nervous when I got a few butternut squash at our local produce co-op.  Problem solved with this recipe!  They were all asking for more.  I will definitely be making this again soon.

This was good but think simply mashing with butter would have been just as good.  I did not add water as the recipe calls for and it was still very runny.

This is such an easy way to turn plain old butternut squash into a dinner party worthy side! I was worried that the maple syrup might make it too sweet, but it was the perfect amount. I sprinkled about 1/3 cup chopped pecans on top which really made this dish complete. Yum!

This squash is AMAZING. I served it for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit. Everyone really enjoyed the departure from the ordinary.

This is the perfect, not to sweet butternut squash recipe. It's light, and the lemon flavor is a perfect match. My mother always made our Thanksgiving squash casserole so sweet- with marshmallows and all that, and I was never a big fan. So I volunteered to make the squash this year and used this recipe. Everyone raved about it!

I probably should have waited to make this dish until after I had asked the question, 'what quantity of squash?' I used a medium sized squash and what I got was a very thin, ultra-lemony dish. It kind of tasted like lemon chiffon soup, which was good, but not the squash dish I was expecting with my Thanksgiving dinner.

I loved this recipe so much I made it again three times this past month!  The syrup and lemon more than provide enough flavor that I was able to cut back on the butter to make it healthier.

Even after much mashing and beating and whisking, the consistency of this dish is too stringy for my taste.

I steamed the squash.  Next time would bake.  It didn't take enough maple syrup to give it the sweeter taste that I would like.  Easy.

Very simple, healthy and very tasty.  Needed a simple butternut squash recipe, found this here and it was a hit at the baby shower.  Will make again for thanksgiving, and definitely use real maple syrup!

Not as good as I anticipated even though the ingredients are all ones that I love. Family poo-poo'd it. Will not make again.

I always saw this funny looking vegetable in the supermarket isle (i.e. butternut squash) and I wondered what people did with it since I had no idea how to cook it.  Well, I decided to go out on a limb and try new things and I bought one the last time I went shopping.  I looked desperately for a way to cook it and this recipe caught my eye.  I doubled the maple syrup (I agree with the other users- pure maple is a must) and the lemon peel, but that is probably because I bought a rather large butternut squash.  If you're looking for a lowfat, tasty vegetable to mix things up a bit, this recipe is so delicious and easy to prepare.  One additional note, I simply used a fork to mash the squash since it was already so soft after baking in the oven.

I was looking for a butternut squash recipe that was low cholesterol and not too sweet.  This was deliciously perfect!  The maple syrup and the lemon are both subdued flavors that really complement each other and the squash.  Thanks for a great recipe!

It was good, it needed a bit more maple syrup for my liking.
