This was a great recipe!  I made just a few changes...I doubled the amount of raspberry preserves and added some minced garlic. I marinated overnight, and then added chunked pineapple to the marinated chicken.  Finally, I added the fresh raspberries for the last few minutes of the cooking time.  This was terrific, my family loved it!  We'll definitely eat this again.

Delicious. Served it with white rice and it was awesome. The sauce tasted so good on the rice and the chicken  had great flavor. The only change I made was that I used raspberry balsamic vinegar instead of rice vinegar. I would definately use that again because I think it went well with the rest of the ingredients. My family really enjoyed this and it was so simple to put together so it is a keeper.

The recipe was just ok.  The rasberry flavor did not come though at all.

This chicken was easy to make and everyone loved it. I didn't put the fresh raspberries on the dish but the marinade was good without it.

This was a great summer recipe. Light and tasty. We actually grilled the chicken, and it was really good.  I had left over marinade, so we basted the chicken with it as it cooked.  Also, I had some Roasted Raspberry Chipolte Sauce, by Fischer & Wieser, that I served with it. Extra super yummy. Most of all, my 13 year daughter enjoyed it. That says a lot. Great recipe :)
