This was very tasty, but what isn't with salami, peppers and cheese on it? I made my own tomato sauce and couldn't be bothered to get the frying pan out so I skipped the onions and put the peppers on fresh. They were still nice and crunchy when it came out and that's how I prefer my vegetables. The flavours went really well with polenta and the 2 of us gobbled the whole thing up for lunch (I don't think you could feed six people with this). My only negative remark is that the name 'pizza' and the accompanying picture, which is clearly of a regular pizza, are a little misleading. The 'crust' comes out soft and soggy, the same texture as warm polenta. I meant to take a photo of it for this site but I didn't quite manage to take the slices out in one piece so I gave up on that. Anyway, if you don't expect to get a 'pizza' out of this, you'll really enjoy it. My boyfriend rated it 5 stars and was happy there was little washing up (especially with the frying stage skipped). I'll make this again, but probably won't ever serve it to company because of the sogginess. Thanks a lot for the recipe.

Great recipe!  I had a taste for polenta and am very glad I chose to make this.  It was a fast, simple, delicious meal.  I actually left out the pepperoni, though, as I am somewhat of a vegetarian, and the dish still had a great flavor.  Thanks!

Very tasty.  I would have liked it a little firmer though, but I used cornmeal instead of real polenta so maybe that had something to do with it.  But still turned out well.

If you know going into it that this isn't going to be "pizza" like most people are used to, this is a really great recipe.  I've made it for my husband as written with pepperoni, tomato sauce, cheese and he loved it.  I've also made it for myself using pesto, feta cheese, chicken, and kalamata olives.  It was out of this world.  The one change I always make is to add some parmesan cheese to the polenta.  I suggest you get out your knives and forks and give it a try.

This was extremely bland and just not that good.  If I were to make it again, I would jazz up the polenta with (at minimum) some parmesan.  Sorry, but I didn't care for this, and I do like polenta.

I loved this recipe! My husband didn't, he didn't like the texture of the polenta crust. I will make this again for myself! I used very little sauce and cheese, just how I like it.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very bland.  Stuck to the pan. Not pizza like at all, should be listed as cheesy polenta.  Picture is not of the recipe.

Knowing that the "crust" was made out of polenta, I didn't expect a normal pizza, this was more like pizza flavored polenta.  It was really good and my picky eater loved it so much that she wants to make it again, only in a bigger pan!

Used the polenta in the tube to save time.  Have made this many different ways; pizza, southwestern, Italian, and Greek.  a quick and fun dinner for after work and you can't beat how tasty and fast it is for leftovers. Thanks.

Followed another reviewers advice to blind bake the "crust" first, and it really helped the texture. If you prefer your polenta crispier, definitely pop it into the oven first. I also added salt while the polenta was cooking, stirred in a tablespoon of olive oil before spreading it thin, and then ground some fresh black pepper on top. Also used roasted red peppers instead of sauteing fresh ones. Will definitely make this again and will play with the toppings!

I found the trick in making the crust crunchy...while cooking polenta add about a tbs of olive oil and cook until very thick.  Pour into a brownie pan (8x8?) and broil.  The oil will crisp both sides of the polenta.  I doctored the recipe by adding chicken broth and italian seasoning to polenta while cooking.  Topped with a light slather of sauce, parma, fresh sliced mozzarella, chopped tomatoes, sauted onions, garlic, green pepper and some pepperoni.  Finished with handful of cheese and a sprinkle of crushed red pepper flakes.  The whole diced tomato did soften my crunchy crust. Next time I would avoid the seeds and pulp.  Otherwise, it was FANTASTIC!

I blind baked the polenta for 10 min at 425 but it was still very soft.  Maybe if it was fried it would go crisper?  It definitely needs salt or stock in the base - I added 1 tsp dry chicken stock powder and it wasn't enough.  Topped with pasta sauce (all I had), chicken bacon and edam cheese - the liquid from the pasta sauce sat on top.  I think tomato paste would be best.

I thought this was delicious! This was my first time cooking with polenta, and I really liked the texture. However, this is not very pizza like, it's much more like a casserole. I also added jalapenos and black olives to mine. Yum!

Pizza toppings on mush.  Not terrible, but definately not pizza.  My husband could not get past the texture.  I will not be making again.

Good, but I did not let the polenta completely cool which made it more soupy

My family really liked this recipe. I added a vegetable boullion cube to the polenta water, which gave it more flavorful. I pressed the polenta about 1/2" thick into a round baking dish and blind baked for 10 minutes before adding my toppings. I used a mild cheddar + some parmesan and Tofurkey Vegetarian Italian Sauasage. 

As someone already mentioned, as long as you know the polenta isn't going to come out like real pizza crust, you'll be fine. And this does *not* make six servings as a main dish; maybe 3-4.

I did not care for this recipe. First of all, false advertising. The pizza made by this recipe can never resemble the one in the picture - that is clearly dough. Very misleading. Second, I didn't like the taste of the polenta and combined with the rest and the pizza itself never became firm... it was like loose casserole or soup or something. The taste was fine but the entire pizza was a ridiculous wreck.

My family loves pizza. We get tired of bread, this is a great way to have pizza w/o bread crust. I also add black olives and mushrooms family favorites on pizza.

The flavor was great, but I read this and somehow thought the Polenta would bake to be a little firmer. I like Polenta but it was more of a firm soup than a pizza.

I pre-baked the disk of polenta, then I spread my favorite puttanesca sauce, sprinkled grated Parmesan on the sauce, then topped with shredded mozzarella cheese and some pepperoni.  It tasted like pizza, but the texture was softer.  As gluten-free pizzas go, it was  8 on a scale of 10.
BTW, my crust looked just like the crust in the current picture.  I made my polenta with some milk and oil and I cooked and whisked  until I wondered if my arm would fall off. It must have been at least 5 minutes, LOL. But the proportions of my polenta are different - 2.5 cups of liquid to 1.5 cups cornmeal to 2 tablespoons olive oil.  So it was much stiffer than the recipe as given.  We ate two servings of it at another meal and poured the remainder into a greased pie plate and that's what I used for my polenta pizza.

After reading previous reviews, I opted to double everything, and put it in a 9 x 13 baking dish.  Glad I did, because the original recipe would not have fed the four of us, two being teenaged boys.  When I presented the dish, I called it  Pepperoni Polenta Pizza Casserole.  This way, nobody was expecting to eat it with their hands, like a slice of pizza.  Generally speaking, we liked it, though I think the next time I make this, I'll double everything but the polenta, and still make it in the 9 x 13 dish.  I think a little salt or parmesan cheese in the polenta would be good, too.  Oh, and I put the vegetables on raw, like other reviewers, and found it to be quite tasty.  I will save sauteeing them for a day when I have more time.  Thanks for a good starting point!

After reading the reviews, I tried baking the crust alone while the oven was preheating and while I sauteed my veggies, but the crust was still too soggy. Definitely come armed with forks and knives. It did have a good flavor though. I told my husband that we were having pizza, which I was afraid may have been a big mistake, but he actually enjoyed it. I think I'll make it again. And it does not serve six. More like three if you have something else on the side. The two of us easily ate it all.
