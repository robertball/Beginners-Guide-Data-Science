Just made this for Sunday breakfast and it is absolutely scrumptious!!  So tasty and moist, and best of all, easy.  Will make it again and again.

I have to admit I made it exactly as listed, except without the walnuts... I wanted a plain, vanilla pound cake to have with strawberries and ice cream. It was moist and wonderful and took the same amount of time to bake as the recipe said.

We love this cake. It is so moist. I usually put a glaze, but no need. It never lasts very long in the house and super easy to make. I use regular walnuts and add black walnut flavoring to the cake as well as the glaze.

I had some black walnuts so I decided to give this recipe a try, and……….wow! It came out so moist and tasty.  I used the “Classic Vanilla Butter Cream Frosting” (from this site) which was a good combination. I will make this again.

Leaves a terrible after taste in your mouth. I'll give two stars cause it is moist. Maybe would be better with a different nut.

Very moist and delicious cake!  I put a cream cheese glaze over it and it really topped it off.  Why would people give it a bad review when they don't like the nuts?  Crazy!

The only change was that I made a sheet cake and added a cinnamon streusal topping. Perfect coffee cake.

We have black walnut trees and I was always looking for away to use them.  This is it! Even my kids that do not care for the taste of black walnuts liked this!  The ones that like the taste of black walnuts loved it!
