We liked this a lot; just shy of loving it.  It is creamy, fresh and flavorful, the panko/onion topping crunchy and quite good. Still, it  needed a little oomph of seasoning.  Hubs and I agree that a dash or two of Worcestershire would accomplish that and elevate this easily to a 5-star dish.

I am not a fan of the typical "holiday" green bean casserole because I don't like using the canned soup and I think it is very heavy.  I was intrigued by this recipe using fresh ingredients and skim milk for a lighter sauce.   I was very pleased with the end result!   The green beans were not mushy and I loved using fresh vegetables in the casserole.  The use of the ranch dressing mix was also a nice addition of flavor and gave you the salt you needed without using excess sodium.   I loved the onions and garlic in the panko, but, I do think I would add some more seasonings to the crumbs or even used seasoned panko instead.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I still use the French Fried Onions on top instead of panco.  However, I make the rest of the recipe as it is written. After I made and served this the first time, my family said they wanted it this way all the time. This recipe is more than well worth the effort.

Pretty good substitute but, I think the recipe is missing something in the flavor. Maybe add a teaspoon of brown mustard to it.

Really liked this recipe and would give it 5 stars with the following changes to proportions: double the green beans or cut the cream sauce in half, and add a few twists of the salt mill and Several twists of the pepper mill. It is otherwise quite bland, even with the sauted onion and garlic. I would also suggest thyme or oregano for fuller flavor. Will definitely make again with my modifications to taste.

I got confused with the instructions and made it wrong, but it still came out great.  Added sliced almonds on top the last 5 minutes of baking.

Like it a lot but needs more sauce to bean ratio.  Tasty though!
