We call it 'FreskaKrub.' Make a dent to put in diced salt pork & heavily pepper before sealing it. Boil for 1 hour (about the size of a baseball) Serve with butter. Make the dumplings with WET HANDS..rinse after each one! Wonderful fried in butter the next day.
Someone said 'remove the salt pork'??? Sacrilege!!

I've just set down to wait for my 'Freskies' to finish cooking. I thought I'd add a few notes to this review. For those of you who didn't have a mom or grandma to tell you a few secrets about cooking this wonderful dish:
Do this next to the sink, where you can have a slow stream of water to rinse your hands well. Your hands need to be really wet to avoid sticky messes. Work Quickly.

After every 2 or so dumplings are added to the pot, use a wide spatula to keep the dumplings from sticking to the pan. Soon they will float, but 'til then, keep using the spatula. 

Have a butter knife nearby when mixing the dough. You'll need it to scrape away the thick dough from your hands. I try to do as much as I can with one hand, leaving the other free to add flour. REMOVE ALL RINGS AND BRACELETS (don't believe me-try it-you'll see why)

Have an extra pan of water simmering on the stove to add hot water if necessary.

I'm not so sure about the ratio of potatoes to flour in the recipe. This is a 'by feel' recipe. We don't use baking powder. 
Clean all surfaces and yourself WELL Nothing worse than dried paste stuck to hairs on your hand & arm.
Practice to get the feel-not too sticky

When I lived in Norway in Sor Trondelag, the Klubb was made with Barley flour and the shredded potatoes were first rinsed (get some the starch out). the Salt Pork was served on the side. The Klubb was served with a sauce made with Geitost (brown goat cheese), hot salt pork bits and fat, and, for some, syrup! with boiled potatoes and rutabages on the side. Yum! it was delicious on a cold winter evening after skiing all day. the brunost sauce was basically a thin white sauce with plenty of shredded melted brown goat cheese (to taste).

My Norweigian great grandmother made this receipe for her husband and 12 children growing up on a farm in Minnesota. Klub (we call it KRUB).
I was raised on this stuff, which is my favorite food in the world.

Just a note: We eat it exactly the same was the first day, but the second day is even better. I fill a frying pan with about a cup or so of milk. As the milk is warming on a medium burner, cut the potato Klub into bite size pieces. I just slice with a knife over pan. Cook until the milk has formed a "gravy" consistancy, stirring constantly. Serve on plates with dabs of butter. Yummy! I can't wait to make this again!!! Thank you for sharing this great receipe!!

This is similiar to the recipe I grew up with.  We didnt use baking powder though and instead of dropping the dumplings in boiling water, we actually put them in cheese cloth and so you can make larger portions.  We put bacon in the middle and salt and pepper.
It definitely hands down is even better the next day fried for breakfast.
Oh and I grew up calling it potato crub.  :)

Good basic recipe. As a full blooded Norwegian growing up in Norway I would suggest halving the all purpose flour and doing the rest of it with barley flour. You can also use oatmeal to make them heartier.
It is important to squeeze as much water out at possible. 
Another suggestion would be to have rutabaga cut and sliced in the broth as well. Delicious!

This is a comfort food for anyone with a Norwegian heritage. The only difference is we added ground cloves to the potato mixture, and served with butter. She is right when saying that they are great the next day.... fry them up in a frying pan with butter and they are even better.

I was reading other members reviews and I noticed that people were having problems with their Klub falling apart. I make Klub several times a year by grinding my potatoes in an old fashioned meat grinder. After grinding potatoes I mix with flour and turn out on board and knead flour into potatoes(just like bread) until it reaches a non-sticky consistancy(usually takes 15 minutes) I use 5 lbs of flour to 10 lbs of potatoes. I then stuff with salt pork and drop into salted boiling water for 2.5 to 3.5 hours. this recipe/technique has been in my family for over 100 years and so far my klub has never fallen apart :) .

Excellent Recipe, the potato balls were firm and tasty.  Next time I will try to squeeze more of the water out since they tended to fall apart when I first put them in the boiling water.

Oh gosh was I excited when I seen this!  My Grandma Dole use to make this all the time while I was growing up.  After she passed, nobody knew how to make it, my Mom never learned!  This is definately a good Norwegian recipe.  Thanks for posting it!

My grandmother put a small piece of salt pork in the center of each dumpling before boiling. She didnt use bacon at all. They are done, when they float to the top of the pot of water. Maybe mine are smaller, but mine are done in about 30 minutes. I cut them into chunks, discard the salt pork, brown them in butter, and serve with additional butter for dipping. We called this Pault when I grew up, and it is our favorite breakfast treat!

Hands-down, my family's all-time favorite meal!  My Norwegian grandmother has made this since she was a little girl growing up in Midsund, Norway.  Her variations were: Boil hamhocks in water to create a nice strong pork stock.  She always ground the potatoes with an old hand-crank meat grinder (I did this for many years, but now I use the grinder attachment for my KitchenAid mixer.)  She also added a small piece of bacon to the center of each ball (we don't eat the bacon in the center, but it adds to the flavor).  I agree with other posters that you must drain as much water as possible, make them no bigger than baseball size, and they are done when they float to the top.  We also serve them up along with the hamhocks (grandma never wasted anything), rutabega and carrots.  Lastly, the "fat" (as she appropriately called it) that we pour over them once cooked consisted of sauteed bacon pieces & onions mixed with melted butter.  It's certainly NOT heart-healthy, but my 30+ member family indulges in this delicious treat at least once a year and I make enough for everyone to take home some leftovers.  :)

Note: (this I learned from my father-in-law who is a career chef) you can save money by skipping the hamhocks & making a "pork" stock with equal parts beef & chicken bullion or broth.  I toss in a few pieces of bacon to the broth to kick up the salty pork flavor.  It's not exactly the same, but it works well in a pinch.

This stuff is the ULTIMATE comfort food!!  Growing up, my grandma taught her duaghter in law (my mom)how to make it so I used to bug her a LOT to make this..
 Here's how we always had it:
Boil spareribs or ham hocks and cooked the Klub in the broth - and yes, salt pork in the middle using old potatoes because they are drier (or so my mom said) (sometimes) BUT we added caraway to the potatoes - served it with butter and boiled potatoes - OH YUM!!!
I have been after everybody in my family to show me how to make it but I think I will take on this one with the additions my family always have thrown in - thanks for posting this!

I was happy to find this recipe, but I changed it a little per my Danish/Norwegian grandma's method...  I used to watch her make these in her little farmhouse kitchen in Mt. Pleasant, Utah when I was a little boy,  She used barley flour, which I used, and salt pork chunks rolled into the balls of dough. (I used smoked ham chunks.)  She made them roughly tennis ball size, and served them to me for breakfast, steaming hot with warm maple syrup.  I will never forget the deliciousness!  I have been looking for a Krub recipe for years.  Thanks!

My father made a broth using a ham bone, onions, carrots, and celery. He then placed a ham cube in the center of the dumpling.  Easy recipe!

My Norwegian grandmother and her sister called them Coump sp?  and we put a piece of salt pork in the center.  Like a brick in your stomach after eating a couple but sooo good.  And we also loved them fried the next day.  Have not made them since my kids were little.  Think I may have to make some this week. Thanks for the reminder of a wonderful old family recipe.

Being of Norwegian decent all of my family members had recipes for this, however my grandmother mixed pork sausage and bacon in the center, boiled them, then she would put them on a baking sheet in the oven for about an hour covered in the bacon and sausage drippings, it got rid of the excess water, then butter and salt and pepper to taste.It is about the best thing ever.

I miss this meal! My dad is a full blooded Norwegian, he still makes this at 69 years old.  This recipe is awesome... great measurements! The only thing I do different is use 1/2 white flour and 1/2 wheat. I was brought up on the salt pork, but I've done it both ways and they are equally tasty.  We always slice it really thin and fry it in butter and then top it with sour cream. Nice to see this recipe shared on here :)

Instead of shredding the potatoes, you can just chop them up in a food processor.  Otherwise the texture is a little off.  It's like eating hashbrowns with meat in the middle. When my grandma and I used to make it, we used a meat grinder.  Nowadays, I just use a good old processor.  Works just the same and it's faster.  Of course the old fashioned way is better.

I always make mine with salt pork in the middle- I've tried bacon but it just is not the same. We also make cream gravy off the salt pork drippings- and I make plenty so we can use it on the fried Klubs in the morning. I like the idea of using a 'broth' to boil them in and the use of barley flour- I've never done this but will try that the next time I make this. I've found that this really is an acquired taste and those that have not grown up eating don't always appreciate the taste/texture of Klub.

I LOVE klub! My grandpa is full blooded Norwegian, and my grandma learned this from his mother. I grew up eating this all the time as a kid. We just use potatoes, flour and eggs in our recipe. Mix it, boil it, and cover it with butter and gravy. I think I might have to make some tonight! lol :)

This is a very similar recipe to Polish pyzy. I cooked and mashed half of the potato first. Grated the rest of the potato's and squeezed out the water into a dish and let it sit for 15 mins. Combine the mashed potato with grated potato, add 1 egg and about 4 Tbls flour. Slowly pour out the water and notice the the potato flour on the bottom of the dish? Scrape that up and add to potato batter. Mix and form into golf balls.  Cook 15-20 mins after they have floated to the top.

I am making these this week-end for the Viking-Saints game.  This is the recipe I have always used.  I do add ham to them once in a while, and will be doing it this week-end.  Again, make sure you sqeeze as much moisture out of the shredded potatoes as you can, so they will not fall apart.  I am waiting to fry them up the next day.  I usually do not have any left to do this.  My favorite comfort food.  They are super!!!

I have never used bacon, only salt pork. I would never eat it only boiled. Potatoes, flour, salt, salt pork. 
Slice salt pork into tiny pieces, do not cook.  Place potato/flour mixture in the palm of your hand, place about a tablespoon of the pork into center and make a ball of the mixture (so the pork in the the middle of the ball; then gently place in a pot of boiling water.  Cook approx. 1 hour on a simmer.  Remove and leave to cool. Keep in refrigerator, or wrap and freeze.  To cook, slice the ball into small 1"x2" pieces including the salt pork that is inside.  Fry in small amount of oil until lightly browned.  Salt and Pepper and eat.  It's great!

Many here in Norway like to use half and half of boiled and raw potatoes.
Also most have the rutbaga in the same pot.

I tried another recipe for this first and figured this one had to be better.  It wasn't.  All my relatives who have had potatoe klub before hated both.  Just no good.

This recipe is so close to the one my Mother-in-laws Sister made. Her name was Dagmar. (Spelling maybe wrong, but you get the idea) Norwegian!!!! She too used the raw and cooked potatoes. She put side pork in the center. She boiled them in salt water. While waiting for those to cook, she fried up bacon, crumbled it up and then added some canned milk. I didn't think that I even wanted to try them. My Husband sliced his up in thin slices, poured the bacon and canned milk over the slices and then sprinkled sugar over the top of that! I was shocked to say the least. I did try it with the bacon/canned milk. It was wonderful.  My Husband said try the sugar, and I'm like "no way!" I did try the bacon/canned milk. I have no say that it was the best meal that I have ever eaten. I still won't use the sugar, but I also don't like brown sugar, pineapple and cloves on ham! Yes we had left overs and we fried them in butter and those were super. I have looked all over trying to find this recipe. Thank you so much for posting it. I'm sure my Hubby will thank you too. I am from Danish descent and have lots of experience with raw potatoes. I'm going to make this recipe both ways and let you know they fare in my Family.

As written, they disintegrated to about half size while boiling, but tasted ok.  A solid, inexpensive meal.

I agree this is a good basic recipe. My Norwegian mom made this often - like some of the other reviewers we too called it Krub. My mom was taught to fry salt pork first with plenty of salt and pepper to put in the middle. The next day she would slice and fry it in butter - then to add the milk for gravy. More calories then just dropping it into the milk - but has got to be my favorite breakfast ever.
