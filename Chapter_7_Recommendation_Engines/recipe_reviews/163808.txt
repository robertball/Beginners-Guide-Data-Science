This recipe is absolutely delicious!  I didn't have every ingredient on hand, so I made a few changes: No beef stock, just a little water and more salt, frozen black cherries instead of fresh, and a sprig of fresh rosemary instead of dried.  I used boneless chops and they were a little dry so next time, I'll use bone-in.  I'll definitely be making this again!

These were amazing!  Only change I made was to bake them about 5 minutes less because I was using thinly cut pork chops (about 6 oz each instead of 8 oz)  and used plum wine instead of red because that's all I had.  I served it with roasted brussel sprouts and baked beans, and it was one of the best dinners I've had in awhile!

I made this the other night and my picky eating husband scrapped the pan with bread to get every last bite.  This one's a winner in our house.

My very picky eaters Loved this.. I left out the rosemary not a big fan of the flavor and at the end I poured the cherries and remaining beef broth over the chops and let them cook another hour at 200.. they were so tender.. Thanks for sharing..

I had to make a lot of substitutions to this recipe. I used chicken broth and white wine and instead of shallots I used 1/2 of chopped red onion and 1/4 tsp. of garlic. I browned the chops in olive oil (sans the salt and pepper). When they were browned on both sides, I removed them to a plate, tossed in the onions, garlic and rosemary till onion was just soft. Then I added my broth, wine, 1/4 tsp. of Jamaican jerk seasoning with 1/2 cup of homemade, low sugar cherry jam. After reducing the liquid I just tossed the chops back in the pan and baked it (I have oven-safe cookware) at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes. I was wonderful! I think there is a lot of room for play with this recipe and it will always make for a tasty meal.

Bravo to my fellow Oregonian. This recipe was great! I used chicken broth instead of beef broth and served it with jasmine rice and peas. My husband said to make this one a keeper!

Very Good. Used some bing cherries that needed to be used. Turned out well.  Nice way to fix pork chops without much extra work.

Very good,  make sure to use dark cherries (aka: bing cherries) as other varieties will make this recipe too sweet.

So delicious!  The only change I made was to sub olive oil in place of the butter (used only about 2 TBS). Thank you for the recipe!

I loved it, but I would say that about anything with cherries in it!  I did not have fresh cherries and so used dried, and it still came out great.

It was quick to make - another of those " come home from work"  recipes. I didn't bother to cook my little chop in the oven.  The frying pan was quite sufficient.  I am very fond of fruit sauces with meat/poultry, so found this delicious.

There's no way this recipe could fail. Pork has a similar flavor profile to duck, which is excellent with cherry sauce, so it's bound to be a winner. If I were to make one change, it would be to treat the pork like duck and use sour cherries, or, if sweet cherries were on hand or desired, to treat the sauce as a gastrique and substitute premium red wine vinegar for the red wine. I'm not talking about generic red wine vinegar. I mean the good stuff, the kind of red wine vinegar you would mix with blackberry puree and serve over ice on a hot evening.

Just okay - sauce was nice but lacking  cherry flavor.  At first I thought it was my cherries but I used the rest of them for a pie which was great

Very nice change of pace to ordinary porkchops. Liked the cherries mixed with the wine. Didn't have beef stock, but did use the drippings from the baked chops which seemed a good substitute.

I was looking for a cherry sauce to serve with grilled lamb chops, and this was perfect. I used just a small amount of onion, as I didn't have any shallots, and I used a few sprigs of fresh rosemary instead of dried. It got rave reviews, and is definitely a keeper.
