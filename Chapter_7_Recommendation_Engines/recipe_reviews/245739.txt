The is a great way to make use of celery leaves.  I did not dry them in the microwave.  I washed them well, patted dry and placed on parchment paper on a sheet pan.  Pre-heated the oven to 200, placed sheet pan in oven and after 10 minutes turned the oven off and left the light on.   A couple of hours later they were thoroughly dry & crisp.   Crunch them up on the parchment paper and then use the parchment as a funnel to transfer to the jar.  This will make a nice addition to soups and stews.  Thanks!

The taste of this beats any bottled, industrial version around. I used the oven method. Will use this often. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

It was really easy, and I like how you can control how little or much you make at a time.

If you open this recipe in the app, you will not see the recommendation to avoid using recycled paper towel. It will catch on fire!
PS - fresh lovage leaves can be substituted for the celery leaves. This herb is stronger tasting, so less may be needed.

Followed the conventional oven method, five stars!  I will use this for the rims when making bloody Marys.

I had no idea until tonight you can use celery leaves to make this. Always tossed them in the trash. Iâ€™ve officially been inspired by this. Works great. Thanks for the recipe.
