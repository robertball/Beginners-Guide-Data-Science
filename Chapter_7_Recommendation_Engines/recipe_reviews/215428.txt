This came out so yummy! Reminded me of a gooey cheese danish. Delish. I made the recipe exactly as written and have to say that I wouldn't make any changes to this recipe.

These pastries are super easy to make and packed with flavor! I made them for a bake sale and they were a hit! I add a little extra brown sugar and cinnamon though, because I tend to want a little more topping on the top layer (it looks a little off if it's sparsely covered)

I sent these to work with my husband for a breakfast treat. My husband's coworkers inhaled these! So good and very easy to make with the crescent dough sheets. Someone even offered to pay me to make a pan for him.
