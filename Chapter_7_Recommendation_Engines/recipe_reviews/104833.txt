I'm new to catfish but I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did have to use frozen fish but because of the poaching, it came out flavorful and moist.  I'm sure the wine would have been good, but I didn't have any.  So, I used a splash of broth and that worked great.  Am giving this recipe to 2 co-workers today since I've been raving about it all morning!

Husband loved it, I didn't enjoy it at all. Just like the author of the recipe says, it's only for those who don't care for the catfish overpowering flavor/smell. It's a good idea for something different, but I will stick with fried catfish.

Thank you for this recipe!  It was very good and even my husband, who typically doesn't love fish, said it was really good. I had to improvise with a few ingredients, didn't have a can of diced tomatoes, but had a fresh one so diced it; didn't have tomato sauce, so used a little spaghetti sauce; didn't have white wine, so used cream sherry.  It turned out very good.  I'm happy to have another way to make catfish!

This was really good. I used fat free olive oil cooking spray to sautee the veggies and sear the fish to reduce the fat content, and it worked just fine.I will definately make this again, only next time I will try addding some fresh minced garlic.

I will make this again, but I plan to try different seasonings as it seemed to be lacking a little in flavor.

I was hesitant to try it, but I'm glad I did! So good I shared with my mom. Anyhow, minor changes due to what I did or didn't have on hand. Had to use onion flakes (I'm NEVER out of onions!!), omitted green pepper and used catfish nuggets because that's what I had. Came out very good. Would have preferred to serve over rice but served over spiral noodles. Thanks for sharing!

This was good but Husband said he would have preferred it with a different fish, maybe tilapia or cod. Thanks, Carrie!

A good alternative to fried catfish, but not as tasty as fried catfish.

this was really great - my hubby loved it, and so did my kids. I didn't have any white wine so I just skipped it and added a little bit of spaghetti sauce.I served it over noodles but would be great over rice too. kind of like chicken cacciatore(sp?) but with catfish.

I was looking for a way to make catfish that wouldn't taste too fishy- this was perfect!  I baked mine so I wouldn't have to sautee anything.  I had some leftover brown rice, cauliflower, and yellow squash- so I threw that in the bottom of a baking dish along with the other veggies, minced garlic instead of powder, salt & pepper, a touch of water, and baked it for 30 mins to soften them up a bit.  Then I added the catfish topped with olive oil, s&p, lemon juice, and the canned tomatoes.  I covered it with foil and baked it for another 25 or so mins.   It was fabulous!  I really dislike fish, but in this recipe I hardly noticed it!  THanks for the inspiration!!!

Great recipe! I'm a vegan but I cooked it for my family - used tilapia instead, and I didnt have tomato sauce, so I used a 28oz. can of diced tomatoes, and used half, then pureed the rest for a 'sauce'. I served it on top of mixed greens, which wilted gracefully for a healthy, low-fat and nutrient-filled dish! My eaters loved it.

This recipe was a great idea!  I added some minced fresh garlic to the sauce and a teaspoon of garlic powder.  We love garlic!  And it came out really good.  We also used steaked catfish that we caught ourselves and grilled them! Then poured this sauce over it.   All I can say is Yum! Delicious!   This is a keeper!

Awesome recipe.  I used red/yellow peppers instead of bell because I had them on hand and I forgot the wine!  But it turned out great- I served over brown rice.  My hubby & I really enjoyed this.  You will too.

After reading the reviews, I put my own spin on this recipe.  For the diced tomatoes I used Rotel diced tomatoes w/ chilis.  I doubled the peppers and onions.  I also used 4 small cloves of grated FRESH garlic and herbs.  The results were outstanding!  Zesty but not overpowering.  We loved it and will absolutely make this again!

I think next time I would like to use all fresh tomatoes.  The canned tomatoes had quite a strong acidic flavor against the mellow catfish.  Other than that delicious!

I was looking for new catfish recipes in place of my usual sauté or broil it with Cajun seasoning, and this is easy and excellent!  While eating my husband said, "You sure make good catfish!"  I made it as your intro said, cooked the sauce separately and then broiled the catfish with just a bit of salt and pepper, thus eliminating the additional oil.  I served it over brown rice and with broccoli. Yummy.  I did add about a 1/3 tsp. of Cajun seasoning but only the heat came through so I'll just add a dash of a hot sauce next time.  Didn't have carrot or tomato sauce and look forward to using them next time as I'm trying to have as many veggies at dinner as I can fit in, and then having smaller amounts of protein and carbs.

This recipe was great!I actually had all the ingredients which almost never happens.
