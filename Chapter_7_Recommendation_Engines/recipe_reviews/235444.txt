I love ginger but honestly, these cookies were a bit too strong for me. The "bite" from the ginger was too much so I'll probably use 3 teaspoons max next time. Also, teaspoon-sized balls were too small. The bottoms burnt and I had to throw about a dozen of them away. However, when I made them at least tablespoon-sized, the tops cracked, just like the directions said, and they turned out fine.

LONG LAST…perfect ginger cookies.  After much experimentation with many recipes, I just made this recipe EXACTLY as it read.  My husband, a life-long cookie lover, said moments ago, "These are the best cookies I have ever had." Cooked to a chewy/crispy wonderfulness in a well pre-heated oven for 10 minutes (for once exactly the time stated in the recipe!), left to cool just a bit on the pan…then viola…perfection.

Brought a big batch to work and people kept coming back for more. You're missing out if you don't put in the candied ginger. It's very affordable if you get it from the bulk aisle of a larger grocery store. Just chop it finely and you'll get an excellent extra spiciness. I only made two changes, which I borrowed from other comments: 1) I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, which worked fine, but honestly there's not much need to double down on the molasses here, so next time I'll try the recipe as stated. 2) I rolled the balls of dough in white sugar before baking them, which gave them a wonderful look and feel.

These are very good in terms of texture and flavor. I changed one thing on the second batch, because even though there is molasses, it is not enough to cut the bitterness of the baking soda. I reduced the soda to 1/2 teaspoon and added 2 teaspoons of baking powder instead. That seemed to give it enough leavening power. You could also add cream of tartar in an equal amount to the soda. The second batch I made with this alteration was perfect, and I will definitely make them again.

These cookies turned out very well! Perfect combination of chewy soft insides but firm outside.  I cooked for 9 min instead of 10 because my oven is convection.  I did not have crystallized ginger so I omitted it.  I also chilled the batter for 15 minutes before rolling them into balls and then coating in granulated sugar.  (I'll chill for 30 next time) This kept the cookies from going too flat.  I agree with another reviewer that I could taste the baking soda ever so slightly, so next time I will try her suggestion of baking powder and soda.  I think the ginger amount was just right.  I did not have all spice so I used 1/8 tsp nutmeg and 1/8 tsp cloves.  I'll certainly be making again, kids and husband gobbled them up!!

The texture was absolutely perfect. The only thing I'd do differently next time is cut the ginger in half. I didn't add the crystallized ginger and still I think 4 tsp of ground ginger is just way too much. All other recipes use about the same ratio of ginger to other spices or they use more cinnamon actually. I could only eat one or two cookies in one sitting because the ginger was overwhelming.

Best ginger cookie ever.  I made these without the crystallized ginger and they were amazing. Spice level is perfect but not for the faint of heart.

Terrific cookies! I did use Crisco (I had some to use up) but I did not have crystallized ginger and they turned out beautiful. I also dropped rolled cookies in a bowl with about 4 TBS of regular sugar and shook the bowl to lightly coat the cookies and flattened slightly with a spatula. Ate 3 immediately!

I used this recipe and prefer more of a bite and less sugar.  I followed the recipe and they were ginger tasting but no bite and too sweet.

Very nice, light-tasting, moist ginger cookies. Don't try to pick them up until they've cooled. Needed 12 minutes in my oven. Roll them in white sugar before you put them in the oven!

Didn't have any crystallized ginger but made it just as the recipe says and they were amazing! When my oven didn't keep up the temperature well, they didn't crackle on the top. Still, good for eating and absolutely amazing with a cold glass of milk.

They turned out great moist in the centre and crispy edges. Make sure NOT to over bake, once they have crackled on top take out of oven then to rack in 1 minute. My oven was 10 minutes. I added some white chocolate chunks it gives a creamy relief for those who aren't used to ginger. I will be using this as my go to ginger cookie. Even better the next day, make sure they are stored air tight.

Worked very well.  I made it just as instructed for half of the dough.  For the other half,  i added chopped walnuts and dates.  This way people can have it plain style or with some chunkiness..

Slightly crisp but not crunchy, the texture is perfect, unfortunately I don't know why the top didn't crinkle. I took reviewers' advice and cut back to 3 tsp. of ginger. Also used 1/2 tsp baking soda and 2 tsp. of baking powder and for me the cookies were just the right  amount of spice/ginger.  It made 40 cookies with about a TBL dough that spread into 2" circles.  I baked it for a friend who is going through chemo, ginger is supposed to help with nausea.

Excellent!  The cookies were soft and had all the love of childhood soft ginger snaps! I rolled mine in sugar and left some out that I spoon dropped. Both good but rolled were much prettier!

used all butter, no shortening; used brown sugar, richer flavor. not too strong as a few reviews have said, just right! 
i will try coconut oil next time to see what difference that makes.

Take out when puffed, lightly push down, sprinkle with coarse sugar, and put back in the oven for a minute--perfect and chewy. Ginger level is perfect with chopped ginger added. I use brown sugar.

The best ginger cookie! I used to buy organic pre-sliced ginger cookie dough but it's expensive. This is, by far, way better. I doubled the recipe, formed the extra dough into balls, placed them on a parchment-lined cookie sheet, froze them, placed them in a gallon freezer bag, and stored them in the freezer. They freeze well and the frozen ones bake well...Money saver!

The texture is fantastic and they turned out perfectly chewy. My only change is to add in more crystallized ginger. I put in 2/3 of a cup and I thought it could've used even a little more and maybe another half TSP of ground ginger. I will definitely add this to my cookie rotation!

This is the second time I've made these cookies.  I added crystalized ginger this time.  For the cost of the ginger (8.89 from the Wal-mart baking/spice section), it  didn't make that much of a difference. 1/3 cup is the whole bottle pretty much.  They were delicious but were also delicious without it.  HOWEVER... this is an amazing cookie recipie.  Definitely chill your dough before rolling into balls and I rolled mine in sugar before putting them on the cookie sheet.  I did not flatten either.  They do that all by themselves.  GREAT GINGER COOKIE!

These cookies are delicious! They are not overly gingerly or molasses-y.  The only thing I changed was 1/2 dark brown sugar + 1/2 white sugar and I rolled 1/2 teaspoons of them in sugar before cooking them. They turned out perfect. My boyfriend loves ginger and he thought they could have used more ginger! I thought they were delicious. They were fast and easy to make.

Wonderful! I was out of allspice so I left that out, and I used the crystallized ginger. I also did that thing where you roll the balls in sugar before you bake them. Mine were done a little ahead of the ten minutes, but I think that's my oven. Perfect blend of crispy/chewy with a good ginger flavor, everyone loved them!

Very good recipe.  I omitted the crystallized ginger and dipped cookie dough ball in sugar before baking.  Nice and chewy, but I do think I'll lower the amount of ginger by about 30%.  They have some heat to them.

Made them without the crystallized ginger, and rolled the balls in granulated sugar before baking. Turned out absolutely perfect! This recipe made 32 cookies with my small cookie scoop.

I added 3 teaspoons ground ginger since the warning of the other person who thought it was too strong and then I flattened a good sized ball between my palms and this spliced it with a small gingerbread man cookie cutter. It cooked the same, 10 minutes. Yummy!

For the ultimate, try marinating the crystallized ginger in 1/2 cup of whiskey, scotch or rum.

The cookies came out crispy, rather than chewy for some reason. I suggest using three teaspoons of ground ginger rather than four.  I also suggest sprinkling a dash of salt on top of each ball of dough just before putting in the oven.

Excellent cookie! I did not use the crystalized ginger. This is a nice accent to an assortment of Christmas cookies.

The taste was great however, the cookies were flat.
