I made it with Wheat Chex, Cheerios, pretzels & peanuts.  I poured the melted butter & worcestershire mixture over & then shook seasoned salt, celery salt, garlic powder & onion powder over all, each time I stirred.  It had just the right amount of flavor.

I increased the Worcestershire sauce to 4 tablespoons and onion powder instead of celery salt.  I also baked it in the Crock-Pot.  Do not cover the crock, cook for 2 hours on high and 2 hours on low, stirring every 30 minutes.  Yummy, easy snack!!

Recipe is a too salty for me.  I will probably substitute the garlic salt for powder the next time I make it and maybe eliminate the celery salt altogether.

This was a very good snack mix.  The seasoning is mild, but tasty.  As other reviewers suggested I omitted the celery salt and used garlic powder rather than garlic salt.  I baked mine in a Pyrex roasting pan and didn't have any issues with burning.  My toasted oat cereal did shrivle up and look like something that had been stuck to my daughter's chair for a couple of days.  Next time I will just replace them with something else.  Because I have an 18 month old I replaced the nuts with Goldfish crackers.

This recipe was good but there was a tad too much seasoning.  Next time I make it I'll cut back.

Not sure what I did wrong, but these burned. Obviously I cooked them on the wrong pan....I used baking sheets. Can someone please advise?? I did take the advice of previous ratings and cut back on the salt, eliminating the garlic salt and using powder instead. They would have tasted great if they hadn't have burned after 10 mins. I even had the heat lower and the rack raised! Help!!

As I've made snack mixes before, I've had a little trial and error to go on before I made this particular snack mix. Because I didn't want the margerine to "turn" on this mix, I used vegetable oil instead. I used Beau Monde seasoning instead of celery salt (I don't have celery salt on hand) and garlic POWDER instead of garlic salt. This was good but a little TOO salty. Next time, I'll cut back on or cut out the seasoning salt all together. NOTE: If you bake this at 275*, you shouldn't have an issue with burning if you stir the mix in the pan every fifteen minutes. Setting a timer to go off every fifteen minutes helps. Sometimes, it won't need the whole time the recipe asks for, it might be done sooner.

I used one stick of unsalted butter. Homemade no-salt seasoning mix, garlic powder & onion powder. Doubled worcestershire. Just had peanuts instead of mixed nuts. Added Cheez-its in place of the Wheat cereal. Used the biggest cookie sheet (with sides) I could find.

I added a bunch more things such as roasted soynuts and roasted peas and garlic flavored sesame sticks.  Pretty popular but probably better tasting without the extras.  Glass pan worked fine for me.

Mmm, this kind of party mix always reminds me of christmas.  I used 10 cups total of pretzels, cheerios, shreddies, and cheese nips (brother is allergic to nuts).  I also increased the worcestershire sauce to 1/4 cup and only used half the oil.

I changed the celery salt to celery seed-used less. all the salts were changed to powders, used CostCos's no salt seasoning. used real unsalted butter. didn't have any mixed nuts handy, but used 2 types of pretzels & some oyster crackers. Seems like it will be a good last-minute snack while visiting the neighbors today!

I followed this recipe exactly, and it came out all wrong. I wound up using the recipe on the Chex box, and it came out perfect. This recipe was too greasy and salty.

Instead of oat cereal, I added Spicey Cheese-Its, it was delicious.  Made from similar recipe I had used before, and plan to make as gifts for Christmas for the nephews in the family.

We liked this recipe.  First time was at Halloween and it was little salty for us.  For Christmas I made it with butter since I was out of margarine.  I was out of celery salt so left it out and used only 1 tsp garlic powder.  Used the rest of ingredients exactly and it turned out great!

I combined some of the other reviewer's notes and another recipe because I LOVE salty crunchy snacks.  My favorite is the wheat Chex so I put in 4 cups, 3 cups corn Chex, 3 cups rice Chex, 1 cup of roasted cashews/almonds, and 1 cup of pretzels.  6 tbl of butter, 2 tbl water, .5 tsp garlic powder, .5 tsp onion powder, 3 tsp season salt, and 3 tbl W. sauce.  I used the convection setting on my oven so baked it at 250 deg x 30 min, stirring once. I can't stop eating it even though it's still a bit too hot!

Way to much salt and way to much butter. I would suggest either decreasing the salt by using garlic powder and halfing the butter, or doubling the cereal. I would also add extra worcestershire - 2 tsp just didn't seem like enough.

Followed the recipe seasonings to a T and it was perfect.  Added 10 cups total of cereal and snacks but changed amounts to suit our tastes.  Wasn't greasy once cooled and freezes well for a nice treat when friends pop in or just when you need a good snack!  Didn't find it too salty at all!  Thank-you for the submit!  Will definately make again and maybe try different ingredients like Asian rice crackers etc.

Made this recipe but only had butter, it was way too buttery and salty for my taste.  Next time I will reduce the amount of salt, use margarine and probably pour the mixture OVER the chex so that some arent' so saturated while others are dry.

great recipe! I did change a few things though! I used 2.5 cups of each cereal because of all the butter and used 6 tsp. worcestershire sauce. onion powder and garlic powder 2 tsp each. I added extra seasoning salt around 4 tsp... did not burn because I did it at 250 degrees instead of 275. I also used two cookie sheets because of using more cereal. I also used the whole can of nuts. turned out great!

Traditional and just the way I like it. It seemed like a whole lot of butter, so I only used half of it. And it turned out just fine. Next time I think I'll hold back a little on the seasonings, too. It was a little too much, especially as we got to the bottom of the bowl where all the salt had settled. Yum Yum!

I have been making chex mix for years and this one i thought had the best flavor however as im reading these reviews im noticing that people are having problems with it burning and some of the cereal shriveling up that is because this recipe calls for margerine and when you use margerine it soaks in too much and can make it soggy or burn! Try using 1 stick of butter!You will get better results

It uses to much butter & to salty.  I ended up buy the name brand chex to get the original recipe which used about half the butter otherwise and salt.

Used the recipe as is and it is inedible.  We like salt but this is beyond salty.  If I ever make it again I would use garlic powder or onion powder.  I added a little more butter, several cups of cereal and re-heated to try to salvage it.  Other than too salty the taste was good.

Made without celery salt, but was great even with the omission, perfect for the kids to help with and enjoy!

OMG, this was sooooo salty!  I tried making another batch without salt to lighten it up,  The flavour was good... but, if I made it again I might try making it with 1/4 of the salt.

I rarely make a new recipe without reading the reviews.  I did with this one because the ingredients looked right compared to other recipes I have for party mix.  This turned out to be a big mistake!  The only change I made to the recipe was to use butter instead of marj. and cut it back to 3/4 cup instead of a cup.  I probably could have cut it to 1/2 cup.  I used all the salts in the amounts listed.  I LOVE salt and this was WAY TOO SALTY, even for me.  The next time, I'll use half of what is called for.

I make a similar recipe but cook it in the microwave in just minutes.  Put all cereal and spices and melted butter in a microwave safe bowl, stir well cook on high for 2 minutes, stir cook for 1 1/2 minutes stir and cook for 1 minute.  Take out and cool. Just make sure the bowl in not a plastic type bowl as butter reacts to the plastic

THE BEST PAN TO USE.....My family has been making this for years, at least our own version.  Some people were asking about the pan...the best thing we have found is to use the big dark blue pan with the lid you make turkey in and divide it into 2 batches. My sister uses the bottom of hers and the lid of hers as the 2 pans! I usually use the bottom of my pan and buy a big aluminum roasting pan for the other.Our recipe is bigger though.....

This is a good basic recipe without the celery salt. I subb'd garlic powder for the salt and increased Worchestershire. I found some Cajun mix in the bulk foods dept of my grocery and used three cups in place of the oat cereal. This recipe is very versatile. Any snack item that has a crunchy texture can go in it. Try cheetos,fritos and garlic bites, as well.

I'm not sure what happened with these but they didn't turn out all that well.  The butter had an overwhelming greasy taste.  I served them at my husbands poker game and they weren't a very big hit.  I'm going to give them another try as it's probably something I did wrong.

Didn't have all the ingredients, but went ahead with substitutions anyways.  Didn't have margarine, celery salt, 2 kinds of cereal squares and mixed nuts.  Instead substituted butter, gold fish, chow mein noodles, unsalted pretzels, oyster crackers, cheetos and a few chips and shakes of celery seed.  Used garlic powder instead of salt.  Baked at 250 for 30 minutes.  My oven was starting to burn at 275.  Overall, I thought it was a decent substitution (and allowed me to clean out the cubboards!).  Thanks.

I recently made a  big batch of party mix for the first time and used this as my guide. I made a few minor adjustments, but being able to follow this recipe was a big help. Final results? I heard many good comments at the party i took it to.

I love this stuff.  I have to ration myself because otherwise I will eat the whole batch.  I love salty stuff, so maybe that's why.

TOO MUCH SALT!  My family and I ate three pieces and then had to drink a full glass of water.  WOW.  We cut the salt in half on the next batch and it was still too salty.  Then we made batches with no salt at all just to mix them together and hope the end product turned out okay.  I will not be using this recipe again.
