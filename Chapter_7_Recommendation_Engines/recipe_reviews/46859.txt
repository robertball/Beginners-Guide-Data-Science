This is the most horrible casserole my family has ever eaten. Nothing could make it worse. It tastes worse than alpo smells. If you hate your family cook this.

Excellent casserole! By accident, more broccoli fell out of the bag when I was dumping it in but still very good! Also, I used brown rice but next time I will use white and added a dash of S&P.  We all love broccoli, chicken and cheese so this was a delicious and filling meal.  Will make again.

My boyfriend and I really liked this recipe.  I took into consideration all the reviewers' suggestions and it came out wonderfully.  

I added an extra cup of cubed chicken and an extra cup of rice.  I used about 2 cups of fresh steamed broccoli and 1 cup of fresh sliced mushrooms.  I used one can of cream of mushroom soup and one can of cream of chicken soup. I left out the water chestnuts and the celery because they just don't do it for me in a casserole. I sauteed the onion and mushrooms then added all the other ingredients, adding shredded Colby cheese only after it was in the baking dish and ready to be baked. 

Again, I'm very pleased with how this turned out.  My only wish is that I had something crunchy to top it off at the end.  Maybe French fried onions?

My family loved this. I left out the things I knew they wouldn't like (celery, water chestnuts and mushrooms) and added a little cheese whiz to add to the cheesyness. They loved it and I will make again. Will probably put less onion in next time to make it more kid friendly!

Very versatile!  The water chestnuts gave it just the texture needed for such a creamy meal.  I sauted 8oz. of fresh mushrooms with the onions and celery (no canned mushrooms). And I used two cans of soup and doubled the chicken broth.  I also cooked my rice with the remainder of the broth.  I added an extra cup of chicken.  Since I don't care for frozen veggies, I used fresh broccoli and parboiled it for a moment. Everyone enjoyed it!

I found this recipe because I had some leftover chicken as well as rice.  The only ingredient I didn't have was the celery.  It was surprisingly very good!  I added garlic pepper spice and some paprika.  Great recipe to make use of leftovers.

I cooked the onion and celery in chicken broth instead of butter to reduce the fat, and I used cream of broccoli soup, since I didn't have cream of celery. I also left out the mushrooms since I'm allergic. Since some reviewers had said it could be dry, I left the rice out of the casserole and then served it over rice. The celery and water chestnuts gave it just the right amount of crunch, and it was really tasty.  I'll definitely make this again.

This was a great take on a recipe my mom used to make, only she did it sans broccoli and celery.  I loved the addition of the veggies, but I did leave out the mushrooms and water chestnuts.  We thought it was delicious, my only complaint was that it could have used more spices.  Next time I will definitely up the garlic, pepper, salt, and paprika.

I made this recipe for dinner last evening....I'm sorry to say but it was possibly the worst casserole I have every made. Literally threw it out after 2 bites. Would NOT recommend this to anyone.

Boring.  I made this with a few substitutes - had to use mixed veggies instead of broccoli, used one can cream of mushroom and one can cream of celery instead of the only one can of soup called for in the recipe, and used a corn flake topping moistened with some margarine.  First of all, I cannot imagine making this with only one can of soup - it would have been much too dry.  I had to also use much more cheese than the recipe called for, and it still was not enough.  I just wasn't a fan of this recipe.  My kids and husband thought it was ok, but I will not be making it again. I was looking for something to do with some leftover chicken when I came across this recipe, but it was just boring. It was sort of like chicken a la king all mixed together. I guess I just don't agree with the high ratings the other reviewers have given this recipe. By no means am I picky or a gourmet, but I still was just not a fan of this recipe.

I do not like giving bad reviews but this bland recipe is just not worth the incredible effort.  I will stick with the recipes that use uncooked rice and chicken.

One reviewer said that curry might add some flavor and if I ever have leftover chicken and rice, I might try that.  However, I doubt this will be made again in my house.

This was a pleasant surprise. I wasn't sure how it would all taste together, but it was a hit with both my husband and 7 y.o. We prefer it with a little extra cheese (especially the 7 year old) and next time I will shred the chicken before putting it in the casserole as it seemed a little dry.  Thanks!

I will make this again.  I was worried that it would be mushy...but the texture of the dish was great and even my picky non-broccoli eating teen liked it.  The water chestnuts added a nice crunch.  The reason I gave it a 3 is because I'm not sure I would have liked it if I had not modified it.  Modifications below:   
- reduced butter to 1 tablespoon and added water to browning pan as needed
- used 2 cans cream of chicken instead of the 1 can cream of celery that was called for
- used 1 cup of brown rice cooked in chicken broth...netted out with more than 2 cups of rice I'm sure
- doubled the cheddar cheese
- added 1/2 cup of chuncked velvetta cheese (this left small pockets of creamy cheese to be discovered - yum)
- used fresh mushrooms
- added 2 tablespoons of minced garlic
- added 1 chopped green pepper
- topped with crushed corn flakes 10 mins before baking was complete.

Great way to use leftover rice! I left out the water chestnuts and celery just because I didn't have them on hand. Topped casserole with an additional 1/2 c. of cheese before baking at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.

I have made this on numerous occasions.  But I always omit the water chestnuts (not my favorite).  I also use fresh mushrooms.  There is a lot of prep work involved in this recipe.  But it is one of my favorites.  Even my 2 year old loves it!

This is very good!  Not having cream of celery soup I used cream of broccoli instead.  I also used a small package of frozen chopped broccoli as well as about 2 cups of another frozen vegetable mix - carrots, green beans & corn.  I topped it with cracker crumbs and it was really good - definitely something that you can work with using ingredients you have on hand.

P really liked this.  I think I would have been happier with cream of chicken soup instead of (or even in addition to) celery soup, but it was fine as is.  

I did substitute a little because of what I had on hand.  No mushrooms, 8 oz of water chestnuts instead of 5, and one bonus carrot just for the fun of it.

I was looking for something warm and cozy to cook on a chilly day and this perked my interest so I decided to give it a try....I thought this turned out pretty good and I'd probably make it again.  I did change a few things tho ---  I left out the water chestnuts & mushroom because I dont care for them...I also seasoned the chicken before I cooked it.  It was good.

We love this recipe!  My mom has made this one for years, and now I cook it for my family.  We leave out the celery and water chestnuts and add more meat and broccoli.  Anyway you do it, it still tastes great.  Nice and easy, it's one of our comfort foods (and a great way to use up leftover chicken or turkey).

I don't agree with all the rave reviews for this recipe has received.  I used one can of cream of celery and one can cream of mushroom (many reviewers agreed the dish was dry) and I can't imagine it with only one can of soup.  The taste was very bland and though my husband and I ate the meal we won't be making it again as it didn't have much flavor.  Sorry.

I took the advice of others and added 2 cans of soup (1 cream of celery and 1 cream of mushroom).  I also omitted the water chestnuts.  My only complaint is that this recipe required quite a bit of prep work.  Overall, very good though.

Great kid-friendly taste, and easy to make, to boot!  Can eliminate the water chestnuts if you don't have them... celery (which is also called for) is often a substitute for water chestnuts.

This was good for a one-pot dish.  It does take some preparation, between pre-cooking the chicken and the rice, so it would work well if you have leftovers to use.

Excellent dish!  Very colorful!  As usual, I made a few changes.  Omitted the step of sauteeing in butter (omitted it entirely to save fat and calories) and sauteed in a little water flavored with Butter Buds.  Also, added 1/2 of a green pepper - chopped for extra color and another flavor.  Used cream of mushroom instead of celery soup as there was already quite a bit of celery in the dish.  Added a jar of well-drained pimientos for more color (made a big difference in eye appeal).  Added 1/2 tsp. of Mrs. Dash which I love and used cheese that had only 50% fat.  Topped it off with fresh soft bread crumbs moistened with a little heart-healthy margariine.  Thanks, Sherry for sharing your family's recipe.  Maybe the next person to inherit it will add pimientos!!!!

This was really good. I added a can of cream of mushroom in addition to the cream of celery, and am glad b/c I think it might be too dry w/o it. I also used a broccoli/cauliflower mix b/c that's what I had in the freezer. And then (stupid me, lol) I forgot to put in the chicken!! My son woke from his nap as I was prepping it, and I forgot to cook and stir in the chicken. It was good even w/o it. I topped it w/shredded cheddar and breadcrumbs - yum! My 18 month old had TWO plates of it! I will definitely make this again. i will try it with chicken and also I think I'll try adding ground turkey or ground beef instead of chicken. Great recipe!! Edited to add that I used brown rice also.

I found this receipe to be better than I though as I assembled ingredients.  I did modify it slightly in that I wanted some extra cheese on top of the casserole just for a finishing touch.

I made it just as described in the recipe, except I used double the cheese. I bought a two cup package of shredded cheddar, mixed one cup into the mixture like the recipe says, then sprinkled the rest on top.

Next time I would add another chicken breast (I used two), another cup of rice, another can of cream of celery/mushroom/chicken, and some pepper. I would also just mix the other cup of cheese into the mixture instead of sprinkling it on top. 

Good food. I like it. Make sure you have a big skillet (it's a lot to pack in one skillet).

I used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of celery and it turned out great.  I left out the chicken and mushrooms - still delicious!   Sprinkle cheese on top before you bake for an extra cheesy flavor.   I like this recipe because it uses shredded cheddar rather than pasteurized cheese and it was still creamy.

Wonderful base recipe. I know some other users get annoyed when people rate according to how it turned out with changes that have been made to the recipes but I actually enjoy that part of this site. That being said, I made this using fresh broccoli, omitted the water chestnuts and used cream of mushroom bc that's what I had on hand. I always season to my family's palate so I added crushed red pepper flakes and other seasonings to kick it up and topped it with seasoned bread crumbs. Will be making again.

I did change the recipe a bit.  Instead of garlic powder, I used 6 to 7 cloves chopped fresh garlic.  Also sautéed the garlic and onions in olive oil (not butter).  Two cans cream of chicken was used and about 1.5 lbs boneless/skinless chicken breast.

Good comfort food - I had to do some tweaking.How anyone can make this with just one can of soup I don't know how - there just isn't enough - so I started with the cream of celery as it calls for but when I could see there wasn't near enough, even with the broth, I  had a cream of chicken in the pantry and used that also.  First I sauteed onions, celery in half of the butter, only 2 tablespoons as I used a non-stick fry pan and added the canned mushrooms (not a favorite of canned) but this gave them extra flavor.  I did use the water chestnuts, which I chopped, added a nice crunch.  I also followed the recipe and used frozen broccolli - which in the end product all but disappeared into the casserole - next time I will use fresh broccoli chopped for better color - I also had to increase the broth to 1/2 cup + .  For added seasoning I added seasoning salt and several dashes poultry seasoning.  I also used more cooked chicken.  Makes a nice full 11 x 13 casserole.  I topped mine with Progresso bread crumbs for a crunchy topping which I sprayed with pam-type spray.  Baked tip bubbly and topping was slightly browned.  I thought it  was good - nothing to write home about - good use of leftover chicken which I often have as I cook a whole bird several times a month for the extra meat.  I think the fresh broccoli will add more flavor and color - it's a bit bland looking.  My husband enjoyed it as well

Everything about this recipe cried out "Fantastic!  Why didn't I think of that?"  I used 4c. cubed chicken breast for my meat-loving family, fresh cooked broccoli, no mushrooms (just didn't seem to "go") or water chestnuts, then added 3/4 c. plain Greek yogurt and 1/2 c. total chicken broth (because it was dry, as other reviewers noted).  I did NOT add extra cheese, as I have been trying to cut back on fat in my cooking.  Well, long story short, the dish was pretty bland and disappointing, especially after all that prep.  I think I've narrowed the problem down to the chicken.  There was so much of it and it was unseasoned.  And fresh garlic is the missing ingredient.  I'm giving 4 stars because the recipe has so much promise - but it ain't there yet, in my kitchen.

Good comfort food. I added 1 tbsp dijon mustard to the casserole before baking as previous readers said it was bland. Hubby & I both enjoyed. Will make again. Would also be great with any cream soup - chicken, broccoli or mushroom.

Very good, used fresh cooked broccoli and mushrooms.  Only change I would make would be to add some almonds for some extra crunch, it would just finish it off nicely.

Sorry, but this was not a winner in our house. It seemed to need more rice & soup, and less broccoli.

I made this tonight and loved it. I'm snowed in (which is unusual in the south) so omitted and substituted as follows: no onions, no celery, cream of mushroom instead of cream of celery soup, no water chestnuts. We also were super hungry and not making any sides to go along with this so we added a full pound of chicken, 3 cups of rice, and approximately 1/3 cup chicken broth. It turned out wonderfully, we wouldn't change ANYTHING!!! Thanks SO much for this recipe, we will DEFINITELY make this again! :-)

My family loved this recipe -- it was very easy and great for a cold evening meal. I added peas rather than broccoli, and used fresh garlic when I cooked the chicken. I also added some pepper and lots of garlic powder for flavor. Yummy!

This was really good. I used fresh mushrooms and cream of mushroom soup, instead of celery and cream of celery soup.  I also used left over chickeny chickeny rice that I had in the fridge.

It's great recipe for light and delicious meal! I have made it several time since I discovered it. I always use fresh mushrooms and instead of 2 stalks celery I add 1 small root celery (chopped). And my boyfriend also love it!

I left out the mushrooms and water chesnuts and I think it did away with a lot of the flavor...it was still pretty good though!!  I also sprinkled cheese on top.

My husband and I loved this recipe. My husband hardly ever tries new recipes and I was so excited when he actually said it is now one of his favorites.  I shared it with both of our families and it was a big hit!

This tasted kinda boring.  THe water chestnuts are an odd addition.  Would suggest leaving that out, and adding another can of cream of something, otherwise it's a little dry.

Hubby really liked this one!  After reading the other reviews, the changes I made were: used leftover turkey instead of chicken, added 2 cans of soup (I used cream of mushroom), and sprinkled extra shredded cheese on top.

A previous reviewer said that the recipe called for 5 oz of water, but never said when to use it.  Actually, the recipe calls for a 5 oz can of "water chestnuts" (drained), not water, and it does tell you where to use it.

This is a keeper. I used brown rice, fresh mushrooms, and two cans of soup. We like casseroles juicier. My husband just kept eating and eating. Thanks Sherry

Not one of my favorites, although it was good for using up leftover chicken, rice and broccoli.  The flavor was just kind of bland and not something I would make again.  Good idea, just not a "yummy" dinner.

This was a great recipe. One for those days of "What am I going to cook for dinner..?"  My family likes all the ingredients and therfore really enjoyed it.  I would add any spices that you like, I added ground sage and just a dash of cayenne pepper just to give it a lift.  I'm putting this one in my recipe box.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a good, every day recipe for a family meal (or a church supper).  It reminds me in terms of flavor and crunch of chicken chow mein.  It would be good with crunchy noodles or onion rings on top.
