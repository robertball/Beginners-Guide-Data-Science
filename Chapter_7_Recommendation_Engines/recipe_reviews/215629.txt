Very yummy!  I used two mangos because I like it sweet and spicy.

I made baked chicken last night with a yogurt sauce that really needed a perky side to go with. This answered that problem very nicely. Easy, simple ingredients, and if more heat was needed you could easily add another jalepeno.  I did not and it was very tasty with the chicken. We wiped out the remainder with chips watching the game.  Excellent! Thank you for sharing!!

This was super simple and really delicious.  I served this over crab cakes, to die for combo!  I forgot I had no jalapenos, so I added a touch of mongolian fire oil for a little heat & used red and green pepper for a pretty presentation.  I'll use this recipe many more times.  Thank you for sharing this.

Being seriously desperate for a taste of summer, I indulged myself with this recipe. I had bought a case of mangoes last summer and frozen some of it - this recipe was a perfect way to use some up :D Delicious, but a little too tart for me. I added a bit of sugar to balance it out, but next time would add the lime juice just to taste.

This had great flavor and tasted very fresh.  I made as is with the addition of 1 tablespoon orange juice and about 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro.  The juiced lime equalled about 2 tablespoons.  I served with cilantro lime rice and fish tacos.  Yum!

Very good and easy to make.  I added about 2 tablespoons of cilantro and think it added flavor & dimension to this salsa.  Also I did not have a jalapeno, so I diced up 1 habanero pepper minus any seeds...and it was spicy, still not too hot!

OMG this was AWESOME!  Made it with spicy shrimp, fantastic!  Had a wine and cheese party the next night and served it with hot Camembert cheese on sliced baguette...to die for.  Had multiple requests for the recipe!  Used white onion diced instead of green because that is what I had...wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks for this great recipe!

I love fruit in my salad and the burst of freshness that mango gives to this is fantastic. I had made another mango salsa a few days, but I like the use of green onions in this which gives a taste similar to onions without the feel in the mouth of eating raw onions.

It turned out great!! Very colorful and tasty! Didn't add the jalapeÃ±o because my family doesn't like spicy but next time I'll make a separate bowl for me and add it.  Great and simple recipe, thanks for sharing!!

It was very tart for my taste. I make a killer Mango pico de gallo. When I saw that this had vinegar and lime I was thinking too much acidity and it was. I would leave out the vinegar altogether.

This was a complete success; I did add some tomato to suit m personal taste but it was fantastic as written. The recipe is great to give you the base you need and you can add/subtract to suit yourself.

Followed recipe exactly and served as a side it with salmon loaf.  The flavors of the salsa perked up the flavors in the salmon loaf.

I made it according to the recipe, and we all loved it. We serve it with fish and a side of rice.
