This is wonderful. I used coconut oil, sesame crackers, breadcrumbs and almonds on top because that is what I had and it still turned out great. I did precook the squash in the microwave to speed up the  process.

Very good dish, and not overly sweet; made as written. Other recipes like this call for 1/2 cup sugar or more versus 1/4 cup for this one. For the ‘1/2 cup cracker crumbs’, used 12 Ritz crackers. The nut topping, with sunflower seeds included, gives this a nice twist from the norm. While using the specified amount of butter, next time might reduce it slightly to say 3 tablespoons. A good choice for a Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner, especially if lots of sweet stuff is already in the planned food choices. Thank you emoon.

If you take this to a pot luck dinner, you'll be overwhelmd by the requests for the  recipe. I didn't have crackers so I used crushed potato chips.

My husband and I both love this recipe. The mayo and onion make it different from the typical sweet squash casseroles, aand give it a velvety texture as well. I'm making it for the third time tonight.

Delicious! Loved this.  It was great.  I used 1 whole package of Ritz crackers and used a lot more butter 1/2 cup when drizzling over them. I also used a whole onion. The nuts on top are so different and unusual but taste yummy.  Loved it and so did the family!

We found this to be way too rich, even after doubling the squash. If I were to make it again I'd probably still double the squash and also halve the mayonnaise and omit the sugar. The topping was very good though. The only change I made to that was swapping the sunflower seeds for chopped pumpkin seeds.

My mother made this for my wedding and so many people requested this recipe, even my mother in law! It's now my go to dish for the holidays. Last time I made this I forgot to buy sunflower seeds which I thought was always my favorite part.. It was just as good without! I always precook the squash and mash it before combining it with the other ingredients.

Used panko crumbs, pecans and pumpkin seeds.  I think you could use any nuts and seeds.  I used two Tbl of dried onion flakes.

This was impressive. It really messes with your mind though. I kept thinking it was sweet like sweet potato casserole but when you try it it's more like a cheesy potato casserole. Once I got my mind wrapped around it I really liked it! My changes to the recipe we're to use the low fat version of mayonnaise and eggs (aka egg whites). I will be making this again. I may grind the crackers and nuts a little finer to resemble crumbs instead of the pecan topping on sweet potato casserole. thanks for sharing!

This recipe has become our family favourite.  My family now requests it for all of our get togethers.  I would suggest doing the recipe if you want to make a 9 x 13" pan.  if you make the recipe as written, then I would use an 8 x 8" pan.  This recipe can easily be made gluten free by using gluten free bread crumbs or crushed potato chips.

I made this with half the butter, half the sugar, and olive oil mayo which cut the calories significantly without sacrificing any of the diverse flavors in this dish.  A great meal for my vegetarian family - even my 4th grader liked it.

This is a great recipe.  I modified it, only because I didn't have sunflower seeds.  So I used twice as many pecans.  My husband said he could've had it as a main course.  Oh, I also used a whole butternut squash which was more than 2 cups.

I didn't measure the squash very closely and doubled the pecans. The 1/2 cup butter was more than needed but it certainly tasted great. I will make this again and double it for my 9 x 12 pan as this recipe is for a smaller 8 x 8 dish.

Still a favorite all these years since I first posted this, and went on to become a certified Chef. Sweet onions are definately better. For those that believe this is too rich...the mayo is simply made with soy or vegetable oil and it repalces the butter you might normally see in a recipe, but with the vinegar in it it adds a differrent flavor. And yes, when I make ithis recipe as a diabetic, I substitute a sugar free alternative and it still tastes fabulous and so easy to tweak!

I followed recipe to a tee. I peeled and cubed squash, Then  steamed it in the microwave for about 10 minutes. I used a hand potato masher and mashed it coarsely. This is a awesome savory dish. Definitely a keeper and can't wait to make it again for my guest.

Delicious!  So good I had two servings of leftovers for brunch today -  cold.  I may even like it better than when it was hot.  I did not have sunflower seeds and used a bit less sugar.  I used Ritz Crackers.   It came out very good looking and I would be proud to take it / serve it anywhere anytime.  See my photo with the red potholders - fresh out of the oven.  I am a beginner cook, age 70 lol, and this is the dish I am most proud of so far.

I enjoyed it.  Substituted sliced almonds for the seeds/nuts because it's what I had.  Measured the sugar a little lean.  Think I'll be sure to use a sweet onion next time because the yellow onion was a little strong. I'll likely put the onion in the blender because the kids (7 and 4yrs) really liked their first bite, but I think the texture turned them off.  I was so glad to find a squash recipe that didn't sound like a dessert... most of them have a whole cup of sugar... sounds more like pie or a dessert to me.

This was REALLY good.  It was simple and filling. I skimped on the mayo and used brown sugar.  I will make it again for sure.  It would pair great with ham or take it to a pot luck.  I used a few extra nuts/seeds as well.
