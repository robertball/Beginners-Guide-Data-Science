This is a very delicious loaf of quick bread! I did have to make substitutions on the add ins because I didn't have what was called for in the recipe. I used 1/2 cup of chopped dates, 1/2 cup chopped pecans & 1/2 cup coconut. This bakes up beautifully. It's moist, delicious and not too sweet. I will definately be making this again.

Wonderful recipe! The only things I did different was.... I used butter not margarine and cooked it in 3 little pans for about 40 minutes..

Very easy recipe, unfortunately I didn't have the raisins or the almonds so baked with double the fruit mix.  I also needed to cook for another 5-10 minutes longer past the hour - but it was all good.  Got rave reviews.  Thank you for sharing!

this is an awesome recipe.  recalculated so that the servings were for 20 and made mini loafs.  just enough for 2-3 people without leftovers (per loaf).  the taste was excellent.  definately will be making this recipe again

Very good fruit loaf. Only thing I didn't like was the overpowering taste of almonds, due, I think to the almond essence. Next time I'll use vanilla essence instead. The fresh ground almonds, on the other hand, added a nice touch.

I would have rated this 5 stars if it wasn't so dry.
