This was good, I added a can of black beans (drained) at the end.  And also stored in some brown rice.  Very tasty, better the next day for lunch.

Turned out surprisingly delicious! (I was just using leftovers) I used boca burger instead of chicken.

Very good! I was skeptical that there would be enough flavor but the cilantro and lime really added a lot. I'll definitely make this again!

Pretty good for a quick dinner.. I added chopped onion and a bit of cayenne pepper for more spiciness.

I made this soup last night for my family for the first time. Every one raved about it. There was none left over. This is one great soup. I will make this the next time we have a family gathering.

Yummy! I'd add onions and maybe a bit of chili flakes next time to amp up the spice, but really flavourful otherwise. The lime added such a fun element of zesty flavour.

Very easy to make quick and satifying flavor. I added some onion and used a fresh clove of garlic.
