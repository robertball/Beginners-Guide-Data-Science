This is THE only way I will make burgers. They are juicy, flavorfull, and even have a sort of creamy texture.  They fall apart on the grill so be carful. I make the mixture the night before so the flavors have time to meld.  The first time I made these my friend, after devouring it in no time at all,  told me to tell his wife the recipe. I like to melt swiss cheese on top. This is always a hit with my guests when I make them.

These are FANTASTIC! ~~~Yummmmm~~~ I did keep them in a ball overnight so the flavors would savor. My family & friends couldn't get enough of them & devoured every one. Thanks this is a super duper recipe. I didn't have any problem with mine falling thru the grate, maybe because I left them in a big ball after mixing & let set overnite

What a yummy burger!! I was looking for something different but still simple to do to hamburgers for camping and this is the new favorite!! Simple ingredients and a moist and flavorful burger!! No sauces needed!

They freeze well but don't cook up quite as moist. I add a little extra sour cream if I am gonna freeze them.

I am not the best griller, so I was a little hesitant to try something like this, but now I'm so glad I did. I cooked the patties on my little charcoal grill and these burgers didn't dry out at all. They had the great flavor from the grill and the tasty kick of the onion mix. Plus they didn't dry out at all. Definitely will be making these again!

WOW, great recipe! Juice tasty burgers every time! Make sure not to forget the breadcrumbs (as I did the second time I made this recipe) or they will fall through the grill grates.  Well done!

Not too shabby.  I mixed the ingredients  the night before, left out the breadcrumbs, and cooked them on a gas grill.  We lost one through the grate but the rest were pretty good.  I used ground turkey and low fat sour cream and it seemed to work with the recipe.  It just isn't as good as our usual burger mix.  Not bad to switch things up though.

This is our favorite burger recipe.  I mix the onion soup mix with the sour cream before adding it to the meat.  I also make the burgers the night before to allow the flavors to meld.  Incredibly juicy even if you use lower fat beef.

Very tender and moist. I do recommend letting it sit in the fridge for longer then recipe instructs. I added sauteed mushrooms with swiss cheese. One of the best burgers I'd had in a long time. Will definitely make again.

These turned out excellent!  Super moist and tender.  I will experiment with other spices and flavors along with the sour cream next time.

First of all, these were very tasty, but very wet.  I could see that the mixture was wet, so I decided to make this as meatballs instead of patties, hoping they would have a better chance of staying together.  Even as meatballs, they completely fell apart.  So I added them into a marinara sauce, and they completely enhanced the flavor of the sauce, so it was still quite good.  Finally, I will admit that I added in a packet of ranch dressing (something I had seen in a previous recipe), and I think that really made this recipe.  If I make this again, I think I will use oatmeal instead of bread crumbs (may help to keep their shape), or more meat, or both.

I followed the ingredients as is and it was perfect.  Just make sure you refrigerate for a least an hour so they meat firms up.  I'm always bored of burgers when I have to make them for the hubby but I really enjoyed this recipe..

I made these for a tailgate and a barbecue - and they were a hit each time.  I followed the recipe exactly and had no texture problems.  One time I pressed the patties are refrigerated overnight, and the other time I pressed them and grilled them immediately - they stayed together and came out wonderful either way.  These will definitely be a summer staple at our house.

One of the juiciest burgers I've eaten (given that I don't usually eat beef)! The right amount of spices and super tender! I scaled down recipe for my 1.3 lb package of ground beef. Used one whole package of dry onion soup mix (for ease), 1/2 cup of Italian style bread crumbs, and low fat sour cream. Made five patties. Highly recommend!

Need more bread crumbs to hold it together or an egg. I'd leave out the sour cream and throw in seasoning salt and worcertershire sauce or montrel seasoning steak sauce

It was allright, made more than enough.  It was oniony, just like I expected but next time I will use ranch mix instead of the onion soup mix for an extra zip of flavor. Topped it with slightly melted swiss cheese and raw yellow onion.

Awesome. I double recipe for large gathering and got rav reviews. Another time I made them I used ranch dip pack instead of onion soup mix and used the excess that I didn't use for burgers and made a meatloaf.  Best ever meatloaf! As others did I added more sour cream when freezing.

I scaled back the french onion mix by half, and I added a small boiler onion, finely chopped, it turned out great! Also add some worcestershire if you have it on hand, it really makes it yummy! Great recipe, never would have thought to add sour cream on my own, but it's perfect!

These are very good.  I think there is something wrong with my grill, bc it took forever for them to cook.  I also halved the recipe but failed to halve the onion soup mix.  My fault.  Bf commented it was a bit overpowering, but otherwise liked them.  Made my own soup mix from a recipe on recipezaar.  Thanks!

This is meatloaf on a bun.  I added some parm. cheese and catsup to the mixure as one here suggested.  Still, meatloaf on a bun.  It did not fall apart when cooking, but still, meatloaf on a bun.  We probably won't make this again.  Not really like a hamburger.

I paired this recipe with the Honey Wheat Sandwich Rolls recipe and the combination was f-a-n-t-a-s-t-i-c!  Very flavorful hamburgers.  Will try the suggestion of mixing this up a day ahead to let the flavors mesh next time.

SO juicy! These turned out so good and so flavorful. I even made these with ground turkey since I can't have beef and they were just delicious. Can't wait to make these again.

**EDIT:  Even though I cut this recipe in half because there is only two of us, I still use the whole envelope of dry soup mix and if I don't have soup mix, I use onion dip mix.

I didn't change a thing and the burgers were delicious. I only left it in the fridge for 30-45 minutes because I was starving. Next time I will plan ahead and leave it in there longer.

Oh YUM!  I made them with a combination of lean ground turkey & ground sirloin.  I made the patties and let them chill out in the fridge for a few hours.  Be sure the grill is lightly oiled and hot, because of their tender consistency they may crumble.  I will make this often.

These were really good. My fiancee doesnt like reheated burgers (for work) but he said these tasted fresh still since they were so moist! The only downfall that I had was that they were almost TOO moist. As I tried to shape the patties and fry them, they were falling apart. I think that I will just use a little less sour cream next time. But they do taste even better after the mix has sat in the fridge for a couple hours!!! Great recipe!!

SO GOOOOOOOOOOD! 

Made them at a BBQ and everyone was impressed. They are delicious and now this is the ONLY way I make my burgers. Make sure not to put to much onion soup mix or they get a weird flavor.

I made this for dinner tonight and like suggested, I made it in the morning so the flavors would blend. while it was a very moist burger I thought the onion soup was to overpowering. My hubby who eats anything didn't care for it.

This was the most bland recipe for a burger that I have ever tasted. I was looking so foward to it by the reviews and was so disappointed, along with my 7 guests. I followed the recipe to the "T" and it just didn't measure up.  Maybe with some Sauted onions or somethig but this recipe is not what it is cracked up to be.

It is so funny when you see a recipe in Allrecipes that you have been making for years but got from somewhere else.  I have been making my hamburgers almost exactly like this - - the exception is I add a little ketchup and parmesan cheese in with the other ingredients.  The sour cream and onion soup mix gives the taste of "Onion Dip" to the burgers.  So moist, so yummy!

It was just okay. It left me wanting more, and that's not in a good way. Was a little too salty even with only using half a package of the soup mix - don't even want to go there with a full package! Wouldn't make again - better off with just plain burgers and it's not worth the effort.

from all the reviews i thought our family would be over the moon for these burgers. they were good but just not what we expected. They were falling apart by the time they were done, and the flavor was just alright. Definatly need more breadcrumbs or maybe and egg to try and keep these burgers together. Also i suggest if you do make these to mix the soup mix with the sourcream to sofen the onion soup mix a bit. I think I will stick to my usual burger recipe without dumping sour cream in them. I give this 4 stars for the flavor. If the burgers would have stayed together then it would have been a 5 star.

These burgers were moist, flavorful and easy to prepare; however, they were SO moist they fell apart.  Next time I make this recipe (yes, it's saved to my faovrites), I'll cut the sour cream to 1/2 cup and prepare them ahead of time.  All-in-all, the kids enjoyed them so it's all good to me.

These were fantastic!! I don't eat homemade burgers but I LOVE these!! My whole family thought they were great.  I left out the soup mix & just seasoned them because my kids are really picky about "crunchy stuff" in their food & as recommended by another reviewer, I made them the day before so the flavors could blend. I have told everyone I know how good these were. I've made them twice in 2 weeks!!

This was very good, just not excellent. The texture is more like meatloaf, but that is what I needed because my 19 year old had just had his wisdom teeth out a week before. The taste was very good also.

I really enjoyed this. Great because I always have these items on hand so I can easily make this when I don't know what to do for dinner. Great alternative to a plain burger with lots of flavor. Not a huge fan of beef burgers but this was great. I used extra lean ground beef and light sour cream with whole wheat buns to making it a little healthier. Usually the extra lean meat isn't as good for burger making but the ingredients added to it make it more tender and juicy.

This was just ok for me. I don't regret trying the recipe, I just probably won't make it again, at least not without adding more spices. The sour cream taste was very mild. It did put a different spin on the traditional burger, and it was fun trying!

I found the burgers to be very flavorful, however I did not like the consistency of the burger was too mushy. I think it may have been due to too many bread crumbs.

Won over the taste buds of people who like most of their foods "plain."  I'm new in the family and they were being polite allowing me to cook burgers that night, and eat them.  Raised eyebrows and sincere "ymmm" all around! Thanks for sharing.

I changed this recipe a bit since my family doesn't like burgers that taste like meatloaf.  I eliminated the bread crumbs, and only used 1/2 of the onion soup mix.  I only used 1 pound of hamburger (turkey & chicken burger works great too!) instead of 3 pounds.  Once I made these adjustments, I couldn't believe how good the results were!  Now, these are the only burgers I will make!  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Hi guys! Found this and just had to let you know, this is my meatloaf recipe! With a little tweaking, ie: add some milk, more/less bread crumbs/meat. It's great. Use fattier meat and stir the dripings into some brown gravy (I use the McCormick packets), serve w/ home fries or mashed potatoes. YUM!

I cut this recipe in half because only my husband and I were eating.  Normally we don't like "stuff" added to our burger - but we thought we'd give this a shot.  In the end, I couldn't taste the sour cream, really the only flavour was the onion soup mix.  The burgers were difficult to work with because they were so moist and one of them fell apart on the BBQ.  We thought these were ok....but probably won't make them again.

I made this for Father's Day and it was a huge hit, everyone loved them.  They were so moist and juicy, great with sauted onions.

The only thing is I don't think they were better fresh, then if you froze them.

These burgers were ok. You must be a meatloaf fan to really like them. They can fall all apart if you are not carfull. My husband ate 2 he thought they were good.

WOW!  This was totally awesome!  I can't believe how delicious these were, prepared exactly as called for in the recipe, and used potato roll buns.  We used a Foreman Grill too, and these come out PERFECT when you evenly divide the meat out to make 8 patties and cook for 5 minutes. We will definitely make these often in the future!

Made these for my son's third birthday. They were a hit. I made one burger added some cheese in the middle than made another burger a mushed them together. They where a fair size burger. Would double the recipe to get more burgers next time.

I lost half the meat on the grill when it oozed through the grates. The remaining meat I cooked in a pan. The flavor was onion-y but the texture was mushy and very off-putting.

I made this recipe because burgers are not my best. But these came out great. I added a tsp of garlic powder and one egg to make sure the burgers stayed put. I was worried, but the minute I sat the burgers down, my friends devoured them. These burgers are very moist and taste great. Five stars from my friends and me.

We loved these burgers.  They will be my "go to" burgers from now on.  They are easy and flavorful.  I followed the recipe but I added 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire and my husband brushed them with same when he put them on the grill.

My family loves these burgers. They will be our go to burger recipe for sure, from here on out. They are moist and flavorful and don't fall apart. They also freeze wonderfully. 
So happy I tried this recipe. The sour cream seemed a little strange but they are soooo good!

I made this recipe for a BBQ to try something different than the average burger. Those of us that had a burger agreed that while the flavor was okay, the texture was just wrong. I would not describe this as juicy. I would describe it as soft and mushy. If I hadn't made them myself, I would have thought they weren't even beef. If you are thinking about trying this recipe, I would start with a family meal before trying for a group BBQ. I will not be making this recipe again.

I love the idea of sour cream in the burger.  I never would have thought of that on my own.  I didn't have soup mix, but I had a .07 ounce package of garlic onion spice dip mix that I used. (I made a burger once with soup mix and did not care for it anyway).  Delicious! But, 4 stars because it is a little mushy.  Maybe more bread crumbs next time, as other reviewer have suggested.  I used Muenster cheese and topped it with a generous slice of avocado.  Yumm yumm!

Best Burger I've ever made- I don't think I can go back to a regular burger. It helps them from falling apart on the grill if they're really cold when you start grilling them and have a large spatula to turn them.

This was very good and it was moist not dry. Even the fussiest of eaters liked them. The only thing I would do different is leave out the onion mix on a batch for those who cannot eat or do not like onions. This is going on my favorite list.

I used to make a very similar recipe, but now that I have found this one, I make it all the time! It's so good and my family just loves it. It's best to handle the meat as little as possible, let it cool for a while in the fridge before you grill it so the patties can blend their flavors and hold their shape on the grill.  They taste even better the next day if you can wait that long.

This was the BEST tasting hamburger i had had in a LONG time.  The right amount of onion flavor and the sour cream made them moist.  We had fries to go along with them.  We would make these again! 2 thumbs up defintely! We halfed the recipe and it made 6 good sized burgers.

Nice and tasty burgers, but had a little difficulty keeping them together while cooking, so maybe a bit more bread crumbs would help this, overall, very flavorful.

these burgers melt in your mouth! so tender and juicy. we had ours on sliced and broiled olive bread with just a touch of dijon mustard. simple and fabulous. i can imagine adding some bright flavor like diced green chiles. really whatever you like. however, this will be my base recipe from now on for sure.

WOW!  This was a GREAT burger!  I made a couple changes (not intentional tho!).  I wanted to try this recipe so bad tonight for dinner but didn't have any bread crumbs....so I dug through the cupboard and substituted some crushed Garlic & Butter Croutons.  I also topped them with swiss cheese since it was the only kind on hand!  So basically I was ill prepared but  "WOW!"  was the most used word at the dinner table tonight!  When we have burgers, THIS is how I will do them for the rest of my cookin days!  Thanks for sharing!!!

Hmm, For some reason this recipe caught my eye.  Honestly, my family was not pleased nor was I.  Wish I passed.

These burgers are very good, although I did take the advice of some of the others and I left out 1/2 of the cream cheese. I liked the texture of them much better. I also added about 1/4 of a cup more bread crumbs. This recipe is a keeper. Thanks for sharing LAB1

This was ok not the best.  I kept checking to see if my burger was done because it had a weird consistency to it.  My dad was doing the same.  I think that it would have been better if the sour cream was cut in half.  I might try it again with this modification but not any time soon.

This recipe is a keeper. I used ground angus beef. Instead of crumbs I put approx 5 oz of club crackers into a freezer bag and crushed them with a small rolling pin. The burgers were very goooooood. The next time I have my kids and grandkids out for hambergers this is what I am going to serve. Enjoy

I read the reviews and mixed it this morning and cooked it for dinner. It's rainy so I cooked them in the electric skillet and they turned out great but I thought the dry mix made them a little too salty. I might try 1/2 the powder next time, or come up with my own spices. So far, the family's favorite burger is the BBQ Feta and Hot Banana Pepper Turkey Burgers and that's what they ask for.

Moist tasty burger. I was surprised how good these were and I had expected less just from the ingredients. I cooked these stovetop, but I'm sure they would have been a lot tastier on the charcoal grill. I'll make this again. Thanks!

Overall, I liked these.  They were very moist, so the patties tended to fall apart.  My husband said the onion flavor was too overpowering, but he is the type that likes just beef burgers with salt and pepper; anything else and he says it starts to taste like meatloaf.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made these burgers for my daughter's birthday celebration, they were a huge hit! My Dad loves nothing better than a good burger, and he ended up gratefully taking the leftovers home. I did not make any changes and will be making these again!

Good, juicy burgers. I added a teaspoon of ranch dressing to the sour cream. They do tend to fall apart easily. Next time I'll let the mix sit in the fridge overnight before forming the patties as suggested by some. Grilling these burgers also requires one's undivided attention; I was distracted by my grandson for a couple of moments and returned to find quite a flare up.

After seeing all the reviews that said this was "meatloafy"--I was a bit hesitant to make.  I finally gave in and thought we'd try them.  One word...FAB-U-LOUS!!!!  This had to be the most juicy, moist burger I've ever had.  The texture was wonderful and they tasted fantastic.  I used onion/mushroom dry soup mix b/c that's all I had.  I didn't think it had a meatloaf taste AT ALL and they stayed together just fine.  Thanks for sharing!

Flavor was just o'k. All the sour cream did was give the burgers a tendency to fall apart towards the end of cooking.

This burger were very good and moist. I did make a couple of changes. After reading the reviews I cut the sour cream in half. Glad I did because you could taste the sour cream with it being to over powerful. Also I used the Copy Cat Lipton Onion Soup because it was all I had. This one is a keeper.

Loved these burgers.  Altered recipe to make two servings and they turned out fantastic.  Moist, flavourful and very easy to prepare.  Grilled them on convection in my toaster oven for 6 mins. each side and they were perfect. Husband thanked me three times for the great lunch! A definate keeper.

After reading some problems that others had with this recipe I did a little prempt tweaking and the burgers turned out amazing.  Major props to the original author because I would have never thought to put sour cream in my burger mix and now I will never make them without.
So what I changed ... 
the comments about the onion soup mix being too salty, I used a sieve and separated the packet and only used about 1/4 of the powder/seasoning.
comments about too moist and falling apart - I busted up a sleeve of Ritz bacon crackers and added those.  (my husbands first comment was "wow did you put bacon in these?!")
I also added about a Tbs of soy sauce.
I didn't have overnight to refrigerate the mix, only about 3 hours.  One thing I did disagree with is taking the meat straight from the frig to the heat.  I always return any protein to room temp (about 20 mins) before cooking so that it cooks evenly and doesn't dry out, although I know not everyone believes in doing that.
btw I forgot to take a pic of them hot, so my picture is of the lone left over that I quickly wrapped and hid in the fridge so the hubs couldn't eat it as a midnight snack.

no changes except I made my own onion soup mix.  I fed these burgers to two head chefs from Germany.  They loved them.  No issues having them stay together or anything.  These are a hit with our family for sure.

These were delicious!!  They were really juicy and packed a lot of flavor.  The only thing I did different was to add a whole egg since there were so many comments about them falling apart.  I mixed together the sour cream, bread crumbs, onion mix and egg, then added the hamburger.  I let them sit in the fridge for a couple of hours before we grilled them but I would think that if we let them sit overnight, they would have been even better....next time!

I made these last week looking for a way to change up the normal burgers we have and these were great!  I cooked them as you should a normal burger and had no problems with them falling apart.  They were tasty and juicy and our boys have let mom know that dad is making burgers from now on.  

I did mod the recipe. I used 36oz (2.25lb) of ground beef and used 1 cup of breadcrumbs.  Other than that, I added what was listed.

This is the only way I'll make burgers from now on! I use ground turkey and lite sour cream and they don't get dry at all. They are so good and have lots of flavor!!

I will definitely be making these burgers again! I am usually terrible at making my own burgers unless I am frying them in a pan. My fiance' said these were the best burgers he had ever had! I did add an egg to help hold them together since some people said they fall apart. Otherwise I followed the recipe to a T. They came out juicy and delicious! Update....we change up the seasonings depending on what we feel like. Tonight we made this recipe adding mexican seasonings instead of the onion soup mix. Still very, very good. The sour cream really makes the burgers juicy!

Followed the recipe completely without changing a thing. Very moist burger which is perfect because I hate dry meat more than anything. The onion flavor isn't very strong so next time I might add a little more. My family loved these!

The taste was ok but it had a bit too much onion soup mix. I think half the amount of onion soup mix would allow for the taste to be balanced.

We really enjoyed these!  I cooked them on the stove, so I had no problems with them falling apart.  I also used panko bread crumbs in the recipe.  They were a little salty for me...probably from the onion soup mix.  Maybe next time I will use only half the package.  But these were simple and tasty!

I added a steak sauce to the mix for added flavor. Topped with swiss and american cheese that I shredded and added bacon crumbs then put on burger to melt. we have always just put sour cream on top of our burgers and that is not the cleanliest method to eat them since we do not eat buns due to the carbs.

I liked it but it was a little *yawn* on flavor which may have been the onion soup mix I used. The next time I will try a brand mix and maybe add a little salt or season salt.

These were fantastic!!  As a matter of fact, I only used 1 lb. of ground beef, but kept the amounts of the rest of the ingredients the same.  They were moist, flavorful and downright delicious.  I broiled these cuz it's freezing winter right now and we don't grill much in the winter; however, I cannot wait to get these on a grill when the weather warms up!  Thanks for the recipe!

These were good. They were exceptionally moist. The only problem I had was that some of the onion soup mix didn't soften up appropriately, so occaisonally there was a "crunch" to the burger. Usually when I make burgers, I add chopped up fresh onions, and I think I will stick with that method rather than the soup method. Otherwise these were good, it had a great flavor and great moist effect.

These were good, but I didn't find them better than a traditional burger with chili sauce or A1 sauce. I don't cook things well done, but more to medium rare, so keeping them moist isn't a problem. If you like it more well done, this is probably a great recipe for you.

you can't change any of the amounts of this recipe.  I only had 1.5 pounds of meat and lost much of my hamburgers to the grill grates.  I won't mess with making these messy burgers again.

these were pretty tasty.  we didn't have any problems with them falling apart.  i think next time, i would use a bit less onion soup mix and i would make them a touch smaller.  otherwise, they were fantastic, very moist.

I thought I would try this recipe because it was a little different with the sour cream. I followed the recipe and didn't make any modifications. The patties were definitely moist, but did not hold together very well on the grill. Would try these burgers again, but will cut down on the sourcream and add a bit more seasoning

I have made this recipe exactly as written for 2 years now and it is the best. The burgers are juicy and sooo tasty, not to mention easy to make. Family and friends ask for it everytime we bar-b-cue. Thanks so much.

I personally thought these were wonderful, but my family didn't like them. If I make them again I would add some spices or herbs to make them more flavorful.

My boyfriend and I didn't like these really at all. They fell apart on the grill. Once we got them off the grill and tasted them the onion flavor was all we could taste.

This is a very moist, meatloafy burger.  It's simple to put together and tastes great!  I was worried that they might fall apart since some people have had problems with that.  So I started with only 1/2 cup of sour cream.  But it was too dry and really needs the full cup.  And luckily mine did not fall apart at all.

These burgers were very good, the only complaint I had was that the onion mix was a little overpowering, but overall an excellent burger.

Did not like this very much.  The onion soup mix was too over powering...would not make this again, sorry.

This was ok.  I guess I'm just not a big fan of onion soup mix in my burgers and neither is my husband.

I did not care for this recipe at all. They fell apart during grilling and just tasted 'blah'. Husband ate two though so I gave it two stars.

These burgers were OK, nothing too special.  They seemed to lack spices.  What they were good for was something super fast and easy though.

I reviewed this a long time ago at 4 stars when I grilled them.  Last night I couldn't grill, so I pan fried them. They are 1000% better.  I prefer grilling, but these were so much better in the frying pan.  The onion soup mixes in with the grease and coats the outside.  This is now my goto burger.

These were excellent.  They remained so moist and delightful.  We've used this recipe every time we've made hamburgers.  Definately a keeper.

This recipe is quick and good.  I wouldn't state that they are outrageous, and perhaps a bit bland.  But they were tasty and moist and I would make them again.

I made these last night for a light dinner with a salad.  They were Excellent!  Since I cooked them on my George Foreman Grill, the flavors were not all there, but I have 8 more and I'm sure the taste will be more robust when I eat the last one!  Since I didn't make them overly large, I was able to make 10 burgers!  Thank you LAB1!!

This was a great burger!  I have been looking for a recipe that keeps the burger moist using the 90% lean hamburger.  This worked very well.

I made one major change to this recipe --  I used turkey instead of beef since I don't eat beef.  It was very good albeit a bit dry since  I used 99% fat free turkey. Next time --  and there will be a next time - I think I will use one with just a bit more fat content.

I omitted the bread crumbs, do not like bread crumbs in my hamburgers.
