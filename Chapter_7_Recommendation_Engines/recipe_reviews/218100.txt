Your Aunt Gert and my Grandmother were genius! My Gram made these as long as I can remember as did my Mom and I have as well....I wait very impatiently for the garden to produce our cuke crop....sure I make them with store bought, but somehow they taste better with our own. I always use sweet Vidalia onions....I could eat the entire bowl...hmmmm, actually I think I do. You will love love love em!

I had a hard time rinsing the salt off, but overall very good.  A nice change of pace from the sweet.  Also there is another recipe on here that calls for 16 oz of sour cream, the 8 oz is perfect amount.  I also like the onions, might do a batch of just onions in the future.

I have been making these for years.  I seed my cukes so I don't need to salt them.  I also like the visual contrast red onion provides.  Thanks, Jan!

I would like to add some herb to it. Something bold but not regretfully overbearing. Any ideas?
