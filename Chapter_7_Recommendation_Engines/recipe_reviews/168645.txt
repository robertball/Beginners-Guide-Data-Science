I only used the recipe as a guide but it worked really well so I'm giving 5 stars for the great combination and unique salad idea. My version: 2 cups cooked brown rice, 1 bunch collard greens (steamed for 10 minutes and chopped into bite sized pieces), 2 diced tomatoes, 1 and 1/2 cups thawed frozen corn, 2 thinly sliced carrots, 1 cup pinto beans, 4 oz can sliced black olives, 2 finely minced cloves of garlic, 1 diced cucumber, squeeze of lemon, salt & pepper. As you can see mine is just a slight variation of the original because I wanted to use up all the odds and ends I had lurking around the fridge. Thanks for a great recipe idea!

This recipe is fantastic!  Little salt and pepper needed to season.  My one change was using frozen peas/corn instead of canned, all else the same and it turned out great.  I only made 1/2 the recipe and it still made a large portion.

This was great! I didn't have canned collard greens, but I had some fresh greens.  So I prepared just enough for the salad.  I used some left over white corn, used black and green olives, (Didn't have any green chiles).  I already had some left over brown rice, used it and mixed everything together and oh my Lord, this was great!  I love collard greens and so does my husband!  This came out so great....and then it hit me, I forgot to add the left over black beans and the Italian tomatoes!  Not to worry, we had some of the salad left over, I'll add these last two ingredients for lunch and really enjoy!  Thank you for this recipe!  I must make this for company when I host another dinner party!  What a wonderful alternative for many items I like!  This salad really rocks!!!!

With a few modifications, this turned out great.  I served it as a warm dish.  I cooked the rice in a rice cooker and then added the other ingredients to the cooker after the rice was done.  I used fresh veggies instead of canned and added cumin and coriander to give it some more flavor.

Prepared as is, this would have been very bland. Except for frozen peas, I used all fresh veggies, and I added beet greens. I also used quinoa, and roasted fresh green chiles. Since I didn't use "Italian style" tomatoes, I added a sauteed onion and a clove of garlic, along with plenty of fresh oregano. I ended up adding two more cloves of garlic and 1 tsp cumin, and I thought it could have used another onion. The peas seemed out of place, and I don't think the Italian seasonings work with the veggies--this was much better with the cumin added. It did taste better the next day.

I loved this dish, the hubs, not so much. I would recommend using fresh veggies, sauteed, can veggies can have so much sodium.

Easy to make & not bad...but honestly--didn't thrill me. It was fine, but kind of lame.  I added a bit of red pepper flakes & a touch of hot sauce to spice it up, which seemed to help. 

Even though I'd rate it as "fine," most likely won't make this one again.

Mmmmm good!  I microwaved fresh collard greens (5min) and used precooked frozen rice medley to cut down cooking time from 2hrs to 10 min.  Added fresh parsley, dried basil, dried oregano, frozen corn, frozen peas, black beans, and garbanzo beans.  Only used canned tomatoes.  Made a simple red wine vinaigrette and added about half cup to salad.  Even my husband loves it!  Thanks for great recipe!

An excellent dish thatâ€™s healthy and uses brown rice and vegetables. I only had canned black beans, diced tomatoes, corn and peas so added that to the rice per the directions. I added Italian seasoning along with salt and ground pepper and loved it!  Will make again for a healthy side dish!

This is pretty decent.  It needed a lot of salt to bring out the flavor though.  Maybe I'll add some cilantro or cayenne or something next time.  It's worth making again though, for sure.

Made as is, it's okay. Made with fresh (or frozen/thawed), it's lovely. Good olives make a difference but you don't need many: just cut em up.
