Breakfast cookie, not a dessert.  I also increased the peanut butter to 1/2 cup and skipped the protein powder.  I added craisins, so they taste kind of like a pb&j. These are not cookies you serve as a treat, but they are great if you need breakfast on the go that is not full artificial "stuff".

Not good. These really had no flavor at all. I didn't add protein powder since it was optional, so I'm not sure if that had an affect on the final product. I did test the batter before I baked them and decided to add more peanut butter, cinnamon and mini chocolate chips. They were still bland and dry and didn't hold  together very well. Wish I hadn't added the chocolate so I could have given them to my dogs!

I did change the recipe and added 1/2 cup of peanut butter and opted out of the protein powder. Tastes great! I added pecans and on the second batch I added cranberries.

Didn't really care for these. I followed the recipe, made no changes. They just weren't good.

You definitely have to doctor up this recipe. I added 1/2c shredded coconut, 2 tbsp peanut butter, and the protein powder. I wanted them to be higher in protein than carbs. They are sweet enough and very satisfying. It added 35 calories and 4 grams of protein to each serving.
