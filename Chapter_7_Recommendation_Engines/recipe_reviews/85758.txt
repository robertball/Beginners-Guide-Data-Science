Very good and easy.  I added a little salt at the end.  Also, I didn't have lemon zest so I used a bit of lemon juice...worked out fine.  We actually had this for dinner, not cocktails!!  Husband really liked it.

I was inspired to make lamb meatballs after watching Harold on Top Chef make some nice spicy lamb sicilian style meatballs. I wanted to make something not so spicy, though, and I found this excellent recipe. Thank you for beating my meatball doldrums!

I wanted to serve this with rice as a meal, so I scaled the meatballs down to 6 servings but made the sauce as written. The meatballs were really quite bland, and the wine in the sauce was absolutely overpowering. I ended up adding about half a can of tomato sauce, and even then it wasn't especially good. I won't be making this again. Thanks anyway.

OMG very good recipe it cost much more than ground turkey or beef but its worth every dollar. I added more tomato sauce and 1/3 cup of lemon juice instead of zest and put a lil bit of lemon juice in the sauce as well. Ummmm (Home Simpson voice) it was soo good.

It was fantastic.  My 15 year old son had second helpings.  I made it with wild rice and tomato sauce on the side.  I used less butter.

These are very tasty! A nice unique dish. I definitely recommend as an appetizer, rather than a meal, because the taste is intense.

Lamb has a different taste than beef, so this was a nice change of pace.  Good ratio of meat to bread crumbs, too - thanks for getting that right Kathy.  Next time I will make MUCH more sauce.  I made two batches this time, and preferred the sauce made with white wine.  The only drawback to this recipe is that ground lamb was expensive ($13 /lb), and was a bit hard to find.  Had to go to a butcher in town because the grocery store only sold lamb chops.

Served these for dinner and loved them.  After quickly browning them in a skillet, I put them in a casserole, poured the sauce over, covered the dish,  and completed cooking in a 400 oven for 25 minutes. I added a dash of cloves, 1/2 tsp sugar,  and one clove of garlic to the tomato sauce recipe - which turned out delicious.  I used lemon juice instead of lemon zest,  half a small onion and 2 cloves garlic minced instead of shallots, and I moistened the bread with a bit of milk.  The meatballs were tender and juicy, the flavors were perfect.  This will go in my permanent collection!

The meatballs were great but I did make a few changes in the prep and created a different sauce which was absolutely wonderful! And I used my crock pot as well. Here's what I did...While making the bread crumbs I added the spices at the same time, adding some dried rosemary and using thyme instead of marjoram. I always do this because I find the spices are more evenly distrubuted in the mixture.. I set the timer for 4 hours, went to work and came home to one of the best meals I've made in a long time! We chose to serve the dish over mashsed potatoes but rice or pasta would be wonderful too. Can't wait to eat the leftovers tonight.

This is a great recipe. I cooked the meatballs in a 375 degree oven for 30 minutes to save cook time and they were so tender and good. I used the recipe for a main dish, with mashed potatoes and steam vegetables.

This was good. I would make it again, but just the meatball part. Used half shallots, half garlic. We ate it as a main course and liked it.
The sauce was a bit strange, though -- not making that again.

Made these meatballs and added maple flavored sausage to the mix. Adding the cinnamon to the butter made them very aromatic. I did not make the tomato sauce though but plan on saving it to be made later.

Everyone enjoyed this new meatball.  A good, subtle taste.  I did not use the sauce but just my regular Italian gravy.  Also used lemon juice and dried parsley since no press was available.

The seasonings were good but I decided that I wanted a Roasted Garlic Parmesan sauce with noodles instead of the tomato sauce. This was my first time using ground Lamb. Will try it again with the tomato sauce.

I changed quite a bit substituting 1/4 onion for shallots and basil and oregano for parsley and margoram. they tasted like a richer beef meatball to me but I love lamb. I think the sauce would be better as a mushroom scampi so I think I will do that next time as the tomatoes and lamb didn't quite mix to me.
