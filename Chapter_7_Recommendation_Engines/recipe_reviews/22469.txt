I cut my frozen rack of ribs in half and threw it in a huge pot of water, brought it to a boil and let it boil for one hour exactly.  I made the BBQ sauce without changing one ingredient.  I used Bacardi rum and two teaspoons of minced garlic (I'm too lazy to crush cloves).  When the ribs were done I put them in a big Zip-lock bag and poared all the BBQ sauce over it and put it in the refrigerator over night.  I took the ribs out of the BBQ marinate and grilled them.  I poared the left over marinate in small pan and simmered it while the ribs were cooking.  When I served the ribs I covered them with the steaming hot BBQ marinate.  My wife did not stop raving about how they were the best ribs she had ever eaten.  Better then any restaurant!  They are sweat so my two, very finicky daughters loved them too.  This recipe is a keeper and will be in our family rotation from now on.

Some reviews said the ribs were tough so to experiment I boiled half of the ribs and baked the other half. Both were tender but the boiled more so. I had 8 people for dinner and it was unanimous they are much better boiled than baked.  Much more tender and did not lose flavor. The sauce is absolutely amazing!!

OH MY!!!!  Excellent recipe!!!........I wanted to point out that CHILE sauce is MUCH different than CHILI sauce.  For those who comment that this is too sweet, I am guessing you bought CHILI sauce.  The correct sauce to use is CHILEEEEEE (remember the "E").  You will find it in the "Mexican Food" area of your grocery store.  I was able to choose from mild or hot.  I chose "mild" because my kids and their taste.......I followed the recipe exactly for the sauce except I doubled it!  It is perfectly sweet/salty/spicy, better than my other homemade BBQ sauce by FAR!.......I boiled the ribs from frozen for an hour.  I poured liquid smoke, kosher salt and favorite spices in the boil water to give the meat an infused flavor.......After the boil, I removed ribs from water and saturated them with the sauce to marinate for a few hours.......Then, I baked for an hour at 350 degrees finishing with 5 minutes under the broiler.  UNBELIEVABLY TENDER!  Thank you for such an amazing recipe!

I had to comment on some of the reviews because everyone finds a great recipe I must say I started making these by boiling and they are awesome the important thing to remember for tender ribs whatever method is ..low (the temp.) and slow (cook time).  I bring ribs to a boil and immediately bring down to low simmer almost 2 hours and they literally almost fall off bone- I then marinate with favorite sauce overnite and grill 20-30 minutes to get grilled on sauce....

I've been using this recipe for years and after reading recent reviews, decided to boil the ribs until very tender, then finish in a 350 degree oven for 30 minutes, basting every 5 minutes.  I find this to be the easiest method (the double foil method takes time, folks!), and boiling washes off significant amounts of fat.  Tender ribs are guaranteed!  Hearty thanks to the submitter.  This is one of my favorite recipes on this website.

I have made this several times and they are very good ribs! I never boil ribs! BOILED meat good?, is this a joke? All the flavor of the ribs are in the water. (think stock) NO prizes have ever been given for boiled ribs! Sorry, to each their own I guess.

Absolutely awesome!  I did use the dry rub before baking the ribs.  And I refrigerated overnight before making the sauce.  The next morning made the marinade (minus the chili sauce--I didn't have any--so I substituted Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce and 1/8 cup RedHot sauce).  I marinated in the sauce for 4 hours.  It's the first time that my husband talked about ribs all day.  They were so tender, juicy and the flavor was just perfect.  I've made many recipes from this site.  This is the first time I felt compelled to register and tell folks just how good this recipe is.  Nicely done

Tried this recipe because of all the good reviews...I have never made ribs anywhere near this good and my husband says he doesn't know how they could get any better!  I used the rub before baking in foil and cheated on the sauce, I actually used a mix of 2 bottled brands (1 sweet /1 spicy) and added brown sugar and the other ingredients (left out the rum and chili sauce) to taste...marinated overnight and they were fabulous. Try these!!

Excellent, even my husband loved it and asked me to make my ribs with this all the time.  I also did the dry rub for ribs marinade by Denise listed under BBQ recipes  before I baked them and then I grilled them with this marinade after letting them marinade for an hour with this recipe.  Excellent!!! Thanks, Cookiewhiz

Wonderful recipe!  If you like the taste of bottled BBQ sauce, you may be a bit disappointed, because this definately has a different flavor.  After reading some of the other reviews, I reduced the amount of the chili sauce to 1/4 cup, and also reduced the amount of the brown sugar to about 3/4 cup, and used baby back ribs for its tenderness.  I made 4 lbs as per the recipe, and marinated half the batch for an hour and the other half in the refrigerator overnight.  Both were equally delicious.  While preparing the sauce, the rum made it smell a bit odd, but after baking the ribs, they smelled and tasted great!

The recipe for sauce is great. We do decrease the amount of brown sugar by half and add about a 6 oz can of pineapple juice. Our biggest secret is that put a rub on the ribs (after we remove the membrane) and  cut them into serving size pieces then double wrap them in foil and put them in the oven over night @175 degrees for 8-10 hours. We have never had a bad review, as a matter of fact we are often asked to make these for family events!

I decided to try this recipe because I've never made ribs by baking them. I really liked the ribs baked in the oven they were not tough at all they were falling off the bone in fact! I didn't make the sauce because I didn't have everything for it so I used Barb-B- Que Sauce recipe from this site. I love the 2 recipes together. This recipe was very easy for me to make with 2 kids running around the house and a fussy 4 month old also. I plan to make these again soon thanks so much!

I have to say, this is the recipe that brought me to allrecipes.com, and this is one of the ones that makes me stay (not that I really needed a lot of reasons).  If you want something that is both exotic -and- good, this recipe is it.  Depending on your chile sauce (I use sri ra cha), it can get pretty spicy (and I'm 1/2 Thai)...but that just adds to the flair.  I make these ribs about three or four times a year, and they never, ever disappoint :)  Great job!

We love ribs and had to try this recipe because of all the great reviews.  Unfortunately, I didn't like this recipe at all.  Even dh was not impressed and he loves ribs of any kind.  I think I'll stick to my  old rib recipe.  I didn't mind the sweetness, but I think the rum was a bit too much.  I am really disappointed that I wasted perfectly good ribs on this recipe.  I think this is the first highly rated recipe that I have tried on this site that I did not like.  We'll keep trying though.

I'm not usually a big fan of BBQ ribs, so I was amazed at how much I loved these.  The sauce is very tasty; a nice change from the typical bottled sauce.  I first boiled the ribs for about 1.5 hours in water (to which I added powdered beef broth).  I made the sauce as suggested, but didn't have chile sauce on hand.  Instead I used additional ketchup with a spash each of chili powder and Frank's Hot Sauce.  I baked the ribs, turning and basting twice over about 40 minutes.  Delicious! I can't wait to try these ribs on the grill.  This recipe's definitely going into my family recipe file!

I've been making these now for years.. Still haven't found anything better..  The only thing I do different is put a dry rub on the ribs before I bake them.. Dry rub consist of 1/4C of Brown Sugar, 1/4C Paprika. Then the last 1/4C I mix Seasoning Salt, little garlic power, Santa Maria Seasoning and what ever else floats your boat..  Cover ribs and bake in foil as described..

These ribs are AMAZING.  Better than any I've had at a restaurant.  Instead of the straight rum I put in half a can of rum and coke and they come out perfect.  Thanks for the recipe :)

I was a skeptic because it didn't smell like traditional bbq sauce and didn't seem sweet.  Man was I wrong!  We didn't use ANY sauce because the flavor was so delicious.  I've never tasted ribs so good!  I did boil with garlic, salt, pepper, liquid smoke and a little soy sauce.  I also saved the broth and froze it to use in the future.  Fantastic recipe!

These were a HUGE hit with my family! I just got done eating 5 ribs & we all agree they are the best ribs I've ever made. I did make a few changes. I added meat tenderizer, onion powder, & pepper before I put them in the oven. For the sauce, I added onion powder & a little bit of hot sauce, omitted the chili sauce (because I didn't have on hand) & only used about 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Someone else said the sauce wasn't as thick as they'd liked. While they were on the grill, I put the remaining sauce on the stove with a little bit of cornstarch & thickened it up, before basting the ribs. 
If you want good ribs, give these a whirl! You won't be disappointed!! YUMMMMMM

As I print out the recipe to prepare for a Memorial Day barbecue, I'm reminded that these are so good, we don't make ANY changes... Instead of cutting into serving portions, we bake and grill large slabs because they're easier to move around. We cut when ready to serve. I love being able to prepare the night before - saves the mess and the time on the serving day. Try this - you won't be disappointed.

First time making ribs and LOVED this marinade. I will cut back on the sugar next time, tasted it and it was way too sweet (and I like sweeter BBQ sauces). I simmered the ribs in salted water w/a 1 Tbl liquid smoke for 2 hours. Marinated for another 2, put the ribs fat side up (think of letter c on it's back) brushed w/marinade, covered and baked per directions. Poured the marinade into a sauce pan, brought to boil and ended up using 3 tbl cornstarch/slurry to thicken the sauce. To cut the sweetness I added 1 tbl cajun seasoning, some rooster sarrachi sauce and some healthy dashes of hot sauce (and more liquid smoke, about 1 tsp). Be kind to yourself and either line the dish w/foil or buy something disposable, contractor grade construction glue has NOTHING on this stuff, some serious HARD scrubbing to clean the dish. Will definitely make again w/different ribs next time (store only had beef back). My son asked me the same night when I was making ribs again, he was pretty impressed with them esp. being baked. Thanks!
UPDATE: Reduced to 3/4 c brown sugar, 3/4 c heinz chile sauce in lieu of ketchup and chile sauce, Pork Spare ribs, 1/4 c honey bourbon in lieu of rum and added tenderizer & salt to the water while boiling the ribs, phenomenal!! Will be making this a LOT!

This is by far the best rib recipe we have tasted! We are a family full of rib lovers, and are always looking for new recipes to try. Ithink we have finally found our go to recipe! Sweet, but a little spicey, gooey goodness.  I changed one thing. I substitued vanilla extract for the rum (only because we didn't have rum in the house) and it was great.

Sauce is very good-however, baking ribs instead of boiling ribs left them somewhat tough.

WOW!!! These are the best ribs I have ever made. I didn't change anything and everyone loved them. The trick really seems to be the bbq at the end. It carmelizes the sauce. Fantastic!!!

I made these over the weekend and the sauce is outstanding.  I followed the recipe exactly.  For those wondering about baking vs boiling - I cooked just as the recipe states and the meat was literally falling off the bone.  I covered them with some of the sauce and let them sit for an hour.  Then onto the grill.  I will make the sauce again and use it on chicken and pork too.  It is really that delicious.  As a side, I really never cared for the taste of rum and was a little hesitant but it truly is worth the try - You will not be sorry!

Absolutely love this recipe...It has quickly become one of our families favorites.  I follow the recipe exactly, except I don't use the chile sauce or rum.  Turns out great and the ribs are so tender.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE them!

This is the Holy Grail of barbecue recipes!

I did boil the ribs for 29 minutes, then bake for an hour at 350 instead of grilling because I didn't have access to a grill at the moment.  It was superb!  There are no leftovers, and even my husband who hates pork ate these up!  This will definitely be my "go-to" recipe for ribs!

I prepared these ribs the day before, as suggested.  Let me tell you, look no further - this recipe is AMAZING.  However, we did make two changes.  We rubbed the ribs with salt & pepper and cooked for forty-five minutes in regular tin foil, along with large chunks of fresh garlic.  After 45 minutes, we took the ribs out of the oven and added FRESH sliced pineapple, re-wrapped the ribs, and cooked for an additional 45 mintues.  While I love spicy food, this recipe calls for a bit too much chilie sauce (especially when making double-quantity), so the pineapple cuts the spiciness nicely.  We marinated overnight, basting occassionally.  The next day, we cooked the seven pounds of ribs on a grill for about fifteen minutes at the Meadowlands and watched the Giants ROUT the Vikings!  Now, I'm not sure which was better: the ribs or the game...try this recipe!

These were pretty good. Sauce was not really to my taste, but the meat was cooked perfectly (used the oven finish). I'll try again with some tweaks to the sauce.

These ribs were VERY flavorful.  Although I like mine a little more fall off the bone,  I was satisfied because of the taste.  Will cook a little longer than called for the next time.  Otherwise, great receipe!

I made this for a barbecue yesterday and everyone loved it.  My boyfriend hasn't eaten pork in 10 years and even he couldn't resist them.  He even had a second helping (not that there was much left)which is really saying a lot!  I marinated the ribs in the dry rub like some readers suggested.  I also omitted the rum but don't feel like I missed out on anything as these were probably the best ribs I've ever made.  This recipe is definitely a keeper and I will definitely make them again (and again and again!).  Thanks for sharing this recipe with us :)

Very good recipe! The marinade is fantastic! I stuck to the ingredients listed with the exception of substituting rum for whiskey (personal preference) and I used siracha for chile sauce. A lot of people boiled their ribs but I have to say, that is just not how good ribs are made.. you lose so much essential flavor in the broth! If you tried baking and thought it lacked some luster, try these changes... Coat the ribs in half of the sauce and wrap in tin foil. Allow to marinate overnight. In the morning, throw them in the oven for 2 hrs at 275F (The trick to ribs is low and slow!). Allow to cool and coat with remaining marinade. Let sit for at least 1 hr at room temperature (I let mine sit in the fridge for about 6 hours). Cook the ribs 15 mins on each side on the grill. Perfect ribs every time! If you don't love it let me know.

My guests gobbled up these ribs stating they are very tender, but a little too spicy (and I used less chile sauce than the recipe called for).  All in all, a great recipe and crowd pleaser!

I made these ribs and then shredded the pork to make pulled pork sandwitches.  Awesome.  Carefull to get rid of bones, fat, and cartilage.  Cole loved them.  Every bit as good as City BBQ but takes some time!

Excellent!  Easy enough to prepare.  My husband loves it.  I would think you can use the pressure cooker and by pass baking it in the oven.  Would save time.

These are awesome ribs!  I followed the suggestion of another review and used the 'Dry Rub for Ribs' from this web site prior to putting the ribs in the oven.  Refrigerated the ribs overnight and grilled them the following day.  I suggest you follow this recipe exactly as shown for the best ribs ever.  Thanks Kristy for sharing this great recipe.
Update July 5, 2008: This is still the go to rib recipe for us, no need to look any further. The last time I made them the oven was tied up baking bread so I simmered the ribs for about 2 hours and then put them in the marinade overnight. The flavor of the ribs did not change but they were very moist and fall off the bone tender. From now on I will be simmering the ribs.

EXCELLENT!  I make this every Saturday. I bake the ribs for 1 hour 15 minutes, marinate all day then BBQ the ribs for approx. 20 minutes total time.  I also add additional brown sugar that caramalizes while cooking on the grill.  My husband & I love this receipe!

Update: I boil spare ribs but bake baby backs at 250 for four hours, they always turn out tenter.  My favorite rib recipe from this site.  I now boil the ribs and they are indeed tender.  The sauce is very good and simple.  Still not like the slow-smoked variety but the best I've ever made at home.

This was the best sauce ever! BBQ went down last night and I cooked 25 lbs ribs (first time ever) and used this sauce.  There was not one rib left.  It was a huge success.  I used everything according to the recipe except I used the Thai Red Chili Sauce. It was exceptional.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe.  This is my forever recipe.

These were phenomenal.  I've only eaten ribs maybe 8 or 10 times in my life, and these just blew every other experience out of the water.  The final cook time for me on the grill was much shorter, however, as they blackened very quickly.  Four roommates from the south all said they were the best ribs they've ever had, or at least just AS good.  Will be making these again.

I made a few changes based on other reviews that I read, and these ribs turned out delicious.  I left out the rum because I'm not a rum fan.  I boiled the ribs for 1 hour, baked them covered at 350 for 30 minutes, then baked uncovered for 30 minutes, and they were practically falling off the bone.

Did these last night and followed the recipe exactly.  Got so many compliments, I had to credit the source.  These are incredible, easy, and fill the house with wonderful smells.  I slow boiled the marinade for 20 minutes or so to blend the flavors as Kristy suggested.  Awesome!!  Thank you!

This recipe is a hit at our house. Very tender and flavourful. I usually boil ribs before grilling but never again. The sauce is now my husbands favorite. He finds it better than the ribs served at his favourite restaurant. I'll be making this again.

Wonderful!!!!  I doubled the recipe and baked the ribs a little longer and then grilled them.  My guests were amazed!!  I boiled the marinade before using it to bast (while grilling) and it thickened up nicely!  I will make this again and again!!

I have been making these ribs for years. I make several adjustments to the ingredients to fit my families taste. The one thing I do recommend is to marinate the ribs overnight after they have been baked. Adds more depth to the ribs.

These are fantastic ribs, although I didn't have any dry mustard on hand.  The ribs were tender, not falling apart, and everyone raved about them at our party!  This recipe is a keeper!!

Absolutely loved this recipe. I went with babyback ribs because that's all the butcher had. They probably did not need to be cooked a full 1.5 hours, but lacking a meat thermometer, I erred on the side of caution.

We used a spicy, homemade red chile sauce, and the ribs still weren't that spicy (but we love heat, especially with BBQ). Next time around I might kick it up a little. We also cut back on the sugar by about 25%, based on some reviewers suggesting it was too sweet, and on my own hunch that it was a lot of sugar for the amount of liquid (keeping in mind that ketchup, rum, and the other sauces have sugars in them, too).

The BBQ came out with a nice, molasses-like character due to the brown sugar, Worcestershire, and caramelization from cooking. With the spice and deep flavors of the other ingredients, it was a great combo.

And the ribs, did, just perfectly fall off the bone leaving delicious hunks of juicy, perfectly cooked morsels of meat.

These weren't as succulent or moist as I've had in the past.  I think they needed to be in the oven longer.  The sauce has fantastic flavour though.

I've made this recipe over and over and my guests looove it!!  I boil the ribs first to make them tender.  And I add a little more pepper condiments to add more of a kick.  This is our favorite rib recipe! Wonderful!!

I made this recipe for my first ever "rib grill" for my family, father-in-law,bro-in-law yesterday.  I used baby back ribs and country-stlye ribs.  Boiled them for 35 minutes, put Denise's Dry Rub on them, then this sauce, marinated for 4 hours, then grilled on Medium for 15minutes.  I am not a rib expert, so I asked my in laws how was the taste, tenderness, etc. They RAVED. The tenderness was perfect, the spice/heat was not too extreme, my kids begged for more!  They had so much food!  Everyone said the sauce was awesome.  I doubled the recipe, put half of it on the stove and simmered it on low heat for 3 hours.  It ended up being a great "dipping" sauce as well as the marinade.  Do this - you won't be sorry.  I also used Spiced Rum in the recipe.

I prepared this recipe a week ago for my husband and myself. We fell in love with it. Today I prepared it for some friends. They thought it was the best they had ever had. This is the best and the easiest recipe I have ever had for barbecued ribs. If you like barbecued ribs, you'll never try another way after this. Guaranteed!

These were the best ribs I have ever eaten anywhere!  I simmered the ribs slowly for 2 hours and then marinated overnight.  I used minced garlic and spicy mustard instead of cloves and dry mustard.  I also used pineapple rum.  I doubled the recipe because I made 6 lbs of ribs.

I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand so I made a few modifications:  used dijon mustard in place of dry ground mustard, wiskey instead of rum, canned diced green chiles (with juice) and chili powder in place of chili sauce.  I boiled the ribs first, then drained, and simmered in the bbq sauce before grilling.  The result was Mmmm mmmm sweet and a little spicy!  Definately a keeper!  Thank you for sharing

WOW! This recipe is amazing! We thought these turned out better than our favorite local bbq place! They were fall off the bone tender. I'll definitely be making these again soon. Followed the recipe to a t but didn't have any rum on hand. This is possibly my favorite allrecipes.com recipe ever!

WOW!  I rated this recipe a five-star only because there wasn't anything higher.  This is the absolute BEST barbecue recipe that I've ever tried, and I've tried a LOT of them!  As others suggested, I boiled the ribs first, but in water, not beer.  I used country style boneless pork ribs.  The only changes I made was that I didn't have any chili sauce, so I put in about a tablespoon of chili powder.  I also added two teaspoons of liquid smoke and that did it for me.  There isn't an adjective good enough to describe how much I loved this recipe.  Thank YOU!

My family loves this recipe! It was the quietest dinner time ever, the only sounds heard were mmmm, and these are sooo good. My son wishes we could have these every night and he can be picky. I par boiled the ribs for 30 minutes and marinated overnight. Be sure to baste a couple of times during cooking as the sauce is unbelievable and really makes this recipe.

Wow!!!  I'd never made ribs before, and my husband loved these!  I cut the sugar in half, and used country style pork spareribs.  The sugar in the sauce can burn pretty quickly, so watch them on the grill, and turn and baste often.  Very delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

The sauce for these ribs is excellent.  Probably the best ribs we've ever had (except for the cut of meat - read further).  And the preparation method worked out well.  We used the grilling method just prior to serving.  The only thing I would do differently would be to use babyback ribs which are much less fatty than spareribs.  Thanks for a great recipe, Kristy.  We'll be making this often.

FANTASTIC!! You won't be disappointed.  I followed the sauce recipe exactly as written and I chose to bake the ribs instead of grilling them.  I laid the pre-baked ribs (after marinating for 2 hrs) out on a large pan, spooned on half the sauce, baked for 20 min, then spooned on the rest of the sauce and baked for another 20 min, until the sauce was slightly bubbly and thickened.  Everyone loved the taste and the meat was perfectly tender. I recommend you give this a try.

I've tried numerous recipes from allrecipe.com but this is the FIRST time I've felt utterly COMPELLED to leave feedback. 
This was an unplanned meal (planned to throw ribs in oven bag with a bottle of BBQ - blah!), so I did not have all the ingredients. I substituted chile sauce for Tabasco & the dry mustard for regular yellow. The rest of it was followed to a "t" and Ho-ly cow! These were phenomenal ! My hubby loved them, my kids loved them, I wished there were more! For us, there were 6 servings as opposed to 8. Five stars and much praise to the one responsible for sharing this recipe, Thank You!!

These are the best ribs that I have ever made. I usually bake them first and never boil but this sounds interesting. I have seen that many people do a rub first before baking. What is your recipe??
By the way, I usually serve these ribs with Buttermilk Cornbread and twice baked stuffed potatoes along with either slaw or roasted Corn on Cob. Again Please share your Rub recipe......

My husband and I LOVED this recipe.   I cooked them in the oven as original recipe first then drained them and coated with sauce and continued in oven for another 1.5 hours wrapped in foil.  I didn't have rum so I used whiskey instead.  I was out of dry mustard so I used brown mustard and did not use chile sauce. These ribs are incredible!!!

AMAZING recipe! I don't normally post reviews, but felt inclined to do so as this is truly the best recipe for ribs. I boiled the ribs for an hour and a half, and then when the ribs were cooled, I threw them in a ziplock bag with the marinade. Next day, I threw them on the grill, and put the heated up the marinade on the stove. Once the ribs were warmed up, I arranged them in a deep dish pan, and poured the marinade on top. AMAZING!!

My husband said these were the best ribs ever. My two children (5 and 2) would not eat them and I thought they were okay. Definitely too sweet and NO spice. I did boil the ribs and was surprised at how moist they were. However, I cannot get over the mental stigmata that they should be grilled or oven baked and that they would taste better had I followed the recipe.

This recipe was the best BBQ-ed ribs ever! I got rave reviews from everyone at dinner, and the ribs fell off the bone, even if its baked. I skipped the rum and changed it to more Worcestershire sauce (since I don't have any at home), replaced dry mustard with Dijon mustard. I actually tried to modify the recipe with things I have in the kitchen, but it still came out fantastic! :D

The sauce was excellent. I will make it again and serve with chicken (on lazy days). The ribs could have been better but I think that was more me than the recipe. I followed the advice and boiled, but turned out dry. Next time, I will boil for 45-60 minutes and shorten the bbq time.

Fantastic marinade/sauce!  Even my over BBQed ribs were delicious.  

I pressure cooked my ribs before marinading.  Minor change to the recipe - added  approx. 2 Tbsp of Frank's Red Hot sauce since I didn't have any chile sauce.  For anyone looking for kick, I'd increase the hot sauce as this was mild enough for my spice averse son.

I will definitely make this again but get my husband to do the grilling!

Here is how we changed this.  I didn't use the rum, I didn't have any chili sauce so I skipped that too.  And I used about a tbsp of regular mustard instead of the dry stuff.  This was outstanding.  Really sweet which my husband doesn't usually like but he liked this.  It is a definite do over at our house.

Oh, this was wonderful.  I used 6 lbs because I had a full sparerib, so went up 50% on all ingredients.    Was slightly panicked when I didn't have rum or cognac so threw in a cup of the liquid I had available from juicing tomatoes (in lieu of the liquor and the ketchup).  Also, I didn't have chile sauce, but used all other ingredients as listed.  Was concerned that it was going to make the flavor strange or too tomato-ey or not sweet enough, but it was WONDERFUL.  Baked for 90 minutes as instructed, marinated overnight in a freezer bag, and then cooked in the oven just like she said, 30 minutes and basted a few times. WOW.  These were just  absolutely fabulous.   Highly recommend this recipe!

The best recipe for barbecue ribs! My parents literally thanked the person who shared this recipe. It was the best bbq ribs we have ever tasted. Thank you!  Instead of rum, I put Hennessey COGNAC. OMG, it tasted really good with the sauce. I could taste the good flavors of Cognac. I only kept the marinated ribs in the fridge for 30mins becos my family couldn't wait any longer. I didn't skip the 30mins of grilling time though. It looked great and tasted AWESOME!!

Very Tender and Tastey.... I boiled these on the side burner of the grill before I put them in the marinade instead of putting them in the oven because it was a really hot summer day and didn't want to heat up the house.... they ended up very tender... good for slimming bad for taste.... i lost quite a bit of fat.... but the Ribs tasted great after marrinating and being basted with the BBQ sauce..
UPDATE: I made it again baking them this time.... but notable difference... I do think boiling them did make them more tender but baking them might have had more flavor.... I couldn't find chile sauce with an e so I threw in a can of mild chiles, a little oil, and extra ketchup... worked out good.... good flavor
UPDATE: I have made these several times now and boiling them for an hour to an hour and a half make these ribs so tender.. and I don't think you lose much flavor at all.. this recipe continues to impress

The sauce for this recipe is phenomenal, however, our ribs were very very chewy and hard.  I was hoping for fall off the bone type of ribs.  I think it might have been the lower quality of the ribs we purchased, so we will try again with better quality ribs.  I also want to find a different method where you do more than just wrap them in foil and bake them, so that the cooking method will also lead to a more succulent rib. . ..still looking.

Finger Lickin Good.  Even though I had to make a few substitutions these ribs where  good.  I didn't have the chile sauce so I used what I did have on hand and that was 1/4 cup of mild pace picante sauce and to keep it spicy 1/4 cup of chipotle tobasco.  I also didn't have the dry mustard so I substituted with 2tsp of prepared mustard.  All in all these ribs still turned out excellent.  Another note, I didn't not marinate my ribs. Like others I simply boiled them for 2 1/2hrs. Then I baked them at 350 degrees coverd for 30mins, 30mins uncovered, and broiled 5mins per side at 400 degrees all the while basting with the marinade. Recipe has already mades it way into my "Favoretes" cookbook.  Thanks for the entry.

My husband and I made these for the 4th.  He loved them!  We used 1/4 cup of the Rooster Hot Sauce.  I am so glad that I only used 1/4 cup because any more would have been overkill.  My husband told me twice that they were really good ribs.  Something that he never does.  The sauce was a wonderful sweet and spicy sauce.  All in all this was the best meat recipe from this website or anyother site that we have ever made!  Thank you so much for sharing:)

OMG!! Sooo finger lickin' good.  Made it 2x now and got even more raves the second time.  Followed advice of boiling in beer(make the kitchen smells like a college dorm room on a thursday night), marinade overnight, then grill as usual.  The best!  too bad for my vegetarian wife, hah!  more for me and the kids.  Next time, i'll also marinade chicken separately with the same sauce.   My mouth is watering! maybe i'll make it tonight !!

I have been making these ribs for years now and we love it.  I have cooked them both in the oven and on the grill.  I used the dry rub, which makes them spicy but flavorful.  I also doubled the sauce. It is wonderful!!

WOW!! These were awesome!  Since it was 95 degrees out when I made these, some changes in procedure were needed.  I put the ribs in a stockpot, covered with water, brought to a boil, reduced to simmer for 2 hours, skimming fat from top. Then in a saucepan, I added all the sauce ingredients (used only 1/2c b.sugar and I used Capt. Morgan-yummy!-Spiced Rum), and simmered for a bit. Then I put the very tender ribs into a dish and poured the sauce over top to be refrigerated all night and until 6 p.m. the next day.  Brought back to room temp, and grilled for only 15-20 min.  Woo wee, they were great!! I personally thought the sauce was good enough for dipping, as long as you boil it hard to get rid of bacteria.  Thanks so much, Kristy, for a perfect way of cooking a not-so-perfect cut of meat.

Oh Kristy!  Where have you been all of our lives!!??  Our family (including extended "picky" family eaters) loved this recipe....with a capital "LOVED!"

This recipe is VERY EASY!  Even though it looked intimating at first.

These are THE BEST ribs I have ever had, hands down!!  Better than ANY restaurant ribs I have ever had!

God bless you Kristy!!  I thank you and my family thanks you.  A once intimidating meal has now become my families favorite, easy-to-make meal!

PS_I used Cindy's Dry Rub right before I covered the ribs in the foil and cooked them in the oven.  Then I put them in the refridgerator overnight using this marinade (I used a little extra of each ingredient.)  We then grilled them using Baby Ray's grilling sauce (the hickory smoke one.)  They also have a "sweet sauce" but I thought it would be too much given the ingredients of the dry rub and the marinade.  THE RIBS WERE PERFECT.  The grilling time of 30 minutes was great.  Anymore and I think they would have carmelized too much and become dry.

This recipe is awesome. I had sent over some ribs to my fiance's grandparents (they are big barbecue makers) thinking they would not even try it. But the next day they called wanting to know where I got that recipe and if they could have it. Made my day.

Thank you so much Kristy. This was wonderful, though I didn't manage to stay entirelly true to the recipe. I substituted some ketchap, crushed chilli powder and tabasco mix for the chilli sauce (cause I had none in the house), and brandy for rum. I also reduced the quantity of brown sugar as adviced by other cooks' reviews....It came out better than I have ever eaten in the restaurant or anywhere else. Everyone raved, and almost got in a fight over the last few pieces (ha ha ha). I also made some potato skins to go with it - baked the potatoes for 1 hour in the oven, cut them in half, scooped out most of the flesh and mixed it with some sour cream, some cilandro, salt, white pepper, and grated mozarella and cheddar mix....Yummy!!! I will never bbq without making at least a starter out of these ribs (the tip about the oven was invaluable).

Thanks for sharing Kristy. Great recipe! Used Denise Smiths Rib Rub first. To make the marinate more full-bodied, I also added 1/8th cup apple cider vinegar and 1/4 cup dark molasses and cooked sauce ingredients on stovetop so we would have a marinate and a dipping sauce. Yummy sauce and ribs!

Incredibly rich! I also used the rub by denise before I cooked and then marinated the ribs. I also added 1/4 cup tomato sauce and 1/4 cup red chile sauce instead of a 1/2 cup of the chile sauce. I also added 1/4 cup of pinapple juice to the marinade. DON'T worry about how the marinade looks or tastes before you cook the ribs. I was a bit concerned, but they turned out fantastic!

I made these ribs last night and loved them.  However I used far too much hot sauce.  So they didn't go over too well with my family (I love spicy foods and have a really killer hot sauce that I bought in New Orleans (Pain 100%) and I used that) my little sister didn't like the spiciness.  Just cut back on the hot sauce and this a great recipe that's easy to make.

I have never cooked a rack of ribs in my life until today. These were fall off the bone delicious and my hunny who's never had a good rib experience anywhere raved about these. I wrapped the ribs in double aluminum foil and cooked in the oven on 300 degrees for 3 hours on a baking sheet. I made the sauce but left out the chile sauce because I just didn't think id be a fan of that. I actually cooked this sauce in a pot on the stove to a boiling then turned to low for 30 minutes. When I pulled my ribs out of the oven I unwrapped them and dumped the grease without removing them from the baking sheet because they would have fallen apart they were so tender. Since I did not use the chile sauce i was a bit concerned because my BBQ sauce was not thick at all and I was afraid it was ruined but I poured the sauce over the ribs anyway and it stuck just fine. We took the rack of ribs still on the aluminum foil and put the aluminum foil with the ribs right on the grill because again, they would have fallen apart. We grilled them for about 8 minutes, spooned on some more sauce and to the dinner table they went. I CANNOT say enough about how awesome this was!!!

I tried these for mothers day and they turned out great. I cooked them the night before and then  warmed them in the oven right before everyone came over. Next time the only thing I will change is to double the recipe because they just went to quick.

This is the best recipe I have ever found for ribs! I have been using it for years now and have made it for so many different people who LOVE it!  One note is that you must first REMOVE THE MEMBRANE on the backside of the ribs!  All ribs will be tough no matter what recipe you use! It can be difficult, but I just use a pointed knife and poke it into the back and pull up until I either grab or break the membrane. Then, I grab tightly and pull slowly trying to get it off in one piece.  Just be sure to get the entire membrane off.  This is a MUST if you want tender ribs!  I also do not use as much rum as the recipe calls for but that is my own preference.  One last thing is to cook the ribs at a low temperature on the grill.

Everyone LOVED this recipe!! The second time I made it, I used Frank's Sweet Chili Sauce and added just under a 1/4 cup of pineapple juice.  It made a huge difference and it tasted great!

This was excellent! The sauce was amazing and the ribs turned out great. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the ribs weren't pull apart tender, so next time I think I will cook them lower and slower. I will definitely try again!

I used babyback ribs.  I baked one slab per the recipe and boiled the other for an hour and finished them both off on the grill for 30 minutes.  We didn't really notice much difference in tenderness in the final product.    As far as the sauce is concerned, I reduced the brown sugar to 2/3 cup and left off the rum.  I didn't think it needed it.  If you have difficulty finding the chile sauce, look for enchilada sauce.  It may indicate that it's also red chile sauce.  That's how I finally found it.  I marinaded one slab in this sauce and the other in our favorite store bottle brand over night.  We actually preferred this recipe.  So don't be afraid if you think the combination of ingredients seems a bit strange. Also I thought the sauce was much better the second day so go ahead and make it up a couple days in advance and let it mellow a bit.    Hubby gave the recipe a thumbs up so we'll definitely make it again.

2009 - Love, Love, Love these ribs. The sauce is the best. I use a spiced rum so its a little sweeter. Since making these all the other rib recipes are bland to me now. Thank you for sharing!

Update - It's 2016, and this is still my favorite rib sauce!!

I made these just like the recipie said, except without the chile sauce. I used Bicardi Rum like another reviewer mentioned. The ribs were very tender, the bones fell off as I was bbq'ing them. I didn't find the sauce that great. It was almost like a honey garlic sauce except not as sweet. My family thought it was okay, but i won't make them sauce again.

This recipe is wonderful.  Great flavor and a time saver when grilling the next day.  Just a note to those of you who boil your ribs prior to cooking, boiling the ribs takes away alot of the flavor form the ribs.  If you cook ribs low and slow you will not have to worry about them being tough.  With this recipe you can cook them in the oven the day before gilling for the low and slow part to tenderize the ribs then throw on the gill for a quick finish.  Thanks for the great sauce.   Melissa in Ga.

I thought the taste of the sauce was excellent.  I wasn't paying close attention to the ingredients and used chili sauce, instead of chile sauce.  Since I wanted a sweet/spicy flavor, I added several teaspoons of cayenne pepper sauce to it.  Like others, I simmered the ribs in water, liquid smoke and onions for about an hour, marinated the ribs in the sauce for 3-5 hours and then baked them covered for about 1 1/2 hours.  Since the sauce was very thin, I poured off the sauce, thickened it with cornstarch in a saucepan and then put it back over the ribs for another 20 minutes or so.  Next time I make them, I'm gonna do the same thing, but add even a bit more cayenne pepper sauce.  I love this recipe.

used baby back spare ribs and cooked it as suggested - double foiled in the oven.  marinaded it overnite and due to the wind storm had to bake it in the oven @ 350 degrees for 40 minutes (cooked it 15 minutes with foil, then basted and removed foil, cooked for another 15 and basted, then another 10 minutes) then broiled for 3 minutes.  the ribs were excellent.  not dry or tough at all.  fantastic recipe!!  thanks!

I tried the boiling method others suggested. I can't tell any difference between boiling and slow roasting. The sauce was a hit, and I'll use it again.

One word.....YUM!!!!!  This recipe is the best. It was a hit with everyone, including little ones.  Great finger-licking ribs with the best sauce!!  Once you make this, you will not want to ever buy bottled again or make any other recipe.

I used the same basic ingredients and it comes out amazing.  I used country style ribs (boneless), boil the meat until it is soft but still holds its shape (around an hour).  Then I marinate in the sauce for a day and cook it the next day until it is a bit charred in places.  This is a winner everytime.  The sauce is the key and I think will go with just about any type of pork!

This is a GREAT recipe.  I'm not much of a rib eater(husband is), but I really liked these!  I used baby back ribs and coconut rum - although I only used about 3/4 of the amount of rum called for.  I followed everything else in the recipe.  The best part is getting all your work (the cooking!) done in advance for convenience on BBQ day!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I followed this recipie to a tee.  There is no question the sauce is what makes this so good.  I would suggest to not be afraid to use a rub as suggested. I think that is better than liquid smoke.  Also these have a tendancy to be very sweet.  So if you like spice add it in the rub.  When grilling, pay attention closely.  These can burn very easily.  Flip often.

I cooked these ribs for Easter and they were a great hit! We mixed the sauce as stated minus the rum. First we boiled the ribs in water for 2 hours on simmer, then we used the dry rub as mentioned in another review, baked the ribs with the dry rub for 2 hrs on low heat, then we put them in a very large cake pan and marinaded them covered over night, finally, we grilled the ribs for about 25 minutes. We had just brought the ribs in the house not even ready to sit down yet before people started picking at them. The ribs were extremely tender, fell off the bone, had a GREAT flavor, were sticky and sweet, and all around just amazing. I will be using this recipe along with the dry rub recipe for years to come. Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

My family wanted me to throw a BBQ party this past weekend and offered to buy the meat. When an uncle brought me pork spare ribs, I had NO IDEA how to cook them. I never made pork or ribs in my life. Needless to say, I read all 300+ reviews for this recipe before I started! Boiled the ribs for an hour, then marinaded overnight. Threw the ribs on the grill for 7-8 minutes each side. Everyone raved, flavor was exquisite, meat was tender and falling off the bone! Other than following other reviewers and boiling the meat first, I followed the recipe to a tee... Thanks! I will never be scared of ribs again!

I will never buy bottled bbq sauce again! I searched and searched for the perfect bbq sauce and I have finally found it. Marinade and sauce in one,can't beat that! Everytime I make these everyone just raves about them. My husband likes to use it on everything,including the hamburgers! I am still experimenting on the best method to make them though. The last time I threw the ribs (still frozen) in a large pot and let them boil until tender.Then I rubbed them with the "Dry Rub for Ribs" recipes on this site. Baked them for about 20 minutes. Then grilled them. They turned out really good that way. Not falling off the bone but very tender. Just the way I like them! Thank you for such a great recipe. You cannot go wrong with this one.

Wow! These ribs were absolutely to die for. They were as good as ribs in a restaurant, so flavourful and tender. I did make some changes to the recipe, though. Based on previous reviews, I boiled the ribs for about an hourinstead of baking them. I didn't have any rum, so I added two tablespoons of whiskey instead. I didn't have any chilisauce either, so I substituted that for a decilitre of bbq sauce and about 2 tablespoons of hotsauce. This is how I will always make ribs from now on. Thanks!

I decided to try this recipe as my first attempt at making ribs. I have to say, these rival my Dad's recipe! I made a batch for the super bowl party today but I'll be lucky to get any to the party! I can't stop "testing" them. Thank you so much for the submission!

For some reason I spaced out marinating the ribs so what I did was, I had 2 slabs of baby backs, took a Reynolds turkey bag, made the marinate exactly as offered, put the ribs and marinade in the bag, closed it up and baked at 350 for about 2 1/2 hours.  Took them out and everyone DEVOURED them!!!  I didnt even use the grill!

Fantastic ribs, my husband and i loved them.  I followed the recipe I did not add anything and they came out great, better than the restaurant.  We will be having them again real soon.

Didn't marinade overnight but the ribs still turned out delicious.  Used the "Dry Rub for Ribs" as others suggested and used country style pork ribs as they are favored in our household.  We have a stainless natural gas grill and the 30 minutes of grill time even at low was way too much.  Would probably not go longer than 15 minutes next time.  To make sure that the inside is hot enough, let meat warm for a little bit, preferably to room temperature before grilling.  Don't want the outside to cook before the inside is warm/hot.  Used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce for dipping and loved it!

This recipe lived up to all the reviews! It was soooo delicious! I made it for dinner with a friend who is a rib-lover and she raved! I made it with boneless spare ribs which were tasty and not messy. I also toned down the brown sugar as suggested in other reviews, but mainly because I only had about 3/4 a cup left! I also subsitituted Coke for the rum because I didn't want to buy it for the small amount I would use in the recipe since we don't drink it. No, the ribs aren't as tender when you grill them, but it doesn't matter to us since the sauce was so amazing! Better than the restraunt ones I usually eat!

This is definitely the best way to make ribs.  These make baby backs look like a joke.  I also cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and next time I will probably give the ribs a dry rub before baking and cut the sugar even more, but still a really really good recipe.

These ribs were delicious, succulent and moist. I prepared them the night before, as suggested. I even cooked another slab and added them to the marinade the next day!  My family loved them and I have extra meals that I can freeze.

We loved the sauce!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I used dark rum because the recipe didn't specify.  I cooked the ribs at night, added the sauce, and didn't grill the ribs until the next evening.  I heated the sauce up a little for the basting process.  My boyfriend was a bit skeptical about the sauce, (he's used to bottled sauces)but quickly changed his mind after he tasted the ribs.  They were wonderful!  Thank you for the recipe Kristy!  :-)

This was just delicious!  I have been looking for a good ribs recipe and have tried many in the past couple of months--I will not need to look another further.  YUM!  THe only thing I did differently was to substitute a 1/4 cup of Ketchup and a T. of chili powder for the chile sauce (because I did not have any chile sauce) and I placed a BBQ dry rub on the ribs immediately before cooking.  This was a big hit!!!

Edible, but very disappointing.  With so many 5-star ratings, I was sure this was going to be a big hit but it wasn't.  The ribs were dry and the sauce was very bland and way too sweet.  I'll continue my search for a great homemade BBQ sauce recipe or just keep using Sweet Baby Ray's bottled sauce (available at your local grocer).  I won't be making this one again.

excellent recipe,I used side ribs and they came out a little tough, next time I will cut back the cook time in the foil to about 45min. If you like your ribs spicy add more of the black pepper. I will definately make these again.

These ribs were dynamite!!!! Ths only sugestion would be to maybe double the marinate as I found I would have like more for basting. This is definatly a 5 star plus. I will be making it again real soon and I am going to try this marinate on chicken and chops as well. Thank you, thank you Kristy

These were awesome.  I cut the sugar by half, my husband doesn't like a real sweet sauce.  My mother-in-law said they were restaurant quality.  My husband admitted they were better than his but wants to cut down a little on the rum next time.  Can't wait to try it again.  Thanks!

FANTASTIC RIBS!!! I have made this recipe several times over the summer.  Like others, I also use the dry rub before I bake them. After baking I place them in a large pot or ZIPLOCS with the marinade and leave them in the refrigerator for 1 -2 days.  What a time saver. The only thing I reduce is the amount of brown sugar and they are still great. The best part IS being able to make them in advance and then just pop them on the grill to serve.

Great sauce!   Must admit to doing a bit of "customizing"....   Bought some boneless beef ribs and whipped out the slow cooker!  Only used 3/4 cup of brown sugar, garlic powder instead of fresh, added a dash of onion powder and a bit more dry mustard.  Combined the ingredients, poured them over the ribs, turned ribs to coat well and cooked them on low/medium for a couple hours, then turned the slow cooker down to low and let them cook about seven hours (slow cookers are VERY forgiving....could leave them longer (steeping in this tasty sauce).  The ribs were so tender and the flavor....nothing short of fantastic!  Definately a keeper (and one I know I will be asked to share).  Kudos Kristy!

I never, never, NEVER boil the ribs! Never! Instead, I cook the ribs low and slow. Bake as described in the recipe, but bake at 250 degrees for 2 1/2 to 3 hours. That's the secret for tender ribs.

I had 15 people for a family reunion and made these ribs. Every household attending, asked for a copy of the recipe. I used the cooking in foil method and then marinated the ribs a full 24 hours before grilling. My husband grilled the ribs on a low heat, basting frequently. When finished, the ribs had a beautiful color, were caramelized extremely tender and had a great flavor. This is a recipe I've already saved in my favorites and am making them for my next event. Plus, from a hostess standpoint, the ribs are easy for entertaining. I basically did everything the day before and my husband took over during the party, so I was able to enjoy my family and friends. Thank you SEEsign.

Doubled the sauce recipe and boiled the ribs before marinating. Just before grilling portion out a section of the sauce and heat it with the saucepan till simmering. After the grilling - pour the simmered sauce over the ribs.

Mmm, the marinade is going to be my go-to recipe for BBQ sauce now. These were seriously good. The kitchen smelled like a distillery afterward but the rum was not overpowering, just added a really lovely flavor. I don't like spice so I totally left out the chile sauce and we cut the sugar because I don't usually care for tooth-achingly sweet bbq. It was so yummy!!

This recipe was amazing. I did add salt, chopped onions, fresh garlic and some adobo to the water -when I boiled the ribs for about an hour. I made double the recipe and I only had one little rib left over. Great recipe!

My first time making ribs outside of a restaurant, and wow! They were THE hit at the BBQ. I changed a couple things of course. I did a dry rub using Paprika, Cayenne, Pepper, Accent salt, Nutmeg and Garlic powder. I baked them wrapped in foil and chopped up onions for 2 hours at 275. Took them out and placed in a large roasting pan thouroughly coated with sauce that I had let sit in the fridge for the 2 hour cooking time. I had also replaced the 1/2 cup Chile sauce, with a 1/4 cup Siriachi Chili sauce, replaced the rum for brandy and added more garlic. I then cooked the in the roasting pan for another 1h45. All that was left was to throw them on the Barbie and coat them with the remainding sauce. Amazing.

Excellent!!!  I marinated the ribs overnight using all of the ingredients listed in the original post (except a little less brown sugar).  I grilled the ribs for about 30 minutes the following evening.  While the ribs were on the grill, I added 2 tsp of corn starch and 2 tsp of water (mixed together) to the remaining sauce and heated it up on the stove until it was thickened like normal BBQ sauce.  I used this sauce to baste the ribs while they were on the grill, and also served it on the side for anyone who likes a little extra sauce on their ribs.

Made for dinner with my roommate.  We each finished a 2lb rack of ribs!  We could not believe how tasty the bbq sauce was.  We will make this again for sure, next time for more people!

So, I always laugh when people write "This recipe was SO good, but I did it like this......." And here aI am, about to do that!!! The thing is, I just never have the time OR all the ingredients to do a recipe like it's written. So, I read all the reviews and made a couple changes. The main point I hope people get from this, is that you can do this QUICKER and they will still be AWESOME. First, I boiled the ribs for an hour -to the water I added garlic powder, salt, pepper, dried mustard and Worcestershire sauce -I think this was key. I only had a 1/2 to marinade the boiled ribs in the other sauce -which was also altered. I didn't have Chile sauce or ketchup, but I had chili sauce (the Heinz jar kind) so I subbed that in for what I was missing, and per the enchilada sauce recipe I added some cumin to it. Then we grilled them for the allotted time. The whole I time I was eating them I kept saying "I can't believe I made these!!!" and my husband said they were bbq contest good!!!! I'm making them again tonight, but will marinade them overnight this time. I still put stuff in the water. These ribs KICK BUTT!!!!!! YUMMMMMM

I didn't have chile sauce, so I used salsa.  Used spiced rum, added a few shakes of cumin.  Added extra garlic cloves.  Put sauce in blender and mixed.  Cooked ribs in oven.  They sat all day covered in sauce in the fridge.  Warmed at 375 for 30 min before serving.  Yummy!

Absolutely wonderful ribs!  I prepared the ribs the day before going on a beach trip.  I cooked them in the oven for about 3 hours, then let them sit overnight in the refrigerator in the marinade sauce.  The next day at the beach, all we had to do was heat up the grill and let them cook, marinating them quite often.  Everyone loved them!

I boiled the ribs first,marinated them in room temp while they ware hot out of water then put on grill and they were very tender. I did not add rum (we are nondrinkers) and it was still delicious. The recipe said 4 lbs for 8 servings. I had 7 lbs for 6 people and could have made a little more sauce. Overall, a delicious recipe!

Great ribs!  I was a little skeptical as I was making the sauce but in the end they turned out great.  I finished them off in a 350 degree oven for 30 minutes instead of the grill.  Really good recipe!

I used chili sauce as I couldn't find chile sauce, and I didn't think these were overly sweet. Also, I baked them the whole way. I put the ribs by themselves in a covered roasting pan at 250 for 3.5 hours. I then drained them, poured the sauce over, covered, and baked at 225 for about another hour. Thanks for a great sauce!

These are the ribs you dream about. Better then any restaurant hands down. The only thing I couldn't find was chile sauce - much different then chili sauce. I did find a chile relish and used that as a subsitute with great results.

Bake ribs (I buy from Costco) with the rub of your choice, if you do not have chili sauce substitute same quantity tomato sauce, 1/4 tea cinnamon, pinch of cloves and allspice, marinate for an hour while still hot as recipe states, then bake again for 50 minutes, finishing under broiler for 5 minutes on each side.  It's so good, my husband says this recipe should be my trademark.  My thanks to the member who submitted this!

Very nice.  I boiled the ribs to start, like I usually do and what others had suggested.  I made the sauce, and the only difference was that I used Thai Chile Sauce and omitted the rum. 
I baked them in a roasting pan in the oven covered in sauce for 30 minutes and then rotated the ribs in the pan and cooked for another 20 minutes @ 400 convection.
I served these to company and they were a hit!

These ribs are the BEST ever! I've BBQ'd them and also baked them (about 1/2 hour covered with foil, 1/2 hour uncovered). I always double the sauce - my family likes extra, it's so good.  Good on boneless pork cutlets.

Fantastic,outstanding recipe!  I bought a package of Baby Back Ribs at Costco and even though it was more like 7 lbs. I used it all.  I doubled the sauce.  I also used Hugh's Dry Rub from this site to season the ribs lightly before putting them in the oven.  As for the rum I used Meyer's Rum since that is what I had in hand. All I can say is that everyone loved them and there were some messy but super happy faces at our dinner table!

I made this recipe last weekend for friends, following previous reviewers, I boiled the ribs for an hour and ten minutes, then marinated them for at least four hours in double the amount of marinade. We grilled them for about ten minutes while basting with the marinade and I simmered the sauce on the stove. Before serving I poured the sauce over the ribs, it turned out better than any restaurant! They were so tender they were falling off the bone, and the sauce was amazingly tasty. My guests loved it and I must say this will become a permanent addition  to my kitchen!

I just made these ribs for a family picnic and they were the first thing to go! They were wonderful!  I cooked them as instructed the day before.  I never liked the idea of boiling meat, it cooks the flavor out of it.  I've always done my ribs in the oven like this.  Make sure you take off the "membrane" from the back of the ribs first.  The easiest way to do this is lifting it a little with a knife, then grabbing it with a paper towel and pulling it off.  I did the sauce just as listed, but the soy sauce I use is "lite soy", I don't think it made a difference.  I let the ribs marinate in a large plastic bag over night, turning them every now and then, until time to cook.  I received so many compliments, and people asked for the recipe.  Thank you for the recipe - there's no need for us to use any other!!

Delicious!  My dinner guests all thought these were the best ever.  I boiled the ribs for a little over an hour and let them sit in the marinade for about four hours before grilling them on our gas grill.  Since they were already cooked, they were done in no time. Definitely will do them again.

Great Ribs.  We were concerned that they might be a little too sweet, but did not find them to be so.  Like another reviewer commented, we did add a couple teaspoons of liquid smoke to the marinade/baste.  The ribs compared favorably with any we have had at restaurants.  We would definitely recommend others to try this recipe.

OMG....these are awesome!  The sauce is too die for!!  I did as others suggested and boiled the ribs in beer (and a little water).  Marinated the ribs overnight in the sauce.  Also, I used about a 1/2 cup of left over sauce for basting while barbequing, and like someone else suggested, I heated and reduced the remaining sauce on the stove and served it on the table.  People were dipping their ribs and bread in it.  My husband eyes were rolling back in his head as he ate the ribs.  I do think you need the rum...as it gives the sauce a molasses flavour which is delicious!! Also, just before I took the ribs off the barbeque, I sprinkled a tiny tiny bit of salt on them (very little)..but it gave them a nice mild salty/sweet flavour.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've done this one 4 or 5 times now.  I used Captain Morgan's Rum and it is spectacular.  I have had guests begging for the recipe (which I share freely)

I boil the ribs an hour, marinade them in some sauce for a few hours then grill them on my Weber, brushing on the sauce each time I turn them (often).  After about 20 minutes I pull them off, drizzle on a little more sauce and serve.  Recommended!

It was wonderful!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was that the rum taste was a little overwhelming to my liking.  Next time I'll definitely reduce the rum.

This was fun to put together and as a "rib rookie" I must say these turned out fantastic. I boiled the ribs for about 40 min. Marinated them for about 6 hrs. Then baked them in the oven for 30 min. Basting them every 5 minutes or so. The meat was tender and after warming the leftover marinade I used that as a dipping sauce. Yummy!

This is a very delicious BBQ ribs recipe, and it’s very easy to prepare and make.  I have used this recipe many times, and my husband and little girl loved it.  I choose to boil the ribs 30 minutes instead of baking them in the oven.  I then put the boiled ribs in the freezer bag and add the sauce and marinate the ribs overnight.  The next day we put the ribs on grill in medium heat covered for 8 minutes each side.  You may not want to leave it too long on the grill as it can get burned easily.  As the ribs already pre-cooked, and the purpose to put it on the grill is to get the smoked flavor.  By following other members’ advice, I did reduced half cup of brown sugar from the original recipe, but if you like sweet ribs, you can follow the original recipe.  I did not add any rum and it already tastes really good without it.  As the sauce is plenty, I used half of the sauce to marinate a small package of chicken thighs overnight, then bake them on 350 degree for 1-1.5 hours.  Then I drained the grease, and put them on the grill with ribs.  It was very very delicious.  My father-in-law is a very good cook for BBQ ribs and chicken, and he gave great comments on those ribs I made and even asked for the recipe.  Thank you for sharing this great recipe.

This recipe is a good place to start - however I choose to change the following:  I boiled rather than baked the ribs in beer for one hour.  In addition I added the follwing items to the sauce:  1/2 cup liquid smoke, 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar, 1/2 cup honey, 1 Table Spoon Seasoning salt, 1 Table Spoon Onion Salt.  I also did not ad the Rum.  Everything else I followed and the ribs were fantastic.  I completed the meal with homemade bread & twice baked potatoes!  Yummy!!!

I took the advice of others and boiled the ribs first. I increased the rum slightly (only had coconut, and it was great!) also decreased the chile sauce by half and increased the ketchup. We're not big on super spicy, but it was just enough to give the ribs a slow warm kick. Yum! Oh! I also cut the brown sugar in half because others said it was too sweet - good decision! LOVE this recipe. It's a keeper!

This barbeque sauce is the best!  Make life easy - boil the ribs until they almost fall off the bone.  Then marinate them in this sauce overnight or even longer.  Then put in all in a pan and simmer for a 1/2 hour.  Easy and delicious.  I will never buy barbeque sauce again - the sauce is that good.

So easy, so good! The duration of the grill time is the same for corn on the cob and artichokes -- so I grilled everything at once and the meal could not be easier to orchestrate.  The marinade was absolutely perfect -- no adjustments required.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!!

This is the best rib recipe I've ever tried.  I did make a few changes though.  As per other reviews, I used the BBQ Dry Rub by Denise and put that on the ribs the night before.  I added cumin to this sauce (just because we like it) and I used Bacardi Limon rum because thats all I had on hand.  They came out fantastic!

I always cooked my spareribs in a slow cooker but decided to try this recipe because of all the great reviews.  I am so glad I did!  Yummy!!  I will be making them this way from now on...my husband had three helpings!!  I followed the recipe exactly but I heated the remaining sauce in a pan on the stove about 4-5 minutes until a little thicker and served with the ribs.  We cut up the ribs and poured the sauce over-top.  It was delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Wow - I had friends over unexpectedly and thought I would whip up some ribs. This is a great recipe even if you don't marinate overnight, and some of my friends used this as a dipping sauce, too! Hint: to get tender ribs, cut into the size you want to grill, layer in a deep pan with sliced lemons, add approximately 1 cup of water, tightly cover with foil, and bake at 350 degrees for 2-4 hours until tender. This works great! Also, for a bit of spice, add a couple of minced chili peppers - YUMMY! Thanks for the recipe, Kristy...

I am making these ribs tonight for the second time in a month.  They were a hit the first time so this time I am making more.  This is the only recipe for ribs I've tried, and my Texas husband and stepdaughter love them.  The sauce makes those silly bottled sauces seem, well, silly.  Just delicious.  I made them exactly according to the recipe, no changes.

Made these ribs last night and not reading the recipe through before starting I didn't have time to marinate.  I simmered the ribs for 1 hour, assembled the marinade and cooked it until thickened and then broiled the ribs basting frequently until nicely done.  Just delicious

Best ribs I've ever made at home!  The basting sauce is fantastic.  I only marinated the ribs for an hour, but will definitely have them sit overnight next time because I want more of that wonderful flavor!  I served with Grant's Famous BBQ Sauce from this site which I also found to be most awesome!  Thanks for sharing this Kristy!

I have made these ribs twice and both times my family loved them. The first time I finished them on the grill and the sugar burnt easily if I didn't watch them every second. I loved the texture when they were finished in the oven. I used brandy since I didn't have any rum and the flavor was very good. I do have one question, though. Do people wrap the ribs individually or in one big packet? I wrapped them individually, but that's alot of foil! My daughter loves to get ribs from a rib restaurant, but these are just as good and much less expensive.

This is the tangiest, tastiest recipe for ribs I've ever had! It's excellent on spare ribs and chicken. If it's too hot for you, simply cut the hot sauce in half.

The sauce itself is my all time favorite BBQ sauce. I use it on everything and my family absolutely loves it!

These ribs are fabulous as well as easy to make.  I now use this dish for potlucks and picnics.  We've found that the leftover ribs (a rare thing) freeze well and come out tasting just as good as they were the first time around.

Thanks Kristy for this very tasty recipe.  It was the first time I ever made barbeque ribs, and I chose your recipes out of the good rating that was given to your recipes, with a little skepticism, though.  However, the ribs turned out to be very delicious, all my friends and family loved it.  I would definitely repeat this recipe again in the future.  However, the sauce was a little too sweet.  I would cut down the amount of brown sugar a little the next time.  Thank you very much !!!!

These were fabulous!  I placed the oven baked ribs in the sauce for about 20 minutes after baking just to let them glaze a little, not marinate or anything, then grilled them for abvout 20 minutes while brushing the remaining sauce on them.  They were terrific!  Made them with the BLT salad on this site, loved the meal!

This must be the best recipe for barbecue ribs I have ever tried!!!  I've never liked using bottled barbecue sauce, and I was looking for a great recipe for homemade sauce.  I've found it!!This is definitely a recipe I will make for years to come!!

These were excellent!  I've been searching for a good rib recipe, and I finally found it.  These have a great taste and we really enjoyed them.  The only change I made was to add more garlic, as I cook everything with garlic!!  I will definitely make these again!

Wow, this was fantastic. OK, so it's not summertime, but I felt like ribs, and made mine with country ribs and baked rather than grilled them. Like others before me, I used "Denise's dry rub" prior to wrapping and the first bake...wonderful! Someone suggested bourbon, so I wanted to try that but didn't have any so substituted applejack. I'll make more sauce next time as it was great over mashed potatoes. The country ribs were extremely tender and delicious with this, we loved it, and it's definitely one I'll make again.

This recipe is pretty tasty, although I'm still looking for one that has more of the sticky carmelization that comes from a thick sauce with lots of sugar in it.  I will probably make these again because they are foolproof.

Okay, I signed up just so I could write a review.  I'm a 24 year old, never cooked anything and I decided to try this. 

Man was it easy and sooooooo good.  I used the dry rub before as some suggested.  I just did the hr marinade and it was wonderful.  I am going to make this for everyone since this is the only thing I can make.  I am right now trying the marinade overnight --- I bet it will be even better.

This is the best rib recipe I have ever tried. Most of the preparation is done ahead so it is very easy to serve for guests. I used baby back ribs and 4 lbs. only served three. (Perhaps we were just "porking" out.) Delicious!

Excellent recipe.  I did use a dry rub first, and only marinated for one hour and they were great.  Can't wait to try overnight in fridge, probably even greater flavour...thanks.

This recipe was incredible. I tweaked it a bit, adding a little less soy sauce and a bit more rum. I also added a dash of chili powder for a little extra spice. I found the best rum to use was a spiced rum, for that extra flavor.

Excellent recipe.  I followed as is except I cut the sugar in half, and I rubbed the ribs with a little smoked paprika before pouring on the sauce.  It is winter, so I cooked them in the oven with the sauce over - cooked at 225 degrees C for 5 hours (slow cooked).  Excellent sauce - thanks for sharing!

I have tried numerous recipes and used numerous commercial and home-made sauces, but this is #1. It's so easy it should be in a "Recipes for Dummies" book. My wife, who has been in the past very critical of some of the recipes I'vre tried, rates this #1.

I decided to take the advice of my fellow reviewers by boiling the ribs, rather than baking them. I did not have any rum at the time, so I used whiskey as a substitute. I used brown sugar and the grounded black pepper as instructed. The soy sauce I used was gluten free, since I'm trying to watch my glutes. I did not have any ketchup, chile sauce, or worcestershire sauce on hand, so I used some gormet spicy diana sauce instead. I used two teaspoons of garlic power, since I had no cloves. Dijon mustard seemed like a reasonable substitute for dry mustard. The outcome didn't smell that great, so I poured in a cup of maple syrup. Threw them into a few plastic bags in the refrigerator over night. The next day, oh my lord were those ribs amazing!! Great recipe! I'd recommend it to anyone looking for great meal at a family and friend BBQ.

I'd give it 5 stars if the recipe called for BBQ sauce instead of Ketchup. I followed the other reviewers suggestions and replaced the Ketchup with 2 C of BBQ sauce.

I was very confused about what kind of chile sauce to use... But I chose Maggi Sweet Chili Sauce (Thai). It turned out amazingly! Unfortunately, the high sugar content led to a little bit of scorching on the grill, which probably could've been avoided if I'd had a few less bellini's. ;) It was really delicious, regardless.

The combined baking & grilling cooking method rendered the most tender ribs that I've ever made. The marinade caramelizes and encrusts the tender meat, making a nice textural contrast with each bite. I used an Asian Sriracha for the chile sauce, which probably confused the palate; still there was a nice heat to the flavor. I just wish it was a tad sweeter.

Followed the sauce exact other than the chili vs chile debate.  I used a Trader Joes bottle of chili sauce.  This kicked up the flavor for sure, but they still had some sweetness and I liked it a lot.  I prefer to bake low temp for longer and indirect grill.  Always very tender but still on the bone.  The rest of my family still prefers tradition- hickory bbq sweet ribs so I can't give it 5 stars.

This was soooo yummy!  I'm a novice cook and my hubby is always a little skeptical whenever i make sauces but we both reallllly enjoyed this!  I didn't have red chile sauce - someone mentioned it was the same as enchilada sauce and someone else mentioned they used salsa - i only had green enchilada sauce so i used half that and half salsa.  I added more sugar to offset some of the salsa taste.  But it was very good!!  My ribs weren't fall f the bone tender - so next time i think i'll try cooking longer at a lower heat.  Great recipe!  Definitly make again!

Wow! Delicious! Just discovered this recipe two weeks ago for my first attempt at making ribs. We have had this three times thus far at my husband's request. I used 3/4 cup of bbq sauce instead of the rum and chile sauce. It was wonderful!!

This was indeed the best barbecue sauce I ever tasted. I used Jack Daniels instead of the rum. You can buy the little bottles that hold about 2/3 cup. Panama Jack, move over....You met your match

My husband loved these ribs but I for one was not WOWed by it. Made my own chile sauce using "Ten Minute Enchilada Sauce" as a guide. Served with pasta salad, "Roasted New Potatoes," and "Green Grape Salad."

YUMMY!  Finger-licking good!  Everybody loved it!  Will definitely make again!  I let the ribs sit in the marinade for about 2 hours in fridge before finishing them off in the oven.  Next time, I'll make them the night before to save time!

I don't usually like ribs but these were great.  We used baby back ribs & coconut rum.  We will add more cayenne to it next time because we like it extra spicy.  These were very easy to make and we are going to make them again in a few weeks.

TRY ADDING MALIBU (coconut flavored white rum) not rum, the taste is amazing!  The original recipe is v.good and tasty, but the malibu gives it another dimension.

I left out the rum, the ribs were still phenomenal. I also boiled the ribs the day before I needed them. The next day, I microwaved the mixture for about 3 minutes ,  then cut the ribs apart and placed them (all together) on cookie sheet length double-thick aluminum foil,  poured the sauce over them and  folded over the top of the coated ribs like a present, threw them on the grill for about 25 minutes at med/hi setting..  I need to make more next time.

my family and I loved this recipe along with my neighbors picky eating son. I followed the directions completely and the ribs were very tender. I read a few comments about first boiling your ribs, you dont boil ribs...They are not chicken legs?? The only thing I did differently was add my own dry rub to the ribs before wrapping and baking. Will definitely keep and share this recipe for a long time. Thaks!!

Made this for a group of friends and all raved they were the best ribs they ever had.  Boiled the ribs for an hour.  Put the ribs in ziploc bags with the sauce  for 24 hours and finished them off on the grill for about 30 minutes, turning frequently to prevent the sugar in the sauce from burning.  Outstanding! (Substituted some garlic powder for the garlic and used a dark rum)

Several people at my BBQ thought they were the best ribs they had ever had.  Bake the ribs at 200 degrees for about 3 or more hours for tenderness.  Boiling makes them chewy and baking at a higher temp makes them tough.  Anything cooked at a low temp for a long time will turn out tender.

Very nice ribs! My boyfriend gave these a 4 1/2 star rating. The sauce was really good! I used the Asian garlic chili sauce as well with great results. I didn't use the rum, and I added a squirt or two of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. The ribs did burn a bit on the grill, but they were still good. I wish the ribs were a little more tender (like my boyfriends are!) but maybe I'll try boiling them. Thanks for the recipe!

I do not eat meat. But I have a husband and a son that loves meat. It is really hard for me to cook meat when I can't taste it, so I relie on recipes. This one according to my boys is fantastic! the only thing I changed was that I boiled the ribs first. Then I marinated for a hour before I BBQ them. Great will use again.

Amazing, must make these. I boiled them for 1hr. They were very spicy/hot for my taste, so next time we will cut the chile sauce by 1/2. We grilled then on a charcoal grill over indirect heat for 25, and direct heat for 5. We also basted with the sauce every 5 min.

I made this for a quick dinner and the ribs were unbelievable. I can't believe how fast they were chowed down within 10 minutes by two hungry men. They mentioned it was so good and one said they were better than Lucille's b/c of the meat falling off the bone so easily. 
I basically used two stack of beef ribs at 5.3 lbs. I went for the safe side of boiling it first for 1 whole hour with some salt. Then made the sauce the way it's listd without the rum and used Sirachi chile sauce. I left a little bit of the boiled broth and marinated with the sauce on the ribs overnight. I always suggest doing it warm so it can absorb all the flavor. Then I baked it the next night at 350. Brought up the heat at the last moment so it was quite warm but not too hot to touch. Dinner was served and yummy! I would do it again and would use rum this time and try it with pork too!

So i took the advice of many of the other reviewers and changed quite a bit in this recipe.  I only used 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 cup BBQ sauce, 2 teaspoons minced garlic, 3 teaspoons chili powder, and 1/4 cup rum. It turned out EXCELLENT.  My husband LOVED it, he thought i bought it pre-seasoned. haha.  Now i also cooked it differently because i am not very good on the grill.  I cut the ribs into portion sized sections and layed them out on foil. I then took 1/4 cup applesauce and covered them.  I double wrapped them in tin foil and put in the oven at 250 F for 2 1/2 hours.  Then i took out, marinated for an hour and put back in for 30 minutes (marinateding again 1/2 way through).  they turned out VERY tender and delicious!!

A little too sweet for me but they came out great as far as falling off the bone.  I will definitely try this recipe again but maybe cut back a little bit on the sweetness and add something to up the spice.

10 stars, a million, oh my god these were soooo good.  I will never use another bbq sauce on ribs.  Oh my god, seriously, SO good.  I did boil my ribs for the 1st part of the cook time, but I think that's a personal preference thing.  It's the sauce that makes these ribs, and wow, it makes them GOOD!!  (And I don't even like ribs!!)

Very good!  I think the 1 1/2 hour baking time was too long because the ribs were a bit dry, but otherwise delicious!  I omitted the rum and used red curry paste instead of the chili sauce because that's what I had on hand.  I will definitely make this again!!

Killer ribs! Great! Easy! (well, i asked my husband to make the sauce) - and he did it very well!  The last time I made them, we were running out of chili sauce, so we substituted it with jarred spicy pasta sauce - and it worked really great too!

The best barbeque rib recipe ever! I also boiled the ribs in 3 parts beer and 1 part water for 1 hour.  I added 2 Tbls. of liquid smoke and omitted the rum from the sauce. Let the ribs marinate in the sauce for a few hours & the grilled the meat for 20 minutes. Wow!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

A real winner!  I followed some of the advice of others and boiled the ribs for about 1 hour.  I made 3 lbs. of ribs for my family of 4 and they were clamoring for more.  Tonight I'm making it for my extended family and trying the marinade on chicken as well.

The recipe as is is too bland and sweet. I make 2x the recipe, use 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup molasses instead of 2 cups of sugar. 
I also would suggest using half the asian style chili sauce that others mention, and half the 'ketchup' style one. 
I too baked them and boiled them and the baked ones are a ton better. 2.5 hours at 325 F using some simple dry rub recipe (don't think it matters which).

I made this recipe for our family memorial day picnic and it was a huge success.  Everyone said they were the best ribs that they have ever had.  Will definitely be making this one again.  I doubled the sauce and served the extra heated with them.  They sure went fast....I was looking forward to leftovers though, so maybe they were to good.  Thanks for the terrific recipe.

Delicious! I boiled the ribs to speed things up, otherwise I made the recipe as listed. They were a hit at the dinner party. I'm anxious to try them again, but this time I will bake.

This recipe finally got me to join, so I could submit this review. The only thing I did differently was cooked the BBQ sauce on the burner, so I could use as a dipping sauce afterwards. Making again this weekend!

Edit: Didn't realize I had already reviewed this. I've been using this for years now (for the sauce, not the cooking method, I smoke my ribs), by far my favourite rib sauce.

This recipe was awesome! I usually don't try to make ribs at home, but with this recipe, it's cheaper and better than ordering them out.

Very good sauce!  As soon as I saw rum it was a must. I followed the ingredients to a T. May cut the sugar next time and mine were hot hot hot!  After eating I realized I used a spicy Korean hot sauce (not ur normal "red hot" sauce) - my bad but would use 3/4 the amount next time.  I initially baked them at 250 for about 2 1/2 hours.  Marinated all day then baked about 45 minutes at night. The sauce had more of an Asian flare than a traditional BBQ sauce. I think this would be great for chicken kabobs w/ pineapple or a different type of hot wings! Not the best "cooking instructions" for me but the sauce is a 5. Thank you! Cheers 8-)

This was my first attempt making ribs and they turned out great!  I let mine marinate in the sauce overnight before grilling.  One piece of advice: the sugar in the barbecue sauce could cause the ribs to burn easily, so watch them closely.

WOW!  I modified the recipe a little where I boiled the ribs for 30 min ( I was in a time crunch!) and then let them soak in the sauce for an hour at room temp. Then I grilled them 9 min. on each side and they turned out amazing!  Great recipe!

I basically used this recipe for the sauce, as I don't cook my ribs this way. I left out the rum and didn't have quite as much brown sugar as called for. It tasted a little too much like an Asian sauce instead of a barbecue sauce, so hubby suggested I add a little liquid smoke. Then it was perfect. I'll never use bottled bbq sauce again.

I made this twice. The boys loved it. The bones just came off the meat. I rubbed the ribs with some Lawry's seasoned salt, paprika and chilli powder before baking  in the oven. ran out of brown sugar so used maple syrup instead. Marinated overnight before throwing it on the grill..SOOOOOO GOOOOD.

I've only made these once and they were a hit with my family and our friends. I will definetly make these again.  I may try cutting down the brown sugar by half.  I did boil my ribs for about an hour and a half.  Try this one...you'll like it.

Wow!  This was a fabulous recipe.  I made it for July 4th.  My boyfriend and I loved them.  I followed the recipe to the T, except I didn't have any dry mustard so used some prepared dijon instead.  

I made the quantity of ribs suggested.  We had 4 left for the next day.  JUST 4!

This was great.  I boiled the ribs instead, because that is what my parents always do.  I followed everything else like the recipe.  We loved them.  Took a couple extras to the neighbors for a taste.  They came back asking for the recipe.  Thanks

This will definitely replace my old rib recipe.  Delicious flavor.  I marinated the oven-cooked ribs in the sauce for about 1 hour but would probably do longer next time.  Also, be sure to peel the 'skin' off the back of the ribs before cooking.  My hubby likes extra sauce for everything so I may make extra and cook it down on the stove next time to accompany the ribs.  Great recipe!

Wow, these are delicious.  It was my first time making ribs too.  MMMM.  I followed other's tips and I put the ribs in my turkey roaster instead of the tin foil.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly - oh, except all I had was coconut rum.  It was great.   Thanks for sharing.

This sauce was great!  I was worried about the rum at first since I'm not a drinker. I kept tasting it over and over again to be sure.(haha) I slow cooked beef ribs and let marinate for about 2 hours before grilling. We loved them!

This sauce is excellent!  I always boil my ribs until the meat in falling off the bones.  This make them real tender.  I didn't have garlic cloves so I used a half tsp of garlic powder.  I also didn't have chile sauce so I used a tsp. of chili powder.  Turned out great!  This will be the sauce that I use from now on.

Wow, I am really sorry to rate these a 3. I had very high hopes. First of all, I just thought that the marinade was a bit strange. I made it exactly to recipe. I did cook them differently by first placing them in water and boiling until they turned white, then placed them in the crockpot with the sauce. They were fall apart tender, but the taste was a bit odd. We salvaged them by smothering with bottled barbecue sauce. We had leftovers and my kids that are rib fanatics told me to throw them out! I think we will go back to Sylvia's Ribs or one of the other good ones on this site. Thanks anyway for the post.

I followed the recipe exactly and finished them on the grill. They turned out dry and charred since the sugar in the marinade burned on the grill.

This was an excellent recipe! I followed a number of changes in other reviews, and it turned out just great - the meat was VERY tender! My boyfriend normally does not eat pork, and he absolutely loved it! Here are the changes I made: omit rum, half the brown sugar, double the ketchup and instead of chili sauce, use 1 tsp chili powder. Just excellent! Thanks Kristy.

I've had a couple of days to mull this over, and I guess I just wasn't that impressed. I don't know what I was expecting, but this didn't taste any different (to me) than bottled sauce - and the bottled sauce is probably a little bit cheaper. The good advice was to bake the ribs first (other recipes call for boiling - which completely ruin the ribs)

This recipe doesn't need another review saying it's fabulous, but . . . it's fabulous!  
I had never made ribs before and was a little intimidated, but I decided to make these for company & everyone was so impressed!  
Following some other reviewers' suggestions, I used dry rub before baking them (in large foil baking bags rather than making my own packets), then marinated them overnight.  Before serving, I warmed them in a 250 degree oven for about 30-45 min, to make sure they were heated through before going on the grill.  They only need about 15 min. on the grill to finish them off.  
They are a bit of work the night before (esp. if you are also making the dry rub), but very little work the day you serve them, so they're great for barbecues with guests.  They were delicious and so tender.  My husband is addicted!

These were Great!  I fixed them to eat during the Super Bowl, Everyone loved them, even the kids. Better then any restuarant we've ever had ribs at.I baked them in the oven because neither my husband or I wanted to cook them outside in the freezing cold and snow. I can't wait to try them in the spring cooked on the grill.

Excellent! I followed the directions exactly. I did not use the rum because I didn't have any and they still turned out great. I marinated over night. My family went crazy over them.

I've always been afraid to make ribs because they usually come out tough. I decided to try this recipe and they were a total hit...tender, flavorful, not too sweet...very good. Definately a "keeper."

Absolutely delicious.  Made it last night for my hubby and two boys.  They were licking it from their fingers it was so good.  And so easy to make.  I'm making more for a camping trip this weekend.  It's something that will also taste good on chicken and a dab on burgers.  I did not add the rum since we didnt have any and it still tasted great!  I bet the rum would make it even better.  Great recipe!!!

Fabulous.  I'm a rib novice, but this was easy and tasted wonderful.  I did the same thing as another reviewer -- used Chinese chili & garlic sauce in place of the two separate ingredients.  I also found that unlike the author, I loved the sauce as a dipping sauce.  We used babyback ribs, and found that 20 min. was a better cooking time.  Terrific recipe!

Great recipe!!!  We had a family rib cook-off and these took the prize.  Only change from the recipe was that rather than cooking them in the marinade for the last 30 minutes, I grilled them on Medium.  Can't wait to make them again.

YUM YUM YUM!  These ribs were jsut thr right combination of sweet and spicy, and the rum added a gourmet touch.  I used the recipe to marinate and baste 6.5 pounds of ribs and I had plenty to spare.  I used chile sauce with garlic from the Asian foods aisle, and omitted the 2 cloves.  I shared this recipe with my sisters and mom, and will make them again and again and again.  They were perfect for our family 4th of July picnic!

ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE recipe.  We've been trying to make barbeque ribs like these for so long.  I've tried everything from boiling the ribs ahead of time, but they never came tender like this.  Now I know the secret!

The sauce tastes wonderful too.

I'd give this recipe 10 stars if I could.  

Thank you so much for an amazing one!

I WILL NEVER USE ANOTHER BARBECUE SAUCE AGAIN!!! I've even run short on a few ingredients and I compensated by adding more of a similar (ie: less ketchup more chili sauce) and it still comes out just as good. You just can't mess this recipe up!

I've made this recipe three times now and love it!  However, last weekend I didn't have the chile sauce, and I was out of rum!  Since I live far from a store, I substituted hot ketchup and chile powder for the chile sauce, and about 3 Tablespoons of Jack Daniels for the rum.  My boyfriend said they were the best I've made.  Thanks Kristy!

This recipe is almost too easy.  I've made them several times now.  In my most recent "version" (mistake), I forgot to cook them the night before.  So I cooked them in a baking pan, in the sauce, and wrapped in foil in a 250 degree oven for about a couple hours.  Then I take them out and finish them unwrapped as in the original recipe.  They weren't fall-off-the-bone style, but were very tender, and eaten very quickly.
     Oh, for those who had trouble with them sticking to the foil, try the new Reynold's Wrap "Release" foil.  They won't stick.

The best ribs I've ever had. I've made this twice in the past week, once with baby back ribs and once with beef ribs and it was excellent. I did cut back on the chile sauce by half (so it wouldn't be too spicy for my 3 year old)and I left out the rum. I would have given this 10 stars
it was that awesome!!!!

I made this recipe on Sunday for a dinner party.  I did not have any extra.  It was so good and easy.  This is my new way of making ribs.

These were tender and the flavor was good.  I wish the sauce was thicker, though.

These were the most succulent ribs I have ever eaten. I did leave out the chile sauce and added some hoisin sauce and a touch of ginger. I also added some cloves of garlic during the initial baking. My three year old wouldn't stop eating these till they were gone! Definately a keeper!

Didn't have any chili sauce, so used an asian chili paste. Gave it a nice zing! Best barbecue sauce I have ever had. 
Can't comment on the ribs in this recipe. I made baby back, marinated them overnight in this sauce, then cooked them at 250 for 5 hours wrapped in foil. Throw on the grill with more sauce for about 10-12 minutes. MMMMMMM!

Amazing recipe. I didn't have any ribs, so I used chicken thighs. I breaded them in a mixture of buttermilk, fresh dill, flour, and egg whites. I then fried them and served with fresh, homestyle-biscuits. I highly recommend this recipe.

Joel was in heaven with these. Follow the recipe as per notes except: Boiled from thawed and marinated for 4 hrs. Did not let ribs marinate after boiling.Used: Irrestitibles Chicken & Rib BEER Marinade & Grilling Sauce - it was fabulous, not too sweet. To Make Again.

This was delicious.  I boiled the rib for 1 hour and then I made the rub by Denise and baked for a further 3 hours at 275 degrees.  It just fell off the bone!

These were delicious. I was skeptical about the sauce bc at first it didn't taste like a bbq sauce but it was great! 

I cut into individual pcs (2 ribs per) cooked the ribs meat side down in double wrapped tin foil at 225 degrees for 4 hrs. They were very tender but I think next time I will cook at 200 degrees for 5 hrs. I then marinaded them in gallon Baggie over night in fridge.

Marinade calls for chili sauce, I used 2tsp chili powder and 1tbsp of Siracha. They weren't spicy but had small kick. 

Then grilled them the next day on top rack on low heat for about 15 min, they didn't need any longer then that. Finally before serving I basted them with the remaining marinade from the Baggie and served the rest of the sauce in a bowl. Yummy!

The first time I try a recipe, I always follow it to the letter.
There won't be any changes made to this one; it's just perfect.
Gooey, delicious sauce and very tender meat.

Not too shabby!  Loved the sauce! it made the meal.  As a rib guy, however, the oven/boiling method is a bit generic for my house.  Boiling kills the natural pork rib flavor and oven cooking wastes time that could be spent smoking.  My recommendation is to slow smoke and then start adding the sauce for the last 30-45 minutes of smoking.

When my boys finished with this, all I had left was a Fred Flintstone-like pile of bones. I didn't use the rum, and used a tangy chili sauce instead of chile sauce, and it was delicious. The neighbor even came over to see what smelled so good! I baked them and they were plenty tender but after reading reviews I will try boiling next time.

On our grill it only needed 15 minutes. We boiled the ribs first as the others suggested. The sauce was great.

I loved the sauce.  I couldn't find chile sauce so I used 1/2 Heinz Chili Sauce and 1/2 Lousiana Hot Sauce.  Delish.  I was in a hurry to make this for a weeknight dinner so I took a shortcut.  I cut the ribs into individual ribs, boiled them for 20 minutes, then fried in oil for 2-4 minutes (until brown).  Then I sauteed all fried ribs on the stove with the sauce for about 10 minutes.  We ate and loved it.  No the meat was not falling off the bone because I took this shortcut, but it was very good still.  Next time, I'll try this using the method in the instructions ... maybe on a weekend when I have more time.  But the sauce is very delicious and my family really loved it.

These were AMAZING ribs.  My husband and kids loved them and they are the pickiest eaters around!  I didn't use Chile sauce because I couldn't find it in my grocery store so I just used some Crystal hot sauce and regular BBQ sauce in it's place as another reviewer suggested.  And I boiled the ribs instead of baking them. Still came out great!! These will be a great addition to our grill menu.

I give it a 4 only because I made some changes. I read some other reviews and boiled them for a half hour (unfrozen) before I marinated them. I did marinate them for an hour but next time I will try for over night. I didn't have any chili sauce so just used BBQ sauce but it still turned out fantastic.  So I cut the ribs up into groups of two, put them in water at high temp and then brought them to rapid boil, once boiling, I lowered the temp to a simmer and left uncovered for a half hour. Then marinated for an hour before BBQing for a half hour, I might try just cooking for 20 min next time as well. They were so good my boyfriend said it was the best thing I have ever cooked lol and I cook a lot!!

Amazing rib sauce! I boiled the ribs for a little over an hour, basted them with marinade then grilled them for about 10 minutes rather than the suggested 30 minutes as they started to char. I used half the amount of rum due to some reviews suggesting it was a little strong which turned out great. Will definitely be making them again!

I have been looking for a really good recipe for ribs!  This is it!!  I'm so happy.  I did the boiling method.  Sorry to the reviewer who said never boil ribs.  I've actually done that before with other rib recipes and found that it really tenderizes them and it does cut some of the fat.  So I'm going against that advice because it works for me.  I didn't have any chili sauce so substituted some Sweet Baby Rays and some hot sauce.  The sauce makes it.  I grilled them but I'm sure if the weather was bad that the oven would work for finishing them off.  The sauce is killer!

Best ribs ever!  I didn't have chile sauce so I substituted ketchup and frank's red hot. 
Also, I only marinated them for about 20 minutes using a vacuum sealed instant marinator. Yum!

I baked the ribs just like the recipe said. And then marinated them but could not find the Chile Sauce where I live so I just didn't use it. They turned out fabulous! My boyfriend said they are the BEST ribs he has EVER had! We will absolutely make these again! Very different from the original BBQ ribs

I made these one week ago wtih spare ribs as called for in the recipe, and they were really good, but didn't love the spare rib part of it. I made them again this weekend with baby back ribs and they were amazing!!! I may have used slightly less rum due to quantity on hand, and I did use Denise's dry rub on this site before baking, but everything else just as called for in recipe. They taste like they were professionally cooked at a restaurant. My new favorite rib recipe!!

Pretty tasty!!  I am definatly going to try this recipe again, I only let the ribs sit for one hour, and I don't think they set up quite right.  So I would definatly reccomend overnight!

I used the Dry Rub for Ribs from this site as others did before baking.  This recipe was great and pretty easy to make.  I did not have dry mustard so I used the mustard I had in the bottle.  I did not have chili sauce so I made some out of 1/2 cup ketchup, 1/2 tsp Chiptole Chile Powder and 1/2 tsp  Ground Cayenne Red Pepper, it had a nice little kick you could use less if you wanted.  It was 1/2 cup which was alot so I decided to make my own instead of skipping it.  Other than that I followed the instructions.    Grilling is the only way to go if you have a grill.  I made two batches one for last night and then I put the rest in ziploc bags to marinate overnight.

My wife has raved about some of the recipes I've made from this site, but she tells me these ribs 'kick the butte' of everything I've done so far.  I know what I'm going to be cooking for every Tennessee game from now on.  Thanks friend!!

Great easy recipe!  We did not put them on the grill for the second cooking, but we cooked them in a jelly roll pan with tin foil underneath the ribs at 350 for like 30 minutes and they were tender, and absolutey wonderful!  I have to send my friend the recipe right now!

This is coming from someone that does not like ribs.  This recipe is excellent!  I have to say I used a chili garlic sauce (which made it spicy) and dark brown sugar but it turned out great.  I am definitely using this recipe again.  I cleaned the ribs down to the bone.

Very Good!  Husband raved over them.  I know that if they had been on a grill they would have rocked but it was cold and I was looking for a good recipe for the oven and this was it.  I had to make a homemade chile sauce since I didnt have any on hand and did not have rum (but used 1/2tsp rum exract) but hoping to make exactly as written next time minus the rum (personal choice).  Very tasty. I enjoyed them more after they sat and rested and cooled off I think. The flavors seemed to have come together more at that point.  Thank you for a great oven rib recipe!

We weren't really loving these... and think it's just because of the cooking method. Would love to try again (I'll try anything again if it has rum in it!), just boil or slow cooker or something next time. Also I think the grill time is too long, our ribs were black when we got them off.

I have never written a review, but I have to comment on this recipe.  It makes amazing ribs.  I basted the ribs with part of the sauce mixture before wrapping in foil to bake. Also, I didn't have chili sauce or rum, so I left those out, but the ribs were delicious.

This was my first attempt at making ribs. I made them for my dad, husband, and brother in-law for father's day. Everyone loved these ribs and commented on  how wonderful the sauce was. Not too overpowering like store bought barbecue sauce. And they were so tender the meat was falling off the bone! Ah, success! I will definately make this again.

These ribs are awesome!  The only modification I make is that I simmer on low them in a stout beer for about 45 minutes instead of cooking them in the oven.  I always get compliments when I make these.

Good sauce, which we love. I season ribs with salt, pepper, garlic powder, double wrap in foil and toss in oven for 2 1/2hrs, then grill to crisp saucing at the end...ribs fell off the bone.....while grilling off to the side in aluminum dish put soaked hickory chips....delish.....

If I hadn't burnt them, I'm sure they would have been great!  They were still good, but the chile sauce was a bit much for me... just personal preference I guess.

I'm giving 4 stars for the sauce, it's delicious, but the ribs came out chewy versus tender & falling apart.  They were edible, and still good, but we were really hoping for falling off the bone tender.  I might try this again and boil the ribs as some of the reviewers suggested.

The ribs were good....  I like a little sweetness, but this was a bit too sweet for me, I should have known from looking at the amount of sugar.  I too, boiled  the ribs instead of baking, then grilled, and they were nice and tender.  Needs some tweaking, less sugar, something's missing...  Don't get me wrong, they were still good.  Thanks

Followed previous reviewers, I boiled the ribs for about an hour.  These were a HUGE hit.  Awesome.  I did marinade over night. Served with Down Home Macaroni and Cheese from this site. YUM!

I used country style pork ribs and followed the recipe exactly.  While the barbeque sauce is excellent, the pork ribs were overcooked and dried out out from the hour and a half in the oven.  Perhaps they need to be cooked less in the oven??

I made these for a Super Bowl party and they were a HUGE hit. So tender-- and boiling them before hand is definitely the key. I thought they were slightly too sweet, so I'll cut down a little bit on the sugar. Other than that-- absolutely delicious!

I'll put it to this way. 6lbs Pork Ribs.  3 Messy Kids and a great family meal on a Sunday night.  The sauce is the best I have ever tested, and the ribs were fabulous.  Next time I will let them boil a little longer as I only did 60 minutes, but it was touch and go. 

Even when it's only 20' outside, I put them on the grill and quite honestly I could have made another 4lb.  PS. My kids are young and they look forward to getting messy enjoying these types of foods.

I used this recipe and it was the best ribs I have ever cooked. I boiled the ribs for one hour before grilling instead of the baking in the oven. The sauce is just right with a little bit of chili powder added, and once the mixture was complete I added 6 ounces of Fat Tire Beer. I will use this as my recipe from now on.

These are the best ribs, ever. I can my own chili sauce (a family favorite) and used it for this recipe.

These are drop dead good ribs.  Period.

i made these tonight for tomorrow's dinner but there may be none left.   boiled with garlic, ginger, salt and hot peppers for 40 minutes.  tried to make sauce as directed but used packet of chinese mustard instead of dry and vietnamese chili garlic sauce (2 tbsp) because thats all i had on hand. wrappped in foil and cooked 2.5 hrs on 250 then broiled to dry out. yum!

Didn't think it was going to be good because I thought the smell of the sauce was bad but after cooking in my slow cooker half the day, when I ate it it was amazing. It was so good! Thank you.

UPDATE:  I tried the baby backs and I think I liked the St. Louis style better.  The baby backs seemed dry. These ribs are so tasty!  I did do the bake them for 1 1/2 hours and marinated overnight.  The only problem I had was that it took 2 hours to bake them a second time in my oven.  I was afraid to grill them because I have had bad times with this in the past and considering that I had to bake them for 2 hours I was glad to let the oven do all the work.  They did end up very tender.  Maybe I didn't package them small enough or maybe my ribs were too thick.  I will try this with baby backs sometime and see how that turns out.

Absolutely delicious.  Should have boiled the ribs longer to soften them up a bit more (I used large, meaty ribs), but the sauce was fabulous.

The boys kept coming back for more. I change things up a little. Instead of baking the ribs to cook, I boiled them for about an hour. I then marinated the ribs in the sauce for an hour while waiting on my guests to arrive. Then placed all (ribs and sauce) in the oven to bake at 350 for 1/2 hour or so. Meat fell off the bone. Everything turned out wonderfully!

I followed the recipe to a tee.  The only thing I changed was that I boiled the ribs for about an hour before I set them to marinate overnight.  Then while grilling I soaked them with bbq sauce Simply Fantastic!!  Thank you.

This is an excellent recipe and I use it whenever I make ribs. I also use Spiced Rum instead of original. Make sure you wipe the ribs dry before you put them on the grill. If you don't they will steam instead of grill. Grill for 30 Minutes and brush with BBQ sauce the whole time. YUM!

The sauce is soooo good!  I simmered the sauce to use for dipping and have some left over that I can't wait to try on chicken.  I didn't have any rum so I used some leftover white wine.  I used Red Rooster hot sauce but cut the amount in half because I was worried it would be too hot for my mom.  She loved it but was glad that I didn't put the full amount in.  I'd love to know what chili sauce others are using.

I made these ribs for Easter dinner and they were fantastic!  They rival any ribs I've ever eaten in a restaurant.  I made them for my husband, my brother in law, and two visiting friends - all guys in their 20's.  Everyone loved them.  We're excited to try the marinate on other meats.  Best recipe I've found on this site so far.

These were very good!  Even for me who's weakness is normally ribs.  The whole family loved them.  The only change I made was boil the ribs for about 15 minutes before doing everything else.  Other than that I didn't change anything.

This was my first experience cooking ribs.  I'm so glad I found this recipe!!  I do boil the ribs instead of baking as other reviewers have suggested.  If I boil for about 2 hours, the meat just falls off the bone.  I marinate them overnight & grill when ready to serve.  Everyone raves over these ribs!!

Very flavorful...I too, boiled the ribs first vs baking.  I boiled them in apple juice, then marinated them for a couple of hours.  Very good!  It's a recipe you can prepare in advance, especially if you are taking it somewhere later.  I will add to my recipe file...thanks!

These ribs were awesome. I put the whole rack in a foil oven bag and cooked them for a couple of hours until fork tender the day before. The day I was serving I made the sauce, cut the ribs into individual pieces and poured the sauce on top before placing them on grill basting with excess sauce. Everyone raved about them. I'll definetly make the again.

These were the best ribs I have ever made. Moist, tangy, delicious!  I know what ribs I'll be serving at my b-b-q's this summer. I've made these numerous times and will only make them from now on.

I served these to a room full of BBQ kings and they ALL said these were the best ribs they had ever had! Sweet with the baked in BBQ taste. I basted these constantly during the grilling process. A definite keeper!

I brought this dish to a summer potluck and they were all gone!  I separated each rib for easy sharing and followed the recipe using only the oven.  It was delicious.  I used dark rum and was worried about it being too strong.  By the time I served it, the flavours came together nicely.

This recipe is fantastic!  It is a hit every time.  I use country style ribs and bake them with the marinade and let them sit over night in the refrigerator.  Then I use the remaining liquid from baking dish or make a little more marinade for basting on the grill.

Thank you so much for sharing your recipe.

This marinade was so amazing! Don't let the combination of ingredients fool you- once cooked (we cooked the rack of ribs wraped in foil on the grill) it tastes so yummy- the meat was falling off the bone-  my new favorite BBQ rib recipe. Thank you so much!

I am SO glad I found this recipe for our Fourth of July bbq - These are the best ribs we have ever made, everyone loved them. And getting the prep/baking done the night before made the holiday alot less stressful. We used a rub before baking, but next time we may try a rub with a little more kick to it. The marinade/sauce was excellent and these ribs were so tender. We will definitely use this recipe whenever we make ribs.

These were definately the best ribs I have ever had!  I tried the marinade twice: once, for an hour (very tasty, semi-tender) and once overnight (AWESOME flavor, the meat fell off the bone!)  I tried once with sweet Asian chili sauce and the second time with chili paste - both were very good.  I didn't use the rub, but I cannot believe how good these ribs came out!

Lets just say they were sooo tender that when I picked them up to put them on the BBQ, some of the bones fell off into the pit. I loved the flavor, except I guess I used a really HOT hot sauce. No one in the family was able to eat it, even I had problems trying to eat it. But I am sure it will be wonderful, just with less hot sauce. Thanx :)

I used this recipe in the crockpot for spareribs and I think it would be great for meatballs as well. I cooked the ribs in a roaster pan on 350 for 45 min and then put them in the crockpot on low for about 4 hours. I loved the sauce. Great recipe.

Wow...I have found my all time favorite food.  This is easy, tasty, never order in a restaurant again, kind of recipe!  I just cut two racks of baby back ribs in two, sprinkled with a little garlic powder and red pepper and placed them in a baking dish, poured the amazing sauce over them and covered in foil.  I cooked them for about an hour and a half, then let them sit for about a half hour and finished them on the barbecue.  Oh my...served with coleslaw and roast potatoes.  This one is fabulous.  Thanks for sharing!  PS  I used a spiced rum.

This is the third time I have made these and they are just the best! The first time, I made it exactly like the recipe. It was much too spicy. After that, I cut back on the chili sauce to about a 1/4 cup. It was just right. My family just raves about these ribs. Used the country ribs and only baked them for about an hour. Finished them off the on grill the next day.

OMG!!!!  Awesome Ribs!  
Long story here.  I have a recently divorced friend whose husband ALWAYS did the "meat".  As a result, she did all the sides, and doesn't know how to cook the meat.  We have spent the last year getting together every 2 weeks, and grilling, roasting, broiling etc...
She called yesterday to say that she had bought ribs, but, how to cook?  Ex-hubby always boiled before grilling.  I came to my favorite recipe site and found this amazing recipe!  The only thing's we changed were, no worcestershire(she doesn't like it), didn't have the chili sauce(used 1/4 c. ketchup and a healthy sprinkle of cayenne, and doubled the garlic and black pepper.  We had to bake in the oven due to 5 inches of snow, but can't wait to try it on the grill!  She has decided that she will make ribs ALL the time using this technique!  As a matter of fact, So will I!  YUMMY!!!

This is, "flat out", the best recipe for ribs.  The only thing I do that's different is I put more garlic in the sauce (just a preference).  Nobody should be intimidated at trying this. Thanks Kristy!

I wanted to make BBQ ribs, and wanted to use something more flavorful than a store bought sauce.  I tried it, and don't think I'll ever go back!  I got many KISSES from the fiance for a great meal!

Very good! Thanks to the other reviewers, I too used only 1/2 the amt. of brown sugar and it was sufficient!  Where it called for chili sauce I used half chili sauce and half of the chinese style chili garlic sauce which added a kick.  I was also using baby back ribs and I thought the 1 1/2 hrs to bake was too long.  Next time I will do it for an hour.  After letting the ribs sit in the marinade I only put them under the broiler for 10 minutes basting them.  It added a BBQ crispness.  We will use the recipe again.  Thanks Kristy!

Wonderful flavor!!  I followed one reviewer's advice and added a little cornstarch afterwards to thicken up the marinade for basting and it didn't turn out well at all.  I had to throw it away.  The marinade thickens on the grill as you baste it.  I did make some change and that was adding about 1/4 cup of lemon juice to the marinade and I also substituted chile powder and hot sauce for the chile sauce cuz I didn't have any on hand.

I made this for a family gathering. I thought it was extremely easy, and the ribs were extremely tender. I did add a few more cloves of garlic to the sauce to give it a little more kick. I hope you enjoy!

These were really excellent! I could not find any rum in the house and so I substituted whiskey. Still very tasty. I recommend them!

Excellent, excellent, excellent!  No extra sauce required.  The meat was so tender and the flavor excellent.  I made these for my mom and she thought they were the best ribs she ever had!  Definitely a keeper!

These were pretty good, but I have tasted better.  I followed the recipe exactly except instead of baking or grilling, I cooked them in the slow cooker.

My ex-husband has always said that you can never make "restaurant quality" ribs at home because the restaurants must use a really good quality meat, plus their grills are better, etc., etc., etc.  Well, that gave me a challenge to find the perfect rib recipe.  THIS IS IT!!    I got total enjoyment watching him and my daughter eat these ribs down to the bone.  This is definitely a keeper and I won't make ribs any other way.

The ingredient combination of the marinade/grilling sauce is out of this world and makes the ribs so tender! The rum must help tenderize the meat, so don't leave it out. I've tried alot of marinades and this one IS IT :)

I paired this with the recommended dry rub recipe and the ribs were very tender and flavorful!  The only criticism is that they were a bit sweet, but they were still delicious.  I might add a little less sugar next time.  Everyone loved them!  Great recipe

I have to admit that I was eager to try this recipe, with all of the good reviews. Boy was I disappointed. I should have known better than to try to grill anything with a tomato-based sauce. All the ribs wanted to do was burn. I also think that the sauce needed a lot of help. I would have been better baking first then marinating and grilling with KC Masterpiece or something like an instant maranade and not put anything tomato-based on until right at the end. I hate to give a bad review, but this recipe could have been a lot better. Sorry!

I've tried to cook ribs in the past and when I was going to again, my wife said let's just pick them up at Famous Dave's.  I looked on this site and found this recipe and cooked them anyway.  They were the best ribs we ever had!  Very easy to prepare and VERY good.

This recipe is great!  I don't exactly measure anything, I season to taste.  These seasonings work great together.  If you don't have dry mustard, equal amounts of yellow prepared mustard works just great.  Grilling after baking is the best method, just enought to get the grilled flavor is fine.  I use baby back ribs.  GREAT!!!!!

This recipe is great. I used spiced rum and babyback ribs. It turned out wonderful! The sauce burns pretty quickly though, so becareful how much you put on at once. Although it was not quick, i still gave 5 stars in that category because that fact was known ahead of time.

This is an excellent recipe. I made it for my boyfriend (I don't usually cook meat) and he said, "I take it all back, you're an excellent cook." I added the rubbed pepper and salt and then pineapple as one reviewer suggested. Worked fabulous!

My husband was looking for a recipe on ribs so I printed this one for him to try.  Sounded really great.  He tried it. The next day after the 30 minute bake we went to the park to eat and fell in live with it.  It's very delicious and I recommend it to anyone.  My 4 year old even liked it and she's a very picky eater.

I marinated the ribs over night and took them on our river trip. Yummy Yummy Yummy. We even actually ate the left overs, which we never do.
The only thing I would do different next time is use Baby Back Ribs.

Great sauce and tender! I really only used the sauce as I boiled the ribs for an hour as suggested and then baked it at 350 degrees for an hour and finished with a 5 min broil. The sauce is great tho!

First, thanks to jimmyYX357 for convincing me not to try boiling the ribs (I was worried they’d be dry/tough as some reviewers said.)  I added a few slices of lime to each foil packet and made sure to seal the foil up tight.  They came out moist and tender.

The sauce phenomenal ... just make a side note that the baking process (90 minutes) is a relative time and to wait (because of variances in thickness) that time to be extended until the meat begins to withdraw from the bone more than just a little)

Couldn't find chile sauce used 1/2 ground chili paste (spicy) and half chili sauce.  I cooked the ribs an extra 30 min. in the oven and they were tender, Put on outside grill and it only took 15 min.; had a hot fire, watch the sugar can burn easily.

The best tasting barbeque ever! I didn't have any dry mustard, so I used regular mustard. I used minced garlic instead of cloves. Thos recipe will be used for a lifetime. So Amazing & delicious!

This was sooo good!  I love that this isn't just typical ribs with bbq sauce (SNOOZE).  I'm not a huge fan of spicy food, so I left out the chili sauce, and the marinade/glaze was still absolutely delicious.  To think, I was about to delete this recipe before making it too.  I'm so glad I didn't!

However I have made some changes. I use Huy Fong chili sauce which already has tons of garlic. So I don't add more garlic. Also you don't need quite as much of that chili sauce. I also add some ginger. Also when pre cooking the ribs I cook at 225 for 6 hours.

I’ve been making this consistently for about two years now.  It is by far the best recipe I have ever used.  Whenever I deviate to try something else my husband will say “next time can we just go back to your awesome rib recipe?”  Haha, guess what’s for supper tonight?!

I have been making this recipe for over 5 years now and thought I posted a review but oh well, here goes!  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!  I made it as instructed but after marinating the ribs and chicken, I thicken the sauce with a cornstarch and voila... it's now my sauce.  It's been a big hit every time.

Another winner. I made these one night and didn’t say anything about the recipe. My better-half asked what BBQ sauce I put on them and what else I did (she knows I tweak things at times). I told her it was this recipe, “Those were great!” Another winner. I have already been tweaking it. Makers Mark has replaced the rum and the amount of brown sugar has been reduced.

This is the only ribs recipe that I use. It's hands down the best if you are not a big fan of BBQ sauce like me. To spice things up a little, I season the ribs before putting them in the oven. 
I heat up the leftover sauce to serve on the side. Thanks so much for sharing!

I made these exactly as written and they were excellent. They were not exactly melt off the bone but the flavour was yummy. Maybe next time I will try boiling them rather than putting them in the oven. 
They certainly didn't need 30 mins on the grill. We cooked them until heated through and they were fine.

i cut down on the b. sugar by 1/4 cup.  i didn't have chile sauce so used a sweet chili sauce .  i also thickened the sauce with a bit of cornstarch.  i used my own dry rub on the ribs, double foil wrapped them and baked them for 1 1/2 hrs at 300.   i then drained the liquid and then brushed the ribs with the slightly thickened bbq sauce.  i covered them again and baked for 1 more hour at 285.  very tender.  will make again.

These are the best ribs I have ever made.  After 30 minutes in the oven, I reduced the heat to 225.  After another hour (90 minutes total) I added beer and sauce to the ribs, rolled them back up and roasted another hour at 170 degrees before pulling them and letting them marinade for another hour at room temperature.  They were amazing.  I will be using this recipe again.

This was my third attempt at making ribs.   My first with this recipe.   My family loved these ribs!  They were so good, the moist and tender meat fell off the bone.  I did have to adjust the recipe, I didn't have rum. I used maple syrup and a little simple syrup in place of the rum.  Next time I am going to double the recipe!!!  Delicious!!

I made it just the way it was written, except when I got home I realized all I had was Malibu coconut rum liqueur.  It still got rave reviews and was requested again.  I am making them again today, so I'm not changing what I did last time.

Excellent recipe!!! Super tender and flavorful ribs. Made a few substitutions simply because all the ingredients weren't available in the pantry. For example, in place of rum, I used shoyu, molasses and vanilla extract. To ensure the ribs were tender I doused each quarter rib cut with vinegar before enveloping in foil and baking.

Great recipe!  And so easy. We baked them with some dry rub. Took them out, covered with the sauce and let them sit in the fridge for a couple of hours. Then we baked for another 30 minutes in the foil, the last ten, we opened the foil.  These were a hit with the whole family.

I boiled the ribs.  It was great. However,  4 pounds is not enough for six people.  I would double the recipe.

Absolutely the best ribs I have eaten in a long time!  And others said the same ... I made 16 pounds of spareribs using this recipe for a 4th of July BBQ party and followed the recipe (x 4) with only the following two exceptions:
1. Used 1/8 c. soy sauce and 1/8 c. A1 sauce in place of the Worcestershire sauce
2. Used 1/4 c. Franks Red Hot sauce and 1/4 c. KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce in place of the Chile sauce
Super easy and Super good !!!

The sauce is great. Yes I would agree it's not a typical BBQ sauce type flavor, more subtle. But we loved it. I gave this 4 stars not 5 because for a fall off the bone type of experience you need to really cook these low and slow. We do not boil our ribs and on the grill or in the oven you need to cook these for hours.

Delicious! Didn't have any rum so I left it out but the ribs still turned out great! Used the marinade for some pork chops too and they turned out wonderful. Will definitely use this marinade often.

I did a little experiment with these ribs. I had a houseful of people, so I made a batch exactly as written here; and the second batch I made in the crockpot (browning in the oven first, as described in Crockpot Ribs found on this site).  I used this sauce on all the ribs. They all tasted totally awesome, thanks to this incredible sauce. They all voted the crockpot prepared ribs to be the absolute best, though. Both batches I ended up basting more sauce on the ribs and grilling in order to carmelize them. I love the ooey gooeyness of the carmelized sauce. Just want to point out, the is the BEST SAUCE ever!!!

Iv'e been making this recipe for over a decade. My son DEMANDS these for all special occasions. I season the ribs with garlic and onion powder, salt and pepper, and Beau Monde Seasoning. I bake the ribs at 320 for 2 hours. Make the sauce as the recipe directs with extra garlic and I use Dark Rum. Depending on my mood I'll use hot sauce, Liquid Smoke, mesquite seasoning, cinnamon or any thing else which catches my eye in the cupboard. I marinate over night in a tub that allows me to flip the contents upside down for full coverage. Then put the ribs on the grill on low until the marinade caramelizes on the ribs. I can't imagine boiling the ribs. My wife had a get together with appetizers only but needed a protein because of the cocktails being served. So I went to the butcher and had him cut the ribs cross ways to make the ribs more of a finger food. It worked perfectly for her needs.

HA!!  Our family has been making these for years!  We call them RUM RIBS and use Dark rum, preferably, or Amber.  Our recipe calls for Chile Sauce OR Hot Salsa, which is what I use since I seldom have Chile Sauce on hand.
Another option is to put all in a slow cooker on High for 4 hours, drain, defat the sauce, then boil it to thicken.  (Can do all this in advance, so it's all quick and easy at dinnertime).  Brush with sauce to glaze under a quick broiler or barbecue.  Delish.

I boiled the ribs and then grilled them. I didn't change any ingredients. The ribs were fantastic!!! As a fairly new cook, I was nervous to try making ribs at home. I have never cooked ribs before, and now I'm never ordering them out in a restaurant again. These ribs are tender and SO delicious! My guy is a real foodie and he went nuts over these ribs. I'm pretty sure I gained a few kitchen points with this recipe.

Never made ribs before. Easy recipe to follow and they turned out amazingly good. Everyone loved them. Definitely did not need more than 30 minutes on the grill. I had it at 350 F.  Also I marinated overnight in a ziplock bag and then removed from fridge 2 hours before grilling. So if I can do it so can anyone else.

I simmered my ribs in seasoned water (onion, lemon, salt, pepper corns and thyme) for 2 hours. I put them on the grill with no sauce until just about 15 minutes before they were ready. Then I basted each side twice when flipping. The sauce was SO good! I didn't have rum, so I subbed Apple Whisky and let me just say.....WOW! The apple went so well with the pork and I loved the kick in this recipe. I also cooked the sauce to make sure the alcohol cooked out a bit so it didn't overpower it.  Thanks for sharing!

My husband gave me the biggest compliment on these ribs. He said they were better then the ribs he gets at the local favorite rib and chicken restaurant. 
He wants me to make these  for our friends at our bar-b-que. 
Definitely making these again!

I made it exactly as written.  I baked early in the day and put in fridge with sauce over them.  It was late when we barbequed the ribs so they did marinate a while.  They were absolutely the best ribs I ever ate.  So delicious I'll dream about them until we fix them again, I'm planning a cook out with family just so I can have them again!

This is the only recipe my husband will use now. It is delicious and everyone who has the ribs, loves them. I've read some who say there's a difference between chili and chile sauce. I'm sure there is. But we use "chili" sauce and really don't care whether it is the right one or not, as the BBQ sauce is fantastic with it. Make this recipe with confidence; it's a keeper!

I don't agree with boiling the ribs, I prefer this recipe as is, boiling the meet does make it a bit more tender but in the foil pack they steam in their own juice and you have more flavor, I opt for the flavor versus the tenderness.  I have used this recipe for years and will keep it as is.

I did wrap my ribs and bake, but not at the temperatures and times in the recipes.   I also rubbed my ribs with salt, pepper, onion and garlic powders.   I also did not marinate with the sauce before finishing them off.   Instead I put some sauce in the bottom of my baking sheet, then topped the back side of the ribs with the sauce and baked at about 350 for 15 minutes, stopping every 5 minutes to reapply sauce.   Then I flipped and did the same for the top side of the ribs.   The sauce soaked in very nicely and also created a nice glaze like we all like.   The sauce itself was excellent.   It cooked out really nice and flavorful.   My only thing that gave me pause at all about this sauce is that the soy sauce gave it a bit of a teriyaki flavor, which is ok.   The recipe calls for chile sauce with an e, and some are interpreting this as chili sauce, which of course is sweet.   I instead used 1/2 sriracha sauce and 1/2 Frank's Red Hot.   I think next time I would use perhaps 2/3 sriracha and 1/3 chili sauce.   Excellent overall recipe and I will make this again.   Thank you!

Not having any rum on hand, I chose to make the sauce with whiskey instead and it turned out delicious! Care should be used when grilling, especially over real coals, as the high sugar content can add to the risk of surface burning.

I can't make this often enough! Easy instructions- just be sure to use Chile sauce (not chili). I like Herdez  Roasted Pasilla Chile.  It's NOT spicy. I let my cooked ribs sit over night in Recipes sauce before heating on grill. I reserve the excess sauce and simmer it in pan to use for dipping the ribs. Outstanding!

Modified the recipe a bit over the past few years.  I use baby back ribs instead of spare ribs.  Season the ribs with Montreal Steak Seasoning before baking and bake for 2 hours with them wrapped in tinfoil.  With the sauce I sub out the rum with apple juice.  I make these all the time and never had any leftovers.

I used this recipe as a base. As I didn't have a few of the ingredients but used this as a cooking guide. I marinated  mostly the same except I used maple syrup instead of brown sugar and ancho chile for the chile sauce. Also I used regular yellow mustard instead of dry. My roommates seem to be enjoying the smell as well as they don't know how to speak anymore.. That's  usually a good sign . Good recipe! Thanks!

I used this recipe to make ribs for the first time ever and they turned out better than I could have hoped! I did bake them the day before to cut down on prep time as I planned these for a weeknight meal. Marinated overnight and was so pleased with the results. Would recommend in a heartbeat.

I've made this many times. I don't change anything in the marinade. It's perfect!  I don't cut in serving size because it's easier to grill in larger hunks and cut in serving size afterwards.  I usually lower oven temp and cook a little longer.  This is best rib recipe ever.

Absolutely wonderful! We did the boiling trick instead of the oven, boiling the ribs for one hour. They cooked on the grill less than 30 minutes. It was tricky not to burn the ribs on the grill, so we put them to the side of the main heat and just kept adding sauce as they cooked. Delicious! I wouldn't modify a thing.

My first time to try ribs & I am so glad I used this recipe. It was amazing! I wish they were a little bit more tender, but that was the only down side. My family loved them & has decided we need to have ribs more often.

I didn't add the rum, chili sauce, dry mustard or pepper. I did add prepared mustard, Salt Lick spicy BBQ sauce and Pickapepper sauce. Also didn't have time to marinate for an hour after the oven, so they went right to the grill. Nice and crispy on the outside, and pretty tasty, basted with the extra marinade. Separated from bone fairly well.

Good recipe. Made this 2 times.  However, I used an Asian Chili Garlic Sauce which was quite hot but we didn't mind.  I'm planning to try this sauce on chicken next. Wicked

Honest to God, this is the best......BEST......rib recipe ever! I have used many Allrecipes recipes. This is absolutely the best BBQ marinade and cooking directions I have ever used. Only variation is that I did use a BBQ sauce to finish them off. Perfect flavor blend, perfectly done ribs before the marinade and correct time on the grill. I will not change this as my go to rib recipe. Very well done.

I'm rating this 4 stars based on the recipe as written, except...I didn't have any rum. Other than that, it's delicious but a bit too sweet for our taste. I also used it on chicken thighs in the crock pot then finished on the grill, and we loved it!

If I could I would give this recipe 10 stars! Hands down best rubs I've ever had- I boiled mine first for an hour instead of baking. And, used Captain Morgan spiced rum instead of plain rum.

If I could give this recipe more stars I would!! This was instantly a crowd favorite and is always requested. I like to bake the ribs in order to reduce cooking time on the grill. Also, I skipped the Worcester once and it turned out even better! This is the only rib recipe I will use. The only thing I will play around with is how to cook the ribs so that they fall off the bone everytime

Great recipe.  Great sauce.  I skipped the baking step and boiled it instead.  Then I let it marinate in a Ziploc bag, and froze it.  We brought it camping and cooked it over the campfire.  Awesome.  Some readers were confused about chili vs chile sauce.  To confirm.  Chile is a country.  Chili is a pepper used to make sauce.  The term chile sauce is nothing more than a common misspelling and refers to the exact same thing as chili sauce.  There are different kinds of chili sauce.  Some are hotter than others.  I used Sriracha because I happened to have it on hand.  Whichever one you use, it will affect the taste somewhat.

So simple.  So amazingly good!  I didn't have enough chili sauce, so I added mexican hot sauce (1/2 of the volume of chili sauce, since it's spicy) to make up for it, plus a little sugar.  Famtastic!!!!

Very tasty!  I didn't have chile sauce so I used 1/4 cup plus 2 tbs. of catsup instead.  Also, because my wife is diabetic, I substituted Splenda for the brown sugar.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  The ribs came off the grill tender, moist and absolutely delicious.  Thanks for sharing!

Made this for a dinner party of nine. Suffice it to say the ribs were a huge hit! I read the reviews & decided to boil instead of baking prior to grilling. I followed the recipe exactly except for 1 thing: instead of boiling in water, I used 2 bottles of a maple pecan porter beer. In a word, phenomenal. The maple-ey, nutty flavor works very well with the barbecue sauce. And these things were falling-off-the-bone tender. I did trim the membrane off the ribs, but didn't trim any of the fat yet they weren't chewy or gristley. Every bone picked clean - fat and all. Served with homemade coleslaw & potato salad. Pure Yumminess. I will definitely make these again.

Delicious! Melts in your mouth! Only thing I changed was to boil my ribs before following original recipe. Cooked on a low fire grill basting with sauce then baked 30 minutes in sauce before serving. Have to admit I ate one after grilling....mmmmm! Thank-you!

Made these tonight.  Only change I made was I baked them in oven because it is 0 deg outside.  They were wonderful and the family says they are the best ribs they ever had.  My husband says this sauce would be great on a meatloaf.  I used "Heinz" chili sauce.  Next time I will use authentic brand from Mexican isle.  
Thank you so much for this recipe.  I will use it for many years.  I will NEVER use a bottled bbq sauce again...YUCK!...ok, maybe on a burger. EDIT:  I'Ve always pre-boiled my ribs - three times now baking them, I will never boil again.  I believe the boiling removes too much flavor and makes them sort of rubbery.

Delicious and super tender. The only thing I changed was to halve the chili sauce because I was serving it to my kids, but I think otherwise the extra heat would be great too. Thanks for an amazing recipe!

I boiled for one hour instead of baking and substituted 1/2 cup OJ and 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar for the chile sauce on the marinade, as that is what was handy.  Fabulous!!! Thanks for sharing.

I squeezed lemon and lime on the pork ribs, added a good guzzle of rum, covered in fresh chopped garlic and ginger, and rubbed with a mixture of cinnamon, chili powder, fresh ground cumin, smokey paprika, salt, pepper, and a few red chili peppers. I wrapped the ribs in foil, let them marinate for a few hours and then baked for about 45 minutes at 375. Then I baked for an additional ten minutes at 475. I removed the foil, cut the long rib sections into sets of around four ribs, and spread on the BBQ sauce mixture as described in the recipe. I then put on a well heated grill for around nine minutes meat side down, turned over and did for another six minutes after sprinkling on more sauce. Careful the fire doesn't blacken them too much. Delicious and tender with really nice undertones. Only thing I would do differently is marinate overnight to get even more depth of flavour. But they were pretty darn tasty...My wife said the best she'd ever had but, you know, she might be biased...!

What a fantastic recipe! I live in Australia and smokers aren't common so I was searching for a recipe that I could do in the oven then finish off on the BBQ to get that beautiful smokey flavour. The only thing I did different was to use half the marinade to marinade the ribs before cooking them, I felt that it would infuse the ribs with more flavour while slow cooking them. Then I used the remaining half when I was grilling them.

Great, easy ribs!  I didn't have the chile sauce so I used 1 tsp. chipotle powder spice for the heat.  Used dark rum.  Making them again today, they are SO GOOD.

Instead of a 350 oven for 1 1/2 hours, try 225 for 4 hours. It's makes the most tender ribs ever and your sauce will not leak out of the seams of the foil. After the 4 hours lets the ribs rest in the foil for 1/2 hour. Then do as the recipe calls for.

Holy yum! I had a really hard time figuring out what to use in regards to chile /chili sauce... The only chile with an "e" sauce I could find was the Thai chile...so that is what i used. not sure if the ribs were supposed to be as spicy as they were... But they were delish! A definite keeper! With the Thai chile sauce, they definitely had a kick!

I must say that this recipe is absolutely divine. I do not own a grill so I prepared these in the oven. I normally boil my ribs before baking them but wanted to try the oven method as an alternative. I precooked the ribs in double foil at 350 degrees for an hour and a half. I marinated the cooked ribs overnight in the sauce. I stayed true to the recipe for the sauce except I cut the brown sugar by half. I also generously added red pepper flakes because we like things seriously spicy in our house. I baked the marinated ribs at 350 degrees covered for 15 minutes..uncover..baste..15 minutes..turn..baste..15 minutes..done. My extremely picky teenage daughter said they were the the best ribs that she has ever had. What a refreshing change from ribs with nothing more than barbecue sauce dumped on them. I dont think that I will ever cook ribs that way again. I would suggest that if you have some healthy appetites in your house..double this recipe for sure. You can serve this with good old fashioned barbecue or picnic type sides. You can do a southern themed dinner with some sort of cornbread on the side. Oh heck..you could do an elegant upscale dinner with grilled asparagus and other fancy stuff. Enjoy....

Omg! This recipe is awesome! I had to make some substitutions using what I had on hand. Bourbon instead of rum, bbq sauce instead of ketchup and chili sauce instead of chile sauce (purchased in error). I baked as directed (I would never boil ribs) and marinated overnight. Planned to grill them but it rained so brought them to room temperature for an hour and baked them for 30 minutes and they were great! Falling off the bone tender and needed nothing else! Everyone loved them and they are now my go to rib recipe. Can't wait to make them again!

OH MY LORD these are the best ribs EVER! I only had sweet chili sauce so I used that along with half more of regular bbq sauce.
We were not rib fans.....but we sure are now! I made these twice now and double the second batch of sauce and froze it for next time. I used to boil my ribs too.....but after seeing and tasting them this time...I'm a baker now!
My son is not a huge fan of my cooking but he had his share and more!

I tried this for the first time about 6 weeks ago.  I am making it again today for the fourth time!  We love it.  I use Heinz Chili Sauce and add about 1/2 tsp. of Cayenne pepper to spice it up a little more.  This is extremely easy and tastes fantastic!

Excellent! My mother in law said it was the best ribs she had ever had.   I realized when doing this review that I had forgotten the Worcestershire sauce in my haste of making the marinade and they were still excellent.  I only baked the ribs and they were tender and juicy.  I used Heinz Chili sauce.  I looked up and down the Mexican aisle and sauce aisle at the store and there are no sauces called chile sauce just pepper sauces.  I also decided that 1/2 cup of any pepper sauce was probably going to be a lot more "heat" than my family would have liked.  I think we'll like it with the Worcestershire sauce too so we'll be sure to add that next time.

I absolutely love this recipe. We recently moved to the outback after living in the city and were mourning the loss of our rib joint. The mourning is officially over as this recipe is better than any ribs I've ever had. Tried it a few times now and last time we were out of rum and replaced it with brandy. Much better!

These ribs are nice, I baked them and they worked out fine. Next time I make it I will use less sugar though, because they are very sweet. And I used Malibu rum which I wouldn't recommend, it's fine but does leave a slight coconuty flavour.

These were so easy to make and so tasty. I used one rack of baby back ribs (2 lbs) and cut the marinade in half.  I marinated them for about 2 hours before finishing on the grill. Only substitution was some regular yellow mustard for the dry. This is my favorite new rib recipe.

this is a great recipe! I have used this recipe for thanksgiving potluck party and other gatherings! Everyone loved it. My boyfriend especially! I have boiled the ribs in water for about 15 to 20 minutes (i put it to med to low heat just don't want the texture to become too rough). I have also tried the method of not boiling the ribs before seasoning. (I think it is more tender but less juicy). Next, then I followed the ingredients in the recipe to seasoned it for over night. I personally think it just taste better the long you marinate. Baked in preheated oven at 350F for 1 hr and 45 minutes. At the last 15 minutes, I took the ribs out and add a generous layer of honey on top and put it back in the oven to allow the honey to caramelize! Vola! don't forget to eat it with your fingers! makes it taste extra tasty!

Yummy! This was fantastic. I was baking it at the same time as a cheesecake so I baked it at 325 for 1:30 and then rested it and cooked it. I also re-heated the sauce (after boiling) with the meat. It's fantastic to dip the ribs in! AMAZING recipe!

This sauce was amazing!!  I made spare ribs and baked them for 1 hour.  Next time I will only bake for 45 min. as they were a little overdone.  I will use this sauce for chicken, pork loin, and many other things in the future.  The BEST barbecue sauce I've had!

I doubled everything except the sugar. Might cut it to 3/4 cups next time. I did use 1 1/2 Tbs minced garlic.  I couldn't find chile sauce and didn't want to make the mistake that others made and use chili sauce.  I searched everywhere.  When I couldn't find it, I bought a can of diced tomatoes with chiles.  I used the whole can.  I used my Braun hand mixer to puree the sauce, since it had pieces of tomatoes.  Next time I might cut out the ketchup, since I used extra tomoatoes.  It smelled very sweet when cooking, but wasn't sweet at all.  I cooked it for 8 hours on low in the crockpot.  The meat was falling off the bone.  The only problem (at no fault of the recipe) was the sauce was very fatty at the end.  We used a jar of Sticky Finger bbq sauce heated to dip the rib meat in.  I don't think I will use spare ribs next time.  I might try a different cut of meat.  Overall an excellent recipe!

this was pretty good. My husband and i loved the sauce. it reminded us of the Jack Danials sauce you get at TGIFriday's. However, the ribs were tough i thought. i may make them again but this time in the slow cooker. it's the only way i've found to make truely tender ribs that fall off the bone.

I did not care for this recipe.  I am concerned my dislike had something to do with my choice of ribs.  I tried the same type ribs on another recipe and they were much better.  So that being said, these were tough and the rum flavor was not good.  It was a ton of work for what I got in the end.  I will not be making these again.

This was super good. While the sauce was sweet, it was very tasty! I added some pepper flakes, just to give it some heat. I took the tip to boil the ribs for an hour, then bake for an hour. Very tender!

I loved the taste of these ribs!  I baked them this time, but I might try boiling them next time.  I was out of rum so I made it anyhow, still good.  I will make sure to get more rum and try these again!

The sauce in this recipe is awesome!  I don't like cooking with alcohol, so I substituted pineapple juice for the rum, and it was great!  I took the advice of several reviewers and boiled the ribs first, but I was a little disappointed, as they weren't as tender as I thought they would be.  I'll try the oven method next time.  But my family and I looooved the sauce!  This recipe is a keeper!

Everyone loved this.  Seasoned ribs with a rub before baking and did not finish off on the grill because it was unavailable, but they were tender and great anyway.  Several people mentioned they loved the sauce, and I will be using the sauce on chicken as well. Thanks for sharing!

I boil the ribs first then marinate overnight. My hubby gives them a quick grill on the BBQ and they are great!! I had 40 people over for a BBQ recently and am still getting asked for the recipe. BIG HIT!!

This was so easy to make! I did boil them for an hour as other reviewers suggested. My 11 year old (picky) daughter had never eaten ribs before (I don't eat red meat.) I asked her "just try them". She took one bite and said "These are so good!!" She has already asked me to make them again. I was extremely impressed! Thank you for a great recipe!

Read some of the other reviews about boiling the ribs instead of roasting them in the oven, but decided to stick with the recipe just to be able to compare. Will definitely boil next time. Sauce was amazing! Substituted Whiskey for the run (didn't have any in the house) and it still tasted great!

I was skeptical of using spare ribs...am used to baby back, but the price difference is so great that I decided to give it a try.  Wow, this recipe was great.   Cooked them at 325 degrees for  2 hours, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

Great.  Best to steam the ribs.  Use a large roasting pan and a few disposable pie tins in the bottom with about a inch of water.  Place the ribs on the pie tins and the fat will just steam off and the ribs will be so tender.

I was great.  I bake my ribs at 250 degrees for a couple of hours then grill.  I find boiling them makes them chewy.

These ribs were incredible!!! I baked my ribs in foil at 325 for 2 hours and then let them sit in the sauce at room temperature for an hour. Then I put them on a broiler pan and baked them in the oven for about 30 minutes. I will definately make these again. Thanks for the awesome recipe!!!!

We had this for the first time the other night, VERY GOOD!! Not a single rib left and we had 9lbs on the grill.  Trying it again tonight, we are going to boil the ribs for 1 hour 10 minutes and marinate overnight.  Definately a keeper.

My "hubbie" absolutely loves Barbecue Ribs and this was the very best recipe I've tried. He says they are better than any he's had at a restaurant, and he's had a lot of them. I have yet to try them grilled but baked in the oven and basted while baking was just awesome. I also boiled them in a pot of water until tender. We won't need to go out to eat ribs anymore!

Loved it! The sauce was fabulous. I did boil them for one hour rather than bake. I will make these again and again!!

I sort of followed this recipe.  I boiled the ribs before adding the sauce.  Then left them overnight to marinate.  I baked them the next day (300 for 2 hours, I was making 8 pounds of ribs) and they were fabulous.  My kids thought they were too spicy, so next time I plan to thin out a bbq sauce they like with water, and use that to marinate instead.

Excellent.  Easily the best ribs I've ever had.  I boiled them, definitely got rid of LOTS of the fat.  Used whiskey instead of rum...adds a great flavor!

Wow!  If I could rate this more stars I would!  These are the BEST ribs I have had in my life!  I didn't have any dry mustard so I added regular mustard.  Also, the ribs came out super tender by baking them.  Great recipe!

Wonderful!  I haven't tried boiling ribs in the past, but this was quicker, yet delicious!  I didn't have the rum, but it was still very good.  I will definitely use again. I used chili powder, along with just a little cayenne to give it some zip.  I also used anothers suggestion to throw in some garlic while boiling the ribs.  Thanks!

I've been making these ribs for 5 years now (just getting around to the review :)  Everytime I make these ribs, they disappear faster than I don't know what.  I get so many compliments on these ribs; they are absolutely GREAT.  I use baby back ribs and they just fall off the bone.  Great recipe for many more years to come.

M'mm...I took the advice of others and boiled my ribs, marinated & baked them. I would definitely marinate overnight next time. I wished that the BBQ sauce was finger licking messy. :o)

A great rib recipe with no modifications.  Even my son who normally hates ribs rated this as a 4/5 which I thought was quite a feat.  Great blend of sweet and spicy.  Keep napkins on hand with lemon water finger bowls -- this is very sticky.  I will definitely be making this again.

Okay, I cooked these ribs yesterday and they were good, but they seemed to be missing something. I used chili sauce (the type usually sold right next to cocktail sauce in the store) since I could not find what looked like the correct chile sauce. I wasn't brave enough to use that much hot sauce, but maybe I was wrong.

Oh my goodness, these ribs were AWESOME!!!  I followed the recipe exactly, marinating only for 1 hr at room temp.  Probably would have been even better had I had the forethought to marinate overnight.  My husband keeps raving how awesome these were...and so easy!  We'll be making this for friends often.

OH MY GOODNESS!  hands down, the BEST ribs I've ever had.  I, like many, just boiled the ribs for an hour.  After I marinated them and broiled after, basting 3 times during broiling.  I had no chile sauce, so I just added ketchup, vinegar, crushed cloves and cinnamon as a substitute.  I will make this 100 times over!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I couldn't fit all the ribs in the oven (I think I did the recipe times 5, seriously), so I ended up bioling the rest.  Not sure which ones were boiled or which ones were baked, but they all pretty much had the same chewy texture.  I think next time I will bake them at a lower temp. for a longer time (like all other recipes call for) to see if I get a more tender result.  Other than that, the SAUCE WAS AMAZING!

AWESOME!!  My grill was not working, so I finished them under the broiler (turned every few minutes and put more sauce on). This sauce is equally as good on salmon.

This was one of the best tasting ribs we've eaten in a long time! The sauce was the best! I made it exactly like the recipe stated, baked in the oven because it was the easiest way to cook with less clean up. Other than the cooking and marinating time involved this is a very easy recipe to  make. My family loved it, especially my picky teenage son. I will definitely  make again!

They were okay a little to different for my taste buds. Edible but won't try again.

Unbelievably good.  Didn't have chili sauce so substituted Asian Black Bean Chili Paste (they were painfully spicy but we loved it).  The only thing I would do differently is use a little less rum because I did feel like I could taste it although my husband did not.  I continuously brushed the ribs before and during baking and think that was critical for the delicous coating.  Can't wait to try and grill it.  Thanks for the recipe!

Sauce and ribs were ok. If I were to make this again, I would add more brown sugar to the recipe so that it has a better balance of the sweet and the spicy. I would also boil the ribs so that they are more tender, not bake them for the 1.5 hours.

I am a vegetarian but I made this for my family's Easter and they loved it! Even my Dad who is a picker eater loved it and wanted my Mom to make it for him a few weeks later. Make twice the amount of sauce and enjoy!

Excellent sauce!  I think it is the rum.  Next time, I would cook the ribs in the slow cooker.
Great recipe, I'm keeping it!

They were good.  I baked them, marinated them, and then baked again as I was out of charcoal.  Fall apart tender with a nice flavor.  I will put this on my list of sauces to use.

Awesome. This was the first time I did ribs on the barbeque and am addicted. I followed the advice of others and preboiled the ribs for about 45 minutes before marinating overnight. Be carefule to watch the ribs on the barbecue though as they will burn fast.

Great recipe ;)  I took the advice of a few others and I boiled mine. I boiled mine in apple juice and I also used the dry rub from Denise.  These turned out really tasty.. Will make again..

The taste of these were good, but they were tough. I think next time I will skip the oven, marinate, and just throw them on the grill.

I made this for July 4th exactly per the recipe.  The flavor was great but the meat could have baked a bit longer. Next time I'll increase baking time and let it marinade overnight. I was able to let it marinade only 6 hrs.  That may have made a difference. Thanks.

FANTASTIC! I didn't have any rum, so I used rum flavoring and a little beer. Perfect. Also, the recipe doesn't mention this, but I rubbed with a spice rub and put them in the fridge for a couple of hours before putting them in the oven. If you like HEAT, use the Asian "rooster" chili sauce. You know the one I mean...

This is a great sauce!  I used boneless ribs and they came out a tad on the dry side, but I will adjust my cooking method next time and use the same recipe.  The preparation is quick enough that you'll never want to use a bottled sauce again!

There were alot of rib recipes to choose from. I chose this because it seemed easy....and it was!
The whole family loved them! The kids asked for seconds, even my 2 year old!
Lots of flavor! This is a keeper!

Delicious ribs! I did the marinating step overnight in the fridge, and used Frank's RedHot Xtra Hot cayenne pepper sauce because I didn't have chile sauce. I grilled the ribs on my indoor/outdoor George Foreman Grill, and they were great! I loved the spiciness in the sauce. Next time I'll try using my new charcoal grill.

Excellent ribs!  I started with boneless pork ribs and added 1/4 cup lime juice (did not have lemon) and 3/4 cup water to the ribs, sealed in foil and baked for an hour and a half as recommended.  For the marinade, I did not have chile sauce so I used a sweet onion dipping sauce, since I had it on hand, along with Capt Morgan's spiced rum and the remaining ingredients as listed.  I doubled the sauce and let the ribs marinate for about 6 hours, then we finished them off on the bar-b-que grill.  Wonderful flavor and super moist and tender.  This is our rib recipe from now on!

I tried this recipe and followed the directions with just a bit less brown sugar.  They were an absolute hit especially among the kids!  I am going to try them on country ribs next!  Thanks for the recipe!

Made these several times....as per the recipe and they come out fantastic everytime. I used Pork Center cut Ribs and have marinated anywhere from one hour to 48hrs (in fridge and flip every 8 hrs or so), the longer they marinate the better they taste. When you BBQ them for the half hour, keep an eye on it and keep basting.

I was not pleased with results of the ribs or the taste.  They did not meet up to want I was expecting. Sorry, but not a keeper for me.

The flavor of these ribs was great.  However, I followed the recipe exactly and even marinated the ribs for about 36 hours.  When I took them off the grill after about 20 minutes, they were tough.  I was expecting "fall-off the bone tenderness" after all the time and effort.  I don't know if I did something wrong or was expecting too much...Maybe I'll try again with some tweeking...

Everyone said these were the best and everyone wanted the recipe!  I was so nervouse because i had never had the nerve to try and grill ribs but these were a mega hit! thanks so much!

Perfect recipe! It's not just the marinade (which is superb, even though I didn't think it smelled that great when the ribs were marinating), but I think the meat is so tender because of the pre-baking in foil. Never making any other ribs again!

Our new family favorite rib recipe.  I sometimes am pressed for time and just marinate the uncooked ribs in the sauce for a couple hours before bbqing.  They're awesome.

Our NFL Tailgaters decided to have a rib cook-off.  Given my competative nature, my husband frowned on the idea since, while and experienced cook, I have never tried making ribs.  I scowered the internet and decided to give this one a try.  I definitely held my own.  Recipe had a unique flavor and everyone enjoyed them.  Easy to make and tote along.

This recipe was very, very good. I made the sauce exactly the way stated using my favorite brand of spiced rum (silver edition) and also added a generous dollop of orange marmalade. I thought the sauce was also excellent for dipping although it could have been a tad bit thicker. Maybe next time I will try it with baby back ribs as the spare ribs were kind of fatty. My 15 yr old daughter also loved the sauce. This recipe is delicious!!!!

This was excellent. I baked it in the oven since I don't have a grill and they still turned out delicious. Just make sure you like the rum you choose to use since it is a big part of the taste of the ribs.

I tried this recipe yesterday for 4th of July.  I've been looking for a great tasting rib recipe where the meat would just fall off the bone.  This is it!!!  I reduced the brown sugar by half as some of the reviews suggested.  For one slab of ribs I added "dry rub for ribs" by Denise as recommended also by some reviewers.  For the second slab, I didn't add the dry rub prior to placing it in the oven.  Both slabs turned out great.  We didn't think the dry rub was necessary.  I also made dipping sauce from "barbecued ribs" by Gail, again recommended by some reviewers.  We didn't even need to use the dipping sauce.  The ribs were already so tasty without it.  I would make this again just like what the recipe calls for, except cut the sugar by half.  This is definitely a must try!

Kristy -- Thanks for sharing this recipes.  Growing up as a Yankee I was quite familar with beef ribs, not pork.  After being in the south for a while, pork seems to prevail, however the "mustard based" sauce is not to my liking.

The ketchup-based sauce and the cooking method you shared resulted in the best ribs I have ever had.  I made it for a 4th of July gathering and my Southern friends and my transplanted family all raved about them. (I finished cooking the ribs in the oven)

If you prefer a mustard or vinager-based sauce use this cooking method and you cannot go wrong.

These ribs were awesome!  I just made them today for company and everyone raved.  This will be my rib recipe from now on.  I used 1/2 the sugar as others have suggested and I marinated them overnight. So simple and extremely yummy. Great for parties.

This is the best marinade!! I cut my pork back ribs into 4-5 rib slabs and stand them in my crock pot. When they are fork tender, I arrange them in a dish and pore Kristy's marinade over them and refridgerate them overnight. I then grill them on the grill, basting them with the marinade until they are grilled and ready to devour. My husband becomes greedy with these and hides any left-overs for himself. Serve them with the barbeque sauce recipe under 'Barbequed Ribs' by Gail and you will have your man in the palm of your hand. Thank you!! Thank you!!

These were very good! I've made them a couple of times, and altered the recipe a little each time. I cut down on both the chili sauce and the brown sugar. We also used the rub that another reviewer mentioned.

Mmmmmm Mmmmmmmm good!! I made these ribs for Memorial Day and what a hit. This is the only way i will ever make ribs again. I made a couple substitutions due to the fact i did not have brown sugar or chili sauce on hand, so i used a 1/2 cup strawberry preserves lightly warmed in micro.(any preserve will do) and added a teaspoon of chili powder to 1/2 cup of ketchup. Turned out wonderful!

Tremendous recipe! Served with two different kinds of grilled corn (see other reviews by me) and a great broccoli tortellini salad (also from Allrecipes). Husband loved the combination of flavors. We loved the flavor of this sauce. These were just great tasting ribs and we will be making a lot more of them.

SOOOOO GOOOOOD, and so easy to make.  Yes, it is time consuming...but it you have the time, it's well worth it.  Cooking the ribs the night before is a good idea.  I did it all on the same day, and they were delish.  I bet they'd be even better if they marinated overnight.  I baked the ribs to cook them, then baked them with the sauce. Boiling the ribs might work well too, and maybe tender up the meat a little.  My boyfriend and I both loved them though.  Can't wait to make them again.

This is my second time using this recipe and it is awesome!!  My husband loves it and says it is so tender, I live in the city with no where to bbq, but the oven is just as good.  This is a simple yet great recipe that I passed it on to my sister whose husband loves to barbecue.

YUMMY! These ribs were super! We followed the recipe and grilled for a few minutes at the end of the cooking time. They couldn't have been any better! :o)

These are fabulous. After the pre-baking, I marinated for 2 days,(to suit my schedule), and reheated for over an hour at 225F in a pan covered tightly with foil when guests were late. I took off foil for another 25 minutes and everyone agreed they were the best ribs they ever had - moist and falling off the bone tender. I used baby back ribs and left them in chunks of 4 to 5 ribs. Awesome!

This recipe was absolutely fantastic. I was a bit skeptic since I don't own a grill, so after the marinade I just baked them in the oven for about 20 minutes. They came out fantastic, the only thing I'd do differently next time around is cutting on the amount of sugar which was a bit too much for me.

These were amazing!  I thought that the rum would be strong but it wasn't at all.  I substituted bbq sauce for the chili sauce and it tasted great.  I was very surprised at how tender these were for only marinating 1 hour.  I can't wait to see how tender they are after soaking over night! Thanks Kristy.

The sauce was sweet, not spicy at all.  Good, but I'm looking for a ribs that are a little more tender.

This is an awesome recipe. One thing for sure is I will never parboil ribs again. They were soooo tender. The sauce is fantastic. My sister in law, Bettyann loved them too. I just sent her the recipe.

Great way to precook the ribs.  Use the 'Best BBQ Rub in Texas' before wrapping the ribs.  Ribs come out tender and juicy.

Fantastic sauce! My teenagers finished the ribs while I was marinating them. I never got to the grilling part.

These were very yummy!  Next time though I might try boiling them instead of baking them to see if they come out more moist.

This was great!  I forgot to marinate ribs in sauce but it was still very good!  We did all the cooking on the gas grill!  Took less time. Thanks!
