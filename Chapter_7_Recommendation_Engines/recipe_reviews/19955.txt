I tired this and evryone like dit.  A bit on the "zingy" side.  I would suggest adding a lot more coconut milk to make it milder.  Also, try making cranberry juice ice cubes to go along with it.

A very good idea for parties and get togethers where alcohol isn't desired.  In fact, this negates the need for alcohol at all.  Very nice.

Very tangy and interesting drink for the non-alcoholic party set. Would be interested to try it with alcohol. I found it to be very refreshing, although I couldn't drink much more than a single glass.

I would actually use slightly less grapefruit concentrate if I made it again because it was a bit acidic and harsh to taste.

I should have known better with grapefruit juice in the recipe, but I just couldn't get over the sharp taste and smell of this drink... I had hoped for something kids and adults could enjoy on New Year's Eve without alcohol... this wasn't it.

This was good after I doubled the coconut milk.  While I really liked the  fact that this punch is not sickeningly sweet, the grapefruit juice concentrate was a little overpowering.  I will be making it again with a little less grapefruit concentrate, more cranberry concentrate, and more coconut milk.

I really liked this mix, but I also really like grapefruit juice. My husband thinks this is a tad tart for him. I used ruby red grapefruit juice and a whole can of coconut milk. I also mixed this with raspberry flavored sparkling water for a yummy punch.

Instead of water, I used carbonated water. I also made 'frozen' style drinks using the mix of concentrates and coconut as the mixer, adding ice and carbonated water to the blender. It is very good!!

Had a family member that doesn't like grapefruit juice so I substituted it with orange juice and it was still delicious. This is such a great recipe because it is so good made as is but can be played with and adjusted so many ways to people's tastes. A great staple recipe to have saved.
