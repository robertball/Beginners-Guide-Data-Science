Excellent....and sooo refreshing. Unsure if carbonated water is the same as club soda, but its what I had available. Yummy, just the right proportions of cream to OJ and vanilla! Thanks Sara.

I have tried almost all of the "orange & cream" drinks and this one just was not very good.  I used pierrer for the carbonated water and I just did not like the taste of it.  The recipe was to large to fit in my blender and for the fat content the taste just was not worth it.  I will definatley stick to the oj and milk recipes.

Instead of heavy cream, I used an equal amount of fat free evaporated milk. I didn't use the ice--it really wasn't necessary. This was AWESOME. It reminded me of a drink that you'd get at a soda fountain. One of the best "creamsicle" drinks we've ever had.

Excellent taste and texture, but WAY too much for the regular household blender.  Had to pour some into glasses even before adding the carbonated water, and still spilled all over.

If you like an orange /vanilla frozen drink thats not tart just add 1/4 c (for serving of 4) to this to sweeten it up.  However its excellent just as is !

This drink had an overpowering taste that was just too much for my taste buds. It was very tangy.  I think next time just using orange juice in place of the concentrate would be better.

Far too much volume for my standard blender! Went to the tippy top without the ice cubes.
