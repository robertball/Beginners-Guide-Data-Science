This is incredibly yummy on a chilly day.  There is no need to wilt the spinach separately.  The soup is hot enough to just put the spinach right in.  It will wilt on its own.  This was fantastic.  The feta and spinach make this soup.

This was really great! I used 2 cans of navy beans instead of dried, and put everything in the slow cooker for 12 hours. The flavour is wonderful; quite a change from chicken or beef. This recipe is a keeper.

This would get 6 stars if there was such a catagory. Short on time, I used 2 cans of Great Northern beans, and 1 3/4c crushed tomatoes. Also, placed the baby spinach in the bottom of the soup bowl, topped with hot soup Which wilted the spinach and added the feta on top. Can't get better than this. Thank you Hardt!!

Absolutely fabulous...I used diced lamb chops in place of the ground lamb, and cooked until extremely tender. Fresh thyme was a huge plus...I also used fresh goat's milk feta cheese which added an amazing tangy flavor. Update 06/23/07: After 3 years, my husband and I count down the days until cold weather to make this soup.  It is always great the first day, but gets better and better every time you re-heat it.  The most important of aspect(s) of this recipe? Always use fresh garlic, herbs, and fresh spinach.  You will not be disappointed.  I always make a special trip to the 'natural' food store for the goats milk feta cheese also...pure heaven.

Great base recipe, very flexible. Used a few substitutions --canned cannelini beans and a can of diced tomatoes. Also used kale instead of spinach. Browned the lamb, drained the fat and threw everything in the crockpot on high for 3 hours. Topped with goat cheese which melted into the soup completely and gave the broth a tanginess and creaminess that was awesome.

Loved this! We did it with a few minor changes: 1) used leftover roasted leg of lamb (convenient!) and 2) without the tomatoes, since my husband can't have them, but just added more chicken broth. It was delicious! Staying on the regular winter menu.

5 stars with goat cheese used instead of feta without the cheese it would be only 2 0r 3 stars. I also cooked overnight in a slow cooker and after sorting and rising dried beans added them straight to sc w/o soaking 10 hours of slow cooking was enough.
 i also used tomato puree and all fresh herbs in their respective equivalents.i added spinach straight to the soup and its hot enough to wilt and simpler too. goat cheese adds an extra dimension and complements the lamb flavor exceedingly well and adds a tangy-ness.

I found this soup really lacking in flavor.  I used lean ground lamb.  Maybe it needed the fat inorder for it to have flavor.

I'm not keen on beans in soup so I subbed hominy for the beans and left out the feta on top. SO GOOD. This is such a colorful, delicious soup that is just amazing and so easy to put together. I've made this several times, and it always goes fast around my house.

This was so good!  The only bad thing about it was I didn't have enough leftovers to last all week.  Next time I will make a double batch.  I left the feta out of my husband's bowl since he is a feta hater.  I thought the feta tasted great in the soup.

I loved this soup.  I had leftover lamb from a leg of lamb roast.  I made stock from the bone and used 4 cups lamb broth, 2 cups chicken broth and added my leftover cooked lamb the last 10 min just to warm it up.  I agree that the fresh spinich and feta make the soup something special.

Fantastic soup - perfect for a fall dinner (or lunch) with a glass of red wine and some crusty warm bread and butter.  The feta cheese really makes this stand out and pairs so well with the lamb, if you don't like feta you could use a good parm, but I really recommend a good creamy feta.  I added some white pepper, but otherwise excellent as is!

Excellent recipe, my husband loved this and he doesn't even like lamb. I suggest ommiting salt because it is salty enough on its own. I definately will make again.

This soup was remarkably delicious. So flavorful! I did double the celery, carrots and onions, as I like chunkier soups.  Also, I used lamb shoulders instead of ground lamb and the meat turned out wonderfully tender.

My DH and I loved this soup.  Not my 10 yr old, but he's picky. I browned the lamb, drained and removed, added a chopped onion & carrots.  Then added garlic and spices. (used celery seed/no celery on hand). Instead of tomatoes, I used a small can of V-8 juice; 3 cans of chicken broth. Also cheated and used a can of small white beans instead of soaking dry ones.  Added frozen spinach leaves, put feta in the bottom of the bowl, and enjoyed!!!

This was really good. I used left over roast leg of lamb (cubed) and kale instead of spinach (as spinach gets slimy when cooked and kale holds up well). It was very good, very easy and very economical. And it's an esay way to get some veggies in. Perfect for Fall.

Love this soup -- both hearty and delicious!  The only thing I changed is that I used a couple of cans of great northern beans rather than going through the trouble of using dried beans.  Oh -- I also used 2 lbs of lamb but that's not necessary.

We didn't care for this.  I cooked it in the crockpot, and it smelled fantastic.  We had some really good quality feta, but it seemed like there was something "missing", in spite of the fact there were tons of ingredients.  I won't be making this again.

We really quite enjoyed this soup. We just seasoned it at the table, rather than in the pot.

We definitely should have used more lamb. We bought a 1-pound package, but did not scale the rest of the recipe. We also used maybe twice as much parsley just to use what we bought.

The smell coming from the kitchen as this simmers is worth making it (assuming you like lamb). This will get repeat business in our kitchen this winter!

This is a fragrant, delicious treat. The chopping is the most time-consuming part. We did the prep last night while cooking dinner, then let it simmer while we watched tv, then put containers in the fridge overnight. It reheats very nicely and makes for a spectacular lunch that made the rest of my office jealous! I did not use the feta and spinach garnish, but a toasted slice of a dark wheat bread went very nicely with the flavors in the soup.

So good and easy too!  I don't have patience for beans so I just skipped the overnight soaking and bought the canned variety.  I washed them thoroughly and tossed them in the pot after the tomatoes.  Also I'm not too well-versed on beans so I had no idea what white Northern beans were so I just used white kidney beans.  I don't really think the type of bean makes a difference because the soup was delicious anyways.  Great recipe, goes well with a hunk of bread!

Good combination of ingredients & very easy to make.  I added half a can of beer just to give the chicken broth additional flavor.  Turned out great!  And very filling - unlike most soups.  Excellent for a cold winter day!

WOW!  The flavors in this are fantastic together ... the house smelled wonderful while it was cooking.  Like another reviewer mentioned, it tastes even better after it's been reheated ... wilting the spinach in the bottom of the bowl with the hot soup was a great suggestion ... I ended up using sun dried tomato feta because that's all I had on hand ... This soup is amazing and will be made over and over again ...

I used Unrefined Coconut Oil because I ran out of Extra Virgin Olive Oil.    I used a little bit of crumbled goat cheese on top because I'm not a fan of Feta.  Organic White Cannellini Beans and leftover Black-Eyed Peas were thrown in as well because I was trying to clean out the pantry!  This soup was so good, even though it's 96 degrees down South at the moment . . .  this will taste extra yummy at the first cold snap in about three months.  Thank you for sharing the recipe, Hardt.

I made this soup according to recipe, except that I used canned white beans, and I drained the meat after browning to elimate most of the grease. Also, I used a combination of beef broth & vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. And I too just added the spinach directly to the soup.  It was great! We buy a butchered lamb every year and are always looking for tasty ground lamb recipes. This one definitely fit the bill and I will make it again!

I made this six times now.  Wonderful lamb recipe that I tweek a little every time. I do like the version where I add chopped white potatoes and also a little semi sweet white wine. I usually double the quantity and add a little ground beef to cut the wild flavor of the lamb a bit.  Everyone seems to always want more.  A great option to vegitible beef soup. Give it a try.

This recipe works great in a slow cooker too! My variations: diced leg of lamb, a block frozen chopped spinach, and skipped the cheese (personal preference). I saute the ingredients before putting them in the crock, and use the 8 hour low cook. The spinach gets added 20 minutes before serving. Others, who can put cheese in their soup, enjoy it. The leftovers taste amazing the next day.

Like others, I adjusted the ingredients for time and taste--it was still delicious! I used 1 lb ground lamb, cumin instead of parsley (for a deeper flavor), a can of stewed tomatoes (couldn't find plum), and one can of black-eyed peas. I like it more as a stew so I only used 2 cups of broth and only simmered for 30 minutes b/c the beans were already cooked. . It was great with crusty bread. Thanks!

Great recipe. I followed the recommendations and used goat feta cheese and fresh herbs, going heavy on all seasonings. I also browned the lamb first and drained the excess fat.  This is going to become a standard recipe in my house.

Outstanding soup!  I made it using 2 cans of white beans. I didn't have a can of tomatoes, so I just used 3 fresh roma tomatoes.  Cooked it all up for about 2 hours. 
I used fresh thyme and fresh goat cheese feta.  I added about 1/2 of a lemon's juice to this recipe.  It really seemed to give it a nice balance.  I also had some leftover baby zucchini that I threw in about 15 minutes before serving.  Didn't pre-wilt the spinach.  Amazing.  Will definitely make this again.

I doubled the recipe, added a qt. of crushed tomatoes instead of chopped tomatoes, added some extra beans, & used goat cheese instead of feta cheese. It was so satisfyingly good! The whole family asked for seconds :-)

Really good soup. I used cubed lamb instead of ground. I also added chopped kale, chopped broccoli leaves and cubed daikan radish. You can shorten the recipe by not soaking the beans overnight - just boil them. I also made the soup in a pressure cooker (

This worked fine for us. We had leftover leg of lamb, so I cut up the meat and threw in the bone, letting it simmer for a couple hours, covered. We also used kale instead of spinach and parmesan instead of feta just because that was what we had. A pickled veg, like lemon, was nice on top.

Tis soup was outstanding!  The only thing I changed was instead of ground lamb, I roasted a small leg of lam in garlic powder and ground pepper and chopped it up for the soup.  Was incredibly good soup!

This is one of the first recipes that I tried from Allrecipes.  I've been making this in my slow cooker for years.  It's a friends and family favorite.  I use canned great northern beans, cubed lamb shoulder, and I add raw baby spinach to the bowl before serving.  My dad and boyfriend asked me to double the meat and bean content next time.  I will report back with those results.
