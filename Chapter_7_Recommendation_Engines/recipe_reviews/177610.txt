Great! My family loved it & was very easy. For my family's taste, I left out the cranberries & the rasins. Was still very good. Warms up very well, for the left overs

I wanted to have it for Christmas morning but it was a disaster.  I followed the recipe exactly as it is written.  I baked it for 45 minutes and it was very mushy inside.  I baked for an additional 30 minutes and it was still mushy.  I turned on the convection for another 30 minutes and it was still mushy.  I think if you use 2 cups of milk instead of 3 cups of milk it will cook in the middle.  I was disappointed because I think this recipe has potential - if you cut down on the milk

I made this for our Bowling League potluck and it came out beautifully. It was so easy to make - I made it the night before and then set it out early the next morning to cool off before baking. I used raisons since I didn't have any cranberrys.  The dish is not too sweet so adding the maple syrup makes it perfect.  The left overs were great the next day too.  I plan to make this Christmas morning.

I've always found that the longer you let french toast casserole sit, the better chances you have at it turning out. I made a few small changes: I used a can of fat free evaporated milk for most of the milk and then just adding additional regular milk up to three cups and instead of waiting to sprinkle the cinnamon-sugar over the top after baking, I did it after I poured the egg/milk mixture over the cubed bread. I also over-greased my baking dish REALLY well as I've learned from past experiances that french toast casseroles love to stick. This was a little mushy but for the most part, it was quite good. I warmed some homemade maple-vanilla syrup and we had that over the top. I'd make this again, though I think I might cut an egg out and some of the milk called for. I think it might be perfect then.

This couldn't have been any easier. I prepared it the night before and threw it in the oven when I woke up. When I brought it in for our breakfast pot luck it was still warm and was devoured! I got many requests for this recipe. It is a very impressive dish that takes little work!

I've made this recipe a couple of tiimes and the first time I made it, it did not come out that well as many of the reviews have stated. However, I saw the potential in it and tweaked it until it came out great. I reduced the eggs to 5 and only used 2 cups of milk then let it bake for an hour at 350 degrees. Once it came out of the oven, I let it sit uncovered for another 20-25 minutes before I served it to allow the center to become a bit firmer. It came out amazing. Even my picky nephews loved it!!

After reading a lot of the other reviews, I used less liquid and baked much longer than said at a higher temperature - it still ended up very mushy. Basically, this is a bread pudding recipe because that is the final texture.  If you don't like bread pudding, don't make this recipe.  If I were ever to make it again, I would use even less liquid, bake in a very shallow pan and spread it very thin across the bottom of the baking dish to force more of it to bake.

Based on the comments here, I reduced the milk (I used skim) to 2.5 cups. I baked it in a 9x13 dish, so it was shallow, soaked it overnight, then gave it a quick toss before baking to wet any bits that still looked dry. I had no trouble with mushiness at all. As some had mentioned blandness, I added extra cinnamon and a sprinkle of pecan chips. Easy, delicious and smelled great. I'll definitely make this again. Would be great with apples, berries or other fruit, too.

If it is mushy when you eat it, you need to let it sit and cool a little. I thought it was mushy when I first tried it, too. But later on I picked up a piece that had been sitting there for like 30 minutes and ate it and it was perfect, and all the pieces that were reheated afterwords were fine. I know it sounds like "eww... leaving my food sit out." But it's only french toast, so it didn't bother me.

This recipe turned out great! I topped it with a little bit of homemade buttercream frosting instead of the butter and syrup, and it tasted fantastic!

This was great! I used cranberries and raisins but next time I am going to use the cinnamon raisin swirl bread and then add cranberries! Yes it was a tad mushy but kinda expected that you know with bread and milk ;-). I was really good and super easy!!

Disappointed!  I couldn't wait for this to come out of the oven because it smells really good, but it was very bland!  Maybe with some major adjustments it would be better.

I did not care for this recipe! I used a shallow baking dish and didn't even add all of the milk and egg mixture and it still turned out mushy, even after baking a bit longer.

everyone else loved it, but to me it tasted more like bread pudding, and i was not a big fan. I would not make it over again.

I made this to bring to work for the holidays and was asked for the recipe immediately.  Since many other reviewers had trouble with it being too moist I used 5 eggs and added a bit more bread to it. I prepared it in the evening and then cooked it the next morning for an hour.  It's so easy and was a big hit.

I thought this was a great recipe.  My husband loved it!  The only change I would make would be to add some nuts - like pecans.  This dish could have 1/2 cup of raisins AND a 1/2 cup of cranberries.  Really great dish.  Thanks for sharing!

Not sure what I did wrong! Did not turn out at all! The middle was very mushy even after cooking it longer than the allotted time. I followed the directions to a T. I cook all the time...and I have never had anything turn out like this. It did smell good while it was in the oven..and i think there is potential. Just wasn't there for me I guess. HAHA

I loved it! I added mini chocolate chips to make it a sweet treat! It reminded me of bread pudding.  Also, I used egg beaters and 2 percent milk. It cooked for 45 minutes and was perfect in the center. I will keep this recipe!

I really loved this, it was soooo easy and yummy!!!  I had it with raisins instead because they are my dad's favorite, and I made it for my family.   They didn't have any Pepperidge Farm bread where I went but the store had it's own brand and it was fine.  It seems impressive to the people you serve it to but it's not that much work.  Thanks for submitting, it's a keeper!

I love this recipe, I make it all the time because it keeps well for several days. I make it just as the recipes states with 2 exceptions. I use 3 tsp of vanilla and dried blueberries instead. This one is so easy, just let it all sit overnight and bake in the morning!

I did not like this recipe at all. I made this the other morning for me and my boyfriend. I prepared it the night before. I pretty much used the exact recipe. The only thing I changed was that I used raisin cinnamon swirl bread and only used 2 cups of milk. I baked it for 45 min and the top was burnt in some areas but when we ate it, it was gooey. My boyfriend described it as the consistency of oatmeal. He couldn't finish it and neither could I. Very disappointing.

This recipe was very bland.  I did not add the raisins and cranberries due to my family's dislike for them.  I baked it in a square deep dish baking stone.  I had to bake it 10 minutes longer turning it up to 375.  I believe the cinnamon swirl and raisin bread would be better.

Will try again but the center was sort of soft even after baking it for ten minutes more then the recipe said. I think maybe less eggs or at least an hour to bake might help. Other then being mushy it had a nice taste

My family loved it!  I added only about 2 cups of milk, some extra cinnamon, and baked it a little longer.  Then I let it sit for about 15 minutes.

Awesome! I took the advice of another review and used 5 eggs & 2 cups milk and baked it in a 13X9 pan on 350 for 1 hour. It was crispy and still alittle soft (not mushy) the whole family loved it!!!!!

Yum! I made this pretty much according to recipe except I used dried blueberries instead of raisins or cranberries.  It came out really well!  I agree with the other reviews that it wasn't as sweet as I expected and needs a little syrup.  I'll definitely whip this one up again!

Made for brunch today, adding dried cranberries, refrigerated overnight, covered with plastic wrap. Sprinkled with cinnamon sugar after baking. Very good, not too sweet, served with maple syrup.

I have made this for several occasions and every time I have gotten rave reviews. Make sure to adjust cooking time for your oven. The first time I did not have time to let it sit and it was still great, so easy!

this was just kind of blah. i read all the prior reviews and made a few alterations (less half and half, etc) but in the end, it just really wasn't all that flavorful.

very good and very easy. great because it isn't too sweet so when you add the syrup it's just right. i'll give it 5 stars because this is the first time i've eaten or made "baked" french toast so i have nothing else to compare this to.

We loved this, but I made several changes after reading the reviews:  (1) Used skim milk and reduced to 2 cups, (2) Reduced eggs to 5, (3) Added cinnamon and nutmeg to egg mixture, (4) Used challah instead of the recommended bread, (5) Replaced half the raisins with dried cherries, (6) Baked 50 minutes in a 9x13 pan.  It came out perfect, not mushy.

I made this to serve 4 people.  We had two houseguests staying with us.  It was such a hit that I might have one serving left.  I assembled it the day ahead and let it soak in the fridge.  Very quick and easy!

I tried to make this for Christmas morning, but it was a soggy mess.  I think I will try it again, but I will use less milk, and probably a much more shallow pan.  It has potential, but it didn't add anything to our holiday this year.  Luckily I had other breakfast foods prepared as well!

Just had this for Christmas breakfast. It was simple to put together and smelled wonderful baking while we opened presents.I was worried it would be too sweet, but surprisingly it was not that sweet at all. I served it with maple syrup on the side, it was the perfect compliment. I left out the cranberries and used raisins only. Wonderful breakfast treat! I will be sure to make this for many other breakfast celebrations.

I hadn't read the reviews before making this but they were correct in it being mushy.  I made according to the directions but cooked it at 375 for 45 mins.  Since it was still mushy I increased the temp to 400 for another 15 mins.  If I decide to make this again I'd decrease the amount of milk by at least a cup.

I have tried this twice. Second time was significantly better. Added more vanilla, 3 packets of splenda, sprinkled top with cinnamon/sugar before baking, and needs to be cooked for one hour. Will continue to bake with my modifications. Also, used a longer pan. Enjoy

I thought this tasted much better the 2nd time I heated it. It was kinda mushy the 1st time around. I am going to stick with the Sausage Brunch Casserole recipe next time around.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I used egg beaters in place of the eggs to lower the fat content.  Very good side dish for a brunch.

Made this ahead per the instructions.  It took longer to cook (I do have an actual thermometer in the oven to check the temp); I had to add extra time to get the eggs fully cooked.  By the time the eggs were done, the top was way to crispy and bordering on burned.  It tasted good after working around the crispy top.

This recipe is really good, so long as you let it sit overnight in the fridge.  Let it sit for about 12 hours, and the bread soaks up all the custard so it is not soggy the next morning.  I left out about 1/2 a cup of milk and 1 egg and baked it in a 9x13 pan for about 45 minutes.  If you only let it sit for an hour or so, you'll get a big soggy mess.  This also reheats well for breakfast the next day.

This was ok. I used only 5 eggs and 2 cups of milk as others suggested. It was not mushy since I let it sit for 30 minutes after baking. My friends seemed to really enjoy it. We all had two helpings. I think regular French toast is better.

Very good and easy recipe. I chose to use baking raisins, milk, and cinnamon sugar.  I made for Christmas for a group and all really liked it.  I had to cook slightly longer to cook the center and the edges browned more than I wanted, but all in all, a good tasting recipe.

The whole family loved this! Picky eaters included. We don't have a problem with it being mushy. I am guessing it probably has a lot to do with if you use skim milk or half and half. I use one cup half and half and the rest milk and it comes out great. I would also recommend letting it rest for fifteen minutes or so out of the oven.

I used Cinnabon maple brown sugar wheat bread and it was awesome. I also added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg.

This dish had a very good flavor but it was a little to soggy and mushy for my liking.
