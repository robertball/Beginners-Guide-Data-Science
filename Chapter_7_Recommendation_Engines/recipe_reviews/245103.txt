With just a couple of changes using almost all the same ingredients, this would be a 5 star recipe.  First and foremost of all, this needed salt.  Second, the amount of flour was way too much for the amount of chicken called for--maybe just use half a cup.  Third, the amount of cornstarch was way too much---maybe just start with 2 teaspoons and add more if needed.  The ingredients are good and with just a couple of these changes, I think you'd have a great meal.  I hope you will try this!  This recipe deserves a chance!

I used olive oil instead of butter and I used water instead of an egg...the meal still had good flavor but it was soggy my mother-in-law really liked it & thinks using porkchops would b good 2.  If I make this again I will try the butter to brown the chicken instead 2 try 2 get it more crispy. Otherwise it was really good. Oh ya, using oil made the chicken cook faster & when it was in simmer mode it cooked it too much. It came out a little dry but not horrible.
