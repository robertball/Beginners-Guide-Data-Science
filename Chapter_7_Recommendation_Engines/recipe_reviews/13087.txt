This is good low-calorie soup if you do it right.  I omitted the butter, flour, rice, cream and pepper (hello, its hot already!)  I instead used 2 tsp of olive oil for the butter.  Instead of using flour, I used 1 cup of potatoes, diced fine (in place of rice), since it will thicken up a stew anyway.  I added 1% fat milk instead of cream, and passed around light sour cream for everyone to dollop on top (which totally was delicious, don't leave it out!)  I used a total of 200g of raw chicken as well.  The calories for me turned out to be 58 per 100g (I weighed the whole thing after cooking and then calculated a 100g serving.) fat 1.2g, carbs 6g, and protein 5.8g.  (These calcs do not include the sour cream on top.)  I'll definitely make it again, husband gave it a 10/10!  And I grated the carrots, since I'm not a fan of them in dice form.

Fantastic soup....just like wine, it gets better with time. Two or three days later the soup tasted even better than the first day. In my opinion, the cream is completely unnecessay...sooo good w/o it.(and less fattening too) Even my 8 year old and 18month old gobbled it up asking for more...definately double the recipe, or triple and freeze. Thank you so much!UPDATE: I have made this soup about 10 times now....I always double the recipe, add 3 tablespoons of yellow curry (so much more flavor) and I cut the apples in larger cubes cuz you can taste them so much more like that, and I use brown rice instead of white and just let it simmer longer. SO GOOD!

Really delicious!  As is, a rich, decadent first course/appetizer. I admit, though, that I upped the curry to 2 tsp and added cayenne, as another reviewer suggested. I also added pre-cooked brown rice to the soup, rather than raw white rice, because I have a lot of extra in the fridge. I also minced the apple, so my cooked-fruit-shy husband wouldn't notice. He didn't have a clue!

Updating my review here: I have since made this chunkier and another time pureed.  We like it best either pureed or very finely chopped.

Should be 10 stars. I made a HUGE batch of this based on the reviews, and am SO glad I did. I tried it before adding part cream/part coconut milk, and it was good and flavorful, but the creamy mixture brought it all together wonderfully! The house smelled great for more than a day. I LOVE this! - adding to original review - I used a 1/2 and 1/2 mixture of red and yellow curries, and also added the same amount of Garam Masala as I did the curry.  I have also stopped using butter, and switched to coconut oil and all coconut milk instead of cream. Pinot Nior was a perfect wine to have with this!

I took this basic recipe and added a few things I had around. 1 clove garlic, handfull of chopped fresh spinach, 1/2 cup diced mushrooms were added to the veggies. Then when it was finished I removed 1 cup and liquified it to make the soup creamier & left out the cream completely. Wonderful taste and nowhere near the fat & calories.

Delicious recipe. The only change I made was I shredded the apple with a cheese grater instead of chopping it up. The apples melted right into the soup and the soup was de-lish. (I just didn't care for the texture of cooked, softened apple chunks in my soup)

Excellent! I doubled the curry and used 1/2 and 1/2 and it tastes just as good but with fewer calories. I also used a rotiseree chicken and it adds a lot of great flavor to the soup. I also add about a cup more broth because I also add more carrots and rice. Really great recipe! Thanks so much! My husband begs for this soup all of the time!

Love this soup! I didn't have ready-made stock, so I used Better Than Bouillon Chicken flavor; very tasty, but I'm glad I didn't add any salt. The bouillon took care of that! Like other reviewers, I used 2tsp curry powder because we love it. Very delicious!

A very simple and extremely delicious recipe!  This recipe is not pureed like most Mulligatawny I have had but is nice with the pieces of vegetables, chicken, etc.  I also added a large clove of minced garlic with the vegetables at the beginning.  Thanks for a terrific recipe.

Yummy! Wow this soup is AWESOME. It's a great size recipe for one person and some reasonable leftovers!I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream and it was still remarkable. I plan to add this to my regular menu planning!

When I first made this soup I only made as much as the recipe called for,...then I tasted it. Trust me on this, double this recipe if your going to make it!! It goes very fast.  This soup is probably my new favorite soup. One other thing I kind of added, is I added about 1/2 teaspoon or 1 full teaspoon of red pepper flakes in the with chicken broth, depending on if your making the recipe as is or doubling it.  I also added my cut up chicken in with the chicken broth so it would cook, because I didn't have any cooked chicken laying around.  Definetly make this soup, you won't be sorry you did!

Yum! A sweet and spicy curry soup with nice texture and appearance which I'll certainly be making again, though with a couple of minor alterations: **Double both the curry (I used mild) and the apple**. Also note that those who don't like curry will absolutely despise this recipe, so be forewarned that there's no point in sharing any with such hopelessly lost souls- take this into consideration when planning your portions. Luckily this soup warms up well though as I've been single-handedly enjoying all 6 of my servings for the past week!

I've been making this soup for two years and just realized I've never rated it.  This is hands down my family's favorite soup.  I make huge batches and freeze it in six-serving containers.  I substitute brown rice for white, triple the apples and shred them to make a fabulous broth.  I do not add the cream, but I add a touch of half and half at the end.  Thanks for sharing, Lise.

Unbelievable! 5 stars does NOT do any justice to this perfect recipe.  I followed it exactly as the recipe stated but doubled it so I had enough for leftovers. Oh, but I did use basmati rice which kept the dish a true Indian soup. It has the best curry flavor and the chicken and vegetables are juicy and tender. My mouth is watering just remembering how good it was! I picked up some naan from our local Indian Restaurant to dip in the soup but the soup is hearty enough without it. Love this soup and will definitely make again for company. YUMMY!

quite  good.  I did add some chopped butternut squash that I had in the fridge needing to be used up.  Tasted finished soup as is and it did seem to lack something.  Gave it a few generous glugs of sherry.  Voila!  Tried it with and without the cream (half and half).  Liked it better without.  Garnished with cilantro.  Will make again.  Thanks for a good recipe

It turned out chunky and full of flavor and moderately spicy. You can start this just like a regular chicken soup w/o the broth. I had the breast bones, so I added them along with a cube of chicken bouillon to get the flavor, and also added two cups more of water. Other than that, it was no sweat to make it, but to eat it :-). We never had this soup before -only heard about it in the soup nazi episode of Seinfeld- so I think that was an advantage.

This soup was amazing...as good or better than my favorite Indian restaurant! As I did not have cream on hand I used coconut milk as was used in some of the other recipes I found online. Also I left out the apple. Will certainly be making this soup again and again.

This soup was amazing!  After reading several reviews and knowing that i like a lot of spice in my food, I changed the amount of curry powder to 2tbs (I used hot madras curry powder) and added 1tbs of garam masala.  I also used 3 cloves of garlic.  I used basmati rice instead of white (as should be used in all Indian dishes) and i used half chicken stock and half chicken broth (just what i had on hand).  I didn't have any cream so i added a little yogurt in one bowl and tried another bowl without it and it was actually much better without adding it.  The yogurt took some of the spice and flavor away from the soup.  I'm going to be getting some cream tomorrow so I will try that and see if it changes the flavor for the better but for how great it tasted without adding anything i don't know if that's possible!  I will be making this regularly!

Wow, this soup is delicious! I made only minor changes such as adding 2 tablespoons of curry instead of the teaspoons, adding additional amounts of the veges and putting in an extra cup of broth (just to keep it soupy). I agree with other reviewers that the cream is not necessary; I used half and half instead and it was just superb. I think next time I will skip it altogether and save the calories. Cant wait to make this again!

This recipe is really really surprisingly good. The only issue I have with it if I follow the recipe as it is the flavor is just a little weak (for mine and my families) taste buds. So I made a few changes: I doubled the chicken, doubled the apple (used a whole apple), tripled the curry powder, added a tsp of garam masala, and about a cup and a half of petite diced green peppers. I also added the cream directly to the pot and allowed it to simmer for another minute or so. It was really, really good. I would certainly make this again!! I served it with naan.

Absolutely amazing, I used canola oil rather than butter and only 1 tbs.  I did not add cream since I am dairy averse.  I also left out the cilantro because I don't like it.  I was sad that I didn't get more meals out of it!!  But I don't actually suggest doubling the recipe for leftovers because the apple loses its flavor and texture the next day.  It's still really nice, but more than one day may be pushing it.

I wish I could give this soup 172 stars!  It is amazing, amazing, amazing!  I have never made anything like this, but have been having and increasing appetite for curry lately.  This did not disappoint!  I will make this all the time!  I doubled the recipe as others suggested and added extra curry and cayenne as others suggested.  I also added a bit extra rice, just because I love rice!  This is an awesome soup!  Thank you so much for sharing!!!!!

I cook a lot of new recipes in my house and my husband has rated quite a few 5 stars. This one he said was by far the best dish I've ever made. I cooked the apples until they were almost melted into the soup and used brown rice. AH-MAY-ZING!

Made exactly as recipe states other than using brown rice.  It was delicious! 
I used a macintosh apple and red onion.
My husband has decided it's one of his new favorites.  He had 2 servings.
By the way, this might be 6 servings if you serve a cup of soup, but it's only 4 bowls of soup.  I'll double next time.

My family all loves this soup!! It's absolutely delicious. Definitely double the recipe if you're serving more than two people - even doubled, we only get about 6 good-sized bowls out of it. The cream does make it rich, so I may try decreasing the amount next time I make this. Also, the rice can get out of hand if you leave it in there too long before you're ready to eat it - the first time I made this, it was more like a casserole! Still very good, but the second time I waited longer until I put in the rice. Perfect!

Awesome! I might have put more rice than needed, cuz it turned out thick so I added  extra stock. Here are some tips:
- No salt needed
- Didn't think thyme was needed, but I added some anyway.
- Ingredients must be finely chopped (it taste better this way)
- I grated the carrots instead of chopping them.
Awesome soup, would definitely make it again!

Very delicious and healthy too!  Looking at other reviews, I doubled the recipe.   Also, I used brown rice which required longer cooking but adds a little more nutritional value and I didn't add the apples until the last 25 minutes.  I also added broccoli florets the last 5 minutes of cooking and added about 1/4 cup of coconut milk.  My 5 y/o twins loved it as did my husband.  All wanted seconds!!!

Yummy! I always simmer my soups for several hours before serving.  With this soup, I tasted it after simmering for an hour and it wasn't quite right.  After another 4 hours it was perfect.  I used a gala apple and added a teaspoon of garam marsala.  I also used brown basmati rice which I cooked before adding it to the soup, and added half and half instead of heavy cream (gotta watch those calories!).  This soup was delicious, even my youngest son who usually doesn't like curry flavor loved this soup!  I served this soup with warm naan bread.

This soup was great! I can't eat chicken so changed the chicken broth to vegatable, used turkey and a little soy milk --my guests who "don't really like curry --had seconds. Definitely a keeper.

Not bad, I would make it again.  This was my first mulligatawny soup.  I used turkey stock which I had on hand instead of chicken stock and I didn't have a celery stalk, but the rest was as described.  The flavour was nice but next time I'd make twice the recipe and maybe double the apples after that (maybe that's because the turkey stock is a stronger flavour).

I was so excited about making this soup, given all the positive reviews.  It was good, but it was not great.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I thought it tasted even better on the second day. But, again, I thought it was just good - nothing extraordinary.

Outstanding! I could taste this even with my allergies giving me sinus problems. I threw in 1/2 c. cauliflower, and next time might also add 1/2 c garbanzo beans. Perfect with hot bread!

I made this soup exactly per the recipe.  I hate to think about the calories, but it is so delicious!  Husband said it is definitely a "keeper" recipe.  It's very easy to make, just a little time-consuming.

This is terrific!  I used 2 cloves of garlic minced, 2.25 tsp of mild curry powder, 2 tbs of flour, about 3/4-1 cup of onion, 3 carrots, 1.5 celery and a 1/4 cup of rice.  I also chopped 1/2 a apple and grated the rest of the apple.  The heavy cream is not necessary.  For more tender chicken, I didn't add it until after the soup has simmered with the rice.  I prefer this soup with homemade chicken broth but in a pinch store bought will also work. Update: I used 2 cloves of garlic minced, 3 tsp of mild curry powder, 1 tbs cornstarch, 1 tbs of flour, 3/4 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, about 3/4-1 cup of onion, 3 carrots, 1.5 celery.  No rice.  I also chopped 1/2 a apple and grated the rest of the apple. Update 3:  2 tsp salt, 1 tsp coarse black pepper, 4 tbs cornstarch, 3 tsp curry powder, 4 garlic cloves, 3 sprigs thyme.

This is delicious!  The only change I made was using plain yogurt in place of the cream. (I just never buy heavy cream)  I microwaved the yogurt right in the plastic container for about 45 seconds and it worked perfectly.  Unlike a lot of soup recipes that use chicken breast meat (instead of dark), the chicken comes out very tender.  The vegetables and apple get very soft and creamy.  I've never been a fan of Indian food until now.  The curry really makes this dish savory.  I agree with the other reviewers who say DOUBLE THE RECIPE - YOU'LL WANT MORE!

Creamy, flavourful, perfect! I used orzo instead of rice and it was great. I was a little worried about the number of servings, as we were going to have this as a main dish, but it made 4 large servings / 5 average ones. Thanks for another stapler!

I made this using leftover turkey and stock from the turkey carcass. It was a nice flavorful change from the standard turkey leftover recipes. This was very quick to make using a food processor to shred everything.  We like spicy food so I did add 2 t. hot curry powder. I like my mulligatawny a bit sweeter, so next time I will add a whole apple. Overall, very good.

Very good.  Needed to add some extra spices to give it more flavor. I threw in about a tablespoon or two of chopped fresh cilantro and it was great!  Also, this recipe was very easy to make.

I really liked this recipe.  Even my two year old son liked it (although he likes spicy things).  It is definitely different than the one from the local restaurant that is more pureed.  I was a little skeptical when I compared it to the recipe Mulligatawny Soup II which was much more complicated.  
I added 3 cloves of garlic to the vegetables and I also transferred the vegetables, etc to a slow cooker for 4 hours which seemed to work well.  I think next time I will leave the rice in the slow cooker for 30 minutes (rather than the 15 specified) because it was not quite done.

This soup is so delicious--my family and friends have had it several times and keep requesting it.  Even my friends who don't like curry enjoyed this soup.  I recommend doubling it so you'll have leftovers.

I love indian food so after making this recipe I think this is more for an irish person. The soup turned out very bland just like normal chicken soup. Luckily I had a whole day to think of what I should do to make it better.  We had a soup party to go to the next day.  I had to double the indian spices which included ground cumin, red chili pepper and tumeric.  Also added was fresh coriander on top and 3/4 can of coconut milk.  It really needs the coconut milk to make this soup exotic rather than plain chicken soup.  See Emeril's version.  He adds so much extra to his Mulligatawny that this recipe on this page lacks in flavor.

awsome soup!  I pretty much followed the recipe:  I used green onions, because I prefer the taste, and I added half heavy cream, half coconut milk, I also added cayanne pepper and used 3 tblsp. curry.  Overall great, very enjoyable, and fairly easy.

My husband says this is the best-tasting recipe I have made. I used a leftover grilled barbeque chicken breast and added extra curry powder. I don't see this yielding 6 servings unless it is served as one course of a dinner. We finished it in one meal. I served it with crusty bread.

Really liked this! Nice, light soup for summer. Good with and without the cream. I added more chicken and some water (I like soupy soup) but otherwise kept true to the recipe and my family really liked it, asked to make again sometime. Yay & thanks!

My husband described this soup as "memorable" and "super", so I guess he liked it! I liked it but perhaps not as much as he. I used one tblspn. of olive oil instead of the butter, low-sodium broth, a tblspn. of the curry, added tspn. of garam masala, a minced clove of garlic, and cayenne pepper and salt to taste. I also used brown rice instead of white. Instead of heavy cream at the end I served the soup with a dollop of plain yogurt and generous pinches of fresh cilantro.  We ate this with warm Naan bread and it was a meal unto itself.  I rated it 4 stars because in spite of all my changes it still needed more salt to make it come alive, and STILL wasn't the best mulligatawny soup I have ever had.  Also, it provided us with only four generous portions and certainly not six.  If I were making this for four people as a main meal I would definitely double the recipe to ensure there are seconds for everyone.  If this is just to serve as an appetizer, than you can probably squeeze six small servings out of the original recipe.  I will probably make this again and as suggested probably serve pinot noir as the beverage.

Delicious! I took other people's advice and doubled the amount of soup, added potatoes and added 3 tbsp of curry. I left out the apple (probably essential) but I didn't have it on hand. I also used scallions and 1/2 a red onion for the onions. Delicious, I mean delicious! My picky husband absolutely loved it. This is going in our monthly rotation of comfort foods that we can stretch for a few days. P.S. I used heavy cream and 2% milk. Tasted great!

Really delicious. Use a sweet apple. The second time I used a granny smith, and it lacked a little sweetness. But it was still great.

this soup is awesome. I have made it over and over and over... I really like spice, so I add 3 tbsp's of curry, and I always add a dollop of sour cream on top, I think that is a must, it 'makes' the soup...
when I first read the recipe ingrediants I thought the addition of apple was a bit weird, but whenever I make a recipe I always follow it exactly at first, then adapt it myself if I need to.. the little bit of apple in there (don't shred, do chunks) is delcious! while eating the soup, which is spicy, you get a bite of sweetness... all of the ingrediants work very well together... LOVE this soup.

Amazing soup!  I didn't have heavy cream so I used whole milk instead and it was still excellent tasting.  All the rest of the ingredients I used as listed.  I will be making this soup again, it was that good!

Awesome!  First effort to make something curry - it was delicious!  Used 1/2 stock and 1/2 water, vegan butter and no cream.  Wife loved it as well, but she likes it whenever I fix dinner and she doesn't have to!  Looking forward to trying the leftovers...

Total yum! I was afraid the curry would be so.... well... curry. Glad my fears didn't pan out. This is a wonderful, warm, soul satisfying soup on a cold day. To lower the fat, I divided the butter in half and added a couple tablespoons of olive oil. I also used whole milk in place of the cream. Delish.

I have been eyeing this soup for awhile and finally made it last night when the hubby wasn't feeling so well.  I used sweet potatoes instead of rice and upped the curry powder to two teaspoons.  Delicious!  I might try using Thai yellow curry paste next time.  Has anyone tried this?

Great recipe ! I changed it up a little by adding a 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon and 2 tsp. of cumin. It gave the recipe a slight kick while the cinnamon brought out the flavor of the apples.

Excellent. I used a Granny Smith apple and it was perfect for this! I added a pinch of red pepper flakes for flavor. It freezes well too!

Sorry, did not like this.  I have many other soups with similar ingredients that I would prefer to use.  I think the flour (which I've never seen in Indian dishes) gave it a bad taste.

This soup is THE BEST chicken soup ever! Even my husband liked it and he's very picky. This is going to be my go-to chicken soup from now on. No more grandma's chicken soup!! The only thing I did differently was I made the rice separately so everyone can add as much or as little as they wanted and I omited the cream because I didn't have it on hand. It was still superb!

This should get a much higher rating that 5 stars! Thanks so much for sharing this Lisa! Excellent! Absolutely delicious!!! The only thing I did differently was to add the spices at the end of the recipe, five minutes before serving, that way one gets the full flavor of the spices. Also, would not hurt at all to have a bit more rice, too... But just exactly the way this recipe is presented it is totally terrific!!! Thanks for sharing this one!!!

So so good! I don't really measure the apples, carrot, etc, just dump a bunch in and it works! Coconut milk is a good sub for the cream.

This was SO good!  Delicious, Simple, Filling, and Healthy.  I made a low carb (well, lower carb) version by omitting the carrot and rice (adding just a little extra chicken and celery instead).  I did use the flour since there's so little of it, but I'm pretty sure in hindsight that omitting that would have been fine as well.  Apples aren't low carb, of course, but just half of one in a huge soup like this is certainly nothing to worry about for most people.  Thank you so much for this lovely recipe!

This is a beautiful recipe, I think the rice and curry are the two elements that make it really special. I was recently living in a vegan houshold so made a few alterations to suit and I think the results were just as tasty. Low fat margarine can of course be used as a butter substitute. I used vege stock instead of chicken stock. A note for anyone trying to make sure their meal is vegan - many vegetable stocks contain milk and other animal products so double check the ingredients. I used potato instead of chicken but I suppose you could use tofu (I've never been much of a fan myself). Finally instead of cream I used coconut cream which added a new dimension of flavour. Coconut milk is a lower fat option but it won't have the same coconut hit - just the creamy consistency. Try it out as an alternative!

Hands down, one of my favorite recipes.  This is so easy to make and tastes wonderful!  I was skeptical about the apple thinking that it would be too sweet or mushy.  The apple almost all but disappears but adds great flavor.  Would give more than 5 stars if it would let me!!

We had no idea what to expect with this soup (we never heard of mulligatawny soup but decided to make it because of the interesting name).  After our first bite, we were hooked and will be making this again!

We lOVE this soup it has become a family favorite.  I add more curry powder and use a little milk instead of the heavy cream just to save calories and it is still delicious!

Was a little bland so needed extra salt/seasoning.  Otherwise very good.  I pre-cooked rice and chicken and grated apple and carrots.

I made this and my wife was asking for more.. the next day!  I had an oops and used 1 1/2 Tablespoons of curry instead of Teaspoons.  It was a GOOD oops.  Have tried it since with the right measure and we liked it better with the extra curry.  I waited and added the apples with ten minutes to go, so they were still crispy when the soup was done.  This is such a GREAT recipe!

We loved this soup it was so yummy. We had to make some substitute because we were missing some of the ingredients. My only complaint is that it had a bitter note when eating it.  It was nice and sweet to start then bitter.

I have made this soup twice now, both times a complete hit! My kids (4 and 1) love it, it is pretty quick and easy, and the leftovers are great too.

The only change that I made is to add a bit more rice.

WOW! This soup is AWESOME!!! It has so much flavor! I did cook the chicken with the veggies and I cooked the rice longer because 20 mins wasn't enough. I cooked it for about 45 mins and covered the pot. I subbed the all purpose flour with Whole Wheat Flour and subbed white rice with brown rice. I give this recipe 10 stars!!! Will make it again for sure!

Very good soup, and easy to make too!  However, next time I will add more curry because it needed more spice!

This soup is SO AWESOME!  My husband was so skeptical when I was making it that he went and bought some drive thru -- then ate 2 bowls once he tasted it ;)  All 3 of my kids (10, 8, and 4) LOVE this soup and get excited when I'm going to make it!  You must double it - there'll never be enough if you don't!  The only change I made was to use applesauce to get the flavor and sweetness but skip the chunks.  Definitely a soul warming comfort food - YUM!!!

this soup is delicious!  i never rate anything, especially if i've modified the recipe as that is not an accurate review but i had to comment on this.  i'm sure the recipe is even better when followed correctly but i made a few changes and still loved it.  i didn't have chicken broth so i used water to boil the chicken, strained it and added bullion cubes (1 for each cup of water) to make my broth.  i omitted the thyme as we didn't have any and substituted brown rice for white.  i also used wheat flour instead of all-purpose and fat free half and half instead of cream.  the changes were minimal and the taste was phenomenal.  in the end i added an extra cup of water to make it 1 cup per serving so it would be easier to figure out the weight waters points plus value  :)  i would absolutely make this again!

I make this soup for my family all the time, but most often in the fall.  I usually go lighter on the curry (for the kids) and omit the cream and the flour.

I had never had Mulligatawny soup before, and I wanted to try something different. It's just like Mom's curry over rice, but in a soup! Fabulous flavor - absolutely delish! Can't wait to heat the leftovers up for tonight's dinner! I used chicken thighs instead of breast because I like them better in soups/stews. And 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream. I doubled the recipe for a big pot and it made plenty! Served with fresh French bread. YUM!!

The flavor of this soup is excellent.  Due to my preferences, and what I had on hand, I made the following adaptations: whole wheast flour in place of all-purpose, used 2 small apples, cut out the rice but added extra chicken, omitted the thyme and cream, but used about a cup of coconut milk instead.  The result was FABULOUS!

This was so delicious! It reminded me of a chicken pot pie. It was excellent with homemade flat bread. I used olive oil instead of butter, frozen carrots instead of fresh, shredded the apple, and used half & half. Also, I added some garlic and frozen cauliflower. Definately worth a try!

really good! upped curry powder to 2 tsps, used a whole golden delicious apple and didnt really taste it,  will use a granny smith next time to get that nice tartness,also used all the dark meat from a rotisserie chicken,and substituted 1 russet potato for the rice, tried it with whipping cream and without both were ways were great. also added a clove of garlic. I'll be making this again soon and will try a spicier curry next time.

Yum yum! Very tasty, flavourful without being too spicy. I was a bit skeptical about the apple, but it works well in this recipe! I made it pretty much as written, except with a bit more onion, celery, carrot and apple than called for, and an extra tsp of curry powder (and still wasn't too spicy, so if you like it hot, you might want to add even more). I had wanted to increase the amount of rice just a little (like 1/3 cup), but it got away from me and I added more like 2/3 cups. I didn't have any extra chicken broth to balance it out, so what I ended up wasn't very soupy at all, but really tasty! I added the amount of cream called for (but used half and half), perhaps I should've added a bit less since there wasn't much broth left to mix it with, but I'm still really happy with the final dish! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I followed the recipe word for word, even doubled it looking forward to a fabulous soup.  I then waited a day or two, hoping for a good "meld" of flavors.

I first had Mulligatawny soup in Bali, Indonesia.  On one of the many flights over there, one of the channels on my in-flight TV set showed the "Seinfeld" Soup Nazi episode.  When I saw this soup on the menu at a restaurant in Ubud, I assumed Providence intervened to tell me to order this soup because the soup was ridiculously delicious.  So I was excited to make this recipe and it's good.  I substituted 2 T of olive instead of butter to cut down on fat.  I increased the curry powder to 1 T, and I added 2 t Garam Masala.  In adding Garam Masala, I omitted black pepper because Garam Masala has pepper in it.  Instead of adding salt, I threw in an extra cube of chicken bullion.  I tried both cream and omitting the cream and topping with sour cream instead.  definitely go with the sour cream on top.  Much better.  I remember in Bali they used dark meat pieces in the soup instead of breast meat (rarely do you see boneless skinless white meat in non-Industrialized countries) and if you don't have a problem with the calories, that's probably the way to go.

I used about 1.5-2 tablespoons of red curry paste to season this soup and it was just this side of being too hot--it was perfect. I steamed the veggies instead of sauteeing them in butter and left out the cream as the soup was good without it. really flavorful and quick soup to make, I'll definitely make it again.

I consider myself an Indian food aficionado and average cook, but this just didn't taste to me like authentic Mulligatawny soup.  I found this soup to be quite on the bland side.  I followed to directions to the TEE and I don't know what went wrong, if anything.  I think I'll move on and try another recipe to find that "taste" I am looking for.  I honestly don't see what all the fuss is about, definitely not 5 stars.

Really scrumptious, easy to make, and ready to eat in an hour.  You don't need to change a thing (though I used half-and-half instead of the heavy cream).  I'm not sure how this is stretched into 6 servings, though.  I recommend doubling the recipe for even 4 people, especially as everyone will want seconds!

Good soup--not the best.  First of all, yes, you mmust double.  Second, it's almost funny how recipes like this say curry and expect everyone to use the same one.  There are many different curries out there.  I assumed yellow here, because that is the most common but it could have been red, green, etc.  I used McCormick Spicy Curry, three tablespoons, and a couple dashes of cayenne and it was still pretty mild for a "pepper soup".  All in all, good, not great.  Probably won't do again.

I was so happy to find this recipe and try it.  This soup was served at one of my favorite restaurants that closed recently.  We loved this recipe and it was pretty close to the restaurants version.  I added some cayenne pepper to it and that completed it nicely.  It was an absolute hit with my husband too!  Definately will make this again.

I will be making this soup again as it was quite delicious.  However, I think next time I will prepare a meal where it is served as an appetizer or sidedish in smaller quantities, instead of making it the centerpiece of the meal as I did tonight.  It makes a very rich spicey soup.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Definitely double! We had this as a main course and ate so much.  It was delicious.  I'm not a big soup eater, and I loved this.  Unless you hate curry, I can't see why someone wouldn't like this.

I followed the recipe fairly closely. When I doubling I did not double the butter.  Added a bit more curry and a few dashes of cayenne pepper.  Also, I added the chicken when I added the broth. Wanted to make sure it had plenty of time to cook.

Wonderful, will definitely make again and again.

SLOW COOKER METHOD ~ I decided to make this in the slow cooker. The vegetables (Celery, Onion, Carrots and Haricot Verts as well as the 1/2 apple) Sauteed these for about 10 minutes with garlic, thyme, curry powder and black pepper until just softened (I used a little olive oil spray not the butter like the recipe stated), then added the rice to the pan to help to brown this a little and allow it to soak up more flavoring.  Added the vegetables/rice to the slow cooker along with 5 chicken breasts and 6 cups of chicken stock.  I DID NOT use the heavy cream or the flour.  Cooked on slow for 7 hours.  This really was a delicious and very easy soup, next time I think I will add just slightly more curry powder (or maybe a hot curry powder) and a little fresh cilantro.

Wow! So delish! I did double the recipe, and based on other reviews, I substituted 1/2 coconut oil and 1/2 olive oil in place of butter. I also used a full 14 oz. can of coconut milk in place of the heavy cream. I added 3 small spoonfuls of minced garlic, the heads from a bunch of asparagus, and a 6 oz. package of mushrooms to the initial saute. In place of an apple I used a whole large Asian pear (because I had one around), which I grated, and I added 16 dried red chilies, which cooked from the very beginning until the rice and pear were added (the soup had become spiced to my liking - I omitted black pepper). For the rice, I added in pre-cooked jasmine rice (2 c.), because I've had very bad luck with cooking raw rice into soups before.

Fantastic recipe. As I am a spicy girl, I will always try to +1.5 or double the original in terms of spices, nevertheless, it was incredible. Use the recipe just as it is and your family will be overly impressed. OKAY! Just made it again. I used a pre-cooked chicken from Costco and shredded the chicken. I also chopped up and through in a Habanero pepper. Niiiiiice.

Amazing soup! I made a double batch but will make at least a triple next time. I sauteed the chicken before adding it (deglazing with a splash of red wine), omitted the heavy cream and used olive oil instead of butter.

SO GOOD! I did make several tweaks to the recipe to make it more to my taste. I replaced the butter with olive and the rice with quinoa (turned out fantastic). I cut the heavy cream out completely and the product was still very thick and not at all runny. I didn't miss it at all. 

As others have said, I do think you need to double the recipe if you want leftovers (you will want leftovers! This stuff gets much better as time goes on!). Also, I didn't like the texture of the cooked apple so I grated it instead (1 apple gave around 1/4 c). I also added 1 tsp of sugar at the very end to give it a bit of a sweeter taste. Marvelous!

Absolutely delicious!! A very filling meal with baguette and cheese. I used 4 skinless chicken thighs and put them in the pot whole because I like the flavor the bones give. I removed the meat from the bones and put it back in the pot after cooked. I used brown rice instead of white and 14% sour cream instead of heavy cream.

I made this at my husbands request, but wasn't sure if I'd like it. It turned out really good and will become a regular in my house. The flavors were not very mild and built up more with each bite, just getting better! I highly recommend making it. I only changed 2 very small things. I used brown rice flour to make it gluten free, and also used leftover rotisserie chicken instead of a breast. My husband did say I should add a little more rice next time.

I made this soup for the family Christmas Celebration and it was a big hit. They were scraping the bottom of the pot! I made it exactly as the recipe is written except I doubled it and used 2 apples and 2 tblsp of curry powder. The family said I should open a soup shop and be the Soup Nazi like on Sienfeld. Everyone wanted the recipe! Thank you so much for this yummy soup!

OMG!  I am a horrible cook and nothing I make comes out good.  This recipe is easy and so delicious!!!  My husband can't stop talking about it!  The only thing I did different was shred the apple.  Perfect delicious recipe.  Oh... and if you don't want the cream in it still tastes delicious!

I like it okay. You really have to be in a curry mood. Next time I would add a little less rice. The rice seemed to be soggy and over cooked.

Simply Delicious! Used other reviewers' ideas: added chick peas, substituted olive oil for butter, added 3 shakes cayenne and used 2 1/2 tsp curry. This is a perfect base soup - maybe spinach would be a nice addition? Spiciness sneaks up with a subtle touch - what a treat.  Used brown basmati rice. We love it - served with toasted wheat bread strips with cheese.  YUM

I liked this soup, but my kids did not. I used dairy substitute, and found it essential to the flavor of the soup. Otherwise it is boring.

WOW!  This soup is fantastic!  I ended up doubling the recipe.  I also added twice the amount of curry powder that is called for.  It turned out wonderfully!  Make sure to add the heavy cream, it makes this soup soooo yummy and creamy!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Fantastic basic recipe.  I doubled it as suggested by others.  Used extra chicken (not needed) and added Garam Masala.  Excellent flavor.  I also bought pre-cut carrot and celery sticks that I ran through the food processor as a time saver.  Then used the food processor to chop the onion and shred the apple - quick and easy!  Added brown rice at the same time as the broth and just let it simmer until done. Also, for those that are lactose intolerant....I used 2% Lactaid instead of heavy cream.  Probably not as rich, but it smoothed out the soup very nicely!

Oh, my!!  Fabulous!!! I followed directions as written except I substituted olive oil for the butter to saute my veggies, used brown rice, and threw in a little fresh spinach and let it cook down in the soup.  I even put the heavy cream on top...yum!!  I also tried it with low fat sour cream in place of the heavy cream and that was dynamite also.  Thanks for this great recipe!!  A definite KEEPER!! :)

I added a large handful of dried cranberries when adding the apple. I also added the cream to the entire pot after cooking instead of individual servings. 

Make sure to double the recipe...it's delicious!

I used this recipe to expand my cooking horizons a bit....since I'm always on the go I usually keep it very simple.  I've always enjoyed Indian food so I thought I would give this recipe a shot, since it was so well reviewed.  

Anyway, I can see why it gets all these good reviews!  Delicious.  My husband loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderfully...I served it with naan and that was our meal (for a few days :))  can't wait to impress my friends with it!

Absolutely delicious!  Had left over baked chicken which I cubed and added in with the apples, which I preferred cubed as well [added a whole one], those little bites of apple were amazing!  Added the cream individually to each bowl but wished I had some coconut milk to throw in instead, next time!

YUMMO!  Mixed up my own curry powder (tumeric, cumin,  coriander, cayenne, ginger, clove, nutmeg) and used about 1 tablespoon of this yellow curry powder mix which is about double what the recipe calls for. Added a small golden delish apple diced, and 1 sm and 1 lrg skinless chicken breast diced to the simmering curry broth.  Also added a few garlic cloves and fresh minced ginger root...I have a cold and need the spice!!  Smells like a cure---adding some 2% milk to save some Kcals...Hubby is in heaven!!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  Boyfriend and I had this as our main dish, and the recipe yielded about 3 main dish servings.  Next time I would double the recipe to have more leftovers.  I also doubled the curry powder since I love it.  Thanks for an excellent and easy soup.

Absolutely delicious! I didn't change much aside from adding a little bit more curry and using instant rice. I didn't originally want to add the cream but the boyfriend wanted to and it tasted great with and without it. Will definitely be sharing this recipe with others!

Choose this recipe for our Christmas Day family dinner...WOW! It is beyond awesome. My husband said it was one of the best dishes he's ever had! It is really delicious. I used virgin coconut oil in place of butter; 50/50 chicken/seafood broth; and replaced chicken with shrimp (sauteed separately in coconut oil with garlic before mixing in). This dish is extraordinary! Thanks so much for sharing.

Great soup! Mine had a lot of broth, as I used pre-cooked brown rice and forgot to add less broth to compensate for what would normally be absorbed.  I also used olive oil instead of butter and fat-free half n half instead of heavy cream to make it a bit healthier :) will definitely go in the recipebook. Thanks!

I wasn't sure what this would taste like, but it is now one of my favorite soups! I doubled the recipe and it was perfect for two- plenty of left overs. I cut up a whole onion (small pieces), and sauted it with carrots and mushrooms. I used 2 purple carrots which gave it a nice color and I grated them. I also grated the apple based on other recommendations because I don't think I really like cooked fruit. With it grated I couldn't tell it was apple and I really liked it! I used chicken "Better than Bouillion" for the base which worked great (8 tsp with 8 cups water), and I used a whole cup of rice. I didn't add the celery or cream, and only used one chicken breast cut in small pieces and it was fine. I served it with Naan bread with melted cheddar cheese on it. Can't wait to share this with my sister and to make it again. Thank you!!

This was so good.   I cooked as is until it came to adding apple, chick and rice. I added apple first....then blended the whole pot with a immersion blender.  I had already cooked the rice so I then added cooked rice and chicken.   I added 1 halepeno and some minced garlic as well at the very end.   I will top with cilantro and a splash of lemon next time.  You atleast double this recipe.....it goes very fast.  I also added 3 tsp of curry.

This was awesome!!! My husband is not a soup/stew fan but he ate three bowls of this and said he would eat it again.  The only disappointing part was the apples.  They lost all flavor. Next time I will try a different type of apple.  But I still will make tihs again because all the flavors married very well and were very satisfying.

Well, everyone's right here folks. This soup is delicious, original and amazing. I made it exactly as stated and it's fantastic. Next time, I might switch the chicken breast for a few chicken thighs, since I find breast meat a little tough when boiled. But even with that, the flavors are just fantastic! YUMMY!

ahhhhh.  this soup is soooo good and easy.   we added extra carrots and onion one small red potato and 2 large chicken breast. we did not add the apple cause we didnt have one.  thought the rice ratio was right on. but with all we had it was great.  we like it better with the cream then without and added the salt at the very end before serving   after the soup simmers then you get a better fell for how much salt is needed.   this falls into the top ten soups for us.   a super easy soup to make and soooo flavorful.  thanks for the keeper

This is a keeper!  I tried to stick to the recipe, which would be great, but did kick it up to suit our family's taste.  I doubled it.  I added a tsp of minced garlic, and doubled the curry.  I used half n half. I didn't add the salt and used a low sodium better than bouillon chicken stock with water and used brown rice.  I loved it!  It was great topped with non-fat yogurt, too. ***made this again, tripled the recipe omitted the flour, use brown rice, milk, and added garlic, and doubled the curry.  Pureed then added the chicken and served topped with nonfat yogurt! It tasted amazing, still! And the leftovers will be even better!  My daughter has been begging for me to make this soup again since the first time we made it!

Recipe is off the wall.  Made it for a soup party and it was the favorite soup there.  Like others I doubled the curry, used Basmati rice and since I like soups on the creamier side I used a can of coconut milk along with the heavy cream.  Would like to know if it really gets better after a day or so, but there were no leftovers!!!

This recipe is fantastic~ Those leaving out the apple are really missing out & honestly being way too picky- it's not a strong apple flavour, and they cook to an almost unnoticable texture, and taste amazing.   I forgot the celery at the grocery store, not a big deal though, this soup was amazing. I doubled the broth, used an extra can of vegetable broth i had lying around and it was perfect for three hungrey people with a bowl left over.  I also used half and half instead of cream, and mixed in a tablespoon of cream of coconut which was soooo good :D A few sprigs of fresh cilantro REALLY make this

I was eager to try a 5-star soup!  And it was very good but, like a movie you're heard too much about, it couldn't live up to the expectations. I made 2 pots for a dinner party, one with chicken and one veggie.  Because tofu in Africa is hard to find, I ended up serving it plain, but the vegheads said it was wonderful anyway. I doubled the curry as recommended and also added Masala for a touch of sweeter spice. It helped.   Very good but not "the most amazing soup ever!"

Wonderful soup recipe! It turned out great the first shot and was very easy to make. I doubled the recipe, and have a delicious lunch for the rest of the week. Per advice from other reviews, I doubled (okay, tripled!) the curry because I think the suggested amount is too little. Also, I used 2 tbls of olive oil instead of butter to make it a little healthier, and tried using 1 cup of diced potatoes instead of rice and wheat. I grated the carrots and might try the same with celery next time, though it doesn't really matter. It turned out great, but next time I might stick to the rice. And I'm stoked to use coconut milk instead of cream next time! Haven't tried it, but I'm optimistic!

Holy cow!  This is an amazing recipe.  My husband informed me that he wanted me to make this again soon - this is a keeper! I followed the recipe exactly.  I do agree though that it was just enough for my family with no leftovers, so be careful to double it if you're serving more than three people.

This is simply wonderful soup. I add more veggies than it calls for (3 or 4 ribs of celery, 2 or 3 chopped carrots and a whole onion). Also a whole large apple ( or 2 if they are smaller). We love it served over mashed potatos. Truely comfort food !!!

Last night, I looked at my package of chicken tenders wondering what to do with chicken AGAIN. Then I saw this recipe. Deliciously different and easy to make. I scaled for 8 servings (we like leftovers) and changed very little from the original recipe, exc. for adding garlic and using celery salt since I had no celery. I used my chopper to chop my veggies and apple into very small pieces. The next time I make it, I will not cover my pot -- think it would have condensed and had an even richer flavor if not covered. Since my veggies were cut so small, I didn't simmer quite as long before adding the chicken, apples and rice. Could perhaps use bit more rice, and I added a whole small apple but would have liked more apple for that sweet-savory combo. A bit of ginger would also be great. Added the cream at the end, warmed in the microwave first. The cream added a delicious creaminess, but I agree that eliminating it would still create a delicious and a bit healthier recipe. LOVED this recipe and will make it again soon!

This was phenomenal and received a high score from my boyfriend! I made it so it was more thick and stew-like was so warm and comforting. While soup was cooking, the broth tasted way to spicy, but mellowed out a bit as time passed. However, it was super spicy and delicious. I made some adjustments based on other postings. For 12 servings:
- Sauteed veggies with 2 cloves of garlic
- Switched out butter with 1/4 cup olive oil
- Used 3 Tbsp Sherwoods brand curry powder
- Used 9 cups chicken broth
- Added 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
- Added 1 peeled, cubed yellow potato to apples
- Used 1 cup brown basmati
- Used 3 chicken breasts
- Used 1 cup light coconut milk

I also used an immersion blender at the for a few seconds to make it that much more creamy.

Notes for next time: Was extremely thick - reduce rice to 3/4 cup and consider 2 1/2 chicken breats. Perhaps reduce curry to 2 1/2 Tbsp. Rice took much longer than 15 minutes (took 35-40 minutes). Next time I will add rice when I add the broth. 

I served with a warm sourdough baguette - truly amazing. A favorite recipe. A must try

I made this soup for class of grade 3 children studying India.  I thought it might be a bit much for them but they loved it and had 3 and 4 servings.  They liked it WITHOUT the cream.  I used cut up chicken and made my stock with that and then added the meat back in.  Thanks for the recipe.

Getting ready to try this recipe (after Simpsons is over) and figured I would start with the few changes I will be making.  I am out of carrots so will be adding peas towards the end, no biggie.  As other reviewers suggested I will definitely add more curry powder.  The more the better.  Will use brown rice instead of the white because, well because I love brown rice.  Since I don't generally have heavy cream on hand I will  omit it.  Final change will be using turkey instead of chicken (thanksgiving leftovers).
  Update:  So the soup is done...seemed to turn out perfect and smells wonderful. The slight sweetness from the apples really paired well with the flavor of the curry and the chicken (or for me turkey).  Delicious!

I've made this soup twice so far, and am just now getting the opportunity to review it. The taste is wonderfully divine. I've been increasing my cooking skills in Indian cuisine more lately, and had to try this recipe. I must say, this is a bit Americanized compared to others, but the taste does not reveal that one bit, it seems! My husband loved it ( and that says a lot when he tells you over and over ) :D  He does not like cooked apples either, so I would suggest grating the apple if you add it. I omitted the second time, and my husband told me to leave the recipe like it is.   I did not feel the need to add the cream. However, I feel that coconut milk would be a wonderful addition to it instead of cream or half and half... Much Healthier, too!!! Good monounsaturated fats are always the way to go.  Thank you for this awesome recipe. This will not be made around the house at least several times a month. ;D   UPDATE: 3/19/09 -- I STILL LOVE THIS SOUP! And so does my husband. :D I can never go wrong with soup. I always add more carrots than what it calls for, though. :D  YUM, YUM! :)

My husband loved the soup, I wasn't sure if I did. I added a whole apple and still couldn't taste it very well. You might want to add it a little later than called for so it doesn't get so overcooked. Overall, it was alright.

This was sooo good.  I added about 1/2teaspoon of garam masala with the dish to bring out more of the Indian flavors.  I also used Vit D milk instead of the cream...everything was fantastic!

I also enjoyed this recipe very much. I have actually made it twice.  The first time I followed the directions exactly, but I found that I couldn't taste the sweetness of the apples at all. I thus doubled the apples - which is really nice. I also added a small handful of yellow raisins when the rice went in.  I've had it this way before, and it turned out lovely!

This soup always makes me think of the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld...anyway, this is a great find - thanks for the recipe.  I do add some additional seasonings, but that is just due to personal preference.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good soup.  I added about 3/4 cup (a generous handful, I didn't really measure) of golden raisins about halfway through the first simmer, to give them time to plump and to make it more like a version I'd had from a local gourmet grocery store.  I also used fat-free half and half instead of the cream (mostly because it's what I had on hand).

The second time I made it, I added a little more vegetables and rice.  If you add more rice, be sure to add extra broth.  I'll be making this over and over.  Thanks.

Easy soup with a great flavor. To make it lower in sodium and fat, I used unsalted butter (decreased to 3 tablespoons), low sodium chicken broth, and half and half in place of the heavy cream.

I messed up during the beginning of this recipe and added green peppers. Once I realized I was looking at the wrong recipe, I switched over and finished it up the correct way. Even with the confusion my husband thought the soup was great. My son, however, didn't care for it which is why I only gave it four stars. It was definately a lot easier to make then other recipes with the same name. Since this is the first time we have ever tried Mulligatawny, I can't say whether or not it tasted like real mulligatawny, but it was still a very good soup.

Definitely double the recipe if you’re making it for 2 or more people!  I added about 1/4 c low-fat coconut milk and a couple pinches of cayenne pepper. We loved it.

We liked this soup a lot but the quantity of butter in the recipe was absolutely absurd.  I wish I had read a couple reviews before making it, which would have led me to substitute some of the butter for olive oil.  I did add cayenne as other reviewers suggested, and I was glad I did.   The soup also needs more curry.  I did about 1.5 times the amount suggested and I would double it next time.  In short, good soup but I feel like I’ve eaten ten pounds of butter, which is rather disturbing.

This was a good healthy soup. I did what others tryed and used potatoes instead of rice and olive oil instead of butter. I like my soups spicy so I added some cayenne pepper and some red pepper flakes. If you want to stay healthy don't add the cream it's awesome without it.

We loved it. I did follow others' suggestions and doubled the curry. Actually doubled the entire recipe too. (But DO double the curry) I used homemade chicken stock. My husband thought it was REALLY good. He interrupted me to tell me how much he loved it. Good enough for me! I am SO making this again!

Wow.... we have made this soup 3 or 4 times and it's spectacular everytime.

You can go light on the cream or use half and half if you want to keep the calories down too. Less cream makes very little difference in taste in my opinion.

The one thing I would suggest is to consider 'heat" levels. Curry Powder is available in Mild, Medium and Hot. we have made this soup with Mild and Medium to date and both were excellent.

This was an excellent base but not spicy enough for my palette.  I made the recipe as written then added a few more spices.  When I added the flour and curry, I also added Turmeric and a dash of nutmeg.  Toward the end of cooking I added a little ground coriander seed, a little cayenne and some Garam Masala.  It was perfect and soul satisfying.  Thanks for the recipe.

Simply incredible. This was one of the first recipes I made from this site, and I've just made it again. Absolutely fantastic. I added some chili powder as well because I was serving people who liked spicy food. Added a teaspoon of cream right from the fridge to the piping hot bowl of soup in a spiral pattern just to add to the presentation. Thanks for sharing this!

This was alright. We like Indian cuisine but hadn’t eaten this particular soup. It was not quite what we were expecting but in fairness to this recipe, we changed some things based on reviewer suggestions. If made again, we would stick closer to the version as written to better know if Mulligatawny Soup could be made more to our liking.

This is the best recipe for mulligatawny soup I've tried. I had no curry powder; instead I used 1 1/2 tablespoon of Patak's curry paste. I served it with avocado and fried ripe plantain slices (you find ripe plantains in latin stores; the riper, the better...). Delicious combination.

Very good recipe!  I was looking to duplicate the soup at my favorite restaurant so I made this with a few changes.  I made my own broth with a couple of chicken thighs, added some chopped red and green peppers and left out the salt, butter, flour and didn't have any heavy cream. Instead I added a can of cream of chicken soup (lowerfat & sodium) and cooked the rice separately.  If you are not accustomed to curry, add a little at a time and test.

This is my second time making this soup, and it is always amazing.  My household is only made up for 2 people, but I always make enough for 8-10. We eat it for dinner (twice, since we always go back for seconds!) and save it for the next few days. I haven't yet included the apple because I've been discouraged by my partner, but I will sneak one in next time.  The only other change I make is to add 1/2 cup french lentils and 1 teaspoon of cumin. I think the cumin is essential to get the real depth of flavour that this soup deserves.  Delicious.

UPDATED:  Have now made this soup around 7 times. I added in the apple and my partner and I both LOVED it (and I really dislike cooked apples.) It does not make the soup taste sweet or sour, but provides a very unique, mild tartness to the soup that helps enhance all the other flavours, much the way adding cream does. Do not hesitate to use both the apples and the cream - they really, really do make a difference to the final product! Excellent dish!

AWESOME.   Added more curry, thyme and rice as I like my soups thicker.....also added my cream when I added the chicken. I am a bit of a cream fanatic and like for it to simmer in my sauces/soups for awhile.

Really enjoyed this recipe; it reminded me of a Russian recipe that I love topped with sour cream and cilantro.

My family loves this recipe.  The curry gives it a unique flavor and the apple and cream make it wonderful on cold nights.  We often take it to parties and get tons of raves and recipe requests.  It is one of the few recipes I don't revise at all; it's perfect exactly as is!  I highly recommend doubling the recipe it's that good.

Fantastic!  I served this at a dinner party with my neighbors and everyone loved it.  The only changes I made were to add a clove of garlic and I doubled the curry.  I also omitted the cream and instead served a tsp of sour cream on top with a few green onions for presentation.  Will definitely make this again.  I've already had a few requests for it.

Delish!  Omitted the flour and cream, used EVOO, added a tad more curry, and used brown and wild rice.  If you are unsure about adding the apple, don't be.  It adds a little bit of sweetness, but you cannot actually taste the apple.
Will definitely make again!

Super easy to make, and of course with that much butter how could it not be yummy. I sauteed the chicken breasts whole (used 3 instead of 2 for a double batch) before sweating the veggies. I shredded the chicken and added it back once I added the stock. I prefer the chicken shredded, since it doesn't seem to get as dried out. Used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream, but next time I think I'll cut the butter in half and use coconut milk. Overall, very yummy soup and going to be a staple in our home.

SO SO YUMMY!

I have to say though, I have yet to fully try the whole recipe.  I made this when these when all I had was apples, carrots, potatoes, and chicken and was looking for a recipe that used them.  I added in the potato, thinly sliced, with the carrots and didn't add the rice or celery.  I didn't have the cream either.  It was so good that I've made that again instead of trying the actual recipe.  But the base for this is fantastic!  I LOVE the apples.  I think I'll add more next time.  They add such a unique flavor, a little surprise.  Wonderful.  Will be making this one for a LONG time.

I am just in the process of making the soup now, so far so good!  I did forget chicken broth at the store but it did not seem to matter; I just used water and a little extra salt and little garlic powder.  Also I used green curry, which is my favorite, and added chopped zucchini with the apples (a vegetable that I love to have with green curry).  This is a fantastic soup!

P.S. I cooked my rice separately just to be on the safe side.

This was good, but definitely needs some tweaks. Next time I would add garlic and potatoes, and more chicken and carrots. Maybe some lentils.

I cheated and used already cooked meat from a store-bought rotisserie chicken! :) I 86'd the heavy cream and the flour. Also, I used wild rice instead of white. All these changes turned this into a lovely, brothy, warming, healthful, wonderful bowl of soup. Yum!

This is 5 stars with a couple of "tweaks". I made it following the recipe as written and found it lacking a little in curry flavor. Then I doubled the curry and added a few red pepper flakes, yum!!!! Thanks for the post.

I just made this and ate a bowl. Very, very good. I doubled the recipe and glad of it. I forgot to add the cream at the end and didn't even miss it. I'll add it later, though. Differences: I roasted the chicken breast first with olive oil, salt & pepper, then cut it in bite sized pieces after it cooled... and I added three shakes of cayenne. Delicious.

This soup is fantastic!  I substitute the butter with 1-2 tbsp olive oil, leave out the cream, leave out the celery, and use 1/2 quinoa and 1/2 rice.  I cook the quinoa/rice beforehand and add it to the soup once it's nearly ready.  I've tried with and without the apple, and both versions are delicious!  I'm the only one in my house who enjoys this, so I make it to take with me for lunch.  It's the perfect lunchtime meal for a cold day.

This soup was amazing and a huge hit with my kids and husband.  Stayed true to the recipe except I followed another reviewer's advice and did a 50/50 combination of cream and coconut milk (I had some handy).  It was spectacular!!  Double or triple the recipe - you won't be sorry.

I made this recipe two days in a row for dinner! My fiance absolutely loved it! He is not a big fan of soup but this recipe convinced him to have it again the next day. I definitely added more curry powder, and used saltless chicken broth because it gave me a better idea of how much salt I want. The heavy cream at the end is a must in my opinion. It makes the soup more wholesome. Next time I am going to try it with some crusty bread or roti. I added cumin powder and instead of dried thyme I used fresh thyme. I added about a half a teaspoon of thyme when I poured the broth to the veggies.

This seems to be a tame mulligatawny, suitable for the curry averse.  I took the advice from other reviewer and tripled (!) the spice.  I knew one & one half teaspoons was no where near enough for me & my guests.  There seemed to be little broth so I opted out of the rice and added more chicken & apple.  Like some other reviewers, I recommend doubling the recipe & using coconut milk.  I'm glad I found this because until now I had no idea what mulligatawny was, how embarrassing.  Thanks Lise P!

Really Tasty!  I added a little more than it called for of carrots, rice, apple. (I omitted celery because I don't like it)  My whole family (three young children and husband!) loved it

This was such a huge hit with my kids (Chicken Soup with Rice!) that my 8-year-old actually prayed that night that we would have it for dinner again the next day. Absolute winner. Didn't change a thing.

I loved this soup, the only thing I change wasIi used fat free half and half instead of cream and it was awesome!  I gave some to my neighbor and she loved it too.The longer it sits the better it gets.  The next day it reminded me of Paneras chicken w/ wild rice!  So Yummy!!

Delicious! Added about 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper at the suggestion of reviewers, which made it pretty darn spicy! Will make again--perfect for the coldest day so far this fall.

Great recipe!! 
Next time I would definitely not add the apple. I added two tablespoons of curry powder instead and some extra chicken. and towards the end I used sour cream..best part of it all! Also, I squeezed some lemon once the soup was done and that really added to the taste!

Not that great. It wasn't terrible but I will not be making it again. All that butter just added extra fat. The flour did not seem to thicken it but added extra carbs. We tasted it with and w/o cream (half and half) but did not prefer the taste with cream, it just seemed to water down the taste. I had to put at least double the curry to give it a little flavor and omitted the thyme, as it didn't seem like it would work with the curry. Added cumin, smokey paprika and tumeric. Which seemed to help a lot.

This is SPECATACULAR after two days in the fridge however, it's not very good right after making it. Bland, actually. Also, the directions are very poorly written.

Really yummy and super easy!  I doubled everything except the butter - only used 5 Tbsp unsalted butter total - and more than doubled the chicken.  I also used 3 Tbsp curry and didn't add any salt or pepper (the chicken broth added enough salt and the curry was spicy enough).  Delicious!

VERY GOOD! No butter, only EVOO. More curry, 'cause we like it. Add red pepper flakes while simmering. Finish with fat free half and half and either Thai or Sweet Basil, chopped. OK, mine is 5 stars. As written is 3 or 4. Sorry. Should I have written a whole new recipe? I never know when I use something as inpsiration and make it completely my own.

yum. i think i may have added too much rice ( i try to use up as much leftovers as i can) so it turned up super thick... sounds strange but actually goes really well over mashed potatoes, almost like a gravy. (just mash the rice with a masher) and also i didnt use heavy cream.

Delicious!  Loved it!  Didn't have the cream so I used milk mixed with some dry milk to make it richer.  It worked great.  If I had been thinking, I would have used the coconut milk as another review had said.  We are definitely adding this to our family cookbook!!

This is good soup! I used frozen onion, bell pepper and celery mix. Added roughly chopped baby carrots, and peeled the apple. I didn't have chicken stock so I added 4 bullion cubes.  I also added the rice at the same time with the frozen veggies to save time. I already had left over chicken breast from the night before. From start to finish, it took approximately 25 minutes. Delish!!!!

This soup was AMAZING! I used maragam curry, which is almost sweeter, then added cayenne for the heat. It was so shocking how flavorful the soup was with just the fewest of ingredients! I would definately puree at least half the batch next time and if you are in the mood for a splurge, add the cream- it takes the soup to an entirely new level, but on all other non-splurge days of the week, you can still enjoy every bite without it. Next time I will ensure to double the batch so we can enjoy the leftovers. I would also add an additional cup of broth. If only I could be satisfied with that tiny soup bowl in the photo!! :) So, so good.

This was absolutely delicious! Substituted Quorn tenders (chicken-like meat substitute that is phenomenal) for chicken, used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.  Thank you for this recipe!!!

My family is a BIG fan of curry. I made as written....however I pureed the veggies after adding part of the broth. I have veggie haters in the family. I left out the cream but had planned on adding coconut milk. Served w/French bread. I made 12 servings but to serve 11 people. Had to scrimp at the end. Will triple next time. Family LOVED it.

I have made a lot of soups over the years and this one is the BEST soup that I have ever made.  Wow, I put a dallop of Major Grey Chutney on the top of each bowl of soup, served it with Trader Joes Naan bread and it was a huge hit!

I changed this very little--- absoutely yummy!!!!!!. I used 1 small sweet onion and a small fuji apple and probably about 5 cups of broth and then added a little water toward the end of the cooking time because it was a little to thick. My rice of choice was jasamine.  I also used about 6 or 7 chicken tenderloins.

Awesome soup!  Only change I made was subbing the dollop of fat free sour cream at the end in place of heavy cream.

Really delicious!  Used regular milk instead of cream and was still perfect.  Even better the next day!  Only thing that could make it better would be to serve with naan.

This was great. I echo many of the reviews here - double the recipe, this doesn't make a ton and you'll want leftovers. Chop the apple finely if you don't like big chunks. Mine didn't turn out soup-y at all though, more like a jambalaya. Not sure if it's supposed to be that thick or not. But, it was delicious.

Yummy!!  Dull Drizzly day and we needed something different--saw this and added some samosas along with naan for sides, my husband loved it!  All I had was some mexican creme used that topped with chopped mangoes. Better the next day

Wonderful. I wanted to eat the entire pot!  Minor changes: doubled curry, used coconut milk instead of heavy cream.  Next time, I would use two or three chicken breasts.  I have already e-mailed the recipe to friends and family. It's a keeper!

I was hoping the apple would give some nice sweetness to it, but unfortunately it pretty much just dissolved during cooking and didn't seem to add much of anything.  Next time I will add golden raisins instead.  Other than that, it was very good!

this soup is so amazing! its so yummmy! i changed just a few things though. i lightly grilled the chicken, i added 1 apple instead of just half, and i added red pepper flakes, and it needed a little more water, it was a little too thick i though. but it tasted just wonderful!!!! u need to try this! the apple just soaks up all the flavors around and then they just blend in. i was amazed. i am definatly making this again soon, my family LOVED it!***edit!*** I just wanted to mention, we really LOVE this soup, i have made it many times, and some reveiws say they ommitted almost everything in the recipe that makes it good. it is very healthy, and is so good for you. the only thing i do is use milk instead of cream, that cuts tons of calories without taking away any flavor. and there isn't really anything unhealthy in this soup, so try it the way the recipe says! its so yummy!!

Very tasty, added garlic and half and half instead of cream. Also switched out butter for olive oil, trying to keep it a bit healthier.

This was fantastic!  We all loved this soup to the point of eating the entire thing in one sitting.  Even my 8 month old had two bowls of it.  The only change we really made was using leftover rice and allspice/cumin in stead of curry (I thought we had some, but we didn't.  whoops).  I strongly suggest trying this recipe.  It was phenomenal!

This is the original recipe from the Joy of Cooking!  Always been a great favorite in our family.  Instead of cooked rice, I add 2-3T of uncooked rice just after adding the chicken broth.  Ends up with just the right amount of rice! I often omit the cream and add a squeeze of fresh lemon to each bowl.

absolutely perfect!  i don't know why anyone would balk at the texture of the soft apples... varying the textures in a meal is what adds interest to it and they are definitely not slimy.  i agree that you could cut out alot of the fat in this recipe and it would still be incredible.

This was fantastic, I omitted the cream and used milk instead, to make it lighter, and it was still very rich tasting. I also used a little bit more curry powder. My family loved it.

Out of this world delish!  Quite possibly the best soup I have ever made.  Looks and tastes amazing and it was easy to make=)  I did have to add more chicken broth as the rice seemed to absorb a lot of it.  And I used about 2 tablespoons of curry for a more intense flavour.  I sure wish I made a double batch!

I never thought apple, onion, chicken & milk could be combined to equal something tasty! I used onions that I had diced in my food processor otherwise the diced ones would have been too big in the soup at the end. Shredded carrot better than diced ones. Omitted the flour. Used all of the curry spice (any less would have had no flavor). I left the skin on half of the red apple that I used. Omitted the white rice (used Orzo pasta instead), used full milk instead of heavy cream, and one(or two) chicken bouillon cubes with 4 cups of water instead of chicken broth.I sauteed the chicken in butter 1st, then took out, sauteed the carrots, onions, & celery a little then added water & chicken cube then followed the recipe as written. Oh btw, make sure you heat the milk in the microwave before adding it to the pot. Edited 9-9-09: have since tried it with rice, i like it with orzo more. Also, I make it with canned chicken broth & have found it tasty.

Love it! This is my 2nd time making soup and I find this really easy and fun to do. I'm also on a diet and I followed MSBLUERASP's review and it was superb! I did as she/he said except that I've used garbanzo bean (aka chickpeas) instead of potatoes and omitted the sour cream. I've also added 2 large button mushroom(diced) into the soup and added 1 beaten egg and stir it lightly.(It looks a lil like egg drop soup though)Anyway,I added the egg just to hike up more protein in my diet.

Anyway,good recipe! Will make again ;)

My husband loves mulligatawny soup and Indian food. He was skeptical that this recipe would taste like what he was accustomed to having at his favorite Indian restaurants. Due to his pickiness we ommitted the celery, carrot, and apple from the recipe. He was surprised that this recipe called for chicken. In the end, he loved the soup and is asking that I make it regularily. Next time I will double the recipe as it only made about 3-4 servings rather than the 6 that it suggested. I would also add either a little water or additional chicken broth to liquidfy it a little more. It was pretty thick...but delicious!

Amazing! Definitely wouldn't serve 6 as written--especially not when it's this good! I doubled the curry and put in a bit more rice as suggested by other reviewers and I'm glad I did both. I think I'll put double the chicken in next time, too.

My husband made this soup while I was at the gym and it was such a pleasant surprise to open the door to the house and have the aroma greet me.  This yielded only two good bowls full for us, surprisingly.  We always enjoy leftovers for lunch the next day, but no such luck this time.  We left out the heavy cream on accident, but enjoyed it immensely anyway.  We will definitely make this again.  He said it was super easy.

This is easily my favorite soup ever.  I used to order this at a local restaurant but this recipe puts it to shame.  My 15 y.o. daughter gave it a 9 out of 10 and my 7 y.o. son gave it "infinity."  I give it a 5 out of 5 on this site's scale.

I doubled the recipe for leftovers and added a little more curry for my personal taste.  I also substituted Texmati brown rice because that's what I had in the pantry.

I can't wait to make this again.

If I could give this soup 10 stars I would.  This is the best recipe yet that I have tried on this site.  I LOVED everything about it!  I used a rotisery chicken from the night before for the meat and added 1/4 cup extra rice but I think that it didn't need it.  I also was out of thyme but the flavor was restaurant quality.  I am so proud of how it came out...Thank you!

Very good and easy to make.  It's comfort food, and reminds me of chicken soup with an Indian twist.

Very good soup recipe! I only made a few changes. I used brown rice instead of white and added it with the broth. I omitted the cream and used 2 T butter instead of 4. Also I used the whole apple instead of just half. Oh, and I felt like this served 4 at the most, definitely not 6.

Full of flavor!! I substituted Quorn "chicken" to make it vegatarian and it turned out great. I also added fresh garlic. I would highly recommend this recipe.

Delicious!  My husband ate four bowls.  I made a couple adjustments.  I cooked the rice separate.  I put the basmati rice in the bottom of individual bowls, poured the soup over it (I added cayenne and extra curry), and then drizzled coconut milk instead of cream over the top.  Soooooo yummy!  Keeping the rice separate kept it from getting soggy.  It makes great leftovers.

OMG! This recipe is awesome! I do not add the heavy cream and I do add more curry. I've made it twice and doubled it the first time and fourx the second time I made it. And now I'm about to go make it again, as I'm craving it, lol. It's better the next day too!

I've been searching for a new way to use curry, and this was perfect!  My husband, who is not a fan of soups or vegetables, actually scraped his bowl clean!  Because we prefer stews to soups, I doubled the veggies and the meat, but kept the amount of liquid and spices the same.  I added 1/2 cup of golden raisins as another reviewer suggested, an extra tablespoon of flour, and omitted the cream.  We don't eat dairy, and while I'd thought to sub almond milk instead, it didn't need it!  I'm allergic to apples, so the only other change was to use bartlett pears instead, and they were awesome--even better than I think the apples would have been.  People rant frequently on this site about giving something 5 stars after altering the basic recipe, but I suspect that this would still be amazing as-is.  Thank you so much for the new addition to our recipe rotation!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe and so do my husband and two young children. I do make some adjustments. Instead of 1 Tbsp. of curry I use 1 1/2 of curry and 1 1/2 of Garam Masala for extra kick. Not too spicy - just right. I also bump up the amount of rice to 3/4 cup. And instead of the heavy cream I use a can of coconut milk (I use the whole can, but that is for my doubled recipe). I make this recipe doubled (so you'd use 3 Tbsp of curry and 3 of Garam Masala for the doubled recipe) since my family loves it so much and it tastes even better as leftovers. The onions, celery, carrots, butter, flour, curry and garam masala all cooking in the pot together is a smell that is out of this world! I serve it with a fresh cut loaf of crusty sourdough bread. Delish!

I have eaten this since I was a little girl.  One of my favorite recipes.  I add my cooked rice at the end....in the bowl.  That way leftovers will still have that soup quality.  Otherwise it turns to mush....and I don't use any cream.  I don't think it is needed....less fat that way too!!

This is incredible! After a bowl of this soup, I feel so relaxed and at peace with the world. The only changes that I made were to omit the cream (it's rich enough without is since there's a good quantity of butter), and I used basmati rice. I will definitely double or triple the recipe next time and freeze it so that I can have it on hand.

This is one of the most amazing tasting soups I have ever had!  I have never been fond of yellow curry, but since my husband and son enjoy it, I decided to give this recipe a try.  Since I did not have quite enough yellow curry powder, I  added red curry powder as well.  Everyone wanted seconds and even thirds!  The next day, one of my daughter-in-laws and one of my grandkids - who is a very picky eater - stopped by and my granddaughter loved it.  She wanted her mom to get the recipe.  This is quickly becoming a family favorite!

Very easy; very good.  I didn't have cream, so substituted milk, which worked just fine and mellowed it out nicely.  It's a hard soup not to love.

This soup is great!  I used some of the other reviewer's suggestions and doubled the recipe and adjusted the curry to my taste.  I also added raisins and kept the apples kind of chunky.  It turned out great.  Very flavorful!

I'm happy to report that my daughter said, "This is kinda good," and my son, when asked how he liked it, responded, "It's fine." That's almost praise from the two of them. I pureed the vegetables after sauteing them, along with the apple (I knew my kids would NOT go for chunks of apple in their "chicken" soup.) I liked it that way because the broth was nice and thick. I probably would have added a bit more curry if I wasn't serving it to my two picky palette kids. Anyway, it was a nice change from the normal chicken and rice soup and quite healthy with all those veggies. I used a small can of evaporated milk instead of cream. Good stuff!

I doubled the recipe (I made it for 12) and I added 1 TSP of curry mix, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, 2 cardamon peeled and groud and 1/2 tsp of fresh grated ginger. It was a great recipe to begin with, but my additions just gave it a little more depth. I am not sure I need the full amount of butter - next time I will try it with half of the butter. Also, I have had it without the cream. And I think I will leave that as an option for my guests when I serve it, as it will definitely mute the flavor.

Very good soup. It was easy to make while I did laundry because although it takes an hour to make at least half of that is simmering time. I didn't serve it with cream because I didn't have any but I will definately make it again.  The only change I made was to double the curry powder added. Yummy!!

Definately a keeping in my recipe files! My finace just swooned over this soup, and he's normally not a soup guy at all! The only change I made was by adding fat-free sour cream instead of the heavy cream listed in the recipe, but it still turned out fab.
Kudos to a great find!!

This soup was GREAT! I wish i would've made more! I didn't have any cream or half and half so i actually used about half a can or 3/4 cup of evaporated milk. I thought it added a nice flavor.   For extra seasonings i added about 1/2 tsp of celery salt and 1 tsp of seasoned salt. Don't add it if you already think its a bit salty. I also read a review and added a shake or 2 of  ground Cheyenne pepper. It was PERFECT!!! I will make it again for sure!!

I you like curry you should like this soup. It's basically chicken w/rice plus apples & curry. Pick the curry of your choice to determine how spicy it will be.

After watching the Seinfeld episode with the soup nazi "No soup for you!", I wanted to make Mulligatawny having never tasted it.  Wow, my whole family loved it.  It is definitely a change from the ordinary and will make it over and over again.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Oh, my!  We JUST finished having this.  AMAZING!  PERFECT!  Definitely an EXCELLENT recipe.  I absolutely LOVE the Mulligatawny served at a local restaurant and never thought I could make one as good.  Well, heck, now I've made one better.  Pretty much stuck to the recipe although was liberal with veggies, chicken and used brown instead of white rice.  For the chicken we cut it up first (raw), cooked it and threw it in the recipe when it called for it.  Heated the cream late in the process and just poured a tiny bit into each bowl, stirred and served.  Excellent!  Really, really, excellent.  Will definitely make MANY more times.  Thanks!

Thumbs up from our house!  As a note, the recipe didn't indicate whether to use cooked or raw chicken.  I chose to shred up TWO cooked chicken breasts and it was perfect.  Next time, may add some more rice because my SO wanted it to be a bit more hearty but, overall, the recipe was great.  Thanks!

I absolutely love this soup! It's my new favorite comfort food. I usually bring some for lunch and my colleagues always ask for the recipe.I direct them to All Recipes site and credit Lise P. I add just a little more curry and a large clove of diced garlic along with the carrots, onions and celery - although it's just about perfect the way it is. Thanks!

This was a very delicious soup, however, I was serving this as a meal for my husband and I and I found that it barely fed two when it says it would serve six.  I will definately make this soup again, however I will double the recipe next time. :0)

Wonderful recipe! Very easy (especially with a food processor for the chopping) and very, very tasty. I was almost afraid to put the cream in at the end because it already tasted so good!

I made only tiny changes: added 1/3 cup diced sweet peppers, used 2 T. each butter and olive oil instead of just butter, and used evaporated milk instead of cream.

This was delicious.

Very good the first day and was still great 3 days later. I boiled the leftovers of a rotisserie chicken, bones and and thigh meat, to make the broth. After straining it, I chopped the meat and discarded the bones.  As per suggestion, I grated my apple. I added shredded cabbage to the recipe’s vegetables. I spiced it with about 1 tablespoon of hot Madras curry. I used half and half and added it to the soup. I added lime juice and sour cream before serving. This was a tasty way to use up the rotisserie chicken that I will do again.

Just amazing! Can't say enough about this wonderful soup. My wife can not have gluten so here's what we did:

Do not put any flour in, instead wait until about five minutes before serving and add corn starch–not quite the same texture, but it worked like a charm.

such amazing flavor! 100% hands down recommend you try this recipe at least once. I loved it, my wife loved the taste but has a weird issue with creamy textures. I was too busy enjoying the dish and cutting in line for seconds to pay much attention. I made this recipe with olive oil instead of butter and 2 tsp of curry but followed the recipe beyond that.

Made this for my wife and daughter and they loved it. Cooked the chicken first and shredded it. Also, as other had mentioned I only used a small amount of half and half and it was fine. Next time I think I will try with coconut milk.

I used half n half instead of cream. Upped the curry to 2 teaspoons and used 1/2 a Granny Smith apple leaving the peel on.    I do not use rice but am planning on next time  trying one of the veggie rice's.  This tastes good the first day but GREAT the next.   I have made it several times and it's a great low calorie meal.  I think I have made it 3 times in the past month.

I don’t think I’ve ever given a recipe 5 stars. But this soup hands down deserves it!!! AMAZING. I didn’t add the flour or the heavy cream, and cut butter to half (by accident) to lower cals and carbs. Everything else I did spot on in the recipe. Even my picky eater kids loved this. Next time I’ll lower the amount of rice too because it’s just not needed, but OMG. Try this ASAP. YUM

Excellent recipe. Very mild spiciness from curry. Doubling the chicken and rice amounts give a very thick stew like consistency. Can cut back a tad on the flour and cream. I used 1/2 and 1/2 and whole milk and tasted great.

I didn't a lot of butter. I used olive oil and just 2 T of butter. I also didn't add the cream, it doesnt need it. The only other change I made was to add a bit of cayenne pepper at the very end to up the heat just a bit. This is definitely going to become a new staple for me, it's amazing!

This is my new favorite soup.
Sooooooooo good.
 I made it with coconut milk instead of  cream.
Love it love it.
   Thanks for the recipe.

PS put the can of coconut  milk in the fridge ( I always keep one can in ftidge) Don't  shake it when opening, then just spoon off  the cream that has floated to top and add to soup .Delicious.

I've never had mulligatawny soup before so wasn't totally sure what to expect. Here's basically what it was like: curry soup. Yep! Very comforting and delicious. 

I never would have thought about apples in a curry like this but it was good! I used 1 1/2 boneless skinless chicken thighs (it's what I had and I prefer it to breast) chopped up. I added the cream right to the soup. Instead of uncooked rice, I added a bit of cooked leftover rice. I used Madras curry powder which is a little spicy and added some cayenne for good measure. This was really good. I might try shredding the apple next time to get it more blended throughout, though biting into the sweetness was a nice contrast to the richness of the soup.

I made this for My mother in-law's annual soup and chowder party.
It was a HUGE hit. It was gone by the end of the night and I was literally BEGGED for the recipe for about a week.
I doubled the batch and added about 1/2 table spoon more curry.
I will absolutely make this soup again!

I won't make it again.  Didn't care for it at all.  It's chicken and rice soup with some curry powder thrown in and the curry powder gave it kind of a processed taste.  Celery and carrots just don't go with curry flavor.

This soup is incredible!!!! The only thing I did differently  was use two carrots and another chicken breast. I also doubled the curry as suggested. WOW, the flavors are amazing.  We gobbled it up the very first night.  Even my 2 year old loved it.   Next time we will be doubling the recipe. Thanks!!

This soup is wonderful!  Never tasted it before.  Couldn't wait to make it.  Used two 10 oz. cans of chicken (one breast, one white/dark meat because that's what I had.  One can probably would have been enough.  Added an extra cup of broth because I had an open can that needed to  be used up; and 1 minced garlic clove.  Used 1 large apple, shredded.  Added a pinch of cayenne to finish.  Used 1/3 c. leftover coconut milk topped with cream to make 1/2 c. for the cream.  This soup was great with or without the cream.  The hint of coconut from the cream was heavenly!  Think I'll use 2 tsp. of curry next time like others suggested.  Can't wait to have my brother over to make this for him.  He loves curry.  It'a practically a stew.  Update:  Even better with 2 tsp. of curry powder.  Added roasted chicken during last 5 minutes.  Was a little more generous with the thyme and cayenne this time.  Used seasoned salt for the salt.  Delicious!  Update:  Increased chicken broth to 8 cups and flour to 2 Tbs. and added a yellow squash, tomato, and a tsp. of ginger.  Wonderful!  Don't even bother with the cream anymore; doesn't need it.

I have been making this soup for about 2-3 years and it gets better each time.  Over time I have made some adjustments based on the comments as well as my own experience. I agree that the curry should be doubled, unless you double the recipe.  In that case I would use 1 1/2 TBS of curry instead of 2 TBS.  I also add 1/2 tsp of garam masala. I prefer to use either granny smith or honey crisp apples (unpeeled) and I have found that coconut milk instead of heavy cream is superior (although the heavy cream is delicious as well).  This soup is a hit every time I make it. My co-workers are always jealous when I bring it in which means that I normally end up bringing some for everyone. I always double the recipe. One pot full is never quite enough.  Enjoy!

We wanted to love this soup, but we found it "okay".  After reading the ingredients, all of which we love, I thought that the soup would be outstanding, so I made it exactly as written. After an initial taste, I did change the texture a bit by removing and pureeing one cup of the soup, and then returning that cup to the soup.  This thickened it a bit more, without making it a completely pureed soup, but of course, it didn't impact the taste. If I make this again, the taste of the "as written" recipe leads me to follow the following suggestions, many of which were offered by previous reviewers : Add a whole Granny Smith apple and grate it; add 1 cup of sweet onion to a half cup of celery and 1/2 cup of carrot; omit the flour; increase the curry powder to one tablespoon;  and reduce the butter and cream. I might even add one small potato and then blend that potato with a bit of the broth to add thickness near the end of cooking. (I may have just talked myself into making this again!)

Me and my family love to eat and I love to cook.  For our anniversary my parents sent us on a food tour.  The first restaurant we stopped at served us this.  When we put the spoon to our mouths I knew I had to find the recipe for this and add it to our meal plan.  I have never not found a good recipe on here so I decided to try it.  I changed the recipe a little I added 2 carrots and 1/3 cup basmati rice instead of white. I also used half and half instead of heavy cream.  I also squeezed  a quarter of a lemon into my personal bowl of soup.  My husband said it was better then the restaurant and I completely agree.  Our 3 year old devoured it and asked for seconds of the soup that made her tummy party.

The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because of the choice of ingredients  - All purpose flour...Really I like Mulligatawny II . I am Indian and traditional mulligatawny must have lentils.  But this doesn't have lentils at all.

Made this as written. It does not specify what type of curry and all I had on hand was red curry. My suggestion would be to include the type of curry since it obviously matters. The color it turned the chicken was a disgusting pink and the broth was  also a unappetizing color and not thickened enough.  I'm guessing a yellow curry would have been better. The flavour was just ok but will not make this again.

This soup came out fantastic! I'm not big on measuring when cooking so I used the same ingredients but my own judgement of amounts. I know I used more curry and thyme then called for. I served this with a scoop of rice on the side and flat bread. Even my 9 year old ate her whole bowl. Thanks for this recipe, it's a keeper!

My husband loves this recipe. I double it, use rotisserie chicken, double the curry and use a can of coconut milk instead of cream. I add the coconut milk when I add the rice and chicken so the flavours all blend for longer.

This recipe is exactly what nearly everyone states, it's GREAT and it's also G.F if you use cornstarch as a replacement for the flour!     Go ahead and double it, (I used the amount of curry called for in the single batch..others are welcome to more if it fits their tastes.) 
I made several changes, but most were due to ingredients I had on hand, also I did not add the cream at end either.  To a doubled batch I additionally used 3 c. clamato juice, 6 cloves garlic, peeled and minced, 1/2 t. turmeric, 4 carrots (instead of 2), 2 T. minced fresh parsley. I used vegetable bouillon in place of chicken broth.  I did cook rice separately according to pkg. directions, before I started the soup, added rice in when soup had finished (this saves the texture of the rice).  My cooking time was a lot less, soup was ready to eat in 45 min.  Thank You from Foodie Forever for a delicious winter soup!!

Soo good . I doubled the broth to make it more soupy as we've had colds and sore throat issues. Will definitely be making again thank you!

I made this more paleo/bulletproof friendly by not adding flour or rice or cow's milk. Instead I substituted with 2 medium diced sweet potatoes and 1 cup of full fat coconut milk. I doubled the recipe and used 2 Tbs of curry powder as well.  It's amazing and tastes somewhat thai and indian at the same time!

This is one of my most favorite, go-to soups. I usually use a little less butter and a little more chicken, and when I have the time, I like to make the chicken broth from scratch, but it is delightful just as the recipe is. I love making quadruple batches and having plenty of leftovers. I frequently make this soup for company and I have yet to find someone who doesn't like it.

Nice recipe, I added more curry powder, seasoned the chicken with it and added garam masala to the seasonings as well. Also, added a can of coconut milk or cream, not cream of coconut! Yum!

We LOVE this soup, with a few variations. I read the reviews and drew on my own cooking experience and made a couple of alterations to vamp up the flavor.  First of all, although the recipe just says "white rice", I use basmati. In my opinion, it's one of the best, and it suits the recipe. I used a little more curry than called for,  added garam masala (new ingredient for me, but oh my, it's a new favorite). I also add more chicken broth and a bit of chicken base (or bullion) to have more of the soup.  Sorry for no specifics on additions, I just taste and add more if needed. Oh yeah, cut the apples up small small, but DONT leave em out.  Serve with fresh warm naan. One more thing, you might want to double this recipe at least. It makes a small batch as is.

I am a chef at an upscale grocery store. I prepare a "from scratch" soup every day that is featured on our soup bar. I made this soup today with a minor adjustment. I added freshly ground ginger, 1 can of "lite" coconut milk, and 1 can coconut milk.  Tomorrow, I will add the heavy cream.  This soup is a bit spicy (not sure if it was the curry I used in combination with the fresh ginger).  Having said that, the flavor profile was fantastic and I can't wait to taste it in the morning(I always make my featured soup a day in advance so that the flavors have a chance to marry and develop).

This was awesome!! I made a couple little changes and kinda turned it into a stew. But I stayed with all the same flavors. I cooked the chicken but not through, after coating it with a flour mixture that had garlic powder, poultry seasoning and a dash of curry powder in it. The flour from the dusting thickened the soup, as well. I read of review that said this soup gets better with time... I wish I had thought ahead and doubled the recipe!! That's a great idea, I second the suggestion strongly!! My daughter absolutely loved it, as well and she's not a big fan of heat or spices. It really is a lovely soup or stew, depending on how you make it. Either way it's definitely a winner!!

First time trying mulligatawny and it was a huge success - rave reviews from all I shared with.  I did add some additional curry powder and a garlic clove after reading some of the reviews, but followed the rest as published.  Next time I would consider throwing in some cayenne for heat, but it was a 5 star recipe without.  Thanks for sharing!

I love how flexible this recipe is with measurements and other ingredients. I make it mostly as is but omit the apple (hubby doesn't care for the texture) and I used the following instead:
2 carrots 
3 stalks of celery
3 rounded teaspoons of hot curry paste
1/2-1 can of coconut cream (instead of heavy cream)

You could probably get away with coconut oil instead of butter as well.

Edit 04/18: I made it as I always do but I had run out of curry paste, so I used 2 tablespoons of butter chicken curry powder by Shan. I also forgot the cream, which made it very spicy but incredibly tasty.

I found this better than I expected. I too made some changes out of necessity on what I had at the time or because I didn't want to waste something. I used 1 cup each of carrots, celery and onions. I had a leek getting old so I used about a third of that. I doubled the curry out of suggestions from the other reviewers. I used one whole granny smith apple. To my surprise I like the small chunks of apple in this recipe and wished I had more apple in there. Pleasantly surprised by this recipe. My chicken was dark meat because that is what I had. Its good without the cream, but I liked it with cream even better.  Its a keeper and if I had a restaurant this one would be on the menu or on the soup bar.

Absolutely delicious.  As others have already posted, you can easily double the spice and use an entire apple. You can also use an immersion blender after step 1 and reduce the cream for a healthier soup.

This is a very flavorful soup, good for when you want something a little different but still comforting. You need to use really good quality curry powder. If your grocery store has an Indian food section, get it there rather than in the regular spice aisle.

Love this soup! I'm just sitting down with my second bowlful :)  The only addition/change I did was to add one sweet potato in chunks. I'm so very warmed up by this soup! EXCELLENT!

Definitely double! I'm with the others, this is a delicious soup. You could always throw in some extra celery, carrots and onion. I did add a large garlic clove. I also had a couple containers of coconut water as part of the liquid needed.  I will definitely add more rice next time. Forgot to take the chicken out of the freezer and it was still yummy delicious!

10 stars! I think this is the best soup I have ever made! Easy, fairly quick and fabulous! I sent my sister the recipe and she got the same rave reviews from her family! I doubled the curry and it was still not a strong flavor so it appealed to everyone.I used half-n-half to lower the calories a little...might try it without any cream or just use milk. WONDERFUL!

I added a cup of coconut milk and used a T of curry powder.  I let it simmer in the crockpot on low for about 5 hours.  It was delicious, but the rice didn't cook all the way.  (I don't usually cook with rice, so I don't know whether that's something obvious I should have anticipated!) I will probably use more carrots (even though I used extra this time) and add some chopped red pepper next time, but I thought it was really yummy!

This was great! My two-year old gobbled it up. I skipped the cream and the apple, for sake of time. Homemade chicken broth really does the trick, too! It said 6 servings, but my 3 kids and I barely had enough. Next time I'll add more broth. Very delicious, though!

This soup is out of this world tasty - I make it often and always as a double batch so some can be kept in the freezer.  I always add a Sweet Potato - it melts in and makes for a nice hearty soup.  I have never added cream and have not missed it.  Enjoy!

My family loves this soup! I usually double or triple the recipe and freeze individual servings for lunch. Instead of the 11/2 tsp of curry powder I increase to 1 tbs for just a little spice. I have also experiment alot with this recipe and use coconut oil instead of butter and coconut milk in place of cream. Delicious!

My husband and daughters (7 and 9) absolutely LOVE this soup and it's part of our regular meal rotation. I nearly double the curry powder; use half and half (to cut the fat) and meat from a rotisserie chicken (for faster meal prep); cook basmati rice (personal preference) separately and add it when I add chicken; and have never needed to add salt. Try this recipe - it is amazing!

We all loved this soup!  I agreed with everyone that said to add more curry.  I used curry paste instead of powder and pureed the celery, onions and carrots to make a smoother soup (picky kids). I served it with a loaf French bread and it was a good, filling supper.  I will make this again for sure.  Only problem was there were no left-overs for lunch the next day!

The only time I made this as written was the first time.  We all adore this soup.  I grate the carrots and dice the apples.  I like the crunch of the apple.  Also, use crisp apples like Cripps Pink or even Granny Smith as they hold the crispness.  If you prefer them to blend in, buy another type and grate them as another reviewer mentioned.  I also at least double the Curry powder and will add a little more Turmeric and Cumin to boot.  As another reader said, it does get better after a day or two.  I have also frozen this soup with fine results.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I would not have tried it if not for the unusual name.

This soup is absolutely delicious!  My husband raved about it and he sort of likes everything but rarely loves anything and this one did it!  Based on other reviews I did increase the amount of curry and tossed in a little bit of cayenne.  I had to increase the broth towards the end b/c it  had boiled away a fair bit and was a little thicker than we like.  I omitted the cream b/c it was great w/o it and I wanted to reduce fat.  I also used half butter and half olive oil.  I added the raw chicken right after the celery and carrots to cook it slightly before adding the broth.  This gave the chicken a nice flavour.  I also grated the apple and used almost a whole one (granny smith) rather than putting in chunks on advice of another reviewer.  Thanks for a great recipe. We'll make this over and over again.

I printed this for my husband to make using our leftover turkey and turkey broth. He is not a cook by nature, but he had no problem with this. We doubled it and used brown rice instead of white. We also did not add the heavy cream. Delicious!

I doubled recipe added 8 oz pkg of sliced mushrooms and 1 potatoe used 2 tsp of flour and added 1 more tsp of curry powder.  I also pureed the apples and next time may use some coconut milk.  I added the rice to bowls before serving and grated some fresh ginger for personal taste.

Incredible! To shorten the cook time, I put the chicken in after I add the stock and bring it all to a boil...then simmer.  I always have leftover rice, so I use that instead of the uncooked.  I wait about 10 minutes, then add the rice and apples.  Haven't tried it with the hot cream, but it is delicious just as it is or blended for a lucious creamy soup!

Fantastic recipe! I made it without the apple (since I didn't have one on hand) and doubled the amount of chicken.

Delicious!  My husband had 3 servings of this soup.  My kids love it too.  I grated the apple and chopped all vegetables very small.  I add the cream to each bowl when serving.  I used Basmati rice and I tell you, it gives it such a lovely taste.  Thank you for a wonderful soup recipe.

This is a fabulous soup!  We all wished we had room for more. I had had a Mulligatawny stew/soup in a restaurant, and though that was good, this recipe surpassed the restaurant soup by far. I'm not fond of curry powder, and used red curry paste (to taste - about 1 tsp.) instead. I did substitute some cooked brown rice for the white rice, since I had some on hand.  It was easy and relatively quick.  This is certainly a step up from ordinary chicken soup! Don't be afraid of the apple; it suits the flavors perfectly.  I used a Pink Lady apple.  I'll make this again and again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Great soup!  Followed the recipe almost exactly.  Used only about 1-2 tbsp of butter to saute the veggies.  Also added corn cut raw from the cob.  Used Granny Smith apple which held its structure nicely --not mushy.  Cut the chicken in cubes and blanched in chicken broth before adding to the soup.  Added a splash of whole milk to each bowl before serving.  Will definitely make again!

I followed the recipe exactly how it was written, except that I forgot to add the cream when it was time to serve! It was delicious without it, though, so I can't wait to try with it. The only thing that didn't work out to my taste was that the soup was thicker than I expected, there wasn't enough broth to my taste. That being said, maybe adding the cream helps a bit, I don't know. But I will definitely remake this soup in the near future, and try doubling the quantity of broth.

Excellent.  The curry I used was not overpowering at all.  I added it in thirds just to make sure but I had no issues with the soup being too spicy.  It had a very nice creamy flavor even though I did not add the cream.  I also added 2 cubed potatoes.

Phenomenal, have been making this soup for years, rate this right up there with Peasants Soup…homemade soup is the way to go, only homemade. Mulligatawny Soup is a burst of flavor on your palette. 5 stars

Delicious! I pretty much followed the recipe except I used more chicken stock (used a 49 oz can). I added a little more curry powder because of that, and I added a bit of basil to it to sweeten it up a bit. I used 2% milk instead of cream. It was so good. I eat this soup at a local restaurant regularly and this was just as good. Yum!

This soup is so delicious and easy to make.  This is now one of my top 5 soup recipes (we like soup).  I cut the butter in half and didn't use quite all of the cream because we're watching our calories, but I don't think it affects the flavor at all.  The kids like it, too.

This is the best soup I've ever made!  So satisfying.  A real comfort food.  I made it exactly as written....but chilled it overnight and removed the cold butter that had floated to the top.  Absolutely delicious!

Very tasty. To make this vegetarian, grate a fresh tomato into it to give some flavor and use water instead of chicken broth, and just leave the chicken out.

I made this soup (minus the chicken pieces) for a soup night with the neighbors and they all loved it! It has a very well-rounded flavor but is not overpowering. Next time I will use the more yellow type of curry. I purchased mine from the indian market but it was not as yellow as I was accustomed to...I don't know if that is significant or not. You will not be disappointed with this soup. I added a little sugar to the soup...maybe 2 teaspoons...maybe a little less. I feel that this brought out the curry and apples, Yum!

I used extra virgin coconut oil to saute the veggies in and sprinkeld curry as I went. Also, presauteed my chicken cubes in a seperate small skillet with coconut oil and curry. I really like coconut and curry together so I upped the curry in the flour /curry mix and added some as I went, here also, I added 1 small dash of cayenne pepper.  After the 1/2 hr broth boil(didn't have broth, so I used 4 seasoned bouilllon cubes and 4C water because of this, I Omitted the salt, pepper and thyme), I threw in a handfull of unsweetened coconut flakes and the other called for ingredients for this point.
This really does get better the longer it simmers. Just make sure to keep stirring from the bottom, as the flour will continue to thicken the soup. The curry really kicks in as it cooks. 
I mixed unsweetened coconut milk with half and half for the cream mix-in and it really added a nice final touch.
Very very good recipe as is. You don't really have to do anything to the orig recipe, I just always add my own touches.

Substituted fennel for celery & shrimp for chicken. Also added an extra 1/2 tsp curry powder & 1/2 tsp red cayenne pepper. Next time, I'll add pre-cooked rice to soup.

I made this last night and we were just in awe of this soup!!!  The only things I did different were, because I was using frozen chicken, I sauteed my veggies and added the flour, etc., took that out and put aside.  Then I put in my chicken into the chicken broth and boiled until done...added the veggies back in.  I forgot the pepper too.  It was still 5 stars!  Next time I'm 4x ing the recipe and freezing 1/2 if they don't eat it all.  :)

I didn't have chicken so I used veggie "Chicken".  My daughter came home and said it tasted a little blah.  She added garlic powder, more curry, cayenne pepper, and a little cinnamon.  It did taste better.  Next time I will add more vegetables.

Doubled this for a family of 5 (had lunch for 3 the next day) and used 1/2 cup of 1/2 & 1/2 at the end. Also, used a pound of chicken and more rice. Delicious!

I have made this before and it is a great recipe! I work for the Nantahala Outdoor Center and this is actually in the Original Nantahala Outdoor Center Cook Book from the late 1970s!

This soup was excellent! I upped the curry to 2 tsp as suggested, used half-and-half instead of straight cream, and because I had leftover cooked wild/brown rice mix, I went ahead and used that (about 1 1/4 cups). I might add more rice next time, as some in the family thought it a little thin, but other than that they all loved it! It went great with homemade Naan. Will DEFINITELY make again.

My friend served me this soup at her house in MI, and it melted in my mouth!  I couldn't wait to get back to TX and make it for my own family!  We love soups, but I had been looking for something new.  This soup is so unique and different! My only suggestion is to triple the recipe... This recipe as is will not actually feed six.  For my family of seven, I triple it!  Add a salad and some bread, and you have the perfect comfort meal!

Trying a new soup each week for 2012 might be difficult, but with recipes like this I am really looking forward to try new soups!  I changed this up a bit as the original taste did not have enough flavor to my liking.  I did not add the chicken, I doubled the curry and the rice.  After letting it set over night, it was even better the next day for lunch.  I finely cut the apple to help eliminate the chunks and I also added extra veggies.  This is one of the better soups I have ever tried.  I also added some red pepper flakes like someone else suggested to add some heat.  Not sure if soup 3 of 2012 can beat this one....

Absolutely love this recipe!!  It's easy to make and extremely delicious!  It tastes even better the next day!  The only change I have made was an increase in the curry powder (upped the amount to 2 tbsp) just because I love curry.  I read the reviews and might try the coconut milk substitution next time.

Very good.  I doubled the rice, increased the curry to 2 tsp, added some cayenne pepper, and only used 1/4 cup of cream.  Turned out well.  Use a granny smith apple too!  It gives it a nice accent, but is far from overwhelming.

Kids liked it. I didn't like how the pieces of Apple floated on top so I picked them and zapped them in the processor without killing them :) I usually don't make a lot of changes to the recipes like others do, but I tasted it before adding cream and then I added a cup of whole milk instead of the cream to cut down on the fat, which usually works fine in other recipes, and in my opinion it tasted better and more balanced without the milk, so I will try it without next time.

Decent soup but not my fave. Could be better with some work though. I doubled the batch but it could have used more rice and chicken. Didn't have carrots but added potatoes which were good with the soup. Added a little quinoa which gave it a great little crunch. Added more curry, some garam masala, cumin and a little cardamom. The apples didn't do it for me. I usually love incorporating fruit/sweet with savory foods but maybe applesauce would have been better? Adding the cream made a huge difference though so I recommend adding it!

Delicious, thank you. I made the following changes based on preference and ingredient availability: no celery, carrot, or thyme; subbed brown rice pilaf for white rice; blended the apple, onion, and broth; cooked the chicken in a crock pot; and added corn and the flour at the end. I loved this and will definitely make this again!

I made this with fresh local organic veggies and chicken that was still walking around the farm earlier this week.  I thought it was really good, such a nice fall and winter soup.  However, my husband and sons were not big fans.  They ate the chicken but nothing else.  I followed the recipe pretty closely except substituted brown rice for the white rice (I added it at the same time as the broth so it would have time to cook) and used my immersion blender to blend everything else together before adding the chicken at the very end.  I was tempted to add a can of coconut milk, but I wanted to try it as written first.  I will probably make it again sometime when my husband is out of town or if I have friends over for lunch, etc. since I really enjoyed it even though he did not.

My husband said "this is really good, I am really enjoying this" makes this a 5 star for me! I changed the rice to potato, some olive oil instead of the butter and left out the cream, but left everything else the same...oh and doubled the recipe so we would have leftovers!  I will make this again for sure!

VERY GOOD! I made this soup because it has a fun name and thought my family would try it for that reason.  We served 4 bowls out the "6 servings" amount and were all disappointed that there was not more.  I would recommend at least doubling the recipe.  The only changes I made were that I used brown rice, precooked my chicken before adding it to the soup and excluded the cream at the end.  Definately a make again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Good base recipe for us.  My 12 and 14 year old requested that I increase the carrots and rice. They also like tons of apples. My tweek was substituting coconut milk for the heavy cream.

Fantastic soup! I double the curry and add a little cayenne for some heat. Brown rice, of course, just have to simmer a little longer so the rice cooks through. Stretch it easily by just adding more broth at the beginning, and extra spices. My friends go nuts for this soup!

Delicious! I made MSBLUERASP's version, substituting potato for rice, olive oil for butter, and 1% milk for cream. My fiance, who's trying to lose weight, was amazed at how little fat and calories were in it! All my ingredients were rather finely chopped, and the apple really blends nicely. I will be doubling the recipe, and freezing it. This is especially a treat as a diet soup!

very good, and very curry tasting.  if you don't like the taste of curry, you might want to back off that spice.

With almost 400 ratings, maybe another isn't necessary, but here goes. This soup is incredibly good. Followed posted recipe as is, with the exception of adding 1/2 lb of mushrooms. Great soup with some warm dinner rolls.

This was very nice!  I made it pretty much as written, except used cubed left-over chicken, olive oil instead of butter, 1 small apple, and maybe a little extra carrot, as I only had baby carrots, so tried to estimate how much "1 carrot" would be.  I found I had to almost double the curry powder to get any curry flavor, but other than that it was a very tasty soup (and a good way to use left-over chicken)!

I really like this- have made it several times and I find the kind of apple you use makes a big difference. I like somethign like an Ida Red or Macintosh..tried it with a Red Delicious tonite and it did not seem to give it the flavor the other types did.. was kind of bland. But with the apples with a little more 'bite' it was delicous!

DELICIOUS. I wasn't sure about this apple-curry-vegetable blend, but wow it was amazing. And I had to leave out the flour and rice because I'm not allowed to eat them, but the soup turned out wonderful nonetheless. I just wish I'd doubled the recipe! EDIT: I initially tried this with vegetable broth, and then when I made it again, I used chicken broth. I found that for me, the chicken broth overpowered the other flavors, so I prefer to use vegetable broth.

Yummy! Only made a few small changes to the recipe: Didn't use chicken, used 1 cup cooked white rice (had some leftover in the fridge), subbed rosemary for the thyme, and added a dallop of sour cream to each serving instead of the heavy cream. I've made this a few times now, and it's absolutely delicious! My 4 and 7 year old gobble it up!

Oh I loved this soup.   Actually my whole family liked it and that includes my three young boys (ages 8, 10 and 12).  I did add more curry powder than called for but otherwise I pretty much followed the exact recipe, minus the butter-I used olive oil instead.  I will definitely make this soup again.  Thanks for a great recipe.

The only thing I changed was using 1/2 tsp Hot madras curry powder and 1 tsp regular curry powder. Made it yesterday and it was delicious.  Waited to review so that I could try the leftovers today and I agree with other reviews, the taste just gets better and better. I can see that I will have to make a double batch next time.  Lovely recipe, thank you for posting it.

This was sooo good. I used leftover chicken. I also added a bit of white pepper just to give it a little kick. I added more rice than the recipe called for but I think I will stick with the amount called for. Too much rice soaked up a lot of liquid so it was more like a "stoup" as Rachael Ray would call it. I didn't try it with the cream but will next time. As far as the apple is concerned, I liked it and don't think it should be omitted. Maybe with some poeple it depends on the type of apple. I used a granny smith because that was all I had. Don't be afraid of fruit in savory dishes. Your taste buds will be in for a surprise.

This recipe was an exceptional example of this soup, definitely got better the second day but still delicious on the first. In case anyone was curious, a bunch of celery and a stalk are totally different. :P Mine was originally a bit thicker due to my ignorance on that subject, but it was still delicious. The spices were right on, although I can't vouch for the measurements, I always spice to taste. I went a bit heavy on the Curry powder and thyme, and I could definitely taste it the next day.

This is different than what we get at our local Indian restaurant, but it is absolutely delicious.  I made it just like the recipe states, except that I doubled it.  I wish I had quadrupled it.  There were no leftovers for our family of 7.

I saw Diners, Drive In's and Dives and they showed this type of soup.  We got busy the day I made it and were unable to eat it for a couple of days.  The curry flavor is mild but warms you. This was a wonderful, warm, yummy soup.  My husband doesn't even like curry and he loved it, saying it was a "do over."

I was looking for a chicken/rice soup and came across this recipe.  What a strange name....  Anyway, my husband says it's a keeper, and I agree.  I have no idea what the purpose of the apple is...I couldn't taste or see it.  I feel like it was an unnecessary step and will omit this ingredient when I make this recipe in the future.  I also used half & half because I didn't have any heavy cream, and I doubled the chicken to make it more hearty.

This soup is so good. I diced the apples finely so they would melt into the soup. I went all the way with the butter and hot cream - you don't NEED it - but oh my does it make it better.

The taste of this recipe is very pungent and flavorful.  Doubling the recipe produces about five servings, if this is the main course.  I substituted olive oil for butter and used a 1/2 chicken broth + 1/2 water mixture.  Cooking the rice for 20 minutes left it really mushy - would try 10 minutes next time.  The amount of liquid to solid was about right.

Great soup - you should definitely double or triple the recipe.  I recommend cutting the apple into fairly big chunks (about 3/4 inch).  I didn't use 1/4 cup butter - just a ~ tbsp of olive oil is fine.  Also, I don't see the need for the cream - this is great and so much healthier without it.  I did try mine with some fat free half and half the first time, which is good, but you're fine if you don't put any in.  I cannot get enough of this soup!

I followed the recipe on this except celery (not a fan!) and I used one of the Costco rotiserrie chickens for the meat.  This soup made my whole house smell so warm and cozy while it was cooking!  I added the apples (chopped quite small) and was a little hesitant about it but you couldn't even tell they were in there - and I am super picky!  My mother in law loved it and asked for the recipe and made it for her friends the next week.  You know it is good if your mother in law asks for the recipe!  I can't wait to make it again.  This time I might add some coconut milk to it as well....

Wow!  Super good!  The flavors are amazing together and it gets better a day or two later (if it lasts that long!)  I use evaporated skim milk instead of heavy cream to cut down on fat and double the recipe because I love the leftovers!  A must try!!

I was really looking for something different and good and this is it! I doubled the curry (pretty spicy, but that works for our fam) and doubled the apples.  I used no-chicken chicken broth and didn't add the cream at the end.  It came out GREAT!!  Even my 8-year old, picky eater, asked for seconds.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

while it wasn't bad, it was boring. I stuck to the recipe aside from adding a little more the curry and onion to get more flavor - didn't do much.

My husband grew up eating such dishes, and he said it was "spot on".  He also asked me to save the recipe and use it often.  Considering the results, it wasn't difficult to make, either.  BTW, I loved it, too!

This soup was delicious and incredibly easy! I did the recipe according to the first review, where she replaced the butter, flour, rice and cream with olive oil, potatoes, and milk. I actually forgot to put the milk in in the end and it still tasted great.  My friend had made garlic nan which went PERFECTLY!   I will def make this recipe again!

Very good!  Not as spicy as I was expecting.  It was almost more of a cream chicken soup.  Next time, I'll use low-sodium chicken broth because it was slightly too salty.  Plus, I'll probably add a bit more curry powder.

Perfection! Double the recipe for 6 people. Over the last few years- I've made this recipe about 20 times and it always impresses and never disappoints! It goes great with the curried coconut chicken recipe that I found on allrecipes. :)

I did not have any apples on hand, so instead I added a (small) handful of dried cranberries, to try give it a little of the fruit and sweetness an apple would have added.  Not being a fan of heavy cream (and especially not the calories!), I upped the flour to 2 tablespoons.  Also added a handful of chopped fresh spinach, and a clove of garlic.  It's wonderful straight off the stove... can't wait to try it tomorrow when the flavors have had a chance to blend!

Amazing amazing amazing. If a restaurant served this I'd be a regular. This is universally enjoyed by everyone who's had it. It became a topic of conversation in our staff room simply from the smell. I had to direct several people to the recipe. We used slightly more veggies and grated both the carrots and apple.

This is the most amazing soup!  I usually don't like to suggest additions to someone's recipe but ok... just this once.  I added fresh ginger, garlic, cilantro, lots more curry powder than called for, cooked rice I had left over and a can of coconut milk at the end.  I also grated a whole red apple and simmered it with the veggies.  Thank you so much for making our taste buds very, very, happy!

I put WAY too much curry in (T instead of t) but this still tasted great!  I ended up pureeing everything with my immersion blender after it cooked a while and THEN added *cooked* chicken cubes.  I used brown rice I had cooked ahead of time.  I added a handful of raisins for more sweetness (was worried about how a big granny smith would taste).  My 18mo. old loved it. Next time, I may puree in some chopped spinach as well although I'm sure the soup will be a less attractive color.

This soup was absolutely delicious. And I even omitted the cream at the end to make it a little healthier.  I added just a little bit of fresh minced garlic (maybe a teaspoon) at the beginning with the onions, carrots, and celery.  Wonderfully easy and refreshing.  Plus, I didn't have any French bread and didn't want to go to the store; so I served it with tortilla chips...turned out great.

This soup was great! With some alterations, I made it much healthier. I used oil instead of butter and 2% milk instead of cream. I didn't have any curry powder on hand, so I made a blend of cumin, coriander, cardamom, and chili powder. I also left out the rice because I didn't have any. Overall, it sounds like I really changed the essence of the soup with all the alterations, but I really don't think it's too severely different.

I found this soup to be very good and to make it less fattening try plain yogourt in place of the sour cream. I liked it just the way it was.

I've never in my life met a soup that I loved as much as this soup.  We make a huge pot of it every couple weeks and keep a good amount of it frozen in lunch sized portions in the freezer.  The only thing we change is this:  We add a LOT of curry.  I double the recipe but still add about 2 and 1/2 TBS of muchi curry.  We use brown rice instead of white and the rest is as is.  I'm so thankful for this one. Thanks, "Tunisianswife"!!  Love it!

This recipe was delicious! I added some extra veg (carrots/celery), and went with 3 cans chicken broth, and one can water. Also used wild/brown rice, and whole wheat flour. And served with sour cream. I cannot wait to make this recipe again. The next time, I will add some more veggies, and broth/water, so that we have some leftovers! I will also omit the flour altogether, so this recipe can also be gluten free (provided you use a gluten free chicken broth).

Oh, my gosh. This is one of the best soups I've ever had. I have a gluten sensitivity, so I left out the flour. I used 2 diced potatoes instead of rice, and used two chicken breasts, which I seasoned with pepper and garlic powder and seared in a little olive oil before cutting into cubes and adding to soup. I also did not add the heavy cream but instead put a dollop of sour cream on top of each serving. Thanks for the recipe, Lise P. I was wondering about Mulligatawny ever since the Seinfeld episode :-) Now I'm hooked!

This is probably the best soup I've ever tasted! I was a little unsure when I was making it, and even the smell threw me off a bit, but it tastes wonderful! My boyfriend LOVES this soup, and asks for it all the time. The only thing I really changed was that I added more curry (I love it spicy!) and used paste instead of powder because that was all I had. Yum yum! I've made this soup countless times, everyone loves it. I always double the recipe and the soup actually tastes better on day 2 or 3!

Very tasty. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out very thick, more like a stew. I ended up adding more than a cup of water towards the end of cooking it in order to make it a bit more soup-like.

5 stars = The Best! I get cravings for this soup at least once a week, I can bribe husband to cross off his honey-do list with this soup! I make as is with no adjustments, except I double, even triple the recipe!!

Great soup, very similar to those I've tried in Bangladeshi restaurants. This is definitely a thick, hearty stew-like soup with vegetables, rice, chicken. I had to add a bit more pepper and cayenne to kick it up a notch- otherwise followed the recipe to the T. P.s. heavy cream is completely unnecessary, as stated by several other reviewers.

This is really good. But I due suggest that you only put in a 1/4 of a cup of rice. I thought a little more would be good but you need to add more water and about 10 mins more to the cooking time. If you want something thick and not a soup add a cup of rice but if you would like some broth only add what is suggested.

Wow--this was delicious. I didn't know quite what to expect, but this soup was really, really good. I made a few changes--I added about 1/3 c red lentils to thicken the stew (and then omitted the flour and reduced the butter to two Tbs), I used brown rice instead of white, and I added in a couple of Fresno red chilis because I like spicy food. With or without the cream this was outstanding, but I think a tablespoon or so of cream in each bowl really added something (I didn't bother to heat it first, either). Great recipe--I plan to make it again this week!

Love this recipe. I've been messing with it for a while and I like to buy a whole rotisserie chicken, cut off the breast meat (save for some other dish), remove the skin and boil the rest in 9 to 10 cups of water for at least 3 hours. Strain out the meat and bones (separate later when they cool) and put the liquid in the fridge overnight. Then spoon 3/4 of the congealed fat off the top, add all that good meat you boiled off the bones last night and use this for your broth. You'll end up with about 8 cups but you don't have to make a double batch of the soup. I always double the amount of curry and add a tsp of garam masala and 1/2 tsp cayenne.  TASTE BEFORE YOU ADD SALT! The homemade broth can have unpredictable amounts of salt.

Great Soup, my 2 year old ate all of it!!
I grated the carrot and the apple. I didn't use cream. Like another reviewer suggested I took about one cup out and blended it until smooth and added it back in to thicken. I also doubled the rice, and added a squeeze of lemon at the end, with a little bit more pepper. ( I also used garlic with the onion at the start of the cooking).

Delicious. As others noted, this really does get better as it sits - fabulous leftovers! I added a little hot chili paste and 2 kinds of curry, as I like more spice and flavor. Also, I used light coconut milk for a richer base. 

Yum!

This soup is unbelievably delicious. My husband said it was the best soup he's ever had.  I made it exactly as listed and it came out great. I'll probably make twice as much next time though because we didn't have any leftovers!  Also, will add a little more rice, chicken and apple according to our own personal preference.  Thanks for the incredible recipe!

First time trying Mulligatawny....Soup was great. I used 1/2 and 1/2 and doubled as other did.  I think next time I'll use olive oil instead of butter. Nice change from the usual soups.  Thanks!!!

this was delicious and very very easy! I followed the recipe exactly. As a beginning cook I have a tendency to screw dishes up and get frustrated but I didn't mess up this one, and I don't think any of you could if you tried =) Plus it tasted very fresh and restaurant quality. I love soups from Au Bon Pain, and this tasted just like one of those - if they served it, it would be my favorite.

We loved this...I did change a few things...I added two cloves of crushed garlic (can't have Indian food without garlic!)...added 1 1/2 tsp garam masala...diced two potatoes and added them with the rice...and, most importantly I used basmati rice - not long grain...this will make the soup taste even more authentic!!!  Oh, I also used half and half instead of cream and used olive oil instead of butter to help cut the fat.  I didn't saute the chicken, just chopped it up and put it in the simmering soup...DELICIOUS!!!!!

LOVELY, LOVELY, LOVELY!!!!  I can't believe how amazingly wonderful this soup/stew is!  Doubled curry, tripled chicken, added potato's (2 med sized), and used coconut milk as a substitute.  This is definitely a family favorite, not to mention my husband enjoyed even though he's not a fan of curry flavored meals!!!!

Very good soup.  I made a couple of minor changes...no rice or flour, just added one potato.  No stewed tomatoes, I despise them in soup.  I didn't have mace, or cloves.  I also added some ginger/garlic paste, cumin, lentils and a pinch of cayenne.  Turned out really good.  Even my DD liked it, and that was most surprising!

This was absolutely wonderful.  Several changes: I used brown rice, increased the curry to 2tsp, grated the apple, and only added a 1/4 cup of cream.  Wow, it was wonderful.  My husband complained that there was a lack of left overs for him the next day.  We will definitely make this again and make a double!

Very good soup!
To cut down on fat, I sauteed the vegetables in olive oil, and pureed everything for a few seconds with an inversion blender (no flour/butter).  I also felt the taste was great without cream.  I threw in three cloves of garlic and a pinch of red pepper just for fun.  Overall, a very flavorful soup!

After tasting this soup in a restaurant for the first time, I immediately came to All Recipes to find a version that I could make. This is the one I chose, and it was excellent. I doubled all ingredients (except the margarine) for a larger pot of soup; added cubed potato to the simmering soup; used coconut milk instead of cream; brown rice instead of white; and used pre-cooked chicken strips instead of raw.

This soup is delicious and it makes great leftovers!  I chopped everything super fine and the soup had a great texture.  I added extra carrots and celery, and I also used fat free milk instead of cream.

this was really good. I made it more like a curry instead of soup, because that is what I felt like. I cooked brown rice separate for the sauce to go on. the only thing I did different was mixed the flour and some cream, then added it to the soup to make it thicken. was really good also added more curry

EXCELLENT! I doubled the recipe, doubled the curry powder, took out the salt, and added chopped cauliflower. I did not double the butter, and used 2% milk instead of cream. My husband (who is Indian) vacuumed his bowl clean in minutes and begged for seconds. Next time I'm going to triple the recipe and freeze some thanks to the suggestions of the other reviews. Thank you for a wonderful addition to my recipe book! Great job!

This is the best soup I have ever made. Very simple and inexpensive to make, and VERY tasty. This is definitely a keeper. I'm just sorry I didn't make much the first time (I halved it because I wasn't sure I would like it or not). Next time I will try a few other reviewers suggestions: add more curry powder, try some garam masala, substitute the cream with coconut milk and use brown rice instead of the white rice. And DIFINITELY increase the amount so that I have enough left over to freeze for future meals. Wonderful recipe! Thank you!

Absolutely delicious! I did boil a small whole chicken for the broth and then I doubled the recipe adding a little more carrot, celery, chicken and rice. We like hearty soups! The flavor was superb! Oh, and I did not double the butter when I sauteed the veggys.

I made this as a starter so i did not add chicken as the main dish was chicken and it was great. I think it would have been even better with the chicken but it was still good. The apple and carrot pieces were kinda big i think i would have liked them smaller but still very good and easy ingredients to find.

Very Good!!! I doubled the recipe, and used brown rice (the only kind we had) and added it right after the stock. I was worried it wouldn't be thick, but once the rice cooked, it thickened up. I left out the heavy cream, but if I had coconut milk on hand, I definately would have added that!

This was a great dish.  The cream is what makes it work.  My kids loved it.  The really liked having apples in their soup.

WOW.  This recipe is wonderful.  I was looking for a recipe with curry because my husband likes it, and I decided to try this soup.  Not only did my husband love it, but the kids and I loved it too!  My only complaint is that it made such a small amount--next time I will double or even triple it.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it was delicious.

Definitely double this!  2 adult main course servings as written.  Cream makes it rich and satisfying; could be left out as a starter but I'd keep it for a main course.  Go with homemade chicken broth if you have it.

My husband and I had Indian night last night, and I remember having this soup at one of our local restaurant. Though the soup looked a bit different than what we had at the restaurant, the soup was still absolutely amazing. I wished if I doubled the recipe. I did not make any changes to the recipe, it was perfect. Thank you for a great recipe.

I made this soup for a luncheon at work and it was a total hit.  Everyone loved it.  I used coconut milk instead of cream and left out the apple....instead of using chicken breast, I boiled 2 whole chickens and shredded the meat up before putting it in the soup.  It was really yummy.  Thanks!

Yum-O! We just finished licking our bowls clean. The soup was fantastic. I used more potatoes and less rice. I used a whole (large) Fuji apple and pureed more than half of the soup, leaving about 1/3 of it chunky. We ate this as a main dish with buttered toasty homemade bread. Will make again for sure!

This soup is amazing!  For awhile I've been searching for a great, Indian-inspired soup, and now I've found it.  Dee-lish.  I doubled the amount of curry that the recipe called for, added at least one extra cup of chicken broth, used only half the butter called for, and substituted half and half for the cream, and it was definitely rich enough - can't imagine it with full butter amount and cream.  This recipe is great!

This recipe is just absolutely YUMMY! A couple things I changed based on the comments here: I doubled the recipe, added a cup more stock, upped the Curry to 3 tbsp & added 1/4 tsp of Cayenne. I also removed the Cream in exchange for equal parts of 1/2 & 1/2 and Coconut Milk. For a seasonal change - I added about a 1 1/2 cups total of the following combo cubed:   summer squash, yukon or red potatoes and sweet potatoes (I steamed these a bit before putting them in with the chicken and the rest of those ingredients). 

My fiance absolutely loves this. You can also toss in some golden raisins or currants to garnish.

Yummy.

This soup is AWESOME! I was getting so tired of making the same old things. This spiced meal planning up a bit! I followed other suggestions and used between 3-4 tsp. of curry powder. I also cannot eat gluten, so I substituted the 1 1/2 T. of flour for 1 T. potato starch. This worked great. I added regular long grain white rice in...I was afraid it would soak up all the juice, but it didn't at all. Thank you for such a good recipe. I will definitely make this again!

Sooo delicious!  My family had never tasted anything with curry flavor, and they adored this soup.  I used chicken thighs (I already had them) cut into very small cubes, which turned out wonderfully, and brown rather than white rice added along with the chicken broth had a great texture.  Throughout the simmering stages, I added water in 1/2 cup increments to get the right consistency.  Using a whole apple and throwing in some raisins really made the soup fabulous.  Can't wait for leftovers!

Wonderful! A tasty, comforting soup for the dog days of winter. I made it for guests and they said I should market it.
I didn't use the chicken meat or rice and used 2 tbsp. of flour instead of 1 & 1/2 and ALL of the cream. Plus I finished it with a drizzel of extra virgin olive oil and it turned out hearty and delicous. I served it with cheese scones as a meal and everyone was satisfied enough and had just a smidgen of room for dessert.

This is an excellent recipe!  My husband who is from India loved it!  I didn't add the cream/milk and it tasted terrific that way.  Next time I make it I will add either milk or coconut milk as one reviewer suggested.  The only change I made was to add some cayenne and I added more curry powder than the recipe called for.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good!!  Like others, I added more curry.  I also substituted golden raisins for the apple. (Didn't have any apples)  I also added about a tablespoon of chopped cilantro in the final cooking.  Really yummy.

Excellent soup!  I increased the servings to eight and used 3 TBS. of curry (2 TBS. regular curry, 1 TBS. of Calcutta Heat curry seasoning).  I left out the celery and used long grain white rice (adding more than the recipe called for).  It turned out pretty thick, so I added extra broth.  I'd definitely make this again!

My husband loves mulligatawny soup and Indian food. He was skeptical that this recipe would taste like what he was accustomed to having at his favorite Indian restaurants. Due to his pickiness we ommitted the celery, carrot, and apple from the recipe. He was surprised that this recipe called for chicken. In the end, he loved the soup and is asking that I make it regularily. Next time I will double the recipe as it only made about 3-4 servings rather than the 6 that it suggested. I would also add either a little water or additional chicken broth to liquidfy it a little more. It was pretty thick...but delicious!

Great, really enjoyed. Good without cream, but cream really brings out the flavors.
Used 1/2 butter & 1/2 coconut oil, wonderful depth added doing so.

I thought this was great - no changes except milk in place of heavy cream. Next time I think I'll use less butter, or use olive oil instead to make it healthier, but the 1/4c. butter makes it very rich and tasty!

Really good!  I doubled the recipe and am glad I did; otherwise there wouldn't have been enough for dinner tonight for my husband and I, let alone lunch tomorrow.  Like other reviewers I added far more curry than specified (3 TBSP), 1/2 tsp of cayenne, and 1/2 cup of brown basmati rice (highly recommended - I added it with the broth and it was perfect by the time the soup was done).  I also added a bouillon cube with the apples because I thought the flavor could be a little deeper, but I blame that on the brand of broth I used, not on the recipe.  I used whole milk instead of cream, and some leftover frozen tofu instead of a second chicken breast.  The final result was delicious - the fella said it was his favorite thing that I've made recently.  Definitely adding it to the rotation!

I thought this recipe was as good as everyone else and my entire family liked it.  Here's what I did slightly differently:  I listened to everyone else's feedback and doubled the recipe.  I also added almost an entire garlic bulb minced at the very beginning with the onions and carrots.  I also used 1/2 cup brown rice (per batch so a total of 1 cup since I doubled the recipe) and added it at the beginning with the chicken broth.  Finally for the double batch I used 1/4 teaspoon of sage.  I gave my family the option of coconut milk on top.  My mother (visiting) used it as did my wife.  My daughters and I did not.  Everyone loved it and with three adults and two very small children that double recipe designed to serve twelve had about 2 cups left over!  Fantastic!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was delicious and a big hit. I just wish you had stated for the novice chef over here whether the chicken should be cooked before it was thrown in. After consulting the experts we put it in raw and it turned out great, but there were a few minutes of concern that I'd give my friends salmonella.

This was an interesting soup.  I love curry dishes, so that's why I decided to try this.  The day I made it, I would say it was a 2-star.  Curries are always better the second day, and the same was true of this soup.  Today, it's a 3-star.  I did make homemade naan with it which was wonderful!

This was an awesome soup, but only made about 3 servings!  We ate it as a meal, and I'm not sure if the original recipe was for a pre-meal (hence the # of servings).

This was sooooooo good!  I used about 1/2 cup brown rice which I added in the beginning of the simmering time.  I also cut the cream down to 1/4 cup (since that's all I had left) and leftover diced turkey.  It was thicker due to the increase in rice, yet so rich and creamy despite the decrease of cream.  My family gobbled this up and there were no leftovers.  I will definitely make this again!  Thanks for sharing.

This soup is so good! The first time I made it I forgot the cream and it was still really good. I like it both ways.

Very good soup! On a cold Pennsylvania evening it was just right. I had to add garlic, put it in the beginning with the other vegatables. Of course more curry, and some red pepper. I used coconut milk just cause I like it and it worked fine. My 4 year old ate a large bowl and my husband had not a clue what the apples were!

Very good. I prepared identical to recipe, except I doubled the rice for more bite. And I used a homemade curry powder. Very yummy!

I'm really pleased with this recipe's results. I'm used to having a restaurant version of the soup and I was trying to duplicate that flavour...it worked! Delicious! I did, however puree the vegetable a little to give a creamier consistancy and added 2 Tbls of curry powder because I like it stronger, yum!

This was absolutely delicious!  We added 1/2 tsp garam masala--this really made the dish--and realized after eating that we forgot to add the cream.  Didn't miss it as it was fabulous anyway, but will be sure to try it next time.  Oh yes, there will be many a next time with this recipe!

This is the very best version of this soup that I have ever tried!  There is a restaurant called The Old Spaghetti Factor, and on thursdays they offer this soup with lunch only.  This recipe is just about identical to that one....YUM!!!

As a beginner in the kitchen I made this recipe and my family LOVED it, including my 5 yr old. The 2nd time I made it, I used tofu instead of chicken and it was equally as delicous. 3rd time for a girls luncheon they all thought I was a fabulous "chef"!

After reading several previous reviews, I opted to triple this recipe to ensure enough to feed 8 people.  What a waste.  None of us cared for this at all. Now I have alot left over & nobody wants it. Sorry! I won't be repeating this.

So simple to make, yet so tasty! I didn't have carrots (put in Califlower instead), added a bit of curry paste and half tsp of curry powder, added MORE rice, didn't serve with cream - and they were delicious!

If you are looking for authentic Mulligatawny soup this is not it and the submitter said it was only Indian inspired.  All in all it was good - did add garam masala and more curry.  Authentic Mulligatawny soup is very time consuming to make so this is a quick fix!  Thanks submitter.

Add a pinch of Garam Masala at the same time you add the curry powder and it really makes it outstanding.  This was SOOO good.  I hate to admit it- the recipe says it serves 6 but my husband and I ate the whole recipe in one sitting!  I also chose to use half and half rather than cream- just to cut down on the fat.  Add the garam masala (an indian spice) and you have a 100% perfect recipe!

This was a fun soup to make and got everyone involved in cooking dinner.  I doubled the chicken and next time will double the rice and chicken broth as well but overall it was wonderful!  I served it with ward cheese bread and mushroom salad.

Wish I could give it a 10 star. 
This is the best! If it tastes like it is missing something, add a bit more salt. I use salt only when there is flour. Makes that difference. Also, like others say, double the batch.

Great quick soup. I didn't change anything in the recipe. The apples were an interesting note..texture wise a lot like a potato thought with a bite (as I used a green apple). I do think next time I would try for a spicier curry as it didn't have any heat with the kind I used but was still good. I did not serve with cream as I forgot all about it, but can't say it was missed. It also did not make very much. Just enough for my son and I to have a bowl at dinner with two small servings left over for lunch the next day - so next time I will double the recipe. I served this with the focaccia bread recipe from this site and it was a good pairing.

Absolutely delicious!  I first heard of Mulligatawny Soup on the Seinfeld Show from the "Soup Nazi."  I had to try it and it is my favorite.  The complex flavor is remarkable and the heavy cream added when seving really makes it!

Curry lovers, you MUST try this soup!  It's SO GOOD!  I made it as stated, but next time I think it would add some more curry--the amount depends on the kind you're using, and I suspect mine was not particularly strong.  Definitely double the recipe because for the amount of chopping it doesn't make a lot, and you'll want more.

We really enjoyed this; although we initially felt it was missing something -- the addition of some cayenne pepper seemed to do the trick. I served this soup with warm flat bread. It was a simple, yet satisfying meal.

The one thing you need to know, is I doubled this recipe, and then it fed 6. So quadruple it and then save the rest, it's very yummy, and makes great leftovers. I loved the flavor, and everybody in my family gave it 5 stars. (I added a little more rice, and diced the apples)

This soup was fabulous! Only thing I changed was I pureed the apple before putting it in because my husband hates fruit in his food. Not only did it hide the apple chunks but thickened the soup up nicely. He loved the soup and raved about it.. no idea there was apple in it!

MY family loved this I doubled the recipe and barely had enough for lunch leftovers. My husband said it reminded him of a soup that his grandmother used to make.

This "soup" (actually more like a thick rice mixture) was wonderful and I will definitely make it again!  Thanks for the recipe!

First time cooking Indian cuisine- loved it. Few changes, omiited butter and used just a tsp of vegetable oil- also half n' half instead of cream- added a bit more broth to make up for the reduced amount of half n' half used while serving. Great recipe.

We served this recipe at an "Apple Harvest Luncheon" for an assisted living facility - it was a HUGE hit!  The recipe is just spicy enough to be flavorful without being too hot.

Very good and not too spicy. I first tried this soup in a restaurant and loved it and wanted to make it at home so I came to allrecipes.com and found this recipe. I added a little green pepper (2 tbsp.)& a sprinkle of garlic powder.  This is a keeper, thank you Lise P.

This was an exceptional soup and super easy to make. I made only 1 change to the recipe - I switched out the cream for 2% evaporated milk. I used yellow curry powder and the soup was creamy smooth with a subtle curry flavour. Next time, and there will be many, I may try it with coconut milk. I'm trying to think of main dishes I can serve this with so I can share it with company! It should be noted in the recipe that the chicken must be cooked before you add it to the soup.

I rarely write reviews but this soup is one of our favorites! I follow the recipe exactly but use half and half to save calories and a little extra curry as well. It definitely goes fast! ?Thank you for the recipe??

Made this for a multicourse dinner, was very popular even with the kids. I didn’t have curry powder so I used the conversion of 1tsb powder = 1tbs curry paste and it seemed to work out well. It was a bit thick so to thin it out and increase the volume (we had 8 mouths to feed, this was the first course) I made another round of about 4 cups of cooked veggies with broth, curry and chicken.

This soup is sooooo good. You’ll be sorry if you don’t double it. I cooked my chicken first so I could shred it, a personal preference and will up the curry next time.

Excellent soup recipe. I used 6 cups chicken broth, 2 tsp. curry, 4 carrots, 1 pound of chicken and 1/2 tsp. of black pepper.   I added the extra chicken broth because the soup was thicker than I wanted.

This is an easy and delicious soup!  I buy a cooked roasted chicken to save time, and used a Granny Smith apple, and extra curry around 2.5 tsps.  It’s always a hit!  And double the recipe, your gonna need it!

This was a good soup and reminded me of another recipe on here called Beaker's Vegetable soup.  It didn't taste like apples at all and had a mild curry flavor.  I forgot to add the cream at the end, but it was still tasty.  I served at a work potluck and many people said they liked it.  I did add a bit more rice to thicken it up to a more stew/curry consistency.

This is a totally different flavor profile than what I usually make, but I was really pleased with it! My 11 year old’s eyes lit up when she tasted it. I was hesitant to cook the rice in the soup, but I think it really was nice to impart the curry flavor into the rice. I omitted the cream, though next time I may add coconut milk. This will definitely be a repeat meal.

Tonight's version had 2 t. of curry seasoning, and no pepper, and it was wonderful.

Absolutely love the soup the only changes I made was I made a double recipe and I used a fourth a cup of butter and a fourth a cup of coconut oil and I shredded half of the apples and cubed half the apples and I did not add the cream it was yummy!

Absolutely delicious! I used sweet potatoes instead of rice. Also, tripled the recipe and added a bit more curry. Will definitely make this a staple!

Ok, I made a delicious soup based on this recipe. BUT I did modify based on personal preferences. I completely left out flour,  rice, and cream. Instead, I grated a sweet potato to cook into it.  It might not be creamy, but I still immensely enjoyed it. I feel like the core flavors were not changed.  I did bump up the amount of curry powder, and added just a bit of ground red pepper.

Everybody I have made this for loves it. I often add more of the vegetables and a little bit of extra Apple. We like it best when topped with a little bit of goat cheese. The perfect flavor combination!!

Really good and very easy.  I made my own chicken stock which really added to the flavor.  I just used milk to finish.  Added a bit of cayenne and graham masala. Added a maybe 2 tsp of cornstarch mixed with bit of cold water to help thicken up at the end.

This is really delicious. One of my new favorites and pretty easy to make. 1 suggestion: Cover when you simmer, so you don't lose liquid.

Oh my word! Best soup ever!  Everyone asked for the recipe. I started with a Costco rotisserie chicken and used Chef Johns recipe for Roasted Chicken stock from this website.  Then doubled this recipe. Fantastic at lunch. Even better at dinner. Loved one reviewer’s suggestion for topping with scallions. just fabulous!

This was sooooo good. I used honey crisp apples and added a zucchini since I needed to use up a zucchini. I also broiled seasoned chicken for 6 minutes before adding it to the pot. Scrumptious!  Will definitely make again.

The flavor is really good but I thought it would be soupier. It was quite thick & to be honest, looked unappetizing. So, next time, I might consider adding more liquid or even pureeing the mixture before adding the chicken. I would make again if I had the ingredients on hand, but in terms of how appetizing it looked, I would skip.

This is always a hit in my house. With 4 picky kiddos, it's hard to please sometimes, so.... I did make some adjustments, though. I doubled the recipe, of course, but also threw in some of my favorite spices: bay leaf, sage, fresh thai basil, cardamom, turmeric, fennel seed, and a few cloves. I also upped the curry to 2tsp and added another small apple. The result is A-MAZ-ING!!

I made this once following the recipe pretty closely. The only noticable deviation I made was to puree the apple because I didn't want apple chunks in my soup. I'm not sure if that's what caused the apple flavor to be so strong (probably) but I ended up putting about an extra 1 tsp of curry to compensate for the stronger apply flavor and then a pinch of cayenne to spice to taste. It was pretty tasty in the end.

If I made it again, I would omit the cream like other reviewers mentioned. I didn't handle the dairy well (nor did my fiance) and it would still be flavorful without it. I may use coconut milk like others mentioned or just add extra chicken broth.

This was incredible! Saying the name is so fun. I just loved the flavors, perfect fall soup! I chopped the apple as fine as I could and my husband ate it! He noticed the curry flavor obviously but not the apple. Woohoo this is the second curry dish he’s tried even though he used to say “I don’t eat curry.” Win, Win! So good you have to make it!

My husband and I really enjoyed this soup.  I like that adjustments could easily be made to make it lower in calories.  We had it for dinner and got 3 soup mug sized servings from this recipe so I will at least double it next time.

Very tasty and simple. We used Balti curry, par-boiled (minute) brown rice and leftover rotisserie chicken and it had great flavor, texture and body.

Really good. The family is already asking for it again.
I'll double the recipe next time. 
I used a little more curry powder than the recipe, and I'd probably double the rice, but it is a really good and hearty soup, in just an hour.
Thanks for sharing it.

Loved this soup recipe.  I made this soup along with the BBQ chicken sandwiches on this sight for a party of 15 and everybody loved both the soup and sandwiches.  Very easy recipe and very tasty with or without the cream.  I personally like the cream.  I did not feel any need to change the recipe.  I am making this soup along with other soups and sandwiches for a party of 80 this week. Yum, yum!

So, so, so good! I doubled the recipe based on other reviewers comments and was not disappointed. Used rotisserie chicken for ease and better flavor. I added some parsley from the garden, garlic and some garam masala, then served with warm bread and it was amazing for a cool, rainy night! Thank you for a great recipe.

I did as others suggested and made a double batch with double the curry powder. I also added a peeled, chopped eggplant to the veggies and corn and cashews with the broth. I cooked it longer than required to give the cashews time to soften and then, as we have a vegetarian in our family, replaced the chicken with thinly sliced, 1-inch pieces of homemade seitan. Delicious!

My husband and son were both skeptical of this soup when they saw me adding diced apples to the pot, but after tasting it they both added more to their bowls. We all loved it, so I’ll definitely be adding this to my repertoire! I did shred the carrots instead of dicing them.

I made this soup last week. Excellent recipe.  The only changes that I made were adding chopped mushrooms, using a rotisserie chicken, and eliminated the cream at serving.   Will certainly make again. 

Nice job Lise, thank you!

Delicious! I doubled the recipe after reading other reviews and you’ll want to too! I used rotisserie chicken to add more flavor and increased the rice to a cup which made it a lot thicker, but otherwise followed the recipe.

After reading reviews I followed much of the advice; doubling the onion, carrot and celery.  I added 3 diced potatoes and 1/4 cup uncooked rice.  I also added 3 tbsp curry powder and cayenne.  I had some chicken stock made from a rotisserie chicken which I added.  No chicken on hand so this went meat free.  I simmered this for ~2 hours. Completely forgot to add cream - didn't need it though as this turned out so well!  Mine was thick like a stew, will be making again for sure.

I make this often.  I always double, use 3 TBLs of Curry, 1/4 cup of butter (even for double recipe) and at least 3 chicken breasts or a whole Rotisserie chicken, plus basmati brown rice.  We tend to omit the cream at the end.

Love, love, love! Used coconut milk instead of heavy cream because that’s what I had on hand. Will make this again very soon and triple recipe so I can freeze the extra!

Delicious alternative to chicken and rice soup. I did 1.5X the curry and it was perfect for my kids. I think my husband would have liked it better with double the curry

This is literally Japanese apple curry, there is nothing Indian about this dish (other than generally being a curry). Indian curries tend to be lentil or tomato based and have an exotic flavor due to the spices used, this is savory, uses a roux, and tastes exactly like Japanese apple curry. It isn't terrible but if I wanted to eat Japanese curry I would have followed my usual recipe which I think is far better, I'm miffed at wasting my time and ingredients with a lesser recipe. To make this recipe even more like traditional apple curries, ditch the celery, add potatoes, minced garlic, and a tbsp of ketchup and soy sauce. You would normally cook the roux separately and brown it like you would making a cajun roux but it's not a requirement. Cook the rice separately, it's even better that way white rice just isn't meant to be in ANY kind of soup honestly, it gets water logged and gelatinous which I find to be unpleasant, always cook it separate for a nice dry and fluffy texture and then add to the finished soup/curry or serve it on the side of it. For an even better experience use jasmine or bismati rice, bismati is my absolute favorite, and serve with ice water. Alternate between a sip of that ice cold water and a piping hot spoonful of curry. The Japanese love the sensation of the alternating temperatures and I gotta say I agree with them!

Very good!  Will make this again.  We made this using about half the butter called for, and enjoyed it very much -- didn't miss it at all.  I also added salt and pepper when sauteeing the vegetables, and added the thyme with the flour and curry. 
 All quite good.  Next time I'll double the recipe so we have leftovers.

Awesome savory dish when you need a change from the standard winter soups!
I used a bit more curry and cream than called for but it turned out great. Easy recipe to tweak to your tastes.

I’m in the minority here given all the raving reviews but my family and also my visiting in-laws did not care for this soup. We love soup but the sweet flavoring was definitely not for us.

Simplemente exquisita.....segui todos los pasos al pie de la letra, mi única sugerencia seria no usar arroz de grano largo, era el que tenia en casa., creo que sería mejor con el arroz bolo ( el que se usa para arroz con leche) ...definitivamente la volvere a preparar.

I sautéed as directed and then added veggies / chicken / apple and broth to the slow cooker and cooked on high for 4 and low for 2 hours. The chicken was so tender and the flavors blended together beautifully!

Yummy.
Recipe says 6 servings, but I feel like it was more like 4 servings. I will double the recipe next time so I can have leftovers.

I live mulligatawny soups in all variations (I wonder how the “Soup Nazi” made his). I had to change this recipe just a smidge for my vegetarian friend by using vegetable stock instead of chicken. And then I went crazy. I added some pineapple and coconut, as well as cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. I didn’t measure my additions - I was looking more for texture. It smelled good and tasted awesome. It’s a curry fruit soup!  PS - it freezes well

Wow! I suspected I would like this soup based on the ingredients but I had no idea I would love it so much! I made it while my husband was traveling for work figuring he would not like it, but he came home starving and it was quick to heat up so he tried it. He loved it too! Color me shocked! It will be a frequent soup in our household from now on. Thank you for sharing this great recipe!

My son helped make a triple batch of this, because my boyfriend and I are both sick, and forgot the cream at the end. We decided it was delicious as it was. We loved the additional twist of the curry powder!! I think next time, I would put in more apple, double the rice, and less onion, but we're both looking forward to it again tonight!

If you like curry, you will love this soup! It is a family favorite. I make it thicker so it is more of a stew. I don't use cream but add tumeric for a richer color!

We had never had Mulligatawny before, and didn't even know what it was. Following the reviews, it looked tempting, so I had to try it.  Very easy, and very good.  I think I'll make sure I have fresh Curry powder next time.  My picky father even liked it.

So so yummy! I pretty much followed the recipe except used about 1/3 c. of basmati rice (vs. 1/4 c.), added an additional 1/2 tsp of hot curry powder, and used 2% milk (that's what I had on hand + less fat). Easy to make. Recipe as is made enough for 2 of us with a small bit  leftover. So if making this for more than 2, or if you want plenty of leftovers, I would definitely double this. It's a keeper!

A perfect recipe for a slow cooker or instant pot. I tossed everything into an instant pot, doubled down on the spices and had a great dinner in about an hour. Instead of chopping the chicken, I left the breasts whole, then shredded them just before serving.

This was very good; it does need more curry though. I almost doubled the amount of curry but still found that it could have used more. I used up all my curry powder so I also added a bit of Garam Masala as well as some Balti Masala that I had  in the spice-rack. I also added jalapeños, as I had some on hand to use up, as well as some cayenne, as we like a bit of heat and it seemed to go well. We still found the flavour on the subtle side, but very enjoyable none-the-less. I served it with warm naan bread on the side; my kids gobbled it up, and  it made for a yummy & comforting weeknight meal with leftovers for lunch (I doubled the recipe.)

Delicious. Great recipe for beginner cooks like me - soooo easy to make. I did add garam masala - about the same amount as the curry - as recommended by another reviewer. Next time, I'll use the dark meat of the chicken only, just a personal preference. I'll also add some veggies like cauliflower - again just a personal preference. Anyway, the recipe "as is" is fantastic...definitely give it a try!

I made It pretty much as is except for grating the Apple. It’s was delicious! I actually Had to make it again the very next night at the request of my husband. I doubled It the second time to freeze some. We have a family of 4 and didn’t have any leftovers making as listed. It says it serves 6 but I would Say more like 4. This will be going in the rotation!

Loved it.   Simple to make with ingredients I usually have on hand.  I cut saturated fats by subbing olive oil for the butter and evaporated milk for the heavy cream.  I also added a bit more curry and a little cayenne.  I will make this often.

The family loved this so I will make it again.  Not a drop was left!  I doubled the recipe but tripled the curry, added Garam Masala and a small amount of red pepper flakes.  The apple (2 lg Honeycrisp) added bulk but lost all sweetness and apple flavor.  I did not add any cream, wasn't necessary.

This was really good! To make it Keto friendly, I used Tapioca flour and I cooked the rice separately. I served everyone else with some rice in the bottom of the bowl and ate it without for me. Next time I need to remember to reduce the broth amount since I didn't cook the rice in it to absorb some.
Even not doing Keto, I like to cook rice and noodles separate so they don't become mushy.

This is a good comfort soup. I doubled the recipe and made it exactly except for the cream. Even doubling, it was just enough for four. I chopped the apples very small. You really couldn’t taste them. It was delicious. I will definitely make again.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I used basil instead of thyme since I didn't have any thyme. I added 2x the amount of chicken called for, and I accidently added way more curry powder than what was called for (3x the amount 0_0). I also used half cottage cheese (blended), half milk to replace the heavy cream since I didn't have any. Besides, then you get the protein from the cottage cheese. 

It was a bit too thin for my preference, so I cooked up some rice separately to add to it. I think it turned out well after the extra rice was added. People went for seconds, so I take that as a good sign :)

I doubled the curry, used canned coconut milk instead of the cream and grated the apple. Absolutely delish. I also cooked it a little longer to make it thicker.

We did the soup in a slow cooker.  It was delicious.  Used Chicken Masala instead of curry. It had a bit of kick but was very good.  Will make this again.

I love this soup!  I did add a little garam marsala, which kicked up the spiciness. This soup is one of my very favorites, and my husband who is not a soup person loves it too.  I will be making this often.

Changes I made:
1) Added one tsp. brown sugar to step two.
2) Substituted one and one half cups powdered milk for the heavy cream. Added it as straight powder at the end.

It was great!

Fantastic! I used cored and skinned apple dices so they would cook down. I bumped up the curry as others recommended. I added cream as instructed in the recipe, but in the future will not add any cream since it was excellent without it.

Very easy and very good.  Top 5 favorite for sure!  I also increased the curry as everyone else suggested.  In addition to that, I roasted the chicken breasts first in the oven before adding it to soup giving it another layer of flavor.  This will definitely be a go to from now on.

Forgot the thyme but the soup was deliciously different for us.  I believe it was even better the next night re-heated.

Due to a dairy allergy I substituted the butter with some DF Earth Balance and the heavy cream with full-fat coconut milk and it was delicious.

Double the curry and use low fat sour cream in place of the cream... same volume or even a bit more .... it adds a slight tang and is delicious This recipe is a keeper!!!

I hesitated to make this soup looking at the ingredients but very glad I did.  Excellent-Yum-Awesome sums it up.  Increased the curry a little, used a whole tart apple and used light cream.  Leftovers reheat well.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks Lise for the recipe.

I actually made this soup vegan with a few substitutes for all my vegans out there!

I used vegan chicken stock, and some veggie stock, added a tiny spoon of tomato paste, also garlic, and smoked paprika.

I used vegan chicken, but you can go ahead and use chickpeas if you want this to be whole foods/ avoiding soy etc.

I also used half a tablespoon more of curry powder to spice her up.

Shocked that the apple worked well, used a Jazz apple!

Its absolutely delicious. At the end I used a bit of coconut milk for the "creamy" but you really dont need it... its that good!

This recipe was fantastic.  I did modify recipe( for dietary reasons ) and used olive oil to cook onions and carrots , instead of butter. I used milk instead of cream and added it right to the soup to simmer and  the recipe was still fantastic.

Delicious recipe.  I used only 1 tsp curry and no salt or heavy cream.  I did add a sprinkle of crushed red pepper.  The curry amount was perfect.  The soup thickened to a nice consistency (I only covered part of the time).

I will def make this again (and again). I can't eat carbs right now, so no rice, apple (sugar), flour. Instead I added one can of northern beans and extra carrots and celery (big chunks).  For dessert, I huge slice of chocolate cake (just kidding). This soup is a winner!

It seemed a bit bland, so I used 1 tablespoon curry and 1teas garam masala, I put in 1 teas thyme and an extra chicken bullion, extra garlic. I used half n half. It still seems to be missing something. I noticed that the mulligatawny soup at our favorite Indian restaurant adds lentils, so I might try that. Maybe substitute coconut milk for the cream. Maybe a little cayenne might kick it up. It has potential.

We really enjoyed this soup....the cream really added a lovely warmth to it.  I did end up adding a bit more broth after the rice was done, but other than that nothing was tweaked.  Delightful.

This is one of our “go to” soups. My entire family loves it!  To lighten it up even more, I use olive oil instead of butter and up the amount of veggies and red curry for extra flavor.  We rarely add cream and think it’s also delicious without.

Excellent soup.  Made it with the middle part of celery with leaves because that's all I had.  Used one chicken breast half and 1/2 royal gala apple.  Rich and delicious!

Exceptional Soup! I followed the recipe exactly and found it wonderful. I used Sweet Curry because th recipe didn't specify  I would not change a thing!

This Recipe was excellent. I made it exactly per the Recipe and found it to be fast/easy to prepare and the taste was well balanced and superb. I expect to double the serving next time because my wife and I enjoyed it so much and look forward to having more for leftovers. Thanks for the Recipe!

I used my left-overs of a roasted chicken (skin removed) for this recipe and it worked out really well.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

We like this soup but with a few changes. I use double the amount of veggies. Unsalted margarine instead of butter. Add the apples before the rice and chicken. We like it puréed, so when all is cooked I use the stick blender but leave a few veggies still whole. Then I add the pre cooked rice and if desired the chicken. The cream adds the final smoothness. Great base recipe!

Yum. Added more chicken, curry powder, and carrots, onions and celery than the recipe called for. Since husband is lactose intolerant, used olive oil instead of butter. Left out the cream but used an immersion blender to thicken the soup.

Fantastic recipe! I didn't have chicken so I used some leftover roast beef. I didn't have chicken broth so I used vegetable broth. I didnt have curry powder so I used cumin. I didn't have apples so I used pears. I didn't have rice so I used rice noodles.  I didnt have cream so I used Coffee-mate. Sooooo good!
Why do people insist on writing a review when they concoct something not even remotely similar to the original? If I wanted low/no fat I wouldnt be searching this in the first place!

I read through several reviews that recommended skipping the heavy cream so I consulted the family and they told me to add the cream.  It was delicious as is (extra calories and all). The recommendations I did regret not following were doubling or even tripling the recipe.  This said it was for 6 but unless I messed up somewhere, it barely fed 4.  Thanks!

Excellent. Used chicken carcass and chicken broth. No butter, no sautéing veggies, no flour, no cream. Chopped veggies, put all in crock pot for 8hrs slow. Added 2t curry, we like it spicy. Even threw in handfuls of spinach at the end. oh and used brown minute rice during the  last hr. Could add more chicken or more veggies if want. No salt was added either!

Delicious! I tripled the recipe, and I am glad I did. I followed the advice of some reviewers and used my immersion blender after cooking the vegetables and broth together.  After that, I added cooked shredded chicken and  shredded apple and cooked for 10 minutes or so. Last, I turned off the heart and added a can of coconut milk and a cup of cream. I omitted the rice and flour, but I think I will thicken the soup and serve the rest over rice tomorrow.

The good news is that my family loved it! It went super quick, even late at night, and will make a great post-gym lunch. 

The bad news is that I don't have it for a post-gym lunch because my family ate it. If you're not a fan of fatty stuff, this probably isn't so much for you! I did leave out the cream, and next time I may use less butter. But overall, this is fantastic!

Yum! This is an awesome. Play with the spices to your own taste. We saute in coconut oil, we add a little garam masala with the curry, no flour,  the whole apple, and we use cauliflower rice instead of rice, & coconut milk, (in the can, not the carton) in place of the heavy cream.  Thanks for the recipe!

Soup was delicious. Like many others, I increased the curry. Perfect. Didn’t use any pepper. It had enough kick for us. Next time I think I will add another apple to the pot. I used half and half instead of cream, and added it individually to each bowl based on preference for creaminess.

This was delicious and, as with most soups, was better the 2nd day. I incorporated some of the other suggestions - added the chicken with the broth, doubled the curry powder  and used coconut milk only. Yummy!!!

Fantastic soup.  I used 3 tablespoons of curry which gave the soup lots of flavor.  It took quite a long time to cook the rice in the soup.  Next time I will used cooked rice.

Made this in the pressure cooker and it turned out wonderfully.  Left out the flour as per cooker instructions, but added everything except the cream and cooked for 35 minutes.  Added the cream after cooking was complete.  So good.

Very tasty.  Our family has to go dairy-free because of our 1 yr. old who has allergies.  So I used a butter substitute and used coconut milk instead of cream.  I had extra veggies--mushrooms and cabbage--that I sautéed with the carrots, celery, and onion.  I used about 2 tsp. of curry powder based on other reviews.

I love this soup, so delicious! I made it as written. One of the newer reviewers mentioned not enough broth, she is right if you like a thinner soup. My husband and I like a thicker soup so it was perfect for us. Also another reviewer mentioned doubling it if you want more and that is correct also. It only made two and a half good servings. I will definitely make this again.

Love this soup.  I've ended up leaving out the apple for a more savoury, slightly "spicier" soup.  One of my cold weather "go-to" dishes.

This turned out quite good.  It’s very tasty on a cold winter evening. The only issue I had is that the broth is too little. I think the vegetables and chicken are enough but there was very little broth. Next time I plan on doubling the broth and adjusting the spices accordingly. I also used brown basmati rice instead of white rice because we don’t eat white rice. I also think the cream isn’t necessary as the soup tastes just as good without it-if that is someone’s preference.

definitely double  the recipe if you want more than 3 servings.    I used rotisserie chicken  and half and half, but would be good without the dairy.  also next time i will add more curry for even more flavor.

Just had 2 bowls. I followed the recipe except for the cream. I didn't have any. The soup was great. I made a double batch which I don't usually do until I've tried it.  My wife raved about it also. I will surely pass the rec. on to my daughters. A little more curry next time!
Yummy!

This soup was wonderful! Yes, I will definitely make it again. Didn’t have any cream so used Greek yogurt. Also we like hot, so I added andouille sausage, sliced and fried plus the chicken I had was rotisserie but it worked well. I use brown rice (dextrinized) and followed another reviewer by adding a tsp of garam masala, just cause I had some and hadn’t tried it yet. YUMMY, thanks so much for sharing.

The only changes I made were two: I deleted the rice and did what another reviewer did, which was substitute diced potatoes, and I used coconut milk in place of the heavy cream because of a dairy intolerance. Soup turned out fantastic!!!! Definitely a keeper! Thank you for sharing!

Super warm soup with curry filled goodness! I was a bit apprehensive about the apple but the sweetness just disappeared in the soup. I suggest doubling the curry to increase flavor. I used half and half instead of full cream, and olive oil instead of butter. I substituted cauliflower rice in lieu of regular rice to make this weight watcher friendly. 3 points a serving...what a deal!

DE-LISH!!! All three of my kids (ages 10-15) had seconds. It’s not even gone and my daughter is already asking down me ro make it again. I tripled the recipe and left out the flour since I’m going to take some to my friend who has Celiac. As a shortcut, instead of cooking chicken myself,  I used the meat from a store bought rotisserie chicken. Yum yum yum!!!

Great base recipe!  Needed to double the curry, add some garlic and a bit of smoked paprika for full flavor (I’m used to flavorful savory dishes).  I would season and cook the chicken with salt, pepper and garlic in a pan before adding it to the soup or it will be really bland when you bite into a piece of chicken even though the soup is flavorful.  It hit the spot for my craving!

Made it for my family and they all loved it. Mom said, “It was yummy!” Dad said, “It warms the tummy and the soul on a cold winter’s night.” Even my grumpy brother admitted, “Yeah, it’s good.” Used fat-free sour cream instead of heavy cream, which I would recommend to anyone interested in a lighter variation. A little cayenne powder added a kick, but did not hurt the flavor. Great recipe and we’re glad we tried it! Looking forward to the next time.

I am not a fan of reviews by people that change the recipe and try to rate it.  However, I made one change because my daughter has an allergy and still felt the need to review it.  My daughter is allergic to dairy so I used coconut milk instead of cream.  Oh my!  This soup was so good.  I doubled the recipe for my family of 4 and we ate almost all of it.  It was delicious.  I will definitely make it again.  I will try it with cream when she goes back to college, but it was amazing with the coconut milk too!

I did this in a slow cooker and I incorporated ideas suggested by others.  I used about 3 tsp. curry and about 2 tsp garam masala.  I also used a pinch or so of red pepper flakes.  I did not use rice because I didn't have any.  I might make it without rice again but I would increase the amount of veg.  For those on a low salt diet, I used no salt added chicken broth (70mg per cup) and unsalted butter.  I added about a 1/4 tsp salt and it was plenty of flavor.  Thanks for this lovely recipe.

I've made this recipe two times. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. The second time, I doubled the recipe and it wasn't quite as good. I'm sure that I messed up the proportions somewhere. I'll stick to the recipe when making this in the future.

Wow! This is our new favorite soup. It's so easy to make and really delicious. I made one small change to the recipe. We prefer using half and half instead of heavy cream, since we favor a lighter-textured soup. Perfection!

This soup was amazing! I would definitely double the recipe, though. I used basmati rice( because that’s what I had),and it turned out great. I followed the recipe exactly, but while I was eating it, I thought how easy it would be to convert this to vegetarian. Just leave out chicken, and use veggie stock. Bet it would still be just as awesome. Loved it!

This was pretty good.  I didn't have any carrots so I doubled the celery.  My only criticism is that the chicken within the soup was very bland.  But the soup was very flavorful and mostly made up for that.

I... LOVED this soup! 
It was my first time making it, so I followed the recipe as is, only added two extra carrots and a whole apple instead of half an apple. 

Imagine my surprise when I was stirring 5 minutes before the time was up and a lot of my rice was stuck to the bottom of the pan. I did not expect this soup to be so thick. 

I omitted the heavy cream (as they don't sell that here) and instead followed another AR-members advice and blended a cup of the soup and then stirred it back in and it was perfect!! 

The only side note to mention is that the recipe as is won't cover 6 people (at least not in my household ;). ) I only got three bowls out of it. 
But I'm not worried, next time I'll just double/triple the recipe. 

Amazing, will definitely become a new staple in my soup binder!

1. Added sliced mushrooms and roasted cauliflower to "up" the veggie game here.
2. Used twice the amount of curry for a much better, more robust flavor
3. Left out the heavy cream.... didn't need it. Instead, I put a bit of plain yogurt on top before serving
4. Left out the rice. Again, with all my veggies it didn't need this so I cut carbs.

This was a chicken rice soup on steroids. Flavor was so rich....there’s no way any virus would stand a chance with this soup on board! I used my food processor to mince celery, added extra carrots, used chicken thighs instead of breasts, and omitted the heavy cream all together. This soup will be my go to instead of chicken noodle.

I made a huge batch for freezing. Didn’t add the cream — it’s fab without it! Next time I’ll likely double the amount of curry.

Amazing! We added mushrooms and used coconut milk (lactose intolerant house) and it was still WONDERFUL.

This soup is AMAZING. Oh my. How did I not know about this soup before??? I added a full tablespoon of curry like some of the commenters said. I also added a bit of garlic salt and a few pinches of garam masala. But even if you just follow the recipe exactly I’m certain it would be absolutely fantastic.

I just made this, and it came out fantastic.  I used jasmine rice, because that's all I had on hand, but I would recommend another variety.  It's just too long and thing for soup.  For the apples I used Granny Smith, which worked out quite well.  

As others suggested I doubled the recipe so that I would have enough for lunch and an easy dinner later on in the week.  The flavor is great, and you could add some cayenne if you want a little bit of a kick.  I suggest that you make it as the recipe once as written and then modify it as needed.  I will definitely make this again.

This was really good. Toddler loved it too! I didn't add the cream, and used zucchini and carrots instead of onion and celery, and used 1 tbs of curry powder. Also used pre-cooked leftover rice (just simmered less time). It was great for the next few days as well. I'll definitely make it again.

This soup tastes incredible. One of my new favorites, seriously. Perfect for chilly days and cold season. I should have doubled the recipe though. If you’re planning on feeding more than 3 people or want leftovers (which according to the other reviews it’s even better the second time) I would definitely double the recipe. I upped the curry powder a bit, and because I’m an impatient cook, I didn’t wait half an hour for it to simmer before adding the rice and apples. I also cooked the chicken with the vegetables to save time. It was good even before adding cream, so don’t panic if you don’t have any. Also, milk, half and half, sour cream, they all work just as well. Overall I will definitely make again.

This soup is delicious!  I first made it the way it said in the recipe and my husband and I felt it needed a little more tweeking to our liking.  So, I added another chicken breast diced), 2-3  cloves minced garlic, 1 tsp. dried thyme and 1 cup heavy cream.   My husband loved this and he is not a big soup eater.  Thanks for sharing.

Made for my parents and it turned out excellent.  I used twice as much curry powder as the recipe called for and I also added a couple teaspoons of garam masala and some cumin for more of the exotic Indian flavor.  Additionally, I substituted coconut milk for the cream.   It turned out great, everyone ate as much as we could, and we will definitely be having it again.

As far as I'm concerned, this is fabulous.  I did add a tad more curry powder and cayenne (just a pinch) and left out the cream as I felt it wasn't necessary and we thought it was fantastic.  A meal all on it's own.

Unbelievably good. I used Penzey Curry powder and it made this dish flavorful and not too hot. My kids loved it and took it to school in their lunchboxes the next day. The meal is so complete you don’t need anything else, except maybe some pita bread to scoop up every last drop.

Best soup we’ve ever had! Our family isn’t exactly the type who cozy up to a bowl of soup when the weather is chilly (we like substance!) but this soup drowns your want for anything else out. I always have to double or triple the recipe as all my family, friends and co-workers request a bowl when they get wind I’ll be making it. I follow the recipe as it’s written except for I use half and half rather than heavy cream and use less than called for (it’s not really even needed in my opinion, but does add a creaminess that we enjoy). I completely agree with other reviewers that it gets better after sitting a day or two so I often make it ahead of when I’ll be serving it. Make this recipe, you won’t be sorry!!

Totally fantastic.  My family gobbled it up.  Tip: I doubled the recipe but my family of 5 just about finished it.  Also, I steamed fresh broccoli and we all just added it to the soup.  That was fantastic.  Next time I may make rice separately and people can dish it over the rice - cause my kids really love rice.  Next time I'll add more curry as we found it mild.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Oh my! Wow!  So amazingly delicious and so easy!  I get tired of the same old flavors and this soup is a super easy way to have something that is a little different and out of the typical, ordinary meal choices.   I followed the recipe with a few variations.  It was a little thick so I added just a little more chicken stock.   I made it ahead and therefore did not add the apple chunks.  I imagined them mushy when I reheated so I just omitted.  I also omitted the celery because I just don't care for the flavor.    I had every intention of adding the cream at the end but as I tasted, it was so delicious and the perfect consistency so I omitted the cream in the effort to save calories.   The recipe as is really only made enough for my husband and I.  When I make this again I will double the recipe.   You can't go wrong with this one if you like curry.

Great recipe! I substituted coconut oil and coconut milk for the butter and heavy cream.  I also put in sweet potato instead of rice, it was so good!! Even my picky 3 year old ate an entire bowl!!

What a wonderful soup.  The only change I made was to use coconut milk in stead of the heavy cream.  Perfect!  We love curry and this will be a great rotation in my fall & winter soups. Thanks

Amazing soup!  Since my chemo treatments, I haven't been able to handle anything spicy, so I just used a small sprinkling of curry powder.  It was still super delicious!  My husband said it's the best soup he's ever had!

Great recipe- I doubled curry and used half vegetable broth and half chicken broth.  Delicious base flavor you can add other vegetables too.  Will make again.

I loved this! I normally don't review if I alter the recipe, but it was so delicious, and I felt my alterations were minor. I doubled the recipe per other reviews, instead of rice, since my husband is diabetic, I used riced cauliflower (frozen section at Trader Joe's). We also omitted adding cream at the end to save a few calories. Delicious without cream. I'd double the apple next time. It really is a delicious soup and it's quick and easy to throw together.

Can substitute frothy 2% milk for heavy cream to decrease the amount of fat and cholesterol. Still tastes very good.

Holy cow.  I'm writing as I'm eating.  This soup is absolutely delicious.  I made no changes except a dash of garam masala, and I added a dollop of sour cream instead of the heavy cream before I devoured my first bowl.  On the second, I added no cream and it's still so so so so so so good!!  It's a true testament to my husband that I'm going to leave a serving for him without gobbling the whole thing up!  I doubled  the recipe but will at least quadruple it in future and freeze it!  Thank you so much for this fantastic recipe!!

I just made this and can't believe how delicious it is.  My husband and I keep eating it even before dinner.  Didn't change one thing knowingly; I thought I had frozen chicken breasts and when I went to cut it realized it was boneless thighs.  It was so fabulous and simple and quick. My first review after trying so many recipes here......that's how good it was!

Great soup! Made only a few changes. I added garlic cause - duh. I also added the chicken breast whole at the liquid step, poached it, then removed and shredded it partly cause I make all chicken soups like that and I just like it that way. Didn't have cream, but I did have a little half and half which was just fine. will for sure make this again, maybe even triple it!

Way better than I thought it was gonna be. Used brown rice and added at the very beginning with the flour. Added a zucchini that would have gone unused, great!

I used Thai jasmine rice instead of white.  Also, I added a two inch piece of fresh ginger when making the chicken broth.  I wouldn't consider it "pepper water" based on the amount of spice suggested in the recipe...I added a little extra curry powder and 1 1/2 tsp. ground black pepper.
I didn't add the creamer at the end either, so maybe next time I will try that.

Followed this recipe pretty closely. I made a few changes with adding Cayenne pepper for a little more kick and using a potato instead of apple. This soup was absolutely delicious. I'm not sure if the cream is completely necessary but it definitely made a rich hearty soup that was perfect for this cold rainy weather.

Made this soup this weekend and absolutely loved it!  It is so tasty.  I did double the curry and apple (3 tsp curry & 1 whole apple) and used half and half (because that's what I had in fridge).  I shredded the carrot and apple which made it really smooth and melt-in-your-mouth.  It is such a good recipe. Definitely a keeper.

What a nice change of pace for a chicken-based soup! I stayed fairly true to the recipe with one exception, using about half the butter as I just didn't think it was necessary. I used heavy cream but added it directly to the full pot of soup vs adding it to individual servings. When I make this again, I'll try using coconut milk instead of cream as another reviewer suggested. Want to see if this enhances the flavor. All in all, a very tasty soup!

Pretty easy meal to make. I didn't have celery or apples. I added two cloves of garlic to the onion and carrot mixture. I added 1/2 cup of rice instead of 1/4 to make it more filling. I added a tsp of applesauce since I was missing the apples (not the same I know). And I fried two chicken breasts in a tbsp. of extra virgin olive oil and then added to the soup. I added the heavy cream just to my bowl since my husband tries to eat healthy. My husband loved this, and we will make this again.

This soup is so simple, but so delicious! Tried it on a whim because I really wanted a curry-based soup, and I had leftover chicken. This will be a regular in my house for sure. I would like to try it with different types of apples. Used a mild type this time and didn't really taste it in the soup. Also used half and half and it tasted just right. I'm sure it would be more rich if I used heavy cream. Can't wait to make another batch!

I wasn't sure if this would have turned out good, but I am impressed! It's a sweet but not too sweet and savory soup. Me and my husband liked it. We used potatoes instead of rice, but will try brown rice next.

I made a lot (24 servings) based on what I had available.  Half chicken,  half pork chops for meat in cubes. Did not have celery or carrots,  used 2 lbs potatoes and full bunch of garlic. Doubled the curry powder, added ground cloves, and sage. Instead of cream I had powdered milk, added that to make a cream consistency. Doubled  rice for thicker soup. Since there is sufficient leftovers I'll add carrots and celery to keep stretching the soup on next reheat.

I made this stew almost as written, except that I used brown rice instead of white rice and did not heat the cream. We loved it! It was hot and hearty for a cold, rainy day.

I will definitely make it again.

I'd give it a 10 but I can only give it a 5, the only thing I changed was I used chicken thighs instead of breast

It was good, but not amazing.  I would probably make again, but just to add some variety to our meals, not because I would be craving it.  Maybe I used the wrong curry spice or something.  Just didn't have much flavor, like the ones I've had at restaurants.

Yum!  Try before adding cream (delish without!). I cut up 3/4 of a rotisserie chicken and doubled the recipe but used 2T curry (perfect amount for me) and I was surprised to realize I couldn't taste the individual apple pieces (cut to max 1/3" size). Also only used 3T total butter. Didn't add extra salt - enough in the stock. Ty!

I made the recipe exactly as written, and it was fantastic! It tasted authentic and perfectly like the 1st time I ever had it! Myself former boss, Raj, used to make this soup for me, at his restaurant, where I worked. It was a treat for me then, and now I can make it myself, anytime I want. Yeah! ??????

My mother in law makes this all the time and told me where to find the recipe because everyone loves it so much! (After having this soup at least 20 times over the years, my suggestion would be: IF YOU ARE MAKING THIS SOUP FOR THE FIRST TIME OR EVEN MULTIPLE TIMES, YOU NEED TO TRY IT AT LEAST ONCE THE ORIGINAL WAY IT WAS WRITTEN!) Seriously it's so good the way it was supposed to be. I make it just like she does. She doubles the recipe and then adds a little extra carrots, celery, and onion, a little extra chicken, a whole apple instead of half, double the curry powder and add almost double the cream. I would recommend not leaving out the cream, it's a huge part of what makes it so yummy! We serve it with French bread to dip in the soup. So good.

We all loved it. Changes: I used brown rice that I partially cooked ahead of time instead of the white rice. Also, I used some bouillon and water for part of the broth. Otherwise, I pretty much followed the recipe. I made a double recipe for 8 of us and it was barely enough. I'll make a bigger batch next time. It's a keeper!

Loved this soup! Definitely better the second day. Followed the recipe pretty much as written but doubled it. Added more curry and cayenne because we like it a little spicier. I did add the warm cream with the first bowl but it was just as good without so didn't bother with it the next day.

I made this soup for the first time tonight and OMG! I'm so glad I doubled the recipe like everyone else said to do. I can't believe how amazing this soup tastes. I followed the recipe as is except omitting the cream and I added a little more curry and flour. This is definitely a keeper! Thank you for sharing.

Didn't make a single change to it.  I loved it.  Good soup is one of my favorite comfort foods.  This will be in the rotation.  My husband who prefers more traditional soups even liked it!

Very good! I had a little sample, but I know it will be much better after it stands for a bit. I grated both the carrot and apple, and it helped to give the soup a little thickness. I also added a little extra curry powder, some cayenne, a few tsps of crushed garlic and skipped the rice. It doesn't even seem like it needs any cream, which most reviewers mentioned, and I agree. It's also the perfect amount of soup for one person and to have some leftover, as I saw mentioned in a review. I have some chopped spinach that I might try adding. I look forward to having a bowl of this later!

Wow! This was delicious.  Stayed pretty true to the recipe, but here are a couple of  suggestions.  

Double the recipe, it's delicious.  Double the rice in the recipe.  Cut up all ingredients into the smaller than spoon size bites.   Use chicken stock instead of chicken broth. Use uncooked chicken  cut into small bites and add it with the  stock .   Double the simmer time before adding the rice.  

None of these tips are dealbreaker's. This is a wonderful recipe.

I only give it 4 stars because I made changes from the original recipe based on others' comments but, with those changes, it was 5 stars for my family. My picky kids all loved it. That never happens.  My changes- lite coconut milk instead of cream, 1 tsp of garam masala, 2 tsp of red curry paste and basmati rice instead of white rice. I made homemade stock and put in about 1 TB Better Than Bullion chicken stock for a kick. I'm really happy I found this recipe.

Unbelievable!  A new favorite go to chicken soup recipe.  I took the advice from the other reviews and used 2% milk instead of the cream.  Rave reviews from my guests and husband.  Have made twice in two weeks and will make regularly in the future. Healthy and amazing flavor.

Good recipe. I changed a few things instead of butter for sautéing I used coconut oil. Added nutritional yeast and 1tbsp of flax seed mixed with coconut flour and brown jasmine rice! added more curry because we like the taste a lot and I I used my own chicken broth. Great soup!

This soup needed a bit more kick. I added a little bit of cayenne pepper. Next time I'll add a little more. I added the cream to the whole pot before serving. Next time I will double the recipe so we have leftovers.

Delicious every time!  I used a little more apple and a bit more curry this last time I made it and we really liked it.  I take the lazy route on the carrots and just use the pre-packaged shredded carrots... works great!

I made this recipe for friends on Sunday night. I increased the all recipe ingredients to be 9 servings instead of 6. Everyone absolutely loved it. By increasing the recipe it was just enough for 6. Next time I'll double the recipe so we have some leftovers. We wouldn't change anything. Five out of five stars. Thanks for this recipe!!

This soup was fantastic! I am not a big curry fan but it had just the right balance of ingredients. I doubled the recipe and my family ate all of it! Definitely a keeper.

I will join the group of those that LOVE this recipe.

We made a few changes.  Here's what we did:
1.) Doubled the curry powder.  We LOVE curry.
2.) Added 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper.  My husband likes his food a bit spicy.
3.) We didn't have celery, so I just added more carrot and onion to make up the difference.
4.) Subbed 2% milk for cream, and added it with 2-3 minutes instead of heating it separately.  We didn't notice a difference, but it did thicken the soup a bit.

Next time we're going to try:
1.) Cooking the rice separately.  We live at high altitude, and cooking brown rice IN things takes FOREVER.  The soup was boiling away, and the rice was still al dente after about 30 minutes.  We'll add  cooked rice maybe 10-15 minutes towards the end to prevent mushy, but still allow it absorb flavor.
2.) Doubling the recipe.  This did not make any leftovers for us!
3.) Listening to other reviewers, we'll sub some of the butter with olive oil.  We want butter flavor, but it wouldn't hurt to cut down the unhealthy fat a bit with a healthy fat.

Definitely a repeat dish, and added to our constant repertoire!

I love this soup.  Made it exactly as written the first time.  Second time, I doubled the recipe, doubled the curry powder and added cilantro.  I use rotisserie chicken.  This is one of my favorite soups and very simple to make.  Thanks

Sooooooooo good!!! This was my first time making the soup... could not have been better. I combined the recipe with some suggestions that I saw from fellow-chef's comments... namely using potatoes, increasing curry to 2, adding cayenne pepper (if you like a little heat) and modifying the cream (using a lesser amount). I wish I'd made more ??

I've made this soup twice. Second time I made the following adjustments - no cream, coconut oil instead of butter, added 1 tsp of turmeric,  skipped the chicken, and used my Instapot. Sautéed the veggies, and then with all ingredients in, used the soup setting on the cooker.  Delish!

Wow!  Double wow!  Made it for the first time tonight.  Whole family loved it!  It was my 11 year old son who suggested I make it since he'd liked a mulligatawny soup we'd had at a local Indian restaurant.  This wasn't like the one we'd had there but this was delicious in its own way.  And it was a bit more like a stew then a soup so if I want to make it more soupy, next time I'll add more broth.  I think the only other change would be that I would maybe add more salt but as I'm trying to follow a low-sodium diet, maybe I wouldn't--that's just personal preference.  There wasn't any soup left when dinner was over!  Even the dog liked it!  We found her  licking a soup spoon when the dishwasher was left open, LOL!

Super good soup!  Almost made it exactly as described, but needed to use up butternut squash, so added that also. Also added more curry powder for a better taste sensation. And only added 1/4 cup cream vs full amount as it was quite creamy once cooked. Delicious!

Wow, this was a wonderful surprise. What a warm, hearty, thick soup. I followed the recipe exact. Tastes good even without the cream if you want to cut some calories. If you like a hint of curry, this is a keeper for sure.

I made this recipe "as written" the first time. It was fantastic! The only tweaking I did, subsequently, was to substitute 1% milk for the cream and added a small amount of sugar,

i want to stress these were just personal adjustments and I loved it  .just the way it it was offered.

So I decided to follow the recipe exactly and found so errors in it. I tried the soup before added the heavy cream and it tastes simply like a weak chicken soup. It desperately needed another element to create some complexity so I added the suggested amount of cream. Unfortunately it made the soup so heavy it became unpleasant to eat more than a few bites. I think to make the soup in a way I would like I would have to so alter the recipe that it wouldn't be the same soup at all

After the reviews I doubled the recipe the first time I made it.  I'm glad I did.  The only other change I made was to double the curry.  This is an easy and delicious soup.  If you're not familiar with curry, use the original recipe, but in my opinion the more the better.  It's delicious.

So glad to have found this recipe and we thought it was very tasty but I think of the recipe as a baseline. We added more spices, more veggies, more chicken, broth... you get the idea. Very much a good experience

This stew is delicious, tasty, healthy and light! The cream added at the end really enhanced it. Was unsure the chopped apple, but it really came together in terms of flavors. I plan to serve it as a start at my next dinner party.

This soup was quite good even my "meat and potatoes" family liked the curry, which really surprised me. I personally thought it was a little bland so I ended up adding extra salt and pepper. Next time I'll play around with the spices a little. I also added twice as much rice and used a multi-grain blend. Before serving I thickened with corn starch. I'll make this again.

I made this a week ago for a soup exchange/party, and my family was so jealous that I'm making it again tonight! The only change I had was no apples, because we didn't have any. But this is definitely going to become one of our standard soups!!!!!

Love this soup... we've made it serveral times and it's always delicious.  Tonight I realized I had everything but an apple and an onion... I substituted a sweet potato and garlic and I think it might turn out even better ??. Also I'm using coconut oil instead of butter, plain yogurt in place of cream and doubling the rice.

This is awesome soup. I used leftov r turkey rath r than chicken.   I also substituted a can of coconut milk for the cream and doubled the curry powder.  This is definitely a repeat recipe.  Delicious.

This soup is amazing. It's become a new staple for us. My fiancé and I love spicy food (probably more than the average person), so we kicked this up a notch: 2 TBSP curry powder, 1/4 - 1/2 tsp cayenne,  &  1/4 - 1/2 tsp chilli flakes. I also poached my chicken breast with the celery tops, carrot ends, onion discards, a habanero (whole) from my garden & and a little salt & pepper. This allowed me to shred my chicken (which made the flavours of the soup really penetrate the chicken) and provided an amazing stock to use in the soup!!  Like others, I highly recommend doubling or even tripling this recipe when you make it. Also, I don't think it needs the cream at all. I added about a cup of milk at the end to change the colour, add a bit more to the broth and add a slightly creamier texture (next time i'm going to try the coconut milk as recommended by others, because I think that sounds amazing) but again, you can make this totally dairy free and it's delicious. I also added extra apple (recipe calls for a half but I put the whole thing in), and my fiancé didn't even know there was apple in it! But it adds a lovely sweetness that I think the soup benefits from.   Overall we LOVED it. Such a great soup to clear out the sinuses and soothe a sore throat if you're feeling under the weather!

My family loved it!  I tripled the recipe somewhat. A whole stick of butter. A whole yellow onion, 5 celery stalks, 2 handfuls of baby carrots chopped, 1 tsp kosher salt, 1/4 tsp black pepper, 3 tbsp curry powder (my preference) 3 tbsp flour and 3 quarts of chicken stalk and a large pinch of the Thyme. I also used the breasts off a Sam's club rotisserie chicken for ease and 1cup of uncooked basmati rice. Brought to a boil, turned it down to a simmer for 20 minutes and checked. It was perfect. No need for cream at all.

This meal is absolutely amazing.  Instead of butter i substituted olive oil and instead of heavy cream, use coconut milk.  It then turns into a fat burning soup and it is better than this recipe!!!!

Excellente! Doubled the recipe first time owing to comments, except for the curry, which I will next time, but was being careful. I the freeze the leftovers for quick lunches so we'll see if it's even better. Served with sour cream, chopped green onions and dinner rolls. Yeeesss!

Great soup!  I did sub olive oil for butter & used just enough to sauté the vegetables, used brown rice instead of white & sour cream with severing instead of cream....all personal preferences.

My husband made this soup for us tonight.  I asked him if we could re-new our vows.  AWESOME!  We were out of celery and used 1/5 of a package of S&B golden curry sauce mix instead of curry powder.  So yummy! 11/16/18 Still a favorite.  Today we put 1/2 the veggies and broth in the blender and added it back into the soup with a small can of coconut cream after taking it off the stove.   SO dang yummy.

This stuff is awesome and super easy.  My family and I felt as if a 1/4 cup of rice wasn't quite enough, so I doubled it to a half cup and it was perfect.

First time I've tried this type of soup and I loved it.  Will be making this recipe again. I tried it first without cream and it was delicious, made it again with cream also delicious, tastes more like a curry with the cream, without its more of a hearty curry flavored soup, I like both and may prefer it without, both worth trying though. The second time I  chopped the apples into big pieces rather than dicing as I did the first time, and I agree with another reviewer, that the texture of soft apple chunks isn't desirable and I will finely dice them next time.  I also added a bit of hot pepper (Carolina Reaper flakes and dried Arbol chiles)  to spice it up, and some turmeric.  I made twice as much the second time and will do that in the future too and freeze some for lunches. Very energizing wholesome food. Glad I found this recipe.

This soup was fantastic! I made it exactly as directed except I forgot to add the cream at the end. I can't imagine it being any better than it is, but I'm definitely going to add the cream next time. My husband usually eats like a wolf and has no idea what he just ate. Not so with this soup. He kept saying "Wow! This is amazing!" The two of us ate all 6 servings in one sitting. Next time I'm doubling the recipe.

Great soup!  I increased the Curry to 2 tsp, based on the other reviews.  Otherwise, I kept everything the same.  I agree with the comments, of increasing the batch to make more.

Made this thick and yummy soup as written.  Thought we'd have it for dinner, but we had a bowl for lunch and it was so good my husband invited his buddy in for some, too.  He wanted his wife to come over to try it.  Needless to say, there's enough for a "cup of soup and sandwich" tomorrow, but not enough for dinner tonight.  Next time I'll double the recipe.  This one probably gets even better the next day if you can manage to save some.

I like mine garnished with raisins and shredded coconut.  Hubs likes his as is.  Scrumptious!

BTW, the full fat version is awesome.

One of my new fav soups.  This soup shows up in several historical fiction book series that I have read and it always sounds so good. So, one rainy weekend I decided to give it a try. I loved it.  Made exactly as is and wouldnt change a thing.

We love anything with curry powder in it so I gave this a try. We weren't disappointed at all. I'm a fan of "Better Than Bouillon" so I use that anytime stock or broth is called for. I also used a whole grated Apple and Jasmine rice as others have suggested and a pinch of ground mace. This recipe is quick and easy. 
Thank You for sharing.

Tasty, hearty and easy to make. Next time I will try it with less butter as I ended up skimming it off the top after refrigerating the soup. I didn't add the cream as it wasn't needed. This soup has a lovely fragrance.

Very, very yummy!  I served the warm cream on the side and my kids chose not to use it.  It was very buttery, so next time I will just use a little olive oil instead of butter.  I also shredded the apple as suggested by another, since my kids would've objected to chunks of soft apple!  The apple really did melt into the soup.  The little bit of flour makes the broth a nice consistency.  Next time I might add extra rice - definitely worth the try!

Insanely delicious! I accidentally put way more curry powder than the recipe called for (I thought it said tablespoons) but I am glad I did. I also added lots of cayenne pepper for spice, but that is personal preference. This is such a stellar recipe. Yum!

Love, love, love this recipe! My husband is also a huge fan. He asks for it at least once a week. It's in our weekly rotation now. Perfect for fall and winter and easy to make. It's also great for leftovers. Just as good after a few days in the fridge as it is when freshly made.

I made this almost exactly according to recipe, but I did take others' advice and use a little more curry, brown rice instead of white and added a pinch of crush red pepper. It was FANTASTIC.  My husband, who doesn't generally like to stray from mainstream dishes, gave this a two thumbs up. Plus my kitchen held the yummy smell of curry for hours!

I will definitely make this again but next time I will DOUBLE the recipe to make sure I have some left overs. As it's written it doesn't even make a half pot.

The is a great soup when you want something different from the usual.  A few tips for my family, I added four times the amount of curry and thyme because I added three chicken breasts, a whole apple, and one and a half times the chicken broth to make it a little heartier.  Fantastic recipe!  Thank you!

Delicious! This soup surpassed my expectations! It's so tasty and good for you, too. As another reviewer suggested, I deboned a rotisserie chicken, instead of cooking chicken breasts. I doubled the recipe and added all of the chicken meat. I took the chicken carcass and simmered with 2 quarts of water, 1 T. chicken soup base (less salty than bullion), and a bay leaf. While that simmered, I sautéed the veggies, adding a chopped red bell pepper for added flavor and color. I drained the chicken carcass, reserving the liquid, which was so flavorful. I added this to the sautéed veggies, curry and flour mixture, then added the rice and seasonings, adding a roasted garlic & red bell pepper spice blend by The Gourmet Collection. I toasted a piece of sourdough bread and had a hearty meal. I didn't add any additional salt as the chicken was seasoned and this was enough salt for me. This would be a great soup for a crowd. I think I'll make it for Christmas Eve.

I didn't think I was going to think much of this (I made it for FIL) but I loved it. DH and six year old son love it too!  Winner. I'll be making it again for sure. Thanks!

I was a little concerned about my family liking this because my wife said she didn't like curry.  Well that was before this soup.  First I recommend you double the recipe.  I had enough to feed four, but no leftovers. I stayed close to the recipe, but got a little heavy handed with the thyme.  I also added a teaspoon of minced ginger. This is definitely an easy recipe to prepare, and crowd pleasing, and I had most of the ingredients on hand.  That's why I'm giving this a 5.

OMG! So good! All 6 kids (ages 15-2), hubby and uncle loved it! I doubled (almost tripled it) and served it with naan. The only change I made was to add 1 cup of leftover mashed potatoes. I wasn't sure it was going to be enough for all 9 of us!

I just made this for the second time. It's a really delicious soup. This time I shredded the apple, as the last time it was odd chewing small chunks of apple. I made lots more than the recipe called for so I can have plenty of leftovers. I used half and half instead of heavy cream. Next time,  i will add some fresh garlic. I used more curry powder than what it called for. Tasted it along the way to make sure it tasted okay. Thank you for this recipe! Yum!

This is my family's favorite soup, I've been making it for 3+ years.  It's on our weekly dinner menu. I always double the recipe and add a little more rice than it calls for. Thanks for such a great recipe!!!

Love, love, love this soup. Have been looking for a Mulligatawny Soup recipe for awhile and even though it's summer and hot out, I was craving homemade soup. I had not had Mulligatawny soup in years and found this recipe on here. Am I ever glad I did, it's amazing. The only thing I did different is I added celery salt as I did not have any fresh celery, and I added some diced sweet orange peppers which I had on hand and Basmati Rice. It's just soooo good, next time I will definitely double the recipe.

It was delicious I added a little more curry powder and some paprika to taste. But it was definitely something different than I'd normally make, but worth making and trying!

Delicious. Doubled the recipe right off the bat and wasn't disappointed. Doubled the curry as suggested, and added a pinch of cayenne, red pepper flakes, and nutmeg. So creamy and flavorful and not terribly complicated. Grated the apple as suggested by another reviewer and was please with the consistency it made the broth. Will make again for sure.

This was exquisite!  My husband requested this soup after hearing about it on the Soup Nazi episode of Seinfeld, so I thought I'd give it a try.  This soup brings comforting chicken and rice to another level!   Excellent flavors, but simple to make.

I doubled the recipe for my family.  We are vegetarian, so made a couple changes.  I used Rapunzel vegetable bullion cubes in place of chicken broth, and cubed Quorn chick'n in place of chicken breasts.  I also doubled the curry.   I think I could have halved the cream or used half and half and the soup would have still tasted rich.  Next time I'm going to try using wild rice instead of white, and I think it may be good with a bit of garam masala in addition to the curry.  I'll also try a batch using coconut milk when I'm looking to shake things up.

The only thing I changed was brown rice and it was fantastic. I've made it several times, always good! I would highly recommend.  Note it doesn't make that much so I would double or triple the recipe.

This recipe is a winner! I skipped the rice and went with what I had. I used ground turkey and a whole apple since I didn't have carrots or celery. I also added some garlic powder. Very easy and economical. Most importantly, though, it's really delicious!

I added garlic (3 cloves minced) to the onion, celery, carrot mixture on the advice of other reviewers.  I used half-n-half instead of heavy cream.  Also, I pan seared and then slow cooked the chicken (marinated in lemon and garlic), added it at the very end when the rice was done.  It's a good weekday recipe, because it is pretty simple to prepare, but has complex flavors.

Really good only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 is because I have made this before with a different recipe I found on Allrecipes which I liked better only cause it was a thicker soup and a little spicier which I like but not complaining this was a great recipe and very delicious!

An EXCELLENT soup for a quick meal! I have a meat-and-potatoes kind of husband, but he LOVED this recipe. A few alterations (due to a lack of ingredients) were 1) instead of using an apple, I added about 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce (but you might have to up the salt content of your soup per your own taste preference), and 2) I used whole milk in place of heavy cream. I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone!!!

I've made this soup multiple time ... usually a double batch and sometimes a triple.  I like it with more carrots, more celery and about 1/3 more rice.  It thickens up nicely.  Excellent soup.

I made it and loved it!!  Quadrupled the recipe the second time I made it and reduced the amount of butter.  I also omitted the heavy cream and just use a dollop of greek yogurt in the individual bowls before eating.  Delicious!!

Delicious! I didn't use the cream, and I thought it didn't really need it. Not really crazy about the texture of the apple. Next time I'll try grating it, like a few others have suggested.

Love, love, love.
The only thing I changed is adding more curry.  In my opinion, there is never enough curry. :)
When I made this for a family gathering everyone asked for the recipe.

I made this exactly as directed and I will make it again. I used less cream than the recipe called for but I do think the cream is necessary. I might try it with half-n-half next time as some suggested.

I followed the recipe  but was not sure if the chicken should cook raw  in the soup but it did fine, I think half and half would have been a healthier choice but I used cream anyway, also I think more rice should have been added, next time I will use some  brown basamati rice. I used  twice as much hot curry, I am very pleased with the taste of the soup but adding more chicken next time. I think also I will use half olive oil to cut down on the butter.

This soup was outstanding.  Only substitution I made was Half&Half for the cream, as we have it on hand all the time.  Absolutely delicious.  I will definitely be making this again, soon I hope.

Holy cow, this soup is delicious!! I doubled the recipe and followed it exactly except for using less butter (2 tbsp), 4 tsp of curry, and leaving out the heavy cream.
This stuff smelled so good while it was cooking, I could hardly wait for it to finish. I didn't even mind burning my tongue a little to get the first taste :) I will make this again and again!

Absolutely delicious!!! I used more onion, a whole Granny Smith Apple, 2 Tbsp curry, and 2 cups cooked chicken chunks. My husband added a  little cayenne pepper to his to add more kick. I'll probably add some grated hot pepper or cayenne next time I make it.

Yum! This is so good. Very comforting and easy to make. It's a nice twist on a traditional chicken and rice soup. Its not spicy at all, so we add spice to ours and a little bit of Garlic. Great Recipe!

Delicious exactly as written.  Regarding size of ingredients:  I like to cut or shred the chicken into very small pieces; if the chicken pieces are too big they taste flavorless.  Also I prefer to use food processor to cut the carrot & celery into very small pieces, to make the soup thicker and easier to spoon (and to avoid children's complaints about veggies in their soup).  I add way more curry than the recipe calls for, but my curry is from the regular grocery store, and is flavorful but not at all hot.

The recipe is VERY easy to follow.  My husband asked me what was the hardest thing I had to do - I told him absolutely nothing was difficult - however, preparing it takes a bit of time because of the many ingredients.  Seriously, this could be done by a beginner.
The taste was THE BEST!!

I have been making this soup on a regular basis for quite a while.  It is absolutely delicious.  I saute veggies in a little butter and olive oil but don't add any flour or cream as it keeps the calories down and the flavor and texture are still excellent.  I add more curry powder as we like spicy!  Also, I only simmer for about 15 minutes before adding chicken etc as I find that is long enough.  Very, very good!

Added extra carrots and used 1tbsp. Curry and Granny Smith Apple.  When cooked, I shut off gas and stirred in 1/2 cup half and half.  Delicious.  Next time will double recipe!

This hearty soup is just the thing for a cold winter evening!  Many flavors, but all come together so nothing overwhelms.  I doubled the recipe, and because I had plenty of apples, I used a little extra - 1 1/2 apples instead of just one for a double batch.  My fiancé loved it, and said that I should definitely make it again, without changing a thing.

Love this soup!  Very fast and easy.  I also add a smidge of cayenne pepper, but I really like spicy soup.  And I grate the apple because I HATE chunks of cooked apple, but it adds a lot of flavor.  So good, kids ate it on the first try!

I ditched the butter and used 1 tblsp canola oil. Increased the carrots to three and added some chopped kale for added nutrition and color. Added a couple of pinches of hot pepper flakes. The heat all depends on what kind of curry powder you use; mine was mild and I like it a bit more spicy. Used half and half plus a little milk. Served it with chopped leaf coriander on the top and a small teaspoon of light sour cream per serving. Good but the recipe as is has way too much  fat in it for me.

This was so easy and so delicious!  The leftovers were even amazing cold.  I never added the cream and frankly, I didn't miss it!   I will make this again and again - a great way to use up apples before the go bad because the rest of the ingredients I just about always have handy.  I doubled this recipe and was glad I did because it went fast!

Absolutely excellent. However, you need to double the recipe size for a proper pot of soup and also I used red curry paste and yellow curry powder and doubled that as well. Awesome

I've made this twice and we ALL LOVE IT!! The first time I cooked the rice separately, and tonight I cooked the rice in the soup.  I'm not sure I noticed a difference, so will keep to cooking it in so reduce a step. Both times I doubled the recipe, used a generous measure of curry powder and used coconut milk. Next time I'll read other reviews about how to reduce the fat as there are beads of oil that float to the top. Delish recipe.

Based on the reviews I tried this recipe. I made it as written as always or I won't publish a review.  Wow was it good! The family devoured it along with a grilled cheese sandwich. Although I am not a huge curry fan I loved it.

First tried this soup at a previous job and when I found this recipe I was so excited ! I read comments before I made I also just opt out on the heavy cream all together , used 1 whole apple and just cooked rice separately and added it in the end ! I am very satisfied and so is my 4 year old !

Delicious. Instead of the chicken breast I used a whole chicken that I put into the slow cooker with water to get me the broth and chicken.

Second time making this soup. I added a whole onion, whole apple and 1 cup of the cream so nothing wasted. It made the soup very sweet, a nice surprise.

I followed the directions for the first time on a recipe, as I'm unfamiliar with making Indian food; in the end, the soup turned out delicious, and though I have never had mulligatawny anywhere else, I will proudly declare this is the best I've ever had. :)

This is the most unique, amazing recipe I have tried from Allrecipes. I use rotisserie chicken from the store and follow the instructions except maybe a touch more curry. Enough said, Wow... just try it.

Absolutely amazing soup! Straight out of Seinfeld. I used a little less butter, cut the cream entirely and diced the apple into very small chunks, but it was still fantastic. Yes, some of the ingredients (Apple) seem strange on the surface. Just make it, then make more.

I have been making this recipe for years and everyone loves it. Been asked how to make it repeatedly. I usually double the curry powder and half the butter  to make it to my taste but it is fantastic  just as written here.

Got this recipe from Orenco Station Grill in Hillsboro Oregon.  It is the best ever!  I use precooked brown rice, added at the end to add a healthier option.  I sometimes use evaporated milk for the cream also, though cream is always the best taste.

Made it according to the written recipe and it was fabulous. Guests thought it was wonderful and all four of my children as well! My 14 year old daughter made a second double batch a few days later and everyone was excited to have it again. Will be making it often, I think.

This is delicious!  I doubled the curry, based on reviews, and I'm glad I did.  The end flavor was rich and lightly peppery, without being overwhelming or spicy. If I'd used what the recipe called for, I think it would be too bland.  Also, someone ate the apple I'd put aside for the soup, so I ended up using pineapple fruit preserve as the closest substitute - it was great, just a mild, bright sweetness as I imagine the apple was meant to contribute.

Absolutely wonderful soup!!!  However, I added more rice (2/3 cup Basmati), a small diced red potato, and I used Coconut Milk/Heavy Cream equally. Next time, may just use Coconut Milk (full fat). Delicious!!!

Very good tasting lite curry dish. You could thicken by using rice versus the dumplings I used as a substitute.

The hubby said this is the best soup I've ever made. I doubled the recipe and we ate all of it over three days. I used 4 tbsp of coconut oil instead of butter and one can of coconut milk instead of cream. I also shredded the apple and used one whole cooked rotisserie chicken. And it's great that it's all in one pot. Makes clean up so much easier! This will be in the regular rotation from now on!

Super yummy!  I make a little extra and throw in some additional veggies to use up what I have in the fridge.  I also use another reviewer's suggestion and shred the apple instead of chopping and usually double the curry because I love it!  This is also excellent with coconut cream instead of heavy cream.  This is a frequently repeated recipe!

Our family has made this recipe for years; it  is a lovely soup and comes from  Joy of Cooking (an old version from late 70's/early 80's the newer one has a different one that's more complicated and not as good).  

Tips:  Use light coconut milk instead of heavy cream--really helps the taste and reduces calories.  Butter can be cut in half.  The apple should be on the tart side.  I use 2 t of (sweet) curry called for in the original recipe and it does not overpower-- try the 1.5 t and decide what best matches your tastes.  Also, the  Joy of Cooking recipe calls for cooked rice - it is not specified here. White rice could probably be added raw and it will cook but I prefer brown so I add cooked brown rice.  I also add extra carrot just because I like it that way.  

Taste is great and agree with other reviewers that it gets even better after a day or so.  One of our favorite and easiest soup recipes.

Very disappointed in this recipe. I'm relatively new to this website and cook only a few dishes (but do those well). This was not hearty, way to thin, and not well mixed. I skipped the butter for olive oil and the cream / yogurt / milk altogether.

Delicious! Although, as some other reviewers recommended, I increased the curry to 2 teaspoons. I also added one more chicken breast. I will definitely make this easy recipe again.

Most of the family loved it! My daughter thought it was too spicy, but my wife, son and I loved it. Made it with a few changes, but I am sure this is excellent as written. Changes I made were that I doubled the recipe and doubled the rice used because 1/2 cup didn't seem enough. I used about 1/2 Tbsp Yellow Curry, about 1 Tbsp Garam Masala, about 1/2 Tbsp Red Curry and about a teaspoon of Tumeric. Will definitely make again, but I will not make my change of doubling the rice next time.

Loved it!  I used 2 tsp curry powder, 1 tsp coriander, 1/4 cayenne pepper, 1/4 mustard seed.  I left out the cream entirely just using chicken broth.  I added a dollop of nonfat plain greek yogurt in each serving and it was the BOMB, thanks for the great recipe!

Only change I make is 1tbls of hot curry. My favorite soup period, for those who say ommit the heavy whipping cream for less calories are INSANE. While good without it, i would drive an hour roundtrip if I did not have the whipping cream. It's the icing on the cake!

This is my favorite soup. I do double up on the veggies and curry and cut the cream in half.  I also use EVOO instead of butter, but I splurge once in a while :) and use the real deal! I also sub a dollop of plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream to finish.  This soup gets better so even though you will want to eat it right away let it stand  a day or two and you will be amazed on how delicious it becomes!

Call me crazy but I eliminated the curry.  This was amazing and loved by all, several asked for the recipe.  I personally like the protein combo of 1/2 bulk sausage and 1/2 chicken (6oz each) which admittedly makes it less healthy but wildly flavorful. We doubled all the veggies and rice to create a very hearty and very flavorful soup.  As mentioned, I eliminated the curry completely along with the cream to save a few calories.  Also tripled the thyme.  Amazing hearty soup for the whole family.  Flavor does develop and next day really is as good if not better.  This has a long future for our family.

I made this for company without trying it first due to the nearly unanimous 5-star rating and was not disappointed. Everyone loved it! After reading the comments, I doubled the curry powder and used half and half with great results. Also, after I added the rice and apples, I transferred it to a crock pot and kept in on low for a couple of hours, which worked fine. This will definitely be in heavy rotation at our house. Thanks!

This recipe is amazing. I didn't change that much because it didn't need it. The changes I made were minor and in no way compromised this dish. I used wild rice instead of white rice and half and half instead of cream. The minute you start adding other ingredients and eliminating others,it no longer becomes Mulligatawny Soup. This a favorite for my family!

Absolutely delicious!  Doubled recipe, my half and half was sour, so I skipped it and it was delicious without cream.  I did take some soup and puree it and add it back to thicken.  Added a few extra mushrooms and spinach.  Used half brown and half white rice.  Next time, I would increase the veggie to chicken ratio.  Husband loved it too!

Outstanding.  Of course it tastes better with homemade chicken broth.  I also used two apples and added reduced fat coconut milk instead of cream.  Tastes even better the next day.

This soup was absolutely delicious! Don't let the picture deter you from trying it...it did not look particularly appetizing to me; however, I will be making this again! Perfect for the workweek or for dinner at home! Give it a try--you won't be disappointed!

Amazing!!! Doubled the curry amount & used a can of evap milk at the end when I realized we were out of milk. Doubled it after reading reviews, you might even want to triple it, it's that good.

Omg! In anticipation of a busy day tomorrow, I made this soup this evening with the idea of heating it up for the fam tomorrow.  I was just going to have a taste and ended up eating half of it! Not sure it's going to be around for dinner tomorrow! Doubled the curry and apple. Did not add salt. Added uncooked chicken breast with broth.  Only issue was that I added brown rice late in the game and couldn't wait around for it to cook. Next time will add with the broth. Divine recipe!

Absolutely delicious soup. I made the recipe exactly how it was written and it turned out awesome. The only thing is I forgot to add the heavey cream when serving. We certainly didn't miss it and for those calorie counters out there it is a great way to cut down.

My favorite soup of all time! The only change I'd suggest is I double the amount of broth, otherwise I find my rice soaks up all the liquid and it turns out more like stew than soup. And a little extra curry never hurts.

I love Indian flavours, and found this dish very tasty,  wished had made double batch, but will certainly do that next time.  Threw in some coriander just to make the flavours pop.

I first made this soup about 5 years ago and it has been a staple ever since.  I use 2% milk at the end instead of cream but have forgotten it a few times and it is still good. I add more rice, about 1/2 a cup.  VERY GOOD RECIPE!

Soup is one of my favorite things to make. My daughter was over one day and we had this soup, and she said it was the best she's ever tasted!  I used more curry also...ya 2 Tbls. and used the whole apple.  I also take half the soup and blend it a bit and then stir it back in with the rest.  I like the rich thickness that step makes. Oh, and I keep forgetting to add the cream at the end. Delicious anyway!

This soup is amazing! My first time cooking with curry, I used one from a middle eastern market "Indian curry." There was also Jamaican curry. The only thing I added was some fresh minced garlic at the end. I double the recipe now and it goes fast! Thanks for sharing!

Made a couple of adjustment. I added a full tablespoon of curry and added the cream at the end and let the soup heat back up without simmering.

This was excellent!  Didn't use the cream, actually forgot to put it in. Did throw some potatoes in and doubled the recipe so we could have leftovers. Didn't use the right kind of apple either as it didn't have much flavour. Would use Granny Smith in the future. Will make again for sure!

This soup was easy and quick. It was also very well liked when I made it. My changes were simple and two of them were due to lack of ingredients. I omitted the apple (didn't have it) and used barley instead of rice (didn't have that either). It also seemed to need more broth and an extra teaspoon of curry powder. Also, it did not need to simmer as long as recommended. This soup only cooked about 35 min altogether.

I usually read through the reviews and make the recipe according to the highest review, but am so glad I didn't on this one. I made it exactly as written and it was divine. I wish it wouldn't have been so filling so I could have another helping. I think potatoes would be a good addition next time. Thank you for this recipe!

I have never tried nor heard of a soup like this.  I'm really glad I made it, as we all enjoyed it.  I made exactly as written, only I made a double batch.  I think this is a soup that gets better the longer it sits.  It does congeal somewhat when refrigerated, but reheats nicely with more flavor than the first time around.  I served this with 'Sweet Cornbread Cake' from AR and we had a delicious meal on a snowy, cold Indiana night.

This soup was incredibly flavorful and delicious! I would certainly make it again.  I did all just as stated, only added some extra veggies and apples.  I baked a chicken in advance and chopped up the meat to use in the soup (and I also used real chicken stock as the base).  We served it with sour cream instead of regular cream, since that is what we had available.  I also added a dash or two of white wine vinegar in mine, since I love my soup with a bit of 'tang'.

I love this soup at my favourite Indian restaurant, and reading this recipe sounded the closest to what I experienced there. I made the following modifications, brought it to a pot-luck at work and had people seek me out for who made it (and the recipe). So here it is!
1) I doubled the recipe, which then would call for 3 tsp of curry powder total
2) I didn’t use the yellow curry powder most people have. Instead I made my own from an Indian vindaloo recipe I make. ½ tsp each of brown mustard seed, cumin seed, black peppercorn (use mortar and pestle, or as I do, a cheap coffee grinder used only for spices) – add ½  tsp of ginger, 1 tsp of turmeric (will give the soup a nice color), 1 tsp of garam masala. My curry powder totals 4 tsp instead of 3, but I like the flavour at that intensity. For optional heat I recommend 2-4 dried red chili pepper be added to the seed/peppercorn mix when breaking them up.
3) I precut the chicken and stir fried it in a portion of the butter – makes it firmer on the exterior that way so it doesn’t break down so easily in the soup.
4) I added lemon. Most soups I’ve had like this had actual lemon in it, but I cheated and just squirted in some real lemon – amount to taste.
5) After making let cool and re-heat the following day, adding cream at last moment as per recipe. All curry based recipes are better the next day!

I felt it was a little thin on the veggies and added more of everything, as well as zucchini because it was cheap/in season (note on the zucchini - wait till last to put them in! They get a bit gooey). I also added tofu instead of chicken... stick the tofu in earlier, when sauteing, or it'll taste really tofu-y . 

I also cut down the broth by 1/3 - I like my soup to be more stewlike. I also feel you could put in like double the rice, and next time I will.  I also plan to add in potatoes and cabbage to make it more filling. I really think you can add any veggies you want and it'll be great. I'm so sick of borscht, so this is my new go-to food for when I'm dead broke. You can pack in a week's worth of food for a single person on around 30-35 bucks.

delicious soup! i forgot all about the cream but don't think it's needed, when i make it again i will probably do the same. the only thing i added was some crushed pepper flakes since we like spicy food.

I love this recipe and it's become somewhat of a staple in our house. Because we eat low carb, I leave out the flour and rice. I usually end up adding more of the meat and veggies.  Once I did accidentally use cayenne pepper instead of the red curry powder I have. While the first bite was quite a shock, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. It was spicy, but not too bad; and the taste was actually still really good.

GREAT Recipe!!! I've made it seriously at least every week!! Even the kids like it!! I've actually tweaked it by omitting the heavy cream...and I like my soup not as thick so I cook the rice separately and pour broth over rice or else the rice in the soup will make it too thick? My kids didn't really like the apples in it so I actually chop up some small potatoes instead to give it more texture substance...Love the flavor of the curry...YUM. I usually end of tripling this recipe b/c I can eat it for a couple of days in a role! YUM!! Thanks for sharing!!!

This is my favorite chicken soup recipe of all time.  Of course, I tweak it a little bit, to suit my taste.  I add garlic, more curry powder, and my favorite vegetables.  I also leave out the heavy cream, so it becomes a really healthy, really low calorie meal...my favorite diet meal.

I doubled the chicken. I used an entire huge onion and an entire huge apple. I probably used less cream, I just added it til it tasted rich enough. I would use more curry powder in the future but that might be because I added more onion/apple/chicken. This is easy to play around with, a good solid chicken soup with just enough exotic features to make it not just "got a cold chicken soup". Thanks for sharing!

good recipe, but as always, a little tame for me. I doubled the curry, and added 1/4 tsp. of garham masala, and a couple of cloves. I also cut the amount of salt in half, used half and half instead of heavy cream, and added 1 cup of diced tomato, and a tsp. of lemmon juice.  quite a jump from the recipe, but I liked it this way better.  it is also nice to use a hand blender to puree the soup before adding the rice. gives it a nice creamy texture. yummy!

This was great.  We loved it.  I made it according to the recipe with the exception of omitting the celery because I hate it (I put a little celery seed in instead).  My only complaint is that it didn't make enough!  It definitely did not make 6 servings--it was more like 2.5.  The picture looks much thinner than mine.  Mine was extremely thick.  Delicious, but thick.  I will have to add more chicken broth next time if I want leftovers (and I do).

Oh. My. Goodness. This is fantastic. I can't wait to have it for lunch tomorrow! Even my two year old and non believer husband liked it. I did not add the apple, as I was fresh out, but will have to next time I make it. Wow!

My husband and I love this soup!  We do it without cream for the adults (but use 1/2 & 1/2 for the kids to help their bowls cool down), use brown rice, and I use half curry/half garam masala.  Husband adds spicy curry powder and thai chili paste to his bowl to spice it up more.  I love that it is adaptable so you can easily use different amounts or different vegetables (I've tried it with parsnips as well as red pepper - both work great).  Great blended or left as it is.  I always at least triple the recipe in order to have enough leftovers!

If you like curry flavor even a little, you should stop what you are doing and make this right now!  I've had it for lunch and dinner yesterday and today and will probably be making more in a day or so!  I had two small changes...used shallots (half the amount of onion called for) and made broth with veggie buillon cubes, mostly because it was all I had.  I also omitted the cream.  I'm sure it would have been delicious but I didn't need it and it was amazing anyways.  The only tiny thing wrong was it was a little on the salty side, but that is mostly my fault because I committed the cardinal sin of not tasting before seasoning.  So make sure you definitely test before you salt, especially if you are trying to watch your salt intake.  This is sure to become a regular recipe in my cooking.

This recipe turned out great! The only things I did different were to add the chicken cubes after the rice had a few minutes to cook so they did not over cook and I didn't have any heavy cream so I served it with a small spoon of Greek yogurt.

EXCELLENT!!!!! I added a litlle extra curry because my family likes the flavor, but; this is phenomenal! I agree with other reviewers, make an extra batch (double the recipe) because we only got three bowls out of this.

Love it.  This has become a staple in our house and I've taken it to a couple "soup parties" where guests have raved about it. Only changes we've made is that I use quinoa instead of rice, and I usually make it the night after we've had a roasted chicken for dinner so I use those left overs instead of using just chicken breast. 
Also I typically quadruple the recipe- so that there are plenty left over to freeze and have the next week or so.

In a word...awesome!!  I pureed the veggies and broth after Step 1 so my veggie-phobic son would still try it; and it was a hit.  I'm glad I made a double batch, because it's disappearing fast!

I love all things curry so this was right up my alley. I did double the curry powder and before adding the rice and chicken, I pureed the apples that were floating on top. The flavor was good before but I didnt really like biting into the crunchy apples. The puree added creamyness and a sweet/tart to every bite. Last change was I used coconut milk vs heavy cream. Since its a common ingredient in many cuurries I figured it would work well and it def did.

Best. Soup. Ever. Hits the spot every time, I have to at least double the recipe every time I make it or it disappears too quickly!

I loved this soup! Just made it for lunch on this cold winter day and very grateful not to have to bundle up to go to the store for ingredients. I had everything I needed. Wonderful flavor - I did double the curry. I will definitely make this soup again. jeanb

It was yummy, if a bit effortful. I think my mom's chicken curry soup recipe tastes similar but requires a lot less work, so I will stick with that. But thanks anyway for sharing!

This recipe was incredible! I made it more out of curiosity than anything else and 3 days later my husband is already asking if we can make it again. I used 2 tsp of curry bowder and 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper. I substituted milk for the heavy cream. I also made a big loaf of bread to go with it (http://www.frugallivingnw.com/frugal-homemaking/amazing-no-knead-bread-step-by-step-recipe/).

Be sure and add slivered almonds and raisins at the end, makes a good thing even better! I did not think the cream was necessary; I liked it better without.

I had my doubts at first, all I could taste was chicken stock; however after the first 30 minutes of simmering the flavors started to come through. I followed the recipe exactly, but next time I will cook the rice separately and add at the end after pureeing the soup (after removing the chicken of coarse). I also browned the chicken first before adding it to the soup.

Love love love this recipe! It was more delicious than I could've expected to pull off. I love curry so I upped the amount and also added some curry paste. To cut back on a few calories I used half whole milk and half light cream. Cannot wait to make it again. Thanks for sharing!!

Absolutely delicious.  I added a tin of coconut cream instead of the heavy cream, not even sure why, think I read it somewhere in another recipe.  It was so delicious I could have made gallons!  everyone at the dinner raved!  it IS very heavy so you don't need to eat alot.  Will make again and again!

This is an amazing recipe. I made it for the first time on christmas eve as a lunch. I added a few things that were suggested by others to the recipe and I can't wait to experiment a little more.  Added 3 cloves garlic, 2 cm ginger minced, extra teaspoon curry powder, teaspoon garham masala, pinch of curry leaves and instead of cream I used coconut milk.  My husband and 3 year old devoured it . Everyone had seconds :) Served with fresh bread yummy.

This is one of my favorite soup recipes from this site. The curry is not overpowering at all but is very subtle in the final product. It's hearty, filling, inexpensive and easy to make. What's not to love?

I was in the midst of making ginger-curry roasted butternut squash soup but it was tasting bland. Then I thought of adding some apple and chicken and it reminded me of Mulligatawny Soup. What I ended up with was a very similar variation to this soup with the only different ingredient being the squash. It turned out to be delicious. I skipped the thyme and doubled the apple. Yum!

Great! Thank you!
Didn't add celery and served without the cream (since didn't have any on hand).  The rice I used, although basmati, ended up expanding over the next 24 hours and the soup became more like a meal.  Next time I will use different rice, or less of this one!

This is quite possibly the BEST. SOUP. I. EVER. MADE.   Double or triple the recipe if you make it.  This was not 6 servings with the amount that people wanted to eat.  More like 3 servings.  The only things I did differently were I bought a rotisserie chicken and cut up some for the soup instead of putting in raw chicken.  I also added a splash of hot sauce at the end to give it a little more heat.  I had an excellent bottle of gourmet ginger-mango hot sauce that was perfect for this soup but any kind would do if you want it hotter. DO NOT omit the apple even though it sounds like it might not be good, it IS!!!  EXCELLENT RECIPE, thank you so much for posting this one.

This recipe is amazing.  It goes so fast that I wound up doubling it.  I subbed olive oil for butter and only added 2 tbsp.  I also skipped the heavy cream as suggested by others and I didn't miss it.  I kept everything else the same and it is delicious.  Thanks for this 10 star recipe!

I make this soup often and always for a crowd. It is great as is but here are my changes: Brown rice for white. Add the apples just before serving so they don't get mushy. I will try suggestions for using coconut oil for butter and coconut milk for cream. I think those would be good variations. I also garnish with parsley.

SO AMAZING!  It's actually hard to believe that something so simple is so delicious.  I make it exactly as written EXCEPT I've never tried it with the heavy cream.  Don't see the point.  Can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow and freeze the rest!

My family really likes this recipe.  It's easy and quick, and it's even better the next day, when the rice has had a chance to thicken up the soup a bit.  I like to add a bit of chopped cilantro to mine.  I've made this over and over and it's a hit every time.

This is a splendid soup! I followed the suggestions of adding garlic with the onion, using twice the curry powder and replacing the cream with coconut milk.  I will make this again!  I cooked my chicken ahead of time to pink center just to make sure it would be cooked enough.

Awesome recipe, always wondered what was so good about this soup when I first
heard the name on Friends TV Show... remember Kramer and the soup Nazi? Well, this definately lived up to my expectations. I did change a few things, I used fresh Thyme which just adds to the aroma of the soup. I also added coconut milk instead of heavy cream. My wife loves this soup and I have made it for many of my friends they always want me to make more. I would highly recommend it to everyone...especially if you like a little or alot curry flavor, adjust to your liking.

Fanatastic recipe.  Even my picky wife and even pickier toddler loved it.  Prepared as written.  Definately added to the "make again" list.

Excellent recipe. I added a bit more curry, and omitted the cream altogether - and it was phenomenal, my husband and I ate the entire pot in one day! Thank you for sharing. Just perfect.

Add me to the folks raving about this recipe!!  I followed the recipe exactly as written, except that I added a dash of cayenne - definitely a keeper.

I get cravings for this soup.  I omit the onion and add a sweet red pepper.  Try a mild curry paste in place of the powder.  I lighten mine up by using skim milk instead of cream.  Best soup I've ever had.

Really loved it!  I didn't add the cream as I'm not partial to cream soup.  In lieu, I doubled up on the veggies and chicken, and added a cup of water with the stock.  I like a nice hearty soup, and will definitely make again - and double up yet again the veggies and the chicken!  I cook on a gas stove and 1/2 hr to simmer the veggies is way too long.  Probably will hold to 10min.

This was really great (before I added any and too much rice). I doubled the recipe and added 4 large cloves of garlic and 3 Tbsp. of Yellow Curry powder, two potatoes, 1 Jalapeno with seeds and eventually 1.r Lb of boneless chicken thighs (dark meat makes it sweeter but it would have been more so with the bones). Then I asked myself, what makes this any different from Chicken Curry and I determined that it was the apples, so I doubled the amount with half finely and half coarsely chopped. I simmered it 3 hours, took out the chicken, put a hand blender for 20 or 30 seconds in to get it to thicken (but not to puree the chunks). Then I chopped the chicken and added it back. At this point (before I added the rice) the taste was out of this world!   Next I added the rice and decided to double the amount for more of a stew consistency but that completely dulled the flavors and it took forever to cook (like 3 more hours with me constantly adding more broth and then water). Next time I will keep the rice on the side and do a taste test with and without some rice but I have a feeling the no rice option will be the winner.   For sure I will make this again since I long for the pre-rice taste. 5 star before the rice and 3 after = 4 stars.

Made significant changes: used garam masala instead of curry powder; used 1.5 tablespoons of masala instead of 1.5 teaspoons; used coconut milk instead of heavy cream; added a bit of fresh lemon juice right before serving. Was good.

FANTASTIC soup! I'm absolutely in love with curry now! Easy to make, low calorie and inexpensive, it's perfect!  I made it exactly as the recipe said, but cooked the chicken and rice seperately to make sure they got done.

Added extra 1/4 c rice plus 1 extra cup broth, used veg broth, added extra curry plus dash of cayenne paper, skipped (forgot) cream.  1 full recipe makes enough for 2, plus 2 servings for next day.

Fantastic and easy to make - and the kids all enjoyed it!  Double the recipe up unless you're only cooking for one. Great way to use up leftover chicken and rice.  A few minor adjustments:   * Used Margarine instead of butter, and less than listed   * Roughly doubled the flour - I like this soup thick   * Doubled the rice   * Used Milk instead of Cream - don't usually have any on hand.   * Added a bit more curry powder.  This one will make it's way into my regular rotation.  Thanks!

Delicious.  I gave it a whirl with my immersion blender at the end which helped give it a creamier consistency.  I omitted the cream and just stirred in some 1% at the end but it didn't even need that.  Tasted like it had been cooked all day long.  I can't wait to make it again!

Wow! Boyfriend and I gobbled this up! It's amazing- I just used the ingrediants and ignored the exact measurements and it was one of the best things that has come off my stove in recent history. We had it with homemade naan from this site also. YUM!

This was so good!  I was leery about whether my fiance would enjoy it cuz of the curry but he loved it.  I asked him is it a make again recipe or not and he said YES!  The only change I made, and it was not intentional, was I used beef broth instead of chicken.  I was making my shopping list and I had my moms handwritten recipe for mulligatawny that said to use beef and then I decided on this one but guess I'd already written beef broth on my list.  But it was still scrumptious!!!  I do want to add that next time I'm going to double the recipe so I have plenty of leftovers.

Delicious.  My only change was grating the apples first. Even my "picky-eater" son loved it, as did everyone at our church supper.  No left-overs!

If I could give this recipe a higher rating I would. My son 18 loved it so much he asked for it the last 2 days in a row! I didn't have any fresh apples, so I substituted a can of unsweetened applesauce I had in the pantry and they ate it up! Thanks for sharing such a great recipe! It's become a family favorite and will remain with us for years to come!

I'm basically going to offer a ditto of what many others have said:  YUM!  I doubled the veggies because I like them, and I also did potatoes instead of rice.  I used five cups of chicken broth and then, instead of cream, added a can of condensed milk.  I really think that the key to the flavor is sauteing the curry with the flour for the full five minutes.  That really seems to open up the spice.  Thanks...this is going in my rotation!

Absolutely delicious! I made it using EVOO instead of butter and I added a dash of fat free cream to the pot of soup towards the end of cooking. I also added tumeric (which has excellent health benefits) and it added an extra punch to the flavor, but the soup is delicious on its own.

This is easy and tastes fantastic ... one of my favorite soups and this is the perfect recipe .... the apple gives it just the right amount of sweetness.  Couldn't have been easier to make.

Absolutely delicious! I'm a curry lover though...I made this with my own homemade chicken stock. I also upped it to a whole onion, chopped, three large stalks of celery, and I chopped a half a bag of baby carrots just to make things harder for myself and I added some diced potatoes, the little baby dutch ones bc I like potatoes in this stoup. I drizzled a little EVOO with the butter before throwing in the veggies and used about 2T flour. Added about 1/2 T jarred minced garlic. Upped the curry to 2 teaspoons. I nixed the apple and heavy cream. Upped the rice to about 1/3-1/2 cup and added more stock, pry 2cups more. Used 2 huge chicken breasts. At the end I added about 1T fresh thyme. My boyfriend had never had this before, the whole time it was cooking he kept saying, "oh it smells sooo good!, is it ready yet?". He ended up loving it and wanting the leftovers for lunch the next day. LOVE IT!

As part of my employment, I make soup once a week for a group of 10-30 people.  This soup is the favorite!  Absolutely delicious.  I've served it at home to rave reviews also.

Wow, this is something special-I made it for my husband, and he loved it!! He is picky, and doesn't rave about my cooking much, but as soon as he took a bite his eyes got big, and couldn't stop talking about how good it was.  Not at all a  leftover guy, he ate the leftovers for 3 more days, and told all his friends about it too!  This is big!  As a vegetarian, I was sorry I couldn't try it, as it smelled amazing:, and so easy and ecomical!  A true keeper!

Great recipe! Used smart butter instead it definitely cut the calories down even more... And paired the soup with toasted seven grain bread that we had. Delicious! My dad even liked to but french fried onions on top. Wonderful. :D

This soup has an amazingly rich flavor for its simple ingredients.  Substitute butter for olive oil and you will have a very low fat recipe.

I've never had this soup before so I wasn't sure what to expect. But I like the flavor of curry so I decided to give it a try. I thought the soup was excellent. I served it with warm naan bread (I got the recipe from this website). I  will definately make it again.

GREAT FLAVOR! I had to make a couple of fat friendly changes, no butter and I used fat free half and half instead of heavy cream...added leftover white and long grain rice that I had in the fridge (omitted the salt) and added some frozen peas...I love the curry with the apple..very nice and I will make this again!

We loved this soup.  I had tons of leftover turkey and was looking for different ways to use it up and so used it instead of chicken - it still tasted awesome.  I did add lots of garlic and I did put in more celery and carrots than required but we love thick soups.  I increased the thyme, curry and pepper - it's personal preference with spices and I always taste test till I like it.    I think the recipe as it stands is great - I use them as a guideline because we all have different tastes.  Thanks - I will make this again and again.

Absolutely delicious!  This recipe is fairly simple but the result is outstanding!   I did substitute 2% milk for the heavy cream and it was still wonderfully rich!  Definitely a keeper and a must try!!!

Delicious!  Made it twice.  The second time I doubled the recipe and doubled the curry.  Added a pinch of red pepper flakes.  Left out the butter and flour the second time and it was just as good.  Used fat free half/half instead of heavy cream.  We ate it for 3 nights and each night it got better.  Thanks for sharing!

Oh so tasty. A great recipe. Made a few minor adjustments to fit what I had on hand. Substituted 1/2 a block of tofu (marinated in 1tbsp soy sauce, 1/2tbsp sweet chili sauce, and 1/2tbsp rice vinegar for 30min) for the chicken, and brown basmati for the white rice. Also added 1tsp garam masala and 1tsp green curry paste for a bit more zip. It didn't even need the cream. Also, add salt at the very end, but taste to make sure you need it. Most chicken broth is salty enough that no extra salt is required.

I wasn't big on soup as a meal, until Mulligatawny came into my life.  All you need is some bread and you have a full meal.  This recipe is AMAZING.  If you like curry, you'll like this.  Just make sure you AT LEAST DOUBLE the curry powder.  I use 2 tsp red and 1 tsp yellow.  Don't know if it matters using both, but I haven't made it any other way.  Make it, you'll love it.

Husband LOVED this. I used a Costco chicken for the breast meat.  I also doubled it so we had leftovers.  It's hearty and good on a winter's day.  It is even better for left overs.  I left the celery out and didnt notice it.  It's definitely something unique and out there.  I didnt love it as compared to Mulligatawny soup I have had in Indian restaurants, but my husband gave it a perfect 10!!!

I dont know if soem of my measurements were off but it was 1/2 cup of all veggies. My curry powder was homemade from a previous recipe. I added 2 chicken breasts. I omitted the Thyme because i didnt have any (oops). I added some milk at the end and it really added something nice to the dish. ** Result ** I loved it... my kids loved it but it was a bit too spicy (so I will make my curry again and add less 'heat'). NO leftovers as for a family of 5.. it just makes enough for 1 hearty meal. I will definitely make this  again!! (btw - my boys are 5-1/2, 3-1/2 and just under 2 years).

I never heard of this soup prior to seeing this recipe. I decided to try it out, and I am glad I did.  This soup is unique, refreshing and delicious!  Will make it again in double or triple batches.

Yum! I loved this. I left the cream out of mine, but added a tbsp. of whole milk to my toddler's bowl. I also pureed hers (as I do with most of her soups; as this gets her to eat them better!) I did add more curry at the end, probabably an extra tsp. I also used brown rice. Next time, I will add a little more chicken, and maybe a touch of cinnamon!

Doubled curry and omitted the cream. Didn't care for the apples. Full of flavor and easier than I was expecting.

This was awesome.  Like so many others, I fudged with the recipe to come up with my own.  My changes:  double the recipe; use 1/4 cup olive oil instead of butter; add 1 tbsp minced garlic; add 3 tsp garam masala (look for indian ingredients at your local Publix); add 1/2 cup lite coconut milk and 1/2 cup fat free 1/2 & 1/2.   Pair with good fresh bread, and dip/scoop soup into your mouth.  Nom nom nom nom!  Everybody loved this, and by doubling the recipe, you get some yum-yum leftovers!

Really delicious.  Definitely true that it's better a day later.  My 17 month old son loved it too.  I used brown rice and added it from the beginning.  More curry, no cream.  Just saw no need for it.

On one point I agree with other reviewers: double the spices. However, skip the cream or coconut milk. I tried the recipe before the addition of the coconut milk, and it was perfect. I'm sorry I went ahead and added it because it lost a lot of flavor.

Great recipe! I followed others' comments by doubling the curry. I added more chicken broth because i increased the rice. I also added raisins after the the chicken and rice were fully cooked.

Very delicious and very easy. I made the Naan recipe from this site, which went perfectly with the Indian-food theme/taste. My husband felt it made his tummy a little rumbly during the digestion stages ;) BUT he'd eat it again without hesitation!

I dont think you can go wrong with how you do this soup. The cominbation of all of the flavors is GREAT! I doubled it and used 2 apples, more rice, and 3/4 can cocunut milk. Put all veggies and apples in food processor. Sprinkled with raisins. will make again.

This soup is wonderful! Perfect for a fall, Makes the house smell great. I followed the recipe but pureed the carrots/celery/onion mix after it simmered in the broth. I used half chicken, half vegetable broth and three apples in a double batch. Left out the cream. It's a perfect soup. Will make this for years to come.

Great recipe| I adapted it to a low-fat vegetarian soup by: using using only a few tsp of butter to fry the onion, putting a small dollop of fat-free sour cream on top instead of cream, and replacing the meat with vegetable borth and vegetarian mock-chicken pieces. Delicious and filling!

Our family loves this recipe! I usually follow the recipe exactly the first time before fiddling with it... and it's delightful as is! My girls ask for it (17 and 11) and the older one requests more curry. I have mistakenly omitted the celery and it was fine. The apples add something special and if you've left them out, please try it with them! Thank you for this recipe, Lise!

Wow, I was surprised at how much I liked this as I am not usually one for cooked fruit. (in non-desserts)  There was no noticeable apple flavor but it was definitely an asset to the dish.  Actually found myself thinking it needed a little bit more apple. I threw in a chicken breast while the broth was simmering and it came out perfectly shredded.  if you are like me and want as little to do with raw meat as possible- make it easier on yourself and don't even bother cutting it up.  I didn't add the cream- simply an oversight- but it really didn't need it.

This was SO tasty! The only  thing I did differently was to use an immersion blender before adding the chicken to blend all the vegetables. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written and it was delicious!

I love this soup.  I used 5 cups of chicken stock instead of 4, substituted chopped spinach instead of carrots, used 2 tsp of curry, stir-fried the chicken cubes in roasted garlic, salt, and pepper and added the browned chicken and brown rice as soon as the chicken stock started to boil.  Boiled only 25 minutes and then added some whole milk and topped with sour cream to serve.  This is really tasty!

This is my first allrecipe attempt, and if this is any indication of how good the recipes on here are, I'll definitely be trying more! This was easy, tasty and filling. I added extra veg, chicken and rice to make it more of a meal, extra curry powder for kick, and it was perfect. Also liked it better without the cream, but to each their own!

Based on the reviews, I went ahead and doubled the recipe.  I'm glad I did.  This soup tastes very good and is easy to make.  The first night, I forgot to add the cream and enjoyed it very much anyway.  The second night, I added cream as instructed in the recipe.  It was good, but I liked it better without the cream. Even my family members that only like "normal" food enjoyed this soup. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I'm amazed my husband even tried this, he's so picky. But he came back for seconds, so I'll be making it again. This was a very tasty and 'homey' soup. My family loved it. I doubled the recipe thinking I would have lots of leftovers...I didn't have much and my family didn't eat like pigs. Next time, to really have leftovers, I will want to triple or even quadruple the recipe. This would seem excessive for alot of other recipes, but this soup is worth the ingredients to triple or quadruple it. Happy eating!

I skipped the cream completely because I didn't have any.  Didn't miss it!  I also used leftover rotesserie chicken and brown rice.  Next time I will use more rice than they call for.  I doubled the recipe and my family of 5(with one teenage boy) ate it up.  Better than the recipe in my little box!

Very good. I really wanted to try this even though I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, so I adapted a bit. I chopped the onion and carrots in a food processor in a bit of olive oil, leaving out the celery because I didn't have any. I also left out the chicken and apples, and substituted the heavy cream for coconut milk to make up for the sweet taste of the apple. This was still sooooo good. I plan to make the original recipe after I go grocery shopping this week! :)

I don't know what I did wrong...It was OK, but not the blockbuster I was hoping for after reading all the great reviews.  I made this soup from scratch, with a rotisserie chicken.  I simmered the chicken for 21/2 hours to make stock, then cleaned the chicken and returned half the meat to the soup. I did not have any celery so I increased the onion and carrot.  I also substituted cubed potato for the rice because we don't like rice in our soup.  I've never tasted Mulligatawny soup before, so didn't know what to expect.  I found it a little bland, maybe it's my head cold...

yum,yum,yum!I doubled the recipe, eye-balled the ingredients,and only additions were more curry powder,garlic chopped,1 unseeded jalapeno, and a bit of cilantro at the end. sauteed the veggies in oil instead of butter.Used basmati rice.I omitted the cream; didn't need it. this is a meal in itself; hearty flavor. Loved the sweet bites of the apple. This could be altered to suit vegans and stand on its own. super great recipe that I'll make over and over in the cold days ahead.super hearty. not too thick like a stew, but not thin either. just perfect!

WOW this soup was everything the other reviewers said it was!!  I did a couple things different, but very slightly.  I didn't have celery, so I used a hole apple, and added celery salt.  Also, I made it in a crock pot.  I followed the first few steps with the butter and veggies, and then once it was time to add the meat and broth and rice, I put it in the crock pot for about 5 hours on low.  It was SO flavorful and PERFECT.  I also used chicken thighs (2) instead of a breast b/c they were what I had. Can't wait to eat the tiny bit of leftovers.  Oh, and even my 2 year old ate some!

Great soup! I thought it would end up tasting like chicken soup with some curry powder in it, but it was more unique than that.  I didn't change a anything except the cut on the carrots.  I think next time I would bake the chicken breast.

Made this for the first time as part of my girlfriend's birthday dinner. I used my 11 year daughter as a tester and said it was the best soup she's ever had. I then tried it out on my neighbor and she fell in love with it. I followed the recipe to a T, but maybe next time will use half and half, or something else w/less fat.

This is a great alternative to all of you who are bored with chicken noodle or rice soup. This recipe is flavorful and rich which equals delish! I followed the recipe exactly except I like my veggies smaller so I diced them. I wouldn't change a thing. Even my husband who isn't a curry fan loved it.

Excellent recipe! I used 2.5 tsps curry powder (still not *spicy* by my standards) and shredded the apple since my roommate doesn't like cooked fruit--she did not notice. I served this with frozen naan I got at Trader Joe's, which was pretty good for a frozen product.

I made this recipe for the first time last month and was very impressed! My husband loved it as well. I've made it a couple of times since then as it is now a regular. We found we like it best with the ingredients finely chopped and the chicken pureed. Very yummy!!

I made this soup last night and it was soooooo good! I doubled the recipe adding two apples a little more curry and two yellow potatoes. I also didn't cook the rice in the soup...I cooked it on the side and poured the soup over it. So delish. I will make again...for sure.

This soup was amazing. I made it purely on the number of good reviews it has received. I was a little worried when I saw apples as I am not one to mix sweet and salty but this was amazing.

Easily the best recipe I've found on this site. The house smelled amazing, and I will never forget the sheer joy of eating this soup on a cold day. 

I did have to modify based on what I had: a diced potato instead of an apple and I upped the curry powder to 3 tbsp as recommended by another reviewer. Also, I didn't have cream, but the rice thickened it up enough in my opinion!

DELICIOUS soup!  I absolutely loved this recipe, and so did my family.  Since we are not big cooked veggie eaters, I took out the onion, carrot, and celery.  I doubled the recipe, but cut the butter down to 6 T, instead of 8.  It was a little thick, so, before serving, I thinned it out with a little milk.  I also mixed in a little heavy cream, which really made the dish!  Thanks!

Very good soup! The only changes I'll make next time are to make the rice separately (and probably triple the amount of rice) and to skip the cream which made it too rich for me.

This recipe was absolutely delicious!  It's one of the best soups I've ever tasted.  I tried it with and without the heavy cream and it tastes great either way.  Next time, I'll make sure to double the recipe and freeze any leftovers.

Excellent, but not as a soup.  Mine turned out pretty thick, but my husband and I both agree that it's better that way.  The only changes I made is I used milk instead of cream and left out the apples because I don't like cooked apples much.  I used red curry powder in the amount specified and it was pretty spicy.  A little bread and butter along with it helped to make it more mild.  My husband thought it was the best meal I've ever made!

Love it, Love it, Love it!  I didn't add the apple (because we don't like hot fruit) and I used a wild rice blend instead of white rice.  I had to let it simmer longer, but I tell you, it was awesome!  And its true, the leftovers are great (if you have any).

Wonderful! My husband is sometimes hesitant about some of my recipe 'finds' but absolutely loved this.  My only problem, and I think it's just me, is that I never seem to have enough broth once I add the rice.  Flavor-wise, this is fantastic, thank you.

OMG...this was so good!  I can't wait to make it again.  I did up the curry to 3-4 teaspoons and doubled the recipe.  I think the cream is what brings it all together.  Awesome!!!!!!!!

Great recipe.  Very tasty.  My 2 year old loved it.  I doubled it (I kept the butter the same) as suggested by others and was just enough for my family of 4.

I'd never tried Mulligatawny soup before and my fiancee and I were both blown away by how tasty this was. The quantities given filled us both up for one meal but we really had little to no leftovers.

LOVED it.  I didn't use the cream, and it still tasted great. As noted before, double the recipe; it's only about 3-4 servings worth.

EXCELLENT!!!! I doubled the recipe immediately because I knew that I was going to love it. I use chicken "stock" instead of chicken broth for that "long cooked flavor", but I'm sure the broth fares just as well, by all the wonderful comments this recipe has received. There wasn't a drop left at dinner this evening and I will be making this a lot over the coming winter months. Yummy!

I first had mulligatawny soup at a restaurant, and was amazed!  This recipe is excellent.  Mine turned out totally delicious and creamy.  The changes I made was adding Mexican La Crema (table cream), instead of regular cream because that is what I had on hand. The flavor is outstanding, and this is easy and fun to make.  I'm waiting for a friend of mine from India to give an authentic Indian Mulligatawny soup recipe.

This is really excellent soup.  I didn't have thyme, so I added a little basil and two bay leaves.  I also used non-fat half and half instead of cream.  My husband raved and said "give it 5 stars!" so I did!  Will definitely make this again.

Yum!  Substituted fat free half and half for the cream and only used about half the amount.

Awesome, awesome, awesome! Definitely double this recipe (triple, quadruple?). The leftovers heat up nicely too. This soup is easy to make and much more affordable than TSR's "Soup Nazi" version! You can add extra curry at the end "to taste" if you like more spice.
