This was pretty good.  My mom and sister loved these.  I changed a bit of the ingredients around since I didn't have all the ingredients you listed.  I mixed normal white rice, butter, ground pepper, salt, pieces of pepperoni, onions, garlic, and feta cheese and stuffed them into the tomatoes. Very tasty.

You will have to prepare rice for this recipe which takes away from it being very simple, and I found I needed about more of the stuffing mixture than the recipe called for. Fortunately, I had prepared rice for another recipe, and happened to have plenty left over. Keep that in mind, so you that you make plenty of rice and chopped veggies ahead of time.
  The next time I make it, I will sprinkle salt and pepper on the inside of the tomatoes before putting the mixture in, maybe even brush a little oil and salt on the outside too. I didn't use parsley, but instead substituted oregano.
  They were delicous, and a great way to add a nice colorful vegetable dish to my pork chop dinner.

This was very good. I did use the smaller tomatoes I had on hand. I took some people's advice and added mozzarella cheese tot he mix. Since I had more basil on hand I used that too, and a red pepper instead of green. Brown rice instead of white was just as good and all in all this was a great and adaptable recipe.

I found this to be a great way to use tomatoes.  We love stuffed peppers, but I never thought to stuff tomatoes and bake them.  I did have to make extra rice (maybe my tomatoes were too big?) and I added basil.  Overall, a very good recipe that I'll make again!  Thanks Krista

I thought that these were very good and I will definitely make them again.  The reason why this recipe only got 4 stars was because the pepper pieces weren't as tender as they should have been.  This might be because I used 8 smaller tomatoes and cooked them for 15 minutes.  As for the complaints that there wasnt enough filling, I made 1 1/4 cups of rice and estimated the vegetables and I had the perfect amount of filling.  I sprinkled shredded mozzarella cheese on top of some of them, but I might mix it into the mixture next time.

Not bad, I've never had stuffed or baked tomatoes like this and I was quite surprised at how good they were. I think these are missing something maybe it is some meat? They are a little bland but still tasty! They kind of reminded me of stuffed green peppers for some reason.

these were quite good... I did use more green pepper and onion then the recipe called for and I'm glad I did. It is a little on the blah side so next time I think maybe I will put shredded cheese on top or something of that nature. Super easy to make and I will make them again! Thanks!

I love stuffed tomatoes, but I think I prefer them with some meat in there (chopped up sausage or bacon). Needs a flavor boost.

This is a good base recipe, but as written, we found it a bit bland. I should have followed my instincts and sauteed the garlic before mixing with the stuffing. The garlic did not cook during baking and raw garlic is not one of my favorite things. Good start, just not great for us. Thanks for sharing! :)

Even though the directions use instant rice, the time given to cook the rice wasn't enough. Once done, the recipe was pretty bland and not terribly tasty.

I LIKE TO MAKE MY RICE IN V-8 JUICE RATHER THAN WATER, ALSO ADDING CRUMBLED BACON OR A BIT OF SAUSAGE IS A GREAT IDEA, AND MOZZARELLA OF COURSE! VERY GOOD!

As written, I thought this was bland (hence the 3 stars). I made some changes, which made the tomatoes very tasty. I cooked the rice in chicken broth. I doubled the onion and garlic, and sauteed both. I also added basil, oregano, and grated Romano cheese to the filling. I had a feeling the filling would be dry, so about 10 minutes before the tomatoes were done cooking, I spooned about 1-2 TBSP of the tomato juice (from the pulp) over the filling.  Not sure if that was necessary. Next time I will try adding feta cheese to the filling.

I thought it was great! I absolutely loved it and will totally make this again. I added feta cheese to it other than that I stuck to the recipe.

So easy to make! I did add in ground chorizo & cheese into the rice mixture. It was so delicious!!! I used everything fresh from the farmer's market (including cheese & chorizo). Thanks for the recipe!

I made this following the recipe almost exactly, using brown instant rice in place of the white.  It was too bland for our tastes, although I'd like to try it again later in the season when the tomatoes are more flavorful.  Will also add some more seasoning to them (maybe salsa?) at that time.

This is a wonderful alternative to stuffed peppers.  Even the kids gobbled it up!
