After some modifications this is a 5-star recipe.

(1) Use whole milk ricotta cheese, drained (To drain ricotta cheese, wrap in a double layer of cheesecloth. Place in a colander and weigh down with a few cans. Allow to drain over a bowl in the refrigerator for 1 hour.);

(2) Replace the the cinnamon, orange zest, vanilla extract and salt and add 1/3 cup of amaretto;

(3) Use only 5 eggs; and,

(4) I used a hand mixer instead of a spatula (much smoother!)

Enjoy! :)

PLEASE DON'T TAKE OUT THE ORANGE ZEST IN THIS RECIPE.  I am first generation Bronx Italian and when I made this it tasted just like an authentic Italian cheesecake.  True Italian cheesecakes have orange and lemon flavor to them.  The only changes I made were as follows: I use 1 1/2 teaspoons orange zest, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and added 1 teaspoon lemon zest and 3 teaspoons of amaretto. I had to cook mine 1 and 3/4 hours. It came out perfect.

This is a great recipe. As mentionned by others, lemons are better than oranges, 5 in stead of 6 eggs and watch not to overcook, 75min is good. The secret is the ricotta, avoid the cheap stuff for the best consistancy (I use Stelle brand). I'm not much of a cook and this cake ALWAYS works. To decorate, use marmelade as a light glaze and top with strands of orange or lemon peel. (The cake is already nice and golden...)  Enjoy

An amazingly easy cake with a delicious flavor and smooth, dense texture! Required NO prep time, and is so simple a child could make. The best cheesecake I've ever made! Since I only had extra large eggs, I used only five, instead of the 6 the recipe calls for. I accidently cooked it too long but it didn't matter, just a little browner top. Next time I'm going to try cooking it at a lower temp. and increasing the cooking time a bit. (I heard this was a good way to increase creaminess and avoid a browned top). The best part? I didn't have to wash a bunch of dishes after! The recipe requires only 1 bowl, a rubber spatula, and grater for the orange zest. I need more recipes like this!

Really good and easy. It isn't as creamy as a cream cheese cake because it's NOT! I used lemon zest instead of orange zest also. It took almost 2 hours to bake but rose nicely. I would strongly recommend a marmalade glaze. Take about 2/3 c. of good marmalade and 2 tsp. lemon juice and boil for a couple of minutes. Pour warm glaze over cooled cake and chill. Beautiful and yummy.

Nix the Cinnamon, orange zest and salt and add 1/3 cup of Amaretto. I use DiSoronno. It will need to cook about 10 to 15 minutes longer. This is how real Italian cheesecake is made! Bona Petit!

This recipe was truly awful.  I'd give it zero stars if I could. I made it for Thanksgiving and not one person liked it.  It was fairly bland and I even added some good pure orange extract along with the zest.  The texture was the big turn off.    It was very grainy, very unappetizing.  I have worked as a product developer in the food industry for many years, I am a trained food taster, and  a lover of all foods ethnic and otherwise, and I could not find anything to like about this cheesecake.

I am Sicilian born and have been looking for a good ricotta cake recipe. I made some major changes -adding a shell of shortcrust pastry and mascarpone topping. I made this cake for a group of choosy Italians and they loved it.  My changes: a) Never bake and serve the same day. Must bake overnight and chill well before serving next day. b) Line cake tin with dessert shortcrust pastry (bottom and sides). Bake blind for 10 min then add ricotta mixture. Bake for 1 hr or until firm/golden. c) Use great quality ricotta and sieve first before adding ingredients. d)  To ricotta mixture: Add rind of 1 lemon, 3-4tablespoons amaretto, ¼ tsp almond essence, 1.5 tsp vanilla essence, grated chocolate (to taste), 75 g crushed roasted hazelnuts. I separated the egg yolks which I mixed with the sugar, essences and lemon/orange grind and folded into the ricotta. Next time I will add a little more caster sugar as the mixture can be a little low on sweetness. Whip egg whites and fold into ricotta. Once baked. Leave overnight in fridge. Next day coat with mascarpone topping.F) MASCARPONE TOPPING: Beat 250g mascarpone ( or 400g depending on size of cake) until smooth and add caster sugar to taste, vanilla essence, grated chocolate , 2 tablespoons Tia maria, lemon grind. Mix well. Coat cake top with mascarpone mixture. Grate some chocolate and sprinkle on top. Sprinkle more crushed hazelnuts for decoration. Chill well before serving until mascarpone is set (at least another 3 hours).

I enjoyed this so much! It's just like grandma's! I used 1 tsp orange zest and 1 tsp lemon zest and it was wonderful. Mine took about 1 3/4 hours, though. I was ready to take a picture for the review, but it was almost all gone!! I'll take it when I make the next one tomorrow!

A ricotta cheesecake is NOT anything like a New York style cheesecake. If you're expecting something sweet and gooey and creamy, you WILL be disappointed. However, this is a fine dessert in its own right. It is lightly sweet, dense, and retains a slightly grainy ricotta texture. It is lovely with fresh raspberries and lemon curd. But don't make this recipe expecting it to be like something off the Philadelphia Cream Cheese box and then give it one star when it's not. This is not an Americanized Cheesecake.

I've never had a Ricotta Cheesecake until now; the taste and texture are very different from traditional cheesecake, but it's quite tasty nonetheless (texture is cake-y and taste is sort of custard-y). I topped mine with chocolate sour cream and strawberries, which worked well.

After looking at all of the updates from others, I combined them into one version - 2 lbs ricotta, 2/3 c white sugar, 1/3 c flour, 5 eggs, 1.5 tsp orange zest, 1 tsp lemon zest, 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1/8 tsp salt, 3 tsp Amaretto.  I had always loved Ricotta Cheesecakes in restaurants and this one is just as good!  I served it at Easter with some strawberry sauce (Strawberry jam heated with a little rum and then cooled) and it was delicious!

This recipe was the easiest Ricotta Cheesecake recipe I've seen, it was also extremely tasty!!  My mom would have LOVED tried a piece of this.  I will definitely try making this one again (next time I will substitute fat-free ricotta and see how it turns out for a low-fat alternative).

As a diabetic, I'm always looking for desserts I can actually eat and enjoy. For this recipe, I substituted 1 cup of Splenda for the sugar, Soy flour for regular flour, and used a good quality fat free ricotta cheese. I served fresh berry mix sweetened with Splenda over the top of each serving. A+++++

My husband loves the Sicilian Ricotta Cheesecake, so I tried many recipes before I found this one. I did made the modifications that a previous reviewer suggested. I drained the ricotta cheese, replace the cinnamon, orange zest, vanilla extract and salt with 1/3 cup of amaretto, I used only 5 eggs and used a hand mixer. It turned out perfect! so smooth and with a delicate flavor, my husband's comment was "I can't get enough of it" ;)

To those unfamiliar with Sicilian cheesecake, these are not at all like New York style. If you want a particularly sweet dessert, then you may not like this; however, if you enjoy something refreshing, slightly sweet and relatively low in calories, then this is awesome! According to my wife, whose family is Sicilian, this cake is exactly the right thing. I used about equal parts lemon extract and  grated orange peel, and it turned out great!

My husband made this cheesecake today. After reading the reviews, we knew to expect a different consistency. He chilled the cheesecake and served it with an orange glaze (fresh orange juice, confectioners' sugar, and hot water, with a lil food coloring). It was the perfect dessert, light and not too sweet. Will make again!

I followed the recipe exactly except I used lemon rind instead of orange because I didn't have an orange. The cake was perfect it lasted a day and a half with two boys and my husband. They loved it!
Thanks for a great recipe.

The easiest cheesecake I ever made, and one of the best! I used only 5 eggs, substituted the orange zest, cinnamon and salt with lemon extract (1 teaspoon), kept the vanilla, and added 1/3 cup of good Austrian rum. You may use any kind of rum, however, the Austrian kind (made from molasses, not sugar cane) is just my own favorite. I like the lighter texture and the more refreshing taste of ricotta cheese better than that of cream cheese, which I personally consider much too rich and heavy.
Update: I also found the following spices very good:
1 teaspoon lemon extract
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon rum or 1 teaspoon rum extract
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
omit salt, orange zest and cinnamon from the original recipe.

This was nice and light. I don't have a springform pan, so I made cupcakes (I halved the recipe and it filled 5 jumbo muffin tins). Baked at 350 for 45 minutes; cooked perfectly.  Lovely taste and texture, though those who expect it to taste like a traditional cheesecake need to look elsewhere! This is a light, fluffy and a bit grainy due to the ricotta. Another tip: instead of mixing in a bowl, blend everything together in a food processor. I also used pam for baking instead of buttering and flouring the pans, worked like a charm!

I used this recipe to bake my very first ricotta cheesecake and it was excellent - and soooo easy!!!  Ive grown up on the finest ricotta cheesecakes from award winning italian bakeries and homemade versions from old world italian grandmoms so I knew what I would be comparing this recipe to.  I dusted the top of mine with cinnamon after it was chilled which was the finishing touch.     I read comments below about draining the ricotta beforehand and a variation to include amaretto which I may try next time just to see how it turns out but this recipe is delicious and needs no tweeking...its as good as it gets on its own!

Way too eggy and I only used 5 eggs.  It's mostly tasteless and watery.  It's okay but I wouldn't make it again.  Disappointing.

Edited day later:  this got MUCH better overnight.  The flavors came out, the texture improved.  I added a star to my rating.  I may make again.  It is sublime with strawberry preserves on top.

This cheesecake was very good especially the next day.  Next time I will change a few things.  I added orange extract instead of orange zest and that made it taste too aromatic it was kind of like eating perfume.  I think next time I will either do orange zest like the recipe states or maybe lemon zest like a lot of others suggested.  I also think that it could use slightly more sugar (we sprinkled it with powdered sugar) and like others suggested I think I will be using less eggs.  I think 5 eggs would be plenty. Very good recipe though and I didn't feel guilty eating it.

Delicious recipe! worked out really well. feel free to modify what you want when it comes to flavors it really doesn't make a difference the the solidity of the cheesecake. Unfortunately I over cooked it because I thought it looked too soft, but it wasn't so be very aware not to over cook. I think its better to undercook than overcook. I made this for Thanksgiving and covered it in an oranged cranberry sauce and it was amazing!

Extremely authentic and absolutely delicious!  Couldn't have been easier to make, either.  Fresh orange zest is what really makes this cake.  This recipe is a definite keeper!

This is delicious as is and best warm out of the oven!  Surprisingly, I blind tasted fat free and regular ricotta versions of this with my mom, and we both liked the fat free taste better!  The regular was closer to the consistency of a cheesecake, but I liked to fluffiness of the fat free just fine.  Must try it warm... yum!

This is a Sicilian Cheesecake. If you have not grown up eating this, it is different, but for those of us who did, this is an amazing recipre! I agree, you need to add 1 teaspoon lemon zest and 3 teaspoons of amaretto.

I've had a special place in my heart for southern Italian cooking ever since I spent the summer after my junior year in high school in Caltanissetta, Sicilia as one of Rochester, NY's first two Sister City exchange students to Caltanissetta, and then spent another summer there two years later. In any event, I just made my first ricotta cake following this recipe, except that since I didn't happen to have oranges, lemons, or amaretto on hand, I substituted 1/2 tsp key lime zest, 1 1/2 tsp orange marmalade, and 2 tsp Citronge liquor (both the marmalade and Citronge are slightly bitter). While the flavor therefore couldn't have been exactly the same as that of the original recipe, it turned out great! Those who have never made a ricotta cake before may be disappointed by its texture, since the ricotta cake has a much more cake-like texture. On the other hand, the mildly custard-like flavor of this cake isn't likely to be annoying, since this isn't very pronounced. All in all, a delicious cake (and very easy to make)!  - hatlessacorn 6/30/10

I made this recipe using ingredients appropriate for the South Beach Diet. This included: part-skim ricotta, liquid egg substitute, and sugar substitute (splenda). So sure enough it tasted like a "diet" cheesecake. I wasn't too impressed. Stick with the original recipe and cheat on your diet!

This was a big hit!  I took the suggestions of others, used no cinnamon or orange.  Used lemon zest, cut the vanilla in half and used 3ts amaretto.  Served it with a berry sauce-frozen berries and oj simmered than put in a blender and strained.  Have made it a few times already.

Made this cheesecake with 2 15 oz tubs of ricotta, substitued the 2 tsp of orange rind with 1 tbsp of lemon rind and eliminated the cinnamon. I also decreased the flour by 1 tbsp, substituted the sugar with 16 packets of Sweet and Low and used 5 extra large eggs instead of 6 regular eggs. In a preheated oven, I baked it for 5 minutes less than called for. It was perfect! No sinking in the middle and beautifully browned around the edges. Wonderful served with a strawberry sauce!

Not too heavy or sweet.  Used lemon zest instead of orange.  Used Part Skim ricotta and did not drain liquid from ricotta.  This is almost as good as my Italian mom's cake.  Got compliments from my guests.  Thanks Nicole!

After reading all the reviews I decided to try this recipe with just one small change, using a teaspoon each of orange and lemon zest.  Oh, and the ricotta cheese I had on hand was low-fat.  I must say I was surprised by the results.  With the cinnamon, vanilla, and coarser ricotta texture, it reminded me more of a dense rice pudding or bread pudding than cheesecake.  I liked it, though!  I served it to guests with the question, "What does it need for a topping?" and someone made the excellent suggestion of drizzling just a little melted white chocolate and a spoonful of whole cranberry sauce over each piece.  Mmmmm, that sounds really yummy -- or better yet, lingonberries!  Anyway, I know I'll enjoy making this cheesecake and continuing to experiment with possible toppings.

I really enjoyed the recipe.  I used very dry homemade ricotta with a little bit of plain yogurt to add some moisture.  I used 4 eggs, and added 1/3 cup triple sec to the mixture.  Yummy!

I made this on Easter Sunday.  I knew not to expect "Cheesecake."  I really liked it.  Not too sweet.  Not too heavy.  I sprinkled powdered sugar over the top and then a little extra when plated.  Do not change a thing. Imagine cheesecake meets custard.  Delicious.

I made this recipe yesterday and it came out horrible.  I must have done something wrong... Mine was gritty, tasteless and the flour tasted like it hadn't cooked.  We had wonderful ricotta cheesecake in a restaurant a few days back that was out of this world...I'm so disappointed in mine.

Very nice recipe. I used home made ricotta, 5 eggs, and lemon zest. I did not have any orange zest, so I added a tablespoon of orange juice to the batter. I also used crushed shortbread cookies mixed with a little butter to make a bottom crust and topped the whole thing with a fresh blueberry sauce. This is a new family favorite.

Very easy and quick. It has a grittier texture than a cream cheese based cake, but it's much lighter.  It stores well in the fridge for days also.  I added the amaretto as suggested. Yummm!

Awesome.  Much lighter than the cream cheese version.  I made mine lemon instead of orange.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  This is refreshing after a full meal.  But then again, anything ricotta is fine by me!

Very easy and tasty.  Having celiac disease makes this even more appealing.  I just used gluten free flour blend in place of all purpose wheat based flour.  This makes baking more fun and creative. Thanks for the great recipe.....

This is a 'jewel' for your recipe box.
Easy to make, no fuss, no mess....Hint
large eggs are the norm in recipes if you have extra or jumbo then use one less egg...be sure to use whole milk ricotta to have texture...almost like a flan..not the typical 'heavy'texture of a juniors style cheese cake. Leave it to the Sicilians to provide the perfect dessert after a BIG Italian meal. Don't forget to make expresso and serve this cake with fresh berries in season and home made whipped cream...YUMMY thanx for the recipe...not bad on the waisline either!

I love this recipe!  I scaled it way back with only 250g of ricotta but I kept roughly the same amount of orange zest (smelled wonderful when I was grating it) and added a few spoonfuls of orange juice for extra kick and about a tsp of baking powder.

I altered this recipe to be a lemon-ricotta cheesecake by omitting the orange zest and cinnamon, reducing the vanilla to one teaspoon and adding 2 teaspoons of lemon zest, with a garnish of lemon twists on top.  quite good.

I made the following changes. I added two Tbs Orange Bloosom water and two tablespoons each of orange and citron candied peel. I also used orange and lemon zest.  I substituted mascarpone equally for 6 oz of ricotta. I used BelGioioso whole milk ricotta. I whisked the eggs quite a bit before adding to the ricotta mixture which I also blended quite well in a stand up mixer. At 300 degrees, it took almost 2 hours. It was fantastic!!

OK - my take on this one with slight modifications for those watching their calorie intake.  I didn't have enough ricotta - so I "3/4" the recipe.  Strange, but it worked.  I used part skim (I know some advised not to, but I took the chance bcs I didn't have anything else and hubby wanted dessert)  I did not take the time to drain it and it came out fine.  I used GV's sugar blend to cut the sugar down.  I didn't have orange but used lemon zest instead.  I forgot the salt but didn't miss it, really.  If you are looking for a cheesecake taste, you won't find it here.  But for a light dessert that is not too sweet but satisfying, this is the dessert for you.  I cooked it at 350 for an hour and 15 and it could have cooked for less time.  The consistency was slightly grainy because I hand mashed it.  (TV was on and I didn't want to use the blender.)  But it didn't really distract from the over all experience.  I thought it was good and was happy with the results.

I did not care for this recipe. I made it look really pretty but nobody wanted to eat it :-( I didn't expect it to be like cheesecake either.

Delicious! My husband (who is very picky!) loved it.  He said it tasted like a cross between cheesecake and flan.  Instead of orange zest I used the zest from 2 small lemons and the juice from 1 small lemon.  I also used 5 eggs because I had extra large eggs on hand. Definitely on our list of dessert favorites!

Simple and good! Not as smooth as the usual American cheesecake, but it's delicious in its own way. I just can't understand people who said that this is inedible. I made only a half recipe just to try, and used 2 eggs instead of 3, and I forgot to add Amaretto. Turned out really nice. My first ever cheese cake! Will definitely make this again. Next time with Amaretto.

This was was grainy and it was not even overcooked!  The flavor would have been fairly fine except the texture was bad. If you choose to make this, choose a specialty ricotta full fat cheese and (NOT regular grocery store) and blend it with a mixer.  A spatula really isn't going to get the little chunks out.  Either way I will NEVER make this again!  I like ricotta, but this was not edible!

Excellent and easy recipe.  Following everyone's suggestions, I reduced by 1 egg and substituted vanilla & salt for 3 TB amaretto.  Kept the cinnamon in.  Consistency and taste was excellent!

This was truly delicious--light, not too sweet. Following one suggestion here I used an electric beater to smooth the cheese mixture. I added an orange marmalade glaze, a nice taste contrast.

I followed the suggestion for substituting the amaretto for the cinn and zest. I drained the ricotta for two days prior to baking. The cake was easy to prepare, cooking time was 1 hour 40 mins. However I prepared it and served it within a 6 hour time frame and it was not well received. "Too bland" was the comment :( This morninghowever, after sitting in the refridgerator over night, it is bursting with flavor! I give this a five star rating but advise....prepare ahead and refridgerate over night.

Turned out alright but not great--tasted a little bland. I did use low fat ricotta though, so that may have been a problem.

I made this for easter and it was very good. I am not sure about the number of eggs. I read that some people have said here in the reviews to use only 5 eggs. I think I should have done that too, but it does not say what size eggs are to be used in the recipe. Any advise here?

This is delicious and easy and you could probably use it as a dessert on the South Beach Diet. It is lighter than a traditional NY cheesecake. I omitted the orange extract and used splenda to sweeten. I topped with whipped cream and strawberries for my husband.

This is a great recipe IF you drain the ricotta in a cheesecloth lined strainer for 6 hours first. Otherwise it has a damp texture that ruins the crust. I add more lemon zest, also.

I looked for the perfect recipe for many years,  and ever since I found this recipe a couple of years ago, I have made it upon request for every Christmas and especially for my in laws birthdays. Don't change a thing,  this is tried and true,  good old fashioned sicilian (and sometimes Italian) cheesecake!  Deeeelicious!

This recipe was good but I have tasted better. I made this for my son as he requested a ricotta cheesecake.  The recipe i regularly use is pretty labor intensive in comparison to this one so i figured i would save myself some effort and try this one.  It was not terrible just not what we are used to.  I think the lemon zest overpowers the flavor of the cheese.  My son requested that I make my regular recipe next time.

I did make some changes, but only because of personal taste.  I didn't add the cinnamon and I used lemon zest instead of the orange. I skipped the vanilla and used limoncello instead.  All in all a good cheesecake.

I was short on ricotta so I substituted 1/2 cottage cheese which I had blended in the food processor, but I followed the recipe other than that but with 5 eggs and with the addition of 1 tspn of lemon zest. 
The cheesecake was good but I was a bit disappointed since I was trying to recreate a ricotta cheesecake I had just in a restaurant the night before, which seemed richer and slightly sweeter, but I probably should reserve full judgement until I make the recipe as printed (yes I hate to be one of those people!)  I have to think that it could do with perhaps 2 or 3 tbspn more sugar.

so delicous!!  i have the flavor of my grandmother's cheesecake in my memory, so my alterations were in an attempt to replicate hers.  she always made this was a fresh pasta crust - sounds bizarre but it wouldn't be easter pie without it.  use the basic pasta recipe from this site, roll out thinly, and lay in the pan like a pie crust dough.  to this recipe i omitted the cinnamon, subbed anise extract for the vanilla extract, omitted the orange zest, and added one shot of rum.  thank you for a great recipe!

Really good tasting cheesecake. Not at all a New York style cheesecake, has a flavor and texture that reminds me of bread pudding... We are going to make this again with more cinnamon and plumped raisins! Still, really good. It was great drizzled with organic honey and topped with whipped cream...

Followed receipe to a t, with the exception of the eggs.  Used 5 instead. Ended up more custardy, eggy than creamy cheesy which was what i was expecting.  baked nicely, but will not make again.

Delicious!  Followed Donna's suggestions and this cake was even better than those I have purchased in the bakery!  I made it for my husband, but I ate almost the whole cake!

Practically perfect.  I did add a few tablespoons of candied orange peel and only half a cup of sugar to make it more like my grandmother's cheesecake.  Like a previous reviewer, I had to bake this for one hour 45 minutes.  Serve with fresh fruit, it's the best...

Very easy to make and taste great. My husband is
diabetic so I used Splenda. Also omitted the
orange zest as other reviewers had suggested.
It is definately a desert to make again.

WOW! I have been looking for this cheesecake for 40 years. Light and cakey. I used the zest from 1 orange and 1 lemon, and 1 tsp. Vanilla extract. No other changes. It needed the full 1 1/2 hour in the 300 degrees oven. I will use a dollop of sour cream for the topping like my mother did, but ANY topping at all might be overkill.

I read a lot of the reviews posted and I was torn between making this cheese cake and Buddy Valastro's, so I combined the two. I used 3 pounds of whole milk ricotta, 2/3 cup of sugar 4 egg yolks, teaspoon of vanilla, 3 Tablespoons of amaretto and the rind of two medium lemons. Mixed them together in the kitchen aid mixer.  I whipped the egg whites and folded them in the mixture.  Preheated oven to 450 and when I was ready to put it in, lowered it to 300. Baked for 1 hour. Turned the oven off, left it in for 1 hour with the door slightly ajar. Done. Very creamy and delicious.

This was wonderful.  I lost my late mother-in-laws recipe  and this definitely reminded us of hers.  After reading reviews I too added the 3 tsps of amaretto  and used the orange marmalade glaze.  We loved it, thank you for sharing.

I've never made any type of cheesecake before because I don't like the tang of cream cheese in a dessert-- but recently had ricotta cake at a restaurant and loved it-- the key being no cream cheese. I made this in my kitchenaid mixer-- used 5 eggs instead of 6, lemon zest instead of orange, just a small pinch of cinnamon and added a pinch of nutmeg.  Only had a 9 inch springform-- baked it for about 80-90 minutes and when a bubble started to form in the oven I popped it a toothpick as another website had said to do.  Taste and texture was excellent!

Update July 2017: I wanted this to brown on top-- and saw a recipe for the same ricotta cake but browned.  Basically I baked the cake at 400 degrees F (or 200ish C) for the first 30 minutes on convection (which wasn't necessary, but I did)-- and at 15 minutes in I turned it half way so it would brown evenly. Then after the first 30 min, I lowered the heat to like 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) and baked another 30 min. I stuck a sharp knife in the middle and it came out clean so that was that-- and it came out fabulous. 

One other side note: this last time I only had one lemon (instead of orange) for zest, so I used 1 tsp lemon zest and about 1/4 cup of limoncello. Came out amazing!

I am now gluten free.  I simply substituted gluten free corn starch (no flour).  I used 4 large eggs instead of 5 (as some reviewers suggested) or 6 (in recipe), and just 1/2 cup of white sugar (instead of 2/3 cup). The results were just fine.

i made my Italian Cheesecake into a Canolli Pie.  Used dry amaretto cookies for the base, added chocolate chips in my filling, crushed some roasted pistachios to place along the sides, and topped each slice with a cherry.  Plainning to play with the presentation a bit more before i think of entering a contest with it.

The only downside was it took long to cook.  Still playing to see if it was due to the extra ingredients or not.  Overall, not a bad dessert, since i normally don’t eat cheesecakes.

This is a horrible recipe. I was embarrassed when my guests tried this because everyone took one bite and left the rest. It is under-sweetened, has too much egg in it, making it very grainy, and it did not have enough flavor. Everyone who likes it and gives it 5 stars is changing the ingredients significantly -- so then you DON'T like the recipe, don't give it a high rating if you have to overhaul the whole thing.

I made another ricotta cheesecake that was part ricotta and part cream cheese. It also called for lemon juice, only 4 eggs, and more sugar. It was delicious just like our favorite one from an Italian restaurant. Search for a recipe that combines ricotta with cream cheese.

Light, not too sweet but flavorful.  I made it pretty much as written - the only thing I changed was that I strained whole milk ricotta through cheesecloth to get some liquid out of it, and omitted the vanilla and added a couple tablespoons of Cointreau.  I think I would add another tablespoon - the flavor is there but it could be a little less subtle.  It's delicious though - definitely will make again!

This cake is sooo easy to make and pretty yummy too just as long as you don't think this cake will be like a new york cheesecake. I followed some of the other tips and added two tablespoons of amaretto, I didn't have an orange in the house for fresh rind so I used orange extract and fresh lemon rind. I really feel like you need to have the lemon and orange flavor. I like the fact that it was pretty much a one bowl recipe. Easy clean up!

Don't change a thing!  If you squeeze out the water ...you should just make a regular cream cheese cheesecake to start with!  I like the lemon zest sometimes and the orange others...it is the best cheesecake.  I make ricotta cookies and decorate the top with pretty cut out cookies with christmas sprinkles or jimmies. We are a cheese cake loving family.  My Mother and sister-in-law, we all make goat cheese cheese cakes, regular New York type, this one is tops!

Bland and no flavor.  I even allowed the cheesecake to sit for a day in the fridge.  The flavors never came through.  I've had fabulous Ricotta cheesecake, and this didn't even compare.

Very good.  I added a little orange liquer which I think worked nice.  Next time I won't bake it as long as I did this time 1 1/2 hour.  I think it would have been best at 1 hour.

This is a great recipe for a light cheesecake.  It's not heavey at all.  I did make a strawberry sauce to over a slice.  Even my ten month daughter enjoyed it (without the sauce of course).  Buy frozen strawberries, food process them until smooth and then boil them for 10 minutes, whiling bowling add powedered sugar to taste.  of course you can also make a chocolate saucefor this but we prefered the fruity one.  I mixed chocolate and strawberry sauces together and that was pretty good.  Also, I put one teaspoon vanilla extract and one teaspoon orange extract.

i have to agree with another reviewer that the cake was a little bland. Next time i will add raisins and double the zest,even add lemon zest.I liked that it waasn't too sweet(i took a reviewer's suggestion to cut the sugar a bit). it's a good starting point recipe to experiment with,but on it's own...it needs a little something for me.

Make sure you try this recipe with the orange zest and cinnamon.  With the zest of an entire orange it gets 5 stars.  I used 6 large eggs and it was fine.

I love this recipe!  I made it for my husband's birthday and it was a huge success.  I omitted the cinnamon based on the other reviews and used lemon instead of orange.  It could have been a lot more lemony, so I think next time I will add lemon extract and another lemon's worth of zest, too.  So light and delicious!  Our new favorite.

Made this cake for my  dad (Italian) and he loved it. I've made it several times since and once for his 80th bday party. Always gets rave reviews. Not your typical sacchrine sweet american dessert which is exactly what makes it wonderful. Delicate and refined. Love it! Thanks for sharing!!!!

Let the cake cool in the oven to avoid cracking.

We have made this Cheesecake dozens of times, it's a favorite  at our house as it's so easy to make, even with the kids. We normally use 3lb Ricotta cheese and leave the rest of the recipe as is. 
Once we added some coco powder, also came out great. Recently we have replaced regular flower with coconut flower and also came out delicious.

Very easy and excellent outcome.  Sorry no photo.  I followed the recipe except for the orange zest.  I used lime instead.

well when i make something from scratch i REALLY make it from scratch, lol....first i made ricotta from scratch from our goats milk..Then i made this and it was super easy...i also made a orange glaze to poor overt top .....since i make ricotta every week i need ways to use it up so this one will be used a lot and you could top it with anything really chocolate sauce or raspberry sauce or icing or whipped cream or fruit the possibilities are endless

not sure what I did wrong...maybe it was the no name ricota. Flavor is good but was crumbly like a quiche texture more than the silky smooth cheese cake texture I was expecting

made it and loved it, although my teenage son and husband weren't in love with the taste. I said cheesecake and they expected something similar to a new York cheesecake. it's so good I'll make it again for myself.

light, fluffy, delicious! I actually had a brick of cream cheese and only 16 oz of ricotta...i added 1/4 c sour cream and placed all of this on a graham cracker crust. I baked it at 330 for 1 hrs. It did crack and i noted that no water bath was required BUT I think as it is for all cheesecakes I make, I always use a water bath...I will make this again!

I have made this with 1 change.  I used lemon zest instead of orange.  I cooked it in a water bath for 2hrs and it came out perfect.  My friend, who is Italian, enjoyed it so much she asked me to make 1 for her  as part of her Thanksgiving Dinner.  I had small dishes with different toppings so people can add which ever topping they like.  I had cherry, pineapple and chocolate out for the people.

Ok, as a Sicilian and one who's made many ricotta cheesecakes I'm baffled by this recipe. First, I always try to make the recipe as written but I just couldn't. An authentic Ricotta cheesecake does not have cinnamon- that's just weird. So I omitted that. Next is Italian baking in general is lemon everything. So if you want authentic do away with the orange. If you really wanted to add something else a little amaretto or almond extract, along with the lemon and fresh lemon zest is perfect. The worst part that baffles me is the 6 eggs. That's way too many. I used the 6 and it made it taste eggy, almost like a quiche it reminded me of. I would say 4 large eggs is plenty. For some reason the cake didn't rise. It was about 1.5" tall after baked. I've never had that happen out of dozens of cheesecakes I've made. I have a convection oven, no problems. The texture was how it should be but it tasted like eggs to me. Gross. Now the cook time/ temp is perfect. If you bake it in a bath and foil the bottom of pan you'll reduce the risk of cracks.  Also, after times up turn the oven off and leave it in there without opening the door for 2 hours. Then let it cool for at least 4 hours or if you can overnight. You'll have a perfect top. I would not make this again there's too many tweeks to make. Keep looking.

This recipe is really easy and taste so good it truly is an Italian cheese cake.  To the  person who said she made it and no one liked  you have to realize that is how  some Italian desserts are especially ones made with ricotta.  They have just the right amount of sweetness.  I stuck to the recipe except I did add the amaretto and I left the orange zest in also I did not squeeze the liquid from the ricotta. Turned out perfect.  I served it with blue berries and raspberries and drizzled la lechera (canned nexican sweet milk kinda like sweeten condensed milk) added  just a little more sweetness. Thanks for the recipe :)

This is wonderful as it is, but I made a few changes, adjusting the recipe by adding three teaspoons of amaretto and decreasing the vanilla to one tablespoon. I also used orange zest and lemon zest. It took 1:45 to bake, but it is worth the wait. We topped this with strawberries, creating a wonderful Easter dinner dessert that wasn't overly sweet. My great grandmother Italia surely would approve. Thank you for sharing this treasure.

I liked the recipe as I enjoy Italian cakes and cookies.  Please note this is not anything like a NY cheesecake, it is not as creamy or sweet.  This is more close to a cannoli type texture.  I reduced 6 eggs to 5 eggs as others suggested and I omitted the orange zest as I do not like citrus flavor in my desserts.  I also made sure to use Sorrento whole milk ricotta cheese.  The texture came out very nice.  I think I may omit cinnamon next time and try adding a little rum flavor instead.

This recipe is just what I was looking for.  I did make a few changes... I drained the ricotta for several hours before starting. I omitted the cinnamon and added 1 tsp of lemon zest with the orange zest.  Everyone loved it.

Very pleased with how it turned out. Made it with five eggs, no cinnamon, and not quite enough orange zest.  Some of my family found the taste too subtle, but two of us really liked it. Want to make it with amaretto next time. Nice easy recipe. Baked it over an hour and a half (old oven though), and the cake browned up quite a bit after I took it up after I took it out. Glad it was noted that the cake falls a fair bit, as it does. Was good to know that in advance.

Absolutely amazing!  Not too sweet, lovely texture.  Nice and dense.  I used 1 1/2 tsp orange zest and 1 1/2 tsp of lemon zest.  I did try 3 tsp of amaretto, but think I will less or none next time; the citrus flavor would definitely be enough.  Yes, please drain the ricotta (then one can use 6 eggs).

I made this recipe on more then 1 occasion. Easy to make and taste is great.  My boyfriend and his family are hardcore Italian and they enjoyed every bit of the cake.  I didn't modify in anyway except for the crust and added cherry topping.

This is the easiest and most delicious cake ever!  We loved the lightness of it and I made a strawberry glaze to go over it.  A keeper for sure.  I followed other reviewers' recommendations and used 5 eggs.

It was OK, this was very grainy.  Will try a recipe that includes some cream cheese next time, and use a food processor for a smoother taste.

I made it with 5 eggs, 1 cup of sugar and added 3 tablespoons of Amaretto.  Otherwise I followed the recipe. I served it with an orange curd.  It was delicious and will become a regular on our dessert menu.  A truly easy and tasty recipe.

This recipe is super easy even for a non baker such as me.  Use 5 eggs instead of 6 and full fat ricotta.  Other than that, it was perfect and yummy.

Very easy with great results.  I suggest measuring the cinnamon, and zest generously.  Also a mix of lemon and orange zest worked well.  Quality of your cheese matters, I used Biazzo ricotta.

Sorry, this was too bland for our taste, even with the suggested Marmalade topping.
