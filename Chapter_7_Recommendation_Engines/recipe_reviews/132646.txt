If you use extra virgin olive oil in place of the vegetable oil, it will be spectacular...I promise.  I love bagna calda with endive lettuce leaves (if you can find them) and red peppers, but when the calda gets cold and thick, it makes a fantastic spread for bread or tortillas.

Wow, yes olive oil makes it spectacular!  Also, the sardines I had on hand were packed in hot sauce, not oil...added a nice kick to this.

It's even better if you use FRESH anchovies and the extra virgin olive oil

This is a family recipe from my grandfather who grew up in Asti. We use extra virgin olive oil and a stick of butter. No sardines, but anchovies packed in sea salt and well rinsed. Very hard to find, but well worth it. Try dipping thin strips of a very tender beef steak. Out of this world!

Use your best olive oil instead of vegetable oil. My father-in-law made this every Christmas Eve for 20 years in his electric skillet. Sometimes he'd add heavy creme to smooth it out. Serve with nice Italian bread, romaine lettuce and whole celery sticks. Dip your lettuce or celery and catch the drippings with your bread. So, so good! Makes the house smell like garlic for days!

It turned out perfectly and it was delicious!  Instead of butter, I used Country Crock Churn Style.

Just served this for a Chistmas Day in-between.  A success, even with the one who'd never eaten sardines before.
