My blue heaven, this is so yummy!  I doubled the recipe and took it to a potluck.  Thankfully, there was a serving or two leftover to bring home.  The combination of flavors works so well, and curry just takes it over the top.  Thank you SkyBlue1963.

My first review.. I have to review it, I loved it! I made it exactly as listed. I love a combination of textures and tastes, and this salad was soo satisfying.. crisp celery, juicy grapes, crunchy nuts, perfectly done turkey, hint of onion, crunchy/juicy apple. I've already made another batch. And the dressing was perfect.

As tempting as it may be, don't mess around with this recipe too much.  It is fabulous!!  I made the dressing as-is, but used 1/2 fat free mayo and 1/2 fat free sour cream because I tripled the recipe and ran out of mayo.  I stuck my finger in the dressing and tasted it . . . and I got a bit nervous because I wasn't sure this was going to work at all.  I almost threw it out but I decided to see it through as see where this recipe was going.  No turkey on hand, so I oven baked 3 large breasts with olive oil, salt, and pepper - about 30 minutes.  I also only had glazed walnuts, so I chopped them very fine, threw them in, and crossed my fingers that they wouldn't be too sweet.  I held my breath and pulled it all together.  WOW!  WOW!! WOW!!!  I'm telling you - the pop of the curry, the zing of the vinegar, the bite of the red onion, the sweet of the fruit, and the salty-peppery chicken was AMAZING.  The glazed walnuts added a fun "nut candy" effect that we loved.  It is a bit of work to put this together, so make sure you make ALOT of it so you can enjoy it more than once.  I have a little left over and can't wait to try it tomorrow after the flavors have really had a chance to blend.  Thank you SKYBLUE1963!!

I made a few substitutions just to make due with what I had. I used a pomegranate instead of the grapes, pistachios instead of walnuts, and red wine vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar. I also omitted celery.

It came out yummy - I did make the mistake of adding salt, though. It didn't need any salt. The curry powder is a nice touch.

I was prepared for my family to like it and for me to think it was just Ok.  Wrong and wrong.  It was great, we loved it!  It was one of the best salads I've made.  I made as instructed with just a few minor changes.  Used left over turducken from Christmas, added more mayo, 2 dashes of chipotle pepper (we like heat) and substituted gram masala for the curry (don't think we've found the right brand yet).  I'll be making this again for the next holiday with family.

followed the recipe exactly and it was awesome. I didn't let it sit and it was good, even better after sitting in the fridge for a few hours.

My turkey that was leftover from Thanksgiving was smoked, which gave this salad a very nice flavor. Definitely allow time for the flavors to blend, and make sure your curry is reasonably fresh.

Excellent! I used pecans instead of walnuts....my only complaint is that it didn't make enough! Next time I will double the recipe. I was a little suspicious about the curry, but it worked really well...I can't imagine the salad without it. Delicious!

I am not wild about chicken salad but I must say this one was really good. I took it to a potluck and everyone wanted the recipe. I used chicken because I did not have turkey but other than that, made it as written. It was really good!

This is awesome! The only change I made was out of necessity. I had to skip the apple as I didn't have one but even before refrigerating this was so delicious. I will be making again soon... I can always make with a rotisserie chicken next time, but this turkey version is amazing. Thanks for the recipe!

This is one of our favorites.  We serve with Ritz crackers and the flavor of the buttery, salty crackers combines perfectly with the fresh taste of the Waldorf salad.  Must try this one....

This is awesome! My husband roasted a 30lb turkey for us this weekend, and I kept thinking...ugh, turkey for days. But with this recipe, I will eat it everyday! I made this as written except for omitting the celery (hubs doesn't like it) and I used almonds because that's what I had on hand. The curry adds such an awesome punch to this recipe. Definitely a keeper!

This was really good! I had some leftover turkey from Thanksgiving, just enough to make a half-recipe. There seemed to be so much crunch going on that when it came time to add the apple, I just did a few tblsps. I also added a little extra sugar. I found that it really needed a little salt, so a few shakes before serving really made a big difference. Thanks for the great recipe that I'm sure to make again!

My husband is pretty finicky and doesn't like turkey but I made this last year with leftovers and lo and behold, he asked for it again this year. It's a holiday miracle! Didn't change anything.

I made this with the ingredients I had on hand.  Substituted dried cranberries and apricots for the fruit, and pumpkin seeds for the walnuts.  I'm not a big fan of curry powder, but decided to give it a try anyway, with a little pinch of cayenne for some heat.  It was so yummy!  Can't wait to have it  again for lunch tomorrow!  Thanks for all the substitution tips.   So helpful.

Absolutely delicious!  I left out the walnuts because my husband isn't a fan of nuts in his food.  It didn't matter one bit.  I put the salad in pita pockets and they were an instant hit.   I will be making this salad every time I have leftover turkey!

I used sour cream instead of mayonnaise and red wine vinegar instead of cider vinegar.  I also used chicken instead of turkey.  It definitely had a curry flavor!  I will definitely make this again.  I also got 6 servings out of this, as the recipe states.  The only thing I think that would improve it would be more parmesan.
