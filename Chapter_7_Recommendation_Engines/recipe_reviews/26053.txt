My friends mother made a plum kuchen when we were kids and nothing can beat her recipe but this comes close enough to earn my 5 stars! As far as the custard part of it...it's not supposed to have alot of custard which would, in my opinion make it way to rich. It is supposed to be a more simple, light dessert. That's the way she says they made it when she grew up in switzerland.

I used a bunt pan, sugar coated the plums, and double up on the custard but used light cream instead of heavy cream. This is great recipe easy to make, and cake part turned out nice and moist. So I give it a 5 star

I used Pluot Plums on the top.  If your plums are getting too ripe - make this dessert.  I used to make this dessert with a crumb topping - but this custard version is surprisingly good.  I served it warm with vanilla ice cream.  We all thought that it reminded us of deep dish rubarb pie.  I guess it was the sweet and sour taste. mmm...

A delicious kuchen if you prefer custard desserts, I thought it was better than the gourmet recipes.

This is fantastic.  Use Italian plums...these are better for cooking and provide the "tart" to balance the sweetness of the custard.  I, too, doubled the custard as recommended and it worked great--just needed extra baking time.  Next time I would only use 3/4 cup sugar in the custard, though.   A whole cup was too sweet.  Great recipe!!

I couldn't find fresh plums in the middle of winter, so used canned instead and added the plums with custard at the end.  It looked kind of ugly, but tasted good.  I will try again with fresh plums when they are in season.

My friends mother made something similar when we were kids. Nothing will ever beat her original recipe which she made with more of a pie or tart crust but this comes pretty close so I have to give it a 5 stars.

YUM.  I made 1/2 a recipe and sprayed the glass pan.  The result was the cake/plums floated when I put in the custard.  The mistake/result was very pretty though.  The plums were on top giving it a nice color.  I used 1/2 a can of store canned plums in my halved recipe.

This is so simple to make and so much flavor!! I love German recipies and this one fits the bill. I made it with yellow plums. It isn't overly sweet but just enough. I heated it up and served it with whipped cream but it is good cold too. I rated it a 5 mostly for the quality that you get for not too much work.

I didn't have a 9x9" pan, so I used a small rectangular glass baking dish and it worked fine. I used plums from my garden. This was so easy and such a delight to make. My boyfriend and I love it, just as it is. I don't think it needs more custard, it has just enough to hold it all together. It would be great served with vanilla ice cream I'm sure, but we like it chilled. I have a feeling this may become a holiday favorite if we can find plums in the colder months :) Thank you for posting this recipe

Very nice dessert which could be adjusted for a lot of different fruits. I doubled the custard - i also topped with a little sugar at the end and popped under the broiler for two minutes to make a creme brûlée type top. The cake underneath is more like a crust or a not-very-sweet cookie, but since the custard is sweet its ok. Made in a nine inch round pan since I don't have nine inch square - turned out fine just took a couple minutes longer to cook. Might consider a little cinnamon next time, or I like the idea a few people had of using almond extract instead of vanilla. I had to use half and half because thats what was in the house, but that worked fine.

Yum! Easy, quick, and so good! I've also made the version without custard, which was also good, but the custard makes it a little less dry and quite delicious. I preferred it cold. I also used half and half instead of whipping cream (that was what I had in the fridge) and it came out just fine.

I doubled the custard which is very similar to Creme Brulee.   The cake was very moist and all in all, it's now one of my top desserts!   My husband asked for to add more plums next time- maybe double up the layer.  Can't wait to make it again.  Super easy- great choice for dinner parties!

Where did I go wrong?. The base was like a bread pudding. May be the yellow plums were too ripe and juicy. I doubled the custard as suggested. I increased the cooking time a little. Over all quite a good dessert, although different from what I expected.

This recipe was excellent!  I suggest coating your plums in sugar if they are not very ripe, and definitely double or triple the custard recipe.  I served it in a bowl with milk (or ice cream would be good too).

I tried using both plums and banana for the fruit filling.  i liked the banana much better.  Also, I added almonds on top of the fruit and topped it with fresh whipped cream flavored with almond extract.  it was a great dessert.

My mother made Kuchen, always with fresh farm cream and fresh eggs. if you can get these I guarantee it makes a world of difference..
Paech, prune and any other soft type fillings work.

Yummy custard! I usually love my desserts warm but I really enjoyed these better cooled. The only thing I disliked about this recipe is the crust. Double the custard for sure. I also had a little bit of white chocolate chips left so I decided to melt them with the cream in the microwave before adding the rest. (fyi: my pic shows stacked)

The taste was great but the crust was too hard for my liking. Also I followed the recommendation to double the custard which made the cake too soggy and runny, even though I baked it for about 20 minutes longer! all in all, it tasted good but not the best.

Scrumptious - this was a great way to use of some of our plums from our tree. I decreased the sugar to 1/3 cup as my household doesn't prefer too sweet and it was perfect. I didn't have heavy cream and used milk instead. There aren't any leftovers.

I substituted self-rising flour and omitted the baking powder.  I also cut the sugar to 1/3 cup in the whipping cream because I like it tart.  It was excellent.

I followed the recipe but took advice about the custard. I doubled the custard and added 1tbs cornstarch as I had extra plums and WOW it is so good. Will make again with any fruit coming in season.

I will definitely make this again. I may have used the wrong kind of plum, making the dish a little wet between the cake and the custard. I'm going to try it with apples.

The only thing I changed was using evaporated milk instead of the heavy cream. I usually substitute half & half for heavy cream, but was out of it. It worked fine. I used black plums because that's what I had. This cake is a nice blend of tart and sweet. We liked it both warm and cold. I think it is fine without doubling the custard. I'm not a fan of really sweet desserts, and doubling the custard might make it too sweet as others have suggested. I will definitely make this again. I think it would be good with other fruits as well, such as peaches and nectarines.

I doubled the custard also and reduced sugar in custard by using some Now Better Stevia powder.  Everyone enjoyed it.  I'll make it again.

This was awesome! I doubled the custard, and cooked it for about 12 min longer.

The crust was a little bit too dry for my liking.
