We make this every single year for Christmas dessert - its just that good.  So rich and creamy,  a little "boozy" from the Grand Marnier and fantastic as an accompaniment to a slice of simple pound cake or almond Scandinavian cake.  Its also very, very pretty and elegant in a glass trifle dish.  We garnish with peeled, separated oranges.
