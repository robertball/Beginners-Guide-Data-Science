Mmm, these are so good.  Definitely for lovers of banana bread.  I used 1/4 of applesauce instead of the same amount of Crisco, and half brown sugar instead of white.  So, so so tasty.

Tweaked the recipe a bit to make them a really yummy low fat treat by cutting the butter in half, and substituting the remainder with apple sauce.  Also added a cup & half of raisins/craisins and some flax seeds.  They came out awesome!

These cookies were wonderful!  I didn't use the nuts; I used a little extra oats instead.  A great use of overripe bananas.  I cooked them at 375 for 10-12 minutes and they turned out perfect.  I will definately make them again.

Very good and easy. I substituted pecans for the walnuts and they were delicious.  Watch the time on these- I thought they were done at 9 minutes.

These cookies turned out really well.  I agree that 15 minutes is too long to bake them.  I made them healthier by substituting 1/2 applesauce for shortening, 1/2 whole wheat flour, and 1/2 brown sugar.  My 2 year old son and husband both love them!

They were ok..used coconut instead of nuts, found that 15 mins at 400 was allitle much, 9 or 10 mins would have done it.

Being a chocolate lover I added chocolate chips and left out the walnuts.  My oven is new and they baked fine at 14 - 15 minutes @ 400.

Made these with some banana's I had sitting on the counter I had forgotten.  Made them and everyone loved them, in fact had to make copies since they wanted to make them themselves.  Couldn't be better than that.

Just made these with my 5 year old. Easy and VERY good! Baked for 11 minutes and they came out perfectly. I left out the nuts and increased the oats to 2 cups.

I thought these cookies were pretty good, slightly cakelike, but good.  I left out the nuts only because I didn't have them in the house at the time and added chocolate chips instead.  I thought the 400 degree oven was too hot and ended up changing it to 350 for 15 minutes.

Made some adjustments as well.  1/4 butter and 1/2 cup applesauce instead of shortening.  Added some flax and used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 all purpose.  For the sugar, did 1/2 cane sugar and half brown sugar.  Added some raisins for a dash of extra fruit.  Added a touch of vanilla to the egg.  Toddler is currently eating it still warm and fresh from the oven.  Tastey!!

I loved these- for me the texture was a cross between a muffin top and a cookie. I made a few changes from what I had on hand. Added mini Chocolate chips, used 2 ripe bananas and left out the nuts, nutmeg and cinnamon. I am addicted to these great banana flavor, very moist and a nice change from banana bread.

Meh.  Not the most exciting cookie but a decent alternative use for mature bananas. I omitted the shortening (yuck) and substituted homemade applesauce.  Perhaps that's why this recipe was so one dimensional.  These are really spongy, cakey little guys.  In fact, it might be a nice muffin batter....  Anyway, I added a hefty dose of raisins to the second and third batch and they were much better.    Several days later:  My preschooler devoured these cakies.  After substituting applesauce for shortening and reducing the sugar, these cakies turned out to be a pretty high-fiber, moderately nutritious snack.  On storing:  they seemed to sweat a bit in tupperware.  They got a bit sticky but, like I said, our kid is over the moon for them!

I was looking for a way to use up some ripe bananas and oats and am glad I came across this recipe. These are yummy cake-like cookies! Since we are also trying to eat healthier I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 all purpse flour. I also substituted 1/2 c. brown sugar for 1/2 of the sugar and used coconut instead of nuts (personal preference) as one user suggested. I also decided to add 1/2 tsp vanilla to the egg/banana mixture, but you could add up to 1 tsp. I thought it added a nice flavor. Also, being the chocolate lover that I am I added in a few chocolate chips to my last batch of cookies. Next time I might try substituting applesauce for the shortening to make it even healthier. I too found that about 9-10 minutes at 400 degrees was plenty of cooking time. Thanks for a great recipe!

Having some elderly bananas on hand I decided to give this recipe a try. Yummmy, these are wonderful!  I made a couple of changes to the recipe as written.  I creamed the shortening, egg, sugar and banana together and then added the dry ingredients.  I used pecans in place of walnuts, due to allergies.  I also added 1 tsp. of vanilla.  I ended up with 4 1/2 dozen cookies, which I'm sure will disappear as soon as the family comes home.  Wonderful banana taste without being overpowered by the oatmeal in a soft cookie.  I would recommend watching the baking time.  15 minutes would've been too long in my oven; my batches averaged about 11 minutes.  Thank you for a tasty recipe!!

I altered these slightly but dang they are good! They turned out really muffin like in texture, but they're still yum. I personally don't like using shortening, so I used 1/4 cup butter and a half cup of applesauce in its place, I also cut the sugar down to about 3/4C. Thank you for this great recipe!!!

Delicious cookies.  For health concerns, I had to substitute the shortening for becel olive oil margarine and the egg for "egg creation" liquid egg white, but it worked out perfectly. 
I did add chocolate chips and 1tsp cocoa for my chocolate craving but I'm sure they would have been delightful without it. 
The texture is soft and yes cake like, but I like them this way. A perfect little desert.
My baking time was 10min but then again my oven is not new and tends to bake a little hotter.
I gave it 4 stars because of the changes, but a definite 5 stars for taste.
Thanks so much.

Yummy! They remind me of the cookies my mom used to make. Like little bites of banana bread. In fact, if I call them "Banana Oatmeal cookies" my kids won't eat them. But if I call them "Banana Bread Bites" they gobble them up!

LOVE this recipe.  I agree they are not like regular, hard cookies but they have so much flavor!  My son is highly allergic to dairy so finding recipes that do not call for milk or butter is difficult.  I skipped the nuts since he's not ready for those either and they were still great!  I did add a touch of vanilla and dash of honey as well.    This is definitely a keeper and nice to have other options for leftover bananas. Thanks!

What a great cookie! I love bananas, hubby loves oatmeal....I came out the winner in this one. Doesn't take too "oatmealish". Tastes more like banana bread. No matter, hubby enjoyed them just as much as I did. I followed the recipe exactly on this one and wouldn't change a thing.

These are YUMMY! Very cake-like and moist. Super easy and fast cooking. I used applesauce instead of an egg and the batter is just as delicious (and safe!) as the end product. =) Highly recommended recipe!

This is an awesome cookie. Don't swap butter for the Crisco; it's much heavier and will change the taste and texture, competing with the banana flavor. When baked on parchment at 400, the bottoms were brown after 8-9 minutes. These cookies are cake-like and do not spread much, so you can add that extra row on the cookie sheet without overlap. I added 1/2 cup golden raisins. Next time I'll increase the nutmeg to 1/2 teas and the cinnamon to 1 full teaspoon. I brought them to work and everyone raved.

Love these!  They are a great way to use up ripe bananas.  Remind me of banana nut muffin tops.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used pecans instead of walnuts.  I will consider adding raisins in the future.

This is a great recipe; a nice change from banana bread. I didn't have the nuts so I added extra oats, though I will try them with nuts the next time I make these. They were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. After I put one cookie sheet in the oven, I added raisins and flax seeds to the remaining dough. Both versions were awesome.

Delicious! I replaced 1/4 cup of the shortening with apple sauce and cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup. They came out great. More of a muffin texture than a cookie but still great! Made some for a friend and her two year old daughter loved them!

I wanted a Gluten free option to use up my old bananas.   Used 1/4 cup applesauce cut down on the butter, 1/2 & 1/2 white/brown sugar, mini chocolate chips, added some baking spice and  1/2 tsp. vanilla.  Used gluten free all purpose baking flour and gluten free oats.  Seemed a bit runny but spooned it out in small amounts made the perfect size cookie and was not cakey.  Used wax paper because they seemed a bit sticky but baked until the edges were really brown and they came out great.  Not dry or hard.  Just right.  Yummy!!!

I thought these were delicious! Loved the cakey texture. I subsituted chocolate chips instead of nuts, and used half butter/half applesauce, instead of shortening. Cooked for bout 12-13 minutes. Boyfriend and my mother loved them! Both are health freaks and gobbled them up when i told them they were on the "low fat" side. Def will make again

This is great cookie recipe to use over-ripe bananas. I replaced half of flour with whole wheat flour, reduced sugar to 3/4cup, butter to 1/2cup. I used 1tsp baking soda and 1/2tsp salt. I flatten the dough with the back of spoon as suggested, the cookies come out crunchy outside and soft inside.

They tasted just like banana bread, to the point that I wound up asking myself why I didn't just make banana bread with my overripe bananas and save myself the trouble of scooping cookies.  Good flavor, I just was looking for something a little more cookie-ish.

At the last minute, I remembered that I had promised to bring treats to my  soccer team. I had ripe bananas, and wanted to use them up, so I tried this recipe on the theory that it sounded a little odd, but might be great. I made the cookies without the nuts, since I have a nut-allergic boy on the team, and they were a HUGE hit. They were soft, moist, and flavorful, and the boys all loved them, even the picky eaters. I will definitely make these again - I'd like to make them with walnuts or pecans for home consumption, and I think they'd be great with chocolate chips, as well. Yum.

This recipe makes a moisty, chewy cookie that's reminiscent of banana nut bread. I substituted 1/2 white and 1/2 wheat flour and used pecans instead of walnuts and they turned out great. I used ripe not "overripe" bananas and got plenty of fresh banana flavor.

These cookies turned out delicious!! A definite addition to my collection of banana recipes. Plus the recipe is so easy, you don't even need an electric mixer. I just used a fork for all the mixing.

Great alternative to making banana bread - agreed that 9-10 minutes is enough, even with a bigger cookie. My tweaks - used butter instead of shortening, 1/2 c. golden yellow sugar and 1/2 white sugar. Also added butterscotch chips.

Yum, Banana muffin tops! The tick is to use shortening, used butter but not the same. Baking time 12 minutes for heaping full teaspoon measured cookies.

I added a bit more cinnamon and nutmeg, also omitted the walnuts (didn't have any). None the less, they came out PERFECT! I would recommend this to anyone and will defiantly make again!
I would recommend refrigerating the batter for a few before baking, so they don't flatten out. Again, I love this cookie!!

We couldn't stop eating these cookies! The only changes I made were adding 1/4 teaspoon of cloves, and also increasing the oats to 2 cups because I eliminated the nuts. Also, in the convection oven I baked at 375 for 8 minutes. Very happy with the results.

Very good cookies. I just made Persimmon Oatmeal cookies instead of bananas and cut the sugar down to 3/4s cup. I used 2 persimmons was probably 1 and 1/3 cups of pulp.

These cookies were way too cakey. You might as well make a banana bread loaf because they tasted exactly the same. If I were to make this recipe again, I would maybe try adding some oats and vanilla to give it a different texture.

These cookies are probably great as the recipe goes; however, i changed a few things... First, one cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 c ap flour, i used 1/4 c turbinado sugar and 1/4 vt maple syrup (plus sprinkled the cookies before baking them with the sugar) and were sweet enough, then i used 1/4 canola oil and 1/2 plain yogurt instead of  shortening. i used 3/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice and 1/2 tsp cinnimon, and used toasted almonds instead of walnuts.  I added flaxseed to them to round them out as the best breakfast cookie ever! I did add a mixture of dark chocolate chips and some raisins for a little extra something.

Good: not too sweet and easy to make; satisfies the sweet cravings w/o having to eat a sugar cookie Bad: it's a little too dry for me and it didn't fall as flat as I'd like to be.   I would definitely make this again in the future

Ehhh, not very good.  Very cakey/spongey. Very bland, one-dimensional, plain.  After the first tray came out, added chocolate chips to the remaining batter.  That added a "tad" of life but still not much.  They would need a good cream cheese icing to get any flavor on them at all.  And they did not brown up either.  They came out a very pale whitish color, very unappetizing looking.  I won't make them again, but gave them 2 stars because they weren't a total failure.

These are awesome. I had a ton of black bananas in my fridge (they make the best bread) and wanted to use them up. Wanted a change from banana bread so I tried this recipe. Changed it slightly: omitted the nutmeg (didn't want it to taste like banana bread), omitted nuts (didn't have), used 1/2c shortening and 1/4 butter, and increased the oats to 2c. Also added a splash of milk (eyeballed it, maybe 1/8c) and 1/2 t vanilla. Fantastic unadulterated banana flavor. Just make sure to watch them carefully, mine came out perfect at exactly 9 min at 400.

These are great.  They have a really interesting texture.  They are cakey, but the oatmeal makes them less cakey than other banana cookie recipes I've tried.  I doubled the spices, and added 1/2 c chocolate chips.  I highly recommend these.

Very easy to make cookies. And they were so good that my husband and his friend ate a whole batch in one day! His friend also told me that he would buy all the ingredients so I could make enough cookies to last a year. :)

These cookies are so yummy.  They taste like banana bread.  I didn't use walnuts because my husband doesn't like them in cookies, but they are still so good.  I will definitely make these again.

Slightly less sugar, skipped the walnuts. Baked at 375 for about 12 minutes. Tasty, easy, sort of healthy.

I eliminated the nuts but added chocolate chips and dried cranberries (to make these healthy - right?). I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar and they are just right in the sweetness department.  I used butter instead of margarine.  Mine did not spread out.  They look like little mounds.  I did use my 1 teaspoon measure but rounded it.  I got 70 cookies.  They are great!  I would definitely make again.

Delicious! Moist and flavorful. Took suggestion of 1/2 butter and 1/2 applesauce instead of shortening and used half wheat and half white flour. Will make again.

Instead of Walnuts, I used Pecans. Hubby suggested to not chop the nuts as small as I did but leave them bigger.

These were easy and delicious. I gave 4 stars vs. 5 because, as others reported, the cookies  only needed to  cook about 10 minutes.  Other than that the cookies perfect. I added a handful of cocoanut and a handful of dried cranberries. I will make again.

These cookies are delicious! I used the recipe as directed with butter for the shortening. Twelve minutes was definitely enough baking time and I removed them from the pan immediately.

So good! I added some vanilla and also reduced cooking time and temp to 350. Although I think it all depends on how big you are planning on making them. My last batch I used a ice cream scoop for huge breakfast cookies and had to adjust temp and time accordingly to 375 for 18mins.

I don't use shortening, so I substituted a stick of lower fat margarine and since it seemed a little dry, I added applesauce. Hubby loved them!

Doubled recipe, added 2 cups chocolate chips, used parchment paper and cookie scoop, baked for 12 minutes, turned out perfectly! Perfect balance of banana flavor with chocolate chips. And no one can even tell that there is healthy oatmeal inside ;) !!

Thank you for this recipe.  I'll make these again.  
Tasty, fluffy cookies.  Not overly sweet which I prefer.  I like the texture the oats provided.
Modifications I made:
* salted butter instead of shortening  *added tsp vanilla  
* crushed walnuts into small pieces/powder w/ mallet
*  Added 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
I did what some reviewers suggested:  350 degrees.  I watched them carefully so I'm not sure of the exact baking time.

These were kind of weird. As another reviewer said, they couldn't decide if they were a cookie or a bread. I used half the batter to make cookies, the other half for muffins. They work better as spongy cookies, I think. They're fine to eat, but I doubt I'll make them again.

I didn't find these to be exceptional, just ok.  Not sure if I'd make them again.  I used unsalted butter as the shortening.  The cookies did not spread out as they baked.

Just made these using coconut oil rather than shortening and I didn't have walnuts so I substituted almonds. Then just for the heck of it I threw in about a 1/2 cup coconut which was all I had left. They came out delicious, moist and chewy!

I used brown sugar, large oat flakes,  2 eggs, good plain yogurt instead of milk, 3 ripe bananas, used approx 2 cups flour, and put in choc chips! Everything else stayed the same and they turned out awesome! Will definitely make these again!

These are great!  I used  1/2 C brown sugar and 1/2 C regular sugar.  Also subbed 1/2 C of the shortening with peanut butter.  Baked 350 for 12 minutes.

I used 4 tbsp of butter and made up for the rest of the fat with another banana.  While my bananas were incredibly ripe, the cookies were still barely sweet.  I'd add a couple of tbsp of honey next time.

Made it almost as stated except was short on shortening so I used 1/4 c applesauce. 
Also added a touch of cardamon and dried cranberries.
I did, however, forget to add the oatmeal!  The second half I got some in there and honestly?  Either way was good!  Soft and chewy, cake-like and great flavor!

Great way to use up ripe bananas if you don't want to make banana cake. I used Stevia Crystal instead of sugar, and subbed applesauce for some of the shortening - the rest I replaced with butter. Also used a mix of whole wheat flour and white. Added more spices. Great basic recipe that you can pep up as you like. I also recommend baking for only 10 minutes!

I really like this recipe. These remind me of my Mom's banana nut bread. I cut the size but followed it other than using butter & coconut oil for shortening. They freeze very well, I made a dozen & froze 8 in two packs. Kinda of nice to just pull 2 out of the freezer.

Made these this afternoon and everyone loved them.  I read the other reviews first and made some minor tweaks, too.  Substituted some apple sauce for some of the butter, and half as much sugar but used brown sugar.  Left out the nuts so the kids could take them to their nut-free school for snacks.  Finally, also cut the baking time down to about 10 minutes.  They came out crispy on the outside but nice and soft in the middle, like mini muffin tops. They were great! Will definitely make this recipe again.

They taste like little banana bread cookies..We liked them!! I didn't use the shorting,instead I used 2 Table spoons of the Parkey fat free calorie free spray butter. I didn't have any rolled oats but I did have the instant prepackaged low sugar Cinnamon spice oatmeal I used 3 of them. I try to tweek recipes as much as I can to make them as healthy as I can and they turned out really good!!  :))

Love these cookies!  I think the baking time varies according to the size of your bananas..each batch I have made has varied by 1-2 minutes. I used butter Crisco stick shortening, added 1/2 bad of cinnamon chips, and extra oatmeal if the batter is really wet. Do not over cook... Also made a batch with a powdered sugar glaze and they are extra delicious!  The recipe I first found was in a 1974 church cookbook... Try these!!

These cookies were very light and flavorful. They bottom seemed to brown quicker than most cookies.  I had to take mine out in 9-10 minutes. I would use parchment paper next time.

Great cookies! Doubled the recipe but not the sugar, used chocolate chips as well. Past experience with banana cookies - too moist. These were great consistency.  Left out the nuts so the kids could take to school.  Definitely make thee again! Oh I also used only 1 cup butter instead of shortening- don't forget I doubled recipe!

I made these wheat-free by subbing 1/2 oat flour and 1/2 rice flour for the all-purpose flour and adding a little xanthum gum. (Not sure how much, off the top of my head.) I used butter instead of shortening. I slightly softened it, then mixed it with the sucanat with my mixer. I used Sucanat in place of white sugar and left out the walnuts due to allergies. I know this rating may not help others due to all my changes, but these cookies were really good!

It's just like eating banana bread, with that little cookie crunch. I did not include the nuts, since my son cannot take any thing with nuts to school. Instead I substituted chocolate chips, which was a hit. I also added about 1 tsp of vanilla to give it an added touch. Will definitely make these again.

I made these and brought them to a family party. They were delicious and were enjoyed by the kids, aged 2-17 and the adults. I didn't have any left over. Also the recipe made a lot more than stated. I'm not sure why.

My family loves these cookies. I make them with 1/2 c. applesauce and 1/4 c. oil to make them healthier. The cookies are very heavy, almost like a muffin. I now have a recipe to use up ripe bananas that isn't a cake.

Awesome cookies!!  Perfect Birthday treat to send to my son's school.  The school does not allow nuts so I had to omit those and they also do not allow chocolate.  Most kids send cupcakes but I always try to send something a little bit healthier for a change.

Excellent recipe! The nutmeg and cinnamon gave the cookies an interesting flavor depth and this cookie is mellow enough to add extras to, like dried fruit (i added cranberries). I'll be making this one again for sure.

These are moist chewy and delicious.  I will be making these every time I have overripe bananas.

Well, after mixing together all the dry ingredients - I discovered I only had 1/4 c. crisco (butter flavor). So, I substituted the remaining 1/2 c. with butter.  I really didnt pay attention to the temp/time as my oven runs hot so I started them at 350 and once golden brown around bottom edge I always turn the temp down to about 250 until the middle is done - but leaving the cookie still soft.  These turned out GREAT! Soft and chewy and very moiste with great banana flavor. I will definately make these again.

Tastes like banana bread w/ texture of oatmeal.  I changed 1/2 c white flour to wheat flour.  Yum.  Very soft.

I just tried this recipe. It was very simple to put together. 15 min. is a bit too long to bake them. 9 min was perfect.
I did not like the taste. i found them quite bland. Maybe they would be better with nuts added. My family does not like nuts.

Pretty good cookies. I subbed brown rice flour for the all-purpose and used all butter instead of shortening. Used 1/2 cup raisins instead of nuts. Also used EnerG egg replacer (my son has an egg allergy). Baked the cookies for 13-15 minutes per batch and they came out brown and crispy on the edges and outside and soft on the inside. My husband even liked them, and he's not a big fan of oatmeal cookies. Will use 1/2 the sugar next time because really ripe bananas give these cookies plenty of sweetness. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I may have used to much banana in my recipe because they came out like muffin tops, which wasn't bad, but I wanted a cookie more than a muffin.  They were very good reheated and everyone I shared them with thought they were excellent.

A very good cookies, tasting like a bit of banana bread. I made a double batch of these for my hubby to take to the office and they got rave reviews. However, I baked them for 11 minutes as they got too brown at 400 degrees for 12 minutes; when this adjustment was made, they were a dark brown on the bottom rather than a nice tan color. I also tweeked this recipe by using 3/4 teaspoon of baking powder for increased height of the cookie with no harm done. Delicious with coffee or a cold glass of skim milk.

Excellent! We followed the recipe exactly and these are a big hit with the kids, me, and the lifeguards at the pool! Definetely a great way to use those last 2 over-ripe bananas from the bunch.

I loved these- My son has dairy allergies so I am always looking for something with no butter.  I love bananas and these were very flavorful and my son loved them too.  With the fruit and oats- we use them as breakfast cookies.

Tasty and quick, and most people have these ingredients on hand.  I found 9 minutes at 400 deg. plenty of time for these cookies--they were very dark on the bottom even with 9 minutes.

I made these for a cookie party.  They were a huge hit.  As soon as I opened the container you could smell the banana.  Will definatly make again.

these cookies are cake-like in texture, but in a good way.  I used whole-wheat flour instead, and 2/3 butter and 1/3 applesauce and it turned out great.  I also substituted the walnuts with cranberries and apple and even chocolate chips, anything works with this recipe.

Used wheat flour, but made no other changes. These are good, and I'll probably make them again next time I have overripe bananas.
