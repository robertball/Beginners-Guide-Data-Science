CAME OUT EXCELENT. I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE PHYLLO DOUGH ? IT SAYS PLAIN AS DAY TO USE "store-bought phyllo cups" SO YOU DONT NEED THE SHEETS. MY LOCAL STORE SELLS THESE MINI 15 TO A PACK CUPS.  THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT I BAKE THEM FOR ABOUT 3-5 MINS TO GET THEM WARM AND CRISPY, AND SO THE CRAB MIXTURE WILL MELT JUST A LITTLE.  YUMMY !

I gave this recipe 5 stars because when I make it I assemble them and bake them on a cookie sheet at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes.  I can't imagine eating them cold!  Give this a shot and you'll just love them.

as is this recipe is not that great but if you try tsome of these changes it is excellent. I use 1 thing of cream cheese not 2 and I would also use instead the imitation crab meat as opposed to the meat in the can, it is a better taste and texture and I use more like 10 oz of it. add in 2 tsp of Old Bay seasoning and 1 tsp of hot pepper sauce and some finely minced red pepper. Pipe it out using a baggy with a cut corner onto cucumber slices to counteract the spiciness and you will have a great appetizer.

Could not be easier or tastier! I did follow previous reviewer's suggestions and only used 8oz of cream cheese. Glad I did. Turned out to be a perfect blend of crab and cream cheese. Also I added a teaspoon of diced pimento for additional color and flavor. I did wind up filling 20 shells so I'm glad I bought two packages.
As for the people that complained about the lack of phyllo instructions....here they are....go to the store and buy two boxes of phyllo shells.

I made a couple of changes to it. I used less cream cheese than was asked for. I also baked them for a few minutes. They were absolutely delicious. I set them out and they were gone in less than 20 minutes. I had to send my husband out to get more phyllo shells. I'm definitely planning on making these again. I didn't have a single complaint. Even my husband who does not eat seafood of any kind had some.

I made this recipe but added tabasco to it for a kick and also made my own puffs.  Served at a wedding for 300 and everyone raved. None left on the platters.

TOO MUCH CREAM CHEESE! I re-made this with 1 package of cream cheese and it was delicious! This is so easy and impressive I am using it for all my parties from now on.

Very tasty and pretty!  I doubled the recipe and made them for a party - got many compliments.  I have to agree with someone else who said there may be too much cream cheese, though.  The amount of mixture this recipe makes far-exceeds the amount I could ever stuff into 15 small phyllo cups.  And, the cream cheese was good, but I think it stole some of the seafood flavor from it.  I will use less cream cheese next time.  Also, I sprinkled Old Bay seasoning on top instead of cocktail sauce, which was tasty.  And, I took someone else's advice and baked the cups for 3 - 4 minutes to take the chill off before serving.  I will definitely make these again, thanks Jill!!

Yum, these were good.  I doubled the recipe, but not the cream cheese.  I added salt and pepper, a tsp. of green onion, a tsp. of Old Bay Seasoning and a tsp. of Franks Red Hot sauce. I chose to bake mine at 350 for 15 minutes and broil for 5 at the end to brown the top just a bit.

Great, yummy recipe.  My guests gobbled them all up and wanted more.  However, the phyllo instructions are not good.  I used premade phyllo shells - turned out just fine.

Didn't like this recipe.  There was very little flavor and I added extra garlic.  I wouldn't make these again.

A few modifications...I doubled the crab meat and skipped the cocktail sauce.  Baked at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes and it was fantastic!  The result is delicious little crab dip tarts.  A huge hit at our house.  Next time I may add in some spinach or chopped artichokes.

Very delicious!  Only used 1 package of cream cheese as suggested by others.  My husband ended up making them, so he left out the hot sauce which would have been better.  Next time I'll try to heat them for 15 minutes so the dip is more bubbly.  BUT, I like them the way they came, with a little sauce on top...YUM!

This is a great appetizer!  It's a great basic recipe to add and subtract from.  Like the other reviewers, the original recipe calls for too much cream cheese.  1-8oz. package is enough.  I leave out the dill weed and the parsley.  Then I add more garlic, pepper, Jane's Mixed-Up salt or Sazon Completa (Complete Seasoning mft'd by Badia), and to add variety - bacon bits on top.  I also pop them into the oven for about 5 minutes...makes it all come together.

I used only 6 ounces of cream cheese (with 6 oz of crab meat) instead of the recomended 16 oz. I prefer a stronger crab flavor. In addition to the dill, parsley, and garlic, I added paprika, cayenne pepper, and black pepper (there is enough salt already in the canned crab). I tried wrapping the mixture in both phyllo paper to make a triangle (zig-zag pattern) and won ton wrappers. I served them with sweet and sour sauce for an oriental flavor.

If I could give half stars, I would have given this recipe 4.5 stars.  I made a couple changes.  I used an 8 ounce package of imitation crab meat and only 1 package of cream cheese.  I used the food proccessor to finely chop the crab meat.  I also added more garlic and sauteed it in a splash of white wine along with 1  chopped shallot.   I had enough filling to fill 40 phyllo shells.  I hate cocktail sauce so I omitted it.

It sounded good, and I liked it, but none of my guests even finished their first taste. Too much cream cheese. Phyllo dough directions were not specified well. I do not think I would make this again.

Overall taste in this recipe was good.  But the instructions on how to use the phillo was poor.  How many sheets to use....???  I made it but it didn't turn out as good as I thought it would.

These are delicious! I served them with a side of the "Company Couscous" recipe from AR (weird combination, I know). As everyone has said, only use one block of cream cheese (that has to be a typo, saying to use 2!!). I also added a small can of chopped artichoke hearts.
I did bake these for about 20 minutes, because I wanted a warm appetizer, but it would have been yummy cold, too. I used zesty shrimp sauce mixed with a bit of sriracha hot sauce because we like it spicy! Great recipe, hot or cold. Almost impossible to screw up!

This recipe was ok, but pretty uninspiring. The crab is impossible to taste, and the cream cheese and spices do nothing for taste. Edible, but not special.

Very tasty. I only used a package and a half of Cream cheese, like others reviewers had suggested. I also added some old bay and a dollop of cocktail sauce to the mix. I would make these again.

I used half the cream cheese.  

There aren't phyllo shells where I live, so instead I used nori - seaweed wrap which is used to roll sushi.  I used the small ones designed for onigiri (rice balls).  Just put a small spoonful on each sheet and rolled them up, then heated them for 5 minutes in the oven.

Wonderful!

This recipe as listed above is not wonderful.  First, there is far too much cream cheese!  Follow the advice of others, and use one package.  Also warming these up a bit is probably a good idea.  I made these for a party with friends and it seemed as though I stuffed phyllo with cream cheese.  Next time I will read other people's reviews before making something unfamilar.  I may try them again, but not as listed above.

I can only give this 4 stars since the recipe had to be "tweaked".  I followed the advice of other posters...cutting back on the cream cheese AND warming these up in the oven.  I was going to top it off with the cocktail sauce and then I forgot, but I made these for New Year's Eve and my guests LOVED them!! I will definitely make again.  What a great appetizer! (next time I will remember the cocktail sauce!)

I really liked these.  I followed everyone else and only used 1 package of cream cheese, but I did use a can of of shredded crab.  

I made them with phyllo pastries (so the sheets of the annoying dough).  I cut the phyllo into squares, brush it lightly with melted butter, put a small amount in the middle, fold the four corners (almost as if you were making a pyramid) and squeeze just above the filling(the filling might break out the bottom, so try not to squeeze too close to the filling).  

I hope that isn't too confusing, I suggest playing with phyllo dough to find out what works for you, but make sure the dough you're not working on is covered with a damp cloth to prevent it from drying out (which happens very quickly).

Wonderful. Doubled the amount of crab and other spices (added a bit of cayenne for heat) and kept the amount of cream cheese the same. Used pre-made, frozen mini phyllo cups, heated up for 5 minutes in a warm oven before filling. This helped to "melt" the crab mixture a bit. I topped each bite with a tiny dab of cocktail sauce (mixture of ketchup and horseradish), and a tiny sprig of fresh dill. Took it to a family potluck and got rave reviews...even from those who didn't eat seafood.

They sounded great, but I wasn't impressed with them.  I doubled the recipe but only used 12 oz cream cheese - should have doubled everything and used only 8 oz cream cheese.  I think next time I will also use imitation crab meat and not the canned.  I think that would give it more flavor.  I will try these again though.

Took suggestions to use less cream cheese, so I tried one 8 oz pkg.  Next time I'll use even less because we felt it still had to much.  Very easy to make & taste better the longer it sits.

These are great! Everyone who has had them has raved about them and asked for more! So far I have made them for several holiday parties. I didn't use the cocktail sauce though, just left them as they are, let's just say they didn't last long. I don't think I could have made enough, they are simply that good! Thanks for such a simple easy recipe :o)

I made it with minimal changes (based on some reviews) but still felt it lacked a lot of flavor. My husband and I enjoyed it enough at the time but when it comes to crab recipes we have others that we'd prefer. So I'd have to say I wouldn't make it again.

I made this for a cooking group I belong to.  Our assignment was tapas/appetizers.  The only major change I made was using less cream cheese, as most of the other reviews recommended.   I found the mixture to be somewhat tasteless, so added a bit more seasoning and a few drops of hot sauce to it.  I heated them up as recommended too because I didn’t like them cold.  The ladies in the cooking group were very tepid about it.  I did not like the mixture in the filo cups.  If I make it again I would use something else to hold the mixture or just serve it as a spread with crackers.

Very Good!  There are a lot of variation that can be used with this recipe. First, I only used (1) 8oz  cream cheese then also added 1tsp of Old Bay, 1tsp of Franks Red Hot Sauce and 1/2 cup of shredded cheese.  I had enough to fill 15+ cups that come in the single phyllo cup package.  After filing the cups, I placed on a cookie sheet and heated at 350 degrees for 15-20min.  This really brought out the flavors!  Good, if served cold; Great is served warm/hot.

I followed the recipe as written, then I read the other reviews.   Next time I will use only 1 block of cream cheese.  I also like the idea of sprinkling some Old Bay on top and baking for a few minutes.  I will definitely try these again.

Made this today as an appetizer with a few changes and people ate it up like crazy!! 
I skipped on the shells and just served with crackers and chips. We were also out of dill, so instead  I squeezed a lemon into the mix. So yummy! Next time I will probably go up on the crab meat.

Made this and followed the recipe to the tee. Seemed like it was missing something so I then decided to add a little extra. I added 1 Tsp. onion powder, 1 tsp.garlic powder, 2 splashes of hot sauce and one quick shake of red pepper. I garnished each with a fresh parsley fig for color then sprinkled Cayenne pepper over the top.

These were edible, but bland. Not good with canned crab meat. Maybe they are better with another type. Also, the pre-made shells were hard and not appealing. Not something I will make again.

This was very good. I used 1 1/2 packages cream cheese and 1 6 oz can crab and about 1/2 jar of artichoke hearts. I also used some garlic, Old Bay and hot sauce. Big hit for the Superbowl party with friends.

I used only one package of cream cheese and added several healthy shakes of hot sauce to the mixture. Also added about 4 extra cloves of fresh garlic. Once they were assembled I put in the oven for about 15 minutes to melt and mix together Everyone loved them even my husband who claims to not like seafood.  I filled up about 20 phyllo cups. Everything was easy to put together and quick.

I made these with half the cream cheese and added minced oinion, horseradish and some cocktail sauce to the mixture.  Got great compliments and requests to make them again.

Bland, I even cut the cream cheese down a bit.  At my open house these weren't very popular.  They were very easy to make though.

THESE LITTLE BITES OF HEAVEN WENT SO FAST FOR MOTHERS DAY. ALTHOUGH I FORGOT TO PUT THE COCKTAIL SAUCE ON IT WAS STILL GOOD. I ALSO USED REGULAR IMITATION CRAB INSTEAD OF CANNED. THEY WERE MOSTLY EATEN BY MY 95 YEAR OLD GREAT GRANDMOTHER. MY AUNT, WHOM I WORK WITH, IS STILL BEGGING ME TO MAKE THESE AND BRING THEM TO WORK. I AM DEFINITELY MAKING THIS A FAMILY RECIPE!!!!!!

Made these for Thanksgiving and my guests loved them!  These were sooo easy.  I went with other recommendations to only use 1 8 oz package of cream cheese and think it was a good balance.  I did heat them in the oven which brought out the flavor.  I didn't care for them much (think there was too much of something...maybe the dill weed) but glad they were a hit!

Made these for a MMA party for several men and they gobbled these right up.  Like others I made a few changes.  I used an 8 oz. package of crab, reduced cream cheese to 1 1/2 packs of reduced fat, doubled the spices, and added a few dashes of hot sauce.  It came out perfect and was more than enough to fill 30 shells.  My hubby detests cream cheese,so was surprised he enjoyed these so much.  He even saved some back for later.  This recipe is definitely worth tinkering with as the combination of flavors is really good.

Got lots of compliments from this dish but I did revise it.  Used 1pkg cream cheese and also added paprika, cayenne, old bay, and louisiana hot sauce for a kick.  Also mixed a dab of cocktail sauce in the mixture.  Served them hot, baked in oven for few minutes or 45 seconds in microwave.  They were gobbled up.

It was easy but that does not matter much when it ends up in the trash.  It was terrible.  Of 12 people served, one thought it was OK.  You can not taste the crab, could have just used dill weed and cream cheese.  would probably be good if it were done with more of a crab salad type filling.  Will not do again.
