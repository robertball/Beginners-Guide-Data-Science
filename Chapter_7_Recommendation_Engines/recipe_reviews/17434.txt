This was great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I changed it a little bit.Instead of coconut cream pudding I used vanila. And for the rum I used pineapple rum. An easy and good tasting desert.

I hate to give a bad review, but this cake was SUCH a disappointment.  It had an overly sweet and unnatural flavor--and smell.  I made this cake for my husband's family, and was really embarrassed when we all took our first bite.  I had been hoping that the cake would taste better than it smelled, but it was worse.  Thankfully, the frosting (whipped cream, cream of coconut pudding, flaked coconut, and crushed pineapple) was delicious, so we scrapped it off of the cake and ate that by itself.  

Like I said, I hate giving bad reviews, so I apologize, but I regret wasting my time making and serving this cake so I felt it was important to share my feelings on it.

Had a rum party after visiting the Bahamas!  This cake was perfect.  I too had to use vanilla pudding, but I had coconut flavored rum to make up for it.  The frosting makes the cake light and refreshing.  I will use this recipe many times.  Also, I usually bake from scratch and found the doctoring of the cake mix helped that I did not feel guilty for serving a cake mix desert.

My husband loved this cake. I used light rum instead of dark because that is what I had on hand; probably would have been better with the dark, but still delicious!  Thanks for the recipe Roger!

Hands down BEST cake in the world! A huge hit at all the family get togethers! I used a 20oz can of crushed pineapple instead of the 8oz can. I added half the pineapple to the cake batter and used the juice from the can instead of using water. And always, a little extra rum! Made the cake SO moist! Best cake ever!!!!

I made the cake with fat free frozen whipped topping which cut the
calories just a bit. I love this cake because it's not too sweet,
and very light.
I made this cake for a birthday party, I decorated the top with chocolate shells, and macadamia nuts for rocks, and a paper umbrella.
Everyone just loved the cake. I made it for a pot luck also, and it
got rave reviews.

This was sooooooo yummy.  Like another reviewer suggested, I too used pineapple juice instead of the 1/2 cup of water.  I also used more rum (1/2 cup) in the batter.  My parents visited for the Thanksgiving holidays and absolutely raved about this cake...I think my Dad ate almost half the cake!!

This cake was a BIG hit!! I made a few changes.  I used pineapple cake mix, vanilla pudding and coconut rum. I did not add the coconut flakes because I don't care for flaked coconut. The cake was AWESOME!! Everyone loved the cake.  I doubled the whipped topping because one tub of whipped cream was not enough.

Hacer el cake según instrucciones, pero el filling es mejor hacer el pudín s/instrucciones en la caja pero con un poco menos de leche, y despues agregar el resto de los ingredientes.

THIS WAS A BIG HIT!!! I baked this cake for a surprise party I was throwing for a friend and everyone loved it.  It was gone in minutes. I made it in a regular cake pan and made two recipes to make it a double layer. For the middle I put pineapple preserves and on top of that a layer of the frosting.  Frosting was made with heavy cream and omitted the instant coconut cream pudding.  Added more rum to taste and this was delicious.

The cake was very good, but I couldn't find coconut pudding so I used vanilla instead.  I think it would have been better with the coconut!

I normally make everything from scratch, but I found this recipe and needed something resembling a pina colada taste with a quick turn-a-round. I decided to make cupcakes instead of a cake for a quick and easy snack.  The frosting was dee-lish.  I used the coconut creme for the cake filling and sugar free vanilla pudding packet for the frosting.  I will definitely add this to my box of "go-to" recipes. Thank you!

D.E.L.I.C.I.O.U.S! This is soooo good! I couldn't find coconut pudding (the asian ones look more like gelatin than pudding to me), so I used vanilla pudding and 4 tsp of coconut extract. I also put in an extra tbsp of dark rum and coconut rum in the frosting. Super yummy. I've made this twice and both times have had rave remarks from my guests. Definitely a rum taste, but not too overpowering. Tastes just like it's namesake- a Pina Colada!

Sorry to go against the grain but this cake was just okay. it was just a boxed cake with coconut shavings. I could not find coconut cream puddding so I used vanilla pudding but put coconut extract. However, I must say that the frosting was pretty good.

Just perfect!!  I have also used the frosting part of the recipe (minus the rum) on a two layer pineapple upside-down cake--just a little frosting in the middle and the rest around the sides.  It was gone in minutes.

Great cake. My variations were for 3 layers, baking for about 18 minutes and adding a full 20 oz. can of crushed pineapple drained of about have the juice. I wanted a lot of frosting with a pronounced pineapple taste.... YUMMY!!

I altered this recipe a little... using Pineapple Rum instead, and leaving out the coconut. Great! Also, instead of mixing rum into the icing, I put some in a spray bottle and sprayed it on the cake after I frosted it. Gave it an all-over pineappley taste. will make again!

This is the most requested cake I've ever made. I add a splash more rum to the cake batter and a little bit more to the frosting. After frosting, I sprinkle more coconut flakes over the top and sides. This cake bakes up really moist you may think it's not done. Don't over bake or it'll have a chewy texture.

It smells just like a Pina Colada. Nice and fruity. 

My co-workers have been begging me to make this cake for a few months now. I have never gotten so many compliments on a cake as this one. Great for a holiday office party.

I took a summer course based on coffee and sugar (and other commodities).. and since my commodity was rum, I decided to bake this cake in the form of cupcakes. They were a massive hit!

This cake is so freaking good. I made it for a Jamaica themed party I had and everyone couldn't stop talking about it, they love it so much that everytime there is a birthday or party I am asked to make it.  My dad requests it every year for his birthday which is in December....

I really enjoyed this recipe. I made it for my sister's birthday and everyone loved it. The cake isn't as strong as other rum cakes I've made but one could add more rum if one desired to do so.

I made this as a single layer cake by cutting the recipe in half.  It appeared in the picture that there were crushed nuts on the sides of the cake so I did that with walnuts.  The cake was amazing.  I would definitely make it again.

Delicious - and doesn't take long to bake - BONUS! I also substituted pineapple juice for the water and divided a 20oz can of crushed pineapple between the cake and the frosting. This one was for work, so used the original amount of rum, but next time will add more. Thanks for the recipe!

Made it for my coworkers and they loved it!... I used coconut rum and vanilla pudding mix instead (based it on other reviews) I also used a pineapple lime filling. Oh and I added some pineapple juice and rum instead of the water to the cake batter... Great recipe!

Great recipe. I would definitely make this again. I sprinkled some toasted coconut on top and put a cherry in the center.

All seemed to enjoy this cake.  Nice rum flavor. I could not find instant coconut pudding and had to use vanilla pudding.  Perhaps I should have used a bit of coconut extract and it would have more of a coconut flavor. The cake was moist which surprised me since the batter was very thick prior to baking.  I will make again.

This was a hit  at coffee hour.   I used coconut rum instead of the dark - in both the cake and the topping.  I found a GF Meyer Lemon Cake mix at Aldi and tried that. The box weight was a little lighter - I think 16 oz instead of 18 oz so the cake didn't get a great height but it was high enough..  I used a 9x13 since it was on a buffet. I also toasted the coconut for the top to give it some extra flavor and a bit of color.   Easy,, light, and people raved about it.

I whipped heavy cream for the frosting and received many raving compliments.  I'm going to use the recipe again.

Everyone loved this cake!  It looks fantastic and tastes even better.  I am so glad I made it and I highly recommend it.

I made a few changes to the recipe:

1: I added pineapple juice to the batter for flavor.  This was good but please note that it made the batter runnier so it took longer to cook.

2: Rather than mixing the crushed pineapple into the frosting, I just used it as a layer between the cakes.  That way the outside of the cake has a uniform un-lumpy appearance. However I did include the pineapple juice in the frosting for flavor. 

3: I also added a second container of cool whip to the frosting recipe, and a container of "fluffy white" store-bought cake frosting.  The frosting was really liquid so I ended up placing it in the fridge for an hour before I could use it.

4: I didn't end up sprinkling the coconut on top. I frosted the cake smoothly all the way around, and then dyed the leftover frosting purple and created a frosting border. Then I added candles and umbrellas to the top. 

(Alternatively, my back-up plan was to decorate the top with pineapple rings and cherries, like a pineapple upside down cake).

This cake is absolutely delicious!  I did make two changes.  I used Parrot Bay Coconut Rum instead of a dark rum and I toasted some coconut in the oven and sprinkled on top.  I have made this cake 3-4 times and it is an  easy cake to make and  everyone loves it!

This is an awesome cake.. I hate baking from a box but I always try a recipe the way it is written first before tweeking and I have to say the only tweeking I really had to do to make it my standers was add a few extra tablespoons of rum to the frosting. It came out awesome. I will be making this again but I am soooo not telling it's from a box. if you complain that it isn't good then you did something wrong. Enjoy

Frosting was just enough to cover, so be careful if you want to use it for filling! It was delicious and the frosting tasted just like a pina colada! Thanks!

I made this in an extremely rushed way and skipped the frosting. But the cake itself tasted great. I mixed in pineapples as well as i had no time for making the filling.

I've been making this recipe for my sister's birthday for over 30 years and have never deviated from the recipe (rare for me)and I do use dark rum in both the cake and the frosting.

My boyfriend asked for a cake with coconut in it for his birthday. As he ate his first piece he said "this is better than I could have imagined". This cake is so easy to make and so delicious (coming from someone who doesn't like coconut). I used regular rum and next time I think I'll use coconut rum to add to the flavor. Definitely could have used a little more frosting but it wasn't too dry or lacking. Will definitely keep this on file for something fun to make.

I'm not sure who would give a bad review - unless you are not a fan of rum cake in general.  I just got another request to make this for a picnic.  The only change I made is I use vanilla instant pudding mix (as I can never find coconut) and just add a tad of coconut extract.  I add add a few more splashes of rum also.  Great summer time treat!
