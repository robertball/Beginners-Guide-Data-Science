I could have given this 5 stars...but only after I made several changes.  I left out the onion (not being a big fan) and mixed all other "sauce" ingredients together...I also upped the honey amount to about 1/8 C., used garlic salt instead of powder, onion powder in place of the minced onion, about 1/2 tsp. lemon zest, and pepper to taste.  Here's the kicker...i only used 5 breasts.  Once I dunked them in the mixture, I poured what was left over the top!!  AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!

Don't be fooled by the simplicity of this recipe! The ingredients meld to form a delicious carmelized sauce with a roasted flavor that permeates the chicken breasts. This is so simple and absolutely delicious...I would definitely serve this to guests for an elegant meal. I used fresh garlic in place of the garlic powder (3 large cloves to 12 chicken breasts). Thank you for sharing this family recipe!

This was a wonderful, easy meal to cook.  It was light but went perfect with our side dish...french onion soup!  Thanks:)

This was just okay.  I followed the recipe exactly, but did scale it down for 1 chicken breast.  Maybe that's why the sauce didn't carmelize.  The only good thing I can say is that the diced onion smelled good while cooking.

I made this tonight with only 4 chicken breasts and after reading many reviews decided to use minced garlic, 1/8 cup of honey, garlic salt, and kept the onion. The "sauce" did not caramelize AT ALL. It was like juice. I even raised the temperature to 375 and then higher to 400 (I'd taken the chicken out at this point). The sauce started to bubble around the edges but that's really it. The flavor was just ok. My husband and I had to add salt, but it was still just ok. Kinda disappointed I tried. :(

This chicken turned out so juicy & it had a really nice, sweet taste. The flavor was not really pronounced, but with a bit of salt added to it, you can taste the honey mingling with the butter, onions & garlic powder. I would recommend this for a light meal in the evening.  It's so easy that even a novice could make it!

This was very good!!!  I used legs instead of boneless skinless chicken, still cooked for an hour, and they came out perfect!  Amazing how so few ingredients can come together to make a very yummy dish.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

WOW!!!!!  I make a lot of chicken, and this may possibly be the best I have ever made!  Very delicious, although I will say it was a tad on the dry side (which I kind of assumed would be the case in looking at the cook time). I used fresh garlic rather than the powder, as I generally do.  I cannot wait to pass this recipe around to others.  One bit of advice would be to line your pan with foil prior to making this - the sauce can get a bit sticky!!  Thanks, Keith, I definately give this one two thumbs up!! :)

My family enjoyed this. I didn't enjoy it as much. It is good but there was something about it I didn't care for. The flavor was good at first but then it tasted strange. Maybe it was me. I would only make it again if my family asked for it.

This recipe did not live up to my expectations. It was rather bland and the garlic powder left a strange taste in your mouth. The sauce didn't caramelise at all which probably contributed to the lack of flavour. Won't be making again.

Great chicken recipe Keith! I used fresh garlic instead of the powder and I'm glad I read the reviews and knew to line my pan with foil ~ clean-up would have been a pain otherwise. I plan to use this recipe for my next "company dinner". Tonight, we pigged out on it ourselves. :-)

I would have given this recipe 3 stars if it hadn't been so tasty!  The recipe as written didn't turn out the way it said it would.  The coating didn't carmelize, but it was soooo good.  Who would have thought that honey, butter and garlic (I used fresh) would taste so good together.  This recipe needs alot more sauce.  I only made 6 breasts and it was barely enough.

If I were rating solely on ease of preparation, I would give this recipe 5 stars.  It was incredibly easy to prepare, and it turned out well.  The chicken was moist and did have a good flavor to it.  My only complaint is that it needs a bit more seasoning.  Next time I might use garlic salt instead of garlic powder, or I might add some more seasoning in addition to the garlic powder.  I'll definitely keep it in my recipe box, though.

Maybe I did something wrong...the glaze was thin and runny; the chicken was rubbery!

A delicate blend of flavours.  I couldn't get enough of the sauce!  Just the right amount of sweetness.

Its a great dish to enjoy with my preschooler who perfers simpler and non-"spicy" dishes.

Was good.  It was delicatly seasoned and I added quite a bit more garlic than the recipe called for.  Everyone enjoyed it.  Hubby took leftovers to work for lunch.

The chicken tastes fine. The taste is just bland. I even upped the amount of honey and garlic to no avail. I would have to say this is boring.

I used 6 drumsticks instead and marinated them in the ingredients for   5 hours.  The chicken came out juicy, slightly sweet and flavorful.  The leftover sauce tasted great mixed with rice.  The chicken itself has a very subtle taste, so it is not for those who are expecting a ton of flavor.

Sorry - but this just didn't taste that great to us.  My 5 year old liked it dipped in barbeque sauce but noone else was crazy about it.

This was sooooo good and I will make this again and again.  Yes the flavor was simple but fresh and light.  I used olive oil and fresh garlic.  I used chicken from the farm so the brests were very large so I pounded them flat and only used four.  I think the reason the onions didn't get crispy the way I thought they would because I added to much sause per some of the other reviews.  Next time I wont do that and add just a little more honey.  I did add a little lemon over the top and that was very good.  I served it with low fat creamed spinach very good.
