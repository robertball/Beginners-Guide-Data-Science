Delicious and so refreshing! Thankfully I was only making 1/3 of the recipe (I only had 1 bag of peaches) because that barely fit in my mid-size 7 cup food processor. To make 3 bags you would need something pretty big.   I'm not sure if the measurements are off, but there was nowhere near enough liquid to even get this to blend. I ended up having to use the juice of a full lemon (about 2-3 tablespoons) and almost a full orange (about 4 tablespoons) on just the 1/3 batch. The extra lemon turned out fine and perfectly balanced out the sugar without being too tart.  If you have leftover and need to freeze it, be sure to remove from the freezer ahead of time to let it soften up a bit.
