I made this for my husband and some of his teammates and they all RAVED about it!!  I would recommend about half of the hot sauce.  I also make rice to mix it with.  Delicious!

I used 1 Tbsp of the hot sauce because the  1/2 cup seemed a bit much. It wasn't that spicy and probably could have used 2 Tbsp. This recipe is more like a cross between chili and spaghetti sauce. I left the bell pepper and onion in large chunks to make it more stew like, as well as sliced the mushrooms rather than chop. If I were to make it again, I would serve it over pasta or rice. It wasn't bad, but I have a better spaghetti sauce recipe that I can add some hot sauce to.

DELISH!  Making it for the 3rd time for dinner tonight.  We use Frank's Red Hot as the hot sauce and it is awesome.  Totally recommend.

1/2 CUP of hot pepper sauce????  I didn't make this because that sounded like an awful lot.  Has anyone tried it?

A nice hearty and healthy "stew" to warm you up on a chilly day. This makes a HUGE pot, enough to freeze for later.  A few things....First, this really didn't seem like a stew to me, and definitely not something I'd call turkey mushroom stew. Like another reviewer mentioned, it really was a cross between spaghetti sauce and chili.  Take out the beans and you have spaghetti sauce.  Take out the Italian seasoning and you have chili. Turkey and mushrooms weren't the prominent ingredient or flavor.  Secondly, the 1/2 cup hot pepper sauce wasn't too much at all, which was the concern of some reviewers. I suppose if you use a brand that's crazy spicy it might be, but I used Frank's Red Hot as another reviewer suggested and it was the perfect amount of heat. Definitely not enough to get the nose running, just a nice bite.  Third, this recipe was seriously lacking in salt. I added about 1.5 tsp of salt to the finished product and it really made the flavors pop. In terms of the other seasonings in this recipe, these are the amounts I used: 2 tsp garlic powder, 2 tsp Italian seasoning and 1 tsp black pepper. Lastly, this came out really acidic. Normally when I make tomato-based sauces such as these, I add a bit of sugar to counteract the acidity. I tried that, but it was still overly-acidic so I then added about 1 tsp baking soda to the pot and that completely solved the problem.  Tomorrow I will serve my leftovers over spaghetti squash. :)

I was not that impressed with this recipe. I added garlic powder to taste and it just did not cut past the intense amount of tomato flavor. I tried adding half a cup more of hot sauce and it still wasnt satisfying. I will not be making this again.

1/2 c. pepper sauce??  WOW!!! I thought my tongue was going to fall out!  I didn't make this, hubby did and he said, "I followed the recipe." Next time I MAKE this, I will put 1/2 t. pepper sauce.  Then this will be good.
