This recipe was sooo good.  The pork was incredibly tender, I didn't have yogurt or chicken stock, so I used a container of sourcream and beef stock and it was awesome, one of the best pork recipes I've made.

This is very bland, no flavor at all.  The yogurt curdled and made the sauce sour.

Tasted like a pork pot roast with carrot dressing. Not a good use of a pork tenderloin.
