This is the best meatball recipe ever. I did not have onion soup mix. I used instead one packet of the Good Seasons Italian All Natural Salad Dressing & Recipe Mix instead. These meatballs melt in your mouth. I had also added two slices of torn white bread soaked in milk squeezing the milk out of the bread then adding it to the meat mix. The meat was very moist and sticky so I had bowl of warm water to dip my hands to make the meatballs. Every other meatball recipe I tried was dry and had no taste this is wonderful. Full marks A++++. Thanks for posting this recipe.

Wonderful and so easy.  I was looking for a meatball recipe that doesn't require browing the meatballs first.  This hits the spot.  I mixed up a triple batch and baked several cookie sheets of large meatballs and then several with smaller meatballs. I froze them individually on cookie sheets and then put them in Freezer Bags. They freeze well and taste great!

BEST. MEATBALLS. EVER.   Seriously! All the other reviews are right! Very simple to make, cooked perfectly, and these are the type of meatballs you will eat before they even make it to the sauce pot, I ate four straight out of the oven.  I made them exactly as the directions called, no alterations, and if you wanted to, you could add more spices or whatever your taste calls for, but they are perfect just the way they are.

A very simple recipe, I added 2 tablespoons of mustard, ketchup and worchester sauce to give it more kick.  Refridgerate the meat mixure for 3 hours and then make the balls, they will be easier to handle and a bit firmer.  Thanks Julie62

Wonderful. I made these a couple of nights ago for my boyfriend and for my mom.  My boyfriend absolutely loved them, said they were the best meatballs he'd ever had.  My mom just praised them!  I made two different batches.  One with ground beef/pork mixed together (for boyfriend), and one with ground turkey (for my mom and I).  They were both tasty, moist and just plain delicious. The only difference in my opinion (I snuck a little taste of both), was that ground turkey meatballs seem to fall apart more and easier.  I used fresh grated Romano cheese (was what I had). I made some sauce on the side for those who wanted, but mostly everyone just wanted the meatballs all alone.  So with a salad and some garlic bread...it was a scrumptious dish.  Thanks.

Mmmm so good and easy to make! The only thing I changed is that instead of dry onion soup mix I used italian dressing mix for some extra flavor. It was so yummy, I'll only make meatballs with this recipe from now on!

These were FANTASTIC! I made a few small changes but I'm sure the basic recipe is terrific as it is.  I substituted sausage for 1/3 of the meat and cooked them as directed, took them out of the pan and drained them, then put them back in the pan.  I mixed a can of regular cream of mushroom soup with a can of beefy mushroom soup (Campbell's) and a can of sliced mushrooms, and then poured that over the meatballs and popped them back in the oven for about 15 minutes until the sauce was bubbly and brown around the edges.  I served them over buttered egg noodles, and my husband (clever wit that he is) said, "Wow, these are delicious!  Think you can remember how you made them?"

I used ground pork that I got on sale for the ground meat. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. They were excellent. Very moist, yet firm. I ended up with almost 5 dozen meat balls, freezing about half of them

Excellent flavor! I used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup(it is what I had on hand) and ground turkey. I made a gravy with 1 can each of beef consume and cream of mushroom and 1 can drained mushrooms. Poured over the cooked meatballs and baked for approx 20 minutes (until bubbly). Served over noodles. Wonderful! this is a keeper!! Thanks for the recipe!

I was skeptical - but I had all the ingredients and decided to try it.  REALLY GOOD!  I did use ground turkey and had to use more bread crumbs to make it easier to roll into balls.  I will definately make again.

Wonderful recipe!  The meatballs are so juicy and moist!  I used extra lean ground beef and was worried they would be dry, but I think the cream of mushroom soup really makes it!  Very tasty!

These are very good meatballs!  Even my kids were snitching them off the baking sheet because they liked them so much.  I have made them twice now, once as written and once without the cream of mushroom but with some milk and extra seasonings and they were delicious both ways.  I will definitely be making these again!

Made this for dinner and I will have to say I have 2 boys that are very hard to please and they loved the meatballs, I was in shock.  My husband also loved them, he even said they were better than his Mothers..big compliment, she is a fantastic cook especially Italian.  I made this recipe as it was I just cut the portion in half and added salt, pepper and minced garlic..will definitely make it again!

These are easy to make and amazing! For anyone who wants just a good old meatball like grandma used to make, no silly ingredients! I was only able to get 2 before my boyfriend and family scarfed up the rest!

I finally got a chance to try this recipe and it was just perfect. I made it exactly so that I could rate it fairly. They were moist, not too spicy or bland...just right. Not having to fry them was even better...no mess! I used Reynolds no stick foil (this is a great baking tool..nothing sticks), which I use for all baking at they just slid right off. My husband can be such a pain with meatballs being just right. Many we even ordered out are just hunks of meat and no flavor. When he tried these, he said "who's meatballs are these?" and I said they were a recipe I found. He said they were great and that's all that counts...that we enjoyed them. I didn't even tell him there was mushroom soup in them since he says he doesn't like mushrooms...even though he said he's never eaten them. This recipe made so many that I even have enough for 2 more meals in the freezer. I also gave my neighbor some since she works late and would be able to just heat and eat...she loved them and thanked me so much for giving her such a delicious meal and for thinking of her.

Awesome- made enough for 3 meals.  Loved to bake them.  Be sure to turn them over after 15 minutes-or they get crusty and scorched! I forgot the parmesean cheese and they were great. we made spaghetti tacos with them

These were just as amazing as the reviews say.  I made mine a bit too large but cooked them longer and they turned out amazing.  I would love some ideas for a sauce  go with these.  They don't seem like they'd go with a tomato sauce.  That all being said-they are great solo. Delicious!

I love these meatballs and so does my family! My boyfriend is very picky about cooking at home and he loves these, and gets mad when I make them because he can't stop eating them!  He doesn't like Mushrooms so I substituted the mushroom soup for onion soup and it tastes great!  My 5 year old daughter loves them too.  I also like the fact that I don't have to fry these in oil, and I put them on a rack so the fat drips off.  Delish!

These were very yummy. I used ground turkey and they still turned out wonderful. I added some dried italian herbs. Would eb 5 stars but there seems to be something missing in the taste. I freezed the rest and pull them out to make a quick pasta meal now.

Best versatile meatball recipe ever.  I don't need to search for another.  I made these as written.  The key to tender meatballs is not to work the meat too much.  I mixed all of the dry ingredients together and added it to the meat, lightly mixing with my hands.  Then I added the eggs and cream of mushroom soup and lightly folded them in.  I now have 6lbs of them frozen.

I thought these were very tasty, however we used turkey to make them and they were so mushy.  I also cut the recipe to 1 pound of meat and adjusted accordingly.  I will make them again, but not with turkey.  Also, with just 1 pound it served all 5 of us with some rice... so 6 servings with 3 pounds of meat would make huge servings!  I'd say it feeds closer to 8 or 10.

Just made these... followed the recipe and realized I didn't have the onion soup mix.  I subbed a dry brown mushroom gravy packet.  They meatballs were awesome straight out of the oven!  Thanks for sharing!

My family devoured these!  The first time I made them, I followed the size that was indicated on the recipe.  They were really yummy, but fell apart more than I would have liked.  The second time around, I made them about half the size and they didn't fall apart and they also had a better texture - a little more crispy/solid and not too soft.

WAY too heavy on the bread crumbs... It was like filler. I will make again, but cut the breadcrumbs in half.

This was simple and used up items I usually keep in my pantry. It didn't call for a sauce so I used some more soup diluted with some milk to make one. I served this with buttered parsleyed egg noodles. This was good and filling and Dh is taking the leftovers for lunch tomorrow so it's worth a repeat.

The base recipe was good but i made the following changes. I used 2 lbs grd. bf and 1 lb sausage. Instead of onion soup mix, didnt have it, i used minced onion flakes. I used corn flake crumbs and gluten free mushroom soup. Will definately make again.

I have my own recipe for italian meatballs but wanted another meatball version to serve with brown gravy and noodles.  This is the one!  It made a lot of meatballs - I got 60 from this recipe so a lot went into the freezer.  My picky 7 year old loved these and even asked me to save the leftovers for his breakfast the next day.  Thanks!

Incredible!  If you do not love these meatballs something is wrong with you!  I did modify just a bit because i LOVE hot Italian sausage.  I wanted to double the batch but only had 5 lbs of meat and it still turned out fantastic.  I froze them for several future meals.

Very tasty and easy to make.  I left out the Parmesan cheese and added some garlic powder and pepper.  I ate a couple right out of the oven, they are so good.  I had plenty left and froze them individually and then put the frozen ones in a freezer bag.  thanks for the great recipe.

It was very good.  I didn't like the sound of the ingredients, but they came out really good.  The only alterations I used were a lot more beef and added some grated veggies.  I managed to package 4 large two person meals out of my batch.  (I used about 5 lbs of beef)

These meat balls are super good, with beef gravy over the top or by themselves. I did not see any reason to tweek them, they were great without changing a thing. Thank you, for the great recipe, everyone loved them!

I just made these meatballs, and didn't have cream of mushroom soup, so I used cream of chicken.  I also did not have dry onion soup mix, so I used a package of McCormick toasted onion & garlic seasoning. They are now baking in the oven, and I cannot wait to try them after reading so many wonderful reviews!!  I will definitely report back after dinner to let everyone know how they turned out!!  BTW, I absolutely LOVE this website.  BEST COOKING WEBSITE EVER!!!!

****OK.... I have to say these meatballs are NOT very good!!  They didn't necessarily taste bad... but they were INCREDIBLY MUSHY in texture.  I only used 1/2 of a can of cream of chicken soup, instead of the whole can in the recipe, AND, I baked mine for 45 minutes as suggested by other reviewers instead of 30. Still, they were mushy, and they were still mushy the following day when I thought they may be good for meatball subs.  I will make these again, and omit the creamed soup.

Really fantastic.  I used ground turkey instead of beef, which required a little more of the bread crumbs and parmesan to get to the right consistency.  They turned out delicious and this is the only meatball recipe I'll use from now on.

This was my first stab at making meatballs, and wow, they were delicious!!  My husband and our guest loved them.  Had to use regular breadcrumbs and add Italian spices, and onion dip instead of onion soup mix (realized after starting that I didn't have the onion soup I thought I did).  In any case, they turned out fantastic.  Will definitely be returning to this recipe when the time comes for meatballs!

No one in our family really cared for these. They are very soft and even tho very flavorful, we don't care for the flavor. I have had worse but I have had much better. I had an awesome meatball recipe years ago and lost it. My son said he doused them with BBQ sauce and they were much better. Everyone has different taste tho and thanks for sharing. Tunz of people love these.

Perfect! This recipe is just right. Everyone loved these meatballs and I will probably always make them like this. I only have one note and that is I suggest once or twice during cooking to use a baster and suck out some of the grease that will start to fill up the pan. This will vary depending on how lean you buy the beef of course.  But the flavor was awesome you could serve them alone.

Amazing!  We loved these - the only thing I did differently than the recipe was added minced onion and used about 1/2 pound sausage to finish up the entire amount of meat needed. Served over mashed potatoes and brown gravy, pan fried asparagus and hawaiian rolls. I used an ice cream scoop to help me keep the meatballs all about the same size.  I cooked 16 and froze 16.

Best. Meatballs.  EVER.  I have tried other, inferior meatballs and I'm sticking with these!  I followed the directions exactly (I actually measured stuff!!) with the exception that I used ground sirloin instead of beef, because I got an awesome deal on it.  Other than that, everything was to the letter.  We were planning on making meatball subs with these, but just ate them straight off the pan instead.  These were easy, delicious, and great the next day for lunch.  Thanks to you from my husband, as he can finally retire from being my meatball guinea pig!!  I will most DEFINITELY be making these again!
I have to add that I have made these again and again, still following the recipe to. the. letter.  Rarely does a bread crumb get measured in my household, but for these meatballs, the measuring cups make a much-needed appearance.  I've also taken to making a double batch, freezing half of them on a cookie sheet, and then transferring to a freezer bag.  Then I can just pop them in the oven for more meatballs whenever I want (which will probably coincide nicely with the day I run out of the first batch of meatballs!)

These are the BEST meatballs I've ever had!  I made the recipe as suggested.  I used 90/10 ground sirloin and fresh shredded parmesan.  I noticed some reviews complains of a mushy consistency so I baked my meatballs for closer to 40 minutes.  They were crispy (not burnt) on the outside and moist (not mushy) on the inside.  My husband is usually not a fan of meatballs but loved these.  Also, my picky toddlers gobbled them up.  The recipe yields 36 golf ball sized meatballs, but I got almost 60 golf-ball sized meatballs out of the recipe.  I froze about 2 dozen to enjoy down the road.  TRY THIS RECIPE - YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!

My kids, and husband could not get enough of these. I cut the recipe in half with the wonder of the all recipes converter, and they were perfect. We have had these twice in 1 week. I did not have the dry onion soup music, so I put some minced onions, and other herbs, with some sea salt.  We ate these with pasta and my red sauce, yum yum yum.

Outstanding meatballs! Incredibly easy and some of the best I've tried. These meatballs do come out a bit soft, but I think that's just taste preference. If you like them more firm, I would try using less egg.

OMG!! I made these at my brother's house for New years eve party and it was a major hit.  Everyone asked raved about it and my sister-in-law asked for the recipe.  I omited the onion soup and used the four season itallion packet one of the reviewer recommended. Thanks for the recipe!! this is a keeper!!!

Absolutly LOVED these meatballs! The only things I did different was increased cheese to 1/2 cup and added pepper. They were tender and flavorful. For those who thought they were not firm enough, I suggest not stirring or simmering in sauce. Just plop the hot meatballs on whatever you are serving and pour the sauce on top! Onion lovers might need the extra onion taste and sight of fresh chopped onions, but I didn't. Loved them just the way they were. So easy without doing any extra preparing. Enjoy!

I have had these meatballs hot, cold, in spaghetti, and with gravy over rice--they are always fantastic!  I usually mix in some crushed crackers with the bread crumbs, and about a tsp of dried parsley; they never disappoint!  The only thing I would recommend is to turn them once halfway through cooking because they form a little fat "skirt" around the bottom, which can make them less visually appealing.

I made this recipe exactly. I thought they were really yummy and had a nice flavor. The texture was a little soft, I would like a more firm meatball. We ate them two ways for dinner. Some of the family wanted subs and some of the family wanted them with mashed potatoes and gravy. I think they were better matched for the mashed potatoes and gravy. Will make again!

I don't like meatballs.  I really don't like anything with ground beef in general.  These were AMAZING!  I literally said "Wow" when I tried them even though I was standing alone in the kitchen.  I accidentally used condesned mushroom soup instead of regular mushroom soup, so they were moist and had a slightly stronger mushroom flavor without falling apart.

I can't believe that I have never reviewed this! I love this recipe and make it all the time. I freeze them in meal portions so I can add them to boring spaghetti or I'll even make Swedish meatball sauce and serve over mashed potatoes. great recipe!

This recipe is a gem! So glad I came across it. The meatballs came out absolutely delicious! The only thing I did differently was that I used ground turkey and added extra bread crumbs. So flavorful and yummy! I like that it's baked and the recipe doesn't call for browning them in a pan first. I will definitely add this to my monthly meal rotation. You can't go wrong with these ??

This is the first time I've weighed in on a recipe, but this one absolutely meritts an award!  Simple, and absolutely delicious! I made 1/3 of the suggested serving and my family (husband, 6yr old and I) had two meals out of it (with soup and salad). Everything I used (except the onion soup) was organic, which ramps up the taste another notch for sure.  My husband and son were raving over them and both have asked when we can have them again!  Next time, I'll make the a whole batch and freeze the left overs. Thank you so much for this tasty, versatile, easy recipe...this will be a "go-to" meal for years to come!

I made half of a recipe according to all the directions and we thought the meatballs were delicious.  Instead of making the smaller meatballs, mine were larger, and served over rice with a mushroom soup gravy.  Color was needed, so we had broccoli.  Delicious meal.

Meh. Although not "terrible," I've definitely had better.... My hubs liked these, but if he knew cream of mushroom soup was one of the ingredients, I'm sure he'd change his tune (he's so picky sometimes lol!). I was in need of a quick dinner and already had a 1.5 lb. package of ground beef handy, so I decided to give these a try. Prep couldn't have been easier (I'd award 10 *'s for that), but these just weren't as great as I thought they'd be. Using my 3 T Pampered Chef scoop, I made 15 uniformily sized meatballs (I was only feeding my hubs and I so I halved everything). Served with marinara sauce over spaghetti with garlic bread and a tossed salad on the side. In retrospect, I think these would pair MUCH better with a beef gravy - tomato sauce just didn't cut it, but that's just my $.02. :) Thanks anyways, Julie.

My family and I love this recipe! I used Parmesan croutons instead of Italian breadcrumbs as that was what I had on hand, I just ran them through the food processor first. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written wonderful!

Sooo E-Z to mix up quickly!  I didn't have Italian-seasoned breadcrumbs so just subbed 1/2 tsp. of Italian seasoning to the mix.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly with grand results.  I made a bunch and froze them a dozen to a bag.  Now I have instant meatballs in a flash!

Made these with ground turkey and they turned out a little mushy. It definitely needed some texture to it so next time I will add some chopped onion, carrot and maybe some parsley. Otherwise, the flavor was great. I also love how easy it was to prepare!

Absolutely delicious right out of the oven!!  Now I don't want to serve with sauce & spagetti as I'm afraid the taste of the meatballs will be concealed.  Thanks for a great recipe!

OMG!  Sheer heaven.  We all stood around and ate them as finger food!  My husband and I originally put some in a bag to freeze and the kids complained because they thought we only made a few.  We had to pull them back out and then they ended up eating almost all of them.  TOTALLY AWESOME RECIPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I reduced the recipe for 1 lb. of meat for two servings. It made 12 meatballs and three generous servings. I did not have any cream of mushroom soup, so I used blue cheese dressing instead. Yum! All other ingredients were used following the original recipe. I will make this again and may also incorporate the ingredients for meatloaf.

It was a simple yet great recipe!! I only had 1 lb of beef, so I changed the quantity and it was still great. Even though I cut it in 1/3 I still ended up with 30 meatballs!! They were really tasty as is as well as I put them in pasta sauce and they were great that way too!

Wow...that says it all! I followed the recipe exactly and what I got were the best meatballs ever! Very moist, flavorful, and melt-in-your mouth delicious. My boyfriend raved over them and even gave the recipe to his mother. That says a lot! Thank you for the recipe. I will definitely make them again and will probably even try it as a meatloaf.

These are delicious!!  The shopping list only calls for breadcrumbs, so I bought Panko.  Got home and found the recipe called for Italian bread crumbs, so I added some oregano.  Absolutely delicious.  I baked them in a pan that has a rack so that the meatballs are not cooking in their own juices.

This was delicious! I used whole wheat bread crumbs and a low sodium cream of mushroom soup and it turned out great! They were so moist, even after a couple of days.

The taste was really good.   But, they do have a bit of a mushy texture.  I used half a can of mushroom soup to see if that helped.  But, it didn't so my next guess is maybe the bread crumbs give it that texture?  Anyways, flavor is great..texture is a bit off.

I make almost the same meatballs, but try adding raisons. They sweeten the meatballs, and keep them moist, plus great for adding iron to the sauce that they're cooked in. Especially great for kids who won't eat the meat, but only the sauce. The raisons fortify the whole sauce with iron. Try it, you might like it!!

Oh my gosh these are sooo yummy.  I didn't have onion soup mix so I just used diced onion and 2 tbps of italian seasoning.  Also used 2 egg whites and 1 egg.  I will definitely be making these again soon.

These are absolutely delectable! I made half the batch and kept mine in a bit longer to get a little more crunch.  The inside was moist and the outside crunchy.  Besides that everything was to the measurement.  They went wonferfully with spaghetti squash and sauce!  Thank you for sharing such an EXCELLENT recipe!!

I'm sorry to say that these meatballs were not moist at all, they were quite mushy.  I am normally a fan of baked meatballs, and I've tried quite a few recipes, this being my least favorite.  I followed the recipe to a T, and they just came out very mushy, not sure if it was the soup or too many eggs.  For my second tray I added some stuffing mix to try and salvage the meatballs, this made them ok, but still not great.  Will not be making again.

These were good, they stayed together well, but I think they need a little more flavor, so you might want to add some more spices or some worcestershire sauce.

This is a great recipe that my family loves but I changed it a little bit.  I substituted one pound of the ground beef for one pound of ground sausage and I add a small piece of mozzarella to the center of half of the meatballs, the kids love these.  I take them to parties and everyone loves them.

I only had 1 pound of hamburger, so I cut everything by thirds. Very moist and tasty meatballs. So many times meatballs are dry and these were not. YUM!

This is a great recipe for meatballs. We especially liked the light consistency the meatballs had once cooked. You can really taste both the beef flavor as well as the essence of mushrooms and onion, which are not overpowering. Well done!

GREAT GREAT GRRREAT. Did not change a thing, though I did forget to grease the tin foil and paid the consaquences of a fit flecks of tin foil in the final product. I used low salt soup... but I always do.

Very good meatballs.  I've made them twice.  First time, I made them as the recipe states and they were VERY good!  The second time I made them with a packet of Ranch dressing and I wasn't as pleased with the flavor.  I'll switch back to the onion soup mix next time.

OMG! I followed the recipe as is and I must say these meatballs are not only easy to make, but they are so savory and delicious. I will make these again and again. I would not alter the recipe one iota. With the left over dried soup mix I made a gravy to cover them. WOW!

These are good meatballs for putting on top of pasta and then adding the sauce. They are so moist that if you mix too much they break in half. I made my husband's with Italian sauce and did mine in a creamy mushroom sauce and  we both enjoyed greatly. I didn't have the dry onion soup mix but that was the only thing omitted. Loved it!!

Very easy and great flavor.  My husband says it's the best meatball he's ever eaten.

I can't believe I made meatballs that taste this good myself, they have a really great flavor! The hubby said he will definitely want them again. Rather than regular leftovers, I tossed them in some spaghetti sauce the second night and they were even better. The only change I made to the recipe was I used a pound each of beef, pork, and veal. They are the perfect texture...not too tough or soft. I deducted one star only because personally I didn't prefer the dry veggie components in the onion soup mix and will probably opt for fresh diced onion next time around.

These were the yummiest meatballs I've ever had!  They were really soft and flavorful.  My husband is a meatball fanatic and he loved them.  I even used the same recipe to make a meatloaf.  So easy to make and with things you have on hand in the pantry.  This is the only meatball recipe I will make from now on.

This recipe was so super easy and the ingredients are all things I keep on hand all the time. A++++++++++++++ for taste, simplicity and overall composition!! This recipe made me over 25 meatballs, and amongst my famiy of four (including a son who doesn't usually eat meat, but gobbled these right up) they were all gone in a day!!

Yummy, and super simple to put together.  I also used Italian dressing mix in place of onion soup mix, and made them a little bigger than the recipe called for, so I ended up with about 2 dozen honkin' meatballs.  I froze what the family didn't finish and the leftovers reheated so nicely in a pot of sauce.  Maybe better than the first time around.  Thanks for sharing!

Awesome recipe! I wanted to try something different then the way I usually make my meatballs with spaghetti and saw this recipe, read the reviews and was grateful I had all the ingredients in stock. Well, except for Italian bread crumbs for I only had seasoned so I just added Italian seasonings. This was a hit with my family! My picky 9 yr old usually don't eat my meatballs but he ate these! I will be making these for now on!  Thank you for sharing! ???

This recipe deserves 10 stars! Moist, tasty ... I will never use another recipe again. These turned out so well, even though I did make a few changes. Because of what I had on hand I used half ground chuck and half ground pork, added granulated garlic, minced onion, fresh parsley and about 1/2 c of milk. I didn't intend to use that much milk, just slipped when I poured it, and worried that I might have ruined it but not at all. I used an ice cream scoop to get uniform sized meatballs and they baked up in  20 minutes. I didn't turn them over and got flat meatballs that didn't bother me a bit but if you want yours round, flip them over half way through. Terrific recipe.

I cut this recipe down since i was cooking for just two. Used 2# of burger, 1 cup of bread crumbs, and 2 eggs. Also only had Lipton Beefy Onion, but it added flavor. Still had plenty to freeze for another night when pressed for time.  Delicious!  Will definitely make these again!

A very easy and moist meatball recipe! They browned up nicely but were very moist inside. I did not make any changes to the recipe and will go back to this one many times. So much easier than those recipes that have you browning the meatballs on the skillet first.

We enjoyed these very much.  Only change I made was reducing ingredients by 1/3 (only had 2 lbs of ground beef), mainly by eyeballing the ingredients except for the bread crumbs, which could be measured appropriately.  Mine were only slightly mushy, and I believe that to be my fault, I'm sure they are great when it's the full recipe.  I made a "mushroom" gravy by making a brown gravy mix and adding in the rest of my cream of mushroom (made me feel better about not wasting lol, not sure if it really added anything), and adding a small can of mushrooms.  I served it over egg noodles and it was delicious.  My 2 lb recipe made 46 meatballs :)

I did not have the Parmesan cheese so I used one less egg and these meatballs came out extremely tender with great flavor! My family scarfed these down.. I cheated and used packaged brown gravy but made the mashed potatoes from scratch. This is a super easy and tasty recipe, especially for week nights and tight budgets. Thanks! I'll definitely be saving this one and making it again SOON!

I love this recipe!  We make it just as the directions say (super easy!), and it comes out awesome every time.  I always make extra for leftovers...and they ALWAYS get eaten immediately instead. Great flavor and texture, omnomnom. This recipe has become one of our "regulars."

Easy and good! Just got done making these and everyone in my family liked them except for my six year old who pretty much doesn't like anything. I made a simple gravy using just an envelope of brown gravy mix and about a fourth of a cup of sour cream and a dash of nutmeg. We topped the meatballs and our mashed potatoes with this gravy and it was great.
I love these type of meatballs and not so much the ones you find in tomato based sauces. I find good recipes for these typed of meatballs harder to find. For me baking meatballs always makes the process easier so that's another good thing this recipe has going for it. I will be making these again for sure!

did not use the onion soup mix not a fan added some beef base, garlic and onion powder, salt and pepper, and plain bread crumbs to meat mixture. To sauce added some sauteed fresh mushrooms and stirred in some sour cream at the end. Served over egg noodles delish.

I was surprised by how many meatballs this makes - it made around 120 meatballs.  I cannot see how 3 lbs of meat could possibly make 36 golfball-sized meatballs.  Be warned!

This was really tasty and a comfort food for us.  I made gravy on the side using cream of mushroom soup, a can of water plus a couple teaspoons of beef bouillon and dried minced onion plus salt and pepper to taste.  We will definitely make these again.

Totally yummy, I made them a little bit smaller and only cooked them for 20 minutes. Then I added them to the sauce. Everybody had second helpings.

Thanks Terri

These were delicious! I Even used the same ingredients plus some sour cream, water and fresh sliced mushrooms and made a gravy and served them over egg noodles! Yum!!! Thanks for the awesome recipe :-)

we LOVE this recipe!!!!  i have made it several times!!!  i do agree they are pretty soft and when i try to put them in my gravy (tomato sauce), they practically fall apart.  so now i just cook them a bit longer and don't put in the sauce until the very end.

My boys loved this. I followed the recipe to the letter and the only thing I would suggest is turning the meatballs at least once so they don't stick to the aluminum foil.

Made one substitution; cream of celery soup instead of mushroom. My husband is convinced every mushroom is poisonous! (Made mushroom gravy for myself while he enjoyed cream style corn on his mashed potatoes.) Next time will use a little Worcestershire and garlic salt and be sure not to overcook. Maybe ground chuck is too lean; will try with hamburger next time. Still, very tasty. Wondering about freezing: Do you cook first? Do you freeze in gravy? Do you reheat in microwave? Do the meatballs dry out much more?

I didn't have Onion Soup mix, so I used Italian Dressing Mix.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

These were not bad, but they were a little too soft for my liking.  I prefer a meatier meatball and were very light and fluffy.  Very easy recipe and would recommend to those who like softer meatballs.

These are really wonderful.  I wrote down all the different sauces and gravies, to have a variety.  I
also think these would be incredible on top of
scallopped potatoes to which sour cream and chives
have been added.  Just place on top and cook like
your potato recipe says.

My husband really likes the flavor of these better than the usual meatballs I make.  They turned out a little mushy, though they were cooked all the way through.  Next time I will cut back on the amount of soup and maybe one egg, or add a little more bread crumbs.  Thank you for the recipe.  It was easy and tasty.

WONDERFUL RECIPE!  We have had these meatballs in sandwiches, on whole wheat pasta, and on mashed potatoes with gravy.  The whole family loves them!  One small change, I use about half the bread crumbs just to cut back on the 'bad carbs' where I can.

I had never tasted meatballs this delicious, much less cook them this well myself! They are absolutely perfect, and to my surprise, literally do melt in your mouth! I made them with half ground turkey to make them a little healthier and added chopped onion for a little more flavor. Perfectly delectable.

Definately not the consistancy I like in a meatball. It was very mushy. I used a combination of ground beef and ground pork. Maybe I will try it again with just beef and see how it turns out.

These were so awesome!  I was worried they wouldn't work in an spaghetti and meatball fashion, but I added some italian seasoning, coated and topped with marinara, and placed on top of pasta.  Oh, I also left out the egg and it was perfectly fine--probably better off as is wasn't as crumbly and held together better with less liquid.  My husband ate half of the batch!  It does make a good bit of food for 2, but you can freeze what you don't use!

Decent recipe. I should have used a little more spices, since I usually prefer more of an 'edge' to my meat dishes. But I got many compliments on this one.

I followed this recipe with the exception of the onion soup mix. Per other reviews, I decided to  use Italian dressing mix in place of onion soup mix. I also added 1 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp onion powder. I put hamburger mixture in fridge to firm up. I think leaving them in the refrigerator for a few hours before forming into meatballs makes a big difference. I had no issues with the meat being too wet. It was very easy to work with.I cooked them as per the recipe and they came out amazing! Little meatballs full of flavor. They don’t come with a sauce and they don’t need them. I just served with chef John’s mashed potatoes and french style green beans. Everyone was happy. Thanks for a great recipe!

Didn't use dry onion package or the cheese. Add extra seasoning in the place of the package and it was delish... will be making this again. Husband loved it and he ate leftovers. My husband don't eat leftovers.

I wasn't able to follow the recipe exactly because I had less meat but I just reduced the other ingredients to make it work.  They got a little burned on the bottom but I'm sure thats something I did wrong. Put a brown gravy over them and they were amazing. Thank you for sharing.

Nobody makes meatballs like my mother in law, until this recipe. My wife and daughters love this. ‘My daughter now make this for their families.I’ve made this as written;with 1. Lb ground turkey 2 lbs ground beef,; substituting 1 kB ground sausage. No mater what I do it’s a hit. My only consistent modification is a can of golden cream of mushroom soup instead of the regular. Since I’m recently retired and have assumed the cooking duties this is definitely in my regular roatation. If I go to long without making it I’m reminded.

These meatballs are exceptional ! I use cream of chicken soup, add some ricotta cheese and cayenne pepper. We love spicy foods and the cayenne pepper really makes them stand out. I've used them for spaghetti, meatball sandwiches and  just something to snack on. 
I've been making these for a LONG time. 
Thanks for the great recipe !

These meatballs are very good.  The only addition I added was a teaspoon of garlic powder.

This is a good recipe. Me and my husband really enjoyed it. I added A sauce that I made with just a little bit of cream of mushroom from the leftover meatballs and milk and add some seasoning and simmer down. It ended up being a really good meal served with rice thank you for the recipe.

Made about 72 meatballs using my 1.5 T scoop. I used the Dry Onion Soup Mix recipe on this site. Extremely easy to mix together,  scoop out onto a cookie sheet, and bake. Delicious by themselves with no sauce and taste like Swedish meatballs, probably because of the cream of mushroom soup. After cooking, I divided these into 5 batches and froze 4.  Tonight, I served these with the gravy part from Turkey Swedish Meatballs. The left-overs will make an extremely easy dinner entree on a very busy night.

I was looking for a meatball recipe that wasn't doused in either barbecue or marinara sauces.  Tried these and they were perfect.  Thanks for sharing!

I can see why some thought the recipe called for too much bread crumbs.  I cut it in half as well as the mushroom soup.  I like to taste the beef.  I used Asiago instead of parmesan, which I grated coarsely.  These were perfect.  They were tender and full of flavor.

This was a good recipe but it lacked something. I did add wet bread to help it bind but i do not think that it altered the flavor very much. I did not have any onion soup mix so I made mine from a recipe off this site. I feel like it needed a bit more salt and something else maybe. Not real sure.

I made this for dinner last night. I followed one reviewer's advice and decreased the breadcrumbs, but the meatballs came out too wet. I cooked them for about 15 minutes longer than the recipe suggested and that helped. I had been afraid that the onion soup mix would be overpowering, but it wasn't at all. I served them over buttered egg noodles and put a semi-homemade sauce of Ragu,1/2 a stick of butter, and 1/4 cup of cream over the top. The final dish was yummy for everyone in the family. My 2.5 yr old cleared his plate and my 4.5 yr old asked for seconds. Wow. What a hit!
