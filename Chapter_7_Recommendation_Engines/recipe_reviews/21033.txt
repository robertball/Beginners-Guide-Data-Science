This was awesome. I tweaked it a bit by adding 1 tsp minced garlic and I subst. red pepper flakes (1 heaping tsp)for the paste. I found this recipe at the last minute so I didnt marinate. I used 10 chicken tenderloins, removed the tendons, fat, etc, and cut into bite sized pieces. I then put the chicken in a 9x13 pan and poured enough of the marinade to cover chicken. I covered with foil and baked at 350 for 35 min. stirring halfway through to make sure chicken was covered evenly with sauce. I reduced the remaining marinade in a saucepan, added a bit more water and thickened with cornstarch. When Chicken was done, I added some steamed broccoli florets and the thickened sauce right to the 9x13 pan and tossed to coat, served over jasmine rice. NO leftovers in my house, My husband ate 3 helpings! Even my 2 and 3 year olds ate it up! Definitely a keeper!

I served chicken with this marinade to my Korean parents for dinner.  My mom, who said she wasn't hungry before we started eating, ended up going back for seconds and exclaimed that it was delicious.  The only changes I made was to decrease the sugar by 1/3 C(trying to make it healthier), and add minced garlic and a touch of sesame oil.  Gotta have garlic when you're making Korean!

This is a keeper in my house--especially for my picky husband who loves to BBQ.  I took the advice of others and used red pepper flakes since they are handy, added crushed garlic and sesame seeds sprinked on top, and reserved some of the marinade (thickened with cornstarch) to pour over the chicken and the other side dishes.  Thinking ahead the next time, I doubled the marinade.  I used half of the marinade for that nights dinner and put the other half of the marinade with a few pieces of raw chicken in a ziplock for a second dinner.  I put that bag of marinading chicken in the freezer.  It marinaded while it froze, then 2 weeks later it marinaded while it defrosted for about 48 hours in my fridge.  It made for an easy dinner--we threw it on the BBQ and made some rice and veggies.  Thanks for the great marinade!

This is awesome!! If I could give it 10 stars I would!  Use as a marinade, over noodles with or without veggies, hot or at room temp (like cold sesame noodles) or in a stir fry thickened with a little cornstarch!!  Definately add the lemon juice - it adds a very nice tone.  I usually add some sesame oil and garlic (either powder or minced) as well.  YUM!

I like this recipe, but it needed some sesame seeds, sesame oil, and green onions.  With those ingredients added, this recipe is perfect!

I didn't have any Korean chile paste and I don't often use enough of it to buy a jar. So I substituted half the amount in crushed dried red chile pepper powder, a clove of garlic (it isn't Korean without garlic), a bit of white pepper and a few drops of toasted sesame seed oil.

I put the chicken in the marinade one morning, but couldn't get to it until the next night, 48 hours later.  I was afraid it would be too salty, but after I broiled it in the oven, my husband announced "it's a keeper!"  Served over steamed rice with coleslaw on the side.

Full circle!  I'm an American living in Korea and I have shared this recipe with Koreans who absolutely love it!  Locally chicken sticks are more popular than teriyaki (Japanese) bowls.  These are milder and meatier than yakitori in Japan.  They are made with thigh meat and they taste great already.  My marinade has made the stand I shared it with MUCH more successful.  This is certainly sufficient research for a commercial venture.  If the pattern of American's here is any indication, such a stand at a ball park, a street corner, an airport  or a campus would be fantastically successful.

So Il-Byung means private first class So in Korean.  One can only assume that this guy (or maybe a gal) studied Korean in the Army or lived over here and pickled up the culture.  But the chicken bowls mentioned are a U.S. phenomenon.

Very easy to prepare and loved by my 1 year old up to my 19 year old.  (kid friendly)  I used Schezuan sauce for the chile paste since I couldn't find that, and it wasn't too hot for the kids.  I stir fried it instead of grilling it-the sauce made so much, I marinaded the chicken for several hours in most of the sauce, but I reserved 1 cup.  To this, I added 2 Tbsp. cornstarch, and set aside. I stir fried vegetables, and poured the remaining marinade over cooked vegetables and served this with the chicken.  It had a wonderful flavor and my kids ate all their vegetables, (as well as their chicken)  Can't wait to try this grilled!

Delicious, Delicious, Delicious.  I cut up some chicken tenderloins and stir-fried them in this sauce and ate it over rice.  I occasionally use this in place of soy sauce when I stir-fry veggies as well.  I usually keep a batch of this in my fridge to use on the asain dishes I make.  Don't know how this works on other cuts of meat, but the chicken seems to dance with this on it!!

A keeper for sure!  I used fresh ginger and added a bit of fresh garlic as well,  I have used this sauce as a marinade for chicken breasts, which I later grilled.  Equally popular, I poured the sauce over chicken thighs and cooked in a crock pot.  Both ways the chicken was terrific!

Great recipe! Thanks so much.  Our family is all on Weight Watchers, and after reading other reviews, I subed in Splenda instead of the sugar.  Also, since I didn't have the chili paste, I used Red Pepper flakes.  Faboulous!  The chicken breasts were moist and very flavorful.  You do need to turn them often on the Bar-B-Que so they don't burn. My husband has been using the leftovers on sandwiches.  It's even good cold.  Appreciate the recipe.

5 stars for being an awesome base recipe.. I started by following the recipe, honest. I did not have time to marinate.. decided to use as a stir-fry sauce.. Used half- white sugar and half- brown sugar. added cornstarch. added garlic. used minced ginger, not dry. used dry minced onion instead of dry powder. veggies, chicken, rice noodles... yum finished off with a sprinkle of sesame oil, sesame seed and green onions.. The bomb. My 12 yr old scarfed it down...

Excellent.  Be sure not to baste with this high-sugar sauce during grilling as the sauce will burn.  After grilling, slice up your meat and put it in a bowl of meat including rice, steamed brocolli, cauliflower, carrots and cabbage.  Boil the marinade down by 25-50% and use as a sauce over everything,  it makes a very sweet and tasty gravy!  This is very authentically asian--I've had this sort of meal in Japan, Korea, Beiling...and even in Europe!  It's superior to any sauce I've tasted in California, Oregon or Washington and probably as good as the sauces in Asia.  I use this marinade at least weekly and keep it on hand in the refrigerator for both marination and as a sauce.  The sugar will precipitate under refrigeration, so microwave rewarming to at least 40ºC (lukewarm) is recommended.

I wasn't crazy about this one, I just can't put my finger on what needs improvement.  Try the Japanese Chicken Wings recipe on this site as a marinade/rice bowl sauce.

This marinade was really good! I followed the directions exactly except the 4 teaspoons of hot chile paste. I thought the lemon added a nice touch to the flavor & I used chili powder in place of the paste. I wound up marinating the chicken for only 2 hours (found this recipe at the last minute) & baked the chicken, covered with foil, for a half hour, and then without foil for about 15 minutes to brown/crisp the chicken. It was great! I had followed the suggestions of others to put this on veggies also, but that was "too much" flavor. So my personal recommendation is to only put this on the chicken and let the sides be. Will definitely make again!

A pretty good marinade for chicken! I followed the recipe exactly, cutting it in half for 4 large chicken breasts. I used red pepper flakes in place of the chile sauce and DID use the lemon juice, which I think brightens the flavors. I marinated for 24hrs and was afraid it was going to end up being to long and that the soy sauce would make it too salty, but this did not happen at all. It was excellent in flavor and the chicken was tender and delicious. However, I did wish it was a bit more "saucy" as the marinade just kind of soaked into the chicken. Maybe next time I will baste as I grill or serve extra marinade on the side as a dipping sauce. Will definitely make again!

This was really very good! I did not find it too salty as some reviewers said.  I did not have chili paste, so I used hot pepper flakes.  I also used a whole chicken, not cut-up, marinated for 4 hours and baked in my oven.  I inverted the whole chicken on a soda can that contained some water.  This allowed the chicken to remain upright while cooking.  Great flavor and very moist.  Used this with steak too.  Fantastic!

Very good & easy!  Did not have onion powder & just threw in chopped onions.  I added a little sesame oil after sauce was cooled..I believe that whenever I ate Korean BBQ Chicken (in Hawaii) I tasted a hint of sesame oil.

Man, this was a great marinade!  I've sent the recipe to family members that I know will love it too.  We made a couple of changes just to lighten it up a bit.  Used 3/4 cup Splenda instead of the 1 cup white sugar, and only did 1 tbl. chili paste since we like it spicy, but not rip-roarin' spicy!  We also reserved some of the marinade to make a sauce with a little cornstarch.  Grilled the chicken and served over rice.  Great recipe that we will use again and again!

Wow!  I have got to say that this marinade is so good!  I made half the recipe since it made plenty for the chicken tenderloins that I had.  I planned on grilling the chicken and only had about 3 hours of time to marinate.  I just made sure to tenderize the chicken with a jaccard to help the marinade to get into the meat better.  The end result was absolutely delicious!  The meat was so juicy, tender, and most of all, so flavorful!  I did add in some crushed garlic to the sauce, along with a little crushed red pepper.  I used srirachi in place of the chili sauce, and added a little less since it is very spicy.  I love the other ideas of people making a sauce out of this instead of a marinade.  I will definitely try that sometime with this.  Thanks for this great recipe!  It really is good and I plan on making it lots more!

This marinade was fabulous! Like other users, I added 1 tsp. of minced garlic, and I also used 1 heaping tsp. of crushed red pepper in place of the chile paste. I also used 1/3 cup of sugar and 1/3 cup of Splenda. I took chicken breast and cut it into chunks, put it into a baking dish, and covered it with the sauce. I baked it at 350 for 20 min. I made a stir fry of snap peas, broccoli, and carrots using sesame oil, and then added water and cornstarch to the remaining sauce to pour over the cooked veggies as a side to the chicken. When the chicken was finished, I added cashews and then let it warm in the oven at 200 degrees. So delish!

This recipe is good, however I used brown sugar instead of white sugar and I had to add garlic.  Garlic is an essential ingredient in Korean cuisine.

Saved time by cooking cubed chicken in the sauce, rather than marinating it ahead of time, as another reviewer suggested.  I used all of the ingredients but did not use much chile paste.  I added in a little sesame oil and served this with brown rice and broccoli.  It was very good.  If I use this again as a sauce, I might try to thicken it before cooking the chicken in it.

I added three crushed garlic cloves, used fresh ginger and onions, and omitted the lemon juice.  It was delectable!

This marinade was EXCELLENT!  I used Splenda instead of regular sugar and it didn't compromise the dish at all.  I wasn't able to marinate the chicken so I baked it at 350 degrees for about 35 minutes in the marinade in a shallow dish.  It came out delicious!  We used some of the extra marinde it was baked in and drizzled it over jasmine rice.

This recipe quickly became one of my favorites!  Is wonderful for making chicken & pineapple kabobs.  I added about a tablespoon of GARLIC chile paste and some fresh garlic... was delicious!

Great!  Did not have chili paste, so added a pinch of red pepper flakes to the liquid before bringing to a boil.  Awesome.

You can't go wrong with this.  I don't even cook the marinade, just stir it up.  I don't measure the ingredients, either, just estimate.  It's a forgiving recipe.  Try fresh lime juice in place of the lemon--YUM.

I thought this was just ok. I took the suggestion from Dr. Larry below and served it over rice with steamed veggies. For my taste, it would be important that garlic is added in here somewhere! Thank you for the recipe!

YUM-MY!  This dish is soo good!  I was a bit confused since it's so similiar to the chicken teriyaki on this site, with only the addition of water and the lemon juice..(so was it Korean or Japanese?) Well it's definitely got the Korean taste just like in the restaurants!  My husband liked this much more too!  I used fresh grated ginger and marinated it overnight and baked it at 350.  I'm sure if we had a grill it would taste much more authenthic though.  Will definitely add into our rotation!

A little salty. I would not marinate the meat over 24 hours. Except that, it is very delicious though.

This recipe was awful. I even took half of the soy sauce as suggested by multiple people. But it still ruined my whole chicken. The flavor was just bad. The chicken was nice and tender roasted on the grill. It was just the outside flavor from the marinade. It had a flavor I can't describe. Awful. I never threw out any chicken before, no matter the seasoning/marinade. But this was just too strong/heavy/awful.

Great and easy marinade.  Followed other reviewers' suggestions and added sesame oil, fresh garlic and red pepper flakes.  I saved a half cup of marinade and thickened with cornstarch, but my husband and I did not think think this was needed.  The chicken was flavorful enough.  Husband is Korean and he really enjoyed this dish!  Thanks for a great recipe!

not bad - marinated chicken breasts for 6-8 hrs and baked in the oven for 30 mins.  might be better to marinate overnite and prob better on the grill.  will add more hot chile paste and soy sauce next time!

Very tasty and easy marinade for chicken! Got raves from parents and kids. I used fresh garlic instead of onion powder and added some sesame seeds.  Will definitely make again.

I marinated this for the time specified, but I feel that overnight would have worked better for me.  The flavor was wonderful.  I made extra sauce and saved it so it could be spooned over white rice, which was really good.  Thanks for sharing!!

Used this recipe on boneless skinless chicken breasts. Made a lovely sweet sticky exterior to the chicken. This makes enough for 2 uses in our opinion, when used as a baste. Reminded us alot of Yakitori chicken.

So easy and so good. When I tasted the marinade after it had simmered, it was very concentrated and salty. I added an extra cup of water at that point and then marinated the chicken. The grilled chicken was perfect, not overly salty but nicely flavored. I drizzled a bit of the marinade that I had set aside over jasmin rice with green onions....we loved this!

Great marinade! I didn't add as much sugar(less than half)and had to leave out the hot stuff. I also threw in some green onion. I can't decide which way I like better,as a stir-fry, or on the grill. It's awesome both ways!

This recipe was very good! I added garlic and lots of it...Korean food is full of garlic! That is what this recipe was missing! I made it as written but added the garlic and I grilled it. Be careful if you plan to grill..there is alot of sugar in this recipe and it will burn fast. Medium coals and have a safe spot on the grill to move them after they get their grill marks and can finish cooking slow.

I make this marinade with chicken drumsticks and thighs and bake it in the oven. I usually cook the chicken at 400 for about 30-40 minutes and they come out very juicy and the skin gets a little caramelized. Oh my goodness, the skin on the chicken is so flavorful! Definitely give this recipe a try and you won't be disappointed!

This is an awesome recipe. Made without chile paste,tastes great. Then,since I still didn't have chili paste, I decided to make with a couple of dashes of cayenne and garlic powder and a few Tablespoons ketchup - was also good.  Thanks

I've made this a few times and substituted the sugar for Splenda because my boyfriend is diabetic.  It still turns out great even with the Splenda and I've even substituted the chicken for pork before and it was great.  My boyfriend is Korean and he loves it so I think it passes the test!   Thanks so much!

This marinade was EXCELLENT! But it wasnt as great as my mother-in-laws BBQ chicken marinade. (that involves more ketchup and honey...a little different.) Anyway I marinated chicken thighs for about 6-7 hours and then bbq them. I took the rest of the marinade and reduced it down then put on chicken while slow cooking it. I probably turned them over like 5-6 times. The sauce got very thick and was beautiful. As far as taste goes...it was great. The only complaint is TOOO much ginger. I probably shouldnt have put in a teaspoon of crushed ginger. Next time I will leave that out. Otherwise, very sugary, but mm mm good. I recommend this because it took 3 minutes to but the marinade together!!

I have a favorite Korean restaurant where I've been in love with their Spicy Chicken box for years now.  I've been trying to figure out their recipe with no luck until now. Wow, what a recipe! Marinade the chicken with the sauce as indicated then grill.  Then take 1 cup of the sauce and whisk in 2 tbsp corn starch & bring to a boil.  It thickens quickly.  Add peppers if you like it spicy. Then add to cut-up grilled chicken & dig in! Soooo goood!

just like another rater stated, 'the taste was nice but very subtle'

I marinated the chicken wings for 2 days, and the sweetness didnt really come out. It wasn't what I expected. I would eliminate the water, or at least 1/2 of it; it really does drain the taste.

Edited my rating after first using this marinade successfully for a guest dinner using chicken thighs.  This time it was for our group's food booth.  I adjusted this recipe for a lot more chicken (10 1-gal bags of cubed chicken) but used everything in the recipe only added more GARLIC (added 1 teaspoon garlic powder like before but added 1 tablespoon minced garlic this time.)  Seriously, our food booth for hot chicken sticks was the busiest with a long line that lasted until we finally sold out.  Thanks this spicy marinade is a keeper!

This marinade is awesome!  It makes the chicken very moist and flavorful.  I used low sodium soy sauce and it was perfect.  It definitely would've been too salty for me if I'd used regular soy sauce.  I cooked the chicken on my George Foreman and it worked great.  I made extra sauce and added cornstarch to thicken, and served the chicken and sauce in rice bowls with broccoli.  My husband loved it!  I will definitely make this again.

Absolutely delicious! What an easy meal. If you want to be a little more adventurous, try adding 1 tsp of chopped garlic to the marinade. It adds some complexity, although the marinade is still fabulous without it. It's also excellent as a base for stir-fries or simply frying up some veggies in the leftover marinade as a side dish.

This is definitely the best marinade I ever had!  The sauce was terriffic.  Grilling was not that messy too.  And the best part of it was the leftover sauce...I tried stewing beef cubes in it and topped it with toasted sesame seeds and slices of leeks.  Yummy!!!!  It's sweet and hot.  A very good topping for rice.  Just make sure you adjust the chili so that the kids will enjoy them too!!! My son asked me to store more beef stews in the freezer using this receipe so that he won't miss having them when am out.  GREAT!!!!

I loved this!!  I substituted red pepper flakes for the paste.  It was really great to find a home-made marinade that I like. Gave my chicken a sweet, tangy carmelized texture.  I marinaded it for quite a long time, though.  Anyway, I'll definitely be using this again, next time I'll add more pepper flakes.

His recipe is awesome.  I don't think I'll use another marinade again!!  I used it on boneless skinless chicken thighs and ate it with rice, Korean paste and lettuce.  Yum!!  I loved the spicy pepper paste.
Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Great recipe ! I needed a replacement recipe for Korean bbq when my local Korean store closed and was lucky to find this one. I added some minced garlic(4 cloves) and sesame oil(tspn) as some have suggested and my results were over the top !! I marinated my chicken thighs for 24 hours (added some sliced onion as well for marinade) and grilled them on high heat on my gas grill making sure I got some "char" on them for that added flavor. Just make sure you don't walk away from the grill too long as the sugar in the recipe will cause burning.Served my sliced thighs over white rice with green beans sauteed in a blazing hot cast iron skillet with a little vegetable oil and a splash of sesame oil for that added asian twist ....good eats !

I don't really care for chicken but this is amazing!!  After eating Korean BBQ at a mall I thought how hard could it be to re-create, and this turned out even better!!  After reading the other reviews I made just a couple of slight changes: Used fresh onion & garlic, instead of hot chile paste I used 1tsp of red pepper flakes, and even though I had never used sesame oil before I took the advice of others adding 1tsp and what a difference it made!!  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs marinated for 24hrs and put them on the BBQ on low, and wow so good my guests did not stop eating until it was all gone!!  Thanks for this recipe!!

Followed suggestions as other reviewers by cutting down the sugar by 1/3, used low sodium soy sauce & also cut down to 2/3 C. Used fresh minced onions, minced garlic & ginger as well.  Fresh ingredients really do make a difference. Heated some reserved sauce for dipping.  The ingredients used here are generally in most Asian recipes - don't really see how this is "Korean" except maybe it has the chili paste. Also, the description says "four tablespoons [of chili paste] is usually as much as anyone can take" but the ingredients listed calls for 4 teaspoons hot chili paste. There must be a typo somewhere - 4 TBS is much more than 4 tsp.

Definitely worth keeping for future use.

This was very easy and tasty.  I adjusted for 10 servings (to make sure I liked it).  I will now make a full batch and keep it in the fridge for easy access.  Would also be good on beef and fish!  Thanks!

This is a keeper!  Easy to make and has good flavor.  Made as written.  Made again using fresh grated ginger & minced garlic.  We like the 2nd way better.  Next I want to try it in an Asian themed pasta salad & I'll add the marinated grill chicken in too!

I thought this was great! I used brown sugar instead of white sugar but that was my only substitution. I grilled the chicken and it was tender and juicy I didnt think it was too salty at all.

Way too salty.  I normally like things on the salty side, but this was too much.  Would use low sodium soya sauce next time, or reduce substantially.  Also will try brown sugar instead of white next time.
Added fresh minced garlic, sesame oil, sesame seeds and used hot chile peppers in place of the chile paste.

This is an awesome marinade! Very versatile! After thickening up the sauce in a small sauce pan, I used it to coat some pan-fried tofu! Delicious! I also used up the leftover sauce with a drizzle of white vinegar as a salad dressing. I also tried in on chicken and it was a big hit with my picky Korean father! As the other reviewers suggested, I changed the recipe by adding a drizzle of sesame oil and a dash of garlic powder for an even consistency. I also omitted the lemon juice because I didn't have any lemons on hand. Oh, for this recipe, try to use hot chilie paste (gochujang, which you can find it at any Korean grocery store) because it makes a big difference than just adding the conventional red pepper flakes. If you can't find gochujang, then substitute by adding a bit of Gochugaru, which is Korean hot pepper powder. Next time, I think I'm going to put this sauce over baked fish! :)

This recipe was super yummy and easy. I cooked it in the slow cooker on high for 4 hours and added a little bit of honey and chopped garlic. My boyfriend loved it and so did I!

We enjoyed this very much!  I made 1/4 of the recipe which yielded me a scant 1/2 cup after simmering for five minutes.  As other reviewers suggested I did add a clove of garlic, minced, and after it had cooled I added some sesame oil, omitted the lemon juice and added chile paste to taste - mine is really hot stuff!  I used half for marinating and thickened the other half with a little cornstarch and drizzled it over the chicken when serving.  Very nice flavor and we will make this again.  The only issue I have with this recipe is the number of servings.  There is no way the recipe serves 48.  I would say more like 8.  We barely had enough for 2 chicken breasts making 1/4 of the recipe.  So keep that in mind if you decide to make this.

A-Mazing!!! I didn't have the onion powder so I used garlic powder instead. And like one the of other reviews, I added cornstarch to thicken the marinade to use as a sauce over noodles.

I'm going to have to try this again. My grill decided to run out of gas, so I had to use my George Foreman....would have loved loved to use the grill, hence in the process of that, when I looked at the recipe and I totally messed up.....for some reason, I didn't pay attention to the part of heating the sauce up on the stove top before adding the chicken and THEN marinading.....BIG Ooops!! I just threw it all in together and let it meld. It still tasted great, but on a George Foreman harder to brush extra sauce on it while it's grilling. But over all, the flavor was mild but really nice, the kids totally enjoyed the chicken and were totally bummed it wasn't on the outdoor grill. SO We will make this again, and I didn't add the optional chile paste.

Great marinade! I also added garlic and used red pepper flakes as several other people suggested. I only used half the marinade to marinade 3 chicken breast so the other half I thickened and served over the chicken. Even my picky 15 year old daughter thought it was great.

I used this marinade as a STIR FRY instead. I thickened it with corn starch as one other reviewer suggested. It was really, really good. I gave it four stars because I would probably reduce the sugar next time -- it was very sweet and it worried me adding an entire cup of white sugar. Maybe I'll cut the sugar in half next time or add some honey or agave syrup next time to make it healthier than white sugar. Made this with chicken and veggies and served over brown basmati rice. So easy -- which is worth one of the 4 stars alone.

This is a really good base marinade. I doubled the recipe and froze half with chicken and the other half with pork and both turned out awesome! It was very moist and flavorful. I made the recipe as is and then added orange zest & juice for the pork; and added fresh grated garlic and additional chili flakes with the chicken. Delish - A total keeper!

Because I couldn't find chili paste, I used 3t chili sauce (plastic bottle with rooster on it in the asian foods section, not the sweet one) and added 1T chopped garlic. Fantastic - not too sweet, with enough spice to make you mouth tingle just a little. I reserved part of the marinade, added a little cornstarch to thicken over heat and served over rice.  This recipe beats the 'baked teriyaki chicken' because you never get the sometimes overwhelming vinegar flavor.

Im giving this 4 stars because my husband really likes it and he doesnt usually like chicken all that much.  But for me, it just isnt sweet enough.  I have tried doubleing the sugar and it still wasnt sweet.  Also, it didnt seem to completely marinate through the whole piece of chicken, just the skin, even with over 48 hrs marinading.  I will try something ekse to see if I can make it a bit more sweet as well as make sure the taste is soaked all the way through.

Pretty tasty.  I used Splenda instead of sugar and added a tsp chopped garlic.  I marinated small pieces of chicken overnight and baked in the oven.  I think they would have tasted better cooked on the stove or on the grill to caramelize a bit.  I served the chicken with whole wheat noodles and frozen stir fry veggies drizzled with some reserved sauce thickened with cornstarch.

This recipe is just simply amazing. I made it for my students and they absolutly loved it. Thanks for the recipie, I did tweek it a little with a little more ginger and a clove of fresh garlic, and I let the sauce simmer for a little longer so it would carmalize better. I also replaced the chile for red pepper flakes and it still gave it that bite. Thanks again.

Wow, wow, wow!  I even made the recipe wrong and it came out fabulous!  I forgot to cook it before marinating--I was in a hurry and just focused on the ingredients.  Anyway, I halved the recipe for 3 large chicken breasts, which I had pounded flat.  I then threw everything in a bag and marinated for a full day.  Then we grilled it up.  The chicken actually tasted like thigh meat because it was so tender and flavorful.  The only (other) change I made to the ingredients was to add pepper flakes in place of paste, and I threw in a chopped green onion and some some minced garlic.  Wow--I wonder how it would turn out if I actually cooked it(?)  My husband loved it!

My review for this is a little odd. I reduced the marinade, as many others, thickened it and made a sauce. THIS was awesome. I love to used Wondra, as I find cornstarch tends to make this type of sauce "slimy".
I have come to decide, however I'm not a fan of poultry marinaded in soy sauce (especially with lemon or lime juice as it tends to "cook" the chicken). I feel it just comes out with an odd taste and texture. Next time I make this I will grill unmarinaded chicken by itself and use the sauce to cover the dish(I served the chicken atop rice with steamed brocoli on the side)

This was great! We love the flavor. I used orange juice instead of concentrate and doubled it like someone else said. Loved that orange flavor. We marinated it overnight with the lemon and it seemed fine. We had it with brown rice and salad. Nice, healthy, quick meal!

I loved the recipe! I used red pepper flakes and maybe a little too much because it was HOT! But my husband said it wasn't that hot -- I just couldn't handle it. :-) 
I chopped up chicken and marinated for 3 hours. I then served it with rice and fresh veggies.

I used this recipe on chicken drumsticks. I followed the recipe as written using 4 teaspoons of chili sauce, I could have used more as it wasn't that hot.  But the chicken was wonderful after marinading overnight.

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could! I made this last night and my husband (who is not Korean) said it was the best dinner I ever made! This is one fantastic marinade! I am Korean and this is very authentic and I saved some of the marinade to make a sauce at the end- just added cornstarch & water and boiled it out. I recommend the chili paste because that will make it ulitimately a real Korean dish! Thanks, Il-Byung! Please share some more recipes!

I agree with the subtle taste. I marinated the chicken for about 7 hours and it hardly had the flavor I was expecting. It was good, but just ordinary.

Very good. I added 1 Tbsp. hot chili paste and it was spicy, but not overpowering. Like others have suggested, make additional sauce to serve with the rice.

This is a really good recipe!!  My whole family loved it - husband, kids and parents! I didnt have chile paste so I used crushed red peppers. We also BBQ'ed the chicken and I made an extra batch of the marinade to use as a dip and to pour on the rice. YUM!
  Thanks for a great recipe!

This works best if you take out the sugar and the water.  The rest of the ingredients then get a chance to "work their magic."  If you don't want the strong flavor that taking out the water will give you, at least take out the sugar; it's completely unnecessary.

Delicious!  If you love Asian flavors, you must try this one.  I used it to marinate chicken thighs which I baked in the oven at 350 for an hour, basting frequently.  I served it with water chestnuts and sushi rice - everyone loved it!  I didn't have chili paste so I used powder and it still turned out great!  I agree with other reviewers who note that the lemon juice and chili should NOT be considered optional - they are key to the great flavor!

I didn't have any onion powder, so I used a finley minced small onion instead, along with some fresh garlic. Also, I used Splenda instead of sugar to cut down on carbs. As others did, I marinated but reserved a cup, added cornstarch to that cup and used it as a sauce.

This recipe is amazing! A new favourite. Absoultely delicious. Thank you very much!

This was so delicious and easy.  I used it on chicken thighs, and my bf ate six before I cut him off.  I also liked that I had everything on hand.  This is going to be a regular thing for me.

I made this recipe for the first time for a luncheon I had for to celebrate the finalization of my Korean son's adoption. It was a huge hit. Everyone commented how good this was and everyone asked for a copy of the recipe. I used chicken drumettes.  I am having another party this weekend, and you can bet these will be on the menu.

This recipe is excellent, I have been trying to duplicate this for years, tastes just like my favorite teriyaki restaurants recipe! I made it with precooked frozen chicken slices that I already had, and marinated as specified and then cooked in a hot frying pan and the sauce made the BEST glaze, My whole family loved this, I'm going to throw a rice bowl party next weekend and serve this.

I absolutely loved this recipe it was really good! I took advice from a comment saying they used 1 tsp minced garlic and 1 tsp of red pepper flakes in place of the chile paste and I don't regret it, it tasted great. I let it marinade for about 4 hours and since it's currently winter and I'm a college student, I couldn't make this on the grill, so I put them in a pan with the marinade and let it cook in it for about 30-40 minutes at around 400 degrees. I also recommend serving it over rice with the marinade for more flavor!

I mostly followed the recipe. I will say that the chili/bean paste listed as optional seems silly. How could be Korean BBQ without the most important ingredient?!?!

I took some advice from other reviews and added some sesame oil, sesame seeds and garlic. I also used brown sugar instead of white. I made a bit more of the marinade than recommended and set it aside. I then heated that on the side, which made a good sauce for the rice and veggies on the side. Didn't heat the marinade together when I made it the night before, just tossed the chicken in it. Thanks for the tasty recipe!

Korean BBQ Chicken Marinade Haiku: "Really needs garlic! Didn't have hot chili paste, used Sriracha sauce." My chicken turned out AWESOME. Marinated my chicken breasts for about 6 hrs., grilled, sprinkled w/ sesame seeds, and ate in lettuce leaves. Nomnomrific! Just think it may need some garlic, or sesame oil too.

First off, I didn't read the directions (to cook the marinade).  I was in a rush to get out the door to a cottage and just tossed everything into a ziplock bag and mooshed, mooshed, mooshed.  I marinaded six chicken breasts all day and it was the perfect amount of marinade.  (Three breasts were thawed and three were frozen because as I said, we were gong to a cottage and they would be marinading all day in a cooler.)  WOW.  What I loved most about this marinade is that although the bbq was 'hot', the sugar from the marinade coating the chicken didn't burn.  Most importantly, the chicken was so moist and succulent!!!!  And so tasty!!  I didn't have the chile paste so I used two generous tsp of red pepper flakes, instead.  It was warm "enough" for a crowd.  But next time if just cooking for us, I'll try three because I/we Iike spicy.   I didn't have onion powder so I used 2 tsp of dried onion flakes, instead.   As suggested I added [three -my preference] crushed garlic cloves, 1 tsp of sesame oil and 2 tsp of sesame seeds, because it just seemed right.  I am chucking half of my chicken marinade recipes for the simple fact that they pale in comparison to this one and they would just be taking up space in my recipe binder.  Though, next time I will simmer and cool the marinade beforehand as I am curious if/how much differently it would taste/turn out.  Thank you SASEIGEL!

Fantastic! I made it exactly as written, using all of the optional ingredients. After marinading for a few hours, I browned the chicken in a pan with the marinade. I cooked it down to a thick sauce consistency and served it over rice. YUM!

Fantastic. Got rave reviews from my entire family--husband, parents, and two picky preschoolers. Keeps well in the refrigerator for months. We marinated it overnight and the flavor was perfect--grilled or pan-cooked.

Delicious, basic marinade.  I replaced the ginger with turmeric, the chili paste with red pepper flakes, and the onion powder with minced garlic.  Poured over chicken and baked like another reviewer suggested, thickened the remaining sauce over medium high heat with corn starch, and added steamed veggies at the end. Served over steamed rice. Great, easy meal.

This was really great!  I used half the sugar.  And instead of 1 cup of soy sauce i used 1/2 cup soy & 1/2 cup sugar.   No Chili Paste so just threw in a couple sprinkles of Red Pepper Flakes.   Let sit in fridge for hours and broiled for 13 minutes. Very good.  This would be good a a sauce for Chicken and Broccoli as well!   Yummy

I simmered my partially cooked chicken in the sauce on a very low temp and drained the excess sauce and stored it and used it a few days later for a beef stir fry... I love this recipe its tasty and easy and I would say it is just as good as bbq sauce ive gotten in korean spots

wow.  I used 3/4 cup of brown sugar instead of the white.  4 cloves of garlic, fresh ginger, 3 teaspoons of chili paste.  Yummmmmmmm! I used this on chicken tenders that marinated overnight then grilled.  Served with mac n cheese, which was good, but my family would have preferred rice.  Very tasty, a little sweet and nice kick.  I think I will use the 4 teaspoons next time, I have never cooked with the chili paste so wasn't sure how hot it was.  Overall, great flavor!!

This was delicious! I did change up the recipe a little bit because my family loves Garlic. So I added tsp of Garlic powder and 2 tsp of fresh garlic.  I also reserved 1/3 of the marinade to make a sauce to make on top of the chicken. I grilled these on my George Forman grill then sauced them and serve. They went quickly!!

excellent!  It would be an easy marinade to keep in the refrigerator as a stir-fry sauce.  Yum.

OK flavor, but we were expecting more ooomph since the marinade had a fair amount of chile paste in it.  Marinade and raw chicken froze and defrosted well.

My husband talked on and on about Korean BBQ sauce.  He was in the Air Force and was stationed in Korea for a year and said it was the best BBQ he has had and he is a huge BBQ fan!  So, when I found this I had to give it a try for a cookout we had!  He Loved it!  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent recipe but with the suggestions from other reviewers which includes adding minced garlic to the marinade and thickening up the marinade to use as sauce with corn starch.  I also did not have chili paste so I used a good heaping tspful of chili pepper flakes.  To cook the chicken, I pan-fried the chicken to get a good brown color on the outside and then stuck it in the oven with some of the sauce at 350 for 20 minutes and it turned out great.  Bon appetite!

Very good marinade.  Needs to marinate for quite a while to be able to really taste the marinade.  My kids and hubby were happy with it!

Was a great recipe!  I reduced the amount of sugar to 2/3; soy sauce to 1/2 (because that's all i had left) and added 1tsp of salt; I didn't have onion powder so i made slivered onions so when i take it out to bbq they will fall off back into the sauce.  I took the advice from one of the reviews and added 1tbsp of sesame oil.  I used chicken wings and marinade over night, which was unnecessary because it was hard to tell if it was cooked when the colour was so dark.

This made plain, frozen chicken breasts tender, juicy, and flavorful.  It lent just enough flavor without overpowering the chicken.  I thawed the chicken breasts in a ziploc bag with the marinade for about 8 hours in a bowl of cold water in the refrigerator.  I added about 1 tablespoon olive oil and I used fresh ginger as opposed to ground.  I've never had so many people comment on how delicious chicken tasted!

Perfect! Simple and tasty.  Followed recipe as written, then added sesame oil and sprinkled finished chicken (cooked in slow cooker for 7 hours on low, then served over jasmine rice) with sesame seeds and chopped green onions.  Yum!

A big hit at the Fire Hall!!! Prepared the marinade as listed including the suggested optional ingredients.  As per the recommendations of other reviewers I also added three cloves of garlic (cooked in with ginger etc.).  I used chicken breasts cut into cubes and then marinaded them for about six hours.  The cubes were poked onto skewers and BBQed.  Served the skewers laid onto a bed of rice with a fresh garden salad, and let the complements roll.  Even one of the station's top cooks asked me for this marinade recipe...a BIG complement!!  Easy, healthy ans super tasty...definitely a keeper!!!

My husbands favorite.  I cut the recipe in half put over chicken just enough to cover and marinade for 4-6 hours leave the rest of sauce on low heat and use for a serving sauce.  We love to cut up chicken breast  stir fry and put over rice topping with sauce.

This was great! Really easy. I halved the ingredients because I didn't need so much, and used garlic powder instead of onion powder. I marinated chicken wings, drumsticks, and cubes for a BBQ. Everybody loved it! We even used the leftover marinade for some beef that wasn't seasoned yet. Going to use this again and again :o)

A very moist & flavorful recipe.  I made it with the changes bellydancer suggested - omit the water & add garlic (I used 5 cloves crushed).  I didn't have any chili paste so I subbed crushed red pepper.  Keep a close eye on it when grilling - the amount of sugar in it contributes to it easily charring.

This is a great chicken marinade.  I added several cloves of garlic and let my chicken marinate for 24 hours, then served it with broccoli, brown jasmine rice, and kimchi.  Even though I used low-sodium soy sauce, it was still rather salty.  Next time I might use less paste and more red pepper flakes (although it's a totally different flavor) or perhaps use less soy sauce.

This was good, but I thought it seemed like a weaker version of the Baked Teriyaki Chicken from this site. I baked boneless thighs, I am thinking it would probably be better on the grill. Overall, good recipe.

I tried it on the grill and also on the stove as a stirfry sauce. On the grill was the best because the sugar and the spice of the paste really comes out. When I stirfried it created a nice sauce for the rice noodles.

Because I'm hosting a dinner party soon, I tried three different marinade recipes in one evening. Hubby and I disagreed on the other two, but both of us said this one was CLEARLY the winner! Superior flavor, color, and appearance on grilled chicken. An added bonus: it was easy and inexpensive to prepare. Not only did it make the cut for my dinner party, but it very likely will become a regular in our house. Yum!!

I didn't marinate in this because I had already put a garlic, white pepper, tumeric, and chinese 5 spice powder rub on my chicken thighs. I however did baste my chicken while it was grilling. Man alive this stuff is good. Makes a good amount especially if your basting. I'm happy to have  more in the fridge. One of my new favorites!!

I knew this was getting 5 stars when my boyfriends' eyes widened and he tore off another hunk of chicken before he swallowed the first, it was THAT good. I cut breasts into strips, marinated, and grilled on skewers. I used just a touch less sugar than the 1 cup called for (maybe 7/8?) but it wasn't too sweet at all, I think the full cup would be just perfect. I was out of corn starch so I just simmered over medium on the stove  - make sure you remember there is all that sugar unlike other marinades you're used to and take it off BEFORE you get to the salt-water-taffy consistency I achieved, it will turn quickly and you'll miss dipping the chicken into it. I will barbecue with it again and look forward to using it in stir fry, thanks very much for sharing.

I really liked this recipe...  at first I thought it tasted a lot like teriyaki, but the more I ate, it seemed very reminiscent of Bourbon Chicken (which I love!)   I made two exceptions to the recipe, the first was marinating my chicken for 24 hours instead of 4 hours, and the second was using mild sweet chili sauce instead of hot chili paste.   When I got ready to bake the chicken, I made more marinade and basted the chicken several times during cooking.   I was very pleased with the outcome.   However, today I made chicken salad with the leftover chicken adding pecans, celery, crushed pineapple, green onions, with a sweet-ish dressing of pineapple juice, sugar, and mayo, and it was absolutley wonderful!!   Yum Yum Yum!!!   I think the leftover chicken had a better, more enhanced flavor than the fresh cooked.   I will make this marinade again, but next time, I think I'll add a little vanilla extract to really make it taste more like my favorite Bourbon Chicken.

I make something very similar to this but I use sesame seed, sesame oil, chopped green onions, with equal parts of sugar, soy sauce and water. Mix till sugar is disolved and marinate your meat for several hours.

I would give this more stars if I could!  I omitted the water and chile paste, as I don't ever have it.  I cubed my chicken to marinate(4 hours), and added fresh garlic to it.  I reserved some of the marinade to use as a sauce for my 'rice bowl' I wanted to make.  To the sauce I added some garlic powder and honey.  I needed it a little thicker so I used a T. of cornstarch.  I cooked the chicken cubes, marinade and all, in the fry pan with a little canola oil.  The marinade caramelized nicely on the chicken, it makes it extra tasty!  I steamed broccoli and already shredded carrots to add to my rice bowl.  I also sprinkled a bit of sesame seeds onto each serving.  I will surely make this again.

Very good! I used splenda instead of suger and added 1 teaspoon of crushed garlic. I cut up chicken thighs into nugget sized bites and marinated it for 24 hrs. Then cooked it in a non-stick skillet. My husband even liked it.

This was a quick and delicious marinade. I didn't have onion powder, and omitted the ginger (don't like it). I used 1 clove of fresh pressed garlic. I also substituted a key lime for the lemon juice it called for as well as Sriracha sauce for the chili paste.  It turned out fabulously! I sauteed it with diced chicken breast and yakisoba noodles. I also added a splash to my veggie stir fry that included, onion, celery, carrots, water chestnuts, mushrooms, and bean sprouts.   My husband and three boys loved it! Everyone cleaned their plate. This will definitely become a "go to" marinade for me!

Oh wow! My first marinade from this site and it definitely is good! I've been wanting to make my own rice/noodle bowls for some time. Used Sriracha hot sauce and lime juice instead of lemon. Next time may add a bit of cornstarch or flour to thicken the sauce a bit. Served over this site's Ginger Broccoli Stir-Fry and udon noodles. This recipe will be a regular dish here.

Delicious!!! I basically followed the recipe as is, but with a few slight changes. I used both of the optional ingredients (the lemon juice and Sriracha for the chile paste), which I personally think are a MUST. Also, I added one teaspoon of garlic powder and thickened the whole thing with about half a tablespoon of cornstarch. I made this for 2lbs of chicken breasts and it was just the right amount. I marinaded for about three hours because I decided to make this last minute for guests, but to speed up the process, I sucked out as much air as I could from the plastic bag I stuck this in. We threw it on the grill and it came out wonderful! I topped it off with some sesame seeds. I will 100% be making this again!

Nice, albeit watery. Doubled recipe for 6 large boned chicken breasts, poured marinade over chicken and placed in 350 degree oven till meat was 180 degrees.

I can see adding minced onion and a tad cornstarch--and making this a yummy BBQ glaze for chicken and/or steak....maybe thowing in some large pineapple slices for a Polynesian flair!!

Worth making: do try this one!!

This is the best chicken marinade ever!  It's tasty and easy to make.  The only change I made was adding fresh garlic.  I also simmered the leftover marinade while the chicken was grilling and served it as extra sauce on the side.  1/4 of the recipe is good for about 1.5 lbs of thin sliced chicken breast.  I put half of my batch in a bag and threw it in the freezer for an even quicker meal next time around.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing!!

My wife LOVES this chicken marinade, she asks for it once a week. When I first tried it before I put the chicken in I thought it tasted a bit salty..but when you cook it, it comes out with a great taste. Not salty not sweet, PERFECT!

Definite keeper! As a spicy teriyaki style sauce. We had to make some substitutions w/ brown sugar & red pepper flakes & minced fresh ginger instead b/c we didn't have white sugar or chili paste or ground ginger on hand. We scooped 2 cups of the sauce (before adding the chicken) to make a thickened sauce with cornstarch after grilling the chicken outside. Marinating the chicken is critical in flavoring the meat right.

Very good marinade for chicken.  I baked the chicken in the marinade and served it over rice with the remaining sauce.  I used 1 Tbsp fresh minced ginger and 1 Tbsp fresh minced onion instead of powder.  The flavors were wonderful together. Thank you.

This is the best Korean BBQ chicken marinade.  I follow the recipes exactly and use 3 teaspoons of sriraacha chili sauce.  It hasn't come out spicy.  I actually keep some on hand in a soy sauce bottle in my fridge.  I use this on chicken wings and thighs and marinate overnight.

This had a wonderful flavor but, I'm confused...is the serving suggestion really for 48 people like it says or is it for 4-8 people? This could make a huge differece on how strong the flavor is. I also didn't have any chili paste so I used Sriracha which is a chili sauce. I think comparable in flavor. And I found this in Wal-Mart in the Asian food section. So if you need a substitute....I think this one would be easy to find.

This was really excellent.  It's a keeper at our house.  My honey cooked
the chicken breast chunks that I'd frozen right in the marinade in a big
pan with all the marinade and then added
dried cherries and zucchini chunks and big onion slices.. sounds a bit odd but was WOW-Great over good white rice.

Like the previous reviewer, I cut my chicken into bite-sized chunks before marinating. I omitted the lemon juice (it was optional) & instead of adding water, added chicken stock.  I marinated the chicken over-night.  I quickly browned the chicken on both sides, 
turned the heat to a low simmer & added fresh broccoli & mushrooms.  As suggested, I saved approx. ½ c of the marinade to mix into basmati rice.  Everything was on the table in less than 30 minutes. I think this marinade would also work well on fish.  Very tasty!

Ever since I first made this, my husband has been addicted to it. I cut my chicken into bite-sized chunks before marinating & then cook them on the stovetop & let them simmer in the marinade while I prepare brown rice. As suggested, I save a cup of the marinade to mix into the rice. Finally, I throw it all together in bowls. Awesome, easy recipe. Thanks!

Since I did not have the Korean chili paste, I had to make do with an Indonesian one so perhaps the flavor did not come through the way it was supposed to. Still, dish was rather tasty, and simple enough to make regularly. Thank you for posting.

This was so authentic tasting as we often go out for rice bowls. I did what some other reviewers suggested and saved half to thicken up with 2T of cornstarch to use as a drizzle over the chicken and rice. I used vietnamese  chili garlic sauce bc I didn't have the paste and also added couple of cloves of crushed garlic bc we love garlic and it worked fine.

This marinade is great!  I used in on boneless skinless chicken thighs on our barbecue.  I have been trying to find a similar recipe to the "meat sticks" he had at a Filipino Birthday party.  thumbs up!

The trick is to marinate it overnight.

Only had time to marinade the pounded chicken breasts for 30 minutes, then I broiled it, the family loved it. Next time I will make more marinade for dipping.

Wonderful, I thickened the marinade with corn starch and basted the tenderized boneless breasts while they cooked slowly over coals.  Absolutely delicious!

I used this to marinade tofu for a vegtarian friendly recipe.  My family loved it. I also couldn't find the chile paste and used other reviewers' suggestions of crushed red pepper and garlic.

This was excellent and very easy.  I made  the sauce in the morning before work and marinated chicken thighs for about 7 hours.  It was wonderful.  I cooked the thighs, some with skin, some without, for about 50 minutes at 350.  I served some herb roasted red potatoes with it and just before I took them out I poured some of the marinade on them and broiled them for a few minutes.  Delicious dinner.  Thanks

I just made the sauce and it tasted SOOO awesome.  What I will do is marinate the chicken accordingly.  To cook:  heat up about 1-2 TBS of oil and cloves of garlic in a medium to high heat wok and stir fry the chicken until brown, then add the sauce and simmer with the chicken until done, add cornstarch and water to thicken the sauce at the end (I don't have a grill).  The trick to the recipe is to find good quality and tast chili sauce and decent soy sauce, which you should be able to find in any oriental market.  Definitely a keeper!

I'm living in Korea right now, and this recipe tastes pretty authentic (though I've never found it sold here... the pepper paste gives it that Korean taste).  I especially like to cook it up with a bit of the marinade in the pan.  That way it's really moist and yummy.

Very, very tasty marinade!  I followed the suggestion to reserve some marinade and add cornstarch to make a sauce then poured it over my bowl of brown rice, steamed veggies and marinated chicken.  Healthy and delicious meal!

This was really good. I used 3 tablespoons of thai garlic chili sauce and I didn't find it overly spicy. I also marinated it for about 3 days and used regular soy sauce. I didn't think it was too salty at all. I'll be making this again.

AWESOME!!!  I made a couple alterations, used reduced sodium soy sauce, added 2 Tbs water and 2 Tbs sugar, used 7 tsp. Hot Chili Sauce (could not find a paste form).  My husband loved it as I surprisingly did too.  Another benefit...it was so easy!

My husband I enjoyed this a lot, but it did not really remind me of the rice bowls we get at the mall.  I made my own chili paste out of "pizza" chilis, sesame oil, vingegar, and salt.  I was conservative with the chilis, but boy was it spicy.  Not for the kids.  It's a keeper, though.

I made this for my family... the boys are fussy eaters and they gobbled this down. I marinated the chicken all day in it and then pre-cooked the chicken in the oven for 30 minutes in the marinade and then we grilled the chicken on the barbecue... oh my word... heavenly AND there were no leftovers. I've also pre made some marinade and freezed it for our camping trips and it had been fantastic.

This was delicious! I did make a few tweaks, because I didn’t have some of the stuff on hand, I used a half a cup of white sugar, because that’s all I had, and the other half I substituted brown sugar. I used lemon pepper instead of lemon juice, and I didn’t have any chili paste on hand either, so I used a siracha sauce I had in my fridge. I’m definitely going to make sure I have the right ingredients for it next time, but the substitutes I used still worked really good with it! I love this recipe!

I was confused by the 48 servings and had no idea how much marinade to make for 2 lbs of chicken breast. I couldn’t find where anyone else commented so I adjusted the recipe for 10 servings. But, as I was whisking it on the stove, it didn’t look like much so ended up doubling that & made 20 servings worth and that seemed about right. We like spicy, so I used 2 heaping tablespoons of chili paste. As suggested, I also added a drizzle of sesame oil. Perfection. Marinated for 5 hours, then grilled the chicken and chopped it up to have on a salad with a Korean ginger vinaigrette dressing. Will definitely make again.

This turned out really nicely.  I grilled my chicken on the stovetop but I can't wait to try it outside!  I cut the sugar in half and used a tablespoon of molasses.  I also added a couple drops of hickory smoke since I knew this was indoor grilling.  I'm not sure how this would turn out with chicken breasts since it is such a rich dark marinade but with chicken thighs it was amazing!  I will try it with beef or goat next time.

Wow! This was so easy to make, and I can't wait to eat it tonight! I made some substitutions using what I had on hand including honey for the sugar, yuzucha (lemon-orange fruit jam) instead of lemon, and fresh onion and ginger. For hot sauce, I used Tabasco.

Awesome recipe! Just as good as any great place that sells bbq chicken bowls! I will keep a premade jar of this in my fridge whenever I want to make a quick chicken bowl. Yum!

I added mustard to the sauce. It was excellent but next time I will use it as a marinade rather than a basting sauce.

This was delicious!  I only marinaded for about 2 hours and it was still very tasty! We had it with Japanese traditional ramen, rice, and oriental salad.  Our German company loved it! :)

My family loved this! I made it without the chili paste because my daughters can't tolerate spicy food, but it was still delicious without the chili. I'll be making this regularly.

Dang this was GOOD! My young kids are picky eaters and they LOVED it. No left overs at all. I made it with white rice and broccoli. I did what another reviewer did: cook the chicken tenders in the oven at 350 degrees for about 35 minutes. I had let the chicken sit in the sauce for an hour, took the chicken out and stuck it in a pyrex dish to cook in the oven. The rest of the sauce I cooked with some corn starch to thicken it and drizzled it over the rice, chicken and broccoli. It was just the right amount of sweet and spice. (I used Sriracha hot sauce).

I added 3 cloves of crushed garlic and used red pepper flakes as a sub - took out a bit for sauce and added cornstarch to thicken it... Cut up some cutlets into smaller pieces, and baked it covered in the marinade for 45 minutes. And man - it's a winner.

Wife jarred the extra sauce almost immediately after tasting it, kids loved it too. Have those who don't like the heat avoid the sauce. 

Paired over white rice and steamed vegetables.

Excellent treatment of chicken thighs. We're older so unfortunately, spiciness is not an option for us any longer. Even leaving the chili paste out, it's delicious! I read and re-read the few less than favorable reviews trying to figure out why they didn't care for this and the only conclusion I can draw is that their expectations were way off the mark. This tastes exactly like it should. Thanks so much for sharing this simple and delicious recipe.

Tried this without reading reviews, but turned out I did what a lot of people did - substituted Splenda for some sugar, added garlic powder and Sesame oil. I marinated 3.5 lbs of chicken tenderloins for 4 hrs as directed. It was just enough sauce for this amount of chicken, and it penetrated just right. But if I use thick chicken breasts or thighs in the future, I might try overnight marinating instead. I put the chicken on the grill, and we boiled leftover marinade and put it over sticky rice and chicken. Delicious! I also like the idea of trying it with wings in the oven. And wish I had thought to add sliced green onions as well. Will make again!

Definitely a keeper. Very simple, but added a ton of great flavor to my chicken. I served it with rice and used a little bit in the rice and all together it was terrific. No changes to this one

I did the baking version, and I'm not big into spicy which dawned on me after adding a tsp red pepper flakes and a tsp of spice sauce (I'm a moron).  Added some vinegar to balance out the spice, and it's still AMAZING.  Make sure you reserve some to thicken!

Very good marinade for chicken. I didn't have enough soy sauce so I also used some teriyaki and spicy ginger marinade and grilled the the chicken breasts after they'd sat in the marinade for an hour or so. I also added chopped garlic and reserved some of the sauce to thicken with corn starch. I will definitely make again!

This was a big hit. I made exactly as specified.  I doubled the recipe and then after marinating I used the juices to make a gravy/ sauce by adding 2 tbsp of cornstarch mixed with 2 tbsp of water and bring to a boil until thickened.

This was very good - it made enough marinade for about 6 chicken breasts. I did add fresh garlic (minced) to the marinade for some extra flavor.

Our new favorite chicken marinade.  Left out the hot chili paste and did not substitute it with anything else because my family does not like anything spicy.  Cooked it on the grill after marinading for several hours.

Very good. I marinated it for more than four hours and the taste went through and was very good "burnt" on by the grill.  I used low sodium soy sauce. I didn't have chili paste so I used a little chili powder and some other ingredients that come in chili paste (looked it up).  Very good marinade and easy to make.

This recipe is a definite keeper!  I took other's advice and added garlic (VIP!), red pepper flakes (instead of chili paste), minced onion and a little toasted sesame oil.  I grilled the chicken and used the leftover marinade to make a sauce by boiling it and adding a little cornstarch/water mix.  The only mistake I made was cutting the recipe in half ("48 servings" scared me!).  Next time:  full recipe!  Served the chicken with some asian slaw on the side ... YUM!  Recipe was a hit with both my husband and my 11 year old daughter!

I've made this several times and its a huge hit with the family.  I only add a teaspoon or two of chili because I like mine to be more on the mild side.  The kids usually add some chili sauce to theirs to make it spicy.  I usually stir fry this and serve it with rice and veggies for a complete meal.

This does indeed taste like the sauce they use at your local Asian "bowl" restaurants and that's what I've been looking for! We loved it! I used it for stir-fry. I marinaded and coated my chicken chunks with cornstarch to make it crispy and then stir-fried the chicken and every veggie I had in my fridge in the sauce. It was delicious. Served it over sticky white rice and made your Asian Coleslaw as a side.

Big thumbs up from the family.  Per other reviews I also added garlic, and some Thai sweet chili sauce instead of hot.  Repeat!!
Now repeated 2 more times including for family in England and still a big hit!!

This marinade recipe is excellent! I did add a little garlic powder at the suggestion of other reviewers, and everyone who tried some couldn't get enough... we freezed the few chicken breasts that were leftover and plan on bringing it to tailgate at a Brewers game Saturday. Can't wait to eat it again! Thanks so much for posting!

Fab marinade! I did not use the lemon juice, as I did not have any. I substituted dried chili flakes in place of the chili paste. I did about 2 heaping teaspoons of that. I used this first as a marinade for my chicken drumsticks on the BBQ and then I poured it into a zipper bag with a couple of pieces of pork for future stir fry. Boy was that ever zippy stir fry sauce!

So good! First time I ever tried any type of Asian influenced recipe and it was BETTER than a restaurant.  Definitely make a whole batch of it, you will want to use it.  We thickened some of it and served it over rice.  YUM!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very tasty.  Next time, I'll do 3/4 cup each of soy sauce and sugar and add chicken broth instead of water.  Some cubed potatoes would be great with this, too.

This was entirely too sweet for my family.  My husband tells me Asian BBQ is typically sweet, so maybe my expectation was unrealistic.  I won't try this again.

I used this recipe over the weekend for chicken kebabs I was going to be grilling on the bbq.  It came out great and everyone loved it.  I added a few cloves of minced garlic.  I didn't have red chili paste, but I did have red curry paste so I used that instead and added some red pepper flakes.  Marinated the cubed chicken breast for a few hours and then brushed extra marinade as the kebabs grilled and everyone loved it.  thanks for a great recipe!

This is so yummy!  I marinaded bite sized pieces of chicken, removed the chicken from marindate to cook it, added the marinade back into the pot and thickened with cornstarch,added broccoli and served over rice.  I also substitued 2 tsp of red pepper flakes for the paste as someone else suggested.

I tried this with some chicken breasts and it was incredible!  I can only say that I wish I had chosen smaller cuts of meat to allow the marinade to penetrate better...maybe strips of chicken or something similar.  Also next time I will reduce the remaining marinade to a sticky sauce bc the stuff that carmelized on the sides of the baking dish was THE best sauce ever!

This was very good!  Would definately make this again.  I used a little less than a cup of soy sauce (just didn't fill the cup).  I added some worchesteshire sauce and garlic powder (probably close to a TBS - didn't measure).  I also added extra onion powder and ginger (probably about a TBS of each too).  I couldn't find chile paste.  I used red pepper flakes and some crushed cayenne pepper (about a tsp at first).  After marinading, I cooked on my stovetop grill and boiled half the sauce to use later (10 min to kill anything from touching raw chicken).  I added some extra red pepper flakes to the sauce (we used it, the kids don't like spicy).  Served with rice, broccoli and fries.

I thought this was pretty tasty. My Korean friends didn't think it was authentic, but liked the flavors. Easy to make, and we grilled it using chicken. Will make again. Good for kebobs.

I liked a lot of things about this sauce, but I will be altering it next time - thus the 3 stars. I doubled it and instead of using it as a marinade, I baked chicken drumsticks in it - basting every 10 minutes or so. I reserved some sauce and thickened it with cornstarch on the stove to use as extra (served with white rice & steamed broccoli). It turned out yummy and with a great texture, but mine was too soy-sauce-y so next time I'm going to cut that back a tiny bit and add more ginger. It felt like it needed a little teriyaki base to it as well, so I might try adding bottled teriyaki. I loved how simple it was though, thanks for the recipe! I can't wait to tweak it:).

I made this for a BBQ we recently went to. I did not have the chili paste so I used ground cayenne pepper instead so it didn't get that nice red color on the outside but still tasted good. I also added quite a bit of minced garlic and let it marinade all day. It was a hit with the people who ate some of it!

This marinade/baste recipe is great. I used it to baste chicken breasts that I cedar planked on the BBQ.The result was incredible as cedar plank cooking uses lower heat and the sauce turned into a delicious glaze and gave the chicken fabulous color and flavour thank you very much for this recipe.

Oh man this was good! I added 1 tablespoon of freshed chopped garlic, 1 teaspoon of sesame oil and a few dried chilis and let it marinate overnight. The next day I grilled them on my Foreman (It was raining). This turned out amazing! It charred just slightly on the outsides of some pieces and it was absolutely lovely. I will definitely be rotating this one in every once in a while!

First time I'd made it, I forgot to add the water called for and used it for a dipping sauce (potstickers, chicken) instead and loved the flavor.  The second time, I followed the recipe and added the water and marinated the chicken for 24 hrs, but wasn't as pleased with the diluted taste as much. And you must use the Korean chili paste as instructed for full effect.

This is my go to recipe for chicken.  I usually make this w/ chicken wings or drumsticks and  grilled.  It is sooo good!  Also, you can add garlic and green onions to give it a little something extra.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!!

LOVE this recipe. I have made numerous occasions including many bbqs. They do great on drumsticks especially if you char them slightly on the grill. Get this great smokey korean flavor. Cooking up a batch tonight for my in-laws. I use a vietnamese garlic chile paste which tastes great in this recipe. You can find it at most asian markets. Thanks for this recipe!

Delicious!  I marinated chicken breast then grilled them.  Beware!!  It will burn rather quickly.  However, it was a great marinade and sauce.

Very very good.  I used this on pork and I know I'll make it again with chicken. As for chili paste, I used a hot curry paste I had on hand.  It didn't seem very spicy so I added a little Asian chili sauce to taste.

As is a 3. to make it authentic as other reviewers have said it needs to have garlic, green onion and sesame.  Add those and you get a 4.  I think that the water dilutes the flavors too much and it needs more ginger maybe?  I have to do some tweeking to the actual recipe to get this up 5 stars.  As is, good base to work with for a korean bbq marinade

This was very easy and quick. I'm sure it would have tasted better if I had marinated for 4 hours, but I was hungry. I didn't let the mixture cool. i poured it on the chicken and poked it to death with a fork and let it sit for 15 minutes. Broiled it and it was delicious. The kids loved it.

This was great, but I did make a few tweaks: 1 minced garlic clove, replaced the chili paste with hot chili garlic sauce (it's what I had on hand) added a bit of honey to sweeten it up and also a few drops of sesame oil.  I did increase the hot chili garlic sauce to our heat liking.  Very good!

My husband made the marinade and then grilled it a few hours later, basting it every so often. His cooking skill went up a hundred points with this recipe! We will be making this again for sure!

Very tasty marinade.  I have 2 little ones so I  only added 2 tsps chili paste, and it turned out great.  I used chicken tenders and served with white rice and the Mandarin Almond Salad from BDeger on this website, was a great dinner.

Excellent balance of sweet and hot!  Instead of the chile paste, I used ground red pepper (I have an almost-two-year-old, so I only used 1/4 tsp.).  I tried it in the oven as suggested by a previous reviewer, but I think next time I'll stir-fry the chicken for better caramelization and reduction of the sauce.  I thickened the sauce with some cornstarch dissolved in a bit of water, and added steamed broccoli.  Served it over jasmine rice.

This was YUMMY!  I marinated the chicken for fondue night.  I reserved a little of the sauce, which I thickened with some corn starch for dipping.  It was fabulous.  By far the best meat marinade I used that night.  I cooked up the leftovers the next day in a skillet, and added the extra sauce at the end for a lovely glaze.  They looked pretty, tasted and tasted oh so good!  I didn't add all the recommended chili flakes, because I was worried it would be too spicy.  Other then that I followed the recipe perfectly.  I will be using this again and again and again for sure!

This recipe is definitely a keeper!  I marinated chicken breasts using our FoodSaver vacuum sealer for about 45 minutes and the taste was just fabulous! I also thickened the marinade to make it a sauce, which was wonderful as well.  4 tsp of Sriracha gave the recipe a nice little kick.

I have made this recipe dozens of times and dozen ways. It is so good as is, or with some added garlic. The thing I recommend is to cut the meat into chunks for better flavor. I have tried this with half artifical sweetner (like splenda) and it is great! My highest recommend would to make kabobs on outdoor grill. Nothing beats the flavor and texture with this marinade.

I marinated chicken drumsticks in this for 24 hours, then barbecued. I basted the chicken often with the leftover sauce which was simmering on the barbecue.

It was good, I'll usually add a bit more of something I found at a store here in the east coast, Naranja Agria by Goya. It says in english bitter orange but it's more sour than anything. great zest to it. I wuold trade it though for a bottled one at an asian store that has pears and other goodies in it that one is by far better but this is a good alternative if you dont wanna drive and search.

AMAZING!!  We used Sirracha hot sauce instead of paste called for and it was really, really, really spicy and perfectly flavorful.  We kabobed the marinated chicken and grilled it outside, reserving some of the sauce to thicken as a dipping sauce.  Not one shred of chicken was left after our dinner party and we served a pretty good steak along with it!

This was really, really good!  I took another reviewers suggestion with boiling down the sauce until it was syrupy.  Next time I will just grill the chicken and not marinate in the sauce.  I will steam veggies and make rice and use the marinade as a sauce.  My kids loved it not to spicey and I didn't change a thing. Thanks for sharing.  I will be making this again and again.

This was delicious.  I made it as stated but next time I'll add a little more chili paste just as a personal preference.  I then grilled the chicken breasts.  Leftover chicken was just as good in a sandwich with mayo and grilled red pepper and zucchini.

We enjoyed this chicken. I cut the recipe down to 12 servings for just two chicken breasts.  The only change I made was to cut down the water by a couple of TBS. and add a splash of dry sherry.  It was very good.  A little sweet but good. Next time I may cut sugar a tiny bit. The chili paste really gave it a nice kick.  Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious!  I did make a few minor changes, though.  I used light brown sugar, 1/2 tsp or so of garlic powder instead of onion powder and added a bit of sesame oil and chili oil.  I simmered the chicken in a covered pan with the extra marinade.  I will definitely make again!

A very easy & yummy recipe...can't go wrong with that combo!  My husband loved it; even said that it should become one of our weekly dinners :)  The only modifications I made were to the ginger (I didn't add it because I didn't have any) and the chili paste:  didn't have paste, but had hot sauce and it seemed to work...gave it a nice little kick.  Overall, a great recipe!

Very tastey.  I left out the lemon juice, as I was afraid that it would start to "cook" the chicken during its 24 hour marinade time.  I might should have left it in, as I kept thinking that it was missing something.  My dinner guests raved, though.  Made for moist, flavorful chicken.

My husband and I love garlic, so I made some additions and added fresh garlic, fresh chopped green onions, and some ground pepper. For our own personal taste preference, I also used low sodium soy sauce and brown sugar. I only marinated chicken for 1.5 hrs. Tasted so good; excellent if marinated even longer. I've also tried this marinade with baked chicken. Turned out just as good. Easy and tasty marinade.

This was so good!  I listened to other reviewers and added real ginger and some garlic.  I saved 1/2 and thickened it up in a sauce pan and then poured it on the chicken after it was grilled.

For someone who does not use 'from scratch' marinades, this one turned out to be one I will use over and over in the future. I used it on pork tenderlion tonight. I used Tabasco sauce to taste (instead of chili paste) and lime (instead of lemon). The family raved about it. I also reduced another batch of the sauce and everyone put it on the rice as well as the pork. Thanks for a great marinade!

This is a new staple.  I've made this several times.  I add green onions and a bit of toasted sesame oil and let it marinade overnight.  I have made it both with ground and fresh ginger.  I enjoy the the version with fresh giner a little more but whatever is on hand will work.  Goes great with Fried Rice with Cilantro from this site.

Very good! I marinated the chicken breast (cut into strips) for about 5 hours and then fried them up in some olive oil. I boiled the rest of the marinade and then served over the chicken and white rice. I will definately be using this recipe again!

Made as recipe states, but used low-sodium soy sauce, as I always do in any recipe.  Wasn't sure what hot chili paste was, so I used a hot chili sauce that has some punch to it.  This was a pretty good marinade.  DH liked it more than I did, so I'm giving it a 4-star.  Thanks, So Il-Byung!

Everyone in my family LOVED this recipe.  My teenage boys said it tasted just like bourbon chicken you get at the mall.  I followed the recipe exactly but I used Korean Fermented red paper paste (Taeyangcho Gochujang)for the hot chili paste. We are making it again this week!!

Made the recipe exactly as is.  It was very tasty.  Cut up the chicken and put it over white rice.  I had saved half of the marinade to make a sauce.  I added a little flour to the marinade and heated it up on the stove until it thickened and poured it over the chicken and rice.  Although I had marinated the chicken for 6 hours prior to cooking it, it still didn't have as much flavor as I would have liked but the sauce over it made up for the lack of flavor.

Ok, but as said by many it is very salty. I thought that the soy sauce taste was too stong, but I am starting to believe this may have to do with the brand you use.

This is an awesome marinade!  We have used it on chicken and fish, then boiled it and used it as a sauce.  We used Splenda instead of sugar and lots of chili paste because we like spicy.  Thanks for this recipe.  It is definitely a keeper!

Oooh...this was sooooooooooo salty.  My husband and I love Korean and Asian inspired dishes.  This was terrible. It just tasted like salty marinated chicken. Dinner was ruined with this recipe. If you are looking for a good Asian bbq dish try the Asian Beef Skewers.

The flavour was nice but very subtle (even though I marinated the chicken for 10 hours). If I made it again I would reduce or eliminate the water.

My husband liked this, I didn't. Be sure to use the chile paste, as there's not much else for flavour. Maybe if the seasonings were increased, but, as is, it was like sweet soya sauce.

The perfect marinade.  I've tried a few different marinades lately from the internet and usually they are too lemony or some other overpowering ingredient but this is the perfect blend of seasonings.  I marinated my chicken for 24 hours and it was so tasty. It's my new favorite.

Really good marinade, especially if you like spicy foods.  We couldn't find "hot chile paste" but used red chili sauce so maybe that is why ours was extra hot. Due to the heat we decided to do a second non-spicy marinade for the kids. We also took others advice and reserved a small amount of marinade.  We thickened the reserved sauce with cornstarch and drizzled it over our chicken rice and broccoli bowls. Really good!

This was so easy and tasted wonderful!  My husband's favorite food is Korean and he also gave it a rave review...I know I will prepare this many more times in the future!  I am also curious if So Il-Byung has any other Korean recipes?  We'd enjoy trying more of her suggestions for cooking!!

I made this with partially frozen chicken and let it sit in the marinade for only 2 hours, then I baked it.  My boyfriend raved and said it was the best chicken he'd ever had!  It's great if you plan ahead and also for a last minute dish.

LOVED it.  I used half the recipe for 2 large chicken breasts and had a little sauce left over, after spooning as much as I wanted over the steamed rice I made with it.  I only marinated for about 45 minutes and it was fine, especially since I had sauce alongside (which I thickened with cornstarch).

I think the lemon juice and chili sauce really saves this recipe.  I wouldn't consider them optional.  Maybe you can put less than the recipe indicates but to leave them out altogether would be sacrificing taste.

This turned out really well with chicken breasts which we later grilled after about 45 minutes of soaking in the marinade.  My husband liked it quite a bit which was surprising since he tends not to like big hunks of meat and chicken breasts are his favorite - he prefers dark.  But he asked that we make this again and marinate it even longer and reserve some marinade to pour on it afterwards.

BTW, I did add some garlic powder to this, just thought it was necessary for a Korean taste.

Chicken turned out great! It was a little salty so next time I will use the reduced sodium soy sauce. Great recipe.

I must have done something wrong.  I am going to give it a try again and see.  I will follow the suggestions that some have made to cut the soy - it was just too salty.  I will also make some rice with steamed veggies for my next attempt.

This was fantastic!  I used this recipe to marinate bone-in chicken breasts for about 2 1/2 hours.  Then I prepared them using the Easy Shake and Bake Chicken recipe from this website, changing the spices a bit to blend well with the flavors of the marinade.  Better than any take-out chicken by far.

Pretty good.  Tastes very much like teriyake (sp?).  I marinated for only an hour, and it was plenty.
