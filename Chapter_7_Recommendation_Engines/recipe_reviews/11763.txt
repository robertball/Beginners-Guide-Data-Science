I made quite a few changes and this was delicious! Used Ricotta instead of cottage cheese, Added 1/2 cup of shredded mozzarella to each layer, substituted equal amount of bread dipping spices for basil. Substituted 1 can of cream of shrimp soup for 1 of the cans of cream of mushroom. ***Also a big tip is to make sure your seafood is dry, especially scallops. I rinse all my seafood and put it in a plastic strainer over a larger bowl, covered in fridge for a few hours. Wet scallops will water down a dish like this! Make sure scallops are dry-packed. I also added a lot more parmesan cheese. Will make again!

This may have been the best dish I've ever prepared.  Following the advice of others, I cut down on the milk & wine and I used ricotta cheese.  I also used tilapia instead of flounder.  It was absolutely delicious, and I'm not even a big seafood fan.  The only problem I had was the top layer of lasagna was crispy and the cheese was too well done.  Next time, I'll end with the seafood layer and add the cheese a half hour before the lasagna is done.  Thank you so much, Karena.

I really liked this recipe. Had to change up a couple of things though - didn't have scallops so i just added extra shrimp. Used white zinfandel wine and Ricotta cheese as others suggested.  A couple of things that may help clarify this a bit.  Cut your flounder into bite size pieces, microwave your cream cheese for a few seconds to soften so it will stir in easily with the ricotta (you don't need a mixer for this recipe). I also used the no-cook lasagna noodles - that was  a big time saver.(if you use no-cook noodles make sure they have sauce on top of them while cooking or they won't soften up. 

Prep took me about 25 mins, but remember I didn't have to cook my noodles. If your shrimp is already cooked and peeled, you probably can cut prep time down to 15 mins. It's good and may encourage non fish-eaters!!

I felt this recipe was very sound. I did change some ingredients to suit my
tastes like ricotta instead of cottage cheese. I added some mushrrom and 
broccoli and chose different seafood. However all in all the foundation of 
of this recipe is what counts and it was very good.

I agree with the other reviews-  VERY good, but prep time was about 55 minutes rather than 5.  Used ricotta instead of cottage cheese, but other than that I followed the instructions exactly.  Thank you for posting this recipe!  I'm very pleased with the finished product!

This wasn't what I expected.  I really wanted a "wow" kind of dish, and this really wasn't it.  It was good, but something was missing.  I'm not sure what it is.  I will probably make again, just tinker with it.  Thanks for the post.

Thought this meal would taste fishy but guess what, it wasn't. It was very good. We served a salad and garlic bread to go along with it.

This was ok the 1st day. But I recommend making it ahead a day, and reheating. Gives time for the flavors to come through. The 1st day, tasted more like a fish casserole. Next time I make this I will only make it with crab meat and shrimp.

Sorry but we didn't think this was very good at all. I don't think cheese and seafood go together very well. It was an expensive mistake.

Oh my gosh, this is the best ever.  I have made it twice.  I took it to my office for an Inauguration Day lunch and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. I use scallops and imitation crab meat and it's great.  I put in more cheese -how can more cheese ever be too much?  I'm making it Saturday night for a friend's 50th birthday.  Again, the best!

I just made this and am so impressed! This dish is tastier than most restaurant food! I made a few substitutions: canned crab and krab for the shrimp, no boil noodles, 1 can of cream of shrimp for 1 of the mushrooms and jarred minced garlic (2 tspns).  I did add fresh spinach for color, as well as some chopped red, orange and yellow sweet peppers I sauteed with the onions. I also used 6 cheese Italian blend cheese and put it throughout. Yes, it took a while to prep, but it was worth every minute. Thanks for a wonderful recipe as well as all the helpful tips!

This was a good dish but I think net tine I will try putting the mozerella between the layers with the cheese mixture so that it will stick together better. Other than that it was delicious!

Terrific flavor; just right for the seafood without overpowering it or making it too rich.  I made it with what I had on hand: 1/2 container ricotta, 1/2 cottage cheese, 1 can mushroom soup, 8oz mozz. cheese, penne pasta, shredded zucchini, no flounder, plus the other recipe ingredients.  I let it sit for 10 min per the recipe and it wasn't too soupy.  I did the layers with the cooked penne, but they didn't stay intact and it was still good.  Next time I'll probably also skip the layering since it I like the sauces mixed together. I didn't detect the mushroom soup flavor - it just added to the sauce without making it too rich.  Next time I might also added sauteed mushrooms and another clove of garlic.  Very good, thanks for the recipe!

This is a wonderful melding of flavors! I sub'd cream of chicken soup because I ran out of mushroom. Also sub'd crab for flounder fillets. We don't care too much for whitefish of any kind.I also sub'd ricotta for cottage cheese, Made this dish much creamier. My family loved this one. Its a keeper! Thanks Karena.

I love this recipe! Have made several times with different variations, every time with wonderful results. Very elegant, guests impressed. I have made this using cream of shrimp soup with splash clam juice, have substituted canned chopped clams for fish (delicious), and always substitute ricotta for cottage cheese. I also add extra layer mozzarella in middle. Great recipe!

My husband and I were a bit skeptical about this recipe, afraid of it not turning out appetizing, but we were definitely pleased with the results!  Though, I would recommend, cutting it down to size for your family because it is not the best warmed up the next day.  Don't get me wrong it is scrumptious right out of the oven!!!

I just made this recipe tonight and it was delicious. It's rich and cheesy and I wasn't too sure about how the cream of mushroom soup was going to taste in a seafood recipe.  But I was not dissapointed in the least.  My friend who doensn't even care for seafood really liked it.  I think he liked the cheesiness.  Wow I'm going to stop writing so I can finish the last of the lasagna in the pan.  Thanks for the recipe.

My family thought this was so good.  I listened to the advice of others and used ricotta cheese.  I also substituted seafood that we liked and it turned out really good.  I am warming it up for lunch today as my son already asked if he could have some.  It does take awhile to put together but it was well worth it.

I thought this was great! I even used frozen seafood from the grocery store.  The only thing I did differently was use only 1 can of cream of mushroom, mainly because I forgot to add the second! I still used the same amount of milk and wine and it was just fine.  Not too watery at all.  I also added shredded mozz. to all the layers in the casserole.  And you cannot end with a layer of pasta or it will get hard during cooking.  I ended with a seafood layer and cheese. One other addition, considering I am from Maryland, I have to add Old Bay seasoning to any seafood dish! Sprinkled it generously on the top and it was great! I will definitely make this again, although I might substitute backfin crab meat for the flounder, as my boyfriend thought the flounder was mushy.

This recipe has gotten rave reviews from all.  The only adjustments I made are: 3 cups mozzerella cheese instead of 2 oz. with some added to cheese layers and covering the top with parm. and mozz. to keep noodles from burning.  I added carrots, red, yellow and green pepper,diced and sauteed with onions, for color.  And I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  I've now had requests for this lucious dish from those who haven't experienced it yet!

Followed the recipe except for using ricotta as others suggested, ten people at the dinner party, ten people put it on their plate, tasted it but didn't eat the rest, so it wasn't just me, no one like it, I'm so happy that I used it as a side dish instead of the main dish, when I try a new recipe I always use it as a side dish so I have a back up plan, and if I see that people really like it then it becomes one of our standard recipes, I threw this recipe in the garbage along with the lasagna, very expensive trash!

I took the advice of several reviewers and made the following changes...and this recipe was Perfect!!!  This is a seafood lovers dream dish!  I substituted Ricotta Cheese for a creamier texture, and I used fresh lump crab as well with small scallop pieces.  Additionally, I used a mix of cream of mushroom & cream of chicken & herb.  I also cut down on the milk & wine so it wouldn't be watery.

At first glance this looks like it would be intimidating, but its actually quite simple. When we made it, we took other reviewers advice and substituted Ricotta instead of cottage cheese, Instead of Milk I used half and half-and Roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup. I think next time I will add some sour cream to the cheese mixture. Both of my kids topped the Lasagna with it -- (it was actually really good, gave it a bit more richness) and also try Monk fish as well.  
We enjoyed this one a lot and will be making it again and again.  :)

I made this recipe for my husband for Valentine's Day and he absolutely raved about it!  I thought it was a little bland, but it was overall a pretty good dish and I will definitely make it again.  But, next time I might try adding some different spices to jazz it up.  I should mention, the one major down side of this recipe is that it is rather time consuming. It took probably over an hour total to prepare and bake it.

My guests and I thought this was great!  I did substitute light cream cheese and 98% fat free soup.  There also weren't any directions on cutting the flounder.  I cut the fillet into bite size pieces, which is what I assumed the author meant for me to do.  Seemed to work.

This was such a good recipe!  I invited some friends over and they loved it!  :)  It was fun and easy to make, but it took a while.  Definitely well worth the wait!

This recipe did take longer to prepare than the recipe indicates and I also used Ricotta cheese.  My only complaint is that is was quite "watery" when I served it, even after letting the dish rest after removing it from the oven.  The next day, however, it was wonderful.

My husband is still talking about this recipe two days later.  The first thing he said when we got home from work is I hope we are having the leftovers of the seafood lasagne.  I love it too!!!

Really liked it. Made very few subs.  I used cottage cheese.  Bay shrimp bay scallops and cod.  Had no dried basil so I used Italian spice mix with fresh basil garnish.  Used some extra mozzarella in the middle.  More than recommended on top.  Saved some cheese mixture for the top too to protect the noodles. Was worried (needlessly) about the amount of mushroom soup.  It was yummy and easier than Bolognese that I normally make.  Clean up was easier too

Halved the cottage cheese, added 500ml of Ricotta too.
Added Peas and Corn, no scallops so added a few mussels.  No white wine.

Make and bake it a day ahead and then reheat to serve!  This is definitely better the 2nd day.  I made the original recipe first then followed the advice of some others.  I used Ricotta cheese, cream of shrimp soup,  fake crab instead of the flounder and the Italian 5 cheese mix.  I have made this about  6 times and get rave reviews.

An absolute crowd pleaser. I still have people talking about it from a Christmas party. Definitely add cream of seafood versus mushroom. 
Great the next day as well.
