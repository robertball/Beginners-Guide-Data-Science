I cut the recipe in half & added a couple of inch long squirts of anchovie paste. And I used a ligher flavored oil so it wouldn't taste so heavy. Served this w/ homemade italian bread, celery, baby carrots & bell peppers. The bell peppers meshed the best w/ this dip, I think.

My family used to have bagna cauda frequently.  The versions we had included a can of anchioves and then it was served like a fondue.  On the side, serve napa cabbage, peppers, onion, etc.  Put the veggies in the pot like you would a fondue and then serve them on italian bread.  Don't forget the wine!

I made this for a wedding shower and it was terrible.  I had several people try it before I served it, and they didn't like it either.  We ended up having to run out to buy Ranch dressing to serve with all the vegies instead.  Sorry, but this was a no-go.

awful. Too much olive oil. Not enough consistency for what I was looking for. Two thumbs way down.

Are the ingredient amounts accurate? I followed them carefully, but the dip was so thin and the olive oil so overpowering, we couldn't even taste the garlic and the cream was insignificant. The instructions make it appear there's a possibility the garlic could brown. How could that happen in 1 1/2 cups of oil?

i am not a big fan of this version,but it was okay!
in our family,we traditionaly make it with anchovies,butter and or olive oil
and use a chewy italian bread,cabbage,celery,brocc,cauli,and green bell peppers....maybe just traditional for me but so good
