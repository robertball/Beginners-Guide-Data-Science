This is a delicious cookie, and it looks so pretty as a Christmas dessert! I made mine in 1" balls, and they were perfectly set at 10 minutes. To me, 3 Tbsp. of milk made the glaze a little too runny, so next time I would cut back a tiny bit. I got several compliments on them, and I will be making these again!

This recipe was AWESOME...I forgot to roll the first batch in sugar, which ended up tasting better because it wasn't as sweet and gritty. I also baked for 10 minutes. I ground candy canes in a Magic Bullet, which turned out beautifully...the colors looked like speckles..Thanks

I love these things, but I will never, ever make them again.

Positives: very pepperminty, different from the normal holiday cookies everyone makes, and just plain yummy. 

Negatives: BACK ACHE. These things take forever to roll. I even had to get my hubby to help because my back was killing me after about 50 of them. Only make these if you have a lot of time! I didn't realize just how long they would take otherwise I would've started an hour or 2 earlier.

These cookie were perfect recipe.  They were easy and I love easy.  My son and I made these on New Year's Eve (trying to rid ourselves of the candy canes in the house) and after they cooled we stored them in a large Tupperware container. The flavor enhanced overnight and we iced them today.  We are taking them to my stepdaughter's house.  They made just about 60 like stated--some of dough balls were larger than others.  I believe I had 58, so had we made some smaller there would have been well over 60.    
There was one review that stated the cookie was dry.  It is not a chewy cookie and they are fab with milk or coffee.  HAPPY NEW YEAR!

These cookies got rave reviews this year! My sister and I teamed up to make them, and my mom said that they were the best cookies she had ever had in her entire life (she's not a people pleaser either, so we know she meant it!). Here's a tip for crushing up candy canes or peppermint candy: unwrap them and put them in a plastic bag. use a mallet or meat tenderizer to crush. works like a charm.

great cookie, although it was a bit crumbly. I got tired of rolling so I took all the dough left and placed it in a greased and floured baking pan, topped it with crushed candy and baked it at 350 for 15-20 min. As it cooled I scored it with a knife to make cutting easier.

So yummy and easy.  I was looking for a quick and fun recipe to make with my 3 and 5 year olds.  Sugar cookies sounded fun, but didn't want to wait for the dough to chill.  I rolled the balls to get the right size, let them roll them in sugar, and then let them decorate in either crushed candy canes or colored sprinkles.  They had a blast and the cookies turned out great.  Thanks for a new holiday tradition!

These cookies are delicious! I made two batches, the first one was great, but in the second batch I used just a tad bit more peppermint extract and they were even BETTER! Perfectly baked, melt in your mouth and a great hit with the friends and family!

I made this recipe for the first time yesterday and was very pleased with how they turned out.  The cookies were soft in the middle and had the perfect amount of peppermint flavor and sweetness.  I didn't wind up rolling the cookie dough in the sugar and only used 2 tablespoons of skim milk when making the glaze for a thicker consistency and added a tiny drop of peppermint extract to it. 

If your cookies came out too dry or crumbly, chances are are you added too much flour, probably inadvertently by scooping the flour directly into the cup.  In order to prevent this I scoop flour with a spoon and dump the flour into the measuring cup and give the cup a little shake each time I add the flour.  Level the measuring cup off using the straight edge of a butter knife.

These are awesome - they are very buttery but I thought the amount of peppermint flavoring was just right.  Theses were gone quick!

These look so pretty on a cookie tray but the flavor is just okay. I drizzled the glaze on the cookies using a paistry bag with a very small tip and they came out looking great.

As is, I thought they needed more peppermint extract. I also was expecting more of a buttery, meltaway cookie and they were't. The candy canes also melted on my sheet pan, so maybe they were too big. I did add peppermint extract to the frosting to kind of pump up the flavor and that did help. I don't know if I would make these again though.

These are pretty and taste great but mine look nothing like the picture.  They came out very flat.  Next time I'll use cake flour and see if that helps.

Not sure where I went wrong on this one but they did not stay balls, they flattened out while baking so that was disapointing. They were tasty and chewy but nothing too exciting. Wont make again for xmas cookie giveaways :(

GREAT COOKIE! My 4 year old & I just finished baking a batch. Our batch made about 4.5 dozen. I followed the cookie recipe exact but used a different glaze for the cookie (hence the 4 stars). All 5 of us LOVE this cookie! Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a great, festive cookie, but I'd leave off the glaze. It does make it more appealing, but I didn't like the favor change.

Pretty for the holidays, but they were a little dry, and not exceptionally flavorful.  Maybe I'll add some sour cream to them if I make them again.

These are delicious - with or without the icing. Just enough mint flavor to have a delicious cookie but not overpowering. Very easy and fun for my daughter to join in on making too. One thing though - the image shows cookie that looks like balls and mine definitely flattened out more than that.

Delicious! But you don't have to roll them into balls. Just use your cookie scoop! It gives a nice round top and a flat bottom. Perfect looking, uniform cookies in a fraction of the time! And soooo yummy!!

These are the best cookies ever!  I couldn't find the peppermint candies needed to make these cookies so I used one box of candy canes and it was the exact amount needed. I also used my Magic Bullet to crush the candy and it worked perfectly! I used the shaker top to sprinkle the candy on top of the iced cookies!  MMMM, thank you!

I made these cookies about a week ago now, and they were awesome! My mom and dad loved them. They were a bit of a messy cleanup, because the candy canes and the glaze got everything all sticky, but it was absolutely worth it.... However, I did not roll them in sugar, because the first batch I made tasted too sweet, so I omitted it. Other than that, it is definitely going to be a Christmas staple, and I'm going to make them for the Christmas party at my youth group! :)

WOW! These are great!! I goofed a little and added the entire cup of peppermint to the batter, but it tasted great anyways. I drizzed w/glaze and sprinkled with red sugar instead of peppermint. I also made a small batch and added white chocolate chips to those...they taste good too. Ilove it! This recipies a keeper ;-) Thank you.
