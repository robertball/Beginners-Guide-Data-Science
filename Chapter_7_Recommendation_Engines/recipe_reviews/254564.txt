There was nothing special about this smoothie. I cut the recipe in half for 1 serving and it was a very small portion. My banana was frozen so I eliminated the ice cubes and I added 2 packets of Truvia. With so many other pumpkin smoothie recipes this is one that I will not repeat.

Very delicious! I added a small protein shake because I don't use the protein powder and it was delicious!
