I review a lot of recipes, but I'm happy to be the first reviewer of this one. The flavor of these is wonderful and would get five stars on its own. They are moist and fluffy. There are a couple of small problems, however. The recipe states to fill the cupcake liners "to the top". Even when I did this I ended up with 14 cupcakes. I'm a very experienced baker, so I wish I had gone with my gut and made 15 or 16 cupcakes. I ended up with the cupcakes spilling over the tops and adhering to the cupcake pan. I thought with all that baking powder they'd rise nicely, but they were pretty flat. I did follow the directions precisely, but added the vanilla with the other wet ingredients. I'm certain this didn't affect the outcome.  The frosting is delicious, but mine turned out somewhat thin, even without all the milk. My advice would be to make 15 or 16 cupcakes, and to add NO milk to the frosting until the very end and then, only if you need it.

I heeded the review of Pam-3 boysmama, I did not put milk in the frosting at all and used 3 1/2 cups of confectioners sugar. OMG delicious! I hope there's some left for my bosses birthday on Tuesday!! Oh and mine made 22 cupcakes.

Totally delicious twist on carrot cake. I wish I'd made carrot cake sooner because I totally love it. This recipe was easy enough to follow and turned out perfectly, and this coming from someone easily frustrated in the kitchen. I even messed up on the frosting and it turned out okay. I was distracted by a scary movie and didn't read the instructions. I added the butter and cream cheese to the confectioners sugar and had to mix it dry. I ended up with a few lumps, but it still turned out good. Pic of my results added :)

After reading some of the reviews, I felt compelled to make some additions to the recipe. I followed the recipe as is, but added 1/2 tsp of ginger, allspice and nutmeg each. Came out very flavorful, fluffy, and light. Loved them. Made samples to take to work with me. These just might be the cupcakes for Easter we've been looking for!!! Thanks urbansunshine!!

I make a lot of cupcakes and am always looking for a new recipe to try.  This was my first try at carrot cupcakes.  I used  butter instead of oil and creamed the butter, sugar and vanilla, then added the eggs, flour mixture and carrots and pineapple.  They came out great.  My one suggestion would be to make sure you grate the carrots.  I put them in a food processor and I don't think I got the pieces quite small enough.

I also used vanilla paste instead of vanilla extract in the frosting.

This recipe was good but not great. Admittedly, I made a couple of mods: instead of oil I subbed an equal amount of pineapple juice which made it deliciously moist but baking time needed to be adjusted. I also used light brown sugar instead of white. Finally, and this was just my error as I misread the recipe, I used 2 cups of finely shredded carrot instead of 1 cup. The result was an ultramoist cake, really fluffy too. But it lacked the spice that typifies a carrot cake IMO, and I even added a bit of powdered ginger to it. I was surprised it lacked nuts and/or raisins but I figured maybe the taste would be so good that they wouldn't be missed. Not so. And I'm not the "Paula Deen" type of baker who thinks everything can be made to taste good with a ton of sugar and/or butter/oil. Kinda bummed.

At any rate, the recipe wasn't bad but if you like a moderately to strongly spiced carrot cake then this recipe isn't for you. I don't know that I would try this recipe again but if I did it would be so heavily modified that it wouldn't be the same recipe anymore.

Also, if anyone is curious, all that added moisture did not ruin the cakey-ness--it was just not a dry cake at all. They also weren't too sweet, but they did have an extra carrot-y flavor due to my error but still tasty. But like I saw another reviewer mentioned, they didn't rise particularly well. If you're okay with flat cupcake tops and the lack of texture and spice, then by all means try this recipe.

Great recipe!! cake is super moist and delicious. I cut the sugar in half and used whole wheat flour and apple sauce and added walnuts. It turned out awesome!! The sweetness of the pineapple and the carrots makes up for the less sugar.  It can actually pass for a "healthy" treat!!  I don't think it even needs the frosting... but wants it...

My son loves carrot cake but is allergic to nuts so I liked the fact this recipe didn't have any.  I had my doubts when these came out of the oven because they had overflowed the cups and were a pain to get out of the pan (next time I'll only fill the cups 3/4 and make 14-16 cupcakes).  These didn't rise very high and I was afraid they would be dense or dry but they were moist and fluffy.  Only change I made was I used canola oil instead of vegetable oil because that is what I had on hand.  The frosting was delicious but I would recommend holding off on adding the milk because I didn't need to add any at all.  Next time I'm going to try adding some golden raisins - this recipe is definitely a keeper!  Thank for sharing!

I have used this recipe for 40 years.  It is from the Better Homes and Garden Recipe Book I got for my first Christmas from my husband.  Awesome recipe, but not too dietary but scrumptious.  I still use it and I get rave reviews all thetime!  I make exactly 
Ike this recipe, I don't deviate from it at all!

This was excellent. I subbed applesauce for half the oil to make it a little healthier. I made some of it as cupcakes and baked some in a 9x13; the cupcakes were much better.

These were really really good! I did make a few changes to this as I often do to suit my family's taste.  I added an additional 1/2 tsp cinnamon,1/2 cup nuts,1/2 cup of raisins and 1/2 cup of cranberries per batch.  I did as someone else recommended and removed the milk from the icing ingredients and used the pineapple juice instead.  The frosting was killer! Best cream cheese frosting I have made. Made a double batch for Easter and everyone loved them! thanks for this recipe. I will make again.

I made these yesterday with some healthy substitutions! I used unsweetened applesauce for the oil, whole wheat pastry flour for regular flour, 1/2 c white, 1/2 c brown sugar, and added some allspice. They were so moist and delicious!! I also only used about 2 1/2 cups of confectioners sugar in the frosting.

These came out delish! I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil because I had it (and what a perfect recipe for the substitution!). I used a square cupcake pan which makes a dozen and a mini cupcake pan and both shapes and sizes came out moist and delicious. I used less sugar and omitted the milk in the frosting and wish I had halved the frosting, as I had a bunch left over. 
Just as an FYI (because I was not sure myself when starting) a cup of carrot is roughly three good sized carrots. 
Might add some more baking spices next time but this is great as is!

I made the recipes exact. Love the flavours and my kids are eating them up quickly. I would however put another 1/2 cup of powdered sugar into the icing and it is a little softer than usual icings. Otherwise I would make it again and again. Yum-O!

This is an awesome recipe.  I wasn't sure about how it would taste with the pineapple but it is an awesome addition to a classic recipe.  The only changes I made were to add about 1/2 cup more of flour to the batter and when I made the frosting I used a tablespoon of pineapple juice instead of Milk.  Also I read the other reviews and some said not to fill the muffin tins to the top, I found the ones I filled to the top came out more rounded then the ones that were not filled to the top.  Awesome recipe it was a total hit for my husband’s birthday!

SO easy and delicious. I made the cake batter exactly as stated (I honestly don't understand how people can rate the original recipe after they've altered the heck out of it), and it came out perfect. Cake was light, yet moist. I think it was done in less than 20 minutes (probably around 17 or 18). I only made half the frosting and it was enough (we only lightly frost ours, and one of my kids won't eat any frosting at all so we leave it off some, too). If I eliminate the frosting altogether I can convince myself that this is a healthy breakfast option for my kids. :) Made 12 cupcakes and then poured the rest into a greased loaf pan -- made a very thin "cake" but I can cut pieces off to give to my toddler.

I was craving carrot cake but was out of several items called for in my recipe (brown sugar, nuts, coconut, raisins) so, using the ingredient search feature, I found this.  It made 16 nice sized cupcakes, very moist and tasty.  I did not need the milk in the frosting.  Next time I think I'll up the  cinnamon a little and only make 3/4 recipe of frosting, because there is so much left over. What to do, what to do with the left over frosting And not a naked graham  cracker in the house.

Absolutely love these.  I use fresh pineapple as I have access to it all the time here in Nicaragua.  I just squeeze out the juice.  They are VERY good.

The first time I baked these cupcakes, I thought they were a little bland, so the next time, I added 1/2 tsp. of ground ginger, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg and 1 tsp. allspice to the dry ingredients.  Also, if you like a smoother texture without chunky carrot pieces, I recommend grating the carrots by hand, using the smallest grating surface on a box grater.   They are delicious with or without frosting.

I just have to say this is the first time I made carrot cupcakes by scratch and I absolutely love this recipe ?? very delicious and moist I added whole wheat flour instead of the all purpose flour to make them less fatning and replaced the regular sugar for 2 cups of splenda and incorporated 1 cup of chopped walnuts and 2 cups of golden raisins since I made 24 cupcakes I increases my ingredients and made cream cheese frosting with 2 8 Oz packed room temperature cream cheese half a cup of room temperature butter and mix them together until well blended add 1 tbs of vanilla and 2 cupon aconfetti sugar one at a time and decorate your cupcakes however way you would like I sprinkled walnuts on top of my cupcakes to make them look nice hope my review helps

Boy were these a big hit with my family. I always read reviews and make changes as needed but this time there were not many suggestions. So I left recipe as is and boy I was sure glad I did. Not sure what fuss was about the rise. Oh, I did fill about 3/4 full I felt that was perfect. They are so very most you will enjoy them. Recipe made exactly 14 using ice cream scoop.

I was looking for a muffin that was not too dense and didn't have so much in it that my little ones wouldn't eat it.  This fits the bill.  It's fluffier than a muffin, but has the texture and sweetness of a muffin without the big bites of raisins or nuts.  There is only the hint of cinnamon, so if you are looking for a spicy carrot cake, this may not be for you.  I did not use vegetable oil, but used coconut oil (melted) instead.  Made very moist little cakes.  Also, I did not realize that I was out of powdered sugar, so I mixed marshmallow creme with cream cheese and a small amount of powdered sugar for icing.  Worked great.

Very nice. I followed other reviewers advice and made only 3/4 of the frosting, yet I still had heaps left over. Next time, I will only make half of the amount of frosting. We ate all 12 cupcakes within 8 hours...

These cupcakes are heavenly! 
I was trying NOT to eat one and save them for the party I'm taking them to, but messed up the top of one, so I made the sacrifice of eating it, and by golly, even without frosting these are delightful!!! 
I will say, though, I added golden raisins and walnuts, but that's just a personal preference. 
This recipe is a keeper!

I made these for my wedding and instead of using canned pineapple, I used "fake pineapple" which was actually zuchinni cooked in pineapple juice, lemon juice and sugar and canned.  I also sometimes put in raisins too.  Everyone loved them and I make them often.  My mom especially loved my carrot cake.

very good carrot cupcakes! Since I don't like my carrot cakes to greasy I used just slightly less oil and filled the balance of the 2/3 cup with the juice I strained off the pineapple. Very delish! Will definitely make again. Thank you, urbansunshine for a great recipe!

Made these today and stuck to the exact recipe. The texture and flavor were exactly what you would expect from carrot cake. This batch made 16 cupcakes which I fill to the top as instructed. They fluffed up exactly as I was expecting them to with a nice rounded top on all of them. I will say I didnt notice a difference from the flavor of the pineapple though. Next time will try adding some of the juice in the mix. As for the frosting it made about double of what was needed and that was with adding a generous amount onto each cupcake but the flavor was good and it was a nice light frosting

I love it, but i did some modifications with the pineapple, carrot and vanilla I added 1/2 cup shedded coconut and 1/2 cup of crush walnuts. For the frosting I didn’t use milk and olny use 1 1/2 cup of confessional sugar because I don’t like things to sweet. Then i garnish with crush walnuts. At work they love it!!

Yummy, nice moist cupcake. The frosting makes way too much for one recipe, I'd recommend halving the frosting recipe. Per other reviews I omitted the milk from the cream cheese frosting.

Super Flavorful and Moist!    I added about a half cup of chopped raisins, also.  I didn't have any lemon left, so I added  1 tsp of grated orange zest which was a perfect compliment.   I used brown sugar for the cream cheese frosting and some more orange zest.  I would make these again.  MAYBE A HELPFUL HINT:  Watch them closely the last five minutes of baking.  Mine were done after 15.  Maybe because in live in Colorado Springs...high altitude.  They felt like they had been slightly over cooked with the first batch at 20 minutes.

If I make them again, I wil add a little more flavor, they were too bland for me.  More pineapple and spices.   I also did not use cream cheese frosting on them, since my daughter cannot eat it, I put a fluffly brown sugar frosting on them and it was very good!

Delicious.
A little sweet for me - maybe I'll try with 3/4 cup sugar instead next time.  
I also added 1/4 teaspoon ginger, nutmeg and cloves, and used freshly grated pineapple I need to used up as it was starting to get a little over ripe.  The top crust was a little crustier and a few of them came away from the actual muffin.  Again I think the lid looked like it had too much sugar but only slightly
Haven't done the icing yet, as they really good without

The moistest cupcake ever!  I made them for my husband's birthday (who is a carrot cake freak) and they are his new favorite.  We tend to like a bit more spice and love that cream cheese taste, so here are some alterations I used:

- add 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the cake mix
- 1/2 tsp of allspice
- 1/4 tsp ginger
- 1/4 tsp nutmeg
-  used less powdered sugar ( 2 3/4C) in icing  so     
    we could really taste the cream cheese 

Eat and enjoy!

This recipe failed miserably for me and I'm a fairly experienced baker. I filled to the top as directed and still had enough extra batter to make 13 cupcakes. They all expanded over the top and into one another while baking and crumbled apart when I tried to remove them. Now I have no cupcakes for my gathering tomorrow :(

I liked the flavor and they were very light. I wanted something a little more dense but these were fluffy and delicious. I just had a different version in my head of what I wanted but there was nothing wrong with these.  The recipe was suppose to yield 12 as written and mine provided 18.  The first 12 I filled up to the top as written which I didnt care for when cooked the second 6 I filled half way and they were perfect.

Followed the recipe.  Made NO changes.  Turned out perfectly.  Made exactly 12 beautiful cupcakes.  My secret - measure and do as directed.  Make changes next time if it is not as expected.  It was better than expected given the reviews suggestions.

This was the most moist cupcake that I have ever had and it was delicious.  I halved the sugar content and found that it was still sweet enough.

These were awesome! Made the cupcake recipe exactly as stated, but took other people's recommendations and didn't add the milk to the icing. Quick, easy and delicious! Will make again and again :)

The cupcakes are light and fluffy, rather sweet and fairly bland, but a great way to use up carrots. The only change I made was the standard switch from oil to applesauce. This reduced the calories from 245 to 135 calories per un-iced cupcake.  They rose in the pan more than I expected, but from reading the reviews I was prepared and filled the tins only about 3/4 full and buttered the top of my muffin tin just in case they still spilled over. I had no difficulty getting them out of the pan. Next time I will reduce the sugar to 2/3 cup since they were too sweet, and add another tsp. cinnamon. I didn't ice them. I've attached a picture.

Made exactly as written and they came out wonderfully! The cake is light and airy, but moist. The frosting was great and the perfect compliment to these cupcakes. You can't go wrong with this recipe.

Light yet filling.  Good flavour (doubled the cinnamon), and frosting was not overly sweet.

SOOOOO GOOD!!  Didn't change a thing, and they did come out moist and tasty. The frosting was left over, maybe I could have made half the frosting. But the frosting was delicious, it is slowly dwindling as my fiancé cannot keep hands off. LOL oh well!

For a carrot cupcake, I found this too pinapple-y. The cream cheese was too sweet for me. I was disappointed because all the reviews raved about it. I'm on a constant search for perfection so maybe it's just me. The cream cheese was not watery like some reviewers said. Maybe they used an electric mixer to combine the ingrdients which can release fluids from both the butter and the cheese.

These cupcakes simultaneously overflowed their cups while still being flat. The ones I filled half full turned out the best. They taste ok, although I think it's more of a spice cake flavor than a true carrot cake. I bake all the time, so I was a little disappointed in the end result.

I just made this and it was superb. I followed it to tee but left out the frosting (because cream cheese is expensive in our country) and added a bit more carrots. It's moist and delicious even when baked in a toaster oven with no temperature setting. It needed about 20mins to bake.

These were great! I omitted the milk in the frosting and had to add 1/4 C additional Confectioner's sugar as the consistency was still a bit " soupy." Otherwise I will be making this again.
