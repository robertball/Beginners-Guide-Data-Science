I will NEVER use brownie mix again since this recipe is super easy and even more tasty! Semisweet chips definitely give a depth of flavor you just can't get from cocoa powder. Be sure to use quality chocolate chips to ensure the best chocolate flavor. Also, you might want to temper the eggs before adding them to the warm chocolate mixture or allow the chocolate mixture to cool a bit so you don't end up with scrambled eggs in the batter. I used a 16 ounce bag of chocolate chips, melting the 1 1/2 cups as the recipe calls for and adding the extra 1/2 cup to the cooled batter so I could have chocolate chunks in the brownies.  (If you do add the extra chocolate chips, toss them in a teaspoon of flour to coat them so they won't sink to the bottom of the pan.) Thanks for sharing this recipe. I'll be making these brownies again and again!

I'm very impressed. In fact, I have to go change my review of another brownie recipe because this one is absolutely the best (and I can't say that about the other recipe anymore). Tastes just like the brownies out of a box. I followed the recipe exactly, baked for 25 minutes, and they are perfect. I have to hurry and freeze them so I don't eat them all in one sitting. Next time, I will omit the salt, but that is the only modification I will make. Except doubling or tripling this recipe! Worth the hype. This will now be my brownie recipe of choice. Excellent! *update: these are just as delicious after being frozen! I defrosted at room temperature in a sandwich bag. Still delicious! *update 2: I have also made these as mini cupcakes. In the oven for 7 minutes makes them just cooked enough. Yum, yum, yum! Huge hit at a recent party!

MMMMM...Delicious!!! These brownies are rich, chocolatey, and absolutely fabulous! I mean to try to describe these brownies using just one word may be virtually impossible, just as impossible as it is to eat just one of these. If you LOVE chocolate, then this is the brownie for you! Definitely have a tall glasss of ice cold milk on hand, 'cause you're gonna need it! I substituted 2 Tbsp. of coffee liqueur for the water and since a bag of Hershey's chocolate chips is 2 cups I took the other 1/2 cup and tossed those into the batter before baking - I mean you can never have too much chocolate. I baked them for 30 minutes in an 8x8 glass pan sprayed with Pam for baking. I highly recommend rinsing/wiping down your knife between each slice when cutting your brownies so you get nice slices. I topped them off with a dusting of confectioners' sugar and next time I might add in some chopped walnuts. These are a must try for all the brownie lover's out there!

WOW!!! Are you kidding me? These are definitely the best brownies I've ever had. I was really craving brownies, but was out of cocoa powder, so I wanted a recipe that didn't require it. These brownies definitely hit the spot...I ate so much, I went to work out afterwards! The use of chocolate chips in this recipe make the chocolate taste more "chocolatey" if you will. It is very rich and better than any store bought I know of...I feel less guilty about eating these than the boxed mixes that have additives, preservatives, and hydrogenated oils. These brownies are killer. One thing though...I baked mine for more than the recommended time. I was concerned about doing this because the recipe stresses not to overbake the brownies, but I guess it varies by oven. I used the toothpick test and it did not come out clean, so I baked for about another 12 to 15 minutes. The edges were just crispy and the middle was just done, almost fudgy..... Also, I didn't have an 8x8 pan, but I wanted brownies so bad that I used a round dish (not even a pan, a dish!). But it didn't matter. YYYUUUUMMM!!! Try these...you won't be disappointed. Thanks for sharing this one. It's a keeper.

WOW.  These are great - fudgey, chocolately - everything I want in a brownie.  This will be my new brownie recipe and it's so easy too!  By the way 1 1/2 c of chocolate chips is equal to a 9 oz bag.

I've never made brownies with melted chocolate chips before so I was very curious, however, with so many reviewers pleased with this recipe I felt confident I wouldn't be disappointed - and I wasn't. I used Ghiradelli chocolate chips and reduced the salt to 1/4 tsp.  As the submitter warns, don't overbake and you'll be rewarded with rich, fudgy brownies.  Great as is, but I topped mine with Brownie Frosting, recipe also from this site.

All I can say is "WOW".  I doubled the recipe and baked in a 10x12 pan for 28 minutes.  I used unsalted butter and just used a pinch of salt (don't like to taste any salt!).  Also - I love chocolate and rasberry together - so I added a tiny bit of rasberry extract - and wow - added just the taste I was looking for!  Thanks a bunch!!!!

Really moist and fudgy, with a crisp top layer, these were easy to make and fabulous the next day.  I think I will abandon my old tried and true one I've been making for years.

These brownies could have been made from a mix. They had the flakey top layer that you get from a mix, the great chewy crust pieces, and an awesome deep dark fudgey chocolate flavor. I don't need to buy brownies from a box anymore. 
*edit*
I wanted to try a PB/Chocolate brownie so I used half PB chips and half chocolate chips in this recipe. The verdict? If you want peanut butter chocolate brownies, marble some PB into the tops of this recipe using the full amount of chocolate chips.

I used irish cream for water & I did only bake for 25 minutes. While they were baking, I heated 1/3 cup of Irish cream to boiling & added 8 oz of chopped white chocolate, stirring until it melted. Letting it sit to cool before pouring/spreading on the cooled brownies. I let them set up in the fridge before slicing. They were good but I thought they needed more butter. Thanks for the recipe!

"Tastes like it's from a mix"?!  That's insulting!  (especially at the cost of the chocolate that goes in it)

It's far better than a mix, and has been getting rave reviews.  I added a splash of Kahlua (my grandmother's secret).  It look a bit longer to bake, but turned out fabulous!

The great thing about this recipe is that if you like gooey brownies, when baked for around 25 mins, the melted chocolate with ensure they are gooey!  If you prefer them cake-y, you can cook for longer & they will cake up.  Brilliant, no?!  They also have that beautiful glossy top & chewy edges :)
I really recommend letting the melted chocolate mix cool a minute or two before whisking the egg in, just to avoid cooking any of the egg.  
...Oh, and I also love that everything in this recipe is a real ingredient, no prepackaged mixes - no ingredients list that sounds like a laboratory inventory!  Chocolate happiness, no?!

These were very good brownies.  I think I substituted half of the white sugar for brown, added some coconut, some chopped nuts, and made them into brownie muffins.  They were very moist and delicious! UPDATE: I took this recipe and created my own version of it. Really, I changed it so much its not even the same, heheh. But had I never come across this recipe, my version would never have existed. So thank you! My version of it has become my one and only brownie. Always fudgey and gooey.

This was much too sweet! I did double the recipe and baked it  in a 9x13 in glass pan! HW I would suggest not putting any salt in it! I only put 2 1/2 cups choc even tho I doubled the recipe! I also only put a little less than 1 cup of sugar... even then it was too sweet! the texture came out perfect! This was okay... but I would not rate it as the "best brownies I've ever had"!! maybe you'll have better luck than me! *_*

My hubby had a craving for brownies so I decided to make this recipe because it looked easy.  What a surprise!!  Fabulous taste (melt in your mouth) perfect texture and not overly sweet.  I am not a fan of brownies, but I couldn’t stop eating these!  Hubby gave them 2 thumbs up and said they were the best brownies he had ever tasted.  I didn't modify the recipe at all and won't when i make them again--it's perfect.  I baked them for 25 minutes in an 8 x 8 pan and i think that 30 minutes would have dried them out.  The toothpick test does not work for brownies, so i checked to see if brownies were pulling away from the sides of pan (slightly) This is definitely a repeat!

These are awesome brownies.  I played with the recipe a bit to combat the cake-like quality of the brownies that some reviewers complained about, and found that using only 1 egg makes them much more fudge-like.  Would be 5 stars for me with this change.  
Also, I reserved about 1/3 cup of the chocolate chips to sprinkle on top before baking.  Yum!

Great recipe, but I have to admit I was hesitant at first when I added the chocolate chips into the water/butter/sugar mixture. I was worried my chocolate would seize and when it was looking too pasty I transferred the chocolate mixture to my Kitchen-Aid bowl and began blending it together really well which helped as I added the vanilla and eggs. I baked this in my springform pan for 22 minutes. Makes a great cakey brownie!

I made this particular brownie recipe because I had everything in stock. I used Nestle's semi sweet morsels and followed the recipe except I tried the first review's suggestion of mixing another half cup of morsels in flour for chunks of chocolate in the brownies. Well I guess my mixture was still too warm and they melted anyway. That said, these brownies were perfect...not too cakey, and not too fudgey. Our guest cleaned the dish spotless. I baked them in an 8X8 glass Pyrex for exactly 25 minutes. They held together very well and weren't crumbly like a lot of brownies, very moist and no need for anything extra like frosting...they were sweet enough and thick enough as they are. I think I'll just add 2 cups of morsels next time I make them instead of 1 1/2 cups to achieve the exact brownie texture...and I will make these again and again.

Be sure to let the chocolate mixture cool or temper the eggs, or you will get cooked eggs in your mixture. I baked these for 30 minutes and they came out perfect.

Yummy! These brownies were so good and almost perfect. Mine had to cook for 35 minutes instead of 25-30. But the main thing - too much salt! And I did measure it out. I usually don't, but this time I did and made sure it was 1/2 tsp. Each bite I took it was like, "Wow this is good, but there is that hint of salt at the end". I didn't like that and I am suprised that it happened. Next time, if I am using salted butter, I will not use any salt. Otherwise - awesome brownies. This will definitely be my new "Go to" recipe. Thanks!

These are truly the best brownies I have ever made, possibly even ever had. They are the perfect brownie texture - fudgey with a flakey top. I can't see myself ever using another recipe again. I followed this one to a 't' and see no need to alter any of it. I would suggest using good quality chocolate chips.

I love this recipe!!! I doubled it though because an 8x8 pan don't last long with 4 little boys in the house! They were cakey but moist which I usually don't like cakey brownies but these are now my favorite!

Wow. I'm not sure what happened, but these did not turn out well for me at all.  The middle completely collapsed and left a 3 inch hole! The brownie was really dry, airy and not sweet or fudgy at all.  I was hoping that I would be able to post a more positive review, but I will try again with different chocolate and more butter.

This recipe was not to my taste at all.  It was like chocolate cake without the chocolate flavor.  Very bland.  I followed the recipe to the letter.  I would not recommend this to anyone.

Very good.  Seems I did my best to mess up this recipe and it still turned out beautifully.  When I put the chips into the butter mix it started to overcook and harden but just went with it not wanting to throw my chips out.  Put the eggs in and just wisked like crazy.  Then I used a gluten free flour and cooked like stated.  Was wonderful.  I love these.  It has probably turned into my go-to recipe for brownies.

These turned out horrible!  I hate to rate somebody's recipe this way, but my brownies didn't turn out at all.  The center never cooked through (it was like a pudding-filled cake), and I let them cook for 45 minutes hoping they would set.  They were also salty.  Yuck!

My boyfriend loves brownies...chewy and moist brownies. I found them!!  These are excellent brownies.  If the nutrition infomation is correct they aren't half bad for you considering I made a batch yesterday that was three times as bad nutritionally and did not compare in taste!!

I would have to say these were one of the worst brownies I have ever made!  It was more like a cake than a brownie.  My kids told me to never make them again.  Actually I ended up throwing them out and trying a different recipe.  Hopefully I will have more success.

I don't know what I did wrong.  I used a really high quality chocolate to make them even better and the texture was nothing like described in the other reviews.  Mine were cakey and barely tasted like anything. Very disappointing.

These brownies are the best I've ever made, from scratch or otherwise. There is a lovely little crust on the top as there should be! I added chocolate chips to one batch right before pouring into the baking dish, and that made them even better. I highly recommend this recipe!

I'm sort of a brownie snob but loved the consistency of these.  After putting the brownie mixture in the pan I combined 1 brick of cream cheese, 1/2 cup of sugar, and one egg.  I poured that on top of the brownie mixture and marbled the two together.  You will have to bake the brownies a little longer.

These were ridiculously easy and fast to make.  The brownies were delicious and I can't imagine ever using a boxed version again.  
I doubled the recipe and used a 9 x 13 pan.  The end result was sheer perfection.

Cook at 325 for THIRTY FIVE (35) minutes in convection oven. Not 25. Tried at 30. A hard crust formed and even after testing, the stick came out clean. But once the pan cooled and the brownies settled, I discovered it was not cooked through the middle. And when tested with the stick, it came out a little gooey. Sweetness was good, but omitted salt because I used salted butter. Requires attention to stirring.

This recipe did not work for me! The chocolate seized the moment it hit the butter/sugar/water mixture. I was so disappointed in the waste of good ingredients that I didn't bother trying again. Save yourself the trouble and find a new receipe.

The first time I tried this recipe I had to cook it for 40 min. till the middle was cooked, and it came out kinda flat and VERY salty, and  I could barely choke it down!!!( my chocolate loving brother didn't care though and ate 1/4 of it ) I was like what did I do wrong??? I went back to the recipe and I saw I added half of a TABLEspoon instead of half a teaspoon, I ended up throwing almost the whole thing away!!! ADVICE : MAKE SURE YOU PUT IN THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF SALT !!! I tried it again the next day adding the right amount of salt( actually a little less ) I also waited a couple minutes for the sugar/water/butter/chocolate mix to cool so the eggs wouldn't start to cook in the mixture. The brownies didn't come out flat,like before and only needed to be cooked for 25 min. After waiting around 15 min. for them to cool, I cut them and they were a little cakey, just a little. They WERE good, I just prefer a brownie that's more fudgey. But the rest of my famiglia LOVED them. It really just depends on what kind of brownie you like.
So in conclusion:
-Add the right amount of salt in (maybe a little less)
-let the sugar/chocolate/water/butter mixture cool a little before putting the eggs in
-let the brownies cool before cutting them
And you will get a perfectly good moist cakeish brownie !!!
*** update ***
I think if you cook the brownies a little shorter, say 20 min., they will turn out more fudgy

What a easy and delicious recipe! I made homemade brownies before, and they turned out terrible. I was a little hesitate to make these, but they turned out great! They were so yummy I couldn't stop eating them when I took them out of the oven. I followed the recipe exactly and made no changes. I will make this over and over again!

This recipe is simple, easy and absolutely delicious! It can be prepped and baked in less than 45 minutes and turns out fabulous every time. Sometimes I use 1/2 peanut butter chips and half semisweet chocolate chips for luscious peanut butter brownies.

Since I didn't have any chocolate chips, I used cocoa and sugar with applesauce.  I also used white whole wheat flour.  They weren't as sweet as they would have been but we still enjoyed them.  Looking forward to using the chocolate chips, though!

It's no wonder there are so many five star reviews. 
Everyday ingredients, prepared in 10 min and all in one pot.  I ligned my pan with a foil and sprayed it with pam.  After baking, just lifted foil and Voila, done.
Fabulous chocolate taste and moist texture. I have been making brownies and such for 40years and t  this is #1 on my favorites from now on.
All I got from my husband and sons was "Oh man that's good"  As for me, well, it's my fourth piece in 15 min.
Thanks for sharing.

I thought that these were very tasty and easy to make but they were missing something...I couldn't put my finger on it but I think that they needed perhaps a little brewed coffee in them or even a few teaspoons of some sort of liquor just to really bring out the chocolate flavor. Oh, and in my oven 30 minutes was a perfect time, as they were baked just right. I will make them again soon and tweak them to see what I can do to really make them stand out.

I made these a few years ago, and the recipe didn't work for me.  I must have done something wrong because I made them again today and they turned out amazing.  These are so easy and bake up perfectly.  You have to make sure to not overbake.  There was still a little batter on the toothpick when I took these out, but after sitting at room temperature to cool and then refrigerating for several hours, they were perfect.  No hard edges, rich, fudgy, fabulous brownies.

The brownies cooked up to a nice consistency and they were super easy to make. But the taste really left something to be desired. They tasted like chocolate chips, which sounded fine to me when I read the recipe, but I feel is not the right flavor for brownies.

Wow!  Loved the flavor and texture of these!  Not too cakey, not too fudgy, these had just the right amount of chew for me.  I was a bit worried when I put the eggs in (they started to cook) but with some aggressive beating they smoothed right out.  This is a quick, easy recipe that I plan to keep!

These are good.  I had a lot of compliments on them.  The one thing I would have to say, is you have to know your oven becuase its very easy to overcook them.

My little brother (aka the pickiest eater I know) said they were the best brownies ever. The only thing I changed was substituting brown sugar for white sugar and I also added chopped walnuts to half the batter. After melting the chocolate into the sugar/ butter, I put the mixture into my kitchen aid mixer and put it on a high setting while adding the eggs so that i wouldn't wind up with scrambled eggs. S
really easy recipe!

I didn't like the taste.  Think I'll leave the vanilla out next time.  However, my kids ate half the batch straight out of the oven.

These brownies are excellent!  I prefer 'fudgy' brownies over cake like brownies and these were super fudgy just the way I like them.  I did as others mentioned by doubling the recipe and baking in a 9 x 13 glass pan.   I also used espresso in place of the water and it was just perfect!  I can't wait to make these again using a darker chocolate.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I was really dissapointed in these.  Maybe I cooked them to long.  I followed the directions to a T.  Found them rather boring and honestly dont think they are that much cheaper to make.  I may try it again and add some nutmeg and cinnamon.

Easy peasy. I told my fiancée I was going to make brownies from scratch and she seemed a little skeptical of the potential outcome. Well she loved these. I like them too. One not of caution, they came out a little gooey (which is fine) but I got a little anxious and cut them way too soon. Definitely wait until they get a chance to cool properly and they will set up nice so you can cut and serve easier.

MMMM They are the best ever and I don't care much for chocolate. I put fudge and ice cream on top. My daughter's best friend summed it up when she said your mommy makes the best brownies. I highly recommend this recipie.

too chocolatey - i might like it better with milk chocolate chips and mixed in with some cream... also, i think it needs more butter... and it was really crumbly.

These brownies were absolutely "mmmmmm".  I made them in a mini muffin tin, cooked for about 10 minutes (I might cook them for a little longer next time.  They were a little too soft in the middle).  The batter made 24 good sized brownie bites.  A bag of chocolate chips is 2 cups.  I thought more has to be better.  Next time I'll stick with the recipe.  It was hard to mix and it turned into a big fudgie ball.  After all was said and done it wasn't a problem but next time I'll just do it as it is suggested.  I found mint Hershey's kisses (for St.Patricks day).  I put one on each brownie bite.  I can't tell you how good that made them!  Tasted just like a thin mint Girl Scout cookie.  Yum!

I really enjoy these brownies - not only for the way they taste, but for the easy way they come together!  I find it amusing that so many reviewers comment that this brownie tastes like the box mixes or are better than the box mixes.  If that is all you're looking for, just use the box - you obviously don't like food that is homemade and not full of preservatives.

Just finished making these. I used the exact recipe and instructions. The brownies came out way too thin. The oil can be tasted. I baked it for 18 min. Being so thin they will go dry if you bake 20-25 min.
They did not taste good at all! Even my 3 yrs old who loves chocolate didn't eat it!
I don't see why this recipe got 4 and a half stars.

I've made lots of homemade brownies over the years and this is the best recipe ever!!  These brownies are the perfect combination of chewy and fudgy.  I also like that the recipes doesn't use much butter.   

I doubled the recipe to make a 13 x 9 pan.

W-O-W is right!! These brownies are phenomenal. Chewy and deeply chocolatey. Followed recipe exactly. Doubled it to make a 13x9 pan to bring to a family meal... then made it again in the smaller pan to keep for ourselves! Used all organic ingredients (butter, flour, eggs, chocolate).

Tastes great, part fudgy part cakey. I had no problems with the falling in the middle, they cooked up just right in 25 minutes. Made to the recipe after some discussion on the RE about the chips lumping/seizing up when added in. The sugar mix did not liquify for me by just bringing to a boil, and when the chips are added it all just lumped together. I added the eggs and and stirred till my shoulders ached and it finally smoothed out. Added dry mix in and spread in pan and baked. They do taste good! I might try microwaving the first steps the next time. Because the end result was good I'm rating it for 5 stars. Thanks for the recipe!

I was a brownies virgin until I decided to try this recipe. 
The recipe itself was SUPER easy to follow and taste was good and very fudge-like.
Also I added walnut and peacan to give something to bite. 
Repost(12/29/08)-I pour half of the original batter in the pan and spreaded peanut butter and sugar mixture on top of it and pour the leftover batter to cover the peanut butter.
It was heavenly good!!!

These brownies were absolutely delicious!  I did substitute the water for milk, and left out the salt.  I don't know why they were so good compared to other brownies, but WOW!

I am clearly the minority here, I give this recipe 3 1/2 stars, at best.  I tried this recipe despite the fact that I love the Boyfriend Brownies on this website...and I was disappointed.  I felt the taste was bland at best, and lacked luster.  I even threw in the rest of the chocolate chips to finish off the bag to add even more fudgieness.  My husband commented that these weren't as good as my usual brownies.  The Boyfriend Brownie recipe however, gets rave reviews from all of the people that I've made them for.  Sorry to be contrary to the masses, but I encourage you to try the Boyfriend Brownies.,,if you like this recipe, you will adore them.

Chewy,chocolate heaven. No changes needed. I am never looking for another brownies recipe again. Rave reviews from both my chocolate apathetic fiancee, and chocoholic roommate. I will probably put pecans or frosting on them next time just to experiment for fun, but these babies really need nothing to be superb.

This was the first time that I used this recipe and I was impressed with the outcome.  I thought it had a few more steps than my old recipe but not enough to keep me from making them.  These brownies came out moist and tasty.  They were not sweet like some other writers have said and I recommend keeping the salt in the recipe because that cuts down the sweetness from the sugar.

My son turned 21 today and asked for brownies instead of a cake. I am not much of a scratch baker but this recipe made it easy. I did pour melted chocolate frosting over the top and let it set until it and the brownies cooled. Good recipe.

I was also looking for a brownie recipe that didn't use cocoa powder (I never have any), and this was simply amazing. Better than a box mix by far, and just perfectly fudgy. Also, best name ever for brownies! I used semi-sweet with some milk chocolate chips because I doubled the recipe and didn't have enough semi-sweet.

I needed a good brownie recipe for the first layer of these peanut butter cup fudge-y brownies.  It was perfect and made these taste wonderful.  I tried my best to find a layered brownie recipe and this was the one.

WOW I will never buy boxed brownie mix again...this recipe was sooooo good!  The only addition I made was to add 1/2 cup of chips in at the end.  I did also have to cook these for an extra 10 minutes as well, but they came out perfect.  I get almost all of my recipes from this site and this is one of the best ones I have made.

This recipe makes some yummy, dense brownies. I used Ghirardelli bittersweet baking chips and the brownies came out a tad too bitter for my liking. Next time I'll use half milk chocolate and half bittersweet chips.

This recipe made pretty decent fudge.  Though I love chocolate, these were too chocolaty even for me, and went way overboard in fudge texture.  I can't imagine eating more than a 1-inch square at a time.  Maybe part of the problem was that I used high quality Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate chips, but I did follow the recipe.  If you enjoy eating mass quantities of chocolate fudge while calling it "brownies", these are for you.

I made these brownies simply because I was nearly out of butter and it didn't call for much, but as it turns out my husband says they're the best he's ever had! I myself don't care for brownies, but they're easy to make and everyone else says they're excellent! I doubled the recipe and baked it for longer and it turned out just fine. Might I also add that it was the first time I made brownies from scratch? Super simple and fun!

A definite 5 in my book--cookbook that is!  These brownies are easy and delicious.  I followed the recipe as written and did add some nuts to the top.  (My only complaint is they dried out with a couple of days...they shouldn't last that long in your house but there are only 2 of us!!!)  GREAT RECIPE which I will use again.

Forget boxed brownies. Make this one. I've been making this recipe since I discovered in July of 2011. It's all I make and whenever I make them, NONE left over! Seriously, way better than a boxed one. I do not always put frosting on but sometimes do especially when I want make them look festive by adding sprinkles or the like to the top.

These tasted really good, but they were a nightmare to cut. I "1.5 timesed" the recipe to put it in an 11x7 pan, and they rose a bit tall for the pan.

I needed a new brownie recipe to break in my new Perfect Brownie Pan. This one was a winner. I followed the recipe exact, only stirring in a cup each of peanut butter chips and semi-sweet chips. 35 minutes in the Perfect Brownie Pan and I was in business. YUM!

These were really good and I'm not usually a big fan of brownies. They have a rich chocolate flavor and are fudgy. I followed the recipe exactly and will probably be using this recipe in the future instead of a boxed mix. Try it, you won't be disappointed!

I loved these!  I was looking for a brownie recipe that didn't require cocoa powder, which I didn't have.  Followed directions exactly, the only difference was that I added a half cup of toasted hazelnuts.  These were fudgy and chewy and perfect!  I only had a glass cake pan, though, so I had to bake mine at 350 for 30 minutes, which worked out great!  I will be making this again!

I used Lindt chocolate bunnies that were left over from Easter. The brownies turned out delicious, but more cake-like than fudgy. I think I used a bit less chocolate than called for and assume that's the cause. Next time I'll measure more carefully.

SO GOOD!! Very moist and fudgy. The *perfect* brownie!! I baked for 25 minutes and it came out perfect. Couldn't stop eating. It was so easy, and I'm only twelve! My mom, who doesn't normally like chocolate, ate like half of the dish! Very good!

These were ok. They were much better the night I made them then they were afterwards. I noticed when I took them out of the oven that they were puffed up almost to the top of my pan, but after a few minutes they completely flattened out. I will keep looking for a different homemade recipe.

These brownies are incredible.  I have been searching all my cooking career for a brownie that tastes as good as a boxed one - chewy and not cake-like!  The search has ended.  Make these brownies as is, and, if you're like me, you'll find what you're looking for.  The only caution - don't overbake!  Set the timer for 5 minutes early and check.  ENJOY!

Great recipe for those who love fudgy chocolate brownies.  I loved the fact it only calls for 2 tbsp. of butter.  They're decadent, yet not too buttery or sweet.  I thought they were even better after spending a night in the fridge.  Thanks for sharing!

Brownies are not my favorite treat, but these brownies are the best I have ever had.  I doubled the recipe and it worked out great.  The only real change I made, was to the sugar, I used half white sugar and half brown sugar.  I also beat the eggs separately and added the vanilla to them, before I added them to the chocolate mixture.  All I can say is YUMMM!!!! And I will definitely make these again.

This recipe is very simple and delicious! I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9x13 glass pan and cooked them for 28 minutes. I put extra mini chocolate chips in the batter once it was completed and beat the eggs before adding them to the chocolate chips and butter. I had no problems with the eggs scrambling since I waited a couple minutes after stirring in the chocolate. I put chocolate frosting on top and they vanished! Will definitely make again!!!

I followed this recipe to a T... they smelled good and the texture was good, but as soon as I ate one... something was very wrong. Didn't taste good at all... my family tried them as well and agreed. Very bland... chocolate taste was very strange too. I did use the right chocolate as the recipe called for as I double checked. Weirdest brownies I ever tasted. Will NOT make again.

Yummmm! These brownies turned out great even with the two changes I made. I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of all purpose because thats the only flour I had, and I also used evaporated cane juice in place of the white sugar. So it made them a bit healthier and you could not tell what-so-ever that they were whole wheat. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly and baked for 25 minutes and they came out perfect! They smelled so good that I couldn't resist cutting into them, but it was cakey and fell apart. I waited until they cooled completely and by then they were fudgy, slightly chewy, with a rich chocolatey flavor and not too sweet, which I love! This will be my go-to brownie recipe from now on!

These are absolutely the best from-scratch brownie recipe I have ever made! They really do taste like boxed brownies and I have been looking for a long time for a recipe as good as the fudgey mixes. The only thing I changed in this recipe is I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet because that is all I had on hand. Next time I will try it with semi-sweet but it was still great with the milk-chocolate. Definitely a keeper!

Oh my.. I had no idea these would be go good! I made as directed.  The only difference is our family prefers dark chocolate so I used Hershey's "special dark" 50% cocoa chocolate chips.  Wow.. all the kids wanted more and more! (ages 19 months through 16 years old!).  These will definitely become a staple treat around this house! Super easy to make and ingredients you normally have in the house.

Brownies baked well but taste wise, it was not great. Think less baking soda should be used as it left an unpleasant after taste.The ratio is 1 cup flour to 1/4 tsp baking soda.

I don't know what I did wrong, but the brownies did not turn out at all.  They puffed up really high while baking, and then fell.  The center was undercooked and the rest chewy.  Maybe I added the eggs to the chocolate while it was too hot?  I will just make the box kind, it's easier and same price as buying the chocolate chips.

Wickedly delicious. Very moist and fudgy. Rich chocolate fudge flavor. These are some of the best brownies I've eaten. This would be so easy to modify using different flavors of chips too. Thanks for the fabulous recipe!

Very Good!! Did overbaked them a wee bit but it was still very good. Next time will make sure to bake within the baking hours suggested. Tips: Use high quality chocolate to get super yummy brownies. 
Will definitely make them again. Thanks for sharing the recipe :)

I made these for my hubby (who is a brownieaholic) and he took one bite and instructed me to never make brownies from scratch again, he only likes the box mix. So, I won't be making these again. They taste fine, but quite frankly, I like the box mix better too.

Sorry, I didn't think these brownies were that great. Yes, they are much better than a box mix, and they're easy. But I have been making them from scratch for a long time and have 2 better recipes than this one.

This was pretty good. And VERY easy and quick to whip up. I'm impressed. However, I  didn't think it was as "fudgey" as others described it as. I probably would have given it 5 stars if I had made these without reading the reviews because I expected it to be super rich. And it wasn't. But it was just right for me, anyway. Thanks for the recipe.

My family loved these. This is the best recipe I have tried yet. I'll definitely use these for church get togethers. I did follow the recipe exactly. Very fudgy, just like we like them.

When I saw these awesome brownie pictures I thought I just had to try them! I liked the fact that they contain chocolate chips instead of cocoa. Unfortunately I realized a little too late that I didn't have any more eggs! To save the recipe, I substituted them with 4 Tbsp powdered marzipan mix (that contained dried egg yolks)and 2 Tbsp water... They came out great, very chewy with a deep chocolate flavor. My husband thought they were "outstanding"! I, however, think I've had better. But I will try them again with eggs, and update my review if necessary :)

Awesome flavor!!  But, mine sunk in the middle also.  I doubled the recipe and used a variety of chocolate chips that I had left over from other things...

I just made these brownies and I would have to say that they are wonderful.  The only thing I did differently was when mixing in the chocolate and then the dry ingredients I found it helpful to put the saucepan over the heat off and on for just a minute so that the batter was not so thick to stir.  Other than that they are by far the best brownies I have had yet and I am not a big chocolate fan.  They were easy to make and a fast treat. :)

I will not be making these again. I had to bake for over an hour, just to get the middle to set up. It caved in the middle and ended up looking like a big bowl.

Great brownies! I think I have found my new favorite recipe. The chocolate chips added such a depth of flavor as opposed to cocoa powder. No problems whatsoever.

Not as good as the recipe I've had for over 30 years.  Way too gooey and underdone tasting. I think the chocolate chips added a taste that I didn't care for.  Brownies need to be made with baking chocolate, and where'e the nuts?

This was my first time making brownies from scratch. I found the recipe to be extremely simple to follow and super delicious. I used 1 cup of milk chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of butterscotch chips. Instead of mixing them in the pot with my water sugar butter mix, I poured the molten mixture in the bowl with my chips and melted it that way... In my haste, I forgot that I had gotten the chips straight from the freezer, so the mixture turned all nougat-y and weird. I set my bowl in some hot (nearly boiling) water and mixed until the chocolate became smooth, then I added my eggs (room temperature) one by one and followed the rest of the steps exactly (cept I also used baking powder [3/4tsp] instead of soda) as they were written. Put them in the oven for 27.5 mins, let them cool in the freezer, and voila.. Rich, moist, soft, and fudgey. Super yum... Even with a rough start.

These are great! Also, a great tip when cutting: Use a plastic knife. The squares will cut clean and you won't have crumbs sticking to the knife.

First brownies by scratch and they came out perfect! Perfect taste of chewiness, i was trying to find a recipe that used real chocolate not powder and and this one hit a home run. The top crackles perfect like brownies should and it was pretty easy! I liked how all the mixing is done in the warm saucepan so its very easy to clean up as well. Will never use a box again thank you!

Not my favorite. They tasted like I simply just melted chocolate chips and ate it. I followed the recipe and all the directions and once they came out of the oven they fell super super thin and too melty. Of course I will eat them because it is chocolate after all. . . I think if I ever tried making these again I would try adding extra flour to give them more substance.

I made the top two brownie recipes listed on this site because we had some company coming over and I had everyone vote on their favorite brownie...this one didn't get a single vote! They taste too much like semisweet chocolate chips out of the bag.

Super simple and super good!!!  So easy that I'm mad I didn't find this recipe sooner. No more box for me. I'm not really a baker, but this was too easy to mess up. My family loved them. I didn't make any changes, and didn't need to.  Will definitely make these again.

Wow, I will never make boxed brownies again!  These were wonderful. I prepared as directed, but did add 1/2 cup of chocolate chips (in addition to the 1 1/2 cups melted) and walnuts to the batter. I coated both in a little flour so they wouldn't sink.  They were amazing! They have a truly rich chocolate taste with the perfect texture. I love brownies and these are probably the best I have ever had.

BAKER BEWARE -- Super Duper Rich!  I made these to take to a luncheon.  Really no complaints with the recipe.  I used unsalted butter, and otherwise, followed the recipe to a "T."  I thought they were pretty good.  However, they were just too dense and rich for my tastes.  I cut a "normal" sized brownie (about 2.5" x 2.5"), and now I have a bellyache.  Just too rich for me.  If I made them again, I'd cut them into smaller squares.

A few notes first...
You are NOT NOT NOT supposed to do the toothpick test with these brownies. I made that mistake at 25mins in. Toothpick came out with lots of wetness n it. Baked 5 more minutes and did it again and realized that this is how these brownies are supposed to be. With SO much melted chocolate in it, it would be impossible to determine doneness by the toothpick test. 
Follow the times given in the recipe and you will have a delicious gooey rich brownie!
I will never buy box brownie mix again. these were AWESOME and would be perfect for Hot fudge cake sundae or just a plain ole scoop of vanilla ice cream. I can't praise these enough!

Wow. We didn't care for these AT ALL. They're very chewy, dull looking,  & don't have a ton of flavor....baked just until a toothpick came out mostly clean & I felt they were overcooked. Maybe That's the way they're supposed to be? I also made "Best Brownies" at the sale time & they were so much more thick, rich, & fudgey/chocolatey. Sorry :(

These brownies were, in a word, YUMMY.  I made them the other night and they turned out great!  It was my first time making brownies and for some odd reason, I thought this recipe looked hard.  It was actually super easy and involved very little clean-up.  I used the brownie frosting recipe from this site (below).  I thought that the frosting, while very tasty, overpowered the brownies.  I don't think these brownies need any frosting.  They are enough on their own.

The recipe just didn't work out for me. The chocolate chips didn't melt right. They tasted pretty good while they were still hot; a nice crispy crust and I underbaked them just a little so they would be gooey. But after they cooled, they were like rocks.

Maaaaaaaaannnnnnn THESE BROWNIES!!!!!!!!!
OK, here's my variation.  
I added 1TBSP of instant coffee to my water.  
Used S/R unbleached flour, replacing 3 TBSP of that with whole wheat flour (took some of the guilt away :-)
As sooooo as they came out of the oven, I cut a big chunk & topped it with some Blue Bell Homemade Vanilla ICE CREAM!!!!!!!!!  Happy Birthday to ME!

My son the chocoholic thought these brownies were amazing. My husband gave them an 'okay'. I thought they were good. Not great, too thick and clumpy, and most of what I could taste was just the chocolate chips, nothing else. The chocolate also seized awfully after adding it to the liquid mixture. I'll keep looking.

This recipe is now my go to recipe for brownies.   I needed to make brownies, but the recipe I have used for years calls for oil.  I had no oil so I did a search for brownies on this website.  I tried this one cause it looked easy to make. And I found out that it is also yummy!  My family loves them and a friend of mine loved them too.  I have a new keeper recipe!

These were really crumbly when they were still a bit warm. But now it's the next day and they stay together fine. Delicious, best brownie recipe I've ever made. Thank you!

I usually never write reviews but these were so incredible I felt compelled. I made these for a Mother's day party and everyone who ate them stated "best brownies ever!" I doubled the recipe and baked @ 325 in a 9"x13" metal pan for 45 minutes. I used a 24 ounce bag of chips (3 measured cups melted in as described, the rest I dumped in at the very end.) I also added 1 3/4  cups of chopped walnuts (roughly 1 1/2 cups in mix, the remainder sprinkled on top) which turned out to be a really nice touch. So simple and so delicious, I will NEVER use a mix again!

Amazing - I made them exactly as the recipe stated.  I took them out at about 28 minutes but they ended up being under done so next time I'll keep them in longer (may be my oven).  But best brownies I have ever made and my husband agrees.

These came out good. I used milk chocolate chips and white wheat flour(sifted). I made them into brownie bites(in mini muffin tin).  I wanted them to be more fudgy and moist(like the boxed version).  I will try adding corn syrup to keep them a bit more moist.  They were good and had good flavor.
UPDATE: I made half the recipe, then added corn syrup(a heaping teaspoon..? I just poured a little in the batter) and made 12 brownie bites.  The consistency was what I was looking for! Yay! :)

Not so good.  Tasted a little chalky, maybe it was my chocolate, but it was the TJ's melting chocolate which should have been good. I thought the technique was really simple, but the outcome wasn't the best.  Won't be making these again.

This has the consistency of biting into a cakey fudge. The mass amounts of chocolate chips gives a 'melt in your mouth' feeling, which is good. I'm a chewy brownie kind of girl, so this wasn't the absolute best I've ever had, but everyone else loved them.

Chocolate Heaven....I made the recipe as written and baked this as mini-muffins. It made 24 little pieces of heaven. I baked them until puffed and set for 12 minutes. I used Ghiraldelli chocolate chips which made them very rich and full of chocolate. They are so nice to grab and run. Crisp on the outside and soft in the middle. Sorry though, can't eat just one. Took these to work and they said I needed to practice making these and should make them every day for a month.  LOL

I have been searching for a "go-to" brownie recipe for the last year. (My favorite mix -Martha White Chewy Fudge- was discontinued).  I have tried so many mixes and recipes only to be disappointed in the flavor or texture.... UNTIL NOW!!!  I followed this recipe exactly and they had the perfect flavor.  (I took them out at 25 minutes exactly.)  I may try using brown sugar next time to see if I can make them just a little chewier.  I do not like cakey brownies at ALL, so I wouldn't say these were like cake... I just wouldn't mind them being just a little chewier.

So yummy...these are super decadent, super fudgy and super chocolatey!  To me, that is the perfect brownie combination.  Seriously, these are AWESOME and come together in a snap.  The only downfall...freeze them fast or you'll have none left :)

Yes, this recipe is definitely easy and yummy as-is. 
I use about 2/3 c all purpose white flour and 1/3 c whole wheat flour, about 1/2 c pecans, plus a beet that is ground up in a blender. I also test mine for done-ness by sticking a knife in it to see if it comes out clean and en up baking it for ~35 minutes. 
I gotta say that the beet is a really nice addition :)

A very rich and fudgy brownie. My husband loves them, and was surprised to learn that they were not made from a mix. I've made some brownies from scratch that don't taste like chocolate. This will be my go to brownie recipe from now on!

I use special-dark Hershey's chocolate chips and it gives it an extra rich flavor

A very good easy to make brownie. I doubled the recipe to make a 9 x 13 pan and added 1 cup of peanut butter chips. For those complaining that the recipe is too salty, either cut the amount in half or eliminate it all together and problem solved.

I have tried several different brownie recipes and by far this is the best. If you like moist, fudge like brownies this is the recipe of choice. This recipe is better than all boxed brownies! For a healthier option use splenda and sugar free chocolate chips!

This couldn't be easier, and the brownies came out beautifully.  I used whole wheat flour, and nobody noticed any difference.  Definitely about the quickest from scratch way to a chocolatey good treat!

I'm not a big dessert person, so I was a little apprehensive about making brownies from scratch for the first time, especially because I had to eyeball all the measurements. It was unbelievably easy & painless, requiring few ingredients that you wouldn't already have in your kitchen. They turned out amazingly. There's a thin crusty layer on top, soft and fudgy underneath. Best of all, people are very impressed that these are from scratch, even though they're just as easy as going the boxed route.

I would have to respectfully disagree with the reviewer who wrote that these brownies are as good as the ones out of a box; these are so so so much better! After a long day of wrangling sick fussy kids, I was in desperate need of some chocolate therapy and these brownies were just what the doctor ordered. I used a 12 oz. bag of semisweet chocolate chips and then tossed about 1/2 cup of milk chocolate chips in with the flour. These brownies are like little bites of fudge. I had to give half of them away so I wouldn't eat them all.

I just got done making these brownies and they've cooled down enough for me to taste them...they are FABULOUS!!

The chocolatey-ness of them is so rich and decadent...it is very moist and delicious, I added walnuts to mine and baked it in a 9 inch round pan for 30 minutes and they came out perfect. Way better than any box mix and literally with only 5 minutes more prep time...amazing brownies!

If you like melt in your mouth, fudgy brownies then this is by far the best recipe you will find! I will say that once they're done baking you have to have a little bit of patience, though. I wanted to cut them up and eat them after 5 minutes, but they need MUCH more time to cool down. I'd say give them at least 30 minutes to cool down before trying to cut them up. Otherwise they will just fall apart on you. Either way, they're delicious!

This recipe is perfect!  I've been looking for a homemade, from-scratch brownie recipe for years and they always turned out gritty or too dense like fudge.  These were perfect, moist, chocolately & delicious!  Better than any box mix and super easy.  Thank you for the awesome recipe that I will use for making brownies from now on!

Awesome recipe!  I tweaked it a little bit by replacing the butter with apple sauce and halving the amount of eggs.  Turned out really yummy and fudgy.

Seriously the easiest and best brownie recipe i have ever made! They are somewhere between brownies and fudge.  I like my brownies chewy and nearly raw, these are mouth watering.  They don't need frosting or anything fancy, i just dust mine with a little powdered sugar and they are ready to serve. Mmmm mmmm great!!

I made these exactly as written. I was expecting an over-the-top brownie with the high ratings that this recipe has. The texture is great, but they are way too salty for us. I will not be making this recipe again.

These are the best brownies I have ever had! Ooey and gooey without being store bought!! The crispy edges and top are my favourite part. Will definitely use this recipe for many many things! (used them to make peppermint white chocolate coated brownie pops!)

Awsome and easy to make, I made half with walnuts and the other half without and thought it better with the walnuts takes a little of the richness out of it.

LOVED that you basically mix all the ingredients in the pan! I would omit salt completely ( too salty for our taste) or use less than 1/2 tsp. I agree with others, dark/bittersweet chocolate is not best to add in my opinion. Semisweet worked great. I also added a couple tablespoons of cocoa, and tablespoon Agave  Great recipe all in all!

I saved this recipe years ago, but never made it and I am so sorry I waited.  I used dark chocolate chips and then followed the recipe as written.  The recipe amounts are perfect and the brownies are dense, rich and decadent.  The next time I may substitute brewed coffee for the water or add 1 tbs instant coffee, simply because I like the way it enhances chocolate, although it isn't really necessary.  TY Cicada!

I have made these several times over the past few years and they never disappoint. My practice is to always use the exact recipe at least once before making my own changes, and these are soooooo good as written that the five star rating is for this recipe not my changes:) 
However with that said, I now use dark chocolate chips for a kick-in-the-face good brownie - half topped with walnuts for hubby, and half without for myself.

So good!!  I had only 1 cup of chocolate chips so I substituted 1/4 cup of coca powder for the the 1/2 cup of chocolate chips I was missing and I increased sugar to 3/4 cup.  Other than that I followed the recipe and they were fantastic.  Moist and a little chewy.  Oh I sprinkled some shredded coconut on top before baking it.  Great with vanilla ice cream.

These brownies are extremely good! When baked as directed, the bottom feels spongy and crunchy, and the top is a little crunchy as well-- plus, the middle is cake-like and delicious! I love the texture and flavor-- I also added a little more than 1/8 cup of Irish Cream Liqueur to the recipe as directed by another recipe. It gives it a very slight uniqueness and I highly recommend adding some! Thanks for the recipe, definitely a keeper c: ~Bae

I have always used a certain brand mix and embellished it with extra chocolate chips because I truly thought they were better than homemade.  Boy, was I wrong.  I found this recipe last week and my 3rd batch is currently in the oven right now.  So quick and easy and makes a wonderful brownie.  Thanks so much for this one, it is now my go-to recipe.

Not that impressed.  It wasn't bad, but it tasted more like less sweet cake.  It wasn't dense or chewy, but it had a decent chocolate flavor.  I won't make these again, as the boxed varieties taste better and are easier to prepare.

I am gluten free and always looking for good recipes that can be converted easily.  These turned out delicious and my whole family loved them!  Imade these very quickly, but instead of all-purpose flour, I used the Bisquick gluten free baking mix.  I also used dark chocolate chips because I prefer dark chocolate.  Very good and rich tasting, without being so sweet- yeah!

This is now my 'go to' brownie recipe!  Turned out perfect in every way.  I did substitute the ap flour with whole wheat pastry flour, added an extra 1/2 tsp baking soda, and an extra 1/2 tsp vanilla.  Also, for depth of flavor, added 1 T. of instant Espresso coffee (or instant coffee crystals).  Also, added 1 c. of chopped walnuts.
 I also greased the pan with coconut oil.  These brownies are the BEST I've ever had.

I followed the recipe exactly. Super easy and super chocolately! Yum! I put the leftover 1/2 cup of chocolate chips on top. Way better than boxed brownies. I will definitely make this again.

I was so hoping these would be the fudgy brownies I was craving, but they turned out to be like a chocolate cake for me.  While the flavor was good (c'mon, it's chocolate!) I'll choose another recipe for my next brownie fix.  3 stars for an easy recipe!

This was THE best brownies that I've ever had, it was delicious and gone is exactly 3 minutes. I didn't follow the recipe exactly because I substituted butter for margarine and only added about half a cup of chocolate chips, but it was dee-licious!!!

These were great tasting, however I was disappointed that they were more cake like rather than fudge like.  If you like a cake like brownie this is the recipe for you!!

I live in South Korea, so I have very limited options when it comes to baking unless I order things online.  I was able to find everything in this recipe here, so I gave it a try.  However, because Koreans aren't big on baking, I have only a toaster oven.  The cooking time was a LOT longer in a toaster oven.  Also, I had to use the only chocolate I could find, but the taste seems okay.  I also had to use I Can't Believe It's Not Butter and a tinfoil baking pan.
Overall, I liked them a lot.  They were very comparable to a mix, and very very simple.  If you have to make due with what you have when things are very limited, I would suggest these!

MMMM is right! I am pregnant and 1 week away from my due date and I wanted a brownie so badly last night but was shocked to find I had NO MIX!!! I ALWAYS keep mix on hand! So naturally, I came to my goto website when I'm in a pickle :D Needless to say, I will no longer be using mix, this is even better! These sure passed the test of this VERY pregnant woman and that should tell you everything you need to know about this gem!!! **NOTE: I did not have any SEMI sweet chips on hand, all I had was milk choc. chips and they worked out beautifully, next time I will make them with the semi sweets and see if it makes a big difference.

These brownies were not only quick and easy to prepare, but fun to bake! Thou I am not a chocolate, fudge kind of person I wanted to make this for my family as a special treat. Once the melted chocolate chips were cooled, I mixed in the eggs and vanilla, then the  flour mixture. I also added an extra 1/2 cup of chocolate chips that I lightly dusted with flour to help them stay afloat in the brownies. I sprayed the 8X8 pan with PAM then I baked these at 325 degrees for approximately 25 minutes, and took them out to cool. I wanted these to be a nice, rich, fudgy brownie. I also wanted to decorate these with frosting - and a big thanks to Naples34102 for mentioning, "Brownie Frosting." The results? Family says, "Mmmm...so ONO (delicious)." I was told the brownies were delicious, moist chocolately, rich and they liked the bits of chocolate chips in the brownies.

I didn't care for these at all!  Not sure why - but the recipe doesn't have near as much butter as you usually find in a brownie recipe.  I should have stuck to my tried & true brownie recipe.

I just used this as I'd misplaced my own old recipe, so I didn't know what to expect.  AMAZING.  Is pretty much all I can say.  I forgot to adjust the oven temperature for the fan oven so it was still gooey inside when the outside was almost back, but it was still fantastic!  I don't think I need to keep looking for a recipe any more...

The best brownies I have ever had!!  So easy to make - the only modifications I had were to use 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar (instead of 1/2 cup white) and just a tad less salt.  They turned out WONDERFUL and everyone I have shared them with thinks they are yummy!  I will never buy a box again!

These are SOOOO good! I prefer fudgy brownies over cake-like ones, so these are right up my alley. I've made them twice now, doubling the recipe and baking them in a 9x13 pan. This recipe is so much easier than my usual homemade brownie recipe, but tastes just as good, if not better. I think my oven was running hotter than the set temperature the first time I made them, and the brownies puffed up all around the edges but stayed sunken in the center. They still tasted great, but the next time I used an oven thermometer and adjusted the oven temp so it read correctly and the result was much better.

These brownies are delicious!
I have several allergies so I made mine with Olive Oil (1.5 Tbs) instead of butter, and used soy-free chocolate chips. MMMMM is right, they only lasted three days. My only complaint is that they were VERY soft. Maybe I took them out too early? I'll cook them for 27  or 28 minutes next time.

I doubled the recipe & used a total of 1/2 cup of butter.  I only had 1 pkg. of chocolate chips so used a total of 2 cups of chocolate chips. Since I was short on the chocolate chips I added 1/2 cup cocoa. They are more cakey than fudgey & 100% delicious! YUM!

I'm not sure if I reviewed this recipe before but I just had to come and rave about it again! I've made this with very high quality chocolate and this brownie tasted like gooey, chocolatey HEAVEN. It has a fantastic consistency and it literally took me 5 minutes to whip up. This recipe is super quick and delicious. I love it!

I have made these brownies several times and my family can hardly wait for them to cool down before they devour them.  This is a very easy recipe to follow and the brownies taste absolutely delicious.  They are always a hit and I will definitely be using this recipe for many years to come.

MMMMmmmmm is right...a perfect brownie recipe
that I will definately use from now on. This recipe
works plain or jazzed up with extra chocolate chunks, walnuts or flavorings. The 8X8 pan yielded
9 large beauties. Loved the good old homemade
taste of these. Many thanks for sharing.

Much, much better than Brooke's Bombshell brownies.  used mini semi-sweet chips, and added the rest of the beg unmelted into the mix.  Very good, but still looking for the perfect recipe.  This is the front runner for now, however.

Yummy! I made these to take to work along with banana bread muffins (Janine's) and the staff loved them. They were perfectly fudgy, without feeling undercooked. I also added half a cup of chips to the batter before baking.

These brownies were easy to make and very good :) they were a little dry but a la mode they were perfect. If your looking for the classic brownie this isnt your best bet. This brownie has a cake like taste/texture. Not traditionall but my family finished off half of it in one night. Next time ill double it. (:

I had never cooked brownies from scratch before.  I made these last night for a party and everyone loved them.  Friends said they were the best brownies they had ever eaten.  When the brownies were in the oven and had about 10 minutes left to go, I put semisweet chocolate chunks on top and let them melt in.  Soooo good.  I will definitely be making these again.  They were delicious!!

Yummm! Way better than the box! Sweet and chewy brownie!  I used 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips and 1 cup semisweet. Canola oil instead of butter. 1/2 cup crushed walnuts.  I didn't add icing as it is sweet enough as is.

These were very good and had all the qualities that make a good brownie GOOD...soft, fudgy, flaky on the top, and a little chewy on the edges. I followed the recipe exactly except I doubled it and put it in a glass 9x13 pan. I baked it for 35 minutes.

Never tried making brownies from scratch before, but this was VERY easy!!  I doubled the recipe, but didn't have a 9x13 pan clean for it.  Ended up using something a little smaller, so the brownies turned out a cross between brownies and cake.  When I make this again, I will make sure I use the correct pan.

I don't know what I did wrong but these didn't even set. There was a top crust but they were never baked on the inside. I was left with batter underneath it. IF I try this again I'll have to add more flour I guess.

I have to agree with everyone else.  These are the best home-made brownies I've ever had.  I've always been partial to the box brownies, until I made these.  I think it was the chocolate chips that made all the difference.  So much better than cocoa powder!  My only suggestion would be to use a scant 1/2 tsp, as the full amount made them a bit too salty for my taste.  But overall a 5 star recipe!!

Needed a recipe w/o oil and this one was perfect. I layered carmel & pecans in the center - from another recipe on this site. They were chewy & gewy and gone in minutes. My family & relatives said they were the best!

anxiously waiting for the brownies to bake, cool and be cut up so I can devour them.  Loved the ease of this recipe, esp after I made it easier on myself (and my 7 y/o) by nuking the butter, water, sugar and chocolate step instead of using the stove.  Just microwaved the butter, water, and sugar for 1 min (or however long it takes to get water hot in your micro) then dump chocolate chips  in, stir and nuke for 30 sec intervals and stir until melted and smooth.  Also loved that this recipe didn't use a dozen eggs and an entire stick and a half of butter.  Good grief, I want a brownie, not another love handle and a splitting headache.  Thanks cicada77.  So far, so good.

Yum! Realized I was low on butter this morning and was so glad to find this recipe since I wanted to take brownies on a picnic with the kids and they turned out great! Hubs was still asleep when I made them and he swore they were from a box mix! Made these as stated. Will make again and maybe play with some peanut butter chips next time.

this is now my go-to brownie recipe. it's super easy, and delicious! they taste just like the store-bought two bite brownies. for a crackly crust, beat the mixture well after the eggs are added.

Before baking these brownies I read some of the 5 star ratings as well as the 1, 2, and no stars.  Those who did not rate this recipe highly talked of cakiness, bland flavor, or the batter sinking in the oven. I used Nestle toll house morsels and followed the directions and am now eating fudgy, chocolatey brownies that are not cake-like at all and have great texture. I can only guess that those who did not like the recipe either used poor quality ingredients, generic chips, or perhaps they were at a higher altitude?  These are the best homemade brownies I have ever made and I have tried more than a few!

I always have trouble with brownies, but not these! This was a great recipe. I love the flakey top that this recipe makes. I added another tbsp of butter to the chocolate mixture simply because it seemed to need it. I took my 1 1/2 cup chips from a 12oz pack, and next time I'll just throw the whole bag in for extra chocolate taste. Also I will reduce the salt next time.

These cookies were fabulous!  I baked for 30 mins and they came out very moist.  I mixed the eggs and vanilla in a separate bowl, then added the brownie mixture from the saucepan to the bowl.  I also added the flour, baking soda and salt in the bowl with some walnuts.  The steps were simple, a bit more cleanup for me, but I think it was worth it.   I know I'll be making these in the future. Thanks.

This is by far the best brownie I have ever had! I only had a cup of chocolate chips so I substituted with baking chocolate, it came out great. I also added walnuts. I will definitely experiment with this one. Thanks!

These were pretty good. I'm still looking for "the one" brownie recipe but I did like these. I added a Tbs. instant coffee (dissolved in the water-heated the water) for a coffee flavor.

These really are wonderful brownies. The batter is super tasty =) I tried to sample a warm brownie, fresh out of the oven and I was so nervous they weren't baked long enough and they weren't going to taste very good. Patience, fellow brownie lovers! It will pay off! They are perfectly fudgie and so tasty! Give them an hour to cool and you'll be devouring them!

Followed the recipe the the letter, if I was blinded, I could easily have believed they were crispy bites of cake. I baked them in a 9x9 glass pan. They fell big time in the middle, leaving me with a very thin chewy cake, and an outside that was as hard as a rock. Very little chocolate taste, and I had read other reviews and used milk chocolate chips. They were hard to mix at first, but eventually they came together and the batter was very easy to work with. Once they cooled, they were hard as a rock. Sorry, but i will have to keep on looking. Thanks anyhow.

These brownies tasted exactly like boxed brownies - flaky on the top and super fudgy on the inside. This is the recipe I've been looking for! I only baked mine for 22 or 23 minutes (doubled the recipe in a 9x13 metal pan), and they were perfect.

These were amazing!! I followed the recipe exactly except I used Nestle Swirlz chips, which are half white chocolate half semi-sweet, and I think I used just a little too much baking soda because they puffed up pretty big. SOOOOOOO good though, I will definitely make these again and again!! :D

This is my brownie recipe now! Made a double batch and took it to a church function. As suggested by other reviewers, I throw some extra chocolate chips on top.

I have made these about 100 times.  They are sooo good everytime.  I feel like the cook time is not long enough in the recipe.  The middle does not get done in that time so I add 10-15 minutes, but watch it, and it is fine.

Since everyone was ranting and raving about these brownies, I thought I had to try them. My grandma and mom made everything always from scratch, never ever from a box. Many people mentioned boxed brownies in their reviews. These are ok, but not the best. My grandma's are the best. I should have known anything that people said tasted like boxed brownies wouldn't come out so good.

wonderful!!  I have made brownies from scratch for many years but this recipe is by far the best and easiest of all;  perfect the way it is - no changes needed.  Not a better tasting brownie out there!  I doubled the recipe the 2nd time and put in a 11x7 pan - cooked for about 37 minutes which made for a really thick brownie.  Believe me when I say a single recipe is not enough!!  Some reviewers mentioned the thick batter being hard to stir - I think this is from letting the water/sugar/butter mixture simmer too long causing some of the liquid to evaporate - when this happens just add another tablespoon of butter or two  to the mixture before adding the eggs and dry ingredients.   Our family likes their brownies frosted - so while the brownies are still warm I put a thick layer of good old fashioned chocolate frosting on - this way it kinda melts into the brownies and makes them even better.  Also want to mention there is a similar named brownie on this site so don't be confused - just copy this one to your recipe box. You won't want to lose this recipe.

Fantastic brownies! My kids absolutely loved them. The only thing I didn't like about these was that they were very thin. I used an 8x8 baking pan, and they were still only about 3/4" thick. I may double the recipe next time and see if that does the trick.

I am not a brownie person.  Past tense!  I am now a brownie person!  These are incredible brownies-not cakey, yet not dense like fudge.  Moist, not sugary-sweet-they are the perfect brownie!  I will not be making these much though, as I would eat the whole pan in one sitting!!  You won't be dissapointed.  I followed the directions exactly, no subs or "fixes", it is perfect as is.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

These brownies were fudgy and gooey with a flaky crust on top.  They were the closest to Betty Crocker's style brownies out of the other recipes I tried.  It's definitely my favourite recipe now.

These were pretty good, but not the best. Even though they are moist, they are not as chewy as I would like. They were extremely heavy and dense, which makes you soooo constantly thirsty aterwards, no matter how much you drink!! I loved the taste, but a little too heavy and stick to the roof of your mouth cuz they're so dense. All in all, nice and chocolatey, and perfect if you like thick and dense! thanks!...UPDATE: 
Made these again, using the right kind of chocolate and this does a world of a difference!! I had used 70% cocoa the first time, and the consistency was extremely heavy, and so different when using the semi-sweet chocolate chips!! Even though they seem underdone after the amount of time written, make sure to not over cook. I added about 10 minutes to it, and still felt ndercooked, but I took them out anyway. After cooling, you realize that they are perfect that way, so chewy and delicious! My guests couldn't believe how good these were, and asked for the recipe!! I did put a layer of chocolate bar (such as caramilk) in between two layers of dough, which made these extra special!!

Using semi-sweet chips is key! I tried dark chocolate and it just didn't come out the same. For even extra richness I made some peanut butter topping by putting about 1/2 c. into a bowl and microwaving until soft and pliable. I then added 2 tbsp. of powdered sugar, for texture after done baking. SOOOO good and rich and moist and and and.... You will definitely need a cup of milk for those.

This is the first "from-scratch" brownie recipe I've tried.  Personally, I'm not a brownie person, but my boyfriend absolutely is - and these got his vote of approval.  He said they were exactly how he likes them - chewy and dense on the inside with a flaky crust.

I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used a 9x13 pan instead of an 8x8 pan, and it was perfect! They rose SO much in the oven, I was shocked!  Definitely a keeper.

This is the best home-made browie I've ever made!!  It was so moist and delicious I ate almost the whole thing myself (kinda embarassing!)  I made it exactly as the recipe called except that I had a bar of dark chocolate and I broke off some pieces and mixed it in with the flour mixture.  Crispy on the edges and gooey in the center...mmmmm!!

These brownies were okay. I would not make them again. They were too cakey for me, I like more fudge-like brownies. And I didn't think they were sweet enough either.

If I could, I would give this 10 stars!!! I've made these several times and each time they've been fabulous! The past couple of times I substituted coffee for the water and it really brings out the flavor of the chocolate. You must try it. MMMMMM... is right! Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is simply great! I don't see how you could go wrong! It is so simple & so delicious!!! If you only try one recipe on this site, this should be the one. I prepared the brownies exactly as written, baking them for only 25 minutes in a glass pan. They did appear a bit cakey at first, however, after cooling they were perfect -even better the next day! Gone are the days of "gritty" boxed brownies! Thanks for the recipe! (...To the critics that stated that these were not sweet enough, I attempted to use milk chocolate chips to enhance the sweetness, and it was NOT successful!!!!) Yummy AS IS!!!

This recipe is fantastic!!  I've made them twice now, and they are seriously the best brownies I have ever had.  The first time I used whole grain pastry flour, doubled the vanilla, and did everything else the by the recipe.  The second time I used regular whole wheat flour, doubled the vanilla and used half of the salt.  I think that 1/2 a tsp is more than necessary.  They raised just fine, and were fabulous both times, but better the second.  Oh yeah, and these were meant to be made with walnuts.  I did some with and some without, and the ones with were perfect!  I don't mix the walnuts in the batter, I just sprinkle them (liberally) on top, and lightly press them into the batter.  You want them to be sticking out so that they get roasted.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!!

These had the signature brownie top layer, which is awesome. However, the edges were crispy while the rest was soupy. And it sunk in the middle, like other reviewers have said.  I think I'll keep searching.

I did not care for these. Perhaps it was the ingredients. Perhaps it was my bad luck baking. Either way, u should know!

I used white chocolate chips instead and they are rich and tasty. I will  be making more flavors I am sure.

I thought I did something wrong, because these weren't that good. They weren't bad, but after reading all the reviews I was expecting amazing. I read and re-read all the directions and I did it right. I think I may add some more chocolate chips than called for next time.
  I am willing to give it another shot...

These were delicious, i followed the recipe exactly, they were very easy to make, they were good and fudgy, some other brownie recipes on this site are more like cake, if i wanted to make a cake i would make one! but these were perfect, my husband raved about them. thank you for the recipe!

I am a huge brownie from the box fan...these are very good, but not quite as good as from a box, though close.  I think they would be better with chocolate chips mixed in before baking. They cooked perfectly, just need a bit more flavor for me.

this is truly a wonderful brownie recipe-i've been using one very very close to this one for years, and ALWAYS get rave reviews about 'em.  the only difference in my recipe is, that you only put half the chocolate chips into the sugar/butter/water after boiling along with the vanilla; then after you've stirred&gotten the chips melted smooth, added the eggs(one at a time)and the flour mixture, put in the rest of the chips&can add nuts too, if desired. this makes the chips sort of "stand alone" during&after the baking process. you get yummy munches of chocolate chips when you're eating brownie!  :) excellent recipe.

We've been making these for a few weeks now and I will never go back to box. We doubled the recipe and added a 24 oz. bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips. It is about a cup more than needed but well worth it. Buttered a 9x13 pan and baked for the same amount of time. They always come out with the top flakey with just a tad of crisp. There's no hard, over baked sides with these brownies either. Just moist and fudgy. perfect for that tie you over snack. Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic and easy! Only thing is, I think I would use a TOUCH less salt next time. The brownie had a bit of a salty bite on it.

This was a very good recipe, and so far as close to a box mix that I have found but I thought that it tasted to chocolate chippy for me. I will make it again and maybe add some nuts to it.

I made the recipe in a 9x9" pan. I sprinkled crushed peanuts on the top layer of the batter before putting it in the oven. I baked it for 30min at 325deg and they came out looking absolutely wonderful and they tasted and smelled moist and delicious. I must admit though, these brownies are a little cakey. They're a mix between cake and brownie. Although they're tasty, I was looking for a more dense, rich, chewy brownie. I may make this recipe again in the future because of its simplicity, but I will still be looking for the perfect brownie recipe.

I love brownies, but I am very picky. I don't love all brownies.  In fact I haven't found a brownie I like better than a Betty Crocker mix, I will say these are a close second.  Instead of water I used Bailey's and I halved the recipe. I will make these again.

We really enjoyed these brownies. I added some walnuts to the mix and a spoon of peanut butter before baking. This is probably my new favorite recipe for brownies. I will make these again. Thanks for sharing...

This was just okay. Tasted like a boxed brownie mix, which isn't bad, but not what I'm going for if I'm taking the time to make brownies from scratch. Maybe adding some cinnamon or instant coffee or some other flavoring would help kick it up a notch.

This is AMAZING and so easy to make! I love this recipe because the brownies are so fudgy and dense, the best texture I think brownies should have. The flavour is rich and deep too! Everyone LOVES this recipe. One thing I would recommend is that when you are adding the eggs to the chocolate-sugar-butter mixture, you should let the chocolate mixture cool down slightly before adding the eggs, so they don’t cook. My first time making them, I didn’t wait, and the eggs actually cooked and I found bits of scrambled, cooked egg in my brownie! We still liked them though. This recipe is amazing!!

Simple and great. I cooked this once as the recipe says in the 8x8 dish. I let it cook for forty minutes though and they turned out great. I doubled everything in the recipe and cooked it for an hour and twenty minutes in a 9x13. They are just as good as the first batch. Also I didn't have semisweet chocolate chips so I used milk chocolate chips. Make sure to get your batter as smooth as possible.

these are incredible!  so moist and they don't need icing at all.  (although are delicious with icing too).
I'm normally not a fan of brownies because they tend to be too dry and cake-y.  these are a perfect balance between fudge-y and cake-y.  best eaten warm, and I like mine with walnuts (although my family prefers them without).

These brownies actually made me sign up on this website just to review! I no longer buy brownie mix thanks to this receipe. I now always make sure we have chocolate chips on hand for when our sweet tooth kicks in! follow the receipe to the T and you will never look back! (Although extra chocolate is never a bad thing!)

LOVE IT.  The top is nice and flaky, it has the moist texture but isn't airy or spongey like a cake as long as you don't over bake.  One alteration I made was that I left out 1/4 cups of the chocolate chips and added it last after the flour mixture.  This way, when you bite into it, you can still taste bits of the chocolate whether it's still warm or cooled, which makes it extra interesting.

more like a chocolate cake rather than a brownie  as a chocolate cake it was pretty good. I may have done something wrong but it was not moist like a brownie.

I loved them! I didn't realize how easy homemade brownies are ! I was concerned about the batter after the chocolate chips because it wasn't that smooth ... But I just used a wisk to blend in the eggs and this chunky chocolate.. The result was awesome anyways so no need to worry if you have same issue

amazing brownies, good recipe for those who like their brownies salty. If you don't, it's ok to lower the amount of salt you use in this recipe.

I replaced the water here with butter. (I used 4 Tbs of butter total). I also used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. These were beyond amazing, way better than a box!

This recipe is fantastic! I didn't have chocolate chips so I used dark chocolate that I had in my pantry (about 8oz.). The brownies came out perfect and my family loved them. Next time I'm going to have to make a bigger batch! I highly recommend trying this recipe??

Oh my goodness - definitely the best brownies I've ever had! I also used a round 9" pan, added chocolate chips to the cooled mixture before baking, and cooked them a bit longer! This is my go to brownie recipe now -and it's really simple.

This is a great brownie recipe I just jazzed it up with a cream cheese swirl (3oz cream cheese 1/4 cup sugar and 1 egg mixed till smooth then spooned on top of brownies and gently swirled around before they were baked) and then dusted some crushed dehydrated raspberries when they were all done.

I followed everything exactly as written, but the extra chocolate chips were stirred into the prepared batter right before baking. These were some of the BEST brownies I've ever made. No more boxed brownies!

This recipe is amazing! I have no complaints, how ever, make SURE that you add the salt in with the rest of the dry ingredients or they will turn out salty. If you like sweet and salty though, go ahead.

I used Ghiradelli chocolate chips for this recipe.  Husband did not think that I could make from scratch brownies as good as a boxed mix but he was wrong! These tasted so amazing and he said that they were BETTER than boxed brownies and, in fact the best he's ever had.  That really says a lot considering that he is from the South where his mama made everything from scratch, including brownies.  So...I'm making them again, for the second time in a week...lol

These were O.K. they weren't my favorite... they didn't really have any taste. I would suggest to put icing on them or something else to make them sweeter.

I truly did not like this at all.  I followed the recipe and also the suggestions of other readers of changing to 8x8 pan, 29 minute cook time and the butter suggestion and I thought it came out far too bland. I will never make this again.

This recipe was really easy.  First time I undercooked it and it was very fudgey - but delicious (though hard to cut nicely!).  Second time I overcooked a little bit and it was still very good, though I think would have been perfect if cooking time had been right.  Agree with others that this is better not to overbake.

Made this recipe and as suggested by others, did a couple modifications to the recipe.  I tempered the eggs into the chocolate mixture and added 1/2 cup choc chips (mix in 1 tbsp. flour) to the batter before baking.  I made the mistake of doubling the recipe and the brownies didn't bake as well as I had hoped for.  Next time I won't double the recipe and make them in 2 separate baking dishes.  Delicious overall and top them with chocolate fudge frosting.  YUM!!

I made these for my husband this past weekend.  He considers himself somewhat of a brownie connoisseur.  I made the recipe exactly as stated but did add some chopped walnuts and they turned out perfect!  Moist, fudgy, and oh so rich.  My husband raved about these brownies.  I will never buy another box mix again.  Cicada77 thank you for the wonderful recipe!

This was my first attempt at homemade brownies. Holy Smokes these are awesome!!  I doubled the recipe, baked in a 13x9 glass pan, and cooked for about 10 additional minutes. We will definitely make these again amd again.

This recipe is the easiest to make.  IF you want to try and make them a little healthier.... here are some tricks:
Use whole wheat flour (I did 1/2 and 1/2).
Throw in some wheat germ.
Use really dark chocolate

I received so many compliments.  Thank you!!!

These are THE BEST brownies... EVERRRR! For real. We did exactly what the recipe called for. We did use a user suggestion to have the eggs at room temperature. So I just sat the eggs out for about an hour before I started. Wow. One suggestion I do have... double the recipe. These go quickly and you will wish you had more. You can put any leftovers you cant finish in the freezer. Just take them out and thaw them and you can zap them in the microwave or oven for a few minutes (seconds if in micro) and it will taste just as great. I cannot wait to bring these tasty treats to dinner parties and get-togethers! Thanks for the recipe!

I added an indeterminate amount of walnuts to the batter and on top just prior to baking. Also, I hand stirred with a whisk, adding the eggs one at a time. If you're baking in a darker pan, either lower the temperature 25 degrees, or bake for less time. These are amazing, and very chocolatey.

Perfect brownies! Just perfect! One tip- make sure you let the water mixture cool for a minute or so or you will burn the chocolate like I did the first time!

It took me so long to find a brownie recipe that wasn't cake like. These were perfect. I did double the recipe for my 9x13 pan and baked them for 30 minutes on 325 degrees.  I also tossed some mini m&ms in a couple tablespoons of flour and added them to the mixture for some extra flavor.  I also made a homemade frosting, recipe is 1 stick of softened butter, beat on low speed for 30 seconds to 1 minute, add 3 or 4 cups of powdered sugar, 1 tablespoon of vanilla and 3 or 4 tablespoons of milk.  If you want a thicker frosting add a little more powdered sugar and if you want it thinner then add a little more milk, and if you want more flavor then add a touch more vanilla.

The brownie turned out nice however I didn't like the method. My chocolate seized when I added to the butter/sugar/water mixture. I continued with the recipe as normal and it didn't hinder the end result. I cooked for about 23 minutes. The top was slightly crispy and the inside was gooey. Tasted great but I think I'll use an easier recipe next time.

As a sweet something after super, this is ok BUT as a brownie? Not good at all. This has more of a cakey texture than an actual brownie texture. Also, it's not very fudgie at all like you would expect from a brownie. I am highly disappointed.

Have any of you watched Gilmore Girls? So there's this one scene in Season 2 when Luke brings Lorelai a batch of brownies that he messed up by adding three times the amount of chocolate. That's kind of what I feel like I just baked. These brownies are literally chocolate bombs - super rich and super dense. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed them, but one small one made me feel like I was about to explode.

Delicious!  Just what I was looking for, the only problem is it's not enough!  Definitely need to double the recipe, these were gone in our house in one day.  We are trying to eat as GMO free as possible and therefore not buying processed snacks & desserts.  Making my own desserts with (mostly) organic ingredients and these were perfect.  They did have a slightly salty taste, which I actually loved.  It may be due to the fact that I didn't have quite enough choc chips, had about 1.25 c instead of 1.5.  I will see how they come out when I make with the 1.5 c next and decide which I like best, but will definitely be making again, the consistency was between cakey and chewy, just perfect.  May also like to try with nuts. I also used salted butter, so may cut out the added salt also.

My word these really are so yummy... I doubled the amount as I was taking them to a friends birthday however my family tested them and nearly ate them all so I have had to make another batch... I almost followed the recipe given but added double the vanilla as I make my own which is lovely. I also added 200g of chopped Pecan nuts and the chocolate I used was half milk and half plain plus 2 tablespoons of coco powder. I took the butter, sugar and water off the heat and left to cool for 5 minutes then added the chocolate to melt before adding the egg and vanilla. Turned out moist with a soft chewy center. Will 100% be making them again as they were a hit with everyone. Easy to make just don't over mix or they will turn out spongy. Don't over cook either or will go hard and dry.. I only left them in the oven for 25 mins and were ready..Also if you can wait that long leave them to cool in the tray for as long as possible which keeps them moist. Satisfaction all round... Thanks for a lovely recipe Nicola

These were O.K. but not great. I made 4 different brownie recipes last night, 2 from this site and 2 from another, and these were not in the top 2. The one called "Brooke's Best Bombshell Brownies" and one from another site tied for first place.

These are amazing!!  I have made these a couple times and will never buy boxed brownie mix again.  When I first made them, I followed the recipe as written and it was not chocolaty enough and too salty (unless you're going for something sweet and salty).
Now when i make these I cut the salt in half, use a whole bag of semi-sweet Ghiradelli chocolate chips and add 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and they are amazing!  I find the better brand chocolate chips (ghiradelli vs the store brand) make the brownies taste better too!

This is a very good brownie recipe.  Tastes so much like the chocolatyness of box brownies.  I am impressed and added this to my recipes. I followed the recipe exactly and the brownies came out great.

I have used this recipe for a while now and love it.  I just used this recipe to make a gluten free brownie and they turned out great! I simply substituted 2/3 cup all purpose gluten free flour (I have Jules) and kept everything else the same.  Gluten eaters and gluten freers loved them just the same.  I liked them even more the next day after refrigerating them.

1,000,000,000 times wonderful and simple! I made these again yesterday for Father's Day. I doubled the recipe and added 2 T. of instant espresso to the flour mixture-- chocolate fudgy heaven. I then baked them in a 13" x 9" pan for 40 minutes. They were absolute perfection. I am a professional pastry chef. This is my go to brownie recipe.

Very tasty and easy! However I didn't think these were that much better than box brownies. More expensive than a box, as the chips I used were quality, but my kids don't appreciate the difference.

These are the best!!! Everyone's always loved my brownies which were just out of the box. I came apon the recipe and seemed easy enough to make and now im able to say that I make my brownies homemade. These a great, just enough chocolate and same moist taste. Will never use box mix again. These are my go to dessert. I followed recipe but just half the salt.

THIS IS EASY TO PREPARE, BUT SEEMS TO BE MISSING SOMETHING. i will not bother making again I feel this did not live up to all good reviews.

Good homemade brownies, but I wouldn't go as far as saying they're the best I've ever eaten. I did like that they were quick and easy, and I had all of the ingredients handy when I just wanted a little something to satisfy a chocolate craving. I followed the recipe exactly as written and they're a bit thick for me. Next time I'll try a 9x9 pan instead.

Taste like the butterscotch brownies I had when I was growing up. I made exactly like the recipe and wouldn't change a thing. :-)

Wow! Always make a recipe exactly as written before "tweaking" to fit our taste buds, but this doesn't need any tweaking.  Was a little worried at first due to the thickness of batter, but the brownies came out perfect.

Not fudgy as I was hoping for, but more cake-like. It wasn't cooked at 20 minutes, dry at 25 minutes! The chocolate flavor was pretty right-on (I sprinkled additional chocolate chips on top.) I would probably make this recipe again as a "snack cake", I like the fact that there's not a lot of butter in the recipe.

Pretty good! Easy to make and yummy. I could always deal with some more chocolate and more rich flavor so it doesn't get the full 5 stars.

Mmmmmm!  That is an apt name for these brownies!  I wanted a chocolately treat, but am out of cocoa powder, so I decided to try these.  So glad I did!  Absolutely delicious!  They are fudgey and moist, and incredibly easy to make.  Also, you can really play around with this if you want- add nuts, marshmallow cream, butterscotch chips, dark or white chocolate, maraschino cherries, Nutella, mint...the possibilities are endless!  Thanks for a great recipe!

These are the best brownies I have ever made (and I have made a lot! haha!). I followed the recipe exactly as written. I baked for 25 minutes and they came out moist and fudgy.  My husband said he can't wait for me to make these again!

Would give 4.5 stars - really good but not the absolute best brownies I've made.  I like that they are moderately healthy at least though!

I didn't change anything in the recipe except the chocolate chips. I didn't have any semisweet on hand, so I had to use dark chocolate chips.
They turned out BEAUTIFULLY. Nice, crunchy outside, fudgy, perfect brownie inside. Delicious - definitely my go-to recipe from now on. :D

I thought these were awesome- easy and yummy. But the consensus of others was that they were too cakey and thus needed frosting. Ill probly look for a fudgier recipe to please my sweetheart, and make these when I'm home alone.

Such a great recipe! This is the first from scratch brownie recipe that I like. I've made it twice now and both times it has turned out great. I would bake it for the full 30 minutes no less no more and it will come out perfectly. I added walnuts to mine and it was wonderful!

Delicious!  I made the recipe exactly as written and love them.  I wasn't sure if they'd be too fudgy for me because of the limited flour that's added but they're perfect.  I think I'll have to have another one now... they are still warm.

Really easy to make and with ingredients I always have around. I made them exactly by the recipe and they turned out perfect. Next time I am going to try and use tollhouse dark chocolate chips and maybe cut down the sugar.

Extremely simple to make, only uses one pan to cook all ingredients in, and one pan to bake it in. Used glass baking pan; brownies' outcome were soft, very moist, very chocolatey, but still had that cake look--not the fudgy look some end up. I allowed the brownies to cool off in pan as instructed, this allows the product to have continuous cooking while pan's heat gradually decreases. Such an elegant recipe with such simplicity. Absolutely exquisite! Very easy to make, I say again, because I have a one-year-old constantly nagging me while I cook, and I need that fast bake-off. Thank you sooooo much! These are DELICIOUS! I will NEVER use any other recipe except this one ever again!!!

I tried various recipes from allrecipes.com before I found this one. I double it in a 9x13 pan - it makes extra thick brownies, gooey in the middle, crispy around the edges - perfect. This is my go-to brownie recipe now.

Oh My God!! This is brownie heaven! I will never use a box brownie again. I made it with a few changes from the reviewers. So good! Next time I am going to try milk chocolate instaed of semi-sweet. This recipe will be my to go to brownie recipe. It will be a multi repeat. Thanks for a awesome  recipe.

These are by far the best brownies I have ever had. I was looking for a recipe that didn't have a lot of butter in it or a bunch of oil. These are perfect. They'd be even better with nuts, but I didn't have any on hand.

The resulting brownies are pretty similar to the easy bake Betty Crocker ones, but it's a good alternative. Since this one uses chocolate chips vs. cocoa powder the kind of choco (milk, dark, semi) will make a huge difference.

I really wanted brownies, but I didn't have boxed brownie mix or cocoa powder, so I searched through all the higher rated recipes for one that called for chocolate (I only had Dove dark, which was FANTASTIC).  These were excellent, as stated I used some Dove Dark Chocolate that I got as a stocking stuffer from my husband and they were *amazing*.  I'm dying for brownies, so I'm making these again tonight, and freezing the rest so I don't eat/waste them all.  So excited!
Seriously try it with the dark chocolate promises, you just cut them until you get a cup and a half, which is less than the bag when you measure it out, as weight and mass are different.

These are super easy to make and take virtually no time at all. I add 3/4 c chopped walnuts to the batter and 1/4 c sprinkled over the top. My boyfriend ADORES these brownies!!

Can't beat this one pot, one pan recipe.  Works best baked in a muffin pan.

I tried this recipe with both semi-sweet and milk chocolate chips, the semi-sweet turned out ok, but the taste wasn't the best. The milk chocolate chips turned out funny with a off taste. I will keep looking for a good recipe.

I made these brownies last night, they did come out perfect in texture and appearance. The taste had a little something missing if you ask me, but delightful regardless. I doubled the recipe and sent some to work with my husband. Cooks Illustrated has a chewy brownie recipe that comes out SO much more delicious but they aren't as pretty and it's a fairly complicated recipe. But as for these, I would definitely make them again. BUT use mexican vanilla, or madagascar vanilla. It makes a brownie 10X better!

Wow! Amazing brownies, I followed the recipe exactly, and baked them in mini muffin tins for about ten mins.  Tasted way better then the store bought two bite brownies.  Off to bake batch number 2!

By FAR the tastiest and easiest brownie recipe I've ever encountered, and I didn't even have to alter the recipe! I recommend baking in a pie pan and serving wedges instead of squares.

these were very easy to make and tasted really good!  the only complaint I have is that they weren't chocolatey enough for my taste.  Also I doubled the recipe to bake them in a 9"x13" pan and they took a good 20 minutes longer to cook.  Very good though and i will keep trying different kinds and amounts of chocolate to see what works for me.

good recipe. I really liked the texture somewhat cakie but fudgy as well. Next time I may add more chocolate chips as they didn't seem chocolately enough. I accidently baked at 350 for 25 min. still turned out fine!

Next time I will skip the salt though.

OMG, These really are the best brownies I have ever eaten. I cut them into small squares thinking I would eat less, NOPE. Have a glass of milk handy when you eat these as a little goes a long way and they are very rich, just as a brownie should be.

This should read...MMMMM...Chocolate Cake! It really can't be classified as a brownie. It's chocolate cake minus the frosting (and with how dry this "brownie" is it really NEEDS frosting). I didn't have any powdered sugar or frosting so I heated up some fresh strawberries and used it as a topping. It's great as cake! But I must give these so-called brownies a 2 star rating.

Oh my heavens! These are soooo good! I used 1/2 semisweet Chocolate and 1/2 dark chocolate, not chips though. Then I made them into square muffin tins to save on cutting! Baked for 20 min and voila!! i placed a cherry in the center of some and a halved pecan in the others and dusted with Confec sugar with a dollop of Whipped Cream! To die for!!!

I was hoping for fudgey but instead I got cakey.  The recipe itself is very simple and straightforward, I just didn't find it overly chocolatey.  The kids loved them though.

I never thought that making brownies from scratch would be so easy, but this really was. I went along with the recipe exactly, and they turned out great. I should have cooked them a tiny bit longer, I did it for 26 minutes and they weren't totally cooked. But I do not even care, I ate them just as fast!

These were like the ones from a good coffee shop and not anything like boxed brownies! These are now the base of an ice cream cake to die for. Thumbs way up. You can use mint or orange extract instead of vanilla too!

Delicious!  Moist, chewy, and gooey.  25 minutes was the perfect cooking time for these brownies.  These are also very quick to throw together - 10 minutes max, and you can wash the single pan while they bake and still have enough time for a cup of tea before the brownies come out of the oven!

AMAZING!!! I am telling you, these brownies came out perfect and beautiful. These brownies had me thinking I was the next Betty Crocker! They are moist and chewy, just like I like my brownies to be. The only thing I tweaked was I added about 2 Tbs of cocoa powder and used a 9x9 pan. I think next time I will do half brown sugar and half white sugar. So in the future there will be no more brownies mixes for this chick!!!

These brownies are wonderful!  Easy to make, and so tasty!  I've only made them once, but I know that this is THE  one I'll ALWAYS use!  I made a couple of changes, using 3/4 cups dark chocolate chips and 3/4 cups semi sweet chocolate chips, and since our family likes nuts, added a cup of chopped walnuts.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was one of the best brownies ever!!! This was delicious!!! But it did fall apart a little bit. I think I just didn't let it cool long enough. Just remember to let it cool long enough after you bake it, but other than that it was AMAZING. Thank you for sharing!
                           WOW

I doubled the recipe, baked as 24 cupcakes for about 14 min, and piped on "Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting".  WOW!

This recipe turned out great!  It took no time at all to prepare and tastes so much better than the best quality brownie mix you can buy at the grocery store.  I doubled the recipe and baked them at 325 for 30 in a special brownie pan that was about 9x13.

These are SO delicious!! I realized as I was making them that I had bittersweet chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet.  I doubled the sugar in the recipe to make up for lack of sugar in the choco chips. 
The brownies have a really nice, rich, fudgy texture and taste. I love the fact that I don't need cocoa powder to make these.

Everyone else is right! Best. Brownies. Ever!!! I only changed it a bit and that's because I didn't have some of the ingredients on hand (made it before exactly by the recipe and they were amazing then too!) I used half brown sugar and half white. I also added peanut butter chips and a few walnuts. AAAMAZING!

Yummy! First time making from scratch & they turned out perfect! I am not a brownie person either! Followed recipe exactly but also incorporated some Health toffee bits I had on hand to make up the 1.5C semi sweet chips. Used 2Tbl Bailey's in lieu of water. Mixed eggs before adding, baked at 325 for 25 mins & perfect! So easy will make again! Thank you!

I thought these brownies turned out great. While baking, I was worried they weren't going to set, but they turned out fine. For the amount of chocolate, I did expect a little richer chocolate taste, but it still tasted good.

These were really really good. They had the crispy top which I was looking for, but I also think they had too much salt. I will definitely make again; tweak to personal preference. I like the idea of trying the expresso coffee + dark chocolate that another reviewer mentioned. I had doubled the recipe; another had mentioned reducing eggs to get a fudgier texture, I think I will try that as well. All in all a really good recipe - thanks so much!

Amazing and so much better than a mix! I tried these brownies after reading several reviews about this recipe. I'm so glad I tried these. Everyone loved them and I can't wait to make these again. I followed the instructions exactly. Nice flaky chewy texture on top, moist and delicious inside. I will never make brownies from a mix. I only use this recipe.

my husband, who thinks chocolate should be the national food, LOVES these.  I used mini chips and don't mix them totally, leaving them stirred in well but not all melted and they are fabulous!! easy as 1-2-3. I have given my two daughters this recipe and their fellas love it as well. will make this again and again!! P.S. hubby has asked when I'll make again already!!  try this recipe and you will never waste your money on box brownie mix again--guarantee!!

My family LOVED these brownies. I used milk chocolate chips instead of semisweet. These brownies paired very well with my homemade icing also. They are a HUGE hit with friends and family and are always in demand for potlucks.

These brownies are absolutely DELICIOUS. I will never resort to baking mixes again!!! It's so easy. I whipped the batter out in a few minutes. I love it. I will probably use milk chocolate next time, as I didn't think it was sweet enough personally. But the family loved it! Thanks for the recipe!

These are very good.  The tops of them are just like the brownies out of the box.  I left the mixture on top of the warm stovetop to make it easier to stir.  They came out great.

Great recipe and easy to make! I love that everything can be made in one pan. The brownies are definitely rich and fudgy. One small piece goes a long way. I agree with some other reviewers that the recipe is a little salty. I followed the recipe, but when I make them again I will probably use half the salt. I made them for my husband's birthday, and the were a big hit.

DYNOMITE!!  Was stuck at home in a storm, so had to sub margarine for butter and it still turned out totally yummy.  Will make sure I have the real thing next time.  This recipe is a keeper!

I HIGHLY recommend! These brownies are so rich and fudgey...yum! I would rather keep chocolate chips on hand and make these than keep a box of brownie mix tucked away - these are just as easy to make!
I made two batches, and for the second I took another reviewer's advice and added 1/2 cup of chips to the batter right before I put it in the pan, which made them even tastier. I may experiment with that trick & try different flavored chips to mix things up a bit.

At first I thought these tasted too similar to the boxed kind (which is just not as good as homemade), but the next day and the day after, they tasted much better.  They are not my favorite ever brownie recipe but they are very good and very easy.   They did take much longer to bake than the recipe said and even then I finally gave up and took them out before they were done since I don't mind my brownies being a little bit "sad."  Thanks for the recipe.

I am soooo into not using a mix if I can find a good, quick, easy recipe and this is it! I am a Pampered Chef Consultant and got 72 brownie bites using this recipe along with my Deluxe Mini Muffin Pan! No changes made, love, love loved it!!

Brownie mix from a box? I think not! These are way better, and so very easy to prepare. I also like to use milk chocolate chips. I use an 8x8 dark glass baking dish and have to bake them the full 30 minutes.

5 stars for being easy, and can't complain about the taste.  Although they're delicious, they might not be THE very best brownies ever... I'd be pretty picky about that title!  I did temper the eggs before combining.  I appreciate that in this recipe the salt flavor isn't lost**

These are the first homemade brownies I have ever made. They came out perfect. I brought them to a get together and got a lot of great comments. I won't be buying box brownies ever again! I also made a couple different versions. One batch I added walnuts and another batch I used dark chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate and added coconut to the top.

The recipe was very easy, however it turned out more of a chocolate cake! If I were to make it again, I would not use an 8x8 square pan. We like our brownies on the thinner side!

These were much more cakey than I want in a brownie. The flavor is great but the texture was not the rich dense brownie texture I expected.

These came out amazing! They were so soft and smooth I will never go back to mix-out-of-a-box brownies ever again. I used semisweet Ghirardelli chocolate chips which gave it a great rich taste. Also... with mix-out-of-a-box brownies, I always, ALWAYS had burnt edges and they were so crunchy around the edges and almost rock hard - but that didn't happen with this. They slid out of my pan perfectly with no crunchy/funky edges!

WOW! This has just become my go to recipe for brownies! So easy and quick.

I did make changes to the recipe; but only added 2 things. I added crushed almonds to the melted chocolate portion of the recipe (for my friend Donna, who insists brownies MUST have nuts, almonds being her favorite.)I also swirled some raspberry preserves into 2/3 of the pan for me, since I love chocolate and raspberry together. Bring on the milk!!!

This is very much like the brownie recipe I use.  So easy and fast.  I use 2 cups of chocolate chips.  One cup is added to melt and mix in and after all other ingredients are added, I stir in the second cup of chocolate chips.  I also like to add some chopped walnuts.

This recipe was extremely easy and yielded moist brownies. I followed others advice and added another handful of choc chips right before pouring the batter into the pan. I also used 2/3 cup of whole wheat flour instead of white flour. It was delicious. Thank you!

Quick, easy, delicious with ingredients I almost always have on hand.  My only change was to add less sugar for a more pronounced chocolate flavor.

These are delish! I didn't have any chocolate chips, and only had 8 oz of semisweet bakers chocolate, so that's what I used. Everything else stayed the same. The result after 20 minutes of baking was a very delicious, cakey brownie. I can't wait to try these again with the full amount of chocolate, but these are perfect for today... Hurricane Irene is coming through making things fall apart, and these brownies fall apart when you take them out of the pan! OK, it's a stretch, but these brownies really are great. :)

These tasted good but it is not what I had hoped for. These were dry, crumbly, and pale looking...I hated the way the bottoms stuck to the pan. My perfect brownie is very sweet, intense, moist, chewy consistency and these were more dry, sort of half brownie half cake consistency. I may use this recipe as a guide but just may do modifications.

Not the best brownies I've ever had, but they weren't bad. I just didn't find anything spectacular about the recipe and thought they tasted pretty average.

Easy to make and the best brownies I've ever had. In half a day I ate almost the whole batch just by nibbling here and there, sadly for my waistline. I only gave 4 stars because the 1/2 tsp of salt will make these taste like they were marinated in the ocean. I added less than a 1/4 tsp and it still tasted a bit too salty, but not enough to ruin them. I would add a "pinch" for depth of flavor but that's all. I also used Hershey's chips which made them even darker and richer tasting. I saved a few and coated them in cocoa and stirred them into the batter for chunks of chocolate, but next time I'm going to leave them out. These are so rich and delicious they don't need any extras. The outside is nice and caramelized and the inside is moist and melty. This is my go to recipe for brownies from now on.

Why you'd want to buy another boxed brownie rather than making this your go-to recipe is beyond me! These ingredients are always on hand here and rather than experiencing a convenient way to make brownies at home with a boxed variety, you get to experience the satisfaction of a (quick and simple) recipe that has you heating, stirring, measuring, and enjoying brownies a la made-from-scratch, which is how I prefer it. Prior to giving this recipe a whirl, I had found Ghiradelli's boxed brownies to be our family's favorite, but this recipe is absolutely what makes the perfect brownie, in my book, hence the 5 stars. *I will say that I used a butter pat to grease my pan since it was already out and since it was salted butter, the outer brownies came with a bit more saltiness that I wasn't expecting, but that I loved! Sweet and salty, how could that go wrong?! So, just for those that may use the same method to prepare a pan but have salt sensitivity, try unsalted butter. I also do not like iced brownies, so these were naked and chocolatey all on their own. Next time, I'm going to experiment with adding chopped candy bars on top or toffee crunch. You can really expand on this recipe easily. Try it!

These brownies were awesome! I had to modify the chocolate a bit to work with what I had on hand (combo of semi sweet baking squares, cocoa powder, and hershey kisses) I took the advice of others and only used 1/2 the amount of salt it could be omitted entirely though esp if using salted butter. The texture of these brownies were the best that I have ever made. Mine took about 30 mins to cook thru.

All I can say is "WOW!" and my husband and I don't even like brownies! I followed the recipe exactly and used almost a whole bag of Ghiradelli's 60% cacao chocolate chips. And these made them not too sweet but perfectly chocolately Not too cakey not too flat! I served them warm with a dollop of whipped cream and a little drizzle of chocolate syrup. 
Perfecto!!!!!

So easy and so GOOD!  I always keep a couple of boxes of brownie mix in the cupboard, for those times I need to throw something together really quick.  Today was one of those times, but oops, I forgot to restock my pantry.  However it was stocked with chocolate chips.  These were so simple, and the use of chocolate chips instead of cocoa powder makes them so much fudgier than other scratch brownies.  This will be my new go to recipe whenever I want something beyond the generic taste the box mixes create.  I added a dash of cinnamon with the dry ingredients, and 1/2 cup chocolate chips to the batter.  Two things I always do with box mixes, and voila!  Yummy!

Good brownie.  Mine took about 32 minutes to bake.  They have the appearance of a fudgy brownie, but the taste of a cake-like brownie.  I added nuts to the top before baking on half the pan.

These were pretty good, although they have more of a cake flavour...it might have been something we did.... still yummy.

These are really good. I used all brown sugar and store brand chips. I like the richness of all brown sugar. I lined my pan with foil to help with sticking. I baked for 25 minutes and they were still really gooey. Set the timer for five more minutes and they were perfect. I am tossing my other brownie recipe and will make this again!

not that good.  at first bite-bland; then the harsh taste of white sugar attacks the taste buds.  all in all not terrible, but would not make them again.

I'm pretty sure I messed up the chocolate bc it just turned into a lump. Despite this, these brownies were gone within just a few hours, the whole pan!

Took me awhile to get this one right, it seemed that no matter what I did the cooking time wasn't right, it turned out either gooey or hard, I solved this by cooking it for the longer listed time and tested with a toothpick every 30 seconds thereafter until it came out almost dry. Then I had a problem with it sticking no matter how I prepared the pan or no matter how much time I let the Brownies cool in the pan, I finally solved this by lining the pan with parchment paper, slitting the corners so that the paper fit down into the pan. After all of this and finding a good frosting to go with the intense chocolate flavor of the brownies (I ended up using a sour cream chocolate frosting, light on the chocolate) my grandkids like it so much they want me to make them a new batch every week. They won't even eat boxed mix brownies any more, well they won't eat them without complaining about how much better Grandpa's are anyway.

I prefer to make everything from scratch, but that Ghiaradelli brownie mix is pretty hard to compete with.  But finally, this is the brownie recipe I've been looking for.  Followed the recipe exactly.  They are absolutely the best!

I made this recipe as stated except added walnuts.  I baked it for 20 minutes in "The Perfect Brownie Pan", and it came out "PERFECT"!  Wonderful brownie that's NOT from a box!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Made these this morning and they are wonderful. I took them out 5 minutes early and when they cooled they were just right.  Very quick...I mixed everything by hand in the pan that I melted the sugar in.

Best Brownie recipe I have found yet! Very easy to make, and very tasty!! The semi sweet chocolate chips make them taste kind of dark chocolaty which even i liked ( I don't normally like dark chocolate) Next time I may experiment with milk chocolate chips, or butterscotch..or peanut butter.

I just baked these and they turned out amazing! Definitely the best brownies I've ever had. I couldn't find my 8X8 glass pan, so I sprayed my cupcake/muffin tin with nonstick spray and baked them for about 19-20 minutes and they came out perfectly portioned  :)  This is definitely a recipe to keep and use often!

All I can say is that if you like chocolate these are for you!  They were easy to make and were moist and delicious!  I actually just put them into cupcake papers and made them that way.  All in the family loved them!  Thanks for sharing.

I must have done something majorly wrong because I would take a box over this any day.  It was too sweet (corn syrup sweet for me).  If it was meant to be this sweet then I guess it was ok but I was expecting a rich chocolate taste.

I have been trying tons of different brownie recipes.  My husband likes boxed, but I don't like the extra preservatives and wanted to be able to make some from scratch.  Most I made dried out horribly the next day and just weren't very flavorful.  These were gooey and moist and didn't dry out.  Granted they didn't last past the second day, but still.  I plan on trying these with nuts and also substituting part of the semi-sweet chips for milk chocolate chips, but they were great without any changes.  Yum.

After reading reviews, I decided to bake these and make a couple changes myself - try this!  They are delicious.  Instead of 1/2 cup white sugar I used 1/4 shite sugar and 1/4 brown sugar and instead of 2 tablespoons of water I used 1 tablespoons of creme de cocoa.  MMMMM!

OMG!!  Sooo good!  I made and took these camping, but I pretty much ate them all.  Someone mentioned the eggs should not be cold when adding them to the warm chocolate.  Mine where actually left out for about an hour and a half (I got a little distracted before I made them). I also added 1/4 teaspoon of salt.   I will be making these again this week.

I like this recipe because it's easy and seems a little lower in fat than other brownie recipes, but I found the result a little too much like a very moist chocolate cake, whereas I would have preferred something a little chewier and more brownie-like.  Mine also lacked that cracked top which I associate with brownies (though other reviewers seem to have achieved it so perhaps that is due to some particularity in the baking process).

I made these for my mother in law on her birthday and let her take all the leftovers home. Well it's four days later and I'm still regretting not hoarding a few for myself! I followed another reviewer's advice and mixed in a half cup of chocolate chips at the last moment and goodness they were good!

Yes, they're good enough. I'm not a very experienced baker, and they came out fine. I halved the amounts but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Another reviewer was saying to use your best chips... good idea because you can really taste them.

I'm going to have to make these again sometime to give a fair review. I underbaked them by quite a bit somehow and wound up with delicious goo, kind of like a pudding cake. We'll eat the goo, and it is delicious goo, so I cannot give this less than 5 stars, as the fault for underbaking is my own! P.S. Some of the method is goofy here. Beat your eggs & vanilla together before you add them; trying to beat your eggs into the chocolate mixture is a fool's errand! Also, add the vanilla after the eggs (or beat them together). If you add the vanilla before the eggs you'll seize the chocolate; chocolate needs a LOT of liquid at once to not seize (or none at all); just a little liquid will ruin it! Thanks for the recipe!

really easy to make. i prepared everything in one pot. these are actually a lot better the next day, just make sure you store them in an air-tight container. otherwise they'll go hard fast. handed them out to over 10 ppl, and everyone raved. :)

Delicious!  It was St. Patrick's Day, so I substituted Irish Cream for the water (and added 2 extra tablespoons).  I also added the rest of the chocolate chips left in the bag before baking.  The texture was perfect, they were very moist, and a huge hit.  I can't believe there are only 2 tablespoons of butter.

These are exactly what I was searching for!  Chocolatey!!!!!!!!!  I doubled the batch for a 9x13 and added a 1/2 cup of choco chips at the end so they wouldn't completely melt away.  perfect!!

DELICIOUS!!! A few changes...I used peanut butter and chocolate chips, increased the sugar to 3/4 cup, and added 1/3 cup cocoa powder. Served warm with vanilla ice cream, chocolate syrup and whip cream - OMG YUM!!!!

These brownies turned out great tasting and nice and chewy on the inside.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I did find that the batter barely fit into the 8x8 pan though so next time I make them I will add a little extra of each ingredient so that they end up a better size brownie in the end.

These brownies are pretty amazing for only 2 tablespoons of butter!!!!!! I think the only thing that would make them better was to make them a bit more chewy, but otherwise awesome!

From all the positive reviews I was sure I would like this recipe and I was sorely disappointed. These brownies are way too sweet. Nobody in my family liked them. They look great but don't taste good. I followed the recipe exactly. No suggestion for how to improve. I won't make them again.

I halved the recipe and made this into six muffin brownies. Baked at 170 for exactly 13 minutes, these turned out soft, chewy and quite delicious. While these are good (5 stars for ease of making. I only dirtied one pot)  I'm looking for something richer and more chocolatey and fragrant. Something with a darker taste. If I do make these again I will swap out some of the flour for cocoa powder.

I love this recipe, it was my first time making brownies in a very very long time and they came out perfectly. I doubled the recipe and baked them in a 9x13 pan for 30 minutes. Turned out beautifully. I also added a few drops of orange extract just for fun, and it gave it an extremely subtle orange taste. Delicious. I sent them to work with my husband; he came back with an empty plate and a ton of compliments. Yay for brownies.

Mmmm is exactly right! These brownies are deliciously chocolatey. The only things I did differently from the recipe were that I used 1 9oz bag of premium milk chocolate baking bars (Hershey's) instead of semi-sweet chocolate chips and I added walnuts. These are the BEST brownies I've had in a very long time! The recipe is a definite KEEPER! Thanks!

Absolutely fabulous! I followed the recipe exactly except I used milk chocolate chips and tried to make a double batch in a large pan. The milk chocolate chips were great but the double-batch, not so much. If you want doubles, I recommend using two seperate 8x8 pans.

As many of the other reviewers noted, these brownies were a lot like a boxed brownie mix. They had a beautiful, shiny, crinkly top and were dense and fudgy. While these were delicious, it wasn't very chewy. Over all, a very good fudge brownie and they didn't last very long! For a double batch bake in a 9x13 pan.

This recipe didn't work at all for me.  I followed the recipe exactly but it rose really high and then sunk in the middle and was a soupy mess.  I'm gonna give it another go and see how it turns out for the second time.

Very moist, but salty. I used unsalted butter but they were still very salty. Will try again without any salt to see if that helps. Otherwise pretty good.

This was an excellent recipe and was a big hit at work. I used mini muffin tins to make it so it turned out like those one bite brownies only not as fudgy. I added some instant coffee to the batter.

I was really excited to try this recipe because there wasn't much butter and not that many ingredients.  They were good, but not as good as everyone else is describing.  There's a strong salty taste to it.  I didn't like that.

These were the fudgiest homemade brownies I've ever tasted.  They were really fast and easy to make.  I brought them to a cookout and EVERYONE absolutely raved about them.  A few people said they were the best brownies they've ever had.  The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars and not 5 is because they were a little too sweet for me.  If you like your brownies very chocolately, fudgey, and sweet, this is the recipe for you.  I'd definitely make them again.

wowwwwww.....this is an awesome recipe. this is for the first time i am writing a review. This is for the first time, i made brownies from the scratch. and gosh they taste so heavenly. I followed the recipe exactly, just made few changes. as i had less semi sweet chocolate, so used milk chocolate instead and added chopped snicker bars to it... It was so yum that even my husband who is not a brownie fan otherwise,added it to his favorite dessert list. He asked if i could make some more to gift one of his friend!!

Excellent recipe.  Very simple, easy to make and every bit as good as a store box mix for a much lower price.  I was looking for a good made-from-scratch brownie recipe that doesn't use 1C of butter and this is certainly it.  If you don't like them as thick, use a 9x13 pan instead.  Can also increase eggs to 3 for a more cakelike result.

This is a really great fudgy brownie recipe.  I upped it by 50% and baked in a 9X13, but they weren't too thin even then.  I also stirred a cup of peanut butter chips into the completed batter and that was excellent.  I would definitely recommend this any time you want brownies from scratch.

PERFECT homemade recipe.  I've made 2 others from this site and thought I'd already found my master recipe, but this one will be THE one. (Even better than Mmm-Mmm-Better-Brownies). This recipe is definitely richer, more fudgy and decadent.  I have also used dark chocolate with amazing results.  Also, if you add 1 teaspoon of instant espresso powder, you get a nice hint of 'mocha brownies' - try it!

I love, love, LOVE this brownie recipe! It seems impossible to flub, and even when I have chosen to underbake them they're still delicious. My oven takes only about 20 minutes, but possibly because I don't allow the chocolate mixture to cool very much. Especially enjoy this with a dollop of freshly whipped cream and a dribble of raspberry sauce---yum!

We thought these were okay.  We liked them better warm, fresh out of the oven.  When they cooled they tasted like semi-sweet chocolate chips intstead of brownies.

OH MY! These are so good! I used milk chocolate chips, rather than semi sweet...this is the only change I made. I tripled the batch, and there are only a few left!! This is now my go to brownie recipe:) Thanks for sharing!

My husband loved these. He gave them 4 stars. Me on the other hand thought they were OK. I like the texture of them, nice and chewy. but not too crazy about the semi-sweet flavor. a little to much of that bitter chocolate taste for me. Maybe next time I'll use half milk chocolate chips.

I often read recipes and wonder how a few people can rate something as bad, when 99.9 percent of ratings are so good? Maybe I didn't bake these long enough, but at 25 minutes ("do not overbake") I took them out. Should have gone 30 minutes. The edges have a good taste but the brownie looks 'wet' and undercooked. I also had to use a power mixer to put the ingredients together, as the chocolate turned to a thick fudge once melted, and wouldn't blend into the eggs too well. Unlikely I'll attempt this one again. Good luck to the others.

I followed this recipe EXACTLY, but sprinkled some additional chips on top before baking. These were so easy to make, and super fast. I had these mixed, in the oven and the kitchen cleaned up in 20 minutes! Oh and I can't wait to eat them- I am so excited I am writing this while they are baking!!  **UPDATE** Well I never reviewed the first batch but they were gone in about 30 minutes!  The BEST Brownies I have EVER made!  So good... there's another batch in the oven right now!

I really liked this recipe. I would have given this 4 stars but my husband insists that these are the best brownies he's ever had. Here are some road blocks I ran in to. First,the batter got so thick when I added the chocolate that I couldn't mix it by hand. I got out my hand mixer and all was well. Also, it took quite a bit longer than the 25-30 min. at 325 for mine. With the do not over bake warning, I was scared to push it past 30 min. but I kept on and got almost done brownies at about 35 min. They are still a little undercooked but I like 'em that way! I served the brownies over a vanilla bean custard sauce and topped with nuts, ice cream, and caramel. Delish!

These brownies were very easy to make and so delicious they didn't last 24hrs!  I only had a 150g bar of 70% cocoa chocolate so I grated it and melted it in as per the recipe.  After pouring the batter into the baking pan I also swirled in some melted white chocolate to make up for the lack of dark chocolate.  Looked, smelled and tasted amazing - a great hit with the children and even the husband who's not a sweet fan.  Will definitely be baking these again soon!

Holy Cow!  As other reviewers stated, "do not overcook!"  I did and they were a bit crunchy, but the flavor was supurb!  They seem undercooked if you follow the recipe cook time and use the toothpick method, but next time I will follow the cook time exactly! If you prefer dark chocolate, ues it!  I used it and they turned out fabulous being a real hit at my recent dinner party.  Serve with vanilla ice cream and dark chocolate drizzle...  MMMMMM... Brownies!

Dry and crumbly, and don't taste all that great, either. Were also hard to put into the pan as the batter was very sticky and thick. Very surprised by these results given the favourable reviews ...

Yes yes yes Oh yes! Perfect brownies, soft and moist with a flaky upper crust. I added chocolate chips , but they would have been incredibly sweet either way. I did forget to add the salt, but don't think it would have altered the flavor much.

Very yuMMMMMy brownies. I can't stop eating them. The only thing I did different was 1/2 semisweet, 1/2 milk chocolate chips, and then added some unmelted chips to the batter. They were PERFECT!! Even my husband who claims he's not a "brownie person" couldn't stay out of MY brownies.

I made this recipe today while I was on the phone and it took no time at all and they turned out perfect. My family loves them and I will only use this recipe from now on. In the future I think I will play around with adding nuts or caramel. I also used chocolate milk chips instead of semi-sweet. Other than that, they were great.

These were AMAZING! At the request of my dear friend, I made her these brownies for Xmas. It was such a great hit among my friends that I made four batches in two days. Everyone said that they were THE BEST brownies in the world.
edit: added 3oz chocolate chips, 1/2 tsp instant coffee dissolved in 1 tsp hot water(enhances the chocolate taste), 1/4 c milk(to make the batter thinner), and used 3/4 c sugar because the extra chocolate chips add sweetness.

I am a true lover of all things brownie and these are fantastic! The only change I made was to add about 1/3 cup cocoa powder.  These are by far the BEST brownies I've ever made.  I will not buy a boxed mix ever again!  Thank you for a fantastic recipe!!

My family LOVES the "2-Bite" brownies that you can buy at Sam's and Krogers...these are the closest thing I've ever found!  I made mine with a mini muffin pan and baked for about 15-20 minutes. Wonderful AND easy!

Good flavor...I didn't have great results but that is my fault, I live in high altitude and spaced adding the extra flour, I remembered to decrease the soda...so my brownies came out flat. So next time i will definitely remember to add it...lol *UPDATE* Ok so I retried this recipe but remembered to do all of the adjustments for high altitude. I added 1 Tbsp flour, 1 Tbsp water, reduced the baking soda by 1/8 tsp. Came out perfect! The flavor last time was great but they came out flat, this time they are tastey AND plump!

Love this recipe!!!!Move ove BOX MAN... I am sad to admit this.... but i am/WAS a box chick. Only because I have not been able to find the recipe I have been looking for when it comes to brownies. I have tried plenty of times, and this is going to be a FAMILY keeper, and I am to pass this one along... LOVE IT!!! I did not have my 8x8 here at my friends house, so i used a muffin pan. It is a pretty deep muffin pan. Oh did those brownies rise to the occasion. I also sprayed the flour spray for baking, instead of  greasing it down.This would also go great w/t some smooth ice cream. THIS IS GETTING THE BEST RATING FOR ME... Thank you......xoxo

This is an excellent basic brownie recipe. We like our brownies more gooey and less cakey... this recipe says to cook for 25-30 minutes. I cooked these for 19 minutes and they were completely done. In fact, we would've preferred even gooier. That could just be our oven, but if you don't like brownies that are very cake-like, just make sure to undercook these just a tad. They're even better the second day!

This is a very easy and very tasty recipe. I've never made homemade brownies before and these were very simple and easy to follow.

I used half semi sweet and half milk chocolate chips and they turned out amazing. 

I advise doubling the recipe because everyone seems to like them and they go really fast.

This is one of the easiest brownie recipes I have found. They taste fantastic and turn out great every time I make them. Once I baked them just a minute too long and they were not as chewy. So, careful!

OMG!!!!!!!! These were so good! I'm 9 months prego and I ate the whole pan in less than 24 hours all by myself. I followed the recipe to a T and the cooking time was really off. I added at least an additional 15 mins of cooking time. They were very soft and moist. Definitely a keeper!

Will have to keep searching for brownie recipes. This one tasted very cakey even after cooking it for less time to guarantee the soft/fudgey center.

This was my first time making brownies, and I followed the recipe almost exactly. They turned out lovely! Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. However, but that's just a personal opinion, I would've liked the brownies to be a bit more moist on the inside. I baked them for about 30-35 minutes, so it might've been just a tad too long.

I took some of the reviewers' advice and let the pan simmer on low heat while melting the chocolate, and let the mixture cool down a bit before adding the eggs. I mixed everything thoroughly and I was amazed by the way the brownies rose in the oven. 

This recipe definitely is a keeper.

These truly are amazing. I used 50/50 butter/smart balance.  I added the left over chocolate chips I had with some flour.  and they're delicious.  Way better than boxed.  Just be careful that you don't put the eggs in while too hot, or else they will scramble.  nasty!  easy and enjoyable.

These were pretty good, but I have to say that I still like the box version better. It is a great recipe to have if I don't have the brownie mix on hand.

these were okay, but not the dense, fudgie brownies i was hoping for. i also thought they were a little too sweet. (i'm looking for a rich chocolatey taste.) i probably won't make them again, but they're better than the similar ones in my cook book that only have about 1/2 c. chocolate chips and aren't chocolatey at all. eventually, i'll find that brownie recipe i'm looking for.

I originally made this recipe because i already had all of the ingredients. They were so good!! i followed the recipe exactly, except that i had some choc. chips left in the bag so i just tossed them in right before putting the mix in the pan. i also doubled the recipe and put it in my 9x13 pan and it was perfect. i will be making this recipe again for sure!! THANKS

These were really GREAT and everything I hoped for. I don't understand what others did to get cakey brownies but mine weren't like cake at all but very fudgy. I made them for the 2nd time last night and they were perfect. The 1st batch tasted good but the consistency was off. I felt it was something I did and no fault of the recipe. So the 2nd time around I did as other reviewers suggested and tempered the eggs and also left the pot on the stove (low heat) while melting the chocolate. I made sure to mix a lot better and longer the second time so that the batter was very smooth. My first batch was like others experienced - not done in the center and over done on the outside because I kept cooking to try and get the center done.  Whatever changes I made the second time around with mixing really well, tempered eggs or whatever, I didn't have the problem the second time. They cooked for exactly the 30 minutes and are fabulous.  I definitely want to try swirling peanut butter or adding pb chips the next time around. Will make these forever! These are also better for me than boxed (aside from the preservatives) because I am not supposed to have wheat and I can do my own thing.  For anyone else with that issue, I used organic soy flour and it worked perfectly.

In the recipe's defense, I don't think that I added enough chocolate chips.  The recipe was easy, so I think that I will try it again.

These were ok, not great...but ok. Followed recipe exactly and got very cakey, not really sweet brownies. I was looking for fudgy and chewy, this was more like chocolate cake. Sorry...not a fan of these at all.

This is a great and easy recipe!  I actually purchased a box of brownies the same day that I made these.  I decided to try these first and they were wonderful.  I will never buy boxed brownies again!  These were fantastic!  Thanks for sharing!

These were so good. I usually use the recipe off the back of the canister of cocoa, which we really love but I thought I'd try this. I used hershey's special dark chips. Took about 30min to cook. We couldnt wait for them to cool. But if you could they'd be even better.

No changes were made here and we liked it that way! If you don't have a box of brownies on hand, you can still enjoy some with this. VERY well received by our taste testers.

I didn't feel these brownies were rich enough.  They were just okay but not great.  Would be better with a better quality or different type of chocolate.

Absolutely delicious!  I used Ghiradelli semi sweet chips and made the recipe exactly the way it is written - turned out beautifully!  I used some of the brownies for the bottom of ice cream sundaes - delicious!  I will definitely make this again - I loved being able to use chips instead of cocoa.  Thanks for the recipe!

It almost doesn't make sense how good these brownies taste for how easy they were to make! Except maybe for the chocolate chips, everyone should have the rest of the ingredients in their kitchen, making it very easy to whip up some delicious brownies at the spur of the moment!

They're soft, moist, and perfect! If I can do it, so can you (and my baking skills are zero LOL).

To fit the tastes of my husband and myself, I used a cup each of milk and white chocolate morsels in the mix. The advice about tempering the eggs before adding them to chocolate mix gave me a very smooth mix. I also kept my mix on the stove while adding the chips, then took it off when adding my eggs. 

No more searching for a brownie recipe... I'm done. Thanks for enlightening me!!

I used dark chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate and the brownies and cooked in a glass pie pan. The results were cake-like and I was going for the ooey-gooey kind. Oh well. Will definately try again with the right kind of chocolate as this was a very quick recipe!

So delicous!  Like others mine 'fell' in the middle but they still tasted great.  I added 1/3 C of walnuts and 1/2 C of milk chocolate chips and frosted with chocolate frosting.  Needless to say, they were rich but heavenly!  The nice crisp crust keeps the brownies moist - love this recipe!

I have tried many other recipes for homemade brownies before and most of them were either too sweet, didn't taste well after baking or were very difficult to make.  These brownies however were simple and tasted DELICIOUS.  I wouldn't change the recipe at all except to maybe add something to batter like peanut butter chips or nuts. Great 5 star recipe!!!

I used a mixture of dark chocolate & milk chocolate chips (that's what I had in the house) and tried to write "HAPPY BIRTHDAY" in M&Ms on top but, I messed up the writing and ended up fixing it by covering the whole top with M&Ms.
It could have cooked for a few minutes more. I did 30 minutes and it was still mushy in the middle the next afternoon but, obviously nobody minded because they were all gone by the next evening.
These were THE BEST brownies I've ever made or eaten. It's only been 2 days and I want them again!

Initially three stars but upped to four because they became much better the second day. I was a little skeptical as I put it in the oven because there wasn't a lot of batter, but it rose. I liked that this recipe only had 2 tablespoons of butter and 1/2 cup of sugar. The brownies looked great, with a nice crisp top, and it only sunk a little as it cooled. They had a nice, fudge-y flavor that hit the spot. The batter itself wasn't too tasty - a little like baking soda - but maybe that was a good thing (: The brownies were great the next day, very chewy and chocolatey. I followed the recipe to a T.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!! These made some of the most moist, wonderful flavored brownies ever.  I will say though they make more of a cake like brownie, but I like this type better than the flat gooey ones.  Thank you so much for this recipe.

This was okay but not great. It has more of a cake-like consistency which is not a bad thing but it was just missing something. The middle of the brownie also fell in so presentation was not as nice.

I'm the kind of cook who would rather just eat the chocolate chips for my chocolate fix than cook the brownies, especially from scratch!  I've made plenty of brownies from mixes, though, and have always found them to be tastier than all the brownie recipes I've tried.  However, these were way easy to make and tasted great.  They aren't what I would consider chewy or fudgey, but not as cakey as most.  So a happy medium.  Put ice cream on top, and there is your 5 star dessert.  One pot to clean and the measuring cups go in the dishwasher, so it's an easy cleanup.  I'll definitely use this recipe again.

Excellent recipe and the brownies are just like brownies are supposed to be. Not cakey but moist and chewy and delicious. I unfortunately had only an 8x12 inch pan so they ended up a bit thin but they still tasted wonderful. We sprinkled a few chocolate chips on them before baking and I think that made a very nice touch. We will definitely be making these again but probably double the batter next time, use the same pan and make sure there is plenty of vanilla ice cream at home.

These were delicious and came out soft and chewy.  I'd already sworn off box mixes in favor of homemade varieties, and this one is my new favorite... I'm getting ready to go make another batch!

No joke people.  These brownies really are as good as (or better than) brownies from a box.  Crispy on top, chewy in the middle, and wonderfully chocolaty.  I added a handful of extra chocolate chips into the batter before pouring into the pan to add texture.
  I was a little concerned with my progress while melting the chocolate chips in the pot and adding the eggs, because the mixture looked dry and was difficult to stir, but I stuck with it and they turned out delish.

These brownies are seriously the BEST my family has ever had. I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13" pan for exactly 30 minutes, and they came out perfect. I made a fudge frosting to ice them with, and let me just say that we were in chocolate heaven....I will definitely make these again and again.

These brownies are amazing... I was craving brownies and I made these. Followed the recipe except I used chocolate chunks rather than chips and added a few tablespoons of fat free vanilla yogurt, since it seemed a little dry... and margerine instead of butter, since I don't but butter. 24 hours later and I've eaten half the pan... by myself. 

Best brownies I've ever had.

FANTASTIC recipe. I also used milk (1%) in place of the water, which I think made just enough of a subtle difference. I was also out of baking soda, so I used around 1tsp of baking powder. Followed to a T other than that. Definite keeper recipe.

These brownies came out wonderful! I took the idea of adding milk instead of water a step up and added a splash of heavy cream! Thanks for the recipe!

just okay. not the best I have ever tasted.I was looking for a really tasty and chewy brownie recipe for my kids. this one is chewy and definitely needs a frosting to enhance the flavor of the brownie. I doubled the recipes and used 3 eggs only. well... my kids ate it up, but think I will try another recipe next time.

Quick and simple recipe for when the choco crave hits-not really a chewy brownie but great mix of flavors, and of course customizable-this time I added some chopped toasted pecans and butterscotch chips.

So! These were delectable, although I made some changes to make the recipe easier. When I was scraping the fudge mixture out of my saucepan into my mixing bowl, I put it back on the heat and added a little bit of water to make it easier to scrape out. And instead of mixing the dry ingredients beforehand, as I had no other mixing bowls, I sifted them first like I always do. I think that next time I make these, I will add a little bit of sugar. I found that they needed just a teensy bit more sweetness.

These are the best brownies !!! Crusty on top and moist in the middle !!! Made them as is and the only thing I had to change was I cooked them a tad bit longer to get the middle done.  Awesome !!!

I used Hershey’s Special dark chocolate chips because I prefer dark chocolate, and I took another reviewer’s suggestion and used strong coffee instead of a water.  I was worried because the chocolate chips did not entirely melt before the mixture stiffened up, but the unmelted bits turned into gooey little pockets of chocolate in the finished product.  First time ever making homemade brownies and I will never use a boxed mix again!  Great recipe and my go-to from now on.

25 minutes wasn't nearly enough time, and I doubt an extra 5 minutes would have helped. Instead of a fudgy, chocolatey dessert, I ended up with a gooey mess! The edges were cooked, and that was about it. I have a good brownie pan that works fine for box mixes...not sure where the trouble is with this recipe.

I made this brownie recipe following the exact ingredients only to find it bland and not very chocolaty.  They were more cake-like and not like the soft, fudge consistency of your chewy brownies.  If you want cake brownies, this one is for you.

Ok, I wanted brownies last night, so I made these.  But, I screwed up - I didn't read the directions very well before I began and put way too many chocolate chips into the butter / sugar mixture.   The mixture was way too thick and gummy.  So, I started throwing in pads of butter until it loosened up.  Then, followed the rest of the directions.  Came out GREAT!!

This recipe was so easy to make and was a fabulous batch of brownies.  Everyone commented on how delicious they were.  This is a great start from scratch recipe for those that are allergic to nuts as you can control what goes in.  This one is definitely a keeper.  I did line my pan with parchment paper to keep them from getting crispy on the edges.  I also made  a separate pan and swirled a cheese cake mixture into it.  Will NOT go back to boxed brownies after making this.

4th time is the charm!  I baked 4 recipes today.

1st: Brooke's Best Bombshell - decent, but intoxicatingly sweet. 
2nd: Best Brownies - meh, pretty bland..not cakey, not chewy, not brownie. 
3rd: Jocooks.com brownie recipe - too bold in chocolate flavor, bitter. 
4th (and last): Yep....this is the one.  I was about to give up on homemade brownies.  The differentiatior was definitely chocolate chips instead of cocoa.  Toffee like texture on outer edges and rich and cakey on the inside, but not as tender as a cake.  I love chocolate cake and I love brownies so I must be able to make a distinction between the two.  Try this recipe...don't let the name fool you!

These brownies are both easy to make and exceptionally tasty (if you ever get the chance to eat one)!  I, personally, like 'softer, chewy' brownies, so I only cooked them for  25 minutes. My problem came afterwards in the 'cooling process.' How do you keep everyone away from beautiful brownies....Their smell just wafts throughout the house. If you are lucky enough to have leftovers for the next day - they are scrumptious and go especially well with coffee. 
Thank you for the easy, but magnificent recipe!

Was so easy to make. Didn’t change a thing. Last 5 mins I set Swedish fish on top for a class party. Turned out great!

Found this extremely easy for a "from scratch" recipe.  Not any more work than using a mix.  Very moist and set up well.  Had ice cream on ours of course while still warm.  Yum!

My first review... I have made these several times... the recipe is real easy and makes the best brownies... I have done these as written which is great but the last couple times I have made them I used a full bag of dark chocolate chips instead of semi sweet and added cinnamon into the flour mixture along with 1/2 cup of cinnamon chips “swirled” into the batter just before putting them in the oven.... yummm...

For my first time making brownies, I didn't expect them to come out so good. Whole family loves them. Highly recommend if you're craving chocolatey goodness. (I even added walnuts and they still turned out great)

Baked it over 30min ++ and still too gooey, not even a little cakey  :(
Too sweet, maybe can reduce the sugar amount

Delicious & satisfying brownies!
Living overseas, it was easier and less expensive to get dark bar chocolate [70% -85% cacao] than choc. chips.  
I estimated the grams of choc. bars needed based on a handy online guide found at--
http://cookitsimply.com/measurements/cups/chocolate-chips-0070-085q.html
In my tabletop oven they were done in 20 min. at 160 deg. C.  My brownies turned out a bit dry around the edges & cake-like, so next time I will try a shorter baking time or check my oven's temperature accuracy; and maybe increase the butter and chocolate a little.

Solid and new go-to.  did it in a metal / aluminum 8x8 purchased at local Safeway. That batch was better than the one done in glass for some reason... pro tip sprinkle 1/4 cup of milk choc chips on top before baking and like it says be sure to not overcook

Excellent recipe. The brownies were moist and very tasty. I added some extra chocolate chips to the end batter and put in the flour mixture before the egg and vanilla because I worried about it still being hot and adding egg. Came out great!

This is by far the best brownie recipe I've tried so far. Chewy, fudge like,  rich flavour, not even remotely cake like, like so many recipes I've tried on before.

Followed exactly as written.

I love these brownies!  The other homemade brownies I've tired to make turned out bitter and tasted too salty.  I wasn't sure if these would work out, but they were absolutely perfect!!  They tasted just like boxed brownies, if not better.  My friend who likes to try my bakes thought they were amazing.  Five stars for sure!!!

My go to brownies. I love these brownies, they are so delicious and chocolatey! The change I have made is to replace the Vanilla Extract with Peppermint Extract to make a yummy chocolate/mint brownie.

I made these for my family of 7 and it was a hit! These are the exact texture I love when it comes to waffles and a huge bonus is that it doesn't include any allergy ingredients. We will definitely be making these again. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Honestly the best recipe. I made them Diabetic friendly with splenda and carob chips and they were the best thing I've eaten in a long time

I think this is an excellent brownie for those who like a darker chocolate and less sweet brownie;  that just isn’t my preference.  I realized my mom’s recipe was similar but involved more sugar and butter, less chocolate chips, and nuts; that meets my brownie craving better.

I took a tray out to share with some fellow boaters.  They couldn't stop raving and I ended up making them 3 days running.  I added chocolate chip cookie dough to the top of some of the trays and both types were an equal hit.

-update: made the recipe again using a mini muffin pan- I baked for 17 mins, but I think 15 mins might be perfect - also used whole wheat flour instead of AP and all brown sugar -

i halved the recipe and used a regular muffin pan to make 3 brownies (perfect for a smaller portion!). baked at 325 for 25 mins, but next time I think 22 mins will be perfect if you're looking for the dense fudgey brownies. Also i might cut down a tad bit on the flour next time so they wont be as cakey

This is one of the best brownie recipes I've tried. They taste great and the only dishes you have to do after are whatever you used for measuring and the saucepan.

Excellent recipe. I made minimal changes: instead of butter I used Earth Balance vegan butter, and instead of AP flour I used King Arthur white whole wheat flour. I also used a 9x12 pan and baked for 24 minutes. The brownies are delicious: moist and very chocolate-y and with a pleasant crinkle top. They are a little crumbly and tend to fall apart when cut, even when cool. Next time I'll think about adding a 3 Tablespoons or so of tapioca flour and see if that makes them hold together better.

I did use light brown sugar, but otherwise followed this exactly.  So chocolatey and moist! Will make again, and try some extracts (mint or raspberry would be awesome!)

Used this recipe to make vegan brownies  and they turned out great! Just replaced the semisweet chocolate chips, the butter and the eggs for vegan alternatives. Would recommend!

Full disclosure I'm irritatingly hunting replacement for Betty Crock Orig Supr brownies.  So, that being said have made these brownies twice exactly per directions and they cook perfect, moist, light crust on top (always metal aluminum pan).  But I don't like the semi sweet flavor, too used to milk choc).  I think I'd like better with Milk Choc Chips but as a Brownie freak I only make 2 (13x9) pans at once for the crowds and that means 6 cups choc chips which is pricey and I have access to Semi Sweet in bulk bag not the Milk Choc I want to try.  I have let all friends try and I know they miss the milk choc flavor, they're a little too dark choc taste since it's soo many choc chips in recipe.  It's a good recipe, very smooth batter. Not a fan of "depth of flavor". It's a brownie! Ha Ha

I was looking for a good recipe and am glad to have come across this one. It is simple and turned out awesome. I reduced the chocolate as did not want it too sweet. Kids loved it too. However, it did not turn out gooey or soft in the middle but I am fine with it. Will definitely be making it again and again. Thank you for this recipe. Very much appreciated.

I made these brownies for the first time today. I used 1/2 cup of 60% cacao chips and 3/4 cups of semi sweet chocolate chips. I also used 1 tsp of vanilla and added 1/2 cup of both varieties of chocolate chips to the mix before baking. I wanted a really "chocolatey" brownie and these did not disappoint. So rich and delicious! I will definitely make these again. They were so easy to make!

Honestly not bad. Pretty easy to make. Only suggestion I have is to take take out the salt and use milk chocolate to make it sweeter. It's kind of salty otherwise. Also it doesn't make a lot. So if there is more than 4 people probably plan on doubling the recipe.

I usually like a brownie about once a year, but decided to make these for my husband. If he hadn't raved, I wouldn't even have tasted them, but since he did ... This is one outstanding brownie. The flavor, the texture, even the aroma -- perfect. Now I know brownies are deserving of more than once a year; it's the boxed mixes that aren't. Never buying a box again. Thanks for the great recipe, cicada!

Excellent!  I did as others suggested with the extra chocolate chips - tossed them in a little flour then sprinkled them on top of the batter.

I have just tried this brownie recipe. Only thing I wanna change is I will put little less baking soda next time. And bake it for not 25 or 30 min. I will bake it for 22 minutes. It will be hopefully more moist and fudgy

We loved these super quick  and easy brownies.  They were rich, fudgy and delicious.  They go together as quickly as a mix, but are so much better. Next time, I will add some nuts before baking.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

My result was less brownie, and more cake squares ??. 
Everything looked perfect until edges started burning at 15min in the oven, so I lowered the heat to 300F and cooked it for 5 more min (inside was still gooey). Took it out of oven at 20min, and let it sit for 5min. Inside was no longer gooey! But bottom and edges were over cooked.

It still tasted great despite having a crumbly consistency and being super soft and spongey like cake. Gluten free is very hard to master.

Theese brownies turned out  GREAT!!!! I cut this recipe in half, I did not have chocolate chips so I put in 1/3 cups coco powder and 1/3 cups sugar and still got the chocolate flavor. I also used surup instead of vanilla extract. Theese brownies really deserve 5 stars 100%!!

I have made this recipe many times and it always turns out perfect, not once something was wrong. Whenever I have friends over I bake my so-called "secret recipe".  I usually have it with some Nutella or some melted galaxy chocolate. Make sure the batter is mixed well but do not over mix. 

They really are the "best brownies I've ever had".

These are so quick & easy! Only takes about 10 minutes to whip them up before they’re ready to pop in the oven & bake. I like to switch things up & use a mixture of milk, semi-sweet, & dark chocolate depending on what I have  on hand.

So simple and so good.  I made exactly as written but added a few walnuts.  I baked for 30 minutes. Was afraid to overbake. Should have baked longer.  Difficult to get out of the pan, crumbled up and soft in the middle.  Still tasted good. I have never made brownies before so really didn’t know what to expect.

The brownies taste amazing, but the top layer looks atrocious. Almost like mud. But besides that, I’d make it again. I’d probably use a smaller pan so that it spreads evenly. 

Another thing to know is the brownie batter isn’t really liquid like most batters, so it’s harder to put it into the pan.

Oh my gosh! I love this recipe. It was super easy to make and came out great. It's nice and fluffy, very cakey and perfect with ice cream. My husband usually prefers brownies that are more fudgey but even he had to admit how good these are. I added some extra chocolate-chips to make it nice and gooey when warmed. So good!

These brownies are fantastic!  Not to fudgey, not to cakey!  I will never used box brownies again as long as I have semi-sweet chocolate morsels on hand.  I would strongly recommend to allow the chocolate mixture to cool before adding the 2 eggs.

I came across a half-bag of semisweet chocolate chips while organizing my pantry the other day. I didn't want to throw them away (they were Whole Food organic chocolate chips, so probably cost more than I should have paid), so I searched Allrecipes.com for a recipe in which I could use them. I decided to make these brownies after reading the great reviews, and am very glad I did.

As many other reviewers have noted, this recipe is super-easy - almost as simple as using a boxed mix. I followed it to the letter (incl. 25 min. baking time) and the brownies came out perfectly. I'm not even much of a brownies person, but will hang onto this recipe for future parties, housewarming gifts, etc. (I took them along when I went to pick up my husband after he played golf; they were a huge hit with the guys in the bar.)

Made without any changes to the recipe. A bit more on the cakey than fudgy side, but they’re so tender and scrumptious. Will definitely make again.

I made this gluten free with coconut flour. I also substituted swerve for the sugar. They came out great!! Depending on what chocolate you use, the carbs are minimal for this delicious brownie. The people I served them to couldn’t believe that they were gluten free & low carb. I used an 8x8 pan. I calculated 16 carbs per square.

Delicious.  No changes.  My 4 year old made them... with a bit of help.  Easy recipe.  One pot.  Loved it!  Oh I guess I used less than a 1/2 cup of sugar.  We are reducing sugar in our diet and they were great with this reduction.  I think a person could even cut the sugar in half and they would still be fine.  Really, when using that much chocolate chips, you won't need as much sugar.  I would likely find them too sweet if I used all the sugar but, that is personal preference.

Pretty good once they've cooled off, but a bit cakier than I'd like.  Will try again baking for a few minutes less (baked for 27) and try 1/4 tsp salt.

This recipe was a big NO!  Stirring the chocolate chips into the boiling sugar mixture was a mess!  Way too dry. Not enough wet ingredients, even after adding eggs and vanilla.  Add in the dry ingredients and you’ve got a lump of brown dough -not batter.  It was difficult to spread in the pan because of that. The brownies were not a good texture and tasted like salted semi-sweet chocolate chips -not brownies. I don’t understand all the great reviews.

These brownies turned out very good. I doubled it, added 1 Tbl cocoa powder and the remaining 1/2 c. chocolate chips  in the bag to the dry ingredients, to make it more chocolatey. I will add another Tbl or 2 of cocoa next time. Everyone liked them!

These brownies turned out very rich and almost fudgy with a nice crisp outer edge.  I'll be making them again, but perhaps with a bit less sugar, or darker chocolate. I found them to be almost overwhelmingly sweet

There are so many 4.5-star rated recipes it was really kind of hard to pick one and go with it. I wanted to do things right, and by that I mean I wanted to make sure I picked a recipe that would have the right amount of sweetness but not be overpowering and full of sugar. This recipe seemed to fit the bill. The chocolate isn't super rich (surprisingly, actually) and the sweetness is definitely toned down. But it's a huge hit with my kids and my wife who are really picky about things like that. This recipe was very easy to make and it doesn't take long. I cooked them for 27 minutes. I think I could have gotten away with one or two more minutes, as the very bottom of the very center was still just a little moist. But overall, these came out perfect!

Great recipe! I followed as is except for the addition on 1/4 cup of chocolate chips mixed in to add some extra goodness.  Very fudgey and delicious!

Just wanted to say I made these today.  While the batch it makes is very small, the flavor and texture is beautiful.  I was out of liquid vegetable oil so I used vegetable shortening and just melted it in the microwave.  Also, there are two diabetics in my household so I used stevia powder instead of sugar.  They are marvelous still with the substitutions.  My diabetic family members swear its as close to "the real thing" sugar-wise as they've ever gotten.  Next time I'll have to adjust the stevia amount though as its much sweeter than sugar so they are overly sweet.  My fault not the fault of the recipe!

Brownies were gone in minutes at my house.  Easy to make. I live at high altitude and will have to make some adjustments for next time with the baking soda and eggs. However, the chocolate chips do add flavor to these brownies.

Excellent brownies if you like cakey brownies. After reading the glowing reviews I was expecting these to be a crispy crust with chocolatey chewy center but even omitting an egg still left me with a cakey brownie which are not my fave. I definitely prefer the mmm better brownie recipe

These turned out amazing! Based on some other reviews, I increased the Vanilla extract to 1 tsp and reduced the salt to 1/4 tsp. I also made sure my eggs were room temperature and added them when I added the flour mixture. My kids already finished half the pan, thanks!!!!

My guests loved it. It is very easy to make but make sure you follow directions. I messed up the first time.  ( ..... “Mix  flour, salt and baking powder together and then add to the mix.”) Also, use really good quality chocolate. It makes it really decadent.

I didn’t have semisweet chips so I used some milk chocolate chips and a heaping tablespoon of coco powder.  Everything else was according to the recipe except 3 tablespoons of water instead of 1 (because of the coco powder).

AMAZING!!!

I love this recipe! Sometimes I melt one cup of chocolate chips and then when I mix in the dry ingredients I add 1 dark chocolate chili chocolate bar chopped into chunks. I also replace the water for dark roast black coffee. Thanks for the great recipe.

Great recipe and easy to follow. I substituted the semisweet chocolate chips with a mixture of bittersweet and milk chocolate chips and upped my butter to 3 teaspoons. I also added chocolate chips to the batter and. Decorated the top with chocolate chips. It’s was truly decadent.

The mixture seemed runny, so I added 1/2 cup of flour. It made 16 2 bite brownies and a 4"x6" pan.  Topped off with peanut butter chips, they're tasty!

Wonderful brownie recipe! After the other comments about the sweetness I cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup.  I used cold brew coffee in place of water. I used 1/2 semisweet & 1/2 dark chocolate chips. I was worried about mixing the eggs in with the chocolate so I mixed them with dry ingredients. They came out great.

Best. Brownies. Ever. I make them in a 4 cup Pyrex measuring cup, microwaving the butter, water, sugar, & chocolate chips for 30 seconds at a time until melted. I let it cool for 5 mins, then add the rest of the ingredients as per the instructions. Pour into a baking pan lined with foil & sprayed with coconut oil for easy cutting & clean up once they’re baked.

This was a great recipe! Very moist and chocolatey brownies. They are not very firm, so when warm I did need to eat them with a fork, but they were definitely easy to make, came together quite quickly and were very good! I would definitely make again. They were better than a boxed brownie mix in my estimation.

These brownies are awesome.  I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet because I prefer the flavor.  I combined it with the Cheesecake Brownies recipe and they turned out GREAT!

Followed the recipe; no changes. A very delicious brownie. It was fluffy and light, but not like cake. So easy to prepare. Will make this again.

First time I've made brownies using chocolate chips instead of cocoa - they were quite good. They were so easy to make so I'll definitely be making these again.

The recipe was pretty good. You can definitely tell they’re homemade vs boxed. You can taste the chocolate chips and the richness of it, however there is something about the taste of boxed brownies that I can’t get away from.

I made these a couple times and both times it was great! I didn’t have a small enough pan but the recipe still worked fine! The brownies were a little thin but that’s ok for me.

I've made it and it's super yummy. I still can't believe that I made the same dessert two times in one week. and everyone loved it and requested the recipe. the only different thing is that I used chocolate not chocolate chips but I don't it would have made any difference in tge taste.

My crowd agreed these were absolutely the best chocolate brownies we've ever eaten.  They're a go-to now when I'm making goodies for my friends... or for myself!  And the recipe is so easy!!!

Not sure what went wrong, but the brownies were still completely under baked (soupy), and I had to add a full 16 minutes. At the end of baking the edges were puffed up and middle was sunken. As for texture, my daughter described it as spongy. Not a winner for us.

I made it and it was easy and had a rich chocolate taste. The top cracked and I googled the reason. Apparently I over baked it, so it recommended to bake for less time. I baked the recipe a second time but we used a different brand of chip morsels and decreased the baking time, this turned out a less cracked top but the gooey fudge was gone and a more dry brownie baked up. So I’m going to try the same brand from the first time around and decrease the baking time, I’ll keep you all posted!

I followed as directed. They tasted exactly like they came from a box mix. They were yummy, but the effort wasn't worth the flavor.

So simple and incredibly gourmet.  When it came out of the oven I poured about 1/2 cup (generous) of chocolate chips on top of the brownies, let sit then spread for icing and it was a delicious!

I prefer dense, gooey, fudgy brownies. This was more of a fluffy, salty kind of brownie. The semisweet chips give it a different kind of flavor - not just straight rich chocolate.

In a second batch, I was able to get a richer, less salty flavor by using unsalted butter and bittersweet chips, but it still didn't have the gooey texture I want.

Don't know why I haven't made these before now! Incredible. I made them just as written, but used a full 12 oz. of chocolate chips. I brought the sugar, butter, and water to a boil in the microwave. About as easy as a mix, but light years better!

I've made these multiple times; they are quick and always turn out great!  If you didn't have good results, try again.  Tip:  if using salted butter, don't add salt.  I always buy unsalted butter.  Check brownies often and know your oven.  Once when making two batches of these for different events I accidentally left 1/3 of a cup of flour out of one batch.  They still turned out good, just more fudgy which my family liked.  Both batches were very good!

These were super easy to make and oh my so good to eat.  The only change i made was to add 1/2 cup chopped pecans because I like nuts in my brownies.  For those that had them crumble, if you let them cool completely before cutting you can avoid this problem.  I think my oven temperature is a bit off, so I had to cook 5 extra minutes.  Highly recommend these to avoid the box chemicals and because they are 100 times better than any box mix.  Tastes like something you get at a fancy bakery.

Followed recipe exactly. Tasted good but I had a couple of the same issues as a number of the negative reviews. My chocolate seized as soon as I mixed with the butter syrup, I thought it may be because I poured the liquid over the chocolate in a glass bowl so maybe it was too cold to melt properly. A few rounds in the micro did not help so I tossed it (reluctantly) and tried again this time adding the chocolate into the warm pot of buttery sugar and still seized. I used some major elbow grease to try and mix in the eggs for a smooth texture...oh did I mention I had doubled the recipient based on all the positive reviews! The brownie puffed up very high in the oven but took 35 minutes to set enough to where there was no jiggle. Then the center totally fell and was almost a raw batter under a crusty top. The edges were nice and chewy though. Not sure this will get a second chance.

I have never made homemade brownies before.  This was so simple and delicious, I won't be buying a mix again.  I did top mine with chocolate chips and marshmallows.  I even gave this to a friend and her family loved it as well.

Loved these! They are easy to make and come out nice and dense, like a brownie should. I made a 1.5 batch for a 9 x 9 inch pan and adjusted the baking time up accordingly. I probably could have gotten away with a single batch in the same size pan, but these will look lovely iced and piled on a cake platter for dessert tonight. I'm going to keep it simple and serve them with salted caramel ice cream.

This is a really great brownie recipe for those who like simple, classic, no-frills fudgy brownies. They are very chewy, perfectly sweet, the right amount of fudginess, and super easy to make! I tried out this recipe because I was SO craving brownies, but didn't have any cocoa powder and only had some chocolate chips. I would now stick to this as an easy, quick recipe anytime I need a chocolate fix. My boyfriend LOVED them because of how soft and classic they taste! I wouldn't change a thing.

These are incredible!!! This may be the best brownie recipe I have ever tried. They came out perfectly moist and delicious. And SO easy. Even having to deal with the stove, they were still super-easy. I made a full batch then split it in half directly into two round casserole dishes. Added fresh cranberries to one and white chocolate chips to the other. It was unreal how amazing both batches turned it. This recipe should have 50 stars! Thanks for sharing it!

I love brownies.  I was looking for a fudgy brownie.  This is not it.  Not chocolaty and very cake like.  I won’t make this again.

My 10y wanted to make brownies so we searched for a recipe and came across this one. It was a very simple recipe for her and they turned out great. We did not icing them and the pan didn't make it 24hrs. They are a cakey brownie but so delicious. Thank you for sharing.

Words cannot express the love my family feels for these brownies! But I’ll try! The perfect amount of sweetness, rich chocolatiness, chewiness, density, and floofiness. It was fast to prepare and made our days of box mix a thing of the past.

So good! Topped with a green and red M&M and took 2 dozen mini cupcake size to my son's hockey game - all were gone except for 3, which I polished off after dinner. Moist, easy and made with on-hand ingredients! Amazing!!! Will never use a mix again.

My hubby had been working nearly 24 hours straight and I wanted to whip up something quick.  These came together so fast. Only, follow the directions that say cool in pan.  I wanted to turn them out while still warm and they kind of cut themselves and well, I ended up eating way more than I should have. So fudgy and yummy.

I think I made it according to directions with the exception of using a little less sugar than called for.  I did make them mini-muffin size rather than in a pan. They were sweeter than I like my brownies.

Never been a fan of brownies but this seemed easy and the family is into brownies big time.  A big hit with everyone and all I needed to buy was the chocolate since I had everything else in my cabinets.  Bought 3 more bags of chocolate for the holiday take alongs when visiting.  Forgot to mention I have that brownie pan that comes with the insert so when they're cooked you don't have to cut them.  the pan makes little squares.  Easy for me and tasty for the brownie lovers

Cautionary tale. I ruined this recipe by adding 1-2 Tablespoons of unauthorized brewed decaf. It turned the chocolate mixture into a non glossy paste and the chunks of that mixture took so much mixing to get them to incorporate into the flour that it brought out the glutens. The brownies tasted bad, and were tough and cake like with no satin top layer. Do not do.

I absolutely love these brownies! I like a fudge like brownie, so I double the butter. I also add 1/2 cup chocolate chips to the flour mixture. Delicious!!

I made these brownies and they were perfect! Made one small change only- used half the salt.  Like others have suggested; make sure you cool down the chocolate mixture before adding the eggs so that the eggs don't scramble. 
These are the best brownies ever!

I made these brownies over the weekend and they were delicious.  I took another person's suggestion and added about a 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips to the batter.  This recipe doesn't need that addition - I think it's perfect as it stands, but I wanted to mention that I did add in some chips.  Thank you so much for this recipe.

Fast brilliant brownie recipe. Semi sweet chips is a must, milk chocolate would make it too sweet, salt is always a must with chocolate. I would never modify a recipe I plan to review, as that wouldn't be an honest review, but I could see adding nuts or chocolate chunks before baking. Yum! I made the first batch as directed, so I could review it properly, but for the second one I microwaved the chocolate, butter and sugar  for expediency then mixed in the rest. Both methods worked and tasted the same. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

My go to recipe for brownies, super easy to customize and make your own as well! I like to add almond extract and amaretto to the batter, perfumes the brownies after they are done baking. Also use confectioners sugar for a more firm and more toned down sweetness.

Excellent!  I made with freshly ground soft white wheat flour so I added a half tablespoon of water.  I had also read the reviews first and decided to omit the salt and only use half the sugar (we almost always cut sugar in half).  This made a great textured and rich brownie!

This was really good and tasted really good but, when I was melting the chocolate, it all clumped together and began to burn. So I took matters into my own hands and added water. This definitely it melt. Oh yeah, and you HAVE to keep the heat on while melting the chocolate, my thing boiled and then I added the chocolate chips. But, overall, this recipe was easy and fun to make! :)

I liked this recipe, but it doesn't make very much. Overall the brownies tasted okay, but it was hard to cut because the top got really crispy witch made the inside cook much slower. I filled up my pan 3/4 up, and I had to cook it for 30 - 45 minutes.

The brownies were pretty good. However, I have discovered I prefer brownies made with cocoa powder. I prefer the fudgier flavor with that method.

Followed exactly, baked 25 minutes. It had very little sweetness and was much more like a cake than a brownie. Could benefit from frosting.

The middle was nice and gooey, but the outer edges burnt a little and were very crispy. My children loved it, I highly recommend it.

I would give these 3.5 stars if that were possible.  Made these yesterday (10/4/17).  Recipe pretty easy.  Smelled great while baking.  They have a nice crust on top and a chewy middle.  The chocolate flavor seems to be a little underwheIming and I used Ghiradelli (sp?) semi-sweet chips.   There are lots of brownie recipes out there so I will continue looking.

Loved them! I doubled the recipe without any problems.  I did have to cook them longer than suggested, and they still could have used a few more minutes. The texture was perfect, everyone who had them loved them, loved the flavor.

Terrible, the worst brownie recipe I have ever made.  I made it twice because I thought I did something wrong, but the second time came out awful too.  They are so dry and fall apart.  Don't make this recipe.

Based on others reviews, I  made a few adjustments. I doubled the recipe but only used 3/4 cup of sugar and 2 cups of chocolate chips, but added 1/4 cup of cocoa powder for more flavour. I kept the 1 tsp of salt,which seemed fine in here. These were slightly dry and cakey. Nextt ime I would use some brown sugar, and a bit more butter.

Recipe is great. What's nice about it is that a mixer is not necessary. All you need is a spatula to mix the ingredients together. 

Used a muffin pan for the mixture. Greased the pan by using a paper towel and canola oil. Doesn't matter what kind of oil to use.

Will make it again. The texture of the brownie is cake-y. Probably because of the eggs.

The recipe didn't come out as I expected. The consistency of the brownies were more cake like. I liked it but I would probably use this recipe again for when I want to do a chocolate cake.

You could make an easy cream cheese frosting and put it between layers of brownie. You could also use either half as much sugar or half as much butter.

I will definitely be making it again!

Best brownies and super easy to make! Try adding about 1/2-3/4 cup chopped maraschino cherries to the batter before baking - simply delicious and no need for icing!

I made these to take to a friend's house for dinner. We all took a big bite, paused, and went, "wow. These are not good."

The only changes I made were:
1) I used dark chocolate féves instead of semisweet chips
2) I sprinkled some extra féves into the batter (as other reviewers mentioned doing)
3) I used a 6x8 pan.

I kept double and triple checking the ingredients and measurements bc there didn't seem to be anywhere near enough liquids, but they were so highly reviewed that I just went with it. They were truly awful. I'm assuming it was my error since they are so well-reviewed but I genuinely can't figure out where I  went wrong. They were salty, crumbled in the middle, dry, bitter. Honestly and truly the worst brownies I've ever tasted. If someone can figure out my mistake, please post it!!

After multiple tries, I used 1/2 semi sweet chocolate chips and 1/2 milk chocolate chips and found the perfect combination.

I liked this recipe, but there are some flaws.  The brownies turned out more cake like then i wanted them to be and there is too much salt.  Overall the flavor is good but I wish they were more fudge like.

Best brownie recipe. I add the chocolate chips that are leftover in the bag to the batter right before it goes in the pan. These brownies do not last long in our house.

Not that this recipe needs additional praise for how ridiculously good it is, but they were really that delicious!  Just be forewarned that it may seem like the recipe is incorrect while making it because the batter is extremely thick, but this is what makes them so yummy!  Per other reviews, I cut back on the eggs and used 3 for a double batch and they came out perfectly!  This one is a keeper!

Amazing!
I also added a bit of nutmeg and cinnamon, and, i only added 3/4 of the chocolate chips to melt in the water-butter-sugar mixture; and then i let it cool down and then i added the rest of the chocolate chips for texture.

My favorite brownies are from the Pillsbury mix. I read the review stating that they tasted like a mix, and expected them to taste that way, so I was a little disappointed when they didn't. They're VERY chocolatey. I doubled the recipe, so my kids could eat some of the mix. They liked it, but not as much as the brownies we usually make. 
I made these, because we didn't have any mixes in the house, and had all these ingredients. We probably won't be making them again.

This was so easy. I have tried to make brownies so many times before, but they always came up just short of perfect. To finally have them just perfect is a dream and rope in the fact that they are so simple to make is just the icing on the brownie :)

I followed the recipe but the brownies turned out very heavy and dry. I didn't over bake them (25 mins in 8x8 pan). It seems like there was way too much chocolate as after adding the 1.5 cups of chips (which seemed way too much at the time), the mixture was more of a paste than a batter. Maybe I did something wrong but I won't be making these again.

I would definitely make them again.  I made them exactly as the recipe called for.  They are the perfect consistency, not too fudgy, not too cake like.  Next time I will add some walnuts but that is the only change I'll make.  Much better than a boxed mix.

These had a very gooey texture. I don't understand how some people here can have really fudgy brownies while others complain they were too dry and cakey. I guess it's all in the cooking time. 

But I cooked them for 25 min and they were still undone in the center so I let them go another 5 minutes and the top was almost burned and the middle was still gooey. After they cooled the texture was fine (except for the extra crispy top), but the taste was nothing to write home about.

Also the chocolate seized when adding to the hot liquid but I saved it by keeping calm, whipping the heck out of it and carrying on. 

The worst part: way too salty. I knew better but I wanted to follow the recipe. Might try these again using what I've learned to tweak if all I have are chocolate chips in the house.

The flavor was good, but a bit cake-like for my family.  We like "gooier" brownies

I didn't believe the reviews that said it was flavorless, but it really was.  It wasn't sweet either.  I was shocked because the recipe contains so many chocolate chips.
Disappointed!

These are seriously perfect! I used 400g of dark chocolate (all I had).... Baked in an individual mini cake pan(makes 12)...about the size of cupcakes...baked for about 10-11 minutes. The best...even days later!

I tried this out and cut it to 11 servings bc I only had 1c of choc chips at home.  These were really easy to make, baked it for a total of about 25 mins, they came out great.  My only issue was bc I adjusted the servings, my measurements were weird, like 1.5 eggs - so ended up using 2 and my brownies ended up cake-like. but still good.  Going to try this again with the right measurements and am sure it will be even better!

Very good. I would make them again. I sprinkled some coffee grounds on top and made the brownies even better. I put 2 cups of chocolate chips instead of 1 1/2. I used Pam cooking spray to grease the pan and they came out of the pan really easy

Holy cow.....  I deleted the other brownie recipes from my favorites after we went through a pan of THESE in just 2 days.  And we were shocked when they were gone?  Seriously, the SO grieved when he saw the empty pan.  Will probably spend the next 5 days drinking Atkins shakes in a pair of stretch pants while I put up some serious Pilates.  I don't know whether I should say thanks for sharing this recipe OR deleting the AR app from my phone and never seeing this recipe again...  who am I kidding, I'm making these again this weekend- with pecans!  Thank you!

Made this recipe exactly as listed, and the brownies it made were absolutely incredible! Moist, chocolatey, and super easy to make too, which is a godsend for someone like me who doesn't bake often. So thankful my Mom sent me this recipe - can't wait to make the next batch!

UPDATE:
Okay, so we just made the adjusted brownies. Definitely much fudgier and flatter without the second egg. We agreed, my partner needs to increase the bake time by about five minutes but overall a super fudgey brownie. Extremely rich and gooey so these may not be for you the way we adjusted them. Next will be a batch with cinnamon and a batch with coffee. Before the update...first time making them: OMG!!!!!!! Probably THE best brownie recipe we have found yet. For a few years now we have been trying to find a non-mix or box replacement that we could make from scratch. This is IT!!
Tried this recipe the other night and other than the fact that they came out a bit cakier than we like, they were fantastic. Tonight we are making them again with only one egg and a mix of Hershey's and Ghirardelli Chocolates. We are hoping using one less egg will make them fudgier and flatter. Fingers crossed.
All in all a great brownie recipe.

there aren't boxed mixes where I live, so most baked goods are made the old-fashioned way. ;)

Nice, moist.  I cut the sugar in half and the brownies were still sweet. I served them with yogurt and fresh raspberries.

They didn't blow me away to be honest... I kinda like using cocoa powder better, or maybe it was just this recipe. Also they required longer baking time but I'm using an oven in my new apartment that I've never used... Hopefully it's not the oven's fault.

I always make a double batch. I've sent them to school with my son for a holiday treat, I brought them to a friend's for a Christmas party and they were quickly requested the next time I visited. I will make them again this weekend for my son's birthday party.

I loved how this turned out! They were like the perfect brownies...not too cakey, not too fudgey...I would suggest on adding just a little bit of cholate

I thought these were just ok. I followed the directions exactly, but the batter was way too thick and I had to add more water just to be able to stir in the flour. Then they took nearly 45 minutes to cook, and were still not cooked in the middle. The flavor was good, but nothing special, and not as good as my regular recipe. I won't make these again.

They're fine, most people seem to love them based on reviews. The only changes I made were adding a good sized spoonful of natural peanut butter, and sprinkling some white chips and Skor bits on top. I used a combo of bittersweet baking squares and chips.  I'm not a fan of cake-like brownies, so maybe I should have watched them better in the oven?? Won't make again.

The first time I made this I baked it for exactly 25 minutes because of all the reviews saying not to overcook it.  It came out very fudgy and gooey.  It also fell in the middle. I ended up throwing that batch away.  I tried the recipe again but baked it for 35 minutes and it came out perfect for us.  At 35 minutes the brownies are more on the cake-like side and the toothpick inserted in the center came out clean.  I added 1/2 cup of pecans and crumbled bacon to the second batch.  My husband loves them.

Delicious and easy! I added some mandarins and macadamia nuts and topped them with a little zest. Also, I made them in cupcake cups. They got rave reviews!

UPDATE: I've been practicing vegan cooking, so I again made this recipe replacing the eggs with 2 T flax meal + 6 T water whisked into a gel and the butter with vegan butter (an oil and lecithin blend). Again, chewy, gooey...rave reviews!

This was easy to make, but it fell quite a bit in the middle. So disappointing! I live at a high altitude so I wonder if that affected it. Definitely won't be using this recipe again.

Absolutely delicious!  I made as written with the omission of the salt. These are fudgey brownies, not cake like. Will have to double  the batch next time!

I agree, I am never going back to the boxed brownie mix! I followed the recipe and they came out so DELICIOUS!! So addicting...my mouth and tummy were so happy. Definitely give them a try.

These were very good.  I was super skeptical as it didn't seem like there was nearly enough liquid in here to start, and I ran into an issue when I tried to add the chocolate chips in batches -- I had to return the pan to heat to get enough to melt all the chocolate chips -- but they turned out very good.  Very fudge-like and chocolate-y at the same time.

This turned out WONDERFUL! I can't have any gluten so I used gluten free all purpose flour instead but followed the directions to a "T". Wow!!! Perfection! I didn't have a 9" square so just used a 9" cake pan.

Very AWESOME Recipe!!! I had made these three time already and will make this recipe many more times in the future.  I printed it out and put it in my recipe binder.  Also these brownies are Way Better than the boxed brownies and very simple to make.  Something optional to add would be 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder  (added to the flour mix) to help the brownies rise a bit.  You still get that chewy brownie and same great taste.

I was craving brownies but had no mix and no cocoa powder so I found this recipe. OMG- I have finally made perfect brownies!  I followed the recipe almost exactly- only change was to add 1/2 cup of chocolate chips to batter because  that is what is left in bag after melting the 1 1/2 cups of chips so why not? So freaking good.

The texture was perfect, but these brownies were not rich enough for me, which is surprising because of the melted chocolate chips.   I might try more chocolate or sugar next time.

Really awesome turnout! Though I ended up wanting more butter and water, just didn't seem like enough? And I replaced baking soda with baking powder* less airy.. Stays chewy longer if you don't eat the whole pan in one night lol !

These tasted great, but were somewhat dry/crumbly. I think I slightly overbaked them, even though they were in for 25 minutes. Next time, I will check them around 20 minutes. This recipe is a keeper nonetheless!

Edit: Lowered the temperature  to 320 and baked for 25 minutes - PERFECT! This is finally the perfect brownie recipe I've been searching for!!

So yummmmmy!!!!!! Only change I made was reducing the chips to about 1c. and sprinkled 1/4c. (dusted in flour) on the top before placing in the oven! Also added chopped walnuts.  Not too sweet, great flavor!!!  Can't go back to boxed mixes after this!

These are delicious and easy...didn't change a thing (well, added more vanilla because I just don't think there is such a thing as "too much"). Like other reviewers, I tempered the eggs with some of the chocolate...AMAZING!!

I doubled the recipe and baked in 9X13 pan. I made with Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate. I used brewed coffee for the water and, of course, I cut the salt by half !
I loved the ease of making these brownies. Only 1 saucepan, a whisk and a spatula were needed. It took 10 minutes of prep and about 35 minutes of baking (double recipe). Now, the best part was biting into a piece of these  chocolaty, chewy goodness..Be warned, it will be hard to stop at 1 piece !

This is definitely the best brownie I have ever had. It is the perfect texture: fudgey, which I LOVE. I made the other recipe labeled as the best and it had 7,000 reviews. However, I def did not see it as the best, it was more cake like which is not what I look for when I am eating brownies. Everyone in my family gave this recipe a thumps up, so I will be sticking with this.

I loved this recipe!!!! I really dislike fudgey brownies especially if they are so fudgey they feel undercooked. But these were perfectly cooked all the way through! So light and fluffy and chocolatey.  I am a person that loves dark chocolate where my cakes and brownies are almost black so this recipe full filled my every need. The only things I eliminated from the recipe were the salt and vanilla everything else stayed exactly the same. I will be making these once a week!!

FANTASTIC!!  Not another word is needed. I also make them with milk chocolate chips, and peanut butter chips. My husband prefers the milk chocolate and I prefer the peanut butter.

The recipe was very easy to make, and the brownies turned out great. I'm only giving a three star review because we prefer chewy brownies and these didn't quite make it. Still, not bad.

These brownies taste wonderful!  Mine took 35-40 minutes to bake, partially because I used a glass pan and partially because my oven is kind of weak.  Possibly because of this or maybe because of an issue in the recipe, these brownies were very very crumbly.

I made 24 servings of these as the recipe called for. They were great! Not too dry not too greasy. The only thing I would change is the chocolate chips. The recipe calls for semi sweet chips and I find those some what bitter. I made them and they were sweet enough but to really top it off next time I plan to use half semi sweet half milk chocolate chips. Easy to bake easy to cut. They had a good texture and nice light  layer on the top. I used a 9x13 pan with cooking paper instead of foil or grease. Definitely plan to make these again!

This is the perfect brownie recipe. I don't know how it would be messed up unless you stir the flour too much. I followed the recipe exactly. I baked it about 21 minutes or until the middle is not liquidy. The edges are chewy and the middle is gooey just like brownies should be.

Just what I was looking for! Not too fudgee nor too fluffy. I slightly messed up the process, but the recipe was very forgiving and no one ever knew. I just wish I had made more - these were gone so quick I didn't even get a photo!

I love this recipe. I always mess up the box recipies and that made me very intimidated by homemade brownies, but this recipe is so easy to make and they always turn out perfect! 
Although, I did switch it up for my personal taste. Instead of using semi-sweet morsels,  I used dark chocolate morsels (nestle toll house 53%) and it tasted much richer, but less sugary. It's been a huge hit with my family.

Followed the instructions to a tee and these came out very dry and crumbly. Almost chokes you on the way down it's so dry. Will be looking for a better recipe.

Absolutely NO MORE boxed mixes! This recipe was perfect - light flaky top layer. Brownie was slightly cakey, with a fudgy center.  So chocolatey and delicious!!

This recipe is Excellent!! I will never make brownies from a box again! My hubby is a diabetic but he still enjoys a sweet treat now and then so when I bake for him, I use Splenda in place of sugar. My 3 yr old grand daughter & I made a triple batch this morning! I used Splenda in place of the sugar and also omitted 1/4 c (figuring the chocolate chips would be plenty sweet) and also omitted some of the salt (only used 1 1/8 teaspoon for our triple batch).  Our brownies turned out EXCELLENT & my grand daughter was very proud of herself ;)
The texture of the brownies is perfect and better than a box mix. I have to say, using semi sweet chocolate chips is so much easier and better than using cocoa powder! Thank you so much for sharing your recipe! It is definitely a keeper and will be made often in our home.

This was great and so easy to make. I discovered I loved cooking just by making some brownies from a box. Ever since then I wanted to make much better ones from scratch. When I found this recipe, I was so happy! It is very easy and delicious. The only thing I did that changed the experience was adding on more time. I stuck a toothpick in several times before it came out clean. So I used 37 minutes instead of 25 or 30. Still, great recipe!

Added 3 tablespoons warm strong coffee to the melted chocolate. Resulted in increased moisture and fudgier consistency after cooling.

Followed the recipe and they came out delicious !!!! Using 3/4 of a bag of semi sweet chocolate chips however makes this recipe a little more expensive than grabbing a box of brownie mix on sale for $1. All in all was very pleased with the results.

I made this for my family and they thought it was great! The brownie was amazing, but it didn't have the chewiness that I expected. It's a keeper:) It doesn't need icing, but tasted good with some vanilla ice crea,

Amazing! The kids said "Best brownies ever!" And, the only flour I had was whole wheat, and they didn't even notice. Bonus! My only thoughts... with the chocolate chips having so much sugar already, I think it ended up being too sweet for me.  I will do less sugar next time. Soooo good and not full of junk and preservatives that are in the boxed brownies. Thank you!

These brownies are fantastic. Made them tonight and my husband and I loved them. Very easy to throw together. Will definitely  make these again! I read that someone suggested omitting the salt. I highly diagree! I probably added a little extra salt and loved it.

It opens the door to possibilities. i would add and extra egg and 1/3 cup more flour, and see if it could be used as a type of turnover pastry doe, stuffed with either a semi sweet fruit favor preservative cream , or a chocolate type cream using sweetened condensed milk. also it awakens the taste buds, maybe some allspice and nutmeg.

Yum! These are great as long as you like chocolate.  They are rich.  Due to many saying these are too sweet, I used dark chocolate chips and reduced the sugar by a tablespoon and they were great.
Will certainly be making these again.

Very easy and perfect amounts of chewy, flaky, and fluffy. I may try is with chocolate chips mixed in before it goes in the oven to get chocolate chip fudge brownies next time.  Yum.

Turned out great!  Very easy to make.  I used a double boiler to melt everything, it kept the mixture from being to hot so you could add the eggs with no problem.  Best brownie recipe I've tried in a long time.

Delicious! I doubled the recipe and baked in 13x9 pan for 35 minutes. I had intended on adding a tsp of coffee for a richer taste but I forgot. I'm glad I did because it didn't need it. Very rich and moist. Five stars for taste and easy prep.

First of all, the recipe is super easy to follow! I only modified it by adding walnuts and I endured that I added them towards the end, making sure that I chopped them some by hand (I'm lazy). I left it in the oven for 25 minutes as I was afraid to over bake as the recipe advises not to do. The finished product looks and smells amazing. They rose nicely and appears to have a great crisp without losing the chocolate smoothness. I'm waiting until they cool to eat one but I'm so tempted to dive right in, that's how amazing they look! This may be my go to recipe for brownies which have always been an issue for me!

These tasted like salty, melted chocolate chips. I ended up cooking for 40 minutes & the center was still gooey. Too rich for my family's taste.

 Update:
Tried again today with just a pinch of salt. Less salty, but same gooey results.

The best and easiest brownies I have ever made! I made these for a friend and tried one after they came out of the oven. These are delicious! So much faster than boxed brownies and less calories! I had to make another batch, they were that good! I wouldn't change a thing! I added walnuts the second time. These are just amazing!

Well, my husband liked them so much that he asked me to never use boxed brownies again! They're so good and so easy to make. We had some friends over and she doesn't like broenies, but she ate about three herself, her daughter and husband cleaned us out! Definitely a keeper.

I love to bake and I am pretty good at it. I made this recipe because of all the great reviews. I followed this recipe to a T and they taste more like cake than a brownie. I am disappointed not only because I wanted to bring this to a party and refuse because they are not that good. It tastes like chocolate cake but looks like a brownie. So if that's the taste your going for, make them. I would have had a better outcome using a box but I like to cook everything from scratch and thought I would try something new. I would never make it again.

The brownies turned out very cake like and dry. I remade them a few times thinking I did something wrong and it was always the same. I would recommend oil instead of butter to help make it less dry and dense. I would honestly have thought this was cake if it was frosted.

Did not care for it and I'm not a picky dessert person at all. Cake consistency, weird flavor. Followed the recipe exactly. It dissolved into my mouth. Just tastes like chocolate chips. No one in my family ate this.

I made these today following directions exactly, but in the end added some chopped  walnuts. The pan turned out yummy and cake like. Had the brownies been more fudgey and chewy (my preference) I would have given 5 stars instead of 4. I don't know if it's my oven but they were done in 19 minutes and came out moist. The flavor is intense chocolate and way better than using the cocoa powder. I was concerned the eggs would scramble when I added them to the fudge but they didn't. I can't eat a brownie without nuts so added the walnuts in at the very end and it worked perfectly. Will be making these again since I always have all the ingredients in my cupboard.

Yes, yes, yes! These are beyond good! I make these gluten free (I use Pamela's bread mix) and it's great. There's not a lot of flour in this recipe, so it works really well for gluten free brownies. I add an extra yolk (I find that's the trick when baking gluten free).

These brownies are great! I had dark chocolate kisses on hand, so I used those instead of semi sweet chips.   The brownies were still sweet enough and super yummy.

I have never made brownies before and was so pleased with how this turned out.  The brownies were very moist with a wonderful chocolate flavor and while they are decadent i did not think they were overly sweet. Secondly, while i didn't read every review i was surprised that no one added peanut butter. I would strongly advise adding this. I added two heaping tablespoons of chunky pb and baked 25 minutes and these turned out scrumptious. This recipe is  definitely a keeper. I think the next time  i will pair this with raspberry sauce drizzled over a good vanilla ice cream mm give me some.

These were absolutely delicious!  I will not purchase another box of brownie mix!!!  There is not a need for that after making this moist recipe.  My 8 year old daughter and I made these for my husband on Father's Day yesterday, and they were a HIT!!

Awesome brownies.  The only oil I had was coconut oil but it was very tasty. When you mixed it is far thicker than what I am used to. I had to butter my hands to get it level in the dish.
Great brownies!

I just made these and had to get on here and write a review because I was so happy with them! First, I usually bake everything from scratch, but I have always been in love with boxed brownies because of the perfect texture/flavor. But I don't love all the additives and preservatives. This brownie recipe is a perfect match and I will never buy boxed brownies again!!! Seriously. Wouldn't change a thing. They are PERFECT!

I used extra dark chocolate for the brownies and the flavor was good but they turned out a bit dry. I will try adding two tbsp of coconut oil next time.

I was looking for a dessert to carry to a pot luck dessert table. This used pantry staples I already had, so that's why I made it. I followed the advice of others and cut the salt down to 1/4 tsp. I also frosted these with Brownie Frosting from this site. Rich and decadent and dark chocolate! The funny thing is that these frosted brownies tasted better the next day.

These brownies are out of control good. Like others, I added the remaining chocolate chips at the end and they are so gooey. Would probably reduce the sugar slightly next time unless serving with ice cream.

Quick, easy, and the perfect fudgy brownie to beat a craving. I use the microwave for the melting, using a Pyrex bowl & then mix everything right into the bowl. Seriously you should already have everything in the pantry already. Thirty minutes start to finish then chocolate bliss face.

I am not a big fan of brownies or chocolate at all, but this recipe was amazing! It was very easy to make and I followed the instructions exactly as in the recipe.  I baked it for 25 minutes and it turned out great, not too fudgy or too dry.  I additionally made a chocolate toffee topping with half can of condensed milk and 1 tablespoon of powedered chocolate.  It was just great!

I followed this recipe exactly and it was amazing! The brownies come out fudgey and not greasy like other, butter filled brownie recipes tend to be. This is by far my favorite!

Yum yum yum! These are perfectly fudgy, chewy brownies with the classic "crackle top". WAY too much salt in this recipe though (and I love salted sweets). If using salted butter, I would omit the salt or at MOST do a 1/4 tsp. I generally use salted butter so next time I will leave out the the salt.

"Mmmm" indeed!! These turned out to be super moist and soft. VERY, VERY chocolatey and completely satisfying! It really hits the spot of any chocolate cravings. I baked mine for a little under 25 minutes, and it was perfect!

If you prefer the really fudgy and gooey brownies, maybe try a different recipe. I've been a fan of Brooke's Bombshell Brownies, but I'll definitely be making this recipe again!

Sorry to say, but this is the worst brownie that I have ever made. This does not taste like brownies at all, and it is more like dark chocolate. I have followed every single ingredients listed on this recipe and did not substitute anything.

Very surprised at how nice these turned out!!  Followed recipe exactly except that I made a double batch.  Baked 42 minutes and came out perfect.  We had a group of friends over and they loved them as well and couldn't believe how they were made.  Will definitely make again.

These brownies turned out so beautifully! They were luscious and rich without being dense. I had to cook mine for the full 30 minutes to get the clean toothpick result. I also added 1 teaspoon of instant coffee to the batter when I added the vanilla - it really brings out the chocolate flavor with anything you're baking. We paired ours with frozen yogurt and some whipped cream and they were wonderful :)

Because it's Easter, I added chocolate eggs inside and got an amazing outcome. I loved the recipe, except I replaced white sugar with stevia sugar and put cocoa powder instead of vanilla extract. Delicious!

This has been my go-to brownie recipe since the first time I tried it. And every time I make them I have to do a double batch, beacuse the smell attracts everyone in my house  & otherwise there wouldn't be leftovers.

Great recipe. VERY RICH brownies. I added 1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate morsels to the batter for chunks as another reviewer suggested and they were wayyyyyy too rich, so I'll skip that next time. Temper the eggs before adding to hot melted chocolate. This recipe is NOT like the box kind, it's MUCH BETTER!

These are the chocolatey-est, fudgiest, moistest brownies ever. I love that they are made with chocolate chips, and I always have all these basic ingredients on hand. I also like that it makes a smaller quantity, not a 9 x 13.  Try it, you'll never buy boxed Brownie mix again!

Very easy recipe. I made mine vegan & gluten free. I used Egg Replacer instead of eggs, and then I substituted the flour with Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Flour plus 1/4 + 1/8 teaspoon xantham gum. My very omnivore 19 year old son devoured it.

Great simple recipe. The brownies turned out to be delicious. 

I just heated the butter, water and sugar in the microwave, stirring every 15 seconds. Still turned out to be good.

The best brownies I have ever made! These things are great and always turn out! Instead of water, I substituted coffee (which is something I often do when making chocolate baked goods to bring out the taste of the chocolate), that's the only change I made and they are always absolutely delicious!

I didn't have semisweet chips, so I used 3/4 dark chocolate chips and 1/4 white chocolate chips (and topped the brownies with white chocolate chips). Made the mistake of slightly overbaking, so they were a bit cakey, but would've been perfect with a few minutes shaved off of the cooking time.

Already made them twice, and although both times I had to tweak the recipe slightly for the lack of ingredients (first time I used milk chocolate and brown sugar, second time I replaced butter with vegetable oil and used less chocolate), they turned out perfect. From now on this is the only brownie recipe I will use.

The brownies were OK, but lacked sweetness. If I made this again, I would add more sugar and double the recipe.  The brownies were very thin and the recipe did not make a lot of batter.

The only change is to add walnuts or pecans ...clearly.  My husband didn't like my mom's tried and true brownie recipe, so I went on a quest.  25 recipes later, he says, "This is the one!"  I have to agree . . ..

I followed the recipe exactly and to me, these brownies did not have much flavor. They also had more of a cakelike cosistency instead of a brownie consistency. I guess if I were to make them again , which i dont think i will, I would add additional chocolate chips (unmelted) to the batter before putting into the pan to bake just for additional flavor and texture which I feel this recipe is lacking.

Won't be making these again.  Texture was odd and crumbled when cut. Yes they were throughly cooled. Even the husband who loves brownies said no thanks.

Great recipe! Pretty quick to mix, as well. I'll admit I was skeptical, because my melted chocolate chips were not very "smooth" and the batter overall seemed dry. But...wow! I was surprised! Absolutely the BEST fudgy brownies I've ever baked!  8x8, 35 mins @ 325°. This will be my go-to from now on! Thank you for sharing!

These were perfect even with my small additional ingredients. I added .5 more chocolate chips inside of the batter as well as the top. I also added 7 oz of fresh made lowfat plain greek yogurt and 1 whole cup of flour plus 1/3 cup of pure cocoa powder. Just delicious. Never using a mix again either. Nuts next batch! Thanks!

Best brownies ever! I made them to say thank you to a coworker who liked chunky brownies so I followed one of the other recipes that mentioned a way to add extra chocolate chips by adding a little bit of flour to them and then adding them to the mix once it has cooled down this works beautifully thanks again!

Super tasty brownie! You don't get the powder chunks like you often do with powdered cocoa. I used 4 tbs of butter to melt the chocolate chips instead of the water. I added about a half cup of chocolate chips into the batter. I like the little globs of chocolate. I also used a small cookie sheet to bake them. It only takes 20 minutes...and it's good if you need a bunch of small brownies. I will absolutely use this as my go to brownie recipe.

These are awesome. I had to make a few changes because I only had 1/2 cup of semisweet chips. I used a cup of white chocolate chips with the semisweet and added a little cocoa powder (2 or 3 tbsp) to the sugar mixture. I reduced the salt to 1/4 tsp since I used salted butter, and baked for 35 min. They are absolutely delicious!! Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful recipe! Allergic to nuts, so I use chocolate chips instead! The recipe is great as is so I have been playing with it a bit on my own and have had a lot of fun playing with such a perfect recipe! Absolutely yummy!

This is the brownie recipe I've been looking for!! No more box mix for this girl!! Perfect texture. Chocolatey and fudgey. That nice crust on top... The only thing I did was decrease the salt by half, based on other reviews. I may use a combination of semi-sweet and dark chocolate, just to see how it turns out. This would be amazing with some peanut butter chips!! *drool* Thanks for a great base recipe!

Wow... Absolutely the best brownies! I didn't have a 8x8 pan so I made cupcake brownies but I followed the recipe exactly. I divided the batter into 10 rather than 12 cupcakes and baked for 13-15-ish minutes at about 300 degrees. They turned out amazing, nice chewy edges and gooey center. Soooooo good!

Wow. I only wish I had had chopped walnuts to stir in, these are incredible! And I am a connoisseur. I had extra Scharffen-berger chocolate chips handy, so I was hoping to find a brownie recipe using chocolate chips (I've used 100% bar chocolate before, but not chocolate chips...). These are the perfect brownies. They actually melt in your mouth. Very light, which is a dangerous deception in terms of calories! Yet perfectly decadent. LOVED these.

I made homemade brownies for the first time for Thanksgiving. I made them exactly to the recipe. I am not a chocolate eater. Made them for my boyfriend and mother. My mother was upset that I didn't give her more. They were nice and moist. So, I think they were a hit! I'd like to try them with milk chocolate morsels instead of semisweet chips. Stay tuned!

I won't make this again without making the following changes: the water in the sugar, butter salt, water  part makes the chocolate seize up. I had to put it back over very low heat after adding the eggs to melt the chocolate. Would eliminate water and use 4T butter  total instead as even after 25 minutes (minimum) brownies were dry. Also would reduce salt by half.  Very good chocolate flavor.

The recipe is peculiar b/c it only calls for 2 tbn of butter and you  boil the butter/water/sugar mixture.  I don't know what the purpose of this is, but the recipe was definitely not lacking. My husband loves chewy brownies.  Like extremely dense and chewy.  I did a little googling (I don't know how the world functioned before the internet...was that what they called the Dark Ages?) and found out that that for optimal chew you need to use less egg (so I did one large egg and one egg yolk), no baking soda, banged the pan on the counter (to release the trapped air), and chilled in the fridge for an hour after baking.  and since I used a pyrex dish, I made sure to line it with buttered aluminum before adding the batter, so that I could simply lift the brownie out to cool after baking and prevent the retained heat in the pyrex from overcooking my brownies.  I cut after the brownies had chilled, and it was similar to the texture of those "love and quiches" brownies I used to get complimentary on flights...if not denser.  

I've tried many of the best recipes on this site, and so far this one is the best.  Crazy that it is also one of the simplest and (relatively) healthiest.  In the future, I want to try the recipe again with 1/4 tsn salt, 1 tsn vanilla, and 1/2 a.p. flour.  That last alteration should make the brownies even denser.

I love these brownies, the best I've ever made & so easy.  I usually mix dark chocolate and milk chocolate chips & double the recipe.  I like to put treats inside too, be it scattered nuts or flavored m & m's. I will NEVER make  boxed brownies again either.

first off anyone who didn't give this recipe and five star is not a true chocolate lover. I followed the recipe as is. I did add  1/2  cup of chocolate chips right before putting it in the oven. Thank you for that amazing recipe my family loved it !

Awesome recipe! No changes needed and perfect as is. I used mini semi sweet chocolate chips and they melted even faster.  Can't say I have made brownies from a box since coming across this recipe.

These are oogy gooy fudgy brownies. They aren't dry or cake-like at all. I added a bit of chili cocoa to my mix. They are super delicious and fun to make :)

This is an amazing  recipe but I add baking powder instead of baking soda mainly because I think it makes them to salty, Instead of boiling the sugar,butter and water in a pan. I  do a double boiler and  fully mixed(I don't let it boil) then mix the chocolate and vanilla together then before the chocolate dries out  I add in the eggs and then the rest of the dry ingredients. 
Beside that they are the best brownies I have made at home, my whole family ask me to make them all the time.


 (side note have the eggs at room temp for 20-30 min before baking make the eggs fluff up in the batter)

okay these are good!  I did make a couple changes, I made these with dark chocolate chips, which cut the sweetness a little and doubled the batch to a 13x2x8 pan, but ohh so good, and very easy to make!

These were not good.  I think it was the semisweet chocolate chips.  These tasted  like a bitter, but really chocolaty cake. The flavor and texture were just bad. I would never make these again.

Good.  Simple.  Not too sweet.  Definitely a keeper.
When doubling the recipe, use a 9"x13" pan.  I line mine with parchment paper for quick removal.

These came out great! Due to reviewer tips, I reduced the salt to 1/4 tsp and could still taste it a bit. Next time just a pinch and it will be perfect.

This is the best brownie recipie I have ever come across! Amazing flavor and texture! I wanted my brownies a little gooey, so I only cooked them for 24 minutes, and they were awesome! I would suggest reducing the salt amount to 1/4 teaspoon though......

I loved loved loved this recipe!  I tried another recipe that used cocoa powder and it was way to sweet with very little chocolate flavor.  The semi-sweet chocolate chips deepen the chocolate flavor without it being overwhelmingly sweet.  I will definitely make again and double the batch!

Side note:  I have an electric stove and so I had to adjust my time downward to about 15 mins.

I made this for my husband and I, and overall very yummy and easy! My husband is not a fan of dark chocolate though, and he said it tasted a little bitter-I'm thinking maybe add some milk or butter next time? I however loved the chewy chocolatey-ness of these brownies. They have been quite the sinful indulgence of mine for the past few days :)

OMG THIS WAS THE MOST AMAZING RECIPE EVER!!!!!!!!!!! I've now made them dozens of times and every time they flew. Two tips--One, melt the butter a bit before mixing it in with the pan, and Two, mix in the chocolate over low heat, same with the egg mixture. It will make it smoother and easier to mix. And yes, don't over bake. Even if the brownies don't look done, they'll set more as they cool. And trust me, you want theses fudgy.

These were great!  I was skeptical of the chocolate chips as the only source of chocolatey goodness, but the brownies were moist inside with a crispier top.  They also weren't too heavy, like a fudgy brownie.  I will definitely make these again!  I followed the recipe exactly as written, but doubled it and put it in a 9x13 glass pan.  YUM!

I tried this recipe three times, followed the recipe exactly and they were just not very good. Way too soggy and my oven is calibrated. I even used glass and metal pans for comparison. I wish they would've turned out better. I could've turned them into cake pops as mushy as they were, but I wanted brownies and not cake pops. I'm not sure what I did wrong.

These brownies are chewy, which I like. But the top of the brownies comes out very dry and crusty, which I didn't like. I also thought that they weren't chocolatey enough.

"I hope you never buy a brownie mix again!" - said my husband.  I didn't change anything.  I doubled it and baked them in a 13x9 pan for approximately 35 minutes.  Fabulous!  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

These are THE BEST brownies I have ever made.  I bake for a living from my home and made 2 double recipes of these as part of a dessert table.  People were falling over themselves they loved them so much.  I have made them many times since then and EVERYONE loves them. They have such a creamy yet fluffy texture.  I did not alter the recipe in any way, other than doubling it and baking it in a 9x13 pan.  Doing this, I baked at 325 F for 30 minutes.  DO NOT OVER BAKE!! 25 mins max for the 8x8 pan and single recipe.  30 mins max for the 9x13 double recipe.  Also, use good chocolate chips.  Ghirradelle (sp?) is my go to brand.  I used Hersheys once and they did not come out as good.  I was kicking myself for wanting to save $1.  This recipe, although harder than the mix of course, is not that difficult.  The result is brownies in a different stratosphere. Don't be deterred by the critics and belly ache-ers.  This recipe is legit!

I made these today, and just tasted one. They are great!!! I just wish I knew how to cut brownies cleanly without them falling apart!!! 

I made these again on 2-8-16. Even better this time! They are just the best!!!! I used semi sweet chocolate chips. I allowed them to cool at room temp., and then refrigerated them for about 2 hrs. before cutting. They cut more easily this time.

OMG.I did'nt think it was possible but I can finally stop buying brownie box mixes.I did cut the salt to one eighth teaspoon and the splash of Kahlua was a good suggestion,it really enhanced the chocolate flavor.I'm so thrilled to have found such a great recipe.Make these brownies,you will not be disappointed.

No more boxed brownies for me and my husband.  They were perfect and just so easy to make.  If you don't like these brownies you don't like brownies. I never knew brownies could be so easy to make and taste so delicious.

Absolutely delicious! I did use Special Dark chocolate chips (that is what I had on hand). I also added a splash of Kahlua like others, but I added it along with the water. I also beat the eggs, let the chocolate cool a bit and added the eggs a little bit at a time since I was worried about getting scrambled eggs in my batter. Didn't have an 8x8 pan so I used a pie pan. If you guys are like me and don't like to wait for brownies and are also a neat freak, cut the brownies with a plastic knife.

Followed this recipe pretty much exactly as written, except I only had 9"x9" pan and I mixed in 1/2 cup of walnuts. I baked at 325* for 25 minutes. They are delicious! Super easy and quick to make.

These are very rich and chocolaty.  Didn't have that 'brownie' signature taste that I love.  Just a good chocolaty dessert.  I made brownie sundaes and they were a hit.

Yummy and super easy!!!
I use a whole bag of chocolate chips in mine. I use the cup and a half recommended for the brownie part, then add the rest into the batter just before I put it in the pan.  YUM YUM YUM!!!

I replaced the sugar with unsweetened apple sauce, cut out the added water, and made my own oat flour instead of all purpose. This is the first recipe I have done this for and it for sure curbed my chocolate craving. It was very rich almost fudge like. I may of liked it better if I stuck with the original recipe but I'm trying to cut out added sugar where I can. I chopped up some strawberries to put on the top on a few of the pieces I had.

I didn't think these were very good.  I used Ghiradelli chocolate chips.  Very chocolatey, I missed the butter flavor, missing since there's only 2 the butter.  Not worth making.

I can finally stop looking for the perfect brownies recipe because this is it. So rich and dense and fudgy. Put together in less than 15 minutes. I love that the portion is small so that I don't have to feel so guilty about indulging

These do not taste like they are out of the box they taste so much better! I used a mix of milk bad semisweet chocolate chips it made it a tad sweeter and it was so good they were gone before I could get a second piece!

This is so delicious.  To the reviewers who think it is too sweet, use bittersweet chocolate instead of semi-sweet.  I think it cuts down the sweetness.  That's what I used and they were a hit!

I t was very good, had a perfect texture and is fast and efficient. The only thing that made me rank down one star was that it had to much chocolate, otherwise it was very good!

These brownies were delish! Everyone said they were the best brownies they ever had. I noticed that in other reviews, some people said that these brownies were bland, or was dry like chocolate cake. That would mean the cocoa they used was bland or that they overcooked them. If you use great quality cocoa and you don't cook it too long, these brownies taste insanely delicious!!! Try organic Cocao... makes them taste like chocolate truffles. We put them in cupcake tins and cooked for 20 mins, a little gummy the first day, but the next day after it was set, it was totally perfect!

Considering, I messed up this recipe, it was pretty good, I didn't have chocolate chips so I used raw coco powder instead... It's not very sweet with coco powder in it instead but I tried the batter... Fingers crossed that it'll be good, it's currently baking...

What can I say but "WOW!" There is definitely no reason to buy brownie mix when there is such an easy and delicious recipe for homemade brownies. I followed the directions exactly, although I had to use a 9" round cake pan because I couldn't find my 8x8 pan. No matter - the results were still perfect! Thank you, thank you for sharing this recipe. It is definitely in my top 10 favorite recipes from this site.

Excellent brownies! I needed to double the recipe and didn't have but 2 cups chocolate chips, so I added half a bar of Ghiaradelli bittersweet chocolate because I had it on hand. Baked in a 9x13 pan for 25 minutes - came out great! Delicious, too!

Had a huge craving for brownies and did not have cocoa powder on hand so I was looking for a recipe using melted chocolate (as I had multiple bags of chocolate chips).  Followed this recipe exactly but used 2 cups of melted chocolate chips (1 cup bitter sweet & 1 cup semi-sweet as I like dark chocolate).  Had to bake this for about 20 min. more than recipe stated., but it was simply not done (I kept checking..)  These brownies were definitely rich & chocolately..not cake like at all, but not fudgy either..not sure if the extra 1/2 cup of chocolate I added made it less dense than it should be.  I was looking for a dense, fudgy consistency and mine came out softer than I like my brownies to be.  All in all it totally satisfied my brownie fix.  I added 1 cup chopped walnuts to batter also.  I would try this again and use only 1 1/2 c. melted chocolate. Very easy recipe!! Thanks for sharing!

These are terrific brownies.  Made mine in non-stick mini muffin pans (one recipe filled 36 mini cups) and reduced baking time to 15-20 minutes.  Moist on the inside, perfectly crisp around the edges.  Definitely the best homemade brownie recipe I have tried.  It's a keeper.

I picked three different brownie recipes to make. Made this one first and won't even try the others. These brownies were perfect. Pulled out of the oven as soon as toothpick came out clean, about two minutes longer than stated. Added a couple handfuls of chopped toasted walnuts to the batter and they were absolutely delicious.Plus it is so easy.

My daughter picked this recipe to make for her brother's birthday ALL BY HERSELF (she's 11). It was easy and we had most of the ingredients. So I let her make them and only helped a little. They are super easy and they are homemade. No icky chemicals to ruin them. There was a lot of stirring involved and I needed to cook them the full 30 mins. But, other than them not really cutting well because they are cake-like, they turned out great! Very fudgy and you can press the crumbs together to make a whole other piece! We will definitely save this recipe and maybe play with it to come up with different flavor combos. Thank you for posting this. It was definitely what we were looking for.

This is one of my favorite brownie recipes so far. It was everything we love about a brownie, very easy to make and great chocolate flavoring. We had some pecans we were trying to use up as well as some butterscotch morsels we swirled on top. Had we added neither, this recipe would have received the exact same review.  We loved it!  We will make these again.

This was a respectable recipe.  I used Guittard chocolate chips and 1 cup of walnuts.  The texture was great; the actual flavor of the brownies was chocolate-y, but I have made many pans of brownies in my life, and I prefer the ones made with cocoa/oil, or unsweetened chocolate/butter.  Like another reviewer said, it could have been the lack of a stick of butter vs. 2 Tablespoons, I don't know.  But I like my recipe better for flavor.

This recipe was okay. For me, it came out cake like and was a tad too salty. I prefer fudgy brownies.

This recipe was easy to make but not my favorite. The flavors and texture are pretty pedestrian, but perfect for quick dessert for kids. The only problem I had was that the chocolate seized up on me when I added it to the hot butter. I had to dump the whole thing in the kitchen aid and beat to soften it. But once I did this, it was easy to spread in the pan and baked in exactly 25 minutes. I think upping the amount of butter would drastically improve the flavor and texture.

These are by far the best brownies I've every made.  It all comes together easily and very quickly.   A great recipe to have on hand when you are short on time and company is a commen.

I thought they were good, but I would like them to be a little less cakey and a little more gooey and chocolatey. We are a little spoiled because one of our local bakeries makes some crazy brownie concoctions and they are always insanely rich and fudgey, so we were kind of hoping for that. Maybe next time I would try the same recipe but add a cup of chocolate chips to the batter.

Excellent recipe!  Easy ingredients that everyone has in the house!  I made these during a blizzard and it was a big hit after shoveling for a couple of hours!  I only had one egg in the house and used 3 T of egg whites in the carton for the other egg and it still came out great!  Way better than boxed brownies!

Easy to make and very tasty. I used egg beaters and they worked very well. I also left some of the chocolate chips unmelted which tasted very good as well.

It was ruined by too much salt.  I used salted butter and that didn't help.  I would make this again, but using only 1/8 teaspoon of salt.  The texture and chocolate flavor of the brownies was good.

These were good. I've had box brownies more decadent than this. Maybe a different chocolate would make the difference. I used Toll House semi-sweet chocolate chips.

You can taste the difference now! If someone else makes brownies, I can tell if it's store bought,made with cocoa powder. I love these and they're fudgy!  I will note the type of flour matters,it can come out cake like not fudge. No complaints! Doubled the recipe for thicker but this is awesome. Tried it for the first time 3months ago. Been making them every week since! Yasssss

Pretty good flavor-wise, but very cakey. Not quite a brownie, this recipe is pretty light and fluffy rather than dense and chewy. I also agree it is too sweet, and I reduced the amount of sugar.

This recipe is a definite keeper!  They were delicious and moist. I think this may be my new go to brownie recipe. I wasn't sure of how they would turn out, especially without adding more cocoa, but I truly was amazed at just how yummy these were.

Just one word "Delicious". I was kinda confused while making it but when the brownies came out of the oven, they were just perfect. Soft, chewy, simply ravishing.
I'm gonna be the mom who makes the world's best brownies.Thanks for the recipe.

These were really good, but lacked the rich, dark chocolatey flavor of brownies that I grew up eating. I cut mine while still hot and it worked really well--the top didn't crack.

I used only 1 1/4 cup of sugar. Just because I ran out, and they still came out very well. They came out very thick, and after an overnight cooling in my refrigerator,  they probably shrunk about only half an inch. The taste reminded me of a brownie, but it also had a little taste of Hot Chocolate.  They are very easy to make, and really wouldn't take more than a hour. If you do plan to make several batches in different saucepans,  I recommend staggering the times that you make it, because it seems that during the warming of the butter combination,  it might burn.  I would still recommend this to any begging to moderate baker.

I just this minute tried this recipe. I was on the hunt for a decadent and easy brownie recipe and this met those criteria. I spiked the recipe with 2tbsps and 2tsps of Butterscotch Liqueur and I also used brown sugar instead of white. It's definitely a keeper. I will keep using this as a bad recipe for future brownie experiments.

Great, simple recipe. I made two batches- one as is and one with a cheesecake topping. Both came out delicious! I reduced the sugar to about 3/4 cup since the semi-sweet chocolate chips already has a sweetness to it and I didn't want mine to be overly sweet.  Definitely a keeper!

OMG, I love these! I did a 50/50 mix of brown/white sugar and left out the salt completely which wasn't at all noticeable.  I whisked the eggs into the chocolate quickly so as to not cook them which worked a treat.  I doubled the recipe and divided the batter between 2 silicone 7"x7" pans.  For the benefit of the UK a tablespoon of butter is 15g.  Rather than chocolate drops I just chopped up 400g of dark chocolate bars (Morrisons saver bars believe it or not - use 200g for the recipe of which I doubled).  I don't think these are going to last 24hrs given that my family keep going back to the kitchen and coming back looking guilty!

I made these while my sister and her friend were at the dog park, to surprise them, and the batter was so good, I was eating it... I ended up with not much batter left for the brownies themselves! In the end, these baked well in my pan and the girls adored them, but I had to limit myself to half a brownie after all that batter!

I cannot explain how delicious these brownies were. My older daughter is very very picky with brownies and I had made a different recipe from this site (it had frosting)but she did not like it a bit. These ones were a super hit! Excellent as is and the only change I did was did 3/4 cups milk chocolate chips and 3/4 cups semi sweet chocolate chips as we LOVE milk chocolate. It turned out just like we like it and LOVED it.
Did not last more than an evening...a must try

??????I had to give these more stars!! Six just did not seem enough!! Outstanding brownies!! I did use milk chocolate chips, only because it is personal preference. You will not be disappointed.

These brownies are really, really scrumptious! After 25 mins I thought they were not done, but I did not overvalue according to the recipe! They are so moist and delicious. Also, I stored them in the fridge for about two hours. My brother and I ate them again slightly cooled and they were even more delicious! Definitely a great brownie recipe!

This is superb!!! The best brownies I've ever made!!!I used this recipe with some adjustments. I used RitterSport 50% dark chocolate bar instead of choco cips. Unexpectedly I ran out of flour, so I used finely ground oats. I also took date-syrup to substitute a little part of sugar (I still use some sugar though). Lindt Double Milk in the middle is the other best part. Five star!!! :)

I modified this recipe and used cocoa powder instead of melting the chocolate chips. Tastes like a dry chocolate cake. Unimpressed.

Super easy, great quality! 100 times better than those boxed brownies. Kids love them and ppl ask me for the recipe all the time! Great plain, with chocolate chips added in, peanut butter, cream cheese, frosting on top, or just a dusting of powdered sugar. Thanks so much!

Words can't describe how delicious! I did however have to change the ingredients a teensy bit as for some reason I didn't have butter in stock... I used shortening in the same amount and added 1/2 tsp butter flavoring, still tasted awesome!!! I am crazy about these brownies!

This recipe is amazing, I'm making them again!!!! I made my first attempt last night, it was the richest brownie I ever had, my mother in law loved it too. Make sure to add a the 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and the teaspoon of flour, it makes a huge difference! I also added a touch of vanilla extract. I needed hubby to stir it, when you have to mix everything together it gets really thick and difficult.

It's funny when you have doubts about a recipe and when you actually make it and taste the end results...just wow! This IS the best brownie recipe ever. I did a mix with a chocolate chip cookie recipe on this site (which is my go to cookie recipe) with this brownie recipe (my new go to brownie recipe). I did like one reviewer stated and to wait until the chocolate cooled before adding the egg. This recipe taste way better than boxed brownies or even using cocoa powder. It is so easy to make too!

These brownies taste good, but they were quite dry and crumbly. I think it's the lack of butter that's the problem. Everything else was great, so perhaps next time I'll double the butter to 4 tbsp and see if that helps with the moistness of the brownies.

I really liked this recipe! I liked that the flavor stayed strong and rich. Sometimes I feel like you have a batter that tastes really good, and then the cooked product is really bland and gross. This one was so good, it was rich, and I loved the texture, it was chewy and soft, but not light and spongy. Loved it!

I have made this recipe multiple times and everyone has loved them. I use dark chocolate chips instead of the semi-sweet and depending on the occasion, I've added peanut butter, different types of chocolate chips into the batter, and a cheesecake topping. Every time these are a big hit. Going to be doing dark chocolate raspberry ones soon.

good recipe, though I prefer a cake-like texture with my brownies. I just had to add one more egg to the mixture and now it's perfect. a bit of a disappointment, though, that the mallows I added with the batter got melted but it gave the brownie a very chewy consistency, loved it!!

I made these last night, and my boyfriend (who doesn't even like chocolate!) couldn't get enough of these! It really tastes so much better than the boxed mixes! The only ingredient I had to buy were the chocolate chips since I had everything else, and the recipe was so incredibly easy. The only thing I might do different next time is to whisk the eggs before adding to the pot and maybe add in some chopped walnuts. Thanks for my new go-to brownie recipe!

Wow.  I wasn't expecting too much, as every recipe I have made was a disappointment in cake-like brownies.  I used Einkorn flour, and added cacao nibs to the batter.  These are absolutely delicious!!

I have made these Brownies for years. They are always a request when we have family gatherings. 
I actually use Nestle Toll House Milk Chocolate chips, it makes a big difference in taste. 
I have tried with different brands, everytime  I am asked what did you do to them, they are not the same. Lesson learned... Nestlé Toll House Milk Chocolate chips is the only way to go.

I followed this recipe to the letter. These were very very bland in my opinion and way too cakey. Should have left out one of the eggs and it needed more chocolate flavor. Still on the hunt for a great fudgey, chewy brownie recipe. I don't know how everyone likes these.

So good! Best brownies, and so easy! The only change I made was adding an extra egg, my husband prefers cakelike brownies. They were perfect! This recipe is a keeper.

Recipie was simple and easy to make. I "altered" by putting resse's in my pan. The brownies them selves had an ok taste which would have been fine but they were really dry. So dry infact i had to chug milk after each bite just to swallow them.

It's Valentine's Day and I decided to whip up a tasty dessert for the dinner I'm fixing for my hubby of 27 years.  We've been snowed in for a week, so I don't have much in the pantry in the way of baking products.  The one thing I did have was chocolate chips: semi-sweet, dark chocolate, milk chocolate.  I started searching for a brownie recipe I could make using chocolate chips (I've always used bakers chocolate). I found this recipe. I followed the recipe, but did use 1 cup semi-sweet and 1/2 cup special dark chocolate chips instead of all semi-sweet. It was quick to fix, tasty, and the perfect ending to my Valentine's dinner.  This one will go in my recipe box.

This recipe is great- I originally found it a little too sweet so I added about 1/2 cup of flour and I found it less sweet and more the texture was more like a cake-brownie. I also topped it with walnuts. I had resist eating more than!!!

I made this recipe exactly like it says. It was very quick and easy. Wow and they came out amazing! I use Ghirardelli chocolate chips and I baked the brownies for about 28 minutes. The only difficulty I had was after I melted the chocolate chips. I was worried the eggs would cook if I put them in right away, so I let the chocolate mixture cool just a bit. It made it more difficult to mix in the eggs and vanilla after the chocolate had cooled and clumped, but after mixing for a few minutes it combined nicely. Overall, these brownies are amazing and very chocolatey! I will be making them again!

brownies turned out to be just about average but extremely salty.. did not understand the reason though. When i read others' reviews saying that it was too salty, i thought what rubbish, how can 1/2 tsp make it extra salty but TRUST ME, IT IS TOO SALTY..

So wonderful! Way better than the box. We laid big chunks of walnuts on top of brownie batter before putting in oven, it looked beautiful...Instead of baking 20 minutes, we left it in oven for 35 minutes for a crispier edges and top yet still soft or fudgier in the middle. Skipping "ono"...

These had great flavor and looked perfect, but I got complaints that they were a bit too dense and not moist enough.  I think because the flavor's so good it's worth another try with less egg, since someone else said that helped.

I thought I had the best brownie recipe anywhere but I came across this and decided to give it a try.
Because we love brownies I doubled the batch and am glad I did. I didn't change anything. We couldn't stop eating these. They are beyond the best!!!

Made exactly as written. Definitely the best brownies ever. I did try to bake them in mini muffin tins as one reviewer suggested. Had to bake 13 - 15 minutes and then no matter what we tried, had a difficult time removed them from pan (pan had been greased).  My suggestion is to use the mini muffin paper liners.

Followed this receipt to the exact measurements and instructions and was SO disappointed! The consistency did not hold up well and it was insanely sweet! I'm so confused why it rated so well...even made the recipe twice just to make sure!

These were a hit--very fudgy and chocolatey! I omitted the sugar (the chocolate chips are sweet enough) and I used 1/4 tsp of salt.

Delish!  So quick and easy - I will never use a boxed brownie mix again!  I made mine in one of those brownie pans that has 12 separate squares for individual sized brownies (no cutting necessary)!  I just made sure I checked them at 20 minutes - and they were done perfectly!  Cool completely to allow for easy removal.  Will make these again for sure!

I've never made brownies from scratch before but these are fantastic. The smell of them fresh out of the oven is heavenly. I don't know how I'm going to save any for later! Must exhibit self-control!! I'll definitely be adding these to my recipe box and making them again. 

They're more chocolatey than store brought brownies and richer in flavor. The texture is smooth and rich. 

The perfect brownie!

This recipe was sooooo easy and fast! My husband couldn't believe how quickly I was in and out of the kitchen. These were I would say as easy as a box brownie but I am happy to know what ingredients are in them! My mother-in-law asked me if I had used a box mix, but I only take that as a compliment. :)

Delicious brownie recipe. Very easy to make, only dirties up one pan to mix all the ingredients! I used the Splenda baking blend instead of regular sugar and they still turned out wonderful. I might try to use whole wheat or white whole wheat flour next time for a healthier alternative and see how they turn out.

These brownies are so amazingly easy to make and the taste is incredible. My husband can't get enough. This recipe will be my only brownie recipe from now on. I used a quarter of a cup of white sugar and a quarter cup brown sugar and sprinkled the remaining chips on top. I also didn't use as much salt because the first time I made them I could taste the salt a bit too strongly.

I used splenda instead of sugar because I ran out. And instead of chocolate chips I used 8 squares of semi-sweet bakers chocolate. I had baked a lot this week, I had run out of almost everything. These were so good, I used up the last of the vanilla ice cream to have with them. The name says it all MMMMMMM brownies!

Best brownies ever.  So fudgy, so soft and chewy, but such great crisp edges.  I doubled the recipe and cooked in a 9 x 13 pan.  They were perfectly done in 25 mins.  I subbed in dark chocolate chips and will do it that way every time.

It's more like a cake. It's very dry and way too salty! Not browny like at all. The big amount of bakingsoda wasn't helping the taste either..it added to the salty experience

SUPER RICH AND DELICIOUS... 1st time making brownies from scratch, and I'll never go  back to box mixes again.  These brownies are delicious and super easy and fast to make.  I added nuts and chocolate chips to the cooled mix before baking and they turned out beautifully.

I usually make brownies with cocoa powder but decided to try this recipe as I had a bunch of chocolate chips on hand. Wow these are amazing brownies, I can't stop eating them! I followed recipe exactly and baked in a glass pan for 25 minutes, they turned out crunchy on top and inside was chocolate fudgey goodness! They really don't need frosting either, in fact I'd say they are better without. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Recipe makes fudgy brownies. I didn't have chocolate chips, but 1/2-2/3 cup of melted Hershey's Kisses (dark chocolate) makes theses SOOO tempting! Also, make in cupcake pan--easier to serve and cooks faster without burning, so you can have that slightly gooey-but still cakey best of both worlds!

The first time I made these, I had to substitute peanut butter chips because I didn't think to check for all ingredients BEFORE starting! :)) In spite of that, these turned out amazing. Everyone in my husband's office devoured them and requested more. I made them as written, with ALL ingredients, a few more times to rave reviews. At Christmas, all of these disappeared before I even took them out of the pan (literally - my husband and another swiped them and ran away, haha). :)

These brownies were DELICIOUS!!! Super fudgy. We arent really fans of brownies that are made with cocoa powder, so I was happy to find a different recipe! Yummy, and very easy!

I don't know what I did wrong. I used good quality chocolate chips and followed this recipe exactly. Mine were cakey and barely tasted like anything!!! They rose up very well and then sunk.  Very disappointing. :(

Great recipe!  Easy and took very little time to prepare.  I was happy I had the ingredients and was surprised it was all completed in one pot.  I used a double boiler.  I highly recommend if you really want a dessert and want to make something fast.

I loved the recipe! I followed the advice and used my stand mixer after mixing chocolate chips with the butter mixture. It wasn't as sweet as some people said, in fact next time I'll use half the salt because they tasted a little salty to me eventhough I also added 1 cup of white chocolate chips. I'll make them again, I liked the consistency and flavor. Thanks for sharing!

I made this at a friends house using stuff from her pantry. I only turned up half a cup of chocolate chips so I used cocoa mix instead. Still turned out pretty good from scratch.

These brownies were pretty great! I had a taste for brownies but not many ingredients on hand, so I chose this recipe.  I decided to make one and a half times this recipe (I would have doubled it but didn't have enough sugar) before realizing I needed to make other modifications. I didn't have chocolate chips on hand, but I had: 4 oz. unsweetened chocolate squares & 4 tbsps brown sugar (ran out of white), & a combo of 9 tbsps cocoa, 7 tbsps brown sugar (still out of white), 3 tbsps shortening.  This was the equivalent of 10 oz. of chocolate chips, instead of the 9 oz. called for, but I love chocolate, so it worked for me.  

Even with the modifications, the brownies turned out really well, with 1 exception.  They were salty.  Because I made 1.5 times the recipe, I added 1.5 tsp of salt.  Perhaps I shouldn't have added that much, but next time, I won't add any at all.  I ended up making the brownie frosting from the "Best Brownies" recipe on this site to cut the salty taste, which helped.  Without the salt factor, I would've given 5 stars!!

This is my easy, go-to recipe when we want something sweet to eat. I have mixed in nuts, peanut butter chips and Heath bits. All good. Family loves it. Church folk love it. Friends love it.

Fantastic recipe.  Will never buy boxed brownie mix again!  I melted a half-cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and mixed it into the batter the second time around, which made them more dense and verrrry chocolatey!

We loved these brownies.  I doubled it and cooked it in a 13x9 pan since I was taking it to a group gathering.  I came home with an empty pan. They are very sweet and fudgy.  I don't like semisweet chocolate chips so I used the milk chocolate chips.

I'm so grateful for this recipe. I try to avoid processed foods & refined sugar, but for those occasions when a brownie is required you'll find this truly simple recipe a godsend. The brownies are light & fluffy yet dense enough. I use a whole package of Chipits (sometimes even butterscotch), add roasted pecans, etc. I also sub the white sugar for 1/4 C of brown. But I could even do without the sugar. Thank you!

I love these brownies!!  I've been on a "quest" to find the perfect brownie recipe, and these are the the ones I have been looking for.  I did, however reduce the amount of salt, for the first batch I baked of these were on the salty side.  Although the salt wasn't too noticeable, I could taste it in the brownies a bit.

This is the best brownie recipe I have found. They aren't cake brownies, which most other recipes are. They have a strong chocolate taste, which most don't. What I love the most about them is that they can be prepared in the time that it takes to preheat the oven, so I can whip them up anytime.

Best brownies ever! I doubled the batch, heated sugar, butter and water in microwave for 2 minutes, stirred in the chips, microwaved again for 2 minutes, stirring after 1 minute, then followed the rest of the directions and baked for 30 minutes. will never buy boxed brownie mix again!

I don't know what to say. To start a 1/4 cup more sugar is needed if u have bitter choco chips like me. Second it was very moist but not fudgy. Third it did not cut well! It just cracked on the top. Yummy with a few flaws.

I tried this recipe because I was low on butter, but high on chocolate craving! I used half white & half semi-sweet chips, but will try again with all semi-sweet because they ended up not being quite chocolate-y enough for me. I would also skip the salt if you have salted butter, I actually could taste the salt which was a little odd, but not unpleasant.
 My husband loved them, thanks for the sharing this one!

I just made these, and they are great! I followed the recipe exactly, and I think there's just one thing that I would change in the future. For me, the 100% semi-sweet chocolate flavor was a bit overwhelming and extremely rich. Next time I plan to try half semi-sweet and half milk chocolate. Still an excellent brownie!

Yummy, light and tasty.  I did change it a little since we love dark chocolate - 2 sq (2 oz) baker's chocolate and 1 c semi sweet.  So good and so easy!

This recipe was very easy and I was quite surprised by how great the brownies came out! My hubby loved it and will make it again for sure! I added in some chopped walnuts.

This recipe is fabulous!  Very easy to make and delicious! I took the advice of some of the other suggestions I read and did not add any salt. I am going to try putting crushed After Eight chocolate peppermint sticks on the next batch when they come out of the oven.

I loved these brownies!  I made them gluten free by subbing almond flour for the wheat flour and they turned out perfect!  Mine turned out fudgy and moist, just the way I like them.  I would say that I think that there is too much salt in the recipe so I will cut down on that next time I make them.

I thought these were pretty good, but I think I like the box better for taste reasons, although I much prefer the from scratch method because I know exactly what's in it.

I used both milk chocolate chips and bittersweet Bakers chocolate squares - wasn't chocolaty enough. But in the end, it was perfect with a thick and rich chocolate frosting on top

Loved these! Was having a serious craving and had no box mix in the house. Googled chocolate chip brownie recipes (because I had chips in the pantry!) and was able to whip these up in 5 minutes. I used the microwave to melt chips butter and water together. Took about a minute. Don't completely melt the chips. They will continue to melt after taking them out of
F the micro as you stir in sugar and vanilla. The whole recipe can be made in one bowl!

I am making them again today but will try to boost the chocolate factor by adding some cocoa powder. Loved these & won't go back to the box mixes!!!!

Best brownies I've ever made, and I'm always trying new recipes for them.  I have always preferred store-bought mixes for brownies specifically because the brownies get that "shiny film" layer on top with mix-based recipes that I'd never achieved with a from-scratch recipe, but this one makes the "film."  It's the best.  'Had a craving for brownies last night and only had one egg on-hand and this recipe still turned out perfectly.  This is the only recipe I'll ever use for brownies now.  Thank you, cicada77.  :)

I made these yesterday, and they are gorgeous. Very easy to make too. My husband and son loved them, and my husband doesn't have a sweet tooth.
I only had just over 1 cup of chocolate chunks in the larder, but it still worked out very well.

FYI use 2c of chips-melt 1c as written, then after everything is combined stir in other cup.
Also-try using dark choc/mint chips they will taste like Andes candies!
I have also used the mini Reeses as the 1 c to stir in-amazing...I have been using this recipe for years!

Add the remaining chips (most bags come with .5 cups more than the recipe calls for) to the brownies, and this already fantastic recipe becomes the BEST!

I came across this recipe in yesterday's reviews and it caught my attention. At 10 pm! How could I resist and why should I? They turned out wonderful and I used dark choco chips. I think there's a third of a pan left. I should be able to plow through that before midnight. Thanks for sharing! :o)

Simply the best brownies I've ever made.  I bake for 300 kids at a summer camp and they absolutely loved this recipe.  A touch of white chocolate on top and it pulls the whole thing together.

This is IT! 
I recently made my favorite Ghiradelli mix and it had NO chocolate taste, it was terrible. I have been trying different recipes, looking for the best, chocolatiest brownie recipe, and this is it! A bit more work than a mix, but not much, and so incredibly good!
   Thank you, Cicada!!

I followed this recipe exactly, and the brownies came out fantastic! They were rich, moist, and delicious. I was worried that the brownies would be too small but they rose in the oven to a perfect size. You have to be careful not to overcook them by checking often with a toothpick, at the end mine didn't come out perfectly clean but with only a few spots. I would warn that the recipe really only yields 9 servings, unless you cut the brownies extremely small. My only complaint is that there isn't enough of them! These were a big hit, and I will be making these again. Don't change a single thing!

Excellent recipe. The first time I made it, I ran out of semi-sweet and had to add 1/2 cu milk chocolate in order to reach the full 1 1/2 cups of chips. This ended up changing the consistency of it to more of a cake than a brownie, interestingly.  The second time I did it the correct way (with all semi-sweet chips) and it was perfect.

Super simple and really, really good. The only change I made was to add a very small amount of corn syrup to keep the sugar from getting grainy (just a fail-safe I normally do), and I mixed in a few walnuts. If you prefer a gooey (as opposed to cakey) brownie, this is a no-fail recipe. (Stirring and butter amount can be a huge factor with cocoa powder recipes)

My husband and my son were VERY please.

Best brownie recipe ever - and easy too! Addictive. Some reviewers I noticed complained about the salt. I don't like a lot of salt on anything but I disagree with that - the salt really works here and brings out the chocolate flavor more. I wouldn't change a thing.

I have a very similar recipe [same ingredients but measurements are slightly different] and I adore making these brownies. It is so easy that I never use brownie mixes in a box.  I like to add half the bag of chocolate chips and stir them until melted and then add the remaining half of the chocolate chips before pouring the batter into the 8 x 8 pan. The chocolate chips stay whole and are yummy when you bite into the brownie!

These brownies are FABULOUS!  If you like nice thick, rich brownies, these are for you.  I added the rest of the bag of chips, but otherwise followed the recipe, and I have to say I have never had a better brownie.  Thank you SO much for this recipe!

THESE BROWNIES ARE DELICIOUS! I'm never buying a mix again. The brownies came out soft and tasty. I made them with my 9 year old nephew and the recipe is so easy to follow we whipped them up in no time. Needless to say, we gobbled them up pretty quickly. I'll be sure to have ice cream on hand next time I make these.... YUM!

These brownies turned out okay... but they're very cake like and I followed the recipe to a T.  A lot of these comments say they're fudgey but mine definitely weren't.  =(

these are so good! just like boxed mixes.. but recently i threw in half a pack of cream cheese and thought it was pretty good as well... i just threw in the 4 oz of cream cheese at the same time as the chocolate chips, kept it on the warm burner, mine is electric, so it would melt.. and poured the batter into my mini muffin tin... filled it up to the top so every piece got a little crisped up on top and had that nice chewily hardened bottom... the brownie itself has a heftier rise with the cream cheese and makes it more cakelike, but the texture is really very fudgy... i highly recommend this recipe!

This recipe didn't work for me for some reason.  The taste was great but they rose around the edges and the center sank when they came out of the oven.  Does anyone know what would cause this...bad ingredients? Oven temperature?  I'd love to know what caused it because the other reviews all were very positive so I'm sure it was my fault somehow.

Yummy and Easy!  Need I say more?  I tried these brownies when I ran out of brownie mix and my daughter was having a sleep over.  I happened to have all of the ingredients on hand, so I figured I'd give them a try.  They were a hit!  Not only are they fudgy, they are light and airy!  I had to leave them in for about 27 minutes, at 25, they still weren't done enough.  Delicious!

Good. Next time i will use milk chocalate chips. If your'e not a dark chocolate lover do the same. Mine were a litle dry but it was my fault. I overcooked them. Nice texture overall. Very easy to prepare.

Love it, but I modified the methode by first whisk the eggs and the sugar just until sugar dissolved, melt the chocolate and butter together over bain marie, add them to the egg mixture along with water and vanilla and salt. whisk the flour and baking soda together, than add to the egg chocolate mixture, and bake. they turned out less dense and I love it!

I would give this 5 stars but it ended up too salty. Way too salty. But I'm giving it a 4 because I ate it anyway despite the saltiness and it really is delicious. I'm making them again today, but I am going to cut the salt in half, so hopefully it helps.   The brownies looked like they were made in a bakery, better than a box. I will never buy boxed brownies again.

This is a great chocolate experience!  Very easy and not overly sweet.  I accidentally doubled the amount of baking soda and it still turned out great, more of a cake brownie than fudge brownie (which is how I will do it from now on when I'm in the mood for cake!)  This recipe could easily be doctored up with nuts or be frosted.  Like others, my box mix brownie days are behind me!

Didn't have time to go to the store for a box of brownie mix so i turned to my favorite place, allrecipes.com for help.  I have never made brownies from scratch before but needed to today.  Found this one and was stoked that i had all the ingredients, since i was out of cocoa.   Easy, fast, and fun!  THANK YOU for this recipe!  It will be getting shared with everyone!  I was doubling the recipe but I actually only had about 2C semi-sweet chocolate chips so i added 1C of mint chips to substitute.  So yummy and turned out great!!  Thanks again!

I am really fussy about my brownie recipe and I can honestly say that these brownies are the only brownies I will ever make again. They are fabulous as written, but adding nuts, cream cheese swirl or even frosting would also be awesome!

This was good, I subbed dark chocolate chips (ghirardelli=splurge) for the health benefits and deeper taste. Nice little crust on top.

Good flavor.  I did double the recipe and I substituted baking squares for the chips.  If you like a cake-like brownie, then this is a good recipe.  Very easy to make.

4 stars for flavor.  I could not scrape all of it out of the sauce pan for some reason.  Did not set real well but it is incredibly easy and quick to make.   Worth a try.

Amazing! People who tried this told me it was the best brownie they ever had. Follow the receipe, the only change that i made was 1/4 tsp of salt instead of 1/2 tsp. I read some reviews that said it was too salty so i lowered the salt amount and loved it like that. The chocolate chip really makes the diffrence. It will be a keeper for my dinners party. Impressive and sooo easy!

Was out of Brownie and came across this quick and easy recipe.  Great basic recipe, but I am wondering why there is salt in it.  It just made the brownies taste kind of salty. Will definitely make again, but will omit the salt - or just use a pinch.

Perfect!  For a healthy version, I used whole wheat flour and stevia.  It only needed to bake for 20 min. in my oven.  The perfect brownie! :)

Really enjoyed making this recipe with my daughter. The taste is wonderful...very chocolately as a result of the chocolate chips. The texture is more cake-like and not as dense and moist as I would expect from a brownie hence the 4 stars. We will definitely make this one again!

I should not make these brownies because I can't leave them alone! This is such a better recipe than my regular one that calls for 2 cups sugar, 1 cup butter and 4 eggs for the same size pan! Thanks for the post!

My daughter and I made these a few days ago.. they are good but we prefer the box mix. They taste exactly like the toll house semisweet choc chips we used and nothing else. Maybe we'll try again with milk choc chips instead. Def more fun to make than box mix!

Definitely NOT what I thought it would be from all the positive comments.  The brownie is very pretty and thick, but VERY bitter tasting! (I used the semi-sweet chips that the recipe calls for).  I had to make some chocolate frosting so the brownies were edible.  I thought the brownies had a good consistency, but if I ever make them again, I'd use milk chocolate chips!

Followed a reviewer's suggestion for doing butter, sugar, water mixture in microwave. Much easier. Added more chocolate chips when placing batter in the pan. Baked twenty five minutes, a little underdone in middle (tooothpick test) but did not want edges to crisp anymore. Pretty brownie but texture seems a little gummy and would like a richer flavor. Will tweak and try again. Used Nestle semi-sweet chips.

Chocolatey and tender.  Delicious and simple.  What a great recipe!  They baked up higher than I thought they would.  Had a bit less chips so added some cocoa and 2 TBS. more sugar.  Baked for 25 minutes.  A great recipe!

I was desperate for a recipe one fine day once I realized I had run out of Ghiradelli brownie mix. This did not disappoint - equally as good if not for the several steps involved. Family was impressed that they were made from scratch! THANKS!!!

I made these brownies as written but since I really like my desserts super sweet I added chocolate ganache on top. This really made this brownie recipe even better, I think. Also, I used half semisweet and milk chocolate to make it even richer. So to those of you who like your desserts really sweet, give the ganache a try. Thanks for posting this recipe.

I didn't have chocolate chips so used 1/4 cup cocoa  and increased sugar to 2/3 cup brown sugar. If you like em more fudgey could try 1/3 or even 1/2 cup cocoa with increased sugar, but i like my version because i don't like too sweet, too dark brownies. Was amazed they came out so moist with only 2 T. butter!

Very easy prep - like others, my chocolate almost began to seize, but was able to beat it out.  Flaky top, but again (like others) too gooey in center.  We scooped it out and served with ice cream which the kids loved.

Did NOT turn out like the picture. The crust, I must say is beautiful, and is also one of the only reason why I'm giving this an okay rating. Doesn't cook at the same amount of time given, yes I have an 8x8 square pan. The taste, alright. Everything is just gooey inside, and it's hard to eat.. The picture looks very cake-like and a little gooey, mine is just PLAIN gooey. I hope I didn't do something wrong though. Willing to try it once more.

The brownies turned out just the way l like them. They have even texture, not caky and not too moist in the middle. I used ~4 tsp. of butter and I had to use Baker's chocolate blocks. In the past I tried a few recipes and I thought I would never be able to achieve such a texture.

Awesome!  So easy & quick.  They are 'satiny' like box brownies.  I didn't bother combining the flour, baking soda, and salt first - just dumped it in - turned out fine!  Before baking, I sprinkled them with chocolate jimmies - cute!  Mine ended up needing only 20 minutes to bake.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent! I actually liked them even better the day after. :) (side note: I substituted rapidura for the sugar, cause even though it's still a kind of sugar it's a little less processed...And I put in a whole tsp of vanilla because I like vanilla :))

These brownies are awesome and really easy to make.  Instead of the 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips it says to use, I did 1 cup milk chocolate and 1 cup white chocolate. I put half a cup of the white chocolate aside and mixed them into the batter before cooking them and it worked beautifully.  I did have to increase cooking time to 25 minutes and they did turn out very thin but the taste was amazing.

Oh my goodness are these ever good.  Instead of pan, I used cupcake pan with paper liners.  I added chopped pecans to half of the batter, otherwise I followed it as written.  I started baking my brownies in cupcake pan as I always like the outside edge pieces so now they are all outside edge pieces.  I like the idea of less sugar, eggs, and flour.  Makes me think I am getting less calories.  ;-)  Shhhhhh do not remind me of the chocolate chips.

I followed the recipe as written, I'm not sure what went wrong. Like a lot of other reviews, my brownies caved in the middle, The edges were so hard we can't cut them and the middle is gooey and flat. They tasted more like melted semi-sweet chocolate than they did like brownies. Bummed! Made a box of brownies...the crowd went wild.

These are very good brownies.  They have a nice texture with the typical flakey brownie top.  They are delicious but personally I think it's hard to beat Brooke's Best Bombshell Brownies.

The texture of these brownies was fine, although I had to bake them about 12 minutes longer than stated.  However, the taste wasn't quite there.  I used Ghiradelli semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the standard Nestles.  Could that have made a difference?  It was very chocolaty but did not have that wonderful chocolate taste--almost chalky, in fact.  Sadly, I am going to stick to box brownies until I find that perfect brownie recipe.

Not sure exactly what happened but the brownies fell in the centre and I was left with them still being too soft in the middle but done all around! It looked like a mess but I must say, still tasted yummy!  I will try again, hopefully with more success.

These brownies came out moist and delicious!  I used whole what flour and half the sugar, so they weren't too sweet.  I also put an icing on top made from butter, milk, confectioners sugar, vanilla, and cocoa.

Delicious! You could do amazing things with this recipe. I think next time I make this recipe I will add nuts or peanut butter. The only thing I did different was add less salt. Never again will I use another recipe!

These brownies are absolutely wonderful. They don't make too much of a mess, just one pot (and a bowl for the flour mixture which I might forgo next time). An 8x8 result is exactly the right portion. 25 minutes in the oven and they're done.  This is the first time I've tried a brand new recipe and not thought once that I was doing it completely wrong; it's just wonderfully simple. Oh, and I love that I already have chips in the house, so I can make these whenever,  and no need to keep something else in stock.

Part II: 
This time, after a few days the brownies turned dry and cakey. -1 STAR

Seriously the best brownies I've ever made! I decided to bake them for the Superbowl but I may need to double the recipe since my boyfriend and I ate about half of them already! I'm sure they'll be a huge hit! I adjusted them for High Altitude by adding an extra 2 Tbsp flour to the recipe. They came out moist and delicious!

Awesome brownies! Followed the recipe, and they turned out perfect. I baked them for 25 minutes and they were finished, but a little too moist, so I turned off the oven and let them sit inside for 5 minutes or so, and they were perfect.

Really simple easy recipe, made them for my brother's birthday. Were gone in an instance! I'm also fourteen so it goes to show how easy they are to make. Used a tip from a review to bake them for 25 mins and doubled the recipe for a 13x9 pan, added 1/2 a cup more sugar and no nuts (allergies). Overall great recipe will make again.

I'm giving this recipe 3 stars since there is only 2tbsp butter and they taste okay, but I will not be making them again. The crust was good straight out of the oven, but the next day it was soggy - along with the rather tasteless brownies.  Next time I want a brownie, I'll just surrender and use a different recipe that calls for a whole stick of butter.

****UPDATE!! I now use the "best brownies" recipe from this site instead of this one. After making this many times I realized this produces brownies that are dry and cakey instead of fudgey and gooey!*******After trying MANY brownie recipes, my search is finally over. I followed the directions exactly and they turned out excellent. I melted the entire 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips into the batter, then after mixing with the dry ingredients I added an extra 1/2 cup of chocolate chips to give the brownies extra little surprises of chocolate in each bite. I frosted them with "Rich Chocolate Frosting" from this site and they were so good! ***UPDATE*** I am still making these brownies! I just made them for fathers day and used "Brownie Frosting" and they were decadent and delicious!

Really easy and delicious!  I would definitely make these over box brownies in the future.  My husband would have liked them a little chewier, but I think I could achieve that with a little longer baking time.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These brownies were okay.  I followed the recipe to a T, and the texture was great (it had that wonderful, flakey crust) but they still weren't as chocolate-y as the ones from the box.  I'll continue my search for "as good or better than the box" brownies.

great recipe but it's not chewy enough for my taste - I like really chewy brownies. I doubled the recipe but put only 2 eggs (I think 3 would be fine too) and put less flour and added walnuts and cocoa powder. Turned out great, very rich and chocolaty. I think it's the best brownies from scratch recipe I've tried so far.

This was my first time making brownies from scratch and I absolutely loved them. I ran out of the box brownies and set out on the web looking for a replacement. This is now my replacement for the box mix brownies. My family couldn't agree more. I used  1 1/2 cups of milk chocolate chips and added another 7 min. to the original time and they turned out perfect. I might just be making brownies at least once a week for the fam.

I loved this recipe. While I don't generally like packaged mixes, Brownies were the one thing I liked better from a box. Not anymore. It has a slight "saltiness" to it that I like, but if you're not big on that, just reduce the amt. of salt. I might have over salted too, because I don't always measure for small amounts.

I've made these twice now and made them with the proportions being the same as the given recipe but used sucanat instead of white sugar and 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour and 1/2 white flour instead of all white flour.  These are just AMAZING.  I really cannot get over the moist quality and the deep richness achieved in this recipe.  Quite delicious.  I'll be making these for our occasional dessert times.  OH, and SO EASY!  Turns out brownies very quickly and without much cooking effort.

A nice basic brownie recipe.  I prefer mine a bit more jazzed up.  Better then boxed, but, not as good as some others I've had.  What is nice about this recipe, is that I probably will always have the ingred. on hand.

i would say, that these are more like fudge than brownies, but i definately feeel like they're are delicious, and definately worth the making.  try it. because they're super yummy also, try using a higher quality chocolate chip, because it definately makes a difference.

By far the best brownie recipe I have ever found, and I've tried ever so many.  It is important to sprinkle some chocolate chips on top before baking: it makes them look superb and give you something to sink your teeth into when you're eating them.  It also very important to eat these cold: the melted chocolate sort of hardens and the texture is perfect.  They have that nice chewy/crispy top, with the perfect amount of chewy gooeyness.  I always only cook them for about 20 minutes.

These were quite good. Very fudgy and rich, great with ice cream. Not my favorite brownie as I like mine a little more cake-like, but very quick to put together and definitely satifies a chocolate craving.

Very good brownies!! They were very easy to make and turned out better than i expected since they were so easy. I only had 1/2 cup choc. chips on hand, so i chopped up 3 sqaures of bitter sweet chocolate and they worked just fine. And yes! temper the eggs!!! I'm not big into brownies, but have since eaten 3! When i asked my husband if they were good, he said MMMMmm Hmmmm!

These brownies were delicious and very easy to make! They were both fudgy and cakey- a great texture! I'll definitely be making them again. The only change I made was that I used 9 oz dark chocolate bar (chopped into small pieces before melting) instead of chocolate chips. I baked in a 6 1/2 x 8 1/2 glass pyrex for exactly 25 minutes. This worked really well. One note is that I think the portion estimate is a bit off. The brownies were fairly thick, but the yield was only 8 normal-sized brownies, not 16.

The key is baking at 325. Sometimes I forget and set the oven to 350 and they're more cakey. Done right these brownies are fudgy and dense. I have been making brownies for a long time and this is the first recipe that is worthy of being my favorite.

I made a double batch of these one night and between my boyfriend, his brother, and I, in was all gone within hours! A dollop of vanilla ice cream over warm fresh-out-of-the-oven brownies.. it doesn't get any better.

This is such a wonderful recipe.  Years ago I was given the most delicious brownie recipe that a local pastry chef used in his bakery.  Unfortunately after 3 moves the recipe was lost, and I thought I would never find another brownie recipe that would compare to it...until I found this one.  This one tastes almost exactly the same, it's so easy to make, and the texture is perfect.  Thank you so much for sharing this one, I'm back in brownie heaven.

Incredible brownies, like the box-type quick brownies, just like people said.  Chocolatey, slightly chewy and best warm. I took another cook's advice and swirled a little peanut butter into the top, and stuck to the 25 minutes, and these were incredible (topped with dark-chocolate MMs and riece's pieces).  I'm going to work on the recipe to add more coacoa, less sugar, and whole wheat flour.

Really good  To make these brownies a little healthier I made them with splenda and served warm with sugar-free lofat vanilla ice cream.  Absolutely delicious and I didn't feel so guilty.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I normally don't write recipe reviews, but I absolutely had to say something about these brownies.  They were perfect!  I am a much better cook than a baker and these brownies made me look like a rockstar to my family.  My seven year old said they were the best brownies ever.

Tasted GREAT! I needed 1.5x the recipe but only had 1 cup of choco chips, so I used a whole 8oz box of Baker's semi-sweet chocolate squares that I had on hand and broke it into chunks for easier melting (and it made about 1.25 cups of chunked chocolate).  I put it in a 11x7 casserole dish and the brownies came out too thick...next time I'll use 9x13 when I 1.5x the recipe.

These are absolutely amazing. Perfect texture and amount of chocolate, I don't suggest you change a thing. Take care to use good quality chocolate though, as it really makes a difference.

these were GREAT! no one mentioned this, but i had to add a few more tablespoons of water to thin it out bit so that i could mix in the eggs. i definitely would wait a good 5 minutes before adding in the eggs. but otherwise, these taste AMAZING. and adding 1/2 cup of chocolate chips, will take it to that next level!

I'm not a huge brownie fan in general, but I was craving chocolate and these did the trick.  Top was flaky and the inside was moist and gooey.  Yum!

Today is the second time to bake these and believe me it will not be my last. I was always told how "hard" brownies from scratch were to make and any time I used the box (yuk) they were flat tiny useless things. But not anymore, these are not to sweet, and the chocolate flavor is a big bang to the taste buds. Only thing I found that I have to do is double the recipe because one pan is not enough.

I've only made brownies from scratch one other time and those couldn't even compare to these babies. These are delicious and received rave reviews from the guests who ate them. I had to cook them for about 5 minutes longer than the recipe calls for to get them to be fudgy but not undercooked. That may just be my oven though.

i only baked these for twenty minutes because i like a very fudgy brownie, and they were perfectly done. i followed the recipe exactly and they were very good, but tasted, according to my sister, more like melted chocolate chips than brownies. next time i might try milk chocolate chips or another extract for a different flavor. i also think these would be a very good candidate for a stir-in such as nuts or peanut butter chips (once the batter cools a bit!).

Fudgey and chewey.  I added anything to the top to make them over the top.  I sprinkled crushed pecans, white chocolate chips, semi sweet chocolate chips, chopped heath bars and drizzled carmel.

These were pretty good and easy to make. The only thing I added was chopped walnuts. Next time, right before baking, I am going to try adding some white chocolate chips or maybe some peanut butter chips for a different flavor.

These brownies are great!  I made the recipe even easier and microwaved the wet ingredients in a microwave-safe bowl in 15-second increments until the chocolate was melted and creamy; then I just mixed the dry ingredients in with the wet.  It worked great and I only had to dirty one bowl!  After mixing it all together, I added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips to the batter for extra fudginess.  The brownies are soft, but not cakelike, which is what I prefer.  Yum!  I'll definitely make this again.

These brownies are simply delicious.  I have made them four times and received rave reviews each time.  Each time I doubled the recipe and baked them in a 13x9 pan.  They come out thick and delicious.  I bake them for about 45-50 mins.  The only thing I added to the recipe was walnuts.  I dusted chopped walnuts with flour to keep them from settling in the bottom of pan, then I added them to the batter and on top of the brownies before placing them in the oven.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe.  I will never use any other brownie recipe.

These were definitely the best brownies I have ever made!  My daughter, who is a brownie purist, loved them as is.  I think they were great, but would be even better with some kind of chips (white chocolate, butterscotch, etc.) and/or nuts added.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  So quick and easy to make.

The first batch I made with this recipe, I used an 8 x 8 glass pan.  The smaller pan with a heavy glass pan required some extra cooking time.  So when I first took them out of the oven, they were still runny inside.  It took about 7 more minutes.  So I tried a second batch in a standard brownie pan and made one tweak.  I mixed 2 tablespoons of espresso powder into 2 tablespoons of the boiling water.  What a difference it made!  They were so rich and very fudgy.  I did also throw in some chocolate chips  for some chewy chunks.  I will make this my go-to brownie recipe from now on.

very good
i am not a baker but these were easy and delicious
i used both semisweet and white chocolate chips
and i added three crunched up skor bars
kept the rest of the recipe exactly as written
the skor bars added an extra level of yummy and also got lots of compliments!

mmm. These brownies were so good. Nice and fudgy. So easy too! I did have to spread them a bit thin because of the baking pan I used. And i cooked them  for less, just because I didnt want them to come out dry. Good thing they did not.

These are really, really good and very easy to make.  My 11 year old did most of the work with just a little assistance from me.  We followed the advice of another reviewer and used a higher end brand of chocolate chips.  Will definitely make again.

Wow...fantastic!  Brownies are one of those things that are either great, or just not good at all...these are FABULOUS...and so fudgey! I read someone who said, they weren't fudgey...they are way off in left field.  I marbled some peanut butter on half for my husband, and next time i'm going to layer brownies, peanut butter (maybe even my chocolate peanut butter from whole foods) and then another layer of brownies...OOO thank you for the stomach ache! haha, i ate too much.

No more mixes!! Best brownies ever! Be sure to let them bake for only 25 min so they can be fudgy.  First time I made them, they weren't as good and not as chewy. I also added chocolate chips to the batter.  Very very good!!!

We loved these! They were soo easy and good! We used 1 cup of milk chocolate chips and 1/3 cup of unsweetened cocoa! It was soo yummy! We beat our eggs seperately and it made all the difference to the batter. it was not cake like at all! Soo yummy!

These brownies were so good. The best homemade recipe that I have found for brownies.  The only change I made was in the chocolate.  I put 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips, 2 milk chocolate Hershey bars and 1 dark chocolate candy bar.  Plus I add a handful of chocolate chips to the batter after mixing in all the ingredients.  Thanks for a great recipe!

So amazing! Much better than another homemade brownie recipe I tried that just used cocoa powder. These are so rich and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, cooked for 25 minutes, and when the brownies came out of the oven I sprinkled about 1/4 cup chocolate chips on top.

All I can say is: MMMMM... These are full of chocolatey flavor, moist, and hold together well. However, they are MUCH better when they are FRESH and warm. These are light, moist, and fluffy, so if you're looking for fudgy, chewy brownies then this is not what you're looking for.

These were very chocolate-y and good! So rich that you couldn't even taste the 1/4 cup of pureed spinach I added. It took about 10 minutes longer than recommended to bake, but they turned out great!

These are pretty good.  They have a wonderful texture to them.  It's between cake like and fudge.  Hard to explain, but they are worth trying.  Thanks for the recipe.  I like to make things from scratch so I know what is going in them versus buying them in a box.

These were great and easy to make!  They were a bit cakey.  Next time I think I will use some extra chocolate chips to add after the batter is done.

Sooo good!  I added 1/2 C of chocolate chips to the batter b/f baking.  Got rave reviews from everyone at work.  I even messed up and mixed the chocolate chips, sugar, water and butter together for melting instead of adding the chips after the other ingredients were melted.  They still turned out great!  Will definitely be making these again.  Think I will add peanut butter or butterscotch chips to the batter next time, just for kicks.

It's a rainy Saturday afternoon so I decided to bake brownies.  These brownies turned out very good.  Very fudgy, which is what we both love.  They were easy to make and tasted delicious.

These brownies are good.  I used the Milk Chocolate chips, as another reviewer claimed it would make them taste sweeter.  Well, it didn't.  I used the Kroger brand, but next time I will try Nestle or Ghiradelli chips and stick to the semi-sweet.  I will also bake them a bit longer than 30 minutes since the middle is a tad undercooked....maybe 33-35 minutes.  But, overall a good recipe!

These were good.  I am not raving about them; but they were good.  I only used 1 egg because I wanted to make sure they were more fudge like than cake like.  I did not have any issues with them being underdone or fallen in the middle.  I did think they would be more chocolate-y tasting, perhaps sweeter.  It seemed like there may be too much salt.  Crispy on the top and chewy inside.  May make again, tweaking a few things, maybe put in both eggs next time.

These were good. I followed the recipe exactly, and they were definitely moist and chewy, but the taste was not all that I was hoping for. Overall, a great brownie!

Unbelievable! Best ever....the only change I made was to add the remainder of the bag of chocolate chips as a "topping" before I baked them. Wow. Yum. If you love fudgy brownies, you will love these!

Mmmm ... that describes these brownies perfectly!  I doubled the recipe, threw in an extra cup of chocolate chips (which probably weren't necessary!) and baked in a 9 x 13 pan for maybe 5 minutes longer than called for, and they were wonderful!  A very fudgey, thick brownie ... while we ate them plain at a backyard picnic, they would also go great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a little hot fudge.  I'll be making these again soon!

These brownies were so rich & moist. I made them just as the recipe said. Although; it is cheaper to just by the brownies in the box (Pillsbury, etc...), they taste almost the same.
Great recipe if you want homemade.

This is just how I like my brownies (rich, chewy, NOT cakelike!!!) so these were perfect. I followed another user's advice and used a 12oz bag of chips reserving the extra half cup to sprinkle on top before baking. Think I'll add some peanut butter chips next time!!!

Soooo tasty!  This was my first shot at making brownies from scratch, and not from a little red box.  They were a big hit!  I used half semi sweet chocolate chips, and half Hershey's Special Dark.  They were so rich, and I served them warm w/ ice cream.  I will definitely use this recipe exclusively in the future when making brownies.  Thanks!

This is very rich. The chocolate batter was very thick and was hard to stir. I think I will try it again but use more water. I will also eliminate salt.

Great recipe!  I added white chocolate chips and milk chocolate chips to the end batter, and they were great.  After they came out of the oven, I chilled them in the freezer--mostly just to cool them before I cut them--but they ended up to be so delicious--very fudge-like and dense.  I will definitely make this recipe again (And may add either butterscotch chips or walnuts)!

(BTW, it works great doubled and baked in a 13x9 pan.  You have to bake it for a bit longer, and in the last five minutes or so, I turned up the oven to 375.)

Very delicious, and very easy to make. Followed recipe exactly, and literally "threw" it together in a few minutes! Only thing is that it's not AS chocolate-y as I like..so next time I may add some extra chocolate chips or peanut butter chips before baking. *edit* Tried this again, but used the entire bag of chocolate chips (12oz) with an extra tbsp of water. added some chocolate chips and chopped peanut butter cups, and they came out moist, chewy and fudgy...delicious!

This recipe has become a standard keeper in our home after trying it once! It is simple and easy, yielding super yummy brownies. By using the chips, they are most and rich. I am going to experiment next time by adding a peanut butter swirl on top or by adding chopped walnuts...

These brownies were so easy! The texture was perfect, fudgy not cakey with a thin flaky top. Loved them!

Amazing - I didn't have vanilla so I added a little almond and it was awesome with ice cream - I will definitely make these again!

Very good recipe. I ended up using chocolate left over from last night's chocolate fondue, and it worked out perfectly. Also, I use whole wheat flour for nearly all of my baking, and it lends itself well to this recipe. It's a little grittier, but that's how I like it, honestly. So if you're down with the whole wheat, go ahead and use it here! 

Also, I like that these brownies are not too sweet. I'll definitely make them again!

These were awesome!  Anyone who thinks these are "cake" like didn't follow the recipe!  Definately use the whole bag of chocolate chips, do not overbake, and let sit overnight covered after cooling.  Great recipe.

I love this brownie! After reading that some people said they came out cakey, I was a bit worried b/c I love a fudgy brownie. I am a total box brownie lover, but this is tops! I think it's the perfect combo of cakey and fudgy. The only downfall is that it doesn't cut into squares really well, but many brownies don't. I'm making them for a community bake sale and I'm sure they will be a hit even if they don't look like perfect little squares. And the bonus is that I get to eat the ones that look a little too mangled!

these were easy and quick to make and  I had everything on hand too, but they were to cakey for me. I like a more chewy dense brownie, but I was craving choc and it did the trick. Next time I would put choc frosting on it

I chose this brownie because of the many rave reviews. I came out with a cake like brownie instead of fudge, the only thing I did different was used bakers semisweet baking choclate that I chunked into little morsels instead of chocolate chip morsels I guess maybe that was one of my mistakes.

These were so fun to make-and really really good. My fiance is going to love me forever because of these brownies. He loves rich sweets that you need a glass of milk with-and I had to hide these from him. I will never ever use a box mix for brownies-these were easy and so good.

I love brownies but this recipe was middle of the road for me.  Definitely have had better.  Don't think the chocolate chips gave it a very fudgy flavor but average chocolate chip flavor.

I made it yesterday and it was yummy , it`s my first time to bake brownie from scrach.
it totally satisfied my chocolate craving, the cocolate chips makes it so moist ..not like a cake , actually it`s a chocolate like brownie .
I thought the sugar will be to much so I just used 1/4 cup and it was enough for me .
it`s the best brownie i have ever eaten in my entire life...thank you for this amazing simple delicious recipe.

I doubled the recipe and baked in a 10x15, for maybe 5-10 more minutes (use a toothpick test). Instead of doubling the vanilla to 1 tsp, accidentally used 1 tbsp.

5 stars.

Quick and easy! Plus, it was great to only dirty one pot. They turned out perfectly after cooking for 25 minutes - great with ice cream :o) Only change I made was to use 1/2 cup each of bittersweet, semi-sweet and milk chocolate chips, because that was all I had left in the cupboard.

Definitely a GREAT quick brownie recipe, especially when you don't have cocoa around! Pretty fudgy, just how I like it , and I took another reviewers recommendation to add some extra chips to the batter so it was chunky. Yum!

I never use cococa powder so naturally, never have it on hand so I'm really glad I came across a brownie recipe that doesn't call for it. Very handy and useful. The brownies are good, not the best I've had, but I still enjoy them. I'll make them again to see if they live up to what everyone else is saying about them.

Simple, quick, and delicious. I baked them in an 8"x10" rectangular dish because I didn't have a square one, for about 25 minutes at 350 degrees C. I also replaced the water with milk.

No complaints at all - these are perfect fudgy brownies. Thanks so much for sharing!

I've been searching for years for the perfect brownie recipe--I've tried cookbooks and most of the recipes on this site. Without a doubt, this is the BEST. I add a handful or two of white chocolate chips into the batter and sprinkle a few on top for contrast. Just make sure not to overcook the brownies and you can't go wrong.

These brownies are delicious! I will have to double it next time I make them. I also suggest leaving them overnight - you'll wake up in the morning to some delicious, moist and oh so perfect brownies! Definetely a favorite. Never giong to use box mix again. Thanks!

These are the best brownies ever! I love that they used chocolate chips instead of cocoa since that's not something I keep on hamd.

Excellent Brownie, rich chocolate flavor...I'll never go back to box!
I did wisk the egg and vanilla together before pouring into choc mixture. I baked it for 30 minutes and voila~PERFECT!!

I normally don't like rating recipes if I have changed something but since I did not change any proportions, I'll allow this one. I used chocolate couverture instead of  chocolate chips which is just a better quality chocolate. That will improve the flavor though. It produced a very nice texture, simple brownie.

I ran out of cocoa and wanted to make brownies. I came across this recipe, read the reviews and made them for Thanksgiving. They got rave reviews. They came out very fudgy, almost like candy. They were very yummy, if this is the type of brownie you enjoy. I frosted them and sprinkled them with pecans. I real treat and easy to make!!!

I was in the mood for brownies and realized I didn't have any baking chocolate so searched and found this recipe.  YUM!  They are moist and chocolately and came together so quickly.  I only had 1 egg so I used 1/2 cup of applesauce in place of the 2nd egg.  Hmmm... sounds like I should have been at the grocery store instead of making brownies! :)

I had to make about 40 servings, so I made two batches. I thought the recipe could have been edited a tad. When I removed the melted butter+water+sugar from the stove and added chocolate chips, it did not melt the chips to a smooth batter. So, for the next batch I added the chips on the stove and it gave it a much smoother/easier batter to work with. That is my only gripe with this recipe...

I thought these were really good...the closest flavor to boxed brownies.  I don't recommend this recipe if you like fudgy brownies.

AWESOME brownies! Fudgy taste, glossy tops (like boxed brownies). Followed recipe ingredients exactly, but melted the chocolate chips in a double boiler before adding to the sugar mixture. Superior to any other brownie recipe on this site. Not cakey at all. This is my new go-to brownie recipe! Thanks. :)

This recipe is just wonderful!!!! Best I've ever made! And yet so easy! I was reading the other reviews and mine did not turn out bowl-shaped or salty. However, I found that the boiling mixture alone was insufficient to melt the chocolate properly, as it gave me more of a pasty texture. I had to add a little extra heat. The taste is very fudgy which I love. All I have left to say is, well....mmmmm

These are WONDERFUL! I used 5 tbsp. of butter. The batter was a little so I added a little half and half to thin it. That was a mistake. They came out raw in the center, just like a lava cake. Too bad I didn't have any ice cream! I put them back in and baked for a long time until they firmed up. These do not taste like traditional brownies, more like what brownies in heaven will taste like(I hope)! DO NOT taste the batter while mixing! It took every ounce of will power I had not to eat the batter. I almost lost. These are way too good. My 3 year old chocoholic son is finishing them off as I type. These are very rich, my 12 year old won't eat them. Defineatly for rich chocolate lovers. I would serve small portions because of the richness. everyone should make these at least once.Thanks for sharing!

I don't know why, but mine also came out bowl shaped, maybe they were underbaked. It didn't matter though they were still great. I added a thin layer of chocolate icing and diced peanuts.

These are pretty good, but almost too rich and chocolatey for me.  Easy to make, and they do have a good flavor.  The texture is pretty good too, but I prefer the Best Brownies recipe on this site for both texture and flavor.  I added 1/3 cup chopped walnuts.

Really great recipe... easy to make. Rich, moist and chocolatey. I didn't have a pan so used a muffin tray instead. The recipe made 6 large muffins/brownies which were amazing served warm with thick cream. Will definitely make again.

This is what I'm talking about!  Great brownie.  I used skim milk instead of water, other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  The middle fell, but what a lovely gooey middle it was!!
