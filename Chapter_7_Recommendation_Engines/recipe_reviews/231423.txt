Doubled this recipe and was a hit! Cut oregano and salt in half and was wonderfully flavorful. Subbed Gouda for Cheddar.Made one with a crust and one without- both good! I felt like they were very 'small servings' both my quiches were only about .75" deep, (they puffed up in oven, then settled much thinner) so next time will triple recipe for two pies.

Made this last night for the first time and everyone loved it! I did not use deep dish. I bought the regular refrigerator pie crust. Since there were two pie crust in the box, I went ahead and doubled recipe. If you do not double the recipe you will have the perfect amount for one regular pie crust. I followed the ingredients exactly as given, except I did not have oregano or thyme. I used italian seasoning instead.  The quiche came out perfect and the taste was exactly what we were hoping for!

Made this for the RECIPE GROUP this week. I doubled the broccoli, milk,and mustard and used 7 eggs. Discovered I was out of oregano so used Italian seasoning in its place and omitted the thyme as it is in the Italian seasoning. Added a little chopped onion and minced garlic. Left the cheese amounts the same. It took almost all the mixture to fill the 9" deep pie crust so doubling is definitely necessary. Made a mini crustless quiche with the leftover. The quiche was good but not what you would say mmmm this is really good. Unless I see some new reviews with good suggestions on improving the taste I probably would not make this again.

I brought this to a "ladies club meeting"; it received HIGH praise!  Yay! (In fact: if there was a 6 star rating...I'd rank it 6 stars!)
I made it as listed except: 6 eggs vs 4, therefore I used 3/4 cup milk vs 1/2 cup.  I also omitted the thyme, since I didn't have any.  Also- I didn't prick the crust nor oil it.  I used pie weights when I baked the crust and I sprayed the quiche pan with Pam beforehand.
I also cut 4 grape tomatoes and removed the seeds and interior.  (This was primarily done for color and decoration)
All else was as written in the original recipe.  It was FANTASTIC!  Thanks JJ's mom!!!!

I love this recipe and have made it many times.  I love to make this for guests for breakfast and they rave over it.  I followed other reviewers suggestions for changes.  The changes make it a five star in my opinion.  The changes I made were adding about 2/3 cup or more chopped ham, reducing the oregano to 1/2 tsp and I've added gouda instead of cheddar sometimes too.  Fresh grated Parmesan cheese is so much better in this recipe also. It won't disappoint.

Did what previous reviewer suggested and cut the oregano in half.  I also added about 2/3 cup of leftover ham that I diced into small cubes.  Family loved it, and requested for me to make it again in the near future.

This recipe has potential, but the oregano was WAY overpowering.  Next time will cut the oregano in half and maybe add some bacon.

Made this for Recipe Group...Me and the little guy thought this was really good, but hubby didn't care for it. It did take longer for mine to cook (about 60-70 minutes), but I also added cheese into it (parmesan, american and asiago), so maybe that's why. I used a box of frozen, chopped broccoli, that I thawed and that worked great. Also, I do not care for Thyme or a heavy oregano flavor, so I used garlic and onion powders and maybe 1/4 teaspoon Italian seasoning. This had good flavor, w/ the additions, and I would def. make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Whoa...way too much oregano and I only used 1/2 tsp based on reviews.  I made it crustless and it was perfectly baked in 30 minutes.  I won't be making this again;  there are so many better recipes on AR.

Added 1 extra egg, feta cheese, mozzarella cheese, and minced dried onions, decreased parmesan cheese and pretty much rough measured everything til it looked good.  Every one loved it!  I used store bought refrigerated pie crust (no oil) and  convection baked it in a ceramic quiche dish...yum!

Recipe Group Selection:  10, August 2013 ~ Had this for dinner tonight with ham slices.  Everyone really enjoyed this.  I prepared in a regular size pie pan rather than a deep dish.  I would not have had enough filling for a deep dish.  I also used fresh oregano in place of the dried, pepper jack in place of the Cheddar and only used ¼ tsp. of thyme.  It did take longer than 40 minutes to bake.  Mine took about 50 minutes.  This baked up and set up nicely.  The quiche cut and served great too.  All in all, this is a good quiche and I will make it again – next time I think I will add some diced onions and fresh tomatoes to the broccoli mixture.

I wanted to like this but did not.  Made for recipe group.  Since it was my first time making it, and for the group, I tried to follow nearly exactly, which I did.  The only change was I only used 1/2 the Oregano and a bit more cheddar cheese.  The crust did not get browned at all at 350 for 8 minutes when brushed with oil.  Had to pre-cook it much longer.  Probably needed a higher temp.  Used fresh broccoli that I pulsed in food processor until very fine.  The filling did not fill my crust very high.  In my opinion needed onion and more milk.  When I make quiche it usually has a higher ratio of milk to eggs to make more of a custard.

This is a FANTASTIC recipe. Super easy, delicious and very elegant. I suggest putting the grated parmesan into the egg mixture.

This was easy enough to make and was ok in texture and flavor. But personally I didn’t like so much thyme flavor. I cut the amount down and only used half of what was called for. I think if I make it again I’d do only a punch of thyme or non at all. Maybe add fresh basil instead. Another idea maybe add bacon and basil. So if I make again that’s what I’ll do.

This was very quick and easy to make.  I even tweaked it a little by adding some ham an onions and added two extra eggs.  For the broccoli I did one cup of steam fresh florets.

I made the recipe as written and I am really enjoying it.  I like herbs.  So the amount of oregano didn’t bother me at all.  I would make this again.

This was a great quiche. I made it exactly according to the directions. I doubled the recipe and was able to fill two 9 inch deep dish pie shell’s. The cooking time was exactly 40 minutes. This was perfect!

This has become a family favorite. People in my house actually cheer when I’m serving this quiche! The one thing that I do differently is to bake for 15 minutes before putting the cheese in. Fantastic!

I made this recipe & it turned out excellent.  I did not have any dijon mustard, so used slightly less yellow mustard with a bit of mayo mixed in.  I bought a Pillsbury pre-made pie crust & followed the package directions. Otherwise it was very tasty.

Great recipe! I modified it by adding Swiss and jalapeño pepper jack cheeses along with the cheddar and Parmesan. Omitted the oregano and used herbs de Provençal instead, and added 1/4 sweet onion and one clove garlic - both chopped finely and sautéed with the brocolli. It was a big hit Christmas Eve and Christmas morning!

It's a really good quiche. I can't eat parmesan, so I used just the cheddar and added some more salt and a little garlic powder, to make up for the lack of that tangy cheese.  Will definitely make it again.

Great recipe, I've made it a few times now with a couple of modifications.  Following others suggestions, I went with less oregano and usually use one more egg, more broccoli, and one time added bacon which was a huge hit.  I use a seasoned 9" cast iron skillet and do not use a crust.  Then I follow the rest of the recipe to the letter.

It was good, but I think it needs maybe garlic or something.  I will make again, but put cheese on after it is cooked, too.

I thought the oregano somewhat overwhelmed the flavor.  It was quiche pizza.  My wife, not an oregano fan, really didn't like what it did to the quiche.

I added another egg to support more broccoli and cheese - a good quick weeknight meal

Used half and half and sautéed broccoli per another recipe.  May add more spices next time.

I made this with frozen broccoli but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I microwaved the broccoli until warm and then proceeded with the recipe. It was tasty but needed a bit of extra seasoning at serving time.

This is very easy and doesn't take as long to cook like other quiches I've made. I made two  regular pie size ones because I had them in the freezer already. I just added another half of recipe ingredients. I used frozen steamer bag of broccoli crowns chopped and cooled slightly.  I didn't change any of the directions.  It cooked in 40 min exactly. I did precious the crust as directed. I may change up ingredients next time just to have a different version.  Anyone can do this.
