A great recipe. My only change- I added a packet of taco seasoning like other reviewers suggested.  Perfect for a party or football game.

My husband LOVED this recipe.  I did take the advice of other reviewers and added taco seasoning.  That gives it a needed kick.  Very good with chips or bread.

This was wonderful.  My husband loved it.  I used taco seasoning instead of red pepper.  Thank you!  I plan to make this potlucks and get togethers too.

Thanks!

This was easy, but I didn't find it especially great or interesting. There are much better cheese dips out there.

I did add the taco seasoning and it was very good.  I think next time I would add jalapenos just to make it spicier.

This was bland, boring, and downright blah.  I think more spice is needed.  If I were to try again, I would put a packet of taco seasoning in it instead of the chili powder.
