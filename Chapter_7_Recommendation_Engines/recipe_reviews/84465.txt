We love these muffins!  I've tried with blueberries instead of strawberries, too, and that tastes good as well.  You can substitute applesauce for the oil, splenda for the sugar and oatmeal for 1/4 of the white flour to make a healthier recipe.

I have made these muffins twice now, and there are two equally good variations of them. The original strawberry lemon, and blueberry orange. (substitute blueberries for strawberries, and orange juice for lemon juice), grate a little bit of zest to go over the top. Made a batch of these for my friend for her birthday too, and she really enjoyed them -even if they were a little burnt-. I can also see these being a big hit with kids too.

These were excellent!  The fresh strawberries were so delicious in these muffins.  I used a fresh-picked lemon from our tree and the combination of the lemon and strawberry flavors is just so nice!  I used 1 1/4 cup  all-purpose flour and 1/2 cup rolled oats instead of the wheat flour called for in the recipe b/c I didn't have any.  It worked out great!  This is a keeper for us!  :)

Yummy! I was looking for lazy day muffin recipies and this one was great.  The wheat flour stood out more than I expected.  I used frozen strawberries that I sliced every which way and lemon juice instead of a zested and juiced lemon.  It was a very light taste & great with cream cheese frosting.

I used lactose-free milk and I omitted the additional brown sugar. I was worried about not having enough liquid for these muffins because I've baked with whole wheat flour and it tends to soak up more liquid than AP flour. I did add one large mashed banana to help with that. Even with the additional banana, these did turn out a little dry. It could be that my lemon was a on the small side, you never really know. I would like to make these again and either add an additional egg or maybe a quarter cup so more of milk. As is, it's a good muffin recipe.

...Kids loved these muffins.  I had a little over a cup of diced strawberries and sprinkled them with sugar to sweeten them up a bit and I also made a lemon glaze that I spooned on top once out of the oven.  I thought they tasted better the next day after sitting in the fridge for a while...These tart little muffins are excellent with a tall glass of milk or hot cup of coffee...thanks for sharing such a nice recipe!

This recipe was very easy and very delicious!  I took my kids strawberry picking and we had some pretty ripe ones, so I needed a recipe to use the extra ripe ones in.  I found this and it is a keeper!  Additionally, I topped the muffins with a glaze of lemon juice and powdered sugar--made them extra tangy.  Highly recommended!

Delicious and MOIST!  I didn't deviate from the recipe at all (odd for me!) and they came out wonderful!  What a nice way to use fresh strawberries!  My 3 year old has been eating them for breakfast- fresh fruit and whole wheat flour- I love it when I find something that's sort of healthy that she actually likes!  Thanks for the recipe!

These were excellent! I didn't change anything other than double the recipe, which ended up making 24 regular size muffins and 24 mini-muffins. The flavor was really good. I will definitely make these again!

This muffin had great flavor, but it was really dense. The taste testers didn't care for the texture especially after they cooled. We used all white flour, but didn't think that was a big factor.

These were amazing! I followed the suggetsion to substitute applesauce for the oil, splenda for the sugar and oatmeal for 1/4 of the white flour. So they tasted great and didn't make me feel guilty! Also, if you just have bottled lemon juice, 2-3 tablespoons is equivalent to the juice of one lemon.

These were very good. Although, I admit, I used limes instead of lemons because I had so many already in the house. The flavor was delicious and everyone enjoyed them.

These were very good.  The only suggestion I would make is to make them with blueberries (which I did).  There is nothing like the combination of blueberries and lemon.

These were phenomenal!  We loved the moistness, lemony flavor, with strawberry chunks.  I did substitute 3/4 C of the white flour with quick oats, and added a TBS of flax, just to up the fiber factor.  My kids had no idea.   I think these would be great for breakfast, in fact, they're almost like eating a dessert!  I disagree with other comments about them being too dense - they were chewy and light!

Delicious! I used all whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup stevia instead of white sugar, and baked in a loaf for about 40 minutes.

This was a sweet little muffin with a delicate strawberry flavor. Very litte of the lemon came through - it's subtle, which surprised me.  I did not find these tart in any way. I should add that to use up all my berries, I upped the strawberries to 2 cups.  Very nice; I would make these again.

These turned out pretty good, followed recipe minus having whole wheat flour and used buttermilk instead of regular milk. Will try them with applesauce instead of the oil next time. Nice lemon flavor!

Yummy! 
I bored bake, and these were delicious. 
They were dense, but they were also very most. I think they're good for a light sweet breakfast on the go? I did brush more lemon juice with a little sugar on top because I like 'em tangy =)

Very very tasty. I didn't have whole wheat flour so I just used all white. And I sprinkled some white sugar on the tops before baking. (also used fresh-picked strawberries). They were dense but in a very pleasant way. Not too sweet but with a lovely zing from the lemon.

As someone who quite often reduces sugar in recipes, I can't believe I'm saying this but these weren't quite sweet enough for our tastes. Also the lemon flavour was barely noticeable. That said they bake up well and look beautiful. So I may try again adding an extra 1/4 cup of brown sugar. Thanks for letting me try.

These are very good! Followed others advice and used 1 1/4  Cups All Purpose Flour and 1/2 Cup Whole Wheat Flour. Also added an additional 1/2 cup of strawberries to use up what I had and sprinkled Raw Sugar on top before baking. Everyone liked the tart/sweetness and said they were moist. Will make again but will up the sugar just a tad if the strawberries used aren't very sweet. Thanks for sharing!

Firstly I would like to thank Jenwee99 who recommended this recipe to me via RE when I posted a request for a recipe to use up some strawberries. I was a little concerned when I read a few of the previous reviews, but decided to give this recipe a try anyway. I did make a few changes. I used fresh instead of frozen strawberries, I used lemon juice, so didn’t add the zest.  I used ½ cup of whole wheat flour and 1 & ¼ cup of AP Flour.  I followed the recipe exactly but did add a few more chopped strawberries, and a sprinkling of brown sugar onto the top of the muffins before cooking. Just so pleased with the results, the muffins have a nice light texture and the taste is so refreshing.  Thank you for sharing this recipe…

I was out of wheat flour so I used all white flour (and added a bit extra). The muffins were nice and crunchy on top, while staying moist inside. I also sprinkled the strawberries with a bit of sugar so they wouldn't sink while baking.

Awesome. Used 3 tbsp lemon juice and 1 1/4 cups chopped frozen strawberries, also subst. water instead of milk and used all purpose flour for the whole amount (no whole wheat flour) and they turned out beautifully moist and delicious! Lemon/icing sugar topping goes well.

These muffins were very delicious! I put just a little over a cup of strawberries and they came out perfect and the lemon adds a wonderful flavor to the muffins. A great way to use up strawberries that are about to go bad!

These are excellent!  I followed the recipe, except for brown sugar and used coconut milk instead of regular.  I only had about 1/3 and substituted the rest with white sugar.  I was nervous because I made 3 dozen of them without trying them first.  I wanted to make something to thank the neighbors.  They were beautiful and delicious.  I didn't find them dense at all, even with the whole wheat flour.  I also juiced one lemon and added enough powdered sugar to make a glaze and spread some on when they were still hot.  I will make again!

Very good! Used all white sugar and added some vanilla. I didn't care that much about the strawberries though... It was a delicious lemon muffin! Be careful, they might be ready a little bit sooner than 25 minutes.

Made these the other day with a few adjustments: reversed the amounts of sugar...used 1/2 c of  brown and 1/4 c of white; blended the brown sugar in with the liquids. Used frozen sliced strawberries and chopped them to blueberry size. My favourite muffin!!

These were okay.  They were very dense, which I do not care for myself.  The flavor was good, though.  My husband liked them and he is a picky eater.  I probably will not make again unless I need to use strawberries and a lemon up quickly.

Good base recipe.  Instead of milk, I used 1/2 cup strawberry yogurt plus 1/4 tsp. baking soda.  The batter got a little thick, so I added a little milk at the end to thin it out.  I also added 1/4 tsp. dried lemon peel in addition to the fresh lemon juice and zest.  The result: the strawberry and lemon flavors were equally strong and tasty and the muffins had a nice, moist texture!

Sorry, but these muffins did NOT turn out well. I followed the recipe(expect I used applesauce instead of oil)...not much flavor..so I thought Hmm...I'll add a mashed banana,vanilla,even coconut extract, dash of cinnamon..Still...NOT much taste..sorta "rubber band" texture..did my best to not overmix. Don't plan on trying this one again. Oh well....

These were ok. I really liked them but I was dissapointed when I couldn't taste the lemon part of the muffin. The strawberries also became a little soggy. I will make them again. My sister liked them even when they were substituted from milk to rice milk. That says a lot!

I used Louisiana Strawberries which are very sweet and only put in 1/2 cup of sugar.  I also used apple sauce for half of the oil.  They initially stuck to the muffin papers but they came out fine after they cooled.  This recipe is very good!

i followed the recipe as written with the exception of the flour - i used entirely white flour
they were stodgy and gummy - didn't rise at all it seems. plus they were far too lemony. this could be because they were dense little hockey pucks, i don't know!
anyway i don't know what happened but they did not turn out for me at all.

These were really tasty! My family loved them. My adjustments: I used buttermilk (personal preference of mine), and a tiny splash of lemon extract instead of the lemon juice. The lemon I zested was also pretty large. My strawberries weren't that sweet, so I tossed them in a little sugar before adding to the mixture. And I found the mixture lacked moisture (probably since I left out the lemon juice), so I added another splash of buttermilk at the end. 20 minutes was enough cooking time. Had a perfect lemon:strawberry flavor and were very moist. Will definitely make again!

I had some very ripe strawberries that needed to be used up, so I thought I'd give this recipe a try.  Only change I made was using all A/P flour (no wheat flour).  You get a nice burst of fresh lemon; the strawberries, not so much.  But in all fairness to the recipe, these were not the best strawberries either.  Only made 10 muffins, they didn't rise much, but were very moist.  Will make again in Spring when strawberries are in season in Florida.

I'm giving four stars for the favour.  I followed the recipe exactly and found these muffins very good but denser than I usually like my muffins.  Mine didn't rise nearly as high as the muffins in the picture.

These muffins were very easy to make. When I had finished preparing them I was amazed at how little time these muffins required. When I got these out of the oven however, they had sunk, but were fully cooked which was a little disappointing. However, these muffins taste great! I'll definitely be making them again.

I used froZen the first time and fresh picked farm stand berries the second, and it was a huge difference. So much more juice, flavor, etc. One lemon and zest was more than enough to make a tangy balance to the sweet berry. But then I zest every millimeter of my lemon. Topped them with turbinado sugar crstals and they are very pretty and delicious!

These were just okay. The first day, they are good muffins; although lacking in lemon flavor.  But the next day and the days after, they become gummy and gooey.  The strawberries make these very moist, almost too moist.  I would only make these if they were going to be eaten the first day.  I would also add some lemon extract to boost the lemon flavor.

Very tasty - 12 muffins didn't last 24 hours!  I used about a cup and a half of strawberries that I sprinkled with a cinnamon-sugar-saffron flavouring and let sit for 20 minutes.  I also used buttermilk because it was there, and added maybe a half teaspoon of vanilla.  Using a medium sized lemon I got about 2 tsp of zest and almost 3 tbsp of juice - lovely and lemony, I will try with raspberries next time!

These were great!  I only had plain white flour, and half a lemon, and half a cup of strawberries, so I added a tsp of vanilla to the mix - delicious!  Light, fluffy, and moist!

I followed the recipe exactly and though tasty, these were a little wet. I'm guessing it's from the strawberries. Perhaps next time I'll decrease the temperature and increase the cooking time and maybe cut back a touch on the lemon juice.

Wow! Really really yummy! Used frozen strawberries and soymilk, maybe a bit less white sugar than called for. Wonderful lemony flavor comes through. Going to be a fav in our house.

I just made these, and they are really delicious. Instead of strawberries I added mixed berries and cherries. The texture is really good and there is just enough lemon. I found I had to add a little more flour because the dough was a bit thin. Also I used all white flour and no whole wheat. I'm really glad I made a double batch too

The flavors were nice, I added 1tsp of cinnamon and 1tsp vanilla extract. Not too sweet, but the muffins were very dense and dry outside but still moist/uncooked inside (I baked them at 350C). If I try this recipe again I will try making mini-muffins instead.

This was a good muffin. More like a Bisquick type muffin than a cake like muffin, but quick and full of flavor. I am not a fan of whole wheat flour so I used all purpose instead. Worked great!! My family ate them up and asked for more!!

I had left over lemons from thanksgiving and found this recipe -it was great!  I loved the light lemon flavor with the strawberries.  I did use frozen strawberries that I chopped in a food processor -my dough did turn pink but it just made my daughter love them even more

A very yummy muffin.  Moist and delicious, what more can you ask for?  I also added a sugary topping and I must admit that my kids ate the top off the muffin and left the rest but they aren't big on muffins no matter what.  I will definitely make this recipe again and can't wait to try the blueberry/orange juice variation.  I would imagine that blueberry/lemon would also be tastey.
Thanks for submitting!

I was slightly disappointed in the recipe since it turned out very dense almost doughy still. I was hoping for light and fluffy muffins. May try adding baking soda next time? And more lemon! Will also add streusel topping for a crunch/texture.

This was a dud for us.  Very dense, very little flavor and the strawberries were very chewy.  My muffin-lovin gang over here didn’t have more than a few bites and most of them ended up in the garbage.  Some recipes I’ll see potential and try to modify but this was far enough off the mark not to get a second try

Love these muffins! We were given several baskets of strawberries and I needed to use them pretty quickly.  
I didn't have whole wheat flour so used all AP and added chopped pecans; also baked at 400 degrees-25" was perfect baking time! The strawberry flavor was so bright but the lemon taste got lost. I love lemon so will adjust lemon flavor next time.  But, definitely a keeper recipe.

I made this with strawberries the first time and with cups of blueberries and a cup of dried cranberries the second time.  Both ways are delicious!  I substitute equal parts of apple sauce for the oil.

I liked these muffins but they weren’t quite as lemony as I would have liked. My kiddos aren’t huge fans of chunks in anything, so if I ever repeat these I would try adding the strawberries after I puréed them up.

I used all whole wheat flour and added walnuts. They were moist and delicious. They could've risen more and I ended up with 20 muffins( probably because of my added chopped walnuts). Overall great recipe!

These muffins were excellent.   Really nice lemon flavor, and not too tart.  Followed the recipe and just added sanding sugar on top for a little extra sweetness and sparkle.   The whole family loved them!

They were too tart for my husband and daughter but I thought they were okay. They are a little on the dense side but are moist. I split the batter in half and made mini muffins, which made 18.

It would be better if the recipe gave an actual measurement for the lemon juice/zest.  Since my lemon was rather large, the lemon flavor is quite pronounced.  Flavor is good, texture very moist, but dense.  Oddly, the muffins stuck badly to the paper liners.

These were delicious and moist. I made these with a change coz I didn't have whole wheat flour on hand - Along with 1 cup of all purpose flour, I added 1 cup of oats (instead of 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour). I added the juice of one whole lemon which made these quite tangy and less sweet. For a good balance of both (especially for those who are not fond of very tangy muffins), I'd suggest adding the juice of only 1/2 or 3/4 a lemon. Oh and I used fresh strawberries which made these muffins even awesome-r in my opinion! Thanks for this recipe! :D

These were quite tasty, more tang than sweet which was nice to have with a cup of tea. They are best warm on day one as they got sticky and a bit mushy the days following. If I bake them again, I would fill the cups more than I usually do because they came out small, and I would add a bit of sugar on top before baking. Alternative my roommate suggested to topping with white sugar: top with a dusting of icing sugar once out of the oven.

Modifications I made: whole wheat flour and oats, sub applesauce no oil, and unsweetened almond milk instead of dairy. 
- mine turned out dense like some of the other reviewers had said... I also made a cream cheese, lemon glaze, I won't do that again. These would be better as a morning bread versus muffins...

These muffins are have a nice lemon flavor and good texture.  We cut the sugar to 1/2 cup total and they came out fine.  I'd use 1/4 cup white and 1/4 cup brown sugar next time and add 1/2 tsp nutmeg.

I wanted to "health up" the muffins a little, so I reversed the quantities of flour (more ww than white), added 2 tbsp of ground flax and substituted applesauce for the oil.  I'm a huge lemon fan, so I used the zest of two lemons to kick it up a notch.  Muffins have a great flavor, but, I agree, a bit dense for my liking...certainly something I'll work on the next time around!

I had blueberries and a lemon to use up so this recipe fit the bill!  I had made another lemon muffin recipe earlier in the day and this batter compared to that one was way thick.  I ended up adding more buttermilk to loosen it up.  As mentioned, I used buttermilk instead of regular milk.  I sprinkled a little Turbinado sugar on top of the batter before the muffins went in the oven.  I was glad that this recipe included some wheat flour and brown sugar.  They are tasty!

Exceedingly moist, but a little low on flavor. A good recipe if you're sick of eating all the strawberries you bought, but the muffins lose the strawberry and lemon taste. I think I'd be better off using a different recipe that highlights the strawberries better.

Makes a great bread!! ...I took another viewer's idea of using 1 1/4 cup flour and a 1/2 cup rolled oats in place of the wheat flour. I didn't feel like making muffins so I greased and floured a loaf pan and cooked it at 375 for 55 minutes. Night and moist and VERY yummy!!

Maybe I just don't like baked strawberries.  These seemed soggy from the berries, and the muffins were nothing special on their own.  Not a repeater recipe for me.

I make this again and again and love them every time. I use 1 and 3/4 cup all-purpose flour instead of including the wheat flour and I really feel it changes the whole flavor of the muffin. I also use far more strawberries than it calls for (2-3 cups), but it only increases the moisture and flavor.

Great, simple recipe! I added a little more strawberries which I personally enjoyed, but my partner felt it made them "too moist" (pish posh). I'll definitely make these again.

i chose this recipe 'cos i wanted to use up my strawberries in the fridge, but not enough for them to take the leading role...  not satisfactory...  the muffins did rise nicely, but the taste was sssoooo bland -- i had already put in more than enough lemon juice and zest, yet i could not taste them...  luckily i had decided to put in some poppy seeds, and also some more zest on top before baking, which had helped to remind me that, "oh well, this is a lemon muffin..."   ** UPDATE ** i am giving this 1 more star 12 hours later.  i was disappointed last night and i threw the rest into the fridge.  this morning i microwaved one for breakfast -- it's moist, and it has a better lemon flavor now (still can't taste the strawberries though)

This is a great recipe! Super easy to make, and perfect for using up all those strawberries and lemons that have come into season right now. I added 1/2 tb of almond extract and a sprinkling of cinnamon and nutmeg. These muffins were delicious and made a great dessert with vanilla ice cream and fresh strawberries on top!

These were really wonderful muffins with a delicious strawberry and lemon flavor.  I did use strawberries in season, and I made sure I got quite a bit of lemon juice out of the lemon.  I made them as is, but since I had some leftover strudel topping in the freezer (from the Best Ever Blueberry Muffins, this site), I added a bit on top.  They were great.  The tart of the lemon was balanced by the topping, so next time I might just add a little bit of sugar rather than strudel.

This is a tasty recipe.  I needed to use up about 1 1/2 cups of strawberries before they turned, so I just roughly chopped them for this recipe.  I used applesauce instead of oil, and spelt flour instead of wheat flour.  I also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.  They are very dense and delicious.  The tart lemon flavor is nice with the strawberries.  I would make these again.

We really enjoyed these muffins, the blend of lemon & strawberry is very tasty.  To add a little more sweetness, I sprinkled a layer of sugar on top of the batter before baking.  It also created a nice, lightly crispy top.

These come out delicious and quite moist.  I used frozen blueberries (drained and rinsed) and the flavor was very good. Topped with sweetened cream cheese, they were a big hit.
