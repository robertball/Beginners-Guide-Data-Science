Wow...these turned out delicious and with an excellent texture! I made the recipe with 2 drained and rinsed cans of garbanzo beans. (Turns out the equivalent should have been 4 cans!) Because of my accidental omission, the patties were a bit sticky to work with, but then they cooked up beautifully. We ate with tomato slices and avocado slices. If you like it spicy, add a little bit of hot sauce after, or cayenne (sparingly) while mixing the ingredients together.  Also great with a dollop of plain Greek yogurt and a squeeze of lemon juice. Delighted and can't wait to try again!

Wow! These do have amazing flavor even though I used less garlic. The result is a lovely patty that is so flaky and crispy on the outside, it melts in your mouth. The inside is moist and tender but holds up to a knife and fork. It goes very well with guacamole. Thank you for this fantastic recipe.

Great recipe! Very Easy and flavorful.  
Just a little oil spray in a hot pan.
