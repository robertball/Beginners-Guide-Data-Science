I wasn't sure what to expect with this recipe. It is really good, easy, and flavorful. I did use more ground beef than it called for. I used a whole pound because that is what I had defrosted. I think next time I will again use the whole pound. Thanks for a really good recipe.

This was very tasty and incredibly easy!  I could incorporate all 4 food groups and my kids had no idea - they just knew they wanted more!

This recipe is a really great idea and a bit of a retake on something my mom used to make which was savoury bread and butter pudding, but this is better because everything is nice and moist.  I cheated a lot and used a packet of pre-cooked spaghetti mince which I make in huge quantities and keep in the freezer for quick dinners, but which has all the ingredients required for the mince in this recipe anyway.  I chopped some extra fresh tomatoes and threw those in to up the veggie content.  I used leftover hotdog rolls, cubed.  I also used 4 eggs, milk and no stock.  I then microwaved it, covered, for about 6 mins.  Added grated cheese and then 2 mins more.  Fab idea!

My husband made this recipe and followed it exactly.  It smelled really really good while it was cooking but we had a few complaints about the taste.   It needed more meat (or less bread)and it just seemed as if something was missing.  Maybe some shredded mozzerella cheese?  I'm not sure but I'm not going to find out because I don't plan on making it again.  Sorry.

This was really good, and a nice change from pasta. I would double the recipe (and we're only a family of four with one picky eater). I threw in some shredded mozzarella and used two eggs instead of three. The wine gives a great flavor.

This recipe was OK - my husband said he would eat it again (so I'll give it 3 stars) but I don't think I'd make it again.  It seemed too similar to an egg & bread breakfast casserole that I make to have all the "meatball" ingredients.

I'm giving this three stars because I was the only one in my family who liked it.  My husband said it was ok, but asked me not to make it again.  

I thought it was good, a little too much bread but very flavorable.

WOW!  I have to admit that the recipe didn't sound that great to me, but I just had to try it. I am glad that I did! It is not only a quick and easy recipe, but very delicious as well! I was surprised at the wonderful flavors of the dish. Instead of diced tomatoes, I used a thick tomatoe sauce (great way to use leftover meatballs and spaghetti sauce as well). Since I omitted the red wine, I increased  the chicken broth to 3/4 cup to balance the liquid ingredients. I poured the chicken broth on first, then the egg mixture, and then the meat mixture, mixing gently after each addition.  Let the mixture sit for a few minutes before placing in oven so that more of the liquids can be absorbed by the bread. Baked for 30 minutes.

A very good recipe, even my husband, who isn't a big bread fan, liked it. I did double the amount of meat knowing who I was cooking for and would do so again in the future. The wine adds such a awesome flavor level so don't even think of leaving it out. This is a great way to use up those few pieces of bread that seem to pile up in the freezer.

I love this recipe. I change it up every time I make it depending on what I have on hand. One of my favorites is substituting ground beef for sausage. I always use a full pound of meat whether it's ground beef or sausage. I never put this wine in as we aren't red wine drinkers. I have even made this and kept the liquid separate from the other ingredients and put everything in the fridge for my husband to put together and heat up.

Easy and tasty, a great way to use up leftovers.  I substituted a cup of spaghetti sauce and some water for the wine and tomatoes simply because that's what I had on hand.  I mixed everything except the egg mixture together and let it sit in the fridge for a couple of days.  I added the egg mixture and let it soak for another 9-10 hours before baking.  Very good!

My toddler loved this, my husband didn't care for it and I thought it was just okay.  I followed the recipe though used mozzarella cheese since it's what I had in the fridge.  It's an easy recipe and I would advise lightly greasing the pan before putting the bread in it.

This was pretty good, tho I had to tweak it a little to use up the meatballs and sauce I had in the fridge, and I had no red wine or half and half. My husband thought at first that it was some kind of squash, maybe because I used a multi grain bread. It looked like something I'd never want to eat before I put it in the oven (think baby birds being fed), but it tasted pretty good. I thought it looked a little dry, so I garnished it with fresh cut tomatoes and fresh basil. I'll make again per the directions, and maybe it'll be five stars for us then.
