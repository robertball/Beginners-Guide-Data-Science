As a Texan it was a stretch for me to use a gumbo recipe from up north - lol - but this turned out pretty good. It was a little tomatoey at first but after adding a little more chicken broth, a couple tsp of Gumbo File and some fresh Gulf trout it was Awesome!  I liked the recipe was straightforward and didn't have 40 ingredients.  Very good.

Great recipe -- I crushed tomatoes instead of diced - and Swansons canned chicken - I literally had all the ingredients in the house!  Made cornbread to serve with it!  Yummy and easy!

We all loved it! Used spicy Clamato juice instead of V8. Also added diced Serrano and jalapeño peppers along with bell peppers. Used 1 cup of chicken broth from boiled chicken and added the rest water with chicken bouillon. Everything else normal! Great recipe!

This was really good.  Making it for the second time right now.  I added a little celery and zucchini.  Used less creole seasoning because I wasn't sure if it would be too hot.  Cooked some rice with garlic to go with it.  My neighbor said I should cook it with okra, so maybe next time, I'll do that, as gumbo is supposed to have okra in it?? I also added two ripe tomatoes, cut into little pieces.

It turned out delicious and was a big hit with the family. I didn't have spicy V8 so used Mr and Mrs T bloody Mary mix and added some horseradish sauce. I used red bell peppers bc I prefer them and mixed up some creole seasoning from chef John bc I didn't have any on hand. I will definitely be making this again!

Fantastic, the the right amount of spice!  I didn't have enough shrimp, so I added pieces of scallops to make up the difference.  Love it!!

I followed the recipe exactly but found the area where the sausage was cooked to be vague.  I had Italian sausage in casings but wasn't sure if I was supposed to remove the casing because it described cooking until it was browned and crumbly.  I instead cooked it in the casing from the beginning and then sliced it when cooled.  I also used all the remnants from the sausage to cook the onion and green peppers.  Worked out great.

This was just THE BEST! I had so many compliments on this dish. The only thing I did differently was adding a can of Rotel in place of the V8. I will make this many times!

I did this in a crockpot.  8 hours on low.  I also browned the chicken and sausage before slicing them up.  I didn't shred the chicken I chose to chop it instead.  Such a great dish.

Very good!  I followed the recipe exactly but added one bag of frozen cut okra.  Gumbo turned out a little too thick for my tastes so I'll cut down on the flour next time.  This recipe makes a TON of food.  I froze most of it initially for easy meals during the workweek, but decided to take it to work instead.  I brought my slow cooker and just heated up the defrosted leftovers and fed a slew of coworkers for lunch.  Soup was a hit and tasted better after freezing.

Great recipe the first couple of times but the last time I made it I found it watery and not very spicy.  Can't figure out what I did but will need to spice it up a little the next time.

Everyone loved the Gumbo. Even my mother who dislikes Gumbo. Added okra, corn, and lemon juice. It was a nice touch. The changes I made were good but recipe is good as is.

Only one word needed for this recipe...DELICIOUS! 

I followed the recipe exactly, except omitted shrimp and upped the chicken and sausage to account for it.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious!  I was afraid that it might be too spicy, but it wasn't.  I had no Creole seasoning, so I looked up how to make it.  Luckily, I had all the spices.  Thank you!  We served it over rice.

Made this for the first time tonight, and will admit I was skeptical with the browning the flour method and the spicy tomato juice.  I improvised a little.  Added fish, oysters, clams, some clam juice, and did a few other minor things differently.  And I was pleasantly surprised.  One of the best gumbos I’ve ever made.  Give it a try.

I did not shred the chicken we cubed it instead for a texture we knew our kids would like better.  My husband smoked the chicken breast beforehand and we used spicy Italian sausage.  Did not have creole seasoning so googled a mixture and made my own.  Very happy with how it turned out.

This turned out amazing. I chopped my chicken into pieces and used fresh celery in chunks    I used sausage and cut them into chunks also.  I pretty much made larger chunks of everything to make it heartier.  I put mine over rice but hubby doesn't like rice so I made him linguine noodles to pour his over.  We both loved it.  Big hit   Ate it for a lot more meals.  He asked me to make this again.  Winner!!!

I will use this as my go to gumbo recipe from now on. Delicious. My husband doesn't like spicy foods and this re I've has just the right amount of spices so that it's tasty but not overdone. I had never browned the flour before and wondered if it was necessary. Glad I did it and it wasn't too much trouble. 
I used diced tomatoes with peppers and onions because I had it on hand.
