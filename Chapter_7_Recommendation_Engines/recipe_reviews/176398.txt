I forgot the pecans, but otherwise this was a great way to prepare yams!  I loved it, as did all of our guests.  One suggestion, boil the yams for about 10 minutes to soften them up a bit more.

This was awesome! I've always made yams the way my mother did, with just a brown sugar glaze, so I thought I'd try something new, but not marshmallows because I hate those on yams. This fit what I was looking for perfectly! The family emptied the platter in record time and were asking for more and the recipe. Definitely a keeper!

I never made yams before for Thanksgiving and this is a keeper. My in laws loved it, I had boiled the yams until too tender so I let them cool in pan and put butter and syrup then topping and baked when we got to Grandmas. Worked great!!!

So good!  My 5 year old even asked for seconds and by passed the traditional marshmallow topped version that was also available.  
I did get a lot of liquid in the bottom of my pan...not sure if that was from the specific yams I used.  It did mostly absorb in after sitting out for awhile.  This is definately my new favorite way to make candied yams!
