I absolutely love this recipe. After having made over a dozen time consuming yet lovely and delicious Christmas cookies, I decided to try this very easy recipe.....and it stood up to all the other cookies on my tray. The only change I made was to use chopped almonds instead of the macadamia nuts. The main reason being I had almonds on hand and secondly I think their flavor combines better with cherries and coconut. These are a new Christmas favorite for me.

This was ok but not great. The preserves made it too sweet.  Definitely only let the dough sit out for 10 minutes. Mine sat out a bit longer and the cookies came out flat. Used almonds instead of macadamias and cut way back on the coconut - to about 3/4 cup. The recipe has potential but needs some tweaking.
