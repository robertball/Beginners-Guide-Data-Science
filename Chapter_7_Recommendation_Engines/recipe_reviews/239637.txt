Used the basic recipe but added more spinach, cheese, saut√©ed mushrooms onions and garlic. Baked at 375 for about 40 minutes. Puff pastry crust was a bit under-done on the bottom but it was delicious!

It completely burned!  I put feta cheese, sausage, spinach, onion and fresh farm eggs. If I try this again, then I would put it at 350 or 375 degrees.
