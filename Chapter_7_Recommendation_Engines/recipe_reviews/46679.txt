This turned out well after a little doctoring. First I used regular burrito sized tortillas, like someone mentioned, I didn’t think pasta went well with Tex-Mex. The tortillas soak up a lot of the moisture, which helps solve the problem people are having about it not setting well. Plus the tortillas become very soft and taste very much like pasta. I didn’t use the salsa, because it was already pretty wet, but I added a packet of GOYA Sazón to the mix for flavor. I made my own refried black beans by mashing them and cooking them with garlic, lime and burrito seasoning (the kind from the packet). I also used yellow Spanish rice in the bottom two layers, I didn’t cook the rice all the way so that it could absorb some of the liquid.

Excellent recipe. I made this last night and luckily it's good because I will be eating it for the next week!

I could not find refried black beans at my supermarket, so I bought an extra can of regular black beans and mashed them before preparing that part. 

I also added chopped jalapenos (from a jar) to the bean mixture since I like my food on the spicy side. I added approximately a quarter cup to begin with, but ended up with something more like 1/2 by taste. I ate a leftover piece for lunch and the peppers did not warm up too much overnight. With a 1/2 c. of jalapenos (and medium salsa), I would still categorize the hotness as fairly mild. 


- that is my old review, and I have made this recipe many, many times since then. I've tried it with the refried black beans, and I really think it works better the way I originally made it (two regular cans, one partially mashed). It was a bit too beany with the refried beans. I am known as the vegetarian in my office, and I made it for a bunch of meat lovers there recently. No leftovers at all!

Have made this two years in a row for christmas and is always a hit.  My girlfriend loves it too.

I almost always add a red & green pepper plus a jalapeno peper.

As an update, I bought the "no boil" noodles on accident last time I made this.  I found they took out some of the excess moisture and made it much easier to dish.  I'll probably use the no-boil noodles again for this recipe.

My husband really liked this.  I had a hard time reconciling the taste.  Is it Italian or is it Mexican?  I ate the leftovers today and it was good but it's missing some spice.  When I tasted the sauce I thought it was bland so I threw in some basic spices before I even baked it.  I think next time I'll add taco seasoning to the ricotta mixture.  I added a chedder layer on top and every bite with that is really good.  I think it's just a little too bland on its own.  I was surprised to read that others had trouble with it being soupie.  Mine set perfectly.  I made sure my sauce was pretty thick before I assembled it though.  Lasagna has gotten pretty old to me and this was a nice twist.  Next time it gets more spices though.

I did add extra spices (chili powder, oregano, cumin, cayenne pepper--skipped the cilantro just because I don't like it), like other reviewers suggested, and I used pepper jack cheese to get in a bit of extra kick there, plus threw some hot sauce into the bean mixture. With those changes it came out really excellent, with a good kick. :)

This recipe was great!  I made it for my carnivorous husband.  We had my inlaws over to try it.  They all loved it.  Everyone had seconds, and my inlaws have asked for the recipe.  

I used whole wheat noodles, reduced-sodium/no fat pasta sause, and 1% cottage cheese.  I also couldn't find re-fried black beans, so I used regular re-fried beans.  

I didn't have any problems with excess moisture.  The difference might be that after I assembled the lasanga, the meal time was delayed by 2 hours, so I stuck everything in the fridge.

This was not our favorite.  I may try again, spice it up more and use flour tortillas instead of pasta.  It's just something about Mexican and pasta that just doesn't mix with us.

I feel like the odd ball.  I was not very crazy about this dish.  I thought when I read the recipe and reviews that it sounded very good and flavorful.  I decided to add some chili powder, cumin and red pepper flakes give it a little kick.  I still thought it tasted kind of bland and did not want to eat the leftovers.  The rest of my family agreed.

This is a great recipe that has become one of our staples.  I also add zucchini, yellow squash, and mushrooms to the black bean/corn mixture to give it more servings of veggies and it's delicious. It's great with green onion and black olives on top :)

My husband and his friends love this lasagna. I even made it ahead and had him take it with him to work so his buddies could eat it in the barracks. It's delicious. I did jazz it up a bit with lots of garlic, cumin, red pepper flakes, and chili powder. Yum!

My husband bought me refried black beans by accident, so I just used this recipe to use the black beans...both of us were pleasantly surprised!  Not the flavor we were expecting but we really enjoyed it.

We loved this recipe. I did a few things differently though. I mashed the black beans with the refried beans before adding them to the sauce mixture. I also added a sprinkle of white sugar to the cheese mixture. I also laid sauce down first before putting the noodles in. The noodles soaked up all that yummy sauce. Love this recipe!

While not bad, this felt like it was lacking something.  I'll make it again, but maybe try some cayenne pepper, chili powder, or diced chiles to give it some kick.  Also, the cheese mixture only made about 1 1/2 layers, not 3.

The end result was absolutely delicious.  The only thing I changed was to use corn tortillas instead of lasagna noodles (tasted like noodles anyway, so it really doesn't matter which one you use).  To the tomato/bean mixture I added a batch of "Taco Seasoning I" from this website (quite possibly the best taco spice mix ever).  It gave it a really flavorful Mexican taste that might of been lacking if I didn't add it.

Good.  A little bean heavy for my husband's tastes so I might double corn and pepper for next time, but definitely worth repeating.

I gave it 4 stars b/c I did do some tweaking as others had suggested: I used tortillas instead of lasagna noodles, I added Spanish style rice to the bean mixture, I added cumin & chili powder, and for the cheese layers I divided it up in the first 2 layers and then topped the lasagna with shredded tex-mex blend cheeses. It was a hit!

As suggested by another reviewer, I added a Goya Sazón packet to both the bean and the cheese layers. I also doubled the amount of onion and corn, and added sliced black olives and jalapenos to the bean mixture. I added 2 eggs to the cheese mixture to ensure that it was firm. It ended up being enough for 3 full layers of noodles (of which I used gluten-free no-boils...since they're made of rice it's a good alternative for those who find the "pasta" aspect of this recipe weird) in a 9 x 13 pan. Not runny, very easy, devoured by family and guests. THANK YOU!

Excellent but I really kicked up the bean mixture.  I used spices in the same ratio as I used in the amazing Flatlander Chili recipe on this site, just way less chili powder.

Excellent! I added a package of taco seasoning to the tomato mix, and skipped on the corn since I didn't have any on hand. The season packet added some good flavor and a package of fajita or enchilada seasoning would probably good too. I also used a shredded mexican blend of cheese in place of the monterey jack.  It's really good as leftovers too! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was delicious!  It made a ton- so I had lunch covered for most of the week.  My boyfriend really liked it too- he's a meat and potatoes guy- but this was sooo yummy that until I was telling my mom how I made a vegetarian lasagna later that week, he said- when did you make that?  He didn't even realized he'd been eating all veggies!!!

We loved this dish and I will definitely make it again.  I used tortillas instead of pasta (just what I had on hand, on the suggestion of others) and it turned out nicely.  I used regular refried beans instead of the refried black beans, green pepper in place of the red, and I added some green onions on top.  I also followed another user's tip on using half enchilada sauce and half tomato sauce and I think it gave it a nice kick.  My fiance hates cilantro, unfortunately, so the enchilada sauce gave it some flavor to make up for the missing herb.  I also put in half a packet of taco seasoning into the cheese mixture.  It made quite a bit, and I'm looking forward to the leftovers for dinner all week.  I'm also excited about changing up the recipe, using chicken, tofu, or beef to switch things up a bit.  Thanks for a great recipe!
New Note:  last night I used pinto beans instead of black beans and it was awesome!  We had guests for the weekend and they always want me to make this dish.  I always happily oblige :)

A few changes and it was wonderful...we like beef, and green pepper subbed for red (only because I was out).  And I used tortillas, cooked on the grill.

Used no boil noodles and baked 15 minutes longer.  Topped with a combination of avacado, chopped tomatoes, cilantro and lime.  Served it with a cucumber salad and it was DELICIOUS!  Will become a staple in our house.

I was not a fan of this one.  The flavors didn't seem to work well together for some reason.  I did use regular refried beans, which could have been the problem.  It just didn't make the cut.

This is a great recipe! I had followed other reviewer ideas added a 1/2 cup jalapenos,cumin,used hot salsa, cayenne pepper and about a 1/2 packet of taco seasoning. I like flavor overload so I just kept adding til I was happy. I used shredded mild cheddar and colby jack cheese on top as well.Everyone loved it. Will definitley make it again!

My whole family, several of whom are vegetarians, LOVES this dish.  I find that I need more of the cheese mixture than the recipe calls for, especially if I double it.  It is EXCELLENT.

I love love love this recipe.  I have made it more times than i can count and every time is excellent.  I always leave out the corn and olives cause we don't like that in our family.  I have I'd both fresh cilantro and dried cilantro, depending on what invading the house.  One I left out the salsa and it was still excellent.  The only slightly neg thing is that it doesn't harden until its cool, so we always have essentially lasagne soup on our plates when it's fresh from the over.  It is so good frozen and re heated as well.

This was great!  I prepared it and froze to bake later, and it was awesome.  Everyone but my VERY picky 10 year old gave great reviews.  Will definitely make again, and will add it to my list of delicious meat-free main dishes!

The taste was good and it was fairly simple to put together.  Unfortunately, the lasagna did not set well, though I followed directions precisely and even allowed it to set for about 15 minutes after baking.  It slid all around, was hard to take out of pan, and sort of turned just into a pile of mush on our plates.  So the presentation was not good and I would never serve it that way to guests.  But again, the flavor was very good I thought.

I really liked this recipe, especially because I made it healthy and it still tasted so good.  Boy ate 5 pieces!!!  I used all fat-free cottage cheese (no ricotta), fat free sour cream, and left out the refried beans just because I don't like them, and this was still very tasty and unique- lots of veggies and protein without the fat of regular lasagna.  The only reason I didn't give 5 Stars is because I've had some the best food of my life from this website, and this recipe wasn't quite at that level, but still highly recommended.  Thanks Chris!

I found this tasted better to me if I added more noodles.  I thought the refried bean mixture was a little "heavy" on the taste scale.

Delicious!  Can't wait to have it for leftovers all week.  You better like cilantro if you use all the recipe requires (I happen to love it)!  Might also try some fresh lime juice in the bean mixture for an extra kick.  Also, make sure to let stand (and set) before cutting.

We really enjoyed this. Pasta and Mexican flavors together didn't throw us at all. Something about the ricotta and cilantro mingling was wonderful. I used all whole black beans cooked from dry because that is what I had on hand and I didn't have time to mash. Also used regular lasagna noodles without boiling first. I believe that soaked up most of the excess moisture and they were perfect texture after baking. Use a slotted spoon when transferring sauce to baking dish and that should take care of "sloppiness". We love spice but didn't feel this needed cumin, etc. Just added red pepper flakes and hot sauce at the table. Would give five stars once moisture issue gets resolved.

This recipe made my husband want to be vegetarian!  AWESOME... you don't miss the meat! I did add some cumin as a prior review suggested.  And I used low fat sour cream and low fat cottage cheese... turned out WONDERFUL!

I recently married a vegetarian and have been trying different meatless recipes that my carnivore children would also eat.  Once they got over the idea of "black beans" it has quickly become a favorite.  It is easy to prepare by someone, like me,  who does not really like to cook and has limited time. My family likes to eat it with tortilla chips.

this is really good and a nice compromise for my half veggie/half meat eating family. I used red enchilada sauce instead of half of the tomato sauce and it had a nice kick to it. Will definitely make this again.

This lasagna was fantastic.  My husband, a meat lover, loved this vegetarian meal.  I substituted black eyed peas for refried beans because I had them on hand and used whole wheat lasagna noodles. Excellent-going into permanent rotation.

This is a favorite at our house!  I use no boil lasagna noodles to nix an extra step...works fine.  I can put it together in the afternoon during kids' naps and refrigerate until ready to bake. It does have to sit a little while after baking before cutting into otherwise it's kind of runny.  Super!  And so worth the effort!!

Really tasty! I just docked it a star cause I made a few changes to (in my opinion) improve the recipe. I used wheat tortillas instead of lasagna noodles, left out the cilantro (I don't care for the taste), left out the salsa, and added some chicken (chop it into small pieces if you add this so that the mix still spreads smoothly in each layer), onion powder, chili powder, and cumin. I didn't measure the spices, but it could've used more chili powder and cumin than I put in. I also used canned corn instead of frozen and I plan to add more corn and peppers than the recipe calls for next time. It still came out a little mushy, but not as liquidy as other reviewers were saying. I'm not sure how you'd fix the mushiness unless maybe you fry the tortillas ahead of time. I will make this again and continue to tweak the recipe!

Everyone loved it. My fussy husband said it's worth the time it took to make it. 2 hours for me from start. I used frozen peppers and chop them up.  8 noodles was enough (4 and 4). It was VERY good.

Since I hate cilantro, I left it out and found this to be a little bland.  It's not the recipe's fault if I leave out the main spice and then discover it lacks flavor!  I really liked the cheese filling - adding sour cream to the ricotta and cottage cheese gave it a lovely consistency.  This recipe has a lot of potential, so I made it again with some alterations.  First of all, I doubled both the corn and the black beans .  I used regular refried beans since I couldn't find refried black beans - don't substitute with mashed up beans like some other reviewers - you need the refried for the thickening.  I found that the salsa didn't add much and mostly annoyed me because I had to buy a whole jar  just for half a cup.  And guess what, that half cup is exactly what's leftover from the 29 oz can of tomato sauce.  So skip the salsa and just use the whole can of tomato sauce.  Then add a whole package of taco seasoning mix; it makes all the difference.  I liked the cheese mixture so much that multiplied it by 1.5 and then added 1 tablespoon of dried parsley, 1 tsp of salt and 1/4 tsp of pepper.  Finally, when layering put the cheese layer down first and then put the tomato layer on top of it.  It's just way to hard to spread the cheese mixture on the sauce - it's much easier to spread it on the noodles.  I've used various cheeses, not just Monterey Jack, and they all work.  What a great vegetarian recipe!

Mine came out very watery. I think if u just used regular lasagna noodles without cooking them first, the extra juice would cook the noodles and make for firmer results. I will try it next time I make this. Otherwise, I have had other recipes similar to this one with similar tastes and they held.

This was pretty good. I think it was a bit too much cilantro, and think I will scale back a bit. And I did not use as much tomato sauce as it called for; I did 15 oz vs. 22 oz. and to me, it was still too much sauce. I do plan on making again, but will have to make some adjustments. Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't use the cottage cheese at all and added a tad less cilantro and it was delicious.
