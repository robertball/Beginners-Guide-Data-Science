My family really liked this one.  I couldn't find the Goya Mojo Chipotle so I used another chipotle sauce and added a teaspoon of garlic powder to it, worked out great.

This was a great recipe! Loved the flavor of both the chops and onions! A nice change from the same ol pork chop recipes. I think the longer the chops marinate the better!

Didn't change a thing! When you have a winner, why change it, didn't change a thing!  This just might have become my favorite way to grill those thick chops, delicious! But, can we talk! Those onions killed it and went to heaven and back on my plate! Only problem was, I didn't have enough of them... be sure to double up on the onions you'll thank me later for that advise.

We had boneless pork chops marinated in Mojo Chipotle and another dish marinated in Mojo Criollo.  Both were delicious.  I marinated them all day and the flavors were perfect.  I baked them because the heavens opened as I was getting ready to grill.  25 minutes at 400 F was perfect.  I poured the excess marinades in small saucepans and boiled it and cooked until reduced, then poured it over the cooked chops.  Thanks, Goya for great condiments.

This was a nice change for us.  Our grocery store doesn't carry much of a selection on the Goya sauces, so I had to make my own Mojo sauce from a recipe I found through google.  Next time, I will double the onion.

I love Goya products, and I love Mojo.  I love Chipotle.  But sad to say, I did not care for the new Mojo with Chipotle.  It has lots of spice but the flavor lacked depth.  The recipe would be better, I think, with the traditional Mojo.
