I loved this chicken. Next time will use less lemon juice and use only the breast meat. I used a can of chicken broth inplace of the water and bouillon. It made a wonderful gravy. Will be making this again for company. This went well with grilled asparagus.

I really enjoyed this dish, my husband did not care for it as he is not a very "adventurous" eater!  I added a little extra lemon juice and used an assortment of olives such as kalamata, amfissa, and sicilian.  Very delicious.

This was so easy and tasted great! My husband is telling everybody that is was wonderful.  I would tripple the lemon juice and water to have extra juice. We used chicken breast for this recipe and it was a great choice.  We served it with rice and couscous.  I would think a nice salad would be an added treat.  We enjoyed it so much it is now a keeper!

I prepared this for a friend's birthday dinner.  She and her husband are very "basic flavor" eaters but loved this dish with its special spices and ingredients.  I will surely make this again.

I really liked this recipe. It was easy and my dinner guests liked it enough to ask for the recipe.

This was good. I used a bit more lemon juice than was called for and less cilantro (I don't like strong cilantro flavors). We liked this quite a bit. It was very different. The juice was very good over rice.

Very tasty recipe, but a little more liquid added to the dish would have been helpful as there was very little gravy to serve with it.  This dish is good with basmati rice.
