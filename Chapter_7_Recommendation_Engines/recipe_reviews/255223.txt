1.11.17   First, I must say after looking at the nutritional breakdown, I’m not convinced how “healthy” this is, but I can say that it is delicious.  Certainly is quick to prepare, and if piped into a dish or a small glass, actually has good presentation (nice enough for a company dessert).   I just sprinkled on a few chocolate chips rather than mixing in, and the consistency is incredibly smooth and peanut-y.  Next time, I'm going to add more vanilla Greek yogurt which I think will lighten the mousse texture even more.   I can see mixing in some chopped banana or even some crisp pieces of bacon.  Sarah, thanks for sharing your recipe.   •••••UPDATE 12.25.17•••••  FYI, I made this yesterday substituting Nutella for the peanut butter which was a nice variation on this simple dessert.

I don't like Greek yogurt much, but this was good. I'll definitely try it again sometime. I used natural peanut butter, and at 10 seconds in the microwave, it didn't seem liquid as indicated in the recipe, so I put in for another 10 seconds. That was a mistake, because the peanut butter started to cook--it got thick and grainy. I was still able to incorporate all of it into the yogurt, but it took quite a bit of stirring. Next time, I don't think I need to microwave at all. Also, I think I will try honey to sweeten instead.

What a fun little dessert! I made this and piped it in chocolate cordial cups, so I omitted the chocolate chips. The tang of the yogurt nicely complemented the sweet chocolate. One serving actually filled six cordial cups for a small after dinner dessert.

I used maple syrup instead of stevia.  It was really tasty!  I think I'll try mixing in some bananas next time too!

I had some plain greek yogurt that was expiring, so I searched for recipes with it. I am glad I chose this one to try. Yummy!! I didn't have vanilla left, so I put in a little vanilla protein powder. Perfect little tray when I am craving peanut butter.

I used Adam's peanut butter and plain low-fat yogurt, so it turned out a little thin. but it was really good as a late night, kind of want something sweet, but need protein,  snack. made it with honey and omitted the choc chips,  but only because I didn't have them.

Not great, I thought it wasn't sweet enough. I also didn't like the tartness of the yogurt. It was also way to thick to me called a mouse in my opinion. I may try it again with vanilla yogurt.

didn't go exactly as the recipe. i used what i had on hand, which was simply peanut butter and vanilla flavored greek yogurt. it was AMAZING!!!! saw the review about it not being healthy. i think it depends on your yogurt. check labels when you are at the store. i, too, tried the greek yogurt fad and thought it was great stuff... until i started looking at labels. try the oikos triple 0. i think the next lowest on sugar was the great value (walmart) brand one. yogurt and peanut butter... who'd'a thought??

If I make this again I will put less Greek yogurt in it because I found it a bit  too tangy. Quick and easy.

It was good and easy to make but it there was a little to much yogurt in it. I would totally make it again just with less yogurt.
