7.16.16   Nice dressing for today's luncheon salad of romaine hearts, fresh blueberries, feta cheese and toasted walnuts.  This dressing has a good balance of sweet-tart.  Fairuzah, thanks for sharing your recipe.

used EVOO and feels like the flavor competes with the blueberries, will try another oil like canola or grape-seed oil next time.

I would definitely make this again.  I doubled the recipe and put it in two bottles, one to use and one to give away to friends. I've been looking at several recipes for awhile, but this one is far less sugary.

This recipe is very versatile. It's very easy to make and very tasty.  Only drawback is the skin from the blueberries.  The recipe doesn't say to but I opted to strain out because otherwise, it's too "chunky".  It's very good with strawberries or raspberries instead of blueberries too.  It will keep in the fridge for a couple of weeks so it can be made in advance and in large quantity.

Was so yummy.  Made warm spinach salad with grilled chicken breast and saut√©ed mushrooms with some fresh blueberries on top. Dressing sooo easy to make and delicious!  Will make again.

Fantastic!  I also used EVOO along with strawberry balsamic, white vinegar and honey.  I cut this recipe in half for two persons and still had plenty for another salad or two.

Very tasty. I made 2 changes, used 1/2 cup EVO and added 1 tablespoon of honey.

The evoo I have is a very distinct and strong flavor so used 1/4 evoo and balance grape seed oil. Whipped it up in my nutribullet in seconds and was a beautiful balance of flavors with our spring greens salad!
