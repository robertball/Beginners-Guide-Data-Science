This is a terrific recipe.  It is ALWAYS a crowd pleaser.  Tastes out of this world and it's always requested again and again as a "bring along" at potlucks.

This was the best baked recipe that I have ever tried... I didn't cook them very long in the oven. About 1 hr and they were warm and delicious.  I made them a second time and cooked them too long (@ 2 hrs)and the beans got dry.

My husband gets mad when I try new baked bean recipes since he already has a favorite, but when I made this one I hit a home run out of the park!! I made to recipe except for I omitted the mushrooms. This is a great recipe! Just when I thought I would never find another baked bean recipe I liked better than my standby I did! Thanks for the post!

My boyfriend loves baked beans so I tried these out for him. They were amazing. I added an extra quarter cup of brown sugar and a quarter cup of honey becuase it was out on the counter. My boyfriend couldn't stop raving about them. I will definetly make again.

My wife's family loved this dish. The only change is that I omitted the mushrooms and added some ground beef. I added the onions to the ground beef while browning. I increased all other ingredients to make up for the added gound beef.  I used a slow cooker which turned out absolutely wonderful and will be making this again many times over!

This bean dish was excellent!  I made it for my husband's birthday party and it got rave reviews by everyone and was asked for the recipe.  Will definately use again.

The only recipe for baked beans I ever use!  I make it vegetarian by omitting the bacon.  Bake for about 50 mins and it's perfect.

This is the best!  I usually use fresh mushrooms.  I also only bake it for about an hour and sometimes do it in my slow cooker on low for about 3 hours.  I've been asked for this recipe so many times.  And I like that it's an easy recipe to have all the ingredients already in your home.

I enjoyed the beans and so did my family.  I would definitely recommend the recipe to others and will make it again this summer.  I really liked the onions cooked in the bacon grease.  I browned the onions nicely and they added a lot of flavor to the dish.

I didn't have any bacon so I made it without. I added some diced celery too and added an extra 1/4 cup brown sugar. I didn't use the canned mushrooms because I don't like them. I used baked beans and two cans of black beans. I only baked for one hour. They were perfect and delicious! Thanks for the recipe. I'll definately make again (with bacon) :)

Great taste. Only change I made was to reduce the baking time to one hour. At two, it was too dry for my taste.

Totally awesome!  My 12 year old who eats like a bird had two large helpings and later that night had another bowl for a snack.  I will definately make this one again and again.

These were really wonderful - I even received a compliment from someone who said they were the best beans he ever ate.  Even though I used a different combination of beans (pork & beans, great northern beans, black beans), finely diced red bell pepper, and omitted the bacon, I followed the seasoning proportions with the exception of using a combination of ketchup, honey- chipotle barbeque sauce, and molasses instead of only ketchup.

I made this recipe using dry beans instead of canned, so perhaps I missed out on some flavor because of that, but they could have used a little more kick - maybe some hot sauce?  They were quite good, just a little bland.  Kids all loved them, though.  I used honey instead of brown sugar, and left out the mushrooms simply because I didn't have them.

It was great.  But I'd skip the mushrooms next time.  And I'd put  all the bacon on top of the beans. Awesome!

I've made this dish for four different groups of friends and each time it has received rave reviews. I keep most of the ingredients on hand, so this has become one of my "go to" recipes at potluck dinners.

I tried this and like another reviewer added 1/2lb. of ground beef. I don't normally like baked beans, but my wife loved them and feel confident serving them to my family this weekend.

I make this recipe every year for our annual 4th of July Pig Roast.  Perfect compliment to our potluck.  The beans are a huge hit with all our guests, and I give out the recipe everytime.  I add burger to mine, everything else is just the same.  Perfect!

I thought this was a very good recipe that I will definitely be making again.  I cooked the beans for 1 1/2 hours and that was a little too long as the beans got kind of thick and dry.  Next time I will try 1 hour.

I made this recipe for a Memorial Day cookout and everyone liked it a lot!  I also did not add the mushrooms and substituted pinto beans for the red kidney beans..don't care for kidney beans!  I also baked for only about 1 and 1/2 hours and sauce was just thick enough....I think 2 hours would be too dry.  will make again!!

Although not terribly bad, this recipe was definately NOT a hit with my family.  I was the only one who ate the most (I hate to waste).  Anyone who tried it, had one taste, and the rest stayed on their plate, and went into the garbage.  I love how the recipe sounded, but the end result was just so-so.
