I call this Gingered Orange Mango Chicken because it sounds more exciting that way when I introduce it to a tableful of people. Either way, however, it's the same great taste. Served it in the Bahamas when we had an overabundance of fresh mangoes and didn't know how to eat them all. Excellent, excellent recipe. I highly recommend!

This was a really quick and easy recipe that I made it for the first time for guests.  You can use as much or as little of the delicious mango dressing as you like.  I added 1/3c orange juice to the chicken just before it was cooked thru to cut a little citric acid into the meat.  *Hint:  have the lemon juice ready before you take the chicken out of the skillet.  You do NOT want to burn the bits in the pan.

I loved this recipe, but my husband lived in Brazil for two years and thought the dish was an insult to mangos.  I might try adding the mangos later in the recipe.  Thanks!

I loved the mango sauce! I didn't have any ground ginger but did a quick substitution with instant ginger tea that dissolved into the sauce. Served it over rice with a little cilantro garnish. Can't wait to make it again! Thanks!

This recipe worked great served over white rice, however it is much more tart than I expected (I was expecting a sweeter citrus taste like the sauce on orange chicken).  I am suspecting that is because of the ratio of orange juice to mango.  Next time I make this I will probably double up on the mango or possibly use a mixture of 1/2 canned mango nectar and 1/2 orange juice rather than all orange juice.  Very satisfied overall, especially to have a fairly healthy chicken recipe that gives a different flavor from lemon chicken or BBQ chicken!

the orange juice overwhelmed the flavor of the mangoes and made them taste like peaches, but it was good.

The sauce was way too tangy to go with chicken.  I had to add sugar and pineapple to try to reduce the acidity.  The chicken itself was ok, though.

Very easy to make and husband loved the mango flavor most.  He even wished he could taste that more.  I think because of that I'll add a little extra next time.

DISGUSTING! The chicken was good, but the sauce is so sweet it ruined the meal. We had to choke it down. Don't use this recipe if you are not a fan of overly sweet dinners!

My family liked this recipe, but it was a bit sweet and the orange juice was too overpowering. We did add a tablespoon of soy sauce and that seemed to help. Next time I will cut the orange juice in half.

This was really good. It looks nice on the plate and was easy and quick. The first time I stuck to the recipe. Tried it again with allspice instead of the cinnamon and used 'peameal' (Canadian) bacon because that was what I had on hand. This is a keeper - thank you Michael

My husband and boys (14 and 9) really liked this. One son LOVED it, the other one does not like mango but ate the chicken without the sauce and said he liked it. I used about 2 1/2 mangos instead of 1, partly because I love mango, and partly because I had a batch that were almost overripe. I did not use cinnamon, just ginger, and lightly browned the chicken in butter before adding the OJ (skipped the lemon too, the OJ accomplished the same thing). I'll definitely make it again.

Absolutely delicious, very easy & time efficient to prepare.  I did add a little cornstarch to the sauce to make a less runny, it thickened up nicely but not too thick.  It got 2 thumbs up from this household, will def be making again.
Thank you!

Really delicious and easy.  I didn't have orange juice so I squeezed a fresh orange.  Only had 1/2 cup of juice, but it turned out great anyway.  Next time I will pre-cook the chicken a bit in the microwave.  It took a lot longer than the time specified to cook the chicken through.

My kids even love this! It's a regular in our house. When I don't have fresh mangos, frozen also works really well. We've even enjoyed it with pork instead of chicken - also a hit!

Very flavorful and a great meal to throw together when you don't have a lot of time.  Made this with stringbeans and orange rice and everything went together well.  Next time I make this, I'll add some peppers and onions to the dish.  The sauce was good but very sweet, so if you're not a huge fan of sweetness in your main course, be aware of that.

I loved this recipe, and so did my guests. I only gave it four stars because I really upped the quantity of spice. It didn't smell strong enough when cooking it. I'd go with at least double, if not triple, the ginger and cinnamon.

Really good!  I added a few things to the chicken - minced onions and a little garlic salt.  My orange juice was orange pinapple, and I added fresh pinapple to the sauce.  Very yummy!  And pretty low cal - which is great for my diet plan.

I changed this recipe alot,i found a recipe on here for tilapia with mango salsa dressing and i used the recipe for the salsa on the chicken.I also baked the chicken for about 5 mins in the oven then cooked bacon in the frying pan but don't fully cook it,then wrap the bacon around the chicken(i also sprinkled alil brown sugar on the chicken and bacon) and cook the chicken in the fryin pan till the bacon is well done and the chicken isnt pink.I also marinated the chicken in a ziplock bag with olive oil,salt,pepper,red pepper flakes,and some malibu rum for a few hours before cooking.

This was SO good and easy to make. I served it over a bed of sauteed spinach w/garlic. Perfect!! The next day, I had it over a bed of organic Fresh Herb Salad. I used the sauce as the dressing. Excellent!!! I will pass this one on.

Definately a nice way to spice up chickden. I stewed the mangoes for more like 10 minutes in the spiced orange juice though, to try to get more mango flavor into the sauce.  I think next time I'm going to try mango nectar to replace a bit of the orange juice. I may try this sauce with fish too.

I made this exactly as per recipe except I added a little chopped basil at the end and it was still very bland. It was edible but not great so I won't make this again.

I made this recipe exactly as written, except I used 4 3/4" thick sliced pork tenderloins, because we have been eating a lot of chicken lately.  Cooked it the  same way it  was written to cook the chicken breast. I served it with white rice. We love this dish. Will be added to my favorites for sure!  Thanks for sharing!!

Although we found the thyme a bit overbearing, we both enjoyed the other flavours. Instead of the traditional rice on the side, I served the chicken breasts over mashed sweet potatoes which proved to be a great flavour marriage with the sauce. We used the juice of 2 fresh oranges and about a tablespoon of finely grated ginger root for a little heat. I will make this again, but I will experiment with something other than the thyme.

It was okay, but I probably won't make this exact recipe again. I liked the chicken, but the sauce was just too sweet. With every bite, I felt like there was something missing. I think the sauce needs something to make savory and sweet.

Super quick and easy recipe. As other reviewers suggested, I cut down the orange juice some by only using 3/4 cup. The orange was more prominent in the sauce than the mango, but it was still good. Not too sweet or too tangy, in my opinion. Served over cauliflower rice. Delicious!

This goes really well with white rice. The sauce is a little too sour for my tastes. I think half a lemon might be enough. Easy dish to whip up for a tasty weeknight dinner nonetheless.

Disclaimer - I don't know how to follow a recipe without making changes - even the first time through.  So I used chicken thighs instead of breasts - will try the breast next time and see if it is as good.  Instead of seasoning the chicken with dried thyme, I dumped a few teaspoons of fresh thyme into the sauce just before taking it off the heat.  I used grated frozen ginger - not sure how much.  And I didn't have a fresh lemon, so I used about 1/4 cup of lemon juice.  Oh, and for convenience I used Trader Joe's frozen mango - probably used more than the recipe calls for, but I cut the pieces smaller.  The result was a bit more tart than I anticipated with all the mango, but it was bursting with flavor.  Can't wait to eat the left-overs!

I made this exactly like the recipe stated and didn't care for the sauce. I thought the mango absorbed all of the fresh lemon juice and so I overpowered all mango flavor. The chicken was good though and the sauce would have probably been better minus the lemon because I think the mango, cinnamon and ginger would have been good together. I could maybe see it over rice and minus the lemon juice, but I probably wouldn't make it again.

After reading many of the reviews, I made some changes to this recipe that worked for my family.  I cut up a zucchini and sauteed it with some crushed red pepper flakes in the olive oil.  When they were lightly browned I removed them from the pan and added the chicken, which I had sliced into strips.  I also seasoned the chicken before adding it to the pan.  When the chicken was done, I added it to the zucchini.  I used a large Meyer lemon and two mangoes along with the orange juice, ginger and cinnamon to make the sauce as well as a quarter of a sweet onion, thinly sliced.  When the sauce had thickened slightly I returned the zucchini and chicken to the skillet and used a small amount of cornstarch dissolved in water to further thicken the sauce.  Served over basmati rice, it was really tasty - not too sweet and with a little kick from the peppers.

This was a good, easy recipe. After cooking the chicken, I added some finely chopped red onion and jalapeno pepper to the pan along with the fruit and juice. It gave the recipe a bit of savoriness that I think it needed, and some great heat. I also used freshly grated ginger, instead of ground ginger. I will make this again.

Made this for the family tonight and served it over rice. The sauce got a little lost in the rice, so will probably serve it beside next time. The sauce was a little tart, too, but that may be because of my oranges, I don't know. On the whole it was good, though. I added a little white wine while sauteing the chicken. My daughter noticed the tartness and suggested a brown sugar or honey, which I'll probably add next time. Also, it took a good bit longer than 15 min. prep time for me, and the cook time was longer than 25 min. Still, it's going in my recipe box.

If you like dessert for dinner than its good. It tasted ok to me, nothing fancy. My daughter only ate the mango out of it and my husband only picked out the chicken and wiped off the sauce. It was way too sweet.

Not what I was expecting but I liked it. I think I used too much thyme, and the sauce didn't thicken like it was supposed to so had to add a bit of cornstarch. Make sure that the mango used is completely ripe. Interesting taste - great if your tired of the same old chicken.

This chicken was a great combo of sweet and tangy. I let the chicken simmer in the sauce for a bit and I used mangoes that were in the use today or throw out tomorrow stage. Turned out fabulous, even the kids liked it!

This recipe is a little different but pretty good. I like to make the same amount of sauce with only two servings of chicken and serve the sauce over rice. I like to double the bouillon and quadruple the ginger for more flavor.
