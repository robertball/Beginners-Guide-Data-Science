Just tried it. If you're not a fan of goat cheese you'll need to omit it from the recipe as it will overpower everything else in the dish. I doubled the shrimp since 1/6 pound/person seemed a little light. Might go 2 1/2 pounds next time.

With the exception of the shrimp, the proportions of the ingredients where great. Nice consistency, good presentation and very filling. Ours was served with a side of chilled asparagus.

I enjoyed this recipe.  I prepared exactly as directed and wished it had a bit more flavor, but overall it was a nice, comforting dish. Next time, I would add more cheese and maybe a little red pepper flake for some heat.  I needed to add quite a bit of salt to add flavor.  Perhaps I will try the recommendation of cooking the grits in chicken stock next time to see if that adds more flavor.

Delicious and even better the next day when the flavors melded.
