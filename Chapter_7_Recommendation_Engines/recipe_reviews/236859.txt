I was looking to use up some onions and ran across this recipe.  I thinly sliced the onions with my mandoline and carmelized them because my husband doesn’t care for cooked onions unless their carmelized.  It came out wonderfully.  I only made a third of the recipe and I’m glad I did because this makes quite a bit and it is  very rich.  I served it with toasted garlic bread.
