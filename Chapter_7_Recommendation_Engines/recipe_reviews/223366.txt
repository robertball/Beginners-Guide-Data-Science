I LOVED this!  The filling is awesome.  I added a little peach liquor to it, but that was the only change.  I tried baking them, but they were a little soggy, fried, perfect.  This is going to be my new go to recipe for crepes and will also use the recipe as is.  Thank you!  ps.  depending on size of peach, you could probably add a little more.

These are so good and easy too.  I recommend having all the wontons filled before you start frying because they fry up very quickly.  I dusted with powdered sugar just to dress them up a smidgeon.
