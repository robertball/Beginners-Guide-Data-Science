I love this recipe, one thing I found extremely time saving is that you can microwave this recipe in about 12 minutes with a 1200 watt microwave and it comes out perfect every time.  Time saving and frees up your oven...

I really liked this. I have made this twice now. Once following the recipe exactly and it was very good. Tonight I used pepper jack cheese instead and I loved it so much more. It was the perfect combination of sweet and spicy.

With all the changes I made, my finished dish wasn't that much like the recipe, but it was so good I wanted to share.  At first I baked it just like how it said, substituting a box of mac and cheese for the separate ingredients. But when it was finished I found it rather sweet, bland and unappetizing.  So I added a can of chicken, a couple tablespoons chopped olives, 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar, 3 tablespoons cream cheese, a lot of salt, a good amount of hot sauce, some italian seasoning, onion powder, and cumin.  And parsley :o)  My boyfriend and I both thought it was excellent and I loved how easy and not dirty dishes making it was, next time I'm going to try draining the corn and adding the same amount of milk as well as my other additions, and put a couple porkchops underneath so it will truly be a one dish meal!  Thank you so much for this base recipe!

I Love the fact that you don't have to cook the macaroni before mixing it.  I used elbow macaroni, and made a double recipe.  I used  shredded cheese, because I did not have any Velveeta.  I also found that using the full amount of butter made it very greasy.l  Next time I made it with a few pats of butter and it was perfect.  With those changes it is one of our favorite casseroles.

Very good, my mom and I love this.I'm thinking of taking it to the family reunion next year. Also I found it was easier to just use a plain box of macaroni and cheese than buying the ingredients seperate.

OMG good. I used the 8oz cans of corn & cut pasta in half. I used 1/2 cup of shredded cheese and halved again the butter (could have cut it further).  I used a dash of hot sauce, not enough to make it hot, just enough to balance the sweet.   I did 10 min in microwave covered, stirring halfway and 1 min uncovered.

very easy to prepare and the results are fantastic. My wife and I both loved it and I plan on using it for a side dish at Thanksgiving.  It sure beats my old corn recipe.

I made this casserole for a potluck.  It went over extremely well.  The only thing I did different was to make it in a slowcooker.

Okay...this is mac n cheese with corn but my family found it to be very good!  Also, it's a snap to make. I think this could be more heartier if some cooked cubed chicken was added but you'd have to be careful so that its addition doesn't dry it out. Overall, I would make this again. Thanks Missy.

I made this for a Fourth of July bar-b-Q, it was the hit of the party!
I doubled the recipe and I wish I would have tripled it. I did drain the whole corn, added some milk and reduced the butter. A package of Velveeta shreds, worked perfectly.

So quick and easy and awesome recipe!  Doesn't require alot of ingredients either.  No need to add salt fyi.  I am trying this time with a little less butter just to make it a bit more healthy.

Very good recipe! I can't believe i'm saying this but it calls for too much butter.  I will make this again but I will use 1/2 the butter in hopes of making it much less greasy.

I made this corn casserole today and was amazed at how good it tasted!  I took it as a side dish to a friend who is recovering from surgery.  Made the recipe exactly as written.  It was easy to make and I am sure I will make this often.

I have been making this one for years...the only additions I make are adding 1/4 cup chopped green pepper and a small yellow onion, grated.  The green pepper gives it a really good flavor.  I also use cheddar cheese instead but might try it this way next time.  Very good!

This was alright, but nothing special and I don't think I would make this again. I used half the amount of butter and used shredded cheese, I don't think more butter would of made any difference.

This was easy and pretty good. I did use half the amount of butter and half-n-half for part of the corn liquid. The pasta that I used came out of a box of mac and cheese so I sprinkled in a bit of the cheese packet. Added in chopped green chilies and leftover grilled chicken (chicken during the last 30 minutes) to make it more of a meal. Still feel it needs a bit more flavor. Next time I'll use hot green chilies and add fresh garlic and cracked pepper.

This was ok - not great as I expected from the reviews.  I doubled the recipe and it took forever to cook.  Ended up putting it in a pan on the stove for the pasta to cook, stiring so the cheese would not burn.  Added about 3/4 - 1 cup seasoned breadcrumbs once the pasta was done.  Tasted a little bland.  May make it again, may not.

I have to make a triple batch of this for every holiday or the 14 nieces and nephews riot.  I make mine with cheese whiz or velveeta it is great either way.  I normally use uncooked elbow noodles.  To save time the day of cooking I prepare it the night before. I melt the butter and the cheese together, then mix all ingredients.  I throw it in the frig until I take it out to cook. The noodles just soak up the liquid from the corn- but they dont get soggy- so don't worry about that. Perfect every time- even triple batched!

I made this exactly like the recipe EXCEPT I added another can of cream style corn.  It was absolutely delicious.  My family enjoyed it for Christmas lunch and the casserole was clean, no leftovers at all, which is fairly unusual.  My granddaughter made this in January for a party and everyone loved it.  Thanks for the recipe!

The best corn casserole I've had yet.  My brother is a very picky eater and does not like the typical corn casserole, so I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit, even with my picky brother!

I made this for my family I tweaked it a little by adding cubed & cooked boneless, skinless chicken thighs cooked with onions & frozen broccoli.   I doubled the recipe so after cooking the original recipe (doubled) for an hour I stirred in the chicken combo & sprinkled some shredded cheese on the top & put the oven on warm to allow the cheese to melt.  A full meal for a Sunday's dinner this may be my Sunday casserole!  Thanks so much!

Made as written. I used New York-style extra sharp cheddar cheese. We both thought this was very tasty, but I thought it was a bit too salty. Next time I would use 1/4 less butter.

I have been making this for several years.  It is a Thanksgiving and Christmas staple, and my kids request it often.  I do add a little real salt and pepper, and sometimes add some bread crumbs on top after mixing before making the second thirty minutes.  Used shredded cheese this last time and felt that saved some time.

Made the recipe as stated, don't really care much for processed cheese.  Made again with cut spaghetti ( looks like Macaroni), and real cheese.  Much better

I used sharp cheddar because I can't get myself to buy velveeta. This made the dish come out a bit greasy. BUT, the crowd loved it??  My kids and parents ate it up and asked for more. It is simple enough to make in a hurry to add to a BBQ cookout spread with other simple, low quality foods present.

I made this yesterday, my foster children liked it.  I thought it was kinda bland.  I did like the fact that you just throw everything together then cook.  I added a little half and half to mine (1/2) c.  It was very creamy and did not clump together after it cooled down.

So easy and So quick!! I made this as a side dish on last minute because I had all the ingredients on hand and it was so quick and easy to prepare.  It was delicious and my fiance LOVED it BUT if I made it again I would use much less butter (probably half as much as recipe calls for), and drain some of the liquid off of the corn too.  I was expecting it to be more "firm" and not so soupy, but it still was delicious none the less...just a little too much butter for me!

I'm sorry to say that this turned out much soupier than I imagined.  If I make this again, I will cut back the butter and perhaps nix some of the juice from the corn.  It tasted okay, but pooled on the plate.  The pasta was fully cooked, so I'm not thinking it was a baking time issue...

I have been making this dish for a long time now and it truly is a hit! I make it in the microwave also, it's so easy!  Put it in the microwave in 5-10 min increments and stir each time. If you need to leave it in the microwave just let it sit as long as you need, it will continue to "cook" on its own. Very simple dish!

Super easy and pretty tasty. I used light butter and Light Velveeta. Next time, I will use 1 1/2 cups of cheese, and drain the corn. Also, it only needed to bake about 50-55 minutes.

This recipe is perfect and doesn’t need any changes. Creamy and moist. Used this as an inexpensive lunch for my kiddos for years! Now some of us use a dab of sriracha on our portion but Louisiana hot sauce and green onions is good too.

Fantastic for family gatherings! Make a double batch though if your going to have more than 6 people though. First time I made it exactly to the recipe and it was great. After that I added about 4oz more velveeta (about 3/4 of whole brick), garlic powder and onion powder and it’s on another level! I don’t measure but I would guess about 1 tsp of onion and about 2 tsp of garlic is what I addd.

have made this for past 8 years at Christmastime and thanksgiving. My family loves it!! Only change was that I cut butter in half. I use only Parkay margarine sticks which are pre-measured. Better flavor. Use only Del-Monte Corn(cream style and whole kernel) Again, better flavor. Use only Velvetta Cheese(whole block style which I cube) I buy one large block at Thanksgiving and enough there for Christmas also. Use seashell pasta or elbow macaroni. Both great! I usually triple recipe and it comes out awesome! (large family-holiday) Mix everything in Large microwavable bowl and nuke for about 15 minutes before pouring into casserole dish and baking. Cuts down big time on baking time. Make sure you STIR while baking to make sure all liquid is baked out and it does not overcook on top otherwise you will not like the outcome. Everyone LOVES this dish!!

It came out way too liquidity and needed salt badly.  I believe that this recipe needs more pasta to soak up the liquid.

I used the medium size shells because that is what I had, could have used a little more, but it would be fun with different shapes! Everything else, I did just what it called for. 

Turned out great!

Absolutely love this!!! It was kind of runny/watery when it came out of the oven, and I worried that I should have put more macaroni in it, but after it sets a few minutes it will thicken up.

Easy and everyone loves this recipe. I think you need a more substantial pasta than small shells. I used macaroni. I'll likely use a bit larger pasta next time.  It was good with the macaroni though.

Followed the suggestions of others and used boxed mac & cheese and it was perfect. It isn't anything fancy, but it did get my toddler and preschooler to eat some corn for once!  Next time I think I'll try it in the slow-cooker.

I use elbow macaroni and only use American cheese.  The results are fantastic.  I've been asked for this recipe numerous times.  This side dish goes so well with many meats/foods!!

My husband loves this, as with anything that has corn in it.  I make it as written except for adding in some raw onion.  So simple to make.

This was ok, but it seemed a little bland to me.  My 1 year old enjoyed it though.

This recipe is excellent! My girlfriend had the idea of adding 1 lb. ground beef to the mix. Yummy yummy! We've made it that way ever since! :)

I make this a lot, easy and tasty.  I use American cheese, not velvet a.  I also cook in microwave for 20 min. Stirring every 5 mins.  Yummy

I need this recipe to serve 10-12 people. If I double everything, will it be too soupy?

It was a nice quick side dish, but had an awful lot of butter.  Calories galore!

So, so, so good! I first had this with my (now ex) boyfriend and his family and it was fabulous. And so I searched and found this recipe and decided to give it a try. I used a big Pyrex bowl that was more meant for mixing than baking, so it took a bit longer to cook. But oh my goodness, this was good. Also, if I remember correctly, it's better the day after. So, great! Its very easy to make too.

Outstanding!!  Just remember you are putting cheese, butter, creamy corn all together.  This was a big hit with the 17 year old boys for Thanksgiving.  Just a great and easy dish.  I trippled the recipie for thanksgiving but you don't need to tripple the butter.  Too much.

Tasty, EASY, and a good side dish to accompany a variety of meals.  This could also stand on its own as a lunch offering for children and hungry young males.  If you have a corn-lover in your family, this dish is just the ticket.  I will definitely make this again and again for my family.

I think the key to this is to use American cheese (you can buy it without the plastic on the individual slices).  I don't know why it is so much better than Velveta.  I usually shred it.  I never stir mine in the oven either.  I just let it cook around an hour and it's perfect everytime!  It's the dish I always take to potlucks.  So easy!

I make this all the time, exactly as the recipe states.  My hubby and kids all love it and every time I take it to a family get-together, it's a hit!

My son made it for a foods class.  The class all loved it and it was gone in a flash.

My husband and I love this recipe and have made it several times during the last 6 months.  I recommend cubing the Velveeta in very small pieces so the cheese is certain to melt, stirring frequently while the dish is baking, and letting it sit about 10 minutes before serving.  This recipe also goes great with Brown Sugar Pork Chops.

My seven-year-old liked this, but my husband and I didn't.  It was very easy, so if you know you like corn with macaroni and cheese then go ahead and try it.
