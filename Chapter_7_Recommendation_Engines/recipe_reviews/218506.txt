Tasty and nutritious.  Substituted turkey bacon for pork chops and fresh garlic for garlic salt.  Omitted salt and seasoned salt.  Recommend quartering ingredients for more accurate serving sizes.

Great way to empty the fridge of all the greens before they go bad. We followed the recipe for the most part. Added some diced jalapenos to spice it up a bit and they really made it that much tastier. Next time I am going to make this with chicken instead of pork and see how that turns out. We used Tony's and some Old Bay for the seasoning.

I didn't have turnip greens or mustard greens, so I omitted those.  It turned out amazing, but a little dry.  I ended up adding about 12 ounces of water on top of the reserved spinach liquid to get it to the correct consistency.  

However, it was absolutely delicious, and a fabululous way to use up a whole lot of green veggies at once.  

I would definitely make this again
