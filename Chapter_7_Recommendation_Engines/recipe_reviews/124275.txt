This recipe definately and without a doubt gets 5 stars. I chose this after reading the raving reviews from others. I had all the ingredients on hand which was great and this recipe makes alot from it as I was able to refill an empty salad dressing bottle and an empty small mayo jar and still had a bit left in my blender which I poured (liberally) onto my salad. The amount of sugar used worried me a bit, but I said, "what the heck its only dressing". I find that the sweetness of it takes the edge off of the vinegar. Also, I will never buy this from the store again as long as I have the ingredients on hand. Thanks

So good. I added 2 cloves of garlic, a wedge of red onion, thats what I had on hand. I also used less sugar as per other reviews and scaled it down to six servings. My husband and I loved it.

Great dressing. Very sweet though. I  suggest adding no sugar and then sweetening to taste at the end.

My husband is soooo picky, and he loves this dressing.  I omit the onion.  I have made it at least 6 or 7 times already.  (June 2009)

Made the recipe as listed, however only used 1/2 cup sugar because that is all I had on hand. I also added some onion as per other reviewers' recommendations. Everyone loved it and after only three days it is almost all used up. This is a keeper and a supply will be kept in my fridge from here on. Many thanks for sharing this great recipe.

An excellent sweet red french dressing.  I've made (and enjoyed) other french dressings from allrecipes.com but this one is my favorite.

This tastes great!  I agree that apple cider vinegar really makes the flavor pop.  I added a little red pepper paste and didn't have pimento.

after making "jamie's cranberry spinch salad" and loving the dressing, I've decided to never buy bottle again.  this French Dressing was fantastic.  cut back on the sugar per other reviews.  everybody raved over it.  we were at friends last night and they had salad.  my husband asked if I brough the 'real French Dressing'....I almost died of embarrassment! (but I guess this reciped really impressed him!!)

SOOO much better than bought. Be sure to let it sit in the refridgerator for about 1/2 hour to allow flavors to blend. I followed exactly -- perfect. Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was an excellent dressing. It was easy to throw together and the entire family enjoyed it. I did cut in half as I just wanted enough for our dinner salads.

i was so excited to try this recipe because of all the positive reviews. unfortunately neither my family or i enjoyed it as a dressing. however, i used the rest of the recipe to season chicken shish kebabs, turned out gr8 after grilling! ill definitely use it again to keep kebabs glazed with this wonderful and easy recipe. next time ill just leave out the sugar, and add ground black pepper. delicious, a must try!

it reminds me a bit of those glazed/grilled salmons that i love, maybe ill try it with that next time...

This was great!!!!  I used good quality olive oil, white balsamic, & smoked paprika.  I cut back on the sugar as well.  I also added crumbled bacon and a few splashes of tabasco sauce for a little kick.  Yummmmmm The best.  Thanks for sharing!!!

Very good dressing. I scaled this back to 4 servings. I also cut back a bit on the sugar because I used heinz ketchup which is also sweet. I also had some red onions that I chopped and added in the processor. I blended this until it was a nice and smooth consistency. Thou I did cut the sugar down some, I could taste a nice sweetness but not overly sweet -nice! This dressing is normally served over salad but today, I used this in, "Taco Salad I," also from this website.

A little sweet for my taste, but still very good. Will try with honey instead of sugar next time.

This is an old family recipe I had when I was a kid and still love it.  I make 3 small changes.  
I use Brown Sugar instead of white (and I do add it slowly to taste so it's not too sweet). 
2 Garlic clove crushed instead of onion. 
I also add Celery seed, about a teaspoon for the full recipe.
It is a favorite in our kitchen.  Try it!

This is a delicious dressing.  I highly recommend it.  I made it exactly as written except I used canola oil (I didn’t have vegetable oil).  I used high quality balsamic vinegar only because I love it.  Why buy bottled dressing when you can easily make an excellent dressing like this?

I thought it was good and different but nothing great. I also put less sugar since I though it was too sweet and used 1 tablespoon of lemon juice instead of 1 teaspoon. It makes a lot of sauce I would recommend to do half for 4 people and still have some left

Forgot to say that I omitted the salt, as I'm on a low-sodium diet. I haven't missed it at all.

I gave this a 5-star rating because my husband likes it so much.  I do not care for French dressing.  Made this and used splenda instead of the sugar since my husband is a diabetic and I try to cut sugar and sodium in most recipes I fix for him.  He loves this dressing better than any kind we have ever bought.

When I originally tasted it in the blender it tasted too much like ketchup. I added more onion and a cup of yogurt. It still tasted to much like ketchup. I put it on my salad and it tasted pretty okay. Hubby liked it too.

I made two changes I used Splenda. I'll cut back  on the Splenda next time. (just a bit too sweet for me) I also added 1/8 tsp. Cayenne pepper for a little kick. Yummmmm ;)   Thanks.

this is a great french dresing.  My DH lovers french blue chees dressing so I added blue cheese to this dressing  and he loved it.  Thanks for a great dressing.  If you want french blue cheese dressing just add blue cheese to taste.  He likes lots of blue cheese so I add about 5 ozs.

Excellent French dressing - my husband says it's his favorite out of the homemade dressings I've made.  I cut back on the sugar a bit which worked well.  I had initially left out the onion out of laziness, but the dressing was way too sweet and was missing something - then I added onion and it was perfect.  Don't skip it!

Excellent dressing.  Love it.  I reduced sugar, vinigar and ketchup a little bit but it's just personal preferences.  All in all it's a simple and yet so delicious dressing.  Now I can eat salad more often.  Thank you.

Very good dressing, tastes exactly like what you would buy in the store (without all the preservatives). It's quite sweet, so I would start with half the sugar and then add to suit your own taste buds.

If I can get my husband to say a dressing is good and it isn't his favorite store bought ranch than that means the dressing is awesome! :)  I did use less oil and more ketchup though.

Great!  I scaled down to 6 servings and used as a dressing for a wonderful grape tomato and basil salad.  The only changes/substitions I made were:   olive oil, hot paprika, and red wine vinegar.  Will use again!

Yummy!  Halved the recipe and used a shallot, white vinegar and olive oil.  Added a little extra vinegar and lemon juice because at first I found it a bit too sweet.  My husband and I really liked it and I will be making this regularly.

Since I am single and wanting to cut back on sugar I halved the recipe and added a heaping tablespoon of non processed honey(in place of the sugar)to the cider vinegar. This is an excellent recipe.

My son hates all salad dressings, except THIS one!  This dressing is very good, but very sweet - so start out on the conservative side with the sugar...you can always add more if needed.  Also, this recipe makes quite a bit of dressing, so we cut it in half.  It also keeps well in the fridge. Enjoy!

Perfect.  I will never buy this bottled again!  My only change was to use chili powder because I was out of paprika.  And the only vinegar I had on hand was Balsamic...
This is a real dinner saving dressing!!!!

delicious! Made enough for just me and my bf and we both enjoyed it just as written. The only thing I'll add next time is some garlic (I can't get enough of the stuff).  I think I'll even make more next time, so that I can bottle it.  Thanks for the recipe!

I needed a French Salad Dressing urgently and didn't have any in my cupboard. I found this one and luckily had all the ingredients on hand. Wow. I will never buy store dressing again. However. I also found it a bit too sweet so will use less sugar next time.

Good basic sweet "French" salad dressing...I made this today because I needed French dressing as an ingredient in another recipe, and I had none.  I tend to prefer savory dressings, but I have no doubt my son and husband will love this!

I really enoy this dressing...It reminds me of my favorite Spanish resturants dressing.  I tasted the dressing eactly as written then "tweaked it".  I added about 1/2 cup more vinegar and a a few cloves of garlic..It was a little sweet for my taste before i added the vinegar but afterward...Delicious.

This is the best French dressing ever! French dressing in Australia is greenish and I hate it. This is so good. I will never have to worry about not getting french dressing anymore. Yay!

I have been making a similar recipe to this.  I reduce the oil to just 3/4 cup.  I do not add onion.  I just whisk the mixture.  I add freshly cooked bacon and spoon it in.  Yes, some drippings go in the mixture.  We never have left over dressing.

I made this at my parents house and my very picky dad liked it.  It's a little sweeter than some french dressings but really good. I'm going to make this again.

Thanks Jane for this recipe.  I live in Spain now and there is NO French dressing in the stores (gasp!).  This recipe is authentic and tastes better than any store-bought anyway.  The only thing I changed; I halved the sugar as many people were saying it was too sweet.  I'm not big on sweet either so figured it was the safe bet.  It was amazing and such a pleasure to eat French dressing again.  I still gave it 5 stars because and it deserves a few more!

I love this recipe!  I thought it was slightly too onion-y as is.  I used a small vidalia onion and it could be that "small" means different things to different people.  In the future when I make this again (which I intend to do instead of buying) I will start with a quarter of an onion and add from there.

Brings me back to my childhood, when iceberg lettuce and French dressing was a standard. I haven't purchased iceberg in years but will soon to match it up with this yummy dressing.

I didn't have french dressing on hand for another recipe I was making (Baked Apricot Chicken) so I whipped this up and it was amazing.  I halfed it and still had some leftover to use for salad.  It was very easy and I had everything on hand.  I will definately make this again.

I was trying to make the "Special Hamburger Sauce" recipe on this site, but didn't have any French Dressing. I whipped up this recipe and applied it to the other recipe...it was the key ingredient in making my other recipe a great success!!!

Amazing! I never knew that I could love salad so much! I usually drown the lettuce in dressing but with this recipe I use 1/2 as much and enjoy it twice as much. I did not use a processor or blender, the extra crunch is refreshing, so not only is it tasty but also super easy! Thanks for sharing!

My family really enjoyed this recipe and I made it exactly as written.  I personally thought the onion was a little too strong...next time I will reduce the amount by 1/2 and add more if I think it needs it.

This is delicious!  Growing up in Minnesota, I remember eating only French dressing as a kid.  I've never had this kind homemade before, but it was much better than the store-bought version!  We halved the recipe (even halved, it makes a lot) but otherwise followed it exactly.  We especially like that everything in the ingredients list is fine for our dairy-, egg-, and wheat-allergy family.

Quick,easy and delicious. Homemade dressings are so much better than commercial brands. I only make small amounts as they don't store very long. This french dressing is a favorite of ours.

Very good.  Did not want 4 cups of dressing so I cut all the ingredients in half except the onion and paprika. I prefer french dressing a little tart so I also only used 1/4 cup of sugar.

excellent!!!  I used this as the dressing on a taco salad.  My husband was never a big salad eater, but now he wants to eat more salad because of this dressing.

Love this dressing! I would cut in in half next time because it makes a lot. Made it without any changes and it was great. Taste just like catalina dressing.

I am an American living in England and I miss all of my salad dressings.  French has always been my favorite so I decided to make this.  I am SO glad that I did.  I do not have a blender so instead of a small onion I used 1 tablespoon of onion granules and it tasted perfect!  Much better than the US store bought.

Good dressing, can't wait for my mom to try it.  She loves catalina.  May add less onion next time, but regardless was very good.

I don't usually make salad dressing but I had all the ingredients on hand so I thought... why not. I am so glad I did. I adjusted the amount to 6 servings since it's just the three of us and wow! It tastes great. Now I have another reason to use my Magic Bullet. Thank you Jane!

This is a good recipe. I used less sweetner, it was a little to sweet for my taste. I also substituted Splenda in place of the sugar. Also added 1 clove of garlic.

I am 8 weeks pregnant and battling some wicked "morning sickness" all day long. So, I have been craving comfort food from my childhood. This was delicious and easy to make with ingredients that I normally have on hand. I had two servings of salad. Thanks for sharing!

I switched the oil with greek yogurt and used Stevia (I'd cut down a little on this the next time I make it)  in place of the sugar to try and make it more WW friendly and this recipe still turned out wonderful

This is going to be my "go-to" recipe whenever I find myself short of dressing.  Usually have these ingredients on hand and the dressing is deliciously addictive!

This recipe is excellent! I've been making this for everyone and everybody has asked for the recipes. I made it without onion and paprika and it's still really good.

In my area I cannot find all natural and or organic french dressing; which is our favorite flavor of dressing.  The ingredients in this paticular recipe allowed me to have a wonderful french dressing FREE of any unnatural ingredients, especially FREE of high fructose corn syrup. Simply done by usng sugar in the raw, organic ketchup and organic worcestershire sauce.  

Tangy, but a bit sweet.  For those of you who want a less sweeter dressing, use less (raw)sugar to taste.
