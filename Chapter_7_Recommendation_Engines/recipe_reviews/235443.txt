Made it exactly as recipe stated except I put actual celery in with the onion and carrots and left out the celery seed.  Delicious.  Great heated up the next day too.

Mmm mmm. Awesome recipe! I used yukon gold potatoes and only had a red onion. I also used fresh parsley not dried and followed the notes of the submitter and subbed 2 cups shredded colby jack for the american slices. I think the green onion garnish is necessary for some added texture. Thanks for sharing Radical Reebs!

I made this soup as part of a supper I cooked for 30 senior citizens in my culinary care at their retirement home where I work. The kitchen didn't have any celery seed so I just went with one big stalk of celery, that went into the food processor along with the onion and carrots. Other than tripling the recipe ingredients to feed that many people, and the substitution for celery seed, I followed the recipe verbatim. It was a hit with most of the residents and 3 of them even requested second helpings. This one is gonna be a repeat request by them.

Creamy soup and very easy, used red potatoes and did not bother to peel them.  Also used celery (lightly saut√©ed it with onion in a little butter) before adding broth and potatoes.

I used one finely chopped celery stalk instead of the celery seed and sauteed it and the onion in a little bit of the bacon grease. The rest of the bacon grease I used instead of the butter to make a roux with the flour and milk. I initially used the American cheese, but found it a little bland so I ended up adding some sharp cheddar.  Homemade garlic croutons sprinkled on top took it over the top!!!! All other ingredients were followed exactly. I made this in my slow cooker and it took a lot longer than I expected it to. I did end up having to turn it on high after 6 hours as the potatoes were still crunchy.  I highly recommend this recipe. My family loved it!!

I love this soup! I've made it numerous times as written - but tonight I didn't feel like dealing with bacon. I had some leftover Kielbasa so I sliced and quartered it and fried it in the soup pot before adding the veggies and broth. Get some char on the sausage for a deeper flavor. So yummy!!

Very good. Made exactly as it says and we really enjoyed it. The carrots add a different flavor to it and give a different spin on traditional tasting potato soup.

This was very good, and will be putting in my regular soup rotation for the winter months. Did as many others and used stalk of finely chopped celery instead of the seed, but otherwise used ingredients listed. Stealing from other reviews, I also used the bacon grease to make the roux for the thickening sauce, which i think brings in more flavor. 
Really not much else needs to be done, but probably will try some other cheese, like a shredded smoked gouda perhaps...
Thanks for posting this recipe. definitely one of the best I've tried from here.

I doubled the recipe and left the skins on white potatoes. I didn't have celery seed and added garlic.  It was delicious! Gave some away and everyone enjoyed it.  Definitely a go-to now!

Very good. I made a roux from the flour, milk, bacon fat and spices, and added it after everything else was cooked. I also added some celery, sour cream, garlic and salt.

This is a really good soup!  The family very much enjoyed it.  I added the recipe to my favorites list.  It's simple, easy to make, and not overly time-consuming to put together.  I had to cut the recipe in 1/2 as I didn't have enough of a couple of the ingredients to make the full amount.  Cutting the recipe in half turned out be just the right amount for three adults.  We each had a nice-sized bowl of it, plus some, with a sandwich, and had plenty leftover for another delicious meal.  Like a lot of things, I'm looking forward to enjoying another bowl after all of the ingredients have had some time to "sleep in the same bed" for a night or two.  I mostly followed the recipe, with the only differences being that I added a little water to make up for how much short I was (maybe a 1/4 of a cup) with the amount of chicken stock the recipe called for, and I used 4 cups of potatoes instead of 3 cups because I over-peeled the amount of potatoes I needed and I didn't want to throw any away.  I figured the more potatoes, the merrier.  One last thing, I believe the recipe says to add salt and pepper for taste.  To suit my taste, that amounted to adding up to at least a 1/4 teaspoon, or more, of salt and pepper, but that might be a bit too much pepper for some.

I made this for dinner tonight and it turned out great!!  I used 5 slices of thick cut bacon. Used corn in place of celery, which hubby liked better and it was fine without the green onions. I also used fat free half and half which gave it a richer taste. You could prep everything the night before and dinner would be easy the next day. Just add some crusty bread!

Delish! I used this as a Base! I thought the measurments were Perfect! I did tweak to my own personal taste! I used polish smoked sausage instead of bacon due to the fact thats what I had on hand and used canned diced potatoes only because i was gifted an enormous amount and wanted to use them up!also i added fresh garlic and fresh parsley..Im thinking im going to make some bread bowls to serve this in!! Make this soup its Wonderful!!!

Thank you for this recipe.  I went to a restaurant and had a similar soup, inspiring me to look for a good recipe.  I added broccoli for colour, and ended up creating a soup that easily beats the rival.  Ham works well for this too! Didn't need to add salt, it was flavorful enough!

I have no idea why, but this soup reminded me so much of the dry soup mixes in the packets in taste. It is really easy to make and it is thick and creamy. Upon the suggestions by the submitter, I did cut the potatoes into very large chunks. I am glad I did because there would have been no potato pieces left.
