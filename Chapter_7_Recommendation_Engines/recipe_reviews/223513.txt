My corn fritter recipe is packed away.  We left out the clams, and onions.  We increased the sugar to 1/4 c.  We fried the fritters and rolled them in cinnamon and sugar.  They are more like a sweet hush puppy, than the corn fritters I made growing up.  I like the light and airy fritters, so I gave this a 4-star.  My husband and son loved them, and couldn't stop eating them.  I've never had a clam fritter.  I think I'd be more inclined to jalapeno and cheddar, maybe crab...

Today: 7-16-14 is National Fritter Day, according to the folks on the Buzz. I liked this Way better then 4 stars but I cheated and used that  'little blue box'  of cornbread mix. There was a corn on the cob in the fridge that tasted like candy corn, that got added. The clams were a bargain bin find, to which I used the juice and made a cocktail sauce with. Very good!  These fritters basically had everything one would want, sweet, salty & crispy fried yumminess.  Thank you Lisa01, next time I find those discount clams, I'll know exactly what to do with them!

The recipe needed more clams. Save the clam juice in case the batter is too dry (instead of milk).
