I have made the 3-day version of cassoulet from Paula Wolfert''s "The Cooking of Southwest France" that costs over $100 to make it according to the recipe, and the culinary scavenger hunt took over a month to gather the ingredients. I have made Julia Child's version from "Mastering the Art of French Cooking."  Both were very time consuming but delicious.  I've had exquisite cassoulet in France.  This recipe rivals them all at a much lower expenditure of both time and money.  And it is much more heart healthy. Can be done in the evening after work. It is even better the second day.  I used homemade chicken stock and chicken breasts since we were snowed in and had no chicken thighs, which would be a lot better.   Bravo, Chef John!

Very quick and foolproof recipe. I used chicken breast (because I didn't have any thighs, not for health reasons) and dried rosemary and thyme and it still tasted good. Will definitely make this again.

Excellent! I didn't have a skillet that could go in the broiler so I transferred it to a casserole dish.

I was looking for recipes to season my new cast iron skillet and I am so glad I came across this one. I wouldn't change a thing. I have another cassoulet recipe that calls for breakfast sausage so I may attempt to use that instead of the smoke sausage the next time I cook this. It smells so good while your cooking it you can't wait for it to be done.  It is a little time consuming but it was cold and rainy today so it was a prefect way to stay busy indoors. It was delicious and I will most certainly be making this again.

WOW.  I'm eating it for breakie right now.  Fantastic.  
Very flexible!  I'm a vegetarian so changed all those ingredients and spices to approximate John's meatier options, plus I tossed in a cup of leftover rice, carrots, cabbage, edamame and celery from last night.  The topping is DIVINE.

Only note I'd add is to check the pan in the broiler at 3 minutes.  Mine was ready. Excellent breakfast!

Wow. I love Chef John's recipes. I highly recommend watching his cooking videos as well. This is perfect comfort food and very easy to make. I don't have an oven safe skillet so made this in a dutch oven. I used chicken breast (thought I had thighs in the freezer, but no) which was fine but I think thighs would be best. I also used breakfast sausage instead of smoked because I prefer the flavor. I also used dried rosemary and thyme (1/2 tsp. each which was plenty). I was worried that I had added to much chicken broth, but if you follow all the steps, by the end it thickens up so nicely (you'll see if you watch the video). I served this with a green salad with apples and dried cranberries. Thanks, Chef John! Another winner!

I'm a believer, Chef John!  A few years ago I had dinner in Paris with 2 friends.  We had a wonderful cassoulet.  I have looked on line for a recipe ever since.  Most were too complicated.  I took this to a friend's for the finishing broiler touches. Like one of the other reviewers, I transfered it to a casserole dish, but otherwise, I didn't change a thing. Perfect for a cold, snowy night in Minnesota!

Amazing!!!! My family loved this. One of this loves to eat the classic cassoulet with duck fat, but saw we were making this simplified version ...she was very impressed...people went for seconds. Absolutely amazing and hearty. I doubled the recipe and we were 10 people and it was a perfect amount. The only changes I made was sauteing garlic with the onions because garlic and onions are just a couple that shouldn't be separated. :) I used half hot turkey sausage and half chourico as my sausage component and I used a casserole dish since I don't have a iron skillet. An amazing comfort dish, will definitely be making for guests and the family again!! Thanks!!

This is great. It is delicious.  If you prep the beans from scratch, this meal can come together for under $6.

I tried it as written, with the only substitution that I put fresh basil instead of fresh thyme both because that's a flavour I prefer and because it's what I had on hand. I paired it with honey-glazed carrots and it worked really well.

To me, this recipe's only saving grace was the sausage and the bacon. Everything else was just mushy blah. Made exactly as written. Not sure what went wrong. I love French food and Chef John's recipes in general. I may have to make this again just to see if I feel the same way.

Awesome! Chef John does it again. The only changes I made: I added a little bell pepper and garlic. One day I will actually make a true cassoulet, but this one is pretty darn good.

This was fantastic!  For once I changed almost nothing. I put in 1 1/2 teaspoons of minced garlic with the onions, but that was it. Cooked the bacon in a microwave pan because I didn't want to babysit it over the stove and then put the drippings in my cast iron skillet and did everything else in that. The broiling and resting instructions worked perfectly (I have high and low broil settings in my oven, and I used low.) I ended up using 2 1/3 c. of chicken stock and 1/2 t. of cayenne. My husband said it was "outstanding," and he's a tough critic. Posted a photo on Facebook, and now everyone's demanding I make it for them!  I'm a big Chef John fan, and this recipe is another home run!

Was very happy with the shortcut results! Lots of flavor and very easy. My mistake was to use seasoned breadcrumbs which made this waaaaay salty on top of the sausage.  I used a combination of kielbasa and chourico.  May try with a mild Italian sausage next time. Also, wasn't sure how thick this was supposed to end up but I used more stock and it could have used even a bit more.

Made it tonight since it is 0 degrees outside today and it was awesome! Quick to make with just a handful of ingredients. Lots of flavor just the way it is. I can't wait to make it for friends. Even my 2 1/2 yr old loved it!

A few changes for the next time.  Cut down on the bread crumbs by half. And more bacon, but don't add until the very end before putting it I to the oven. And a little less sausage

I have made the traditional, but this one is amazing and so much easier, flavors not as subtle but one cannot be too disappointed with rosemary, thyme, smoke, garlic, and pepper! Hubby requested that I use duck this time, a little less simple but what the heck

Made this for my very picky husband. He actually stopped eating and said how rich and delicious this dish was. Wanted the leftovers for lunch. And this man never has leftovers. Only change on recipe was chicken thighs with bones. So I simmered the dish for 30 minutes prior to broiling. Thanks for a dish I will be making for dinner guests. It’s just that good.

I made this for my father who is in a nursing home and is on a minced moist diet. I have been searching for recipes that I can make easy to swallow after his stroke. This recipe not only turned out great, but as it was the first time I made cassoulet, it gave me a great idea on how to make more kinds of pie for my dad. As he needs a texture-modified diet, I put all the cooked meat that was finely chopped into a blender with the chicken stock for a few seconds to make it minced moist. But there was no reduction in flavour and it didn't look bad. My middle child had some for lunch. She said it smelled and tasted good. This recipe has opened my eyes to so many different ways I can make a pie for Dad. I especially liked mashing the beans (I mashed all of them). Thank you, Chef John for giving me more ideas for something so amazing!

I thought this was really, really good. My kids and husband that it was just "ok". But they cleaned their plates. I did think it was a little on the salty side though, but I did use Italian bread crumbs and that may be why.

Tried to follow the recipe exactly.  After watching the video, I realized I used the wrong type of sausage, but it was still very good.  I am not familiar with what cassoulet is supposed to be, but I thoroughly enjoyed this enhanced pork and beans recipe.

This was insanely delicious!  We didn’t have the proper beans, just a 15-bean blend. Other than that we pretty much followed the recipe to a tee. It was spectacularly flavorful and a dish we still talk about. One of Chef Johns best!

As far as mushy blah...that's kinda what cassoulet is, scooped up with some crusty bread is how we like it! I prefer to cook my own beans ahead of time and it makes a big difference in texture. I've made a long version (including confit my own duck legs) and this is a great recipe. We fell in love with cassoulet in south France and I will make this again and again.

What to do with a leftover smoked duck you got from a guest ?...I searched and felt this  would work and it was awesome. Had fresh everything to make it and used chopped duck breast and bacon as the meats. Added  1tbs chopped garlic and 2 stalks celery and mashed more of the beans than asked. Unsalted butter was correct. Gourmet caliber and iron fry pan was the vessel. Pure soul food.
Will def make again.

Delicious and simple.  I always have home-made beans in the freezer, as well as broth, so this came together super easily.  I had chicken breast, and leftover ham in the freezer, and just because it was there, I threw in the half stick of chorizo that we had leftover.  I can imagine the versatility of this recipe for whatever leftover meat combos you may have.  Thank you for the recipe!

As I was cleaning up I said "yum" so it is good. I used 2 large chicken breasts (that's what I had in the freezer) and Italian spicy sausage and dried thyme. Other then that I followed the recipe spot on. The flavors meld well together, the beans are firm but soft and hold their shape. Two cups of chicken broth covered everything perfectly. The reason for 4 stars is that while good it was not great and will most likely not make again unless we have all the ingredients on hand.

This was very good! It is a little bit salty so do NOT add any extra salt! I used slightly less rosemary since we are not super big on that spice, but otherwise did exactly as written! Thanks Chef John, very yummy!
