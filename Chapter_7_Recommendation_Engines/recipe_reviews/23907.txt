I've made muffins with oats before--what I did was mix the buttermilk with the oats together and let it sit for 10 minutes before adding in the rest of the wet ingredients. THEN, I folded in the dry ingredients and the peaches. I baked my muffins in a 350* oven for 20 minutes--I got 12 biggish muffins out of one recipe. These muffins were so. freaking. good. Even my husband called me from work and told me how much he liked them. Between him and the kids, they ate 9 muffins this morning. This recipe's a keeper.

Overall, these are probably 4 stars, but I would rate them 5 if you're looking for a healthy alternative (not too) sweet treat for toddlers.  I halved the recipe and made 30 mini muffins instead of regular muffins and made the recipe as stated except added the cinnamon to the batter instead of doing a cinnamon/sugar topping.  (Omitted the white sugar altogether.)  I used baby applesauce for a smooth texture.  Mini muffins at 400 in a nonstick mini muffin pan were cooked in about 8 1/2 minutes.  Next time, I would add about 1/4 tsp. salt.  I did not find these muffins to be overly dense--mine were spongey and pretty light.  I diced the peaches very fine (again, for my 1-year old) and I will freeze most of them for her to snack on later.

Very good. I used skim milk instead of buttermilk and substituted a combo of honey/syrup for the molasses and was very pleased with the result.  Thanks for the others who suggested adding in the salt... that was very necessary (I used about 1/2 t.)

I made these muffins exactly according to the recipe.  They have a slightly crunchy crust but are tender inside.  The diced fresh peaches held their shape and color very well.  However, I do agree with the other reviewers who suggested adding salt.  Next time I will add at least a teaspoon.  Also, I don't think the cinnamon sugar on top is worth the mess and effort.  It just falls off.  I may try adding a bit of cinnamon to the batter when I make these again, which I will.  Overall, this is a great basic recipe and yummy slathered with butter!

This recipe is awesome! I made these because they use peaches and my family will eat anything that uses them. I also found that this recipe can also use canned peaches.

Just wonderful!!!  I wish I could give these more stars for healthiness and goodness.  I wanted a recipe that didn't take regular milk, as I was out and had some 'yogurt milk' which is a drink found in Middle eastern stores similar to buttermilk.  When I took it out of the fridge, I realized my husband had bought the 'mint' flavored so I was in a quandry.  I spotted two containers of blueberry non-fat yogurt.  I used 1 cup of the blueberry yogurt.  I did add 3/4 tsp. salt to the batter.  Only had regular rolled oats and it worked fine. Surprisingly this time of year, I had to very ripe nice flavor peaches. The taste was incredible. I could taste the peach throughout.  Diced them fine.  (2 good size peaches=1cup) 2 mini muffin pans at 10 min. baking time, and 3 giant-sized muffins. Added tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. ginger, and 1/4 tsp. cardamom to the topping and it was wonderful.  I did find like other reviewers, however, that the topping doesn't stick well.  Maybe try adding it a bit before recommended time next time.  These had a wonderful taste and not sickening sweet.  Light and fluffy.

Well, I have to say these were pretty bland and I even added cinnamon, salt and nutmeg to the batter.  

These muffins are not very sweet and are low in fat, so I guess if you're looking for a healthy muffin then these would be good.

I used lowfat buttermilk and lowfat applesauce in this recipe.  Also added a streusel topping that had pecans in it and it added good texture and sweetness!  Will definitely make this again.

I used paper muffin cups, which was a disaster (stuck like crazy!) and I also used Blackstrap molasses which is now all I can taste, unfortunately. I added 3-4Tbsp ground flax and didn't bother with the topping (added 1Tbsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp salt to the batter instead). I think had I had proper (fancy) molasses this would have turned out a lot better. Still, a healthy and nutritious muffin that I will serve my toddler (minus the burnt bottoms - molasses problem maybe?)

These muffins have a wonderful spongy texture, but are lacking in flavor. I must say they tasted better the next day. I replaced buttermilk with 1/3c plain nonfat greek yougurt and 2/3c unsweetened almond milk, omitted brown sugar (so my muffins were barely sweet), added cinnamon into the dough and didn't do the topping at all. I will bake these again with some extra spices.

I thought these were delicious. This is a great combination of flavors. I put the topping on before baking, then sprinkled some oats on top for effect. The only problem I had was that the muffins stuck to the paper liners. I will use the foil type next time to eliminate the problem. I filled my muffin tins full and got 16 muffins.

Rating above as written but prefer to use 1/4 oil rather than applesauce because it gives to moister texture.  Also, soak the oatmeal for at least 20 mins.     The flavor is great but these changes are to suit our tastes.   Thanks for  another muffin to add to my files.

These were not very good.  None of my children (who usually adore fruit muffins) would eat more than one or two bites, and as soon as I tried one, I could see why.  As other reviewers stated, the molasses flavor vastly overpowers the peach taste.  The texture was not great, and was even worse in the 6 muffins that I added chopped pecans to.  I won't be making these again.

This recipe was interesting.  I made them with apples instead of peaches because that was what I had, but I found that they ended up a bit too dense and chewy for my liking.  Also, they were very stuck to the muffin cup liners.  Tasted pretty good, but I'm not sure I'd make them again.

I like these! The muffins are super moist. I could tell at first glance that the recipe was missing a few ingredients.  I added 1 tsp salt, vanilla, cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.  I liked the idea that a previous poster said about soaking the oatmeal in buttermilk, but I soaked mine in peach juice. I wanted the recipe to get the full effect of the buttermilk.  One change I will make next time is to use 2 tsp baking powder instead of using baking soda. My muffins didn't rise at all,  and a former recipe that I use for blueberry muffins uses 2 tsp baking powder without adding soda and those muffins had great height. I also added more sugar; brown sugar and turbinado sugar especially since it called for oatmeal, and oatmeal is very bitter. All in all. I probably added about 2/3 cup sugar and I added coconut oil for fat, 1/2 cup. I didn't like the idea of the recipe not having any fat, especially when most muffin recipes call for about one cup of vegetable oil.  I decreased the oven temperature to 350 and chose to cook them a bit longer and they still came out a little burnt on the edges. But it is a very tasty muffin!

I am really enjoying these muffins! I guess I can't speak for the original recipe, since I made many adjustments to fit my needs (the original recipe would probably taste better!): doubled the recipe to freeze some, used skim milk with vinegar instead of buttermilk, used splenda for half of the brown sugar, and used gluten-free flour (thus adding xanthan gum). I will try to add a pinch of salt next time.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

I would say that "spiced" is a misnomer, there is hardly any spice in these at all. I also found the molasses to be overpowering.  Next time I would add more cinnamon, ginger, and maybe even some cardamom for a truly spiced peach muffin.  I followed the recipe except that I addded salt, used half whole wheat flour, and added a bit of butter and flour to the topping for more of a streussel effect.  They are not very sweet, and certainly healthier than your average muffin.

After reading other reviews, here's how I modified this recipe: - no molasses, just 1/2 cup brown sugar. - pears instead of peaches (it's winter) - whole wheat flour - add 1/2 tsp. ginger, cardamom and vanilla extract - almond milk instead of buttermilk

What a delightful muffin.  I had peaches frozen from over the summer that I defrosted to use in this recipe.  Only change was to cut the molasses in 1/2 because of some previous reviewers noting that it was a little strong.  Really enjoyed the cinnamon/sugar on top.  I added this before baking instead of after 15 minutes.  These are light, fluffy, moist and flavorful.  Great for using up the last of my peaches!

I let the oaks soak in the buttermilk and I think that was my downfall, when I checked on the muffins they were overflowing the pans, so I ended up quickly emptying them into a greased loaf pan and it came out kind of like bread pudding. It was so so.

These were good, with a moist springy texture. Not amazing, even after adding salt and spices. I liked the molasses flavor, but these were just kinda... mild.

These weren't completely awful, but I could have done so much better.  I added salt and extra spices like everyone suggested, but they were still bland and sticky.  If you do want to try them, add more sugar as well.

so my kids do not like to have "chunks" of fruit in their muffins so I used 2 jars of peach puree ( baby food).  it gave the muffins the peach flavor with out the peach pieces. my 3 kids love them.  One day I was out of peach puree and substituted 2 mashed bananas.  love that there is no white sugar (- I don't bother with the topping) and they freeze well so make a double batch!

These were good.  I think chopped pecans in the batter would have made them a 5 star.  I did substitute grape applesauce for regular applesauce (it's all we had); plain no-fat yogurt mixed with skim milk (we had no buttermilk).  I added salt, cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg to the batter.  Very peachy which is good because some recipes overcome that peach taste. And there was no hint of the grape flavor that was in the applesauce in the end product. The recipe made enough for 12 regular sized muffins plus 12 mini-muffins.  The regular cooked for 17 mins; the mini's 10 mins. Thanx for the recipe.  It's a keeper.

Pretty Yummy. I used gluten free stuff to make these so that my cousin could eat them. Gluten free never does taste quite the same. Next time I'll use regular ingredients, I bet they'll be way good!

These were just so-so. The dominant flavor was molasses, and the texture was only ok. They stuck to the muffin liners and made a mess when you tried to get them off neatly, and their appearance wasn't anything special. I can't say as I would make them again, but thanks for the idea anyways.

I have been searching for years for a recipe for fat-free sugar-free blueberry oatmeal muffins like the ones I loved when I was a teenager, before the health-food store that sold them closed down.  Although this recipe isn't sugar-free (nor completely fat-free), I think the results are pretty similar (using blueberries instead of peaches, of course).  These muffins are quite dense and chewy, but if you love oatmeal, as I do, you should appreciate their hearty texture.  And the addition of salt would definitely improve the taste.

These were good and pretty kid friendly.  They do need salt though.  They were a good hearty breakfast muffin and we enjoyed them but I would not serve these for company.

These were tasty, but I'm still not sure how I feel about peaches and molasses together. It's a weird combo. But my fiance ate 4, so maybe it's just me lol.

Quite Good!  I used canned peaches.   If you really want the sugar and cinnamon on top, sprinkle it on before baking.  It just makes a mess to do it after 15 min of baking.

healthy muffin, very moist, doesn't get the crisp top you would expect for a sugar dusted muffin.  tastes a bit bland, but that is likely due to the lack of fat in the batter.  warmed up with a bit of butter makes it better.  I added 1tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the mix as well.

I enjoyed everything about these muffins except the molasses.  There's something about it that doesn't sync with peaches, in my opinion.  So next time I'll try something different in hopes of enhancing the peach flavor.

I love peaches and molasses and I normally reduce the amount of sugar in baking recipes.  That said I followed this recipe exactly and these were some of the worse muffins I've ever tried.  Just not sweet and the molasses overpowers the peaches.

These muffins are awesome! I made a few substitutions but they still turned out delish! I used peach purée instead of applesauce, and made buttermilk by mixing 1 tbsp vinegar with 1 cup milk. Then instead of molasses I added a bit more brown sugar. I also added 1/2 tsp salt and 1 tsp cinnamon. Just enjoyed one for breakfast and am very happy with the result!

I subbed yogurt for the buttermilk and use wheat flour instead of white.  The muffins have a great, moist texture; I don't miss the fat at all.  However, they really only taste like molasses.  I love molasses, but don't really want my peach muffins to taste like gingerbread.

Bland and mushy when prepared according to the directions. I have them back in the oven to see if a longer baking time will help the texture. I wish I had read other reviews instead of trusting the 4 stars this had.

These muffins were not what I had expected.  The 1/4 cup of molasses is way too much, it blocks out the taste of the peaches completely.  I used skim milk in place of buttermilk & forgot to add the 1/2 tsp of salt.  I added the topping at around 10 minutes, but would encourage others to do it even sooner.  I would also recommend not baking for 18 minutes, as it seemed to be too long, making them stick to the wrapper.  My batch made 20 muffins.

Very Good with salt and walnuts added. I made a topping of peaches mixed with a little cream cheese. Just the right amount of extra zing without too much sugar or fat.

These were really good for low fat....I try never to use butter in my baking, and this is a great recipe. I forgot to add salt as other reviewers suggested, and I used soy milk instead of buttermilk, and added ginger and cardamom as per another review. Didnt have applesauce so added same amount of canola oil. Add salt and these would be perfect.

The recipe as stated is okay, I left out the strudel topping and added the cinnamon right into the batter.  For a low-cal healthy breakfast muffin, this is ideal, but a tad lacking on flavour.

I love making muffins, especially low fat ones and these were GREAT!  I did add 1/2 tsp salt and used one egg with 2 egg whites as I had a carton open. Opted to leave the topping part out after reading reviews, but added 1/2 tsp cinammon directly to the batter.  Baked at 375 for about 15 mins, love the chunks of peaches, will make again for sure!

These were not as sweet as I would have liked. They are actually a bit bland and yucky. I got excited when I saw the molasses in the ingredients, but it's like a fancy bran muffin. 

The peaches improve the taste but I was really disappointed and sorry that I wasted my fresh peaches. I don't think I'll be using this recipe again.

These were good! It is my first time to bake or eat a peach muffin, and I am definitely happy with the result. I used part whole wheat pastry flour (about 3/4 cup maybe??) and used honey for part of the molasses because I don't really like too strong of a molasses flavor.  I got 18 regular size muffins and baked them for only 5 minutes before putting on the topping, then returned them to the oven for the remaining 13 minutes.  I definitely think the topping added to the muffin! I'll make these again when I have peaches to use up! The only problem I had was that the muffins really stuck to the paper liner, but this is easily fixed by putting them in the refrigerator.

Pretty tasty muffin.  I used a bag of frozen peaches (thawed and diced, of course) and it seemed to work just fine.  I used honey instead of molasses and put the cinnamon right in the batter and didn't worry about the topping.  The kids loved them as well as  my parents.  I will try this again when peaches are in season.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were very good; not too sweet, with a mild molasses flavor.  They didn't knock my socks off, but I wasn't expecting them to.  For those who had trouble getting the topping to stay on: I brushed the muffin tops with a little bit of water to help the cinnamon/sugar mixture stay on.
