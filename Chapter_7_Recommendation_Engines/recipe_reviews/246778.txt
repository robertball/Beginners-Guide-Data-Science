Pretty simple just very time consuming if you buy super fresh non deveined shrimp. Cooking is a joy for me so didn't bother me one bit. I pat dried and butterflied my shrimp. I did add 1/2 tbsp of cornstarch to the flour mixture. Also I used 4 eggs instead of 2 as I double dipped. After the first coconut dip, I dipped in egg again and packed the coconut and panko mix again! Saut√©ed in olive oil 1.5 minutes each side. Came out perfect!! Boyfriend said better than the ones we had on our first date ??

This dish was awesome I loved it and so did my family. I didnt make the sauce because I dont like apricot flavor. I used the chili sauce and it was as good as being in a restaurant.  I will make this my go to recipe.

My whole family liked this shrimp recipe.  I am not very adept at dipping and breading which is why I only gave 4 stars.

Great recipe. Made the perfect amount of coating for 25 shrimp. I did put the coconut and Panko in my processor for a few spins to make it finer. Will definitely use again!

Next time I would cooking the dipping sauce a bit to be sure the apricot preserves was mixed in well.  Otherwise, great!!
