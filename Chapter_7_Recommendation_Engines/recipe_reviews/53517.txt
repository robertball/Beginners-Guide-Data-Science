This recipe is highly dependent on the vinaigrette you choose, so make sure to get one you like. I'm not real crazy about the bottled raspberry-walnut dressings I've tried (too sweet and 'walnutty'), so I used a regular rasperry vinaigrette and added a couple drops of balsamic and walnut oil. The red lettuce/red grape/goat cheese/pecan combination is beauty! I toasted my pecans for a few minutes at 350. Thanks!

Salad was very good and yes it is all up to the dressing that you choose. Not quite sure why Waldorf is in the name as it has nothing to do with apples and celery.

Yummy! I added a tad more goat cheese because I love it. Next time I will probably make my own dressing. This is just a simple, tasty salad. Thanks!

i didn't have grapes but a green apple was terrific.  and definitely toast the pecans, it makes the flavor even better.

This salad is delicious. I used the kraft raspberry vinaigrette which was just as good. I brought it to my family's Thanksgiving dinner and got many compliments! I cut the grapes in four pieces and used a lot of pecans. You can't go wrong with this one!

Best salad I've ever made, hands down. All the flavors are just perfect together.
I used a Raspberry Acai Vinaigrette and it was the bomb.

Wow!! Fantastic combination of tastes! My daughter and I made this for a dinner party she was having for her birthday. She wanted something different, festive and good. This fit the bill!! Made it using the ingredients as listed and used Newman's Own Lite Raspberry and Walnut dressing. Amazingly good, and looks gorgeous!

Very good salad. I added grilled chicken breast strips. It is essential that a great dressing is used. I prefer a homemade vinaigrette. I also think blue cheese crumbles give the salad more 'kick', than goat cheese.

Made my own raspberry vinaigrette, used roasted pears and baby spinach.  We liked it a lot - my daughter introduced us to goat cheese and it has become a favorite salad "fixing".
