I checked the doneness after 50, 60, 70, and 75 minutes. After 75 minutes, the knife came out barely moist at the tip, so I removed it from the oven. Twenty minutes after removing from the oven, though, the bread had totally collapsed. The bottom third was still not cooked, and I had to cut it off and throw it away. Otherwise, the taste was good, not too sweet at all. I would omit the pineapple though, which I think added too much moisture.
