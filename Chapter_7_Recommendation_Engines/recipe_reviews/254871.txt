Very quick.  I did make some changes - the Knorr Fiesta Side I had was the Queso cheese.  I used half a can of diced tomatoes instead of an actual tomato.  I doubled the corn instead of black beans.  But it was very good.  I think what I liked most was how quick and easy it came together - all in one pot!

This is better than I thought!  I made slight changes due to what I had on hand: taco sauce instead of enchilada sauce and white rice instead of Spanish rice. And I seasoned the chicken with cumin while cooking it. I will be making this again.

Hubby really liked it, I did use Goya yellow rice because the Knorr is more pasta than rice. Next time I might heat it up a little, either with hotter enchilada sauce or some chopped green chilies or jalape√±os. Really good as is, but I see a lot of possiblities for adding more heat or even more veggies. Thanks for a great recipe!

I added rotel instead of the tomato (to save time and add a little more oomph).   My hubby loved it.  We will definitely be making this again.

Delicious! Didn't change anything. Will definitely be making this again.
