If you like clams, you'll enjoy these.  I felt they needed more spice so I added some.  Will make again!

I couldn't find a receipe in my cookbooks and my husband wanted to make clam fritters so I looked on the internet.  He made them and they were DELICIOUS!  I am passing along the receipe to my friends.

After reading the reviews I changed the following: Used green onions instead of white, added 1 teaspoon Old Bay and 3 squirts Texas Pete.  They were delicious.

Don't expect these fritters to be like the round fritters you get at a restaurant, they are truly more like pancakes. But they were good, a tad bland, so we ate them with ranch dressing (all I had). I also made a batch with corn instead of clams...a different taste but not bad! Next time I'd like to spice up the clam version a little and possibly make some type of sweeter sauce to dip them in. But overall, very good!

I followed the directions exactly and found that 1/2 cup of flour was very short.  I doubled the flour and ended up with a mixture that was more like thick pancake batter.  The flavor was good but the texture was soft.  A crispy texture would have been better.  We enjoyed them with salsa and,or tartar sauce.  Maybe adding bread crumbs would have been a good idea?!

These fritters disappeared so fast. After reading the reviews I decided to add a tsp of baking powder to the batter. The fritters did puff up nice with a golden outside and a puffy pillow inside. I did forgo the green peppers. Using two spoons to drop the batter into the grease worked well for me. Salted them generously with Kosher salt as soon as they came out of the fryer. YUM!

Are the clams in their own juice?  If they are, that negates the milk - adding milk makes it a soup.  I tried this with some clam juice, a tad more flour, and a half hour in the fridge to absorb.

A yummy way to eat clams!  Didn't have green pepper, but bet it would be tasty.  Served with tarter sauce and it was a good meal.

My family loves seafood so I'm always looking for new things to make.  I made half the recipe not changing anything and they turned out pretty bland. (I wonder if there is an ingredient missing?) So the other half I added garlic and lemon pepper. They were better, but I dont think I would make them again.

This is a great recipe. Its not bland if you like clams. I left out the onion and the bell pepper. It was perfect! Nothing to hide the taste of the clams.

Maybe I did something wrong but I had to almost double the flour to get them thick enough to fry.  My daughter has tried several clam fritter recipes and thought this was the best.

I just tried these, I did not add the onion or bell pepper, I believe that would have made them even better. The liquid made the batter super runny, I added dry bread crumbs, parmesan cheese and panko, still couldn't really make a patty, i just dropped the batter by the spoonful into the oil and flattened them with the spoon. They'd be great with cocktail sauce or tartar sauce. I did not expect my young sons to like them but they are gobbling them up!

I followed the recipe exactly and thought that they were "ok".  They were, as some of the other reviews said, pretty bland.  I will not be making these again.

These were OK.  It was very soupy with 1/2 cup of flour, no way you could make a patty with that, so I added more flour but in hind sight think 1/2 corm meal might have been good in it.  I added more spices after reading the reviews and spoon  dropped in hot oil to fry (even with added flour it was too soupy to form into patties).  The were ok after tasting first few i added 1 -2 tsp of sugar.  I thought the ones with sugar tasted better than the ones without.

Love, love, love these clam fritters.  I do not add the green pepper, I don't want to distract from the clams!  I serve them with a "blooming onion" sauce for dipping and boy do they go fast!!!

I agree about them being bland but that shouldn't be an obstacle…season them up as you see fit.  I do not recommend frying them in the pan.  I deep fried them and they puffed up into nice balls…I added about half a teaspoon of baking powder and doubled the recipe.  I will make these again…fun way to serve clams.

These didn't taste like clams, and I needed at least double the called-for amount of flour. Even then, I never achieved something that I could "shape", just something I could drop by spoonfuls into the  hot oil. They were fine, but really they were just fried dough balls.

Following other suggestions, I doubled the recipe, added 1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp old bay, 1/4 tsp cayenne, and an additional cup of flour.  I was looking for more of a crispy fritter.  Mine were more like fritter muffins.  Next time I would skip the extra flour but keep the additional seasoning.

Followed the recipe exactly and ended up with a pancake like batter so I added more flour to be able to make patties and the patties after cooking were very heavy.

These were good! I needed a bit more flour and they def needed more seasoning and salt, IMO, but that's up to your own personal tastes. I also added a tsp, of baking powder, as others suggested, and deep fried them, using my scoop to portion them out into balls. I did not use the green pepper. I would like to play around with this a bit more...Thanks for sharing. :)

I really wanted to like these but they just didn't do it for me. The consistency was way off, more like a crepe. They would also benefit with some seasonings, old bay comes to mind. Perhaps if they were deep fried but that is not how the recipe is written. Sorry Christine.
