Since putting this recipe on here, I have become a vegetarian. And since I loved this recipe, I came up with a meatless way to eat it. Simply take a package of the Morningstar crumbled soymeat (defrosted), and add a bit more ketchup and evap milk to make it a sticky precooked consistency . I then zapped it with some Montreal steak seasoning in addition to the rest of the ingredients and slathered in cheese. Still yummy. THX

The flavor was good, but like others said, I cooked the meat first. Very easy and will make again!!

Followed the ingredient list except for the  cornflake crumbs...didn't have any, so used Ritz cracker crumbs as I do for my meatloaf, and I added shredded cheese to the mix.  Changed up the cooking method a bit for an experiment.  Used about 6 small Italian hoagie buns, split.  Spread the meat mixture about a 1/2 inch thick on one side and then put the top back on.  I then wrapped each individually in foil and baked 30 minutes in the 375* oven.  To serve, I cut each in half.  Worked out faily well this way and kept the bun from getting too crunchy.  My son liked them very much, but my husband and I thought they we just ok...just seemed to be lacking *something* for me, and my husband didn't like the soggy bread bits.  My try again sometime.

We loved these cheeseburgers! The crisp bread was out of the ordinary, but really good. I'm a picky eater, so I loved the meat and cheese filling, but I'm sure it would be tasty with extras like peppers, mushrooms, etc.

A pretty decent recipe... I used the suggestion of another reviewer and added an egg into the meat mix, and was pretty satisfied.  That said, next time I'm going to try adding in some minced garlic and perhaps some more Worcestershire sauce.  Worth trying, but expect to add your own tweaks to perfect it.

The filling was good, but the bread crust got so crisp it was nearly impossible to bite through.  If I make this again, I will take another reviewer's tip and brown the meat first and bake only for a short time.

These weren't bad.  My fiance thought they were really good, I thought they were okay.  I'll probably make them again for a quick easy dinner.

This is one of my favorite childhood meals.  We always brown the meat mixture first before filling the bread with it and just bake for a short time.  We also use shredded cheddar for the top and the kids always squirted extra ketchup on the top before eating, too!  Plus, my mother would always give us the bread "insides" for a snack that day!

This recipe sure sounds better than it tastes. It tasted like meatloaf on crusty bread to me. My family wouldn't want me to make it again.

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  It is something I grew up eating, but had not been able to find the recipe for.  I made it last night and got much comfort from it.  My husband says it's a "keeper", and that's not the reaction I've gotten from all of the recipes I've tried from this site!  I urge everyone to try it.

Very flavorful!  My husband couldn't stop eating it.  Our dinner guests also loved it.  It is more like meatloaf than a cheeseburger but that's just wording.  Easily serves 6-8.  Very filling.  I used 1 tsp of onion powder because one of my dinner guests does not like onions.  It may have been a little too much - but probably the reason my husband liked it so much, lots of flavor.  Caution: not a daity sandwich :)

This was really good. I didn't think 1lb. of ground beef would feed my family of 6, but after adding all the other ingredients this recipe does make alot. Adults and kids liked it and it's great for an easy to prepare meal. Will add this to my list of favorite quick and easy to make recipes. Note: I placed the bread on a wire rack and put the rack on a baking sheet. This kept the bread from getting too hard on the bottom.

not for little kids! I love the idea of this recipe; it seems easy enough to whip up and an economical way to make 1 pound of hamburger feed 6 people at least, but it ends up being too dry and crusty. by the time the meat is done, the bread is TOO done.

because i love the idea, i fidgeted with the recipe and came up with one semi-acceptable modification before giving up . I added 1 CAN CREAM OF MUSHROOM to the meat mix, and that made the meat less dry. Possibly if I had teenagers this could work, but it was just too dry and too big for my 4 and 6 year olds mouths.

Way too much worcestershire sauce.  My kids had a hard time touching this one, but they are very picky.  Won't make again.

I followed the recipe exactly. I got a ketchup flavored medicore meat loaf open faced sandwich. Neither my wife or I finished our portion and we threw the rest away. Very disappointing. The best part was the melted cheese.

I have been eating this recipe for 50 years and it is one of my favorites. I make it exactly the same minus the onion. It was originally called "Longboy Cheeseburgers". She saw it in a magazine when she was getting her hair done. It's one of our family traditions.

Wow!  This was very simple to make and it tasted great.  As other reviews have stated, the bread was a little overdone by the time the meat was cooked, but for me it was only a few millimeters on the outside that were crunchy - the inside of the bread was still soft.  Maybe the fact that I used one of our homemade loaves made a difference.  Anyway, I will certainly be making this one again.  Thanks for an amazing recipe!

This is a childhood favorite that I still love today, as do my kids. I use 1 Tbsp Worc sauce, and 1/2 cup crumbs. Also, my recipe called for the refrigerated Brown n Serve bread/rolls. These don't burn on the bottom or get too crispy, but they're increasingly harder to find. I made today with the Nonrefrigerated kind and burned the bottoms. I will try on a rack next time, as suggested by another reviewer. These make an easy to eat, finger food for the most part. We usually make as a meal, but they work very well as an appetizer as well.
