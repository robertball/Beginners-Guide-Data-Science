I have since made this 3 times and found the trick to perfecting this the second time around!  Here's my recommendation for "authentic" homemade horchata:  put 1 1/3 cup rice in the blender - add about 2 cups of water and 2 cinnamon sticks and blend until the rice and cinnamon are roughly ground.  Add the remaining water and blend thoroughly.  Pour into a pitcher and place in the refrigerator to soak (overnight is best) - or at the very least 4-5 hours.  Strain the mixture through a sieve.  I doubled the amount of milk called for - and about half the sugar (a generous 1/3 cup as I like my horchata not too sweet) and a generous splash of vanilla.  PERFECTO!

wonderful! I used my coffee grinder to grind up the rice before soaking because my blender is broken and the food processor didn't do the trick.  It worked great. Also I made a syrup of the last cup of water, sugar, cinnamon and cinnamon sticks and then added it to the rice water. It seemed to help the sugar and cinnamon mix better that way. Oh and don't throw out  the rice. It's perfect for Creamy Rice pudding (recipe on this site)

This is the best horchata recipe I have ever found. I found that ground cinnamon floats on the top so I let 2 cinnamon sticks soak with the rice and water for 3 hours. Nice flavor!

Wonderful!!  I did, however, follow a few reviewers suggestions and I also changed the servings to 10 since I needed a larger amount for a party.  I found that the flavor was better the longer it sat, so I served it the following day.  There was a lot of undissolved cinnamon, but I found the perfect solution to be straining the entire mixture through a coffee filter just before serving.  Because it sat overnight, the flavor was still full, but you did not get mouth-fulls of undissolved cinnamon with each sip.  What I consider the perfect measurements for 10 servings is the following:  1-2/3c uncooked white long-grain rice; 8c water; 1/2c sugar; 1-1/2t ground cinnamon; 2c milk; 3/4c+2T sweetened condensed milk; 2-1/2t vanilla extract.  Fabulous!!

I had to really change this recipe to fit my taste...This one is way too watery and the cinnamon did not mix well..from now on I will always use cinnamon sticks to soak in the rice water. Also it doesn't even make enough to fill a pitcher, so I added like 3 times the milk (because I like it thick)and also very important...I ground the rice a LOT because I like it a little gritty....it just depends how you like your horchata...I like mine rich and thick....if you do too add more milk and ground the rice a lot and it will turn out good...you can still use 1 cup of rice to start off with and adding more milk makes it soo good!

I have been looking for an authentic horchata recipe for a long time...glad to say that I have finally found it! Serena's review was very helpful to me. I too ground the rice and 2 cinnamon sticks together with 2 cups of water to soak them. Once I finished grinding I added 2 more cups of water and blended well. I soaked the mixture overnight and put it through a fine mesh seive. I added a 5oz can of evaporated milk for extra creaminess as I only had 2% milk. I poured the evaporated milk into measuring cup and then the regular milk to make up the difference for a total of 2 cups of milk, 1 Tbls. of vanilla and 1/3 cup of sugar. It turned out so creamy, refreshing and delicious and the best part was that it had a very pronounced cinnamon taste without being overpowering and none of it floating around in the glass. Will be making this for years to come. Thanks for sharing!!

My family loves horchata and we drink it all the time in restaurants so I was excited about making it at home.  However, I'm not really thrilled with how it turned out.  I only used a half a cup of sugar and it was still really sweet, like horchata is sapposed to be.  The problem with this recipe is the cinnamon.  The drink turns out brown, not white like in the picture.  And I had to skim a lot of cinnamon off the top because it wouldn't blend in.  The taste was pretty much right on, just a little more watery then we're used to.  I'm going to experiment with boiling cinnamon sticks in the water and then blending it with the rice.

This went over really well with my coworkers.  It is relatively simple, and I made with part cream to add a slightly thicker texture since I use skim milk.
I also used a cloth tea bag for the cinnamon so that the spices wouldn't change the color or texture of the drink.

Best horchata recipe Ive tried, but I would use 1/2 as much sugar and if it's not sweet enough add more sugar!

I thought this horchata was really good. I love horchata and I just always figured it would really hard to make. I'm such a terrible cook but this recipe worked for me. I was really surprised. It came out tasting just like horchata from the mom and pop taquerias. Loved it!

Great recipe 'as is.' I only have these tips. Use only one or two cups of water when grinding the rice; it otherwise causes rice to jump and not grind. Like others suggest, I also use 3 or 4 cinnamon sticks to soak and then remove them. For my taste, I cut the sugar. Real horchata does not use milk, so I sometimes substitute a handful of almonds to grind with the rice and soak -- makes a nice almond milk and therefore vegan. This is the recipe I use all the time.

Great recipe!  I never thought it'd be so easy to make horchata, and now I can have it whenever I want.  I did do a couple things differently, just to speed up the process and make things a little easier for me, so that mine was done in about an hour.  Instead of only blending up the rice for a minute, I blended the rice + 2 cups of water for a good long while, probably 5+ minutes, also pulsing until the rice was as fine as it seemed it would go.  Then, I put a couple teaspoons of ground cinnamon into a coffee filter, gathered the top, stapled it shut, and dropped that into the rice mixture so the flavor would come out during the "steeping" time.  I left it about an hour, coming back to pulse the blender every so often.  (Don't forget to temporarily remove the cinnamon pouch when pulsing if you're going to do this.)  After an hour, I gave it one last whir in the blender, strained it through a fine-meshed sieve, then put it back in the blender with a dash more cinnamon, the sugar, vanilla and milk, then served right away with ice.  It was perfect!  It had all the rice flavor I was expecting, and didn't take nearly as long as I thought it would, which I think can be attributed to pulsing up the rice so fine to begin with.  The result was the perfect horchata - just like at my favorite Mexican restaurants.

Awesome!  I make this recipe daily when my Mexican in-laws are around.  I just made it again today for probably the 50th time and didn't have milk so I used 2 cans of evaporated milk, you can use any milk product like soy, almond, etc.  I usually like to soak cinnamon sticks with the rice but if you add ground cinnamon with the rice soaking (sometimes for a couple days if I forget) in the fridge and you get the flavor but you won't get the powder floating and choking you as you drink since most of it strains out with the rice.   I've used sweetened condensed milk for more richness, no need for any additional sugar then. I've made this so many times now and the recipe is so forgiving, as long as you soak the rice, add whatever else of milk, sugar, and spices to taste.  Also best when served frothy, use a wisk or beaters or I put it in a bottle with ice and shake well just before serving.  And I always keep the leftover rice to make arroz con leche/rice pudding.  Many recipes for it on this site, but just boil the rice to tender in some combination of milk/water/evaporated milk (obviously I'm not one for measuring, I add several cups to make it soupy then boil it down) and add milk/cream/sweet condensed milk and sugar, simmer to thicken, and vanilla/cinnamon/cloves to taste at the end.  Thanks Lola!

Made this using another reviewer's suggestion of halving the sugar (also subbed agave for refined white sugar) and grinding rice and cinnamon sticks beforehand. Best to soak it overnight. Amazing.

I LOVE Horchata, but I had never made it before. I was really excited to come across this recipe! 

Upon the suggestion of other reviewers, I used 2 cinnamon sticks instead of the ground cinnamon. I love the cinnamon flavor and this adds so much to it. Also, I let mine soak overnight in the fridge instead of a couple of hours before I strained it. Soooooo worth it, because it was soooo good. 

Needless to say, I did not realize making it from scratch was so easy. I will be making this again.

This horchata was SO GOOD! I followed Serena's suggestions and cut down on the sugar to 1/3 cup and blended the rice w/ 2 cinn sticks w/ 2 cups of water until it ground. Then added the other 2 cups of water and let it sit overnight in the fridge. I did put it through a sieve twice and then added the milk (I used whole) and sugar. I actually forgot the vanilla extract and it was still really good! I am SO excited it was easy! My husband said it tastes just like his mom's and that's a compliment. She is old school and KNOWS how to cook! Thanks for sharing Lola and thanks for the tips Serena!!!

This recipe is awesome.  Except that when I came across it after dinner, it just so happened that I had over a cup of COOKED rice left.  So I stuck it in a blender with a cup of water and blended it REALLY well.  Then I followed the rest of the instructions, using more sugar and way more milk, and I never even strained anything- it worked out AWESOME.

AWESOME!! Turned out great! I changed slightly based on previous reviews. I put in 1 1/3 cups rice along with 2 cups of water and a heaping half tablespoon of ground cinnamon and blended for a few minutes. Then I added the last 3 cups of water. Let it sit in the fridge overnight. I strained the mixture with a cheesecloth then put liquid back in pitcher and added 1/3 cup of sugar and a splash on vanilla and a whole cup of milk. Served in a glass with ice. Went over terrific! Best Horchata  I have ever had!!!

I have made this recipe two days in a row.  I made a few adjustments.  First, I soaked the rice over night in four cups water, one can evaporated milk, 1 tsp vanilla extract, and two cinnamon sticks.  Then, I blended the mixture.  I have found that evaporated milk really brings out the flavor of the horchata.

I loved it, the rest of my family not so much - but I didn't make it for them :)  I did double the cinnamon, because I love it so much, and halved the sugar for the second batch, and I loved it even more, but my family still didn't like it, their loss!

I followed other reviews and added a cinnamon stick to the rice water.  I then doubled the milk, combined it with 1/2 t. cinnamon and sugar, and boiled it into a thin syrup before mixing.  It is good, but I think it might need just a little further tweaking.

I decided to make this today, it definetely is an all day or night process to get the best flavor. I think it is a pretty good starter recipe, I'm definetely going to tinker with the measurements a bit more. It is very good though. What I did was blend vanilla and ground cinnamon with the rice and water (it doesn't float if you do it this way). I then let it sit all day in the fridge, but every few hours I would pull it out and give it a few pulses in the blender, you get the most out of your rice. Overall it is a good recipe, some people prefer sweeter or less sweeter (like me), and luckily this recipe is pretty forgiving because you can always add more water if it's too sweet. The color is a little darker than what I grew up on, but I think it's because my vanilla extract was brown. Thanks for this recipe.

This was...odd.  It came out a little gritty even after we strained it and ended up with a really weird texture.  Leaving a weird coat in your mouth.  Despite the texture it didn't taste too bad although I cut down on the sugar (about 1/2 cup).  Overall, I would probably not make this again.

i would rate this 5 stars but PLEASE use cinnamon sticks. I thought it didn't matter but it makes a HUGE difference. Also make sure you use long grain rice. The long grain rice blends very nicely with my oster blender. The better blending (I blended mine 2-3 times) of the rice the thicker the horchata. I practically did not strain out ANYTHING.

I have never had horchata before, so I can't speak to the authenticity of this recipe. However, I am fully prepared to tell you that this is DELICIOUS! I took the advice of other reviewers and soaked two cinnamon sticks with the rice. I also cut back the sugar to 1/2 cup. This was sweet enough for me! Very delicious recipe -- one I will absolutely make in the future

I carefully read through dozens of reviews so I could make this as tasty as possible.  I used the coffee grinder to grind the rice and it doesn't take very using this technique FYI.  I grinded the rice with cinnamon as well.  I let it soak all evening before straining the rice water and adding in the rest of the ingredients... I also just added sugar to taste per recommendations.  I also had 3/4 of a half gallon of whole milk around so i just dumped it all in the pitcher and sweetened to taste.  Pretty simple and quite refreshing!  Oh and use a coffee filter for the rice mixture, SO much less hassle then straining the whole recipe.

It's okay, but not the best horchata I have ever had. I am looking for an authentic old fashioned homemade recipe and this is easy but not that special taste I'm looking for.

I've spent most my life in Arizona, and horchata is so good on a hot day. This recipe is tasty and so easy! I've made it as written (make sure you use whole milk for best flavor), and have also made it with vanilla soy milk (VERY yummy!). I add the cinnamon to the rice before soaking...it seams to incorporate into the liquid better that way, instead of floating on the top. I don't know how well this keeps in the refrigerator, because there's never any left over! Thank you Lola for the recipe.

This is a great horchata recipe, and I always drink horchata at mexican restaurants.  I increased the serving size to 10, and the pitcher was still only 2/3 full.  I would recommend substituting the cinnamon for cinnamon sticks.  Just put about 3 cinnamon sticks in the rice/water mixture and let that sit for as long as you can (I did 7 hours).  The longer it sits, the better flavor you get.  Followed the rest of the recipe to a tee (used 2% milk), and its great... you can really taste the cinnamon, and you don't have to worry about what all the other reviewers complain about -- cinnamon floating on the top and not mixing in.  :)  With the cinnamon sticks, there's no mess.

It was really yummy however when I first made it and drank it it just tasted really dirty so the second time I made the horchata I washed the rice throughly and then blended it and it was much better but besides that it was very similar to my grandmothers and hers is amazing!!:)

I made some adjustments, I doubled the recipe, used 3 cinnamon sticks soaked with the rice water over night. I also double the amount of milk, because I thought it was too watery. But it turned out fabulous!! Loved it! Definitely use cinnamon sticks to soak with rice water over night.

Great to use as a base recipe. Instead of using ground cinnamon, I used 2 cinnamon sticks, that I blended with the rice and water and soak. I soaked it overnight (almost a full 24 hours at room temp). I added more milk about 1 cup but I used 1%  and used 1/3 cup + 2 tbsp sugar (probably could have gone only 1 additional tbspof sugar and been okay - its a little sweet for my liking) but 2/3 cup is WAY too sweet. Great recipe and since I used cinnamon sticks instead of ground, it was a beautiful milky white color. YUM!!! Will definetly make this again!

Lola, I love you. Thank you so much for this simple recipe! I use less water, more milk, two sticks of cinnamon, sweeten to taste and leave to sit overnight now that I've experimented more. I've made this so often, I don't feel the need to measure anymore. I've tried this recipe, following it to a T, and that's what the four star rating is based on. I've just perfected it to suit my tastes! Yum! :)

I made this with sweetened condensed milk in addition to the milk and I let the rice and cinnamon soak overnight.  It tasted better than anything I have ever had in a restaurant.  Thanks, Lola!

Great recipe!  I didn't know horchata was so easy to make or I would have done so a long time ago.  I did add the cinnamon to the rice and water in the blender so it wouldn't float later...seemed to work well.  I also cut both the cinnamon and vanilla down to 1 teaspoon since my first batch was too strong for me.  I also prefer less sugar, so I cut that in half as well.  Will be making this over and over again!

I've only tasted horchata once and never made it before.  It was...a learning experience.  If you don't have a blender and substitute a food processor, DO NOT put very much water in with the rice because centrifugal force will send the water right up the sides of the food processor and out onto the counter because there isn't a seal on the top.  In spite of the mini-flood I was able to make the horchata and I enjoyed the flavor although if I made it again I would cut back a little on the sugar and use cinnamon sticks as others have suggested.  I liked the cinnamon flavor, but not all the powdered cinnamon that settled on the bottom of the glass.

I tried this recipe the first time and it did not really taste like authentic horchata. It had too much vanilla, not enough cinnamon, and the texture was not right. The second time I made some adjustments and it was amazing. First, as someone said, blend two cups of water with one cup rice and two cinnamon sticks. Then I added three cups of water and let it sit out for four hours, then refrigerated overnight. I put it back in the blender with 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon and 1/2 tsp vanilla, then strained out the gritty bits of rice. I added 1/3 c brown sugar and 1 c milk (low-fat or non-fat milk does not overwhelm the flavor) and blended again. I strained it one last time and served over ice.

I put the rice, water, and cinnamon in the blender together.  If I have cinnamon sticks, I let them soak in the water after I blend.  

Cheese cloth works perfect. I lay it in my strainer and pour the rice-water into a jug afterwards and finish the final touches then. :-) Pefecto!

We have never had "authentic" Horchata so I can't compare it, however, we absolutely love this drink. My wife insists that a jug be kept in the refrigerator from June until fall. We first had a Rum Chata and since we couldn't buy it in Canada I went looking for a recipe. Thank you so much Lola, the only changes I have made to your recipe are to add the cinnamon to the rice and then strain both through a piece of cheesecloth in my strainer. This keeps the floating bits down. When it goes into the jug I add a cinnamon stick to the mix and just leave it in the jug in the fridge. I also use 50/50 white long grain rice and Basmatti since it is what we usually keep in the house. The last addition for a warm summer evening is an ounce or two (depending upon your glass size) of spiced rum, we like Sailor Jerry's but any will do.

This is the second best horchata I have ever had!! Letting the rice sit longer makes the horchata better.  One thing I did was substitute about a teaspoon of cinnamon flavoring instead of real cinnamon. I also added one cinnamon stick to it, and I only put a pinch of cinnamon in it for color.  Why I did this is because the cinnamon was sticking to my throat when I drank it, which was very unpleasant.  Thank you so much for the superb recipe!!!

i saw all the reviews and thought this would be great but its not.  its WAAAAY to watery and had way too much vanilla in it.  i thought the sugar content was "ok"as was the cinnamon but everything else was off.  you have to make changes to EVERYTHING ELSE in order for it to be good.  after making it i know exactly what to tweek (which is everything) and it will come out good but as far as this recipe  and directions... look at the sugestions from all the reviews or you will be dissapointed

This is really good!  Even my picky husband who's used to the authentic stuff likes it!  After making it a few times, here's what works best for me.  First, I double it because it doesn't make much.  I blend together 2c water, all of the rice, cinnamon & vanilla.  I pour the mixture into a large pitcher & add the rest of the water & stir.  I leave it in fridge overnight, then strain out the rice in the morning through something fine enough to catch the undissolved cinnamon.  I add the milk (double what the recipe calls for) & sweeten it with 1/4 tsp NuNaturals Stevia Extract Powder instead of sugar.  I tried blending the rice w/all the water in the beginning & again after it had soaked & I really didn't notice a difference in taste & it was a bit of a hassle, especially since I doubled it.  I've tried it with brown rice & it's just as delicious!

This combined with the one below it made the most authentic horchata I have ever had. I used to drink it with a Mexican coworker of mine who gave me the recipe some years ago, but I lost it in a move. Now that I am pregnant, I have been craving it. Below is the recipe  I actually used, which,  thanks to Lola and Serena, made the best horchata I've ever had!!  INGREDIENTS (Nutrition) •	1 ¼ cup uncooked white long-grain rice •	5 cups water •	1/2 -1 whole tablespoon vanilla extract •	1-2 cinnamon sticks •	2/3 cup sugar (preferably turbinado) DIRECTIONS 1.	Pour the rice, 1 cups of water and cinnamon sticks into the bowl of a blender; blend until the rice breaks up into very small pieces. Might take a few minutes. 2.	Slowly add water as rice mixture thickens, to 3 cups. 3.	Blend until even, add the remainder of water, sugar, and vanilla and blend until mixed (may have to do this in two steps, pouring some off of the top into storage pitcher if blender isn’t big enough.  If so, keep the rice in the bottom and mix with remaining water.) 4.	Let rice and water  in the refrigerator for 5 hours to overnight  5.	Strain the rice water into a pitcher and discard the rice.

This tastes like sweet, cinnamon water. It is light brown in color...not very appetizing.  I think I will keep trying.

Really good! The one change I made - and I felt it was an important one - was to blend the rice water mixture after soaking as well (so I blended it both before and after the soaking period). This way, the rice has softened and blends more easily, giving the water more flavor. Otherwise it came out way too watery. The other changes (more milk, less sugar, etc.) are really just a matter of personal preference!

I made some changes... I used 6 cups of water and two cups of milk and two whole tablespoons of vanilla extract. I did not blend the rice in, only let it boil until almost a mashed consistency and then I drained the rice water from the rice. I let two cinnamon sticks sit in the mix while it was cooling down and added a little more powdered cinnamon to taste. I let it sit for a few hours and enjoyed.

Recipe came out very good, a little too much cinnamon - instead of 1 TBSP, try 1 tsp. I refrigerated horchata for about 6 hrs then strained through a cheesecloth twice. MUCH BETTER THAT WAY!!

Taste just like the ones I would get back in AZ! I have made it exactlly as written and I have also follow reviewers changes about using cinnamon sticks and reducing the sugar by 1/2. I liked them both, I will make like the reviews say though just cause I didn't miss the sugar, it still tasted great and using the cinnamon sticks made it so the cinnamon didn't clump together in the pitcher.

This is the best homemade horchata recipe I have found.  It's quick and easy and my family loves it.  An excellent beverage to serve with Mexican food and a nice milk substitute for those who are lactose-intolerant if you omit the milk.  I do recommend using cinnamon sticks, a tea bag, or straining before serving to remove the ground cinnamon.

WAY too much cinnamon. Second try with less cinnamon would get 5 stars, but the original gets four for this reason.

Followed the recipe to the "T" and it came out phenomenal! The best home-made Horchata I've ever had. I used a hand held mixer instead of blending it and only let the rice soak for 4hrs. Came out wonderfully.

Good for a basic recipe. Like other reviewers, you need to adjust this to your own personal taste. I doubled the recipe, added only 1 cup of sugar and strained out the cinnamon (which left the perfect amount of cinnamon to taste).  The milk I doubled and also added some cream, because that's what I had. :) My husband loved how I adjusted the taste and next time I will soak this over night! Good recipe... I'd say 3 stars.

You know, I have procrastinated rating this recipe for a long time because I have no idea how it's actually supposed to turn out. My husband loves horchata, so I made this for him. I ground the rice in the blender (a little too much I think) and then followed the instructions to soak.  Every once in a while I would pass through the kitchen and blend it again because it looked like everything had separated.  After soaking time, I blended it a final time, and then strained it through a fine seive a million times to get rid of the chalky rice remains.  There was still quite a bit of that chalky-ness left, but I did everything I could. the flavor was awesome, but next time I'm going to use a cheesecloth with the seive to get rid of more of the rice stuff.

This recipe is really easy to follow and it is a tasty drink that everyone can enjoy.  I like to let the rice sit in the water overnight in the fridge instead of at room temperature.  That way when I mix the rest of the ingredients together, the drink will be nice and cold.

I really liked the way this recipe came out. I changed a few things though, like blending the rice before and after it was soaked cause usually after it's been soaking for so long it gets a lot softer ad you're able to get the most out of it. I also went ahead and added more milk and sugar. I didn't have any cinnamon sticks but if you add a little more cinnamon than what it calls for it will turn out just fine. All that to say, I'll definitely make this one again.

I'm amazed by how easy it was! It was creamier than the stuff we've gotten at restaurants. At first I used a coffee filter, but that was way too slow. A sieve worked fine to strain out the rice. Thank you, Lola!

I make this all the time. We like creamier hochata so we add a lot of milk and I do add a little more rice. I also let it soak over night that way it gets more flavor and the cinnamon doesn't seem so gritty.

Good recipe! In the absence of a blender, we used a food processor to chop the rice. It didn't work terribly well, but our horchata still tasted lovely after three hours of sitting. Next time we'll use a blender for the rice and use whole milk instead of skim for a richer drink.

This was much better than OK, but not great.  I don't have white rice in the house, just brown, so that's what I used.  I decreased the sugar, but it was still a bit too sweet.  My husband liked it but said it was thin, so I'll adjust here and there - little less sugar, more milk or try a milk/cream mixture.  I am also going to try it with homemade almond milk (1/4 c. almonds to 1 c. water in the blender) and use a bit of agave nectar instead of the white sugar.  Definitely a keeper with a few tweaks.  Thanks for sharing!

I dont know if I did something wrong; i dont think so; but the flavor was not to my liking. I let it soak overnight hoping it would be better, but in my opinion it tasted better when I only let it soak for 3-4 hours. Also, this is way too much water; the flavor is immensely watery. I wouldlike to try making it again and find a way to perfect the recipe.

As others suggested...I soaked cinna sticks with rice and reduced sugar. It turned out great. My husband loved it.

Horchata is my wife’s favorite drink so I made it on a hot summer afternoon as a surprise. I love the recipe – it is simple and delicious but too sweet for my taste. The second time I made it I added about half of the suggested sugar and it was about right – great recipe.

This is a great recipe! It's actually better than what you find in a Mexican restaurant because they tend to water it down a bit to stretch it out. Nothing is better than this on a hot summer day!!

This recipe was extremely watery. I let the rice sit overnight and doubled the milk and it still wasn't the same consistency as horchata I have had in the past. Not to mention the cinnamon globe that form from the ground cinnamon. That is easily remedied by soaking a cinnamon stick with the rice, but, again, the texture was off on this. I will keep looking.

It's decent, slighty sweet. 
Let the rice really soak.

Too much sugar; use half what it calls for. I used 1 cup milk (and 1/2 cup less water) than it said so it wasn't so watery. Cinnamon is perfect amount; I splashed a bit more vanilla in. I blended the sugar and cinnamon in with the rice and liquid so that it blended better. There was still sediment at the bottom after straining though. But SO tasty!

I followed other people advice turned out great. Heres how I made it. Put 1-1/3 c uncooked rice in blender. added 2 cups milk. pureed 20 sec. then added 3 cups cold water. pureed 30 more sec. Let soak in refrigerator over night. Next day I once again pureed mixture 20 more sec. then added 1/2 Tablespoon cinnamon, 1 T vanilla, 3/4 cup half and half, and 3/4 c sugar and pureed 20 more sec. Then I poured it into a piture and seved it to everyone over crushed ice in individual cups. I never strained it. My family likes it unstrained and so do all my latin co workers. anyway, good base recipe.  (i know adding milk and cream and stuff isnt very traditional. its just how ive always prefered it)

I soaked the rice overnight with a cinnamon stick.  The next day I blended the rice in my Vitamix and subbed Splenda for the sugar. Good base recipe.

This is a great recipe, but should steep a bit longer at room temperature (I suggest overnight) before mixing in the milk.

Turned out pretty good! I changed the recipe by using 1/4 cup of half and half and 1/4 of skim milk. I also added only a half cup of sugar and it was still plenty sweet! My blender couldn't fit all of the rice and water so I had to do two "batches" that I later combined. I only let my rice soak for 3 hours and it still turned out perfectly!

I have made this recipe several times. The only alteration I make is that I put half of a cinnamon stick in with the rice and water. During the 3 hours, I will occasionally pulse the rice, water, and cinnamon. (BTW: It's great with a splash of good, dark rum!)

While I've drank plenty, this was my first attempt at making horchata and I must say, I am pleased with the result.  After reading too many reviews and too many other recipes, I settled on this one.  As with some other reviewers, I used a long grain BROWN rice, blended the rice with 2 cups of water with 2 broken cinnamon sticks for about 30 seconds.  Then added the 3 remaining cups of water.  I use a Vitamix so I used care not to pulverize it too much.  My rice, water, cinnamon blend actually sat overnight and a workday in the refrigerator.  I used evaporated milk and reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup using turbinado sugar.  I love cinnamon and vanilla (Mexican blend) so I added double the suggested amount.  Because my mixture was cold, I put it all back in the blender for a few seconds to help the sugar dissolve.  It went back in the fridge for another overnight.  Seems like too long to wait, I know.  But it was well worth it.  For health reasons, I will stop consuming dairy products so the next time I make it I will use Almond milk.  This way, I won't feel deprived of the a sweet "dairy" treat! YUMMY!

This recipe is good but if you add 8 ounces of evaporated milk it makes it richer and creamier.

I thought this was very good but too sweet. I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and it was still too sweet. The only other change I made was that I used almond milk instead of regular milk.

Just made this - didn't like it at all.  First, they say to mix the water and rice together but there is too much water to break the rice down properly in the blender.

Actually... this isn't a Mexican beverage, but rather originates in Andalucia, Spain during the Moorish occupation between the eighth to thirteenth centuries.

I am so happy I can finally make this instead of failing to find it in resteraunts around town. The cinnimon was a little overkill, but I solved that by simply adding a bit more milk. All in all, I'm very glad you posted this.

I worked at an authentic Mexican restaurant for a long time and became hooked on the horchata they made there. I doubled this recipe and used a little less sugar. I also put the cinnamon into the blender with the water and rice to steep overnight and strained it in a very fine strainer and found that it worked very well. (you could even strain it through a T-shirt, I became used to the grainy cinammon and don't mind a bit of it in the horchata though.) I love it!

Great drink. I changed it a little, but this is a fabulous base recipe.

As suggested by another reviewer, I used whole cinnamon sticks instead. I mixed 1 1/3 cup rice, 2 cinnamon sticks, and 2 cups a water in a blender and blended. Then I added 3 more cups of water and blended a whole lot more. I poured it all into a pitcher and let it soak overnight--the time came out to about 17 hours by the time I got around to finishing it. 
I strained the mixture, then doubled the milk and added it. I actually more than doubled it just to finish off the jug--so about 1 1/3 cups. I used only 1% milk and I might use less if it was 2% or whole milk. Then I added 1/2 tbsp of vanilla like instructed which was plenty. I added half the sugar and tasted it--way not sweet--so I added the other half. I think it's a little too sweet for me now so I might just do 1/2 cup of sugar next time instead of 2/3 and see how that goes. 

Yum!

A couple things:
For authentic mexican taste, use canela sticks aka spanish cinnamon (available at your local latino market).

I did a couple batches simultaneously. Like other users, I opted to use a can of evaporated milk in this recipe instead of the milk called for.

To strain, you can use jelly bags or a fine sieve.

I tossed the recipe together in my slow cooker and let it do its' thing all day, blitzed part-way through with my immersion blender, and strained. It was nice and thick and creamy, so this way you can add water till its the texture you like, and let people do their own sugar so they're happier with the resulting beverage.

I also did a batch of this in a solar oven sans milk.

Delicious. I use 1 teaspoon cinnamon and blend it in with the rice. Three hours is not long enough to soak, though. I recommend soaking overnight.

Delicious! so much tastier than the slimy restaurant versions I've had. I have made it 2x now, cutting back on the sugar to 1/2 c, and adding in lime zest instead of vanilla. I love this recipe. Thank you!

This was so good once I followed some suggestions. I tried a few different batches. The best was using the cinnamon sticks (2 for the full recipe). You blend the water and rice together and let it break up a lot. Then put in 2 cinnamon sticks and let it sit in the refrigerator for 6 hours or more. Then strain it out using a colander. I added a bit more milk to taste, maybe only 2Tbs. And I used less sugar, only about a half a cup. Some other recipes call for almonds or almond extract. I found that the almond is a bit too over powering. Overall, this is great, I love Horchata!

This is a great recipe. The only variations I make is that I put the cinnamon into a coffee filter all tied up and let it set for only a few minutes, then remove. I strain the horchata  really well several times with a sieve, then I let it the liquid set overnight and carefully pour from one container to another, discarding the sediment, I modify the sweetener by only adding 1/2 c. sugar as well. It has a light cinnamon flavor and is really refreshing. Taste is as close to Campeche, Mexico as you can get without being there!

Good taste, but cinnamon liked to sit on the top for a while before floating slowly to the bottom. I would recommend letting it sit in the fridge for a few hours before drinking, that way you don't get a mouthful of cinnamon for the first few glasses.

It's a good recipe, but I realized that I didn't really need directions for making horchata. I tried this five times, until I decided that going by taste rather than measurement is a better way to make horchata.  First, I made a larger serving size than stated. Second, I ground the rice enough to make it into tiny flakes. I also added cinnamon sticks into the blender. I poured the rice and water mixture into a bowl and left it in the fridge for a day. Drained the water and added the rest. I definitely added way more milk than suggested. Added 1 and 1/2 tbl of vanilla extract and sugar to taste. My family loved it!  I noticed the longer the water stands, the better it tastes!

I found this recipe a little too watery and not enough rice flavor.  I followed one of the reviewers advice and doubled the amount of milk (used 1 cup), used an extra 1/3 c of rice, and soaked overnight.  Also, the amount of ground cinnamon was too much (as some reviewers had mentioned) so it didn't blend well.    Next time, I would use warmed or boiled water to soak the rice in (to bring out more flavor) and use half the amount of cinnamon.  Also, I would consider using a little more milk to make it a little creamier.

The horchata was great my kids loved it! I made a double batch and used on cup of sugar and it was a bit sweet so next time Ill cut back on it alittle. I did use cinnamon sticks in and blended them with the rice instead of the ground cinnamon.

Perfect! A little bit too much cinnamon for me, so I used substantially less. But everything else was spot on, and perfect directions, as well!

Wonderful! I decided to heat the milk and blend it with the cinnamon. I chilled the milk mixture while the rice was soaking. The hubby loved it so much!

This tastes great! After u let the cinnamon steep (i used grounded), just let it rise to the top , scoop it out and the next layer is nice and pure and flavorful!

This is a wonderful recipe....i've found a easier way to make it....blend the uncooked rice and cinnamon in a blender till it reaches a powder-like consistency..then add the milk & however much sugar you desire...stir and add ice..viola!

I also doubled this recipe, and instead of using ground cinnamon, I instead use cinnamon sticks and and let it sit overnight to give it a rich flavor.  Very Tasty!

This was quite good, very much like the horchata we've had at  the local taqueria; very well-flavored.  I would suggest grinding the rice first, then adding the water, however.

YUM YUM YUM i love horchata!  This is a great basic recipe. A few things you can do to add more flavor is add the cinnamon earilier and also blend some almonds or other nuts with the rice and let them soak too.

LOVED IT! :) Let it sit for 3 hours exactly and it came out perfectly, I only used 1/2 of what the recipe asked to use for the cinnamon. Turned out sooooo lovely. I'm very impressed with the results. First time my man had it and he loved it! :)) Will be making again forever and ever!

this recipe makes a small amount. i did tweak the recipe a little.if you have trouble getting ground cinnamon to mix in, try blending it up with the rice and water, or mixing it with the sugar. i boiled half the rice, water and cinnamon after it sat for 5 hours. that gave it a stronger flavor. but overall it came out great!

I live in Los Angeles and have tried this in all forms from ready-made packaged versions, to restaurants, to homeade and this has got to be by far the worst I've had. While I did enjoy the lightness of it I do believe that REAL HORCHATA does not call for actual milk. You might want to substitute evaporated milk instead. Needless to say, I wont be trying this again.

I've since made it with white rice and dare I say I preferred the taste with the brown rice.  Also, I used the cinnamon sticks and just blended them in the beginning with the rice in the blender.  Delish!

This recipe is very good. I have a small blender, so blended just 1 cup rice with 2 cups water, put the mixture into the pitcher and added the remaining water. I used 1 cup milk (really tastier) and used just 1/3 cup sugar and more cinnamon. Very delicious!

This was much better tasting than I thought it might be.  It's like drinking rice pudding.  This went so fast at our party that I wished I made more.  The bottom of the pitcher was a lost glassful due to the spices and rice bits at the bottom.  We used brown rice instead of white rice and it was delicious.

After tweaking it a lot It has turned out to make a great horchata, but as is it isn't particularly great. There is too much cinnamon and since it is incorporated at the end it sits on the top creating a gritty dry layer. Also, it comes out very watery so I add a bit more milk and more sugar( I add a 1/2 cup to my triple batch-makes about a gallon). Cinnamon sticks make it really nice but if that is too much of a pain simply add it before you let it sit for 3 hours and it will soak into the mixture and the excess dregs will stick to the rice when you pour it through the strainer.

I doubled the recipe and found it delicious.  

I read the many reviews and eliminated what I saw to be the biggest concern...,floating cinnamon, by boiling a stick in the teapot. Made the house smell festive and no floaties.

Thank you for the recipe.

Very tasty!  I made a few changes based on what we had in the pantry- brown jasmine rice instead of white, 1/4 cup simple syrup instead of sugar and 3 small cinnamon sticks instead of ground. I added the cinnamon sticks to the rice water combination (as the video for this recipe recommends) and let it sit in the fridge overnight. Strained in the morning, served that evening. I love the cinnamon flavor!  Overall, it's a nice light and refreshing beverage.

Yum!!! I took the advice of others and used used cinnamon sticks in lieu of ground, I threw the rice and 2 cups of water and the cinnamon sticks in my ninja blender to blend the rice then added remaining water, let it sit 24 hrs in the fridge, used simple syrup to replace the sugar (easier to blend)  and it's amazing!!  The cinnamon taste is so subtle and it's not overly sweet, thank you Lola for sharing this!!

I took Serena's advice and added more rice and changed up the recipe a little. I used Jasmati rice, which gave the horchata a slightly floral hint in the undertones, plus I put in ground cinnamon instead of the cinnamon sticks. Throughout the time it sat out at room temperature, I would periodically pulse the blender and mix everything back up again. When it was done, I put it through a Greek yogurt strainer, which got out quite a bit of the excess cinnamon so it wasn't so sludgy on the bottom. I also used extra vanilla (probably 2 or 3 tablespoons) and more milk. Next time I'm going to try cardamom in the mix to see what that does. :)

I made this for my family and everyone loved it!  I actually ran out and covertly replaced it with some Kern's Boxed Horchata.  My oldest daughter  (6) tasted it (the Kern's) and said "Eww - this doesn't taste good".  But my wife couldn't tell the difference.  I really liked it too.  Excellent rice and cinnamon flavor.  The vanilla and milk set this recipe apart from other recipes.  However, I modified the recipe a little:
Used 1 c. of water with the 1c of rice in the blender.
I added a cinnamon stick to the blender and omitted the ground cinnamon.  
I added 3 more cups of water (not 4) once pulverized.
I stirred it up and let it soak overnight and all day in the fridge. 
I added 1/2 c. sugar and mixed it in.
I didn't have a cheesecloth so I just used two bowls to drain off the rice water, preserving the water and throwing away the stuff left in the bottom.  I repeated this step 4 times.  I noticed some sugar in the crud so maybe next time I will add the sugar later.  
I increased the milk to 1 c.
Added 1/2 t. vanilla and served over ice.
I only got about 2 cups of horchata (before milk) from my 4c. of rice water, but maybe I would have had more if I had used a cheesecloth.  No rice grit in the final product.  Very smooth and rich.

I found this version to be very heavy-handed on the cinnamon, and it did not strain well at all. It formed a sludge that clogged up the cheese cloth, reducing the flow to a dribble. I'd probably try reducing the cinnamon down to a half teaspoon or so, and soaking roughly pre-ground rice in water for a longer period. The only other home-made horchata I've tried so far is David Lebovitz's adapted version from Paletas, found on his blog(verdict: a little on the sweet side, but otherwise delicious and without the same problems as this recipe).

Delicious when left to soak overnight and strained the next day. The quality of vanilla really makes or breaks this beverage--it is wonderful with a good vanilla, but worthless without vanilla or a cheap vanilla. My son calls this "special milk".

Really good!  Followed a reviewer's suggestions and blended the cinnamon sticks with the rice and water, and cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup (which was plenty, and I like sweetness).

This recipe was perfect! The others I've read seemed too time consuming and fancy. I just wanted what I could get at a typical cheap and fast taqueria and imagined they didn't want to take 8+ hours for a batch. This came out soooo good! Just as I remembered from the magical first try over a decade ago :) Thanks Lola!

We like this, especially when adding a shot of rum to it! One of us is diabetic so we used soy milk and Splenda and it was just as tasty. The only problem I encountered was that I don't have a blender. I used my food processor and it made a terrible mess! Not deep enough I guess. I also cut back on the cinnamon just a titch, but that's a personal preference thing. Yummy.

Followed a previus reviewers advice and Added the rice and 2 cups of the water to the food processor then slowly added the rest of the water. Then placed in the fridge overnight. Next day....I used two cinnamon sticks..I added almost 2 cups of milk and used homemade vanilla sugar to sweeten. My family inhaled this horchata. So dang good.

Fun to make with the kids. They like using a blender. We let sit for 5 hrs. before mixing milk ++. Must shake well. Next time I will use less cinnamon. Just start slow with the adding to your taste. Makes 1 qt.

First up, I'd just like to say that this is a fantastic recipe. However, there is one thing I'd change, and that's the amount of cinnamon used. 1/2 Tablespoon is WAY too much. I used 1/2 a teaspoon, mixed it up in the blender, and scooped off the excess cinnamon.

I blended rice in my coffee grinder. I soaked 3 cinnamon sticks in the rice water mixture, rather than using ground cinnamon. I just removed the sticks before straining the rice water through a coffee filter set inside the top of the pitcher. I also added evaporated milk (less than half a can) per other reveiwers' suggestions since I used non-fat milk.

This recipe was the first one Ive ever used to make horchata. I think I'll stick with it. It is very close to the horchata I grew up with. If you want an authentic taste, this is it.

This is AWESOME! I have been trying to find a good recipe. I have made this SEVERAL times. Each time everyone LOVES it. It doesn't last more than a day. I double the recipe and only use about a little over half the sugar and I use more milk. I also put a generous amount of Vanilla. SUPER YUMMY!

great recipe.  if you mix the sugar and cinnamon together first before adding liquids there will be no lumping and the cinnamon will be well blended.  mix the cinnamon and sugar together add vanila then add milk and mix before adding to the rice water

I made it using the exact measurements but ran my rice through the blender. After the soak, I double-strained the batch. It is perfectly sweet as is (or a bit less) but I think it needs a lot more cinnamon.

I followed another posters hint about using canned milk, and it made a thicker drink, which I enjoyed more than the second time when I used regular milk.  Also, I cut the sugar down a bit.  Not much.  

Thanks so much for posting this one!  :)

This recipe is a very great starter. I reduce the water to 4 cups, increase the rice to 1 1/2 cups, add two cinnamon sticks, and let it sit in the fridge for at least 4 hours. After straining I add 1/2 c. of half and half and 1/2 c. of milk. Very refreshing!!!!

This tastes just like the horchata from our local family-owned Mexican restaurant!

Just a couple tips, though.

Use a broken up cinnamon stick, not ground cinnamon. Let that set in the rice water mixture after blending.

After straining the rice water and adding all the ingredients, throw the cinnamon stick in the pitcher with the horchata and let sit in the fridge over night. (This way you get a good cinnamon hint from the cinnamon stick soaking)

Be sure to shake or stir before pouring.

Serve over ice.

Easy Recipe! Tastes Great.
I made a couple minor changes.
1. I added 1tbs condensed milk.
2. I put half a cinnamon stick in the water/rice while it soaked, at the end i removed the stick, and added half the called for cinnamon.
3. I double the recipe.
4. After 4 hours or so of soaking, I blended the mix, and let soak an additional hour or two.
(its hard to get a fine blend with hard rice)

Tastes great with dinner! And all of the "mexicans" approved! lol

If you follow the recipe as written, you get a pretty good result. I also had a problem with the cinnamon floating on top. 

The second time around, I boiled the water with cinnamon and vanilla, then blended it with the rice. I strained the rice mixture through a cheesecloth, used 1/2 cup sugar, and switched the milk with evaporated milk for a creamy texture. Perfect!

Thanks a bunch for this recipe!

this recipe is a nice one,
but instead of adding the rice 
and water sep. when you let it soak, 
blend the cinnamon with the rice.
i use a coffee grinder, works great.
use a little more milk than they suggest.

This horchata is great! Just like our favorite Mex. place. We only used 1/4 C sugar and blended the rice so much that it just settled to the bottom of the blender after 3 hours and did not need straining lucky for us beacuase we didnt have a fine enough strainer or cheese cloth oops. Will be making this for my daughters Daisy troop this week!

Never having tried horchata, I had no idea what we were in for. :) I pulsed the uncooked rice in my Magic Bullet chopper for a couple seconds and then soaked it in the 5 cups of water with 2 cinnamon sticks for five hours. I strained out the rice and cinnamon stick (and used it for rice pudding as recommended by another reviewer!), added around 3/4 cup milk, 2 tsp vanilla, and 1/3 cup sugar. It sat in the fridge for another hour or so, and it was great with Mexican Lasagna! It tasted kind of like super-yummy soy milk. I'll make it again, it's a nice change from Kool-Aid or pop! Thanks for sharing, Lola!

This was pretty good, but not quite the texture I was looking for. COSTA RICAN RECOMMENDATION: I had this while I was in Costa Rica and I think next time I'll do the following changes: Bring the rice and water to a boil together with a cinnamon stick and turn it off. Blend this (without the cinnamon stick) and then strain it. Add the sugar, vanilla and let it sit overnight with the cinnamon stick and some cloves. In the morning I would add the milk and call it good! Oh, I also used 1/2 cup of sugar. I'm going to try this again without boiling it, but will also try the boiling method. Also, will try this with barley too. :)

This was great, I had no problems at all making this. It’s just the 3 hours you have to wait, sometimes I would do 1 hour and 30 minutes and it’s fine. I would definitely make it again.

This is amazing, just read a few of the tweaks to get an idea on how to riff on the original recipe. Do not use powdered cinnamon. I would not use the full amount of sugar.

I made this tonight exactly as the instructions suggested. It was very yummy but I also love my horchata to be creamy and thicker than the original recipe. I ended up adding more milk until I was satisfied with the taste. I will definitely make this again but next time I’m going to take a few of the other suggestions. I plan to use cinnamon sticks instead of ground cinnamon. I’ll let the sticks and rice water soak overnight in the frig. Also I plan to use a can of evaporated milk to increase the creaminess. I’ll review again to compare once I’ve tried it with a few tweaks.

I just made this. I let the rice sit overnight in the fridge and followed the recipe. I think 1/2 tablespoon of cinnamon is way too much and suggest cutting back to 1/2 teaspoon. You can always add more after it's served if you'd like. I ran it through cheesecloth to remove the rice particles before adding the milk, etc., and again to remove so much cinnamon.  The wife and I enjoyed the flavor and will make this again using less cinnamon.

We made this almost exactly to recipe except 1/2 cup sugar, 2t cinnamon and vanilla (whole, organic, lactose-free milk).   We also soaked whole jasmine rice for almost 24 hours before blending. and immediately straining.  My husband and two kids (9&11) all loved it and suggested no suggestions.  I found it good, but feel with the sweetness of the jasmine rice could hold up even less sugar.  I'll try 1/3 cup next time.  Maybe a pinch of salt and a dash of nutmeg? Or soak a handful of almonds with the rice?

I made this, and although it’s a decent recipe, the flavor was a little overpowering. I’ve yet to make it again, but I think it would fair much better with half of the vanilla extract used, as it was what hit me in the face, so to speak, the first time I tried it. I also noticed that all the cinnamon sank to the bottom when I refrigerated it, and when remixed, simply gave it a brownish color that was a little offsetting. I read other reviews that said that they soaked cinnamon sticks with the rice, so perhaps that is something I will try next time as well. The recipe is promising, just a little strange for what I (personally) consider good horchata.

This is one of my favorite things to order, when I can find it. I did make one huge change, I like mine very creamy so I added 2 cups of milk. That may be too much for most, for us it was perfect. Will make again and again.

Delicious!  Per recommendations, I ground up the rice prior to soaking and used a cinnamon stick while it brewed overnight.  It was delicious but really didn't make a lot.  Next time I'll make a double batch.

I’ve had my fair share of Horchata throughout restaurants, and I must say, WOW! This horchata is absolutely amazing. This recipe is so easy, so cheap and makes a ridiculous amount of drink to share with family and friends. Many people here are complaining about the cinnamon either floating on the top or sinking to the bottom, and to that I say, “STIR THE DANG THING!”

I used powdered cinnamon because I am out of sticks.  My next batch will be with sticks and there might be less sediment at the bottom.  We'll see.  It tasted great. Very refreshing.

I served this at a Girl Scout Cinco de Mayo party. The girls loved it, but I would cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup (or maybe less) next time.  I also tripled the recipe for the party (and rounded up the cinnamon and vanilla to 2 tablespoons).

A tip: I microwaved the cinnamon and sugar in a bit of the rice water to help it dissolve better.

Thanks for the recipe! I'll be making it again! :o)

This is an amazing recipie. I see comments like the cinnamon didn’t mix well and my recommendation is to mix the cinnamon with the vanilla extract in a small bowl then add it to the rice water mix with a spatula. Works perfectly. I love this recipie and will definitely make it again.

Absolutely delicious, and super easy! My girlfriend grew up drinking Horchata at a local taqueria (which closed years back), but hadn’t had it in a long time. Since we had all the ingredients, I decided to give it a stab. She took one drink and said it tasted exactly like she remembered from the taqueria! The only change made was to sub out the milk for full fat coconut milk. It made it even richer and creamier and dairy free (she’s lactose intolerent). The texture is really something special, I think. It was definitely worth it to make homemade rice milk than it buy it at the store.

Didn't have the rich mouth fill that I like horchata to have.  Added some sweetened condensed milk and it was a lot better. Though, if adding sweetened condensed milk reduce your sugar.

It was too sweet for my taste,  I needed to add a lot of milk (about a cup more) just to die down the sweetness...I suggest starting with 1/4 cup white sugar then add as needed :)

I made it according to instructions without the reviews. I didn't have a problem with the cinnamon, but it was way too sweet, perhaps "sickeningly". I recommend reducing the sugar from 2/3 cup or/and adding more milk. 

I've never heard of horchata in New Zealand, but I could definitely taste the ricey, cinnamony, vanilla flavor this is supposed to be, and I liked it. I might make this again, with less sugar, a little more milk, and I'll give the cinnamon quills referenced in other reviews a go.

This turned out great! I soaked my rice and water overnight (at least 8 hours) and soaked it with 2 cinnamon sticks. I only added a sprinkle of ground cinnamon for looks but didn’t want to risk it just floating on the top like I had been told it would do. This recipe was a hit a Christmas and was better than any I had tried before!

This is a really good and really easy recipe. I made it for a holiday party I hosted and everyone liked it. I’d probably cut back on the will though. Made it a little too thick but that’s just personal preference. Some friends added Captain Morgan spiced rum to it and it was delicious. Probably about 50ml (the really small plastic bottles) to an 10oz glass or so.

Nice, because I haven't had horchata in a long time before making this.  Doesn't seem absolutely spot on compared to my memory, but certainly tasty and reminds me of it, and great for being nice and simple.  I'll have to try some of the suggestions.

I reduced the sugar to 1/2 c and followed the rest of the recipe. I found that ground cinnamon was very hard to incorporate. It kind of just floated to the top. I think maybe if I blended it extra long in the Vitamix afterward that might have helped. Others said use cinnamon sticks instead.

This tastes just like the horchata at our favorite Mexican place. I reduced the sugar by almost half and it still tastes great.

I made a double batch. I used 4 cinnamon sticks instead of powder, a can of evaporated milk instead of cup of milk. Reduced the sugar to a cup, instead of a cup and a half. Turned out really well.

I made this for my son who loves Horchata. I never knew how it was made. I followed the advice of a reviewer and added a cinnamon stick to the rice before blending. I let it sit for about 5 hours. He loved this and said it was better than the kind you get from the store. My daughter also tried it and she loved it as well. Great recipe and I will make it again. Easy and inexpensive for a cool drink on a summer day.

I liked this recipe; it was really easy. I added a little extra whole milk , it was just very sweet. Next time I think I will reduce it to a 1/2 cup of sugar and see how I like it. I am a fan of this recipe and i will certainly make it again

I found this recipe because I really wanted to recapture the taste of restaurant quality horchata and with some fiddling I found it. Like others, I would recommend adding 2 cinnamon sticks into the blender, it definitely infuses the rice water with more flavor. If you're looking for that restaurant quality taste I'd add about 1 - 1 1/2 cup of milk. This recipe is a great base for finding that flavor you want.

This is a great basic recipe. The only tweaks I made to it was substituting Stevia for sugar and also let it stand overnight. I thought 3 hours was not enough and it turned out very creamy and foamy.

I made this recipe using all organic ingredients.  It has too much sugar to ever be called health food but it tasted wonderful.  It's a bit on the sweet side but my husband likes it that way so it was a hit.  I will make again.

I just had to add a little more ground cinnamon. My father in law is from Mexico and he grew up drinking Horchata and has high standards for it. He loved it.

I don't really like horchata but my daughter wanted some so I thought I'd give it a go. I used 4 cups of water, not 5. I added more milk, and I used the amount of sugar called for. It was delicious and super easy. The soaking takes time so plan ahead but it's very little effort for a great result.

So yummy! Followed the recommendations and used two cinnamon sticks and made a simple syrup with 1 c water and 2/3 c sugar instead of just adding the sugar to the room temperature mixture. Next time I will make rice pudding with the left over rice

this recipe was very delicious when I first made it. Instead of using the ground cinnamon I used half a cinnamon stick and put it in the blender and put the other half just to soak in the rice water, also you might want to make it more thick  by putting less water and a bit more milk. Have fun!

It was a bit time consuming to make.  
We put in 1/2 of the sugar, and it made this drink very refreshing.

It was super sweet when I made it so to change it I would put 1/2cup of sugar instead of 2/3 and 1cup of milk instead of 1/2cup. Finally I would add a cinnamon stick in the water and rice mixture to make it more cinnamony

Great recipe! I only had ground cinnamon, but it worked out great.  I'm making it again but think I'll dial back the amount of cinnamon just a little. Awesome horchata though.

This is super easy and delicious! I tripled the recipe since my big family loves horchata. Everyone loved it and I will definitely be making this again. Did not change a thing but considering almond milk for the next batch and maybe a hint less cinnamon. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

While my horchata turned out to be really delicious, I only gave this recipe 4 stars because it required some modifications for me. I'm lactose intolerant, so I used almond milk instead of regular milk - less thick, but super yummy (and healthier)! As suggested by other reviewers, I also blended 2 cinnamon sticks in with the rice and I can really taste the cinnamon without the annoying floaties. I also substituted  1/4 cup of agave for the sugar, and it turned out to be a good amount, though I think I could even go with a little less next time (I prefer things to be a bit less sweet in general). Overall, good recipe. Will definitely make again soon!

Wish it was a bit more thick and a lot less cinnamon. A little tweet and this was just fabulous! My husband is Mexican and I have never cooked nor had Mexican food. But this was hands down so easy and hubby really enjoyed it :)

This is alright. The soaking method is decent, but the recipe is EXTREMELY sugary (if you like that, then go right ahead). So I had to add like two cups more of milk. After that, it tasted good. Also, you need to add the cinnamon during the soaking period, not afterward, if you want the cinnamon to be completely blended into the horchata.

This was my first try at making my own horchata and it tasted great.   I used a can of evaporated milk  to give it a richer flavor.   The cinnamon didn't blend well at first but I used a wire whisk to break it up and blend.  I don't mind the color as I know it's the cinnamon.

Easy and very good. It was quite sweet, but can be toned down depending on how much ice you serve it over. A shot of vanilla vodka or carribean rum is also very good in it.

I Love this recipe! I made some changes after I read the reviews the original recipe calls for 5 cups of water, However I added 4, and once I strained the water and added a full cup of milk instead of half.  As for the sweetness of the Horchata, I'd say start with 1/3 cup and add gradually what you want. I like mine sweet so I'd say I added approximately a cup-ish. However flavor it to your own taste. I plan on sharing this with my friends family.

I followed Serena's changes, which turned out a yummy horchata! For my own taste preference I'll add more cinnamon, which, for now, can actually be quickly solved by a few shakes of cinnamon on top -- next time I'll add 2 more cinnamon sticks, though. And I'll try totaling the rice to be 1 1/2 c. (instead of 1 1/3 c.). Excellent drink!

This was OK. I used 2 1/2 cups of milk and the rest water and used half of the cinnamon while blending and the rest for decorating. What I always do is soaking the rice in water for some hours and them blend them together. I let the mix rest and then blend again after some hours.

I've never made a rice milk before let alone heard of horchata. I had all the ingredients on hand so I thought I would give it a try. Simple to make and the cinnamon flavor was very pleasing.

Easy to make and tastes very similar to the horchata that I like from my favorite Mexican food restaurant. When I gave my BF a drink he said it tasted like liquid rice pudding. :) I did have issues with the cinnamon sinking to the bottom so next time I may follow some of the tips from other reviewers to prevent this.

This is amazing! Tastes just like the stuff you find at Cafe Rio! I got away with using short grained rice, and it turned out just fine. The more flavorful you want it, the longer you let it soak. ;)

So good! I may have added a bit too much sugar, so I think I'll cut back slightly next time. Also, I didn't discard the remaining rice, I cooked it and made a rice pudding that was equally delicious.

Iade this but I read other reviews and added 1/2 cup of sugar instead and added double the milk. It was still very sweet but I liked it. And next time I make it I will soak cinnamon sticks instead because the powder doesn't like to mix since cinnamon doesn't dissolve really. But I did like how the recipe was so simple. Husband wasn't crazy about it.

I made it exactly how the recipe says. Only changes I will make next time is let the rice sit for at least 5 hours not 3. You just don't get the full rice flavor horchata is suppose to have after only 3 hours.

Yumm!  Used 1 1/3 rice 
& 2 cinnamon sticks & soaked it overnight, then proceeded with recipe.  The only thing U really did differently was that I blended it again near the end, and blended in the sugar too.  o problem with undissolved sugar or straining.

Excellent overall recipe, though your best bet is to do 1 cup of Milk instead of 1/2, due to making it a bit thicker, it'll absorb the cinnamon a bit better. In all honesty, you gotta try it. It's an easy, quick, honest-to-goodness foolproof recipe if you follow it to the letter.

Thank you so much for posting this recipe! I moved from California to Scotland and there is no chance I'll find horchata unless I make it. I actually ran to the store and bought a juice jug that fits my refrigerator door just so I can make a tripple recipe and keep it chilled. I intend on drinking this everyday for months! It's so delicious!

I too followed the suggestions made by Serena and we loved this Horchata for Cinco de Mayo.  It doesn't make a lot so if you want your guests to enjoy a tall glass with ice, double the recipe.

I used 1/2 the sugar. I made a horchata chai tea just by simmering some on the stove and then steeping a tea bag in it for about 5 minutes. Yummy! A friend tried some and asked for the recipe.

This recipe is perfect!!!I used half a cup of half and half in place of milk and then added a can of evaporated milk. It came out delicious!! It's rich, creamy and refreshing. Tastes just like the Horchata I grew up drinking in Mexico :)!!

My son loves Horchata.  His Spanish class (4th grade) made it one day and he didn't like so he volunteered to bring some in.  We searched for a recipe...decided on this one and it was a HIT!!  All his classmates loved it.  Thank you!

This recipe was flavorful and refreshing. As stated in the video, using cinnamon sticks will greatly improve this recipe for the ground cinnamon tends to rise or fall after about 5 minutes and the flavor is intensified by the fusing of flavored from the whole sticks. I personally added less sugar (about half a cup) just because the 2/3 cups was a bit too much for me. This was an overall great recipe that always left me smiling.

This was my first shot at making Horchata and I absolutely loved it! This recipe is amazing, simple and delicious. A friend introduced the great drink to me at one of our local taco shops and I fell in love with it on the spot, I'm glad I have a fun and easy way to make it at home with my son now. Thank you for sharing!

My daughter, the horchata fan in the family, loved this! I made mine with double the milk, since I used FF, and when I ground up the rice (1/2 brown and 1/2 white because that's what I had) in the blender I also added 2 large cinnamon sticks in lew of the ground cinnamon (I doubled the entire recipe to make a gallon) and added a few (maybe 7-10?) whole allspice. Next time I'll add probably 2 more cinnamon sticks, since I can't get enough. But my daughter loves it as is. And I just topped off the pitcher with water. Oh and I used 1c of Splenda in place of the sugar. Thank you for this recipe! Now I'm making rice pudding with the strained rice/spice mix!

very interesting, made it in the evening and tasted in the morning, was very surprised! although I made just 1 big glass and substituted the milk with 10% cream it was worth it. I am going to make  a bigger portion now for my friend to visit me. The taste reminded me of tapioca pearl in Coconut milk.

I made this for my boyfriend who is crazy about horchata. He loved it! I prefer to use cinnamon sticks to flavor while the rice soaks just because I don't like the floating pieces. Amazing recipe though, thank you! (FYI don't use cinnamon sticks from stores that leave them out in the air. Wasted multiple pitchers to those sour sticks! I'd advise getting air sealed ones if possible.)

I did what a few reviewers did and ground my rice in a coffee grinder then blended it with 2 sticks of cinnanon. We also changed out 1 cup water for 1 cup 2% milk because we like ours 'creamier'. The trick to getting full-flavor horchata FASTER is to mix the milk and vanilla in with the ground rice when it sits overnight then strain and add in 1/3 cup sugar (2/3 was waay too much).

Well this was an interesting recipe and fun to try... I added the cinnamon to the rice in the blender to flavor the water but strain it clear... It did seem to work and it come out clear... I ended up adding a little extra milk and cutting back on the sugar.. It did seem to turn out good though... Who would have thought to make a drink from rice....

I've tried horchata in Mexican restaurants, and I LOVED it! I've been trying to find a good recipe for it, and so far, this one is the best! I added a little more milk for it to come out thicker, but you can adjust it to your taste and it'll still be delicious. Great recipe, thanks for sharing. Delish!

Really good. I now always add a cinnamon stick when I blend the rice, so the cinnamon doesn't float to the top. Like another reviewer said, it's really yummy to add a can of evaporated milk to make this more creamy (in substitute of same amount of milk). I tripled the recipe, which made about 1 gallon.

I love good horchata and was thrilled to find this highly rated recipe. I made my first batch yesterday. It was "OK" but I didn't think it was "great." Just not a lot of flavor, and pretty watery. I even took others advice and made a syrup with the milk, sugar and last bit of water.

I really liked this recipe. I usually only have Horchata at Mexican restaurants and from a package. I never knew it was so easy to make homemade Horchata!

This comes out plenty good enough, but I think there could be a few refinements to make the texture and flavor a bit more pleasing.  I think that the rice should probably be cracked in a grinder (mortal & pestle, or a mill or something) and then soaked overnight to really get all of the 'milk' out.  Don't forget, there really isn't much to this drink, so it really depends on the highest quality vanilla and cinnamon.  Note: This recipe fits my home blender just right, but it doesn't seem like a big batch when you've got it in your glass.  It might be nice to double the rice in 1/2 of the water and try to get a bigger batch out of it that way. Maybe not... ;)

Made this twice so far. The first time was better because I did a few things differently. I made about 3 times more than the recipe asked for to get it to about 4 qts to fill 2 pitchers. The second time I didn't blend it but I let it soak overnight. The first time I used as much ground cinnamon as a cinnamon stick. Which is about 1/2 teas. per 6 servings. 1/2 tablespoon is way too much. Also, the second time around I used a different brand of vanilla... it was way overpowering. I tried to salvage it by diluting it with water and milk. Next time I make it I will add a little vanilla at a time and taste it and use less cinnamon too.

This drink was very good but it turned out a light brown and not white. A lot of the ground cinnamon floated to the top. Very good will make again.

Very nice and refreshing.  I added just a little more milk than it calls for, and half a can of evaporated milk I had leftover.  I think I 5x's the recipe.  I probably drank about half of it.  I just love horchata.

This recipe is ok.  I will did follow the other reviews and added cinnamon sticks to the rice and water in the blender.  However, I found that it needed the actual measurement of sugar the recipe calls for (depends on your level of sweet that you like) and that it just seemed too watery.  I added 1/2 cup of milk more at a time, stirring after each addition, until I got it about where I thought it was somewhat close the restaurant).  I will keep playing with the measurements of this recipe and see how it goes in the future.

The recipe was really good, but I should have taken in account the advice about the cinnamon.  it either floats to the top, or turns chunky throughout the drink.  I will be revising the recipe, and let you all know how it turns out :)

This is a good recipe, but I don't think I like it quite as much as store-bought horchata.  The main issue I have is with the cinnamon - it tends to sink to the bottom of the glass so the last sip is kind of sludgy.  I'll try cinnamon sticks next time as other reviewers have suggested.  I also increased the milk to about 3 cups (mainly because I wanted to use the rest of the carton) and decreased the sugar slightly, but I don't think those changes had a negative effect.

This recipe was great!! I never knew i could recreate one of my favorite drinks from the nearby mexican restraunt. I also followed what others said when making the recipe. When grinding up the rice, i only used 2 cups of the water and i added 2 cinnamon sticks and grinded it up, then added the remaining water and grinded it some more. I usually let it set out about 8 hours, strain it through a mesh strainer, then add the rest of the ingredients, minus the ground cinnamon and refridgerate till its cold!! It dosen't make much, so you have to double or even tripple the recipe to get a decent amount. I've made this recipe 3 times already now!! WONDERFUL

Really liked the Horchata, i did not use milk and i used cinnamon sticks when it was soaking for three hours. I liked it so much i tried to rush the soaking by waiting only an hour, but it did not taste the same. I also soaked it over night but it did not make to much of a difference to the three hour. :D thanks

Very good recipe to the tee.  I once was at a local Mexican taco shop and I got a peek in the back at teh ladies making horchata. I saw them so busy with the can openers opening cans of "CONDENSED MILK." I substituted that for regular milk and it makes the horchata a little creamier.  Oh, and buy the way three sticks of cinnamon soaking with the rice water for 3 + hours gives it a good taste. I put all my rice water and cinnamon back into the blender and mixed it. Perfect.

This was so good I did use the cinammon sticks like other reviewers suggested and it came out perfect for my taste.
