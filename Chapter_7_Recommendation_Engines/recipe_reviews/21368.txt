I made a variation of this recipe , sausage ,diced potatoes , and a small amount of chopped onion and peppers all cooked together in my favorite cast iron skillet. When everything is cooked , break 4 or 5 eggs over the whole mess ,stir together while the eggs cook. Then spoon into the tortilla and top with mexican blend cheese.

We've been making breakfast burritos for years. We make a huge batch on Sunday (without beans, & with different breakfast meats), wrap in plastic wrap, & then freeze. The kids or hubby can grab, heat for 30-45 secs, & go. Perfect for those days when you're running late!!

There's nothing like a breakfast burrito when you need something that's easy and great for "on the go". I cut way back on the servings as I only needed two. I scrambled the eggs vs. frying and used a Mexican cheese blend. Overall, very tasty served wtih salsa on the side.

This was alright, although, it could've been better if you tweaked it a bit.  To make less dishes, I cooked this all on one skillet.  First the bacon, removed it, added the eggs to the same skillet and when the eggs were cooked, crumbled the bacon in the skillet and added the beans and 1/2 the cheddar.  I felt it needed more oomph, so I added some hotsauce to the mixture and heated it through.  Spooned the mixture into each shell, wrapped it up, added the rest of the cheese to the shell to seal the ends tight, then cooked it over the skillet for a nice and crunchy burrito.

These burritos were excellent!  I added a little bit of salsa to the beans to make them spicier, and easier to spread.

This is a tasty, quick breakfast...although I did make it for dinner!  If it needs more flavor try the spicy refried beans.  And don't skimp when it comes to putting the items on the tortilla.  It tastes so much better when you put 2 slices bacon, and slather on the beans.  I cooked the bacon in the oven (I like crispy cooked bacon) and made the eggs scrambled.  Then I put all ingredients on tortilla and rolled then stuck in microwave to melt cheese/heat through.  I did serve it with salsa, but when you slather the beans and 2 slices of bacon I didn't need the extra flavor of the salsa.  I will make this again.  Thank You!

Very easy to make! I left out the refried beans since my kids don't care for them too much and added some diced chiles to the eggs to give it a kick. These are SOOOOO MUCH cheaper to make then getting them from the McDonalds Drive thru for sure!!Very easy to wrap too when you use the 10 inch wraps. Be sure to give this one a try! Thanks Janina!!!

Pretty good with a few changes, for personal taste.  I scrambled the eggs, left out the beans, can't imagine beans and egg.  I used crumbled bacon, added lots of chopped onion, salt and pepper.

This was great for a change.  Next time I will use less of the refried beans.  My husband & I both thought the beans overpowered the taste of the other ingredients.

A great change from the typical egg sandwich.  I used veggie bacon or veggie sausage in mine.

These taste great with just black beans.  I like to put my burrito together, then grill it on my george foreman grill, it hold the tortilla together and adds a crispiness that is so yummy!  Kids love it on the way out the door to school!

This is a good recipe to fill people up. I thought it was interesting to have refried beans in a breakfast burrito, but it was delicious! I will definitely be making it again. Good with a side of hashbrowns and fresh fruit!

I am rating this five stars because you got three VERY picky children to eat and LIKE this!!! It was very good! I was actually surprised that the refried beans went well with the bacon and eggs. Something nice for a quick and easy meal when daddy isn't home!

Nom nom nom...reviewing while eating :) These were pretty good! I used Mexican cheese blend and only folded my tortillas because I only had small ones. I added salsa verde to my "burritos" and that made it even better! The combination of eggs and beans might seem strange to some, but that's how many people eat their breakfast tacos in Mexico. Give it a try!

Quite delicious and holds you for a while! We scrambled our eggs and loved it with taco sauce.  Using wheat tortillas was tough - it would tear as we tried to wrap it, so we stuck with the flour tortillas.  Might try the zesty refried beans next time - this time we used fat free and it was great in addition to the taco sauce.

We've been making our own variation of this for a couple years now.  I saw the recipe this morning and wanted to suggest using a can of diced tomatoes with chilies and some black olives.  A dollop of sour cream never hurts either.

INCREDIBLE TOGETHER.  PLEASANT SURPRISE.  I DID NOT USE ANY BACON --TRYING TO CUT BACK ON FAT/CALORIES.  JUST OPENED THE FAT FREE REFRIED BEANS AND ADDED DROP OF OLIVE OIL AND SAUTEED THEM/ADDED BEANS TO THIS WITH SPRINKLE OF CHILIPOWER/CAYENNE PEPPER AND HEATED WELL.   HEATED TORTILLA IN MICROWAVE WITH MEX CHEESE AND SPREAD BEANS ON TORTILLA AND ADDED SCRAMBLED EGG BEATERS--REALLY GOOD AND FULL OF PROTEIN AND LOWER FAT.    VERY FILLING AND SATISFYING.    GREAT TREAT!!! THANKS FOR THE RECIPE.

These were great and I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I did add salsa and wrapped each individually in foil and kept warm in the oven. The foil made them easy to hold and eat.  My whole family loved them.

These were amazing.  And fairly healthy.  I altered the recipe by adding scallions and  tomatoes to the inside of the burrito.  If using canned refried beans, I always add a little chicken broth or water, and cheese.  Makes them taste much better.  I topped these off with sour cream (lite), tomatoes more scallions, and a small amount of salsa.  Delicious!

These are so easy and delicious. I like how you dont even need a recipe. You can just add as little or as much as you want or use any kind of meat you have on hand. I make homeade salsa and refried beans from this site and then use leftovers for this recipe. I make extra so I can freeze them and reheat for a quick on the go breakfast for the kids.

I made this one for dinner (we do breakfast for dinner quite often) and even my ever-skeptical girlfriend was exceptionally pleased with how these turned out - and I even forgot to add the cheese the first time! I wrap the burrito in tin foil to keep it warm while you eat it (cold burritos can be nasty, especially breakfast burritos). Just peel it back as you devour the burrito. We used Soy Bacon instead of real bacon (we like the taste more), and I agree with one of the other reviews here: do NOT be stingy with the ingredients! Slather it on like this is the last meal you'll be eating for the week. It is VERY rewarding this way. Simple, cheap, and fun to eat.

I did as another person said and cooked everything in one pan. First the bacon, took it out, cooked the eggs. Then I added the bacon crumbled, beans, and cheese. I also put some pureed avacado in them. They are a pretty good twist for breakfast.

Great breakfast item for camping.  I made these at home, wrapped in foil, put in the cooler, then heated up on the grill.  Everyone loved them.  Would change them up a little next time, to add some spice.

Great base recipe, especially when looking for a breakfast idea! subbed in avocado slices for the bacon, gruyere cheese and extra spicy salsa. To those who complained of too many beans; use your common sense, and fill to personal preference. It's not difficult to gauge when there might be too much of a heavy ingredient.

This is a good base recipe.  We omit the beans and add hash browns for crunch.  We also like green sauce instead of salsa.  YUM!

In reviewing the recipe, I predicted flatness in the taste, so I added a tiny bit of garlic salt and chorizo (I excluded beans - personal preference).  Add homemade guacamole and sour cream and - bam!  What a yummy result!

This was quite a delicious flip on the average breakfast burrito...I did my own little variation with monteray jack cheese instead of cheddar, and added sauteed onions. They added a great texture to the delicious dish!

This was fast, easy, and tasted good. I used leftover Easter ham which was smoked and a bit sweet, and it turned out fine. This was a little bland and I topped mine with a generous amount of Tapatio brand hot sauce because I like it with a little kick. I cut this down to 1 serving, scrambled the egg, and used a Mexican cheese blend. Thanks, I enjoyed this meal.

Very bland as is. The beans didn't fit. We made 10 of these things and couldn't eat them. I would give a 0 star if I could

Very good! I made a couple changes though, I scrambled my eggs and I had to use shredded velveeta cheese because that was all I had. Turned out fantastic! I think next time I will experiment a little. I think some onions and green peppers maybe mushrooms cooked with the eggs would make this even better. I also wonder how mayo (instead of beans) would freeze? With the bacon, I didnt really think the beans were'nt  necessary with bacon. (Though good) I think one or the other (meat or beans)would be sufficient for this dish. These did not go over well with everyone when reheated the next day.

This burrito was amazing, and it actually filled me up! Although I didn't use the right size tortilla (accident) so it got a little hard to fold but it was still great!

These were fantastic burritos and I loved the addition of refried beans. You could certainly omit them and still have a fabulous recipe here, but they do add a little "something".  Thanks for sharing.

This was pretty good but I changed it up quite a bit.  I scrambled the eggs and added green onions, hot peppers, and spinach.  I used refried black beans, an aged white cheddar and a hot sausage.  It is great reheated for a quick b-fast.  Thanks for the start.

I have made this 4 times with either bacon or sausage and it comes out great either way. I have used salsa, sour cream and guacamole. My hubby loves Refried Beans so I use it and its really filling.. 
I am going to freeze some and see how they turn out that way.. Thanks for the recipe! :-)

Not bad at all! I made mine as written, but as Husband was going to eat his in the car on the way to work, I scrambled the eggs and crumbled the bacon. We both agreed it needs a little extra something - Husband said hot sauce, I said salsa - but they are still pretty tasty. Thanks, Janina!

We liked this a lot!  I've always made breakfast burritos with scrambled eggs, bacon and cheese.  Using refried beans and eggs over easy was something I had never thought about; it was wonderful!  My only change:  I left out the bacon and added some of my (hot) salsa.  Thanks for a great addition to our breakfast table!

I was the only one eating so I only made 1. I added a lttle beans to a tortilla, 4 sices microwaved bacon, 1 over hard egg and some mexican cheese. This was so good. Way better than an egg sandwhich. I really enjoyed the beans in the eggs. The best thing is that it only took me 4 min to prepare. Thats faster than going thru a drive thru.

I made these for my husband and I for Sunday brunch and we both found them to be mediocre.  I didn't have any refried beans, so we didn't use them, but they're pretty bland so they wouldn't have added much flavour.  I think I will try these again, and add some sauteed onions, red/green pepper and some hot sauce.  I think this would also be good if processed cheese were added to the eggs and heated to make the eggs creamy and cheesy.  We found that the sharp cheddar used didn't add a lot of flavour either.  The only other thing I did (as suggested by another reveiwer), was to close the burritos up at both ends and fry them in a little cooking spray (or butter).

I made these as is and thought they were pretty good.  I tried them first with turkey bacon and they were boring, then with real bacon, so that must've given them just enough more kick.  I like the idea of cooking everything together in the pan first and perhaps will try that next time, scrambling the eggs.  It did take two of them to really fill me.

We make this recipe once a month for about 40 students at the local alternative high school. We leave out the beans as not everyone is up for refritos first thing in the morning. I am trying it next time with hash brown patties instead, per a friend's recomendation.

Beautiful. Though I added some potatoes I'd cooked with thyme, some green chillis and diced onion. I chopped the bacon up and cooked everything in the same pan before adding the egg and scrambling it all together. Then make sure ya throw loads into that tortilla, top with lots of beans and loads of cheese. Mmmm

Very good. I usually put potatoes in my breakfast burritos, but the refried beans were a fantastic alternative. I made these once with fried eggs, and once with scrambled eggs. I definitely prefer the scrambled eggs. And I hate to admit it, but they taste really good with Kraft american cheese instead of cheddar.

The burritos were good but next time, I'll add more spices and lettuce.  It definitely needs some hot sauce.

Pretty good.  I added some green peppers, used sausage instead of bacon, and used less cheese.  I froze the burritos we didn't eat that evening and have had them for breakfast the past few days.  I topped the burritos off with salsa verde.  I'll make this again.

I like to ad cumin and chili powder to the refried beans.  Sautéed brown rice (leftover) and onions, and less refried beans do wonders.  I highly recommend using a little cooking spray or butter in a skillet and lightly frying 2 sides of the burrito before serving.

Excellent. Much better than my favorite fast food ones, too! I added a little salsa to this in one batch, and that was good, too.

These were really, really good - definitely one I'll file and repeat.  I used savory navy beans instead of refried beans because those are what I had, and they worked quite well.  I also added chopped fresh tomatoes because we like them.  Recommended!

I have a variation of the recipe.  You can use ground maple sausage instead of bacon (break up into small pieces when frying).  I use Busch's baked beans instead of refried beans.  It gives it more flavor and makes it less dry.  You can also scramble the eggs with american cheese.  Once in a while I will add in shredded hashbrowns for something different.  And I love sour cream so I always put that on mine (you can use salsa too if you like).

This was pretty good. I didn't use the beans, I spread low fat sour cream on the tortilla and crumbled the bacon on top, then added the egg. I didn't have any picante, but I will try that next time. Overall, it was pretty good.

Yummo. I didn't follow the recipe exactly so I could make one burrito. I used refried beans I made from scratch (I used a recipe from Allrecipes, Chef Johns), I used quesadilla cheese because I was out of cheddar, I made the fried egg in the microwave, I heated up precooked bacon, I used a homemade tortilla from the local Mexican bakery, and topped it with homemade hot sauce from the local Taco Shop. Almost as good as if I went to the Taco Shop.

This is very good, although the tortilla shells didn't quite work out. I think I will try taco shell to control the inside ingredients inside, and add a bit of flavor.

Breakfast burritos are as varied as your palate!!  There's a killer-diller taco stand where we live and they make theirs to a huge variety of tastes.... and for cheap.  I've made this recipe with mucho variations for years, no such thing as a bad one!  I loved the hint of making lots of them and putting them in the freezer to "nuke" later.

I have been making a variation of this for a couple of years now for my son, I do it all on my 36" griddle I cook a couple of pounds of ground sausage then I push it off to the side then I scramble 2 dozen XL eggs put that over to the side with the sausage then fry up a couple bags of frozen diced potatoes when all that is complete I pull everything back into the center of the grill fully mix all ingredients together and use a couple bags of Mexican or taco shredded cheese once thats melted I turn my grill off take 2 big packs of tortillas scoop a few TBSP. Of my mixture into the tortillas & wrap like a burrito then I wrap them individually in wax paper & place into freezer bags and freeze them all when I know for sure my son is going to want them for breakfast the night before I will take 2 out & put into freezer to defrost & when he's ready he microwaves them & breakfast is served if he's undecided or we forget to take them out no biggie it just takes a few minutes more but we defrost them for about 1 1/2 minutes & then full power for about 90 seconds.

Interesting to read the reviews - no beans, use black beans, no bacon, added sausage, hot sauce, various cheese options, add potatoes,  just right.....so many variations.    I make these and ALWAYS have in the freezer.     Just take out and pop in oven for 20 - 30 minutes - add some salsa and everyone has been over the top pleased.

I added some chunky salsa to the eggs and when I scrambled them . When you start to build the Burrito. I put a layer of refried beans then the scrambled eggs and salsa to the top of the beans, covered that with shredded Mexican cheese or cheddar and topped it with  finely chopped raw sweet onion's .and drizzled Taco Bells hot sauce over the fix-ins and roll it up for serving .
to the refried beans.WOW what a killer BB!  You can also trade out bacon for sauce links. That is really good also.

My change was to make just enough for a one person serving. I could have used the full recipe and froze the extras but I prefer my eggs done fresh right before I eat them. But this gave me another variation to use any leftovers from making a spanish meal to incorporate into breakfast.

This was very good but I did make some changes. I didn't have refried beans so used chili beans. After rolling them I put them in a casserole dish, covered with shredded cheddar and put in oven until cheese melted.   Then I had some tomato,onion, and avocado to use up so topped them with that and finished them off with the salsa (warmed). My husband loved them . We will definitely make again.

It was okay....The refried bean overwhelmed the rest of the dish, but if we tried a different flavor or brand and adjusted the amount it might be better.  We added bacon, but husband and I both thought the it needed to be cooked more than we typically cook it just to eat.  The slightly chewy bacon was not good in the wrap.  Also, make sure you get the grease off the bacon very well, or your wrap just tastes like oily refried beans.

What I like about this recipe is that you can add different thing's to it if wanted. My 4 year old thought it odd at first but came to love it. I didn't get to add bacon cause don't have any right now but will probably do next time. may also add a meat like ham or even steak would be good in this! Will have to make again!

It was super easy to make and it was delicious.  My boyfriend said that it was the best breakfast burrito he has ever had, and he is a very picky eater.  Instead of bacon, I used precooked sausages.  I will definitely make again!  Thanks!!!

Great basic recipe.  My favorite way to umph it up is to mix  salsa together with mashed sweet potatoes (you can get it canned if you're feeling lazy).  This is a great to sweeten it up and include salsa without having it drip out everwhere.  I also prefer it with fried eggs with a soft yolk.  Nothing better....   Yummmm.....

I think that they were pretty good but I think that the refried beans kind of overpowered the rest of the burrito!

Good recipe.  I forgot to get the refried beans at the store so I couldn't put them in.  I did have some salsa and sour cream that we put on before serving.  Very good; only thing I thought it needed was salt and pepper.

These are a staple in my house.  My hubby does not eat bacon, so I make his without.  We add La Victoria's Salsa Brava to these.  This makes them real spicy.

I made them with ranch-style beans since I forgot refried beans when grocery shopping. They turned out great. You might want to add chili powder to spice things up a bit (if you like spicy things, that is).
