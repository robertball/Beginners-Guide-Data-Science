You don't need extra flour.

I made these exactly as the recipe states and they turned out wonderfully.  Using a cookie dough scoop or spoon, spoon cookie dough into a medium shallow dish full of powdered sugar.  I can usually get 4-5 spoonfulls in at once.  Then, using another spoon, spoon powdered sugar in the bowl on top of the clumps of dough.  Use your fingers to roll the clumps in the powdered sugar and then place each onto the baking sheet.  Doing this I didn't get a single bit of chocolate on my hands and didn't have to revise the recipe.

I used a brownie mix that had the chocolate syrup to add to the mixture.

The powdered sugar is a MUST - it's what makes the cookie IMO.  I have gotten raves about these cookies and am asked to make them often.

These are great, and so super-easy. I omitted the chocolate chips, added 1/2 cup of sour cream and reduced the water by half. As a hint: I've tried several different brownie mixes and oddly, the best batches I've made were when I used the Walmart brand fudge brownie mix. Taste and texture were just perfect, whereas the other brands really couldn't compare. Strange, I know, but give it a try. :)

INGREDIENTS: Follow ingredients EXACTLY and cookies are great! PREP: Gave it 4 stars b/c prep needed tweaking.  I used a cookie scoop and chilled the dough overnight at others suggestion (worked like a charm).  Also if you gently flatten the tops with a solid spatula (a spatula without slits) abt halfway through baking time they look nicer when they're done. BAKE TIME:  I'd say bake time is probably more like 10-12 min. (normal to hot oven 10min bake time... maybe 12 min for slightly cooler oven) TIP: Telling when these are done is tough.  What i did was a spatula test.  If i tried to take them off of the sheet and it started to smoosh them i waited a little longer.  As soon as they are just set enough to be removed with a spatula without affecting their shape they are ready!  Hope this helps:)

My husband loved these! I honestly would have loved them more without the chocolate chips, but I am weird like that. I do have one tip for keeping them from spreading out too much: bake the cookies on parchment paper rather than a greased cookie sheet. They still come off smoothly but with rounded edges versus the flattened edges from the greased cookie sheet.

This rates 5 stars for taste.  However, using an 18.3 oz. package of fudge brownie mix, I had to add 2 1/2 cups of flour to get a batter which I could scoop and roll.  This made it a bit stiff so next time I'll only use 2 1/4 cups of flour (at 2 cups of flour, the batter was still too thin).  Also, I can't wait to try the recipe again and use raisins instead of chocolate chips.  Oh...with the addition of the flour, it made 67 cookies!  Terrific as I now have some to share!

I prefer a thicker cookie. So the one cup of all-purpose flour didn't cut it for me. I used 2 cups of all purpose flour. Because the batter was still pretty thin I put the batter directly on the baking sheet rather than "rolling" the batter in the confectioners sugar. After the dough drops were on the pan, I used my powdered sugar shaker to thoroughly coat the tops of the uncooked cookies. This allows the cookies to still have the crackle top without the mess of trying to "roll" thin batter in sugar. I also increased my baking time from 8-10 minutes to 16 minutes, turning the pan half way through. I hope these suggestions are helpful to you!

Very very good! This recipe was just what I was looking for. The chocolate chips make the cookie even better than I remember. The only advice I have it to chill the dough for at least 3 hours (or overnight, if possible) to make it easier to handle.

These were good, but I don't think they were worth the time, mess & effort involved.  I was so frustrated 1/2 way through I almost chucked the batter.  So bakers beware - this is a lot of work.  My advice is just make good ol' brownies!

These were delicious and easy. I had to add an extra 2/3 cup of flour to the dough so that I could shape and roll it. They turned out great!

I made these yesterday mostly as written.  I didn't have chocolate chips so I split the bowl of batter and made some with white chips and some with finely shopped walnuts.  The ONLY two suggestions I have are.....place the powdered sugar in a pie pan, the you can drop about 8 spoonfuls in and still have enough space to roll them in the sugar.  I used a spoon to sort of roll them.  I was hesitant at first thinking I should refrigerate the batter because it was so soft, but the rolled just fine in the powdered sugar.  I found they needed to bake just a tad longer...11-12 minutes, but I also used a silicon mat. 


I made about two dozen with out rolling them in sugar and they tasted just like a brownie.  The ones rolled in sugar were just a tad sweeter.

These taste exactly like brownies and were very messy to make.  Save yourself the hassle and just make regular brownies.

These are so easy and delightful to make! They were almost no work at all. I omitted the semisweet chocolate chips and baked them for 9 minutes. They were the perfect amount of chewiness! I kept a few for myself and gave some to friends. They were a hit!

This dough was incredibly difficult to work with.  I ended up adding at least another 1/4 cup of flour and trying to refrigerate the dough to make it easier, but it was a sticky, gooey mess.  After making one pan of these, I gave up.  I ended up baking the remainder of the batter in little cookie molds.  They are delicious, but so similar to a brownie, and not worth the extra work.

Tasty!  Several other reviewers have complained about the batter being difficult to roll.  It is sticky, but there is an easy technique that will make rolling it a cinch.  First, drop some cookie dough into a bowl containing the confectioner's sugar.  Scoop up some of the sugar with your fingers and sprinkle it on top of the dough.  Now pick up the sugar-coated dough and roll in your hands.  It won't be sticky any more.  I chose to flatten my cookies a bit before baking, and it made for a lovely presentation.  Update:  I took some of these cookies into work today.  My coworkers *devoured* them!  I'll definitely be making them again.

Can't eat just one!  These are so yum.  Dough was a bit tricky to work with, but will probably just add a bit more flour next time.  My daughter enjoyed helping with these.  Thanx!

Very easy to make.  I used a little more flour (about 1/3 cup) than called for and then put in fridge for 1/2 hour prior to baking.  Turned out fabulous and I had no problems rolling into balls.  Made sure to have plenty of powered sugar on hand.

These were sooo good.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because I had to add extra flour cuz it was too runny and I couldn't roll them in the sugar.  Otherwise, they tasted great!

I followed the recipe exactly, and these did not turn out as expected. The dough tasted heavenly, but once they were baked they were pretty bland and too hard for my taste. If you like a soft, chewy cookie (similar to a brownie) this is not the recipe for you.

I used the Ghiradelli Brownie mix.  It was VERY moist and hard to mix.  I would say you either need to make it in advance and let the dough sit in the fridge for a few hours or add a lot more flour.  I added more flour since I made these right before I needed to bring them.  They were okay, the whole prep thing was frustrating though because it was so sticky

The BEST! Super quick, super tasty, made with every day ingredients. I used milk chocolate chips. Used a scoop and dropped the dough into a bowl of powdered sugar. Gave it a quick coating and placed on a greased sheet pan and gently flattened with my hand. I made 16 big cookies and baked them for about 11-12 minutes. The Bible study group I took them to asked me to email the recipe. A winner for sure!

This cookie was just OK.  I would rather have eaten the brownies!  I might have liked it better without the chips.  Followed the recipe exactly and did as JamieB said, dropped by spoonfuls into the powdered sugar, then rolled around until covered with another spoon.  Cooked for approximately 10 minutes.  I'm rating strictly on taste, it just didn't appeal to me.

Reliable and easy.  I used peanut butter chips instead of chocolate because I had them on hand.  Probably better with the chocolate.

My 9-year-old son and I made these together just as the recipe states and they turned out really good.  We found that baking them for 13 minutes made them perfect.  My husband said "Wow" when he tasted them, and he's not easily impressed.  Will make again!

Easy! A new favorite. My son calls them "milk guzzlers." I followed the advise of the reviewer who said they dropped the dough into a bowl of powdered sugar and then rolled them into balls. It worked perfectly.

5 stars for tastiness and simplicity!  :)  For Canadians like me: I used a 440 g (which is about 15.5 oz) package of Betty Crocker brownie mix, and followed the rest of the ingredient list with the exception of only adding 1/2 cup of semisweet chocolate chips.  It was SO easy to make this recipe.  Hand-mixed all the ingredients in a bowl, then let it sit for 10 minutes to thicken up.  In a shallow dish of powdered (confectioners') sugar, dropped spoonfuls (using a regular spoon, not a cookie dough scoop) of dough into the dish.  Piled sugar on top, picked up with my hands and juggled in my palms to (i) shape into balls, and (ii) shake off excess sugar.  Very easy and not messy at all.  Baked 27 of them on cookie sheets covered with wax paper at 350F for 12 minutes.  Came out perfectly.  Crispy-ish edges and soft gooey chocolate goodness inside!  What more can you ask?  :)

Thanks for this great quick & easy recipe.  We loved these cookies, especially the next day.  I'm making them again but plan to use mini-chips.  The regular size chips seemed to produce too much melted chocolate inside the cookie so that it was almost mushy.  We weren't sure at first if the brownie was not baked long enough. Once they were thoroughly cooled off the texture was much better.  Delicious!

They were very thin and just wouldn't cook. I had them in the oven for 20 minutes and they were still just a pile of goo when I tried to take them off the pan. Possibly it's because companies are making boxes smaller since this recipe was originally posted pre-recession. My brownie mix was only 17.4 ounces, as opposed to the 19.8 oz mix listed in the recipe.

Really yummy. A bit messy to make but worth it in the end. They flattened more than I expected while baking so not sure if I did something wrong. Still, definitely a keeper!!

My son is a big chocolate lover and these are his favorite cookies!  I make them exactly as written in the recipe but refrigerate the dough for about an hour before scooping.  The dough is still very soft so I drop the cookies directly from my scoop into the dish of powdered sugar.  Once coated with the sugar, they are very easy to work with.

A big hit!   Made according to recipe.  I did put the batter into the refrigerator for a little while and I did take the suggestions for using my pampered chef small scoop to make them.  Also suggested was to put the powdered suger in a pie plate, add numerous balls and coat & roll with a spoon.  Worked perfectly; mess was no more than any other cookie recipe.  I will be making these often.

i followed the recipe to a T and these did not come out well.  the dough seemed too thin and sure enough while baking they spread out like crazy and were totally flat.  Also a tablespoon is too big because you get these pancake looking cookies.  They taste OK but way worse than regular brownies.  They are too flat, dry and chewy in that over-baked way (even though i didn't).  I would recommend not wasting the brownie mix and just sticking to normal brownies

I made this strictly according to the recipe with no problems. I was expecting something wonderful from all the 5-star reviews, but I was totally underwhelmed with the taste. I'll stick to making my cookies from scratch from now on.

Wow these are fantastic... I just made them with a few adjustments. I added 1 cup of chopped walnuts. The brownie mix already had some chocolate chips in it but I added another cup in anyway. I also had to bake them for 15 minutes. Maybe because I'm at 4500 ft altitude?

This was disappointing. I used a 19.5 oz box of Pillsbury brownie mix. After the 1 cup of flour, it still seemed to soft, but I tried baking 8 cookies as originally written. The dough was falling apart into 2 or 3 pieces as I tried to roll it in the powdered sugar. Then while baking, they spread out way too thin. I added a little more flour to the remaining batter, just a spoonful at a time until it seemed to hold its shape better. The next 8 cookies I baked seemed to hold up a little better while rolling, but still spread out very thin while baking. Not sure what I'm doing wrong, perhaps a different brand of brownie mix would work??

Perfect cookie from a perfect recipe...  EASE OF PREP:  Very easy. MODIFICATIONS:  I used 1/2 C Ghirardelli Classic White Chips and 1/2 C Ghirardelli Milk Chocolate chips to the Betty Crocker Fudge Brownie mix 18.3 oz. family size, which though not the 19.8 oz size recommended in the recipe, still made perfect cookies.       CONSISTENCY OF DOUGH: I had no difficulties with the consistency of the dough and did not find it necessary to refridgerate after mixing all the ingredients as directed. It was quite easy to drop the dough by "cookie dough scoop" into the powered sugar, cover completely and then pick up and roll into a ball by hand which I then placed onto the greased cookie sheet.      COOKING TIME: I made two full batches which baked in six sheets.  Each was baked perfectly in 10 minutes.      TASTE:  My family loved these crispy on the outside/moist & soft on the inside chocolate-y delights!

These cookies are delicious!  A couple of notes:  The chocolate chips are nice, but not a necessary ingredient.  I chilled the dough before rolling into balls and coating with sugar and this made it much easier to work with (I tried doing it right away and it was far to messy!).  These took 20 minutes to be fully done, probably due to the chilled dough and using baking stones instead of metal baking sheets.  Lastly, on the second set that I baked I flattened the cookies slightly with a spatula when they were half way done - this made for a nicer presentation.

Followed recipe exactly and these are FANTASTIC! They were even yummier this morning (made last night) with my coffee, can't stop munching on them! SIZING: had to make 3 pans so I experimented - made 2 pans the size I thought they should be (bigger) and last pan were minis.  NOT DONE IN 10 MINUTES.  Minis in 11 minutes were THE BEST.  Pan at 12 minutes = perfect.  13/14 mins, a bit overdone.  But I would recommend making minis (silver dollar size and almost 1 in thick) they are perfect!  GREAT RECIPE THANKS!

These were so easy and delicious. I used an 18.3 oz box of brownie mix and followed the recipe. They turned out slightly crunchy and ooey, gooey goodness in the middle. I had no problems with getting messy fingers.

Great recipe! They were easy to make and a great recipe for children to help. I had my 3 year old daughter roll them in the powdered sugar and she had a blast! The only change I made was I used 1/2 cup of semi-sweet and 1/2 cup of milk chocolate chips for a little creaminess.

This is a super easy recipe but there are few things that have to be noted.  1) I didn't use all the flour recommended in search for a softer cookie. It resulted in a very SWEET, and soft, cookie.  2) Used half wheat flour. No one noticed... =)  3) Bake longer=firmer, less gooey cookie. Also less sweet.

A great cookie & brownie in one!  These are moist and chewy, look pretty, and are fairly easy to make.  The rolling in sugar takes a little extra time but is totally worth it.  I had some extra white chocolate chips on hand that I needed to use, so they ended up having 1/2 c. white and 1/2 c. chocolate chips...they looked pretty and tasted great!

Really easy recipe... But I had a hard time telling when these cookies were done, thus one batch was under-cooked and one over-cooked. I added white choc chips bc that's what I had. May try again, kinda disappointing...

Delcious. I had to change the time a little bit: for cookies without ch. chips I had in for 10 mins & the ones with ch. chips had to be in for 12 mins.  I absolutely adore these, definitely going in my christmas cookie tray!  Made 40 cookies!! :)

I made this recipe exactly as written, determined to trust the author on all counts. Everything went great (the dough is handle-able if you have a cookie scoop) except the bake time. They were mushy batter after 10 minutes. 13 minutes worked perfectly, but since I'd already wasted 1/3 of the dough, I ended up wishing I'd just made a pan of brownies.

I used a 19 ounce package of Ghirardelli brownie mix that already had chunks of chocolate in it, so left out the chocolate chips. Like some other reviewers, I had to add about a cup of extra flour to the dough so I could handle it. I recommend flattening the cookies with the bottom of a glass after rolling them in the sugar and putting them on the cookie sheet, they look prettier and cook better. Remember to just cook them until they're set, since they're made from brownie mix you don't need to cook them until they've firmed up or else they'll be hard after cooling. Giving the cookie sheets a rinse (b/c of the powdered sugar) and re-greasing them between "rounds" is a good idea, too. All in all, these cookies are pretty good! I'm going to experiment with different brands of brownie mix in the future. Thanks for the awesome idea!

These were fabulous!!!  Didn't bother with the confectioner's sugar either.  Might add some toasted cashews next time.  Thanks for a new favorite.

Easy and delicious.  Do not overbake, they become too dense that way.  I like them a bit fudgy on the insides:)  Came out  looking exactly like the photograph.  I did chill the dough overnight, then roll into balls before rolling balls in sugar.  Did not flatten balls when placing on cookie shape and they came out looking beautifully.

I gave this recipe 4 stars because as written, I dont feel like it works. Ive made this recipe several times now. Both as written, and also with adding extra flour as other reviewers suggested. I dont double the flour like many other reviewers do, but I do add at least 50% more. I made a batch of these today and realized I had bought the wrong size mix (18.3 instead of 19.8) but went ahead and  mixed the ingredients as stated in the original recipe and then added about 1/2 cup more flour. It wont be thick like regular cookie dough, but dont panic, you will be able to work with the dough. I spoon balls of dough into a bowl of powdered sugar and scoop sugar on top and around the balls. Once its coated in the sugar you can pick it up with your fingers (although you have to be careful as the doughs not horribly thick remember). Bake them towards the lower end of the time (8-9 mins) and then let them finish cooking/setting on the pan for a minute or two before removing them to cool. This makes them perfect. Chewy on the outside, soft on the inside. These are also fabulous either with or without chocolate chips. Delicious cookies!!

These are SO yum! After they cook, I like to re-roll them in confectioner's sugar so that they're extra pretty. I made this recipe and they were so soft and gooey. I baked them for only 8 minutes, since my oven runs hot. I'm dreaming of them again, but alas, my New Year's resolution is still strong...

Very very good cookies!!  I think that with my first batch I overcooked them a little bit.  They didn't look like they were done, so I left them in a few more minutes and the bottoms got kinda crispy!  But the second batch, I learned from my mistake!  I cookie scoop is a must, because this recipe can get a little messy if you don't have one!

Very easy, and a great twist on brownies!! My family and I loved them.  We had no left overs.  I would recommend a previous comment to chill the dough for a few hours before baking, it makes it so easy to work with.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

These were pretty tasty, though a pan of brownies would be much less hassel.  I used white chocolate chips instead of semisweet.  However, I ended up using another cup of flour & a shake of coco. Definately extend the baking time to 12 minutes.  (Perhaps the review that suggests cutting the H20 in half makes the most sense). *I made a few with an added tblspn of pntbutter to thicken the dough & those were also delicious.

These are WONDERFUL. I used Ghiradelli double chocolate mix with choco chips in it, so I didn't add the extra chocolate chips. I baked them for 9 minutes and they're soft and delicious and taste like fluffy brownies! My coworkers will LOVE them.

These were so simple to make! I followed the recipe exactly except with slightly less chocolate chips since I didn't have a full cup on hand. Perfect rolling consistancy. I followed someone's advice and used a cookie dough scoop to place them into the sugar, then rolled. Loved it and my kids were very impressed!

Yummy! I made these for the office today. Big hit. I followed the recipe exactly. First batch was underdone at 10min, 2nd batch was perfect at 12 min.
I used Hershey special dark chips, and Duncan Hines family style dark chocolate fudge brownie mix. YUM! I will definitely make these again.

Very yummy!  I really enjoyed making these!  I did have to cook them longer than 10 minutes to get them to firm up appropriately (and use a tad more flour).  However, I love the way they look and can't wait to modify the recipe by using different types of chocolate chips (PB, mint, etc).  Can't wait to try them a la mode!

Great! I followed the recipe exactly, except all I had was a 21 oz. box of brownie mix so I used that. I think it was for the best though since everyone else had to add extra flour. Also MAKE SURE TO ADD CHOCOLATE CHIPS!! It's not the same without them!

Very good. We used a 1/2 cup extra flour and peanut butter chips. The longer the mixture sits the thicker it becomes. This makes a TON of cookies. I can't count because we have eaten as we baked. Very good and easy. These would be great for a bake sale.Be sure to regrease your pan if you are using it over again(i forgot on one batchthey stuck just a little). also I used the handy cookie scoop and baked for exactly 8 min.

I thought these were okay, but my boyfriend devoured two of them as soon as he walked in the door after work (that is alot for him, he's not a big chocolate guy). I did omit the chocolate chips and did 2 batches like that. The last 2 batches I added about a 1/2 cup of peanut butter chips. I used my cookie scoop and had to cook mine for 13 minutes. Very easy recipe, thanks!

Good.  One thing: my brownie mix was 10.9 oz and I still had to add 1 cup flour in order to roll into balls.  Turned out fine, though.
