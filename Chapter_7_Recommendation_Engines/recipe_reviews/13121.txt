Tip for making meatballs: roll meat mixture out like a snake, and cut off same sized pieces. Use a colander to roll meat pieces around, this will make them round. Perfect, same-sized meatballs everytime!

The secret of this soup is GREEN CHILE SALSA which was in the original recipe I used in 2002 from this site.  This has been rewriten and changed to just salsa.  Be sure to use the green salsa.  It makes this soup.  (My original review follows) --- This wonderful soup was good to the last drop.  I served it to 9 people the first time I made it and everyone asked for the recipe.  Will make this again real soon!

There seems to be a little confusion over the term "green chili salsa."  When I submiatted the recipe, I used the term to mean salsa made with green chilis like Anaheims or jalapenos, not red chilis.  I use Pace salsa, mild or medium, or a similar brand.  Hope this helps, Kathy

Wow! This soup is fantastic! My husband's family is from Mexico and I didn't think I'd ever find a recipe that was as good as his mom's. But this is it! He was skeptical when he saw me tossing in bottled green salsa and cornmeal, but when he tasted it, he couldn't believe it!

I used low-sodium beef broth. For veggies, I added in 1 cup each of diced celery and carrots. I also added some cilantro and made it slightly spicy with a medium-hot green salsa. I cooked it for only 40 minutes after adding in the meatballs. Any longer would have made the vegetables and rice too mushy.

It heats up well the next day, too. YUM!!!

This is a great and simple soup to make.  The only place I would really stray would be the rice.  The original recipe calls for uncooked rice to be added to the soup.  If you do this, the starches in the rice will thicken the soup base.  Instead, take a 1/2 - full cup of cooked rice and add that to your meatball mixture.  This adds a nice texture to your meatballs!

This is the BEST recipe for albondigas that I have found.  Using medium salsa, I think, gives it just the right kick.  It makes a huge pot though, so be ready for leftovers!  I also used half chicken broth, and half beef broth with excellent results, as well as adding fresh chopped cilantro, and a little extra (cooked) rice.  FANTASTIC!!!

I Love this soup so much, and its so easy to change it how you like it. As is, its wonderful, but I do like to add other things to it to make it more like my grandmothers.

I always use a can of chile verde salsa, and using Cumin is a Must. 

I like mine with chopped up stalk of celery, squash, cabbage, and a bundle of cilantro. (Cabbage and cilantro should be added in last, after the meatballs). I'm diabetic so I usually omit breadcrumbs, rice, and milk with no problems too. 

**By the way... If you take out the Rice it reduces the cooking time by at least an hour.

Threw in cilantro where ever it called for basil & brown rice instead of white. It came out to be the best tasting soup!  The flavor is outstanding.

We love this soup! I've probably made it 10 times. I add a whole pound of 96% lean pork sausage in addition to a pound of ground beef, carrots, celery and rotel tomatoes. We love cilantro so I use that instead of basil and mix a few tablespoons into the meat mixture. It's a little salty but oh so good!

I have been making albondigas for years, but my recipe never approached the albondigas I'd have when eating out, so I questioned its authenticity and turned to Allrecipes for a different, more traditional take. This one definitely comes close, and couldn't be more opposite from what I was used to making - beef broth instead of chicken broth, no lime juice or jalapenos but the addition of salsa, etc. In short, this version is very good, and a much closer representation of what true albondigas tastes like. I did add carrots (great touch) but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. This was even better reheated the next day!

We loved this. I added chopped fresh mint leaves and 1/4 cup uncooked rice to the balls (no cornmeal and no salsa). I also used fresh cilantro and mint leaves in the soup instead of basil. I did not add any uncooked rice to the broth, some of the rice in the balls came out and cooked in the soup. I added extra veges to the soup: celery, carrots, corn and fresh cut green beans. So Healthy! I also used canned diced roasted tomatoes with green chilis. Wow, that added quite a kick! It was a little too spicey for me so I added parmesan cheese and a dallop sour cream (as I served it) to cool it off.  Everyone loved this soup. Most everyone did not need the sourcream or cheese.  We will definitely make this again.

I used ground turkey instead of the ground beef. Really made a nice textured meatball. Also used a medium heat green (tomatillo) salsa and added a couple of carrots sliced in rounds which I love in Albondigas. I made a double batch, froze half. I just ate the last bowl full and am glad I also doubled up on making the meatballs and froze enough for an additional single batch. The meatballs are the most tedious part of the recipe but well worth it.

I made this soup the other day,and really enjoyed it, taking bits from other reviews and adding a few of my own. I made my own beef stock with beef shanks,instead of using the 6 cans of stock. I Removed the shanks before adding meatballs. Because I hate touching raw dround meat ,and don't like rolling meatballs the tip from viewer to make a snake shape roll  snip and roll in bowl,worked great making uniform sized meatballs without ever touching my hands!, I also added lots of cilantro, especially fresh cilantro with every serving it really grabs the flavors and brings them out. I only used half a can of the green chile and it was spicy but not overwhelmingly. This recipe makes a big pot, therefore I did not add rice to pot as I knew it would take a few days to eat, we are a family of four and we are still enjoying this soup three days in,we just put it over a fresh bowl of rice everytime.

I have made this soup several times now and love it.  I now make a triple batch of meatballs and keep extras in the freezer for when the craving strikes. (1 lb ground beef, 1 lb chorizo sausage, 1 lb ground turkey) I also add cilantro to the meat mixture and the broth instead of basil. I have made it with the rice added and without-I now prefer it without.  This a delicious soup with great flavour.  You won't be disappointed!

I guess being Mexican, I'm more used to a more authentic Albondigas Soup.  This was good, but I doubt I'd make it again.  I prefer my own recipe.

I made this tonight and the whole family loved it!  I made a few changes, as usual.  I used brown rice, and threw it in from the beginning so it'd have plenty of time to cook.  I also added carrots and celery, per others' recommendations.  I added swiss chard at the very end, too.  I used cilantro where it called for basil, and I omitted the ground pork.  And I just used one large can of tomatoes.  It was wonderful!  Thanks for a great base for lots of creativity!

My family, who I can never please everyone at one time with  dinner, loved this soup.  I sped it along by using store bought turkey meatballs, cutting the calories.  I added two tablespoons of olive oil to add a healthy fat instead of boiling the hamburger and pork meatballs. Totally ready in 45  minutes. I drained the tomatoes so it was still brothy and not tomatoe based.  Still could have used less tomatoes.  Next time I will use just one can.  Great receipe.  I can't wait to have it again tomorrow for lunch.

I am so glad that I found this recipe!  I made the soup last night for dinner and am counting down until it is lunch time so I can devour the leftovers.  For the meatballs, I couldn't find 1/4 pound of sausage and didn't want leftovers so I used a meatloaf mix of meat that was 1 1/4 pounds. I replaced the basil with cilantro. For the broth, I saw the author's comment about using GREEN salsa and it was a key ingredient....excellent addition to it.  For the veggies, I sauteed onion, celery, and carrot before adding the broth.  I cooked the rice separately and I am glad I read the other reviews that suggested I do so.  I added fresh spinach and chopped cilantro to the soup about ten minutes before serving. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I've never had this before, it was going to be a new thing for me. WE LOVED IT!!!! I've been trying all types of new soups, and this is a keeper. Meatballs took some time to roll, but well worth it. Added some sour cream and some cheedar cheese, hmmm good!


Only changes I made was buying to tomatoes w/ the spices in the can, and didn't have green chili salsa, used pureered green chiles.

I love this recipe and so does my family. I've made it for family gatherings and it's always a hit.  I usually purchase a loaf of french bread and it's wonderful for dipping into the sauce as you eat it.    I do modify the recipe a bit though.  Instead of using the calculated pork sausage I substitute it with more ground beef or I just use all ground turkey, depending on my mood or what I have at home.  I don't always have fresh basil so I'll use the regular dried type.  Oh, and the best tip of all is I don't boil the meatballs in the sauce I bake them first to remove most of the fat (oven 350 degrees for about half hour or use your best judgement for your own oven) and once they're cooked I add them to the sauce with the remaining ingredients and cook at least an hour.

This was very good. My boyfriend and I ate this for a few days since I made it just for us, he loved it.  I did add 1c of rice to make for a thicker soup.  The meatballs are to die for.  I will surely make this one again. Thanks

This soup was wonderful!  Only made a few minor changes.  We put some fresh chopped basil and spinach into the meatball mixture (will probably add in some Tony Chachere's seasoning next time for a bit more flavor).  We also browned the meatballs a bit.  In the soup we put in more fresh basil and cilantro.  As suggested by others we did add in some cumin; wanted to add in some chipotle chili powder but the green salsa we used gave the soup plenty of heat (couldn't make it too hot or kids couldn't eat it).  We also just cooked some rice on the side and then everyone placed as much rice as they wanted and then poured the soup on top.  Flavorful and delicious.  Can't wait to eat the leftovers.

My husband loved this soup but I did tweak it. I looked at Albondigas Soup II on this sight, and added spices called for in that recipe: tsp each of cumin and chili powder and garlic powder in the broth. I also added chopped 5 carrots, 2 large zucchini, 5 celerystalks and some chopped onion(I made some extra brotht o accomodate the vegies). I think the addition of the vegetables made it a much better soup.

Very good, although I did all beef since I don't eat pork. On the reccomendation of other reviewers, I did a full cup of rice. I didn't make my meatballs too terribly small, so we ended up eating all of them and still had broth/rice left, so I added corn to the mix and that helped. I think the broth could have used more oregano and black pepper, but otherwise, this was very tasty.

I left out the cornmeal to keep it more authentic. Also, What helps hold the meatballs together is adding uncooked white rice to the meat mixture instead of the broth. Just like how my abuelita made, yum!

Great classic, base soup.  Warning: You'll need at least an 8 qt. pot.  Did not have jar salsa so I made my own (2 chopped tomatoes, 2 cloves minced garlic, 1/2 chopped onion, 2T olive oil, 1/4 c lemon juice, 3T diced/canned green chilis, S&P).  Used 3, 32 oz. containers of broth (1 beef, 1 chicken, 1 veg).  Also increasedthe oregano and and basil to 1T (you can barely taste them if you don't).  Baked very tiny meatballs (no larger than 1" in diameter--trick using collander doesn't really save any time over making by hand) in 350 oven for 25 mins.  Sauteed onion with 1 cup carrots in a little olive oil before adding rest of soup ingredients.  As suggested, when simmering was reached,  I dropped the cooked meatballs in and simmered 40 mins more.  Perfecto!

I fiddled with the recipe a bit but it was still wonderful.  I cooked it in my slow cooker.  Put everything but the meat and rice in the pot and turned it to high while I was making the meatballs.  Didn't have two onions so I used onion soup mix in the meatballs.  Took forever to make the meatballs but well worth the time.  Cooked on high in the slow cooker for 4 more hours.  Turned out great and the leftovers are even better than the first taste.

Just okay, something was missing?  Maybe coriander?  Tasted really acidic to me, followed directions only thing I added was some addional salt and some carrots for some texture.

Absolutely delicious!  My boys all loved this soup; it's a delightful change from stews and such.

Only change I made was to use cilantro in place of basil; the rice does tend to sink, so next time I may make rice, put it in the bowls first, then ladle the soup over it.  Overall, though, this recipe is a keeper!

Fantastic recipe! I made a handful of changes to make it more authentic for the mexican side of the family. I added cilantro at the beginning, and didn't put as much fresh basil or onions as called for in the meatballs. I also added 3/4 cp. of rice 30 minutes prior to the soup being done instead of 1/2 cp. at the beginning. The biggest changes I made were to use chicken broth instead of beef and adding rice to the meatballs. This is how my boyfriend was used to it, so I thought I'd try it. I put 3/4 cp. rice in the meatballs, which is a lot, but that's how it was preferred in my house. Overall it was great! Highly recommended!

The soup is great..however, cooking the rice for an 1.5hrs is waaaaay to long. I was so excited about the soup when i first did a taste test. But when i came back to the pot 1.5hrs later.. i had a pot of mushy rice. I little more than doubled the rice which was a lil too much. I do think it needs more than 1/2c. but just not as much as i put in there. I suggest pouring your rice in , the last 20 mins or so. Or even adding cooked rice towards the very end.

We thought this soup was pretty good! Hubby is looking forward to it again tonight. 
I don't like onions in my meatballs, so I threw those in the pot. I also added 1 small sliced carrot and about 1/2 stalk of diced celery. I would suggest using a little more seasoning in this... cumin and oregano, maybe even some chili flakes. I made the meatballs using a 1/2 " tsp. and although it took FOREVER, that's how the soup is done. And you'll be sorry if you run out of the the little suckers~ I didn't use the ground pork... none at the market. Cooked the rice on the side, so we could add it in the amount we wanted. Besides, I couldn't stand the thought of starch in my soup. And it definitely needs double the amount of rice.
Thanks for the recipe... I would make this again.

This soup recipe was really great just made a few alterations such as adding vegetable broth along with the beef broth. I also added some fresh cilantro sprigs in place of the fresh basil I thought that doing this made everything come together very well. As a garnish use some fresh chopped cilantro and dried red pepper flakes. The family is sure to love it. Thank you so much for sharing this simple yet delicious recipe

This was the first time I made this soup and it was WODERFUL! I also used half the amount of tomatoes called for and added a little cooked rice to the meatballs. I also added 1 tsp. each of cumin to the meatball mixture and soup. It really was as good as an authentic restaraunt or better! Not too greasy or bland as some other reviews stated. Thank you Kathy!

I made this for the first time this past week for guests (12 people to be exact). Excellant!!! Everyone LOVED it. Looked high & low for the green chile salsa but it was worth it. We served it with shredded cheese & that only added to an already great soup.

We were in the mood for soup and I just happened across this recipe! It is awesome! I used chorizo sausage and my meatballs came out really sticky and hard to roll, so maybe that's why. I wanted to put it in the slow cooker, so I simmered the meat balls in a pan with 2 cans beef broth, skimmed off the fat, and added it to the rest of the ingredients in the slow cooker. I let it cook around 6 hours on high and it was awesome. I added cooked rice to the bowls of soup as I was serving them, and topped it with some cheese and tortilla strips! Yummy!

This is one of my best recipes yet. A few modifications to this recipes are:
replacing the cornmeal w/SEMOLINA FLOUR, this make your meatballs tender.
pork sausage w/Jimmy dean pork sausage w/sage and green chile salsa w/green chile enchilada sauce.  Thank you Kathy Nelson for such a great recipe

Everyone loved this soup.  I made a few changes that have been suggested and some of my own.  I used only beef no pork..as many family members donot eat pork. Cilantro instead of basil, red onion in the meatballs...gives a hint sweeter taste to compliment any saltyness of the beef broth.  I do think there was to much onion in this recipe for the meatballs so added about half of what was suggested. Did not add any salt you can always add that later.  I browned half my meatballs and did half regular to see which I liked best...both were very good...the browned ones had a more robust meaty flavor that was very nice.  I also added cumin in the meatballs about 3/4 tsp.  I cooked my rice added some to the meatballs...and when ready to serve added some in the bottom of the soup bowls topped with a slice of avacado, wedge of lime, twig of cilantro.  I used Chicken broth and 2 beef boullion cubes with water...this adds a saltly taste..next time I will only use one beef boullion or one can beef broth...I also added chopped carrots and celery with a few celery leafs to the soup for a more heartier winter soup. A lot of changes here to the original recipe...but I think just as tasty and authentic as I've seen here in San Diego.

I'd never had this soup before and couldn't wait to try it once I read the recipe. I did make one big change. I don't eat either pork or beef, so I just substituted ground turkey and kicked up the seasoning a tad. It was great! I will make this all the time now. I figured by using ground turkey the fat gets cut by two thirds. As I am "counting points" on Weight Watchers, that's not something to sneeze at. Healthy, yummy, and filling.

EXCELLENT soup.  However, be aware that the "heat" of the green chiles (hot, medium or mild) has a big effect on the spiciness of the soup.  I used hot chiles the first time I made it, and although it was great, only the die-hard chile-heads could eat it.  Make it medium or mild for a more overall crowd-pleasing dish!

I cooked this as part of a mexican dinner for my mothers birthday; she says it reminds her of how her mother used to make it. I added a extra rice (3/4cup) and made & refridgerated the meatballs the day before - that really helped to make things go quicker. Thanks for the recipe, its a favorite!!

A lot different, from the way we make it in Chihuahua. We just use ground beef and rice, no milk, no eggs. We also put in Cilantro an cummin which gives it a beautiful smell and taste. Usually add in diced potatoes, carrots. This recipe was good but I guess it was just missing that traditional taste I'm used to.

I used frozen vegetarian meatballs and Edward & Sons Not-Beef stock but followed the original recipe otherwise.  Tastes just like the restaurant versions I missed so much.  Thanks for posting.

I made this and took it to work and had everyone coming back for more and asking for the recipe!  My daughter loved it as well and she's not easy to please.  I added a handful of frozen veggies and fresh baby carrots.  Definitely a keeper!

I really liked this recipe.  I added carrots and cilantro at the end. The meat balls were really good.  I used SPG to season them.  Equal parts salt, pepper, granulated garlic.  My kids even ate all this.  BIG DEAL around here.

My family has made this soup for years but the is by far the best recipe!!!!  I think it has alot to do with the green salsa and also the use of cornmeal mixed in with the meatballs.  It is so yummy and it gets even better the next day.  I made this step by step as suggested and I do not think it needs any addtions.  My family was very happy.  Thank you for the recipe...it is a keeper.

I made just a couple of changes to this soup, I used cilantro in the meatballs instead of basil and I used some ground turkey (a minor effort to make it healthier) in place of the pork sausage.  My husband hails from Mexico and he kinda wrinkled his nose at the idea of the sausage.  Otherwise I did everything else the same and it was quite yummy.  The only thing I would do differently next time is precook some rice, maybe 1/4 c, and combine it in with the meatballs.  I know another reviewer suggested this and my hubby backed it up saying that was the way his mother made it.  Two thumbs up from the both of us!

We all really liked this soup. I love the soft texture of the tiny meatballs which I assume is from the cornmeal in the mix. I used regular mild salsa (don't like things really hot). I used half beef and half chicken broth. I added some chopped carrot and celery to the soup as well as cilantro instead of basil (because I had it) and some cumin. I did use more rice (half a cup of white and brown). I like how it got a little thick from cooking the rice in the soup. I will definately be making this again!  Thanks to my Quality Cook friends, I don't think I would have even thought to make this witoout your recommendations.  And thanks Kathy for a great recipe!

My husband and I both are nuts about this soup.  I mix rice in with the meatballs, but he likes it in with the soup too.  Also I sub in cilantro for basil.  At least in the winter. :) Labor intensive!

I had most of the ingredients on hand so I decided to make this soup. I was amazed how good this was. Even my husband, who doesn’t think soup is a meal, loved it. For the meatballs I used only beef. I used chopped fresh cilantro, not basil. Instead of the garlic and salt I used Adobo.  I don’t keep cornmeal on hand so I used seasoned bread crumbs.
I lightly browned the meatballs, and then added the liquids. I don’t like the taste of canned beef broth so I used chicken. The quality of the salsa is key. I used Goya Salsa Verde. I would not try to use a red salsa in this dish, as the person below stated. Toward the end I added a couple of handfuls of medium egg noodles (Kids prefer noodles over rice). Also I snuck in package of thawed chopped spinach. The soup is so full of flavor the kids didn’t even know. Rich flavorful broth, with tender meatballs this meal is a real winner. A definite must try!

Very Good! Other than a dash of cumin,  I followed this recipie exactly.  Using a small melon baller (dipped occasionaly in water) made making the meatball uniform and a snap. Will difinately fix again!

Very good. I did divide the sausage and hamburger into equal portions. I also sprinkled a shredded Mexican cheese mix on top of each serving. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as it is written. Very tasty! Lots of flavor! I will make this again.

This was very good, as some others did I also changed it a little. I didn't use any basil and I used ground pork. I added one whole serrano chile to the stock and let it simmer for about an hour then removed the chile. This really gave it a nice chile flavor without making it too spicy. I also added one chopped carrot, zucchini and celery stock. Perfect for those cold evenings by the fire, my family loved it. Thanks Kathy!

Delicious!  Following another reviewer's suggestion, I added cooked rice to the meatballs. I doubled the salsa and topped it with cilantro and avocados.  This recipe is not as good the second day as the rice seemed to mushy by the reheat.

Used ground turkey instead of beef and pork, brown instead of white rice, added potatoes and corn, substituted masa harina instead of cornmeal and used cilantro instead of basil. Also took the advice of other readers and used half beef broth and half chicken broth. Would rate this a 4 1/2 and only because I think I put too much rice in it and next time would add celery.  Will definitely be making again!  Thanks Kathy!

AWESOME SOUP! Tried a medium green-chile salsa, just the right amount of heat. Would also add a bit more rice to recipe. Takes quite awhile to form meatballs, but keeping them to bitesize is well worth the extra time. Thanks

Very good...and VERY spicy.  It was too spicy for my kids so I added a dollop of sour cream to each bowl and they loved it!!  The sour cream really toned it down without it losing any of the taste.

This was a wonderful, authentic soup.  I love to go to my favorite Mexican restaurant just for albondiga soup...now I don't have to!  It was truly great, I've made it several times since I first got the recipe and have had a lot of people ask me for the recipe.  Worth the work on this one!

We enjoyed this soup with some
friends, and everyone liked it.  You can 
control how hot the soup is buy using a 
mild, medium, or hot salsa.  I used 
medium, and that was just enough for me.

The taste of this soup was great, however I was not able to make the meatballs stick at all. I wanted to use the suggestion of rolling out like a snake...it was not happening. I then added another beaten egg and more corn meal, again not happening...any suggestions? I did use a lb sausage and added 1/2 cup brown rice to the meatballs and 1/2 cup to the soup with diced carrots and celery. Again the taste was great, but presentation not so much. Help, I would love to make this again.

Absolutely delicious...I doubled the recipe and served this soup for guests and all went back for seconds.  There was a small amount leftover, so I added several ears' worth of fresh-from-the-garden corn and my husband and I finished it off the next day.  This is a definite keeper!

Although we really enjoyed this recipe as is, it definately needs more rice!  I used regular mild salsa, and like TNT also left the onions out of the meatballs and used sweet Italian sausage in place of the ground pork.  The meatballs and broth was fantastic, but I think next time I would also add some carrots & celery as cookinme did. (great pic, cookinme!) Thanks for the recipe.

My family really loved this comforting soup Kathy. My QualityCook friends and I made this together and we all enjoyed it. I used low sodium chicken broth and brown rice. Delicious and thank you!

We loved this! I added the uncooked rice to the meatball mixture instead of the soup! I also added slices of corn on the cob, potatos, celery, and carrots to the soup.

This is my new favorite soup to make! I used salsa verde and chicken broth. I also used a cup of rice. Don't be fooled by the thin consistency when you first start the soup. It ends up thick and hearty! The only problem is that I can never remember the name....

Awsome, this has been a huge hit with my family and friends. I add extra rice as well as chunks of carrots, celery, onion and more tomatos just because we like it like that. And I was just told my version is better than the best Mexican restraunt here where we live! :D

Excellent soup! Had a nice "comfort-food" taste, with a hint of heat. We topped it with a tiny  bit of chopped cilantro, and it was a good addition.

A wonderful and easy recipe.  I have even cooked it in the crock pot and it turned out great!  I made it one time for a family get together and now everyone is asking for it.  I used fat free and low sodium beef broth.  It is wonderful.  Thanks so much for sharing.

Loverly. Although next time instead of using a canned I will try a fresh salsa. This was a little acidic like this, with all the tomato juicey stuff. My mother liked it tomatoey, but I would prefer a more beef broth. This is all personal speculation. Delicious.

This is so good.  We loved it.  It makes enough for leftovers and the leftovers are just as good as the first day!  For a lower fat version, we substituted turkey sausage for the pork and ground turkey for the beef.  Even the broth was wonderful.  Next time, we will serve it with cornbread.

This soup was yum-yum-yummy. Perfect for a cold evening because it is so filling and should be eaten as a meal by itself. I added about 1/2 cup more rice because I didn't feel the recipie called for enough. This is what makes it so hearty. I froze what my husband and I couldn't finish and I'm looking forward to thawing it out soon!

This is the best soup that I have tasted in a long time.  You cannot beat the flavor of this dish.  Amazing!  BUT be prepared to spend time on it, for it is NOT a quick dish by any means.  It IS worth every bit that you put into it though! Leaves you craving for more!

It was so yummy; the meatballs in the tomato
sauce and rice made a fabulous meal for the first
very very cold night of the season. We are in
love with the sweet and spiciness of this soup.

Thanks, Ms. Nelson.

This was pretty good.  I followed the recipe except used leftover rice.  My husband and I both like it, and it will be a good starting off point for other soups.  Next time we'll add some veggies like corn or who knows what.  This makes a LOT of soup, but it's good stuff, even leftover the next day.  Thanks!

I had a hard time rating this recipe.  It made a very good soup however, it was VERY greasy.  It was so greasy that we ate very little of it.  I checked the recipe to make sure I did not miss a step - and I didn't.  The next day I took all the grease off and heated it up and it was MUCH better.

Yummy!  I changed it up a little to my taste.  I added chopped fresh spinach (about 1 1/2 cups) to the meatballs and browned them in olive oil (I doubled the recipe)and I added about 2 cups of fresh french style string beans cut into 1" pieces.  I had all of this in my crock pot and about 15 min b/4 serving, I stacked fresh spinach on the top.  It was absolutely wonderful.  Another keeper!  Thanks.

It was pretty good for me making it...but something was missing. I did listen to the other users who said to use cilantro, and added more rice than what it says.

I thought this was very greasy and bland, but my hubbie liked it so I'll make it again.  I plan to bake the meatballs on a rack in the oven next time though to drain all the grease off before I add them to the soup.

I don't usually like albondigas because of how much basil is in it, but this one was really good with some changes.  I used 1 pound of ground turkey instead of the beef and pork mixture.  I also cut down my basil to 1/4 teaspoon of dried basil in my meatballs.  My husband really like this as well and that's something since he grew up eating his mom's albondigas and this was way different.

This was an easy and wonderfully delicious recipe! I added a pinch of red chile powder to the meatballs- we love the added "punch" it gave! Thanks for sharing the recipe, this is a keeper!

I just made the soup today!  I absolutely loved it, I followed the instructions to a t, except I did add some cumin to the meatballs.  I also added cilantro at the end to garnish...  I will definitely be making this again! However, next time I may consider low sodium beef broth... =o)

Excellent!!!  Easy, flavorfull and satisfying.  Searching for salsa verde is worth the trouble, my store carried only 1 brand.  i took the advice of other reviewers and used 1 full cup of rice, but next time i'll cut the salsa down because my husband is not a big fan of spicy foods.  my picky 15 year old stepson and i each had 2 large bowls, it was absolutely delicious.  a definate keeper.

My husband has been requesting this soup for a while, so I made it for Christmas Eve.  It makes quite a lot!  I added a bit more salsa, and added some shredded cheese on top.  Very good!

My family LOVED this recipe. I added rice in the meat as suggested but they still need bread crumbs to hold them together a little better. Overall it's the most delicious albondigas soup we've eaten, even better than restaurants! Nice going Kathy !

My family loved this soup.  I made the meatballs, and there were plenty, with 1/2 lb. gr. beef, 1/2 lb. sausage.  I also added 1 cup of cooked rice to the meat mixture.  I didn't add another onion to the meat, because there was already plenty in the soup.  I used most of a jar of Pace Mexican Creations Ranchero cooking sauce for the salsa, and I think it worked well.  One draw back, I like tomatoes, a lot, but it seemed like between the diced tomatoes and the salsa, there were way too many.  I think next time I'll break it up a little and add some different veggies and just one can of tomatoes.  It really was a delicious soup!

This is wonderful!  I'd never had Albondigas until I came across this recipe while looking for something different to use sausage in.  I made some homemade tortillas (from a recipe found on this site).  Very good comfort food!

I thought it was excellent but greasy, Now I forgo the pork and I mix the rice with the meatballs which is how it is done in Mexico.

This was my first time making this soup. My boyfriend's mother used to make it for him when he was little. He said it tasted just like hers. I added vegetables such as celerly, carrots and cabbage. It was the best and easiest soup! Thanks for the great recipe!!

Hearty & delicious! Skipped the pork and the cornmeal, and put the rice right into my meatballs, along with more garlic and some taco seasoning.  Sauted the onion with a little fresh garlic before adding the liquids.  I only needed 2 cans of broth and 1 can of tomatoes.  I also used about a cup each of enchilada sauce and tomato sauce, instead of the salsa, and my soup pot was full. I also added a little sliced zucchini and carrots for some veggies.

Another winner from the All Recipes website.  I found sort of an off brand home-made type salsa at the grocery store--HOT green chili salsa--which gave this soup quite a BITE ... but it was OH SO GOOD!!!  As other reviewers have suggested, control the heat with the salsa ... pick your poison based on how hot you like your recipes.  I don't especially prefer hot food, but the hot green chili salsa was just the right tough.  It was hot, but not uncomfortably so.  I used more meat than the recipe called for and ended up with a ton of soup--but it will be eaten in NO TIME.  Not a bad meal for Halloween night!!

The soup is tasty with just enough spice.  The broth is clear and goes well with the meatballs.  I feel that some cilantro, maybe 1/4 cup fresh, could be added to the broth for the Mexican taste and the rice should be cooked before and added to the meatball mixture and then put in boiling broth.  Overall a good soup with lots of taste.

Great recipe!  I did make a few adjustments, I addded a bit more rice, I used ground turkey and use 1/2 beef broth and 1/2 chicken broth - what a treat for a healthy, warm satisfying meal.

I made a couple of adjustment and added Green & Red Peppers, I used cubed pork tenderloin along with the ground round meatballs. This is an excellant soup. Everyone loved it and the leftovers lasted about 24 hrs before they disappeared.

No green salsa needed. For authentic mexican albóndigas use chipotle. A couple of chipotle peppers from a small can will be a huge difference.

We all loved this soup but I did make a few alterations. First off the meat mixture actually made three meals of soup for us. It helped make the meal a little cheaper too. I also added almost double the rice. I like rice though. My husband had thirds and then ate the rest for lunch the next day. It was a little spicy for little ones

I admit I did have an extremely hard time looking for "green chile salsa" I scored the shelves.  The best thing I could come up with is a red chile taco sauce and it had a "huge" effect on the taste.  I made it for my family and the seemed to have enjoyed it better than I did I read the comments from the recipe submitter and I am glad for the explination about the "green chiles" I will remake the soup this time using the brand of the local supermarket it is "fantastic" salsa.  I am sure I will enjoy it much better.

I LOVE this recipe! The meatballs are fluffy and it's worth the effort of making meatballs.  I like to add a little sugar to cut the tang of the tomatoes and green chile salsa.

decent enough. Broth has a nice kick but the meatballs were a little grainy (maybe the corn meal?)

I made this soup using the recipe above and combining ingredients from another similar recipe. I added carrots, cabbage, potatoes and celery.  The soup was a hit and was better than the local restaurants that serve this style.  One of my critics works in a restaurant and wants the recipe.. We'll see... Anyway, it was easy to make and the meatballs were great with the combined beef and pork, very tasty! Hardest part for me was keeping meatballs a consistent size.  Not too small and not too large.  I highly recommend  making this soup, it's a winner!!

I used bread crumbs instead of corn meal for the meat balls. It worked out very well.

It's a great recipe to start off with but like all recipes I make changes to my acquired taste. I felt the soup had way too much tomatoes in it so I actually had to take some of the broth out and freeze it and add more water and Seasonings to the pot. Next time I would add one can of tomatoes instead of two. I did add some fresh corn carrots and celery. All in all a good recipe just needed to be tweaked.

Green chili salsa, of course. But the one thing that made this so much easier to make was to remove the one onion from the meatball mix and put it in the broth instead. The taste is the same, and the meatballs were so.much.easier to manufacture. Love this!

Added sliced celery & carrot to the broth mixture.  Definitely use green salsa.  Added just a bit chopped fresh cilantro before serving.

If you're in a hurry, you can use the frozen albondigas meatballs you find in your grocery's frozen section with good results.

Amazing. I used brown rice, added quinoa and dinosaur kale to boost nutritional value. Used Old Bay seasoning and no onions in meatballs. Incredible

I'm still working on getting this soup to taste like the soup we get at our favorite Mexican restaurant. I usually put way too many ingredients in my homemade soup. I need to keep it simple in the future.

I've been looking for this recipe for years! My grandma used to make it, and I never bothered to ask her what it was called.

Probably one of my favorite recipes. I use a 50/50 combination of Spicy Italian Sausage and ground beef for the meatball. Everything thing else remains the same.
