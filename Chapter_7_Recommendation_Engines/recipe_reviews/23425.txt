This recipe is okay, but I will definitely make some adjustments next time.  Too much ricotta cheese (8oz would be fine) and not enough pesto.  I substituted mushrooms for the spinach, which was a good choice.  The directions should include putting a bit of sauce on the bottom of the pan as the bottom layer of noodles got a bit hard.  Also, the amount of sauce on top is a bit much so either spread it out through the dish or just pour 1/2 the called for amount on top.  Even with all that said, I will make again.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it!! I used the jar pesto sauce and alfredo sauce and no cook noodles which made it faster and easier to make. I put a layer of alfredo sauce on the bottom and the top, I also added a tsp of fresh garlic to the onion and spinach mixture which added more flavor, my husband said it was one of the best dishes I had made!!! Try it!!!

I HAD A BUNCH OF FRESH SPINACH TO USE UP, SO I TRIED THIS RECIPE.  I DIDN'T HAVE ANY BASIL PESTO ON HAND, SO I USED CLASSICO SUN-DRIED TOMATO PESTO AND SUN-DRIED TOMATO ALFREDO SAUCE.  I SAUTEED THE ONION WITH GARLIC, SLICED MUSHROOMS, SHREDDED CARROTS AND CHOPPED ZUCCHINI WHICH I SEASONED WITH NATURE'S SEASON SALT MIXTURE INSTEAD OF ADDING SALT TO THE CHEESE FILLING.  I MIXED THE PARMESAN INTO THE CHEESE FILLING AND LEFT OUT THE NUTMEG BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD GO WITH THE SUN-DRIED TOMATO SAUCE.  I LAID UNCOOKED SPINACH LEAVES ON TOP OF THE VEGGIE FILLING IN EACH LAYER.  I HATE COOKING LASAGNA NOODLES, SO I LAID THEM IN THE GLASS BAKING DISH,  POURED BOILING WATER OVER THEM AND LET THEM SOAK WHILE I PREPARED THE VEGETABLES AND THE CHEESE FILLING.  I USED A 16-OZ JAR OF ALFREDO SAUCE AND POURED ABOUT HALF OF IT INTO THE DISH BEFORE I PUT IN THE FIRST LAYER OF NOODLES, AND THEY COOKED JUST FINE IN THE SAUCE.  THIS IS THE FIRST VEGGIE LASAGNA I HAVE EVER MADE AND IT TURNED OUT GREAT!

This was loved so much by my dad that I was inspired to write my first review.  I've made this dish twice now.  Very yummy and decadent.  Great for company.  I followed the recipe with the exception of using an entire jar of Bertolli Alfredo sauce (16 oz.), and only 9 lasanga noodles (3 layers).  Added a little extra sauce inbetween layers, and the rest on top.

This was tasty. I used Classico pesto and alfedo sauces, which I thought tasted great and made it easy to make. The only thing I might change in the future is to add some alfredo sauce on each layer instead of only on top, to add a little more flavour.

I made my own alfredo sauce since I don't like the sauce in the jar!  This dish tastes better warmed up.

Yum! Great combonation of flavors. Made "lasagna roll-ups" instead of a pan of lasagna. Easier to make lasagna for two. Nixed the onion and spinach. Baked chicken breasts in oven smeared with pesto. Chopped. Used half ricotta half cottage cheese. Layered noodle, alfredo sauce, ricotta/cottage mixture, chicken, more pesto, sprinkle cheese, black pepper, roll up, top with more alfredo sauce, mozz & parm.

Excellent! I served this for six men for lunch and they loved it! I would recommend putting a thin layer of alfredo sauce on the bottom of the pan before you put your first layer of noodles in the pan. I used a 12oz jar of alfredo sauce and the freshed prepared pesto sauce Costco offers on a regular basis.

I used this for my sister's bridal shower along with jojolyn's Pasta Bake. Everyone loved it and many asked for the recipes. I didn't get to eat until the end of the party and I thought it was OK... but it would probably have tasted better if I'd eaten it fresh.

I made this for my Parents and Husband and it was a HUGE hit!!  My mom said it was the best lasagna she had ever had.  I followed the recipe with one exception - I added 1 lb of small shrimp and used cottage cheese instead of ricotta.  I'll make this again for sure!  One thing I did find is that the 35 minute prep time was a bit under estimated for me.  It took me about 45-50 minutes of prep time and I cooked it for 1 hour.  I think letting it sit for a while (like 20-30 minutes) after taking it out of the oven would have let it set up better.

Amazing recipe, very adaptable to different tastes! Started with the original recipe but I prefer a little meat in my lasagna so I added a pound of ground beef. Delicious but a little too greasy.   Next time, I used 1 1/3 lb. ground turkey instead of beef (healthy bonus), doubled the spinach (more healthy), and cut ricotta in half based on other comments. Cook the ground turkey (or beef) with the spinach and onion and follow the rest of the recipe as is. Also, I tend to increase the pesto to 10 ounces, not mandatory but more flavorful. Enjoy!

Great recipe! Huge hit with my family. I will add some alfredo sauce in the middle next time as I thought it was dry. Think it would also be great with some chopped artichokes. Will definitely be making this again and again!

Very good.  Added random veggies (bell pepper, more onions) diced for extra substance.  The recipe calls for too much ricotta, this could be cut in half.

This recipe was very easy to prepare.  At first I thought there wasn't enough pesto-spinach sauce because it spread very thin.  But the flavor is strong, so I wouldn't add any more.  I used marinara sauce instead of alfredo because that is all I had.  Also I added some ground beef on one side for my non-vegetarian husband.  Overall it's very good.

I do not eat meat and I was looking for a recipe for meat-less lasagna. This recipe was delicious and fairly easy to make.  I substitued the fresh spinach for the frozen, and ended up coming up a little short.   The only thing I would change about this recipe is the alfredo sauce. I'm sure I will make this again, but I will use a sauce with more zest.

This is a great lasagna. The first time I added mushrooms, the second time artichoke bottoms - I feel like it needs a little something for bulk. Also, I don't use all 30 oz of ricotta. Guests love it and I always hope for leftovers!

An amazingly decadent vegetarian recipe.  I used only about half the quantity of ricotta - and actually used cottage cheese instead.  I had a bigger jar of Alfredo and used all of it for moisture.  I also used more spinach than called for.  Got lots of praise for this one and enjoyed the leftovers too.

Excellent!  Perhaps the best lasagna I've ever tasted, and as a big plus it was a huge success with the five kids (and they not fans of traditional lasagna).

I followed the advice of another reviewer and put a thin layer of Alfredo to start with before adding the first layer of pasta, so the bottom layer of pasta was still as moist as the rest.  A few notes:
  (a) Used 1/3 of a jar (about 7 oz.) of Costco Pesto, which we've found to always taste freshly made.
  (b) Used Ragu Lite Alfredo sauce as it was more of an accent/blend flavor, and the dish was plenty rich thanks to the pesto.
  (c) Was hesitant to use the frozen box of spinach, as we like to use fresh ingredients where possible, however this worked just fine, and there's plenty of work with the other ingredients.
  (d) Ingredients overfilled the 9 x 13 glass baking dish (took it right to the top, and boiled over in the oven), even though I matched the recipe's ingredient amounts.  Next time I'll use a slightly larger dish, or start by placing a cookie sheet w/foil on the rack below the lasagna.

I had a girl's night and we decided to make this recipe a little bit healthier.  We susbstituted the ricotta with low fat cottage cheese (straining the liquid first) and the alfredo with traditional red sauce.  And we didn't have any nutmeg and used a sprinkle of cinnamon instead.  Everyone loved it and we felt less guitly about our seconds!

I had to make my own pesto, which could have been a disaster, but mixed well with the spinach mixture.  The jar of Alfredo was far too salty and although it's a nice shortcut, a homemade bechamel would have served better.  I used 15oz of ricotta, and it turned out well, I wouldn't be shy to use the recommended 30oz.  It's worth keeping to try a few different things.

This was pretty good.  It was actually a little too much spinach for me. I may try to add some chicken next time.  I also thought it could use a little more pesto, but I really like pesto!

I made this for my book club meeting, and it was DELICIOUS!!  I had a hard time finding the right size package of spinach, so I combined 2 smaller ones and estimated the amount.  Also, the only lasagna noodles I could find were the "no boil" kind, and it worked out just fine.  I can't wait to have the small bit of leftover for lunch -- my husband and I argued over who got the little bit left in the pan.

LOVED this lasagna! The only modification I made, was adding a small amount of Alfredo sauce on the bottom of the pan, from the recommendation of another user. Otherwise I followed this recipe to the  "T" and it came out awesome! My picky husband even liked it! Will defiantly make it again.

I made this tonight for supper and it was wonderful.  Put a little of the alfredo sauce in the bottom of the casserole dish as suggested and the noodles were tender and delicious.  Will make again.

This ended up being by far my new favorite recipe. Of course I didn't follow the recipe the way I should. We were trying out a new pasta machine, so we had fresh pasta. we used jared Marina sauce, instead of Alfredo. Followed the cheese part to a tee. Then we made 2 different kinds one with meat and one without. The meat we used gound beef, chopped onion and minced garlic sauteed onion and garlic in olive oil added gr. beef. Drained fat, added this layed on top of spinach then topped with cheese layer. I am going to make this recipe again and again. Usually I hate when people rate the recipe low, when they didn't follow the recipe, but I hope you can follow my changes and enjoy this recipe as much as we did.

This was very good!  However, I did add two boxes of spinach to give it more filling.  I also added mushrooms and used red sauce.  I did not boil my noodles, just soaked them in warm water and they were perfect.  Yum!

This recipe was really good, although I did make a couple of changes: I only used an 8oz package of spinach, and a grand total of 9 lasagna noodles, three on each layer.  My dinner guests really enjoyed the dish.

A lighter version of the usual heavy fare.  The adults liked it pretty well, the kids weren't too crazy about it.  I used 15 oz. of ricotta and 15 oz. of cottage cheese because I'm not a huge fan of ricotta.  We liked the flavor.  I only needed about 3/4 of the box of lasagna noodles.  Will make again.

Will definitely try again with a little tweaking.  Recipe needs a bit more flavor--add more salt and pepper, and a bit of garlic which is currently not called for.  I'd also up the pesto, perhaps double.  The recipe would benefit from some guidance on number of layers and how much filling to add between the layers--I used five layers of noodles (4 layers of filling)-- if you follow this, the filling will be relatively thin on each layer.  Easy to make.

I know it’s wrong to look for a veggie lasagna and then add meat, but I was afraid the hubby would turn up his nose. So, made a few adjustments and we both LOVED it!!  Added.about 1c shredded carrots and 1c sliced fresh mushrooms and 1lb Italian sausage to the spinach mixture. Then It seemed that more was needed to make the ricotta mixture go far enough so I added about 1/2c cottage cheese and 1 tsp garlic powder and some fresh parsley. Used 15oz of the Alfredo sauce and broiled the dish for the last 10min or so to “brown” the Parmesan cheese topping. Delish!

10.16.18 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/23425/pesto-lasagna/ ... I put more work into this than I had to by making alfredo ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/19402/quick-and-easy-alfredo-sauce/ ... I only used a 9oz package of spinach & accidentally 1t salt instead of 1/2.  Surprisingly, not too much.  I'm pretty sure the mozzarella amount should read one pound, 4cups.  There seemed to be too much ricotta, but only because there wasn't enough mozzarella.   'Think ya could pass on that egg; dried it too much.   A cup of alfredo over the mozzarella would be a nice addition.  Even with about half the amount of spinach, the pesto flavor wasn't very prominent.   I like trying different recipes for familiar dishes.   Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Great change to a normal beef lasagna. I made my own pesto and put pumpkin slices amongst the sheets. I didn't layer the sauces with and just mixed it all into one mixture. Very nice :-)

This recipe is a bit challenging because the pasta tends to stick together when boiled. It was hard for me to get the right amount of pesto and cheese between layers. This is a very rich dish.

Didnt really like this at all. I had added hamburg to the recipe to be heartier but the sweet taste with pesto and alfredo didnt agree with my. I would omit the nutmeg.
