I love a good Rob  Roy but prefer it "perfect" which is 1 Tbls sweet vermouth and 1 Tbls dry vermouth instead of all sweet. I usually skip the bitters. Always garnish with a cherry. Shake and serve straight up in a martini glass.

My neighbor tells me this is pretty darn good, 4/5 stars. I didn't try it because I don't care for whiskey. Pretty drink!

3.28.18  I know, I know, but I had to modify this drink.  Iâ€™ve always added a little dry vermouth to a Rob Roy and added more sweet vermouth to give me the perfect cocktail today!
