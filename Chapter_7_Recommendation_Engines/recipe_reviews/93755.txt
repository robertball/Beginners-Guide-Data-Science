I made this last night and my family raved over this! I did not feel that this sauce is more like broccoli/cheese soup as the consistency was much thicker and tastier. I did add more garlic as we are a garlic family and did not add onions because our children do not enjoy them. I will make this again and I'm sure my family will be asking for it again as well!

This had great taste and will make this again. I have a problem with cheese and chicken lumping together when I melt cheese. So when I made this I added the milk and cheese to the flour mixture and let the cheese melt then added it to the chicken and veggies. I cooked the veggies in olive oil (calories) and and used chicken boullion b/c that's what I had

Okay - one MAJOR difference between my picture and the recipe - I realized after chopping the other vegetables that my broccoli was no longer edible. I used thawed frozen peas instead. I used two large chicken breasts which were more than enough. Very tasty recipe - comfort food - perfect for this cold snowy evening.

This recipe was very good. My Husband loved it. I omitted a few things like the mushrooms green onions and broccoli. (He's not a fan of veggies). I also only used 8oz of chicken broth. I will definetly make this again!

This sauce is more like broccoli/cheese soup. I would recommend a lot less chicken broth. Also add the broccoli later so the pieces stay together and are not too soft.

Very good recipe; i made several substitutions as i didn't have all the ingredients on hand. First I sauteed 1/2 a yellow onion and the 5 garlic cloves in 2 tbsp butter. I omitted the mushrooms and broccoli but added 1/2 bag of frozen peas. Instead of adding the chicken broth in with the veggies i gradually added the broth to the butter/flour mixture in the saucepan; also added about another 1/4 cup of flour to even the proportions out. My whole family liked this meal and I would definitely make it again!

I substituted all over this recipe. We used whole grain shells instead of linguine whole wheat flour vs. regular bleached no broccolli no onions and extra cheese. The family loved it. even my insanely fussy 5 year old dove right in. Next time I might lay off the garlic a bit but otherwise it was great. Like chicken mac n cheese. Score one for moms with picky eaters!

This was a really easy and simple recipe for me. I loved how this was a light version of an Alfredo sauce not as rich and creamy. I also used corn starch instead of flour which was much easier to mix and less lumpy.

i could see how some people would think this is good. It does not have any taste to it at all. It is just mac and cheese with linguine pasta.

Great recipe! I was a little concerned about poaching the chicken as opposed to sauteeing it but it was fine. I added ranch dressing at the end for more flavor and my family loved it.

We dont like onions so omitted them. Used shredded mozzarella instead thats what i had on hand. Used all the pots in the house (but cleaned up before hubby came home...haha) Turned out to be a pretty good dish but a lot of ingredients i was working it... Thanks for sharing!

Delish! I added peas because my children eat anything with peas in it! (I know weird...). It was a hit! My oldest (9) had seconds middle one complained about the broccoli but got seconds (minus broc) and my 3 year old loves his noodles! Yay!
