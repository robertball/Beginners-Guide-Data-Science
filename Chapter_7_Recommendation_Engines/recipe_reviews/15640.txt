I have had this in a fancy restaurant, & this recipe tastes better!  I cut the chicken into strips & served on top of thin spaghetti though.

It was pretty good...I changed a few things.  I cut the chicken into strips and sauteed with garlic and scallions first then set aside and prepared the "gravy" before adding the chicken back in.  I didn't have any artichokes handy so I added black olives for a little flair.  I served alongside broccoli and my family loved it.  Next time, I'll add a little more onion.

I made this dish with only one change - olive oil instead of butter to make it healthier. My family thought it was delicious. We liked the taste from the Worcestershire sauce. I'm adding this recipe to my collection and will make it again!

This was easy to make and it tasted wonderful. The only thing I will change the next time is to cut back on the liquid, so that the sauce will be thicker.

I thought that this was a relatively easy meal to cook considering how delicious and gourmet it turned out. The recipe is good as it is written, though I did halve it to 4 pieces of chicken, added garlic and fresh chopped tomatoes, and added some white wine to the sauce, as suggested by other reviews. Oh yeah, I also used baby bella mushrooms, as they cost the same as regular white mushrooms and I prefer the flavor. I served this over angel hair pasta with a side of  asparagus sauteed in oil, soy sauce, garlic, jalapenos, and sesame seeds. Overall, the dinner was delicious! My lovely lady enjoyed it so much that I renamed it "Stepher's Chicken." (sorry KJ :) Thanks for the great recipe!

Really very good.  I only had thin sliced chicken breasts, so I rolled them up with a little swiss cheese in the middle.  After that I followed the directions exactly.  Next time I might  add a little white wine and some chopped tomatoes.  Thank-you!

Hmmm. 3.5 stars, but it needs a little something so I knocked it down to 3. Had to add lots of black pepper. Easy to make and I will def. try again w/ something to spice it up. Thanks for the recipe!

I marinated the chicken overnight in beer and Allegro marinade. Then,after i put the mushrooms and artichoke hearts in the skillet, there was no room for the chicken. So i baked it in a big pan for 35 min. at 350. Loved by all! One of our faves.

I took the advice of some of the other users and added a little white wine, & fresh garlic.  I cut way back on the butter to make it a little healthier and it turned out great.  I served it over angel hair pasta with some fresh chopped basil.  My family loved it!

This was very greasy. If I made it again I would probably put less butter/oil in it. I also had to put more flour in than initially called for.

I didn't add the artichokes, but added more mushrooms instead. Worked out great! Tastes a lot like the ones they serve you in restaurants, I like the consistency of the sauce. Perhaps would really wow if it had a more novel flavour. Next time I might add some paprika or chilli.

I followed the basic recipe but seasoned chicken thighs with salt pepper paprika and Montreal chicken seasoning first  Also added 1/4 cup marsala wine.Didn't have artichokes sliced in 1/2 medium onion before simmering  Served over pasta- great!

Absolutely delicious.  The chicken was so tender.  I added a bit more flour to and a little less chicken broth make the sauce the thicker.

We have used this recipe for several years and love it. We usually add more flour to thicken it up. It is very easy and tastes great with wild rice.

This was delicious.  I didn't have any artichokes handy so I added 3 chopped cherry peppers plus about a tablespoon or so of the juice from the cherry pepper jar.  Served with broccoli, it makes a perfect (and easy) dinner.

This was a hit with my family. I changed a few things. I cut chicken into strips, used veg oil instead of butter and sauteed some garlic first. I did not use Worcestershire sause. I filled whole wheat pita's and added some feta cheese crumbles. It was so yummy!! This will be a must at least once a month!

This recipe is really good. Works best with rice, noodles don't soak the sauce. I've used mushrooms, onions, bok choy, green beans, broccli, red peppers, green peppers and garlic in different combos. Works very well with any veggies. The one thing I did different was season the chicken with lemon pepper, garlc, parsley and pepper. I enjoy more flavor and the sauce is unbelievable good with the extra seasoning. Next time I think I'll try Wondra instead of flour to make the sauce more like a gravy. Also I've used thighs and quarter legs. Thighs are cheaper and more tender. Thanks KJ!!!

Very much enjoyed this recipe today. My 10 and 8 year olds loved it, too. I made it gluten-free by using coconut flour instead of the regular. Added a dash of wine. Thanks!

I did follow reviewer suggestions to omit the flour and lemon juice...  This was a BIG MISTAKE!  This was the only dish I've ever made for my husband (in almost 7 years!)that we wouldn't/couldn't bring ourselves to eat.  Unfortunately, we won't try this one again, even using the original recipe.  (Sorry!)

I have been making this recipe for over a year now because it is my family's favorite (and company, too!)  I have only changed a couple of things: deleted the lemon juice, added a touch more chicken broth and extra artichokes.

This was tonight's dinner and hubby and I have happy tummies! I scaled it down to 3 servings.  Only changes were sliced baby bellas for the mushrooms,  chicken thighs because that's what I had on hand, and a little minced garlic because I add garlic to almost everything.  Other than those small changes,  I followed the recipe exactly and it was great served with couscous and roasted sweet potato. Thanks for a great recipe!

Sauce was a little thin, had to thicken it up a bit with cornstarch. Very good flavor.

Thought it was missing something. Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out bland. If I make it again I will do what others suggested and add garlic,white wine, and maybe a little more lemon.

I thought this was great.  I think next time I am going to try substituting a little white wine for some of the chicken broth.

Very good!  I halved this recipe because my husband and I don't care for leftovers.  I also followed other people's tips and used garlic while browning the chicken (which was cut up into smaller pieces).  I didn't have artichokes but it was still delicious.  I just served it with biscuits from a can and it was instant comfort food.  I am putting this recipe in my permanent file.

This was very good. I did change it a bit. I omitted the artichokes and added onions which I had sauteed. I think that plus some powdered garlic and a splash of white wine added more flavor to what might have been otherwise too bland. Will definitely make again.

I love artichokes & mushrooms so I had to try this recipe. It was good but seemed to be missing something. I'll make again but try adding wine and perhaps a little less Worcestshire. My husband thought it was a little too lemony although I liked it.

This turned out really good. I used white wine instead of lemon juice and next time I think I'll use a bit more floor to get it to thicken just a bit more, and more artichokes.

Well I had to try to doctor this a lot, and still it wasn't that great. I added some white wine, italian seasoning, garlic, ect... just to try and get some flavours happening, but it didn't really get much better. Sorry, just not that wonderful :(

We love fresh and marinated artichokes but never cared for can.  But I heard artichokes are healthy so tried this recipe and loved it.  The artichokes lost their canny taste and I will definitely make again and again.
