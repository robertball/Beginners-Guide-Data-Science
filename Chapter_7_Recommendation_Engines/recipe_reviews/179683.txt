a great starter recipe, I love this! I made just a few changes...added fresh, minced garlic, parsley and red onion as well as chopped fresh tomatoes to the blender mix. I also used whole milk and regular cream cheese to make the sauce more decadent. And finally, I poured the sause and chix over linguine...very tasty! 125 grams is half a package of 8 oz cream cheese.

My whole family liked this recipe. Even my anti-pepper 8-year old daughter. I sprinkled a little garlic salt n the chicken while cooking it and I added a little more milk to the pepper mixture. I served this with pan fried garlic bread and everyone enjoyed. I will definately make this again. Quick and easy and I loved all the fresh basil. I was a little worried about it having no reviews but it was worth it. Delish!!

I made this two weeks in a row... once with chicken, then with shrimp. Delicious as is and so easy. The only thing I added was a little salt and pepper!

Yum. I did use garlic cream cheese and added some onions to the cooked chicken but the base of the roasted red peppers and basil cream sauce was amazing! Love this recipe and will definitely make again.

This has absolutely no flavor!  It tastes like cardboard and watered down milk.

I really liked this recipe, but I am a fan of cream cheese based cream sauces.  The peppers and basil gave it a nice texture, and it looks nice to serve it with a fresh basil leaf on top!

This is a good recipe,but it gave me a lot of inspiration to create something even better. I sauteed green pepper, sweet onions, mushrooms, and garlic. Then, I tossed in the roasted red peppers, basil, and fresh thyme. I grilled two chicken breasts and I had three sausages I popped on the grill. I didn't blend anything,but kept the sauce mixture with the grilled veggies. I added a teaspoon of salt and 1/2 t. of smoked paprika to the sauce. After draining the pasta, I tossed everything together. I added about 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese. Delicious! My family loved it!

This was very good.  I added 4 garlic cloves in the blender with the peppers.  Used 2% milk instead of skim and regular parmesan instead of light.  Also added freshly cracked pepper.

I used whole wheat spaghetti instead of penne. I substituted Neufchatel for the cream cheese and used half and half instead of skim milk. This pasta was delicious! Next time I will for sure add a bit more liquid as it was more dry than I would have liked. Also, I did not blend in the food processor, I simply finely chopped the peppers and combined everything by hand. Will make again for sure!

Great Recipe.  A few changes.  I used herb and garlic cream cheese instead of regular (YUM!).  I roasted my own red pepper under the broiler in my oven (didn't have any jarred).  I had no fresh basil so I used about 1tbsp dry.  You don't need as many herbs when using H&G cream cheese.  I also saute'd onions and 2 cloves then added them to the pepper mixture when I blended it.  My whole family loved it!

I won't be making this one again. However, I must admit that I'm not the biggest fan of red peppers.  I like them in moderation, but this was red peppers with a little bit of all the other ingredients.

Fabulous!!! My husband and I both loved this  sauce. It was so creamy and bursting with flavor. I used a mixture of Thai and sweet basil and deglazed the pan with white wine after cooking the chicken. Definitely will make this again. Thanks! :)

I think this recipe is pretty good for a roasted red pepper sauce. You have to like peppers for this one. I too added about 2 cloves of garlic, salt and pepper to the mixture. I mixed it all in my food processor-didn't feel like getting the blender down. At the end I mixed the whole wheat pasta with the processed pepper mixture and warmed it through. I then added a bit of cream to finish it and about 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese. I also didn't add chicken because I didn't have any defrosted. Quick and easy.

Meh...as written it was ok. It was bland so the next time I made it I added some Garlic to it and it was better- still not our favorite though.

Do not change a thing- this is a tasy, easy, throw it all in a blender recipe that works perfect for those last minute dinners.  De-Licious!

This was a good base recipe but would have been bland without a bit of tweaking.  I added garlic, thyme and oregano to the chicken and added some salt to the sauce.  We really liked this but still thought it needed some acidity, like maye some wine.  We will make it again with some more tweaking!

NO one liked it, the flavor was not good. I made the recipe exact. The only thing that was good was the chicken without that sauce on it.

It needs something. If I make it again, I'll try adding garlic, pepper and salt like someone else mentioned. In the meantime, I sprinkled it with some cayenne pepper.

This was ok. Good on a night I had all the ingredients and didn't want to order food or go grocery shopping. I just now realized that it calls for only half a cup of basil, I think I read it as 2 cups! Oops. The flavor of this is very strong, probably from all the basil of course.

Very easy and very tasty!! I shredded the chicken instead of cutting it in cubes. Awesome!
