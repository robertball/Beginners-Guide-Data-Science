I loved the taste of these!!  I soaked the beans in water over night and the next day I threw all the ingredients into a slow cooker and let it go all day long.  It turned out awesome!  I will definitely make these again.

I like it that there is no cured meat in this bean dish, and I thought it was okay. I wasn't sure about the cinnamon flavor with the beans and tomato sauce. I think I will try it again without it next time. Thanks for posting this recipe.

Excellent... even my meat and potatoes husband loves these.  I use organic sucanat in place of the brown sugar and tomato puree instead of sauce.

This is one of the better recipes for baked beans that I have found.  I cut out the sugar and used canned beans (rinsed) instead of dry.  I can just throw all the ingredients in a slow cooker and have a very tasty meal a few hours later!  Make sure you don't do that with dry beans... the tomatoes will stop them from cooking.

The spices were way too strong in the sauce. Ended up tasting like apple pie with tomato sauce.

I did not care for this at all. I cooked it according to the directions and the beans still needed to be cooked longer.  It didn't taste right.  I reheated the next day in a saucepan and added ketchup, more brown sugar and garlic powder.

They weren't too bad.  The tomato flavour was a tad overwhelming.  I would have enjoyed them more if there was another component to the sauce that competed with the tomato.

These beans were good, but the tomato sauce throws off the recipe. If the tomato sauce were omitted, and everything else was used to make beans, I think they would be perfect!  Other people commented that the beans were "too tomato-y"

I soaked the beans for a few hours in the fridge first, used 1/4 t. powdered ginger & 1/8 t. allspice instead of the cinnamon & nutmeg, and subbed canola oil for the recipe's olive oil.  I don't like garlic in my BB, so I skipped that.  Reduced the tomato sauce/puree (NOT pasta sauce) to about 23 oz.  W/ all the sugar, regular onions were fine--didn't need sweet ones.  W/ the changes, simple and tasty.

These are tangy, tangy beans. If you don't like tangy, but prefer sweet, don't use this recipe. The cinnamon and nutmeg conflict with the tangy so much, my kids didn't even like them. I managed to salvage them by adding more brown sugar, garlic, and the key - yellow mustard. The mustard seemed to counteract the spices really well. I liked that they didn't have meat, and I might try making them again without the spices, and a smaller batch.

I made this for a bbq potluck and it was a big hit. I sauteed the onions and garlic and I used 4 15oz cans of beans, drained, and added a bit of garlic powder too.  I ommitted the cinnamon and nutmeg and added about a tablespoon extra of molasses and baked it at 375 for about 2 hours.  I also had to add salt at the end.

I found this recipe to be just awful. I followed the directions exactly, but the resulting beans were inedible. I will not be making this again.

The cinnamon and nutmeg are a nice change from your usual baked beans.  I actually liked the flavor, but my husband thought it was so-so..  Nothing wrong with modifying it a bit and leaving it out if you want.  I also thought the bay leaves were a stroke of genius!

I read all of the reviews beforehand and decided to leave out the nutmeg and cinnamon. Sure glad I did too because these were just right for us without them. I had a few partially used bags of beans that I wanted to use up so I used that hodgepodge mix which included pinto, navy, and great northern. This recipe will work for any type  of bean you prefer or happen to have on hand. I baked in the oven as directed but will try the crockpot method that others used next time. Mine came out soupy as others mentioned as well so next time I will only use 3 cans of tomato sauce and see how that works. This one is hard to rate fairly since I omitted the nutmeg and cinnamon but without those 2 ingredients this was a 4 star.

I loved these beans! I will definitely be making them again. Next time I'll try replacing the brown sugar with maple syrup and see how that turns out. Finally a great recipe for beans without the cured meat.

No one at this at the BBQ & I was embarrassed that I brought it.  I wanted a baked bean recipe without bacon and this came up.  I wondered about the cinnamon & nutmeg but followed the recipe anyway - it smelled like pumpkin pie as it was baking.  It looked like baked beans and then you'd get this unpleasant surprise when you tasted it.

I think what you're looking for flavor wise with the cinnamon and nutmeg actually comes from something like apples and green peppers and red peppers. I plan on making it by substituting the cinnamon and nutmeg with those!! :) great recipe! I'm excited to make it! I will share a photo! Do you have an IG account? I'd like to follow you if so! Thanks

Cinnamon is an interesting twist to this, I liked it.  Will reduce the tomato sauce by 1 can next time, it made the dish too "soupy". Plan to double the amount of mustard.

I loved this recipe.  All ingredients I had in my pantry.  It was the perfect mix of sweet and savory.  My two year old went crazy over it.  I would definitely make it again.  Add it to your recipe box, you will not be sorry.

People who are used to baked beans out of a can may not understand why there's cinnamon/nutmeg in the recipe.  It's a recipe-specific thing, like adding chocolate or coffee.

I threw all the ingredients together too like the first reviewer said (Anna); but, now I'm afraid they won't cook, because doesn't anything acidic (vinegar) keep them from cooking ? Been on stove an hour now... not soft...

Agree that the spices were too strong.  Will add far less or just no cinnamon and nutmeg if I make this again.  To fix, I added some ketchup and salt.  Then they were great!
