I made my own pastry shells which are a little larger than the store bought shells so the recipe made 3 mini pies instead of 4.  They came out beautifully and would be a nice addition to a brunch.  The family thought they were tasty.

This recipe was so easy to get together and we thought was delicious!  This would be great for a crowd because it is individually portioned and  cooks super fast!    I think they would also be great with a little green onion or jalapeno added.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!
