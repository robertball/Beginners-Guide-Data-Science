I would recommend NOT making alterations to this soup because the purpose of the set recipe is to lose weight.  I did lose weight when I made this (it was for a vacation), and it tasted great!!  I checked with a local hospital, and they said this recipe is used for overweight patients to get them to lose weight rapidly to prepare for surgery.  I would recommend this recipe to anyone!

I've been making this for my boyfriend for about three months now.  The only thing I do different is to add ground turkey.  He eats a light breakfast of whatever he wants, a light sandwich for lunch and the soup for dinner.  He likes to add some heat in the form of Tabasco or different dried peppers as it heats on the stove EVERY NIGHT.  He's lost over 50 pounds!  I'm sick of making it, but if it's working and he's enjoying it, I'll keep a pot of it in the fridge.

First of all, a minor caveat-- I've never had to diet, since I have a pretty fast metabolism, so I can't really compare this to other diets. BUT... Several years ago, I started a new job and found myself sending out for fast food for lunch every day, eating it at my desk. All of a sudden, my clothes started to... *shrink*. I stepped on the scxale and saw that I'd gained 15 pounds!!! I panicked!

Found this "diet" and decided to try it. The weight just went away! It does get a little boring... But it's tasty and painless; think about adding different spices and/or herbs to the soup to vary it... chili powder, curry, etc. Now, I *did* have to change the way I had lunch once I lost the weight... No more fast food breakfasts and lunches (except for the occasional emergency...), trying to get out and walk a bit a few times a week at lunch... But it did get the weight off and-- with my revamped lunch hour-- kept it off.

This is a very good for you and tasty soup, however, when I used to make this some time ago, I also thought that it lacked something or needed a little more flavor.  To give it the flavor it needs, I decided an old trick my grandmother use to use in her vegetable soup.....add a jar or can of sauerkraut in place of some of the cabbage and it gives it just the zing it needs.  Other than that, I left the recipe pretty much as is, I just didn't do a whole lot of measuring, just threw it all together and let it cook.  Enjoy!

I ate this soup for months when the recipe came out years ago.  You have to eat nothing else to lose weight....and I did, about 30 lbs.!!  I gave the recipe to everyone at work and they all lost weight too.  Besides which, it is an excellent soup (not so much for breakfast as we did back then!) but I still like it.  I have added chick peas to the recipe for some protein.  Also some lean hamburger goes well.  Thanks for the memories!

I make this when I'm looking to lose weight quickly. I tried to follow the recipe as close as I could, adding minced garlic and omitting the canned green beans, but adding more celery and carrot. (Ew. Am I the only person who can't stand canned green beans?) I also added basil, oregano, thyme and a couple bay leaves. It dosen't affect the fat burning process to add a little flavor, does it? ;) I used my biggest stock pot and it came right up to the edge. So, plan accordingly. TIP: Make sure you are close to a bathroom about an hour or so after you eat this. This cleans out your system VERY well. EDITED: One pot of this soup lasted me one week, eating it three meals a day. To make it more filling, I add just a little cubed chicken breast. Just in a week, I can feel my pants getting looser. Good stuff. ANOTHER TWO WEEKS LATER: Down ten pounds!

Very good.  I used my food processor for most of the chopping, adjusted the seasonings to my personal taste, and simmered for a couple of hours.  I froze individual servings and have been bringing it to work for lunch.  It's very filling.  The only thing I would/will do differently next time is transfer some of the soup to a blender and process until smooth, then add back into the soup for a creamier texture.

The amount of cabbage in this recipe is overpowering. I like cabbage, but this is too much!  If I make this again I will likely only use 1/4 the amount of cabbage and add other healthy veggies like squash and zucchini to make up for it.  I will also cut the recipe in half as it does cook entirely too much... 

The thing that makes this soup a "fat burner" is you can eat ten bowls in one day and still be below 1000 calories. The carbs are low and there is no fat. If you make variations that don't include fat, carbs, and calories than you should still have the "fat burning" effect of this soup.

LOVE IT!! ADDED FEW SHAKES OF TEXAS PETE HOT SAUCE AND WORCESTERSHIRE AND LEMON-PEPPER SEASONING.  FOR A BURST OF FLAVOR & STILL HEALTHY ADD 1/2LB OF FROZEN,PLAIN (NOT BREADED)OKRA.  ALSO, I DIDN'T COOK THE SOUP TOO LONG...THE VEGGIES WERE STILL AL DENTE AND SLIGHTLY CRUNCHY...SO DELICIOUS.  NO TROUBLE GETTING YOU DAILY QUOTA OF VEGGIES WITH THIS RECIPE...I COULD EAT IT ALMOST EVERY DAY.  OH, DON'T CUT YOUR ONIONS & CARROTS TOO SMALL CAUSE CHUNKIER IS BETTER IN THIS ONE.

I add a few different herbs and spices to each batch to give it an international twist. For example, I add chopped cilantro, a little chili powder, and cumin to give it a Southwestern flavor; some oregano, basil, and fresh garlic for an Italian taste; a little curry powder mixed into the cooking soup and chopped fresh mint leaves for garnish on top when serving to give it a unique Moroccan flavor; shrimp or fish boullion, a little soy sauce, and some fresh bean sprouts, minus the tomatoes for an exotic Oriental sensation; chanterelle mushrooms and a pinch of thyme and rosemary minus the tomatoes for a wonderful French taste. All very yummy! Also on the skim milk day add some non-fat plain yogurt to soup.  Also a good tip is to make a banana and milk smoothy on banana and milk day.  All these tips help make my 7 days alot easier.

I didn't use a large head of cabbage, and it takes much longer than 45 minutes for the veggies to simmer and get tender, but, the longer the simmer time, the nicer the flavors blend together.  This freezes so well.  My husband is a diabetic so I froze a whole bunch of single servings so when he wants a healthy pick me up, he just has to nuke it.  Pssssttt...this makes a LOT of soup!!!  Use a big stock pot for best results.

Hands down this was great, I did take other reviewers suggestions and spiced it up a little, otherwise it would of indeed been bland.  I added: 1 t Chili Powder, 1 t Cumin, 1t Turmeric, 1 t Oregano, 1 t lemon Pepper, 1 t Italian Seasonings, 1/4t chives, 1T Parsley, 1 T Garlic Powder and 2 Bay Leaves.  I also Used v8 Vegetable juice instead of Tomato Juice.  I had to make this in my 20qt Stock Pot because it made so much!  To cut down on time I washed and all veggies and then largely chopped them and threw them into my Food Processor, this took no time at all!  In Minutes I had all the prep done and then threw it all into the pot, added my spice mixture and about 2 1/2 qrts water to cover and let it come to a boil, took about 1 hr, then reduced heat to low and let it simmer on low for about 15 minutes and it was done.  This was so super easy to throw together and there is tons left over!  I will refrigerate half and freeze half.  I did the calculations for calorie, etc and mine came to: Ea 2 c serving has about 62 cal, .12g of fat, 13 carbs, 3 fibers and 3 proteins!  Oh yeah, I used all low sodium stuff, better for the heart! So, we will see if this works to help reduce weight, but I know that one 2 c bowl filled me up so much that I couldnt eat another morsel if I tried!  Low cal and tastes great, this is a winner in my book, hands down! Thank you for posting this recipe!

I add a little red pepper or jalapeno to spice it up and sub the vitamin enhanced V-8 juice for tomato.  A good carb to add is garbanzo beans.  It adds an good texture to the soup without adding too much starch.  I use this soup to get in my "5 a day"' and have a small bowl as a morning or afternoon snack if I have really bad munchies, or as an appetizer to diminish my appetite before going out to eat. (we have a lot of dinner parties in my office!)  It does make a lot but freeze it individual tupperwares bowls and take a bowl along to microwave at work!  Also, spice at will.  It won't add any calories. I like to add a little garlic to mine.

I made the soup as written.  If you are trying to loose a few pounds, why change the recipe.  That is probably why you need to lose weight.

I am boiling the bejeezus out of a HUGE pot of Cabbage Fat-Buring Soup. All the reviews, well, maybe not all, there are 235. Let's just say the first 2 or 3. Weeellllll. The reviews I read say it has the ability to be pretty bland. NOT THIS TIME!! I put 5 tsp. minced garlic, a whole stalk thing...bunch of celery, and EVERY herb known to modern man. Well... maybe not guite that many but, everything I could get my hands on. I just tasted it, Oh MY GOOD LORD. I've died and gone to stew Heaven. I can't put the cabbage in it 'cause some of the little ones here don't have a hankerin' to eat cabbage. So, I am boiling the cabbage in another pan with some tomato sauce and onion and will put a bed of cabbage in my bowl then add the soup over that. This is gonna' be so good. I've browned some smoked sausage for those who don't need the fat burning properties. Gotta' go check my masterpiece!!

This soup is really delicious, and easy to adjust to your personal tastes. But just for the record, the soup itself does not make a person lose weight. Eating the low calorie soup in place of a higher calorie food does. It would be very unhealthy for a person to live on this soup alone. The body needs protein and fat to function correctly. So, for a meal I would definitely suggest adding a lean protein, and healthy fat.

What a fantastic recipe. I put cod in it the first day, sole on the second day and halibut on the third day, and salmon on the fourth day. On the fifth day I go back to day one and so on. It tastes wonderful. Instead of green bean I use spinach. I have lost 22 pounds in two weeks and feel great. My blood glucose is now normal.

As I was lounging with my coffee this morning while browsing this site, feeling sorry for myself for the several pounds I've gained during the Christmas season, I came upon this recipe quite by accident and considered it a hint from heaven! This recipe can, of course, be played with to suit individual tastes, just as I did. First of all, I just basically rummaged the kitchen to use what I had on hand and threw it all in the Crock Pot -- beef broth, V8, a little red wine, Italian seasoning, the dry soup mix (never would have thought of that!), minced garlic, sliced fennel, celery, onion, zucchini and, of course, cabbage. It isn't the best soup I've ever made, but it is good, and certainly an excellent soup if you're watching carbs and calories. Thank you so much for posting the recipe and giving me the inspiration to get my post-holiday diet off to a good start!

I love the taste of this soup which is strange for a meat and potato guy like me.  I've made a few changes.  The first is I add 2-3 15oz cans of chick peas for their protein which is needed to build muscle mass which burns calories more efficiently.  I like tomatoes so I use two 28 oz cans.  Sometimes instead of two cans of tomato juice I'll replace one with spicy V-8 or Sacramento vegetable juice.  I will add a couple of tablespoons of beef base to give a richer flavor.  You don't taste the meat but you do get a heartier flavor.  There's salt in the base but since this is such a large yielding recipe the salt added shouldn't make much of a difference. Lately I've also started adding small cubed beef which I brown first.  Any beef you like is ok, just whatever is on hand. I don't chop the veggies too small and don't cook it as much.  30 minutes is more than enough.  You lose less of the nutrients this way.  Before you start on this recipe there are two things you should be aware of.  It takes a long time to prepare with all the chopping of veggies and, as I said, it's a large recipe.  You're going to need a large stockpot.  Because it does take so long I don't make it as often as I should but I have lost weight with this recipe, enjoyed doing it with such a flavorful recipe and wish everyone else luck achieving the same or better results.  I eat one to two 2cup servings a day and am careful with anything else I eat.  Down 15-20#, another 85 to go.  This recipe hasn't done it

I learned this recipe, in the 1970's, from Weight Watchers (it was in their cookbook and people on the diet learned about it quickly, at the meetings).  I learned to use V-8, diluted, as a base, and to add Worcestershire sauce, zucchini, and yellow squash, and to use a variety of non-starchy veges.  One thing that made a huge difference for me, is to add a heaping dollup of fat-free cottage cheese to the bowl of hot soup - much more satisfying, and takes the squeak off the veges!

This soup goes with a 10 day diet. I couldn't make it past the fourth day because I was so hungry. Day one you are suppose to eat as much of this soup and raw vegetables you want. Day two is as much soup and fruits as you can eat. Day three is soup AND fruits and veggies. Day four you can eat as much soup as you can but reward yourself with a huge baked potato. It said that if you haven't cheated by now you should have lost at least 7 lbs. After day four you get to start eating some meat. But eat all the soup you can. Like I said earlier I couldn't last day four. This soup was not satisfying to me. No matter how I tried to doctor it up. I did lose a few pounds.

I just made it today. I agree with the whole, it is a huge recipe and it does take a long time to simmer. I added red pepper flakes to mine in the last 40 minutes of simmering because it didnt taste like it had enough flavor, but now i regret it because after letting it simmer even more it came out wonderful and the underlying taste would have been great without the red pepper. it was very filling and i can see how it would lead to weight lose. i will update later with the results! *******EDIT****** So, it is now 2 weeks later. I ate this soup for the first 5 days, and then ate it as every other meal for anotehr 3 days (4 meals a day) and then ate it  once a day for the rest of the time until i ran out... I am down 10 pounds in a little over 2 weeks! I did start doing an extra 30 minutes of walking durning that time also, but there is no way all the weight lost could account for that!

I have used this recipe for years - It is really a wonderful, healthy way to lose weight. The idea behind it, is you have at least one bowl of this soup before each meal (breakfast included!). You are not limited to only three, because the more you eat, the more you will lose (honest, tis really works!) My advice to anyone who wants to try this is that you make the entire recipe(it makes a LOT!) but separate the finished soup into daily portions and freeze. This way, you only reheat each portion once, which helps it retain the flavor. If you cook it too much, it tends to lose alot of its appeal. Also, As long as you stick to the same basic recipe as far as the vegitables are concerned, you can add as many varied spices as you want - I'll cook some wit fresh italian style spices, and some with more spicy creole or mexican spices. yum yum! I lost over 50 pounds with this soup, and never felt hungry!

My husband goes out of town for 2 weeks on business a few times a year. So, instead of being lonely, I plan healthy home spa-like activities for myself.  First, I always make  a delicious 1/2 recipe of this healthy soup.  It helps clean and balance my system.  Then after work, I try to get in some extra exercise, a luxurious tub soak with aromatherapy, mix up a homemade facial, invite a few friends for a movie night, do the nails, play relaxing music after work, tackle some of the clutter, enjoy a good book, and get good sleep.  When he's back, I am rested and feeling healthier.  I'm ready then to hear about his adventures and take good care of him.  Including this soup in a healthy diet is a good way to take care of yoursef for the people you love.

I wanted to be able to come home to dinner, so I prepped this and tossed it all in the crock pot on low before work.  I halved (most of) the recipe and chose to leave out the celery because I just don't like it.  I left out the green bells because I'm an idiot and forgot to pick them up at the grocery store.  I knew I'd like a little kick, so I chose to use Hot & Spicy V8 for my tomato juice.  I also chose to use diced tomatoes, rather than whole, per personal preference.  This is a super filling soup.  I just ate a small bowl and I'm FULL.  I can see how this would be great when you're counting calories.  I don't LOVE it, but it's very tasty and will make a lot of low cal lunches for me over the next few weeks!   THANKS for sharing, Nell!

I have made this numerous times, only changing up a few things. I add already seasoned diced tomatoes. Be wary of using dry onion soup mix because it has added salt which is not good, instead substitute 1/4 cup minced onion, 2 tablespoons low sodium dry instant beef broth and 1/2 teaspoon onion powder.  To make mine soupy, I add 2 cans of tomato bisque soup to mine, about 5 cups of water.  I also add a couple dashes of garlic powder and 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper. Tomatoes are known to help satisfy hunger so you can eat this whenever you feel hungry and it doesn't ruin your diet.  I like the added slight "spice" of the red pepper.  Cabbage-soup-diet.com will give you the details of the 7 day diet and helpful tips to doing the diet the right way.  I am beginning day 3 of the diet and I have lost 5 pounds already.  Mind you...It does warrant having access to a bathroom.  I sure am missing my coffee (with creamer) though.

I'm reviewing this as a diet soup. As a basic vegetable soup, it's still really good, at least 3.5 stars. I made this soup as stated and divided it up into 10 big tupperware's. This has been my lunch for the last 10 days and that's the only real change I've made to my diet. After 10 days, I've already lost 5 lbs, no exercise or anything else and (the best part) I still think it's good. Normally after eating the same thing over and over, you get sick of it, but this is really tasty and I get stuffed. Really good!

This is great! It is indeed diet food, so keep your expectations in check. Lost 20+ lbs. eating this for lunch, one egg and one egg white for breakfast, and a sensible dinner. AND I joined a gym and worked out a lot. Good luck!

I've made this soup about four times now and this last batch is not just bearable...its delicious! I used high fiber V8 for juice, one can of stewed tomatoes, and one fresh tomato. didnt have the string beans this time. I grated in two big cloves of garlic and I had some leftover fennel stems, so I cut those up and threw them in also. Put some in the blender to get a thicker texture and then poured it back in the pot. Will freeze in small batches for lunch. Time for weight loss!

Ok. I know that if you change a recipe you cannot realy rate it but, I think this is a good base soup.  I love soups and people say that I make real good ones.  I ate my first bowl of this as is and it was ok, tasted like tomato juice with vegies, not like a meal.  I did make some changes by using spicy V8 instead of tomato juice.  But after the first try I added some garlic, oregano, and bay leaves.  I also thought that it needed some protein like chick peas, which I added and/or kidney beans.  I did not had any of those but I did have a can of black bean soup.  OMG! Those changes made it a meal.  Those will not impact the calorie intake but it will make a big change in flavor and nutrition.  Some crusty breat with a bit of butter and yummmm!

If I am correct, the rumor is that the combination of these ingredients cause a chemical reaction that burns the fat, so while others are correct that it can be added to and still used for weight loss, the "fat burn" effect is supposed to happen if you don't alter the recipe.    I don't know if this is a myth or not, but it is totally doing the trick for me.  I don't see how anybody could eat nothing but this soup, after a couple hours I feel jittery like I need food bad.  perhaps it is increasing my metabolism? But even with my midnight oreos I can't give up, and all my other high calroie habits, I am still losing weight.

This tastes great for diet soup, and I didn't even have enough V-8! I had about 2 cups for lunch and was really full.  I'm planning on just eating this for the next 3 days, so I'll come back to post if I lose any weight. ** Update ** Three days later, and I lost 4 pounds!

This is an excellent recipe but I did follow a few tips. I did put in less cabbage  as I felt the first time I made it there was just too much cabbage in it. I put in a 1/2 cabbage instead of the whole. Another suggestion I tried was adding ground turkey meat. That really made it tasty too. Also, I added zucchini instead of green beans. And just to give it a kick I added about a teaspoon of chopped garlic My husband loved this soup! Thanks to everyone for their helpful tips. Most especially to all the cooks out there who share their incredible recipes!

one more thing...this works! I needed to lose 10 lbs to get ultra slim, im a fitness instructor. Anyhow, I did this as my staple lunch for a month and ate under 500 calorie dinners....mostly stuffed BIG portabella mushroom caps with spinach sauteed in italian dressing. Very filling! For me, doing low low carbs slims me down. This combined diet had be shed 15lbs!! in a month. I dieted with this in August 2011 and have kept it all off by simply counting calories.

I sooo needed a pick me up soup for feeling icky! And this totally helped. My dad used to make this for him and I when we were on the "Dolly Pardon Diet" in the late 80's. And way, this is just as I remember it. Other then the can of green beans. But that doesn't matter. The only thing other then following it as close to a T as possible was not having whole peeled tomatoes or quarts of tomatoe juice. I had to sub, and glad I did, with 2 cans of Stewed tomatoes & V-8 juice. And after talking to may dad..he said he never used plain tomatoe juice in this recipe, always V-8. But it tastes just great. I think with the sub changes I had to make, I'll keep them the same on the next go around. Be sure....just a huge stock pot. Because I forgot how much this actually makes. It's really a delish recipe and it's a winner in my books. While myself and my girls love this style of soup, my guys aren't so much into cooked cabbage. But you will be surprise on how delicious it is even after about 3 days in the frig. It also freezes very well in smaller portions.

This soup is delicious if spiced up. HOWEVER!! WARNING!!! This soup has many natural sources of insulin and will drop your blood sugar level very rapidly. This is not safe for people with hypoglycemia. I just experienced this and am now having to take measures to stablize my blood sugar.

This works for weight loss but, I hate tomato soup and cabbage!  

For those looking to lose weight with this, here is what I recommend:

1.  make soup as directed.  use a bag of shredded cole slaw mix to save some time
2.  after soup has cooled, puree in a blender.
3.  drink 1 full glass as a meal replacement.  best to replace lunch and dinner.  if you replace  breakfast and lunch,  eat a sensible healthy low fat dinner.

basically, think the slim fast plan but use this soup as the smoothie.  it will work.

I substituted the green beans with a package of fresh mushrooms, and I used a can of imported, Italian crushed tomatoes. The results are very nice. This is a great base recipe.
MARCH 2015-This is my go-to recipe for staying slender... especially after a long winter and an indulgent holiday season. I use this recipe as a base. It's great. I add different vegetables each time. This time, I used two green peppers, one red pepper, one large daikon, two boxes of Pomi tomatoes, onions, soup mix, mushrooms, and cabbage. Blend it to make it more edible. You can drink it, too! Put in some hot sauce to give it a little zing. This is a very satisfying vegetable stew. I've been making it for decades. There's always a batch in my freezer. Blended and ready-to-heat for a quick, low calorie meal.

I'm happy to have found this recipe again! 35 years & 35 lbs. ago I use to make this soup! As a 35 year old widow with 3 children it was the daily lunch I took to work. It was cost efficient and tasted good! I used V8 juice which at that time was more expensive but was worth it. It wasn't a weight loss issue at that time, it was merely providing a satisficing low cost lunch for myself and keeping the food budget in line. I'm going to make this soup again today. Do I think it will get me back to a size 7..at 70? Not very likely, but I do remember enjoying the soup!

I'm hooked. This is going to become a staple in my household. First of all, I didn't try this recipe for the fat-burning qualities (but hey, no complaints on the low cal/fat properties). I just wanted a good cabbage soup recipe so I could eat a little healthier. Not only is this recipe delicious how it is, but I blended some of it with a little cream for my kids. They LOVED IT! Now I have a secret weapon to get them to eat their veggies! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Made this the other day as is except for the beans, but that was because I just forgot.  It came out great, and as I consumed it over the week, I would add hot sauce and whatever spices I felt like to have a little something different from day to day.  I'm making a second huge pot of it now, purposely left out the beans, doubled the cabbage with a head of red, added 5 jalapenpos, and it's cooking right now and smells great.  I also added 1 tbs each of coriander and cumin, 1 tsp each tumeric and ground black pepper.  Yummy!

This is a wonderful recipe & truly does jump-start your healthy eating goals  & help lower fat & cholesterol. It freezes great & tastes as good or better left over. I do keep the major components the same as they are designed to work to burn fat but I typically clean out my vegetable drawer & add whatever vegetables I have (in addition to what's listed here). I have added asparagus, squash, green onions, saurkrait, etc. I also use V-8 in place of tomato juice for the additional vitamins & spices. I sometimes will add a finely diced serrano or jalapeno pepper as I like spice (or use half spicy V-8 & half regular). This is a terrific recipe!

I added lemon juice and balsamic vinegar for extra flavor. Lemon juice is a diuretic and vinegar aids in digestion. I substituted fat-free, sodium-free chicken broth. Lastly, kidney beans have 4 times higher the amount of fiber than green beans so I subbed kidney beans. It's a great recipe and I am looking forward to seeing my weight loss in a few weeks!

First, it's worth pointing out as others have that this soup is "fat burning" not because of some magical ingredients that melt away the weight, but because it's so low calorie, that meals like this are basically calorie neutral. 

When it comes to food, everything can be evaluated in 3 categories.
- Is it filling? 
- Does it taste good?
- Is it low in calories?

Foods that are a "yes" in the above 3 are rare. A bowl of raw vegetables is filling and low in calories, but would be a bit bland. A cheesecake is filling and tastes good, but is high in calories.

This soup is the triple threat. Tastes great, very filling, and insanely low in calories. It's so low in calories it would almost be dangerous to only eat this everyday! 

Now on to the soup itself, a couple notes:

Size: As others have mentioned the total made is enormous- I thought my large  stock pot would be enough but had to split it into two. You need one of those huge pots, or two small ones.

Customizing: I decided to make tweaks right off the bat. As written it's probably fine. 

That's the great thing about this soup- you can tweak it however you want. I added worcestershire, A1 sauce, and used diced tomatoes with green chiles. Spices included basil, salt, pepper, garlic and a few others. You can do whatever you want!

And going on from there, don't be afraid to add even low calorie things. Some sliced turkey kielbasa would still have this be an absolutely insanely low calorie dish, but add to the taste.

Made 1/2 recipe and it still filled a good sized stock pot without the green beans. I used 2 11.5 oz cans of V-8 instead of tomatoes, 4 cups water, 2 T. Beef bouillion powder, 1/4 package onion soup mix. Instead of onions, used 3 leeks (much better flavor), and added a cup of leftover black-eyed peas, about 1/2 cup of nacho jalapenos (mild), dash of Worcestershire, and a pinch or so of red pepper flakes to jazz it up.  It is sooooo good!  A big bowl is very filling, nutritious and low cal, and it sure puts any canned soup to shame.

I used this soup several years ago to lose 20 pounds on a diet plan.  It is good, but it makes a LOT of soup, so plan on eating it about a week if you're the only one who is likes it. (My husband and kids won't touch it!) Thankfully it does keep well.  For a little variation, I made a large batch of wild rice in a separate kettle and added it on about the about the 3rd day.  This makes it kind of like a big cabbage roll soup...I enjoy it even on the 7th day, but then I'm ready for a break.  And it does take quite a while to clean and chop all the vegetables.  I also used a small bag of frozen green beans instead of canned.

Ignore the warnings of not changing the ingredients, go ahead! Canned tomato juice is high in sodium so I increase the low sodium beef broth. Often I include fresh or frozen veggies that's on sale at the market. I like to always include zucchini and yellow squash. I amp up the carrots & use a whole bunch of celery. I add veggies to the pot at different intervals because I like 'em on the crunchy side. I often change the seasoning packets to chile , taco or whatever suits my fancy. Stick with this without CHEATING and you'll loose weight.  There is a calender of what to eat on certain days that goes with this diet. You can get unhealthy if just eating this and this alone. You're allowed meats & bananas, for example but on specific days. Google "cabbage soup diet schedule" and follow the plan.

This was better than I thought it would be!  I did use spicy V8 instead of tomato juice and added chick peas for protein as other reviewers suggested.  Yummy!

I've only been doing this for a week and combined with walking every other night I can see a difference. I don't care for tomato juice and the 1st day I made the soup I didn't like it but after it sat overnight it mellowed out and tasted much better. I finished last week's batch and made a new batch yesterday with spicy V8 juice, garbanzo beans, and my boyfriend spiced it up for me with garlic, pepper and some other spices like parsley and Italian Seasoning. I think I will like this week's batch much better.

Pretty delicious! I made this soup today, and actually very pleasantly surprised,how good it tastes.I did changed it up but just a little bit, because i am looking to loose some wait by summer, and i have 3 months to do so. I used V8 juice, because i already had it in my fridge and did not want to spend money. I also used diced tomatoes instead of whole, because i don't like huge chunks of them in my soup. Unfortunately i did not find "envelope dry onion soup mix" at the store so i just used dried onion powder.And at the end i added some black pepper. This recipe does not need any salt added, because of the tomato juice i believe. My goal is to stay on this for 10 days and if i make it, ill continue with this diet. It better work, as all of you lady's say.

I have to give this a 4 because it is what it is, and tastes ok. 

Although after eating this for a week, I was not only sick of it, lol, but it ran through me for 2 weeks afterwards. That's how it works, you lose all your weight in the toilet!! LOL

1.6.09 Update - This freezes extremely well, makes a lot of soup for just a little effort.  Using the V8 spicy and the canned diced tomatoes with jalepno gives a nice kick!  I'll also top it with a sprinkle of fresh grated parmesan cheese on the days I'm feeling really hungry, or just need a good bowl of comfort food!  A great winter soup!  
Do try it!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I had totally forgot about this recipe until it showed up here today!  I've been thinking about losing a few pounds so I went out and bought the ingredients.
The only substitutions I made were to use Hot & Spicy V8 in place of the tomato juice, I used canned diced tomatoes with jalepeno's and I added about 1/2 lb of ground turkey and a can of chick peas for protein.  I also left out the green pepper as I don't care for it. I did not add water as the juice was
enough to nearly cover the veggies. And I simply let them cook down into the juice.  This is SOO good -- much better than the recipe of years past!
I may actually stick to the diet this time!
Thanks!  :-)

I was tempted to rate this 5 star, just because I was so hungry when I ate it...just started Weight Watchers.  It is very good, but not 5 star.  I like zesty so followed other readers advice and used tomatoes with hot peppers and Spicy V8.  Otherwise followed exactly as is.  Took about 45 minutes to cook the carrots (baby).  I did sprinkle a little shaved parmesan on top...bad me...but it was delicious.  If you aren't on WW I would consider serving this over Ramon noodles.

My mom made a similar cabbage soup a few weeks ago and I loved it. I am a soup person, big-time, especially tomato-based soups. I have this simmering on my stove right now and the aroma is driving me mad! I knew how much this would make, but I made the whole pot anyway. I'm planning on freezing what I won't need for the week and then thawing more as needed. Next time I'll probably add some squash or zucchini and an extra can of green beans. I also added a couple of cans of kidney beans for extra protein because I need the energy - not sure yet how those will taste in this soup, but it sounds good. I'm not trying to lose weight (yet) because I'm pregnant, but I'm planning on having this soup for lunch with a sandwich as a healthy meal. I'll also grab a bowl for midnight snacking. My husband has high cholesterol and needs to lose at least 30 pounds, so I'm going to start putting a cup of this soup in his lunch along with his sandwich and a piece of fruit. Hopefully that will help him in his quest to eat healthier meals.

This soup is actually delicious!!! I thought it was going to be a fat-burning practical soup, but even my skinny brother said I should make it again. 

My only challenge was not being able to find a big enough pot to fit all the ingredients. I used my largest pot, a big dutch oven, and I couldn't get anywhere near all the ingredients in.  Still, even with some of the extra veggies left out, it came out GREAT. Thanks so much for posting!!!

This was a good soup' especially with corn off of the cob instead of canned green beans (not a an of green beans in my soup) After tasting it as it was with the recipe, I made some changes. Firstly, I added garlic. I found the onion soup mix flavor to be over powering and had trouble balancing it out- eventually I accomplished this with an extra can of tomatoes and some cilantro. (Cilantro aids digestion so it is a good addition to a diet soup) Next time I make it I think I will add half of the packet and then slowly add more to my taste.  My roommates and I are trying to do a fruit and vegetable fast so it is great to have a delicious soup- thanks!

This soup was surprisingly very good. I did a serving of 15 and came out to be a whole lot of soup. I added one and a half packets of the onion soup and tomato flavored bouillon. I also added fresh green beans. I will continue to make this soup. I substituted for two meals and ate it every two to three hours for 5 days and lost five pounds. It is very good. Highly recommended if you want to lose a few pounds fast..

I have made this numerous times, and actually lost 25 pounds using it as well as exercising. I do though add a protein, I will cook ground turkey lightly seasoned, or chicken thigh, and even salmon pan seared and add to my bowl of soup. I also add other seasonal vegetables as well. I do not use the canned green beans. Every thing is fresh. Add a fresh fruit salad and a hand full of almonds and you are set.

I made this soup to help me and my hubby lose about 10 pounds.  I'm by far not overweight but like myself better about 10 pounds lighter.  THe soup tastes great... my daughter even loved it and wanted to be able to eat it as well and she is a picky eater.  I did add some spices to it as well.  I only plan on eating this for lunches only.  We shall see if I can lose that pesky 10 pounds.

I made half this recipe, added minced garlic and left out the green beans. Not for any particular reason other than I didn't have any in the pantry! I also used red peppers instead of green. I was surprised that I actually liked the taste of this soup. Although if I was eating it twice a day every day, I'd probably change my mind! I plan to freeze this soup in two serving containers so I can have it for a healthy lunch on days that I will probably splurge on dinner AND so I don't have to open a boring can of soup. I know a lady on WW who has used this eating strategy for years with this soup and she is still very fit for her age!

I gained 8 lbs over the holidays and thought this would be a quick fix.  I would rate this soup a 3 based on taste (didn't care for it, too tomatoey and no flavor) I am rating it 4 based on the fact this was written for weight loss, not gourmet taste.  I didn't eat enough of this to lose weight, so I guess I will have to do it right and eat healthy and exercise to lose those 8 pesky lbs.  Good luck to anyone else though!

I was surprised at how great this soup was - it tastes just like a vegetable soup should.  I was afraid of lack of flavor after reading other reviews, but that wasn't a problem at all.  I didn't use the dry onion soup mix since I didn't have any on hand, and I mostly used chicken broth (instead of beef) and I didn't use the green beans either.  I did add a diced jalapeno for spiciness, and you can really tell in the final soup.  I think the soup is great as is, but I also tried it with some Tobasco as another reviewer had suggested, and that's great too.  I used purple cabbage since it was what I had, and it turned the whole broth a cool funky purple color.

This is a great low calorie soup!  I always halve it, since I'm the only one who eats it, and it still makes a ton.  However, I do use the full onion soup mix packet and the full can of beef broth so that I don't miss out on any flavor, and I add white pepper for a little spice.  Also, for meals that need some protein (i.e. after a workout), I add sliced turkey kielbasa to the soup while I'm heating it up.  It makes a wonderful addition (and adds more flavor!) while still being calorie conscious.

This was good. I made per instructions. I did add 2 qts of water and an extra can of beef broth to cover everything. It made a LOT!! Don't think this will be done in 45 minutes, though! It'll take almost that long just to get everything into the pot! And then it should simmer for a couple hours at least before the veggies are tender. Please allow the time and try this soup.

I made this soup the other night following the directions to the t. First of all this soup took 4 hours for the vegetables to become tender. Secondly it made way too much, my fridge and freezer are full of this stuff. I must not be able to handle the cabbage or something because everytime I take a bite I become very ill. Maybe its just me. Also, the rumors that this diet will help you lose weight is false. After consulting several of my doctors they stated that cabbage soup is not fat burning at all, the only reason you lose weight is due to the lack of calories (which can make you very sick). If I were you make this soup if you love this stuff and dont do it if you want to diet.

I recently made this soup from a meal plan. I started the soup Monday and ate it once a day and sometimes twice a day. Today is only Thursday and I have lost 4 pounds so far. I think this will be my favorite  lunch  thus far. I only substituted the beef broth with chicken broth and I did not add string beans. I agree with the other reviewers where it didn't have much of a taste, but yet so fulfilling. I need this soooooooo baddddd

I have made this before and it does make a lot! And you do need to stay fairly close to a bathroom because it seems to run right thru you! Probably because of all the veggies. I thought it tasted good as is. The people that add potatoes or garbanzo beans or meat...or olive oil!!!, you are taking the fat burning away from the soup!! You can't add all of those carbs!If it was a regular vegtable soup it's fine.
You can't make all those changes to a recipe and then say you didn't like it. That's not a fair review.

I remember this soup from the 80's and recently gave it another try. I made a few changes based on comments here.  I used canned crushed tomatos, added two chopped up poblano peppers, two chopped jalapenos, used frozen french cut green beans instead of canned, added about 1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms for that meat mouth feel and I eliminated the dry onion soup mix.  I cheated and sauteed 1 bunch green onion, tops and all, with 4 cloves garlic in 1T olive oil.  I added 1T chili powder and 2t cumin.  The soup turned out great, very filling but you get hungry again soon.  The whole magic fat burning cabbage soup diet can be found at www.cabbage-soup-diet.com.  It is really a behaviour modification plan disguised as a recipe.  But all the veggies make for healthy eating!  Great soup, highly recommend, with some added spices, which do not add calories!

Used one quart regular V-8, one quart spicy V-8, one small can of Mexican tomatoes (as I did not have regular canned tomatoes) and added about 1/4 salsa.  Also did not use beef broth but homemade chicken broth -- probably about 6 cups. The chicken broth had plenty of seasonings in it, so did not add onion soup mix. Did add a couple of dashes of garlic powder. This soups whacks a wallop -- very tasty and spicy. Is not overpowered by tomatoes, as others have suggested.  I'll make it again for sure and use different ratios of spices, tomatoes, etc.  We'll see if my husband loses weight! Will post an update if so!

Though this is not the orignal recipe for the cabbage soup diet (found on wikipedia) it is pretty good. The original recipe has a few changes but the one that thing that I noticed is in this recipe it calls for 2 quarts of tomato juice. I found the juice to be a bit overwhelming. The juice I picked up has 50 cal and 10g of carbs per serving. If you are REALLY trying to shed those pounds, I'd omit the tomato juice and just add more seasoning. (which is what I will do next time) The first time I did this (years and years ago) I lost 10 pounds in one week. It was a good way to kick start my diet and give me motivation to keep going. Hopefully the same will work this time! I also added firm tofu for some protien. (since this is all I will be eating for a week)

Okay, first of all, give yourself some time to prepare for this recipe and for the cook time.  It took my almost an hour and a half to finish chopping up all the veggies and it took another 2 hours for it to cook to the right consistancy for our home.  It is worth all of the hard work though- it was delicious and my whole family loved it.

Do you know how much sodium is in this soup? Dried onion soup mix (2,440 mg of sodium), tomato juice (5,232 mg of sodium),  canned green beans (580 mg of sodium), canned tomatoes (1,440 mg sodium), beef broth (890 mg sodium). That's a total of 10,582 mg of sodium per batch, or 706 mg of sodium per serving. That's almost a half a day's worth of sodium per bowl of soup! Insane.

I have been eating this soup for lunch and dinner about a week and have lost three pounds already!  I only need to lose 20 pounds. so this is a great start!  I had tried a similar soup back in the 80's, but this one actually tastes much better!  If you are the only one eating this, I would recommend halving the ingredients because it makes a HUGE pot otherwise.

Pretty good for a 'diet' soup. Made exactly as written, froze most of it in individual servings for later (hopefully it reheats well). Won't use whole tomatoes next time unless I cut them up before putting them in. I had to simmer my giant kettle for like 2 hours to get the veggies al dente. Recipe made a ton of soup! **Update: The bowls of this that I froze turned out really well when reheated!**

I made this soup in my crockpot yesterday and it turned out great.  Even my boyfriend liked it and he's pretty hard to please when it comes to new recipes.  I even made so much I'm bringing my dad some after work today because I know he will love it too.  I thought of maybe adding bean sprouts the next time around.  I think they would fit good.  Thanks for the great recipe

This recipe makes a ton! I had to split it up between my large pot and a smaller pot as it all wouldn't fit in.  Very tasty. It also freezes well and for months! Just let it defrost out on the counter.

would probably taste good to those who drink tomato or v8 juice, I thought the 2 quarts tomato juice made it very acidic, but that might be a part of the weight loss secret....I couldn't even eat it but I do not like tomato type drinks, would taste much better with maybe 1 qt tomato juice and 1 qt vegetable or chicken broth, and would still be healthy, sorry I am not a picky eater but this was unedible for me :(

Very good! I have made this about 3 times now. The third time I put in a can of pumkin. You can not taste it, it does not add any fat or calories, it just thickens up the broth a bit! (Learned it at weight watchers!)

Very Good!  COuple of changes I made were: I cut the recipe in half but still used entire can of tomatoes and beef broth, used vegetable juice rather than tomato,  threw in 1/2 a chopped onion rather than the onion soup mix, and used fresh green beans rather than canned.  I threw everthing in a crockpot and cooked on high for a couple of hours.  :-)  Made this as part of my low calorie diet.

This soup is SOO GOOD. I did however add a can each of, black eyed peas, white beans, red beans, and lima beans. I used canned carrot (2c). # med. sized onions and omited the celery and pepper because those are nasty (in my opinion). I also added 3c. barley to it but had to also add more water. How much? A BUNCH. It made so much soup that I had to make 4 trips to the fridge just to put it away. It was soooo good though. OH also, I used 1 small green cabbabe and 1 small red cabbage. GREAT GREAT GREAT. The only seasoning it needed was pepper. I also added some crushed red pepper. Made it with low sodium v8 and low sodium beef broth. Also used 2c. diced tomatoes...If you do add beans like I did, don't forget to rince them off.

I've made variations of this many times over the years.  I like to use low-sodium chicken broth or vegetable broth, and I also use either fresh or frozen cut green beans.  I stopped using the dry soup mix a long time ago and just add my own seasonings (salt, pepper, herbs, hot sauce) to taste, but my recent addition of a tbsp. or so of garam masala has made this a new favorite in our house!  We try to have a salad with dinner every night, but when that wears thin, a small bowl of this before dinner is a nice change and a healthy way (especially when you take steps to lower the sodium content) to get in an extra serving or two of veggies with minimal fat and calories.

I found it delicious and I am not even a soup fan. Having gained 15 lbs since moving to Australia I needed something and hoping this did. I don't find it blend at all. The only thing diferent that I did what I used vegetable stock instead of beef since I am a vegetarian.

This is a very tasty soup. I knew from reading the recipe that i'd find it a little bland so I added 4 cloves of garlic, crushed, about a teaspoon of coriander powder, celery salt and basil as well as 6 small chillies chopped with the the seeds. It's turned out delicious! I'm a vegetarian so I also substituted the beef broth for vegetable stock (from bullion). 

Be warned - if you are going to use the stated proportions, you will need a very large pot to get all the ingredients in - it ended up being a lot more than I thought it would be, with the soup coming to the top of my foot and a bit tall stock pot!

The great thing about this recipe is that the soup is versatile, you can add different spices and sauces to it and use different stocks and vegetable juice bases to change the flavor (next time I'm thinking of trying a more curried flavor) and you can either roughly chop the veggies if you want it chunky, finely chop them for some bite or puree it if you prefer a thick liquid soup. I'll definitely be making this again.

Do not judge a book by its cover....this is an 
'Amazing' recipe coming from someone who does NOT like veggies at all. I added lots of chili  peppers though (need heat in all of my foods). Tastes alot better the next day. It helps to know 1 cup is only 90 cal. I love that it's high in fiber as well - about 5g per cup. Thanks so much for sharing.

I absolutely love this soup!  I have it every day with my lunch.  I also have it as a snack if I want something low calorie and filling.  I made the recipe as written with only one change - I used fresh green beans instead of canned.  The recipe made enough for me to distribute between 16 (16 ounce) Ziploc containers that I filled about 3/4 way.  Put them all in my freezer ... Awesome soup to have on hand!  Thanks for the recipe!

This soup was delicious! I used chicken stock instead of beef broth and added more chicken stock. I also added a bunch of spices based on the comments (I tsp each of oregano, parsley, Italian seasoning, onion power, garlic powder... and I added a dash of hot sauce... plus salt and pepper to taste)... I also added two tablespoons of olive oil and chicken sausage which made it heartier..

I found this on my search for low calorie meal ideas. Only change I made was adding basil. It was surprisingly fantastic! I portioned out my servings and put in freezer bags and stuck in the freezer so I have something quick to grab and heat up, instead of grabbing fast and also highly unhealthy alternatives.

As a "diet soup" this would get 5 stars...it works to radically reduce calories and carbs as written, and is filling enough to curb a stubborn appetite.  It would be a rare person who would fail to lose weight replacing just one meal a day with this soup.  I dropped one star for the lack of seasoning.  Not many reviewers raved about this recipe without adding their own tweaks.  My advice would be to make a smaller batch to begin with and tweak until you find a seasoning combination that you really like.  If you don't like the taste, you won't be able to stick with it on a frequent, or daily basis, and so it won't work as a weight control tool.  If you get too much of something, you'll be stuck with a couple gallons of soup you'll quickly tire of. (which is what I did!)  Once you've perfected to your own satisfaction, THEN make the larger batch and freeze some of it.  As with most soups, this is better the second day and beyond. I like the idea of rotating flavors, and my next batch I plan to make "bland" and season it in smaller quantities as I pull them out of the freezer. This way I can keep it more interesting from day to day.

For those of you who are cooking for the gout-stricken, this is VERY gout-friendly, and a good way to help get those desirable veggies into the diet...IF you can keep it interesting enough to be eaten on a regular basis!

just to correct the author of this recipe it isn't a rumor this soup made as is has a negative calories count it burns fat because your body uses more energy digesting the vegetables than the soup provides this means u can eat as much of this soup in a day as u want thus never being hungry however one should eat a hard boiled egg everyday and a banana every other day for protein and potassium you will lose weight with this soup and it taste pretty good the first couple days however if you have a lot of weight to lose it loses its luster a friend who lost 80 lbs on this soup in three months said after too weeks its freaking gross

I made some changes, started this June 27th, down 6 lbs AFTER stuffing my face for 4th of July! Used V8 juice as recommended by others instead of plain tomato juice, used a head of broccoli instead of celery, used red & orange bell peppers instead of green, had beefy onion soup mix so used that, had the carrots cut into chunks like another reviewer suggested (good call!), and boiled 3 chicken breasts, shredded them and added to the soup. Salt to taste. DELICIOUS! So good my mom tried mine and asked me to make her a batch! It reminded us both of Campbell's Vegetable soup back in the day (no idea if it tastes the same now). I could never eat just this all day every day even though it's tasty. Instead I've been using it as at least one meal replacement. Healthy breakfast, soup for lunch (sometimes with, sometimes without triscuits), generally whatever for dinner. This soup is SO low in calories that even a bad day can end with not going over my calorie goals for the day. I exercise regularly but love to eat so this soup has been a great boost in weight loss. I've NEVER lost weight so fast and I'm not hungry! If I get hungry, I have a bowl of this soup! Very pleased with this recipe.

I made this soup many years ago and I was so thrilled to find the recipe again here on allrecipes.com (of course!). Before I share this tip, I must say that although I read many of the reviews, I did not read all 508 of them, so this may have already been shared.

I was at a loss for 2 qts of tomato juice! As I was scouring my pantries for the juice or V8, I found my (very fav!!) Mr & Mrs T Bloody Mary Mix. Knowing it would be all kinds of wrong, I decided to compare the Nutrition Facts to my small amount of Campbell's tomato juice anyway.

Well!!!  Kudos to Mr & Mrs T !!!!

The Nutrition Facts are EXACTLY the same except for a couple of (minor) things.  The tomato juice has 5 grams of sugars and the Mr & Mrs T only has 4 grams of sugars!! Yes, I also know that Mr & Mrs T list high fructose corn sugar as an ingredient that the tomato juice does not have, but obviously it does not affect the Carbs or Sugars!

Ok, there is a tradeoff (of course..lol!) the Mr & Mrs T mix has 650 mg of Sodium, compared to Campbell's Tomato Juice from Concentrate's 470 mgs. But you know the old trick - peel & quarter a couple of potatoes, throw them in to absorb the sodium and then toss them when your soup is done!

So – For all of my fellow Bloody Mary lovers out there, all we need to keep in our pantries is Mr & Mrs T for our cocktails AND any of our recipes calling for tomato juice!

Like others, I made some alterations.  I intend on eating mainly soups (at least 2 meals a day) as I want to lose 20 pounds.  I added browned diced chicken breasts (2), 1 can of kidney beans, and my own homemade beef stock instead of processed.  These add protein and help your blood sugar levels stay more consistent.  The addition of Worcestershire sauce adds a depth of flavour.

I left out two things when I made this soup: the green peppers because my family doesn't like them, and the beef broth because the cabbage releases it's own water as it's cooking and I didn't want the soup to have a lot of liquid. This soup still turned out delicious! My meat-and-potato-loving family loved this vegetarian soup! The second day I pureed the rest and it tasted even better! This soup isn't just for dieters. I will definitely make again! Thanks for sharing!

I made a few modifications but still low calorie.

Saute onion, garlic, celery for a few minutes, add carrots, 1 container low sodium chicken stock, 1 can diced tomatoes, 1 can diced tomatoes with celery, green peppers, and onion (Rot-tel) 1 small can tomato juice and 1/2 head cabbage. Add onion soup mix and cook for about 45 minutes... Left out green beans but only because I couldnt fit them in the pot.

As-is, 4 stars... but so easy to make it 5 if you just add seasoning!  Herbs etc. don't make it less healthy!
I've made this twice now and I love that I can get a huge amount of veggies in at lunch. A few things I've learned while making this:
1) 1/2 head of cabbage is still tons. I'm sure my stock pot wouldn't have fit a whole head.
2) Use only enough water to fully cover the veggies. They will reduce as it cooks.
3) I use two packs of onion soup mix, for personal taste.
4) The herbs I use: Italian mix, oregano, parsley and bay leaves. I also add a fair amount of minced garlic.
5) I thought this would be way too "onion-y", but surprisingly, it's not. 

I don't make this for weight loss... I make this because it's a tasty, healthy soup with lots of veggies!

Wow, this is so good I can't stop eating it.  Good thing it makes a ton!  Only things I changed was to use vegetable juice instead of tomato juice because it's what I had on hand and I did not add any water. Looking forward to having this as my lunch this week at work.  YUM.

Made this tonight for the first time. Dont know about the weight loss aspect but it was really tasty! Halved the recipe but used zucchini in place of the beans, added a little garlic, tobasco, and dried minced onion. So good and easy. No guilt when eating and you know you are eating something your body wants. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

This is an excellent base. I am always tweaking recipes to fit my families taste. :) My changes.... I left out the dry onion soup mix....too much salt! I do add onions. I add tomato sauce or chopped tomatoes depending on what I have on hand. I leave out the bell peppers because I do not like the taste. I add mushrooms. I add lower sodium beef broth or vegetable broth. I also add some paprika, sage, oregano, thyme, basil, rosemary, cracked black pepper, minced garlic....these add flavor but do not mess with the diuretic properties of the soup.

Loved it.  I used V-8 instead of plain tomato juice.  I also added 1 can of chickpeas which was really good but next time I think I'll add a can of kidney beans instead.  This is so great to make when you have a few lbs to lose from Christmas time!

Good basic soup. Needs help in the flavor department. Used V8 juice and chicken stock in place of the water. Added 4 cloves chopped garlic, oregano and some bay leaf. 1/2 teaspoon cyanane gives it a mild kick. Needs just a bit of salt to really bring up to a good soup.  Note you need a very large pot for this recipe! I kept the veggies quite large so the cooking time had to be increased to 2 hours but I like a chunky soup.

Delicious! A few things...the taste gets stronger as it sits so be wary of adding spices too soon. I added a little pepper just to give it a little flavor and after sitting for a few days it was super spicy! Also (I could be totally weird for this) but I made it this summer and thought it was great eating it cold right out of the fridge! It was really refreshing on the hot days and helped quench my thirst!

This is very good.  I played around w/the spiced a lot though until it got to the flavors I liked.  My entire extended family asked for the recipe and froze batches for later.  Thanks for the recipe!

Whether dieting or not, this is an extremely good vegetable soup. I made a couple of very slight changes though... I used one quart tomato juice and one quart of V-8, I added 2 cans of cut green beans instead of just one and I used the "Beefy Onion Soup" mix. Also, I threw in a can of drained garbanzo beans for a little added "oomph". We like spicy food so I set a jar of hot sauce on the table & we sprinkled some in our bowls... quite tasty! This recipe makes a ton of soup so be prepared to freeze a few portions. Thanks to Nell for posting this one!

Yum! A couple of notes: 1) this makes a HUGE batch; and 2) it is a lot better if you add chili powder and cumin (to taste).

This soup is wonderful.  I am on Weight Watchers and made as directed it is zero points!  Excellent to have with a sandwich for lunch or as a snack without adding many calories.  I leave out the bell peppers simply because I don't like them, and use 2 packs of onion soup mix.  I cook this soup in the crock pot.  As for the reviewers who are adding potatoe and meat and giving it a 5 star rating, you are COMPLETELY changing the recipe.  It's SUPPOSED to be low cal!!!

This soup is very very good. One batch lasts a whole week. I hate green peppers so I substituted some kale instead. It was a good addition. If you start getting tired of this soup add some rice and ground beef. It makes it not so fat-burning, but much tastier.

I MADE A FEW CHANGES. I ADDED A SMOKED TURKEY LEG AND A LITTLE SEASONING SALT AND GARLIC POWDER INSTEAD OF REGULAR SALT. I COOKED IT LONGER THAN 25 MIN ABOUT 45MIN TO AN HOUR. THE VEGGIES MELTED IN OUR MOUTHS. THANKS FOR SHARING.

This is my second time making this recipe...and this time I added a can of corn and a handful or so of frozen peas, along with pleny of spices:  1/8 tsp pepper, 1 tsp garlic powder, shook in some oregano..and added LOTS of Tony Chachere's cajun seasoning!  With these changes, I'm pretty sure I could eat this soup every day of my life and not be tired of it!  Sooo good!! :)

It is working! I have lost 4 lbs and I'm on day 2 of the cabbage soup diet! I ate the soup because it smelled so good while I was cooking it the night before the diet;  my original plan was to eat this juicy French Dip sandwich my fiancé made before having to do this diet, but I just ate the soup. I did have to dr it up quite a bit though. So, that being said, it is OK to dr it up to your liking, TO AN EXTENT. The ingredients aid in your fat-burning, yes, but adding seasoning such as I did, does not ruin the recipe and it just makes you more likely to be successful eating something you can eat… Just DON'T add fat if your goal is to lose fat! Here's what I did… I added all ingredients to their fullest and DID NOT substitute anything. I used all organic foods… Expensive, yea somewhat, but not really when you consider how much it makes and how long you'll have soup for! I gave my sister a week's worth and have about 14 servings left. Anyhow… I added, little by little, worcestershire, italian seasoning, bay leaves, a little cumin, and garlic seasoning. I added a little and tasted a little until I came out with a fabulous recipe. I also thought I used too much water, so I doubled up on the beef stock, tomato, and onion soup mix. SO for those who did not like it, I completely understand. It was bland. But I made it happen. I was a bit worried I screwed up my diet by adding the extra onion mix, beef stock, tomato, and worcestershire since it is all so high in sodium, but surprisingl

This recipe works best if the "packaged onion soup mix" is omitted. I used fresh tomatoes (with skins removed) and fresh green beans. The difference in taste using fresh ingredients is worth the expense. And if you grow your own tomatoes and green beans, there's no extra expense. It's OK to not put in two quarts of commercial tomato juice that is loaded with salt. Just salt to taste, not according to what's in packaged soups and juices.

Very good and tasted even better the next day reheated. I added a can of kidney beans to give it more substance.  Tastes good with hot sauce and a spoon of plain yogurt to change it slightly if you're eating it everyday.

great soup just as it is. It also makes a great soup base. I have been eating it every other day and have lost weight. I took a smaller pot used this recipie as a base, added old bay and a can of crab meat and it made awsome Maryland Crab Soup.

If you're looking to diet, then I suppose this recipe serves its purpose well: it is certainly low in calories, but not high in flavor. I added chili sauce and cumin which made it significantly more palatable.

Made 1/2 recipe & it was plenty. Didn't have any cabbage but I did have about 10 brussel sprouts that I shredded. I sauteed the veggies in olive oil & butter for extra flavor.  Added 3 bay leaves & 4 cloves of pressed garlic.  Used V8 & Hunts diced fire roasted tomatoes w/ basil, oregano & garlic & 1/2 cup barley.  I also diced up 1/2 of a jalapeno after I removed the seeds & sauteed it with the other veggies.  Soup was very good & has always, it's better the next day.

You really need at 12 quart pot for this; however, you can get away with an 8 quart if you must. I would also go with a of savoy cabbage as apposed to green cabbage. Also, this recipe uses too much cabbage. I used about 3/4 head. To add spice, I poked holes in a habanero pepper and let it cook in the soup and removed it before eating. It gave a nice heat to the broth.

I have made cabbage diet soup before and loved it.  This however tasted so blah I could not eat it.  My husband poured Franks Red Hot sauce in it.

I think some spices would help - and I would omit the water and use only broth.
I also used V8 - so maybe that was the culprit.  

Guess I'll have to give it a whirl again.

Made this last nite for hubby who's on this "I've gained 5 pounds and feel fat" kick.  It was awesome!  Did make a few changes: We used Hot and Spicy V-8 juice, added an extra packet of onion soup mix, 1/2 bottle of tiger sauce and an extra can of green beans.  We both thought it was tasty and healthy!....  until we added a few of the croutons from the Panzanella salad from this site! LOL

Update: Everyone loved this! I had people asking to take home the leftovers. Thanks for the post, it was perfect! Original review:This isn't something I would normally make but my co-workers and I are participating in a 'Biggest Loser' challenge and I am providing the soup for our luncheon tomorrow. I tasted a little of the broth and was surprised at how good this is! Will update on how they liked it....

I like the proportions of this recipe.  This is cabbage soup which is why there is so much cabbage!  FYI, based on 15 servings, each is WW 2, yes 2 points!  All good carbs, and great!  I add a little milk to each serving because I like it a little creamier.

I have a similar recipe for Cabbage Soup, except mine includes some wild rice, mushrooms, bouillon, and I add fresh herbs and some garlic as well.  It is good topped with croutons and a little Parmesan cheese.  How you are supposed to do this diet is eat a very sensible breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and eat unlimited soup in between.  I didn't follow it exactly like that when I first made it,but I did have at least one bowl a day and lost 4 pounds in one week!  It is a great-tasting, exceptionally healthy soup that I keep on hand all the time.  I've also poured some on a baked potato and that is good too.

This was very good, but I agree with previous reviewers - it takes a long time to cut all the veggies.  I halved this recipe and it still made  A LOT!!  I added an 8 oz. can of low-salt tomato sauce and the entire can of beef broth, along with the water.  It took nearly 2 hrs. of simmering for the veggies to be tender.  Does anyone know how many points this is on the Weight Watcher's winning points program?  Thanks!

Both my husband and I really enjoyed this soup.  I generally don't have so much tomato base in the soups I make, but this was delicious, and very filling.  I only ate one small bowl and was stuffed!  The only thing I felt it lacked was a little minced garlic and some black pepper.

While this soup was okay, we did not find it awesome because frankly it was too tomato-y for me and my wife, and I love tomato soup, so it's not due to that. As such, it's quite acidic and we felt it should have more beef broth (preferably home-made), and we would leave out the tomato juice if we make this again. Personally, this soup reminded me a lot of Italian Minestrone but without some of the classic favours like parmesan cheese, etc.  We have been losing some weight eating it for supper, but frankly that's not so unusual for soups in general, as long as they are not creamed, starched or loaded with potatoes!

I am rating this recipe with only one star with a warning; THIS WILL NOT MAKE YOU BURN FAT!  But even though cabbage will not burn fat from your body, it is still ideal for your weight loss diet because it is so low in calories, low sodium and low carbs. It is a great filler for soups to make you feel full.  With this specific recipe, there is not enough nutritional value to make this a good diet soup.  Definitely do NOT add the dried onion soup! It has a tremendous amount of salt which will make you retain water weight.  When I was dieting, cutting out salt alone with no change in my exercise routine, made me lose about 3 pound a week for a month.  So to make this soup great tasting and great for an energy diet meal, add lots of veggies....peas, beans, celery,  etc. DO NOT add tomato juice! Once again, very high in sodium. Add canned tomatoes instead! Sure canned tomatoes have salt but it's minimal and you'll get more flavour and nutrition than the juice.  My secret to this type of soup is a little fresh lemon juice or ReaLemon juice.  Mushrooms are good...spinach is fantastic!  The greener the vegetable you add, the better the nutritional value.  So this soup as written is very, tasteless, counter productive, misleading and wrong!  If you want to make it and like it, that is great if you are aware that it will not "burn" fat or calories and is not a good main diet dish.

UPDATE:  Just made this a second time. This time, the full recipe, so I can freeze some.  

I am enjoying my second bowl!   Made half the recipe. lots of soup.
Followed the recipe, but in the middle of chopping vegs;  I decided to add some browned bulk Ital. sausage, a pinch of oregano, one garlic clove.   I also used low sodium V8 Juice in place of the Tomato juice, as some others did.  Don't use the dried onion soup mix, if you want to cut down on the salt more.. AND use fresh green beans.  Not using the dried onion soup mix would not ruin the taste of the soup.

NOTE:    Half the recipe made a full pot size of 5.5 quart dutch oven.   Lots of soup!   Family loves it.

I make this soup with these changes and additions: I use fresh green beans, add okra, spinach (for added potassium), barley (for added fiber) and red bell pepper. In addition I use no-salt added Chicken stock and add fresh (when available) herbs and spices such as garlic, parsley, cumin, oregano, etc to taste. I even add either bulk Italian sausage and/or ground turkey breast for taste and to add protein . With the quantity of soup, the meat does not change the nutrition values enough to be a problem. One problem is that no one mentions how large the pot needs to be. The first recipe that I came across said that it made 1 gallon of soup. I had to buy a 10 Qt stock pot to contain it without risking overflowing. When I started adding more veggies and meat I had to buy an even larger stock pot: 16 qt, but I could probably get by with a 12 -14 qt. It is delicious and keeps a long time. I do not eat it exclusively but eat it at least once each day. Does it work? My cardiologist told me that if I could lose 10% of my body weight (214 lbs at that time) that my blood pressure problems would go away. I lost 21 lbs in about six months, went on vacation and ignored all diet restrictions and gained back 10 pounds. Primarily because of this soup I had no problem hitting my 21 lb loss goal by my next cardiologist appointment. Also, my BP fell to well within the normal range. I recommend it for weight loss.

I remember this as the "Dolly Parton" diet that came out 35 years ago. Not to date myself lol. Now I have Chrons disease and can not eat beef products of any kind. Therefore,  I substitute the beef broth for chicken now and it is fantastic! I also buy the canned tomatoes with chillies to add more flavor and spice. I like mine to have more flavor. Thanks for reading!

This soup is delicious!!!  It does make a little over 2gallons of soup if you follow this recipe to the letter.  So not to be wasteful I would cut the ingredients by half, especially if you are the only one eating the soup.

I made this soup as part of my 1200 calorie a day diet. It was great having a go to meal anytime I was feeling hungry. And with only about 90 calories you can't beat it! I would have it for dinner with a great big salad and 6 oz lean protein and stay full for quit some time. I stuck pretty well to this recipe except for adding some kale. The batch lasted me two weeks ( I froze half of it the day I made it).  When I heated it I added garlic POWDER, onion POWDER, Italian seasoning and crushed red pepper. DELICIOUS! And it seemed to me the longer it was in the fridge, the better it tasted:)

Very tasty soup and healthy too, sign me up. I didn't see it mentioned it the hundreds of reviews I read, but I used a 16 Quart pot and that was more than enough. I would imagine if you have anything between 12-16 Quart you should be able to fit all the ingredients and water just fine. I followed the recipe and used all of the ingredients to the exact amounts. I did substitute corn for the green beans, just a personal preference. Also added thyme, oregano, basil, herbs, and african spices...PERFECTION. Thanks for sharing such a hearty and healthy recipe for cold winter days.

I love this recipe!  Like other reviewers have said, it makes a TON--I halved it right off the bat, and it still made more than I was ready for!  I added some spices--black pepper, garlic powder and a little cayenne.  Also, for those who feel "overwhelmed" by all the cabbage, I'd recommended chopping it more finely, almost diced.  This soup is a fantastic way to get in those veggies during the winter when a salad just doesn't sound appetizing at all!

I make something close to this.  I would omit the onion soup due to the salt.  You REALLY don't need it because you get enough from the tomato juice and beef broth.  I also don't use carrots and green beans, instead I add chopped peppers and celery.  Trust me, you will lose weight, I have been making this the early 80's.  I make it every winter and eat it for lunch every day!  It is a very hearty soup.  :)

Too much tomato even for a tomato lover. Surprised this was labelled as healthful given the ingredients of the soup mix;Onions (deyhydrated), salt, cornstarch, onion powder, sugar, corn syrup, hydrolyzed soy protein, caramel color, partially hydrogenated soybean oil, monosodium glutamate, yeast extract, natural flavors, disodium inosinate, disodium guanylate.

Omg its sssooo good (and filling!!!) I did not make this soup for dieting purposes but I do love cabbage and the low cal, healty meal is certainly appealing! I made this tonight for my boys, and they loved it (even my picky eater gave it an 8.9 - typically reserved only for his favorite lasagna!) The only thing I changed: I added 1 15oz can sweet corn, and 1 15 oz can garbanzo beans - which totally 'made' it for us. Will definitely make again!
Thanks so much!!!

I feel bad for giving this a ad review.  I like Minestrone and since I had this, I can tell you, it ain't just cause it has noodles.    I used the Spicy Hot V8 like many others suggested and that was the ONLY change I made.  My boyfriend and I agree, this was bad.  We did not over cook it.  It was just not appealing.  We cooked it and then cooked something else for dinner.  I can understand low cal but this is not what I had in mind, flavor wise.

This has five stars because it is so healthy.  It makes a tremendous amount of soup, so I put individual servings into freezer bags and froze it for later.  I have made this twice and added garlic and hot pepper the second time to season it up a bit.

I made the soup and it's working.  I have a thyroid problem and it's very hard for me to lose weight.  I've lost three pounds in a week! I did make one adjustment.  I used tomato puree instead of the tomato juice.

This is my third time making this soup, it's so yummy!! I use spicy hot v8 and use 5 beef bullion cubes and water in place of the beef stock.  I salt my bowl of soup not the pot, and add two tablespoons of reduced fat parmesan cheese to my bowl.  This really is a great recipe!!! Thanks for sharing :)

I liked this, however I did add some cayenne pepper to it for a little bit of heat, and my husband browned some extra lean ground beef to add to his to give it a little more protein.

I like to add a big jar of sauerkraut (not a can) and use low-sodium vegetable juice to give it a little more flavor.  If you like spicy, you could use the spicy vegetable juice.   Update:  I have made this many times now mainly because I like it and it's very low calorie.  I skip the peppers and green beans because my family  wouldn't go for that and I add the large jar of sauerkraut with juice (this replaces most of the water you are supposed to add to cover the vegetables) and I use spicy vegetable juice.  The soup does not taste sour with the addition of the sauerkraut-it just adds some flavor  to the soup, as does the spicy veg. juice.

kinda a 3 1/2 star. well to be honest my bf isn't a tomato fan so of course he didn't care for the taste of this soup. I thought the soup tasted fine and really happy i kept in the green peppers. it gives the soup a nice flavor without the peppers it would have been really bland. We have lost a few lbs with this soup. so it does its job.

Better with Spicy Hot V8 and lots of minced garlic.  Good recipe that can be easily adjusted to taste.  I even added leftover steamed mixed veggies to a bowl and it was yummy!!  I skipped the onion soup.

This made a lot of soup, I ended up using 2 seperate pots and added one can of pinto beans to one pot and one can of chick peas (garbanzo beans) to the other. The chick peas are really the right consistancy for this soup. I added lots of additional seasonings, garlic, italian seasoning, salt, pepper, Tony Cachere's, etc. And it was still a bit bland, so next time I will try adding some jalapeno or pepper flakes. Overall, the soup is pretty good and if it serves it's purpose, well worth the effort. I will definately half the recipe next time.

This soup is just not for me.  I realize it is designed for losing weight but I did not love it.  I'm happy for those who like it and lose weight with it.

great flavor, and after entering the recipe in to a calorie counter it came out to be about 100 calories.  I would suggest adding a little hot sauce or Worcestershire just to liven it up a bit.

Can't speak for the weight loss qualities of this soup, but as far as taste it leaves a lot to be desired.

This was really good.  I used one can of the whole peeled tomatoes and one can of Rotel Mild tomatoes.  The Rotel tomotoes added a little heat to it.  I also used Vegetable juice instead of tomato juice.  Used lower sodium ingredients where I could.  Also used frozen greens beans instead of canned.  This is a keeper!

Taste was great and was quick to make.  However when I make this again I will be cutting it in half as it made a whole lot of soup.  As far as the fat burning capabilities we all got full on vegetables, so it has to be doing something.  served with parm cheese on top

This was a huge hit with my family and in-laws.  I did half the amount of tomato juice, we are big fans of overly tomato flavored dishes.  It does make a huge pot full, the first time I mad it I had to give away half so I would have room to save the rest!  It does freeze well too, which is nice with such a big batch.  When I want a bowl I just microwave for about a minute then put on low heat in a sauce pan, stirring on occasion.

Love this soup!  I haven't frozen any of it yet but am planning on it.  I made a couple of changes, I did not use the onion mix because I didn't have it, I added fresh about 6 garlic cloves, cumin, turmeric (awesome health benefits but only used a litte as it is a strong spice) and some hot sauce.  I like a spicy soup.  I did omit the carrots just because I didn't have those either and am not a huge fan.  I did add lemon juice, again for the health benefits.  Will definitely make again and again - thanks!

Love this - I used all low or no sodium veggies and V-8 style juice along with some spices (personal preference), and made half the recipe which will easily feed a family of 4-5.  I threw in stew beef for the meat eaters in the crew, but the veggie version is great, too!

I have this same recipe only it has been handed down from my great grandmother.  We call it vegetable soup.  Because my are all meat eaters, we do add some lean stew meat to the recipe to vary up the consistency, also peas, and corn.  I guess I have never eaten it long enough to realize I was loosing weight.  This also freezes very well!!

Fantastic!! I cut this recipe in half and it still made a really big pot! I am not using it for a diet, this is just a healthy and yummy soup for me :) I added some cayenne, Italian seasonings, and chopped garlic.  Definitely will make again when fall/winter hits!

Yum!  This turned out great.  Threw it all in the slow cooker on high for about 5-6 hours and it was perfect.  The only change I made was I used one can of whole peeled tomatoes and 1 can of tomatoes with chilies.  I had to have a little spice!  Thanks for the recipe.

This soup was my first venture into the dieting world 15 yrs ago.  I need to lose some weight again so I'm making the soup tomorrow.    I have to say though, the diet attached to this soup is pretty nutty.  Although you will indeed lose a surprising amount of weight really quickly eating almost nothing but this soup, it's mostly water weight you will lose and it will really mess up your body, health and metabolism.    *That said*, this is a great diet soup to eat daily to help lose weight if you're including a daily intake of other balanced nutrients.    I regularly do a half banana, mixed berries, ginger, spinach and kale smoothie for breakfast with a little lean protein on the side (approx 300 calories all together).  So now I'm going to try eating healthy small meals like the smoothie 3x a day and eat the soup in between to fill up.  Then every 4-5 days eat slightly more than usual (something high-carb to spike leptin levels) so my body doesn't go into starvation mode, and my metabolism stays charged.   I have 10 lbs to lose in a month so I'll update if this works.  The soup here is slightly different from the classic which I'll list in case anyone is interested:      * 6 large green onions     * 2 green peppers     * 2 cans of tomatoes (diced or whole)     * 1 bunch celery     * 1/2 head cabbage     * 1 package dry onion soup mix     * 1 or 2 cubes bouillon/ stock cubes either chicken or beef (optional)     * Salt, pepper, any seasoning

I liked this soup a lot...even better after it sat in the fridge for a day.  I had to use our large stock pot to make this and think I ended up simmering it for about an hour or so on low.  This is going to be a new staple in our house!

This makes a ton of soup! Used two big crock pots to make it, and they were both full.  I would cut the recipe in half if I was making it again. I made the soup exactly as the recipes states and it is VERY bland. It needs lots of spices to make it better.

This soup was pretty good and quite plentiful. I actually divided the ingredients into 2 5-qt dutch ovens. I added salt, pepper, thyme, parsley, oregano, Tony Chachere's creole seasoning, a little garlic powder, and some hot sauce and still wasn't satisfied with the overpowering tomato flavor until I added a little worcestershire sauce. Perfection! Surprisingly, my 6 year old picky daughter LOVED the soup and told me I should make it more often (before I added the worcestershire sauce). I lost that bet! This will definitely be going into the freezer and will be a keeper!

I've been making this recipe for a couple years with minor tweaks -- spicing it up, adding extra veggies, etc. It is a great soup recipe! I can't attest to the fat burning qualities, but I always make another batch before using the last container from the freezer.

This soup is very filling and really good. It made me feel healthy just eating it, but no flavor was sacrificed. I served this soup with some homemade cornbread on the side. This soup keeps well in the fride. I think I ate leftovers a week after I made it, and it still tasted great.  I might try adding shrimp to this in the future to change it up a little.

This soup is indeed tasty! I make this when I tire of my other favorite vegetable soup that is just as tasty. The only complaint I have about this soup is that after an hour or two I get hungry again as there is not much substance to this soup. Please note that using ONLY this soup as a means to support yourself is very dangerous and the "cabbage soup diet" is extremely unhealthy for your body.

I made this soup last night so that I could do the diet, but I also had people over so I served it as the first course for dinner. Everyone loved it :) It is very delicious even if you don't plan on eating it all week. I did try some about half an hour before dinner time and thought it was very good but it was missing something--namely a TON of salt but it was still yummy. I went to the cupboard to grab the salt and realized why it was so bland--I forgot to add the onion soup mix! I just threw it in there at the end, stirred well and let it simmer a couple more minutes. I gotta tell you though the soup was still good but I liked it better without the mix. Next time I will skip the mix and just add plain salt. As far as the diet goes, it's my first full day and I've been peeing A LOT, so make sure you do it at a convenient time not a day you have a lot of meetings or anything. And also although volume-wise I’ve eaten more than I usually would I am still hungry so if you plan on doing the diet make sure you have a lot of fruits and veggies to supplement on the appropriate days. Good luck to all with your weight loss and if your just looking for a yummy soup go ahead and give this one a try it’s very tasty!! (although you should only make ¼ of the recipe as it does make A LOT, I used a 14qt pot and there was only a tiny bit of room at the top)

this is a hit.  I made it to use for a diet.  My wife loved it and it makes enough to last for 2 weeks for 2 people.  I didn't have the onion soup mix and it's still great without it.

I didn't care for it as is.  I added LOTS of beef and pasta.  I assume because of the fat burning properties of the tomatoes and cabbage that its all good, right?

This recipe has been around forever. I remember it in the 80's as part of some heart diet and in the 90's as pee a pound soup and now wieght watchers has thier own version. Anyway this is a filling soup for a little while but after an hour or so you are hungry again and thats ok because you can eat more soup. Which is very low in calories. I have used ever vegetable you can think of in it. The variety makes it interesting and different. My favorite is to put asperagus, cabbage, carrots onion, celery and cauliflower together. I also use chicken or beef boliuon. I like this recipe but it's not one my family likes.

YUM!!! I used low sodium V8 juice and about 2/3rds of a bag of pre-shredded cabbage, as well as some thyme, oregano, marjoram and seasoned salt. I let the soup cook on low all day in the slow cooker, and about 30 minutes before dinner, I added about a cup of whole wheat pasta. Absolutely delicious! Thanks for sharing the recipe--it's definitely a  keeper!

I love this recipe because it is so versatile. You can pretty much add whatever vegetable you want or omit any you don’t like. The few thing I did change were 1) omit the onion soup mix, it masks the flavors’ of the vegetables 2) reduced the amount of celery and added in zucchini and summer squash and finally 3) used vegetable broth instead of beef. So good, could eat everyday!!

This soup is great! I added some of my homemade salsa because I was out of tomatoes. I have a family of 9 with ages ranging from 10 to 76 to feed and everyone loved it!!
Thanks

I have just come off the mastercleanse & needed a vegie soup to make. This is awesome, not just because I haven't eaten in 9 days!!
I added zucchini(2)& garlic. In a couple of days I will add some beans/lentils. It does make a lot, but it's great to freeze:)
I've since made this again and have added spinach as well. So good and so easy!

Oh my goodness! I have found a solution for my dilemma! My ten year high school reunion is in October and I have about 20 pounds to lose.  I am gonna live off this soup for the next couple of months.  I absolutely LOVE IT!  Very tasty and satisfying.  The only thing I changed is adding Worchestire sauce which made it even better.

I added a pound of rotini to this recipe, not only did it bump the serving size up, but it made it much more palpable, and made it into a great tasting soup.  And it only added about 100 calories per serving and a gram of fat, still making it an incredibly healthy soup.  Oh, and i used boullion cubes (about four-five) instead of the beef broth, because the boullion has less fat.

This one is much richer tasting than the Weight Watchers vegtable soup.  I think the tomatoe juice gives it a better flavor.

this was awesome. it was so yummy and healthy too. i replaced the beans with corn, but that's about it. it's better than a lot of full fat soup i've tasted. it's really simple too. i advise you to try it.

The taste of this soup is fantastic!  The only downside is the prep time which
took me an hour to chop up all the ingrediants and two and one half hours to
cook.  The results, though, were worth the time and effort.

This soup really isn't too bad.  You do loose weight on this.  Eat this all day long, nothing else-to loose weight.  I don't know if kids like this or not, I don't have any little kids at home.  If a person likes vegetables, they should like this!

I made this soup as written.  It is delicious.  The next time that I made it, I added a half teaspoon of crushed red pepper because I like my food with a little kick.  Still very delicious.  Every time I make this soup, I portion the soup in tupperware and I have some pre-cooked proteins like ground beef, turkey, chicken, or sausage in the fridge and add it the day I’m eating the soup to change it up.  DELICIOUS!!!! Glad I found this recipe.

Used one  of the tomato juice cans. But  all the veggies  are put in and added more water . Helps to cut down on the acid.

I followed this recipe exactly and it was pretty good.  I really like how few calories it contains!!  It took longer than 25 min to thoroughly cook all the veggies, more like 35 min.  It seemed like it was missing something and the flavor was mild.  I added 2 bay leaves and continued to simmer it for another 20 min.  That was the missing ingredient!  It made a huge flavor difference, I highly recommend it!

Really good flavor.  I changed a few things only because I didn’t have certain ingredients.  I used a combination of crushed tomatoes and diced instead of the whole.  I also added the water from the green beans and added a quart of vegetable stock instead of water.  I threw in a tablespoon of crushed red pepper for flavor and it have it a nice heat.   My only complaint is that it makes a huge recipe so be prepared and start in the biggest pot you have or make a 1/2 recipe.

If you're making this for yourself, I suggest you halve the recipe as it makes a LOT of soup. It fit perfectly in my Crock pot which I put on high the night before and warm throughout the day (veggies were perfectly tender by lunch time.) I follow the recipe mainly how its written but I might sub out the green beans for corn or I may just put them both! I also like a little bit of spice and, as another user stated, I added half a bottle of the V8 Spicy& Hot, a dash (or 3) of chili powder, and a dash of Tapatio hot sauce. Its surprisingly very filling and it really does help with weightloss! I ate it for a week before a trip and I looked a lot slimmer in pictures.

Before you start all of that chopping, make sure you have at least a 10 qt. pot to put everything in. It came up to the rim on mine. As for that 20 minute prep time; only if you are a knife wielding ninja. It took more like 40 minutes to do all of the chopping. The soup is pretty bland and does need more flavoring. See other reviews by people smarter than me for some ideas.

I made a huge pot of this! I added some nutmeg as per someones suggestion, white balsamic vinegar, dried thyme, 2 bay leaves, a can of chicken broth and a quart of beef broth. I also added 2  fresh Anaheim Chile for a little heat. I used 48 ounces of  V 8 juice. It needed extra broth because my cabbage was so big.I'm actually writing this so I remember what I did to make this soooo good!

I have made this more times that you could count, because I was making this back in the mid 1970's...it's delicious and I did lose weight on it. I was working retail at the time and the recipe went  through all departments in several of our stores. 
It is a healthy soup and I still make this frequently. I recommend that you prepare it according to  the directions. The weight loss is dependent on the exact ingredients as printed here.  When you begin to add to or subtract from...it upsets the effectiveness of it due to the items you add such as meat or remove, perhaps you don't like one of the veggies, you're playing with the nutritional aspect.

However, if you are NOT interested in the weight loss aspect, then feel free to add meats or seafood...weight loss or no, it's delicious!

this soup works because it has negative calories... your body uses more calories than  it "saves" in fat. it is delishhh,, and  easy to make. yes,, there are many ways to alter this recipe for flavor and perferance, but  then you change the balance.  this is my favorite soup, and eating a bowl 30 min before a meal, will help to lose weight.  It is great to have it in my favorites again..

I followed the instructions somewhat - the celery  not - as I had none on hand. Also I put red, orange and yellow bell peppers, and mushrooms in it.  I followed the advice of someone and didn't put the onion soup mix  ( was afraid of the salt content) instead I had garlic, Italian seasoning and parsley so I used it.

hello, I saw this recipe a week or two ago and made this fantastic soup hoping to loose some weight. I have also been going to the gym 3-4 days a week.  I did not add the French onion soup and I really don't think it needs it as it is  very  flavorful. I also used fresh green beans not canned.  So far I have lost 4 pounds and not any inches as far as I can tell. It is a delicious soup and I love cabbage so that makes it even better and it is sooo tasty. I cut the recipe in half and it usually lasts me 4 or 5 days as I do have a light breakfast (not the soup) and eat the soup for lunch maybe along with a fresh fruit and I eat it for dinner as well. I have been incorporating  a little regular food like yogurt and granola bars as well so that might be slowing down the process of losing more weight and inches. I will continue to eat this soup and work out and hopefully I can loose at least 10-15 pounds within the next month as I have a function I am going to and would like to be a trimmer me....I will update as the progress goes. Thanks for this great recipe..

I ve used this soup to lose lbs. bigtime. 1 week plan from a German University for heart patients :the soup -daily, day 1 +fruit, day 2  + raw veggies-evenings 1 baked potato, day 3 + fruit and veggies, day 4 - 3 bananas -over the day with milk(don t forget the soup), day 5 + 1lb of lean meat + fresh tomatoes, day 6 -meat and veggies as much as you want,  day 7- fullgrain rice + veggies and fruitjuices.  This week can be repeated for more weight loss.  Soup can be substituted with V-8 juice(just saying) on those days that you can t imagine doing the soup.  This brings amazing results.

I've made this countless times. It's a variation of the recipe from Weight Watchers. I have never added the packaged onion soup mix (too much salt) and I use plain water rather than beef or chicken broth. It still tastes delicious.

I've made this soup a few times..  Changes I've made (only because I'm not one for canned products). Was to use fresh green beans and fresh tomato purée instead of juice.   As for the can of beef broth, I used beef bone broth that I made just by boiling organic beef shank bones:).  The result was amazing!  I used a whole food nutrition shake for breakfast , the soup for lunch and a clean dinner omitting carbs, dairy and gluten!   I was able to shed pounds and feel amazing while doing it!   Thank you for this recipe!

Delicious, perfect for cold weather, easy to customize after making initial recipe. Portion into individual servings and add desired flavors to the different containers. No starches in this recipe, so it's perfect for the freezer. Would also be delicious over rice or black-eyed peas or with some cooked/drained ground beef tossed in.

I just finished a giant bowl of this Cabbage Fat-Burning Soup.
The recipe rendered u about 24 12 oz servings that I containerized and put in the freezer.
I feel that it needs a few spices to perk it up some but I'll do that as I defrost and eat the remaining servings.
I tried a few spices on my first bowl and that helped.
If you don't have bunches of excess freezer space I'd suggest that you make a half recipe.
I think this soup will improve with age and each batch will probably be more tasty than the last. I know my Celery Soups get better after sitting in the fridge long enough to defrost.
I eat a lot of soup recently and have found that most soup reduce down to VEGGIE smoothies quite nicely with a blender. Turning soup into smoothies improves the portability for on the go consumption.

Yummy soup for this time of year.  This recipe makes lots, had to use two large pots.  My changes to the recipe are as follows:  1)   I exchanged out the tomato juice for spicy vegetable juice.  2) I used 2 cans of Beef Broth (1 in each pot).   3) I used 2 packs of onion soup mix (1 in each pot).  4) I used 2 cans of green beans (1 in each pot).   The rest of the ingredients I split down the middle.  The cooking time went well over the suggested 45 mins.   Turned out just perfect if you like things just a bit spicy, if not stick with the plain tomato juice or vegetable juice.

I had to cut down on the onions and celery just to what I had and I have 5 huge Tupperwares full of soup. This would be at least 25-30 servings, I would guess. It is great soup with some added spices and it freezes well too. :)

This soup is wonderful for fall. I added one jalapeño, Italian seasoning, garlic and red pepper for little more kick. I don't do can beans. I used frozen cut green beans instead. Next time, I will half the recipe. There is enough for at least ten people.

First time I made this, following directions but using vegetable stock,(I'm vegetarian)it was so good that I decided to make it again, this time adding 1-cup (dry) beans, that I've home-cooked ahead) for protein.  It was also very good and now I make it with the beans all the time and freeze all but a few days' amount to be eaten within a couple of days. Even with the added beans, I've lost several pounds in three weeks!

Note:  I freeze it in pint containers, so I can thaw the right amount for each day.  To make the full recipe each time, I use a canning size pot. It really does make a lot!  Saves me time and helps me lose some extra weight.  What more could I ask!

This is a great dish for those who work long days.  I make a huge pot of it on Sundays and my husband and I take it to work for lunch.  It makes a lot so be sure you have a very large pot or cut it in half.  I use low sodium Spicy V8 instead of normal tomato juice so give it a bit more kick.  I also cook it a bit longer so the flavors blend.  Great low cal dish for the work week and a perfect way to use up veggies in the fridge!

I love making this soup, very simple and easily manipulated to suit your individual taste!  I use a 12 quart pot by the way.  I make this at night and let it cool down over night.  To customize the recipe, I've added other sources of protein like chickpeas and ground meat.  A personal favorite is ground turkey and beef.  Canned veggies are a great addition as well as switching which type of broth you use.  I pack this away for lunch and dinner.  Whatever is leftover, I freeze in gallon size plastic bags and keep for the next week!  I also eat this soup for lunch and dinner.  I have definitely lost a few pounds since beginning this last week.  Thank you for sharing Nell!

Holy smokes this makes a MASSIVE batch of soup, I only made half the recipe and my pot was full to the brim! I've made this a bunch of times, never the same twice. I don't eat meat, so I use vegetable broth and add in vegetarian sausage for a little protein. I also swap out veggies for other veggies, I have a pot cooking away on the stove right now with double carrots and celery, 2 small zucchini, no green beans or bell pepper. I also added in garlic! Even though I made a half batch I add in the whole packet of onion soup mix. I will take longer than 45 minutes start to finish, maybe an hour and a halfish.

A nice change to this recipe that makes it a little middle eastern:
add 1 cup golden raisins a can garbanzo beans and one or two squares of golden curry paste. it doesn't make it hot just warm.

Great recipe and definitely adaptable to whatever veggies you have. I added a can of black beans and small white beans for some protein.  It does make a ton of soup, but I thought all the amounts were just right.  It does last for quite some time in the fridge as well.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was soooo good! I have allergies, so I had to alter the recipe a bit. I omitted the soup mix and used herbs instead and omitted the canned green beans and used fresh organic ones instead. I had to omit the canned beef broth and used organic vegetable stock instead.  I also did not have any carrots on hand, but did have some eggplant that needed to be used soon, so I added that instead. What a wonderful soup, diet or not. I will eat this soup regularly. Thanks so much for sharing it! By the way, my picky "I hate vegetables" 7 year old loved it too! Thanks.

I made this last night and it was good for what it is.  I did exactly what the recipe said but like copied some suggestions and used Spicy V8.  I like things spicy so it made my mouth happy.  My 17 year old daughter loved it.  She ate 3 bowls.  I told her that it was good for her so she had another helping.

Made this tonight.  We used spicy v8 juice instead of tomato juice and made about 2/3rds of a batch.  Used purple cabbage instead of green and left out the onion soup mix as there's plenty of sodium in the v8 juice.  We really enjoyed this soup and I look forward to eating it frequently over the next few days.

Yum! Had to use up some veggies in the fridge, so opted to make this soup. Followed directions, except used Dry Beefy Onion soup mix (all I had), used more beef broth in lieu of water, and used Spicy V-8 tomato juice, as we like a lot of spice. This soup is great! Bonus that it is healthy, too! Thanks, Nell! I'll be making this frequently!

Love it. I used the food processor for the onions, celery and cabbage for a nice texture balance to everything. With the amount of canned stuff, I made sure everything I bought was low sodium or salt free. I added a bit of cayenne and garlic after it finished cooking.

I made a full pot of this soup and all I can say is thank you for this recipe ! It is the best soup I have every tasted in my 55 yrs. My husband said that it was the best he ever tasted as well. The only thing I added was a dash of red crushed pepper,garlic and onion powder. Fantastic soup and I am not a vegetable lover.

It was bland and the veggies all mushed together into one boring color. I added some zucchinis and left out the celery as I don't like it. Made a ton, I filled my crockpot and a stockpot all the way full. Froze a bunch of it and have the whole crockpot left to eat. 
Utilize all the spices you can, as it is very bland.

This make a HUGE pot of soup! It is delicious and I wish mine had more cabbage in it - the biggest head I could find was still on the small side. I used fresh green beans and doubled the beef broth, added Worcestershire sauce, black pepper, hot sauce and pepper flakes - I like flavor. I made another pot and changed the veggies slightly to include cauliflower which I had on hand and saved a copy on here. I add turkey meatballs for meal replacements. This will be my new winter work lunch, it will allow me to save money and lose weight, win-win!  If you decide to change the vegetables around and want to preserve the weight loss property, be very aware to avoid any starchy vegetables and limit vegetables that are high in sugar. I cooked mine about an hour, anymore than that and veggies will be too soft as they keep cooking until they cool and may cook a bit again when you warm up the soup.

I REALLY like this soup. It's tasty and satisfying. However, I made some minor changes to increase flavor without adding to the calories or fat.

I sweated the onions, carrots, and roughly chopped cabbage. I added bay leaves, thyme, oregano, cracked pepper, and Tabasco sauce.

I think it added more depth to the flavor profile.

This soup is really good and very forgiving. I don't think I have ever had all the ingredients, but it always comes out great. I like a few changes. I use fresh green beans and substitute the dry onion soup mix with parsley, bouillon, peppers and paprika. I also add some beans, whatever type I have around the house.

I have made this soup before as a tasty, light summer dinner.  Infact, have been making it off and on for the past 15 years! Yesterday, I made it and for the first time, I am following the 7 Day Cardiac Diet that goes along with it.  It is still as tasty as I remembered. To those using it for a diet, it specifically mentions in the diet literature that it is not meant to be eaten alone for long periods of time, you will suffer malnutrition. If you follow the diet to a T and don't cheat, you will lose 10-17 lbs. per week and never be hungry.

I remember doing a cabbage soup diet about 15 years ago and this is soooo much better than that recipe! I didn't make any changes to the soup and it was surprisingly flavorful and satisfying. It makes quite a bit, it barely fit in my large stock pot! I froze half of it and am eating a bowl for a meal somewhere in my day (or as a snack, just an available 'better choice' so I don't scrounge for something fattening). We'll see how the actual weight loss goes, I'm just happy to be eating something a little more beneficial!

This is addictive! Added mushrooms, then inspired by pho, to my bowl of soup, I added fresh basil, fresh mint, bean sprouts, 1/4 fresh lime and sriracha sauce. This will definitely become a staple in my house!

Super good!!! I like this better than clam chowder! Great recipe and from here on out I will always have some of this in my fridge! Not sure on weight loss for it yet, as it as barely cooled enough to eat, but that would be an extra perk.  This is worthy of 6 stars!!

I love this soup!  It's so low-calorie, filling, and easy to make.  I dropped 5-6 pounds of bloat after eating this for a few days!  I followed it almost exactly the first time I made it (but halving the recipe) using all low/no-sodium ingredients and simmering for about 45 minutes since I like my vegetables softer.  The second time, though, I wanted to cut even more sodium so I got rid of the dry onion mix and added some pepper, sea salt, and dried minced onion for the flavors (but I'm not sure how much of a difference the spices really made...).  The BEST thing I did, though, was add half a jalapeno pepper for an extra kick!  Delish.

Ya know... this soup is great for what it is. Not something everyone would ask you to make every week, but it is very flavorful and hearty for being a bunch of veggies. Only thing I did different was just to add one cube of bouillon. Oh and a bit of salt and pepper. Mom has always said " Eat your Vegetables"!

Tasty and easy soup to make.  I have no idea about the "fat burning" properties but looking at the calorie count I can see why you would loose weight eating this and this alone.  even though it is a healthy soup I would not make it the staple of your diet.  you need WAY more calories in a day then just 3 bowls of this soup will give you.  but it makes a TON and it is great for a quick lunch w/ a sammy or as an appetizer before a large meal.

Too much tomato taste, might leave out tomate juice  (that's the tomato taste I dont like, came thru too strong) Maybe more canned tomatoes, beef broth and maybe just a little tomato paste. Okay, I can eat this 2x a day, let the pounds start falling off!

I don't like cooked vegetables - it is a texture thing - so I puree this soup and it is delicious.  It tastes like V-8 juice, only better.  I added 10 oz of mushrooms and omitted the green beans to make it the authentic soup found on the internet.  I like it both warm and cold.

Delicious! My mom tried this diet back in the 90's and even as a kid I liked it so I was excited to find the recipe. I added a lb of ground turkey breast to it so my husband wouldn't ask "Where's the meat?" Other than that I didn't change a thing. Thanks for a great recipe.

I started making this soup and had a large pot, what was left out was you need a REALLY LARGE pot, like a vat. For those of us who don't cook that often a large pot is not going to be big enough, I'm having top wait for the cabbage to cook down.

I love making this soup on a cold blustery day like today.  I add a variety of seasonings to suit my mood at the moment (garlic salt, oregano, freshly ground s & p).  Also black beans and Morningstar Farms crumblers for some protien.  YUM !

Was looking for the original cabbage soup recipe for losing weight so was excited to try this.  Followed it exactly and was so disappointed.   All I could taste was tomato, bitey tomato and nothing else...no flavor at all.   It was a lot of work, makes a huge amount but is really disgusting.  I feel something must have been left out of this recipe.   Sorry

This is the first recipe that I have tried on AR and I was not disappointed! I literally could not stop eating the soup. I had three servings this afternoon after making it. Would definitely make this again!  Added curry powder which made the soup more lovely with an appetizing aroma and yummy aftertaste. I also added cayenne powder.

I love this recipe. It lasts me a week and really helps me reset the body when I've been less than healthy in my eating habits.  I make a few changes in mine though to add a bit more flavor. I half everything, except the green beans, using 1 yellow, 1 red onion, double the broth, add 3 cloves minced garlic, and some green onion near the end of the stew. I also add a couple teaspoons paprika and cumin, a couple teaspoons garlic salt and lots of black pepper. Love it.

I actually have not made this soup with the ingredients that this recipe calls for but im giving it 5 stars because I like the added ingredients it has. I can attest that this soup really does help you lose weight. I ate this for about two weeks, but I would always make some baked fish on the side to have with it and I lost a few pounds. And then with exercise I kept the weight off.   As the soup continues to sit it gets better everyday.

Thought it would be bland but I mad a few changes; didn't have tomato juice so I used V8 nor did I have any beef broth so I used beef base and add garlic powder and crushed red pepper to taste.  I also added 4 small onions recipe did call for a size.  It was surprisingly very good.

Not bad. Tastes pretty good for diet food, which is why I gave it four stars rather than three. I added 2 chipotle peppers, 2 serano peppers, and a tsp of smoked Spanish paprika. Next time I'll add more chipotle peppers. This keeps well in the fridge, but I will make smaller batches next time because it really only tasted great the first night.

Pretty darn good for a soup with no fat. I made a half recipe yesterday with exact ingredients. I added red pepper flakes, black pepper and oregano. I find the texture of cooked veggies to be gross, so I used my hand blender and pureed it right in the pot. This made it thicker and the tomato covers up the cabbage flavor.  Today I reheated some on the stove and put in some raw shrimp after it was simmering. Yum! Shrimp Cocktail soup

It was really good, I can't imagine how good it would be if I actually had all the ingredients!  I omitted/modified some stuff (like the carrots because I don't like them an veggie broth to make it vegetarian) and added some cayanne pepper to give it some heat.  Very yummy!

This recipe makes A LOT of soup.. I put the soup into small containers so my husband and I can eat throughout the week for lunch or a snack. When I first saw this recipe I thought it just sounded good and did not know it was a "diet". An added bonus to making this is not having to worry about it being a guilty pleasure.

Do you rate on taste or the "fat burning" aspect?  Five stars for the fat burning quality  - but three stars for the taste as written.  So I'll settle for four stars... there are better tasting cabbage soup options if you are just looking for taste.  This one is not bad though - I'll just say it tastes really healthy!!  :)

Okay so i'm not eating this (to picky :p) but my wife is trying to loose weight and we've heard about this. I made it last night and it does make A LOT! Only thing i added was some cayenne b/c she likes it hot. She said it tastes very good and i will update and let everyone know how much weight she lost :)

Really tasty, really versatile. I halved the recipe (still made a TON), used a 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes, and water instead of the tomato juice. Added a couple cloves of garlic and some mushrooms that needed to be used up. Added a generous amount of hot sauce for some zip. UPDATE: I've been eating on this all week and the flavor keeps getting better. I added a can of corn to the pot on the second night and have been stirring in a dollop of fat free plain yogurt when serving. Super delicious, I will make another pot next week. Thanks! :)

I'm doing this as a sort of "cleanse" after too much of *everything* this holiday season, and have to say, with the addition of cayenne, garlic, and sauerkraut as one reviewer suggested, I'm really enjoying it! (Beats that ridic water/maple-syrup/cayenne "cleanse" for sure!)

This soup had delicious flavor, especially considering how good-for-you it is.  I used the same ingredients as the original recipe, but my amounts may have been a little different - only 2 onions, a lot of baby carrots cut into chunks, frozen green beans.  I used chicken broth instead of beef, but that was the only real difference.  I look forward to eating more of this guilt-free soup!

As a lot of you have said, I tried this years ago, and it even came with a 7-day diet plan with different foods on different days.  Still a staple in my kitchen.    If you have a juicer, try putting the left overs in the juicer and you have instant (& great tasting!) vegetable juice for your next batch!!  I've even used it in my bloody mary cocktail.

I make this soup all the time in my crock pot! I love it and the only changes I make are some more spices and more vegetables. I also occasionally add chicken or chick peas, especially if I am following the diet. Also, it's great with spicy tomato juice! I portion and freeze the leftovers and they are wonderful!

A friend of mine did this diet and it did take off a few pounds for her.  I love cabbage and tomatoes, so this is perfect for me.  A great way to cleanse and start off to eating healthier.  I'm eating it for breakfast right now.  I did however change it to my liking.  1/2 a cabbage head, 3 celery stalks, 1/2 onion, 1 onion soup packet, 1 V8 low sodium Juice, 3 carrots, white button mushrooms (sliced), 1 tsp garlic powerder and 1 cilantro bouillon.  I simmered it for a little over an hour.  Love it!!!

My boyfriend looked at the pot quizzically, and I explained to him "its good, its healthy and filling and a great way to get your veggies in. Its something easy for weekday lunches." I think that is the best way to describe the soup. Its not outstandingly delicious or something I would ever crave, but it hits the spot. It was a great opportunity to get rid of all the veggies I had in the fridge. I omitted the carrots and added cremini and white mushrooms, bok choy, zucchini, leeks and used fresh green beans. Also, I found I need more liquid because of all the extra veggies I added, so used more beef broth.

Hearty healthy choice for lunch or dinner! I made the full batch exactly like the recipe and added different spices (like cayenne, garlic, cumin, garam masala, etc) each time before I heated up a serving. It kept it interesting and I didn't get bored eating the same thing so much!

I liked this soup a lot, and it didn't leave me feeling hungry. I split this recipe and made it for six servings instead of 15. I only used half a head of cabbage and added extra veggies, including chopped tomatoes, a can of garbanzo beans for protein, and the whole can of green beans. I used half water/ half chicken broth for the liquid to add flavor. I also seasoned with plenty of cracked pepper and garlic powder and it added a nice taste to the broth as well. I didn't have any onion soup mix, so I added a beef boullion cube and minced dried onions as a replacement. In a couple of servings I've heated through with a polish sausage added in, and it makes a very nice addition to the soup. I will make this again!
UPDATE: Try adding italian seasoning to the soup while it simmers. It gave the PERFECT flavor, just the touch I was looking for! It's a 5 star recipe with that one change.

Great soup! Spiced it up with some red pepper flakes and regular black pepper.  Did not add tomato juice, the juice from the whole tomatoes gave it enough flavor.   Have been having it for dinner every night this week and I still look forward to having some when I get home at night.

All the veggies in the soup really appealed to me, but I don't know if I'd make it again. Maybe without the onion soup mix? This was the first time I've ever used that soup mix and it was pretty salty. I also added garlic. If I make it again I'll add garbanzos and some different seasonings instead of the soup mix.

This soup does exactly what it's designed to do--it helps you lose weight.  I ate this for lunch 5 days in a row last week, ran 12 miles, and lost two pounds.  The cabbage overwhelms the other flavors though--and I don't love cabbage so I'm going to make it this week without it.

I have made this recipe twice so far. The first time I followed the recipe exactly. I found the onion a bit over-powering and really didn't understand why it called for whole tomatoes, the flavor from the tomato juice was "ok" but not great in my opinion. The second time I made the following changes: Used 1 onion and sauteed it first before adding the other ingrediants, I used diced tomato and I omitted all the tomato juice and just used organic chicken broth. I preferred the second version by a landslide! I have been making this soup to lose weight in conjuction with using weight watchers. I have a bowl whenever I'm feeling really hungry or at the beginning of a meal, so that I cut down on how much I eat.

The only thing that I did differently was add 1 can of rotel tomatoes and a few shakes of red pepper flakes. It was spicy and delicious!!!  I usually make a pot of soup on Saturday to have lunches through out the week, this week I lost 4 lbs! Thanks for a good recipe.

I love it! I could definitely eat this for lunch every day and not get sick of it. I've been trying to lose 20 pounds for the past year or so, and I look forward to having this virtually fat-free soup to eat! My only recommendation is to use low-sodium tomato juice as the base. I picked the regular one, not thinking about it, and it's a wee bit too salty for moi. Otherwise it is DELICIOUS, I'm eating it right now. Also I did not realize that "large pot" meant stock pot until my large pot was filled to the brim with soup. With careful attention, it did not boil over, but I'll probably reduce the veggies a tiny bit next time so that it fits. Thanks for this recipe!!! Next time I think I'll try adding ground turkey to it.

Great soup, I did manage to lose about 7 pounds in one week! It does make a ton of soup though, more than I could eat in a week!

Wow! This recipe makes a lot of soup! I made only half the recipe; I didn't have a big enough pot for a whole recipe! I did add some dried parsley, oregano, and basil for added flavor, as well as a bay leaf. I also put in a can of kidney beans for protein. The soup was very good, warm and comforting on a cold night! I will appreciate the leftovers as well. Thanks for a good and easy recipe!

I love this soup!  My changes were:  I used two cans of chicken broth, and one quart of V8 juice (low sodium) and one quart of spicey hot V8 juice.  I didn't use the onion soup mix because my son is allergic to dairy and it has Lactose in it.  Also, I only used one bell pepper.  It makes a huge pot.  We will be eating it for days.

This is definitely a good soup, but it needs just a touch more flavor. I may add a small can of green chiles. I agree with another reviewer that the purpose of the soup is for weight loss, so if that is why you are making it, be careful what you add.

Important to note is that this recipe makes a TON of soup. I used a 10 quart stock pot and the vegetables came to almost the top of my pot! Be sure to use a large pot.

The recipe states 15 servings, so as I made it, each serving is over 2 cups. Seriously, this made a lot of soup.

My sister and I both have done this diet and she lost almost 40 lbs within about a year of doing this on and off. I didn't have enough will power to do this diet longer then a week. All your suppose to eat is this soup plus a baked potato on Tuesdays and some meat on Thursdays and Friday and all the soup you can eat. I will eat this soup now as a meal replacement or just whenever and it is excellent!! It is chocked full of veggies and sooo good for you. Its an excellent recipe!!!

This soup has an excellent, yet unique flavor. My husband and I really enjoyed it, and I'm hoping it does the job:-)
I did add a couple of cans of whole kernel corn, and I left out the bell peppers. I added a sprinkle or 2 of garlic powder and kicked it up with some Louisiana hot sauce to give it some heat! Great Recipe!

Like stated by others this makes a ton; I halved the recipe and it does require "doctoring", spicy V8 juice, red pepper flakes,...your choice.  However if you make it a day or two in advance it does mellow nicely.  Does the job though, used it to take the edge of my appetite so I can eat lower calorie, ha ha.

I did a modified half version of this recipe to suit my own tastes, but I stayed close to the main recipe.  After some tasting, I added some frozen corn as well as minced garlic and Italian seasoning.  I still thought it was a little strong with the tomato base and added more water as I went.  Also, I used 3 beef bouillon cubes in place of the broth.  All together, pretty good.  I am going to keep playing with it because I like the "fat-burning" part of it!

You will need a LARGE pot for this recipe.  I have a 10 liter stock pot and it was nearly full with soup when I made this.  I used 3/4 of a green cabbage.  I used a mandoline slicer for the cabbage which saved a lot of prep time.  Two quarts of tomato juice isn't nearly enough liquid for this soup.  I prefer mellow tomato-based soups, not too thick with tomato, so I mellowed the tomato flavor with an extra two quarts water.  Also added a cup of red wine (whatever I had) and a splash of W-sauce.

I really loved this soup!  It was so easy to make and it really quite tasty. I halved the recipe and it still made QUITE a bit (will end up freezing some). I also used the Spicy V8 juice instead of regular tomato juice and that added the kick I feel it needed.  Great recipe - will make again!

This was a VERY tasty recipe.  I cut it in half after reading all reviews that it made too much.  I followed the recipe except added frozed okra, minced garlic and cayenne pepper.  After it simmered for awhile I felt that it needed a bit more salt, so I added garlic salt.  What a great recipe!  I never thought I would be able to get the hubby to eat cabbage soup, but he practically licked his bowl!  (He added a slice of provolone cheese on the top of his bowl)

Diet food or not, this soup is just great! Since some other people mentioned that this was a little bland I used Italian crushed tomatoes (instead of the whole peeled) and V8's 'Hot and Spicey' tomato juice. I didn't put in any green peppers since I don't like their flavor and I forgot the green beans, but the soup came out just fantastic. Really, the flavor is great and it's quite satisfying...and I don't even like cabbage. Thanks a bunch!

Good recipie. Very flavorful and hearty.  I used garden dill soup mix in place of onion and it really gives the soup a fresh flavor.  I couldn't give this a 5 star rating because there is a ton of sodium in the tomato juice.  I used low sodium tomato juice, but still its loaded with sodium.  I cut back on the celery but added some left over cauliflower and it works really well  in the soup.  I also used fresh green beans instead of canned and diced tomato instead of whole.  Overall a very good soup.

Excellent!  I used low sodium V-8, omitted the onion soup mix to further reduce the sodium content, and tweaked it with a little corn, tobasco, and some salsa for more flavor. I plan on making a pot of this soup tomorrow, and eating it all week for lunch and dinner in addition to 1/2 a sub from subway.   This recipe makes quite a bit of soup, but it keeps well for days in the fridge.

Awesome, healthy recipe. Not for everyone, but I LOVE the mix of vegetables in this. Great to take to work, so I freeze individual freezer bags full. For variety I'll take something extra to add to it on different days: shrimp, sausage or a bit of cream. As has been said, it does make a lot -  but what a great way to have something healthy on hand right out of the freezer.

Makes lots!  Not that anyone would want to eat this much soup.  Tastes like anything diet usually tastes.  Blah.  I couldn't eat it longer than 3 days.  I needed something that tasted good.

The beauty of this recipe is its versatility - 1. Just add whatever veggies you have (more often than not I add a potato chopped small) 2. It's also great with kidney beans or black-eye beans. 3. For a heartier soup/stew throw in some sliced brats or kielbasa, or cooked and crumbled bacon. You can even add pasta so that it is more minestrone-like. Fantastic!

This soup was very tasty. My dad even liked it.  Added salt and pepper to taste, as well as hot sauce.  But, makes too much to store!!  I think I would only make 1/2 batch next time.  Also would add more veggies - corn, beans, potatoes etc.

Tasted great!  I added some black pepper, chilie powder, and garlic.  It made MUCH more than I needed, living on my own, I could have quartered the recipe and had plenty.

This was an excellent recipe for our family.  It made quite a bit, which left plenty to freeze for another 2 meals.  I used V8 juice for my tomato juice and cut back a bit on the water.  The remainder thawed easily from the freezer and I added meatballs to the soup which my husband and 9yr old son loved!

I had this recipe a long time ago but I lost it. I have been looking for it ever sence. When I first got it I was told that it was a fast fat burner and that it is a recipe that doctors give heart pateints that need to lose weight real fast before they go into surgery. It dosen't taste that bad and it is a whole lot better tasteing then most diet food. It is for a big batch but it can be frozen in smaler batches and heated up when wanted. I will be making it often.

I didn't have tomato juice so I substituted more broth (chicken instead of beef) and added a can of tomato paste.  Also used a lot of tobasco sauce for a little spice. I didn't use green beans, though but added everything else. This was very yummy!

Yummy!
This is a weekly staple I make on Sunday afternoons now. I know as long as I have some on hand all week I have something healthy to eat.
I made some subs for veggies I didn't like and used vegetable stock instead of beef. It was still good. Make sure you give yourself a little extra time to cut the vegetables and have larger pot than you think you need for cooking.

I fell in love with this soup. So far this winter I've made it every two weeks. The only change I've made is adding LOTS of mushrooms. I love mushrooms and they are very healthy. One other small change is I prefer V8 juice over tomato juice.

I loved this recipe, though I must admit I did make a couple of changes. I used homemade bone broth in place of purchased stock, 2 large fresh chopped tomatoes in place of canned, fresh green beans in place of canned, and no soup mix because I don't use spice packets. Instead I added 1 TBS salt, 1 tsp ginger, 1 tsp pepper, 1 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp sage, 2 tsp garlic powder.

This was so bad. This is my first review ever.. The tomato juice is entirely overpowering and way too much. Plus, not sure how it is fat burning if the juice has SO Much added sugar and salt!! It just tastes like V8 with veggies.  It made way too much (didn't fit in my large pot) and was so hard to keep eating. (I hate wasting food!)

Really nice recipe! If I have a gripe, it's that it made a LOT! I mean, A LOT. I made this soup 4 days ago, and I'm still working on it, after freezing half! It has a nice flavor, and is quite filling. I'd def recommend it, whether you want to lose weight or not.

I used all fresh veg except the canned tomatoes. I also added fresh mixed beans I soaked for 4 hours. It is delicious!  It makes. TON of soup so may half it or make the full and freeze some. It’s really delicious with paprika, chili powder, and cayenne pepper. Makes it spicy and yummy. I’ve definitely lost weight. It’s super filling but very low calorie.

Delicious! The possibilities with this soup are endless!
I made it just they way it read, but I did add some minced garlic, parsley and white pepper. Oh, I left out the green beans. Didn't have any. Also, I used Better than Bouillon instead of canned beef broth. I think it has more flavor.
 Love this recipe. So healthy! Next time I may add some shredded chicken or beans....

I made this with my kids, as is, no changes. It was really good and filling. Took about 2 hrs from start to finish and vegetables could still have been simmering longer. Next time I will adjust the recipe adding different spices to try for different variations. Definitely a good soup, very healthy and easily freezable. Make sure you have a large stock pot, this makes a lot of soup.

Finally made this soup and we love it,  beside it being healthy for you, we just love the taste of it.  Like many other reviewers I did add a couple of things to make it have a bit of a kick.  I added a medium size zucchini and used sweet onions, also added, 1 tbsp. parsley, 1 tbsp. oregano, 1 tbsp. basil, 1 tbsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp  cumin and 1 tsp black pepper.  It really made it taste great and nothing else was needed. It also freezes great.  Thank you for this great recipe.

Making it for a third time. The only change I make is to leave out the peppers, but I add garbanzo beans for some added protein.

I have made several versions of this "diet soup" recipe before but I love this one the most.  It is very flavorful and filling.  I would highly recommend making a big batch of this if you want something that tastes great and helps you lose weight.

This soup was recommended for my brother when he had  heart bypass surgery.  It's delicious and I love making this just to enjoy, not necessarily just for weight loss or weight maintenance.

I cut the recipe to 8 servings but used a whole package of soup mix, vegetable broth, and added garlic, fresh green beans, a few sprigs of thyme and a couple bay leaves. Less vegetable juice also but it was still pretty juicy. I simmered longer so the cabbage would be nice and tender. Very nice on a cold day! Thank you.

I love this soup!! You can alter how spicy you like it as well as playing with different veggies and herbs to keep it interesting!  And for those who are like me and need protein, you can add cooked ground turkey, shredded chicken, etc to get that protein in without adding too many calories. I’ve lived this for years!

I’ve been making this soup for YEARS now. Here are some tips I’ve picked up along the way:

Use one large can of diced tomatoes and one large can of crushed. It makes a “meatier” stew without having those large random pieces of tomatoes that you’ll inevitable cut up. Absolutely add in a ton of spices and garlic along with the onion mix—I’ll  add in everything from cilantro, paprika, Italian seasoning, bay leaves and/or cayenne pepper! Add in a diced jalapeño or two for a kick. After trial and error, this soup is best made on the stove top rather than trying to make it in a slow cooker. It takes about 2-3 hours to really cook so the carrots and celery are fully cooked. This soup tastes AMAZING the days after you make it and the flavors melt together. It also keeps for a long time as it’s mostly veggies and beef broth can keep for up to a week. And finally.... this soup will definitely give you gas so just a heads up lol.

After an indulgent vacation of eating and drinking I decided to we this soup. The soup I sent not very tasty at all. Very bland and the first day I almost gagged so 2 stars for taste, the 4 star rating for working. I guess fat burning soup I should not going to taste good to work. Not quite sure how often to eat it but it makes a LOT. The first day I ate this for dinner with a light breakfast and lunch, day two and three I ate this for lunch with a breakfast smoothie and a light dinner. The bloat is gone and I am down 4 pounds:) Going to freeze some and continue eating this for lunch. I also eliminated processed foods eating only Whole Foods.

Delicious! I actually forgot the onion soup (and was too lazy to go buy it afterwards) so I added basil, thyme salt and pepper and it turned out amazing! Make sure you cook it in huge pots, cuz this recipe makes lots of soup.

I would definitely make again.  Some changes I made, one less onion, did not use onion soup mix but used a combination of celery seed, cayenne, salt and curry.  My cabbage was really large so saved about a quarter of it for coleslaw.  Cut the tomato juice in half but added water as needed to get the right consistency.  It was great! Thanks!

I love this soup!  I made a few changes to the recipe because I'm a picky eater and lazy cook.  I hate green beens so I left it out and just placed a little more cabbage and bell peppers in place of it and added some ground black pepper.  Also, instead of regular tomato juice, I used a big bottle of low sodium V8 vegetable juice and instead of a can of beef broth, I used 1 teaspoon of Organic Better than Boullion beef base which you can purchase at Costco and a can of water.  I know this soup would have been just as good without the substitutions.  I ate a bowl as-is then added some tobasco sauce to my second bowl.  Both ways are delicious.  If you're not eating this as a diet soup, you can add chunks of beef, macaroni, pasta, or cheese to make this a meal for everyone and anyone.

I altered the recipe. I added carrots and string beans. I also add parsley, oregano, thyme (just a little bit) and added black pepper, more  than the ingredients stated, to give the soup a little afterward kick. It sneaks up on you after eating the scoop of soup. Also I added chicken stock and lemon juice to cut the tomato taste. I’m not a huge fan of the strong tomato taste. If you  do like that strong tomato taste, don’t add the stock or lemon. If you are not fan either then try it my way. Pour a little each time to test how it taste. I can’t give you a measurement. It’s what your taste buds like. I hope you like my additions.

I did NOT make this to lose weight; I just clicked on it because I had cabbage on hand, and made it because I had all the ingredients. It is delicious! I used low sodium V8 and low sodium beef broth. My husband and I both love it. He's been eating it for lunch every day for a week and isn't sick of it yet - he actually comments daily how good it is! We like a lot of spices and flavor so I didn't expect us to enjoy this, but it really is tasty without any added spices. Note this does make a LOT of soup. It filled my soup pot to the brim. (Reminder to those as silly as me, it will rise a little as it heats so make sure you're not at the brim to start - mine didn't overflow but I had to watch it closer than I wanted to.) I simmered for 20-30 minutes then left it warming on low, due to the precarious overflow possibility, for probably 2-2.5 hours (much longer than I thought I would need to, but I was distracted with a newborn and house guests) and it was perfectly done. I tried puréeing a portion and adding it back in for a creamier broth as another reviewer suggested, but my husband and I both thought it was better in its original form. Final note, as expected, this does NOT fill you up for a long time, so if you're not looking to lose weight, it is delicious and nutritious as a side to a hefty sandwich. ;)

Just made it for dinner tonight but no weight loss as of yet. :) It’s delicious though and effortless to make. The only tweak I did was 5 cloves sliced garlic and Spicy V-8 in place of the tomato juice. It made ALOT so making a half batch to try it may not be a bad idea.

I made this according to the recipe, but halved all the ingredients, as I couldn't imagine having that much soup! I thought it turned out very well and was quite tasty prepared as described. I also followed one of the other reviewer's suggestion regarding adding ground turkey to provide a little protein to the base. After the soup was done, I bottled and froze in smaller portions, and then prior to heating up each portion, I braise a small portion of ground turkey with cumin, and then add the cooked turkey to the soup and simmer for a few minutes to mix in the flavor.  Delicious and surprisingly filling.

First, this makes a LOT of soup. Cutting it in half will not leave any one hungry. Even growing up in a family of seven this would have lasted us a few days.  Second they left out any seasoning. Add salt and pepper as you like and on day two I added celery seed and was finally happy with the results.

I used my own homemade beef or chicken broth with diced chicken or lean ground or diced beef. While boiling in the soup pot I ladled into canning jars, they sealed when they cooled and stored in frig for up to 3 months. I used this soup when I wanted more to eat while on my 1500 calorie a day diet and lost 50 lbs in 4 months. I also road my stationary bike for at least an hour each day. I really liked the soup but had to drink milk with it for my acidic stomach. Oh yea and it burned fat from legs and belly, it was great. If you mess with the vegies you will not lose the weight as fast. The vegie combination is designed to burn fat not impress your taste buds or personal likes!!

I am a dedicated carnivore so I didn't expect much in flavor out of this.  I was surprised when I made it.  This is really good.  It makes a ton of soup, but it freezes well, so have room in your freezer.  I made it as written, and also have substituted "Wow! I could have had a spicy vegetable juice" for the water.  You can add squash, sweet potatoes, or really any veggies you want, but staying away from white potatoes or corn would be a good idea if you want to loose weight.  I also like to add sliced hot peppers, black pepper and some Stevia for sweetness.  I love sweet / spicy.  This is way better than it sounds.  You don't have to go on some extreme eat this all day diet, just try replacing one meal per day, or even just the snacks with this to help lose a few lbs.

OK, I like cabbage and have made this soup in the past. It has gone around the block a few times and even gained the name "Mayo Clinic Cabbage Soup." However, even the Mayo Clinic admits that it should only be used occasionally and for no more than 1 week at a time ). Actually, this is just an extreme low cal diet, and unfortunately much of the weight loss is water and possibly some muscle. So be careful with it.

This stuff's not bad!  I thought it would be kind of an annoying veggie-fest but basically tastes like a good vegetable soup.  I happen to like the amount of the cabbage in the soup, and it softens up a lot and loses that... "cabbage" taste, so I found the amount tolerable.  If you like less, use a cabbage smaller than a bowling ball and chop it up in smaller pieces, should be good.  Great for losing swelling if you're trying to avoid salt too, but it does tend to be pretty bland if you use low sodium everything.  I found that stirring in a 1/2 tsp of better-than-beef bouillon was perfect.  I also added 2 lbs of ground turkey (not the stuff from the store - the kind straight from the farm to a local drop point that you buy in bulk, it's more like a turkey thrown through a fan than the mush you get in the tubes).  I found the turkey gave it the protein it's lacking as-is.  Oh also 6-8 cloves of garlic doesn't hurt anything =D  And garlic's good for you too.

Oh btw, the weight loss you get from this is just water weight.  It has almost no carbs, and for every one gram of carbohydrate stored in the body (as glycogen) there is approximately 2-3 grams of water retained.  You lose the stored carbs VERY quickly (and hence, the water weight) if this is all you eat, but it'll come back once you get carbs back in there.  Try going keto if you want to keep that effect going *and lose real fat.

Since I was not making this for a diet, I added 1 lb of browned hamburger to the recipe.  Also could use a pound of ground turkey if you don't want beef in it.  I will be making this again this winter.  Great soup.  Loved it.

My wife made this today and we've tried several recipes for this - OUTSTANDING. A lot of flavor.  She added a bit of hot sauce and pepper. This is to die for. Froze most of it but left enough to be refrigerated and eaten as we want it. Makes A LOT!

I have been making this recipe for about a year.  I did drop 10 pounds eating it once a day.  I have made minor changes to the spices, and used vegetable broth rather than beef.  I would like to know if anyone has canned this?  If so is it safe to do in a hot water bath or should it be done in a pressure canner?  There are so many of these ingredients that are in season this time of year that it would be a no-brainer to can this in September.

For starters: I love cabbage soup, I did not make this just for the weight loss. HOWEVER, I do want to drop some pounds and thought this seemed interesting. I followed the recipe almost exact except I substituted the green beans for mushrooms (ew green beans in soup?) this made a HUGE pot of soup. I would recommend possibly cutting this recipe in half because it was a lot - I did not realize this recipe was so huge. I put spicy v8 instead of tomato juice and used two onion packets instead of one. I also added a lot of red pepper flakes. I thought this tasted amazing, and so did every other member of my family. In the future I would change the ingredients a little bit because this cost me about $20 to make. I would rather go buy tomatoes instead of the canned ones, and later learned there is frozen bags of the carrots, onions, and celery called a mirepoix mix. With the veggies I did not really measure so I know that some of the vegetables I did not put as much in as the recipe. I did add this in as a meal for MyFitnessPal the way I made it and found out why it is a "weight loss soup". With 15 servings the whole pot of soup has 1,080 calories - 72 calories a serving! I am going to include the recipe I added in to get these. So assuming a person can't eat 15 servings a day (this pot is huge you can't) that's how you lose weight. I ate this on and off, about two servings a day. I am going to be more strict this week to see if I get any results. I'd recommend this for school or th

so I first made this for myself and tried very hard to only eat it but it got to the point where I was dreading every meal. I doctored it every which way I could with different spices. You are probably wondering why I still have it 5 stars? Well, one day my kids were begging for spaghetti and I had no sauce. So I had the idea to add garlic, oregano and basil to this soup. I will tell you that they (anf my husband who HATES it when I make 'healthy food') loved it and I was secretly doing the happy dance cause they never figured it out that it is completely 100% veggies! muahahahahaha  so now I make cabbage soup as our spaghetti sauce and do not begrudge when they ask for it!

I left the green peppers out because I don't have any. But overall great soup! Also I didn't use a whole head of cabbage either. I also used 32 oz of beef stock low sodium.

This has quickly become a favorite. Made a batch and it has lasted me all week. Great for an easy lunch or dinner and super filling. I ate this soup, cut out carbs and dropped 3 lbs this week! I did leave out the green peppers. Just not a fan.

Very similar to the weight watchers all you can eat soup.  I add V8 spicy tomatoe juice for a little kick.  I start it in the morning by afternoon its ready to go.  I only use fresh veggies and add spinach and kale I leave out onion soup mix personally i dont like all the additional sodium and find if you use good quality beef broth and regular onions you can forego the soup mix.  I recommend freezing if you make a large pot.  Without the perservatives it can turn in 4 days.  I usually keep about four days worth out freeze rest.  Also everyday i put some on stove and whenever through the day i get hungry or a craving i grab a bowl.  You definitely can eat this and feel no guilt!

I used low fat low sodium  chicken stock instead of beef and added about 1lb of grilled white chicken.  I also used V8 instead of tomato juice  and only 3/4 of a head of cabbage. .
One of my guests was hesitant because of memories of his Mother's cabbage soups but  after 2 bowls of this and a large take home container he is a changed man. . .

I followed the recipe. I used a huge stock pot and it wouldn't fit! I had to use a second pot. The vegetables do not get soft if 15 minutes. Also I don't understand using whole tomatoes...? Aside from that, this recipe has a really good flavor. I will make it again but next time I will use dived tomatoes and reduce some of the ingredients so it will fit into one pot. Also I recommend cooking soup a bit longer and adding the cabbage during the last 15 minutes because the cabbage cooks faster than the carrots and peppers etc.

I cut the recipe in half and it still made a TON of soup. Really impressed with the flavor.  I would maybe add a tad less water than I did to make it thicker,  but it is pretty tasty and simple to make. Love that I will have it for the next few days. I almost love that I can eat as much as I want  without guilt. Will definitely be making this again.

I've made this soup 4 times so far.  I use red or yellow bell peppers occasionally, but for the most part I make it as written.  I absolutely LOVE it!  Extra benefit is that it's a satisfying, nutritious meal with very few calories.  It keeps well all week in the refrigerator,  but I probably eat more of this than I should  cause it just  calls my name before lunchtime.   I'll be  making it many, many more times.  Thank you SO much for sharing.

2 WORDS...PRESSURE COOKER! I have made this twice and both times it came out great in my 10 Quart pressure cooker and only 7 minutes. It makes A LOT of SOUP! The only main ingredient I changed was instead of green pepper (didn't have) I added half a bag of frozen peas. I seasoned it with garlic, basil, turmeric, Worcestershire and a splash of apple cider vinegar for a zing. It gets even better the next day!

I added 2 jalapenos and other spices as I read other reviews that it was a little bland. I also cooked 2 chicken breast and shredded it in to add some lean meat. My wife and I loved it! One word of caution is to watch the serving size. I cut the recipe in half and almost didn't have enough room in my biggest stock pot.

I love this soup but have not lost any weight in 5 days.   I left out the dry soup mix because of sodium.     It's healthy and tasty but I was hopeful to lose some pounds.     Anyone know how many calories in let's say a small soup bowl?

I made this yesterday, had some for lunch today, was good, but missing something. Came home to heat up another bowl and it hit me! I added some dill and a spoonful of sour cream. Yum!  My husband just had a root canal done today and was so hungry, I used my hand held blender, added the dill and sour cream and it was a big hit!  He slurped it all up!

I haven't lost more than a few pounds after a month of eating this soup 1 meal a day but it's a healthy lunch that tastes pretty good. I had to buy a bigger pot to make it.

This recipe makes A LOT of soup. I know I shouldn't be reviewing this recipe as I altered it to my personal taste, but what is cooking if not experimenting from already made recipes? The ingredient list is great but for my tastes bland, I knew I wouldn't like it plain and simple as it is. I sautéed the onion in the pot with ground turkey with a little salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. The red pepper flakes were a nice spicy addition to the broth. Next time I would cut down on the cabbage, one full head was too much for my tastes. I couldn't taste the onion soup mix in the broth so next time I would double that or leave it out completely.

I really enjoyed this soup.  I followed some suggestions and added various spices.  The soup has a very similar taste to MD crab (minus the crab).  So, i did like most Marylanders - I added Old Bay.  Delicious and passed the Mother-In-Law test!

I have made this soup in the past.  I suggest using less canned items such as the broths and buy in tetra pack.  Otherwise it has a tin taste to it.

This is a great soup recipe, but it can be bland... the one thing I add to it that makes everyone in my house LOVE it, is 1 can of corned beef.  The calories added are so little compared to the flavor, and I honestly can't keep a pot to myself for an extended diet... my kids eat it faster than I can.  Keep in mind, only use CANNED corned beef (NOT hash!) and the difference is amazing.

I made it as directed but I felt it either needed more of something and less of something else.  The second time I made it there were a few changes.  I left out the onion soup and tomato juice and tomatoes and substituted a chopped onion and a can of stewed tomatoes.  I reduced the amount of cabbage to get more broth and added white pepper, red pepper, black pepper, and file powder to give it a little spice and release some endorphins.  This one came out so good I didn't even miss the bacon I was tempted to include.  I make my soup in small batches that takes about 15 minutes from start to finish.  I could never understand why anyone would freeze soup.  It takes longer to thaw than to make from scratch.

Recipe makes a very large pot of soup which is amazingly filling. I had a small bowl of it for breakfast and was not hungry until lunch. I can definitely see how this promotes weight loss  it is also very tasty as well.

I have a couple of comments.  First of all, it took me an hour to chop all those vegetables.  Not 20 min as suggested in the directions.  Secondly, you need a massive pot to hold all the ingredients.  I had to use two pots. Thirdly, it needs more spice.  And fourth, it took hours to cook until the vegetables were tender.  Otherwise, it's very good.

This is a great,hearty and tasty soup. I added some Tabasco to it for a kick. This is an easy way to eat and lose weight. I made up my mind I would eat it for two meals a day for at least a week and then one meal a day after that for another week. Then we'll see. This one recipe make a huge amount so be prepared.

It is easy to make minor changes to this recipe without compromising  the benefits. I add some herbs, garlic and  sodium free seasoning.  I also add  "free veggies", such as zucchini, broccoli,  cauliflower, or whatever else I have in my fridge.  I sometimes substitute vegetable or chicken broth for the beef broth, just to change up the flavor.

I would say that if you make this recipe you need a SUPER LARGE pot.  I made it with a regular sized pot.  Fortunately I know how to cook and was able to alter it on the fly to fit my pot.  New cooks or cooks not able to do this would have a heck of a time.  Thus the poor rating given.

I  made this with some changes.  I used the ingredients, But  I only added  one onion,  I used one half  green/ one half purple cabbage.  I added one  red bell pepper, with the green,  three parsley roots, peeled and diced.  I cut up the whole tomatoes.  I used 2 qtrs., low sodium V8 juice.  omitted onion soup mix and used two tbl. vegetable based bouillon.   I was trying to cut back on the salt.   It came out Delish!  I'm going for my second bowl!

Made it! I'm using it in my 21 Day Fix program and I've lost 10 pounds in 2  weeks and I'm sure this recipe helped. I made it "Fix Friendly" and omitted the soup mix and just used the veggies and some chicken broth. Added mushrooms because I had them on hand and left out the ones I didn't have. Just as delicious and filling.

I would not change anything on this recipe to lose weight. I AM losing weight on it. If I get hungry after eating it later, I eat another bowl instead of my typical fat chips, NOT kidding and I STILL lose weight.  Top notch.  I actually LIKE this soup since I love veggies.

My wife and business partner loved this.  I added some Frank's hot sauce and Worcestershire  sauce. It was incredibly easy and there was a ton of it.  I don't normally eat anything that doesn't feature meat but the truth is that I really enjoyed it too.  Don't tell.

I'm changing my rating from four to two stars because after the first day, neither my husband or I could stand this any more and threw out the whole (giant) pot of it.

There's way too much cabbage. It smells and gives you horrible and embarrassing digestive upset. I think that is unnecessary and makes this recipe rather ridiculous. I couldn't give it a very high rating when the cabbage is its central ingredient.

The broth base was easy and flavorful and I will use that again (tomato juice or V-8 plus canned beef broth/stock). I might try it again with other very low vegetables instead of the cabbage.

I made this soup today. I sauteed The carrots, celery, onion, and garlic for about 5 minutes then added vegetable juice, 2 cans beef broth, and onion soup mix. Added oregano and basil.  Then I simmered those vegetables about 5 minutes more before adding  the cabbage and peppers.  I  cooked the cabbage and peppers last  for about another 5 minutes.

The first time I made this soup, I made it exactly by the recipe and it tastes fine just like it is. Then I started adding some type of meat for more protein.  Either way, I suggest you follow the recipe the first time just to see how you like it because there are a lot of ways you can season it to your personal taste.  Sometimes I even put hot sauce in it. For those who think there is too much cabbage in it....well, it IS a CABBAGE soup.  You can always use less..One word of warning...It makes a humongous amount of soup so you better have a BIG pot. I just freeze what ever is left.

I made this soup as listed in the recipe. It is delicious! It really makes a lot. I divided the soup into different containers. For a change during the weekI added different ingredients to each container when I heated it up. One time I folded salmon chunks into the soup. Yum! I added hot sauce one day. I added ginger one day. Great to have this on hand all week and I have lost some weight!  Yay! Thanks for the recipe!!!

I have been making this for my Hubby for 3 months now, 1/2  batch about every 6 or 7 days. He loves it and has lost some weight. He even helps with the prep. We changed up from beef broth to chicken for a little variety and he seasons with a bit of adobo or hot sauce and even ketchup or mustard to make it less boring. Try using different seasonings now and then to keep it new. We leave out the peppers, since they do not agree with us, but soup is still quite good.

It's the standard "weight watchers " soup. The purpose is to use lots of cabbage.

I love this soup, and have been making it for several years.  Each serving is very low in calories, high in nutrition and fiber, and is very satisfying on a cold winter day.  When dieting it's the perfect thing to have on hand in the refrigerator because you can grab a cup and heat in the microwave in just a couple of minutes and have a hot satisfying treat that won't spoil your dinner a couple of hours later.

I didn't expect soup to have me lose any weight, I think that's a little foolish. Burning fat and losing weight are entirely different things. The soup was great, the only changes I made was to use normal seasonings, not the preservative loaded onion soup mix and fresh green beans instead of canned. Turned out great for my family. Can't say it helped my thighs any but maybe that's cause I ended up eating too much! :)

I love this soup!  I leave out the onion soup mix because it disagrees with my digestive tract.  I sometimes use vegetable juice (low sodium) instead of tomato juice, but everything else is the same as the recipe.  I ladle it into plastic cups after it cools, cover it with plastic wrap and freeze it.  It is in perfect portions for me to thaw and microwave anytime I feel like soup.  Delicious!

I have not actually made this yet, but I am just reviewing it since it reminds me so much of my mom's vegetable soup recipe - heavy on the cabbage! And I also wanted to add a tip:  add a handful of uncooked barley to the soup. This will give it a "meaty" feel and is high-fiber and high-protein. You may have to add more water since barely puffs up but it will be worth it. Also keep in mind that barley takes awhile to cook (45-60 minutes) so increase cook time. Can't wait to try!

This is one of my favorite soups.  I make it the crockpot.  Sometimes i will puree it to make it thick and serve it in a mug with croutons.  I have used this soup as a base to make split pea soup or beef stew.  I rated it 4 because I think the onion soup mix is too salty.  I use pink salt (Himalyan salt) to taste.

LOVE THIS SOUP!  Taste great and is very satisfying!  I like this when I'm trying to get back to a more regulated eating schedule and weight.  Substitute for at least 2 meals a day then continue eating healthy.  Also a great soup if you're ill.  Lite, but not bland.  I make as directed except for substituting 2 bags of shredded cabbage instead of cutting it up myself.  Super easy, quick to make, and freezes very well!

I just made this today and it was super easy. First off, let me tell you that you will require a 14 litre stock pot to make this amount of soup. I used what I had in my pantry. I switched stewed tomatoes for whole tomatoes and crushed tomatoes for tomato juice. I used a bag of frozen green beans instead of canned. I added 2 cans of beef consomme, 16 ounces of mushrooms, 3-4 tablespoons of minced garlic and 2 tbsp. of sea salt for all its mineral content. I did not add the onion soup mix and I am glad I didn't. I think it would have spoiled the soup for me. I can add different seaonings with each bowl of soup that I have.

This soup is amazing. I added a few more spices to it, namely garlic, chipotle powder and cumin to give it a little more flavor. There's a ton of veggies in each serving so it fills you up in a healthy way. Highly recommended.

This soup is great as written.  If you make it very basic like this, you can change the flavor of the soup from day to day by adding different seasonings.  It helps if you're like me and get tired of eating the same thing over and over.

I made this soup today and it was delicious.  The only change I made was to use ro-tel tomatoes - 2 cans because they were small cans and 1 can of diced tomatoes.  Hoping to lose weight for an added bonus.

Fixed this today and LOVE it! In fact, it was difficult to stop eating it. It may lessen the "fat burning" effect a bit, but I ate sourdough bread with it. Delicious!! Only change I made was to add 3 cloves minced garlic and some salt to add a bit more flavor. Will definitely be making this again. Oh, and it makes ALOT, so you have plenty to share with your friends and family.

I made the cabbage soup last night.  I did make some changes.  Instead of a large head of cabbage I used a small head of cabbage.  I left out the onion soup mix because I am sensitive to gluten.  I added my house seasoning which is salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  I also added some oregano and a couple of Bay leaves.  I turned out awesome and it made a huge batch.

I like this soup very much, but the reason I gave 4 stars review is because of the inclusion of the dry soup mix which I don't think is healthy.

very flavorful.  I used a pkg of shredded cabbage, 1/2 pkg  shredded carrots (to save time), whole can of beef broth, whole can of green beans, 28 oz can of whole peeled tomatoes (as that's what I had on hand) and tobasco to taste in each bowl.  I cut the recipe in 1/2 for all other ingredients - made a very generous amount of soup.  Don't know if it's good for weight loss, but it sure tastes good and is better the next day!

I love this soup and can tell a difference in how my clothes fit already. After the first batch I cut the recipe in half. I have used the low sodium V-8 juice. For those worried about the sodium amount, keep in mind the amount per serving is still not outrageous. I am a meat lover so I add 1.25 lbs. of lean ground turkey which I spice with low sodium chicken and herb seasoning. I've also added sliced chicken andouille sausage. I always add mushrooms, crushed red pepper, and in the last batch I used a can of Rotel tomatoes for the extra kick. For those who think this is bland... play with your spices. There are no calories in spices and they can be tailored to suit you and your family.

Delicious,flavorful and filling!! If not using for weight loss, this is an easy way to get those 3-5 servings of veggies a day!  I added some frozen peas (gotta love the extra protein!) and about 1 tbsp of freshly minced garlic (great for detox). Also, I used about 10 fresh green beans instead of canned. This makes the soup much fresher-tasting. For those saying it was bland, I used Campbell's tomato juice (can you say lycopene?!) and only added water  when I could see my veggies sticking out of the top while simmering. I also added turmeric (an amazing anti-inflammatory spice), black pepper (to enhance the absorption of turmeric), basil, parsley, and onion powder. Adding kale would be a great addition to the soup. I loved the deep tomato taste and the crunch of the cabbage. Thanks for the recipe! I will be making this often!

Very good soup!! My husband loved it too!!  Followed the directions except for using V-8 juice instead of tomato juice.  Since it makes such a large amount of soup and there are only the two of us left in the house, I took the advice of others and split up the soup into jars to freeze for later.  Then I took one jar and added meat, potatoes, and barley.  (tasted like beef barley soup/stew - yummy).  Then I took another jar and made taco soup with it - adding a can each of kidney beans, pinto beans,  black beans, and corn with a TBS of taco seasoning - served it with cheese and tortilla chips. Yum!! So far, this soup has been amazingly delicious no matter what!! Can't wait to see what other variations I will come up with for the other 4 jars!!  Thanks for the recipe!! Fun, delicious, and economical.

This is an amazingly filling and most delicious meal in itself!!! CAUTION: I had to transfer the full recipe into my X-Large canning pot because there was SO much! I'm grateful though, because:  a) it's scrumptious and b) I have a Food Saver and now have a bunch frozen for quick and easy week-night dinners!
I added sauteed mushrooms and spinach and it made a huge flavor difference for us without adding calories! I sauteed the mushrooms and spinach in butter, (well, technically, Smart Balance Organic) and garlic before adding into the soup. That adds just a smidgen more of the gourmet flavor for us. The only other possible alternate I would make is using the Cut Stewed Italian Tomatoes. Just a personal preference as I don't prefer whole stewed tomatoes...but that's just my preference.
I would advise if you make the entire batch, allow extra cooking time. Ours "simmered" for a few hours before the cabbage and carrots were softer to taste. But all that did was enhance the flavor! In fact, I was twice as good the next day!
Would do it again and again!! I highly recommend this recipe! Bon Apatite!

Not only did this soup turn out great, it also made enough servings for my girlfriend and me to last us for 4 days eating it for lunch and supper. This soup can also be frozen in case you wanna take a break from it. The only thing I added to the soup were some lentils to add some protein to it. I recommend this option since it keeps the soup vegetarian and adds more nutritional value to it. Definitely making this again!

I made this according to recipe and the only complaint is I needed to add salt... My Cardiologist had his assistant go online and make a copy.  If you don't like cabbage then this is NOT for you, I however, LOVE it.

I love this soup.  I first had this soup back in the mid 80's from a recipe handed out in the current diet organization class I was in.  The only difference is my old version does not include the instant onion soup mix.  First off, though, I do not consider this soup as the purpose to lose weight or inches. I do consider it  a free food addition to meals. Like lunch-soup and salad or as a side to your evening meal. You can alter the seasonings to change the taste. Like one night Italian, or more dill. Somewhere I have 6-7 flavor recipes  tucked away.  You can also add ground turkey to make it a meal. I you like cabage and if  you like vegetables, you will love this  soup!

It's great for detoxing the system.  You can and do lose weight while eating this soup if you follow the instructions for weight loss.  In my case, it helps that I lose weight but more importantly you feel good after doing this soup diet.  I do it a couple of times a year.

I rated this a 5 because I love all the veggies in it, including the cooked cabbage-that's why we all have different taste's! ;) It's a delish soup for all who aren't afraid of veggies and broth, altho I don't use the onion soup mix, (I think it's way too much sodium, and I can't have salt)  I just add onions and lots of black pepper instead! ;)
I hope everyone's enjoying this, it's been around for many year's, and will be for many more I think! :)

We made this soup today as like everyone else put on a few pounds over the Christmas holidays. The soup is ok, lacks off course the meat flavour, etc. This is by no means comfort food soup, it's definitely a diet soup. If I was to make it again, I would use half of a head of cabbage as I thought a whole head was too much. I would also omit the green beans for either chick peas, kidney beans or ground turkey. It's very tasteless as is, understandably so as again it is a diet soup.

GREAT EASY. I really like this soup, and not for the obvious reasons. It is a really good soup. If you are going
to have  a busy week and suspect you may eat badly, make this. But still eat other things. I made in slow cooker, did not measure anything, did not use beans , did spiff up with 
hot sauce and Worcestershire. Makes a lot , freezes well.

I wanted something to bring to work for lunch in the winter that was healthy - this is delicious! As written, it made a big stock pot full, which is what I wanted. I let it cool off, then put about a cup or so in small freezer ziplock bags and froze them. When I leave for work, I take a bag and let it thaw at my desk - it is pretty much thawed by lunchtime, then reheat it - YUMMY! I only made one slight change and addition: I used V-8 vegetable juice instead of tomato because I don't like straight tomato juice and I added a can of cannellini beans (low cal and good for fiber!). I add a little salt and pepper once it's reheated but that's it .

Made this last night for the boyfriend and myself, and overall it was really yummy. I made it as-is, but I found that it took a lot longer than 25 mins for the veggies to become tender. Also it makes a TON of soup and next time I'm definitely going to scale down the recipe. But overall, as I said, it was really yummy and can easily be tweaked to suit your personal preferences (ex. the bf and I enjoyed adding lime to our bowls). Hopefully, eating this in place of pizza and fast food, we will start to see some weight loss progress! :)

Don't think I'd make this again. I found it okay to taste, but there are better recipes out there and the fact that you have all these great veggies, only to dump in a processed soup mix is a put off.

This soup is amazing! I usually don't alter recipes much, but when looking through the ingredients I discovered the high sodium content with the Tomato Juice and the onion soup mix. I substituted unsalted beef stock, unsalted crushed tomatoes, and created my own "onion soup mix" out of spices. WOW! Love Love LOVE this soup

I followed the tips of others and added extra seasonings. I added chili powder, garlic salt, one Knorr beef bouillon cube, oregano, and basil. The recipe will yield a lot of soup, I split the recipe in half and cooked in two 5 qt. stockpots.  It did take quite a bit for the vegetables to become tender. I'd say like 1.5 hrs. On day two I blended enough for two bowls and heated it up and served with a few dashes of Tabasco sauce. It was delish!

We made this recipe with a few changes and found it to be tasty and effective in taking off a few pounds.  I used 1/2 head of cabbage and one pound of sauerkraut (drained, but not rinsed.)  I substituted V-8 juice for the tomato juice.  At the end we added Worchestershire sauce (to taste), salt and pepper.

I love this recipe for so many reasons. The ingredients do not have to be exact, or even the cooking times . I have thrown in fresh spinach, V8 juice, cooked ground turkey and frozen vegetables, such as green beans as I don't care for canned vegetables. The cooking times certainly depends on how thick you cut you vegetables and if there is too much cabbage for your liking simply use less. This is so healthy and so good!

This is a really delicious soup! The only thing I did differently was at the beginning I used 1 tbsp of oil and sauteed the onion with 2 cloves of minced garlic (I must have my onions sauteed)- once it cooked, I added all the other listed ingredients along with some salt, a tsp of chicken bouillon and 2 bay leaves. Also I only used 1/2 of the tomato juice and doubled the beef broth and then topped off with about 3 cups of water. When I served it, I squeezed fresh lime juice on top. My husband and (usually picky) 11 year old daughter devoured it. We have enough to last us the entire week and to kick start some healthier eating and hopefully some better fitting clothing!

A very hearty, yummy soup!  I didn't have onion soup mix so I just added Italian seasoning, garlic powder and onion powder.  I simmered for about an hour until the carrots were just slightly crunchy.

I did not like this.  It made a huge amount and I tried some that night and the next day and ended up not using the rest.

I absolutely love this soup. The only change I made was to add some Kielbasa to it. Next time I might cut the recipe in half as it makes enough to feed an army.

this was really good with some minor additions.. this is supposed to be a "diet" soup so i tried to only add things that would add very little to the calorie count.. i cut this recipe in half.. used the whole can of beef broth (low sodium, fat free) instead of adding the additional water to cover the veggies.. i used Onion Soup Mix Recipe from this site for the soup mix (with my slight alterations).. i added 1/2 tsp each of italian seasoning, celery seed, and kosher salt.. 1.5 tsp of chicken bouillon.. 2 tsp garlic powder and one bay leaf.. this was a nice start to a great soup.. ty for the recipe

I had to cook it about 30 minutes longer than specified.  It made a LOT for one person over a several day period.  

I did add some red pepper flakes to it for spice.

Took time to prep veggies, but it was so good. I made 1/3 the recipe and still went w whole packet of Lipton onion soup.  Omitted green beans. Other than that, followed recipe and am highly impressed.

I'd have given this a 4 as written, it's really good, but a little bland. After adding S&P, garlic, bay leaf, and some dried herbs, it's delicious. I'm in the south, so of course I added okra since there's alot of tomato in it. I used the low sodium V8 after reading other reviews that the tomato juice was a little overwhelming. The only thing I changed to add to the caloric content was some ground turkey for protein, making it a meal my husband will eat too. Will make this again for sure, delicious!!

Very good and makes a ton but I opted for lower sodium options wherever possible, which still make it a higher sodium meal. Delicious though!

This is a take off on a really old (20 yrs +) Weight Watchers zero cal soup recipe.  Go look it up if too much cabbage, etc. in this for you - both are good and the WW one definitely pulls off the pounds - its point is to be a snack/fill in/meal food in place of high cal meals or snacks, as many commented.  Its also high in minerals you need so you won't pass out & die while on it - LOL.

I was looki g for a tecipe similar ro my mom's, but I couldn't find one.  Then I stumbled across this. I thought I'd use it as a rough guide line. 

I had to alter the recipe a bit. I used what I had available as I live in the UK. I used 1 small cabbage (a large would have been too much), 500 ml of passata?, 400 g diced tomatoes, 3 carrots, 2 parsnips,  1 green pepper, 2 stock cubes, amd topped up with water. I threw in my fave herbs (oregano, basil, parsley,  bay leaf,thyme)  I chopped the garlic and added 1/3 onion powder. I didn't add salt as stock cubes have enough salt, but it needed ore salt. 

Second time, I did 5 stock cubes and 2 tins of tomatoes, 1 tsp onion powder, 2 bay leaves and majoram,  no parsley, 5 carrots,  and only topped up the to just go over the cabbage. The rest of the herbs stayed the same and I cut the cabbage smaller and took out the heart.  It tasted miles better this time. 

I've lost weight eating this,  only because it's filling. I don't thi k it has any fat burning properties, just wholesome soup.

This was just "OK." The cabbage soup from the 7-Day Weight Loss Diet (aka 'Wonder Soup') is much better. It has a chicken-broth base instead of beef, and I think the seasonings - garlic, basil, oregano, red pepper - make it a more flavorful soup. I'll stick with that one!

Yum! And so versatile. You can switch up some of the veggies to make it your own. I don't like green beans or green bell peppers. So I added more carrots, red bell peppers, and garlic. I would suggest making sure you buy low sodium/no sodium items. The onion soup mix, broth, and tomato juice will have enough salt even with the low sodium options.

This is a great, easy, and very satisfying soup.  I made a half batch and it is still a ton of food.  To save on a bit of the chopping, I used a bag of pre-cut cole slaw instead of the head of cabbage.  I also substituted a can of black beans (for protein) for the green beans (ick), and added some garlic, thyme, and basil.  Planning on using it for lunches and for my late night snacks.

This has always been a good soup and very good for you.  I found this over 20 years ago when it was a craze to lose weight with. It should be made exactly like the recipe. One reviewer added 2 packages of the soup mix.  That is way too much sodium and reduces the effect of the soup.  Chili flakes and hot peppers or other spices can be added, but I would not recommend adding them to the full pot of soup.  Add them to individual servings, that way everyone eating some can make their own spin on it.  It is the new year and once all this crazy food is gone, I will make it again.  Who couldn't stand to lose a few pounds, other than my grandchildren.

I never thought making vegetable soup (which is what this basically is) would be so easy! I halved the recipe, and it still made a FULL stockpot! I used the vegetables listed, and added a can of red kidney beans to add some protein. I love how low fat this is, which leaves room to add things like chicken or beans or whatever to make it a full meal. Not sure yet about the fat-burning properties, but that's just an added bonus to something so tasty! I froze the soup in single serve containers for some quick lunches/dinners for the week. I'm sure I'll be making this soup again :)

Not that this needs another review (= It got cold and rainy and I was craving soup - and this happened across my screen (= Sounded good, and healthy, so . . . (= I sorta halved it . . . I used a nearly 2 quart V8 for the tomato juice. I stirred in the packet of onion soup mix - but left out the beef broth - and a tablespoon of dehydrated garlic. I used 1 can of diced tomato [personal preference], about 2 c carrots, 1 large maui onion, all the celery, a small head of cabbage, the entire can of green beans, and 2 cans of garbanzos [I love them, and one didn't look like much in the pot with the rest of the veggies!] - I also added quite a few baby bellas that I needed to use up. I threw everything in my crockpot, set to high for 2 hours, then turned to low for about 7 more. I love being able to cook while I sleep ;) The pot was overflowing with veggies [see my first picture (=] - which I thought would cook down, so I decided to wait to add water [plus I like my soups thick!] It came out perfect!

Way too much salt with the onion soup mix. Better to use real onions and garlic as flavor enhancers.  and use salt sub instead of salt if you have salt intolerance (swelling ).

I love this soup and it's an added bonus that it is low in calories. I do make a few changes. I use spicy low sodium V-8 juice, non fat chicken broth, omit the dry onion soup (cutting down on sodium), fresh tomatoes, and fresh green beans. To add a kick I add crushed red pepper flakes. It makes a TON. I usually end up freezing some. It's great for those midnight trips to the fridge.... no guilt the next morning. I have also added skinless chicken to change it up during the week. Enjoy!!!

I added fresh herbs (parsley, rosemary, thyme, and basil), jalapeno pepper, and a couple cloves of garlic to this soup for added flavor.

This recipe is great! I love cabbage, so instead of this being a "diet" soup for me, it seemed more like a treat! And I love that you can eat as much as you want anytime you're hungry! Getting ready to drop some unwanted extra pounds!

I made this soup this morning, I have to say it is delish! I had to tweak it just a bit, cause I didn't quite have everything instead of celery I used up grilled corn and unfortunatly I did not have onion soup mix so I used Mrs. Dash. The cans of tomato had green chiles which I thought gave it just the right amount of heat. I love this soup.

Good basic recipe. I agree with one reviewer that said it had too much cabbage (and I had a very large head), so it was cut to a half head. 

It needed a little flavor enhancing so I added: 
1-1/2 tsp oregano, 1 tsp basil, 2 tsp granulated garlic (try 1 tsp first just in case you like to limit garlic), 1 tsp black pepper. I also added 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper to give it a kick. One note: be prepared for the volume of flatulence that ensues!

Wow!  This is a great recipe!!  I wasn't looking for the Cabbage soup diet, I have been looking for a cabbage soup recipe like the one my Grandma used to make and this was pretty darn close!  I LOVE that it happens to be low in calories and makes a huge pot, just like Grandma's!  I did add about 4 fresh garlic cloves(crushed), and some fresh ground pepper. (I love you Grandma, but yours was a little bland.) Oh, and like my Grandma, I added 4 red potato's cut in small pieces and let it simmer on the stove for about 4 hours.  Everyone in the family LOVED it!!!  No even knows it is supposed to be low-calorie.  Yes, I know adding those 4 small red potato's alter's the magic of the soup!  It is still good for you, and taste great!! My Grandma would have been proud of me for hand chopping all those veggies so nicely!  I think she would have loved this soup too!

Holy Smokes!  I generally am not one for soups but this one is a winner! It's satisfying, tasty, hearty and overall a great soup. My entire family loves it and there is NEVER EVER any waste or throwing away leftovesr cause IT'S GONE!  Thanks for the recipe. The oool thing about this soup you can add skinless chicken breast, cook it longer (3hrs+)for a variation!

I halved this recipe but otherwise followed it exactly. As it became ready to eat I did feel it lacked a bit of flavor so I added 1/2 tsp of cayenne. It was excellent after that. Couldnt stop sneaking sips of the broth as it cooled. I should also add that the broth, tomato juice, and canned green beans were all low sodium or no salt added which may account for lack of flavor before the cayenne.

Loved it, just the right amount of ingredients so nothing is overpowering! I blend this to even out the portions when having this! worked a treat. If anything however I was losing too much weight on this. 3-4 portions a day I was losing up to 2.5KG

Would recommend this for weight loss or if you want a flavoursome healthy soup!

I can see why its a weight loss recipe. It tastes very similar to eating salsa but with cabbage. I like cabbage but I did not like this soup. I'd rather make my own salsa and eat it everyday out of the jar as well as steam cabbage or eat it raw everyday, than to waste my time making this soup ever again! But I can see its advantage of eating it if you can stand the taste.

We did not like this soup. I have made it twice and even my husband whom loves cabbage soups hated it too bland, not enough veggies, and not much nutritinal value except the tomatoes especially if you use canned veggies. We are a family of soup lovers but overall this was just not one of our things and noone lost any weight after being forced to eat it for several days disappointed

Who doesn't love tomato based soups?  The only changes I made was to used fresh green beans (from my mom's garden), concentrated stock, a small amount of sugar, and some saurkraut (on another reviewer's advice).  Yum!  You can serve over linguine, too.

I like this recipe but it makes a lot!  Be prepared to eat this for a week.  The combination of veggies is perfect although I did add a couple zucchinis from the garden. I also used diced tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes because I didn't have it.

No problems with the recipe. Being a formulated diet recipe I don't think it should be altered much and exactly as written this soup is pretty good. However I will not be making this again...My husband and I have eaten and continue to eat all the ingredients in this recipe with no extra digestive issues, but in this soup we just can't. Not sure if that means it's doing what it's supposed to or not, and I'm not trying to be vulgar, but be advised in our cases that's a significant side effect. I'm glad to have given it a try though, thanks so much for sharing the recipe.

Giving 4 stars since I did have to add some seasoning. Instead of adding Tabasco or something like that after the fact; I added crushed red pepper, red cayenne pepper, and some garlic powder. Made it a spicy delicious soup! Very filling and you can certainly cut this in half and still have it for dinner every night  for a week. I thought it would be too much cabbage and onion, but turned out perfectly. Simmered for about 40 minutes and the vegetables were nice and tender but not mushy. I will be making this again!

I'm not a huge fan of the normal cabbage taste, so I used Napa cabbage (which has a mild, almost peppery flavor) for this recipe. I followed everything else to the letter, and it turned out great!

What caught my eye was the weight loss angle (just those few pds left over from holidays) but this soup actually tastes very good! Surprising good and I am not a cabbage or,tomato juice fan. I half recipe and froze a few bags. What was really incredible is how filling the soup is. I had a small sample bowl to check salt/spice level and I was barely ready to eat dinner a few hours later. Tis would be great on a short weight loss effort...

This was fantastic! I made just a couple of small alterations: don't care for tomatoes or celery, so I substituted some mushrooms - which were GREAT - and added some of my own spices for some flavor.  I also used a little bit of the V-8 hot&spicy vegetable juice, which added a nice "kick".
This soup worked great to drop some lbs fast! I ate it almost every day for lunch, along with a slice of margarine bread, for the 2 weeks leading up to a wedding that I was in.  And the lbs STAYED off!  It's the most effective diet I've ever tried.
Also, it freezes well.

I spray my frying pan with cooking spray and saute my celery, onion and cabbage (sometimes the carrots too) first, to get that roasted flavor a bit first.  I suppose you could also roast them in the oven on a baking sheet sprayed with cooking spray too.  It just adds a bit different flavor to the soup.  I also use V8 instead of tomato juice, and I omit the tomatoes because I do not care for them.  I also don't use the packet of onion soup mix, because there is already sodium in the V8 and the beef broth.  Using low sodium products would be much better, however the soup isn't as tasty without all the sodium so you do need to try and spice it up some with extra herbs.  But all in all, a great soup base recipe.

Very good....however,  I added 3 bay leaves a lil bit of kosher salt and 4 cut up dried chili peppers. It needed a lil kick. I suggest you get a "soup" pot because the largest pot I had was overflowing!  I also used 1/2 red cabbage 1/2 green to mix it up.

Really good without adding any additional seasonings.  I used a whole bottle of V8 and only had beefy onion soup mix which I'm glad that I used that.  Entire small head of cabbage and it wasn't too much even though I tried to cut the recipe in half.  Even my skinny husband was waiting at the stove because it smelled so good!  If I wasn't after the weight loss, I think adding some beef to this would be outstanding.  Kinda reminds me of my mom's veggie soup.

The purpose of cabbage soup is, along with being low cal, is to rid the body of retained water.  Tomato juice can have a really high sodium content so I'm using everything "Low sodium".  We just moved to FL and I'm feeling incredibly puffy...humidity maybe...so I opted out of the dry onion soup mix altogether due to the saltiness.  Hopefully after a few days of this I'll feel less puffy!

I wanted a soup for my dinners when I cook a richer meal for my family. I used fresh green beans and beef base instead of the onion soup mix and I subbed stewed tomatoes for the whole ones. I did spice my bowl some with black pepper, garlic, franks hot sauce and some mrs dash. This really filled me up and the whole giant pot was around 6 dollars to make and I will eat on it all week. Impressive.

This is very filling, tasty enough (with added spices, bay leaves, and a large jalapeno), and healthy. Totally satisfies with hardly any calories. It gets four stars for these reasons. I like to top mine with low fat Greek yogurt.

Very tasty recipe! I personally love all things vegetable so this recipe was great for me. I add extra cayenne for a little kick, plus it's got health benefits too!

It is not a bad tasting soup. Hard to eat constantly, can get bland. Maybe I just didn't have enough will power to stick to eating it for the fat burning potential

Pretty darn good vegetable soup! And soooooo easy! You can add basically any spices to it to make it to your liking. I added some Mediterranean spiced sea salt- very good.

This taste just like vegetable soup! I followed others suggestions and added more veggies like squash & zuccini. I used crushed tomatoes & diced tomatoes instead of whole ones. It is pretty salty, so anything you can get that is low sodium helps. I would also add barley or rice if you aren't worried about carbs.

Made this soup for my husband who is trying to shed a few pounds left over from the holidays  ;)  I followed the recipe as written because I was making it for the first time and was pleasantly surprised at how good it actually is!  It wasn't as bland as I thought it might be - though taste is subjective - but it would lend itself well to seasoning modifications if you feel it necessary.  I made this in a 22 qt. stockpot (before the veggies cook down they take up a lot of room) and unless you're feeding an army at one sitting, make sure you have a few freezer containers on hand because this makes a LOT of soup!

I started a diet this week and thought it would be a great idea to have a pot of this soup in the fridge.  Glad I did!  Whenever I want a little something between my scheduled meals, I warm up a bowl of this delicious soup.  As suggested by another user, I added some ground turkey for a little extra protein.  Wish me luck!

This is an awesome soup and I've made it for years.  If not losing weight, instead of beef broth, use the left over Ham or Corned Beef Broth as the base.  I always make this after I cook either of these meats.

This is great!  Did everything as written except cut the celery in half.  Left everything 'chunky' and pulled up just past the 'tendercrisp' point...still a little crunchy, though. Served to friends who loved it also.  Jury's out on the weight loss aspect, will do again and monitor over a few weeks.

This soup was pretty  good. I like cabbage, so naturally I was drawn by the name, the "fat burning" part was just a plus.  I also added a jalapeño pepper into the mix, but didn't even taste it, so next time I will add at least 2.

This recipe didn't sound so bad. I had a craving for soup, I like cabbage, and this didn't seem so time consuming. The fat-burning would just be a bonus if it worked.  Anyhow, my review: I don't care for the overpowering taste of celery! I don't like celery, although I can handle it if it's boiled to death in a soup. I guess there is just too much of it in the concoction. I have spent a good 20 minutes digging through with a spoon trying to get out the pieces. I may try to cook it again with much less celery. MAYBE 2  stalk. Or NONE! ALSO, takes WAAAAY longer than 25 minutes to get the fresh veggies done. Way longer. hours.

For what it is, it's good. I'm not going to pretend that it's not a boring thing to eat, and cannot imagine myself eating it EVERY day, but it's good once in a while when I have not been careful with my diet and want to counteract the nutritional damage that I have done. I added zucchini, used snow peas instead of the beans, didn't use the peppers.....and used veggie stock as I'm newly vegetarian. It is definitely ok.

I stumbled on this recipie while looking for healthy dinner options for my husband.  It then prompted me to go find the other details of the diet.  I made the soup on Sunday and its wonderful.  As many suggest, the key is to add whatever seasonings you like.  I used oregano, Natures Seasonings,pepper flakes, hot sauce.  I also threw in a container of mushrooms which made the soup more "meaty".  It depends on how you like your soup.  I personally recommend that this soup be made chunky as to me it made it more filling

Not bad...I needed to add crushed red pepper flakes, a little chili powder, black pepper, garlic powder and Italian seasoning to give it some depth. Not sure I could make myself eat this for days on end, but two to three days would be fine. Makes a ton- going to freeze a lot :)

This is a good BASE recipe for those willing to experiment with different veggies and herbs. I "halfed" this recipe.  I used 3 cloves of garlic (I LOVE garlic lol), 3 carrots, 1 medium onion, 1 (14.5oz) can of no salt added diced tomatoes with juice, 1 head of nappa cabbage (milder in flavor), 1 envelope of soup mix (beef), 2 cans (14.5oz each) of no salt added green beans, 1 jalepeno pepper (diced), 1 quart of low sodium V8, 1 green bell pepper, 1 box (4 cups) of no sodium beef stock, 2 cups of h2o, 2 large sprigs of fresh thyme (be sure to remove the stems after the soup cooks, the leaves will fall right off), 2 TBs of fresh chopped oregano and black pepper to taste. I first sauteed the garlic and veggies in about 1 TB of evoo and then added the remaining ingredients. I let it simmer for about 5 hours until everything was tender. This yielded 15.5 cups of soup for me. I was going to use a couple of bay leaves but I discovered I had none. Tasted great and yielded a low calorie, low sodium (~60 calories per cup and

I must say that this soup is delicious...very thick and hearty. I did not follow the recipe exactly. I halved the recipe and still got a ton of soup. I omitted the beef broth and used vegetable broth instead. I added corn, garlic, and cilantro. Although I needed to add a little more water to cut the tomato taste and ease the thickness, it is fabulous!

Memory lane - I remember my mother making this in the 70's.  I made this with some minor modifications based on available ingredients.  I used chicken broth (no onion soup mix or beef broth) and omitted green beans (instead used chopped zucchini).  I started the soup by sweating the onions, carrots and celery in a bit of olive oil with fresh garlic, and then added everything else and simmered until done.  Added some dried basil, a bit of salt and some freshly ground pepper.  This soup is a perfect antidote to holiday overeating.  I haven't made a full diet of it, but I've been having a generous bowl every day this week for lunch and it seems to be tasting better with every passing day.  Lots of vegetable servings here.

I love this recipe and use it anytime I feel I need to be a bit healthier.  I skip the green beans and the beef broth, and use 1 48-oz can of low-sodium V8 and fill the empty can with water and dump that in, too.  GREAT TIP:  Chop up a bunch of fresh cilantro and toss it in for a nice perked-up flavor, and sprinkle some on top before serving.  I also throw in the juice of half a lemon and some cayenne pepper - I've even put in some horseradish.  I've also swirled in a dollop of FF sour cream right before serving.  Yum!

You'll need a stock pot for this as I found my dutch oven wasn't going to cut it.  It was very thick and good, but does need some more spices.  I chopped everything to my liking in my food processor and then sauted all the veggies in 2 tbsp. of olive oil with two cups of sauerkraut and a tbsp. of minced garlic.  Also added a tsp. each of thyme, oregano, parsley and dill. Will make it again and double the spices and add cayenne next time.

This soup was very good but needed a little spice so I added four cloves of minced garlic and some Italian seasoning.  It turned out great but makes a huge amount.  I will half the recipe next time.  My boyfriend really liked it and we have been eating it all week.

So good! I add a little hot sauce when I heat it up. Freezes great and makes a wonderful lunch.

Good vegetable soup recipe. I added a can of chickpeas, and seasoned with garlic powder and pepper, (soup is bland without some seasonings) Next time I would omit the green pepper as it gave the soup a funny taste.

This is fantastic vegetable soup.  I was running out of room in the stock pot, so I only used about 3/4 the head of cabbage.  I also used V8 instead of tomato juice; I just thought it would have better flavor.  One thing that perplexed me, however, is that this calls for whole peeled tomatoes... WHY?  Just seems odd to have all cut up vegetables and then whole tomatoes floating around in the soup.  I will use diced next time.  But still a fabulous recipe... and the freezer is stocked with it!

I enjoyed this soup. There was a little too much cabbage for my taste, and I had to add a lot of black pepper to put some flavor in it. Otherwise, it was pretty good :)

I think this is very good for being "healthy".  The cook time is definatly not right.  It takes longer than 25 mins to simmer.  Makes a whole lot!!!!  Now, just waiting for the fat to burn off..........lol!

I halved the recipe and was glad I did; it wouldn't have fit in my pot otherwise! I had to add salt & black pepper; I left out green beans and I added some sliced jalapenos to make this more palatable to my husband. Also I used tomato paste instead of tomatoes. It tastes pretty good and is fairly easy to bring together. In total defiance of its "fat-burning" qualities I think I'll add potatoes next time because honestly, what is vegetable soup without a few potatoes? All in all though, a pretty solid recipe that I'm sure I'll use again.

This is a great basic vegetable soup recipe.  I made a few changes to enhance the flavor without it being too salty.  Browned the vegetables in a little olive oil as I added them to the pot, adding a pinch or two of salt as they browned.  This really brings out the flavor of the vegies. I don't like canned green beans so I used whole frozen instead.  I used low sodium tomatoes and broth.  Also vegetable juice instead of tomato.  Because the browning released so much flavor, I only used half of the onion soup mix.   Because I made all these changes to make it suit our tastes I rated it 4 stars.

For something that's so diet-friendly, this is pretty good and quite filling.  It makes a LOT of food though...be prepared!  I didn't have celery or onion soup mix - used a mix of beef broth and chicken broth.  Added caraway seeds, which pairs really nicely with cabbage.

I absolutely love this soup. I make it as written, adding only fresh ground pepper and some garlic powder. I use low-sodium tomato juice and broth. You do need a BIG pot. My largest pot is a 10 qt. and the soup reaches the tippy top of that. But it is delicious. My 6-year old walked in from kindergarten, got one whiff and said, "Mmmm, what's cooking?" :)

I added thyme, rosemary, savory, sage, oregano, marjoram and basil to this recipe to give it more flavor; therefore, I gave it 4 stars.  However, if I lose weight by eating it, I will update it to 5 stars.  It was very tasty with the added seasonings.

My fiance loves it!  He just ate three bowls.  I added garbanzos, chili powder, cumin, and garlic to the soup, and used veg broth (like 3x more than recipe).  DF added some sriracha (rooster) sauce for heat.  Froze a lot of single servings for lunches, and double servings for dinners.  Thanks!  Filling, cheap, and healthy!

It's a lot better than you think it's going to be from the description, but still a little bland. I made this tonight and seriously, this made too much. I know that the quantity is for the diet, but even after freezing about two thirds of the soup, I still probably have too much and it's going to go bad before my husband and I can eat it! Half this recipe as it's not that hard to make and half will probably last you a week!

My husband and I were both pleasantly surprised by this recipe - it was much better than we had expected!  I halved it and we had enough to eat on for a week.  I also cut back on the onion, used stewed tomatoes and low-sodium V8 instead of the whole-tomatoes and tomato juice, and chopped up mini sweet red/orange/yellow peppers instead of the green.  Will definitely make again!

Not bad actually.  I found it to be quite bland, and on it's on I would rate it 3 stars, but I added a load of black pepper and garlic powder to it, and that bumped it up to 4.

As is, I give this recipe a 4 star rating.  It is very flavorful and easy to make.  I love this recipe because of its versatility.  I don't make this with the "fat burning purpose", I make it because it is a great base for many variations.  Here's how I kick it up to a 5 star rating, but remember I make this soup because we like it, not to lose weight.  Because we like a thicker, heartier soup, I start by browning 1 lb of hot italian sausage in my soup pan, then proceed with the recipe as written. I add a couple cloves of pressed garlic and a can of condensed tomato soup.  Let this simmer until almost done (I use very little water-maybe 2 cups), then I add 1 lb of kielbasa (sliced).  Simmer a little longer and you have a meal.  I serve with sesame bread sticks.

I think you have to like cooked cabbage to eat this soup.  I was able to eat it for lunch for a couple of days, but on the third day when I opened the bowl the smell of the cabbage was diet plan enough.  No more.  I would rather hit the treadmill!

I made the full recipe this morning and let it simmer away. I added a half bag of spinach,5 cloves of chopped garlic, and a good splash of worchestershire sauce to the pot. After trying a  bowl I added afew dashes of my favorite hot sauce and then added abit to the large batch too.
   I didn't make it for weight loss purposes, it just sounded like a good veggie soup recipe. I will make it again  and add beans or sliced smoked sausage or both. Thanks for the recipe.

I thought this soup was fantastic. In place of the tomato juice, I used the Bloody Mary Mix recipe from this site that I'd had left over from a party and it gave it the perfect kick needed. I also added some cauliflower I had sitting in the fridge, but made no other changes. I didn't read all of the reviews so I don't know if it was mentioned, but this makes A LOT of soup. I started out with an 8 quart stockpot and ended up having to use a 12 quart and even that was cutting it *very* close. I'll have to freeze some because it's far more than I can eat in a week. I can't yet attest to its weight loss properties, but I can say this was a fabulous cold-weather meal and my husband ate two bowls (even though he said he wasn't hungry!).

Tasty and healthy. Used spicy low sodium tomato juice for half and regular tomato juice for other half.  Since the popular prepackaged dry onion soup mix which has MSG, I used a mixture of beef flavored granules, minced onion flakes, onion powder and celery salt.  You can find several alternatives on the web.

Needs tons of salt. I know you retain water with salt but in the long run it'll balance out. I also added garlic powder, pepper, and Italian seasoning.

I thought this soup as the directions are written was not good at all.  I found it odd that there was no water measurement, so maybe I put in too much water because it was very watery.  I ended up adding a whole jar of spaghetti sauce just to get it some substance, and also many many spices for a little flavor.  I added a little cayenne pepper for a little spice.  After doctoring it up a bit it was OK.  Still not as delicious as other reviewers have mentioned.  With that said, I did have a bowl for dinner last night and the night before and have lost 2 pounds.  So it may not taste great, but I guess I can deal with it for a little while in order to lose a couple pounds.

Great basic recipe; I agree with other reviewers who say that the key to enjoying this soup is to add your own nuances to it.  I substituted Asian fish sauce for the broth and cayenne and garlic for the onion soup mix, and added a bunch of different veggies:  leeks, parsnips, carrots, and okra.  This does take MUCH longer than the stated cooking time, unless you like your vegetables very crunchy.

At first glance, I had a feeling this would  be a really boring, bland soup. Surprisingly, it was great! I didn't change a thing. Not sure if it does burn fat, but if I lost a pound or two, I won't complain. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a good version of the fat burning cabbage soup. Although it is not the original recipe it is tasty. I added 3 bay leaves and thats about it. I think tomarrow I will add some green enchilada sauce and green chilies for a flavor variation.

Great, I let veggies cook in a little bit of olive oil first, that cut down on simmering time. I was generous with vinegar and pepper. My husband who HATES vegetables, actually liked it!

This was amazing. It was easy, and fast, and perfectly delicious! I altered the ingredients to my preference. I do that with every recipe. I didn't put as much cabbage and I omitted the green beans. I loved this recipe and I'm sure it will become a staple in my recipe repertoire

Very good. I took the advice of another viewer and cut back on the cabbage, otherwise it will overpower your soup and just be too much. But this is delicious. I simmered my quite a while too, like a couple of hours on lo. i like my veggies nice and tender.

My Mom loves soup and wanted me to make this for her so she could freeze it for easy use. The recipe makes A LOT of soup. I am not a "soup person" but I liked it. I didn't use bell peppers but I did cut up squash and green beans then tossed frozen peas and corn in after it was almost done. I also used V8 juice instead of tomato juice.

This is a great soup. I used more beef broth then called for. I also forgot the beans. I wish I could eat it everyday for lunch but I was starving just a couple of hours after eating it. Good for you but not filling. Thank you for the recipe!

Love - Love - Love this soup.  Makes enough for a small army but SOOO good.  I added Kale and zucchini.  Yummy! Great for a Weight Watchers friendly meal esp if you have splurged a little during the day.  Dinner is 1 point!!!!

My husband and I both agreed that this soup was tasty and hearty! I made it with V8. It makes A TON (lasted the two of us almost a week) and it's a refreshing and healthy dinner on cold Pittsburgh nights. We'll crave it again, so I'll make it again!

What a good soup. Everybody loved it and plus, it was healthy. I would recommend adding worchestire sauce, black pepper and garlic powder though. Also next time I make it I'm going to add a half head of cabbage, there seemed to be way to much.

The key to this recipe is to season the heck out of it and to use the recipe as a base, but modify it to fit your tastes. I didn't use the tomato juice, beef broth or onion soup mix. I added a few cubed potatoes, 6 chicken boullion cubes, a ton of fresh chopped cilantro, red pepper flakes (gave it lots of flavor and kick!), a packet of some Czech soup seasoning, chives, parsley and pepper. It's a filling soup but low in fat, so it serves its purpose well.
I would rate my version a "5" (without seasonings, I can't imagine how anyone could eat this every day), but that's considering what the recipe is intended for. If I rate this without considering it's a diet soup, I'd probably give it a "3".

This was easy to make. I threw everything in my crock pot, added some extra spices and let it cook all day.  My DH was sick and gulped this down.  LOVED IT. Easy to make.

This recipe was very good. I did make some changes. I used about half the celery, 1 can tomatoes, 2 onions, used spicy V-8 instead of tomato juice, added several dashes of Worcestershire,added oregano, crushed red pepper and about 1/3 cup Cholula hot sauce. It was spicy.
But, I like it that way. Eating only this for a week was a little tiresome but, I did lose weight. I will make again but, not too soon. Oh, one more thing I added instead of the green beans I used a frozen bag of green beans/edamame/mushroom mixture. Very healthy! My BF who needs to gain weight loved it too.

Made this for my husband, as he is trying to lose weight. He liked it but I think that he missed having noodles in his soup. It does make alot and the next time that I  make it, I will surely cut it in half as I had to freeze a large container for future use.

Awesome soup! I scaled it in half, except I used the full can of beef broth and the full amount of onion soup mix. I also added 4 minced garlic cloves, and a good helping of freshly ground black pepper. Outstanding! I love all of the veggies. I don't know about the whole peeled tomatoes, however. I would reccommend halving them or perhaps using stewed sliced tomatoes instead.

YUM! This is delicious, my husband raved about it also, which i was pleased about.  He said it was very hearty.  Reminds me of college when a roommate used to make it when we felt like dieting!  I had a few problems because my largest pot (which i thought was big) was not big enough for all the ingredients.  maybe the head of cabbage was too big, but i had to take some out, and couldnt fit in all the tomato juice, left out some celery.  I also forgot the onion soup...oops, but added a bunch of other spices and pepper, so all in all the result was terrific.  it makes TONS! :)  and i will for sure be making it again.

I'm not crazy about this soup, but it is a great way to sneak in the vegetables.  I did change a few things though, I didn't have enough tomato juice so I compensated with some tomato puree I concocted which I'm sure changed the flavor.  I also almost doubled the veggies to get some more in.  I cut the recipe in half and still ended up with a big pot and a half.  This isn't one of those soups you crave it's one you make yourself eat because it's so good for you, wasn't horrible, just not something I look forward to eating.  I'll make it again though, VERY healthy!

This was very good for being healthy.  I did make some additions, I put in some chili peppers to give it some heat and some okra to thicken it up.  Also I omitted the celery and replaced it with sliced zuchinni.

I'm currently trying to lose some holiday pounds and I'm trying the cabbage soup diet.  I made the soup last night and it turned out great!  I added 2 cans diced tomatoes w/ chiles and that gave it a kick!!  I also added my own herbs and spices to suit my tastes such as garlic powder, parsley and seasoned salt.  Hopefully by eating alot of the soup and watching other things I eat, this can help me lose those holiday pounds I've put on.  Good luck to me!!!

I just made a batch of this soup today.  It is great! I followed the recipe and added salt and pepper to taste.  I severd it as a meal and added pieces of  tomato basil chicken sausage.  Very yummy!  The recipe does make a lot.  Two of us ate it for dinner and I just made up 8 tupperware containers full for leftovers!  Will definately make again!

This isn't the most flavorful soup in the world, but it is low-calorie and full of vitamin C and fiber. Be careful not to water it down too much. I will make it again.

Awesome, easy to make.  I put the carrots, onions, and celery in a food processer.  It was a great filler and a easy way to get those veggies in when your watching your weight.

This a great soup it really curbs your appetite and helps with the munchies...Sometime I like to blend it and add a couple tbsp. of skim milk to make a creamy version, its nice for a change.

I love this soup!  It is very healthy, yet very filling.  You definitely want to "spruce" it up with some added flavor.  For example, I added canned corn, fresh garlic, Chile Powder, pre-seasoned can of whole tomatoes, a lot of black pepper.  It is excellent that way- I also halved the recipe at the suggestion of others.  Boy I am glad that I did it too, because half of the recipe makes one giant, giant pot of soup.  And I did not add water, yet still it was a lot!

Wow, this really does make a lot! I didn't have a really big stock pot, so I ended up using all 4 burners on my stove!! I used my food processer for the vegetables, so preparation was nothing...it wasn't as filling as I thought it would be, and it did need some seasonings! It was good, but I don't think I would ever make this again.

I wasn't very fond of this soup.  The first thing is it makes WAY too much.  I should have quartered the recipe.  The second thing is I had to cook it MUCH longer than the recipe calls for.  And lastly, the flavor wasn't that great.  I did follow the recipe exactly even though I didn't like some of the vegetables.  If I tried this again, I'd only use the vegetables I like.

THANK YOU Nell! I made this soup for the first time last night, and didn't change a thing. I was concerned it might be a little bland, but it's very flavorful, with the tomato juice/bf broth/onion soup base! This is a recipe I will be making regularly, simply because it is sooo healthful, AND tasty!

Great recipe, it does take some time to chop everything up but, well worth it. Since there is only the two of us I cut the recipe in half. It still made plenty of really yummy soup. This is a keeper and has been added to my regulars. And the funny thing is, it's good for you too.

I love this soup! I used spicy vegetable juice instead of the plain tomato juice. Might be too spicy for some, but we loved it that way. Thanks for a great healthy recipe.

Well, the other reviewers weren't kidding when they said it makes a LOT of soup.  As I was filling my largest pot I realized it wasn't going to all fit and had to run out and buy a 16 qt. stock pot!  The end result was pretty good but not outstanding.  Let's hope those pounds melt off!!

This is a very easy & tasty recipe. I'm not able to speak on it fat burning capabilities, but it a nice complement to a meal. My very picky 8 yr. son loved it. He requested it for his school snack. It's just me and my son so I cut the recipe in 1/2 and it still made plenty.

Excellent, used for sometime..
Only drawback is if one does not like cabbage.
I keep a jar in my refrigerator all of the time
and when I go hunting for food to eat, I
take a cup of this soup!

Read the article I have linked for the cabbage soup diet.  I have done this with the same results as the person in the article.  I lost about 5 lbs in a week.  Skip a week do it again.  The soup does get pretty uggggg after a few days.

Yes I made a few changes cuz I had to use what I had on hand. NOTE:  USE A VERY LARGE STOCK PAN. For ALL the tomato products that this recipe called for I used 1 can stewed tomatoes and 1 can diced tomatoes, I used a huge can of cento crushed tomatoes then I filled the cento can with water twice to make sure all the veggies were covered. I used 2 cans of drained green beans instead of one. I ADDED 2 LBS OF BROWNED GROUND VENISON AND 1 POUND OF CHOPPED TURKEY KIELBASA BOTH BROWNED & DRAINED OF ANY FAT. I ADDED A HEAPING TBLSP OF MINCED GARLIC AND A HEAPING TBLSP OF ITALIAN SEASONING AND A FLAT TBLSP OF WET RED CRUSHED PEPPER and a sprinkling of salt and black pepper. I included all the other ingredients that this recipe called for which filled my biggest stock pot to the top and I simmered it on low for probably 45 minutes to an hour. It is so YUMMY, 5 STARS, 2 THUMBS UP AND I'VE BEEN EATING THIS FOR 3 DAYS AND HAVE LOST 4 LBS. I'M SO HAPPY. IT'S ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS AND I'M LOSING WEIGHT AND HAVEN'T EXERCISED A BIT BECAUSE I'VE GOT THE FLU & PNEUMONIA RIGHT NOW SO THIS RECIPE IS WORKING GREAT FOR ME PERSONALLY TO LOSE POUNDS. BUT I DON'T EAT ANYTHING ELSE. I DO HAVE A VERY GOOD HEARTY SIZED BOWL WHEN I DO EAT THIS every day and as often as I feel hungry every day which is usually twice a day. It very filling and so tasty! Give it a try, you won't be disappointed. Delish!!!!

I have no idea how this is going to taste, I just had to split the recipe between two massive stock pots, there's enough to feed an ARMY! Do yourself a favor and at the very least halve the recipe. I'm stuck with all this soup now for one person and I have to hope it comes out after splitting it. How do you evenly split these ingredients unless you do it before hand? Fingers crossed, super ticked off. How about a warning: makes four gallons!!

This soup is delicious! We had crescent rolls with it and used the rolls to "sop" up the juice. 

The only real changes I made was instead of adding water to cover the veggies, I added more tomato juice. And I did not put the celery in it. 

This makes a huge pot of soup. However, I don't think it is going to last very long!

This makes enough for an army so be prepared or cut the recipe in half. I used spicy V8 and fresh cilantro along with some spicy Mrs. Dash and about 3 T of chopped garlic from the jar along with fresh kale to boost the nutrition and health properties. I omitted the canned green beans. I made some with ground turkey and some without, both of them are delicious! I think I may try a version with clams like a Manhattan clam chowder next time for variety.

Over the course of the last two years I was able to lose 130 pounds.  I use the cabbage soup for maintenance.  During these days leading up to Christmas with all the food-centric gatherings, I need to be careful not to throw away all my progress.  Just few days on this soup get me back on track.

Excellent recipe, tastes far better than I expected. I'll admit I was drawn to the "fat-burning" title but genuinely love the taste of this soup. I originally made this intended for myself to freeze and have as lunches but my husband and 10 year old son also really liked it - and my son has requested to have it again. I even got a bigger soup pot specifically to make it again!

It was GREAT; but, I'm going to do 1/3 of the recipe from now on.  It was way too much for one person.  It was filling though and i lost two pounds.

I make this all the time.  
However, I have meat eaters here.  So I toss in smoked turkey
Be it necks or wings.  Adds more flavor too.

This is good, but I added herbs because I always do. I  chose it because I was looking for cabbage soup. It's really vegetable soup and anyone can lose weight when eating a bunch of vegetables. and reducing fats and carbs. the cabbage probably helps "clean you out" though. While vegetables are healthy, canned veggies, tomato juice,  v8, lipton onion soup mix, etc., are chock full of sodium,   so that's not very helpful for anyone, and adding meat is not this recipe that is being reviewed. We all make it our own, but people should review the actual recipe.

First, didn't realize how much soup this made. Luckily, i always use a 16 qt pot. I'd say It filled it to the ten qt point.  Only down side is, I bought enough ingredients to double the recipe, so will be giving some vegetables away. I used spicy tomato juice and it worked out. Also added a 4 cloves of garlic. Turned out OK.

Overall pretty good. I added about a cup and a half of barley. I found using tomato juice as a base gave this soup a somewhat raw  or unfinished taste.

This has been one of our favorite soups for years. There is always a pot in our fridge during the winter! I add small chunks of very tender lean beef chunks tor ground turkey to increase the amount of protein.

I used cans of crushed tomatoes, I added corn and cooked barley along with some added water.  It turned out so yummy almost like a stew.  I LOVED it!

SO glad I found this recipe! To reiterate, if you want the added plus of weight loss, don’t change the recipe. I just wanted to try it out to see how it was, regardless of weight loss or not. It was delicious! I threw some sauerkraut and hot sauce in there cause I like some spice. I want to make the comment that this makes a GREAT deal of soup. You need at least a stock pot. I used the biggest pot I had at the time and I had to use 2. I bought a stock pot the next day. I’m actually making the recipe again today and I can’t wait! I bought freezer safe food storage containers online and always freeze most. It’s so nice to have on hand! Especially in the cold MN winter. Thanks for the recipe!!

VERY GOOD! I add my own seasoning the tomato is just a bit too powerful for me. My suggestion would be to cut ingredients in half especially the cabbage. I added salt, pepper and just a bit of Italian seasoning and this is my new favorite dish!

This recipe makes enough for a small army. The flavor needs extra seasoning.  Adding crushed red pepper, adding hot sauce, salt, and one bowl I added carbs.  After 8 meals, I froze the rest.

Very delicious soup, I followed the recipe, though I did add in a bit of pepper for some spice. It was  amazing, I thought it'd be too acidic but the beef broth and water cut down on it enough. I'm not using it for weight loss, I just wanted something healthy to fill me up, and this works perfectly. Will be making again and again.

Made with no alterations at all. Expected it to be bland vegetable soup, ended up with *tasty* vegetable soup. Will add some spices to future iterations just to see what happens, but it really isn't necessary as it's plenty flavorful as-is.

Cooking time should be adjusted closer to an hour, after 25 minutes simmering the soup was barely warm. Increased heat and waited a little longer, and lo and behold there was soup, and it was good.

Everything barely fit in the largest pot we have, luckily the cabbage cooks down a bit . Be prepared to eat soup for DAYS with this recipe! Crack open the tupperware and save for easy reheated meals.

This soup was great.  I made it using the cabbage and green peppers from our garden. I used kidney beans instead of green beans.  Would definitely make this again in the fall.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made a half batch and it still made enough to have a good size container to put in the deep freeze. It’s very good but very tomato-ey. Only changes I made was to add one can of white Northern beans and a package of cut up tofu to give me some more protein. I probably will make this again but I would use diced tomatoes instead of the whole stewed tomatoes, just my personal preference.

This can be a high sodium soup if made as is!
I used 50% Less Salt Heinz Tomato Juice less 1 cup and added an extra cup of broth. Also, used no salt added canned tomatoes and half of the onion soup mix.
Also used half can of green beans because I found a full can kind of overpowered the flavour.
This is a delicious soup and freezes well.

I used one person’s suggestion and added sauerkraut; I think this was a nice touch! I sprinkled the top of each individual bowl with creole seasoning. Overall, nice soup when you are trying to cleanse, prep for the beach bod, etc!

Thank you for this amazing recipe!  I replaced the beef broth by chicken broth, added 2 chicken breast sliced in pieces and boiled with the three chicken broth boxes prior adding the veggies. I also adde the juice of two lemons, cilantro leaves chopped, Adobo Complete spices and plenty of love!  Absolutely delicious!

I cooked just as said. I like this one better because tomato juice, onion soup mix and broth gives it a good flavor and no other seasonings necessary. I've tried other versions and they were very bland.  Difficult to eat. This one is perfect.

I have made this several times and when made as written tastes great. I am hot a green pepper or onion person but had no problem with this soup.  I did lose weight and ate a cup of soup when I had the munchies. Very satisfying.

It's super easy/can't fail. Next time I make it I will use less onion, maybe even only on, but more cabbage. Canned peeled tomatoes are more cost effective, but fresh ones will brighten the overall flavor and color.

I rate it a 5 because though it actually takes longer than 25 minutes to prepare; since it has so many ingredients, overall... This soup is DELICIOUS!!! It’s worth spreading the time to make it:

I halved the recipe and added thin sliced leeks, 1 can of organic diced tomatoes instead of tomato juice. I didn’t have bell peppers so added 1tsp. dried pepper flakes and also I like turmeric so 1 tsp. Turmeric as well. Instead of Beef broth I added 2 Tbsp concentrated beef broth (Costco). Very good soup to have in winter when veggies not as available.

It's hard to have deliciousness with these ingredients.  I wanted the soup for a diet so, knowing from past experience it's not the most tasty soup in the world, I carefully adjusted the salt and pepper, and added basil.  Basil makes many things better.  Also, I pureed the soup.  For me personally, it just goes down easier than trying to work thru those bland veggies.  I'm actually enjoying it this time.

Cut this recipe in half! I tried this in the crock pot and could barely get the lid on. I have a large portion left over and I'm going to brown some ground turkey to add some protein.

This is the first time I've had Cabbage Soup and it's delicious.  I had to make a couple of changes due to shortage of items, I only used one 48 oz can of tomato juice and added water to make up for the other one.  Also, I only had 3 stalks of celery, instead of 12.  I added a couple of tablespoons of Worcestershire Sauce and a couple of tablespoons of Cilantro, it's a keeper recipe.

I've made this a few times... a virtual vat. I have added frozen peas and green beans as well as ditalini pasta (sometimes) which makes it similar to minestrone soup. I also use V8 instead of tomato juice since the calorie/carb count is the same... and lotsa fresh ground black pepper.

With all the canned vegetables and soup mix,  I was surprised it was so delicious. I used V8 juice instead of tomato and skipped the green beans. My husband and I ate this soup for three nights in a row and actually lost weight.

This makes a huge batch. I had to get out my jumbo-sized stockpot. It's easy to make and tastes good. However, I think it needs more seasoning. I didn't use low-sodium anything, and it was still bland to me. I don't generally like things very salty either. I stirred 2 teaspoons of beef Better than Bouillon into the leftovers. I haven't sampled it yet to see if that helped.

This was delicious.  The only changes I Made was in the vegetables I used.  Carrots, celery, onions, spinach, mushrooms,green beans and of course cabbage.  The onion soup added a lot of flavor recommend adding this.  Will definitely make again.  May my thighs melt away!

Turned out great. Me and my husband have been watching our weight and sodium. I bought everything with either no salt added or low sodium. A heaping bowl full won’t add crazy calories to your day! Yummy.

I used fresh tomatoes- 'tis the season and added a dash of garlic/ onion salt and pepper to my individual bowl of soup- I wanted to let each person choose whether or not to add seasonings. Even my picky 9yo daughter loved it!

I make this in my crockpot.    This is my favorite cabbage soup recipe.   I do have to cut back on some of the vegetables simply because it just won't fit in my biggest crockpot.   But its delicious!  Because it makes so much, I put it the extra in freezer bags and heat it up on my lazy days.   Usually in a crockpot.  Excellent to do for small families or individuals.

Note to self: next time reduce 1/3 to half original recipe ingredients for a 6-quart slow cooker. Other wise it was delish regardless and I have plenty to put in the freezer in individual portions for a rainy day.

The only thing I added was a little zing: crushed red pepper, black pepper, and some Italian seasoning herbs. It was delicious. This will be an easy diet to stay on. Hope it works. As another chef commented, make sure you usebyour absolute biggest pot. I didn’t have room for one more bean in my 8 quart.

This recipe is perfect!  It’s a great way to eat more cabbage, which is a great, healthy food to consume!  I make big batches and store them in my freezer so I always have a quick option for a meal!

This is a great recipe that I had been given and lost. It was one that the hospital gave to a friend of mine. It can be a bit on the bland side, but you boost it with some great Italian seasonings or curry.

I have made this delicious soup many times and with the guidance of the 7-Day diet, I have seen results! Whether you are preparing for diet or dinner it does get a tad bland so I get creative! First off, I don’t understand why they say use canned tomatos and green beans, so I use fresh. I either chop the tomatos or use cherry tomatos. I’m not a big fan of green peppers so I use red, yellow, and orange. I switch between regular onions and green onions. I add fresh chopped garlic, fresh chopped jalapeños for some heat, fresh chopped mushrooms, fresh spinach, and fresh bean sprouts for protein. I flavor with fun things out of my spice cabinet such as Rosemary, ground chipotle chile, thyme, basil, etc... gives you a chance to switch up the flavor and keep your pallet interested. Oh! And I let it cook on low all day in the crockpot! Who doesn’t love their crockpot?!? Happy cooking!

Loved the soup! Lots of flavour. The only thing I did differently was to sautee the vegetables first in a bit of olive oil and garlic. I also cut the amount of cabbage and celery done as it seemed a bit excessive. Great way to loose a few extra pounds.

Didnt have soup mix so used 1-2 Tbsp Ranch Dressing Dry mix.  Can add about any veggies to this and it will be good.  I used low sodium store brand v8  tomato juice and a box of veggie broth.  (Could use the Spicy V8 if you want more “bite.”  You cant mess up this recipe.

Love this soup but made some  changs.  I used  oven  roasted roma tomatoes  in place of canned tomatoes.  This required more liquid than the original recipe calls for , and i used chicken broth.  Delicious!!!

This tastes really good for the calories. I added some spices I enjoy, since spices won’t effect the calories. I am going to start making it and eating it for lunch/snack.

I made this by the recipe the first time but added garlic plus for flavour. I'm in the process of making it again but with vegetable broth instead of beef. On the second day of having this for one meal I had lost 1 pound. This next batch will be every meal to see if that speeds things up. 
It is very tasty in my opinion, I actually started craving it. I gave 4 stars because of the weight loss portion. Plus the huge pot is a pain to wash (that's how much it makes) first batch took approximately 14 containers. Also took longer than 20 minutes to have tender veggies. I think all in all it took a couple of hours start to finish.

This is a tasty and filling soup!  I was cooking for the week. I browned the pot roast in stock pot before placing in the slow cooker. Then I browned chicken thighs in the same stock pot before placing in the oven to finish cooking. I started this soup in the same stock pot with all the bits from my browning. It's a good soup. Tasty and filling.

I love this soup! I don't suggest to change much, but here is what I have learned to do to make it easier. #1 cut the recipe in half, or less.
#2 use a crock pot and cook on low for 5 hours
#3 use fresh green beans, diced canned tomatoes instead of whole, and I use a whole bag of baby carrots instead of chopping, and try for low sodium everything.
#4 season with cayenne pepper. Cayenne is used in many detox diets. It has many health benefits and adds a needed kick to the soup.
#5 freeze perfect portions for quick healthy meals!

I had low expectations for this recipe but thought I’d give it a go anyway as I was looking for something easy to take to work for lunch. I did add garlic because I love garlic in everything and red pepper flakes because it was a little bland and I wanted some heat. The soup is really good and left me feeling full. I’ve only eaten two servings so I can’t speak to the weight loss claims.

This tastes so good!  My husband likes hearty soups but he helped himself to two servings of this. My mom dislikes anything with tomato base but had a bowl herself and said it was tasty. We did add a pinch of salt and used chicken broth not beef.

I made this for a family gathering along with other sides and everyone loved this soup. I followed the recipe but added a few things. It needed a little more flavor so I added lawry's seasoned salt. I also added shrimp to it after I sautéed them in butter, lemon pepper, and old bay. I added a little more old bay to the pot for a little more  flavor. It was delish and went a long way.

If it helps with diet, it's a 5 star. I just added a jalapeno for spice. It has a good flavor. I halved the recipe and had most ingredients on hand.

Superb.  Only time will tell about the fat burning claim, but an excellent soup.  Only changed using napa cabbage was still wonderful.  I was told that each bowl would add 8 minutes to my life.

I did modify slightly by adding ground turkey for a little protein and used a whole box of chicken stock as my only liquid. I skipped out on green beans and peppers and added more celery and a can of sauerkraut. This adds some sour and sweet flavour.  I got 20 cups as my end result in my slow cooker with each cup at only about 70 calories. Would make again

I made this because I seriously need to drop some pounds. I loved all the ingredients so I figured why not? I found the taste to be off. Like it had bad tomatoes in it. But I ate it. Today is my fifth day. I've lost about six pounds. But I feel horrible. I've been using a hot sauce to overcome the rotten tomato flavor. I give it four stars because it allowed me to get a head start. I'm putting a container in the freezer because if I look at another bowl right now, I just may eat my own foot...

One of my favorite recipes to date!  I love that I can have it as an in between meal snack if I have too long in between meals or as a meal.  I cook it up and freeze it in dfferent containers to have for all of my "just in case" moments for a busy life style.

Whoever can chop up all of the veggies in the 20 minute prep time deserves a gold star. I say, give yourself an hour. I followed all of the instructions as written and used two 8 quart pots to hold all of the ingredients. I plan on freezing a bunch of this in meal size portions which will be nice for lunches or quick dinners.

I’ve used this Cabbage soup in the past to jump-start my weight loss after the winter holidays. It has worked for me each and every time even though I don’t follow the actual diet that goes with it. I eat the soup, along with half of a light sandwich for lunch,and eat the soup on its own if I get hungry between meals. I add a protein like half of a broiled chicken breast, or a ground turkey patty for dinner.The soup is very delicious ,and you can add your favorite herbs to vary the taste to your liking. I like to add curry powder, Italian seasoning,and for a kick sometimes I’ll add Sriracha sauce.

My soup was very tasty, but it did give me a bit of acid tummy.
I used savoy cabbage. I would not use Savoy cabbage next time, perhaps chinese cabbage or regular cabbage. I used a good quality Passata, maybe the passata was cause, but I do like the recipe and next time I will cut back on tomatoes and change the cabbage.

Thanks Ashley for the idea to swap this up.  I made it 3 ways, asian (like PHO) it was perfect.  Then broke it apart into 2 pots in the tomato version and made Italian and Mexican.  Definitely helped make it more appealing over time.

I absolutely LOVE this soup.  I use two packages of the Onion Soup Mix, not just one.  I  eat it as a snack, i eat it as a meal.  For me, the flavors never get old. It certainly works as a "comfort" food.  I have made a batch adding sliced mushrooms, and have also added a splash of balsamic vinegar to each bowl prior to eating it.  Either way it is always wonderful.

Fairly bland. I might halve the tomato juice and make up that volume with beef or chicken broth. I would definitely add some spice for flavoring.

Easy and very effective.  Plus it tastes good.  I love it in the morning(not much liquid) topped with 2 eggs, sunny side up.  I am losing the pounds I add when noshing Christmas goodies.

Just one thing-you need a VERY big pot to make this, I used my largest and still had to split it up to 2 pots. Made it exactly, tasted very good as is, I did add some sage and thyme just to add a zing. Will definitely make again.

Well you need a very big pot.  That's a lot of stuff.   My Ukrainian wife loved it.  Minimum size of pot should be 8 quart, 10 would be perfect.  Next time I will delete the celery and beans and brown neck bones and add beets.  New version of Borsht.

The only change I made was to add a little hot sauce to my portion to give it a little kick. I didn't add to the whole pot since not everyone likes spicy food. Have made this for years and will definitely make it many more times. I don't know about the losing weight claim, but I'd take it as an extra benefit to an already great soup.

You can't do much wrong with this soup as the base. Add leftovers -- and that celery that is languishing in your refrigerator drawer. I added some Quinoa that I had left from another recipe. (It is a protein.) I wasn't so much using this as a weight loss soup, but a great dinner and lunch the next day.

It was a lot more filling than I thought it would be ...The only change I made was I used  low sodium tomato juice and no salt added whole tomatoes ,I used half red and half green cabbage and white onions. I also added cayenne pepper. When eating this soup I season with cracked black pepper . No need for salt didn't miss it. Very good soup .I have not weighed  myself as of yet ...

I didn’t have the tomato juice. I added yellow squash. I used Vegetable broth . The only seasoning I added was soul food seasoning. I also cooked it on my stovetop pressure cooker.  Other than that, I followed the recipe. It taste great.  I am excited to start the diet

I just made this and it was great! I buy the bagged chopped kale and had some left over from previous kale recipes so I added some kale to this. I also added Italian seasoning and a dash of white vinegar. Hope to lose 10-15 lbs but will be making this again whether I have any weight loss or not.

I followed the recipe exactly and used low sodium tomato juice.  That being said, this is definitely diet food.  It's like what I imagine they feed prisoners in Mexico.  It's not that tasty but it does take the weight off.   Also, this makes a huge amount.

I used this recipe years ago with good results and am preparing to try it again.  It was an easy to prepare, tasty, and satisfying soup and the results were pounds gone.  The older one gets however, the harder it is to take it off so I hope I will be able to make this claim again.

Been making this for years and it is so good! Whether you are looking to lose weight or not! Also, the recipe I was given calls for curry powder and Worchestershire sauce which together really gives this soup nice flavor. This is a wonderfully filling, low-calorie and tasty soup.

I have made this several times over the years.   I would buy a bag of coleslaw mix in the produce section where the bagged lettuce is sold.  It is already chopped and includes carrots.  Made a LOT less soup and was much quicker.  Just adjust the other ingredient quantities to account for the lesser amount of cabbage.  I like my cabbage shredded very fine in the soup.  I did lose weight following the diet.  Glad I ran across this again.

My husband and I have been using this soup off and on for weight management.  It works!  We typically lose 20 lbs each in a month on the diet.  (100% Soup day, alternating with vegetables and soup day,  fruit and soup day, lean meat and soup day, banana-dairy and soup day, and so on.  I agree with others that varying the spices is the trick to avoid boredom.  We also eliminate the green beans as we do not care for them in this soup.  Our vet told us to feed canned green beans to our dogs for weight management.  We put 1/2 - 1 can of drained and rinsed green beans in their dry kibble.  They will lose weight and they love the beans.  It also keeps their breath fresh. We give them to our dogs as a treat right out of the can after rinsing off the excess salt.  They love em and they are MUCH cheaper than dog biscuits.  Better for them too!

First this recipe is HUGE!  Cooking just for myself I'll cut it in half next time. Also I found it rather bland. It needs spices which I'll also add next time. But overall, a very easy and filling meal. So much of it I'll be eating it for a fortnight

My husband, who doesn’t even like vegetable soup, loved it. I added turmeric & black pepper, served it over a rice/quinoa blend. Once added a little shredded pork, another time some chunks of chicken. So good!

The only changes I made were to use the veggies I had in the fridge.  I used zucchini and bok choy as well as most of the veggies suggested.  The recipe was terrific, easy to eat every day or every other day.

I absolutely love this soup and stuck to the recipe for the most part.  Because I like my soups a bit thicker, I added a frozen bag of rice cauliflower,( Trader Joe's)  and substituted the green beans with fresh yellow squash.  For added beefy flavor, I used the beef & onion type of dry soup mix.  I also used the spicy V8.  I can't stop eating it!  Thanks for the intro to this great soup!!

I forgot tomato juice! I made half of the recipe (which still made 7 large servings), and I used 32 ounces of beef broth and maybe 1/2-1 cup of water and a can of rotel instead of the water & tomato juice the recipe calls for. I also added oregano, basil, thyme and garlic powder. Really tasty soup/stew! And, it’s not fat burning.... it’s 90 calories for a whole bowl of soup.

I made it and loved it!  I only made half the recipe which made a full pot. I was only cooking for myself so I froze it and would take some out to unthaw for lunch or dinner. I am definitely making it again.

This recipe has a great "base" of ingredients.    I like to tweak and use my own twist when I cook.  I started with  2 small/medium sized cabbages diced up, along with 2 yellow onions, 1 purple onion, 2 green bell peppers, and about 10 stalks of celery.  I sautéed these ingredients in a large stock pot in a little olive oil.  I added black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, celery seed, oregano, and cayenne pepper while the veggies were sautéing.  When the veggies started to soften up, I added about 1 tablespoonful of minced garlic and two 14.5 oz cans of fire roasted diced tomatoes.  After cooking this down for a few minutes, I added two 32 oz containers of Swanson Unsalted Beef Broth and two bottles of 46 oz V8 Low Sodium.  I then added sliced carrots, 1 can of reduced sodium black beans, 1 can of reduced sodium garbanzo beans, 1 package of frozen shelled edamame beans, and one  package of Lipton Beefy Onion Soup Mix.  I then added a splash of Balsamic Vinegar and liquid Zatarains  Shrimp & Crab boil for a little zing .... I'm from Louisiana and we like our food spicy!!!  After boiling the soup until the carrots softened up ... I let the soup cool down and added fresh chopped parsley and green onions.  Bon Appetit  and C'est si Bon!!!!  I hope my review helps anyone looking for a twist on this classic recipe !!!!  :-)

I love this soup when the weather is cold. I don’t really know anything about a “diet” plan that it’s for, I am just trying to keep my weight down as well as eat a lot more vegetables. I am vegan and also watching my sodium intake very closely. The only thing I changed was to use low sodium vegetable broth in place of the beef broth and spicy V-8 instead of tomato juice and omitted the onion soup mix. I have made it the way the recipe calls before and it was perfect that way, but it was absolutely fantastic even without the onion soup mix!

Couldn't give it 5 stars b/c I had to make a few changes based on ingredients.  No tomato juice, so extra cans of tomatoes. Low on veggies so I threw in some canned beans. Delicious. The onion soup mix made a big difference.

Sooooo, I made this to lose weight. I figured I would suffer through it since the reviews are positive in that respect. It's SO GOOD though! I wanted to add seasonings after so I could try some different things but it didn't need it at all. And I messed up running to the store thinking it was turned down but it was on high and boiled over. Kinda scary but still tasted great so that says something. Also, saw a lot of comments about the beans. I used French cut and think they are great!

Change I made was to saute the vegetables for couple of minutes before adding the broth to get more flavor. I did use vegetable broth. It does wonders!

We love this soup.  I've made it several times.  I add chicken to it so that the man in the house will be happy.  I also, cut the recipe by almost 1/4 since there are only three people in my house right now and we aren't good at leftovers. Enjoy!

I used frozen left over cabbage and 1/2 head of fresh  cabbage.  Also used pot liquor (frozen) from green beans, squash,  about 2 cups each, and 2 cups of chicken stock (my own stock)  I used only 1/2 the celery called for and 4 carrots chopped.  I had frozen veggies such as onion, green pepper etc that I added. The rest was some ham stock with fat removed (3 cups) and the tomato juice called for and canned tomatoes.  It made a large pot of soup to freeze and share with family and friends.  This is a good use of those left overs.

I prepare this soup on a regular basis.  I do not use this soup for weight loss, I like all the fresh vegetables.  I cut up a pound of green beans instead of using the canned product.  I freeze this soup in three cup portion containers.  When I defrost a portion I will add spices, old bay or taco seasoning or italian seasoning, no limitations with spices.  I will add cut up leftovers of chicken or steak or pork or ground beef.  I will add brown rice or whole grains and turn it into a balanced meal.  I love it!

I have made this twice. The first one with celery, which I don't care for. The second time I substituted the celery for zucchini. Much, much better. This soup really does the trick.

This is a very healthy soup and the low CAL count you can't beat. Could I eat it every meal for a couple weeks no I need more variety but I've been eating a cup to a cup and a half a day and I am seeing weight loss!

I love it . Instead of using the peppers : I used sliced mushrooms and broccoli. I added minced garlic and powdered garlic. I think it's amazing . They say it not good to change it but it tasted great adding new vegetables in the soup!

I love this recipe. I also was not making for just the low calories. So, i did add some ground beef and corn. It is so tasty. I also did add 1 more envelope of the onion soup mix as this recipe made my largest stock pot entirely full. LOVE

I made this today and just had my first bite.  I'm very surprised at how good the flavor is.  I did take other users' advice and used V8 (1 quart original and 1 quart spicy) instead of tomato juice.  I didn't need to add extra water and the flavor was pretty darn good!  I will update to see if I lost any weight in 7 days.

Super easy, fast, affordable,  delicious. I divided it into two pots due to size, and put one 1oz packet of onion soup mix in each. Very flavorful and filling. Going to be a great work week for lunches!

Make this on a regular basis now. I have a good breakfast and then eat the soup as hungry. Changes I made are the following: used a Cajun Spice mix for flavor. Fresh green beans. Added a bag of frozen spinach for iron (eating few meats while trying to lose weight). Chopped garlic. More tomatoes than called for but that's because I crave acid foods. Fresh squeezed lemon juice. A teaspoon of sugar. Okra.  I will throw in what other veggies I have on had that I think might be good. I am NOT adding any starchy vegs like corn or potatoes as to keep this as a weight loss diet. I have been on this for about 4 weeks, on the weekends I tend to go off the diet, and have lost over 18 lbs.

Enjoyed this more than i expected to ... i added very little salt, pepper & Tabasco ~ and i pureed it with a hand blender since i found the chunky veggies unappealing.  it was excellent.  no meat for my lunch serving, added 1/4 of shredded beef to my dinner serving.

No modifications required except for a bit of  salt, black pepper,  garlic powder, cayenne pepper and crushed red chillies.   Keep in mind, this is a lot of soup for one person.  Only change I'll make next time is using 1/2 the amount of ingredients.

I added meat (sausage and ground turkey) and sour kraut and brown sugar.  Couldn't fit in all the cabbage.  It made a huge batch but all got eaten.  Everyone enjoyed it.

Love this soup! I'm glad I came across the recipe, my mom used to make this when I was younger for us to enjoy.  I added lentils to my version, next time I will used diced tomatoes instead of whole peeled tomatoes.

BF was looking to drop a few pounds and find a healthy alternative to quick lunches at work since he's often busy enough that he can only find time to go through a fast food drive-thru if I haven't packed his lunch. I used Spicy V8 for the tomato juice. I added in a can of chickpeas to the recipe. I only used about 3/4 of a large head of lettuce so there was still liquid/soup in the end. The recipe had a large yield that I stored in individual freezer bags. This provided both of us with lunches for awhile. He didn't really lose weight from it since I slightly altered the recipe and we weren't just eating this for every meal. I thought it was really tasty though- adding some spices and hot sauce to my individual bowl. Overall, it was a nice alternative to unhealthy fattening foods. Be prepared to have a bathroom nearby the hour or so after you eat this. It's a "cleansing soup."

Great weight loss soup! Gets boring after the 3rd day, but all you have to do is add a different seasoning and it changes it up a little.

I made the recipe as stated.  Next time I will reduce the celery by about 1/2.  Following other reviewers suggestions, I add various spices to the portion I am heating up, for variety.  Cooked ground turkey also adds some protein, and variety to the flavor.  Very good as is, but variety is nice!  I have it for lunch only, and love having the huge batch made up, just to heat enough for my lunch.  I will definitely make this again.

This soup is great.  I might have added something to it but it has been awhile and I don't remember.  I did make a bunch though.  So much that I had to "can" in a pressure cooker so we could eat it when ever.  It turned out great that way too.  Canning it did not over cook it or change the flavor.  I just followed the directions for canning vegetable soup.  Whenever I make soup or stew I usually make extra just so I can preserve it for later.

Very dissappointed. I couldn't  find my regular recipe so tried this. Too much tomato juice and cabbage, very thick and bland tasting. Will have to "doctor" it up to make is eatable. One comment offeded some suggestions to make a different taste eash time. Will try some of those.

This soup tasted better than I expected! It tastes better than it smells. I am not a Cabbage or green pepper fan but I did like it.  Changes I made:  I used a bag of coleslaw mix shredded cabbage., I used a can of mixed vegetables instead of green beans. All the canned vegetables had low saLt  and the rest were fresh.  I would add some Mrs Dash in place of the salt.

Made recipe exactly as written. Pretty tasty. It does make  A LOT of soup. The soup is pretty thick but I like it that way. My husband says it's more like stew so i add a little water or broth to his bowl. It's only been 2 days & I only have 2 bowls a day. Just can't make myself eat it for breakfast.

I have made many a pot of soup over the years in fact it's my favorite cooking task. I made this recipe as published and I have to say It was almost not edible . I ate two servings over a period of three days and trashed the remainder. A waste of good ingredients.  Try something else this isn't worth the effort.

I added lots of my favorite herbs and lean ground turkey, 48 oz of tomato juice instead of 64 oz and turkey stock instead of beef, two large onions and some crispy kraut with half a head of purple cabbage. Good enough to eat for days!

Yum! This is going to be my go-to veggie soup from now on. I did make a few small tweaks based on others reviews and what I had on hand. I agree that if you are making it for weight loss you should probably keep the recipe as is. As for me, I halved the recipe and made it in my electric pressure cooker. I started with browning some all natural chicken breakfast sausage. I put in most of the veggies, omitting the green beans and peppers but adding frozen okra. I subbed the tomato juice for half a bottle of V8 and the beef broth for chicken. It was so flavorful! There was no need to add any other spices or salt. I decided against using the onion soup mix as I didn't want the somewhat yucky ingredients it can hide. Will definitely use the recipe as a base again, who knows what version it will be next time!

This soup was delicious!! I made a few changes. I don't love tomatoes so I opted for diced tomatoes instead of the whole. I also didn't have any tomato juice so I used 2 cans of crushed tomatoes and added some water. I seasoned it with garlic powder, Italian seasoning, a pinch of salt, and black pepper. I will assume that my creation no longer qualifies for "fat burning" since I used 1 pound of zesty hot sausage and 1 pound of Italian sausage. We enjoyed ours with a side of cornbread. Just like other users, this makes a MASSIVE amount of soup. But you'll need it since everyone in my house wanted seconds or thirds.

Tastes great and you can eat enough to get full while not going overboard on calories. I highly recommend serving with Texas Pete, it gives a nice little (or big) kick!

Took me a little longer to prepare than indicated but loved the fact that it made so much and added a little crushed red pepper to give it a little bite. ?

Very good!  Made it exactly as the recipe but next time will make it a little more spicy.   I have lost weight on this soup and also added some boiled chicken for protein. It is really good with the chicken added. My husband even says he likes it.

Sitting in the fridge definitely improved the thickness, covering the veggies with water made it a bit thinner then I'd like. (Note to self, your pan is slightly too small to do the whole recipe)

Very good soup base!! Recipe does make quite a lot of soup. Left out the green beans,not a big fan. Added navy beans and some Italian seasoning. Also used bagged, shredded coleslaw mix instead of having to chop the cabbage and carrots.

I loved this soup!  I did not deviate from the recipe.  It was easy to make and there was a lot of it.  My health-conscious daughter loved it even more than I did.  Even though the purpose of this soup is to lose weight, I would make it again even when I don't have any weight to lose. Thank you!

It was very very good.  Made it as the recipe called for except doubled fresh green beans and no green peppers.  For dinner, my huband added a bit of brown sausage and rice  to his bow. and it made a stew.   I plan on adding some spinach to mine for dinner tonight!

Added some italian herbs with a bit of cayenne pepper and used chicken stock instead of beef broth and omitted the onion soup mix altogether. 
Also added fresh cilantro  which really made the dish. And yes only used half the cabbage required and it was more than enough. Delicious and filling soup! Definitely will make it again.

This recipe is great but I only put half the amount of tomato juice and it turned out thicker and not so watery.  I also added some ground turkey breast to add some protein and blended with the taste well.  I'll definitely make this again!

I didn't have tomato juice so I used vegetable juice which has tomato, celery, and others. I also switched beef stock to chicken stock as I don't like beef. I am not sure if my version of soup melts fat or not but tasted good and filling, so I like it.

I made this soup last night. It reminds me of my Grandmother's stewed tomatoes. This is really good. The only thing I wasn't able to add to the soup was the string beans, my pot was too full after everything else. I have to get a bigger pot & make it again.

I added a few crushed red pepper flakes to have a little bit of kick.  It turned out really well and I would make it again.

Like many people here, I made it with V-8, using one bottle of high fiber V-8 and one spicy. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly, but oddly, found it rather sweet. I added lemon juice until the sweetness was gone and I was left with only yummy tomatoey spiciness. This is one of those soups that improves as the days go on.  It's hearty and really filling. Also, it took far, far longer to cook than stated. One more thing: don't even attempt to cook this unless you have a very large soup pot. I thought mine was big until I tried to cram everything in! I hardly had enough room to cover all the veggies with water.  Will make again (especially if it leads to weight loss).

This recipe was awesome...Made it for my teenage daughters meal prep that we do for her lunches as opposed to school lunches....she eats ridiculously healthy...she said and I quote "it was the bomb".  Added red and black beans recipe and for her protein, she adds either chicken or turkey before she eats.

it work while keeping you full.  I didn't like the beef broth so I changed it to chicken and left out the tomato parts. For me I could eat more of this lhus losing more pounds.
Thank you

I made this, but did make a couple modifications. For a 2 cup bowl it's 115 calories of deliciousness!  I deleted the green peppers, substituted chicken broth instead of beef, and added a little bit of each of these: salt,  cayenne pepper, tumeric, mushrooms & broccoli.

It was wicked good. Easy to make. I simmered it for 2 hours and didn't change anything. I did add basil, oregano,salt and pepper and didn't add celery. I don't like it.

I used a bag of coleslaw mix , 1 qt tomato juice, 1 pepper, 1 can tomatoes, 1 can Rotel with chiles and 1 tsp onion powder instead of onions. Spiced with cayenne for additional metabolism kick! Brought to boil and simmered for 20 mins.

The recipe doesn't call for any spices so I added salt, pepper, garlic powder and oregano.  I also added another can of diced tomatoes as I felt it would improve it.  It did.  I rarely make soup without meat but this recipe is worthy without meat.

Read all reviews and surprised no one else (who cooks for only two people) realized that  using a bag of shredded cabbage for cole slaw is easier and less wasteful if you don't have other uses for it.  I had to increase amount of seasonings but it was very good.  No one mentioned the usual "side effect" of cabbage - maybe I can find something to add to lessen the creation of the "gas effect."  I cook pinto beans and add baking soda and it makes it better. Will try

I made this soup and it was so, so. Too much tomato juice and cabbage. Also, whole peeled tomatoes? Diced would work better in my opinion.

I've made this a few times now and each time its turned out great. The first time I followed it exactly and it was very good. Other times I've added some browned hamburger, an extra pack of onion soup mix and corn and thats been good too.  I now prefer it with the browned hamburger but it could easily be browned turkey.  I've found the soup taste better the longer you let it cook. I typically don't like cabbage but I do really like this soup. Use a very large pot, it makes a lot!

I have made this many times using it along with the cabbage soup diet plan. However this is a bit "large," the original soup didn't have carrots or green beans. First, this is a BIG soup, you will need a BIG pot or two. I use a cabbage of about 950 to 1000 grams, no carrots or green beans, but use the onions and celery and on a good day a can of mushrooms. I use V8 juice (lg can) and sometimes use diced tomatoes instead of whole or a combo of the two. I don't add any beef stock but do use either Italian or herbs de province and one or 2 tbls tomato paste and the onion soup mix. I usually simmer for about 2 hours, stirring occasionally, it is good I agree..

Bet you could add zucchini for more volume as there are few calories in it, and NO fat! Have made this before too, and I did lose weight! It "found" me again, but no time like the present to  eat this again!

This soup is wonderful.  When you have been eating too much and want something that tastes clean (and will clean yourself out) this is the best.  Made a big batch in January, I froze several containers and it still tastes really good.  Top with a little bit of parmesan cheese and you are all set!

3.29.2017 - It came out fantastic - and I made it in  my electric Pressure cooker in about 30 minutes.  Then, I poured everything into my Ninja Bullet and pureed it so it became drinkable.  Great as a breakfast drink.  Also freezes well.  And DO NOT mess with the ingredients in this recipe - they work great just as written.

Thanks for the recipe. It was great and tasty. I read some of the other recommendations so I did use Low Sodium V8 and I added Kale,  a can of Pinto Beans and a can of ChickPeas.

I added 1 1/2oz of each Oregano, silk road all Purpose blend spice, parsley flakes and 3 clove of garlic. Then for protein I add ¾ cup of nine bean mix.  In addition I love tomatoes so I boil and peal an extra 3 or 4 and add them.  ( you can really taste the difference the can from the fresh. As for the bulky cabbage  just grate it then it’s not so overpowering. To date I have lost 40 lbs. p.s. I also cheat by following the 80/20 rule. Love my soup

I love cabbage and I can certainly due to lose some weight - the recipe looked so yummy so I gave it a try.  I followed the directions and ingredients exactly.  It was HORRIBLE.  I felt there was there too much cabbage but nonetheless, used what was called for.  I tried eating a couple of bowls two days apart.  I thought perhaps it needed a little time for everything to meld together and the taste would improve - but NOT.  Poured the remaining (what a waste) down the garborator and filed the recipe in my #13 Folder (garbage)

I used tomato paste instead of tomato juice and used whole stewed tomatoes with the Italian seasonings. It was delicious. However, not very filling. It's a thigh buster because it has no substance at all! Pair with some protein to make it more filling and retain it's Calorie reduced aspects

My husband and I tried this as we were easing back into a workout routine. We both enjoyed the flavor but he has IBS, and had to stop eating the soup during the first week. This will certainly loosen your bowels; however, it is filling, and does help with weight loss. 
I will try it next time with beef broth in lieu of water/most of tomato juice, and reduce the cabbage...

I happened to buy a lot of cabbage. When I got home  from store I saw this recipe pop up. I've never made this kind of soup before. I read the recipe, and the 4-5 comments that followed. I gathered that there is room to improvise a tad, and that some found it bland. 

So I pulled out my slow cooker (largest pan I could find). Shredded cabbage, celery, carrots, onions. I then added 3/4 of of box of tomato soup I found in my fridge and 1/4 jar of marinara sauce, and I topped it off with 3/4 jar of kimchi (someone recommended sauerkraut, which I didn't have).  I mixed it all, and let it cook. 
I thought the result would go into trash, but to my surprise it turned out great. So great that my husband instead of eating his dinner proceeded to eat two portions of this soup! To add little fat to the soup (since I didn't have broth), I topped it with dollop of mushed avocado! Thanks for great soup!

Delicious soup. I eat it for lunch--super easy, super healthy and super cheap. Very filling.  Last time I made it, I cooked half a batch and its still plenty of soup to last for days.
I make sure to get "no salt added" on all the tomato products.  I also added some kale, garlic, and other spices to season it. Tiny bit of salt to taste.

Its pretty darn good so I am eating alot of it.

Yummm! I used One Spicy and one Regular bottle of V8 in place of tomato juice. . Added frozen riced cauliflower, kale, and followed recipe suggestions. I also put in a can of sauerkraut instead of cabbage, grated in some garlic to taste. I used a food processor to chop veggies. This is delicious!!!

I love this soup! I make it any time I'm looking for a low calorie, filling meal. This recipe makes two large batches, so be cautious when you're cooking. I usually divide it evenly into two large stock pots. I also brown a package of extra lean ground turkey and add that in for some protein. I've also tried with garbanzo beans, which is also pretty good. For some extra flavor, I add Cajun spice, chili powder, and cayenne pepper - it really takes this dish to a whole 'nother level, but you could play with seasonings as you see fit. It's a very versatile recipe for different seasoning preferences. Happy eating (& dieting!)

I confess, I'm not following "the diet," but I just love cabbage and soups and I wanted something healthy to eat as a snack or as an appetizer/filler-upper  before meals.  This is absolutely delicious, and VERY adaptable.  Put what you want, or what you have on hand in there -- it's all good.  And as others have said, it makes a ton, so break out your biggest pot.  So glad I found this recipe!  I will be making this again and again.

I make this regularly and freeze it in single servings. I need a low carb diet and this soup meets the ticket. I do substitute colored bell peppers for the green as green bells give me a stomach ache. I lose pounds every week that I enjoy this for at least 1 meal a day. It seems that the larger the head of cabbage the more soup I end up with. It does take us longer to cook (2-3 hr) as it is such a huge pot.

I really liked this a lot ! I had to laugh though , I started it in 1 pot and decided it needed a bigger pot , then went to the crockpot. I let it cook all day and it was really good. Moral of my story make sure you use a big enough pot. I had no room for the add water part . Lol ! I will be making this again most definitely

I made only slight adjustments...I didn't use all of the tomatoe juice ...I sauteed all veggies first..also added cayeene pepper for some heat ....this is a kinda fool proof receipe...if you stick to this you can lose weight because at the end of the day its probably 50% less it more calories and fat than you would take in normally..I think I may add smoked turkey next time

Yes I made a change.  Instead of using tomato juice, I used Swansons Chicken Broth the No. 10 can.  It was delicious and the family really liked it.

Yummm! I'm putting this in the regular rotation! You definitely need a stock pot to make the full recipe. I used two regular sized 10 inch pots and the we're both over full.

Good soup but makes a ton. And I cut the recipe in half. Used V8 juice rather than tomato juice as that's what I had on hand. Also added some fresh mushrooms I wanted to use up. Incr as d the beef broth as I had a 32 oz container of it. Used very little water.

I am not much of a soup person, but this soup was fantastic! My husband did add a can of Rotel Hot diced tomatoes to the rest of the ingredients for some extra kick. It was delicious. Loved all the vegetables in there. This was a perfect recipe for our new, healthy eating habits. This makes a good size batch, so I froze some for a later date. I put this in my favorites!

I did not make this soup to lose much weight, I recently started a desk job and have found that I put on a few pounds so I thought incorporating this into my regular diet would help sustain my weight as eating out will just make me poor and eventually gain weight.  I made something like this a long time ago and said I would NEVER do it again. I kept this recipe in my favorites and decided I would try this one. This is NOT the same recipe I did years ago or my taste buds have changed. Changes I made: I used grass fed beef bone broth and I am not fond of green bell peppers so I did not use them. I like the hardiness of this soup, I made sure to cut all of my vegetables on the large side so that they would stay whole throughout the week, this worked great.  I will make this recipe more often. As many others have said this makes a lot of soup so that you can eat it as often as you want throughout your day to lose unwanted weight. I add it to my meals 2 times a day I have already lost the few pounds I put on since starting my new job. Now to find time to workout again ;-/
Hope this was a review looking at. Good Luck with your own goals.

I love this soup! The only minor adaptation I make is to add heat by using spicy V8 and a few shakes of cayenne. I also do a large chop on all the vegetables so it really eats like a meal.  Love it!

I'm not sure yet if this recipe helps you lose weight, but it's a great veggie soup recipe. I would half everything. This recipe makes entirely too much and barely fit into my largest pot. I gave it 3 stars for the proportions being off and because of lack of flavor as is. The recipe doesn't mention any seasoning and it severely needed some type of herb or spice and definitely some salt. I didn't add any seasoning or salt but maybe next time I will.

This turned out great! It's delicious and that is coming from a person that isn't usually big on tomato based anything :) I added Italian seasoning and a bay leaf.

This soup was really good and simple to make. I exchanged Spicy V-8 for the tomato juice and added cumin and some left-over ham from dinner the night before.  We'll make it again.

Absolutely delish!!  My kids and parents loved it only had a bit left over never got to the freezer.  The only substitution I did was fresh green beans instead of canned - didn't have canned - but the fresh beans were probably better and crunchier.

Making it again this weekend!!

Made this in my crockpot, cooked it for 6 hours on high and it came out great. The only thing I added was some hot sauce to add a little zip and I didn't use the green beans since I couldn't fit them in. The batch lasted me a week and a half, planning to make another batch this week. It's a great hot meal when I get home late from work and don't want to cook.

I halved the recipe except for the Onion Soup Mix and omitted the can of green beans.  It was very good!  I will make it again.

This soup is delicious! The only thing I changed was I added 2lbs of turkey meat and 1/2 green cabbage 1/2 purple cabbage. It will definitely last all week. I will make this again.:)

Cut the recipe in half and have been using it for my lunch. Pretty tasty and simple. Can't speak for the fat burning aspect, but definitely a nice soup to have around if you're attempting to watch calories. Threw in shredded zucchini, used fresh green beans, and real tomatoes.

I made this soup and it really wasn't too bad. I am not a fan of cabbage at all, but this was okay. I did add some fresh garlic cloves, parsley, tyme and other Italian herbs to help with the flavor. My husband loves it.

Overall, I thought it was very tasty, even with limited sodium.  I think all the fresh veggies makes this soup satisfying. It's easy to make and inexpensive.

Good recipe, makes a big ol' pot!! Now I did add seasoning (oregano, a whole lot of black pepper, and dried jalapeño for some kick) and used chicken broth instead of beef (it's what I had). Don't be afraid to add spices and such. It's not that the soup BURNS fat, it's that it's very low calorie no fat no carb. adding spices won't hurt anything, but if you start adding things that contain more calories (rice, noodles, etc) you'll be adding more calories.

We made a soup similar to this but added a pound of ground turkey burger for the protein. We did not like the dry French onion soup mix. It ruined it for us.

i have made this several times. i  have changed it a little each time by adding tomato paste and sauce in place of juice and even with tomato soup added and a little beef and barley for  some of the best soup i have ever  had. a great recipe to work with. i like healthy and fresh, not trying to lose weight and my family loves it.

Very tasty, made a large pot full! I used kidney beans instead of canned green beans and added cumin and cayenne - 
Just a little concerned with the high sodium content. Any suggestions?

I did cut the recipe in half because I live alone and don't have a large enough soup pot for the given recipe.  I also added some crushed red pepper flakes, salt, black pepper, and a few dashes of Italian seasoning.  I loved it!!!  I could eat this almost everyday.  I added some fresh grated Parmesan cheese on top before eating for another flavor.  It doesn't need it, but considering I was eating it for lunch and dinner three days in a row I wanted to switch it up (:  I will be making this again and again!

First time making this, and gotta say i am a fan. I think its way to much tomatoes but it works. 

I did put in a little more seasoning just to cut the tomatoes taste out.

Love this! It makes a TON so even halving the recipes gives you enough for two people for several days. I also sauteed the onion in olive oil with minced garlic before adding the rest of the ingredients. It was terrific -- would definitely do that again. I also used V8 instead of straight tomato juice for extra flavor and nutrients. It's super filling and delicious.

This is some of the best soup I have tasted for some time.  I am a soup nut.  I love eating soup, but have never tried this recipe.  I followed the recipe to the letter.  I didn't change a thing.  If it ain't broke don't fix it.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes soup.  I shared my pot of soup with my daughter and she liked it as well.  Thanks to the cook who originally shared it.

It's only the first day of eating this for breakfast and lunch. I had to split into 2 pots and use a little less cabbage but had another ouce of green beans. The best part was that I added a little of red pepper flakes. It made it delicious!

This soup is awesome. I made 2 and a half gallons of this delicious mess for under $10. We're not only gonna get thin, we're gonna get rich. heh. I do add a pound of browned extra lean ground beef to it though, makes it a little heartier.

This soup is full of natural veggie flavor! I really don't like soup at all but this... WOW. Very good. Decided this will be a good diet challenge now that the holidays are over. Give this soup a try without altering the recipe and see how you like it!

Not all my family use it as weight control soup as I do, so I cook up some flavored hamburger that they can add to their bowl. This time I made a taco flavored hamburger.

This was amazing. Family and friends loved it. I still have some in my freezer. I don't like green beans in a soup so I put squash and zucchini. I let it cook for three hours and everyone said that the vegetables were cooked perfectly but the broth was wonderful all on it's own.

This made so much soup I had to divide it between 2 large pots. I cut all the ingredients into a large salad bowl, divided between 2 pots, divided all wet ingredients evenly. I made it work. It needs some spice, so I add hot sauce to each bowl, rather than cooking it into the whole recipe. I stick blended and froze the leftovers into large 1 serving containers. Very filling, not a bad quick breakfast or lunch.

I made a double batch, and it barely fit into the large pot!  I plan to freeze some for future use....I'll update on how it defrosts....

This soup tastes good, has good texture, and I like that you just throw everything in and simmer it!  Very easy to make.  Very tasty!  I will make it again.

This makes a ridiculous amount of soup.  I should have realized it when reading the recipe.  You will need a gigantic stock pot.  Soup is not really that great and the effort of freezing/storing the HUGE amount of leftovers is not worth it at all.

Delicious! I only had one alteration for flavor: red curry paste. It doesn't add much in the way of calories (27 calories in the 1 tablespoon that I used) but it adds a wonderful kick for flavor.

Made it twice now...  second time was half-sized and modified...

Full recipe too much for one person that dislikes eating the same thing over and over...

second time, half-sized recipe, added a smoked pork hock and a generous tablespoon of minced garlic.  Much more satisfying for perhaps an additional 40-50 calories per serving.  Still not likely to finish the whole pot in one string of meals, but not as likely to toss out of freezer to make room for something else...

I liked this recipe and lost a pound eating it for dinner for 5 days. I sauted the onions and celery, used chicken broth instead of beef and added garlic powder and a little apple cider vinegar to give it a little kick.

I stayed fairly true to the recipe and it got rave reviews from family. A minor change is that I used 2 large cans of tomato juice rather than just 2 quarts and then used beef bouillon  rather than a can of beef broth.

As others did,  I embellished this recipe with more veggies and some herbs.  Did not add worchestershire (too strong) but did increase the onion soup by 1/2 pkg  plus some drops of hot sauce for zing.  Mushrooms, bok choy stalk, and yellow zucchini are the perfect addition.  One half of this recipe is plenty as you can make another half-batch after 4 days.  Shredded cabbage from a bag simplified the chopping process. I also simmered this soup 2 1/2 hours as the carrots need more time.  Beware some individuals get extreme gas so have the beano on hand!!!!  Lost 10 lbs in 11 days.

Bland it is and the texture was bad.  Maybe I overcooked it.  I love vegetables but had to toss this stew the day after making it.  If people are losing weight on this dish, it is because they are not eating it.  Also, lacking in protein as it is, it did nothing to assuage the appetite.  I made a slow cooker black- eyed beans stew the following day which will hopefully produce weight-loss and definitely takes care of the protein issue.

LOVED THIS SOUP!  I did change it up a bit.  I felt one whole head of cabbage was a bit much and since I had a half head of red cabbage  I used that and took the suggestion of another reviewer and added a 16 oz. jar of sauerkraut.  Worked great!  In place of whole tomatoes, used two 15 oz. cans of spiced diced tomatoes  for added flavor.  We had some vacuum sealed turkey from a recent dinner  and I chopped up  about a pound and added it to the pot. I also added three cups of water so I would have plenty of juice.   It took me a whole lot more than twenty minutes to chop all of this up but it was well worth it.  I cooked it for a little over thirty-five minutes.  The veggies were sill crunchy but that did not bother me.  I would much rather have them crunchy than soft.  I have a bowl every noon.

I did make one slight change, I used vegetable juice instead of tomato and loved it. I've had cabbage soup in the past, but not with juice, onion soup mix and beef broth.

I made the recipe as directed and it was quite good for a vegetable soup.

The one change I would recommend is to chop or quarter the canned whole tomatoes. The tomatoes do not break up in cooking, so you have these huge tomatoes served in your soup.

This soup was Delicious. The only change I made was that since I didn't have tomato juice on hand I used V8 juice. Oh I also cut the recipe in half because I was the only eating it. Hubby doesn't lie soup

I made it just like the recipe said and it made A LOT...Had to make it my 15 quart stockpot.  It cooked fairly quickly and I had the soup for days.  I actually lost 5 pounds in one night, but not sure if that was due to the soup or the effects of the soup :)  Next time I make it, I will add more spices and possibly what others have stated about adding chick peas for protein.  I will definitely make again

Cold n Flu tweak:  Instead of topping off with water I used chicken stock.  Also added a random can of corn and 49 egg noodles left in a bag.  Old bay to taste then topped with a fiesta blend of shredded cheese and oyster crackers.  Texas Pete, anyone?  Just in time for flu season. Will unclog your sinuses.

I added some lowfat milk when reheating individual servings and that improved the overall taste dramatically as it was quite a bit more tart than we're used to in a soup. I would've used cream if it weren't for the resulting jump in calories which would've defeated the purpose of the recipe.

Quick, simple and very tasty. Living in Spain, some of the ingredients were hard to source - but I did find a Knorr dried Cebolla (onion) soup packet, and used that. There was no tomato juice in my local store, so I used a coupe of tins of trittorado tomatoes - which is basically pulped tomatoes. Then I put in a glass or two of red wine (remember, I live in Spain!) Also, just because I really like it, I added a little oregano - well, a lot of oregano! I will definitely make this again.

I added one more envelope of onion soup mix and a little soy sauce. It made so much that I divided it up and added 1 lb. of hamburger and some potatoes to send home to my granddaughters house and they loved it.

Not bad at all. I like it. I normally make weight watcher garden vegetable soup and I'm getting a little tired of it. This has more of a zing to it. So easy too, (except for the chopping). I did use canned green beans, will use fresh next time. Also, used a can of diced petite tomatoes instead of whole. Only made half the recipe and that is quite a lot, I even froze some containers.

This recipe made a huge amount of soup! I'll have enough to last through 'til spring. Very very tomato-y...you kind of lose the cabbage. It could use something...Worcestershire? Maybe a splash of hot sauce which I'll try since I have so much of it.

Yes I will make it again. I didn't have any tomato juice on hand so I used a can of crushed tomatoes and a can of water.  It was way too thick and tomatoey. I will stick to the recipie next time. I also halfed it as it looked like way too much and there was still lots.

It was excellent! I doubt its fat-burning properties but it is a nice, satisfying soup that may help avoid too much over-indulgence during the busy holidays .

So delicious! My only change was using a vegetable stock instead of beef broth to keep it vegan.

Makes a lot!!! Barely enough to fit in my crockpot. I made it in crockpot on high for 7 hours. Wasn't enough room for any beef broth or water but it was still very good.  Next time I make it, I will cut recipe in half

Way too much tomato juice.  I ended up transferring to a huge pot so I ould add chicken broth.  Also very bland after you get over the tomato juice flavor.  Added bullion cube, Tabasco, garlic powder.

Made this years ago! Since we had a garden, we used fresh green beans, tomatoes, some garlic and skipped the onion soup mix. Using low sodium beef or veg stock helps with the salt content. It's good as a hot soup, but we also ran batches of it through the blender and drank it with meals or as a snack.  Better than any store-bought veg drink.

Love the smell! It may be a little early for this review, the Soup is still cooking, lol.  Had to omit Green Beans, didn't have any, hope that doesn't effect the fat-burning properties any.  Used Chicken Broth, instead of the Beef Broth called for in the Recipe
as well. All I can say, it smells delicious already, can't wait to taste it! Thank you for caring and sharing!

I'm not sure what i expected for flavor from a recipe with the term "fat burning in it" The flavor was practically non-existent, there was WAY too much cabbage, and the tomato juice was over powering!  I actually looked at my recipe when I finished to make sure I read 2 one quart containers correctly, I went over the recipe and I didn't miss anything....I couldn't believe all the great reviews for this soup.  I give it 2 stars because it is edible, and it is somewhat filling for not having any meat in it.  I don't need to lose weight really, I just like cabbage a lot and it's good soup weather.  Don't think I'll be making this again.

The only thing I left out was the can of green beans. I followed the recipe as written and it tasted very much like the cabbage soup my mom used to make. Next time I make it will be when I need to cook for the entire family. This recipe is a keeper especially for cold winter days.

Every once in awhile my husband and I need to "cleanse" so I make this soup. But hubby loves potatoes, so i have to add a few and after we've eaten it several days, I add low fat Italian sausage or lean ground beef. It's delicious whether trying to lose weight or get warm after a cold day outside. Also, to add more flavor, we add garlic and Frank's to spice it up a bit.

I made this about a year ago and it was as great.  I made it to lose weight but that didn't happen.  Likely because I are other foods that weren't good for me.  Still, it was delicious and so will make it again and again.  Last spring, I changed my lifestyle  diet and melted off 40 lbs.  This is part of my normal Fall/Winter rotation!  Everything in this recipe is how I now eat.  Eat with a leafy green salad and crusty bread.

I loved this soup.  It makes alot more than I thought it would.  Definatly going to make it again.  My boyfriend liked it but said it would be better with some meat in it.  Next time I make a batch I'll split it after and put meat in his half.  This is a soup I could eat all the time..

This is an OLDIE but goodie.  I believe we used to call it the "Dolly Parton" soup, not quite sure why but maybe it was from the time that she lost all that weight.  By the way, it is good and it does help one lose weight.

i always add 2 links of smoked sausage cut into rounds.  so what if it's not "fat-burning," it's delish with the meat added, and it's a huge pot o' soup.

This was very filling. I think I would reduce the cabbage by 50% the next time I make it. I also would not add the whole tomatoes since the base is tomato based. I would consider adding other vegetables instead

Changes I made: used fresh green beans instead of canned, used chicken broth instead of beef, added a few dashes of Tapatio, added lime juice, and used diced tomatoes instead of whole. 

I also simmer the celery, cabbage, green beans, and carrots in the tomato juice and broth for 15 minutes first before adding everything else. Then, I simmer everything for about 45 minutes. 

Great for using up leftover veggies as well as meal prepping. Can be frozen and heated up to eat for later.

I added red pepper flakes and I used basil tomatoes. Love it.  We make it often and eat it for lunch even if we are not strictly on a diet.

I used what I had on hand: half of  a cabbage, three carrots,  two stalks of celery, an onion and a half, homemade chicken and veggie broth, salt, pepper,  cayenne pepper and Italian spices.  I added lentil pasta to it at the end. I used marinara sauce in place of tomato juice.

I made this on a Sunday afternoon and I only made one alteration and added ground turkey - AMAZING flavor!  3 containers have gone into the freezer and the large container I served for dinner is already gone.  Highly recommend this recipe and ease of preparation and cook time.

Pretty good. Haven't been eating it ritually but I'm sure seeing the calories that it does help you lose weight. Only downside is the gas from the cabbage haha.

My husband and I Ioved this soup. I made the recipe exactly as is. Tried and TRUE! I lost 2.5 lbs. in just over a week. That is without doing any exercise because I have a leg injury and can't run for a while. I know I would've lost more weight if I just ate this soup 3x a day. Some reviews indicated it was bland, but you can add some different spices without adding that many calories. In my personal bowl of soup - I did add a few drops of Cholula Chipotle hot sauce to give it some heat and it gave it a wonderful smokey spicy flavor. It's Awesome and we will be having this again. BTW- it makes a ton of soup so break out your largest soup pot!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe Nell Marsh!

Easy to make cabbage soup. This was just the soup I needed to help me kick start my diet. I love spicy dishes so I added a few crushed red pepper flakes to my bowl of soup. Very yummy!

I made two changes 1 I used 1 11oz can of Jalapeno Corn drained instead of the green beans. The second is 1 16oz jar of chopped Kim Chi adds just enough heat and a powerful probiotic to the soup as well. Makes all I need for a week to eat and I have noticed the pant size getting smaller for sure on this soup for 3 weeks now.

Was worried that it would get boring eating this, but it's mix of flavors are so delicious and it goes great with some lemon sprinkled in. I made half the recipe and that was just enough. Definitely going to keep this soup in my records!

Great stuff! The only thing I really changed was that I added a little shaved turnips as well as kale and spinach. I also added a dash of cayenne but just in my bowl as an experiment. It was delicious! 

The flavor is so much better than I could have ever hoped for. 5 out of 5 stars from me.

I could tell it would be too heavy on the tomato flavor, and it was. I added garam masala, a sprig of thyme, cinnamon, and some pepper, which helped complicate the flavor. I'm going to play with the leftovers, looking at shriracha, sour cream or lemon and parmesan.

I don't even remember why I googled this soup, but this was the first recipe in the search. Actually, I saw a colleague eating soup for breakfast which I assumed was part of her countdown to wedding eating plan. After seeing the simple the ingredients and the reviews, I had to try it. CAVEAT: I typically try to make recipes as written the first time, unless there are things in the review that are noticed by lots of people or that I know I can't/won't/don't eat or use. For example, I used about 2 handfuls of minced dried onions as I don't care for the texture or taste of raw/cooked onion. Per reviews, I also cut my cabbage in half.  I used my 7.5qt LeCreuset and there's no way it would have held a whole one. I swapped tomato juice for the V8 based on reviews, and I used a carton and a half of beef broth. Everything else I eyeballed: baby carrots, fresh green beans, celery. I don't like huge tomato chunks, so instead of the whole ones, I added 1 can of diced tomatoes with green chiles, and a bag of frozen butternut squash (fridge cleaning). I also added one can of chickpeas for the protein.  Smart move that kicked up the heartiness and the feeling of being full. I just let it simmer for 1.5-2 hours. I used the tenderness of the carrots as a test of doneness. It's pretty tasty! Not too tomatoey.  It would definitely take willpower to eat this multiple times a day, so I recommend pairing it with meat some days or changing the spices to psych yourself into it. Then again, plenty o

Either use tomato juice and add hot sauce and pepper or spicy V8,  diced tomatoes, add mushrooms, don't overcook -cook to al dente or it will get too mushy/gross in a few days.  Purée 4 cups of soup and pour back in to thicken up a bit.

Very easy to make, as long as you know how to cut vegetables.  Cooks very quickly too... I thought it would need to simmer for a while but 25 minutes was perfect.  Great taste for such a healthy dish.  Didn't need to add salt or pepper, was perfect just as it stood  Will definitely make this again!!

Very filling soup, we add garlic cloves and omit tomatoes totally, because of acid on it. I also added better than boullion for flavor. We do process it on blender until creamy. Two or three days a week, every two hours for better results.

I really like this soup! Instead of canned beans (ew), I added zucchini and kale. I also used hot and spicy tomato juice and added italian spices and red pepper flakes. I thought there was too much liquid, and way too many tomatoes, so the second time I made this I omitted both cans of tomatoes. SO good!

This soup was pretty easy to make. I made as directed except for only using one onion (because I thought I had more but I only had one) adding some green onion to compensate for using only one onion, using petite diced tomatoes instead of whole ones, and adding some spice (garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne, celery salt, parsley, bay leaf, and oregano). I thought it tasted okay. I'm not a big soup eater though, so okay is pretty good praise from me. :)  As for the weight loss, I just ate my first bowl tonight so I can't say if it works. I will say that the one bowl was pretty filling, despite being nothing but veggies, so I can see how this would help people who try to lose weight.

This recipe certainly is healthy.  It was hard to rate b/c it delivers what it promises on nutrition but is pretty "ok" on flavor.  I took the advice of another cook and only used 1/2 a head of cabbage.  I think it was a good suggestion.  The ratio seemed better.

A good cabbage soup recipe, pretty typical of others out there. My only complaint is the amount of cabbage to be used; "one large head" is not very helpful, a weight would be more useful as a starting point for the recipe.

This soup is definitely low calorie and veggie packed, but I found it a little bland. I added some garlic powder, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper to my first batch. The serving are very hearty (about 3 scoops from a ladle) and only 83 calories. I make a big pot and eat it for lunch throughout the week or as an easy dinner. With a piece bread or some rice added, it is still very low calorie. I will definitely be making it again.

Love, Love, Love! I just made a few small changes. I used 2 cans of  Italian stewed tomatoes instead of the whole tomatoes. I only had 7 stalkers of celery. This soup doesn't even need salt or pepper.  I put it in quart bags and it made 6 full bags. 1 is perfect for 2 servings.

I didn't use the green beans but did a full container of mushrooms and instead of using the onion soup mix I used a Cabbage Soup Diet Seasoning Mix referred to me off of Catherine's Cabbage Soup website.  It was really good and even my cabbage hating husband liked it!!

This is great, so tomato-y!  Used fresh green beans, of course.  Made a half batch and filled my stock pot to the brim, make sure you have enough space.
Simmer for about an hour, and I recommend food-processing a couple cups to make a little creamer.  I also added half a large potato, cooked and whisked separately, to add to the creaminess.  
Very delicious, honestly looking forward to eating more of it!

Just realized I've been using tomato sauce instead of tomato juice, oops!  Still super delicious, but now I understand why mine is so tomato-y.

This makes a l o t of soup.  I mean a lot!  Did not make any changes to the recipe except adding some salt and pepper.  The first meal of it we had was good but for some reason it did not look very attractive.  Just a bunch of veggies - duh it is vegetable soup. So I ran the remainder of the soup through the binder and guess what?  It became tomato vegetable soup.  It was g r e a t!  Next time I make this recipe I'll just purée it from the start.  Thanks for the recipe.

I will be making this soup on a regular basis now! Both my husband & i love this just as it's written-except i leave out the onions because, heartburn, but that's it.
I prefer to use Campbells tomato juice in the 2 quart bottle rather than V8, and made sure to not cook everything for too terribly long.
I imagine you could add all kinds of different ingredients to this recipe, though it may not have the same fat burning capabilities if you mess with it too much. As is, we did both notice a slight difference in our body fat content, (visually,)  and we'd only been eating it for four days. So i imagine it you ate this regularly, it certainly would help-& it definitely won't hurt! A keeper.

TURTLE BAY   I used fresh thin green beans, and in place of the tomato juice, I used low sodium vegetable juice.  I also added garlic powder and fresh ground pepper.  it is one of the best soups ever and I could eat it forever. I also halved the recipe and added a 1 lb. bag of baby carrots.  Even with halving the recipe, it takes up an 8-quart pot. Do not cut the vegetables too small or they will get lost in the process.  It is a delicious recipe and you certainly get your fair share of vegetables.

What a soup! Tasty, delicious, and filling. Not only easy on the thighs, but it brought my A1C down to manageable levels. Not many carbs in vegetables.
Try it!

This soup tasted great!! I have made it using tomato juice and I have made it using V-8 juice.  Either way, it is tasty, however I'll stick with the plain tomato juice so not to alter the recipe. I know that this is suppose to be a 'fat burning' soup, but I just had to have a slice of rye bread and butter with it!! 

Enjoy this great recipe!

This soup is good but not great. I changed things up a bit and found it was a little too "tomatoey". I used one 28 oz can of organic crushed tomatoes, 6 cartons of beef broth, one can of water, half can organic tomato sauce, used green pepper instead of green beans, and added garlic powder, oregano, red pepper flakes, and italian seasoning. Let it simmer for a few hours and it made a lot. I have a hard time committing to things but so I don't think I've lost weight in my first week, but I plan to make it again with new seasonings and stick to it.

I have made this or a like type soup for many years. I would not change anything except when this gets (as some say) boring. Then just adjust the ingredients perhaps V 8 juice for the  water or as one reader said add a little spice. I sometime leave out the Bell Pepper and do not change the fat content at all with any of my changes. This is good for a one or two day fast type diet; But, is not a weight loss  miracle  plan all by itself. But it sure helps.

I make this soup regularly and I regularly shake up the ingredients.
I have never used the onion soup mix as it is too salty for me. I sometimes put in a jar of  salsa which changes it completely.  Or I may use just chicken broth  with out any tomato based products.  Or I use 2-3 tablespoons of  tomato paste instead of the tomato juice.  I nearly always use  the full head of cabbage because I like the consistency of  a full bodied soup  and I put about 3/4 of it in containers in my freezer.  Defrosting is a breeze in the microwave. I call this  my 'Make it Your Way' soup!

I had used it as a diet plan when it was a fad and liked the soup very much but could not abide the  onion soup mix and chose to omit it, putting in a bit of soy sauce instead. This time I also used a tablespoon of a spice called Sunny Paris which has shallots, chives, tarragon, chervil, bay leaves and dill weed. Just as a nice light but nutritious soup, it is good. Thanks for listing the recipe which I had lost.

Definitely will be halving this recipe next time!!! I ended up putting it in the crockpot because that was the biggest pot I had!! Added some salt and pepper, but other than that, no changes. Used V8 in place of tomato juice

I really like this soup. I made this soup exactly as the recipe said and ended up adding probably 2 tbsp of salt and 1 of pepper, other than that it's perfect. If I feel like it, I add a little sriracha or ground chilli flake to my bowl. Thank You!

Very filling soup and tasty. I used fresh green beans and V8. Also used red peppers instead of green. Healthier and I like the flavor. Added a jalapeno to give it a little more zip.

When I tasted it I thought it didn't have much flavor other than a very strong tomato flavor.  If I make it again I would add some seasonings.  On a positive note, it did make a HUGE amount and it is healthy and very low calorie.

Look I like tomatoes but this was way to much. I think It was the tomato juice. Very bland as well and I don't get the green beans. You can throw a great vegetable soup together by starting with the basics ( onion, carrots, celery and bell pepper) and walking the vegetable isle to see what looks good and throw it in the pot with broth and a little healthy fat, you choose, I use butter or olive oil. to guild the lily. You can even throw a can of beans in for protein. You will lose weight. The key is the cabbage. No matter what you put in your soup make sure it has that head of cabbage.

I made this soup years ago. It is a vegetable soup, that is used as a filler. It's part of a diet that a hospital gives to very overweight people ,before surgery.  The cabbage soup diet.

I made several changes by adding various spices and this last time a couple tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce. There are so many ways to make this your own, but the basic recipe is great as is. One word of warning - if you follow the recipe, make sure you have a REALLY BIG pot.  I intend to make this about once a week.

I substituted Bloody Mary Mix for the tomato juice and omitted the dry onion soup, only because I did not have enough tomato juice on hand. It was my husband's request that I make the soup and he approved of the finished product.

I used V8 original tomato juice.   One 28 oz can of Hunts 100% natural crushed can of tomatoes. Two 14.5 oz cans Hunts Petite Diced Tomatoes (Green Pepper Celery and Onion flavored), Instead of green peppers, I used mini sweet peppers in an assortment of yellow, red, and orange (approx 10 mini's)
I used fresh ground pepper (60 twists with the pepper mill) and salt to taste . Instead of one head of cabbage, I used one bag of Dole Classic Coleslaw.

First time I made per recipe- loved it but a little too salty.  So, next time I omitted onion soup mix- then thought I have the trinity of southern cooking (sauteed onion, peppers and celery) so I added Tony Chauceries seasoning- yup, southern flavored soup.  The next time I thought maybe somewhat Mexican so I started as usual and added 6 bay leaves, menudo seasoning, or add oregano, cumin, pepper flakes and then served over tortilla chips with some cheese on top.   Wow- so a great soup base that can be varied many ways.  And no canned green beans, but fresh green beans or cauliflower or broccoli- whatever I have fresh.  Very healthy too!

Delicious soup.  I did cut the cabbage back some as it was a bit too much for me. Not sure I will lose weight but it was very good.

Made this soup many many times.   I turn it into a  main meal dish (adding protein) and add veal balls (about 2  lbs).   Ground veal, garlic, salt and pepper.  Microwave the veal balls about 3 minutes, the add them to the soup.  For those who like their soup spicy I have hot sauce on the table when serving

Goodness this makes a ton of soup.  I ate it all week and I have a huge amount in the freezer.  Its good though - used V8 for the base, frozen green beans, red bell pepper instead of green and a chopped zucchini in place of the celery (I don't groove on celery).  Its very healthy and you can really eat a lot of it without ingesting a lot of calories.  If you eat it for lunch and dinner though, you're gonna get really sick of it.  Not  sure when I'll thaw out the freezer soup.

Really good!  I added some sauerkraut as another reviewer suggested and it added a nice kick!  I had to add a few slices of ham for hubby, but it was only 60 calories for the ham so it wasn't too bad calorie wise.

I followed the recipe exactly and honestly didn't have high hopes as far as the flavour of the soup was concerned as I was only making this for the healthy aspect, not the taste...but this turned out to be delicious!!!  My wife and I love this soup and can't wait to make it again!

After reading the reviews, I cut the amounts in half. It still made a large stock pot full. It's a bit on the bland side so, I think I would add some jarred beef base next time for more flavor. I also believe  you could add any vegetable combination and still be in a diet range. There is minimal fat in vegetables. I felt like my family were getting all their vegetables for the day in one place.

This is a very good soup and I made it exactly as instructed with the addition of a dash of garlic. I eat it at least once a day for a meal substitution. If I'm hungry before bedtime I will eat another bowl so the hunger pains won't keep me awake. It is a great addition of fiber to the diet and I. hope it aids in my weight loss.

Had to cut down on the vegetables because my stock pot was not big enough.  It is very thick and filling AND my son who does not like tomatoes or vegetables quite liked it and I loved it.  Will definitely make it again and again....

I made a soup like this in  the 80's.   Daughter called and said she made it while her husbands was away for a week.  I got a craving for it!  I made  a full batch.  Froze  a good portion.  I like it when  the veggies are just half cooked.  I will take a bowl to work every day and have some in the evening too.  
( but I will need to get some Rolaid's).  I love cabbage, but it does not like me.  Do you think some vinegar would help? What do others do if they have this problem?

I have to admit, I did not have high hopes for this recipie. I made it strictly out of needing a healthier option for lunch to help lose some weight. I made it and as os the recipie tasted great! I made a few changes the second time and it came out even better. I substituted 3 cans of Rotel for the whole tomatoes, added some lemon pepper and cilantro and used fresh green beans instead of canned and it was perfect! I just had to cook it a little longer to make sure the green beans were completely cooked though. Great recipie!

My family and i loved this, super easy and filling. I used 2 onions, diced tomatoes in place of the whole, 3/4 head of cabbage, beefy onion soup mix, frozen green beans in place of canned,  V8 in place of the tomato juice,and only 5 stalks of celery.  This filled my pan all the way to the top.

So delicious!  I thought I was making it for myself to aid in my weight-loss regimen, but my entire family loves it too!  I can't keep enough of this soup in the house.  Who thought?  Healthy and tasty at the same time.  That  is definitely a "twofer".

This is light and healthy. It just needed something to punch up the flavors a bit. I added red pepper flakes(1 tsp for a 3rd of the recipe) and a pinch of salt. Since this soup was intended to help with weight loss I'm sure the omission of sodium was intentional as it makes you retain water but I thought the flavor called for it. It would still be good with just the red pepper though. I also didn't have tomato juice and used mashed tomatoes and water. I increased the beef broth slightly and simmered for much longer than the recipe suggests. Be aware if you're cooking for one that this recipe yields a large amount of soup. I would make this again it's a refreshingly light dish.

Okay so I made the soup and the tomato in it is EXTREMELY overpowering, and I could not eat it at all. It also made a big batch so I will remake the soup and omit the canned tomatoes, and add a smaller amount of tomato juice to it, and add in some spinach, I will stay updated as to how it works out

I did not make major adjustments in order to test the fat burning capability of the recipe.  I did add kidney beans for protein.  It is a little on the tart side due to the tomato but it works.  I used fat free low sodium beef broth and low sodium tomato juice.  I will be making it again.  (this recipe does make a very large batch... be prepared!) :)

I did add a pound of low fat ground beef to add some protein.  I cut this recipe in half because it's only me, and it was enough for me to have for one meal a day all week.  Also, if your biggest pot is the one that comes in a typical pot/pan set, you will have to cut it in half because it won't fit.

I used three small cans of V8 juice and one spicy V8. Since I didn't add the full amount of tomato juice called for, I added almost the entire carton of 32 oz beef broth. Added 3 carrots and one parsnip. For flavor, I added a few bay leaves, garlic powder, salt and pepper. One 15-oz can of petite chopped tomatoes with their juice was enough (and you don't have to chop up the tomatoes). Excellent with a biscuit, although that's not helping reduce the fat! :)  Great soup not only on a cold day like today, but anytime. Will get better after it stands, I'm sure.

First of all, I like all the veggies used in this recipe. I followed the recipe as given only using frozen prepared tomatoes and their liquid from my summer garden instead of canned.
This recipe is basic and I don't see any reason why one would not add a little something  ( leftover pasta/black beans/chicken/other veggies) to their soup bowl after the original soup pot has been made.   This soup is filling  with or without the little something that may make it more to your taste. You will lose weight regardless!  PS. I would not eat this three times a day ,but find it helpful to reduce  your overall intake at any given fat/carb laden meal.

The strength of this recipe is just how much you can do to it to change the flavor. We added three bay leaves to the batch and some Cajun seasoning. I was a little concerned with the lack of protein in the recipe, so I threw in edamame, which was a great choice. Remember, you can add as many seasoning as you want without adding calories.

Great recipe.  Great flavor for a low-cal soup.  We've eaten it fresh and as leftovers now for a couple days and it is still great!

I used turkey broth instead of beef, just because it was on sale and I had plenty.  My wife loves spicy so I used spicy tomato juice and tossed in a habenero pepper to give this a nice strong slow heat.  

I do not doubt that this recipe would be great as is, I was not changing it to "fix" it, therefore I still give it 5 stars.

I made this soup yesterday and cut it to 1/2 the recipe. I'm sure glad I did, since it filled my largest pot. I made it exactly as directed and as it was cooking for at least 1/2 hour it was lacking in taste and the carrots and cabbage weren't nearly done. So I kept cooking it and added some Lawry's Seasoning Salt, a little Italian seasoning, celery salt, garlic powder, Thyme and kept tasting. Still not enough flavor so I added some chili powder and cooked it until the carrots and cabbage were tender (probably an hour and a half) and finally the taste was great. My husband loved it, and I did too with the additional seasonings. Had some again for lunch today and still have enough for more that two more helpings.  It's a keeper with my additions.

I followed the recipe as-is.  I like tomato-based soup, and this one has tons of veggies to fill you up.  The different textures make the soup less boring.  It has only been a week and I cannot say it works for me yet, though I wouldn't mind eating it on a daily basis.

I substituted vegetarian broth for beef.  This was good, but I don't think I will make it again because of the packaged onion soup mix.  I try to eat less processed food.  It is filling and the mix of veggies was good.  Not sure about the weight loss part!

I halved the recipe and added garlic, oregano, cumin and chili powder.  Instead of the whole peeled tomatoes I used 2 cans of rotel tomatoes to spice it up further. Using coleslaw mix saved time from chopping cabbage.  Great aroma and wow, what a taste!  Unfortunately the rotel made it a little too spicy for me so when I fixed a bowl, I needed to add water to cut the heat.  Very flavorful.  I have frozen some bags for future meals. Even cutting the recipe in half made a full Dutch oven full of soup.  Next time I will add some other vegetables and do mild rotel.  Also, I used vegetable broth instead of beef(will look for low sodium next time). And substituted low sodium v8 for the tomato juice as other readers suggested

The only thing I might change is to cook carrots a little before putting them in the soup, they were still a little too hard - but the soup is delicious and filling for very few calories.

I made it for the first time today and WOW this is a wonderful soup. Only deviations I made were add some cayenne pepper and I cooked it in a slow cooker it took 7 hours but oh is it good. I cut all the veggies in large pieces as a result all the vegetables were intact and not mushy.

It was a nice sout but too tomato flavoured for me. I enjoyed all the vegetables but would reduce the amount of tomato next time and find an alternative. It makes a BIG pot of soup. I enjoyed it more with a tea spoon of hot curry poeder added per large bowl when I reheated it. This reduced the over riding tomato flavour and made it very pleasant indeed.

Yes, I added one pound of ground beef and put the onion mix  on top while browning it. I simmered the soup for two hours. My family loved it. I ate it for next four days. I will make it again and again. Yummmmmmy!!

Good soup.  I  used 2  envelopes of  onion  soup  and a dash of sea salt.  It  is perfect! I took longer than 20 mins to cook the vegetables at least 45 mins. Medium low heat.

Really tasty soup! I made it pretty much exactly as specified except I used some homemade chicken broth that I had in the fridge and I also added some raw rutabaga that I had cut up from some other dish and a bit of cayenne (maybe 1/4 tsp?). The cayenne just made it a bit more flavorful. I ate the entire batch in a week by myself (5 mason jars full lol) I had to use 2 pots and it was still too much vegetables (according to the recipe), so I split used about 1/2 of what was called for in the veggies, but the entire amount of tomatoes, tomato juice, onion soup mix for between 2 pots.

This makes a huge pot.  I have been eating it twice a day, and my husband has had several bowls as well - and I still love it.  The only thing I changed is I didn't have cabbage so threw in 2 bags of coleslaw instead, and used V-8 juice instead of tomato.    I used low sodium tomatoes, juice, and beef broth.  I am making a fresh batch tonight!

I followed the recipe without alterations and it came out great. My wife and I enjoyed it fresh from the pot, I saved the rest in jars and have a bowl everyday for lunch. Be sure to start in a LARGE soup pot because it makes a good amount. It works and I will make it again when this batch is gone.

Not interested in dieting properties of this, more interested in the flavor. Changes: Used 1 qt of tomato juice & 1 large can of diced tomatoes, omitted onion soup mix and added 1 stick of diced up andouille sausage, healthy splash of both Worcestershire and Franks sauces, Italian spices, salt & pepper to taste, very good!

Substituted vegetable broth for beef broth, and used the spicy tomato juice.  I also added curry seasonings and Lawry''s as well.  It tastes awesome.

Very easy to make.  Just chop a lot of vegetables and put them in a pot to stew.  The flavor was only okay and needs to be fixed.  When the recipe says that it is for 15 servings, it is for 15+ servings.  I will not be making this, again.

Lots of good smells and packed with veggies. I didn't have tomato juice handy or onion soup mix so I substituted Bloody Mary mix and a can of tomato paste and added water to the recommended volume. I found a substitute make your own onion soup mix on All Recipes and cobbled that together with beef bullion cubes, paprika and onion powder plus parsley. Added a generous dash of salt and an even more generous dash of Louisana hot sauce.  Cooked for about 10 hours. Taste is great and how can nothing but veggies be bad for you? I've already lost over 100 pounds prior to trying this recipe. For me, this is just to maintain and have something with zesty flavor!

this is the standard soup in cabbage soup diet (also weightwatchers soup) I make a BIG pot of this often--as written  BUT on day 2, I may add a meat to my bowl, day 3 a scoop of cottage cheese, which will semi melt and kind of turn it into a cream soup, then day 4 back to just the plain soup.  Mix it up and you'll never know you're eating it every day!! and loosing weight!!

Really good soup!  I used low sodium tomato juice.  This recipe makes a huge amount so I packed some of it in several serving size containers and put it in the freezer.  I cut up a chicken breast in one serving.  I'll try stewing beef in another.  The possibilities are endless with this soup.  It's also Weight  Watchers friendly!

This soup is delicious!! I am starting a diet and I'm looking forward to seeing how well this recipe works for me. Just a warning, this recipe makes a LOT of soup, so it's great for feeding a lot of people or for having it many days in a row. If you're just cooking for yourself though and don't want a lot of leftovers, you may want to half the recipe. I filled up two large Tupperware containers with it, and I expect it will last me all week! It's also really cheap to make which is even better. Also, the recipe calls for it to simmer on medium for 20 minutes or so. Because there is a lot, make sure it's heated through and bubbling before you start the timer. I had it on the stove for about 20 minutes before it even started bubbling. It's definitely worth a go!!

Delicious with a few changes. 
Use recipe for 10 servings
Low sodium V8, oregano, basil, black pepper.
Leave out canned beans, green pepper.
Use 32 oz. vegetable broth.
Use more V8 if more liquid needed - don't use water!

I did add chili powder and lots of garlic, oregano, basil, cilantro paste, and left over sauerkraut !  Sorry, can't leave a recipe alone, that is why I love all the reviews from others like me who add extras.

The tomato is so strong it REALLY hurt my stomach. The veggies are pretty good. I drained the juice off and added some water and seasonings and it is better.

If adjusting the recipe, don't add sugar or carbs.  I season with only salt, pepper corns and about 3 - 4 bay leaves.  No V8 or tomato juice, just beef broth, water & a can of tomato sauce.  All other ingredients stay the same, except for more veggies & I add mushrooms.  You will be guaranteed to lose weight.

I make a pot & take containers to work for lunch.  Sometimes I add a splash of vinegar & siracha in my container making it more of a hot and sour, just to change it up a bit.  You can add pork sausage, beef, chicken, etc.  I use beef shank for more flavor.

I've made it for years, not necessarily to lose weight, but because my husband and I enjoy the flavors. We can't eat green peppers so either leave them out or use mild yellow or orange peppers. I'm surprised it's held up. After the new government guidelines out today wonder if we can come up with a tasty substitute for the beefy flavor in the soup mix. Ideas?

Delicious recipe.  Only change I made was to substitute V8 vegetable juice for tomato juice.  Makes huge amount of soup so I put much of it in the freezer.  I intend to use the soup as a base and flavor the future individual servings with hot sauce and cumin and/or add ground meat such as turkey or chicken.

I don't often review recipes, but this seemingly simple soup was delicious! It must be the onion soup mix, I'm sure, but it is satisfying and keeps me full for hours. Plus, you can eat 2-3 bowls of it without feeling guilty. As with most reviewers, I made a few adjustments based on what I had in the house: no carrots, 1 onion, no canned tomatoes or bell peppers. I added a few mushrooms and a diced red potato. 4C vegetable juice, 1/2C beef broth, and water to cover the cabbage. Delicious!!

This soup is an excellent way to get your veggies in. The flavor is so good you can't tell it's a "diet" food! I'm already a tiny person so I can't say for sure if you lose weight eating it, but your digestive system will certainly be cleansed lol

Good soup but my wife and I both found it missing beef.  I added beef (shredded Chuck roast) along with broth and a cup of corn.  Probably not fat burning anymore but it made a great vegetable soup.  Will make again, but will probably cut recipe in half.

I will definitely make this again.  Great recipe.  However, it took ages for me to peel and chop all those veggies and then I had to cook the soup an hour more than the time recommended.  My husband  can't tolerate crisp veggies and even then some of the carrots and the cabbage were still crispy.  Next time I will use Savoy cabbage.  I also used only one can of tomatoes.  As suggested by one reviewer I used V8 and the broth was really bright red.  I also added one head of garlic which I sautéed with the onions to start.  I think tomatoes can inhibit complete cooking so next time I will try to cook the veggies with the broth first and as little tomato juice as possible.  Then add the rest of the juice and the can of tomatoes.
For my husband I added leftover brown basmati rice and some ground cooked turkey.  Neither of us has a weight problem but we try to eat as healthily as possible.  This recipe would get five stars if I'd had fewer problems, but the taste was fantastic.

I remember this recipe, I thought I once had written it down, I remember, that I made a couple of changes First, Instead of tomato juice, I used V-8 juice. secondly, I used 4 beef bullion cubes or 2 tablespoons of powder. I omitted onion soup mix, as the onions itself is enough to flavor the soup.  Once, I didn't have green pepper, I eliminated that. For health reasons, I am restarting this diet again. Thank you for the reminder/post.

I made this because I was craving vegetable soup... And I love cabbage. The family enjoyed it. I think I'd like okra in it too. The whole head of cabbage did not fit in my pot. No changes, it had plenty of flavor. Did not need salt and my husband did not add Tabasco (shocking he always adds Tabasco) so it must have had enough flavor.

I added minced garlic. The only addition! Taste was pretty good. How often are you suppose to eat the soup? What else do you eat? Breakfast, lunch, dinner! Don't know what to do with it now that I made it! lol Eating Ziti tonight! Start tomorrow if someone tells me how & when.

I used this weight-loss recipe years ago. It worked great (but became tedious after a few days). And I agree with other reviews in that you SHOULD NOT add anything else. I had added kidney beans to give it some staying power, and I stopped losing weight. Happy New Year!

I absolutely love this cabbage soup. I would have used the whole head of cabbage had I used a larger soup pot. I also added pepper but nothing else. I even resisted the urge to butter several Ritz crackers!! 
After telling my adult children about it, they all want to try it. We are averaged sized people but eat healthy and your cabbage soup fits the bill. Thank you x 10!!

I was so pleasantly surprised by how this soup turned out. As per the reviews, I did make a couple changes. I used v8 instead of regular tomato juice, swapped the green beans for chick peas and added garlic, oregano and a couple bay leaves. I also simmered for longer than the recipe stated so that the veggies would get nice and tender (with just a bit of a crunch!). I'll check back in after I make it through the seemingly endless tupperware containers full of this stuff to let you all know how the "fat burning" worked out.

I make this rendition at least once a month!! Instead of the soup mix, (salt?) I use fresh onion, and not as much celery as they suggest!! I might add frozen veggies, a bay leaf and any kind to tomato I have in the house!! This is the "clean the fridge) recipe, and the more veggies, the better!! Cabbage alone is fat free...........eat as much as you like!!

I would definitely make this again.  I did make small changes here and there and I know a lot of people don't care for that but there we are.  I used frozen green beans instead of canned.  I thawed them first.  I used a half head of cabbage because as I started chopping it, I realized if I added the whole thing I might not have any room left in the pot!  I used a can of beef broth and a can of beef stock.  I also used a few dashes of Worcestershire which boosted the flavor very well.  This came out great and more importantly, I love it!  I'll be eating it for days and I hope to see the waistline shrink because of it!  OH!  I also used 2 quarts of V8 instead of tomato juice.

I made this and while it produced waaaaaaay too much food, it ended up being really tasty. It's an excellent way to get some vegetable content in and stay full from the liquid, but I won't eat more than 1 servings a day because of the sodium content. Throw some shredded chicken in there and you have yourself a legit meal! Should be easy to freeze. I'll be freezing like 10 portions here in a few days haha.

I'm sure one can loose weight on this soup. Though I loved the vegetables there was just too much tomato flavor. I would have liked it better with beef broth.  i won't make it again.

Very healthy soup!  If you don't like so much tomato you may want to substitute 32  ounces of low sodium vegetable broth for the tomato juice.  I used salt, pepper,  and cayenne, as well as minced garlic and chopped red onion instead of the onion soup mix.  I also included one 15 oz cans of diced tomatoes instead of two cans of whole tomatoes to help reduce all the acid.

I don't make this soup to try and lose weight, so I can tweak it in several ways if I want. The name seems to turn people off, but if I can convince them to try it they always want more!
I like spicy food, and I make pico de gallo, so I usually add that (or just some jalapeños and cilantro). I switch the veggies depending upon what I have/need to get rid of in the frig (zucchini, potatoes, cauliflower, etc).
I LOVE this soup and plan to make it today!!
I do agree that the cabbage is too much, I don't use an entire head of cabbage. It does make A LOT of soup, but I share it with neighbors and friend, or I freeze it.

This soup is delicious, whether you want to lose weight or not.  How often,  & for how long are you supposed to eat this soup in order to lose weight?  I added in some roughly chopped (roasted) chicken, and used a generous amount of chopped Italian flat leaf parsley (w/stems) for flavor & aroma.  It's vey tasty, and also healthy, so we loved it!

I followed the recipe but only used half the amount of cabbage because my pot was gonna overflow! It tastes far too tomato-y for me so I suppose I'll add some well seasoned ground turkey.

omg  I love  it I don't really like cabbage but I wanted to try this recipe because my brother recommended it and it is amazing and i didn't  put tomato juice in it cuz I'm not fond of tomatoes so you can kind of fit it  to your taste and if it tastes a little bland add some spices and seasonings to fit your taste

Made it as written but  used the slow cook method in an enameled dutch oven for 8 hours on low oven temp 220F.
It definitely has helped me reach my wright goal.  I will make it again just for because it is a good soup.  It freezes well.

I made this 3 days after Thanksgiving, so I used turkey broth instead of beef broth, and I added some diced leftover turkey.  I didn't use the onion soup packet, just some chicken bouillon, salt, red pepper flakes for heat, and black pepper for kick.  I'm not worried about weight loss, just always looking for ways to eat more veggies.  This was very tasty!

I cheated due to time and used bagged coleslaw mix for the cabbage and carrots portion of the recipe. Also, only had Ro*Tel tomatoes on hand, but that perked it up. :-)

I'm making this soup now. Let me say that I cut the servings from 16 to 8 and my crock pot is boiling over!!!! I do not have a huge pot to use on the stove, so that's why I used the crock pot. This is just way too much. So far, it smells and tastes good, but it is going to take longer.

The one thing this recipe fails to mention, it makes enough to feed a small army. But nonetheless it is very good!! I took half if it and added ground beef ...made a great hearty vegetable beef soup...especially on cold nights...highly recommend it..

I suppose it's my fault for not noticing that this recipe was for 15 SERVINGS.  My pot was filled to the brim, I had to wait til each ingredient wilted before adding another.  For a healthy soup it tastes pretty good.  The beef broth and onion soup mix gives it a lot of flavor.  Full disclosure, I added about 8 oz of pancetta/diced prosciutto...it was gonna go bad!  Next time, I will probably nix the tomatoes, b/c it's a bit overpowering.  But delicious.  Definitely does the job.

I made this tonight for dinner and I have to say I love it. I was lacking a few ingredients, the onion soup mix and the green beans so I subbed in a small eggplant for the green beans and i used some dried onion flakes, onion powder, a bit of nutritional yeast, approx. 2 tablespoons tomato paste and some pepper for the onion soup mix. Made it up like the recipe says and tucked in. Really good.

Absolutely delicious soup. I made 2 very minor adjustments. I personally hate chunks of cooked tomato, so I substituted tomato puree. Also I added minced garlic. Tastes amazing, and as an added bonus my kitchen smells fantastic!

I had been looking for a cabbage soup recipe.  Had it at a restaurant and wanted to make it.  I like this recipe because you can add whatever veggies you have on hand.  I didn't have tomato juice on hand so I just used diced tomato and some tomato paste.  It is a bit bland and you do have to season it up.  My kitchen smells wonderful.  Not looking to lose weight but for my family to eat better.  Thanks!!

I made this exactly & only thing I would  change add can green beans before done. Major amount to feed an army so gave some away because didn't think freezing would save the flavor. Would of liked more simmering instructions because the amount equated over  2hours cook. I will definitely make again!!!

Loved it! Followed it exactly and it was really good. I lost 5bs in 1 week by eating twice a week for 3 days and once a week for the next two. I'm going to continue for the next 4 weeks to get ready for a party. I am confident that I will meet my goal. I have been recommending to all of my co-workers.

Very good but I don't like onion soup mix so I just used a quart of beef stock and reduced the tomato juice by half. I added a Tablespoon of onion flakes and a tsp of minced garlic. I also added basil, oregano and fresh parsley to taste.

While I suppose the recipe does its job, its so very low on calories. But my rating is for the taste. It is so very bland. I think its great for adding veggies to your diet, and nothing more.

Outstanding!  I added 2-3 TB of Sriracha sauce and 1-2 TB dried minced garlic to the pot. I also used Chinese (Napa) cabbage as it is milder.  After cooking the soup, I scooped some into another pot with 2 fillets of chopped tilapia and cooked until tilapia was cooked through. Asian fish soup - without too much heat. Might try some extra firm tofu next time for another protein source.

Love it!  Wasnt sure if my household would too, but they did.  I pit my own spin on it though to add protein.  I substituted zucchini for the green peppers because im not a fan.  I also used spicy tomato juice to add the hot I like.  I browned a pound of ground turkey ( could have used a 1.5 lbs to make it more heart).  I also added a can of chick peas.  For the last zest I putvred pepper flakes.  It sure did have a kick.  Wojld like to add garlic next time, but im definitely happy with it.  Would of been ok as is, but wanted to make it my own and heartier to avoid wanting to eat something else.

The recipe has a good flavor, but the amount of onion and green pepper is too much. The next time I make the soup, I will cut both in half. I would likely also reduce the cabbage amount. 

It makes a LOT of soup, too. I'm wondering, for me, if it would be better to make a half recipe with one onion, one green pepper, and 1/2 head of cabbage.

This is actually a pretty tasty recipe and very low calorie. I can have a heaping bowl for dinner at only 150cal a serving. While replacing dinner with this, I seem to be losing about a pound a week. 

When I make this recipe I do make some changes, I don't include the tomato juice as I have acid reflux. I also skip the peppers, which get mushy in soups, and just double up on green beans. To flavor the soup since I just use more stock instead of tomato juice, I use a tablespoon of Gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste). This gives the stock a good flavor and adds a kick to the recipe. 

If you know you're one of the people who doesn't digest leafy greens without audible evidence, it's not a bad idea to take some Beano or Gas-X before eating this soup.

This soup was amazing! I only made half because the whole thing would be way too much. I added corn, chili powder, and some shell shaped pasta. It had too much cabbage for my taste so I only did half of what the recipe called for. My changes made it not as healthy but it was still delicious!

Sooo good...even better on day two!  I, like most, added some extras; sliced mushrooms, a few dashes of worcestershire, dried herbs.  I didn't add the water, just the beef stock and no green beans (not a fan).  Huge pot of soup, but everyone loves it, it's going to go fast!

I also like this recipe, but, as Mary pointed out, it is a LOT OF CABBAGE! That's okay, but I do wish that the serving size is specified.....15 servings how big? If you're tracking nutritional content, it makes it very difficult to assess without the volume specified. I altered the recipe only with some extra celery, and some italian style (basil & oregano) tomatoes. Delicious! Thank you, Nell.

I know it's asked not to rate a recipe if you make changes but my only changes are that I add garlic (whole cloves) and allow the garlic and onion to simmer for about an hour because I like my onion and garlic mushy. I also use veg juice rather than tomato juice. I add the other vegs (but fresh green beans not canned) afterwards. This freezes well. I ate this for two weeks for lunch and if I felt super hungry after work at about 5 or 6.  I ate regular dinner.  I STILL started losing.  Three people actually noticed the few pounds dropped after two weeks.  I brown ground beef and boil potatoes on the side to add on a serving basis for my 19 year old son.  This will be a staple in my fridge and freezer all winter.

Exactly the type of cabbage soup recipe I was looking for. I love the tomato taste in this soup. It reminds me of my youth!  I omitted the green peppers simply because I didn't have any. I didn't miss them. I am giving 4 stars only because I'm not crazy about the French onion soup mix. I did try it so that I could rate it as written. I would prefer to use some spices next time with less sodium. Overall deliciousness though!

How I've tweeked it: instead of using plain tomato juice I use a spicy V-8 and whatever other FRESH vegetables I have. Also, the addition of barley and ground beef. If you use the recipe as written hunger is likely to strike, thus eating more soup! Simple to make.

To start off, there is nothing magical about this soup that makes you lose weight.  It's tasty and full of fantastic vegetables that fill you up with very few calories.  That's it.  Lets face it though, many of us don't eat enough veggies.  I love this recipe, and often add yellow squash and zucchini to liven it up.  It's a great way to supplement your diet and get you to your weight loss goals.

Have made this once so far. Really liked it! I'm not eating it every meal, just for dinner each day, and its been fantastic. Also I only made half the recipe (since i live alone, and also dont want to have to freeze it), and i made mine into 5 servings... so that'd be the equivalent of making 10 servings out of the original recipe. 

Only modification I made was that I used vegetable broth instead of beef broth (already had vegetable broth i needed to use up in the fridge), and because of that change I got "beefy onion" soup powder at the store instead of the regular onion. I also added 1/2 lb ground turkey to mine (would be 1lb per full batch).

I definitely plan to make this again... I think the only changes I would make are adding some mushrooms, a little garlic, and possibly adding some tomato paste or blending some of my ingredients to make it creamier. Great as is too though!

I don't know if I'll lose weight this way, but I love the taste and it definitely fills you up. I added a dash of Cayenne Pepper because I've heard that revs the metabolism as well, and it was great! I uploaded a photo to show that people aren't kidding when they say it makes a lot...my guess is it's approx. 10 - 12 quarts!!

This soup is delicious!  I used the hot and spicy tomoatoe juice instead of the plain regular tomatoe juice and I add frozen mixed veggies on top of the veggies the recipe calls for.   Very filling. My lunch for the week!  :)

This is so good. I added a bit of Tabasco sauce for a little kick, a little vinegar, worcestershire sauce and some spinach, because I'm low on iron and I love spinach lol. I like my veggies a little crunchy so I simmered til al dente. Yum!

This is so good! I threw in a can of Garbanzo beans, and some red pepper flakes. I love the extra spice. I bought a lb. of ground chicken to make tiny meatball's for it. Had a big bowl before I added them, and it's just as delicious without them. Almost forgot to mention that I added a small can of sauerkraut. This made it nice and tangy.

It was okay as written.  The cabbage was way to overpowering!  The broth was very acidic also.  Next time I'll make some modifications, but it made over 8 quarts of soup so I'm gonna test out new modifications right from what I have.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a wonderful bowlful of tastiness!   Thank you so much for this idea.  I did add a few touches of my own, a couple of garlic cloves and of course a teaspoon of Sarachi is a must and just because my husband MUST have meat I boiled some Chorizo Sausage (to remove all the faat) and then sliced them us and added them to the soup.  I also used green, red, yellow and orange peppers so I was somewhat pepper heavy.  Wonderful souopl

This is the best recipe for the soup that I've tried.  Note that it will filly you up but won't keep you full for long. I usually add cooked rice to it to keep me full.

I absolutely love this soup.  I omit the green beans, but it is a great lunch/dinner replacement after a healthy breakfast.  I add spices, and use low sodium stock or boulion cubes (whichever I come across on sale lol) and it doesn't affect the weight loss at all.  It's a very yummy soup.

Used V8 Hot and Spicy for the juice so I omitted the onion soup mix because of the extra sodium. Added a little extra heat with 1tsp cayenne pepper. Also, since this was not primarily for a diet plan, I added 1lb brat links (sliced to 1/2 inch thickness) and 1lb ground turkey. Makes a lot of very tasty soup! Thanks for posting.

I do not like cabbage but hubby LOVES it.  I have made cabbage rolls but found them to be time consuming to make and wanted an easy way to fix the cabbage that would make hubby happy and me happy as well.  This soup was PERFECT!!  Hubby raved about it and it made a huge amount making it both inexpensive and a staple for his lunches all week.  I can't attest to the weight loss since that was an irrelevant factor in making it but did add jalepenos to give it a bit of kick to the tastebuds.  VERY easy and, according to hubby, delicious!

This soup turned out very good. I used spicy v-8 instead of tomato juice. I was a little disappointed because I was in the mood for cabbage soup and in my opinion this is more of a tomato vegtable soup.

TASTY! I added an 8 oz jar of rich salsa and cilantro. It came out with too much tomato flavor where you couldn't taste the other veggies I added (snap peas w/ pods, broccoli, cauliflower, bell pepper and at the last second - per bowl: baby spinach). Heeding another reviewer's suggestion, I added a can of sauerkraut, too. So I could use this too-tomato-ey concoction, I drained off much of the tomato broth and added chicken broth. THAT turned out very good.  Also, take a look at the "Ginger Beef" recipe (Allrecipes). The flavors in the two recipes are quite similar, so you might explore using this soup as base, and adding the Ginger Beef portion as a variety.

I didn't make any changes to the recipe, but did let it cook for much longer than 25 minutes.  It was delicious but I felt it needed some salt and my husband said he will be adding some hot sauce on his next bowl!  It definitely makes a LOT of soup, so there's plenty for freezing.

Super easy and really good.  This recipe made so much soup, it was more than enough for 2 people for lunches for over a week.  Once you have everything chopped, it just all goes in the pot, it doesn't get easier than that.  I simmered it for over an hour.

The only change I made to the soup, was I used fresh diced tomatoes, and added a couple of bay leaves and some fresh grated garlic - about 2 cloves.  Then I can it in a pressure canner.

I love this soup. It's a very forgiving a recipe.  Since it's harvest time, I was trying to use up a lot of vegetables.  One of the best additions was adding greens.  I used Swiss Chard adding the chopped white stems with the potatoes at the beginning and the leaves with kale   later in the cooking. I also used canned Tomatoes & Chilies which gave a little kick to the soup. From the garden I also added zucchini, yellow squash, green beans and parsley.   I used the Onion Soup Mix, but used my own vegetable broth made from all the peeling, onion skins, etc I keep in the freezer until the bag is full. Works well with V8 juice or tomato juice or a combination of the two.   This is soup is also great to use with some of the large outer leaves of cabbage which frequently get tossed out.

I made this like the recipe says and should have added additional spices.  I will try that next time and also blend some of the soup to make it less watery.

This soup is great - fresh minced garlic added some bold flavor  Sautéd in 1 tablespoon olive oil without impacting the results.   Also added cayenne pepper for a kick.   As part of a weight maintaing diet I add shredded cheese to the bowl right before eating.   I've also added garbonzo beans.

I'm not sure if the diet works, but I did make the soup and tried it so I could review it. I used slightly less tomato juice, many more carrots as mine were quite small and omitted the canned tomatoes. The soup itself is hearty, but a little bland. I'm leaving it as-is so I can try different seasonings with each serving.

The entire family enjoyed this. I left out the green peppers and halved everything except the carrots and green beans. Surprisingly delicious. Let's see how they feel in a couple of days.

considering what its for its good. im already tired of cabbage on day two and i only put in half of one! i started adding all the ingredients to my biggest cooking pot, but i think this recipe calls for a pot as big as they have in school cafeterias! i wasnt able to put all the ingredients in, but it was still pretty good.  i recommend scaling it down a bit to make sure you're able to get all the different flavors in!

The first bowl of this was very tasty and the second the next day was also good. By the third day, not so much. I can't imagine eating this for weeks on end, and let me tell you, it makes enough for that! Unless you really love the stuff or are actually using it to lose weight, cut the recipe down or freeze it. On the plus side, I ate it while I was under the weather and it's chalk full of good stuff that makes you feel better fast.

This is great for losing some water weight and flushing your system after eating all those holiday goodies. I have eaten it everyday for lunch for a week and can notice a considerable difference. I wouldn't normally make this without a lot of substitutions unless I was trying to lose a few pounds.

I originally made this for my husband who is trying to shed a few Holiday Pounds; however, I started eating it too in order to get some more veggies in my diet.  For the non-dieters: I add hot sauce and a starch (orzo, rice, etc) to make this tastier and more filling.  Next time I will make this using the Spicy Hot V8 Juice instead of regular tomato juice.  I'm also interested to try it with chickpeas and leaks instead of cabbage (my husband does not like cabbage).  The only downside is all the chopping/watching the pot to make sure it doesn't boil-over.

This is terribly bland but with some onion powder, black pepper, Tabasco sauce and spicy V8 it's really good. Good base recipe. Thank you. :)

It was good. I do suggest using spicy v8 to give a little more kick, and alot more veggies. That said... you might want to use two stockpots, or half the recipe... it makes an insane amount of soup. Even if you aren't using this as a weight loss method (I wasn't), it is a great winter soup... especially if you add more veggies & potatoes!

I unfortunately don't have a pot big enough to hold every ingredient called for.  I omitted a can of tomatoes, 1 qt of tomato juice but the soup still tastes great!  Hopefully I'll lose some weight.

I forgot to buy tomato juice so I used and extra can of tomatoes and added some tomato paste.  I put everything including a sliced zucchini in the crock pot on low for ten hours this morning and it was perfect when I got home at night!  I served some to my boyfriend before dinner and he was full from only one bowl and he has a big tank to fill!  I'm lookig forward to taking a large container to work to save me from snacking so much!

This wasn't the most delicious thing in t he world, but considering how few calories it had, it was great.  It did what I wanted it to do.  My husband, however, couldn't get past how much cabbage was in it to eat it.  I added a number of spices to zing it up, like garlic powder, pepper, italian seasoning, cubed garlic, onion salt.

Very yummy.  I simmered mine for probably about an hour to hour and a half to make sure the carrots were soft throughout.  I cut the recipe in half and it barely fit in my largest pot!  I also used some sort of vegetable juice as the broth, it wasn't just tomato juice.  I am going to eat this for lunch this week.  I'm curious to know if it'll keep me full through the afternoon!

This recipe is good. I cut back on the celery and onions. I used fresh veggies, like fresh green beans, also added yellow squash. I left out the juice, because I felt it had enough flavor with just the canned tomatoes, and the onion soup mix. It was great!

So Healthy! The flavors are wonderful and the reviews are plenty. I made 3 different soups for a family soup gathering and this was the favorite. Served with fresh homemade bread and it all went fast. Keeps well if you have any leftovers.

This is a great soup!  I just made this earlier this week, it made enough to fill my biggest pot almost to the top.  I filled 2 large tupperware things full of it then I left one at home and took one to work!  It's perfect!  The soup is wonderful and I wouldn't change a thing!

This was really, really good. It does taste like minestrone, my boyfriend liked it too. I don't know about eating it for three meals a day everyday, buy I could definitely do this for lunch everyday! I added two cloves of garlic, fresh basil, oregano, a zucchini, and a can of chick peas (don't think that will hurt the calorie count too much!).

Very versatile and filling soup. Similar to a minestrone. In addition to the recipe, I used some extra frozen veggies from my freezer (zucchini) and a little extra tomato juice and ended up with two 5 quart pots full of soup. Next time I'll only make half a recipe but now I have plenty in my freezer for a quick meal anytime.

This was just okay to me. The taste was pretty good, but there was way too much onion. I couldn't eat it for 3 meals in one day, much less for a week! I smelled onions on me all day long. At least it works for others!

It made a ton of soup but froze the left overs for a later meal.  We thought it was wonderful.  I do not think I could eat it three times a day though :)  It is a nice healthy soup on a cold day that is meatless.

As other reviewers stated, this makes a LOT of soup, so use a big pot! I made this with a few small tweaks: 1) used 1.5 quarts reduced sodium V8 juice, with 2) about 1/2 bottle of Tabasco, and 3) some leftover diced turkey (lowfat) Kielbasa. This is very, VERY good!

We made this but didn't put all of the cabbage in because it just wouldn't fit in our pots! I started this recipe using one huge stock pot, but had to end up dividing it into two separate stock pots. Definitely freeze a lot of this soup if you don't have multiple people eating with you, or cook it in a smaller quantity. But it tastes great!

This is a tasty soup.  I added chopped tofu, some cayenne pepper and minced garlic (like some other reviewers).  The soup is delicious.  My boyfriend went back for seconds.

This is very yummy.  You can also use puree tomatoes with low sodium instead of the tomatoe juice. This will make it thicker.  Next time I will replace the carrots with zucchini to save on the sugar.

SO GOOD!  I started making it and realized I only had about 1 1/2 quarts of tomato juice, so I added 1 28 oz can of tomato sauce instead.  I also used a black and red pepper combo to spice it up...YUM.  It also made A LOT--I got three 48 oz. tubs to freeze and a 32 oz tub to keep in the fridge for lunch this week.  Thanks for the recipe!  Definitely a keeper!!

i thought this soup was all right for a base but i think it needs tons of garlic, hot sauce and cheese to be good. i added low fat sausage for fun too. next time i will use diced tomatoes instead of whole. fyi the portion from this recipe could feed the whole neighborhood.

This was easy, tasty, and great for a cold winter day.  My husband and I packed it for lunch at work and it was filling, nutritious, and low in calories.  If I was making it for a main dish at dinner, I'd brown ground turkey breast or 96% fat free ground beef to add to the mixture.  I'll make this again, but probably only if we're dieting.

This is pretty good! I left out the green pepper and used about half a head of cabbage(and that was plenty). It's very tomato-y and quite filling.

Good soup, but wow this makes a huuuuuge batch!  I definitely recommend starting out making only 1/2 the recipe.  I got tired of it after about 4 bowls, so most of it ended up being dumped out.

This is pretty good, but I wasn't as impressed as I was expecting to be.  I used the Hot & Spicy V8 and cut the celery (I don't like it) and it was still a little bland (as other reviews said), so I added a 2nd packet of onion soup mix, some cayenne and a dash of salt.  That helped a little, but I think that next time I will just nix the onion soup mix and add a good amount of Tony Chachere's creole seasoning and some cayenne for a nice kick!  Very filling, though and makes enough to feed an army!

This soup was just okay for me, I ate it but I don't know if I would make it again.

I am not much on making soups but my husband and in-laws loved this.  Excellent flavor and was very good next day.
