This is an absolutely awesome recipe.  Prior reviewers have scoped things out very well: 1) cut milk by half or at least a quarter or alternatively, increase the flour to thicken, 2) reduce Old Bay seasoning to 1 1/2 tablespoons or so; two tablespoons are okay, but getting close to being "too much."  I used diced tomatoes because that's what I had on hand.  I used regular onion because I didn't have any green onion.  I left the melts under the broiler for two or three minutes for a golden brown appearance on the cheese (instead of 30 seconds to one minute).  Watch the melts closely though.  Food that close to the element can burn easily, of course.  I used provolone on most of the melts, but tried pepper jack cheese on three of them and it was excellent too.  For something a little different and definitely worth the trouble, give this one a shot!

I'm giving this a 4 because the end product came out very well.  But I think there are some adjustments that need to be made on the ingredients.  First of all, there is way too much milk.  I used a little more flour than called for (added an extra pinch or two) and only used HALF the milk called for..and probably should have used a little less milk.  I would say add the milk in batches and stir, and stop before it gets too soupy.  I used frozen shrimp that was about 3/4 defrosted, so I may have had A LITTLE more liquid than normal, but it is just too much milk.  Even with only using 1/2 the milk mine was still boardering on "soupy".

The other adjustment I would make is the Old Bay amount.  I love Old Bay, and I like things salty and spicy, BUT, the full amount (which I added) was on the boarder of me enjoying it (which I did).  If it were any saltier I would have probably eaten it, but though "god this is salty" with every bite.  The finished product also tastes distinctly of Old Bay, so if you aren't a fan, this is not the recipe for you!  And don't salt your tomato before you broil it!

I would also like more celery and green onion, and used Swiss intead of Provolone, but that is just personal taste.  Ended up tasting very good, just watch the milk and the Old Bay.  :-)

This recipe was excellent.  It was a bit spicy, next time I will use 1 tbsp of old bay instead of 2.  I also took the advice of another and used only half the milk, and it was plenty.  Very easy and very delicious.

This was so insanely salty it was practically inedible and I only used half the Old Bay.  Wow, maybe with like a teaspoon of Old Bay it would be good.

Really liked this recipe. I also used only one cup of milk and used a general "spice and herbs" seasoning instead of the Old Bay. It was a little spicy, so I will reduce the amount of seasoning next time, but overall was impressed.

Well I took the IDEA of this recipe, but changed it up based on what I had on hand, and what we prefer.  I used sun dried tomatoes in this b/c I LOVE them, and left out the celery.  I also used cream instead of milk b/c I needed to use it up, but cut it in half.  We prefer french bread, so I served it over those, and they were awesome!  We had leftovers, and they were even better the next day!  With my changes I give it a 5!  It's a good one to just play around with based on what you have on hand and what seasonings you like.

Fantastic flavor!  I really didn't measure anything, but probably added extra celery and onion and a little less Old Bay and milk.  Will use all the Old Bay next time.  I will definitely be making this again--looked and tasted like I worked a lot harder than I did.

This recipe was amazing! This was my first time ever cooking shrimp and I really haven't cooked much at all but I used all of CURTISLEE's recommended alterations and I even left out the celery (bf doesn't like it) and I forgot the tomatoes but the recipe was delicious!  **The roux is incredibly rich so I would cut these in halves and serve them as appetizers or plan on eating just one with side dishes because.   Great recipe though even for a beginning cook!

Normally my boyfriend doesn't like shrimp or even celery but I thought I'd try this anyways. Not only did he LOVE it..he wanted seconds! When he finished I told him celery was in the dish and he said he knew but that he couldn't even taste it. :)

Delicious! I serve the shrimp mixture over Tuscan Pane bread from Trader Joes, not on English Muffins, though. Also, I like to add extra celery and serve with a green salad. My husband and I both really enjoy this simple meal.

I loved this recipe-quick, easy and delicious.  I didn't make the sauce though.  I just sauteed the shrimp and onions with the seasoning in some butter.  Spread some mayo on the english muffin and viola!  Very good!

Totally unimpressed!  The Old Bay is way too strong.  It overpowers the shrimp so I couldn't even taste it.  My kids wouldn't eat it, nor would my husband, after about the 2nd or 3rd bite. Unfortunate, because this recipe looked like it would be great.

Nothing spectacular.  We couldn't finish it.  There was way to much seasoning in this recipe.  I think even cutting the seasoning in half would still be too much.  It also calls for way too much milk too.  Very disappoined.  It sounded good but it was not.

This is a superb recipe. My fiancée absolutely adored the final product. However, I made several changes. First off, I cut the amount of milk in half; any more would have made the mixture too thin. Also, instead of slicing the tomato, I chopped it up and mixed it in right before scooping the mixture onto the bread. As for the bread, I used sliced sourdough (with mayo); instead of English muffins (it’s what I had). I also did not broil the melt; instead, I put it in the toaster oven for 4 minutes at 450, and that melted the cheese (Provolone and Swiss) just fine. 

The amount of Old Bay Seasoning was acceptable, though I saw several varieties at the store, so I imagine some are spicier than others. I used the garlic and herbs version and we didn’t find it too spicy.

Overall, this is a great recipe. It’s flexible and has a lot of potential.

This was delicious, but I did have to make a few changes.  A bit of advice first, though...  Make sure your english muffins are well toasted!  Mine weren't toasted enough and they got a bit soggy.

For the changes: I took another reviewer's suggestion and reduced the milk to 1 cup.  Also, while I was thickening the sauce, I did add a bit more flour (by sight) to thicken.  I used the amount of old bay called for, but I do agree with other reviewers that this could be reduced as well.  It was a bit much for me, salt wise, and I would recommend cutting back to 1.5 tbsp to start and back down from there as needed.

Making this recipe was a bust.  There is way too much milk so it dilutes the supposed sauce that is supposed to flavor the shrimp.  Result:  no flavor and soggy English muffins.

I tried this recipe.  I did not melt it over bread, but pasta instead.  It was trial and error with making the roux.  I cut down on the milk, used the stated amount of flour, and put in a Old Bay to taste.  I loved the taste.  Great recipe.
