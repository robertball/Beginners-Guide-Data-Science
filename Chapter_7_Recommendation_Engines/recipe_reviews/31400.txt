HELPFUL Hints...Follow recipe to a "T".  After baking for an hour it will not look done (except for an inch around the perimeter).  It's OK and really IS done.  Leave it overnight loosely covered with foil.  Must be completely cool before cutting otherwise you end up with odd shapes.  I used the straight edge of my cutting scraper to get even cuts (that you scoop cut veggies etc with).  The purpose of the potato starch is to keep the edges from sticking to everything.  Go EASY as it masks the flavor of the mochi.  I "spank" the excess off so they are very lightly covered.  I've baked in both types (metal and glass) and prefer the pyrex as the edges don't get as hard.  Plus the edges soften overnight and are fine to keep.  I added a picture to show how lightly to coat and how neatly the shape turns out when you wait for it to cool (on the yellow plate).  I also grew up in Hawaii and found this to beat out all my Hawaiian recipe books.  Thanks for the post Dewny!

This recipe came out terrifically!  I live in Hawaii and buying Chi Chi Dango is expensive relative to the ingredients and ease of making.  (About a dozen 1.5 inch pieces will sell for $5!)  So I decided to find a recipe and make it myself.  I've made it three times within a week and each time it has come out perfectly.  

I will share some lessons.  For some reason, some stores only have 13.5 oz (not the 14 oz in the recipe) cans of  coconut milk.  It was not a problem.  Also, if you let your kids help you with the potato starch dusting, make sure they go easy.  To them it looks like powdered sugar so they think, the more the better.  I ended up individually dusting off the excess from each piece.  I agree with the previous reviewer to make sure the pan is completely cool before removing so that it keeps its shape.  Lastly, trim and discard the hard edges.  (The sides get crisp as it is against the pan.)  
I shared the results with many different people and they all said it was the best they ever had.  Thank you Dewny!

It's so good it allows you to play with colors and flavorings! I have tried green tea powder, strawberry, lemon, melon, cinnamon, cappucino, and chocolate flavorings. And all turned out fabulous.   It's so easy to make, too! I just dump everything to food processor and process it for a 10 or 15 seconds before pouring it into the lightly greased pan. Fool proof.  Also try substitute half coconut milk with non dairy whipping cream and you will never look back.   Some tips: a) I bake mine in water bath, bottom rack, for about 1 hour to avoid the crusty edge problem. b) Let it cool down completely at least two hours, overnight better, before flipping it out of the pan. c) Use lightly greased plastic cake knife for easier cutting. d) For safer option, toast the coating starch without oil for few minutes and cool it down completely before using. e) For the neat coating, put coated mochi in a big strainer and shake the excessive starch off.   Excellent recipe! The only bad thing about this mochi is that I can't stop eating them!!  Definitely a keeper. Thanks, Dewny!

I'm from Hawaii, moved to California and have been looking for a good mochi recipe. This recipe is perfect. The mochi comes out soft and chewy. I made mine pink. Just be patient and let it cool completely. Best is to make it a day ahead and let it cool overnight, then cut in pieces the following morning. Much easier to handle and slice. Also used the trick of wrapping a plastic knife in saran wrap. I never used that method before and it made the cutting soooo easy! I used potato starch to coat. Wonderful - just like the old japanese grandmas used to make for me back home. Followed the recipe to the "T". Can't go wrong.

This recipe is terrific!  Instead of baking it a 350 degree I bake it at 325 degrees for 1 hour and turn off the oven and left it in for 15 minutes. I also used parchment paper and the edges weren't as hard.  My grandchildrens thought I steamed it because it came out so soft and the recipe is easy and they are able to do it on their own. Linda

I made this recipe numerous times. The first two times the center took forever to bake, but the third time I raised the foil in the middle and it baked great.  The sides always seemed to overbake, but overall it was yummy.

In case anyone can only get a larger than 1 LB box of sweet glutinous rice flour and needs to know how much equals 1 lb: I  measured the contents of a 1LB box of Mochiko and it came out to 2 Cups + 3/4 Cup + 1 tsp + 1/4 tsp. give or take a smidge ;)

We enjoyed this quite a bit; couldn't find potato starch to roll the gel sweet in; used tapioca starch instead with great results. (Tried powdered sugar, but it threw off the flavor.) Next time we are going to try Mango juice instead of coconut milk, and I bet we like that too! Thank You for the recipe!

EXCELLENT mochi recipe- very authentic.  I grew up in Hawaii so I consider myself an expert on mochi. :)  Don't worry about cutting off the crust that forms around the edges during cooking- leaving the mochi at room temperature for 24 hours will soften the crust so that it is almost imperceptible.

We love this recipe.  We adjusted the sugar to 2 cups and tried a few variations.  We divided mixture into 3 parts.  In one part we added 1 tsp green tea macha (green tea powder).  In another we added 2 tsp flavored jello (cherry, strawberry, fruit flavoured).  In the third portion we  put 3/4 tbsp cocoa powder.  In a large 9 x 13 glass baking dish, we sectioned off three areas with parchment paper or tin foil.  Pour each part into individual section.  Bake in a water bath (larger container with water around 1/2 inch surrounding baking dish).  Cover with tin foil.  To serve after cooling, use a bit of cornstarch to separate.  For the chocolate, use a mixture of cocoa and cornstarch.  This recipe works really well for frozen mochi ice cream.  Other individual additives for mochi flavouring - strawberry, cherry, lemon, cappucino, mango, make sure to blend well.  In Hawaii this is cut into small pebble-like pieces dusted with cornstarch and served in a paper cone.  Can also take a large 3" circle, add azuki bean paste, chocolate pudding and a strawberry.  Fold up so only tip of strawberry shows.

Simple and easy! I've made this recipe for MANY parties and pot lucks, it has become very popular and goes quick.  I followed the recipe exactly, i don't even mix the ingredients separately if I'm rushed.  I just through it all in one big bowl and mix it up with my hand blender.  You also don't need to buy Potato Starch, just save a little mochiko flour and it works the same.  WAIT FOR IT TO COOL! Ideally I'll make this the night before and let it cool overnight, it is very dense so it takes a while to cool.  Cut with a plastic knife, it's much easier.  I like to dislodge the mochi from the pan then peel it out and place on a pre-dusted(with mochiko) cutting board. Then I slice it into squares or rectangles and dust the sides in mochiko.  If you plan to make this often it may be wise to just buy one extra box of mochiko flour and use it for dusting this and future batches of Mochi!  Enjoy! :-)

THIS IS A VERY GOOD RECIPE AND VERY EASY. I live in Hawaii and making mochi is very common.  My first time making mochi was with this recipe a few months ago. 
When i took my first batch i made to work, many people said this was the best tasting mochi they have ever tried, even those who make mochi often. THANKS FOR THE RECIPE DEWNY!

Very good.  We halved the recipe, cooked it for 50 minutes.  Came out fine.  Coated with tapioca starch/flour.

Very good, chewy chichi dango! I had some at a Pinkberry the other day and had to try to make it myself! Here's some tips:
It's fine to omit the food colouring. I used mango puree instead of coconut milk and it came out perfect! Only use 2 cups sugar, and it will be sweet enough. When covering with foil, make it domed so that the mochi doesn't touch the foil. I have a fairly new oven which has a higher temp than usual. I still baked for 1hr at 350 degrees, came out looking very runny in the middle (I could still move the batter around in the middle) so I turned off the oven and left it in for 10 more mins - came out perfect! It should look slightly UNDERDONE but not to the point where there is still liquid on top - will be jiggly and move around in pan. I left mine to cool overnight at room temp! I didn't have potato starch, so I used the mochiko. I microwaved it for 20 seconds to be safe :) Also, when removing foil it will stick, (I forgot to grease foil) so use the rice flour on your hands and rip the foil off the mochi, not the mochi off the foil & it will come off easily. When cutting, use a plastic knife wrapped in seran wrap which cuts through effortlessly and doesn't stick! What I did was dump all the cut pieces into the mochiko and then put them in a sifter and tossed them around to get off the extra flour on them! Good luck everyone! :)

Wonderful Mochi recipe! The only thing I changed the second time making it was decrease sugar to 2C & left out the food coloring. First time I listened to another reviewer & cooked for 1hr. Not enough! It was mushy in the middle, had to toss. Second time I cooked for 1hr 15mins & checked with plastic knife in the middle. Rave reviews for this! Also, dusted with tapioca starch. I went to Chinatown & I did not find potato starch anywhere & went to several stores. Tapioca is better anyways, potato sounds strange! Next time will incorporate red bean paste somehow..I am thinking encasing it before it cools completely! So easy & so yummy & chewy!

I grew up in Hawaii and moved to the mainland recently. I was so bummed that I wasn't able to buy mochi in the grocery store anymore. All I had was a glass 9x13 dish and it still came out alright. I didn't want to bother with the potato starch so I just cut what i needed and left the rest whole for later. Thank you so much for this recipe! I made it last night and everyone loved it. I will definitely be making it in the future.

Excellent recipe!  My ethnicity is Japanese and I've been eating mochi all my life.  This recipe will save me a lot of money because my young daughter loves it.  She took the mochi to her school potluck and told me everyone devoured it.  One of the parents took the leftovers home :-)
Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

I attempted making this. I followed the recipe to a T! But I think an hour was way too long on my oven at 350. It seems a bit over cooked and doesn't have the texture that store bought mochi has. the bottom and sides have all crusted slightly. I might give this another go but cutting some of the bake time in the recipe.

Very authentic!!! A few tips: I would recommend cooking for longer than one hour. I cooked it for one hour and the middle was still unset and doughy. Maybe add another 15 min. Also, the finished product tastes best when its been in the fridge for a day or two before eating. It gives the moisture time to even out and "set" the mochi pieces. I added azuki (sweet red beans) to my mochi by dropping spoonfuls of it over the top of the mochi batter before baking. I used a sharp metal knife sprayed with cooking spray and it didn't stick at all.

I love this recipe! I've made it more times than I can count and the first time I followed it to a T. I have omitted the vanilla as it isn't a traditional Japanese sweet. My mom is from Japan and she loves this recipe. 
I also add mini spoonfuls of sweet red bean paste throughout and love it. One last thing, I've always used corn flour to dust and it turns out great. Thanks for the recipe!

Just like the store bought kind.  I loved it and I am so impressed I can finally make a childhood favorite dessert for my kids too!  I used a pizza cutter to cut the pieces.  Spray with baking spray on the blade first and it didn't stick once.  I dusted each piece individually and it didn't take longer than 20 mins to make about 60 pieces.  Super happy!

This Chi Chi Dango Mochi recipe is delicious!  Like everyone else says, follow the recipe to a T and it comes out perfect.  The hardest part was having the patience for it to cool off.  Mochi is hard to find and when I come across any in my travels, they are expensive.  Now I can make my own to give as gifts!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

This mochi comes out great!  I've made it several times for different functions, and it is always a hit.  Tips I've used that work for me are as follows: 1.  Bake the mochi in glass so the edges don't get too hard. 2.  Wrap butter knife in plastic wrap to make cutting easier. 3.  Roll cut mochi in potato starch and tap(spank) off the extra.  Side note:  I've also found a recipe here for 'Ono Butter Mochi', which I highly recommend.    Thanks to the submitter!

The texture was very good, chewy, and smooth. The taste was just sweet enough and tasted exactly like store bought mochi. I used red food coloring to make these pink. I also substituted tapioca starch for dusting since that's what I had on hand and the taste was unaffected. Next time, will try to put ice cream or red bean paste in the center to make them even more spectacular.

This stuff is so good we bribe our friends with it. Nobody we know has found it too sweet, either. I think the sugar and the coconut work very well together in the proportions given. Just be careful; don't be a dolt like me and accidentally pick up plain, non-glutinous rice flour. It won't work at all. Also, an extra ten minutes and an elevated center to the tinfoil will help lots, as other users have suggested.

Really simple recipe. I don't have a lot of experience with baking and making food in general, but it was pretty simple.  I had a problem with mine and that was with the foil. The center didn't get to cook all the way because the foil ended up touching it, so like I read what someone else said, the thing that I would do next time is make the foil go up in the center so when it bakes the mochi doesn't rise to touch the foil or the foil fall to touch the mochi (I'm not sure which one was the culprit).  Then, the 2 1/2 cups white sugar seemed a bit much for me. I don't eat a lot of sugary things so even though this is pretty light compared to some things, it was still too much. Next time, I would probably either use less sugar or some kind of sugar substitute that is a lot more light to make it more fitting to my constitution.   I would also probably bake it for 10 mins or so like someone else said, without the foil, to get the finishing 'bake' done to the whole mochi.  I am a newbie at making food so some of these might be foolish mistakes.

i like this recipe so much. the coconut milk practically is the special ingredient. my daughter enjoys it. i had to buy special tools to make this because i made it so often. i put potato starch in a big foil pan & fliped the mochi in it. to make room for cutting & moving around. & i used pam to spray the pan so it wont be too sticky. be careful. too much will cause a mess. it could even ruin the mochi.

This mochi recipe is  a cinch to make, but the results are not very appetizing.  The coconut taste coupled with the sweetness of the mochi made it very cloying to me.  I couldn't eat more than one.

First time trying to make homemade mochi using your recipe but substituted the red food dye for cacao powder instead, and I too used tapioca starch and it tastes great!  Thank you so much for putting this out there for everyone to enjoy!  I'll definitely be using this as a base for other flavored mochis to come;D

I know nothing about mochi, except that it's in many mangas/animes, and I made it. I did not expect it to be so stretchy! and gooey! The consistency was rubbery and a little difficult to swallow. Did something go horribly wrong or is that how it's supposed to be?

This was the recipe I've been hoping to find.  I didn't want a butter mochi, this one is more like a traditional pounded mochi in flavor.  Does anyone know though, if I could cut down the sugar a teeny bit?
I made it for Japanese cultural week at preschool, and both kids and adults loved it...not everyone, of course.
It's a little new and unusual for some folks.  Has anyone tried substituting fruit juice for the water? 
This recipe was simple and turned out easier and better than I expected. Thanks so much for sharing!!!

good flavour although very sweet... the texture at the edge of the mochi was good.. the inside was chewy and horrible. I think I will do a smaller batch next time :/

I made some of this as an ice cream or frozen yogurt topping, so I cut it into pretty small pieces, which was a little time consuming (but worth it). When made for this purpose, this recipe yields a rather substantial batch, far more than I could ever eat. I tried keeping it in the fridge, hoping that it would keep a little longer. It was really good when fresh, but after several days it got a little dry and crumbly. Since the beauty of mochi is in its texture, that was kind of disappointing. This is a great recipe though and really pretty easy (aside from the tedious work of cutting it into bits). I highly recommend it for mochi fans out there.

My kids ask me to make this on a regular basis.  I did as one reviewer suggested and put the pan in a hot water bath. I found it took about 15 minutes longer to bake.  My family like the plain and green tea flavors best. (see reviews) If you have a steamer, cook it in that.  It's the way it is done traditionally, and you won't get any crusty edges.

We only used 2 cups of sugar, and dusted with tapioca starch.  It was delicious, texture was soft and perfect!  Will go great with ice-cream.

Note that it tastes more like Singaporean/Malaysian/Indonesian kueh than Japanese mochi, due to the coconut milk, but that's fine with me since I'm Singaporean and I *love* kueh.  This tastes similar to lapis sagu, but if you didn't grow up eating Southeast Asian food or Japanese food, you probably won't know the difference.

The recipe itself is great, and very easy to make!  I used slightly less sugar than the recipe called for, and it was perfect.  I took other reviewers' advice and "tented" the foil in the middle of the pan, as well as removing it after 1 hour and baking for an additional 10 minutes.  I also omitted the red food coloring because I didn't have any handy and I prefer white mochi anyway.  One caveat, though: I lined the Pyrex dish with wax paper, thinking that it would stick less.  Not only did it still stick with vigor, the wax paper also melted into the mochi, rendering most of it completely impossible to eat!  I will try again, using a bit of oil and flour to prep the dish instead.

This recipe is even quicker and easier than it sounds.  I followed this recipe almost exactly, and had no problems.  I used 1/3 cup less sugar, and it came out just sweet enough. When baking, I would suggest taking off the foil for the last 10 minutes, Or keep the foil up so it won't touch the mochi.  Otherwise the foil sweats onto the mochi and makes it soggy. I didn't have vanilla or color, so it was a little bland, but I dusted it with powdered sugar & cocoa instead of starch - worked out fine. It seems easy to make flavor changes to this, so I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe! I love mochi, but in Bali, they always sell mochi with peanut filling. It's round with peanut and sugar inside (maybe someone think this is a good idea?). But I prefer plain. I think it's a lot better. I halved the recipe to give it a try and came out great. I found that it's more difficult to take the mochi out of the pan, rather than cutting it. And I cut the coconut milk bcos I don't want it too coconut-y. I don't have potato starch, so I use corn starch instead. I 'fried' it a few minutes, w/o oil of course, just to have it cooked a little bit. So I didn't eat raw starch. Anyway, will make this again and again. I'm so happy I can make my own mochi. Thanks alot!

My first time making chi chi dango by myself...turned out great!  I used just 2 cups of sugar and it was sweet enough.  I also didn't bother with the potato starch--just left it in the pan.  A tip that I learned from relatives is to TIGHTLY wrap the pan with foil as it helps the mochi steam while it bakes.

Yummy and very easy to make!  I didn't have any food coloring, so I added about 1/4 teaspoon of Pandan (Screw Pine) paste.  It came out with a nice flavor and very pretty shade of green. Though the sides tend to overbake and get crusty, they're just as tasty and fun to chew on.  Definitely will be making this again!  =)

Wow!  Super easy.  Super tasty.  My son is allergic to red food dye so I didn't use any food coloring which shouldn't have made any difference as far as taste, anyway.  In the future I think I'll use 2 cups of sugar instead of 2-1/2 and maybe a bit more coconut milk.  I used a serrated plastic cake cutter because I didn't have any plastic knives on hand.  It worked very well but expect to have to get the hang of cutting and handling because they are sticky!  It tasted as good as the ones I buy!  And I'm also from Hawaii-LA-San Diego where you get the best mochi!

I started it late at night, set the oven on 350°, then let the mochi cook for 25 mins, covered.  shut the oven off and left it in the oven all night without opening the oven door.  In the morning I took it out, inverted it and cut it after dusting with potato starch.  Perfect consistency with no hard crusty edges.

Made a half batch of this last night, using a whole can of coconut milk and half cup of water, in a 9 x 9 pyrex.  I also only used 1 cup of sugar.  It's plenty sweet enough.  Waited until today to cut and taste it.  Delicious!  Used mochi flour for final dusting.

I thought I would really love this recipe because I grew up on Okinawa and have been looking for that "pink mochi" we could buy in the markets.  My son loved this recipe, but he wasn't raised on "original mochi".  For me, I thought the taste had too much coconut flavoring (from the milk obviously), and it's not the original mochi taste I yearn for and miss.  I gave it 4 stars only because my kids liked it.

Very tasty! Important to note to not refrigerate any leftovers, or the texture will be off. We added some banana flavor.

This recipe went very well! I added a pinch of salt, though. It was very sweet and it had a beautiful color! I used six drops of blue food coloring instead of red, actually. Looks really pretty and tastes delicious! I can’t wait to see what my friends think!

This recipe is wonderful!!  I followed it exactly and it turned out great!! My friends all say it's better then what you can buy!  Be sure to let it cool all the way before you cut it ( also don't try to rush it and put in the fridge- this seemed to make it come out softer)

I'm so please the recipe is here. For me it turned out too soft and too sweet, but so smooth. {:-) (I was used to the nonsweet mochi surrounding store-bought mochi ice cream.)
Tip: Cut it with _scissors_ in strips, pick up the strip and dab the sticky cut sides on [cornstarch] in a 9"x13", cut into squares, toss into a small bowl of cornstarch, then a wire strainer/sieve to shake off the excess. 
Solution for "too soft": dehydrator?--I'm checking that now.
Perfect solution for "too sweet": dark chocolate balsamic vinegar (Baton Rouge's redstickspice online).  Oooh, a neat new little treat creation.
Next I'm going to try a homemade gelatin with mochi in it.
PS. Added a tad more cornstarch and stored it successfully (no sticking) for a few days so far in a brown bag in a plastic bag (both) in the fridgie.

I made this hoping to mimick the mochi at Menchies. I wanted it to have a slight strawberry taste so I used 2 cups sugar and 4 tsp of strawberry jello for the flavor. I prepped and baked it for 1 hour, turned the oven off and let it sit for 15 additional minutes based on the prior reviews. I sat it on the counter loosely covered overnight and the consistency was perfect. It is quite a mess to cut it up. I dusted with the potato starch and used a kitchen aid pizza cutter to make strips, then used a kitchen shear to cut cubes from the strips. I let the cubes drop into a pyrex dish with potato starch in it then gently rolled them and put them to the side before moving on to the next strip. This recipe makes an enormous amount (one full gallon ziploc bag from just this one 9X13 tray. I will give more feedback about how long it lasts in the refridgerator. The consistency was really great, very soft. As a side note, it did not have a coconut flavor to it which I was afraid of for obvious reasons. Maybe the strawberry jello flavor masked it. It did not taste very sweet and I don't think it would be bad with the additional 1/2 cup sugar. I used the jello for flavor but it is not very strong. I wish I had local access to a strawberry extract to try with it instead. Would love to hear if anyone has made the strawberry flavored and how they went about it.

Perfect amount of sweetness. The tip about cutting with a plastic knife was spot on! I used the non-stick foil on the market to avoid using oil and ease of  mochi removal. Thank you for this recipe. Chichi dango is quite pricey at the supermarket, much cheaper to make your own.

This was my first time making Chi Chi Dango and it was super easy! Very simple to make. Coming from a Filipino family I had majority of the ingredient at home and the ones I didn't we're easy to find.  I'm hoping to play around with different colors and flavors next time I make this. Follow it to the "T" and it'll come out perfect!

You have to be very careful not to overcook this recipe. When I cooked it the full time it would come out dry and no good. It works out great if you start checking it ~20min before it is done.

I live in Hawaii, and have always been curious to try an easy mochi recipe. Chi-chi mochi is one of my favorites, so I was enthusiastic to make this recipe for a school project on Japan I was doing! I found that the mochi was amazingly professional in both presentation and taste, despite its fabulous simplicity! Wonderful!!!

Worked very well. I could not find potato starch so rolled pieces in sweetened coconut flakes.  Tried corn starch as a substitute but the coconut flakes were much better.

Made a half batch and it turned out SO GREAT! This really is as easy as all of these comments say it is. I made it last night and let it sit on the stovetop to cool overnight. Dusted it with more mochiko this morning and cut it with my pastry cutter. Next time, I'm going to use pandan extract instead of red food coloring and vanilla.

It was absouletly amazing!! however, I would add maybe pepermint extract or another kind of extract as well to add a bit of zest.
