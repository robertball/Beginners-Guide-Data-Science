Easiest recipe out there. Great for the holidays. I reviewed this in 06 but am making some updates as of 12/09. There is another cornbread casserole recipe (by Sarah Piepert) which is great if you want a more tradiitonal cornbread.....almost identical but has butter, no cheese, less sour cream, and a better estimated cooking time. As a rule of thumb for both recipes I always omit the eggs (I like my cornbread more bread-y and less like a souffle) and then cook for up to an hour or hour and 15 minutes.   A 30 minute cooking time is not enough. Regarding the cheese, if you're going for a Mexican inspired meal add it in. I usually use 1/2 the suggested (4 oz) shredded mild cheddar.

Plan to serve Cornbread Casseroles using a spoon. It really wasn't meant to be cut into pieces like the picture.

I love bringing this meals to holiday gatherings because it's so easy and always a hit.  With preschool kids to dress and get ready, the last thing I need on a busy holiday is to prepare a complicated dish.  Enjoy.

This is delicious!  I don't usually cook things based on canned or packaged ingredients, but was rushed for time and this looked quick and easy.  I made the recipe exactly as listed, except I added only 4 oz. of shredded cheddar cheese to the top instead of 8 oz.-- and I used reduced fat cheese.  YUM!  The texture is perfect, not mushy at all.  The flavor is just right and the aroma while baking is incredible.  My husband and I both really enjoyed it and I'm sure I'll be making it again.

Yummy & super easy!  My boyfriend and his brother ate it up fast!  I served it with  Alyce Voorhees
"Mexican Lasagna" and the cornbread complimented the spiciness of the lasagna.  Bravo

This is absolutely one of my favorite corn bread recipes. Only thing I do different is I do NOT save the liquid from the corn and I add one 4 ounce can of mild green chilies. Very moist, very VERY good. I have a hard time keeping this one around, it always disappears. NOTE: To make this even better, heat some butter in a cast iron skillet while you preheat your oven, then pour the batter into the skillet and cook that way. Omnom.

This was teriffic! I read the recipe but did not have the boxed cornbread mix. So I mixed 1 cup flour, 1 cup yellow cornmeal, 1/4 cup sugar, and 4 teaspoons baking power.  The rest of the recipe I followed as is.  It came out perfectly!  It is very moist.  Hubby LOVED it.  Will probably make this at Thanksgiving.

found this recipe a few months ago & it is a BIG hit with hubby-who would like it once a week-so I gave him the recipe to make whenever. Have added some finely chopped jalapeno or 1 can drained green chilies..also a dash of cumin.I never liked plain ordinary cornbread but this one is soooo good & moist & just plain delicious. Thanks.

This recipe was ok, not the best.  I added onions and cumino to spice things up and I think if I hadn't then it would have been really bad.  My husband hated the texture, so I doubt this is very kid friendly.  Sorry to be a downer, but I was hoping for more.

This was good, but it didn't seemed gooey and liquidy in the middle.  Maybe you shouldn't add the corn juice. It seemed better when it was left in the fridge overnight.

This was a great recipe.  The only reason I gave it four stars is because it took a little longer to cook to make it set up better.  I gave it about 10 mins. more.

Very good recipe.  I made it for a family party and almost the whole thing disappeared.  I changed the recipe a tad by mixing 1/2 of the cheese into the batter and putting the other half on top.

I made this to go along with some beer chilli made by a friend - it was a huge hit!! Everyone went back for thirds. I used light sour cream and reduced fat cheese to cut down on some of the calories/fat, and it was still delicious. Great, easy recipe to make!

The flavor is good, but I would not call this a casserole. More of a spoon bread if anything. I was looking for something to jazz up my cornbread to serve with chili. You can't use this as a corn bread. Also, don't put the cheese on top, its weird! Mix it in with all the other ingredients!

Almost exactly what I was looking for. It was so good with chili. I put it under, my husband and son put it on top. Of course everyone who cooks makes some changes as they go along, but this recipe is adaptable and great without any alterations.

Terrific!  This recipe reminds me somewhat of the yummy, sweet corn pudding you get at Chevy's.

Thought this was super yummy- but did twist the recipe a bit. I omitted the "reserved corn liquid" as there were many complaints about the consistency and cooking time. I omitted the cheese and instead added a quarter cup of honey to make it a little sweet. Cooked perfectly in a pre-heated oven for 30 minutes. Great paired with something spicy!

I received several compliments on this when I made it for company.  I used slightly less cheese, probably 7oz and fat free sour cream, which was good.  I used low sodium corn, but I think I should go with regular next time.  Also I might reduce the sour cream just a little.

I made this recipe to use up some sour cream, except I only had 4 oz sour cream -- so I used a little less than 1/2 c. of milk and didn't include any canned corn liquid.  Either due to this or poor positioning in the oven, I had to bake 25 minutes longer.  But it turned out tasting fine!  Even though I'm not a fan of moist/soft cornbread, I'm liking it.  Seemed to taste better after letting it sit in the fridge a couple of days and reheating.

I loved this! I made it as is except I did not use nearly 8 whole ounces of Cheddar cheese..I figured that would be way too much!!! I sprinkled with maybe a 1/2 cup and that was just enough. This would be a great side dish to many meals and it's even better the next day when you re-heat. I also had to leave this in the oven for about 50 minutes so if your gut tells you it could stay in there longer depending on the oven you have, you're probably right.

This was great.  I'm a health nut so I subbed light sour cream, no salt added whole kernel corn, and used a bit less cheese but it still tasted fantastic.

I enjoyed this - I made it just as written, but the next time I make it (and there will be a next time!) I think I'll add chives or green onions for just a bit more flavor.  A wonderful alternative to regular corn!

I made this last night with Grill Salmon last night. Very yummy but I had to bake it for 45 minutes and it still seemed not set and the cheese on the top was way overdone by then. Taste was great after putting in the micro for another 7 minutes to finsh. If I make this again I will not add back the reserved liquid.

I made this for a church supper.  Doubled the recipe, and substituted cream cheese for the sour cream.   It was delish!  It was wiped out fast!  Will definitely make this again!

the only thing i did differently was add black olives and use half the amount of cheese , and split that in half( half cheddar/half jalapeño jack) - it still came out a little bland to me but a good recipe to build on. next time i will add onion ( less corn) and chili peppers...

maybe i just expected something else....if i recall correctly( i'm just trying to organize my recipe boxes, so i didn't study the recipe again...) I also didn't have cornbread mix... so i used corn meal, that could've been a factor... it just was extremely bland

This recipe is SO easy to make and delicious!  I made it for the first time 2 weeks ago and since then we've had it 4 times!  I have requests to bring some to our holiday parties because it is such a crowd pleaser!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

My boyfriend says this is absolutely a keeper! I did mix the cheese in, instead of just putting it on top.

This is not cornbread and this is not Mexican.  This is more like a southern corn pudding.  The cheese is a nice addition, a salty foil to the corn's sweetness.   This recipe is wonderful as is.  People looking for cornbread, this is not for you.  This is corn pudding.   this isn't supposed to be a dry bready thing. It's a bit misleading with the name and description, but those who know, know.  This isn't supposed to pop with flavor either, it's supposed to be sweet, corny, and comforting.  Make this as is and watch what happens! ;-)

I have made this recipe several times. Sometimes I change it up a bit and add sauteed onion and/or red and green peppers.  Yummy!  Or instead of plain corn I use the Mexicorn!   My family loves it.

Made this tonight and loved it. I added chopped garlic, onions, and jalapenos. I sauteed them in butter and olive oil before folding them into the mix. Also added a pinch of cayenne pepper. It came out deliciously! Went perfectly with our winter chili.

I used a bigger package of cornbread mix (the honey cornbread mix from KrustEase), and used 1/2 cup of sour cream but that was my only change...YUM! My daughter raved about this and what was left over...she ate by the next day! So easy to put together too. Definitely will see this on the table again soon.

I make this once a week for my family who LOVES it!  Only suggestion:  Cook for 20 minutes, then sprinkle the cheese on top for the last 10 minutes.  Otherwise, it burns and isn't as good.  I also sometimes add a can of Rotel to spice it up a bit.  Also, try using Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream for a healthier version - tastes just as good!

This is the best!  It is more custard-like than traditional cornbreads but I let it cool completely before cutting it and had no problem.  My husband says it's the best cornbread he's ever tasted.

I followed the receipe exactly.  It was very good, but could have been a little sweeter.  Next time I will either sprinkle some sugar on top before baking, or put some homey on top before baking.

This was great served with pinto beans.  My only tweakes were 2 tablespoons of melted butter and 1 Tablespoon of sugar.  Maybe it was my oven but the cook time was closer to 40-45 minutes. The texture was like spoonbread and that is exactly what I was looking for.

Used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream (forgot to buy it) and it was delicious.  Excellent recipe.

I modified the recipe since other reviewers thought it was "runny" I will include some of the reserved liquid from the canned corn.

I added 1/4c. chopped bacon, small can of chopped green chiles, and 2 tbs of taco seasoning.

I will definitely make it again :)

This is great- so simple and very hardy!  I made it as a side for a dinner for 12 (including toddlers). . .almost everyone had seconds and the recipe made the perfect amount for my needs.  I did cook it at 375 for close to an hour, mostly because I had something else in the oven at that temp at the same time.

Very yummy! I put half the cheese inthe mix and the rest on top. A little too moist. Next time I will not add any of the corn liquid. A keeper.

We loved this recipe. So easy and so tasty. It was a bit too moist even though we cooked it 10 minutes longer than required. Not sure why. Maybe I put too much sour cream in...

I had my own personal recipe for scalloped corn which is very similar to this, but I will say this wasn't too bad. Definitely worth trying if you like corn and are looking for different ways to cook it!!

Pretty good, I thought it needed a lot of salt. I added the cheese into the mix, did not put on top. I'll probably make again because it was so easy.

I would definitely reword the title & description, as this is not a “casserole” at all. I would honestly call it a very dense “corn cake”. And I’m just not on board with this one. 
It is extremely dense. WAY too “wet & soggy” for my liking. I ended up baking it for twice as long, and the middle is still the consistency of underdone cake batter. It has a nice crust, but that is about all I can say. It’s pretty heavy & somewhat sweet.

This was really good and easy to make. I did not have a can of whole kernel corn so used 2 cans of creamed corn and added a little milk for the liquid. I mixed some cheese in it as well. Kids all liked it. Would maybe next add some rotel to give a bit of a kick.

Just perfect!   Only change I did was about 4-5 oz shredded cheese, as I wanted the corn flavor/Johnny bread taste to come through.  The texture is perfect.   I assume it will freeze well?    Definitely a keeper

We were very pleasantly surprised by this one. I was afraid it would be overly sweet because of the creamed corn, but not to worry! The outer edges get a nice golden brown while the interior is creamy and satisfying. This one has inspiration written all over it. Anything you can do with polenta or grits can be done here. Jalapenos, cheese, herbs.. the list is endless. Spicy shrimp and grits is going to be my next one. 
And the ingredients only cost a couple dollars!

Very good!  I think though that it's needs an exact measurement of liquid (from the can of corn), because mine turned out somewhat dry.

I didn't have sour cream. Instead, I brought an 8 oz package of cream cheese to room temperature and beat it into the eggs (adding an extra egg) and corn. I also added a couple of cans of green chillies and several diced fresh jalapenos and baked it in a cast iron skillet that is melted about 3 tablespoons of butter in first. It was very good!

Great as is or can get as creative as you want, it’s pretty forgiving. 
First had this as a child in Vicksburg, MS and their version is less sweet, more buttery, and no cornbread mix. 
Good memories!

Easy dish to make, I added a little cheese to the mix and a small amount of chopped green onion. Very delicious!

Added several minutes bake time. Keep in mind if you change the dish or pan size you obviously have to adjust.  Check with a knife inserted in the middle, like some pies.

This was delicious.  Instead of adding the cheese to the top, I mixed it in with the other ingredients and it turned out great.  Tasty and good consistency.

I made this and really didn't care for it. It was too bland and was lacking flavor. I followed the directions exactly and added some onions but the casserole still had no flavor. If you like your food well seasoned with flavor then you may need to adjust the recipe accordingly.

Love this! ive made this at least 8 time and everyone loves it. It taste like a really moist cornbread. I add more cheese if I make it for the kids. I think bacon would also taste good. Its usually a Thanksgiving favorite.

I've made this several times with the exact ingredients in this recipe and it had aways been a big hit!  Only thing I did differently was mix the cheese into the batter which it looks like the author did anyway.  Last time I made it I did add a can of green chilis (small) and it was great too.

I made the following changes- I used only one egg, and mixed half of the cheese into the casserole and sprinkled the rest on top. It did need to be spooned out like a casserole, but after it cooled, it could be sliced and picked up. It was delicious!

I made this one Thanksgiving for my family, and they looooooved it!!! I made the mistake of taking it into the office for our annual holiday lunch, and that was it!!! Now every year, more like everytime we decide to do a potluck, I know what everyone wants...Cornbread casserole!! I can make another dish, but this has to come with it ;) ;)  I love this recipe. The only adjustment I made was adding onions, but with or without the onions, THIS DISH IS A HIT!!! Thanks for posting ;)

We made this recipe for a pig roast our friends were hosting. We thought it would go great with BBQ. This recipe was super easy to make, and uses inexpensive ingredients. It was hardy without feeling heavy. However- the taste was very bland, you mainly tasted the corn over anything else, including the cheese. Perhaps adding onions and more cheese throughout would perk it up.

I add a can of diced green chilies or jalepenos and another box of corn bread mix and use pepper jack cheese. My family loves it. I normally serve it with grilled pork loin and a salad.

This is easy and very good.  I use small cubes of cheese in the mix so it doesn't completely melt away and I add some chopped jalapeno minus the seeds for a little kick.  Then I top it with a little more shredded cheese.

This recipe is hard to rate because at first I didn't think I liked it. I cut the recipe in half (with 1 can creamed corn ONLY) and put it into a pre-heated cast iron skillet with 2 Tbsp melted butter - per advice from another reviewer to crisp up the bottom (which I also highly recommend). When I first tried it, the texture wasn't what I expected, it's like corn pudding. I expected it to be more moist-bread-like. But as it cooled, it set up a bit more and I found that the more I ate it, the more I liked it. The heated leftovers the next day are the best. Anyway, for me it was an acquired taste, mostly because of the soggy texture, but my hubby really liked it and I will probably make it again!

I have been making a similar recipe for years which I found via Jiffy.  I like my cornbread sweet so I delete the cheese and add a little granulated sugar.  My southern mother-in-law calls it spoonbread.  I have also been known to add a can of chopped green chili's to it as a side to my white bean chicken chili!

This recipe is a staple at Thanksgiving and many other meals all year!  You can substitute  a can of Mexicorn for the can of whole kernel corn for more color and flavor or  you could  add a 1/4 cup of  diced green and/or red peppers if you have any on hand.  Simple and delicious.

Was really delicious.  I make something similar, but, I leave the cheese out and add a stick of melted butter. It more resembles spoon bread than a solid cornbread. Don't worry...the calories fall out when you cut into it!

This was really great!  I used a 15 oz box of mix instead of 8 and it came out really well.  I think next time I will try to bake it at 375 for 30 min to keep the cheese from browning so much and maybe keep it a tad bit gooey-er...but everyone loved it!

Just the recipe I was looking for!  My husband and I had this at a friends house and ever since he has been bugging me to find a recipe.  This is exactly what we wanted!  This would be good with chili, or just for a snack.

If you're a fan of creamed corn but wish it had more body and lots of whole kernels in it or if you love the little scoop of corn stuff on your plate at Chi-Chi's but wish it wasn't as sweet and a little moister, this recipe is for you!!  Unfortunately, no one in my family falls into either of those categories, so I'll be removing this recipe from my box.

Good.  Took the idea from Lil Mermaid and made it to go along with Mexican Zucchini Soup.  The two dishes went well together.  My husband is not a cornbread fan to begin with, my girls like cornbread but didn't seem to gravitate to this dish.  I enjoyed my portion and gave away the rest.

This was pretty good, with some changes, I think. I never thought I would say this, but there was too much cheese! I put half the cheese in the cornbread and half on top.  Next time I would stick to just half inside and none on top.  Also, I think I would cut the sour cream in half and add some jalepenos or green chiles. But overall, it fit what I was looking for, so thanks for the post.

This is one of my kids' favorite dishes (5 and 7 yrs old).  I was out of cheese once when I made it and it didn't make much difference so I usually omit it.  I also frequently use non-fat yogurt instead of sour cream. These two changes remove a lot of the fat.  The yogurt adds a little extra tang.  I use the Jiffy cornbread mix which adds just enough sweetness.  The other mixes leave it a little bland.  Try adding diced green chilis.  Yum!

This was OK but not nearly as good as the one with honey I found on this site.

Great recipe - my family loves the texture and pieces of corn.  This is almost a meal by itself! I threw in some pieces of real bacon for a twist. Yum!  I make this at least once a month for my family. Thanks for the recipe!

This was good but I prefer a sweeter cornbread, so if you are looking for sweet--this isn't the recipe for you. Or, substitute a sweet cornbread mix. Still a nice dish!

This is a nice, quick side, however I prefered to omit the cheese and cover the baking dish to make it more moist and less crunchy.

This is a sweet cornbread, very moist. Very good with beans or chili! I omit the cheese when I make this recipe.

Followed the recipe pretty closely, but it came out very "gluey" in texture.  Taste not bad, but there are similar, yet better recipes for this on this site.
