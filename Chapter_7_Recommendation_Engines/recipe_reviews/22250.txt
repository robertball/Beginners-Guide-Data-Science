Don't get me wrong, I have had fudgier brownies, but I made this recipe with a no-name $0.50 brownie mix, and it made them not only edible (they were fairly dry and gross with just the package directions) but very very moist and fudgey. I also tried this once more with sour cream instead of apple sauce and that worked out very well too. Thanks for a great recipe!

They weren't bad, but they didn't taste any better than regular box brownies.
