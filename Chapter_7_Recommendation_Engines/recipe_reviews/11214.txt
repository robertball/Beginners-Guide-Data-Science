These cookies are fabulous!  I substituted butter for the shortening and 2% milk for the buttermilk and they turned out perfectly.

This is a great cookie! I've never eaten, let alone made, peanut butter cookies before, but these are brilliant and easy to make. They taste peanut buttery, but light and unusually for eggless cookies there is no baking soda aftertaste!
I used margarine instead of shortening, semi-skimmed milk + 1 tsp vinegar [for buttermilk] and only half the salt. I baked at 180C for 11mins in a fan oven and they came out chewy in the middle and crispy at the edges. I also froze half the mix to bake later as it made about 50 cookies.
Next time I might try it with crunchy peanut butter.
I'm going to add a photo so you can see how they came out.

Good cookies.  I couldn't stop eating them. I did find that there was not enough flour in the recipe.  Need at least a 1/2 cup more.

I was craving hot, fresh peanut butter cookies, but not having any eggs in the house meant I was about ready to give up on it.  Then I found this recipe, and I'm glad I did!  Believe it or not, it even scaled down to one cookie very successfully (I have a terrible obsession with eating enormous amounts of cookie dough, so I have to limit myself).  I did sub margarine for the shortening, and omitted the salt, as I never have shortening in the house.  Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, delicious.  I may use a bit more peanut butter next time though, for that bit of extra flavour.

I, too, was out of eggs. My husband requested peanut butter cookies. With a great deal of skeptisism, I made these cookies and to my delight and surprise...THEY ARE WONDERFUL!!! The best peanut butter cookies I've ever had! I made a double batch and will be bringing them to Thanksgiving dinner. My children and husband LOVE them. As do I. Oh...I added chocolate chips and half chunky almond butter half peanut butter. VERY good.

Like so many others, I was low on eggs. :) But I wanted to bake cookies! I used ½ cup margarine and ½ cup apple sauce in place of the shortening, I used ½ cup white sugar instead of a whole cup, and I used 2% milk instead of buttermilk. I got 5 dozen out of the batch, and they needed 12-13 minutes in the oven. I think the lesser amount of sugar might have affected the texture of the dough (I prefer roll-and-flatten cookies to drop-and-flatten ones), but the cookies, while not quite as beautiful, came out tasting great. Thanks for sharing, L.J.!

I was out of eggs, didn't want to go to the store and REALLY wanted some peanut butter cookies. This recipe was perfect. I used butter instead of shortening and they turned out great. I also cut the recipe down to make about a dozen since I was only baking for 2

Thanks for sharing...I'll be using this more often.

This recipe was fabulous.  Everyone loved them and were surprised when I said no eggs.  A great go to dessert if you don't have eggs.  UPDATE: 2/2017  I made these and topped with mini peanut butter filled kisses.  YUM!!  Also, it is really important to bake at the recommended temperature.  I accidentally set my oven at 350 and the first pan spread.  I reset and they were perfect.

I went back and double checked the recipe to see if I left something out or did something wrong but I can't see any errors.  These turned out to be the ugliest cookies I've ever made and looked nothing like the picture.  They were VERY flat when done.  That being said, they were delicious, and that's all that matters to me.

I love these cookies.  My son is allergic to eggs and milk.  I substitute almond milk for the buttermilk (I'm sure any milk substitute would be fine) and they are great.  Thanks so much!

This recipe came up in search for desserts with no eggs. I needed to make something that was quick and easy with just a few ingredients I had on hand. My taste-testers liked these cookies! After reading some reviews, I decided to bake them at 165* and baked one "drop" style without flattening which turned out well. Since they were for a church event, I formed the rest with a small scoop (like a little ice cream scoop) so they would be uniform in size and shape. There was no problem with dough sticking to the scoop, and pressing with a fork would have resulted in too-flat, possibly burnt results.  They only baked about 8 1/2 - 9 minutes. Hope this info helps!

I made peanut butter cookies from the Betty Crocker recipe book a couple of weeks ago and I ran out of eggs today so I tried this recipe instead and it tasted exactly the same! After flattening the cookies with the fork, I sprinkled a tiny bit of sugar on each cookie. Thank you! =)

My grandpa is also allergic to eggs so I was looking for a recipe for Christmas last year. These were great! I followed the recipe exactly except substituted butter for the shortening. They were also VERY yummy with a Hershey's Kiss on top!

This is a great recipe! Word to the wise... the ones who just had a baby or still pregnant and have that brain fog going on, don't forget the buttermilk! I was wondering why they were so crumbly. hehehe they're still really good though. :)

I added 1/4 cup of flour to thicken the dough and used butter instead of shortening.  The extra salt made the peanut butter flavor stand out.  I only made a half portion of the cookie dough and there was a lot of it!!! I made 1" sized balls for the cookies that I then flatten with a fork (see attached before baking pic). I placed 6 cookies in a 13x9 baking dish and the cookies were touching each other when the baking was done.  I will make smaller balls next time

Mmmmm. Very good.  I pretty much followed recipe as stated but used a little extra peanut butter...about 1/4 cup.  First batch burnt before 11 mins...second batch, on a different style cookie sheet, seemed a little undercooked after 10 so just really keep a close eye on them.  No matter the batch, though, they were ALL still yummy! :)
I measured level tablespoons and managed to get 65 cookies.  A keeper, for sure.  Even the raw dough is delish!! Tastes like the inside of a Reese Peanut Butter Cup! This is a very, very sweet cookie.  Next time I MAY try only using half the sugar......

Here are the changes I made: butter instead of shortening, milk instead of buttermilk. Since I used salted butter, I only used 1 tsp of baking soda. That being said, these cookies were soo good!

I made them for friends who came over and they just could not stop eating them. I added chocolate chips to about half the dough and they came out great too.

Perfect for when you want cookies and are out of eggs :)

I followed the same recipe except that I reduced the shortening to half cup and added 3/4 cup of buttermilk. One of the best cookies I have ever made.

Awesome, best peanut butter cookies I've ever made.   Had to make a few adjustments for lack of exact ingredients in the cupboard, plus tried two other variations on second and third batches.  I halved the recipe, used butter instead of shortening. Didn't have any milk, so used soy milk. Used a 2:1 ratio of white to whole wheat flour. Added about a teaspoon of vanilla.  For second batch, I made a well in each cookie and dropped in some strawberry jam. Totally yum.  For third batch, added a lot of high quality chocolate chips. Also totally yum.  And really, the batter is so tasty without cooking it first, you have to be careful otherwise you'll end up with no cookies at all.

I was out of eggs so I tried this and it was AMAZING!  But one tip is don't flatten with a fork, I use a special 1 teaspoon cookies scoop, then I just put then in the oven for 10 minutes.  They stayed nice and chewy and totally mouth watering!

Great recipe! Used 2% milk plus 1Tbsp vinegar for the buttermilk, and used butter rather than shortening. Didn't miss the eggs at all, I will definitely make these again!

These were a tasty PB cookie. I did add some candy coated pieces and skipped the part about smashing with a flour coated fork (not sure why you would use flour and not sugar). I cut the white sugar back to a scant cup and the brown to 1/2 cup and they were plenty sweet enough. They are a very soft cookie and do fall apart if you don't let them cool completely. Prefect for those who are allergic to eggs  or are running low on them like I was tonight =))

Awesome! Made these for my husband's birthday.  I used real butter instead of shortening, and white splenda instead of white sugar...1/2 C light peanut butter and 1/2 C reg. peanut butter (all I had!) and the reast of the ingredients as called...they are delicious, great texture...evenmy son who hates peanut butter had some!

Wonderful! I used this cookie base to make my son his favorite peanut butter cup cookies, because I didn't have any eggs.  Great flavor, and easy dough to work with.  Didn't have to chill it like I usually do the other dough.  I'll remember the buttermilk/baking powder sub incase I ever run out of eggs again!  Thank you L.J.!!

I halved the recipe. Right out of the oven, I could have eaten every single cookie. Later, they got more crunchy. I used crunchy peanut butter, and added choco chips to the last half of the batter before baking.

I'm so glad I found this recipe- I promised a batch of peanut butter cookies to a friend but found I had just enough eggs for the pies I was also baking that day. These turned out great and my friend loved them! I added some swirled chocolate chips to half the batch which was also tasty.:) Thanks!

These cookies were FANTASTIC! Light and airy, but slightly crisp, not cakey at all like I was expecting. I stumbled upon this recipe while I was looking for a way to use up the rest of the plain yogurt I had in the fridge, so I ended up making some small changes. I subbed the yogurt for the buttermilk, added a teaspoon of vanilla, reduced the amount of white sugar (only by a 1/4 cup though... might even reduce it a bit more next time), and added some peanut butter chips and chocolate chips. The results were amazing. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Best cookie EVER! Need not to look any farther...crunchy but chewy, light and airy, simply satisfying. Margarine works well as the shortening. Nothing but rave reviews from this house hold. I only was looking for the possiblity of an eggless cookie. How pleasntly surprised was I to find this! Have I said how great this recipe is? Well I am saying now, F-A-B-U-L-O-U-S! Simple and effortless. I could go on and on about this is a must try. :o)

My family votes these as the best peanut butter cookie I have ever made!  From now on, this is the only recipe I will use.  I did substitute butter for shortening which I don't think made any difference.  My first pan of cookies was gone before I could take the second pan out of the oven!

These were by far the BEST peanut butter cookies I have EVER made, much better than store bought. They turned out buttery and crisp and were gone in under an hour. I substituted butter for shortening, and half and half for butter milk, other than that I left it exactly the same. Thank you so much for this recipe, it really is a jewel!!

Very yummy, best P.B. cookie I've made so far!  Was very sticky to mix with the electric mixer though.  But is worth it & tastes great.  Says it makes 24 cookies, I got 52 somehow.  Was a LOT of batter.  Would make again...hope it freezes well, I have 52 cookies!

My daughter is not only allergic to eggs, but she is also allergic to peanuts!  I followed this recipe but substituted soy butter (sweetened) and also added 1 tsp. vanilla extract as recommended by other reviewers.  SHE LOVES THESE!  And my husband and I think they taste great too! Now my little girl can have "Peanut Butter" cookies like everyone else!  Thank you!

I'm giving 4 stars only because I adulterated this recipe a bit to make it almost completely vegan.   So I'm not giving an entirely accurate review of the given recipe. First, I cut the recipe in half which still makes about 24 smallish cookies. I replaced the shortening with 1/4 refined coconut oil and 1/4 cup peanut butter (to make it extra peanut buttery). I lessened the called for white sugar by an 1/8 of a cup. I also replaced the buttermilk with almond milk. I added chopped up Hershey's kisses (the only thing not vegan) and some walnut pieces I wanted to use. I pressed down the tops of the cookies with a fork. My version of the cookies didn't spread out much at all so next time I will probably flatten them more before baking. I also used parchment paper and baked for about 14 minutes with the given baking temp. They turned out soooo delicious! Probably the best vegan cookie I have made to date. Will definitely use this recipe as a starting point again!

These were incredibly good. I substituted whole milk with a little vinegar (no buttermilk on hand), used crunchy peanut butter, and added a splash of vanilla extract. Baked for 11 minutes, they were perfect. The texture is amazing, thin cookie that is pretty soft and chewy with just bit of crispness around the edges. Beware that if you drop a tablespoon size amount of dough, you'll have some really BIG cookies. Not a problem for me! Thanks for the recipe...

Easy, basic peanut butter cookies.  they really spread, so bear that in mind, and if you don't like flat, thin cookies you won't like these.  I thought they were good and tasted great.  Thanks for the recipe!

These cookies turned out really thin for me.  I even tried adding more flour and refridgerating the dough.  I really like a thick, crumbly peanut butter cookie.  I will keep looking for that perfect recipe!

Great recipe. I didn't have eggs, buttermilk (milk of any kind for that matter!). I used 1.5 cups butter, 2 cups sugar (I didn't have brown sugar either), and the rest was the same. I think it would have been better with brown sugar, but I used what I had on hand and they turned out pretty good. They only needed 10 min at 375. Oh -I used splenda instead of real sugar just becasue I always do that. Yummy!

Like many others, I wanted to make cookies but had no eggs. So I used this recipe, added vanilla, used half shortening and half butter for the fats and used regular milk instead of butter milk because that's all I had. They are the best peanut butter cookies I've ever had. Light and buttery and crispy with just the right inner texture after 12 minutes. For a little more tender go 10 minutes but I like the crisp. I did not however pay attention to the yield on this recipe. It made a LOT of cookies (which isn't a problem if you've got a house full of peanut butter lovers) but I would halve this recipe for future use. Also, these ones spread out during baking a bit more than usual PB cookies, so don't flatten them out as much with the fork tines and spread them out well. Yum!!

I came across this recipe when my ingredients were limited. I substituted the buttermilk for plain soymilk and only had 2/3 cup white (organic cane) sugar, so I used extra brown sugar. They turned out a little more cake-like than I suspect the original recipe would, but they were still quite tasty. I would be interested in finding a (vegan) soymilk alternative to add a little extra moisture.

These cookies are so yummy!!  They're a good mix of crunchy/chewy and especially tasted good with crunchy PB.  Like other reviewers suggested, I added another 1/2 cup or so of flour.  I chilled the dough slightly, scooped, flattened with a fork and yum-yum!!!  I uploaded a picture so people can see my results.

Great cookie! I too was out of eggs, and while looking for a peanut butter cookie recipe, here it was. Only changes I made were to substitute the buttermilk for regular whole milk, and added one cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Outstanding!

My boyfriend loves soft cookies, so of course he loves these. I've made peanut butter cookies several times for him, and these are his favorite. Thank you for the recipe!

Holy Cow!  These things are great!  I didn't have enough shortening, so I added the rest margarine.  I put about 1 tsp vanilla in it.  My son and I had a blast rolling them!  Great recipe!

I used this recipe because i had no eggs in the house. I expected a mediocre cookie, but found them moist, easy and delicious. I added 2 teaspoons of vanilla to the recipe (i am a vanilla fanatic!) and they were so delicious. I piped the batter into tiny flowers and baked. They came out perfectly and the guests at my party all commented on the wonderful cookies. I was even asked by several to pass on the recipe!

A very tasty peanut butter cookie recipe!  I added M&M's and traded some of 
the shortening for more peanut butter to accent the flavour.  They don't need 
to be pushed down much because they do flatten on their own.  They were very 
quick and easy to make.  I'm interested to see if they stay chewy...

Awesome recipe! I was low on eggs which lead me to this recipe and low on shortening so I made up the difference in shortening with butter. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla!

Our son has an egg allergy, baking cookies is always a challenge! Used butter in place of shortening and 1% reg milk for buttermilk, less sugar as I added a Hershey kiss to the middle - followed recipe except for those and they turned out perfect! Triple the batch if you have 4 boys in the house :) thanks so much for a versatile delicious recipe!!! And careful they spread a lot ...

Dense, chewy & delicious! I needed to add a couple extra tablespoons of flour and I used half butter/half vegetable oil in place of the shortening. I also did not have buttermilk so I subbed plain, 2% Greek yogurt. Yum!

I started to browse around the site looking for something to satisfy my sweet tooth and ran across this recipe.  Granted I looked at other recipes for peanut butter cookies- all of which called for oats- which I lacked.  And upon seeing this one didn't require them I decided to give it a go!  I have to say that I am very impressed by this recipe!  The cookies are delightful, and the only thing I changed was the buttermilk.  I didn't have any, so I just added milk instead with a little bit of butter added to the mix.  They're simply delicious, and I'm certain I'll be making them again very soon!

This is a really good recipe! The cookies came out perfect, just how I like them. Soft on the inside and crisp  on the outside. I didn't have any eggs but I had everything else and now I'll always use this recipe regardless. I substituted the 1 cup of shortening for 3/4 cups of vegetable oil and used milk in place of butter milk. YUMMY! Too bad my son doesn't like peanut butter!

I really wanted something sweet today and decided to make some cookies.  I didn't have any eggs so I Google egg less cookies recipes and this recipe popped up.  I had all these ingredients and decided to give them a try.  I reduced the recipe down to 8 servings just in case I didn't like it.  I used butter instead of shortening and whole milk as well and added a little vanilla. I didn't have all purpose flour so i used self rising instead and omitted the baking powder. Surprisingly the cookies came out great and were very moist. I def will make again and use other things.

I just made these cookies with modifications for my grandson who is allergic to not only eggs, but also peanuts, tree nuts and all dairy products.  I used Earth Balance buttery spread (although, I am sure shortening works fine), sunflower seed butter, soy milk and I added enjoy life allergy friendly mini chocolate chips.  They are super!! Hope this is beneficial to those who are in the same "allergy loop" as we are.

This really should be 4.5 stars. My BF asked me to make him PB cookies which is usually not a problem but I was out of eggs! Admittedly I was skeptical at first but they actually turned out great! I did use 1/4 cup of WW flour and for part of the sugar I substitutes honey and threw in a dash of vanilla. I also rolled these in sugar before flattening. Scaled to yield 12 cookies actually gave me a really large 2 dozen.

This is by far one of the easiest, fastest and most delicious cookie recipes I've ever used. Only changes I made were I substituted peanut butter for dark chocolate dreams by peanut butter & co, the buttermilk for chocolate soy milk and I rolled the cookies in sugar before baking. Not only did they bake up quickly, they looked and smelled beautiful and taste AWESOME! Thank you :)

These were good however I did use 1 cup margarine instead of shortening and the cookies turned out flat. They also seemed like they needed more peanut butter, next time I will try adding more. Overall these are good cookies when you don't have any eggs.

I made these cookies because I was out of eggs but craving peanut butter cookies.  I was extremely disappointed.  This is the first recipe that I've not given a minimum of 4 stars.  The dough was extremely dry - I added a 1/2 cup extra peanut butter just to make it pliable.  It just wasn't worth the effort.  It was two sweet and too dry for my taste, and I have a major sweet tooth.  I won't be making this recipe again.

well, initially i meant to make an egg cookie. then i found out that we had none. so i foudnthis recipe.  i was then further frustrated by the fact that we had no shortening, so used butter, and then used a milk-vinegar substitute rather than buttermilk.  I was afraid that they would turn out terrible, but they're GREAT, and it was well worth the frustration.
oh, and chocolate chips top them off nicely.

My son is allergic to eggs and peanuts and a long list of other things.   I made these cookies using NoNuts brand golden Peabutter (it's made from golden brown peas) in place of the peanut butter.  They turned out so delicious!   It’s a new family favorite!  Thank you for sharing it!

I added the vanilla as suggested by another reviewer and had to substitute skim milk for buttermilk, but these turned out amazing!!  I just pulled them out of the oven and I already cannot stop eating them.  My son, a cookie critic and connoisseur, loves these!  I only had half the amount of shortening so I added two tablespoons of canola oil and they still turned out fine.  Great recipe!

For peanut butter lovers, this recipe is awesome.  Usually, I'm not tempted to sneak a bite until the baked goods are in the oven, aromatizing my house.  But this time, just mixing the dough was enough to make my mouth water in anticipation of the goodness to come.  Despite lacking several key ingredients, the recipe was still very forgiving of my substitutions.  Applesauce in place of butter, molasses in place of sugar (except I used only 1/4 the amount of sugar called for in the recipe), half the amount of white flour was replaced with wheat, and finally I had no baking powder.  Due to my extreme altercations, the cookies came out to be more like "muffies".  But the peanut buttery flavor was definitely enjoyed by all and happily devoured.

I did have (and can eat) eggs, but this recipe was rated so high I had to try it. Tasty! I might try more peanut butter and less shortening next time like many people suggested, but the cookies came out wonderfully nonetheless. And I can share them with my cousin who doesn't eat eggs. ^.^

This really is THE BEST peanut butter cookie I've ever had.  I had to stop myself from eating all the dough.  I used 2% milk and added vanilla and they came out great!

These cookies are the best!  I love peanut butter and so does my little sister and I couldn't stop her from eating all the cookie dough!  When I made this recipe for my friends, they kept askking me for more, more, more! Thank you L.J. Bryan!  I, my little sister, and my friends all will never forget you and your recipe!

I was somewhat reluctant to try this recipe because there aren't any eggs in it, but this is the best peanut butter cookie recipe I've found yet!  I reduced the shortening to 3/4 cup, and increased the peanut butter to 1&1/4 cup. I didn't have any buttermilk, so I made sour milk (1/2 TBS lemon juice, then enough milk to equal 1/2 cup, then let sit for 5 minutes). I tried rolling the cookie balls in sugar, but I think they're much better without.  Flattened slightly, and cooked until they were a light brown to keep the cookies soft.  After 3 days, the cookies are a little crunchy, but still the best!  My new favorite!

My youngest daughter and I made these for my 4-year-old nephew, who is allergic to eggs.  We also added half of a bag of milk-chocolate chips to half of the dough. We just flattened the top of the cookie dough just a bit as they are too thin and breakable if pressed too much.
The results were mixed; I loved the cookies, as did my son and teenage daughter.  The daughter who helped bake them did not like them.  Neither did my husband (who loves peanut butter, but said they did not have enough taste).  My nephew did not like them (turned out he doesn't like peanut butter), but his mom and dad scarfed them down!
The chocolate chip version was good, too.
All in all, I would say that this is a good cookie, whether you need to avoid eggs or not!

These cookies were great.  Wonderful peanut butter taste.  They do flatten out quite a bit so I didn't push them down very much with the fork.  great texture.

I try to avoid using eggs so I gave this recipe a shot.  I added more flour as suggested by other reviewers and these were ideal.  The first batch, I kept in for the lesser amount of time and they came out very soft; the second batch, I left in for longer and they were cripsy.  In both cases, they were delicious and gone in one day!  I will be making these again.

I LOVE these cookies!  Instead of peanut butter, I used soy butter, WOW brand found at Walmart for around $3.70.  I didn't have shortening on hand, so I used all butter.  Also, used half white wheat flour, and white all purpose, greek fage yogurt in place of buttermilk, Sugar in the Raw brand plus 1/8 cup of molasses in place of brown sugar.  Sprinkled sugar in the raw on top after forking - super yummy!  My daughter is allergic to all nuts, so soy butter is an excellent substitution that you would never know the difference.  Adding white wheat flour and Sugar in the Raw adds a healthier twist to this awesome treat!

This was an awesome recipe, but I found myself without brown sugar and buttermilk. Instead, I substituted 1/2 cup sour cream and and extra cup of white sugar. I also used butter instead of shortening, and added 2 tablespoons of maple syrup. Chewy and soft, incredible flavor, this one is a keeper!

Turned out great! I substituted milk for buttermilk (i think they would have been better with buttermilk actually) I also used about 1 1/2 cups of peanut butter, and added semi sweet chocolate chips to half of the batch. Both with and without chocolate turned out really good. This with be a recipe my daughter and I use again and again!

i added a little honey to the batter and substituted half butter, half applesauce for the shortening and 1% milk for the buttermilk. i also sprinkled a tiny bit of cinnamon on top before baking. overall, these cookies will suffice for my cookie craving tonight, but they are rather bland. definitely not flying off the plate the way a baker would hope.

Wonderful recipe. You don't have to refrigerate the dough for hours, and since there are no eggs, I didn't feel guilty about letting my kids have some raw dough! I like how these turned out more than my usual peanut butter cookie recipe.

On one hand I was really happy with the recipe given the lack of eggs - which is what I was looking for. On the other it was just a bit flat tasting. I was expecting a richer peanut butter flavor and even added about 1/4 cup more PB and 1/3 cup chopped roasted peanuts, yet it just lacked something. Wondering if using a different brand of PB would help....don't know. It's a great PB base recipe...just needs some tweaking.

This is a very nice very easy cookie to back- it cant really go wrong if you follow the recipe. But it did need extra flour, and I added white and milk chocolate chips to it which baked beautifully.

Very chewy, and easy to whip up within a few minutes, thank you for the recipe!

These are great cookies for having no eggs in them.  I followed other reviewers advice and added 1/2 extra cup of flour and substituted buttermilk for 1% plus 1 T. white vinegar.  I also used 1/2c shortening and 1/2c salted butter.  They turned out slightly crispy on the edges and soft in the middle.  If your cookies are rising too much during the last few minutes of baking, take out the pan and slam it on a counter to make them fall and they turn out much more chewy instead of cakey.  I will definitely make these again.

I found this recipe because I had some buttermilk left over from a carrot cake recipe, so I did a search using it as an ingredient. Though I found these eggless cookies to taste ok, they crumbled apart too easily. I would only recommend this recipe to those who have egg allergies.

Like many others, I was out of eggs and craving peanut butter cookies so I decided to give this a try. I used margarine instead of the shortening and 1% milk soured with vinegar instead of buttermilk. No matter what I did, these cookies came out flat and hard. I tried lowering the temperature and reducing baking time between batches but still didn't get that chewy texture I was looking for. My boyfriend likes crispier cookies so he enjoyed them. Next time I'll try them with the shortening & buttermilk and hope for a better result!

These are delicious! I signed my housemate up for the peanut butter of the month club, so we had several different kinds of peanut butter. I mixed about three and also added a bit of Nutella. Even the batch I accidentally burned a bit were tasty.

This recipe is perfect!!! Add some milky way candy bar and holy smokes! I needed a PB recipe because I had heard about using PB Cookie dough and put 1/2 of a mini or fun size Milky Way in the middle of the ball, an don't flatten out the cookie. It worked and was so yummy! Best PB cookies with or without the candy bar!

I, also, had to make some significant alterations to the recipe due to the ingredients I had on hand. (3 1/3 c. flour, 1/2 c. butter, 1/2 c. applesauce, 2 c. sugar, 1/2 c. molasses, - no brown sugar in the house! - added 1 tsp. vanilla) HOWEVER, my family ate about 1/4 of the batter before I even made cookies, and by the time the last batch was out of the oven, at least half of the cookies were gone! These were by far the best PB cookies I have ever made. Perfect bit of crunch to the outside; lovely, soft, chewy inside texture. KEEPER!

Made these for my twin nephews that are allergic to soy and eggs.  The cookies came out great!  I wouldn't change anything on the recipe.  Very fast and simple (I used my Kitchen Aid to mix it up).

I halved the recipe and only substituted whole milk for buttermilk.  I wasn't expecting much, but was wonderfully surprised!  I may even use this as my go-to for gifts and save the cost of eggs.  Thanks for a great submission!

I've made this recipe 3 times now, and each time I use cashew nut butter instead of peanut butter (we have peanut allergies).  I think they turn out just right when they are not smashed down with a fork.  I rolled them in sugar before baking this last time, and added some mini chocolate chips.  Yummy!

Great cookie! I do agree the recipe needs about a 1/2 cup extra flour (or mine tend to get very thin). Also, if no buttermilk, I use milk and add about a tablespoon on lemon and let it sit for a few minutes. Or I have used plain/vanilla yogurt as well (like another review suggested). Again, great cookie.

I used my cookie press and reduced the baking time to 8 minutes. The cookies turned out beautifully and taste great! Thanks for posting the recipe. My yield was almost 200 "traditional sized" cookies.

This recipe is great for my boys who not only have an allergy to eggs but also to peanuts! I of course swapped out the peanut butter and used soynut butter in its place. This is the closest my boys have ever gotten to an authentic peanut butter cookie and it's one we will enjoy and share!

I made this last nite for some vegetarian friends. It was a hit! I added more flour because it came out too sticky, used low fat peanut butter, skipped the salt, added 2 tsp of custard powder. I baked it for 12 min until the edges were brown.

Without a doubt, these are the best peanut butter cookies!  Made 4 dozen for our school bake-sale...  Best seller!  Used 1 cup sour cream to replace buttermilk.  Cut the cooking time down to 8 minutes in convection oven.  A 1.5 inch ball makes a 3 inch cookie.  Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!

I loved these cookies and I only changed one thing I tried using sugar in the raw instead of white sugar because I like it better and when you bit down on the cookies you could taste each granule of sugar they were a huge hit at work and I will definately make them again.

YUM! I don't have any eggs, so I needed a recipe that didn't require eggs. I stumbled across this one, and I am very glad that I did. I added a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips, and wow! Absolutely delicious- I highly recommend these!

Delicious! They tasted like peanut butter shortbread cookies to me. My son and I went through a dozen as soon as he got home from school.  I didn't have any buttermilk, so I used another reviewers tip with the lemon juice and milk. I was out of eggs and wanting something sweet, these were just what I needed.  Thanks L.J.  I put a few of these in a baggie and put away in my pantry and forgot about them; 2 weeks later they still taste good.

I did not have eggs on hand and I had a craving for peanut butter cookies and this recipe was THE BEST find ever. 

I made 4 sheets of cookies with this recipe with 8-12 cookies per sheet. 

The taste is WONDERFUL. I used organic natural pb for this recipe and it turned out amazing.

Great cookie - and eggless, not that anyone realized it when eating them.  I used butter instead of shortening and 2% milk with a splash of white vinegar for the buttermilk.  Needed to bake for the full 12 minutes.  I halved the recipe and made 30 @2-1/2 inch diameter cookies.  Very easy to make and bake in less than 30 minutes.

This is a great cookie! My son allergic to eggs so I made them for him over the weekend he loved they and so did I.  I put the dough in the freezer for 20 min. before I started making any and would put it back in between sheets just to make easier to work with

Very nice recipe! I split the dough in half, added 2 heaping Tablespoons of dark chocolate cocoa powder to half of the dough. I made the cookies with a pinch of each dough, rolling them together in my hands  making a "duo" cookie - half dark choc and half peanut butter. Also to make them vegan, I used 1/2 cup of almond milk instead of buttermilk, and used Earth Balance spread instead of shortening. I added 2 pics to show how they look.

I made some changes as indicated by others, but don't think that they would impact the way the cookies turn out, except possibly for the increased flour. I used butter instead of shortening, and plain 2% milk in place of the buttermilk. I also increased the flour to 3 cups. I rolled the dough into 1" balls and put them about 2 inches apart on the baking sheet. I didn't flatten them. Baking them for 10 minutes worked perfectly for me, although the bottoms were a bit browner than I would have liked. Next time I will try the oven at 370 instead of 375. I found the dough to be fluffier than the usual cookie dough, but the cookies were great! Thanks for the recipe.

I substituted butter and milk because they were what I had on hand.  Dropped using a 1 tbsp scoop and didn't flatten them.  They were  very tasty cookies and I really liked the texture, but found them a tad too sweet, though my family will love them.  Be careful to watch these, they can be burnt very easily.

I made a half batch, and put all the dough into a 12 inch cast iron skillet, to make  one big cookie. I cooked it for 18 min at 350degrees . I also added 1 cup chocolate chips. It turned out  thick and crumbly. They are yummy, I will make these again.

These were AWESOME! I added chocolate chips and they went down a treat. Lovely consistency I'm a great fan of a crunchy cookie not a soft one and these were perfect. Will definitely make again.

This recipe made a believer out of my husband and I, did however use real butter instead of shorting and 2% milk instead of buttermilk and added a little vanilla.  I will definitely make these again. KUDOS TO YOU!

Crisp on the outside, soft on the inside! Perfect!!! I added a little vanilla just for fun. I didn't have baking soda, so I used baking powder and it worked just fine. I also subbed out the shortening for butter. Yummy!

Tastes just like "regular" peanut butter cookies and the best part, no raw egg in the dough!  I substituted natural p.b. for regular, butter for shortening, and whole milk for buttermilk. My oven is not working well, so I had to bake at a lower temperature for a little longer and I made them small.  They did not turn out flat, as a few other reviews stated, but I also did not press them down, as is traditional with p.b. cookies.  Once done, I let them rest on the baking pan for a few minutes to firm up.

These are great.  I have made them many times, and each time they turn out crisp on the outside, and soft on the inside.  I have added chocolate chips, and I have done them rolled in sugar.  If yours are coming out flat, I would check the date on your baking soda- these turn out great when the recipe is followed exactly.

I was out of most everything and made this with what I had on hand, using  coconut oil, stevia and 1/2&1/2.
When using stevia i use almost 1/4c less to avoid the stevia aftertaste.
I also didn't have Brown sugar so used teaspoon of molasses.
My better 1/2 said they were the best pb cookies he ever had!

I was low on eggs and wanted a cookie in a snow storm. I know... who's low on eggs during a snow storm, but whatever. I used butter and milk in place of the shortening and buttermilk, and it was excellent. Try it.

I looked for this recipe because we often do not have eggs in our kitchen, but we had baking supplies left from the holidays (sugar, flour, etc). I substituted 3/4 of a stick of butter for the shortening and whole organic milk for the buttermilk, and these turned out to be AMAZING! Because I don't have baking trays at the moment, I split the dough in half and cooked it spread out into two all metal skillets for about 15-20 minutes (my oven does not heat well). This allowed for just the right amount of crisp browness on the edges and bottom but moist chewy centers...plus it's fun to cut into it like little pieces if pizza or cake. Great for an ice cream sundae! Thank you so much for sharing this,recipe!!

The whole family loves this recipe. Was so impressed. I used cinnamon yogurt by Straus Family. We did not care for the cinnamon flavor so I was looking for another use and I also did not have any eggs. So I decided to try it. I also used 1/4c. of w.w. flour, so that would be 1 1/2c. of flour and 1/4c. whole wheat to equal 1 3/4 cups. I did half without chocolate chips and rolled them in cinn. sugar. Yum! Yum! So happy to have this recipe, eggs are not always on hand.

I doubled the recipe, used 2% milk instead of buttermilk, because that is what I had on hand.  Then I separated the dough, added chocolate chips to some, butterscotch chips to some, chocolate chips and walnut pieces to some, and left some plain. The kids loved them all! My daughter says that these are the best peanut butter cookies EVER!

Yum yum yum! I did have eggs in the house, but after seeing the reviews for this recipe I figured I'd give it a go. Best peanut butter cookies I've ever made! I did make a few changes: I added some vanilla and an extra 1/2 cup flour, as suggested by other reviewers, and I subbed milk with lemon juice for the buttermilk and margarine for the shortening. I added chocolate chips to half the batch, but the cookies were super yummy on their own too. I did find that 10min at 375 was about two minutes too long, especially since I like my cookies a bit underdone (after ten minutes they were quite brown), but I think that was probably my margarine. Crispy edges, soft centres, peanut buttery goodness, highly recommended!

Thank you, Thank you.  I just moved to the U.S. Virgin Islands and wanted to bake peanut butter cookies.  I discovered that I was out of eggs and decided to check the internet to see if there were any good recipes out there.  Your recipe for eggless cookies was scrumptous.  I couldn't bake them fast enough.  Our family went through three plates of 12 cookies.  However, there are 7 in our family.  I'll be saving the eggs for something else!

It's a rare day in my house when I have buttermilk but don't have eggs, but that was the situation I found myself in not too long ago when I was craving peanut butter cookies.  These are fantastic, nice rich flavor, dense and chewy texture.  I've made these several times since, even with eggs in the house.  I add an extra 1/2 cup of flour, as many have suggested, and I also throw in a generous handful of chocolate chips.  Yummy!

My aunt is allergic to eggs so I make these for her every year. They aren't as moist as cookies with eggs but they're still good and she loves them.

These cookies were easy to make with my 2-year-old and the whole family loved them! I took the suggestion of adding more flour (I used 3 cups) and I added about a teaspoon of vanilla as well. This is something that we'll definitely make again!

These were really good- I added some vanilla and semi-sweet chocolate chips, which made them excellent!

These cookies are great!  I substituted butter for shortening and whole milk for buttermilk.  I also didn't have enough flour so I added Gerber Mixed Baby Cereal.  (2 cups flour and 1/2 cup baby cereal)  So moms, if you have too much baby cereal, here's an idea for you.  My kids loved dipping them in milk!

I had no eggs at home & needed to make a quick dessert for church pot luck. They were a huge hit with everyone - kids and adults alike.  Very tasty. Thank you!

These are wonderful!  I loved making them with my 2 year old daughter. The fact that there are no eggs made me more comfortable when she (inevitably) at the dough. The cookies did puff up and expand a bit- my first batch ran into each other a little.

Very tasty.  I made just as the recipe indicated. A nice mix of crunchy on the outside and soft inside.
