This was the first time I had made tuna steaks - quite tasty!  I couldn't find kumquats so I used a small orange, sliced with the peel, to top the steaks while they were cooking.  With the fresh cilantro, it smelled wonderful while it was cooking.

This was wonderful, just be very careful not to overcook the tuna.

We're not fish lovers so I'm always looking for recipes that we enjoy.  This one will be toward the top of the list.  The tuna was moist and flavorful.  We like cilantro so that wasn't an issue at all.  I also substituted using orange.  We had leftovers and felt that it was even better the next day as it took on all the flavors and stayed moist.  Thanks for sharing this recipe

This recipe was sort of a disappointment.  Perhaps I didn't watch it too closely, but the steaks came out too dry.

I will not use this recipe again.  The cilantro over powers the fish.

I might have overcooked it, but we couldn't find anything good about this recipe. The fish had absolutely no flavor, despite following the recipe.

This recipe was wonderful  I also had to substitute an orange for the kumquats.  For those cooks who said it was dry, don't cook it so long next time.  We are not big fans of cilantro, so I cut back on the amount a little bit.
