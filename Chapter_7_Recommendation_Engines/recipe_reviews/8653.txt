I thought the recipe was very good but felt it was missing a little something. I added and changed a few things the second time around and the recipe came out great. Instead of using 8 breasts, I cut up 2 in 1" cubes. I used granny smith apples and cut those into 1/2" cubes.  I coated the cubed breasts with 1 tbs of corrander. I cooked everything in a large saute pot instead of baking . Then I replaced 1/2 a cup of the milk with coconut milk. It was delicious!

this was sooo good...although I did change a few things.  I cubed the chicken and added some diced vegetables, then poured the sauce over everything, so it was an complete meal when it was finished.  Cooked much faster too.  Also I cut the recipe in half but still used two apples and lots of curry, plus some garam masala.  It came out delicious!

This recipe is fantastic! It's in my "heavy rotation" of recipes. The only thing I modify is the amount of curry powder. Being a HUGE curry fan, I usually come close to doubling it, but the sweetness of the apples REALLY adds a special kick to it! LOVE IT!

Fantastic!  The whole family, including picky kids, loved this recipe.  I suggest doubling the sauce (butter, broth, flour, milk) as well as the curry, so that you can put it over rice.  This one is a keeper. Good job, Christine!

That was AWESOME! Ok, I made a number of changes (haven't tried it yet without the changes), but I doubt my result varied much in quality from the original recipe. I didn't bake it; I just cooked it in a large saucepan. I cubed 3 small apples and diced two medium-sized onions and sauteed them in the butter with 2 tsp minced garlic (I didn't have any fresh garlic on hand). I cut two large chicken breasts into one-inch cubes and added them to the pan. Before the chicken sealed, I added 1 1/2 tbsp curry powder and about 1 tsp garam masala. Once the chicken was sealed, I added the broth, milk and then slowly sprinkled in the flour. Finally, I added about 1 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper. I let it simmer for awhile, and it thickened a lot, so I added probably about another 1/2 cup of milk. I was also busy doing other things, so I just turned it down to low and let it simmer very lightly for about 1/2 hour or 45 minutes. I served it over basmati rice. This is definitely a keeper. Yum!

found this recipe searching for something to do with apples and chicken. really nice. i substituted a cup of coconut milk for the cup of milk and i used 1-1/2 to 2 T of curry powder. i also kept the peel on the apples, which i think helped them stay together better. i will definitely make this again.

Very good but I made some changes.  I used chicken tenders (which sped up the cooking time).  I doubled the curry powder, used plain nonfat yogurt instead of milk, added a handful of craisins, and skipped the butter (using cooking spray instead).  It was awesome!

I love this recipe! I do like to add some color to it though with diced peppers (green, red, and orange). I also add garlic, always use tart Granny Smith apples, and if you like an extra kick, like we do, be very generous with the curry powder. Served over rice, this is an excellent, healthy meal! Thanks!!

This recipe was great and easy to make.  I used cubed pork sirloin tenderloin instead of chicken.  I would use 3-4 tbsp of curry powder next time as we really like the flavour - it's something you have to experiment with according to your taste buds.

Reading the Ingredient list I knew that this recipe needed some more spices. Having said that Im still rating this a 4 bec the apples and curry played so well off eachother and I would have never thought of that. I added a teaspoon of coriander, garam masala, some cinnamon, a jalapeno and some red peppers. I cooked the chicken than added it to the sauce later. (All in a skillet) I did crave more of the apple taste so next time I will dice the apples larger and add one more or maybe add some apple juice. Also I think golden rasins would go nicely in this. Im so glad I tried this. thx

Baked this dish for a sunday company meal and served it with plain bulgur; It was well appreciated. I only made a few changes: I substitued coconut milk for the milk, added 1-3/4 tablespoon curry instead of 1 and mixed in about 1/3 cup dried apple. I would recommand to prepare the sauce in a large saucepan or a pot instead of in a skillet. Will make it again.

Delish! I gave this one 5 stars because it was so easy, quick, and tasty. I didn't have any good curry powder on hand so I replaced it with 1 Tbsp of garam masala, plus a couple shakes of cinnamon & nutmeg. Also, instead of baking the chicken pieces whole in the sauce, I just cut up the raw chicken and added it to the saucepan right after the onions, and sauteed them together in the butter, adding the apples soon after. In other words, everything in one pot :-)  I feel like the butter and most of the flour could be left out and it would be just as tasty, with only marginal change to the texture. I left everything in this time though, because I knew my sweetie would like it :-)  We ate it with brown rice and a side of frozen peas. Four thumbs up! :-)

This was good but I didn't make near the same amount of chicken to go in the sauce.  I can't imagine 8 breasts with the amount of of sauce this calls for.  I doubled the curry and cut the chicken breast into chunks so that it could just be cooked in the pan with the sauce.  I liked the apple's sweetness and will include it in all of my curry dishes from now on.

This is a great recipe. SO easy to whip up a quick family meal! I read other reviews and follwed the adivce to double the curry powder. I also used a bit of corn starch in place of the flour. I didn't heat the chicken broth either. Oh and lastly... I made the curry sauce and threw in the raw chicken...simmered on the stove for about 30-45 on low. I will make this again! YUM.

SO GOOD.  this dish was really simple to prepare, is healthy and tasted incredible.  I of course did make some changes.  I added probably about 2 Tbs of curry, some garam masala, garlic, and a bit more cayenne.  I used only 2 chicken breasts that i cubed and added broccoli, bell pepper, carrots, and tomatoes.  Instead of running the oven for an hour i put it in a pan on the stove for about 30 minutes on low.  I will definitely make this again!

Very good and easy recipe! Used 2 chicken breasts but same amount of sauce. Could use a little more chicken though. Cooked everything in skillet: chicken first, set aside, then add onions and apples, then curry powder and liquids, then add chicken back in. Having coconut milk on hand to use instead of regular milk would have added a nice touch. Served with rice, delicious!

Great recipe.  I did add more curry powder than originally called for, and I used coconut milk instead of regular milk, I also cubed the meat and sauted the chicken, apple, and onion all together.  Awesome flavor!

This has become my go-to chicken curry recipe - love it - you can add several things, such as peas, green peppers, etc - I do cut back on the onion, using only one small rather than two.

This recipe is wonderful if you like a very mild curry flavor. I tripled the curry powder and added 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper to spice it up and then I loved it. The sweet offsets the spice and makes for a delightful combination of flavors.

I love curry, and had a very strange array of things in the house, so I gave this a whirl.  I didn't have onion, so mine was onionless, and I only had about a tsp curry powder, which I think made it a little too sweet and bland.  I would definitely use onion and more curry powder - it needs it!  Also, I did mine entirely skillet-style, chopping 2 chicken breasts into chunks and sauteing it with the apple before adding the seasonings and liquid.  And per others' suggestions, I did some other add-ins.  I threw in about 1/2 c raisins, and instead of coconut milk (didn't have any), I tossed in about 1/2 c flaked coconut.  It made it a very sweet curry - almost too much so.  In the end, it was well-recieved, but not enough so that I will make it again soon, unless I am in a pinch again.

YUM!  I used half and half in place of the milk, only because I had it in the refrigerator, and that seemed to make the sauce extra creamy and special.  My curry was a bit bland, so the next time I am out shopping, I will pick up a curry with more "heat".  Served this over rice - - that way the dish became curry chicken AND curry rice!

WOW!  This was SO good.  I used one can of coconut milk and one can of broth.  I used 1 1/2 TBS of curry and could have definitely used more (I ran out).  Used 6 breasts which we cut into bite-sized pieces.  The proportion of chicken/sauce was just right.  Served with mashed potatoes (b/c we had eaten rice the two nights before I served this) and it ROCKED!    I will serve w/mashed again for sure.  Served with broccoli on side.  Wonderful easy dish.

I'm not sure why everyone is giving this 4 and 5 stars. I thought it was bland. It did not have enough flavor, I even used curry powder from the international market which is stronger than regular grocery store curry.

It seems an odd mixture, but this is SO good! For picky onion eaters, this recipe uses ample amounts of onion without really tasting it at all. Good!

This was really good. I kept all the ingredients the same but I made it faster and easier by using canned chopped chicken breast. I made the sauce in the pan and then stirred in the chicken breast until it was heated through. I scaled the recipe back to 1 serving and used (1) 12.5ounce can of chicken, which actually made enough to serve two people over rice. (Or, one really hungry guy...as was the case when my husband ate all of it :) By using prepared chicken breast, this makes a really yummy and easy and fast weeknight meal!

Used: Pink Lady Apples and Jamaican Curry
Added: 5 cloves of garlic and 1 1/2 Tablespoons MORE Curry

APPLE AND CURRY WORK SO WELL TOGETHER! This dish was not only easy but so delicious. I like spicy so I added more curry but it still didnt come out too spicy.

I did this recipe in the crockpot and it turned out fabulous--just added all the ingredients in the pot and set for low for 7 hours.  Chicken was very moist and flavorful.  I realized after I started making this that i had no curry powder....big oops, but I used tumeric and other spices, used coconut milk instead of milk, and it still tasted like curry.   Just a few things I tried for those looking to add veggies-- I added cubed potatoes to the crock pot (my favorite curry dishes have potatoes) and served over sticky rice and steamed broccoli.  I wasn't sure how it would be with broccoli, but I was really surprised how nice the flavors were together!   Loved the recipe, thanks!

This was so-so. I made it tonight and had to make many changes for it not to be bland. Added another tblsp of curry powder, 2 cloves of crushed garlic, more chicken broth, and 1 tblsp of hot chili sauce. Also I used coconut milk instead of regular. To be honest, I don't think this will be made again. It just wasn't as dynamic as I think curry should be. My British boyfriend said it was meh. Edible, but not a winner. Sorry!

I loved this recipe, but did change it a smidge.  I used 3 tablespoons of curry instead of just 1.  I also used a can of coconut milk plus the cup of milk  to make it more saucy.  I cooked this in a skillet with cubed chicken breast.  It turned out great!  I've been looking for a curry recipe just like this for a long time, thank you!

Delicious and EASY. I used granny smith apples and whole wheat flour. I also used alot more curry seasoning (garam masala specifically) and seasoned the breasts with the curry, ginger, garlic and onion, as well as the salt and pepper. I also took another reviews advice and made a bit more of the sauce so there would be extra to go over basmati rice as well....highly recommended!

I'm sure it doesn't taste the same, but since I have to cook gluten-free and casein-free for my autistic daughter (see my blog on the autism diet on this website), I replaced the butter with spray vegetable oil and replaced the milk with apple juice, since I was using apples anyway.  To cover up all the fruity flavor I used a tomato flavored chicken boullion instead of the chicken broth.

Excellent flavor, easy to make.  I had to serve more people than I had chicken breasts, so I cut them up into bite-size pieces and sauteed them in the pan; then added the chicken to the curry mixture and simmered in the pan for about 20 minutes instead of baking.  I served over rice that I cooked in chicken broth and added a bit of curry to.  Turned out great!

Delicious curry! I also diced the chicken and cooked the entire dish on the stovetop. Next time I'll try Granny Smith apples as another reviewer suggested. I used Gala apples this time and threw in a handful of raisins as well. Also I used chicken stock instead of broth to reduce the salt and soy instead of regular milk. Served over couscous with chopped peanuts and coconut as toppings. Made an easy meal that looked like I'd really fussed... Thank you ChristyJ!

Because of a recent trip to a local orchard, I have an abundance of delicious apples.  They are a part of every meal!  :)  I was already a fan of chicken curry, but this brought that love to a whole new level!  Extremely easy, and extremely yummy!  I pan-flashed the chicken first (outsides cooked, insides pink) and cubed it, and I also used 1/2 cup of coconut milk and 1/2 cup of milk instead of all plain milk.  Wonderful!  Will DEFINITELY use again!

This was my first curry and sooo good.  My hubby loved it and even my picky 4 year old thought it was yummy.  After reading some other reviews I made the following changes:  Reduced the chicken to 6 breast and cubed them.  Doubled the sauce.  Didn't have any chicken broth so used one can of cream of chicken and one can of water.  Doubled the curry and added a bit of cinnamon, too.  Also threw in a handful of raisins and added a bit more apples.  Saute'ed the apple first then added spices and liquids until boiling.  Then added cubed chicken to the mixture and cooked on stovetop for about 30 minutes while my riced cooked.  Served over rice and with an indian chapati flatbread that I found on this site.  It was all so authentic and delicious tasting!  Will definitely make this many more times.

This was an absolutely awesome curry. I tip my hat off to you, sir/mame. I want to say that I modified the recipe a bit, however. I added a lot of turmeric and gram marsala as well as some cinnamon. Also, instead of adding milk I added half coconut milk and half yogurt.  As i slow cooked everything I found it to be getting to thick so I added milk a few times to keep it liquid. Again, thank you so much. This is one of the best things I ever made and it was so simple.

This was a VERY easy, very delicious recipe! The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that I gave it a bit of tweaking and while it was very GOOD, it's not SO good that I'll be getting cravings or dreaming about it. But I will *definitely* make this again! The three changes I made were: 1) I used half coconut milk for the milk measurement. 2) I added masala spice 3) I added golden raisins to the mixture(at about 20 minutes into the baking process). This last one made ALL the difference; my significant other said this wouldn't be HALF as good without those golden raisins (they go VERY well with curry; I highly recommend them). I served it with coconut rice and they go very well together. A GREAT dish for busy families too!

I love this recipe! I do modify it a little, but even the base recipe is great.  As some other reviewers noted the recipe works even better when you use coconut milk in place of the regular milk.  If you're not concerned about calories, using the whole can of coconut milk to replace the milk and  the chicken broth is good.  Also, I use lots of curry powder.

I did feel like it was missing something...something to really give it that special something but I will keep trying to perfect it. But overall, great. Just added something for color: red, orange, and green peppers. Also fresh garlic.

This was a little bland, so adding a good bit of salt of salt is necessary.  Or, if you don't like the idea of consuming a lot of salt, add more apple for sweetness and more onion for flavor.  I also think garlic would be good in this.  It could've used a little more curry powder.  Produced very moist chicken and was fairly easy to make.  My parents did not like this, but I thought it was a welcome change to plain chicken.  Healthy, too!

Even with doubling the amount of curry powder, using coconut milk instead of regular milk, and adding some garam masala, it just wasn't flavorful enough. It's not a bad dish at all, but it needs a little something and I haven't quite figured out what that is yet. My family wasn't really looking for the curry to be hot, just to have a deeper flavor and a stronger spice combination.

I love this recipe and so easy! I decreased the amount of chicken to only 4 pieces, used boneless skinless thighs CUT UP instead of breasts (they are cheaper), doubled the amount of curry and served over steamed jasmine rice..yummy. By decreasing the amount of chicken it made it more saucy, which tasted great and soaked up the rice. This tasted like a recipe from a Thai or Indian restaurant! Great! You could also provide a little color by adding some chopped green onion

We enjoyed this. I added some powdered peanut butter and next time I think I'll use coconut milk and a handful of chopped raisins or maybe a little chutney.  A very good basic recipe and the sauce was nice.  I made the full recipe with only three cubed chicken breasts.  Served with rice and green beans.  I will make this again.

This just didn't do it for us. I think the apples didn't mesh well with the rest of it. It needed something else to it; pretty much just tasted like plain curry/bland.

This was pretty good, per other reviewers, I added more curry powder than was originally called for.  Which was a good move.  I also put in some carrots and potatoes (What is curry without carrots and potatoes) The apples were pretty good, but think I put too many in...

Great recipe!  Make sure to use granny smith or other sour apple.  The more sour the better.  Also, take the advice of others and add more spices.  I will definitely make this again though.

I would give this three stars, but my husband loved it, so I compromised with four stars.  I used two tablespoons of curry and was still disappointed that it didn't have more curry flavor.  I found it a little bland.  I'll try it again with a few modifications.  I also used cut up turkey, to make it easier to eat over some cous cous.

Loved it. I doubled the amount of sauce, though. Next time I think I'll cube the chicken to make it easier to serve over rice.

Great and EASY recipe! The apples give the curry a unique kick to the flavor. Instead of the milk I switched it with coconut milk to give a thicker, creamer texture and flavor; used chicken tenderloins and cooked them a little before throwin into the curry sauce. I did not bake but cook on stove top and let everything bubble and fuse together like a stew. Delicious! Put together with black Asian wild rice and Naan! Mmm...Mmm...

This meal was fantastic! I reduce the amount of curry to 1 1/2 teaspoons since this is my families least favorite spice.  I made the entire meal ahead of time and froze it for a weeknight meal.  It tasted great and was so easy to reheat.  Next time I am going to double the sauce to freeze half for a future meal.

This was sooooo good!  I did make a couple minor changes though. (i had a hungry 4 year old and needed it to be done faster!)  I first cut up the chicken breasts (4 of them) and sauted them in olive oil and then reserved them on a plate tented with tin foil. Then i cooked the onion and apple as said in the recipes and made the sauce and added the chicken at the very end to re-heat it.  I topped it with some chopped cashews and it was GREAT!!

This recipe is outstanding. It is simple to make and requires only a handful of ingredients.  Best of all it is packed with a "punch" of great flavor.  Also, there is plenty of room to add personal flair; such as cinnamon, raisins, and different type of milks.  It will become a staple recipe; thanks!

This was my first time making curry and I was very impressed. Four stars only because I used this a base recipe. I read other's suggestions and doubled both the 'soup' and curry powder. I also used coconut milk instead of milk. I cooked it with chicken tenderloins- they were a little bland and I think next time i'll cube them. Also I threw in a dash of red pepper for spice. The apples added a great flavor- kind of tangy! I used Granny Smith. Next time I'm going to throw in cooked potatoes to replicate the curry I eat at my favorite Thai restaurant. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

This was good. It tasted like I was putting the top rated (on this site) Mulligatawny soup on rice. It has the exact same flavor. It is a little bit bland....maybe some cumin would help with this?

Everyone really liked this dish and it couldn't have been easier to make. I subbed the milk for coconut milk and chunked the chicken into 1" pieces to speed up baking time. Sauce-to-chicken ratio was perfect using 4 large breasts. Was a bit too sweet for my taste, but like I said, a hit at the dinner for 8.

I used coconut milk rather than milk, and added a few more spices. I also doubled the amount of curry. I thought the dish was fine, but my boyfriend said he probably would not like for me to make it again. He said it was fine, but with so many great recipes out there, why bother to repeat average?

This recipe is amazing! I've made it using skinless thighs, but decided last night to dice up chicken breasts and add the cubes to the apples and onions. I do like some others and use coconut milk, though that's really the only change I make. The whole family loves it!

My husband and I thought this recipe was very flavorful!  To cut down on fat, I only used 1 Tbsp of butter and used skim milk...still tasted great.  Also, I just used a can of chicken broth instead of measuring out a cup.  This made for more liquid for the sauce.  As another reviewer recommended, I cut the chicken into chunks (only used 4 chicken breasts) before cooking.  Thanks for a tasty recipe!

This was a great recipe although I did change some things & I would make more changes next time I make it. I used coconut oil instead of butter cause it's healthier. I used Almond milk instead of milk cause I'm allergic to milk. I halved the recipe but left the same amount of curry in it. It still needed more curry. I also think the curry I bought was not spicy enough. I will add another apple next time cause I could hardly taste the one I added. I will definately do this recipe again but with extra curry & extra apple. Thanks for posting it! I hope you don't feel that I butchered your recipe!

Wonderful Recipe. First time I made curry and it was so easy and good. I didn't have any chicken and used pork chops, and it turned out wonderful. I did double the sauce and added some heat(chili sauce), because the apples made it sweet. Sweet and spicy!!

This was quite tasty. I used coconut milk and more curry. I also baked it over a bed of raw rice and added water. The flavors seeped into the rice. I only didnt really taste a distinct apple flavor.

This was good.  It tasted just like the Mulligatawny soup I make!  I love that soup so the flavour in a non-soup dish was just as yummy.  Served with rice noodles it was just great!  & it was easy too!

Though the aroma of the ingredients combined smelled good, the sauce was too bland.  I reused the sauce on the second day, after it had thickened.  I added some cayenne pepper and ground ginger to the chicken and sauce before reheating, to give the chicken some potency.  Then I served it all over basmati rice.

I thought this was just ok and most likely will not make it again.  If I do it again I will add more (1 cup) rasins and use at least 2 T curry powder.  The rasins were my favorite part because they added a little sweetness which I really liked

A big success.  I used chicken for two people although made the full quantity of sauce.  I added a little garlic to the sauce as well as a handful of raisins which seemed to work nicely.  Will definately be making it again.

This was sooooo good, and my husband said so after his first bite (he almost never comments on my cooking). I used half the chicken called for, but I used the same amount of sauce and served it over rice. I used 1.5-2T curry and substituted lite coconut milk for the milk. Yuuuum-yum!

i made this for some extended family members at a very casual pseudo dinner party, and we all loved it. i did make a substantial change, though: i did the whole thing on the stovetop, sauteing the chicken in bite-sized pieces. this was my first experience with curry, as i don't enjoy spicy-hot foods, and had been having a hard time finding recipes that didn't call for added cayenne, etc. this was perfect, and i'll definitely be making it again!

This was a good recipe but next time I will make more of the curry/apple dressing to go with it.  Chicken still tasted good though.

I made this last night- it was very good but I think next time I make it I am going to put more curry powder in it.
Also I found out I was out of flour after I started making it- so I substituted corn starch- it thinkened quite nicely.

Pretty good,  although mine didn't thicken right.  However,  I am sure that was entirely my fault,  as I can never get a flour-thickened sauce right for some reason. The flavor was excellent.

Very tasty.  It actually was more flavorful as a leftover dish than when it was first prepared.  I felt like it needed more curry at first, but once it had been in the freezer for a little bit, it was wonderful.

This recipe was delicious! My children and husband devoured it. I stuck to the recipe except I used rice milk because that's what I had and served it over brown rice. The flavors are subtle and chicken extremely tender. It's now added to the rotation.

This was really yummy--though I tweaked it some.  I added carrots and green pepper just to up the veggie intake, added a few cloves of garlic and also 2 Tb of mango ginger chutney.  It was REALLY yummy.  It still seemed really runny and I didn't want to overcook, so I added a couple TB of flour to thicken the sauce.  Yummy though.

Unfortunately, this one was a little bland.  I did what another reviewer suggested and used coconut milk instead of milk (hoping it would add more flavor).  I also added more curry, cubed the chicken and put it all together.  Maybe I sauteed the apples too long - they became soft and flavorless.  I need to try this again with some changes to add flavor b/c I love apples and curry.

This recipe is excellent!  It has a great flavor and was easy to make.  I cut my chicken into bite size chunks (just personal preference).  I used my food processor to cut the apple and onion.  Also, I increased the curry to 2 T because we love it!  I served this to company and even the kids liked it.  Then I made it again in the crock pot and took it to a potluck, and it was just as good as in the oven only a little more runny.  Served it with Basmati rice and Naan bread both times.

Wow! Made this last night for dinner it was great! Whole family loved it. I did take the advice of some and cubed the meat. I actully used a combo of pork and chicken. I also seasoned the meat with salt & pepper and cumin. I doubled the sauce and served over Jasmine rice. This ones is a keeper!

This was quite tasty, but I feel like it's missing something.  I used 1 3/4 tbls of curry powder and will use more next time.  I didn't have coconut milk on hand but I will Definitely be using that in the next batch.  I will also use bigger pieces of apple in order to get more of that flavor - I feel like with the finely chopped, a lot of the juice flavor is lost in the cooking - maybe I'll even add some apple juice as another reviewer mentioned.  I had three large breasts and cooked them for 50 minutes at 350 (I checked with a thermo at 40 and they still were not at 165).  I'm looking forward to making this again with the above changes.  I also made some of the Naan on this site which made for a great side for this dish.

This is a great recipe which I used for a dinner I hosted awhile back.  I made a few modifications though.  I added green onion, red and green bell pepper, garlic, raisins, and coconut milk and let the chicken bake.  Also, I discovered that it's quick and easy to cook this on a stove top skillet, covered for 15-20 minutes if you're only cooking a few chicken breasts (for 1-3).  Just pour the sauce over the chicken and let it simmer.

Excellent.  Followed recipe exactly first time.  Second time, added raisins and used olive oil instead of butter.  I also used a little more curry and used skim milk.  Equally as delicious.

Wonderful!  My son said it was like eating in an Indian restaurant.  I used milk to keep down the calories but I could see how using coconut milk would add to the richness of an already superb recipe....perhaps for company.  (I added fresh garlic and peas.)

Delicious!  I did substitute a can of coconut milk for the milk and added 6 cloves of minced garlic (we love garlic) and used a whole cut up chicken instead of the breasts and it was fabulous.

Very Good! I made this pretty much according to directions. I increased the curry by about 3/4 TBS and I cubed the chicken.  The whole family loved it. My husband and I added chili paste to ours and it gave it great kick! Served with couscous and naan. Yum!

Very good! I ended up being short on time so I sliced the chicken, lightly pan fried it until cooked then put the chicken aside. I made the sauce as directed but added the chicken and continued cooking until it was thick.

This tasted pretty good. Very bland though. Not really what I was hoping for, but over all good. I think with a little tweaking it could be really tasty.

Used this for my Christmas Turkey leftovers.  I included cut up carrots and fresh diced green beans (good color).  This was a very simple, easy recipe--and as it is such a contrast from our Christmas dinner, I think I will use it for our turkey leftovers each  year. (Cooked on stove top)

Wow.  Slightly sweet yet spicy (with my additions) and an absolutely great way to use leftover cooked chicken.  I simply simmered the chicken pieces in the sauce, but I'd like to try baking it, too.  I did add quite a bit more curry, also cumin and coriander as well as some generous shakes of hot pepper sauce.  Using red onion in the curry and fresh cilantro as a garnish gave it plenty of color and I thought made for a nice presentation.  Nice served over brown rice.

I really liked the base of this recipe, but like others it wasn't QUITE the flavor I look for in Indian food. We added about a 1/2 teaspoonful each of garam masala and cumin. I also might try it with applesauce... I don't know how that will go, but it was a pain to cut the apples so small AND keep them from oxidizing before I put them in with the onion.

Very easy, and tasty. I did add some diced green peppers to the onions and apple. It added some color and contrast. My teenage daughter like it as well.

This ended up being great, but I did make some changes. I used chicken tenderloins, seasoned them with poultry seasoning and sauteed them in cooking spray. I removed the chicken and made the sauce in the same pan according to the recipe, then returned the chicken to the pan and simmered until done. But after tasting, I thought the dish was way too bland. So I added more curry, about a quarter cup of golden raisins, and 2 teaspoons of brown sugar. Served over couscous - delicious!

Once I added the curry to the sauteed apples and onions, I knew this was going to be good -- the smell was divine! I sauteed and combined everything in a cast iron pan, then simply added the cubed chicken breasts to the pan and put it right in the oven. This will be a recipe I know I'll enjoy 'playing around with.'

Absolutely yummy - THANK YOU. I too doubled the sauce ingredients so lots of it - flour, milk (used coconut milk) and chicken broth. I also diced chicken into inch (ish) squares and cooked completely on stove top. I added 3 tbsp of medium curry powder to give a bit of a kick, would take to 2 if giving to the children. This is really lovely and will def being creating again!

I thought this recipe was a little bland. Next time I would definitely use coconut milk instead of regular per other reviews suggestions and a few other recommended additions.

This was Super Easy & Super Yummy!  I thought that it was going to be too sweet & apple flavored - but is wasn't. I had a great flavor.  I chose to cook mine on the stove top by cubing the chicken & cooking it first - then adding the other ingredients. To my dismay, I only had about 1 tablespoon of curry powder left so I added a few spices to compensate: turmeric, ginger & chili powder. It was a nice dish for grey, gloomy winter weather - but not too heavy.  Would go great with a salad in the warmer months.  Yum-Yum!

Though I did lack the essential ingredient here -- curry powder -- the recipe worked out just wonderfully using paprika, cayenne pepper powder, Lawrey's seasoned salt, and black pepper in its stead. It came out with just the right amount of kick to it, which was balanced by the other ingredients in the recipe, namely the apple and onion in the sauce.

This was my first time making anything with curry and it turned out really great! My only complaint is that is lacked a little flavor (perhaps salt) and I couldn't taste the apples once I baked it, but the flavor of the curry (used more than the recipe called for) was warm  and good. My boyfriend had two helpings, so it was an overall success! I would suggest serving over basmati rice.

This was a definite success!!! My husband loved it, and so did I. My 2 year old is too picky for it though. But it's definitely a great EASY chicken curry recipe. Loved it! 2009

Edit: 8 years later, it’s still a family favorite!

My husband and I loved this recipe! I made it with only 2 chicken breast so I had alot of apple/onion sauce for my coconut rice I made with it! It was just enough curry to give the right bite. Another quick meal to put on my make again list. Thanks

Very good dish! This was the first time I've cooked with curry and it will definitely be added to the rotation!

I added some red pepper flakes and paprika for some extra flavor and a little bit of spice.

I served it with rice. I put a chicken bullion cube in the water along with some cumin, brought it to a boil and then added white rice. Very tasty!

This is one of my all time favourite recipes.  I make it exactly as described but I usually add more apples and onion than the recipe calls for.  They're the best part!  I serve this with basmati rice and use some of the sauce to pour over the rice and chicken.

I liked this recipe..I had three large chicken breasts (which I seared prior to placing in baking pan), to the exact amt. of sauce from the recipe...I added raisins and about 1/2 cup extra apple and one potato cubed , served this over a small bed of rice with a side of pineapple...(the latter was the perfect compliment)...DEFINITELY needed an extra tablespoon of curry, (which I will add next time).  Great comfort food.

This recipe was simple but full of flavor.  We used chicken with skin still on it for moistness which the rich apple butter complimented well.  I had leftover apple butter since we only baked two breasts.  So I froze it because I'll definitely be making this again.

Very good and easy! I recommend, like others, to double the sauce. It's great over rice. I used 5-oz portions of chicken breast and they cooked in about 25 minutes....

I thought this was good/average. It seemed a bit on the bland side, even with the red pepper spice added. Probably won't make again, but enjoyed it for what it was.

I combined many of the tips here and lightly seared 4 chicken breast (pieces) before placing it in the pan. I added 1 cup raisins as well as 2 Tbsp curry. Most importantly, I cooked it for 1.5 hrs - the chicken was dry after only 45 mins. YUMMY !!!

4 stars instead of 5 because it I loved it but my husband didn't. I used olive oil instead of butter and 2 apples. Will probably make again, the flavors really compliment one another. I served over couscous, mmmmm.

I couldn't eat this it was so bland.  My onions had no bite.  The sauce was a flavorless yellow mush.  Cooking boneless breasts for 50 minutes resulted in very dry chicken.  I won't try this one again.

Tasty. Your house will smell like curry for a couple days.  I used a heart smart butter and skim milk and it still turned out great.  I made this with bulgur stuffing from this site.  My husband said they need to always be made together.  Both recipes were a hit.

Fantastic with Chicken....but even better over pork chops!  I used coconut milk instead of regular and doubled the curry to make it spicy.  I prefer using granny smith apples.  Serve it over rice.

I made this recipe for my family and it was enjoyed by all. However, next time I will probably reduce the amount of chicken broth and/or milk b/c the sauce was a little runny. It did thicken after standing for a little while but I will reduce it anyway. I also like a stronger curry flavor in mine so I added a whole bunch of extra curry.

Delicate, flavorful and creative fall dish, made it with apples picked ourselves. If I make it again I may consider adding cashews for a little extra texture, flavor and something to contrast with sweetness of the apples, and maybe even a little cream and some extra spice.

My family loved this. I tripled the curry powder and doubled the flour, milk and broth to make it extra saucy and flavorful, and served it over cauliflower rice with a fruit salad on the side.

I loved this recipe for its simplicity. I added turmeric and a bit of cumin.   I make it plain without adding the chicken. I use it over left over pork or chicken or vegetables served with basmati rice it is great.  Also freezes well if done without meat.  Use it time you want to zip up a humdrum weeknight meal

Rarely do I comment on a recipe but this one is simple and delicious. It will now be in my regular rotation. I changed a couple things... used thinly sliced turkey breast,  madras curry powder and more apple than called for. I like the idea of using yogurt instead of milk to add a bit of thickness and tang to the sauce next time.

This recipe was very good but we thought it was a little bland.  So when I made it again I increased the curry powder,  added garlic and cayenne powder for some heat.  I also used coconut milk instead of regular milk.  I did cut the chicken breast into strips and cooked in the sauce on the stove top.  We loved it!

I double the amount of curry powder and I always use chicken stock paste to make my own broth so I also double the amount of paste per 8oz of water.  It always comes out bursting with flavor.  I also set the oven timer and let it cook for 30 minutes and then I shut the oven off and let it sit another 15 - 20 minutes

This came out okay but I agree with other reviewers that something was missing. I used 1 lb chicken and 1 apple and the apple was actually hard to find. I also added 1 red bell pepper. I substituted ghee for butter. I am not a big fan of flour as a thickening agent. I think it masked some of the flavor. If I would do this again I would not use flour (substitute corn starch if needed) and I would use coconut milk instead of milk.

This is my favorite simple curry.  I use coconut milk in place of the regular milk.  I like to garnish with chopped almonds or cashews and chopped cilantro and serve with nann and basmati rice.  This is an easy go-to dish and very comforting.

Thought this was a great easy tasty curry.
I was wanting to use my fallen apples, thes sauce was lovely , I added more curry powder and some Garam Marsala.
I thought it reminded me a bit of the Chinese curry you get from a take away, it was quite yellow and a thick sauce.
I will make this again.

I followed the recipe except for baking.  I was short on time and used frozen chicken tenders simmered in the sauce till cooked through.  It worked beautifully and cut the cooking time in half. Served it over brown rice.  It was a hit with the whole family.

I love this recipe. I do do a few tweaks to the recipe as I had found it somewhere else and followed that but its roughly the same as here. I only exchange regular milk for coconut milk which gives it a way better flavor and is actually traditionally done that way and I make a medley of uncooked vegetables which I lay on the bottom of the dish, then layer the chicken on top and then layer more veggies on top of the chicken. Then finally I pour the sauce over everything, pop it into the oven and yummyness an hour later.

My husband really enjoyed this recipe. I did make changes to it, to use things that we had on hand. I used a heaping tablespoon, maybe double the amount.  I cut down the chicken broth to 2/3 of a cup and used a 1/3 cup of coconut water (left over). I added a can of cream of mushroom soup that had been open by accident and had been siitting in the refridge (undiluted) to the liquids before adding. Not only  did I salt & pepper the chicken breat, but I also rub parprika on them. If you like raisins you can add a few for the last few minutes of cooking.

My husband and I liked this.  I used 1.5 tbsp of curry, and cubed the chx, then sprinkled some pepper and a very imprecise homemade version of garam masala over it.  There was more than enough sauce for 6 servings of rice.

This was great. I want to give it 4 1/2 stars because its missing just a little something...a little heat maybe?...I'll have to play, but it is definitely closer to 5 than 4. The only changes I made were to saute in olive oil instead of butter, to use onion powder instead of onions (we don't like them), and to use coconut milk (in the can not the kind you drink) instead of regular milk to give it a more authentic Thai flavor. I followed other reviewers suggestions and used 3 cut up chicken breasts. I sauteed the sauce first and then set it aside and sauteed the chicken in the residue in the pan then added back the sauce once the chicken was done. I also left the skin on the apples which I think was better as it retained more of the apple flavor this way and certainly cut down on the prep time. Originally I left out the salt and pepper but we ended up adding it at the table so I wouldn't leave it out.  Served over brown rice, the whole family loved it and I don't generally like curry, the coconut milk evened it out very nicely! Thanks for the recipe!

Making the full recipe (for 7) is great if you use 2 full, or four half chicken breasts!

really good for how easy it was! my changes were: 2 chicken breasts, 1/2 of all other ingredients, 1 T. curry powder, about 1 T cornstarch.  Cooked in a crock pot for 6 hours with minimal stirring. be sure the liquid covers chicken when starting in crock pot (I had to use 1 Cup coconut milk and 1/2 Cup broth)

I absolutely loved this.  So tasty. I did use coconut milk tho in place of regular milk.
