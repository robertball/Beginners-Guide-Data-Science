My husband is always bringing home wild game and waiting in eager anticipation for me to come up with some magical way to prepare it!  This is absolutely the best recipe I have found for goose breast!  He was pleasantly surprised with this dish and said it was better than he thought it would be.  The sauce complimented the meat perfectly and the only ingredient I lacked was the caraway...it was great without it.  I don't know if this makes a difference or not but my husband insists on soaking the goose breast in milk for a couple days and then juice (apple, cranraspberry, etc.) for a day or two.  He says it removes the gamey taste. Thanks for a great, easy recipe. We will definately use again!

We make wild goose with this glaze all the time.  It's easy and it's good.  If you don't like gamey meat, you probably aren't going to like gamey meat with this glaze.  The glaze compliments the flavor, rather than over powers it.  I never pay attention to the length of time we cook it, but just check on it occationally.  But don't let it dry out!

Really a nice recipe for wild goose.  All three of my children gobbled it up!  It didn't overpower the meat but did a nice job adding flavor!

This recipe was way too tangy to be mixed with the gamey quality of the goose, and it didn't make it tender at all.  Also, it took closer to an hour to cook, not 30 minutes.  I won't be making this again.

Delicious!! Our husband had a very successful first goose hunt and we were unsure of what to do with the meat. I was a bit leery that it might be too gamey but it was delicious! Our 15 month old ate a full adult portion and my FIL requested me to make this for him to take to the boys on their next hunting trip. I didn't change a thing and it was perfect. Thank you!

it might be that I just don't like goose, but I thought it was not tender AT ALL it was tough and leathery, however I had never had goose before this, my husband went out killing geese and I felt I had to vindicate him by cooking his kill, but no it was not good.  I am not looking forward to goose hunting season.

We absolutely loved this recipe.  The orange glaze was a perfect compliment to the taste of the fresh goose breast.

This recipe was excellent.  We marinated the goose breasts over night in orange juice to reduce the gamey taste.  Cooking time was closer to 1 hour.  We will definitely be serving this dish again!

I don't know that it was glazed, but it definitely added a sweet orange flavor to the meat.  If you don't like goose, you won't like this recipe.  DO NOT overcook goose.  It makes the meat taste like liver.  At a half hour the meat was like a medium rare steak.  Next time I make it I'm going to add a little more brown sugar.  My wife refuses to eat wild game, but the one of my kids that likes food and the neighbors loved it.

This just didn't work for us. I don't like goose anyway, but my husband had one in the freezer from NoDak and I wanted to try something that would work. He didn't like the orangey taste, and I didn't like it so dry and untender.

Really delicious. Used recipe as stated but doubled brown sugar and even found some vermouth at the back of the liquor cabinet!!  LOL  Kids loved it. Soaked breasts for 3 days prior with salt and milk. No game flavor at all.  Breasts were about  1  1/2 in thick and 30 min. at 350 worked out fine (165 internal) It may seem not done because meat was dark red in middle but it was warm and very tender. I marinated every 10 min. I would not overcook or will dry out (meat  is very lean). I did some searching prior and 165 internal temp was on the higher side of recommended. Loved it!!

Hi, I was looking for a new recipe for elk. When I found this one, Danelle and I decided we'd give it a go. Absolutely delicious!! The orange glaze enhanced the elk steak perfectly. We are very happy with this recipe and will definitely use it more. Thank you.

this was my first try at cooking goose. and if i were to make it again, i would cook it in a dish with a lid. Keep the moisture in! and the 30 minutes at 350 would be 30 minutes on 400... because it takes more than 350 degrees. my goose (steak) tasted really good with the glaze though. my wife was game for the goose until it was cooked. then she chickened out. pun intended.

Omg!  This recipe is awesome.   I read a few of the negative reviews and adjusted.    Receipt does need more like 50 min. At 350 and let set on no heat for 10min.   Second to prevent the leather taste you need to know how clean your game.   Every bit of silver skin needs to be removed  from breast and breast should be leached in ice water for about 3days changing water daily until water is no longer bloody.   The only thing we did was double amount of brown sugar.   If done right The end result should be a orange beef flavor

The flavor in this recipe was amazing. The glaze didn't overpower the bird, but every bite definitely had a nice citrusy flavor. It took significantly longer than the recipe time indicated to cook (I used two very large breasts), and it wasn't notably juicy and tender. I basted it approximately every 10 minutes. It was excellent and I will definitely use this recipe again should I come into some more goose in the future.

I am a seasoned hunter who enjoys game meat, and my wife is a chef at a well-known restaurant.  This recipe is quite flavourful and goes well with game meat.  When cooking goose, one needs to think of cooking beef.  If it is cooked to well-done, then it will be tough and leathery.  Goose, like a good steak, should always be cooked to rare or medium rare.  The original recipe calls for a 30 minute cook time, where as others commenting on this recipe have called for an internal temperature of 165F.  30 minutes of cook time will generally result in a rare goose breast, while cooking to a temperature of 165F will result in an overdone bird. 165F internal temperature, as measured from the side of the meat at the middle, will result in an overdone goose breast.  The goose breast will be tough and leathery.  This recommendation is wrong!  The best way of determining the degree of "doneness" is by the hand squeeze method like determining that of a steak.  Goose breasts should not be overcooked.  As goose breasts are very lean,  I also  think wrapping them in bacon, like laying a top a holiday turkey, might aid this recipe by adding much needed fat.

I pulled a set of goose breast on the freezer that had been there for a year. Did I mention I'm just a guy that likes good food? Didn't have everything but tequila for vermouth, rosemary pickelimg spice and cumin for caraway and French's deli style for mustard. This is unreal. I have already passed it along to my hunting buddies. Anyone that found this tough and leathery over cooked it. Goose is served very pink to red or it is ruined. Look it up.

Good flavor on orange sauce. Works well with the goose. Be careful on time required to cook. Do not over or under cook it is a fine line.

Good flavor but the result was very tough. My husband is a hunter so I am always looking for wild game recipes, especially water fowl.  I used a Canadian goose, so I know that this is a variable whenever cooking.

Tasted great.  I used a meat thermometer after 30 minutes as the glass baking dish, gas oven, and variable amount of liquid you end up with affect the cooking duration. Came out great at 165F.  Served with wild rice, steamed broccoli, and asiago focaccia bread.  Mmmmm.

Great texture, good color, the flavor was all orange.  I could not taste any of the goose, just orange, which was fine, because who doesn't like orange?
