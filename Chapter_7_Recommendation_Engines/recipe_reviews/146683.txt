I made this cake for a dinner party and decided to play with it a bit.  I changed the vanilla pudding to banana, only because I like anything with banana. On the first layer I added a layer of very thinly sliced strawberries on top of the filling.  The second layer I added a layer of very thinly sliced bananas on top of the filling.  Then finished the cake with a chocolate drizzle.  It was  great hit at the party.

i love this recipe!

today i made two variations of this recipe for mothers day tomorrow:
chocolate maraschino cherry  
coconut pineapple   

to satisfy the fruit & chocolate lovers of my family. 

i used instant chocolate pudding and a 16oz jar of stemless maraschino cherrys for the first and instant coconut cream pudding and a 20oz can of pineapple for the second. plus the cool whip of course.

they taste wonderful!

i plan to come up with even more varieties in the future.

This is one of my favorite summer desserts. I've made this with many different fruits besides pineapple. The ones my family and friends like the best is strawberries or raspberries. This never fails to go quickly and there's never any leftovers. NOTE: Try it with the cheesecake instant pudding!

fantastic light dessert! I usually ice the outside with cool whip, just so it looks pretty.

This is SOOOOO good if you like pineapple as I do. It is a very light and refreshing summer dessert. I made this for my labor day cook out and everyone loved it, it was gone in mins. 
You can even use the same method minus the pineapple and use bananas and make the pudding as directed on the box, or mix raspberry preserves and cool whip and layer with fresh raspberrys on top. yummmmy

Very light, easy, and pretty. My husband and I are dieting so I was looking for a low-fat dessert to make with fresh strawberries. This was pretty good but lacked that homemade taste. It reminded me of church potluck or family reunion food. I used regular pudding (not sugar free) and added blueberries. It ended up being 3 WW points per serving.

I made this for Easter. I had my "healthy" serving then watched as my "consumers" descended upon it....gone in a flash. I  look forward to making it again, experimenting with different fruits and pudding flavors. My "consumers" say, Awesome!

Refreshing, light dessert!  I served this in stemmed glasses.  I layered strawberries and sliced bananas along with the cake.  It's so easy and so delicious - everyone loves it!

I have made this a few times before for family and coworkers and everyone loves it. It is SO easy to whip up! I will sometimes make extra frosting and frost the entire cake. I have also seen people put blueberries on top of this cake along with the strawberries. This would be a great 4th of July cake.

My family absolutely loves this dessert.  We buy sugar-free angel food cake, which really cuts the carb and sugar count.  Sometimes we change things up a little and use banana pudding instead of vanilla, and kiwi fruit also makes a nice alternative to the strawberries.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe. It is easy, quick and taste amazing! Make sure to leave a little juice in the pineapple just enough to leave the whipped topping a little moist so it spreads easier on the cake. I did not use the pie and pudding filling and it was still amazing without. I also cut up strawberries and added them in between layers.

I made this for EAster @ my sisters home. Everyone loved it. I used cheesecake instant pudding mix with the pineapple and cool whip. I let the pudding mixture sit in the fridge for a while befor I put it on the cake. I also put slice strawberries in between the layers. I filled the center hole with hulled strawberries and put whole strawberries around the bottom edge of the cake. It was soooo good!!

I've used this recipe for years! It's gorgeous! Great for when you are in a pinch. I love to double the filling and fill the hole in the middle of my cake with the extra filling and sliced strawberries. Canned whip cream for the top with whole or halved strawberries on the little white clouds of goodness really add an extra wow. Enjoy!

I have made this several times now, and I like to make a double batch of the pudding and sometimes add strawberry's to each layer, such an easy and quick desert.

the first time i made this was for my sister-in-law and she absolutely loves it!! It was gone before i even got to have a piece! She has asked me to make it every week since!!  i also made it for my mother and she just went on and one about how wonderful it was!! (( i dont like the look of the filling on top so i just out whipped cream, and then strawberries and blackberries, it made it look alot cleaner. I also used strawberries and black berries between the layers, BIG SUCCESS!!

This is a favorite with my staff. Awesome 5 minutes start to finish with no mess.  I have played with several of the sugar free instant Jello puddings.  The Vanilla, Butterscotch, and Cheesecake all are great.  I buy the sugar free angel food cakes at Wal Mart or have a sugar free recipe to keep the calories at minimum. Low calories and zero fat makes this a standout! No one believes it is sugar free.

Made this for a BBQ and started laughing because it ends up looking like a huge egg salad sandwich! It tastes heavenly though, next time I will cube the cake and layer like a trifle in a clear bowl with other ingredients. Great for potlucks, easy, cheap  and fast!

My husband told me about the cake his grandmother would make wishing he could have it again. She is 90 and doesn't remember the recipe and hadn't written it down. Luckily I was able to type in the ingredients and found this cake. Which according to my husband is the exact cake his grandmother made over 20 years ago. 
It is a super easy cake and tastes great!! The only thing I do different is I mix up a pudding mix with whip cream and frost the sides with the mixture, which has to then be refrigerated for at least a few hours before you eat or the frosting will taste grainy. But after the few hours it tastes wonderful and it keeps in the fridge for quite a while.

Super easy and scrumptious! I wish I knew about this over the summer. Even though it has more calories, I will always make it with regular (not sugar-free) vanilla Jello pudding in the future. The fake sugar aftertaste was very noticable in this dessert for some reason.

I love making this cake! Everyone always likes it! I make it esp. for my hubby and his sis at family get togethers because they are diabetic but everyone else always heads for it first! Sometimes it can lean a little as it is a bit fragile so what I do is...after it's all done, I poke 2 long wooden kabob skewers down through the cake at opposite ends to keep it upright! On the skewer end that is still poking out...I place a strawberry or other fruit to cover it up! I cut slices around the skewered area and save that part for the last slice! Ta-da!!! No more slipping or leaning! Try this cake! It's great and a super presentation! People oh and ah over it and think you took so much time but in reality it's one of the easiest things to make!

Very tasty, light, and great for entertaining, although mine did not look as good as the picture displayed here. Sadly, mine looked more like the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Maybe next time I will get it right!

This was tasty but mine didn't look nearly as nice as the pic. It's hard to get the layers back on so straight and even, and it got even more off kilter as I sliced and served it. Also, next time I will use about half the cool whip because it came out less pudding-ish and more whipped cream-ish than I expected or liked.

The cake was great, but the filling did ooze out and down the sides, so it did not look as pretty as the picture. Next time I would chill the filling before spreding on the cake.

I made this for my boyfriend's mother birthday on the 19th October and everybody loved it. Because it tasted so delicious and not sweet at all. I made the Angel food cake from Angel Food Cake III. This is one of my new favourite desserts. I will make one for my sister for Christmas since she Diabetic.

Awesome and easy recipe.  I use store-bought angel food cake or make it myself and double the filling.  Great with strawberries, blueberries and other fresh summer fruit.

What I liked best about this was how easy it is to make. I didn't have room in the frige for the whole cake so I adapted it to a 9x13 pan. I cubed the cake, poured fruit over it then the mixture. It turned out GREAT!

Seven out of eight dinner guests did NOT care for this and the one who did even said, "it's good for a healthier dessert". It almost tasted a little gritty and the flavors just didn't blend that well. My kids will usually eat anything even mildly sweet and they didn't even like this and left most of it on their plates. I will not be making again.

This is cake is so simple to make! Endless combinations of pudding & fruits may be used. It's such a light cake...and that can be a very bad thing because you'll want more than one slice!

Super good! One of the very few cakes I would make again just for hubby and I! (dont like fattening cakes hanging around the house for just the 2 of us) Used coolwhip FREE, and reg pudding. Baked in 3 - 8in round cake pans for 28 minutes. Had some leftover put in a small pan and baked and we ate that night seperate from my 3 layer cake. Yummy, light, fresh and not sinful in fat/calories! Thanks!

This is super easy and super yummy!  I did it a little different but didn't really change much.  Instead of a cup of cool whip I used a whole small container.  I cubed 2 small packages of angel food cake and put them in a Rubbermaid container.  I put the cool whip/pudding/pineapple mixture on top and topped with strawberries.  It was such a nice light dessert for Easter.

My friend made this one night and i loved it so much that I decided to make it for my boyfriend. When i went to the store to get everything i seen they were out of angel food cake and the strawberries didn't look so good,so i decided to tweak it a little bit. Instead of angel food cake I used a yellow cake mix and I replaced the strawberries with a cherry pie filling. I also put the pineapple mixture in a pastry bag and piped it onto the layers of cake. Turned out just as good as when you use the angel food cake.

This is perfect for my diabetic mother, and for all of those who is trying to watch your figure. You can use sugar free everything and is sooo tasty.  Always great for parties and gatherings...people always have love it!!  I believe the best part is how simple this is, no baking, and taste delicious!  No changes needed.  Thanks Jell-O.

This is a good summer dessert - nothing extraordinary until you consider that it can be put together in five minutes, has just a few ingredients, can be made with all sugar-free and lowfat ingredients without ruining the taste, and looks pretty.  I decorated mine with blueberries and sliced strawberries and it was lovely.  My guests and family thought it was a keeper.

I've made this cake several times and have used variations.  I usually only cut the cake into two layers out of a lack of patience.  Still tastes great!  It's a big hit with my family.

I made this for Easter. I did add sliced strawberries between the layers and filled the hole with strawberries. My family loved it and even went back for seconds. It was very easy and quick to make - love the NO baking part.  I will take one suggestion and make this for Fourth of July and add blueberries with the strawberries.

Yummy is all I can say!  Made this for a friends birthday and it was gone withing 30 minutes of slicing. Was asked for the recipe and friends made it the very next day! This was SO easy and so light and refreshing. I did not feel horrible about eating this because it's really low in calories and fat. Very refreshing for the summer months too. Love Pineapple! Great, easy recipe!

I made this cake yesterday for Easter and it tasted great. But was colapsing from weight of filling. Did anyone else have that problem? I did make the cake that morning so was very fresh. Will make another this weekend but will probably put filling on the side. Won't be as pretty.

I made a pound cake instead of using the angel food cake. I made one in a bundt pan and one in a loaf pan.  I served them both at a church potluck and they were the only dessert that had no leftovers. Can't wait to make again!!

Made this for my husband's birthday cake since he doesn't like rich chocolatey desserts and we loved it.  I added sliced strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries to the layers as well.

Great light and fresh cake, I used whipping cream instead of cool whip and just regular vanilla pudding. I also used the Heavenly Angel food cake recipe, what a great combination.

This was AWSOME! I made it for a Realtor luncheon. Everyone loved it! I made a boxed angel food cake, but made them in a mini cupcake pan with papers. Watch out not to burn them! Store the cakes in a zip lock bag overnight to soften (witout the filling of corse). I also made the filling a day or two before the party to set up better and to marry the flavors. I piped the filling onto the cakes about 1 hr before serving. They were perfect little bite sized cakes. I also made a homemade poundcake in a square pan. Cut them up into little bites about 1 inch x 1 inch, put this topping on and WOW!!! The presentaion looks soooo professional! Looking forward to doing it again! Maybe this time with some chocolate!

This recipe was easy to prepare, refreshing, light, & delicious.  It is beautiful & if done correctly, will look exactly like the picture.  I used fat free whipped topping to make it a bit lighter.  This is a keeper!

A hit, and very easy!  Used Cheesecake pudding instead of vanilla and I just wanted to snack on the filling!  Also thought about spreading strawberry jam in the inside layers.  YUM any way you make it!

This is a great, light spring/summer desert.  But I made a few alterations.  I  beat in 8 oz softened cream cheese to the fluff mixture before adding the cool whip.  This adds something to it.  And you can do the low-cal, low-sugar, but why?  You can use skim or 1-2% milk and regular cool whip, and with it being angel food cake, it is still not that many calories.

I came to allrecipes.com today hoping this recipe was here.  I found it on the box of Jello pudding 2 weeks ago and my family LOVED it.  My teenagers were actually fighting over the remaining pieces the next day.  I found the recipe on a box of Jello-O French Vanilla pudding, so I did use that instead of the fat free sugar free pudding listed on the recipe. I read the review by the person using Weight Watchers, and I agree that this would be a light WW friendly dessert if you follow it.  I just finished making this for a second time, and the teenagers were fighting over who got to lick the spoon/bowl!

Not a winner for us at all.  I put sliced strawberries between the layers and frosted the outside with extra cool whip/pineapple mixture.  I was really looking forward to this one but our company agreed that that it just tasted like a large cool whip cake with a hint of pineapple, too bad because I was really looking forward to this.

This recipe turned out pretty good! My husband really liked it but it took a while for me to get used to the taste of the pineapple combined with pudding mix. After the second day of 'soaking' in the fridge, it was really good! Will make again if husband requests

This was good. I liked the flavors. My boyfriend loved it. I felt there was too much pudding/cool whip/pineapple mixture. It was spilling over the sides and I still had some left over so I just spread it all over the sides and middle. My cake also collapsed on one side. Maybe I didn't distribute the filling evenly? I also made a strawberry sauce to drizzle over each piece when served (1/3 cup sugar and water and about 10 strawberrys brought to a boil until thick. Purred in a food processor and refridgerated.)

This was the perfect ending to our Mother's Day meal yesterday! The cake looked so pretty on my pedestal cake plate. The only thing I did differently, was to make the angel food cake, rather than purchasing one. This recipe would also look great in a trifle dish. Thanks for sharing!

This was an easy and nice tasting recipe.  I gave it 5 stars just for the fact that it was so easy to throw together.  I've made it twice already.  The first time I used SF vanilla pudding adn the second time I used SF cheesecake flavored pudding.  Both were great.  I promise my co-worker a cake, but as usual I was too tired.  This came together in a matter of minutes.  Give this simple yummy cake a try!

I followed the directions except for adding thin slices of strawberries on top of each layer of cool whip.  I put this in a trifle bowl for Easter and everyone loved it!  Thanks!

This is a wonderful lite summer cake for all the BBQs that we go to. My friends can't believe that it's sooo easy. I even dressed it up for a Fourth of July party with blueberries, strawberries and sparkler candles (it was my dad's b-day). Just a note I have had to make this cake in a hurry and it did quite well with only 10 minutes in the fridge. My mom even made it and served it right away. It was just the same YUMMY!!!

So easy and good.  I used a bread knife to cut the layers, and it was pretty easy.  I also added some banana slices between the layers.  Liked by everyone.

This is the perfect summer dessert. It always disappears when served at picnics, or when camping. So easy too. I buy a pre-made cake to save time. This is delicious!!!

I wanted to make my own cake for mothers day and my oven isnt working. I bought a fresh pineapple and finely chopped it on my cuttingboard that has a resevoir for juice. I used about 3 qtrs of the pineapple, a whole 8 oz tub of coolwhip & my instant pudding was 5.1 oz (?) I added just a touch of lime juice and a pinch of sugar to be similar to canned pineapple. I used an electric knife to slice the cake across to make 3 layers. I piled the filling high on the top and had enough leftover to go around the outside of the whole cake -pretty, easy, and delicious!

One of my favourites. This is a nice light dessert that can be served to diabetics and dieters. For a change of pace, try using canned peaches cut into chunks instead of pineapple, and garnish with raspberries.

This was good.  Was not able to cut cake into three slices - only two.  But this was a good, lite recipe.
