Good recipe, but I made changes (I'd give my version 5 stars): 1)I pre-cooked the raw crust for 6-10 minutes or so 2)I didn't use a bottle of dressing.  I just spread some dressing around on the crust until it looked covered, but not globbed on (maybe 1/2 cup?) and I used ranch because I like it better. 3) I put half mozz. cheese and half cheddar cheese on top of the pizza (to me, this pizza just called for some cheddar) along with chopped red onion.

My husband and I have been having "Pizza Tuesdays" for a few months now - ever since my aunt finally gave me the recipe for her homemade pizza dough.  As I've been perfecting the art of making the perfect pizza crust, I try out a new topping combination every week - let me tell you, this beats them all!  I used Ken's Steakhouse bleu cheese dressing (only 1/2 - 1 cup), Frank's Red Hot Buffalo Chicken Sauce on shredded chicken (works better on pizza than cubed, I think), and a mix of 1/2 cheddar, 1/2 mozzarella cheese - all things we had on hand.  Delicious, delicious, delicious!

This was sooo good!  I've made it twice already.  The first time I made it with "Bill's Blue Cheese Dressing" from this site.  It was fabulous!  The second time I made it with store bought dressing and it wasn't half as good.  Use Bill's recipe.  You won't be sorry.  Also, the Boboli thick crust is way better for this recipe than the thin.  As suggested, I used roasted chicken.  Big time saver.  Last, but not least, I used Lousianna Hot Sauce (1 1/2 tbls to 3 tbls butter).  Just spicy enough.  Will definately make this again, and again, and again....

In answer to the previous reviewer's question about keeping the crust from getting soggy.  Pre-cook the pizza shell for a few minutes, take it out of the oven and add your toppings.  Works like a charm!

I love making this, with these changes it is even better.....  For the sauce use about 3/4 cup Franks Red Hot (or any other hot sauce), 1 tbl margarine, 1 tbl honey or sweet and sour sauce (to calm down the heat some) and a dash of garlic salt.  Also you can't have chicken wings without celery, so why have your chicken wing pizza without celery???  I cut up 3 or 4 stalks.  Building the pizza as follows... wing sauce (spread like pizza sauce), diced chicken, dollops of blue cheese (3/4 of a 16 oz jar), celery and then the mozzarella.   If your oven is hot enough the crust will not be soggy.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

My family loved it.  I used high quality blue cheese dressing but only about 3/4 cup.  I also used crumbled blue cheese with the mozz.  Buffalo wing sauce is also key to this recipe.  Hot sauce would not be as good.  Using the wing sauce, the butter is not necessary. (wing sauce is hot sauce and butter typically)

Ohh..this is soooo yummy!  I loved the combination of flavors. I used the Pillsbury refrigerated pizza crust and partially baked it before I put any of the fillings on top. I'm not a big fan on blue cheese, so I subbed peppercorn ranch instead and didn't use near the full bottle...only about 3/4 of a cup.  I didn't use the full 2 oz of hot sauce because I only had half a bottle and it tasted great!!  I sprinkled some italian cheese on top and the cheddar directly on the crust so the dressing wouldn't make it soggy. What a great new idea for an old time favorite.  Thanks so much Brown!!

Made this Friday night and all who ate it agreed that it was the best pizza they ever had! However, I did make a few changes: I made the crust from a recipe that I found on this site (Jay’s signature pizza crust) and brushed the crust with olive oil and minced garlic and baked for 10 minutes prior to topping. I cooked the chicken in Griffin’s Hot Buffalo Wing Sauce which is by far the best wing sauce I have ever had. I did not use a whole bottle of dressing just spooned all over the pizza on top of the cheese and chicken…it came out amazing!!

I agree that the amount of Bleu Cheese listed in this recipe is too much.  I took one commenter's advice and just spread a thin layer of it on the pizza dough, which helped a lot.     I also disliked how the Boboli crust tasted the first time, so I picked up some fresh (but uncooked) pizza dough at the bakery section in a local market.  That tasted MUCH better.  I do have one caveat, though, with this pizza, and perhaps someone can give me some useful advice. I've made this twice, and both times, a good quarter of an inch underneath where the cheese meets the bread is soggy, and this just adds an unpleasant texture to the meal.  Is there a way to get around this?  For instance, putting the chicken above the cheese as opposed to directly on the crust?  If I could fix that one thing, it would definitely bump this recipe up to 5 stars because I love the taste of it.  I'd appreciate any help anyone could give!

I have used this recipe many, many times and people always love it! It's definitely me and my wife's favorite pizza recipe. I changed it just slightly, but I'm still rating the recipe as is because my change is just a matter of preference.. I use ranch instead of blue cheese dressing. And I like to sprinkle on half the cheese and THEN the chicken and then the other half of the cheese. It's a great and simple recipe though.

What a great recipe.  So fast and easy.  I also found that spreading just enough of the blue cheese dressing to cover the crust was better than using the whole bottle.  Also, instead of just using regular hot sauce I used Texas Pete's Hot Wing Sauce.  It kind of kicked it up a notch and gave the chicken a more authentic buffalo wing taste.  This recipe will be used in my home often.

I used to work at PizzaHut in High school and used to make this on personal pans all the time for breaks.  Delicious!  Also good with the Morningstar Farms Buffalo Chik'n for vegetarians.

Very good, but I made a few edits.  I pre-baked my crust for about 5 minutes, then spread about 1/2 cup of buffalo sauce and 1/4 cup of blue cheese dressing on it and a small handful of both mozzarella and cheddar cheeses.  I used boneless skinless tenderloins of chicken and cooked them in a skillet with 2 tbs of butter, 1/2 tsp of garlic salt, 1/2 tsp of cracked pepper, and 1/2 tsp of chili powder.  After the chicken was halfway cooked, I added an additional 1/2 cup of buffalo sauce to the pan and cooked a few more minutes.  Then, spooned the chicken over the pizza and added a cup each of shredded mozzarella and cheddar cheeses.  The sprinkled with a tsp or two of oregano and baked an additional 12 minutes or so until the cheese was light brown and bubbly!  It was amazing!

As written I would say maybe 2 stars. The amount of dressing called for is just outrageous. However with a few minor adjustments this pizza is VERY GOOD. I used fresh store bought pizza dough. I combined 3 ounces Frank's Red Hot with the chicken. Here's the kicker. I thinly sliced 2 celery stalks and peeled 2 carrots with a potato peeler (to get strips) and combined them with the chicken & hot sauce. Where I'm from most buffalo wings come with celery and carrots sticks so I thought why not. It gave the pizza some crunch and a touch of sweetness to combat the saltiness of the blue cheese and hot sauce. I also used a good quality blue cheese dressing (Maries)and only used about 6 ounces. (just a thin coat added more than enough flavor.) Allot of people complained the the pizza just fell apart, well it's because the Blue Cheese dressing cooked at such a high temparture will break and thus become loose & runny. To combat this when you take the pizza out of the oven let it sit uncovered for about 30 minutes. It will still be warm but will hold together much better. Give the blue cheese dressing a chance to "set up". I also topped the pizza with 5 ounces shredded cheddar cheese and 6 ounces shredded mozzerella/provolone mix. Provolone is a must cheese on a pizza. If you can get your hands on "sharp" provolone give that a try with the mozzerlla.

One of our favorite kinds of pizza!!!  We have this at least a couple of times a month, and my kids request it frequently.  The only change I make is to use ranch dressing instead of the blue cheese, as we don't care for blue cheese dressing.  It may not be traditional buffalo style, but we love it this way!

We make this quite often around our house.  I always cook the boneless chicken thighs or breast meat from raw in the butter/hot sauce adding garlic.  It soaks up so much flavor this way.  Then we bake our homemade pizza crust for about 10 minutes before adding the toppings.  The kids love it with a ranch dressing/very little blue cheese mixture.  I always make sure to have extra hot wing sauce to mix with the ranch dressing and for drizzling on top.

I took the genius suggestion from KatieO - and used my leftover chicken from the "Slow Cooker Buffalo Chicken Sandwiches" to make this pizza. I used Frank's Buffalo Wing sauce for the chicken, made a homemade pizza crust, covered it with ranch dressing (because I can't stand blue cheese), a little mozzarella and some red peppers for crunch, and baked it on my pizza stone. It was goooood. My husband asked if I could make another one the following night.

This pizza is sooo good! I used just a normal generic brand of pizza dough you just add water to, Louisiana Hot Sauce, and let the cooked chicken sit in the mixture for about 15 minutes while I made the crusts. Instead of Bleu Cheese dressing I used Ranch instead (I like it better) I used a mix of Mozz cheese, italian, and cheddar cheese and sprinkled a little powdered garlic and italian seasoning on top. This was awesome! I also prebaked the crusts for about 5 minutes as some other reviewers recommended, and the dough was not soggy underneath at all! I cant wait to make it again and again. Thanks for sharing!

I recommend shredding the chicken before you put it on the pizza so the chicken pieces arent too big and get spread out!

I was very hesitant to try this recipe. However, it tasted unbelievable! I used a Boboli crust, I also used the ranch dressing II recipe on this site. I shredded the chicken instead of cubing it and I added just a little bit more hot sauce. I couldn't believe the taste! Such a nice change from average pepperoni pizza! Thanks Brown!

This recipe better than the local pizza joint's buffalo pizza!!!. I make the crust(Jay's Signature from this site) and get a rotissere chicken & shred it. Then I use Ken's Chunky Blue Cheese Dressing & Frank's Red Hot Buffalo Chicken Sauce and use a mixture of mozzarella and cheddar cheese's. Excellent Pizza!!!!!!!

I've been using this recipe for years, but I use a homemade crust, just pour some Ranch dressing on until it looks, coat my chicken (usually leftover from another meal) in a Buffalo Wing marinade, and top with mozzarella and cheddar cheese.  Bake at 450 degrees for 20 minutes and it's perfect!

I just made this!! it is AMAZING!!  I used a boboli thin crust that I pre-cooked for 8 min to make sure it wasn't mushy when done. I used ranch dressing instead of blue cheese because I like it more, and I only used about a little more than half a cup. I added red onion and additional cheddar cheese :) probably baked for 15 min so everything came together.  OUT OF THIS WORLD!!

Although the pizza was good there was TOO much blue cheese dressing. I tried asecond time and only coated the crust with the dressing and it came out MUCH better.

This pizza is incredible! We used a Boboli pizza crust. I also added sauteed mushrooms and red onion on top. I also used a mix of cheddar and mozzarella cheese on top. I will definitely make this one again.

Very good pizza! I changed the recipe a little. I used Jay's signature pizza crust recipe from this site. Instead of putting the dressing directly on the pizza, I served it on the side for dipping (used Ranch dressing). I brushed the crust first with a little olive oil with garlic. Then, I put the chicken mixture on. (used Frank's Buffalo wing sauce with the butter to coat chicken). Then topped with mozzarella and parmesan cheese. Thank you for the recipe!

If I could give it more stars I would. Whenever we have Friday Friend night they always request this dish. I have always used ranch in place of the blue cheese but Im sure its amazing either way.

This pizza is SO good. I make it as often as possible. I use Trader Joe's pizza dough, Costco rotiesserie chicken and mix it with Frank's Extra hot sauce. Ranch dressing instead of Blue Cheese and top the pizza with chopped red onions. It is fantabulous and so tasty!

I LOVE buffalo chicken, so I was really excited to give this a try. 

Look, you're making a pizza, which means you don't need to follow the directions in the recipe to a T. Use good judgment when applying the sauce, the meat and the cheese. If you can handle that, you'll make a delicious pizza.

Also, if you aren't happy with the crispiness of the crust, get out a non-stick skillet and put each slice on medium heat for about a minute. You don't need oil or grease, the grease from the pizza will yield a sufficiently crispy crust.

Not enough stars available.  By far the best pizza I've ever had.  I used a Boboli crust as someone recommended in the reviews and baked it a short time before adding the toppings.  Used less blue cheese dressing than called for and I probably used close to 3 ounces of hot sauce which, to me, was only slightly spicy.  I love spicy so next time I will probably use more.  Also increased the cheese to about 12 ounces.  My husband, a couple we had at our house visiting and I thought this was absolutely the best.

I hate to give a negative review for this because it may have been my fault this turned out so bad. Learn from me and don't make the same mistakes! Make sure whatever crust you use is totally done, no matter what the instructions for the crust says (I used Pillsbury). I precooked mine 7 minutes and it was raw! Taste the hot sauce before you use it and make sure it is not too hot! If too hot add more butter. Eyeball the dressing amount.  A whole bottle is too much. Don't whatever you do, use precooked canned chicken. Never again will I. I would like to try this again just to see if I can make it better but I have to work up the nerve!PS- I did try this again but it still was terrible! This time I didn't experiment, I followed the recipe exactly. I will never make it again because neither I nor my fiance liked it. We both love pizza and we love wings, we just think they're better separate.

This was very tasty! I used 1 1/2 lbs. chicken tenders chopped fine. It covers pizza better than bigger chunks. I too, added only half a bottle blue cheese dressing and a little more hot sauce.I used Frank's red hot. We like spicey.This is like chicken wings without the bones!! It was very rich so we couldn't eat alot. We also used hot sauce and blue cheese dressing to dip our pizza slices into. Yum! Thanks Brown!!

Delicious!  What a great way to have the taste of wings and pizza together!  I used a boboli and it turned out great.  As other reviews say, DO NOT use the whole bottle of blue cheese dressing.  A little goes a long way.  What a winner!

I had made the slow cooker buffalo chicken from the website the day before and had a lot left over. It was AMAZING with this recipe! I diced up some celery and sliced some red onion. Pre baked the crust, then added enough ranch to cover the dough. Put the chicken down, then a mixture of mont. cheese and nacho blend because thats what i had on hand. Sprinkled the celery and onion on top and baked.... great 15 minute meal! served with a salad!

This was so yummy so good hit the spot..now if you don't like things so spicy cut back on the hot sauce because it will stick out & if you don't want to use the whole bottle it'll be fine... We totally snacked on this the next day and it was delicious.

Very good.  I cooked and cubed the chicken the day before and let it sit in the hot sauce and butter for 24 hours.  Ranch dressing with blue cheese and onions were my only additions.  Yum!

This was really good.  I, too, used a Boboli pizza crust and also used some Mexican cheese, along with the mozzarella.  When you use the Boboli, you don't need to prebake the crust.  Just pop the whole thing in the oven, and Voila!

AWESOME! I made my own dough, shredded the chicken instead of using chunks, added more hot sauce than called for (we like it SPICY), and used a combo of mozzarella and cheddar cheeses. This was delicious and a definate keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was WONDERFUL! Easy to make...I used a shredded rotisserie chicken for simplicity. We used ranch and bleu cheese, alternately to try the different flavors.

Very, very good. My husband and I order this type of pizza frequently so I thought I'd try making it. I used Jay's Pizza Crust recipe from this site. I also only used about 1/4 cup of light blue cheese dressing. The light has a strong blue cheese taste so it still had a great flavor. Used pizza blend cheese. Excellent, just excellent. Thanks for the post!

Very tasty. I used ranch instead of blue and not a whole bottle. I added a bit of diced onion and green capsicum (bell pepper) and didn't use hot sauce as my kids wouldn't eat it. I think you could just saute the chicken in a bit of bbq if you wished but I liked it how it was. It did need a generous sprinkle of vegetable salt at the end to give it the right flavour, so I guess it would be okay to salt and pepper the chicken.

Made this today. It was one of three pizzas my family ate. Wonderful! A favorite among many of us. My husband said "Take a picture of that one, it looks great!" I used half of 'Jay's signature pizza crust' for the crust. I also used much less blue cheese salad dressing.  Frank's Buffalo Wing Sauce worked great for this. I think one trick is buying a really good rotisserie chicken. The flavor of this chicken will add alot to this pizza. I baked the crust for 7 mins. prior to adding the rest of the ingredients on top. I then continued baking for 10-15 more mins.

This turned out wonderful.  A few tips as others mention... I only used 7 ounces of the dressing and shredded my chicken.  Also, I did not have to use the whole bag of cheese.  Next time, I will add sauteed red onion before baking.  I used Boboli's thin crust and cooked it with all of the ingredients for 15 minutes and it was perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Oh, my golly!  We were skeptical at first, but after the first bite, we were hooked!  I did follow the advice of others and used less dressing (ranch) and instead used it as a dip.  Also, used Frank's Buffalo sauce which made the chicken perfectly spicy.  Super recipe!

Typically I love Buffalo Chicken and bleu cheese, but this was WAY too much. It was goopy and I only used about 1/2 of what the recipe called for. Sad to say, will not make again.

The combination of flavors was amazing, and this pizza was a great way to use up leftover shredded buffalo chicken.  I used the Quick and Easy Pizza Crust recipe from this site w/ some herbs mixed in and and prebaked it (brushed with an olive oil/garlic powder mixture) for a few minutes.  Then, I spread SOME blue cheese dressing (mixed with a tablespoon of buffalo sauce)  onto the prebaked crust and sprinkled extra garlic and onion powder onto the sauce.  I then spread the leftover shredded chicken onto the sauce and added a layer of mozzarella and cheddar cheese.  Baked at 450 degrees.  When it came out of the oven and had rested for 5 minutes, I drizzled some of the blue cheese/buffalo sauce mixture onto the top.  SOOOOO GOOD!

Yum! I listened to a few others and used just a thin layer of dressing on the crust. I also used buffalo sauce with the chicken instead of hot sauce and butter and added some feta cheese into this mix. I layered some raw spinach on top of the dressing then added the meet mixture. I topped that with sauteed mushrooms and asparagus and then sprinkled the cheese on top of that. This was so yummy. I know I made a lot of changes, but I would still give this recipe 5 stars.

Yum!  Used fat free ranch dressing - enough to cover lightly - and about 1 large diced chicken breast.  Only about 4 - 6 ounces cheese too and it was delicious!  Will definitely be enjoying this frequently!

This recipe is very good but I did use Boboli pizza crusts to give it more stamina because the chicken makes it very heavy.  Also used bottled wing sauce instead of making my own.  It's just faster & easier that way.  I will make this again in the future.  Thank you for submitting.

Excellent!  Didn't measure anything but here's what I did.  We had two small Boboli crusts.  On them I spread a thin layer of blue cheese dressing.  On that I put a thin layer of Parmesan.  In a zip top freezer bag I put a package of precooked chicken strips (southwestern flavor) and about 2 T of Emeril's wing sauce.  Spread this and the leftover sauce from the bag over the Parmesan.  Then a layer of reduced fat mozzarella.  Bake at 450 degrees for about 9 minutes.  Hubby said it was the best pizza he'd had in a long time.  This is definitely a keeper.

We REALLY enjoyed this pizza. Rather than bottled dressing, I used the "Absolutely the best..." recipe from this site and it makes just about the right amount for this recipe.

Really easy...really good. I would use a little less chicken, and a little more buffalo sauce. But that is just my family. I also followed other reviews and baked my crust for about 6 minutes, then put just enough blue cheese on top and spread it around. Maybe a cup, total? And I'm not too sure what the butter did, other than make it a bit more greasy. I think next time I will omit it.  But there will be a next time!

It was fabulous, but I did change and add a few things.  I used Pillsbury pizza dough, Mexican blend cheese (I would go with the white cheese if I chose to do it again.), red peppers, and onions.  I used Texas Pete original hot sauce and Marie lite blue cheese dressing.  It came out great.  Excellent recipe!

My husband loved this recipe! I changed it a little.  First I brushed the crust with garlic butter and put it in the oven for a couples minuets to start to brown. I used ranch dressing instead of blue cheese dressing because we do not care for blue cheese. I used mozzarella cheese, parmesan cheese and feta cheese on top! It was AMAZING!!! :)

This recipe was just OK. I don't know why I even tried this one, because I have been making "Buffalo Chicken Pizza", for several years now, and am happy with my "5-Star" recipe! I will post later when I have more time. One thing I would like to say though, is that my recipe is close to the changes that "love to eat" made. I pre-bake my crust, I use Ranch (a good Ranch) Dressing instead of Bleu Cheese, and not a whole bottle, and I use a combo of Monterey Jack and Cheddar Cheese. But, to each his own ;)

Switched it and MUCH better...ONLY Franks hot sauce...add some tomato paste for thicker consistency.  Add some melted butter and some farlic powder to taste No bleu cheese needed....Mix pre roasted or breaded chicken, diced, in hot sauce, butter, and paste mixture.  Spread on ready  made crust.  Top with mix of Monterey jack and mozzarella.  Can sprinkle parsley flakes for a little color.  Bake at 425 til done..anywhere between 10 and 20 min...just keep an eye in it...Fantastic.  Trust e..have tweaked this for months...:)

This was great.  I made a few changes.  First in place of purchasing blue cheese dressing I made the "absolutely the best blue cheese dressing" recipe from this site - that stuff is good.  Next I grilled and shredded the chicken before adding it to the hot sauce.  I added a little white wine vinegar and catsup to the hot sauce and butter.  I also used pizza dough and not prepared pizza crust.  This is very good and it was even better than the gourmet pizza from local pizza shops.

I made 2 pizzas, one with ranch and one with blue cheese.  Liked both equally.  Used Marzetti's chunky blue cheese and Frank's Red Hot Wing sauce and Boboli crust.  Did not use a full bottle of either dressing, just enough to have a nice coating.  Any more than that would have been too much and made a sloppy mess.  I used maybe a 1/2 cup at most of both dressings.  No one in my family likes spicy stuff, so I only used enough wing sauce to lightly coat the chicken.  It was perfect for us, only the slightest amount of heat but it still had flavor.  I did not use any butter.  For the cheese, I used mozzarella, cheddar and Monterrey Jack.  We all like lots of cheese, so I was generous with the amount I put on.  Everyone liked both pizzas, though the kids liked the ranch more.  My husband liked the blue cheese one more.   Thought this was an easy recipe and was a nice change of pace in pizza.  Would definitely make this again.

Yum!  This pizza turned out better than what we get from our favorite pizza joint.  I followed the advice of others and only put a layer of the dressing on the crust.  I'm sure I'll be making this again very soon!

I liked this, but couldn't taste the dressing hardly at all. The next time I make it I think I will add some crumbled bleu cheese on top and more mozzarella cheese as well.

Awesome!  A huge hit in my family of  teenagers & parents, even my picky 13 yr old ate it!  I did as suggested and only used enough dressing to cover the crust, it was perfect.  I DID NOT precook my crust & it was not soggy, but we did cook it at 425 for 25 minutes!  Thank You - this will be a weekly dinner!

Awesome recipe. Made this as a quick meal for my mom and girlfriend. They both loved it. I used Frank's red hot and butter. I tried to find the Frank's buffalo sauce but they were all out at the grocery store, but it still turned out great. Also used ranch instead of blue cheese (gf is not a fan).  I'm making a couple of these pies for super bowl. One is going to be MUCH hotter :)

I tried other recipes for this but haven't found anything that pleased my husband. This was much easier and he was happy. I let the chicken set in the buffalo sauce for about an hour before using. YUMMY!

This is great! I didn't find that I needed the whole bottle of hot sauce or blue cheese dressing... but that's ok, now I have enough left over for another pizza. I also added thinly sliced tomatoes, which worked great with the chicken & blue cheese flavours. Thanks for the great recipe.

This was absolutely delish! I didnt use all the dressing, oh yeah and I used ranch, I just used enough to coat the crust. I cut up and browned chicken and tossed with butter and Franks hot sauce. It was soo good and cheesy. I liked it better than Pizza huts buffalo chicken pizza!

This is a great pizza, HOWEVER, the crust and the chicken used will make a HUGE difference. First, we did use a high quality blue cheese. Second, Boboli crusts will be the best in my opinion. With Boboli, you will not have even a slightly soggy crust - they were perfect. And third, use a moist chicken. I would recommend a store-bought rotisserie chicken. If you make the chicken, any dryness will play a huge factor. This will be a recipe I will use again, probably many times, with the right quality ingredients. As written, I give this 4 solid stars. Using high quality ingredients and a Boboli crust, it's a solid 8 stars.

This is sooooo easy and good.  My children loved it.  The only thing I did different was marinate the chicken in the hot sauce overnight so that it would absorb the flavor better.

I absolutly LOVE this recipe!!!! I didn't put as much dressing on as it says and used Ranch instead of Blue Cheese. I also put some red onions on top and used chopped chicken instead of cubed. I cannot explain to you how good this pizza is. I will defintaly be making this again. Thanks for the recipe!

I used dough from TRADER JOE'S. This is an excellent meal for all us hot wing lovers!!! Definitely pre-cook your dough to PREVENT SOGGINESS! You also don't need a whole 16oz bottle of dressing! Put it on according to your preference. If you would like to try this recipe, but aren't keen on really hot, DON'T USE THE WHOLE BOTTLE OF HOT SAUCE. I liked it, but I love hot stuff!! Use any mix of cheese you like! It doesn't take long at all in the oven!!

The blue cheese was a little overpowering but I loved the hot sauce and chicken flavor.  Next time I will omit the blue cheese and just use the chicken mixture and mozzarella. For the dough I used my standard recipe.  3 cups flour, 1 package yeast, 1 tbl. sugar, 1 tsp. salt. Mix and add one 12oz. warm beer.  Let rise for 20 min. and kneed.  Bake at 425 for until slightly brown.

YUM! I actually made the crust from this site "Jay's Signiture Pizza Crust" and also the Blue Cheese Dressing from this site "Bill's Blue Cheese Dressing" to our tastes (which is AMAZING by itself, even better with this pizza) Mixed motz and sharp chedder cheeses and it is to die for. I also mixed the chicken and the hot sauce about 20 min early and let it soak into the chicken! AMAZING!!!!!

Pretty good. I had some friends over last night and they enjoyed this pizza. I used ranch dressing instead of bleu cheese (about 1/2 to 3/4 of the bottle) and topped it with red onion slices. I personally though it was better cold either way it was devoured in no time.

This was sooooo good. I used fat free blue cheese and couple of blue cheese crumbles.

You only need to make this ONCE and then you'll be HOOKED!  I use the ready made crusts that come in the bags in the grocery store and one of the chunky blue cheese dressings in the produce section of the grocery store.  And like the reviewers before me use only enough dressing to lightly cover the crust.  DO NOT use an entire bottle or jar.  I also add red onions and mushrooms.  Occasionally, I even buy the individual size crusts and take mini buffalo pizzas to the guys at work.  They LOVE it!!!

We didn't really care for this.  Sorry.  I used less bleu cheese dressing than called for (as others suggested) and we still thought maybe it was too much.  It was just too rich and had kind of a funky taste.  My husband who loves buffalo wings asked that I not make this again.

My Wife loved it - I Thought it was "above average" and will make it again with a couple of modifications.  I, like many others used a pre made pizza crust (12") and reduced the amount of dressing; I used about 8 oz on the 12" crust and even  that was a little much, next time I will cut it back to about 6 ounces. I first marinated the chicken breast about 4 hours in Basil infused sunflower oil and a generous amount of pesto seasoning, I then grilled the chicken. 3 - breast was plenty of the 12" crust. Liking things I the spicier side, I will add a little more hot sauce to mine next time. I also missed the tomato flavor and will try adding a little tomato paste to the hot sauce and butter mixture before putting on the pizza.

If you like buffalo chicken and pizza this is a great combo! I have made it many times, but haven't reviewed it until now. Instead of the bottled blue cheese dressing try "Bill's Blue Cheese Dressing" on this site. I also prefer it with the Texas Pete Buffalo Wing Sauce versus just hot sauce. It is hands down the best pizza recipe I have tried. Thanks Brown for a great recipe. (If your kids don't like blue cheese, don't tell them it is on there. My kids wolf it down everytime I make it and they "hate" blue cheese!)

My fiance and I loved this. Just loved it.  We used store-bought, pre-made pizza crust (although a home-made crust, with more time at my disposal, would have been equally as good). We used Renee's Blue Cheese dressing, and boneless, skinless chicken thighs (I used 4 for one pizza).
Ok, here's what I did, after reading all 176 reviews:
I boiled the chicken thighs until cooked through, about 10 minutes.  Then, I shredded the chicken.
I used a full 2 ounces of Frank's red hot sauce, but didn't marinate for longer than 20 minutes (because although we like hot and spicy foods, we try to keep the skin of our tongues intact).
I omitted the butter.  On the ready-to-bake pizza crust, I spread just a little more than enough blue cheese dressing to cover the entire diameter.  I distributed the chicken evenly, and topped with 4 sliced mushrooms, and mozzarella cheese.  For a little bit of colour, I sprinkled a parsley/portobella mushroom blend of seasoning on top, and a slight sprinkling of red chili flakes.  

I placed the pizza directly on the top rack of my oven...no pizza stone, no pizza baking sheet, just on the rack.

Voila! It came out perfectly.  For all of you that are hesitant to try this, don't hesitate! Just make sure that your oven is hot enough, eyeball the ingredient amounts, and you'll have a unique and flavourful pizza that won't disappoint.  Will make again!!!!! Thx Brown

This got a lot of great reviews but I’m not one of them. Not yum. Call me a purist. I love Buffalo wings and I love pizza and I kept expecting this to be the best of both worlds. But don’t expect wings and don’t expect pizza. It is neither. I used bread machine pizza dough off this site that was good and I did put a scant few onions on it. These did nothing for or against it. I did go easier on the blue cheese dressing, putting as much on as I would pizza sauce. It was still pretty rich and overpowering and I love blue cheese dressing! Not to mention the dressing is rather expensive to use as pizza sauce. Sorry, I rarely give bad reviews but I won’t make this one again. Hubby didn’t care for it either. We slathered on extra Frank’s hot sauce to be able to finish up the leftovers. One good thing I will say, I had to try it because a national pizza chain is currently offering a Buffalo chicken pizza and I had some doubtful curiosity. Thanks for saving me the money ordering one!

This is awesome!  Based on reviews, I only put as much dressing as I would pizza sauce.  I think it could have used a tad bit more, but definitely not a whole bottle.  I did a small portion with Ranch dressing just to test it out and of course my husband liked the Ranch portion better and I preferred the Bleu Cheese.  I shredded my chicken and used about 3 ounces of Frank's Red Hot and only 1 TBSP of butter.  I used Jay's Signature Pizza Crust and prebaked it for about 10 minutes before adding the toppings, then baked for almost 15 minutes.  We might try adding purple onion next time, too.  This was a wonderful change of pace.  Thanks so much for the great (albeit unusual) recipe!

***** +  I have made this twice already and each time it came out exceptional.  I too would suggest using judgement with the blue cheese dressing; too much will make it messy.  Used 2 cooked and shredded chicken breasts and 4 ounces of Frnak's sauce.  Take about 15 minutes in the oven.  We have 2 boys at SUNY Oswego and they gave it a repeated thumbs up.  Next time I am going to try some crubbled gorgonzola blue as a suggestion made by them.  Will definitely make this one many times again.

This was absolutely delicious - and so easy to make.  I don't like blue cheese dressing, so I used ranch instead - and it tasted excellent!  Will definately make this again - it's perfect for Sunday afternoon football games.

This was seriously one of the best recipes that we have ever tasted.  It's great because you can customize how much blue cheese to put on (we just put enough to cover the crust), and how HOT you want your chicken to be!  Just do a taste test of the chicken before you put it on the pizza.  We also used a Boboli pizza crust, and it was great and easy! Absolutely wonderful!

My five roommates were very skeptical, but everyone loved this dish.  I made three pizzas using frank's red hot sauce (just enough to cover the chicken so it wasn't way too hot).  Those who liked it more spicy just added some sauce on the pizza before eating it.  I made one pizza with blue cheese and one with ranch.  The other was half and half.  Both were liked, but the blue cheese lovers preferred that pizza and those who didnt like blue cheese preferred ranch.  Both are good, just depends on your taste.  And, of course, dont use the whole bottle of dressing!

Great taste. I used boneless chicken thigh (cheaper and more moist). Followed other recommendations and added red pepper, mushroom, gr. onion, fresh basil( use whatever you have on hand). Because I served this for lunch and didn't have pizza crust, I used split English muffins (worked out great). I pre-heated the tray so that the bottoms would also be crunchier. I agree with others that butter is not necessary. This was a huge hit and will definitely make again.

This recipe was really easy to make and tasted just like buffalo chicken wings.  My family thought this was a great recipe.  I did make a few changes.  This recipe does not need an entire bottle of hot sauce, especially if you will be serving this to children.  I used about 1/3 of a bottle and found that to be sufficient.  I also substituted ranch dressing for the blue cheese and I only used as much as I thought was necessary.  There is no need for an entire bottle.  Thanks for this unique and tasty recipe.

This was good for a change!!!  I marinated my chicken and grilled it and then cut it up - or you could use leftover chicken! Definately use the blue cheese dressing sparingly.  We LOVE blue cheese, and I actually divided the bottle between two baboli's, and it was still a little too much -- definately just use enough to cover the bread shell - may add some fresh crumbled blue cheese next time.  There are no leftovers - will make again!!!!!!!

I made this recipe and my boyfriend LOVED it!  It has just enough kick.  I found that using a whole bottle of dressing was too much, though, and 1/2 was better.  Cooking the chicken was the longest part of this recipe.  I also used a pizza crust mix instead of a pre-made crust.  Turned out great!!!

Wow! I was a bit skeptical, but this is delicious.
Since this is not very healthy, knock yourself out and splurge. For a killer combo use Jay's Signature pizza crust and Bill's Bleu cheese dressing, both at allrecipes. I just thinly  coated the top of the crust with the bleu cheese.
This is also great cut into squares and served as a snack or appetizer.

We've made this several times now and changed up the crust each time.  Our favorite so far is called Flatout Flatbread from the deli department at our local Stop & Shop.  We got the spicy Italian and it was great.  Thanks for a fun recipe!

I have made this for many years, and took some ideas from a bar that made this - and theirs was great!!! First, make your own dough or buy dough from grocery store.Nice chunks of chicken are good! In a pinch I used canned chicken (oh, don't judge- some nights are just too busy!) and mix with Frank's hot sauce. Only use enough Bleu cheese to cover the dough. And sometimes I mix with ranch dressing too. You can even sprinkle that with some of the hot sauce.I also use crumbled bleu cheese, along with a little parmesan and top with mozzarella. SOOO GOOD!

I just made this and OMG is it good. I pretty much followed the directions but I used a can of chicken breast chunks, shredded the chicken, put the chicken, some chopped onion and the hot sauce in a skillet and heated it up. I did not have blue cheese or ranch dressing but I did have Feta cheese dressing so I used it instead. I cannot believe how good this is! I order buffalo chicken pizza at restaurants and this beats them all.

Here's a few small changes that I made that made this pizza GREAT: one, I used a made-from-scratch blue cheese dressing recipe and a made-from-scratch pizza crust recipe, both of which I found on here and both of which were great. Really upped the flavor and freshness of the pizza. Two, I used way, WAY less hot sauce. For me, personally, that was ENTIRELY too much. I didn't even use half of ONE 2 oz bottle of hot sauce between TWO pizzas. However, THAT came out perfectly for me. And three, I grilled the chicken before cooking it on the pizza. All of this combined, though, ended up making the pizza need about 15 minutes in the oven at that temp. Anyway, AMAZING!

We make homemade pizza about once a week depending on our schedule.  I like to experiment with different types of pizza and this has turned out to be one of my favorites.  It is not something  I would make on a regular basis but definately worth a try if you are in the mood for something different.

My family loves this pizza. It's so simple and comes out great everytime we make. We buy a rotisserie chicken shred it and put it on our pizza. We also add bacon and onions to it. Stick it under the broiler a couple of minutes and will brown up the cheese.

Really good.  I used a fraction of the ranch dressing called for though after reading other reviews.  It didn't taste as "buffalo" as I thought it would, but the taste is great.  Maybe next time I'll add a little more buffalo sauce.

I think maybe the blue cheese dressing? Something was really off. My husband wants to try this again, but using just ranch. Also, we'll cook chicken ahead of time and marinate in the hot sauce.

I've made this twice now.  The first time it's pretty good, but what I did to pump it up to great was to cook the chicken, then I tossed it w/ a mixture of buffalo sauce (no butter) and I combined ranch (personal preference) w/ the buffalo sauce using a 2:1 ratio.  I used a grilled panini bread (similar to a pita bread) and spread the buffalo ranch sauce on it, topped it w/ mozzarella and the cooked cubed chicken.  After it was finished I drizzled some light ranch on it, and splashed some more buffalo sauce on it.  Awesome pizza!!!

This was a pretty good recipe. The only changes I would make would be to use much less chicken. It really only needs two or three pieces per slice, otherwise it is too heavy.

I have been making this for years.  I use WalMArt chicken fingers, cook them, cut them up and coat them with Franks Buffalo Wing Sauce.  But not too much.  And I use Ranch dressing but only 1/2 cup.  As another reader said, it definitely calls for a good amount of cheddar with some mozz and a sprinkling of cooked chopped bacon.  And I always pre-bake the crust.  This is a fav in our house.

Just covered the crust with cheap blue cheese dressing just like you'd do with red sauce. Added exactly the amount of the other ingredients mentioned except added extra mozzarella. Used homemade crust from this site, excellent! We both really enjoyed this. Oh and we used Frank's hot sauce. Thanks!

This is delish! We bought a homemade crust from the store. Melted the butter and hotsauce while the sliced chicken cooked. Then topped off the pizza with the butter/hot sauce mixture and topped with chicken and mozzarella cheese. VERY GOOD. I do not care for bleu cheese so we left that out. Also, if you buy a premade crust, make sure to bake it a few minutes before putting the toppings on. Otherwise this will get too soggy.

Wow!  This is delicious and in my rotation.  Some minor tips:  bake crust for five mins before putting anything on it.  Use real chicken.  Yes, it takes longer, but I tried to get away w/using the precooked perdue chicken and it wasn't the same.  Also, after cooking chicken marinate it in the butter and wing sauce.  Overall, unique, tasty and awesome!

I started working part-time in a pizza shop, and before that I made this pizza as listed.  Then after seeing how the shop makes their Buffalo chicken pizza, I modified it slightly -- instead of spreading blue cheese dressing over the crust, I make a sauce out of blue cheese dressing and Buffalo wing sauce (hot, med, mild however you like it) and spread that over the crust!  Everything else is the same, and it's awesome!!

Great recipe!  I baked the crust a few minutes first before adding the toppings so that it would be nice and crispy.  Also, in the spirit of wings from a restaurant, I sauteed some shredded carrots (from a preshredded bag) and chopped celery in a little butter with salt and pepper, just enough to take the rawness out of them, and added them to the toppings of chicken and cheese.  Plus, as I didn't have blue cheese dressing, I used ranch, and it was great!  We had this last night for supper; I can't wait for the leftovers for lunch today!

Excellent - I used the "Brooklyn Brick Oven Pizza" dough recipe on allrecipes.com (which is AMAZING by the way) in conjunction with this recipe for the topping.  My wife is a huge fan of the buffalo wing chicken pizza and she found this to be very much like what she has had at a good pizzeria.  I made a large pie - 18" and did use nearly a full bottle (8oz) of blue cheese dressing to get a decent layer, and of course with that large a pie 8oz of cheese just doesn't cut it - I probably used about 12 oz.  Prebaking the Brooklyn Brick Oven Pizza dough for about 3 minutes to ensure a crisp bottom prior to putting any toppings on is a good idea too.  Outstanding recipe!

I thought this was delish and rated it a 5.  My husband thought it was a 4.  We typically like our buffalo sauce pretty hot so I doubled the hot sauce but it wasn't overwhelming.

This was just okay for us. I used ranch as the guys don't like bleu cheese. I think my issue with it is that it's very one dimensional. It reminded me more of a Hot Pocket. My 22 year old son really liked it, my husband and I were just okay with it. Not sure I'd make it again.

Awesome!  I give this 4/5 stars, however, because I didn't make it according to the recipe.  I didn't like the idea of a thick crust, so I used a Jiffy pizza crust mix to make a really thin, crispy crust on a perforated pizza pan.  I pre-baked the crust for 5 min. at 425 degrees, then let it sit while I cooked up my chicken breasts.  I used 5 boneless skinless chicken strips (equivalent to no more than 2 breasts).  Before cooking and while partially frozen in some areas, I cut the chicken up into small slices.  I placed these in a bowel and covered in Frank's Red Hot Buffalo Wing Sauce  (1/2 bottle?) for the amount of time it took me to make the pizza crust.  When the crust was done pre-baking, I cooked the chicken with marinade in a pan until thoroughly cooked through and the sauce had cooked down.  I then applied Ken's Chunky Blue Cheese dressing to the crust and swirled it around.  On top of that, I generously sprinkled crumbled blue cheese.  After that, I put on the chicken, followed by a light drizzle of more wing sauce.  If I would have had red onion, I might have added some at this time.  For extra cheese, I lightly covered the pizza with mozzarella and cheddar shredded cheeses.  I baked this for 15 min at 425 degrees, followed by 3 minutes under the broiler (all in the middle of the oven). We dipped our pizza as we ate it in more blue cheese dressing.  This was outstanding!!  My son is begging for more. This would make a great addition to a party. Thanks for the idea.

I make something like this all the time. Same amount of chicken, but cubed and sprinkled with celery salt (since I'm not a fan of real celery but like the flavor), sauteed with cooking spray and tossed in just enough Frank's Buffalo Wing sauce to coat each piece. 1/4 to 1/2 cup ranch dressing spread over the crust, topped with half mozzarella/half cheddar (provolone is even better) with the chicken on top of the cheese. Add some chopped fresh cilantro, bake till bubbly and golden brown and it's delicious!

This pizza is really good! I did do a few things different- used ranch instead of blue cheese and marinated raw chicken in frank's buffalo sause, then cooked it and shredded it, which is much better for pizza than cubed.  I also used the buffalo sause in the chicken mixture instead of the hot sause.  For the dressing, you don't need a whole bottle, just spread on to coat the crust. YUMM, will make this one many more times!!

I have been using this recipe for a while now and just forgot to rate it. One thing we prefer is to use frozen breaded chicken nuggets instead of the chicken breast meat. I just warm them up a little before putting them in the sauce. They seem to hold the sauce better and we like it spicy!

Good, but not great. I had high expectations after reading all the rave reviews. I think the Gourmet Chicken Pizza recipe is much better and my husband agrees too.

Great inexpensive, FAST, tasty and fun weekday (or any day) meal. I used a store bought refrigerated pizza dough, brushed with olive oil and garlic powder, baked first for 6-10 minutes, added toppings but also added some crumbled bacon (because everything taste better with bacon)! Made even easier because I cook additional chicken breast to keep in the freezer for those times I need something quick & easy! Enjoy!

As others have noted, you can really scale back on the blue cheese dressing and the buffalo sauce.  I also used half cheddar, half mozzarella on top.  One of the best pizzas I've ever had!

I made this with Jays pizza crust (which is AWESOME bytheway). I thought this pizza was pretty good, I used hooters hot wing sauce and rubed olive oil and sprinkled garlic powder over the dough before baking it on stone. Next time I am going to try making my own blue cheese dressing because I think the pizza would taste better this way.  Thanks for sharing this recipe Nelson!

one word, AWESOME!  This is different than your typical pizza, the combination of flavor was great.  I made the crazy crust pizza dough.  combined both the ranch and blue cheese dressing - make sure to spread just enough to cover the dough -  I also used franks wing sauce, which made the flavor tasty.  My family and I loved it! loved it! loved it!

It was excellent. I do agree the recipe should be modified slightly. I used enough blue cheese to cover the pizza lightly. I only used 2 chicken breasts. I also added onions, next time I make the pizza I will plan on adding pineapple as well. This is definetly one of the best pizzas I have ever eaten. I am no pro at making pizza either. I used the pillsbury pizza crust. I also added butter and parmasan cheese to the crust.

Delicious.  I used left over "Buffalo Chicken Rolls", substituted blue cheese for blue cheese dressing and used a Pillsbury crust.  I used Tabsaco for the hot sauce.  Next time, I will go to the trouble to make my own crust.  There will be a next time.

I am giving this recipe 3 stars if you follow it exactly. It was a good idea, but the ingredient proportions were all wrong. Try some of these tips for a better pizza: For those of you who found that the bleu cheese dressing made it too sloppy, runny, or the crust too soggy, try getting some actual bleu cheese and crumbling it on the pizza. It will melt down but not add too much moisture if you drain it before crumbling it on the pizza. The hot sauce serves as the pizza sauce (albeit a hot one) so you don't need to over-do the "sauce" aspect with bleu cheese dressing. If you can't tolerate heat too well, use 1 oz of hot sauce, or just add another Tbs or two of butter to the original amount in the recipe. I made this with a homemade crust, and it was not soggy at all and the crust was cooked all the way through. I did precook the crust, mind you.  Sorry if this review seemed as if I was putting down your recipe, BBNELSON, but I am glad you posted it so we can all get an idea of how to make this pizza, even if it needs a bit of tweaking.  ;)  Thanks! :)

I love buffalo and blue cheese flavors together so trying this recipe was a no-brainer. I used chunky blue cheese dressing, but only enough to coat the pizza crust. I also bought frozen buffalo chicken strips and cooked them and chopped them up instead of making my own buffalo chicken. I put the chopped buffalo chicken on the blue cheese and then sprinkled it with some crumbled blue cheese before topping with mozzarella.

WOW, great flavor! If you're not serious about great food then don't bother with this recipe. I'm am becoming a fan of spicy food fast. Great recipe for guests, it's so easy to make but totally tastes as though you slaved to prepare it. Impress you family and friends with this satisfying meal, your stock as a great cook will really go up.

Loved this recipe!  It was better than the gourmet buffalo chicken pizzas we have purchased at a pizza shop.  Used just enough blue cheese dressing to coat the surface of the crust with a very thin layer, probably 2 or 3 ounces of dressing.  I'm adding to my original review, above, because I've made this several times, now, and the recipe is fail-proof, even with changes.  I've used quartered chicken nuggets, rotissary chicken, microwave-cooked chicken breast chunks...  all fine.  I added crumbled blue cheese and parmesan cheese... still great.  And I topped with shredded lettuce and chopped celery after cooking, and this worked well too.

I made this for my boyfriend and 2 friends- all 3 are obsessed with Buffalo Chicken pizza and often order it when we go to a pizzeria for lunch.  WOW it flew off the table!  I used Frank's Red Hot and followed other reviewers' tips to bake the crust before adding the toppings- 5 minutes did the trick, there was no sogginess.  I didn't try it because I really don't like meat, but based on everyone's reaction: 5 stars! :)  Thanks so much!

Something went terribly wrong with this recipe for us.  I don't know if it was the blue cheese dressing I used (Lite House) but it was a pool of grease.  Didn't even taste good.  Not sure if the dressing melted or maybe was a mayo base but it just didn't work for us.  I usualy love that dressing.  Oh well back to plain old buffalo wings and blue cheese dipping. Maybe we will try again with a different brand of dressing because I like the concept of this recipe.

I feel really bad, but I have to give this only 2 stars because it really didn't go over very well at our house. There are so many great reviews, I would recommend at least trying this recipe if you're interested in it ... but be sure to use good, quality ingredients (we're on a budget so I'm forever buying store-brand stuff!). Specifically, don't skimp on the quality of hot sauce or the blue cheese dressing, as the flavor will suffer a bit - and if you know you've got a good homemade pizza crust recipe, then use it... but I would otherwise stick to the pre-made crust.  Also, if you favor traditional pizza flavors (tomato-based sauce with cheese and toppings) and don't like to stray from the norm, then the flavors in this pizza may not be to your liking.  We as a family love wings, but aren't used to different styles of pizza, so this recipe just didn't quite work.  I think it's just a matter of preference, and unfortunately not every recipe will work for every family, all of the time. Good luck to future users/reviewers, I'm sure many of you will continue to find success w/this recipe.  :)

The only reason I am giving this recipe 4 stars is because I made a couple of changes.  The taste was total 5 star!  I loved this pizza so much!  My husband, who thinks there is nothing special about pizza even loved this.  I used Ranch dressing instead of blue cheese, and I did reduce the amount used too.  I also used shredded chicken, not cubed.

AWESOME!!!!!  This was the best recipe that I have tried in a long time.  I cannot believe that I have had it in my saved recipes since 2003 and never made it!  Try it, you'll like it, especially if you are a fan of hot wings.  Great with a beer!  I have to admit that I added more hot sauce then the recipe called for because I like hot sauce alot.  And I used mozzarella and cheddar cheese as someone had suggested.  Next time I will brush a little butter on the crust edges and sprinkle powdered garlic on top.  But regardless this was FABULOUS!

Used a homemade crust recipe and Bill's Blue Cheese dressing recipe.

Good flavor, but the pizza seemed a little naked with just the chicken on it.  I will probably add some caramelized onions or something next time.

This recipe was excellent.  Based on the reviews, I used Ranch dressing instead of bleu cheese. 1 cup was a little too much dressing, so next time I make it, I will use 3/4 cup or just eyeball it so there is not so much dressing on it (too much dressing makes it soggy).  I also used a boboli crust - which was excellent.  I cooked it a little longer than the recipe calls for until it was golden brown and bubbly.  To cook the boneless, skinless chicken breasts, I used a stoneware bar pan and baked at 350 for about 15 mins - came out perfect and so easy!  I baked the pizza on a stone and it kept the pizza warm for quite a while.  I will definitely make again and even though the boboli crust was great - I'm going to try making my own crust next time to compare.

This is absolutely delicious!! I made this on Boboli pizza crust and just enough blue cheese dressing to cover the crust...I can see how using too much blue cheese dressing would be entirely too rich.  Most importantly, I made the buffalo chicken tenders from the "Restaurant-Style Buffalo Chicken Wings" recipe from this website. These tenders are unbeleivable, and I think it's what made the pizza so incredible!!! Topped with mozzarella cheese.  Yum. Go make it!

I used half the amount of dressing as others suggested.  This was good, not great.  I felt like something was missing on top of the pizza.  Next time I will try adding red onion.

Probably would have given 5 stars if I hadn't used a low-fat blue cheese dressing.  It was way too thin for this type of dish.  But that was my fault.  Will try again using a thicker dressing.

Loved this! Made it on english muffins which I toasted first. I didn't measure the bleu cheese dressing, just brushed some on each piece because I was worried about it getting soggy. Used buffalo wing sauce with a little extra hot sauce and 2% mozzarella. My husband said he could eat this every night. YUM!

I'm not a big pizza fan, but even I enjoyed this recipe! I made this for a quick Friday night dinner using store bought pizza crust. Also used 8 oz of ranch dressing instead of the blue cheese and that was still a little too much. The toppings tended to slide off. Family loved it and I will be making this again!

I made several modifications, starting with a whole wheat pizza dough from Trader Joe's. For the sauce, I used half a can of refried beans w/ jalapenos and mixed in a few spoonfuls of spicy BBQ sauce. I used 1 can (10oz) of white meat chicken which worked well because it is shredded and spreads over the whole pizza. I topped the chicken with some red onion rings, diced red pepper and sauteed mushrooms. For the cheese, I used half fat-free shredded cheddar and half low-fat mozzarella cheese. The pizza was a little thicker and took about 15 minutes. A little spray of olive oil on top near the end crisped the cheese up gorgeously! Simply delicious!

This was delicious.  As New Yorkers we love our chicken wings, but we can't get good ones since we moved.  We also can't get very good pizza.  This combo is perfect.  I made my own pizza crust using the quick and easy pizza crust recipe from this site.  I baked it 5 minutes at 450 and then topped it and baked another 10 minutes at 450.  It was a big hit!

WOW! I absolutely love this pizza! I've made it several times with different variations each time. I also use ranch dressing, just because I don't usually have bleu cheese on hand. I make the pizza dough, spread it in the pan, poke it with a fork all over, sprinkle with olive oil and a little salt, then bake for about 5 minutes(otherwise it seems to get a little soggy for me) Then spread with the dressing, chicken, and cheese. It always turns out great. Thanks for sharing :-)

The recipe calls for way too much blue cheese dressing. The sauce came out soupy and the pizza was very heavy. I will not make this again.

This was a hit here for sure! I used a Boboli prepared thick pizza crust, Frank's Red Hot sauce, Wish Bone chunky blue cheese dressing, and only enough to cover the crust like you would pizza sauce. There is no way I could ever consider the whole bottle as the recipe directs. I did add fresh sliced mushrooms, onion, and some bacon bits on half. Due to a phone call, the chicken sat in the sauce for about twenty minutes before I made the pizza. My guys really loved this one and I WILL make this again. In fact, hubby's exact words were, "Wow Babe, this is the BEST pizza I've ever eaten!"

Really tasty & a great way to use up cooked chicken breast.  I tossed the cubed chicken with Frank's red hot sauce and didn't add butter.  I used boboli, added a little less than 1/2 a bottle of ranch, topped with the chicken, mozzarella, and threw some diced red onions on top.  Next time I will reduce the amount of ranch even further & add more onions.

This pizza is great!  I only used about 2/3 bottle of blue cheese dressing and there was still a lot on it.  I also added a little more hot sauce to the butter than it called for.  The next time I make this I think that I will double the hot sauce mixture but use a ratio of 2T butter to 3 oz. hot sauce (I like it a little spicier).  I think I'll also make blue cheese dressing if I have the time.  It was even better the next day when I warmed it up.  Delicious!!

I followed the recipe exactly, but it turned out terrible. I'm sorry to say. The blue cheese flavor is too much strong, and otherwise tasteless.

This was really good... with this recipe, I used 2 pkg of Pillsbury pizza dough (followed the directions on the pkg),used ranch dressing (instead of blue cheese) and used the "Quikchop" to cut the chicken into smaller pieces.

This recipe was delicious-a big hit!  We used ranch dressing instead of blue cheese and also added celery to the pizza.  The crunch really added to it!  Thanks so much for a great recipe!

This was really good. This was the fasted meal i've made in a long time.  I used pre-cooked chicken, a pre made crust and ranch dressing.  I didn't use a full bottle of the dressing.  My husband hates pre-made crusts and didn't want to eat it, however once he tried it he ate 3/4 of it in one sitting.

This was very good, and easy to make.  The Blue Cheese dressing was a little stong.  I think I will try Ranch next time. I also added red onion slices.

Absolutely superb! As a lover of hot wings, this was perfect and so easy.  Even quicker to use store roasted chicken, and boboli thick crust.  Didn't use quite as much blue cheese dressing, since crust was a little smaller and used texaspete wing sauce cuz that's my favorite!  It was gone in as long as it took to throw it together, which was minutes.  Loved it!

If you love buffalo chicken wings this is the recipe for you!  I made individual pita pizzas for my family with this recipe, each just the way they like it...mild, medium, and suicide!  The only change was that I mixed mozzarella and sharp cheddar cheeses, and topped it with a little fresh ground pepper!  Update - Now when I make this, since it is always requested, I add some chopped celery and gorgonzola crumbles.

Excellent recipe!!  I made a few changes.  I used the Pillsbury refrigerated pizza dough,  a deli rotisserie chicken, ranch dressing(personal preference), and Moore's buffalo wing sauce.  I only used enough dressing to cover the pizza crust and mixed the wing sauce with shredded chicken.  I will definitely be making this recipe again!!!

WOW! We loved this pizza - so much that I made it a second time less than a week later. I couldn't find a prepared crust of that size so I bought a whole wheat dough ball, which was excellent with this pizza.   I also followed a recommendation of making the blue cheese dressing on this site(Bob's). It was FANTASTIC!!! I didn't put as much dressing or mozzarella on the pizza as it started to look a little overwhelming. My husband and I like to dip the pizza into the remaining blue cheese. Highly recommend making your own blue cheese to go with this pizza, well worth the extra effort. Thanks for this recipe, it is a keeper!!!

This was delicious.  I used several suggestions from other reviewers as well.  I made my own pizza dough (using beer instead of yeast, very easy and very good!), I baked the chicken in the oven and then shredded it.  I used Franks Hot Sauce, but I am not sure how much, used my own discretion, and used olive oil instead of butter.  I also mixed a little bit of the hot sauce into the blue cheese dressing before applying to the dough, to add a little tomato flavour, I only used enough dressing to cover the dough.  I added some other toppings, red onions, tomato and green onion.  At dinner time, I also put out some leftover dressing/hot sauce sauce for dipping!  I will definitely make this again!

Heaven on a pizza!  I love how the coolness of the blue cheese dressing complements the spicy chicken.  This pizza is rich and delicious, but definitely not for those counting calories!

The only way this recipe has a chance to be good is if you omit the dressing.  I didnt think it would be a winner with my family and I should have stuck to my gut feeling, what was I thinking?

Funny, I think some of my review was left out, whats wrong folks, some negative feedback is not going to kill you.

my husband said this was the best buffalo chicken pizza he's ever had.  I used only half a bottle of blue cheese, olive oil instead of butter, and yes...I soaked the chicken in the hot sauce first.   I also drizzled a little hot sauce over the pizza.  Delicious!!!!!

My husband was a little leery of this at first but said he would "try" it.  We both loved it.  I didn't add a whole bottle of dressing and used bbq with a little hot sauce (I'm pregnant and can't take the heat).  It was delicious.  This one is a keeper.

I feel bad writing a bad review - but this pizza was WAY TOO HOT!!  My husband thought it was just ok, but I couldn't eat a whole piece because my mouth was burning.  It might be better if I cut down on the hot sauce...but I don't think I'll try it again.  Sorry!

Usually read reviews before making stuff, but didn't this time - would have definately halved the blue cheese dressing if i had.  But otherwise a truly addictive taste!!  Will definately make again!  Yummy Yummy!

Very delicious!  I used a thin Boboli crust, and just used as much of the blue cheese dressing as I would use pizza sauce.  Very good recipe, thanks!

It sounds odd, so I almost didnt try it, but Im so glad I did! I was so good. I only used half a jar of dressing, and half a jar Franks Redhot bufflo wing sauce. I made it on a Boboli pizza crust and cooked it for 10 minutes. Quick, easy and delicious!!!!

This is an excellent recipe!I will use this one often. I continue to be mystified by people who rate recipes low yet didn't follow the directions. Is that the recipes fault or your fault.

I thought this recipe was pretty good. I used frozen pizza dough, instead of a prepared crust, and baked it for 10 minutes before adding the toppings and baking for another ten minutes. The only change I would make is to use a cheddar/monteray jack cheese instead of the mozzerella for a bit more zip.

This is the best pizza I have ever made, per my husband.  It was delicious! We love veggies so I added red onion, green pepper, and mushrooms.  Also, I seasoned the chicken with a little garlic salt and pepper. I used a regular Boboli crust but next time I'll buy the thin one as I found the crust to be a little thick. Also, definitely use less bleu cheese per other reviews.

This was AWESOME!  I mixed up some fresh hidden valley ranch dressing and spread a thin layer instead of blue cheese.  Then I had extra dressing for dipping.  Huge hit at my house.  Made 2 pizzas - left 1/2 of second pizza without hot sauce my 5 year old daughter LOVED it!  No leftovers.  Thank you for a great recipe.

This was good - but you need to follow the advise of everyone else and cut the amount of blue cheese dressing in half - and we are big blue cheese fans.  Will add this one to our favorites

This really didn't look appetizing. As I was cutting it, I was thinking, why did I make this? Even during my first few small bites, I wasn't sure, but the more you eat, the more you like it. We think it tastes like Domino's chicken kickers on a crust. I used a Boboli crust, about 3/4 cup peppercorn ranch dressing, 2 oz. of hot sauce, 2 small pinches of crushed red pepper, reduced fat mozzarella, and topped with sliced mushrooms. I did finely cube & shred the chicken. Baked for 12 minutes to get a slightly crisper crust. We couldn't eat a lot because it's spicy and rich.

Yum! My husband and I make this pizza quite often. If you use the Cookies Wings and Things sauce, it's a little less hot. Also, I use just as much bleu cheese dressing as I would use pizza sauce on a normal pizza. This is excellent.

Next time I will cut down on the butter, mine was very greasy.  The suggestion of topping with celery from another reviewer really completed the pizza.  Thanks for the tip!

This was very good.  I would recommend using half the amount of blue cheese.  I had to buy 2-8oz bottles and only used 1.  2 bottles would have definately been too much.  Will make this again.

yum, yum, yum! this was so good. i used a pillsbury pizza crust and pressed it out on a cookie sheet, and it was very thin so next time i will use two on one cookie sheet for a thicker crust. also i used light ranch instead of blue cheese, and only about 1/4 of a bottle. instead of hot sauce i used beano's chicken wing sauce and low fat mozzerela.

I used just enough Wish Bone Spring Onion flavored Ranch dressing to cover the crust, and I used Colby-Jack cheese. I also added more butter to the chicken wing sauce (to make it less spicy). The result was delicious - reminded me of the chicken finger subs they make in the Buffalo, NY area pizzerias.

This was AMAZING. I took a lot of tips from other reviewers and combined them. I cooked my cubed chicken in the butter (and added some celery salt) and then mixed the Frank's right into the skillet. While that was working, I blind-baked my crust (Boboli) for about 5 minutes. When that was done, I poured on the bleu cheese dressing (probably not a full 8 oz, just enough to thinly cover the crust), topped with chicken and cheese, and 10 minutes later had one of the best pizzas of my life. Next time, I think I would add some blue cheese crumbles too, since we are cheese fiends and I bet that would be awesome.

I have made this pizza for years, but I never thought of using the salad dressing. I had always just put the Buffalo chicken and it's sauce directly on the pizza dough with a cheese topping. The addition of the dressing is brilliant!! Kudos to Brown!

I did use ranch dressing and sherdded the chicken. I made 3 pizzas that night and the buffalo was the hit. It is very important to precook the pizza dough for a few minutes before building your pizza as the pizza is very moist.

i really enjoyed this with my modifications.. i used Chef John's Cauliflower Pizza crust from this site so i cut this recipe in half.. i used 3 oz of leftover rotisserie chicken for the breasts and half the melted butter (i used squeezable Parkay) and half the hot sauce (Frank's).. like other's i only spread a thin layer of blue cheese dressing on the crust.. i also used a little less than the cheese called for.. it was very good.. i topped with additional Frank's.. ty for the recipe

This was fantastic. I had some leftover buffalo chicken (homemade) that I shredded and added more (Frank's) hot sauce to. Used pre-shredded "pizza cheese." I think the biggest key was that I used my pizza stone - preheated for about an hour. Did not have to pre-cook my crust. Used ranch dressing on half and blue cheese (with extra blue cheese crumbles!) on the other half, due to family members' preferences.

Very easy and your able to add your own touch if you like. I used a VERY hot sauce and a special mozzarella cheese mix. Fried the chicken in extra virgin olive oil then added my butter after draining. I highly recommend this for any game day.

Made this today and it was fabulous! I made two different kinds to satisfy my family's palette. I used a light blue cheese dressing on one and a bacon blue cheese dressing with herbed Parmesan cheese on another. Add celery sticks on the side of your pizzas if you want it to feel like true buffalo style. ?

Made this tonight as one of our super bowl pizzas.  I was kind of nervous to try it. The only changes I made were using my own homemade crust which I always cook at 500 for 10 minutes. I also used a high end blue cheese dressing.  I used half a jar for half of a pizza. I think it came it great! I am very picky about blue cheese so I woukd either use a higher end dressing or make your own. I also would use homemade crust and a higher iven temo. My crust was not soggy at all.

I have just started trying to make pizza from scratch.  For the dough, I've used two different recipes from this site, but no one in my family liked them.  I ordered Wolfgang Puck pizza dough mix and used that today for this buffalo pizza.  THIS IS THE BEST!! From Wolfgang Puck's pizza dough, to the ingredients in this recipe. I only changed one thing....instead of store bought blue cheese dressing in a bottle, I took the suggestion of another reviewer, and made "Bill's Blue Cheese Dressing".  With the homemade blue cheese against the hot sauce, It turned out to be the best ever!!!!

Very very good! I used a "Stonefire Italian artisan pizza crust (pre-made) and left out the butter. I also used shredded chicken that was left over from one I had roasted. Took advice from other reviews and only added enough dressing to cover the crust and did not use a whole bottle. I will definitely make again!

Cecilia Miller...try ranch dressing.  A lot of places serve ranch instead of blue cheese with their wings.

What kind of cheese could be substituted for the bleu cheese?  My family doesn't like it.

Amazingly delicious! Added chopped celery to cooked chicken. Used Sweet Baby Rays Buffalo sauce mixed with marzetti's chunky blue cheese dressing both to coat chicken and celery and spreaded on crust. I baked a pre-made thick crust for 7 minutes before adding sauce and toppings then baked entire pizza another 6 minutes. One of the best, most flavorful pizzas I've ever had.

I made this with the bread machine pizza dough found on this site.  It couldn't have been easier and was delicious.  I used a little less than 3/4 of a cup of bottled blue cheese and used half mozzarella and half cheddar.  I cut up about 1/2 and onion and put that on as well.  So good.  So easy.

Adjusted as per other reviewers. 1/2 cup blue cheese dressing, 2 oz. buffalo wing sauce. Still a bit runny but delicious! Son asked me to make this every week!

I agree there was too much blue cheese, however once you lighten it up a bit it's a delicious recipe! I do like having celery with it, but on the side not cooked into the pizza. Just personal taste...I did add a bit of spinach to it. It was delicious! (I love spinach though lol)

made several substitutions based on the ingredients I had on hand.  1. used a large can of cooked chicken breast, well drained.  2. used 2oz Franks pepper sauce and 2 Tbsp butter on the meat.  3. for the "pizza sauce": I used about 2 parts lite ranch dressing to 1 part Franks, and then added about 2-3 Tbsp crumbled gorgonzola cheese (I didn't have blue cheese dressing, and we wanted it to be spicier).  I also pre-cooked the pizza crust: I used a refrigerated roll-out dough by Pillsbury that is an Artisan Wheat.  Absolutely delicious, and with a lot more kick than the original recipe.

Came out awesome. I made "Quick and Easy Pizza Crust" from this site, and one of them was this buffalo pizza! I made shredded ckn in a slow cooker beforehand (4 raw ckn breasts + 1 can cream of mushroom + 1 can cream of ckn + bay leaf/salt/pepper cooked for ~8 hrs then shredded). Followed the recipe for the toppings with the addition of ranch, red onion, bacon, and cheddar.

The combination of hot wing sauce and bleu cheese was what drew me to this recipe.  While the idea is great and the flavors appealing, as written, it doesn't work for me.  Half of the dressing is plenty for a 'sauce' layer.  Marinating the meat (sometimes we use shrimp) in wing sauce for a while in advance helps intensify the flavor significantly.  (I use Chef John's Buffalo wing sauce recipe - from this site.)  The addition of a handful of chopped celery and a handful of chopped red onion adds crunch and depth of flavor.  The mozzarella is a mistake for us - smothering the flavors that are really important.  Topping the pizza with bleu cheese crumbles instead makes for a much more intense and authentic flavor mix.

This was excellent! We used ranch instead of blue cheese and it was really really good. The only thing that I would change is but different things on it along with the chicken.

This was an okay dish. I did not like it with the Blue cheese. I should have followed other reviews and used Ranch instead of Blue cheese. Will be making this again without the blue cheese.

This was amazing.
Instead of buying a pre-made crust, I bought a packet to make it myself (saves on the cost) Also used left over chicken scraps from a whole chicken I made the previous weekend - so this was very cheap to make.
Ended up using probably closer to 3oz of hot sauce instead of 2 oz.
Will be making this again!!

This recipe is really good. I've made for friends and they loved it too. The only thing that I did not put on it is the blue cheese dressing, but I do have it on the side for dipping.  Thank you for the recipe.

I boiled, then simmered a pound of chicken strips for 15 mins.  I shredded the chicken.  I added red onions to the top.  I used Valentino's Pizza Crust from allrecipes.  I oiled the crust and addded italian seasoning before prebaking for 8 mins.  Then I put a half cup of blue cheese dressing.  It cooked for 12 mins.  We felt it needed an extra kick and drizzled low fat ranch on our pizza while eating it.  Really tasty!

Very good, simple recipe for buffalo chicken pizza.  Used ranch instead of blue cheese.  Spread some on the crust prior to baking and reserved the rest for dipping after the pizza was baked.  I would like to try this with blue cheese, however.  Maybe sprinkle some fresh blue cheese over the top with the mozzarella...

I used leftover chicken from the "Slow Cooker Buffalo Chicken Sandwiches" on this website.  This is definitely the way to go my friends.  I used Frank's Red Hot Wing Sauce (the best!) for the slow cooker recipe the night before, so the prep for this pizza was a whiz.  I always use Trader Joes's pizza dough, pre-bake crust for 8-10 minutes at 450 degrees.  I didn't use a whole bottle of blue cheese dressing- used just enough to cover crust as you would with traditional pizza. Topped that with the chicken and cheese and baked about 15-20 minutes til the cheese was melted.  Mmmmmm...so good!  Tastes great as leftovers the next day for lunch (try it cold- it's awesome!)

Loved this! I made it slightly differently, just because I'm not the biggest fan of bleu cheese. I spread ranch dressing on the crust, followed by the chicken mixture and topped with just a bit of mozzerella and colby/jack cheese. Turned out great!

This was really, really good.  I did NOT use a full bottle of salad dressing, though.  I did one side blue cheese and the other side ranch and used a much smaller amount of dressing.  I thought I would like the blue cheese better, but the ranch won all votes at our house.  Wimps in the house thought the chicken was too spicy, while others in the house thought it needed more spice.  I thought it was just about right.  Spice lovers simply added additional hot sauce to their slices.  Thank you for sharing this recipe that is definitely going into my recipe box for future use!

I mixed the chicken with Frank's Buffalo Wing Sauce. I used 1/2 cup ranch dressing and added about 1/4 cup blue cheese chunks. I was trying to cut the richness of the blue cheese but it was still too much. Can't imagine putting the whole bottle on. It didn't go over well at all. Way too rich.

Very good.  Pay attention to the ounces in the Blue Cheese dressing:  It only calls for an 8 oz bottle, the standard bottle of dressing is 16 ozs so yes, it is too much if you use a whole 16oz bottle.  8 oz was plenty, about 1 cup.  I used Franks Red Hot Buffalo sauce and it was perfect.  Cook your crust about 10 minutes before adding toppings and baking.  Delicious!!

My family loved it.  I omitted the butter....don't think you need it with all the cheese and other flavors.  I served the pizza with a dollup of blue cheese in the center and sprinkled with green onions.

Very good recipe.  I will often times switch out the blue cheese dressing for ranch and it's wonderful either way!

a definite hit.  lightened it by using whole wheat pizza crust, left out the butter and used light blue cheese dressing.  oh, also used reduced fat mozzarella and cheddar.  it turned out great!

This recipe was delish! I changed a few things though. I used rottisserie chicken instead of chicken breasts and I used ranch dressing instead of blue cheese.

I like to make this with crescent roll dough and cut up very small for appetizers.  This is very rich and fattening but delightful.

This was a crowd pleaser!  I used homemade ranch dressing, and I'm sure that made a significant difference in the end result.  Bottled ranch is just a different critter from the scratch version.  I made a quick crust in my food processor which produced a wonderful crunchy crust.  This will be a regular addition to our family meal line up.

My first time to leave a review and this was pretty awesome.  Do a search on All Recipe's and make your own crust, very simple.  I grabbed Monterey Jack instead of Mozzarella at the store by mistake, hey, they both begin with "M" and it worked out great.  I did coat the crust before pre-baking for 4 minutes with italian dressing. This is a definite keeper for a quick  thing for the kids bringing friends over or Sunday night.  Add about any leftover veggies or meats and some sauce and cheese and you are done, they like making it also.

Pretty good...I'm not a huge fun an of Blue Cheese, so I think I will use Ranch dressing next time. I sautéed cubed chicken with oil and garlic then added the cooked chicken to the hot sauce/butter mixture and let it soak for about 15 minutes before putting it on the pizza. I also added freshly ground pepper to the chicken for a little more flavor. My boyfriend loved it!

This was good.  We only had a ball of dough, so it was a bit more work.  Still good.  Wish we had used the cheddar though...

Awesome! I fist baked the dough. Combined the chicken, butter & hot sauce in pan & cooked until chick was done. Put the mixture on the cooked dough with a little extra hot sauce & mozzarella& cheddar cheese. Baked until cheese was melted. I served it like that with side of blue cheese & ranch for people to pour on top. Big hit!

THIS WAS AWESOME! i did things a little different. I used ranch instead, (me and my hubby HATE blue cheese) After i cooked and cubed the chicken, i put the chicken and the wing sauce together and let it set for about 2 hours. And made my own pizza crust. The whole pizza was gone. I love this recipe.

This was really awesome.  I'm not a great cook and it turned out great.  My boyfriend is still talking about it.  We grilled the chicken first, then tossed it in Frank's Red Hot wing sauce; used ranch dressing, omitted the butter, and used some mozzerella cheese.  Don't really need a lot of cheese though since the other flavors are so intense.  Will prob cut down on the cheese even more next time to save calories.  And also used thin ready-made pizza crust to also save calories.  Absolutely wonderful!  Reheated well too -- not that I got any!

My boyfriend and I thought this was really worth 4.5 stars as it was very good.  The only reason we did not rate it a 5 is because we would have liked it a little hotter/spicier than this recipe made it.  We will make it again and attempt to make it a little hotter next time.

The only changes I made was that I marinated the chicken with little oil and chicken rub before cooking it. Also, added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce to the hot sauce & then cooked it for a few minutes by adding it to the cooked chicken in the skillet instead of mixing it in the bowl.

I used Boboli pizza crust, and mixed marinara sauce and 1/2 cup blue cheese dressing together.  I also added some chopped sweet onions, mushrooms, and green peppers.  Topped with Italian shredded cheese.

My online cooking forum, Our Table Talk Dot Com included this recipe in our monthly community cook along for January and I made it for dinner this evening. I'll say that it is a very good pizza. It is much like you would expect it to be.. I believe anyone would enjoy it the same as they might enjoy buffalo wings. If you are a lover of buffalo wings, you'll enjoy the pizza. If not, it may not be for you. Plenty of heat and plenty of that wonderful blue cheese flavor plus melted gooey cheese. Being a cheese fan, that's always a winner.  I used extra chunky blue cheese dressing and happy I did.  The blue cheese chunks on the pizza were delicious.  Would I make it again? Probably not. But that's just because I find making 10 or 12 wings to be less fuss. If I was having dinner somewhere and it was being served, I'd certainly eat my share!  If you like wings, give it a go. You'll find it very tasty. 3 and a half stars.

Very good. I bought Pillsbury dough in a can and baked it for 8 minutes before putting the toppings on to avoid a soggy crust. I used Bill's Blue Cheese dressing recipe from here and Red Hot hot wing sauce and really enjoyed the outcome!

Pizza was ok. It taste fine. But there wasn't an overwhelming flavor of buffalo chicken. I think we can find something better.

This was awesome! I used a little less Blue Cheese Dressing--maybe about 1/2 C or so, and topped the pizza with some green onions for a little crunch. I also melted 4 TBS of butter and mixed with 1/2 C Red Hot and coated the chicken in that, straining the chicken before adding it to the pizza to cut down on any accumulated liquid. I also pre-baked the crust until set, then added the toppings and baked another 15 minutes or so. This kept the crust firm and crispy. We will definitely make this again, thank you!!!

My kids love this Pizza. Or maybe it's the Red Hot either way there is never any left. Like chicken wings with cheese and bread.

Amazing!!! My family loved this. We are not big blue cheese eaters in this family so I was a bit skeptical about this and made 2 pizzas, one with blue cheese and (based on the suggestions of another reviewer) one with ranch. My family devoured the blue cheese pizza and loved the contrast it added to the buffalo sauce. They liked this one much better. This was a awesome recipe that was easy to make and will definitely become a FAM FAV!

This was sooo good! I used the cheap Jiffy crust, and used those directions to cook it. Make sure you grease the pan. I prebaked the crust, then put on just enough ranch to cover crust, bout 1/2 cup. Put the already cooked and seasoned chicken/hot sauce mixture on top. I used Ken's hot wing marinade and a little Franks. Put some cheddar AND moz on top. Cooked about 20 minutes, until the crust was just perfect. Then I put a little more Franks on top. It was DELICIOUS.

This is fabulous! I have made this several times, and I agree with some of the other postings--don't bother if you aren't using Frank's Hot Sauce! This is great for football season when we have people over: can't beat beer and buffalo chicken pizza!

I'm definitely not a spicy/hot person, but I couldn't stop eating this pizza even though my mouth was on fire! lol The brand of hot sauce and blue cheese can make or break this pizza. I highly recommend Franks Buffalo Wings Hot Sauce. It does have a kick, but it's way too good to pass up! For me, my spicy/hot tolerance is quite low. I would rate Franks hottness a 7 out of 10. My boyfriend who has an extremely high tolerance, rates it a 3-4. I have made this twice, second time using a different, milder, hot sauce. It wasn't nothing compareable to the first time I made this. So stick with Franks! :D I have been told by family that this is the best pizza they have ever tasted. Even my picker father agreed, who is a major pizza guru lol. I havent found the perfect blue cheese yet, but hope so to make this pizza beyond amazing :) Thanks for the wonderful pizza!

I thought it was really good and was a nice change to traditional pizza.  I prefer the taste of ranch over blue cheese dressing so that is the reason I gave it four stars.

better than the so called pizza shops. followed other recomendations and pre cooked pizza dough(not the pre-cooked stuff),and also only used enough blue cheese to cover crust. Don't use plain hot sauce, grab a bottle of Frank's Wing Sauce, also don't use dressings from the salad dressing section of your supermarket, get the stuff next to the salad bags(ie Marie's or Marzettie's) cost more but tastes way better  You can also subsitute ranch dressing for blue cheese.

This was just ok for us.  For some reason I got a bitter taste while eating this.  After much thought I think it may have been the grilled chicken.  I also thought it was salty tasting.  I used Ken's bottled blue cheese and Frank's wing sauce.  I'm not sure if the combo of dressings made it salty.  Thanks for sharing we like to try new things.

As with others cut back on the dressing.  I do prefer the ranch to blue cheese (just a personal preference).  A change I made was to make my wing sauce (1/4 cup Texas Pete, 1/4 cup butter, dash garlic powder, dash of black pepper, combined in a sauce pan) and marinate the chicken in the sauce for an hour up to 24 hours before cooking the pizza's.  I also top them with green onion after baking.  I have been making this for over a year it is an awesome recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

Awesome pizza. Only changed the dressing, used Ranch instead of Bleu Cheese (since I'm the only one who likes Bleu Cheese). My family inhaled two large pizzas. Definitely a keeper.

Very Good, of course I used only about a cup of Blue Cheese (my husband suggests more next time) and I seasoned my chicken breasts with some garlic power and onion poweder before roasting.  It added an extra depth of flavor which took it over the top! I also used a Boboli crust because we dont like soggy pizza! We agreed that this was better than any we have had "out"!

Not quite 5 star for us. Used rotisserie chicken, as suggested. Also used the Frank's wing sauce and Ken's blue cheese dressing. Finally precooked crust a bit as suggested.  Turned out very good.

Nice quick meal - great with a salad. I opted to use Ranch dressing instead ... hubby got food poisoning from Bleu Cheese years ago and won't go near it any more. I marinated the chicken pieces in Frank's hot sauce over night, then cooked it and tossed it with additional hot sauce and melted butter before adding to pizza. This gave it a more in depth flavor. Also, I added shredded parmesan to the mozzarella. For the crust, I used a stone baked flat bread with Asiago and Parmesan. Yum!! If you can find this in your grocery store, I highly recommend it.

Love this pizza!  It is now a new family favorite.  I usually make my own crust in the bread machine.  My family prefers Ranch Dressing over Bleu Cheese.  Also, I use Franks Red Hot wing sauce and toss it in to my cut up chicken and then I don't have to melt butter.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe. I did do a few things differently however. First, I shredded the chicken. I melted the butter in a pan and added the hot sauce & chicken and heated it through. I then added just enough blue cheese dressing to cover the pizza crust. After that I added the chicken and sprinkled with colby jack cheese and then added the mozzarella on top. Tasted great!!

Three pieces of chicken was too much, it covered the pizza completely, I would use two pieces next time.   For the chicken I cut them in half and cooked them with the butter and Red Hot in a covered pan on low heat, while the crust rising and oven was warming. The timing was perfect, dinner was served in an hour and twenty minutes.   I made my own crust "Jay's Signature Pizza Crust" was great (I used Kosher salt for the "Salt" listed).   If you use a pizza stone to cook the pizza, preheat the stone in the oven for an hour. Coat the bottom of the crust with Yellow Corn Meal. It you put the pizza on the without it, it will not come off easily.

Really good recipe!  I used my own homemade blue cheese dressing and spread just enough to cover the crust.  I also added sliced red onion and a mixture of grated sharp cheddar and montarey jack  cheese.  It's now a weekly request at my house!!!

I gave this recipe 5 stars because is it ultimately my new favorite pizza! I did make a few changes to my own pizza.  I bought the fresh bleu cheese dressing in the produce aisle in a 24-ounce jar, used about 1/3 of it on the crust. Then, I topped with the buffalo chicken and sliced mozarella. Let it cook, and sprinkled more Frank's red hot sauce on top of the cooked pizza, and dipped it in more bleu cheese because I am a big bleu cheese fan.      Be sure to let the pizza cool down enough to get the full effect of all flavors!!

This was very good! The only problem was that the blue cheese dressing was over-powering. We will be making this again..but will use half blue cheese and half ranch. Thank you for this recipe!

JUST ADD BACON!!! TRUST ME YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!! I used half of the recipe to make 1/2 of my 16 in pizza. ***WARNING*** If you have small kids (mine are 4 years old and 11 month old) use only 1 or 2 Tablespoons of hot sauce for a whole pizza and definitely less than 1 Tablespoon for 1/2 a pizza. Next time I make this, I'll have to follow my own advice. :) Also, I used a little left over cheddar cheese on top of the mozzarella cheese. Finally, I used homemade blue cheese as the recipe suggested but next time I'll try with homemade ranch. The blue cheese was really good though.

YUM!  I used prepackaged pizza crust and cut up rotisserie chicken.  I also didn't have any Frank's hot sauce, just hot sauce like you would put on tacos, but it was AWESOME (but seriously spicy).  Definitely will make this again!

We found this a little greasy. Overall, I liked it and my husband did not. Will probably try it again but try to reduce some of the grease.

Pretty darn good. I made just a few adjustments after reading some reviews. I used a pilsbury crust. I pre-baked it for about 7 minutes and then put the ingredients on top. I also used ranch instead of blue cheese. I also shredded the chicken. Turned out pretty awesome!

This pizza is fantastic!! I marinated the chicken with a super spicy bourbon bbq sauce I picked up in Kentucky while on vacation. Talk about flaming hot!! The pizza was absolutely delicious! I will be making this one again for sure.

I have found paradise and this is it!  Loved the pizza.  Since I am all about bleu cheese, I added some bleu cheese crumbles on top of the dressing.  Next time, I will add more hot sauce.  The amount listed in the recipe was not quite enough for me.  Very good, thanks for sharing!

This recipe is SUPER!!  We loved it!  My changes:  browned the chicken, then simmered in my homemade V-8 juice until the chicken fell apart.  I drained it until cool, then shredded it.  I then followed the recipe.  The pizza's were really, really good!  Can't wait to make it again.

Best pizza I've ever had!  This was absolutely amazing!  I can't give it enough stars!!  :D  I don't normally like pizza that much (not a marinara sauce fan), but I LOOOOOOVE "buffalo stuff", so I wanted to give this a go.  My husband was amazed!  I made the crust from scratch (Quick and Easy Pizza Crust on this site) and the bleu cheese dressing as well (Chunky Blue Cheese Dressing, also on this site).  I poached my chicken breasts (just used 2), shredded them, and mixed them with wing sauce, butter and garlic salt.  Layered the homemade crust with bleu cheese dressing, then piled on the chicken, then topped with mozzarella, some sharp cheddar, and a little bit of a 5 Italian cheese blend.  I put the whole thing on my Pizzazz Pizza Oven and baked it for about 18 minutes.  It was SOOOO YUMMY!  The only thing I would do differently next time (and there will be a next time!) is to use a little less cheese on top - it honestly didn't need very much!  Thanks for the recipe!!  :D

Excellent pizza!  Even husband thought it was great.  I only used 2 chicken breast halves, which was perfect.  As suggested by others, I didn't use a whole bottle of blue cheese dressing - used about 1/3.  For the sauce, I used 1 tbsp butter and 4 tbsp Frank's Hot Sauce which coated the chicken perfectly.  I will definitely make this again and again.

OH MY GOODNESS!! I thought this was gonna be good, but I was wrong....IT WAS FANTASTIC!! I used the Boboli crust, Franks hot sauce and Ken's chunky blue cheese (all our favorites), and I just cannot say enough about it, it gives us our pizza and wings craving all rolled up into one and is out of this world! THANK YOU!!!

This pizza was awesome! The only change I made was to add sliced red onions to the chicken/hot sauce mix and used ranch instead of blue cheese dressing. I used the Frank's Red Hot Sauce and used a little more than the recipe suggested (that's how we like our buffalo wings). Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent!  I made some minor changes, I used a pillsbury crust, I baked it for 6 minutes with no ingredients then added the rest.  I went with 4/5 cups of Ranch instead of the Blue Cheese, I also added 1/4 of an onion and Louisiana hot sauce to give it some extra punch.  I felt like I was eating a combination of a Buffalo Wild Wings hotwing and pizza which is a very good thing!

This is delicious! We marinated the chicken in wing sauce and poached it in the liquid then shredded it and mixed it with more fresh wing sauce. I used Bill's blue cheese dressing from this site after reading the reviews, and it was also great. We didn't have any mozzerella so I used cheddar,  pepper jack, parmesan and romano all shredded. We prebaked the store bought crust to curb sogginess. Thanks for sharing this recipe..YUM

This is so creative and YUMMY!!!!! I made it back in January and I can't believe I didn't right a review immediately! Since first making it, I have had it 3 more times, it is one of those things that you just crave and HAVE to have!! Sorry, but I am not a blue cheese fan, so I used ranch, and I don't put as much as the recipe calls for. My husband oves blue cheese, so I make him his own and he loves this recipe too! GREAT recipe! Thanks!

The problem with this recipe is the blue cheese in with hot sauce :-( My little sisters love pizza and they took one bite and clowned me badd!!!! I suggest if choosing this recipe that the blue cheese & hot sauce be replaced with some type of barbecue sauce or combo of sauces you like.

We liked the flavor of this pizza! I did it not quite the way the recipe suggests, that's why only 4 stars. I omitted the butter altogether. I cooked the chicken using Nance's Hot Wings sauce in the rotisserie, so it was very moist. After cubing it, I poured more sauce on it and let it sit while I made the pizza shell which I prebaked for 8 minutes. After topping it with lots of dressing, but no where near a whole bottle, I put the chicken and whatever sauce was left on the dressing.  Then I covered it with 6 Italian Cheeses which comes preshredded. It's a more flavorful taste than just mozzarella, but still has the melting quality because mozzarella is one of the 6 cheeses!

This was a great idea for pizza lovers who like a bite!
I got an already roasted in store chicken (the meat has so much flavor and is tender!),shredded it and soaked it over night in "Frank's Hot Sauce". You won't need the butter.
When I put it on the pizza, I then sprinkled more hot sauce on it. 
I also used a mix of Jack and Colby cheese as well as Mozzarella.
I had some homemade chunky blue cheese dressing that I brushed on the crust. You really don't need much. The pizza could get soggy.
 Yum. Was a hit at a Super Bowl party and will be made again.

This is a quick and easy dinner!  I usually boil the chicken ahead of time.  Then I cube it and let it soak up the sauce overnight.  That way when I get home from work the next day all I have to do is assemble the pizza.  We always use ranch rather than blue cheese dressing.  We eat this a couple times a month, its so good, quick and easy!  ;-)

Wow! This is so good, although we did not have to use the entire bottle of blue cheese dressing. I think it would have been way too sloppy. I'd recommend using about half of the bottle or just eyeball it.

Loved this and the family loved it. I used a Pillsbury thin crust and ranch dressing. I used more chicken than called for and added a red onion. I used a mixture of both mozzerella and some cheddar - and closer to two cup. Sauce was our favorite - half cup hot sauce (Franks) and half cup butter, with a little garlic sauce added. I've tried sauteed onions and raw - both are awesome. Suggestions: mushrooms, tomatoes, artichokes.

This pizza is wonderful.  BBQ chicken is still my favorite but this curbs my craving for wings.  I used Rhodes bread dough for my crust (quick, easy and so good).  Spooned on the light ranch dressing too my taste.  Melted about 1 Tbsp butter in a skillet added the hot sauce (about 2 Tbsp) and the chicken and heated it through because my chicken was frozen.  I used about 2 chicken breasts so the pizza was not heavy with chicken but it was enough for me.  Sprinkle on the cheese.  Loved it!!

I was skeptical, but the pizza is very good and is a nice change of pace.  I changed a few things... used ranch dressing as the base and sprinkled crumbled blue cheese on the top.  Also, next time I would use a little more hot sauce.  Overall, I would recommend this recipe; thank you for sharing.

This pizza was good, I think it'll be better the next time I make it, and I'd definately make it again.  I feel that I should've cut the chicken up smaller, the chunks were kind of big. My daughter felt that the 8oz. of blue cheese was to much, next time I'll use a little less, like 4oz., I don't think my crust was quite 16in. I used pillsbury pizza crust that you just rolled onto a cookie sheet (making my pizza square, which was good). The crust was great, I'd definately use that again. I will definately make this again, the next time it should be a 5 star pizza!

Using Frank's Red Hot on the chicken was the perfect choice. Used 1/2 blue cheese & 1/2 ranch & neither hubbs or I really cared for the taste. BUT, if I were to make it again, as we both liked the taste of the chicken, we would use BBQ sauce instead. 3 stars for the chicken & simplicity of the recipe.

I had this pizza for the first time reluctanctly in NY. They make all kinds of pizza phenomenal upstate. This recipe is a way that I can make it in WA where the pizza is not nearly as good. In fact I haven't been able to find this pizza anywhere out here. I think for a quick tip making it with buffalo chicken strips would be just as good since that's how they make it out there and it's unbeatable. I made this superbowl Sunday and it was a hit!

First, let me say that this is absolutely awesome!!  However, I think the reviews that say "if you love buffalo chicken wings and you love pizza, you will love this" are not quite right.  I love wings and pizza, but this does not taste like either one.  It is a tasty perfection of its own!!  Try it, you'll like it!

I made this recipe using "Jay's Signature Pizza Crust" recipe from this site and "Bill's Blue Cheese Dressing" also from this site.  Wow.  This recipe surpassed my expectations. Definitely a 5-star rating.  Great for a party or family dinner.  Thanks for sharing this treasure.

This was a huge hit! Use a good blue cheese dressing or ranch if you like. I spread out a few table spoons of dressing over the dough just to lightly cover. Too much and your pizza will be soft and chewy. I shreded a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store with Anchor Bar wing sauce..(the origional wing sauce if you can find it) spread over pizza, top with motz and a few blue cheese crumbles and you have an excellent pie for those of you who love pizza, and hot wings!

Loved It!!! We used Boboli's crust, Franks hot sauce and blue cheese dressing.  I forgot the butter and it didn't seem to matter.  I will be trying ranch next time as my kids said "it was good even though they didn't like the funny taste in the sauce."  Don't worry about measuring the dressing or using the whole bottle.  Just pour it straight from the bottle right onto the crust until you have the amount you want!  So easy and so awesome!

I, too, cut back on the dressing (about 1/2 of a small bottle of Kraft chunky blue).  And I happened to have some authentic buffalo wing sauce to toss the chicken in. Finally, I added some crumbled bacon and fresh mushroom slices.  Amazing.  Satisfied two favourite food cravings in one dish!

Loved this pizza!  I did substitute ranch dressing for the bleu cheese dressing as my family doesn't care for bleu cheese and did not use the whole bottle as others suggested.  I also used 1/2 sharp cheddar for the cheese as suggested.  I will be making this again for sure.

Ok, this is now my all time favorite pizza!  I put a thin layer of cream cheese on top of the crust (we used Freshetta refrigerated, thin), then a layer of blue cheese dressing, next the shredded chicken coated with Frank's Buffalo Wing sauce and then finally a layer of mozzarella cheese.  This was so easy and delicious.  Brought the leftovers to work and I think it was even better the next day!  I'll make again and again!

My husband and I made this the other night and it was very yummy.  We both love spicy food, so we even added a little more hot sauce to give it more kick.  I took someone's advice and put a layer of mozz cheese on first before the dressing to keep the crust from getting soggy and it worked just fine.  Also, I couldn't imagine using the whole 16 oz of dressing...we used just enough to give it a saucy coating.  Can't wait to make this again....

WOW!  This was awesome!   I used the 12 in. boboli thin crust and only 4 tbsps of good blue cheese dressing. I added 2 minced garlic cloves to the chicken mixture. I sprinkled with fresh parsley after cooking...really great!!!   I was pressed for time, so I bought packaged grilled chicken breast strips and just hand shredded them myself before coating in hot sauce/butter.  It cut the time down from stated 55min to just 20 min!

This was great!  I added extra crumbled blue cheese on top with mozzarella.  Only used enough wing sauce (Frank's Red Hot-Yum!) to moisten the chicken and just enough dressing to barely coat the pizza crust.  This was super yummy!  Even my finiky 13-year old liked it without the blue cheese.

This recipe was great.  I only used about half of the dressing.  I made one with blue cheese and the other with ranch.  They were both awesome. Will be making it again soon.

Delish!  I made a lot of changes.  I only used two breasts and still had left over meat. I made my own half whole wheat crust using the recipe from hillbillyhousewife.com.  I used Red Hot's Buffalo Sauce.  I used ranch instead of blue cheese and only used enough to make a thick coating - a whole bottle would've been way way way too much.  It turned out great!  Thanks for the recipe!

Turned out pretty good with an 8 oz. bottle of blue cheese dressing instead of 16 oz.  I have a feeling that 16 oz. would have been way too much, and maybe even dripping off the crust.  Next time I will use more hot sauce though, but I should warn you that when I go to Bateman's I order hot wings that are called "Atomic" ;) I used the Boboli thin crust for this.

This was a great recipe I added onions,green peppers and olives and spread garlic butter on the crust that I precooked before adding the toppings. I also made one for my wife she's not a buffaloed chicken person but I put alfredo sauce on hers we both loved it.
Will make again.

Being born and bred in Buffalo, I think this does a very good job of getting that fabulous Buffalo style wing flavor, but what I think would make this over the top would be the addition of some shredded lettuce and diced fresh tomatoes after it comes right out of the oven. MMMMM MMMMMM, tasty!

We were looking for a new recipe for the big game this weekend, but when we saw this, and read the reviews, we couldn't WAIT to try it, so made it last night. TO DIE FOR!  I have friends who are weird and don't like bleu cheese, so I'll make two this weekend, (one with ranch)but for my money, nothing goes better with hot wings than a bleu cheese dip.  Excellent recipe!  One note to reviewer Nick - we laughed so much when we read your changes.  It's not that your suggestions would make a bad pizza (in fact, we're going to try it out) but it doesn't remotely resemble the original recipe!!

this was soooo good, my kids even ate it. They are 4 and 7.
I used boboli thin crust, and Franks Red Hot (love that stuff), and it came out perfect. I also didn't use an entire bottle of dressing, probably only about 1/2  and it was plenty. Will definitely make this again.

I just made this for the first time.  I gave it to the hardest critics I know  KIDS, they loved it and so did I.  I didn't have time for homemade blue cheese dressing, so I used bottled.  If it was this good with the bottled, it must be incredible with homemade dressing

I am truly surprised... I really enjoyed this! I had leftover chicken legs in the fridge from dinner the night before, and decided to cut the meat up for this pizza. I used Texas Pete, and skipped the butter. I also used the Peppercorn Ranch because my husband is deathly allergic to Bleu Cheese. I used a mix of Cheddar and motz. cheese... it came out great. This would be GREAT for entertaining or for the "game".  Will make again!! Thanks!

I thought we would like this, since we both love bleu cheese, but we really didn't care for it. I'm not sure why, it just didn't appeal to us. This doesn't mean it's a bad recipe, just a matter of personal taste.

In theory, I should have LOVED this.  I love blue cheese!  I did follow the advice of many reviewers and reduced the dressing.  The pizza did look pretty, but the flavors were all too strong....together.  The dressing made the whole thing sloppy as soon as it was cut, so the toppings just slid off.  With so many good reviews, I thought this would have been a keeper.  Not so much.

I tried this a long time ago but never got around to reviewing it until now. I like spicy but it was TOO spicy and I could barely enjoy it. I love blue cheese dressing so that wasn't so much of as problem. I probably would order delivery pizza if I wanted a good buffalo chicken pizza. I will never try this again.

Haven't tried this recipe exactly, b/c we have our own.  We get doughballs from a local Italian restaurant. Spread it out on pan and coat with extra virgin olive oil. We use the original Anchor Bar sauce from Buffalo, NY.  Mix that with about a quarter stick of melted butter.  Mix that with chopped up baked chicken.  Spread some of the chicken wing sauce (w/o butter) over the crust. Put lots of mozzarella and cheddar cheese. Then spread chicken mixture around pizza. Bake at 350 for 15-20 min.  Best chicken wing pizza ever!

Prebaked a Pillsbury crust for about eight minutes, used ranch dressing (i just don't like blue cheese)and much less than what was called for, not even half the bottle.  Seasoned and grilled one HUGE chicken breast, cubed and stirred into 4 Tablespoons hot sauce and 4 Tablespoons butter.  Topped with a cheddar mozzarella blend. Cooked for another 10 minutes. Boyfriend and I both enjoyed it.  He dipped his in dressing as well.

This was very good. I took the advice of other viewers and used canned pizza dough. I precooked the dough and instead of dressing I mixed a package of ranch dressing into softened cream cheese. I spread this on the crust then layered with chicken and mozzrella cheese. Yum, Yum Yum!!

This was awesome.  Used Frank's Red hot and only about 1/2 bottle of blue cheese.  Also used leftover rotisserie chicken which I shredded & a pillsbury pizza crust.  Soooooo good!
Next time I'll try Bill's Blue Cheese dressing recipe.  Just add a salad & you have a quick & easy weeknight dinner! Thanks

I used this recipe for the idea and adapted it to my tastes.  I used a kroger brand crust (taste better than boboli)then I mixed together 2 pkgs 1/3 less fat cream cheese, about 2tbsp of buffalo wing spice, a couple dashes of Frank's and 2 heaping tbsps of mayo (I made 2 pizzas).  I spread this on the crust then shook a few more drops of Franks on top, on top of this I place chicken I had marinated for a night and cooked in nothing but Franks, then I layered 1/2 sharp cheddar and 1/2 motz. cheese, sliced carrots and celery on the cheese and as a final topping I sprinkled the pizzas with blue cheese crumbles.  This was so tasty, there was none left and several people asked me for the recipe.

Way too much blue cheese for me.  It completely overpowered everything else.  That said, I can see how this would have been delicious if I had just used less dressing, so I'm going to try using only about half of what the recipe calls for next time.

YUM! I did change a few things.  Based on other reviews saying that the dressing was too much, I mixed softened cream cheese, some blue cheese crumbles and about 1T of dry ranch dressing mix.  I also used cheddar instead of mozzarella.

This recipe was great.  I made a couple of changes though.  First of all, I sliced the chicken into thin strips and doused with hot sauce.  Then I dredged the chicken in flour and sauteed.  Once cooked, I doused with more hot sauce.  I also added half a cup of mayo to the blue cheese dressing.  Made the "sauce" much thicker and creamier.

I am so sorry to be the party pooper and rate this recipe so low.  I made it for lunch today with high hopes.  I love pizza and buffalo wings.  But these two do not mix together.  I am sorry for rating so low, but it did not taste good to me.  Thank you for taking the time to share your recipe.

Soooooo good!  I also use only about 1/2 cup of dressing, and drain chicken a little bit before putting it on the pizza, can get a little greasy.  Serve w/ extra dressing on side to dip.  Yummy!!

Of course, I made some changes to suit my taste. I sauteed the fresh breast in a light butter and then added the hot sauce. I used 3 oz light cream cheese, light ranch and hot sauce as a sauce. 
I will make it again.
thanks

OMG.. This is the best pizza I ever had!!!  I greased a cookie sheet and I used the refrigerated crust in the can and baked that for 8 mins as per the directions.  Then I added just enough bottled blue cheese to cover the crust and added the buffalo chicken (which I used extra hot bottled buffalo sauce).  No need to make your own.  I put a combo package of mozzarella and cheddar which made it taste fantastic!!!!  I baked for approximately another 8 mins and it was done to perfection.  Can't wait to make this one again and again!!!!!!!!!

This pizza was very good! I took some reviewers suggestions (unfortunately) and only put about 1/4 jar of blue cheese on the pizza. I think maybe 3/4 of a jar would have been better - I couldn't even taste the blue cheese!!! I also think that the chicken could have used a bit more hot sauce, but that's just personal preference (used Texas Pete's).  I used Jay's pizza crust from this site and it was just thick enough so that the pizza wasn't soggy - I prebaked it for about 6 minutes. Yummy!!!

Oh my gosh, totally digging this pizza!!!  I didn't have any more chicken breast, but I did however have frozen boneless "chicken wings".  I made my own dough (Pizza Dough I).  After reading the reviews, I also made the following alterations: 1. I used about 3/4 cup of ranch, which I think I will make a full cup next time since some of it dried out; 2. I added 2 cloves of crushed garlic to the wings (which I chopped up with my food chopper by the way); & 3. I only added about 1 tablespoon of hot sauce to 3 tablespoons of butter ~ but I wish I had added more.  All in all, it was wonderful & I will DEFINATELY be making it again...and again, and again...

My boyfriend loves this recipe! I usually buy a thick crust and use a lot less dressing like the other reviewers say. If you don't have a thick crust, the pizza tends to fall apart when you try to pick it up. Otherwise, yummy!

i made this last year for a Christmas party and the only bad thing was that i only made one pizza!!! everyone loved it and have made it several times since, usually two at a time. the only thing i done differently was used ranch dressing and cut down on the amount of dressing and the last time i made it, i used Moore's buffalo wing sauce.the times before i used the butter and texas pete hot sauce. both ways are delish!!

I tried this recipe. I make my own crust and I was a little worried . It turned out excellent. I did however use the bottled brand name wing sauce and added a few drops of extra hot.Also I omitted the butter. I used a jar of ultimate bleu cheese dressing.This is a keeper.
Hubby went wild over it..

Good recipe!  I use the recipe for bill's blue cheese(this site), I think the dressing makes it!!!  I also just get a bottle of texas pete buffalo wing sauce, leave out the butter and marinate cooked shredded chicken for a couple of hours!  Sometimes I add a red onion.  Good recipe! THanks

OMG - This was the most amazing pizza we've ever had.  The entire family raved about it!  I made homemade pizza crust using "Jay's Pizza Crust" recipe from this site.  As other reviewers mentioned, I used just enough dressing to cover the crust and topped it with a Cheddar/Mozzarella blend.  Unbelievably good!!!

This is now my family's favorite pizza! Like others, I precook my pizza dough 6 minutes, add my toppings, and then finish cooking about 8 more minutes. I find a 9x13 pizza only needs about half the bottle of dressing, with the rest available for dipping.  I use about 1 lb of chicken with only about 1 oz of hot sauce (my husband and kids don't have the Cajun gene). Great pizza - thanks for sharing!!!

My family just loved this pizza...If you love chicken wings, you will love this pizza. However,  I did cut back on the dressing...I used just enough to coat the pizza crust and it turned out great!  This is now a family favorite.

This pizza is so good.  Couldn't believe I made it at home.  I used homemade pizza dough, brushed it with evoo and garlic, baked 10 min first as someone suggested. Used Bill's blue cheese dressing and added thin sliced tomatoes, diced green onions.  A 5 star recipe, a keeper.  I cook my pizza on a stone.

Too bad but this is one of those recipes that sounds good since I love buffalo wings and pizza, but it just doesn't go together.   If I try it again, I'll add sliced celery for a little crunch.

Very tasty, but very rich.  I used pizza dough from Trader Joe's and Frank's Red Hot sauce.  Next time, I too will use less salad dressing.

Sorry - We didn't care for this pizza at all.  I thought the blue cheese dressing ruined it...I may attempt again using ranch.

Maybe I did something wrong, but my family finally agreed on one thing with this one...no one ate it.  I think there was waaaaaay too much dressing and I only used 8 oz.  Sorry, but this one didn't do it for me!  Awesome idea though & I will be trying to figure out a way to make a buffalo chicken pizza that we like.

this was alright. maybe it was the blue cheese that i used. i'll try it with ranch if i decide to make this again. i used only half the bottle of blue cheese dressing and used shredded chicken, which was left over from the ''Spicy Rapid Roast Chicken'' i got from this site. overall, it was just okay.

Very delicious pizza, the only setback being how messy it was. Do not be taken aback by how much hot sauce and blue cheese dressing it uses. They balance out to make a great pizza!

This pizza was good but nothing great.  Definitely cut back on the blue cheese and we added onion and shredded the chicken instead of cubed.

This was a very easy recipe to make. My husband and I also chose to add black olives and red onion to our pizza and we only used half of the b.c. dressing that it called for. Absolutely delicious!! We'd make it again for sure.

I made two: one with ranch for a daughter who does not care for blue cheese and one with blue for the rest of us. The ranch was okay. The blue cheese one was so yummy! I used Boboli crusts (I never tried them before...we liked them a lot) and spread them with about 3/4 cup of dressing on each. A whole bottle would be too much for a Boboli sized crust. I crumbled more blue cheese on top of the blue cheese dressing as we like lots of it. It was great...make sure you soak the chicken in the hot sauce/butter mixture for a few minutes before you top the pizza. I served them up with extra dressing for dipping the crusts and celery sticks. Thanks for the recipe, it's a new favorite.

I served this as a last minute dinner option after a long trip.  What a great choice.  Easy and full of flavor.  My husband, a big wings fan, said it was better than wings.  I made a change as I did not have a pizza dough, I used crescent rolls and made a sandwich ring.  This is a definite keeper in my book.  I will serve this over and over.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was very tasty.  I did not put the whole bottle of dressing on and it still was kind of a lot, so I would suggest only putting half the bottle on.  Besides that it was great!

I tried this recipe last night, but used raw pizza dough instead of a pre-baked one.  we just cooked it on 450 for 15 minutes and it came out great.  I also added fresh diced tomato and gorgonzola cheese (adding the tomato before the chicken and the gorgonzola after the mozzarella).  it was delicious! i will definitely make it again.  It probably didn't need that much of the salad dressing though.

My family loves this pizza.  The only change I make to the recipe is using less bleu cheese dressing, which seems to be a common theme among reviewers.  This is great for a quick meal, especially if you use 
pre-prepared crust and chicken.  I think the hot sauce you use is your personal preference.  I like Texas Pete's Wing Sauce for this particular recipe, but it is quite spicy.  Add a salad, and dinner is served.

I just fixed this for dinner and it was a big hit!  I used 2, 12oz pizza crusts and the 1 bottle of Bleu Cheese dressing was enough for both. I did use more chicken and more hot sauce then the recipe called for since I knew I was using 2 crusts and my family loves spicy.  This is definitely a keeper.

If you love hot wings with blue cheese dressing (which I do) you will LOVE this recipe, especially if you want to avoid messy fingers and a greasy stove to clean up.  This was SUPER easy and tasted just like wings.  I also thought there was a little too much blue cheese dressing.  I always try to make these allrecipes just as written without modifications the first time.  However, I had almost put on the entire bottle of dressing - about 14 ounces - when I decided to stop, and I am glad I did.  I may go down to 12 oz. next time.  I will make again.

This was THE BEST pizza i have ever had.  I trust the reviews from this web site so I knew it was going to be good (good is an understatement).  My boyfriend had serious doubts, so I made a traditional pizza for him.  He ended up eating ALL of this one.  It was awesome...spicy...creamy...mmmm...DEFINITE KEEPER!!!Thank you Brown!!

I used a pre-made crust (Generic Boboli), Perdue Shortcuts chicken and only 8 oz. of dressing. I used Ken's Buffalo Wing Marinade b/c I wasn't sure what "hot sauce" to use.  When I was putting the dressing on I couldn't imagine putting on the whole 16oz.   I substituted ranch for bleu cheese b/c I had some children eating it that i wasn't sure if they liked bleu cheese, so bleu cheese is thicker - maybe that would make a difference.  Anyway, we loved it.  Will definitely make it again.

I realize that the dressing makes the pizza but I substituted Feta for blue cheese in Bill's Blue Cheese Dressing recipe from this site and the pizza was tremendous!  Both the hubby and kids loved it despite their dislike for Feta!  I also used homemade pizza dough which requires 20/25 mins at 25 degrees.  I'll make again without a doubt!  Thanx so much!

This recipe is excellent.  Instead of using a chicken breast, try baking or frying up a small batch of chicken fingers.  Once cooked through, cut them up and put them on the pizza, with all other ingredients and bake.

I followed the reipe to the T, and was left with a gooey glob of wing sauce, chicken and dressing in the middle. Follow others suggestions and use much less dressing, and even hot sauce then the recipe calls for. Needless to say, this isn't one I would try again.

I have never rated any of the recipes I have made here, and I have made many, but this one deserves my review-with alterations.  I read every single review, as my husband and I are both big buffalo wing chicken pizza fans.  Here are my changes in a nutshell:  I bought a gourmet pizza crust (but any would do as well),  layered the pizza with a very thin layer of ranch dressing first-i guesstimate about 3 oz., then, I shredded two Tyson cooked breasts off the bone and, soaked in hot sauce for several hours, Then simply assembled the ranch - I used lowfat, shredded drenched chicken and topped with 8 oz of Mozzarella then for presentation about an ounce of cheddar- I was trying to disguise the ranch dressing as my husband hates it.  He loved and and so did I!  I have to say again that no one in my picky family has ever loved anything on this site enough to review it, but it was a HUGE hit!  I am very picky, I have to agree with other reviewers, don't rate it if you aren't specific in the way you alter it.
Thanks Brown :)

I boiled chicken breast tenders, then shredded and marinated in Hooter's wing sauce. I did not use the butter.  I used Ranch dressing, instead of Bleu Cheese, for personal preference - and I didn't use the whole bottle, just a thin coat on the crust.  I used Whole Wheat and Honey Pizza Crust (recipe on this site).  And finally, I used Kraft Pizza Blend Cheese on top.  I liked it, and so did my husband.  It was a bit spicy for my kids, but a nice change from the same-old, same-old pizza.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was pretty good although I have some suggestions if you are going to make this:
-Dont use as much chicken: Use 2 to 2 1/2 breast halves.
-Dice up the chicken pretty small remember, you want the cheese to go over the chicken.
-Do NOT use as much blue cheese; it will overpower the rest of the pizza, and it will be way to sloppy: instead, use 12 to 14 ounces.

All-in-all, this recipe was enjoyable and not very strenuous, and hopefully my suggestions are helpful to making this a better pizza.

YUM!  I made this pizza using Jay's Pizza Crust also found here and we loved it!  I didn't use as much dressing as the recipe called for, and I used Frank's Red Hot Buffalo Wings sauce instead of the tobasco mixture.  My husband really loved it---two of his favorite things (wings and pizza) in one!  I'll definitely make this again.

I am not quite sure I should rate this...being that...the only thing I really kept the same is the pizza crust and the cheese but....I cooked the chicken in chicken broth and then shredded it and added a bottle of emeril's kicked up barbecue sauce. I put about a half cup of the sauce first on the crust and then the chicken with the remainer of the sauce over that and then the mozarrella over that...cooked it at 400 degrees for about 10 minutes and it was so, so good! Will be making my version...again and again.

Awesome!!  Like other reviwers suggested, I did not use a whole bottle of dressing.  Also, I would not use the butter when I make this again.  There really is no need and it made the pizza greasy and my oven smoky.  Despite those two changes this is an incredible recipe that I highly recommend.

This was a nice change from your usual pizza.  I also only added enough blue cheese dressing to cover the crust, and I held back a bit when adding the hot sauce to the cooked chicken ( I was nervous it would be too spicy).....next time I will be more generous with the hot sauce because I felt it needed more of a kick than it had with the amount I used.  It did turn out a little greasy, but still very good.  I won't use this as my "everyday" pizza recipie since it's so high in fat and sodium, but it's a nice treat and very easy to make.  I'll probably substitute low fat dressing next time, since there are so many flavors and textures going on that you probably wouldn't notice it.  Thanks for the recipie!

This is great! Definately cut back on the blue cheese though, just enough to cover the crust. I love spicy foods, so I used extra hot sauce and then drizzled some over top. This is the only pizza for me from now on. Thank you.

Great recipe that's very tasty, looks great and is fun to eat. Definitely use less blue cheese... and it works out just fine using less chicken too. For looks, you can sprinkle a little bit of dried rosemary on the top before serving. I definitely plan on keeping this recipe.

I am sure this is great just the way it is, BUT...I had to have the real thing! I never measured a thing, used a pre shredded blend of mozzarella, provalone and cheddar, half the bleu cheese dressing, and crumbled real bleu cheese on top. I have a 16 year old who loves spicey foods, but hates bleu cheese....(he can never say that again)! Nick says it's a keeper for the recipe box!

I think the amount of chicken called for here would be a lot.  I used one left over chicken breast.  

I also wasn't sure how much we would like the blue cheese, especially my picky family, so I used half blue cheese and sauce on the other half of the pizza.  My husband actually preferred the blue cheese side

Good change from pizza.  The times aren't right on the recipe.  It takes about 10 min to prepare and 10 minutes to cook.  Very quick dinner with little effort.  Also, I substituted Ranch for Bleu Cheese (only used a few tablespoons as opposed to the whole bottle it called for).

Great recipe, but I'm new to this site & should have read the reviews 1st...I agree, way too much bleu cheese dressing & I only used 1/2! 

Also, I cooked my chicken by steaming it that way the chicken did not dry out. I then shredded the chicken which, I think, made this pizza more California style.

But I'm not complaining Brown, I wouldn't have thought of it - great suggestion, and I will make it again only W/a lot less dressing next time!

P.S. I also used the low fat variety of dressing/cheese.

Great recipe! However, since real buffalo wings are dark meat, I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs rather than the breast meat for a more authentic "wing" taste. My husband loved it since he's not fond of breast meat. Followed many of the suggestions concerning amounts of dressing etc. Thanks!

Yummy!  I love buffalo chicken fingers and this was a great idea!  I used light ranch dressing, not blue cheese and used Louisiana hot sauce. I also used a prepared pizza crust. I got a little excited at the prospect of this pizza and put a bit too much of the hot sauce on the pizza and found that the sauce became quite runny.  I'll hold back next time and it should be a less messy pizza.  It was delicious despite the mess.  I'll make again, thanks!

This was great! Like others, I cut the dressing in half. But, had extra on hand for dipping the crusts while eating. My husband and I are huge pizza fans when it comes to making them at home. We will definitely make this again.

This pizza was great.  My husband is very picky and he loved this pizza.  He is very fond of anything hot and spicey so this was perfect.  I shredded the chicken instead and only used enough Bleu cheese dressing to thickly coat the crust.  Great recipe.

This was so good!  I've made it twice and through trial and error found that it is better to precook the crust for about 7 minutes so the bottom gets done enough.  My 4 year old liked it, even with the hot "kick".

This was a wonderful change from regular pizza.  I prebaked a refrigerated Pillsbury crust for 10 minutes and used peppercorn ranch dressing.  It only needed another 8 minutes after that.  Next time I am going to use less butter.  I didn't think it added much to the flavor of the pizza.  Can't wait to make it again!

This was a very tasty twist on the usual homemade pizza I make.  I substituted whole wheat pitas for the crust, reduced-fat monterey jack cheese and a drizzle of peppercorn ranch salad dressing for the blue cheese, and added a bit our sour cream and crushed red peppers to the top of it.  Filling, tasty, and fairly healthy.  This is definitely going to become part of my meal repertoire!

This was good, but I would not make again as a dinner.  Will make and cut into squares as an appetizer, or it would be great for a football party. Recipe called for a little to much dressing, would use less next time.

This is a wonderful change to plain pizza!  I did not use an entire bottle of dressing but just enough to cover the dough.  I also added some crumbled bleu cheese to the top.  Instead of hot sauce I used texas pete wing sauce.  It was great!

This is a great alternative to traditional pizza.  I added celery and onions and made half with ranch dressing - since I'm not a big fan of bleu cheese.  My husband had it with the bleu cheese and loved it.

This was very quick and easy.  We really enjoyed it.  We just used enough dressing to cover the crust and it was just fine that way.  This is one we will make again!

Great combo!  I was happy using only 1/4 the amount of dressing suggested, but I'm not a huge bleu cheese fan either.  I thought it was even better as leftovers.

I LOVED this recipe, however my husband didn't.  He thinks chicken has no business being on a pizza.  I guess I'll make this again when he's away.  Thanks for the recipe.

I really made points with my husband and son when I made this last night.  It was really good and very easy to make. I used less dressing than called for in the recipe and more cheese.  I used mozzarella and four cheese Italian blend. Thank you for the great recipe.

one word  "YUM!"
what a different idea for a pizza, however i thought the whole jar of dressing was a little too much but still was an awesome, quick recipe.  i made mine using a "Boboli" pizza shell.

Pizza dough took the longest. We used the one from this sight and took the water pan out after 10 min. My husband & I loved this recipe. 2 of our 4 kids(under 12) tried it but still prefer cheese ONLY. Don't tell them what's in it! I added mushrooms, green onions, tomatoes and bacon bits to half. It tastes fantastic with anything. Used only 1/2 the dressing and added extra cheese. Great leftover too!

This is a EXCELLENT recipe!!!  Who knew something so easy could taste SOOO  good!!  The only change I made was that I used thighs instead of breast.  To me, the thighs have ALOT  more flavor and juiciness and this was no exception. Again, this was OUTSTANDING!!

Very good. I used 1/4 c. of Ranch dressing and 1/4 c. of Sweet Baby Ray’s buffalo wing sauce instead of the blue cheese dressing. Also put a ton more cheese on it, with a small amount of mozz mixed with cheddar.

This is so good! I added jalapeño peppers and green onions. I used lower fat blue cheese salad dressing and for a lighter version I just covered the pizza crust in a thin layer and it was still amazing. I’ve been trying to eat better but I cannot give up pizza so I will look forward to making this on my cheat days!

Made this and loved it. I used two large chicken breasts, baked them then shredded/chopped. I only used about 2 to 3 oz. of the Bleu cheese dressing, just enough to cover the pizza crust . but not 8 oz, which seemed like a lot. You can use the stated amount to your liking., same with the hot sauce. I also used small mozzarella balls cut in half, as that is what I had on hand, added some fresh basil from my herb garden, and sprinkled with Parmesan. It was delicious. Definately will make this again.

This was a hit! My husband loves buffalo wings and he loved the pizza. I only made a small addition of green onions/chives to the pizza. It was very tasty and filling. A must make again recipe! Thank you!

I made this recipe with several changes (I'd give mine 5 stars - but I like the concept of this recipe). I pre-baked the crust while I was finishing up the chicken. I also went ahead and mixed everything in the skillet (yay, less dishes!) I used mild wing sauce instead of hot sauce, ranch instead of blue cheese dressing (and no where near 8 oz - that seems excessive), and cheddar cheese on top. It is delicious! It's definitely something I'll be making again. The only thing that I'll change is not baking the crust for as long before I add the toppings. I followed the instructions on the crust can and by the time I pre-baked it, added toppings, and baked it again, the crust was over-done.

I made this with Pillsbury pizza crust - pre-baked - then put ranch dressing on  (just enough to cover crust), Used some leftover grilled chicken with the hot sauce and butter and lots of mozzarella cheese on top then baked for about 7 minutes. It tasted awesome!

Delicious! I tookThe advice of the other reviewer's and pre-bake the pizza crust for a few minutes. 
I also added spinach, thinly  sliced tomato, and red onion. 
I added the buffalo sauce to skillet while cooking my chicken in the final  minute.
 Unbelievable ...The best buffalo chicken pizza I've ever tasted was made right in my own kitchen!

Made it for dinner tonight.  WOW!  It was SO GOOD!  I took others advice and only spread a thin layer of dressing on the crust.  I made home made pizza dough, used Frank's wing sauce, 3 shredded medium sized chicken thighs because we like dark meat and store bought chunky blue cheese dressing.  The blue cheese chunks were warm and melted underneath the chicken and shredded cheese.  We LOVED it!  Will definitely make this again!  Thanks for the recipe!

Tasty and easy recipe.  I would make one side with ranch and the other with blue cheese next time.

A good foundation. I had to modify it some (for instance I used a 12-inch crust instead of 16-inch, and one chicken breast was more than enough chicken.)

We bought a pre-made pizza crust to me it easy. Brushed a little olive oil on crust including edges. Put buffalo sauce as the base then  light layer of finely shredded mozzarella. I bought package fajita chicken me cooked it and tossed it in the buffalo sauce , chopped yellow onion. Layered all that and tipped with more mozzarella. we used almost the whole 8 of bag of cheese. Also sprinkled the crust with Parmesan and garlic powder, then baked it for 8 minutes. It was delicious.

We make homemade pizza at least one night a week and are always looking for innovative ways to make it special. This is what we were looking for! We like the dressing on the side for a dip and find that the wing sauce is a great sub for marinara. Sometimes we'll add sliced fresh jalapeños and/or cilantro.  It's been in our regular rotation for a few weeks now.  Thanks for the inspiration.

Made this for the Supper Bowl party last night and everyone loved it.   I used Ranch dressing, spread generously  over a prepared pizza shell.   Using a prepared shell as directed instead of fresh dough prevents the soggy crust.  I used approx 14 ounces of cooked chicken breast, chopped small with 3 tablespoons of Hot Wing sauce (no butter).   Lastly I used a cheddar and mozzarella blend purchased at the local grocery store.   I am sure this will be a family favorite.

Made my own pizza crust and added a few onions, otherwise I followed the recipe. I don't care for spicy/hot foods and was skeptical that this would be overly hot for me, but it wasn't!  It was very good and I will definitely add it to my rotation of recipes.

We had leftovers from the Slow Cooker Buffalo Chicken Sandwhiches recipie from this site and used it for this pizza and it was a hit! Substituted ranch in place of the blue cheese, and used both mozzarella and cheddar cheeses. Will definitely make again.

Great recipe, but I did make a few changes:
1) I used ranch dressing instead of blue cheese. 
2) Added diced red onion on top, it compliments the buffalo chicken very well.
3) I put a little bit of buffalo sauce on the crust with the dressing.
I'd highly recommend trying this recipe, and make changes to your tastes!

I used the "slow cooker buffalo chicken sandwiches" recipe from this site as leftovers for my chicken.  I baked homemade pizza dough for 6 min first and then added the toppings.

I accidentally mixed the butter, hot sauce, and ranch dressing together first and then used that to spread over the dough and then coated the chicken with it. Was short for time and used microve breaded chicken strips. It was EXCELLENT!!!!

We make and love this! My kids love to use pitas for the crust, ranch dressing for the sauce and blue cheese crumbles mixed in with the mozzarella. We cook them in the toaster oven.  Yummy and fast!

We loved it! Had to use ranch dressing instead because no one cares for blue cheese other than me. Also, used a 12 inch pie crust because no store sold 16 inch. It wasn't a problem. Our grocery store sells a pack of three large chichen breasts so I used only two of them as they weren't halves. Perfect! The pizza was loaded with chicken. Like others I shredded the chicken. I'll definitely make this again!

This is a really good pizza. I did make some of the changes made by others. I thinly sliced 1 stalk of celery and  1/2 c of thinly sliced Red onions. Sautée 2 cloves of garlic, red onions and celery in skillet with olive oil. I prebaked  the crust about 6-8mins.  Spead blue cheese  dressing over crust . Add chicken and Spead olive oil mixture on top of chicken. Add cheese. I used cheddar, mozzarella, provolone. Hubby and I loved it. It's a keeper.

I've been making this recipe for many years and have had tons of complements on it, but with a few modifications:
I shred my chicken and only mix it in Frank's hot cause and skip the butter. I just use regular pizza sauce and mix in a couple Tbsps of Franks(to taste, obviously use more if you like it hot). Then spread that on the crust, add the chicken and cheese, then I add some chopped green onion or sauteed onion if I don't have any green onion. Then I cook it for 10 minutes and serve it with blue cheese or ranch dressing.

Made mine a little on the lighter side. Put buffalo sauce on top of wheat pita bread and then grilled chicken chunks and blue cheese crumbles.  Topped with some green onions. When making my buffalo sauce i also add 1/2 tsp of vinegar, 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper and 1/8 tsp of garlic powder.

I made this to serve as an appetizer on a cocktail cruise with friends.  I took the advice of another poster and also made Bill's Blue Cheese Dressing, which I thought was excellent. The pizza needed something else for more smoky flavor - next time, I may try to add a bit of liquid smoke seasoning to the chicken and sauce.

I made this for a Super Bowl get together and it was a huge hit! I made a few changes as suggested by other reviews. I bought refrigerated pizza dough and rolled it out on a 12 inch pan. I then baked it in the oven for ten minutes before adding the toppings. Because I am not a big fan of bleu cheese, I substituted fat-free ranch. I also used part-skim mozzarella. Even with the substitutions, this was excellent (very filling as well) and I will be making it again for sure!

Hand stretch the dough;do not roll dough it makes it tough. Pre-cook the pizza crust 5-10 min until lightly cooked (Bought herbed pizza dough from market basket. Only $1.29 for the dough) . spread blue cheese w/spoon just to cover (Don't saturate).Add cooked chicken. (I used skinless/boneless thighs cooked in a pan. light breadcrumbs/flour/adobo) add just enough oil to cook , add Shredded cheese to taste. Once cooked, drizzle blue cheese over pizza. Excellent!... The crust prep works great with any combination of ingredients

This was GREAT!! I threw the chicken in the crock pot for a few hours and shredded it because it's so easy and comes out perfect, plus the shredded chicken really hangs onto the hot sauce. I used Louisiana hot sauce because that's what we had, but i didn't measure it, I just added as much as I thought the kids could handle and then more for my husband's side of the pizza. I used Marie's blue cheese because it's awesome, and I used a whole 16oz brick of mozzarella cheese and grated it. This was just as good as any restaurant's buffalo chicken wing pizza!

Delicious! Used ranch instead of blue cheese dressing. Added 1/2 cup of green onions. Mixed it with half mozzarella cheese and cheddar cheese. Cooked my chicken with 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, and 2 tsp of Montreal chicken seasoning (really made a difference!) Enjoy!

I added some extra hot sauce on top of the pizza and used ranch instead of blue cheese dressing. I would also recommend pre cooking the pizza dough for 5 minutes before adding the toppings.

Excellent!  Read the reviews and reduced the blue cheese dressing to just cover the pizza, also used a hot sauce we love and suggest you try if you love "Buffalo" flavor it is called Defcon 2 from Defcon Sauces - order it on the internet, Terrific flavor!  This Pizza was great and we'll be making it often! Thank you!

I really like everything about this recipe except one thing. I would have substituted blue cheese dressing for ranch. I really want to like blue cheese so I figured I would give it a shot. Sadly, Im still not the biggest fan. Next time I will use ranch and it will be even better. Thanks!

I used ranch dressing instead and only about 3 or 4 tablespoons. Just enough to coat the crust. And drizzled a little of the extra sauce on there too. We always make sausage and pepperoni pizzas, so this was a nice change and easy to make. It was delicious, I will make it again.

This was really good. Used Ranch instead and only used enough to coat the crust. We usually order buffalo chicken pizza from our fav. pizza places (Jets, Pizza Hut, etc.) and this was much better. Just as much flavor and WAY more chicken.

I used about 1/3-1/2 cup of blue cheese dressing and a homemade, pre-baked crust, and skipped the butter. It was THE BEST Buffalo chicken pizza I ever had.

Great recipe! Proportions were perfect and it didn't turn out too spicy--I worried it would. Added bacon, peppers and onions to make it my own!

Nice flavors! I made a few changes to fit my tastes: I used a Naan bread recipe for my crust. The yogurt in the bread makes it very light inside and crisp on the outside. I par-bake these in batches and freeze them for quick/easy pizza crusts. I cranked the oven to 550 and put in a pizza stone (takes about an hour to preheat and heat the stone up.)

For toppings I chopped 1 chicken breast and sauteed in 1 TB EVOO and 1TB margarine. I then added 2 TB Franks Hot sauce to the saute and cooked it until the chicken was done, setting the meat aside to cool. In another pan I sauteed a stalk of celery finely diced and a half an onion, also in a 1:1 TB of EVOO and margarine. Once the veggies were soft I set this aside to cool. In a small bowl I combined 1/4 blue cheese dressing (Rooties) and 1/4 cup plain nonfat yogurt. Lastly I chopped the cooled chicken up in to a finer mince and added more hot sauce to it.

When it came time to assemble the pie, I started with a layer of tomato sauce with a dash or 2 of Franks Hot Sauce, red chili flake and garlic powder, a thin layer of mozzarella cheese, then the chicken and veggies. Lastly I crumbled a little feta over top and drizzled some of the blue cheese mixture. The pie baked on the stone in about 6 minutes and came out crispy and gooey good on top. Next time I may skip the sauce and use the blue cheese mix as the base with extra Franks.

Both Franks Hot Sauce and Rooties Blue Cheese Dressing are authentic Buffalo favorites. :)

I would say definitely do not use an entire bottle of blue cheese dressing.... just use enough to coat the crust, which is likely about 1/4 of the bottle. I then top it with the chicken mixture coated in hot sauce and butter, and some sliced onions and garlic powder. The result is great with those few tweaks... but, to each their own, right?

This was pretty good but I made it my own. I used a homemade crust (I always use this member's recipe http://allrecipes.com/recipe/pizza-dough-i/detail.aspx) I used ranch since we don't care for bleu cheese and limited the amount to 3/4 cup (just enough to cover the crust and trust me that's all you need) I also only used 3/4 cup Franks Hot Buffalo sauce. I topped it with sliced red onion and black olives and brushed the crust with olive oil a few minutes before I took it out of the oven. Something about this pizza was just lacking - maybe it needed more toppings or some cheddar The crust was awesome though! I totally recommend that Pizza Dough I recipe.

This is a great recipe! I changed 2 things, I grilled the pizza instead of baking (brush pizza crust w/ a little olive oil 1st) and used ranch instead of blue cheese. Very yummy!

This would be good to serve at a basement bar get together.  I think that 8oz of hot sauce is too much and I really like the hot sauce I use.  I think 4oz would be enough.

Can't go wrong with this combination of toppings.  I was light on chicken so I sauteed some diced celery and added that.  Made Jay's Signature Pizza Dough from this site, and we were very happy with this pizza.  Great as leftovers too.  Will definitely make again.

Dont use a whole bottle of dressing, just enough to cover top of crust.  Cook 2 chicken breasts in croc pot for about 4 hours and shred before adding butter and buffalo sauce.  This is so good and easy. I have made it several times.

Very simple and easy. I like pounding the breasts and marinating with a 30 min marinade (tomato & garlic). Grilled chicken is the way to go on this pizza! It is a little hot with the full shot of hot sauce... if you're not up for something VERY hot -- try something a little sweeter than Tabasco, or simply put less hot sauce than required. I also added some Parmesan cheese in addition to the mozzarella and it worked out well. Very delicious and very easy! GRILLED chicken is best!

I first tried a buffalo chicken pizza at a place in Outerbanks, NC and fell in love. I tried many other places but never got one as good. This recipe is almost as good. I gave it 5 stars becuase it is better than i expected and my husband loves it and its the only thing he asks for seconds. 1 thing i do differently is i add half the bottle of dressing it calls for. Other than that is pretty good

Found the hole bottle of hot sauce a little to much to eat the pizza as a meal; unfortunately my husband and I ate too much and the heartburn is killing us. But as an appetizer it was delicious. Definitely a must try! Great recipe!

Delicious.  We used ranch dressing instead of blue cheese, like other reviews suggested.  Would rate it a five only by adding some additional toppings, like red onion and green pepper.

I am not really a fan of blue cheese, so to me the dressing was kind of overwhelming. I think I may try ranch dressing next time and just enough to coat the crust. Otherwise it is a great recipe!

Very good. A little too much sauce but otherwise easy and tasty. I used TJs pizza dough, ranch dressing and Frank's regular hot sauce.

This was really good!  I adjusted the ingredients to make one small pizza (8" Boboli whole wheat crust), and made my own version of bleu cheese dressing using light ranch and bleu cheese crumbles, and I went a little light on the mozzarella.  This was so easy and delicious, and a great change from the norm. Will definitely make this one again!

I thought this was really good and also very easy.  I did take the advice of others and added some chopped celery, red onion and crumbled blue cheese.  I liked the crunch of the celery and we think everything is better with onions.  I used less salad dressing than called for but next time I will use even less.  We thought it was a little too much.  I also used less chicken and it still had chicken in every bite.  I also used garlic wing sauce which is extra hot and this pizza definitely had some kick to it which is just how we like it.  I know I'll make this again.

Use the Slow Cooker Buffalo Chicken from this website, and I also did what others said such as: putting some olive oil and garlic powder on top, then putting the crust in the oven to get it crisp before adding the chicken

Great pizza! My husband ordinarily hates chicken on pizza, but he loves spicy buffalo chicken, so he gave me the okay to try this. I actually used frozen Tyson buffalo chicken strips instead of making my own buffalo chicken for this. I put half a bag of them in the oven to cook up a little bit then shredded them up onto the pizza. I love this recipe

This was just okay for me.  I don't really like Blue Cheese and my husband really doesn't like ranch so we split that right down the middle.  I definitely did not use as much dressing as recipe calls for.  Just put a thin layer on.  We added some grilled onions and some left over black olives we had on hand.  Also, did not use the butter - just wing sauce to keep out some of the fat that I really don't think would have added any value.  My husband really liked it but I really just thought it was okay.  It was almost like a piece or two was enough.

This was a crowd pleaser.  I made my pizza crust from scratch and prebaked it according to other suggestions.  I used Blue Cheese dressing but also made the buttermilk hidden valley out of the packet for dipping.  I cut into squares and served as an appetizer.  Next time I will ad onion and jalapenos

If you love buffalo chicken, you will love this pizza. It's easy to make, and you can make it even faster by using precooked chicken strips (I use Tyson southwestern seaseoned grilled chicken strips), Frank's buffalo wing sauce (cuts out the need for butter and cuts some calories), and Boboli pizza crust. I also do half mozzarella, half sharp cheddar, and add some red onions. If you want to cut the calories, you can easily do so by using light dressing and light cheese, and the buffalo wing sauce rather than mixing hot sauce and butter. You can also reduce the amount of cheese and salad dressing to cut it even further - this recipe turns out VERY cheesy and saucy. Tasty, but fattening for sure.

Even better than expected!  We used a little less hot sauce and added a little "Sweet Baby Ray's" BBQ sauce.  Used Ranch dressing versus bleu cheese because it's what we had.  No leftovers!!!

Made a 16" pizza.  1 1/2 lbs of chicken was too much.  Used a pound.  Grilled it.  8oz of blue cheese dressing was way overboard.  Next time I would try 5 oz.  Flavor was decent but not a knock out.  Was a good change from a tradtional pizza.

Overall, great taste and was even better as leftovers the next day for lunch. I used ranch instead of blue cheese (b/c it was what I had already) and 8 ounces was waayyy too much for my taste, so next time I will reduce it a good bit.

This was delicious!  Even my husband (who is kind of picky) loved it!  Based on the reviews, I made it with a fresh crust, Bill's Blue Cheese dressing from this site (modified to use low-fat ingredients and less mayo), shredded chicken tossed in butter and hot sauce, and mozzarella and cheddar.  It was delicious - I'll make this again.  Thanks for the idea for a great and easy supper!

Yummy! I made my own pizza crust and also used the slow cooker buffalo chicken recipe from here for this pizza. I also subbed fresh ranch for the blue cheese dressing because I prefer ranch. Used about 2/3-3/4 cup ranch (the kind prepped from the seasoning packet). I also drizzled extra buffalo sauce on top after I put the cheese and chicken on. YUMMY!

Very good recipe. Like most people, I use about 3/4 cup of ranch and sometimes I use Monterey Jack cheese instead of mozzarella. I also make my crust from scratch. It's always a big hit!

Pizza was delicious, instead of using fresh chicken cooked and cubed I used Perdue chicken tenders cooked and cut into pieces. I then followed the recipe and it was delicious. It was a big hit with my family and friends.

Cant eat blue cheese so substituted for Ranch and added fresh sliced tomatoes and grilled onions. And of course... made pizza on gas grill! So Yummy!

Note to self....1 bottle of hot sauce does not mean 1 bottle of Tabasco!  LOL  I don't really care for spicy food but I made this for my daughter and husband.  Their eyes almost fell out of their heads when I told them I used the full bottle of tabasco, but since they both REALLY like hot food, the whole pizza went in the course of 2 days.    They said it tasted good, although really hot!  Next time I guess I will use Wing sauce!

I substituted ranch dressing for the blue cheese to use what I had on hand and it was great. Even the very particular eaters in my house loved this!

Our new favorite pizza recipe.  Change it up a bit to suit our tastes:  used Ranch dressing instead of blue cheese and made a homemade crust.  Also shredded the chicken instead of cubing it, but would be great either way.  Used some Sybergs wing sauce mixed in with some hot sauce and cooked the whole thing on our Big Green Egg!  Awesome!

Simple but pleasing to the husband and teens.  I did use a vinegar based blue cheese, next time I'll do it with a creamy one.  Instead of butter and hot sauce, I poached the chicken and then tossed it in Texas Pete Buffalo Wing Sauce.

I gave this 4 stars because I don't care for blue cheese! :)  I used just enough ranch dressing to cover the crust and made the buffalo sauce from butter and frank's red hot.  My husband and son loved this pizza, will make again and again!

this is my first review on a recipe I had to make sure everyone knew how incredible this pizza was...my husband looked at me like i was nuts when i told him what i was making, but he practically ate a whole pizza, and me and the kids just kept eating it throught out the evening until it was gone--couldnt get enough!!!  i used the pillsbury dough and topped it with cheddar and mozzarella cheese!

I used the leftovers from my Slow Cooker Buffalo Chicken and ranch dressing (as I don't like blue cheese).  I also added red onions.  Delicious!

I loved this pizza.  Made it just by the recipe and it was great.  I liked it with the blue cheese but think I will try ranch next time to see how that is.

not so good for us. I have never tried buffalo chicken pizza and hubby wanted to try it but I feel it is too much like drinking hot sauce. Sorry but just not to our liking.

Delicious ! I made quite a few changes though. I use my own hot sauce recipe and made two pizzas, one with ranch as a sauce instead of blue cheese and one with the blue cheese. I have made this recipe thousands of times and it's amazing every time.

This recipe was easy and delicious. I've been wanting to try making a buffalo chicken pizza at home for quite some time but never really knew how to go about it. If I had known it was this easy i would have done it a long time ago.

I love making Buffalo Chicken Pizza, but I go to a local pizza parlor & get a pre-made dough, a little more expensive, but "OH SO WORTH IT". Also, I cook chicken, buffalo sauce, butter & mushrooms in a pan before adding it to the crust. I don't add the dressing until I'm ready to eat it, then I drizzle it on. I think it gives a greatly enhanced flavor, and you can alternate between straight buffalo, and cooled down flavors.  PS - for a bit of a change up, I sometimes add bacon and pepperoni, WOO-HOO, what a flavor, but let me tell you, heartburn city, keep the "Tums or Rolaids" handy. Also, if you want to try a little variety, use a six-cheese italian topping. Enjoy everybody. PPS - if you really want to get creative, try making Buffalo Chicken Stromboli, WOWZERS,  MMM, MMM, MMM, need I say more.

Great change up from the italian version of pizza...made the recipe as is with the possible exception of using a bit less of the blue cheese dressing......my neighbor thought it was the best she ever had.......and she uses my Kitchen aid to make the dough.......and oh ya....used my favorite dough recipe to make this..wasn't soggy at all.   Anyway, I digress, she made it and said it was terrible....she used a low quality blue cheese dressing.....i used marzetti...it makes a huge difference!!!

OMGosh this is the best pizza! I loved it! We make pizza about once a week at my house and this will be the one I make from now on. I used Louisianna hot sauce on the chicken and just used the store brand extra chunky blue cheese dressing. Awesome pizza!

Made this with crock pot buffalo chicken from this site. Oh so good! Used ranch instead of blue cheese and a simple Pillsbury crust.  Took 5 minutes to make yet one of the most satisfying!

Loved it!   This is perfect for something different.   It tastes just like Buffalo Style Chicken wings. Go figure.  I used Frank's Red Hot Wings Sauce (Buffalo Heat) and Ranch dressing but I only used enough to lightly cover crust verses a whole bottle.  Will make again!   Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this with my sister and friend for lunch one lazy saturday for lunch. It was SO easy, and all of the ingredients were found around the house. It took hardly any time, and it was unbelievably good. I now prefer this pizza to ordering out, hands down. I crave it! One thing we did was add a little more hot sauce because we liked the kick. FABULOUS pizza! bravo!

This is delicious! I've made this several times now, regular recipe and low fat.  For low fat, stick with regular mozzarela and just do a thinner pizza crust and light blue cheese.  I use litehouse blue cheese and its awesome.  Always a big hit!

I made this pizza one night and did not care for it. The combination of blue cheese dressing with cheese and buffalo styled chicken pieces did not go well together. I won't be trying this again.

Yummy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! For less then  it costs for 2  slices of this at my local pizzeria I made a whole pie.   I used ranch (personal preference) and  fresh pizza dough from the grocery stores deli section.I rolled it out and baked it for about 7 minutes( I do this when I make  traditional pizza too)then followed as written...to my surprise my family had eaten the mozzarella cheese. that i bought for this recipe..so I used a combination of shredded cheddar,Monterrey jack and provolone.definitely will make again!

This is fabulous!!  I used homemade pizza crust, Ken's Marinade Buffalo Wing Sauce, ranch dressing (we don't like bleu cheese) and added cheddar cheese, too.  Will make again and again and again . . .

Very good, especially for football games. I think that using at least half cheddar cheese it a must though. Yum!

Great pizza.  I love wings, so this was tasty.  I used left over shredded chicken breast and used "Frank's Buffalo Wing Sauce" with extra "Frank's Red Hot" to season the chicken.  If you use the buffalo wing sauce, then you don't need the butter.  I pre-baked the raw dough crust for 5 min. before adding toppings.  I used homemade blue cheese dressing, which resembles "Bill's" from this site, except mine has 3 T fresh parsley, 1 t. fresh garlic in lieu of powder, and 2 T. red wine vinegar.  The chicken, buffalo sauce and cheese tend to overpower the taste of the bc dressing, so after I lay the dressing on top, I sprinkle crumbles of bleu cheese over the pizza, too intensify the dressing's taste.  I then layer on the chicken, and a half/half ratio of mozzerella and cheddar cheese.  GREAT PIZZA

Excellent! My family and one friend loved this pizza. We did a pizza night and made this and also White Pizza from AR. I used leftover alfredo sauce from the white pizza and mixed it with fresh chunks of blue cheese as the sauce. I love anything with hot sauce.

Love it. We keep coming back to this recipe, so I guess that means 5 stars! I agree you should use less bleu cheese dressing, initially. But, we dip the pizza in the reserved dressing while eating it!

Two thumbs way up!  My husband doesn't care for much of anything that has blue cheese related products in it, and he asks for this again and again.  Can be made into a calorie friendly version which is always nice to see and very quick and easy.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious!  Great use for leftover "Slow Cooker Buffalo Chicken Sandwiches" meat.  We also didn't use a full bottle of dressing, and I did half with bleu cheese and half with ranch (family taste preferences).  So good!

Really really good--a few tips--do not use a whole bottle of dressing! I used Light Ranch and just spread it thinly over a Boboli crust. Also, use mozzarella and cheddar cheese. I did not use as much butter (probably one tablespoon as opposed to two and probably added a bit more than 2 oz of Franks Red Hot since my boyfriend loves it).Put it in the oven for 10 minutes at 450 and when it came out sprinkled green onions on top. A keeper!

AMAZING!!!! I wasn't sure how good this would turn out...I love season's buffalo pizza so I figured I would try this.  It turned out perfect.  The only thing I wanna work on is the crust.  I got prepared crust from mars and it just has no flavor.  I'm thinking maybe next time I'll brush it with a butter/garlic/basil mixture around the edge.  Thanks for this terrific recipe!!

Very good as is but we liked it even better when I changed the dressing from Blue Cheese to Ranch and instead of putting the Ranch directly on the pizza to cook, we use it as a dip. I'm not a fan of hot ranch and this way we also use less. (Healthier....slightly)

Didn't OD on dressing when assembling, but this still turned out runny.  The flavor wasn't bad, but I wouldn't make this for anyone other than myself.

I didn't care for this too much.  I only used half of the dressing, and thought it was too soupy.  I also added cheddar cheese as suggested by another reviewer.  I wouldn't do this if i made it again.  It made the cheese portion of the pizza too heavy.  This only gets 4 stars because those I served it to loved it.  I would have given it 2 or 3 at best.

I used Franks red hot for wings on this and OMG was it good.  I served it with ranch on the side. My family does not like blue cheese. My oven recently died, but my kids love pizza so I used my Rival Roaster Oven @ 425 for 20-25 Minutes. I always par bake my dough for about 8-10 Minutes first, then just bake the rest of the time allotted. I also warm some garlic in olive oil and Italian seasoning and brush it around the edge of the pizza.

I've made this twice now and I got rave reviews both times. I used ranch dressing instead of bleu cheese and I just covered the crust instead of using the whole bottle as other people mentioned. I also shredded the chicken instead of using cubes and it spead on the pizza nicely. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

This was wonderful. I didn't use anywhere near a whole bottle of dressing. I probably only used around 1/2 a cup. The pizza was so good but you couldn't tell there was any ranch dressing on it so next time I'll use a little more. mmm mmmm

Hubby and I loved it!  I sprinkled cornmeal on the pan before putting the dough on it.  I also subbed ranch dressing for the blue cheese, and did a mix of cheddar and mozzarella cheeses on top.  Delicious!

This just didn't work for me. The butter separated while cooking and left a horrible greasy layer on top of the pizza. I used ranch instead of blue (as I can't get blue cheese dressing) and it made the base soggy & didn't taste of anything. Sorry :(

I always thought homemade pizza wasn't nearly as good as when you order out for it, however, this recipe has become an almost weekly request because it is so good.  I pre-bake the crust for about 7 minutes and then add just enough dressing to cover rather than the whole bottle as the recipe calls for.  Other than that I follow it exactly and really love it!

This was good.  I used a prepared pizza crust, next time I will make my own. I had to use ranch dressing in place of the blue cheese since family won't eat it.  I will make this again.

I used smaller premade crusts, 8'. I like blue cheese, but my boyfriend does not. So I used ranch. I brushed the bottom on the crust with ranch. I tossed the shredded chicken in Cookie's Buffalo Sauce and spread on top of the ranch. Then I topped with fresh sliced mozzerella and cut up some peppercuinis and put on top with some fresh ground pepper. They were delicious! I 8' pizza per person worked great.

Way too hot for me!  I am not a fan of "too hot".  BF said "tangy" and his forehead didn't even sweat so I guess it was just me.  My only change was using ranch dressing. It was a very nice looking pizza and I enjoyed the piece I had.  It seemed like so few ingredients to have so much flavor!  I'll try a milder hot sauce next time.  I used Tabasco sauce.

This recipe is good. I actually also did a version of it. I used 2 pillsbury pizza dough s and cooked it almost done. Then I took skinless,boneless chicken breasts and cut into small peices. I deep fried them in Frickers batter miz and added the hot sauce. Instead of blue cheese I added rach dressing and only about half a bottle. I put the cooked chicken on added the cheese and finished baking. It takes a little longer to fix but I think it's better with the battered, fried chicken. You be the judge though.

One of the best recipes ever. I use rotisserie chicken from the store and homemade pizza crust. I like ranch dressing better on it than bleu cheese. I also add sliced celery on top of the chicken before cooking. So good!!!

Whoot whoot! A super hit! Listened to other viewers- prebaked the crust. Didn't have blue cheese dressing but used ranch and topped w/ blue cheese crumbles. Also, shredded a rotisserie chicken; held the sauce well. Definitely will make again! Thank u!

I sprinkle blue cheese on this instead of using dressing...The wing sauce & chicken have enough sauce that you don't need a bottle of dressing.  I also add about 3/4 cup of chopped celery in with the chicken & sauce... bake for 3/4 of the time... sprinkle blue cheese on top & return to oven...

Wow this pizza is GOOD! We've made it a few times and it is fantastic.  We use left over chicken strips and Kraft blue cheese dressing.  This pizza was a hit at our 2009 New Years party.  People kept asking for more!  Even those who hate blue cheese loved this pizza. This will be a keeper at our house.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Yum! Sooo good! I made it with Frank's buffalo wing sauce and it was just perfect heat wise. Both of my young boys devoured it. I also made my own pizza dough, used Pizza Dough I from this site, which was very easy to make but just ok texture wise. Plan on making this over and over again.

Made this for my super bowl party...delicious! I used one of the jiffy pizza crust mixes (only about 50 cents), prebaked it, spread with blue cheese and topped with chicken/hot sauce mixture. Very easy and everyone seemed to like it.

This was good, but I think 3 chicken breasts and 1 bottle of dressing is too much.  I only used about 2/3 cup dressing and 1 chicken breast.

Wow, this was an awesome pizza. I made the pizza crust using a recipe on here. I didn't have any ranch, so I took 1/2 cup of mayo and 1/2 cup of sour cream and added about 2/3 of a ranch packet to it. I spread this thinly on the crust with a liquid brush. To make the chicken, I thawed it and put some season all, salt and pepper, and a little bit of garlic on there and pan sauteed it with olive oil. I cut it up into small pieces so it would cook faster. Then, I mixed it with the sauce and put it on top of the ranch sauce. Finally, I placed a mixture of cheddar and mozz cheese on top and baked for about 15 minutes at 350. Delicious!

I'm a gal from Buffalo,(and real chicken wing lovers!) and my whole family enjoyed this easy, yummy recipe. I used less dressing than stated, as I was worried about it making the crust soggy. I cooked it directly on the oven rack which kept the crust crispy like we like it. This was delicious-don't hesitate!

I liked this recipe...but I used 1 cup of Fat Free Ranch dressing mixed with hot sauce.  I also used low fat cheese and a wheat crust.  It's a little bit better for you and taste just as good.

This pizza is amazing.  I did make a few substitutions. 1) I made a Pillsbury pizza crust and put it in the oven for about 5 minutes first. 2) I substituted Light Ranch for the Blue Cheese dressing and only used about 2/3 C and really could have used less.  3) I boiled the chicken and shredded it. 4) Instead of just hot sauce, I added Tabasco and Chili sauce to the Hot Sauce and then also added just a tiny amount of BBQ sauce. 5) Then, I sprinkled it with a Italian pre-shredded cheese mix.  It only needed to be cooked for about 7 minutes after that.  It prepared very quickly... almost too quick.  My goal was to take it out of the oven when my husband walked in the door but it was ready when he was about 5 minutes out, so it had time to sit.

Perfect pizza for our family! We did use Ranch and reduced the amount to just covering the crust.  Shredded the chicken and soaked it in the hot sauce for 30 minutes before baking...YUM!

This was GREAT and I will make again.  Followed advice of others and lightly coated the crust with ranch then added the chicken and topped with about 4 oz of mozzarella.  I used more franks hot sauce than called for probably doubled that but it was GREAT.  I made a very popular crust from this site in the bread machine and it made for an easy meal, THANKS!

Love this recipe. You can't get anything like this in Australia and I very much love buffalo chicken from the states, this combined with the NY pizza base recipe is delicious.

Ok this was out of this world.  Made some changes.  First we used a pillsbury refridgerator roll out crust.  Bake in oven first to get crispy.  Ours was not soggy at all, delish!  Second instead of hot sauce we used Sweet Baby Ray's Buffalo Wing Sauce/Marinade, we just happened to have it and it was very good.  Finally, we like blue cheese but we like ranch too. I think this was the best change, we used ranch dressing and then sprinkled crumbles of blue cheese on top.  I have to say, my boyfriend is the best cook ever, he made this and I love him.

Absolutely delicious! Buffalo chicken and pizza are two of my favorite foods, and ever since my first bite of a buffalo chicken pizza I've been looking for a recipe. Instead of cubing the chicken, however, I usually shred it. I also substitute ranch for the bleu cheese to accommodate my picky-eater roommate.

Very good.  I used frozen pizza dough that I baked for 10 minutes before adding the toppings.  I also used Ranch dressing because I don't like Blue Cheese.  I only used 1 cup and next time I would probably use only half of that, just enough for a thin layer because the dressing made everything really soggy and slippery.  I also thought it needed more of the hot sauce flavor.  I used 2 medium chicken breasts, chopped very small and about 3T. buffalo wing sauce and I felt like we couldn't really taste the sauce as much as we'd like.  Next time I would do more and let the chicken "marinade" in it for  a while before making the pizza.  Great recipe with some changes for personal taste!

Great recipe!  I wasn't sure about the bleu cheese so I used ranch (not the whole bottle...maybe half) and it was wonderful. I made my own crust and that makes it taste even better. I even made breadsticks on the side and dipped them in ranch dressing. I am making this again this week!

Followed your lead... made my own fresh dough, spread olive oil over the pizza crust to start, and added some cayenne pepper for an extra kick. Delish!

Awesome!! I crave this wonderful pizza! I have made it with the Pillsbury dough and have had trouble with it coming out kinda soggy so I would try a homeade crust instead.

This was very yummy.  We switched the blue cheese dressing for ranch because I have a few blue cheese haters in my family.  Next time, I'll cut the dressing by a third or half.  It was a bit too wet.  But, there will definitely be a next time.  Yum! Thanks for the recipe

Outstanding flavor!  One of my family's favorite pizzas,  I too use less blue cheese dressing and another substitution is canned chicken!  Just drain, rinse and flake the chicken.  It's so much easier than traditional chicken breast and I think just at tasty.

Absolutely delicious! Bought a rotisserie chicken, shredded it and that made it a lot easier. Also, doubled the butter/hot sauce mixture since I didn't think it would be enough and only used 3/4 cup of fat free bleu cheese dressing. Everyone loved it so we will definitely make again!

Good, all the tailgaters loved it, but I thought it wasn't hot enough. Did use Ranch instead of Blue Cheese.

OMG was this good! My husband and I ate the whole pizza! Cooked the crust for about 8 minutes by itself. Then added the layer of ranch topped with the chicken mixture. Add a few more oz. of hot sauce.

i used homemade crust and prebaked it 10 mins, decreased the amount of dressing, and i used shredded colby jack cheese to top it off. even though i decreased the dressing it was still way too much. next time i will just lightly brush the crust w/ a pastry brush for the dressing. thanks for an awesome new way for me to use my homemade crust!

Yum, this was so good. Hubby hates bleu cheese, so we used ranch dressing instead. And he finally believes me that buffalo sauce is simply hot sauce and butter! I did put some sauteed red onions on my side of the pizza, which I thought was a nice addition. We'll have this again.

This is the best!  I made a rectangle pizza and I only made one breast and mixed up the sauce for that amount.  So I did 1/4 of the pizza with this and the rest a traditional.  My son even loved this pizza.  I used ranch, as I had not bleu cheese and not sure he would like it, but I can not wait to try with bleu cheese.  I can not wait to make for a crowd.  I browned my chicken lighly in a pan of a little olive oil, after both sides are browned add 3/4 cup of water put the lid and let set 15 min. You have really moist chicken, slice and dice. Thank you!!

Loved this!  I've been hesitating making this because I was afraid it would be too unhealthy, but decided to make it for a dinner for my brothers.  So glad I did, they said it was the best pizza ever!  I mixed in some bbq sauce with the buffalo sauce for the kids pizza so it wouldn't be too spicey and added sauteed onions and bell peppers to the other pizza.  Fantastic!  Will make this again for sure - it's not as unhealthy as I had thought :) !

I thought this was really tasty but my husband didn't care for it. To be fair, he's not a big hot sauce fan anyways, so I wasn't expecting much from him.  I would definately make this again for myself though, so thanks!

This pizza was a hit with my kids. They are very picky eater and tasted better than the restaurant that they usually get it at. I marinated the chicken in a buffalo wing sauce bought at the store and added the melted butter. I just coated the pizza crust with the Blue cheese dressing. I also made the crust thin.
enjoy

This was the BEST pizza we have ever made at home, and the same as if not better than the one at our local pizza shop.  We used a Mama Marys pre-made crust.  I used Ranch because that is what I had, and just painted a thin coating on the pizza to where it looked good.  I used only 2 breasts on a large pizza and that was enough IMO.  I cooked it in a skillet, let it cool a bit and shredded it by hand.  I mixed that in with the butter and hot sauce  and spread it on the pizza.  My crust called for a 7-10 minute cook time , at about 6 minutes I turned off the oven and turned on the broiler and watched it carefully.  We had it on their regular crust ,and again for dinner on a thin style crust, it was that good.  As far as cheese goes I don't think I used a full 8 oz.  It didn't need it and I was afraid of the pizza getting weighed down.  Oil the bottom of your crust.  The crust we used held everything perfectly and was crisp.  Highly recommend.

Overall, a pretty good quick and easy recipe.  I think it is important to choose a dressing and hot sauce you love, because that is where most of the flavor comes from.  I left out the butter because a few of the reviews mentioned greasiness.  I felt like it needed some crunch, next time I will coat my baking pan with olive oil to crisp the bottom crust.

This was great.  When I first mentioned chicken pizza to my husband his instant response was "I don't like chicken pizza" then I told him the ingredients and he agreed to try it.  He likes to cook as well and ended up making this almost all himself.  We cooked the chicken on the grill and only used two breasts because ours were pretty large.  Once they cooled a little we sliced they into about 1/4" strips and then mixed them with the hot sauce which we actually used a wing sauce from our favorite wing restuarant, Quaker Steak and Lube.  The crust we bought was one that came in a tube in your refrigerator section.  This made bake time a little longer, but I think it was better than prebaked crust...and we like it a bit thinner.  We also added some blue cheese crumbles before the blue cheese dressing because we like blue cheese.  We can't wait to make this again.

It was ok.  I think that the bleu-cheese dressing, even reduced was a little overwhelming.

Oh so fantastic! This is my favorite pizza recipe. I do not use the whole bottle of dressing, it's just way too much. I use enough for a very, very thin layer to cover the entire pizza and that's it. Not even a half bottle.

This recipe is a definite keeper!! I followed the recipe and did not pre-bake the crust.  It came out perfect.  The crust was nice and brown and crispy.  Not soggy at all.  I won't change a thing.  Thank you so much!!!

LOVED it!  Next time - will only use 1 1/2 - 2 breast, 3 was A LOT!  I think you could use 1 1/2 and cube small & would be perfect!  I boiled & shredded my chicken this time, used a Pilsbury crust that I formed into a circle on my pizza stone.  I also used 1 1/2 times the hot sauce & butter mix b/c some had said there wasn't enough but we decided it would probably be plenty hot for us, only used about 1/2 a bottle of dressing, think 1 bottle would be too much & make the crust soggy.  Tricked my husband who doesn't like Blue Cheese - he thought it was Ranch!  I just never said anything as he was calling it Ranch.  Also, didn't use a whole bag of cheese, just what I thought looked like enough & that was about 1/2 or just over?  This one's a keeper for sure though!!    Made a 2nd time - 1 1/2 chicken breasts & Boboli thin crust were perfect!

My boyfriend stated this was "the best homemade pizza" he had ever eaten. I changed a few things about the recipe though - I used a 12 inch crust and shredded meat from one breast and thigh of a plain rotisserie chicken. I then mixed the chicken with the hot sauce, melted butter, and a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce and put it in the fridge for a few hours. I did use the blue cheese dressing and added a few thinly sliced red onions to the top and used a mozzarella and provolone cheese mix. Overall, a great pizza.

When your husband responds with "I don't think I've ever had a better pizza anywhere else" you know you have a winner! All I can say is YUM, yum, and yum... Let me start by saying, I am not a fan of blue cheese, yuck really, but it totally works on this pizza - give it a shot.. I took another's advise and let the chicken marinate for about an hour in the sauce, also sliced a red onion very thinly and added that. This was so good both my husband and I wanted to eat more even though we were so full. I would give this more then five stars if possible...

DELICIOUS!  I followed some of the other reviews and shredded my chicken.  I also used ranch dressing since we don't like blue cheese.  We had some friends over for dinner and they said this is the best pizza they've ever had.  From now on we're making our own!!!  I'm definitely making this again.

I made this tonight on a whim. When I say there are only crumbs left in the pan, I am not exaggerating! This pizza was very yummy, and the hubs gives it two thumbs up! I did subsitute bleu cheese dressing with buttermilk ranch, and used 4 oz of cheddar and 4 oz of mozzarella cheeses. I also precooked and shredded my chicken instead of cubing it. I figure you'd get more of the 'buffalo wing' taste in each bite with shredded chicken. Overall, very satisfied with this recipe!

Love this recipe! Just the right amount of heat. Anyone that I have made this for that didn't like it, was only because they couldn't handle the heat! Thanks for this unique and tasty recipe.

This turned out really well.  I used a Boboli pre-made crust.  I followed other users exmples and just brushed on enough Blue Cheese dressing to coat.  I used Ken's Steakhouse Chunky Blue Cheese, but next time I might go with a different brand, it just lacked something.  Instead of cubing I shreded the chicken then mixed it a little bit in a mixer with the butter and hot sauce.  Next time I would soak the chicken in the hot sauce to seal in the flavor, it lost some of it's spice while it was baking in the oven.  But that was easily fixed by adding more hot sauce and dressing after it was baked.

This was the best pizza I've ever had (eaten and made myself).  I'm not sure if I used the 16' crust, but I didn't use 8oz of dressing.  I may have used about a 1/4 cup (I used ranch, since that's what we prefer.  I shredded the chicken.  I also added some garlic salt, just sprinkled it over the dressing before I added the chicken/hot sauce mixture.  Thanks for sharing!!!

I used just a 1/2 bottle of blue cheese dressing and added red onion on top of the pizza before baking.  Also, I drizzled hot sauce on top before serving because my household loves spicy things.  Delicious.

my husband absolutely loves this!!!! he would eat it everyday if he could. it is very fattening so i cut it back by using pre-made whole wheat pizza crust. low-fat cheddar cheese and and lite blue cheese dressing.very easy to make. and very different and good.

This was absolutely awesome!! I shredded the chicken instead of cutting it into cubes for a smoother looking pizza once it had been cooked. We always have this pizza when we do homemade pizzas. Thanks for an easy and delictable recipe!

This was outstanding! I pretty much made it just as is, with one exception. I used a little more chicken so I used a litle more hot sauce (Franks Red Hot Buffalo Wing Sauce). I don't like things quite as spicy, so I added more butter. The best way to make sure your sauce is the way you want it is to make it up in a bowl before pouring it on the chicken. The more butter you add=the less spicy. You can do it to your own taste! This is how we used to make our wings in college. Thanks so much for the recipe!

This was really good.  I used low fat dressing - I agree with another reviewer - low fat dressing just doesn't cut it on this pizza.  I used Tabasco mild jalapeno sauce to ensure everyone could enjoy it.

OH WOW!  this was good!! I substitued the blue cheese dressing with Ranch, and didnt use the whole bottle and same for the hot sauce I used Franks Buffalo wing sauce and just mixed it to my disgression with the butter and chicken. I was a little scared to use whole bottles as by the reviews some said was too much. But next time I will add more dressing to the pizza and kick it up a notch with the hot sauce! lol but over all delish!!! Will definately make again!

YUM.  Loved this recipe.  I didn't measure out the dressing, just spread a layer of it on the crust.  Everything was just delicious.  DH didn't think he'd like it, but ended up liking it anyway.  This had totally cured my craving that I had for buffalo wings.

i made this recipe into a healthy pizza by using a whole wheat crust, omitting the butter, using fat free blue cheese dressing (just enough to cover the crust)and low fat mozzarella.  The pizza was very good however i do not recommend the fat free dressing. I don't think blue cheese is meant to be fat free. It just did not have a very good flavor. I will make again and use something different. Maybe a lite ranch.

Made this on Sunday and it was very good. I rated it 4 stars because I did make some changes because of what I had in the house. I used Frank's Hot Sauce and used more than the recipe called for and used ranch dressing because I did not have bleu cheese. I also made my own dough and made it very thin....turned out great. Kids loved it and said they would eat it again. This will probably be a staple in our house from now on. Thanks.

This is a great recipe and I only gave it 4 stars because the amount of ingredients. If you use the recommended  amount of blue cheese it is too runny. I just use enough to cover the pizza crust. I use T Margetti Ultimate blue cheese and Frank's wing sauce. I also don't think you need as much wing sauce as the recipe ask for. Just enough to coat the chicken will do. 

We use Mama Mary's pizza crust which is the only one I can find at the store, but it is really good.

This is now a family favorite with the needed adjustments.

I was thinking of trying it next with some blue cheese crumbles as well, and will have to see how it taste.

EXCELLENT PIZZA. ITS DEFINETLY A KEEPER!! USED FRESH DOUGH AND DUSTED THE BOTTOM WITH CORMEAL! USED KRAFTS BLUE CHEESE DRESSING JUST ENOUGH DRESSING TO COVER THE PIZZA, NOT WHOLE BOTTLE! SO GOOD, I SHARED THE RECIPE WITH MY COWORKERS, A MUST TRY.

This was fantastic! It is not only fast and easy but delicious too.  I used Jay Signature Crust on here for the crust. Excellent combo!

This turned out great!  I changed it a little. I cooked my chicken by boiling it for 45 minutes to keep it juicy then I cubed it.  I also used Rhodes frozen bread dough for the crust. And I used cheddar and mozzarella cheese.  Thanks for the recipe!

OMG this was soooo good. And yeah I just put enough dressing on to give the pizza a sauce. I might try adding blue cheese crumbles to the mozza cheese on top as well. Mmmmm.....Oh gosh I am dreaming of it now and want more. Hmmm....

I have been making this since January and my review has vanished, so here I am reviewing it again!  This pizza is awesome!!  I have made it SEVERAL times now.  I use Ranch dressing rather than bleu cheese and use both pizza blend cheese and taco blend cheese. This is a favorite in my house!  Thanks (again) for sharing this awesome recipe!!!!

This recipe is outstanding.  My family loved it!  They don't like anything.  I used a store bought thin & crispy wheat pizza crust and ranch dressing instead of Blue Cheese.  I will definetely make this again.

This recipie is FANTASTIC! My boyfriend loves it. We use good blue cheese dressing. We prefer the one with teh red onion on it. It really makes a difference to what kind of blus cheese dressing you use. This pizza has become our friday night pizza. We make it at least once a month. Serve with Apricot Hefeweizen.

This was really good. I didnt use a whole bottle of dressing though, as i feared it would make the toppings slide off. Next time i probably won't use as much of the hot sauce, because it proved to be slightly overpowering after the 2nd slice or so. Yummy overall, though!

I just got done eating this pizza, but I didn't follow the exact recipe.  I cubed the chicken before I cooked it (it's easier to cut when it's still a little frozen)--I added about a Tbsp of olive oil to the skillet then seasoned the chicken with garlic powder and chili powder.   I used the same amount of butter and hot sauce as in the recipe, but I used unsalted butter and it tasted just fine.  I also did not use as much dressing (I actually used ranch because I don't like blue cheese) and it was great--in fact it was almost too much.  I put a layer of cheddar cheese on the pre-cooked crust as others suggested then I spread the dressing with a spoon.  I added the chicken mixture then layered some more cheddar then some mozzarella on top.  As an avid learner of cooking and baking and a bride to be, I feel I did a pretty good job (and if my fiance liked dressing, I think he would have felt the same way!)

My husband and I are self-proclaimed buffalo wing connoisseurs. This pizza was so delicious! I will definitely make it again. I too used Frank's Redhot Buffalo Wing sauce in place of the hot sauce. I used Litehouse Chunky Blue Cheese dressing - the only blue cheese dressing we buy. I also chopped one stalk of celery and sprinkled it with the chicken - an idea taken from a local pizzeria that gave it a little crunch.

My husband made this using home made pizza dough.  He used only two chicken breasts and half the bottle of buffalo sauce.  He thinks cilantro would have been a good addition to the pizza.

This was pretty good, but one of my kids thought the blue cheese tasted funny (didn't fit into his pizza schema I guess). 

Picked up a mojo rotisserie chicken from Publix and shredded all the white meat, made it super easy and quick. Mixed Frank's Red Hot with a Buffalo Wing Sauce. 

Next time I'll take the advice of another reviewer and make the Bill's Blue Cheese recipe from this site.

Came back to change my rating to 5 stars. I used budweiser wing sauce mixed with quite a bit of Frank's red hot. Also added cheddar cheese and onion.

This was soooo good!  I used 2-12" pizza crusts but doubled the topping recipe.  I used blue cheese dressing on one, and ranch dressing on the other.  My husband loved it!  I also used Frank's hot sauce.  This recipe was definatly a keeper!

I thought this was great. I didn't measure out my ingredients exactly and it still tasted delicious. I would recommend only using mozzarella cheese as a topping. We didn't have enough mozzarella and so I did put a little mild cheddar and that part just didn't taste right. I also used Frank's hot sauce as recommended by others and a Boboli original prebaked crust. For the blue cheese I used Marzetti's light blue cheese dressing and it was great - I don't think you have to go full fat to enjoy this pizza.

I loved this pizza and I know that my husband if he had been home when I made it would of thought it was the best.  My 3 year old ate one slice but didn't take the usual second slice I think maybe it was a little spicy for his taste. But I will definitely make this again for my husband.

Definitely will make again. I used Monterey jack and Parmesan cheese also.  My bleu cheese dressing was Litehouse brand.  Used a homemade dough recipe and spead some olive oil on top before the dressing so the dough wouldn't get soggy.

Loved this recipe.  Next time I will add more hot sauce for extra bite, and less Mozzarella.  I added green onions and used a Boboli crust worked great and saved time.  I will definitely make this again!

Love the taste of this one but it really needs to be on a thin crust because it's not substantial enough for Jay's Signature Pizza Crust.  I know this because that's what I used with this recipe.  The crust was awesome, the toppings are good but they aren't a good match together.  Next time this is going on a thin crust so there is better balance.

This was great. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because I thought the proportions were a little off. I only used about 2/3 cup of dressing and two chicken breasts. The flavor was delicious and the recipe was very easy. I will definitely make this again as a quick dinner or party food.

Great base pizza but you have to tweek it a little to your likings. I used ranch dressing instead of blue cheese, a rotissere chicken shredded then soaked in Franks wing sauce, and a mixture of mozz and cheddar cheese. I used Pillsberry pizza dough and pre-cooked it before adding the toppings. Make sure to add extra hot sauce accordingly or you could end up with a bland pizza.

Totally awesome! I am from Buffalo NY, home of the buffalo wings......
For those not liking the blue cheese, that is a huge ingredient for true authenticity (don't tell anyone from Buffalo you ever mix ranch with your wings:) Franks Red Hot is the prefered sauce, BTW, and I find using butter is not necessary. I used reduced fat dressing and cheese (my feeble attempt at making this healthier!!)
This is a really cool recipe I would've never thought of....thanks for sharing!
UPDATED REVIEW: My husband just admitted that he HATED this, so I changed it to 4 stars.

This was perfect.  I used Bill's Blue Cheese recipe also from this site.  I will say this pizza is a bit rich, which I found  made it last longer.  This will become a regular in our home

The boys LOVED this!  Hubby couldn't stop eating it.  I made 2 pizza's, one with the Blue Cheese Dressing and the other with Ranch Dressing---everyone liked both.  Also used a combo of cheddar and mozzarella cheeses. I used Jay's Signature Crust recipe from this site.

My husband made this pizza last night as he is the avid pizza maker in our house.
We thought it was delicious. Used extra blue cheese as dipping sauce. Fattening but very good! Will make again.

Wow! What a great surprise! Made last night and marinaded the chicken in the wing sauce before cooking. I did not use as much dressing or wing sauce and it was still pretty sloppy until it cooled down a bit. Nice change from regular pizza. 
Would like to get some veggies on it next time.

LOVE IT!!!  This is soooo yummy!  My family & I love hot wings and are always looking for the next best place to get them! & my family is pizza crazy! So this was PERFECT! We don't like blue cheese, so I took other's advice & used ranch...but only enough to cover the ready-made pizza crust. I used Moore's Buffalo Wing Sauce instead of hot sauce...just love the flavor!  Hubby said it was the best *&#% pizza he's ever had & that I could make it as often as I want! Thanks for posting this one!

Really good! A nice change up from the ordinary pepperoni or sausage pizza. I was a bit skeptical with the dressing, since I've never been a fan of blue cheese. But I found with the combinations of other flavors, it is perfect. I used double the amount of hot sauce (the hotter the better is my motto). Great recipe.

This recipe was great. I used Franks Red hot Buffalo wing sauce instead of the tabasco sauce. I didn't add the blue cheese sauce to the pizza but used it as a dipping sauce. I took the advice of another  reviewer and made the blue cheese dressing from this site. I will be making this recipe again.

This pizza is AMAZING! I use less dressing- and add more blue cheese crumbles. We also started adding cut celery to the top of the pizza when it comes out of the oven. Perfection!

Good change of pizza pace.  Used "Bill's Blue Chees Dressing" from this site.  Only needs 2 chicken breasts.  May be good with grilled onions.

I really like my wings with blue cheese dressing, but the blue cheese on the pizza wasn't so great.  It was good and did taste like wings, but the dressing was so overpowering that I will use ranch next time.

This is so super simple to put together yet has incredible flavor!  My family loved it!  I too used the homemade version of the Blue Cheese dressing & it was fabulous.  However, I made the dressing right before putting it on the pizza (not realizing it was supposed to sit for 24 hrs.).  It probably would have had more tang had I let it sit.  But it was still yummy!  I will make this again!

This was sooooooo good. The only thing I changed was Ranch dressing instead of blue cheese only because my husband doesn't like blue cheese!! And I shredded the chicken instead of cubing it too. It was definitely a crowd pleaser!

One word:  SALTY!

I took others' advice and only used enough blue cheese dressing to coat the pizza crust, not smother it, as the directions seem to indicate using the whole bottle.  I also used only a few dashes of hot sauce, again unlike the recipe.

I like the idea of the recipe, but this one is waaaaay too salty for my tastes.  I actually like the local pizza joint's version better!  And I'm not a fan of premade food.

I made the pizza crust and blue cheese dressing from scratch (per another viewers suggestion) and loved the combination of the thick blue cheese dressing; I didn't even need much cheese over the pizza.  The flavor combination was very good and I love a unique pizza.  I didn't use nearly all the chicken, but I'm sure I'll find some use for it.

My family really liked this pizza.  Even my picky eight year old. I used Tabasco hot sauce because we love hot food.

This was excellent! I was skeptical at first because I am not a blue cheese fan. I also used "Bills Blue Cheese Dressing" recipe listed on this site. It was so good. Very rich. I used a Boboli thin crust and I had too much dressing. This would probably do 2 pizzas. I used Oscar Meyer precooked chicken. This would also be good on a wrap. Thanks for sharing. My 7 year old son loved this!

Yummy!  Made homemade bread machine crust, sauteed chicken w/salt,pepper, garlic powder and 1/2 a red onion.  Put butter and hot sauce in pan with chicken after chicken was cooked through.  Also, used sliced mozzarella and put that on blue cheese before placing chicken mixture over cheese.  Very tasty!

I tried the Pizza - I do like the flavors.  If you're not sure if everyone else will like it - try it on a tortilla first.  Same ingredients.. Put the chix and cheese on - heat in micro, then the sauces, roll and eat!

This was outstanding when I served it for the "big game." I used two chicken breasts (perfect amount for a large pizza serviing just two), Franks Red Hot Sauce and just enough Light Done Right ranch dressing to coat the crust. The whole bottle would have been too much. I also used Chebe bread as the pizza crust and baked that before I put the toppings on it. I couldn't wait to inhale the leftovers the next day for lunch.

OMG!  the best pizza I have ever had. I am a lover of buffalo chicken.  I upped the amount of hot sauce, and used a little less dressing, to suit my taste.  My husband even loved it!

Very tasty! I used pre-cooked diced chicken breast and light ranch dressing instead of blue cheese (not a fan).  made this for along time with the pre-cooked pizza shells, but am now addicted tot he fresh baked taste of the refrigerated dough!  YummY!

Great pizza!  If you like Buffalo style chicken wings you will love this recipe!  I made my own crust - very easy with a bread maker - and took the advice of other reviewers and used just enough blue cheese dressing to cover the crust in the same manner as you would if you were using pizza sauce.  It makes a very rich tasting pizza with the combined creaminess of the salad dressing and the cheese.  Reheats very well the next day for lunch.  Great recipe!

Delish!  We loved it!  We, too used only enough bleu cheese dressing to cover the pizza shell.  I sauteed the chicken cubes in the butter and hot sauce and then marinated it in the remaining sauce until we were ready to eat.  We purchased our favorite bleu and hot sauce from Texas Roadhouse.  The best bleu around by far!  It was so spicy and yummy.  We'll definitly make again.  We also used a combination of cheddar and mozz. for the topping.

Delicious...just make sure you use a pre-baked crust, and cut WAY down on the dressing.  i made with Ranch instead of Blue Cheese.  would be great with some crumbled bacon too!

I used Light Ranch because we don't like blue cheese and precooked chicken fajita meat from the store. My husband loved it, exclaiming that we didn't even need ranch to dip our pizza in because it's built in. We will definitely make again!

It was awesome the whole family loved it!
Couple minor changes due to our dairy allergies. But just as good with soy cheese mix of jack, cheddar and mozzarella. I also used margarine instead of butter and a ranch substitute. Dishes can sometimes fall apart when you substitute the dairy but not this it was great.

we made this for what we called the 'supper bowl' since there was soooo much food! i made this with the boboli crust (which i would recommend baking first and then adding toppings and reheat to melt the cheese...) first, of all...there was enough for 2 pizzas, plus i didn't use that much dressing...i schmeared it on the pizza not too thick...a nice suble flavor! guests raved..the ones who don't like buffalo sauce we're skeptical....
i will make it again....

We loved this recipe.  Used 2 Boboli 11" crust(not the thin crust) and divided the ingredients between them, baked in the oven on the rack without a pan for 10 minutes.  The crust was nice and crisp and the topping delicious. Will make again and again.

Wow.  This is so very, very bad for you - but so very, very tasty!  I used pre-cooked Italian-style grilled chicken, and only as much blue cheese dressing as I would tomato sauce on a traditional pizza.  The way I made it, this ended up being a very solid pizza - the top was almost all chicken - but very, very tasty!  I used a Boboli crust (not the thin kind) and pre-baked it for five minutes or so; the pizza was gooey, but not soggy.  Would have been fabulous with some scallions on top, but I forgot to buy them.  I'm sure we'll have this again as often as the fella can convince me to make it!

Very good...I used a frozen vegetarian chicken substitute and let it sit in the hot sauce for about 15 min. Meanwhile i brushed the unbaked crust with olive oil and cayenne pepper then pre-baked for about 8 min. I used about 1/4 to 1/2 a bottle of extra chunky bleu cheese dressing, then topped with chicken/hot sauce, cheddar cheese and red onions and baked for 10 to 15 min. The end result was chewy on the inside and crispy on the outside...perfect!!

We love this recipe.  I added other pizza toppings to the mix and only used about 1/3 of the blue cheese dressing.  It was great right out of the oven and for left overs the following day.

This was a very good pizza and quite easy to make. I used a Boboli crust, so I did not use a whole bottle of dressing. I also cut the hot sauce by just a couple tablespoons. I used a "regular" hot sauce, not an "extreme". It was still hot enough for my family.
Enjoy!

I simply can't say enough- this was the best pizza I've ever had- I used only 4oz of Bill's blue cheese off this site- buffalo chicken & pizza- it was a marriage made in heaven!  I brought the leftovers for lunch today- can't wait for my break.  Thanks so much

I added chopped onions and crushed pineapple to this recipe. With half of the dressing, this pizza was a winner!  Have already received requests for repeats of this delicious and unique recipe.

I got a late start getting this ready for a party, so I used frozen chicken tenders (breaded and pre-cooked...I heated them according to the package, then cubed them) and the Valentino's  pizza crust recipe from this site ( needs no rising time). I used Ranch instead of blue cheese. It was a big hit at the party....gone in about 10 minutes.

If you like blue cheese and buffalo wings this is for you!  I sprinkled a little extra blue cheese in the blue cheese dressing and for the crust I half baked a Pillsury pizza crust. Very good!

Made this for the Superbowl.  No one ate their entire piece.  I made half ranch, half blue cheese, and followed everything else exactly.  I don't know, this just wasn't that great.

This is an ultra-rich pizza...but is it ever good!!  Believe it or not, I've never eaten Buffalo Chicken Wings, so I wasn't sure what to expect, but we loved this.  I made the dressing using "Bill's Blue Cheese Dressing" recipe.  Next time I make this recipe I plan to cut down the amount of dressing by just a bit, and I think I'd also like a mix of cheddar and mozzarella cheese instead of all mozzarella.  I also think just the mix of the chicken (minus the pizza crust), would make a fantastic dip.  I'll be trying that as well.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Great pizza! Family said it needed salt and I only used 10 oz of blue cheese. May cut back to only 8 oz next time cause it oozed out when I was cutting pizza and we thought it overpowered the chicken.

I followed the recipe and had enough ingredients to make two pizzas. Instead of cubing the chicken, I shredded it. I was surprised at how good it tasted.

I thought this was really good - just as good as the popular pizza chains!  I did as some of the other reviewers did and used Ranch dressing, just enough to cover the crust, but I think blue cheese would give it a little more zip.  I also only used a 12" crust, b/c that's all I could find, so I had a lot of chicken and cheese!  I used Budweiser's Chicken Wing Sauce - yum, yum good!!

This recipe was so easy that my husband was able to make it!  To be honest, I didnt know what to expect at first but after the first bite, I was in love.  This is definitely a "must-try" dish. It's like chicken wings without the bones and mess with all the good flavor.

5 stars??? Try 10!!! This was AWESOME! My boyfriend couldn't stop saying "mmmmmm". Just the two of us ate almost the whole thing for dinner. We don't like bleu cheese, so I used ranch dressing instead... and probably only 6-8 oz of it. I used Frank's Red Hot Buffalo Hot Wing sauce and I did up the amount to probably about a cup. I made this with Quick & Easy Pizza Crust from this site. Yum Yum Yum!

The taste on this was GREAT, but I cannot imagine putting a whole bottle of bleu cheese.  Is that a typo?  I put about half, and when we picked up the pieces of pizza to take a bite, the chicken and cheese layer just slid right off into the pan because of the slippery dressing.  It was a huge mess, but a very tasty mess.  Next time I will use about a cup of bleu cheese.  Also, my hot sauce bottles are 12 oz.  I don't see them around here in a tiny 2 ounce size.

This was a hit with our family, including an 8 year old and a teen. Used a pre-packaged thin crust, 3/4 cup Ranch dressing.  Cooked cubed chicken in a mix of 2 TBSP melted butter/2 oz of hot sauce. Drained then marinated cooked chicken in another mix of just 1 TBSP melted butter/1oz hot sauce. Topped with 8 oz. pizza blend shredded cheese.  A keeper recipe.

Awesome!  I bought a Boboli crust, used a bottle of spicy garlic chicken wing sauce and mixed it with 2 tsp. hot sauce.  I made two for couple's game night...one with 1 cup Blue Cheese Dressing and one with 1 cup Ranch.  (You don't need to use a ton of dressing!)I cut both pizzas in to square pieces and set it out for the grazing! The Ranch pizza was devoured in about 10 minutes but I had lots of left overs from the blue cheese one.  I would do the ranch one again, but not the blue cheese. Just our personal taste.

Awesome pizza if you love hot wings.  The only change I made was to decrease the amount of hot sauce and dressing.  I was afraid the chicken might be to spicy and the entire pizza to "runny" if I used the amounts listed in recipe.  It turned out great!

This is sheer genius!
Though with the chicken, what I did was boil it and then I used a frying pan and melted butter added alot of ketchup, mustard, a little worchesire sauce, tabasco sauce and mixed it with the boiled chicken making it buffalo chicken.
Then i just placed it on top of Bills Blue Cheese Dip and it was the best  homemade pizza I have ever tasted.

This recipe was just O.K. for me.  Boyfriend said it was alright but not great.  We love hot hot buffalo wings, I did add some tabasco to the Franks Hot Sauce but the blue cheese seemed to cut the heat.

My husband and I made this recipe last night, it was pretty good- we used about 1/3 of the salad dressing it called for and would probably use a little less next time. Great quick dinner with a salad.

Quick and easy recipe.  As suggested I only used enough dressing to cover the crust like a sauce a full bottle would have been WAY too much.  I found out that I am not a blue cheese fan after making this the first time, but subbing ranch the second time really work great.  You can adjust the temperature of the chicken by adding more hot sauce and less butter for spicy or less hot sauce more butter for a milder taste.  Recipe is great but missing a little something.. maybe some cilantro or peppers, might try that next time.

Excellent, especially with my home-made pizza crust.  Used about 1/2 the amount of hot sauce and it was more than sufficient.

As is, I don't even know if this is edible (way too much bleu cheese).  But with changes it is a 5+ recipe.  I used the pillsbury roll-out crust and followed the baking directions for it, brushing it with a mixture of parmesan, garlic, and olive oil; second (like others) I spread enough bleu cheese on the crust to just cover it; next I mixed the chicken with wing sauce, a few drops of hot sauce, and some chopped parsley; and finally (also like others) I use a combination of cheddar and mozzerella (mainly out of necessity- I had very little mozz.).  With the above changes, this is probably one of the best pizzas I have ever eaten.

I used a Pillsbury crust, just out of ease.  But they are never good.  Next time I will use a homemade crust.  I agree with not using the whole bottle of dressing.  About 1/2 a bottle is plenty!  A good recipe that will be in my weekend rotation of easy and delicious!

I used a pizza crust from publix, used homemade blue cheese dressing (recipe from Ina Garten). The homemade blue chesse is thick and works well on this recipe. We picked up a rotisserie chicken and tossed the shredded chicken in the hot sauce. I completely forgot to prebake the crust and because the dressing was so thick it turned out great! Better than the recipe I had tried to improvise last year.

I made this recipe for my boyfriend one evening. I'm not a cook by any means, but this was a simple recipe that even I could make. We both love buffalo chicken, so ofcourse we both loved this dinner! I changed a few things in my version though. I used mild buffalo sauce from a famous buffalo wings chain, Ranch dressing instead of blue cheese and a pizza cheese blend instead of just mozz. Also, I didn't use anywhere near the amount of dressing recommended. This made for a great dinner, and I'm definitely making it again.

This pizza was awesome. My family loves spicy hot wings and pizza so it was the best of both worlds. I only used about 1/2 a cup of Ranch dressing, instead of a whole bottle, and it turned out perfectly. I will most definitely make this again.

Yummy pizza!  I substituted chopped up Perdue pre-cooked chicken breast pieces and used a thin crust boboli.  Everyone enjoyed it. I'll put it in my dinner rotation:)

I had a cold when I made this, so couldn't taste it myself AT ALL, but bf said it was a 10, which makes it a 5 here. So, thanks, great recipe :)

MUST use homemade blue cheese dressing here, not bottled.

This was soooo good! My husband loved it. He is a BIG hot wing fan. I used a rotisseri chicken, spicy ranch instead of blue cheese and I also used Franks Red Hot Sauce. It came out great!! I will be making this again!

Excellent! I have directed family members to this recipe. I used a hot wing sauce (no butter) instead of hot sauce, and ranch dressing instead of blue cheese. I love this soooo much. I have made it three times already and even as I am looking at it now, I want to make it again.

Great recipe! But made a few adjustments: with help from other reviews. I only used 1 cup of blue cheese, a whole bottle seemed too excessive, I shredded the chicken with hot sauce and butter and set it aside for about 30 minutes to soak. (also added more hot sauce, as we like our food a bit spicy). All in all great recipe and only made a few minor modifications. OH! and also used Jay's Signature Pizza Crust! :) YUM-O!

Delicious!  I used ranch and added some green onions.  I didn't use as much dressing or as much hot sauce.  Just as much as you can handle of both!

Delicious idea, and I'm not really a fan of either Buffalo wings or pizza.  Needs some adjustment, as other reviewers have mentioned: prebake crust, use less dressing.  I also used leftover turkey instead of chicken - about 1 cup, with one Tbsp butter and hot sauce to taste.  I used half a bag (4 oz)of reduced-fat mozzarella for my 12" crust (I purchased dough from my local supermarket).

I definitely agree with the others that a whole bottle of salad dressing would be overkill.  Other than that, recipe was fine, I would make this again.

This was amazing... my husband loved it!  I used shredded chicken (boiled breasts then shredded and chopped), and blue cheese dressing and hot sauce TO TASTE (not the whole bottle).  Also omitted the butter and topped with mozzarella and cheddar cheeses.  Can't wait to make this again!

This is a good recipe, but for us the bluecheese dressing was way too overpowering. I used Kens Steakhouse & only used 1/2 of the bottle.  I also used the pillsbury pizza crust. I will make this again, but will use the boboli & not as much dressing.
PS My hubby complained of heartburn that evening. sorry =(

Really good. My only complaint is that it was a little runny. Next time I think I will use real blue cheese crumbles and cream cheese as the base. Thanks!!

Awesome!  Used Wishbone Ranch instead of Bleu Cheese, and just enough to cover the crust (not the whole bottle) as many have commented on.  Mix chicken with the Franks Red Hot and butter, top with cheese on a whole wheat crust - excellent!

A friend passed along this recipe from this site.  One of our favorites!!!  We get lots of compliments when we serve it to guests.  I use the original Boboli crust, Kraft blue cheese dressing (enough to cover the crust, not a whole bottle), and a friend's hot sauce recipe (includes Texas Pete, butter, oregano and a splash of Italian dressing.  YUM!

We really liked this recipe.  I used a mix for the crust.  I used ranch dressing as the base and added blue cheese crumbles to half the pizza. (have one who doesn't care for blue cheese).  I followed others suggestions of just mixing the chicken with hot sauce.  This was easy recipe to make and tasted really good.  Can't get anything like this at our local pizzaria.  Will make again and add to my permanant file.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Fantastic!!!!  I've made this recipe 3 times since I discovered it 3 weeks ago.  I even shared the recipe with my co-workers!  I used light blue cheese dressing (just enough to cover the bottom), no butter, reduced-fat cheese, & just enough hot sauce to coat the chicken.  Also, I used fresh pizza dough from the bakery.  Awesome!

This was good.  I am always worried when I try new recipes that it will not be good and I'll have wasted the food and money but this one was a success.  Very simple.  I used a Jiffy crust mix and topped it with a fairly thin layer of ranch dressing.  I shredded some extra cooked chicken tenders and mixed them with some Frank's RedHot Sauce, but not nearly a whole bottle and topped with prepackaged "Pizza Cheese".  It was great!

This was really really good! Like a lot of other reviewers, I reduced the amt. of bleu cheese dressing. I put the same amount as I would regular pizza sauce on a pizza - just enough to cover the crust. I used Boboli crust and it came out perfect.

The leftovers, even after freezing it and reheating it, were even better!

Normally I read the reviews before I try a recipe but this time I didn't. I wish I had because the amount of bleu cheese dressing was way too much and it did overpower the pizza. The overall taste was really good and I will definitely try it again. Next time I will put only the same amount of dressing as I would tomato sauce if I were making a regular pizza.

Maybe this pizza is an acquired taste? I followed the recipe to the T, and really regretted it. I thought the bleu cheese taste waaay overpowered the chicken. IF I were to make this again I would definitely follow the suggestion of others and greatly reduce the amount of bleu cheese.

since i already had "buffalo-style" frozen chicken breasts, i omitted the hot sauce.  i used about 1/4 cup of dressing and put the rest out for dipping.  my mom says that it'"restaurant quality", and that's saying something.  i can't wait to try it with hot sauce!

The flavor was good - I personally feel it would be perfect if you added bacon to the top as well.  As the pizza cooled the crust got soggy - next time I will try a different dressing.  I will make it again!!!  Thanks!

Excellent!  I've had this twice in less than a week.  I used Oscar Meyer Chicken Strips (Southwestern), 6 oz blue cheese, 0.5 oz of Tabasco Sauce, 8 oz bag of Mozarella, and a regular sized pizza crust, and it came out super yummy both times.  Highly recommend this dish and have told other people about it.  Took only ten minutes in the oven at 425.

My husband loved this recipe!  I used a good amount of ranch instead of blue cheese.  In fact I used that "too good to be true, 2 grams of fat" ranch, and it tasted great!  I think next time I'll try with 4 cheese mexican mix.. yummy!  We added some extra hot sauce too.  Sooo good! (I made this with Jay's pizza crust III).

This was the best pizza!  I made this for my Bunco group and everybody loved it and asked for the recipe so they could make it for their husbands.  Can't wait to make it again for my family.

This pizza is awesome.  I love to make it for my family.  I use two chicken breasts though and a little less blue cheese.  I made it once before and used the blue cheese on the receipe but it was too much and spilled over the pizza making it really messy.  I think I've finally got it down now.

This pizza was yummy in my tummy! It didn't quite taste like the Pizza Hut Buffalo Chicken Pizza that I had hoped for but it was still delicious! I added an extra ounce of hot sauce and I only used enough blue cheese to cover the pizza.  I also added ranch to the blue cheese..I will definetely make it again! Thanks!

My husband loved this! He loves anything buffalo. One change I made, instead of using butter I used 6oz of melted cream cheese. It made it oh so yummy! I also only used a half cup of blue cheese and a little xtra Frank's Red Hot.

This was yummy.  A little too blue cheesy for me though.  I breaded and fried the chicken before putting it on the pizza.  I also added some thinly sliced red onions and a couple more douses of red hot.  I love that stuff.  I'll definitely make this again.

This pizza was wonderful!!!  I went with what some other reviewers said and used ranch dressing instead of the blue cheese.  I only used about a 1/4 to a 1/2 cup of the dressing.  After putting the chicken and the hot sauce mixture on the pizza I sprinkled the top with about 1 ounce of crumbled blue cheese before putting the mozzarella cheese on top.  It was awesome....way better than ordering out!!  Thanks!!!

Used this one for a 4th of July Celebration at the marina where all the boat owners get together and celebrate. It was perfect for such a large group and went over well with everyone. Not a crumb was left. Bravo!  Thanks!

This was awesome!  I used Perdue pre-cooked chicken strips instead of cooking my own chicken.  I spread the blue cheese dressing lightly on the crust (garlic flavored crust) instead of using the whole bottle, then after putting the chicken on there I sprinkled 8 oz. of crumbled blue cheese on there and then topped it off with the mozzerella cheese.  Very yummy!

I made this with Jays Signature pizza crust from this sight. I liked the taste, but I think there was way too much bleu cheese, and it made the crust soggy. I'll make it again, but definetely put less dressing on it.

This recipe was great! I threw 2 chicken breast in the crock pot for 5-6 hours with a jar of buffalo wing sauce. About halfway through, I broke up the chicken. I also used about 1/2 bottle of blue cheese dressing.

This was wonderful!  I made it twice in the same week! Following other suggestions, I used ranch instead of blue cheese and I used a blend of monary jack, cheddar and mozzarella cheese.  I also cooked the chicken with a bit of salt and papper and then marinated it for about 20 minutes.  The leftovers were even good!

My husband LOVES this recipe. He usually ordered buffalo pizza from the local pizza shop, but now he prefers this. I didn't use quite as much dressing and I used ranch instead of the blue cheese. I added extra hot sauce and it turned out excellent. Thanks!

This is one of our favorite pizzas.  We use ranch instead of blue cheese, but I don't mess with the recipe otherwise--it's a nice, easy weeknight dinner.

I thought this was quite good except it has too much dressing on for my taste.  I think that a little more than half would be better.  Only one of my four children liked it, but my husband and I liked it.

Awesome Recipe!!!! I never have been able to make a descent pizza from scratch at home until I ran across this recipe. I used Ranch instead of Blue Cheese. My company went nuts and my 8 year old nephew ate slice after slice. I didn't make enough as it was all gobbled up in 5 minutes. Thanks for the recipe...will make over and over again...no more take out.

Great recipe Made one with Ranch and one with blue cheese.  My kids ate almost all of the ranch pizza.  My husband and I loved the blue cheese. A keeper for sure, will make again, and again!

This pizza is so easy and tastes delicious. Would be good with ranch dressing if you don't like blue cheese.

Delicious!  I didn't have any prepared pizza crust on hand, so I used those 'Flatout' breads you buy pre-packaged in the deli section.  Worked out excellent!  Definately will make again.

DELICIOUS! And I even changed things up quite a bit - I made a vegetarian version using Morning Star's veggie chicken nuggets, lowfat blue cheese dressing, and reduced fat cheese. It turned out really well for all those changes. Great one!

My husband is a fan of buffalo wings,blue cheese and pizza.He wanted to  make this pizza so, I agreed with him to make the pizza.I really can not stomach hot foods as it gives me heartburn,so I did some altercations to the recipie.I omitted the blue cheese for ranch dressing on the side and based the pizza dough with some of the hot sauce mixture.I had used sharp cheddar and mozzarella.I wasn't too crazy for the pizza but my husband loves it and took it in to work with him.

Easy and Yummy!!  I also used the blue chees recipe from this site.  Added some sliced red onions and next time may add more veggies for texture.  Used the Boboli crust (big time saver).  Boyfriend said this was the 1st home made pizza he ate that didn't tast home made! Check out our picture!

I agree its a lot of blue cheese dressing. I followed the recipe then the next day I scraped all the stuff off the pizza and served it warm over shredded lettuce. It was excellent. Took it to work and the girls loved it. I wont even bother with the crust next time.

My girlfriend and I made this with ranch dressing (and not NEARLY a whole bottle, just enough to have a layer like you would do with pizza sauce on a regular pizza).  We also used a rollout pizza crust from a cardboard tube like you would find in the refrigerated case at your grocery.  It was DELICIOUS although the thin crust combined with the juices made it a tad soggy.  A thicker crust might make up for that.  We will definitely be using this recipe again!

The pizza tasted great. I wouldn't use more than half the blue cheese the recipe calls for, though. Will definitely make again. Cooked great on my Pizzazz pizza maker.

I really enjoyed this.  I thought there would be too much chicken, but it wasn't.  Next time I too will use a little less blue cheese, but otheres thought it was just right as it was.

I love hot wings, this isn't all that hot. The taste is alright overall, but become too much. Maybe less chesse on top and more hot sauce. I'd recommend it as a snack and make several other pizzas. We only used 8 oz of blue cheese and that seems more than plenty.

This recipe was amazing to some and not so amazing to others. Personally I don't like ranch or blue cheese dressing so I didn't find it all too great. However my dad and boyfriend gobbled it up. My brother thought it was too spicy and one of my friends bit into it thinking it was regular pizza. Let's just say that ruined the experience for him. I think I will end up making it again because it did get really good reviews from the buffalo wings lovers.

Excellent. I used bottled Hidden Valley Ranch and it was so good and easy. I could not find any kind of 16 in. crust in the store, so I used Betty Crocker crust mix in a pouch. I pre baked the crust for 5 mins at 450 then added the toppings and baked for another 8-10 mins until it was golden brown. I used far less ranch. I think the dressing must be a typo. Will definatley make it again.

Delicious! This one is a keeper. I didn't have blue cheese dressing so I used a little ranch combined as well as some of the hot sauce/butter mixture for added zing. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Great pizza!  Next time I will use a thicker crust, I used a real thin crust and lots of chicken, so it was really messy.  Didn't use the whole bottle of dressing either.  Anyway, the taste was fabulous, and it was gone immediatley!  Thanks!

Excellent. I have had this saved in my recipe book for maybe a year and just made it last night. My BF loved it and so did I. I used ranch instead of blue cheese, and like everyone suggested I cut the dressing in half and it was plenty. I used the Pillsbury pizza crust in the refridgerated can and it was great. As for the hot sauce, I used Frank's Red Hot Buffalo Wing sauce. When I opened the oven and saw how great this looked I couldn't wait to serve it.

I made this for my teenage sons for lunch today. I sprinkled cayenne pepper generously over the crust, then messed up by putting the chicken mixture on, then the salad dressing and then the cheese. It didn't seem to matter too much, although next time I will place the salad dressing directly on the crust so it can seep in a bit. The kids loved this and told me that it wasn't spicy at all. We will make this again. Thanks for sharing!

I used the pre-made chicken strips in the deli section.  I also got dough from the Italian deli (.82 cents!!).  I baked the dough for 20 minutes at 350 first to be sure of crispness.  And I added thibly sliced red onion under the cheese.  It was so good.

It's different, and it's good.  I used far less blue cheese, chicken, and hot sauce to make a smaller pizza on a homemade crust.  Something different for once.

I was very pleased with this pizza.  I lightly sauteed some onions, garlic & red pepper while the chicken marinated in Texas Pete's Hot Wing Sauce.  I threw in some jarred mushrooms.  Perfectly filling.

This pizza is fun, good and easy. I like to use a less chunky blue cheese, and lots of hot sauce- I suggest Franks Red Hot. It has great flavor without immense hotness.

Mmmm, this is good! I used Tiseo's Frozen Pizza Dough - freezer section at Meijer - which not only rose up beautifully, but was very light and delicious too. I topped the crust with a generous layer of T Marzetti's Chunky Blue Cheese Dressing, and used a 10oz can of chicken breast meat. I cut back on the hot sauce because I didn't want it to be too spicy. This was a really nice change from the regular tomato sauce-based pizzas. Thanks so much, Brown!

I use "Maria's Super Blue Cheese" since it's more creamy and not chunky, seemed more appropriate for the sauce. I didn't use the whole bottle either. I just lightly coated the dough (although my bf still dipped the pizza in the blue cheese). "Frank's Red Hot" sauce is the best sauce, but I also add a little bit of BBQ sauce to thicken it up. It's about 1 part BBQ to 3 or 4 parts Hot sauce (my personal taste). If you want a "healthier" pizza, you can try what I did which was mix the blue cheese dressing with "Campbell's Cream of...whatever soup". Takes away from the blue cheese and adds some veggies. I also toss on cut up carrots and/or peppers to intermix with the chicken.

This was so good.    I cubed the chicken before I sauteed it in a little olive oil and threw a bit of salt & pepper on the chicken.  It only took a few minutes to cook.   I used Red Hot Sauce because it adds flavor, not just heat, and about 1/2 a bottle of Blue Cheese dressing (that turned out to be WAY too much!)   Next time I'll try 1/4 bottle or so of Ranch.   Leftover's tasted better than the first time around!

The first time I made this I used the whole 16 oz of dressing and it was way too much. The second time I used just enough to thinly cover the crust and it was excellent. I will make this again for sure!! Thanks Brown!

I've made this pizza several times now and my boyfriend and I love this! The first time I made it, I followed the recipe to a tee, and found that using an entire 16 oz. bottle of dressing was entirely too much! Now I use just enough to cover the surface of the crust. After the dressing, I take some slices of provolone or mozzarella cheese and layer the crust to absorb some of the juices that will seep through while baking. Yummy! We both love mushrooms, so I generally sautee some mushrooms and toss them with the chicken before loading it up with some shredded cheese! It's also a crowd pleaser and would be a great addition to those upcoming Super Bowl parties! The great thing about this pizza is that you can tailor this recipe to your liking and add/delete some of the ingredients listed. But, make sure you like buffalo wings first!  Thanks for the recipe, Brown!

Yummy!  I saute'd the cut up breast meat (1/2 a breast was plenty) in olive oil, topped with a packet of Buffalo Dipping Sauce from Mickey-D's, and let it simmer while preparing the other ingredients.  I used just enough buttermilk ranch to sauce a Boboli crust.    We topped it with bacon and onion (& 1/2 green pepper), too!  Excellent!

I followed the advice of others and used only enough dressing to coat the crust.  I topped the pizza with chicken marinated in buffalo wing sauce, slices of onion, and strips of red peppers.  It turned out great and tasted even better reheated the next day.

I listened to what some of the other reviewers said, and I only used enough blue cheese dressing to cover the crust.  Be very careful how much hot sauce you add--I would recommend tasting your chicken after every addition.  Also, there are some great recipes for homemade pizza dough on this site, so don't feel that you HAVE to buy a ready-made crust.  

All in all, I thought this was a great recipe and I definitely will be making it again!

This was fantastic although I made some changes.  I made my own pizza crust and cooked it in advance. Instead of one 16 bottle of dressing, I used one 8 oz bottle. I boiled and shredded the chicken and mixed it with a few tablespoons of hot WING sauce, and omitted the butter.  I also used two parts mozzarella and one part sharp cheddar.  I will definitely be making this again. TFS.

This recipe was so easy and Deee-licious!  My husband loved it.  He said it's the best of both worlds, pizza and buffalo wings.  I used a thin crust Boboli.  I also only used about half the bottle of Blue Cheese dressing as other reviewers had suggested.  Instead of the hot sauce I sustituded Texas Pete's wing sauce.  I baked it for 10 minutes and then flipped the broiler on for a minute or so to brown the crust and the cheese a little bit more.  It was perfect!

I made this with thin crust boboli, one with ranch dsg and one with blue cheese dsg, and it came out just as expected.  I really enjoyed it however my fiance didn't care for it at all.  He is a firm believer that pizza should be made with red sauce.

This was pretty good, although like others have said i prolly only used about 1/3 of the blue cheese. Next time i would leave out the blue cheese entirely and add more mozzerella like a regular pizza, and provide blue cheese on its own as a dipping sauce. If you do use the blue cheese, get low fat, you can not tell a difference in taste.

I used frozen cubed chicken and Texas Pete buffalo sauce.  Hubby was a little skeptical, but we ended up loving it!  Next time, we are going to buy breaded chicken strips to cut up and add a little wing sauce to the blue cheese.

This was great! I also used ranch dressing instead of blue cheese dressing. I brushed the crust with olive oil and didn't use any butter. I also added the hot sauce to the chicken in the pan as it finished cooking. The longer you let the hot sauce simmer the hotter it will be. My husband, parents and myself all liked this recipe. It was a lot better then our typical pepperoni. Thanks!

This was great! I tweeked the recipe going on the advise of those before me...used only 1/2 bottle of ranch dressing, tossed meat(I used 5 thighs) in wing sauce, brushed the bottom(that touches the pan)of my pizza crust with melted butter, topped with cheese, added chopped green onion and viola! The best pizza my husband or I have ever had!!

Loved this pizza!  It was quick and easy.  I used about 1/2 the dressing listed and it was plenty.  I will definately make this again.

Very good- if you make the proper modifications. I used a thin coating of ranch dressing and no butter. I cooked boneless chicken thighs and shredded the meat with a fork and tossed with hot sauce. I added scallions and mozzarella cheese. Everyone loved it and wanted to know what that extra little flavor was (it was the ranch dressing).

I am sorry to say we thought this was absolutely awful. My husband and I love buffalo wings, and I was skeptical at first because the thought of that in a pizza sounded so strange. But all of the fabulous reviews persuaded me to give it a shot. Yuck!

Good and simple recipe.  I used ranch instead of blue cheese.  1/2 bottle is plenty.  I sauteed the chicken in butter/olive oil instead of boiling the chicken.  Will make again and will try the crispy chicken tenders(cut up) next time.  Definitely will use over and over.

Suprisingly good,  I used way less dressing and mixed some hot sauce with the dressing when I spread it on the pizza.  It was not wings, and not Pizza, but very good as its own unique dish.

The husband loves this. We like ranch dressing better than blue cheese, and use Frank's Red Hot chicken wing sauce.  We use Boboli pizza crusts.  Go easy with the sauce on the dough, and reserve it for dipping, or the pizza can get soggy.  Good use for left over chicken.

I used 1/2 a bottle of Ranch (8oz) and instead of bottled hot sauce I let the shredded chicken sit in "Hooters 3-mile island"hot wing sauce for about an hour, draining off unused portion. If you like it hot, you will love this sauce!!!!!

This was great for something different.  I used ranch instead of bleu cheese dressing, and only half the bottle.  I also used only half the cheese too, and it was still very filling.  I'd definately make it again, my boyfriend and I both really enjoyed it!

Very good! I neglected to print out the recipe, so I had to 'wing it' (he he). Luckily, you can't mess it up. Used rotisserie chicken and much less dressing. Going to eat my leftovers right now....

I made a low fat version with boboli thin crust pizza.  I used lite bleu cheese and not very much butter or cheese.  It was okay but way too much chix and way too much bleu cheese.  cut in half at least.  I will use a hotter hot sauce next time- maybe a buffalo wing sauce like others suggested.

I wanted to give this 2 stars, but I'll be generous with 3 b/c I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I made my own low-carb crust that I usually use for pizza. I forgot to mix the hot sauce with the chicken, so I drizzled it on top. Made one with Ranch and one with Blue Cheese. Liked the Blue Cheese better, but neither pizza was very good. It gave my husband a terrible stomach ache, so I will not be making this again.

This recipe is pretty good.  I would recommend using only part of a jar of blue cheese dressing.  It is very sloppy and fattening otherwise.  You won't loose the flavor profile by only using what you need and putting extra in ramekins for dipping.

This was an good pizza  but would be better as an appetizer for a casual get together.  The Mozz cheese is WAY too much.  I would use only 4oz rather than 8oz.  It helps to sprinkle some crumbled blue cheese over the top.  I used a Boboli pizza crust and felt it was not the best to go with the pizza.  I would use a crust that was thinner.  I also chopped the chicken by using my Pampered Chef Chopper and I felt that worked really well.  I also bought chicken wing sauce rather than hot sauce and thought that made it the "right" level of spciy.

YUMMY!  I didn't read the reviews before, but still cut back on the dressing (I used ranch rather than bleu cheese), but next time I'll cut back a bit more.  Plus, I'll use a bit more hot sauce since we like things spicy.  It was wonderful - my husband said the best pizza he's ever eaten.  I don't know if I would go that far, but this will definitely be added to the rotation on my menu!

Definately for the Blue Cheese lover!!  Too overpowering for my family, but love this idea.  Will try again, but will prepare a "hot sauce" and drizzle the blue cheese over the top.

I'll add to these comments with another raving review.  Make sure you have good wing sauce; I bought a cheaper version once(shame on me), and it just didn't turn out well.  This pizza is especially good with Bill's Blue Cheese Dressing, also from this site.  I don't like bottled blue cheese dressing, and Bill's is a wonderful addition to this recipe.

This rocked our world!  We used a thin Boboli crust and baked the pizza on a pizza stone. Mixed the blue cheese dressing with ranch.  Used just enough dressing to cover the crust.  I shredded the chicken breasts.  Superb!

This recipe is fantastic.  Definitely a keeper!  Just like the rest of the reviews, I only put about a quarter of the dressing on the pizza.
Baked for about 15 minutes, and it came out perfectly.  Will make again soon.

I was very skeptical about this recipe, because it is such a different style of pizza. With the amount of great reviews it had, curiosity got the best of me. I'm glad it did. Talk about easy to do! I used ranch dressing instead. It was a hit at my household. This recipe is a keeper & is going into my recipe box for good. Thanks!

This is just a fabulous dish!  My husband and I just love it.  We do use ranch dressing instead of bleu cheese and we also only use about 1/4 or 1/3 of a bottle.  Also we make our own pizza crust and though I didn't think it were possible, it makes it even better.  We like a lot of chicken, so the three breasts worked good for us.  We just cut them in VERY small pieces.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a very good recipe, but RICH!  Followed the advice of the others, and reduced the amount of blue cheese dressing.  I used ranch on half of the pizza for my husband, but he enjoyed the blue cheese as well.

Made this pizza for a small New Year's party and everyone raved about it.  Only alterations I made were I used 1 large chicken breast and there was still almost too much meat.  Also cut back on the bleu cheese dressing.  I just used enough to generously coat the top of the crust which was only about 1/4 of a 16 oz bottle.  This pizza will definitely become a dinner regular. So easy to make and delicious.

My wife went nuts over this and I liked it too. It pays to read the comments, though...the recipe calls for WAYYYY too much blue cheese. About a quarter of a jar of Marie's was plenty. Also, I think that you could do without the butter...with low-fat blue cheese, reduced fat mozzerella, and not butter, this'd actually be pretty good for you.

My husband loved it!  Will make again  again.  Used the thin crust pizza, less hot sauce and much less blue cheese dressing.  Just covered the crust like regular sauce.  Very good!

I made this for my husband and he loved it!!  I cut the prep time by using Purdue Shortcut Carved Chicken. Just like other reviewers, I used less Blue Cheese and only 1 tablespoon butter.  I will make this for my husband again -- it was soooooo easy.

I used light blue cheese dressing, and only used enough to cover the crust and not the entire bottle.  This is an excellent pizza, however there will be leftovers because it's very filling!

My husband went crazy for this! I just eyeballed the amount of dressing which was about a cup or so and it turned out great. I've had to make this several times since then. Thanks for the wonderful idea.

We loved this recipe. I wouldn't use all the wing sauce on top of the blue cheese dressing. I made 2 pizzas. One with a little extra chicken "wing" sauce added to the pie with the chicken & one pizza with less "wing" sauce. We preferred the one with less sauce. Will definately make again

Easy and delicious!  I added chopped celery before baking and it was a nice touch.  Also, I used less blue cheese dressing and slightly less hot sauce.  My husband and I really enjoyed this pizza!

This a great recipe, I just changed a few things. I use just enough dressing to cover the crust well, and I use a mild  buffalo wing sauce instead of hot sauce, and then not the whole bottle, just enough where it is wet but not dripping. I also make a basil pizza crust from scratch, it takes about 10 mins. and tastes better than store bought. Great recipe, make it all the time!

The taste was definitely different and the pizza looked really nice, but it was way too hot to eat and the crust was soggy.  I won't make this again, but it was interesting to try.  We threw the rest in the garbage because it was so hot.

This was great.  Now when the kids want pizza, I don't cringe--I just make half of it their way (the regular sauce and cheese only), and half of it this adult pleasing way.

teenagers love it!  added chopped celery to complete the buffalo wings theme.  way too spicy and fattening for anyone worried about their weight or cholesterol, but I think the flavors work very well together.  good sunday afternoon football dish.

We used Boboli crust and covered w/Ranch dressing instead of Bleu Cheese.  Added a little bit of cheddar cheese w/mozzarella and a sprinkling of red pepper flakes (although we didn't need!).  Everyone loved it!!!  Great flavor but pretty hot for people who like 'mild hot'.

Very yummy!!  I modified the recipe by using buffalo wing sauce instead of blue cheese dressing, I like a little kick.  I served the blue cheese dressing on the side with celery sticks instead.  I will definitely be making this again!

This was a great recipe.  I was skeptical of how it was going to taste but it was awesome.  We didn't use all of the dressing recommended and probably would use even less than we did because it seemed like it was a bit to much.  My husband and I both enjoyed it, it was easy and quick to make and it was relatively inexpensive.

If you like chicken wings you'll like this.  I took the advice of other reviewers and used just over 1/2 bottle of blue cheese.

This was very good.  I used the ranch but my husband said to use blue cheese next time.  I made a pizza dough from scratch and it came out fine.  My boys loved this too.  They get their fix of Buffalo wings in a healthy way.  Thank you!

I'm not a chef, although I try - this was very easy. A matter of fact my 10 year old son helped out. We loved it! Thank you!

My husband teenage girl loved this pizza!  I used about 1/4 bottle of ranch dressing instead.  Turned out great.  Great for leftover chicken breasts.  Thanks!

Very good recipe! Extremely easy and quick. The combination of the mozzerella and blue cheese  with the kick of the wings made a very interesting and surprisingly pleasing taste. This is good when you're tired of the same old pizza. Even my ultra-picky boyfriend liked it!

This pizza has a very, very strong flavor so kids probably won't like it.  A whole 16oz bottle of dressing is way too much.  I used less than half.  I also substituted canned chunk white chicken because I'm lazy and otherwise it would have taken way too long.  In the end, I loved it, but my husband didn't like it at all.
