Fantastic!!  The ONLY complaint I have is that the cook time is way off.  I used THICK pork chops and set the timer to check them at 30 minutes- they were already at 170!!  They would have been absolutely dead at 60 minutes, they were overdone as it was.  That being said, the sauce and cook method are awesome and we'll definitely be making this one again.

Made these for Recipe Group. I decided to dredge the pork chops in flour first and cooked them in some vegetable oil. After reading another review, I just used 1 cup of beef broth, which was plenty, and I left the seasonings the same. I didn't take a picture of these because they didn't look so pretty; my sour cream separated a bit in the sauce. They tasted great though, and I served them along side a baked potato. The sauce was nice on the potato. I used Creole Seasoning from this site for the Cajun, and it gave it a nice kick. I didn't have savory, so I used thyme.

It was scrumptious!!!
I did make changed because I didn't have two of the seasonings. They were Cajun Seasoning & Dried Savory.  I added 1 tsp. Chili Pwdr. &1/8 tsp. of Cayenne Pepper.
I am going to get those other seasonings and try again, but the way I made it was great.

Followed recipe exactly but it wasn't all that the reviews would lead you to believe. Pork chops were virtually tasteless and tough.  Won't be repeating this.

great idea for the sauce i made this as directed it turned out fine but i now make the following changes i simply add garlic and mushrooms and onions to the beef broth and cook until tender i use basic chili powder instead of the listed spices roughly a teaspoon but i do it to taste i mix a fork full of cornstarch with about two table spoons water and add that slurry to the sauce after adding and simmering in the sour cream and stirring in the mustard made a nice gravy great sauce thanks again for the recipe very quick and easy and a great way to cook pork chops or as i do much more often pork steaks

This was not great. Following some of the suggestions in the reviews, I reduced the cooking time to 30 minutes, but the chops were so dry my husband quit eating and made himself a bowl of soup instead. The sauce was flavorful but too thin. I was pretty disappointed in the outcome.

Pork chops were tender and the "gravy" added a nice sauce to the chops and the rice that I served with it.

I made this tonight with a few changes. I didn't have Vidalia onions as they are not available yet in our local stores, so I used yellow onions and also used Dijon mustard as a preference to yellow mustard. The end result was delicious, the pork chops so tender and lots of flavour.

Recipe Group Selection:  16, May 2015 ~ I halved the recipe and used thin pork chops as that is what I had on hand.  The flavor is very good, but I would have liked the gravy to be a little thicker.  A little flour/water mix would be an easy fix for a thicker gravy.  I used 'Cajun Spice Mix' from AR for the seasoning.  We loved the taste of the VidaliaÂ®
 onions cooked with the pork and broth.  Served this over egg noodles cooked in beef broth and fresh fruit.  I would make pork chops this way again.

Recipe Group: Very good sauce! I would say sauce, it's not quite thick enough to be a gravy, but super yummy for all that. I overdid my pork a bit, didn't time it but just waited until the onions were cooked through and then added the sour cream. Next time I might saute the onions a bit before pouring on the sauce, because I love Vidalias with a lil caramelized action. Thanks for the recipe, sirrahmichelle!

Solid recipe. Easy enough. The sauce has nice flavor, but I might stuff some garlic in the pork for a little more kick. I also agree that the listed cooktime is way too long -- we used 1 inch thick chops and we only needed to cook them for about 20-25 minutes -- as it was, there was no pink in them, so I would cut it back a little further next time.
