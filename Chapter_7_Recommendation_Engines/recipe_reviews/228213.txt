I used one large mango cut into 1" chunks and about 10" of a hothouse English cuke, peeled and cut in half lengthwise and then into 1/2 " slices.  Doubled the vinaigrette ingredients (except for sesame seeds) and added just a drizzle of dark sesame seed oil.  Really good and refreshing alongside some oven fried talapia and rice.

This was a delicious and easy salad.  The only change I made was to use black sesame seeds and the contrast between the seeds,  cucumbers and mangos made a beautiful presentation!  I didn't think that it would be enough vinegar, but it was plenty.   If your mangos are ripe, it makes it's own sauce with the little bit of vinegar and agave nectar that the recipe calls for.  I plan to make it again tomorrow to bring to a salad luncheon.
