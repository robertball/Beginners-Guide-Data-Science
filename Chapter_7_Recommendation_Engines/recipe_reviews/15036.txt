My family and I loved this!  I scaled it down to serve 4 - 6 people and made a couple of minor changes.  Here goes...1/2 pound of spaghetti; 1 can soup; 2 Cups cheese; 2 Cups chicken breast; 1 Cup Broth;  8 oz of sliced mushrooms and 1/4 chopped onion and a pinch of crushed garlic that I sauted in a bit of the broth before adding to the mix.  I put 1/2 cup of the cheese on top before baking for 22 minutes.  Came out perfect!  Thanks so much for this recipe!

Now, this is the way Chicken Tetrazinni/Spaghetti is supposed to taste!!  And it uses so little salt.  The 1 major change I made was the type of chicken used.  My family likes white & dark meat, so I boiled/simmered for 2 1/2 hrs. a 6 lb. chicken hen in a broth of water, lots of chopped cel., onion, bell pepp., garl., bl. pepp., and poultry seas. (more trouble but worth it) After removing fat, skin, bones & veggies from the broth, I proceeded w/the rest of the recipe exactly as it was (I also cooked the spag. in the same broth).  Thanks for a recipe I'll use for a long time!

Fixed this for the first time.  Made some adjustments since many reviewers said it was a little bland. Halved the recipe.  I used one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of celery.  I sauteed chopped celery, red onion, chopped garlic, and the mushrooms.  Simmered this in some sherry.  Used cooked chicken thigh since it's a little tastier than chicken breast.  Added a dab of brown mustard and a splash of Worchestshire to the soup mixture.  Used whole wheat spaghetti to add some grain to the recipe.  Also, covered with crushed cracker and drizzed butter as recommended by reviewers for the last 10 minutes.  Yum ... this was delicious!!  Thanks for the recipe Lois!

I doubled this recipe for 30 people, wanted some leftovers, well.....  Everyone went back for seconds & some went back for thirds!!  I did add onion which I cooked with the mushrooms & a small amount of chicken broth & used one can of cream of chicken soup, per batch.  Also, put some toasted sliced almonds on the top along with the cheese.  Added a nice crunch. Everyone raved about this & it was so easy to make ahead of time.  It took about an hour to cook after it was in the frig overnight. I did cover it with foil for the first 1/2 hour & didn't put the cheese & almonds on until the last 15 minutes.  I will make this over & over.

This is very tasty. I used linguini noodles instead and added some chopped green and red bell peppers. I'll probally add onions next time. I think it lacks a spice but I'm not sure what.  Either way, yummy! The family appreciated the change!

This is a great recipe.  I put all the cheese in with the soup and then for the top I crush a roll of ritz crackers and cover the top and drizzle with a 1/4 cup of melted butter.  Makes a yummy topping.  Thanks for a great dinner!

Had no pimentos so I sauted onions, 2 cloves of minced garlic, and the mushrooms.  Used one can of cream of chicken and two of mushroom.......the crowd goes wild!!!! Made it for a late buffet at a wedding and it was a hit. Thanks for the great recipe. **update - I've made this recipe a lot since my original review and it's still as popular with everyone I make it for. I think the addition of the onions and garlic with the mushrooms makes a big difference in the flavour dept. I've even made it using only 1 can of cream of mushroom and doing a flour and butter roux when saut√©ing the mushrooms and using chicken stock/cooking water for the liquid needed (more heart/renal patient healthy).

Awesome. I boiled chicken breast in chicken stock while preparing the pasta. I modified a little - I sauteed the mushrooms with chopped onions and a little minced garlic until carmelized.  This dish is very good even the next day. Great crowd pleaser.

This was a very quick, easy, and delicious recipe. I made it for my son's school potluck dinner.  Everyone seemed to enjoy it, including us.  It's even better the next day!  I used 2 cans mushroom soup, 1 can cream of chicken soup, and added minced onion and garlic to give the casserole more flavor.

Yum!  This is a great recipe!  I made a few revisions suggested by other cooks:

1) Used two cans of cream of mushrrom soup and one can of cream of celery soup
2) Used all of the cheese in the casserole and topped the casserole with a sleeve of crushed Ritz crackers drizzled with a 1/4 cup of melted butter
3) Sauteed fresh mushrooms with white onion and fresh garlic
4) Used chicken broth instead of stock from the poached chicken breast

This was excellent and I will make it again and again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I took a bite of it when it came out of the oven, and was sorely disappointed.  So when my husband came home, I gave it to him and made myself something else to eat. :) But I was still hungry so I ate off of his plate, and I found that the longer the tetrazzini sat, the better.  Well, you guessed it, the next day this stuff was delicious.  And there was so much of it, the day after that, my husband and I gobbled it up! It's like wine; the more you age it, the better it is (until it turns green).

Great recipe! I cut it in about thirds for my small family--used abt. 1/2 lb. spaghetti, 1 can soup, 1 cup broth, 2 cups cheese, 2 cups chicken and 2 (4 oz.) cans mushrooms instead of fresh, as well as a red banana pepper from my garden instead of pimento for color.  I put 1/2 cup cheese in the sauce and the rest on top.  I baked it only about 20-25 minutes and I, too, sprinkled canned onion rings on top during the last 5 minutes of baking.  It was perfect and very tasty.  My husband even wanted to know if it was easy enough to make when he goes camping with his scouts.  With the convenience foods, it certainly is!  I know fresh sauteed mushrooms would make it taste even better, so next time I may take the time to do that.  Oh, by the way, I put it in 10-inch square casserole dish, and the cuts in the recipe made enough to feed about 4-6.  Thanks for a delicious recipe!

I made almost as is except to lighten up a bit, used reduced fat cream of mushroom soup and 2% cheddar cheese instead.  I also added diced red and yellow pepper only because I had leftover on hand and a little onion powder, garlic salt and crushed red pepper flakes for extra flavor.  This recipe turned out great (even with the reduced fat ingredients), thanks for sharing.

Thank goodness!  A recipe everyone (gourmet husband, mushroom hating son, and goodie hooked daughter) liked!  I didn't have pimentos, so used roasted red pepper (wow!), and used a can of cream of chicken and a can of cream of mushroom with 3/4 of a recipe.  Worked beautifully.

My kids really enjoyed this dinner and it was really easy to make. I used leftover rotisserie chicken meat and it was simple to shred and was really juicy. I skipped the mushroons and the pimento because my kids are picky. They really liked it just plain. One suggestion is to lightly cover with foil about 15 minutes into the baking. The cheese topping became a little too crispy. I'll add this to my file- Thanks!

Wonderful recipe!!!! I made it for a crowd, and adjusted the recipe a little. I bought "98% fat-free" soups by accident, and I was concerned about flavor. So, I used the three soups, but added 8 oz. of sour cream to help compensate. Also, I sauteed the mushrooms in 1/2 tsp. minced garlic and 2 Tbsp. of dried parsley. As mushrooms make their own juice while cooking, I poured all of the liquid into the mix, rather than draining it; that helped preserve the flavor. I chose not to drain the pimiento, and it also added flavor. I used 8 cups instead of 6 cups cooked chicken, and used an extra 1/2 pound of linguini noodles. Finally, I added mozzarella to the cheddar sprinkled on top before baking. The dinner got rave reviews!!!

I made this for Christmas and MOther's day.  It was a major hit at both events!!!  You can't go wrong and the kids love it.  Everyone always asks for the recipe.  I mix everything together the night before and then add the cheese on top and bake just before company arrives.

This was good but I did make a couple changes.  Instead of cheddar cheese I used grated parmesean (chedder didnt sound very good in this recipe).  I also added frozen peas right before baking.  I do think this dish needs a bit more zing to it but Im not sure how to accomplish that at this point.  I will probably make again, as this is an easy recipe and great for taking in my lunch to work.

This almost got 5 stars which doesn't happen much here.  Too many pots/pans cost it and the original recipe seemed boring so I modified.  I used white wine instead of chicken broth which really added some zing.  I used roasted red peppers and sauteed the mushrooms in garlic and olive oil.  For spice I used the normal amount of salt and pepper but added both red pepper flakes and chili pepper to taste.  Hubby loved the spicy flare.  I put the crackers on top, nice touch, but it dried it out a bit.  I'll use more wine next time.  It was really good.

This recipe is fabulous! I did omit the pimentos and add chopped vidalia onion, minced garlic, a julienne cut carrot and two ribs of chopped celery (I added raw mushrooms to the sauteing veggies).

This recipe was well liked by the family.  I elected to add a couple of dashes of Tabasco Sauce and a shake of Nutmeg to provide a bit more flavour than just the usual type of chicken and pasta dish.  I will certainly make this one again.

I made this recipe for five thinking my husband and I would have leftovers. Two of his friends showed up and inhaled the rest, then asked for the recipe (and these guys don't even cook!) Thanks for a great, easy dinner.

This was just average at best.  I was disappointed in this recipe.  Not near as tasty as I thought it would be.  It was very bland.  It is very similar to a chicken spaghetti recipe I grew up with that has green olives and peppers...I think I'll stick with that one.  Sorry.

This is an excellent base recipe.  I used a rotisseri chicken that I bought on special from Super Walmart for $3.94.  It was already cooked and added a wonderful flavor to the recipe.  I also sauteed diced onions with my mushrooms in butter and garlic.  Instead of standard cream of mushroom soup, I used the cream of mushroom with roasted garlic.  It made 2 casseroles, 1 for a friend and another for our family.  Along with the shredded cheese on top, I also added a small can of Durkees French Fried onions.  Excellent meal.  My whole family loved it, even the 2 year old.  Thanks Lois!

This sound delicious and perfect for me. I can cook up a big batch, divide it into meal-sized portions for my husband and me, and freeze up 6 or so meals I can just pop in the oven. This is my kind of home-cooking:-)

Used this recipe to use up some leftover Thanksgiving turkey.  Adding cream of whatever soup and cheese makes anything tasty, so this was good.  I also added in some asparagus.  Didn't have pimentos so skipped those. Was very good!

This recipe is a regular on our menu now!  I half the recipe for one 9X13 pan and it comes out perfect.  I also add some 2 tsp minced garlic and 2 TBSP sun dried tomato to the mix for extra flavor.  So delicious!

My family has always loved Chicken Tetrazzini/Spaghetti so I wanted to make it but didn't have the Velvetta cheese on hand that is needed in my personal recipe and the stores were already closed. So I chose this recipe and made a couple of changes to adapt this recipe to mine.  I left out the pimiento and instead added 1 can of rotel tomatoes...we like a little kick to ours.  I also added about 1 Tbsp. of worcestershire sauce.  It turned out delicious!

This recipe is 4.5 out of 5 stars... what makes it 5... is substituting penne noodles for the gnocchi and adding sauted mushrooms in garlic butter.  A definite keeper!  I also added parmesan cheese to the mix.

YUM!!!  My picky kids loved it. There were 4 of us and I cut the recipe in hald and still had some leftover for today. I have tried a recipe like this after Thanksgiving too. It's good with leftover turkey.

I made a few changes which made making this very easy.  I halfed the recipe and cooked three chicken breasts in my George Forman grill, then shredded.  I didn't have pimento's and it was still good but definately would ensure I have them the next time.  I also doubled the cheese to ensure that it didn't just taste like soup and was glad I did.  Very good, will make again.

I thought is idish was excellent, but I too, made many modifications.  For starters, I sauteed the mushrooms with a cup of onions, some celery and some garlic tossed in at the last minute.  I used a can of crm of celery and a can of crm of chicken vs. whatever the recipe says, and made up the difference with chicken broth.  I also added a healty shot of cooking sherry before adding the noodles and baking.  A little parmesean on the top doesn't hurt either!

I agree with others who said this was bland, however, because I read the reviews before making it I was prepared to doctor it up.  I tasted it in its pure form and decided to add a little garlic powder and parmesan cheese.  I also sauteed some onion and I put in peas and corn. I left out the mushrooms and pimentos and used cream of chicken soup as I was making this dish for my neighbors children.  I topped it with the french fried onions another reviewer had suggested.  We kept a small dish for ourselves and liked it very much, but with so much cheese and creamy sauce, it would not be a very healthy everyday recipe.  Good nonetheless.

Very good. I have been looking for recipes that are going to be easy for my husband to chew, because he just got all his teeth pulled. He liked this very much. And my 2 year old said mmmmmm... I did make a change, I used Velveeta instead of cheddar. Because cheddar is so salty. I did sprinkle a little bit of the cheddar on top though. I have ideas of extras I could add to this. Fresh green beans, broccoli, whole corn, or shrimp instead or pork in place of chicken. And I don't know why you couldn't use a different pasta other then spaghetti. I didn't have any canned soup, so I just made a rue (butter and flour) and added enough milk to that, equivelent to the three cans listed. Then just added a 4oz can of mushrooms (not drained).

This was okay but not spectacular.  It definitely needs more to make it flavorful like herbs or tabasco.  I put half the cheese in the dish like everyone else and I just didn't think that helped much.  A sprinkle of parmesan cheese helped a little.

Very good, and it does make quite a bit.  Like others, I substituted one can of cream of chicken soup.  I also added a few cups of small broccoli florets, steamed just until tender.  It added a nice color and crunch, and tasted very good with the other ingredients.

Wonderful comfort food.  I modified slightly....We enjoy spicy food so I used Swiss and pepper jack cheese.  I topped it with Panko crumbs drizzled with butter.  Very good.  Husband loved it even as leftovers.  Will make again

I thought it was too salty probably due to the condensed soup. After tasting it, I chopped up & microwaved some celery, but that still didn't help enough. I'll make it again, though, as it has potential.

My family rated this about an 85%(according to my father-in-law), just be sure to add more seasoning to give it some flavor. Also I added frozen peas and diced oninon and green/red bellpeppers.

My 3 sons loved this! Used spiral noodles instead. Had just 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup so I added a cup of artichoke dip left over from Thanksgiving. Used leftover turkey instead of chicken. Wonderful! Thanks for the recipe. :)

My family liked this and I liked how flexible it was.  I only had canned mushrooms.  I had no pimentos.  I added chopped onions, pepper, garlic, salt and a  dose of dijon mustard.  I also baked the chicken.  It will be in the family rotation. I've used perdue ready chicken too as a shortcut and it works great.

This was pretty good, but not my favorite.  I made a few changes. I used linguini instead of spaghetti, added a couple splashes of white wine to the soup mixture, used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom (only because my husband prefers it), used a couple splashes of lemon juice in the soup mixture, and added some frozen green peas.  I thought it was a bit bland, but ok.  If I make it again, I will add more cheese for a more rich flavor.

The recipe called for pementos, I didn't use those or a whole can of chicken broth. But I did add more chesse and used egg noodles instead. My family ABSOLUTELY LOVED it. I gave the recipe a four because I didn't use all the ingredients as they were called for. But, this recipe is easy, fast and taste great!

I thought this was very east to make (even though there were a lot of dishes to wash!). Since my husband doesn't like mushrooms, I substituted a can of diced tomatoes and also added some Italian spices. I also put the ritz crackers on top like others suggested.

Wish I could give this one 10 stars!  It is very delicious.  The only change I made was to omit the pimento (I didn't have any.) and add a small can of sliced mushrooms.  We even had plenty to eat some the next day!

Excellent recipe.  Added slightly more cheese just to use up what was on hand.  No leftovers and requests to make it on a regular basis.  Also, I thought it was extremely easy to prepare.

easy recipe for quick potluck dish. a good shortcut is to buy a store-bought roasted whole chicken and just shred that. i also added some corn and peas for a little more flavour.

This was a good easy recipe. I omited the mushrooms and the pimento peppers, and it came out great. I will make this again for sure. A great easy meal idea for those hectic nights.

I make this one often.  You can alter this many ways to your taste.  I skip the mushrooms and pimento peppers, add onion powder, add a little milk sometimes depending on how many noodles I use, varies every time.  I put frozen broccoli in and that was great, can put it in frozen.  Fresh is great too if you have, be sure to steam first though.  And the kids love it.  Thanks Lois for a staple recipe in our house.

My family loved this and gave it 5 stars. Like another person suggested, I added onions and green pepper, chopped finely, and also topped it off with a light coating of cheddar french-fried onions. Delicious!

When I first made this, my boyfriend and I thought it to be "good". But, believe it or not, the reheated leftovers were A-W-E-S-O-M-E!(and this made ALOT for 2 people so there was plenty of leftovers!) I did add a green bell pepper chopped when sauting the mushrooms and onions.  The leftovers are better than the original dish!! I think next time, I'll make this ahead, refrigerate to let the flavors fully blend, and then bake. Thanks!

This is a family favorite!  I added shredded cheddar, mozarella, and a monteray jack cheese blend, along with durkee french fried onions on the top for a crispy twist. I also cut the recipe in half.  We'll be having this over and over for sure!

Made this for a potluck and it went over very well.  Has a nice flavor and the spaghetti and shredded chicken together is perfect.  I used three different "cream of" soups and it worked great.  It makes too much for a 9 X 13 pan, but I put the rest in a casserole for dinner another time.  I will use this recipe often - Thanks!!

This is good, but I am a tough critic and I will continue to look for a better tetrazzini recipe.. This was not the best I've tasted. I even added some half and half to make it richer and it seemed to lack something..

This recipe is fantastic! It made two casseroles. I served one at home and the other at a school luncheon. I used turkey in place of chicken because I cooked a small bird. The dark and white meat were mouth watering. The faculty raved and everyone requested a copy of the recipe which I gladly provided. My family- 5 kids, husband and myself inhaled it. Twenty people couldn't be wrong. I added a tablespoon of dry sherry & grated parmesan on the top with the mozerella.I added this to my active list. Thank you, Lois and allrecipe.com This is a keeper!!

This was terrific! I used cream of celery soup and cream of mushroom and I also diced and sauteed an onion  and mixed in. I froze it into portions for 4 and my husband loved it! Reheats great in the micro for leftovers. I am going to add artichoke hearts the next time as well! It's a definite DO OVER!!

This is a great recipe.  I just made it for a committee meeting and everyone loved it.  The only change I made was instead of 3 cans of mushrooms I subsituted 1 can of cream of chicken and 2 cans of cream mushrooms.  I'm not a mushroom lover and seasoned the broth very well with celery, onion and green onion.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  A couple of my friends have already asked for the recipe.

I took the various feedbacks from reviewers and my own experience from making similar casseroles to make this a great meal.  I used two cans cream of mushroom and one can cream of celery.  I cooked boneless breasts of chicken (about 2 lbs) in boiling water (enough water to cover breasts) for 25 minutes and checked to be sure chicken was cooked through - no pink - then removed chicken from pot and cool slightly (15 mins) and then  took a fork and shredded the chicken).  I browned the mushrooms along with a finely chopped small onion and 3 cloves garlic in a small bit of olive oil (add the garlic last minute of browning so it doesn't get bitter).  I put 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese into hot soup and used the second cup of cheese to top the dish before baking.  I also added about 1/2 cup bread crumbs to the topping  of the casserole before baking for a little extra texture and flavor.  Also added generous amount of salt to pasta water and added salt and pepper to entire mixture for the right amount of seasoning and flavor.  Result was really delicious.  Makes a big amount but easy to split into two casseroles and freeze one for the future.  One other note:  be sure to cook the casserole until nice and hot - for me was more like 40 minutes.

Followed some suggestions of 1 can cream of mushroom soup,  1 can cream of celery,  1 can chicken broth with a little Frank's mixed with Worcestershire sauce.   Cooked over medium.   Mixed in cubed turkey breast, mushrooms and garlic.   Threw frozen peas in the pasta water the last 2 minutes and drained.   Pour in greased pan.  OMG

This was really good, and super cheap to make! I saut√©ed the mushrooms in some butter, then added in the soup and other ingredients to cut down on the dishes I used. Since I thought it looked like there were peas in it in the picture, I added some peas, which was really good. I'll definitely make this again!

This is a great dish for a crowd. It can easily be enough enough for two casserole dishes. We ate one and froze the other. The only thing for my family is that we thought it needed more spice, although some people might prefer it without the extra spice. We added Tony Chacheres, some cayene pepper and green chilies.  If adding Tony Chacheres, less salt is needed, (if any salt)

I really liked this recipe and so did my husband, which was miraculous since he usually doesn't like anything with white meat in it.

I did add some saut√©ed onion (1 small medium yellow onion) to it, and since several reviewers said spice was needed I added about 1 tsp summer savory and dashes of nutmeg and beau monde.  Delish!

Very bland though I used fresh roasted turkey breast meat, fresh mushrooms and followed the recipe carefully adding the full 12 oz. of chicken broth. I was embarrassed that I'd prepared it as my only main dish.

Oh, boy!  Is this good or what?  I left out the pimentos as I didn't have any.  It would have been nice to have the color though.  I scaled it down for 4 people, just used less of the ingredients.  The pimentos would be required if making this for a crowd, as an eye pleaser.  It would be nice to sub cream or milk for the chicken broth.

I have made this recipe as is for years (except that I make 1/3 the serving for my family of 5).  My children LOVE it.  We generously sprinkle lemon pepper on our dish after it's baked.  If you have trouble finding pimentos look in the olive isle in your grocery store.  They come in very small glass containers. It's just not the same without them (I did that once because I forgot to buy them).

I doctored this up quite a bit since that is what I usually do anytime I use condensed soups. They are a little bland for me. (I used 2 mushroom and one cream of chicken.)  I used crimini mushrooms for more intense flavor and sauteed them with onion and garlic. I also added quite a bit of dried basil since I think it needed some kind of spice added to it. Didn't bother with the pimentos since they have very little flavor. 9x 13 seemed too small for this so I stuck it in my lasagna pan.  Not sure how this would feed 20 people. This served 12 women with just a little leftover.  In the end, it had some good flavor and was easy to do.

Very good and very quick!  My extremely picky daughter went back for seconds!  I left out the pimento and used parmesan cheese instead (all we had at the time).  Definitely a keeper!

3.5 This was pretty good, but not a Wow recipe. I did make some modifications: I scaled this recipe down on the website, and used some low fat ingredients for health. I used 1 crm of mushroom and 1 crm of celery. Because I like veggies I added some onion, celery, and bell pepper which I sauteed with garlic. And I couldn't resist adding a bit of sherry as others suggested. I did reserve some of the cheese for the top, and added crushed crackers on top of that - this provided a crust which was the best part of the dish. I will probably make again, but I'll try to snaz it up some.

Everyone loved this.  I used egg noodles since that's all I had at the time.  Also, I didn't use all of the chicken stock recommended.  We'll make this one often!

This was great and pretty easy. Since my husband thinks that spaghetti noodles are only for spaghetti I decided to use rotini noodles instead. It worked great but I still like it better with spag. I also added a little onion and garlic and had no pimentos.

Excellent! I make this recipe at least twice a month! My family loves it and the leftovers are just as good! I've used cr of mush, cr of celery and cr of chicken instead of 3 cans of cr of mush only. EXCELLENT!!

I was looking for a recipe to use leftover chicken. This is very good with a few changes. I used linguini instead of spaghetti, 2 cans cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of chicken. I was worried that the dish would be too bland, so I added sauted onion, garlic, and some hot sauce. Overall a good recipe. I'll make it again.

I liked the addition of the peppers but it could have used a little more kick.  I added some Louisiana Hot Sauce, a can of Rotel would also be a nice add to this favorite of mine.

Great recipe! I changed a couple of things. I baked my seasoned and baked my chicken. I used 1 can of cream of mushroom, 1 can of cream of chicken, 1 jar of pimentos, sauteed mushrooms & onions in butter, cooked broccoli, and 2-8oz packages of cheese (1 to put in mixture & the other for topping)

I actually followed a fellow reviwer's measurements for a reduced yeild on this recipe - and it came out really nice. I opted for fresh mushrooms that I sauted rather than tinned, which gave the dish a bit more depth of flavor. I also added a splash of sherry - overall this is a nice and easy recipe.

Our church has made this twice for Salvation Army Sunday dinners and it was a huge hit both times. The only changes I made were to purchase turkey breasts on sale instead of chicken and to leave out the sauteed mushrooms. We cooked enough for 200 people, served 130 and had no leftovers.It's an excellent choice no matter how big your crowd.

If I made this recipe exactly how it was written, it would only receive three stars.  I tasted the mixture before I poured it into the baking pan and it was very bland, so I started adding spices until it gained flavor (I added seasoned salt, garlic salt, garlic pepper and black pepper).  I omitted the pimento and instead chopped fresh broccoli and added it to the mix.

This recipe uses too many pots - one to boil the chicken, one to boil the pasta, one to saute the mushrooms, one to mix everything together in (which I reused the pasta pot for) and the baking pan - and takes way too long to make considering the end product is not fabulous.  So I will probably not make it again.

This was simple to make and very flavorfull. I used marinated and grilled chicken breast instead of boiled and added some cayenne and hot pepper sauce to spice it up a bit.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good.  I subbed chicken legs quarters for the chicken breast since I bought a bunch on sale and used the 99% fat free cream of mushroom soup.  Though I've been trying to stay away from the canned soups, this was really good.  Thanks for the post.

So tasty!!! I halved the recipe and still made one full casserole!!!
I sauteed my mushrooms with butter, garlic and a half of white onion, and when I mixed everything together I added the other half of the white onion chopped. Very good, will make again for sure with more mushrooms.

made this for a little get-together tonite and it was loved by all - i'll be emailing this recipe to many, by request! i even loved it, and you know you don't always love it if you made it! only changed the recipe a tiny bit: as suggested by other reviewers, i added parmesan on top w/the cheddar, then when it was finished baking, added durkee onion rings and broiled for a sec to get them browned.  and i left out the pimentos.  it took a while to prepare, i thought, but i do have one in the freezer that i'm anxious to try - and all the same friends from tonite want to come over for that one, too!

This recipe was great.  My picky kids didn't eat it, but that's normal.  I loved it.  I did add a crumbly topping however that was a nice accent.  I crushed a sleeve of Ritz crackers into 1/2 stick of melted butter and spread that on the top of this recipe for the last 15 minutes of bake time.  It was something I'll make again in a smaller quantity.  Thanks Lois!

This recipe is really great.  Even my kids who are picky eaters ask for it.  It does make enough for a crowd so I suggest scaling it back, or plan to freeze half for another dinner.  I haven't tried freezing it yet, so I cannot say how that turns out.

Very good. I made this twice: once by the recipe (made a lot) and once as half the recipe. I added french fried onions as someone else suggested and added garlic and minced onions.Very tasty and filling. Will definitely make again.

I wasn't sure what to do with my Thanksgiving turkey leftovers until a friend suggested making tetrazzini.  I found this recipe and made it for some friends.  It was delicious!  Everyone kept saying how yummy it was.  I will definitely be making this again and again!

Enjoyed this recipe.  Easy to make and as the name says feeds a crowd.  I made a full recipe but split between two separate baking dishes.  Bake one for a luncheon for ten, and froze the other for use later.

I used precooked oven-roasted chicken strips/cubes which can be found in the meat department of your grocery.  I also used canned chicken broth.  I substituted two cans of cream of celery soup for two cans of the cream of mushrooms.
When I sauted the mushrooms in butter I added chopped onions and garlic.  As Lois advised, use enough chicken broth (2 cups was enough for my dish) otherwise the pasta might become dry when baking.  I additionally added salt to taste.

In short, easy to make, serves a crowd and taste delicious.  A great change from the usual chicken and rice or chicken and stuffing casserole.   Oh, by the way, everyone seemed to enjoy the recipe and many came back for seconds.

Very good & it does make a lot!  I like the taste of sherry in my tetrazinni, maybe I will try to add that next time.  Definitely needs a little "extra" to kick-it-up-a-notch.  But very simple & basic & will sure please a crowd.

This was extremely bland! I had even added green peppers and garlic to the mushrooms to try and give it some more flavor. My husband and I thought the texture and consistency were good, but it was severely lacking in taste. We threw away the leftovers and I will not make again.

Oh, yes...this is THE recipe. In making an attempt to make a recipe for 2 instead of 30...I was still successful in using this as a base recipe and still was able to put an 8x8 casserole in the freezer.  I mistakenly emptied out the broth, so I used a can of cream of chicken soup with water added, and still needed more, due to the amount of pasta I cooked, so I added a can of chicken noodle soup, with a little water added.  I also used angel hair pasta...our favorite. Of course, I added a little extra cheese and used sweet red peppers, as I didn't have any pimentos.
Still great !  Easy to change to suit your own likes.  Thanks for a great homemade casserole dish!

For Christmas, I was lucky enough to receive a Food Saver, with which I used to store almost half the Christmas turkey.  A month and a day later, I defrosted that same turkey and cut it into cubes to be used in this recipe.  I have tried many tetrazinni recipes in the past, trying to mock The Spaghetti Warehouse's tetrazinni, but this is in itself a great recipe.  It is very versatile (of course using turkey instead of chicken and varying/adding certain vegetables).  Simple, fast and great for making in big quantities then storing for later use.  Will be passing this one on.

I was a little disapointed since it got rave reviews from other cooks. Perhaps I needed to add more than the recommended amount of soup...I don't know, just not a favorite.

I used cream of chicken and mushroom soup instead of just plain mushroom. It was a big hit. My mother couldn't stop raving about it. An inexpensive, great tasting meal for a large group. Will certainly make this again.

I've made this recipe so many times.  It's always turned out well, although I don't add the pimiento peppers, I don't care for them.  It's super easy, feeds a crowd, is delicious and an easy reheat for leftovers, if there are any.  The chicken/turkey can be already cooked, just cut it into bite sized pieces and heat up with the mushrooms.  Enjoy

I made this recipe exactly as it was written ... my family liked it, I thought it was ok. What I didn't like was it was salty from the 3 cans of condensed soups. Next time I will add some onions along with more fresh mushrooms and make my own cream sauce.

This was very bland.  I think it needed onions, salt and pepper, and perhaps a dash of italian seasoning.  Disappointed.  As my husband used to say, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that good but there‚Äôs a lot of it‚Äù!

We make this for people everytime we have a big group come over, or if we can't think of anything to do with some canned chicken. We make this with freshly grown hot peppers instead of pimento peppers, and skip the mushrooms.

Used 1 can of family sized healthy mushroom soup ~26oz & 1 can of chicken broth ~14oz. Measured out 12oz from 1 bag of cheddar and 1 bag of mozzarella cheese. Used 2 lbs of pre-seasoned garlic & herb chicken from Walmart which I cubed and sauteed. Only used 1 8oz package of mushrooms. Diced, sauteed & added 2 medium yellow onions and 2 large sweet red peppers. No additional seasonings were added. Very yummy, will make again :)

I doubled the recipe and added, chili peppers and made the soup base.
Instead of commercial soup, I added 1 cup dry milk, 1/2c. Corn starch, 1 tab. Italian seasoning, 2 tsp salt 2 1/4 cups broth in which the chicken was boiled. Dissolved all in a pan, then followed the recipe.  I did not add cheese to the mix only topped the dish with the cheese.

This recipe is very tasty! I substituted spaghetti squash for the pasta to make it more healthy. For a 13x9 casserole pan I multiplied the recipe by 2/3. Didn't have pimento peppers so I just used green pepper and it was still delicious.

Very bland when made as written. Bonus is it makes A LOT. Second time around I added a couple of tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce and about a teaspoon of seasoned salt to the sauce plus some broccoli florets w the chicken. Much improved.

I halved the recipe, using their portion size calculator. Instead of using 1 1/2 cans of soup, I used 1 can and 1/2 can of milk to thin it out a little. I did not use any chicken broth. I also saut√©ed red pepper with my mushrooms. I used them to replace the pimentos. I think they added a lot of flavor that you don't get with pimentos. This was delicious, my fianc√© went back for seconds and asked me to add it to my recipe box. I disagree with the portion numbers. There is no way that the amount I made would have fed 10 people, I would say 4, maybe 5 at the most. Will be adding this to the rotation, so easy and fast. Love it!

Followed recipe fairly close. Put a couple of different types of shredded cheese. Used cream of celery and cream of mushroom. Saut√©ed minced garlic w mushrooms. Sprinkled kraft parmigiana on top w shredded to help it crust-up a bit. We loved it!

I made it! ?? Except I used leftover turkey in place of chicken. I also left out the pimento but added celery and onion.  It was quite rich but had a great flavor. Next time I'll also cut back on the cheese. Enjoy!

I did not have cream of soup, so I made my own. The problem I had was deciding how much reserved broth to make it "sloppy". I used probably one cup of broth when I needed the second cup. The sauce got absorbed and was a little dry for me.

I cooked the chicken (breast and thigh meat) in chicken broth and added garlic and onion powder, salt, and lemon pepper seasoning. After the chicken was done, I pulled it out and put my whole grain pasta in. I had some really good chicken broth that I'll use later for another recipe. 
I'm not a mushroom fan, so I didn't add the mushrooms, but to the mushroom soup mixture, I stirred in some thawed vegetables (the corn, bean, carrot mix...small pieces), let that cook the veggies a bit, adding broth little by little, then adding in the cooked pasta, and ended up w/that "sloppy" mixture. 
Everyone loved it! Even my picky daughter.  I'm catering a Senior Citz dinner in a few days and making this for 25...hoping for the same results.

Very good but followed the recommended changes.  Cut recipe in half.  Sauted mushrooms, onion and red pepper before adding chicken.  Also added fresh english pea's, garlic powder and a bit of mixed grated italian cheese.  I didn't have any chicken broth so I added white wine and water along with a bit of chicken boulion.   My hubby and I both enjoyed!

Very good!  I used only two cans on soup, one cream of chicken and one cream of celery.  I omitted the mushrooms and used Kraft triple cheddar for the cheese.  Would make again.

Made this for Father's Day for about 10 people. It was a huge hit. Even 99 year old Uncle Gene asked for seconds. Used half cheddar and half shredded parmesan cheese. Added salt and white pepper. Saut√©ed onion in with the mushrooms and added petite frozen peas right before scooping into baking dish. Made a nice presentation with plenty left over.

Super easy!! Use rotisserie chicken to save time!  We did not use all the pasta about 3/4 lb and found it still maybe too much. I skipped the mushrooms and added in mix medley of veggies.  Also used cream of celery soup and cream of mushroom and used a total of 4 cans as I found it too dry with just 3 but probably because I added the veggies. It's also easy to make a day ahead and wait to heat until the next day and great to freeze the leftovers. Delish

This was outstanding!   I couldn't have been more surprised at what an easy and wonderful dish this was, that pleased every single member of my picky family.  I made a few changes specific to our taste (we aren't mushroom lovers) but I'm sure the original instructions are super for those who enjoy them.  I used 1 can of cream of chicken, 1 can of cream of celery, and 1 can of cream of onion (instead of the cream of mushroom soup).  I did not add in any mushrooms and I cut the amount of chicken in half.  We don't need a lot of meat and it's far cheaper that way... I also used condensed chicken broth as opposed to the water I boiled the chicken in.  Fabulous, easy, and an all-time winner in my books!

We loved this! I forgot the pimentos while shopping so I added some peas. I sauteed onions with the mushrooms and added garlic powder, s/p. I halved the recipe and used just one can of mushroom soup. I also used jack and cheddar cheese. No need to dirty another pot to heat up the soup and cheese. Just dump everything in the skillet with the mushrooms and stir it up. We really enjoyed this dish. Served some biscuits on the side.

I decided to try this recipe because my husband, who was in the Army, and overseas for 2 years, said his favorite MRE was chicken tetrazzine. He loved this recipe and said it took him back to those days. I am glad I found this recipe for him. This was so good and were even better when we ate them for leftovers!

This is a very good recipe and the quantity is just right for entertaining a dozen people.  It freezes well too so if you have a lot of turkey, make a lot and just freeze the rest.  I omitted the pimientos and sliced mushrooms as I didn't have any on hand but added broccoli florets.  Easy recipe and you can really add anything you want!

I have made this several times. It's scrumptious! This is great for using left over chicken or turkey. I use red bell pepper instead of pimento. This recipe freezes well.

Easy and tasty. I would season the mushrooms because even though the sauce is there, they were not that flavorful. I omitted the chicken broth and baked as is, great.

We tried to duplicate my mother-in-laws recipe with this one. I was expecting something different. If I had never tasted hers it would be fine. I will try some of the suggestions next time,more cheese perhaps.

This is a great recipe.  Made it for a holiday get together and one of my parents friends, who is a very picky eater, devoured two large helping and kept raving how good it was. Kids from 3 on up ate their fair share too. I made it just as the recipe calls but want to add water chestnuts next time, per my 23 yr olds suggestion.

SO delicious!  I forgot the broth and it still turned out great.  Very creamy and the pimento peppers truly made the dish!  I did add garlic.  Even my (VERY PICKY and I mean very picky) son ate this dish.  Can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow night!

I've tried this recipe but with a few added ingredients... I saute chopped onions and bell peppers in butter and add to the soup and cheese mixture. And to give it that added pop I add a can of original Rotel. If you like it with more spice use the extra hot Rotel. Rotisserie chicken from your local grocery store not only taste good but it cuts down on the prep time...  Yummy!!!

I made this dish in hopes of getting back the flavor of a favorite dish of a family I used to babysit for.  She made this dish often when I had the kids for dinner and I loved it.  This recipe was disappointing, too bland for my taste.

Not sure why it's 'for a crowd', it makes 1[one] 9x13 casserole. It's ok. It needs something & spice. [at least black pepper] .

My family loved this! Like some others suggested, I also sauteed onion, garlic and green pepper with the mushrooms. I also simmered it in sherry and it gave the veg a lovely flavour!
Definitely a make-again!!

This is really easy, and people always eat it up. I use Rotisserie chicken, add fresh mushrooms and also an onion.

Delicious! Just what I expect from Tetrazzini! I think it would be good as listed, but I was trying to replicate a specific meal I had eaten before, so I made some changes. 

I sauteed some extra veggies with the mushrooms: 1/2 an onion, chopped,  4 mini sweet peppers (equivalent of 1/2 an orange bell pepper), chopped; and about a cup and a half of celery, sliced. I used one can each of cream of: celery, chicken, and mushroom soups. And for the chicken, I used all of the meat I could glean from a Store-Bought Rotisserie Chicken. (Mine was plain chicken, from Whole Foods. Most other stores season theirs). 

With those additions, this needed a loaf pan in addition to the 9 by 13 pan. I baked both at once, and it was done within the time range listed on the original recipe. I definitely plan to make this again!

I've made this a few times, and I swore I'd already reviewed it, but apparently not.  I have used leftover turkey both times, and it works just as well.  Good recipe, and it freezes well.  A few times when making it, I've gotten a little carried away with the broth, so carefully add in the broth to make it sloppy.  You don't want it too watery!  It holds up to modifications--like adding different vegetables, and it is now a staple in our house.  Enjoy!

Very good with some of the tweeks other reviewers recommended.  However, was disappointed in the amount - we doubled and used for a church function and it only filled nine 2 1/4 lb loaf pans!  Usually for 36 people recipes make 11 or 12.

this casserole was tasty and it's true that you can easily make two casseroles from this one dish. however, i will never make this recipe again. IT WAS JUST TOO MUCH WORK! it doesn't seem like there are too many ingredients but it took forever to assemble.

This is a delicious casserole! Added garlic salt, left out pimento and mushrooms b/c I didn't have any, and used italian cheese blend - homey and creamy without being bland.  Topped with chopped red onion and its great!

My husband and I both LOVE this recipe. I usually use the precooked whole chickens that you can buy at the store, and they are great. The boiled chicken is good with it too. For variation I use sliced banana peppers instead of pimentos, as my hubby and I are big pepper fans. Husband asks for this dinner all the time. Thanks!

I love this recipe!  Perfect for making for friends with large families when there is a new baby, a move to a new house, a family illness, etc.  It tastes good, is relatively easy to make,  and transports easily.  Moreover, kids eat it with gusto. Thanks for sharing!

This definitely makes a LARGE dish of food!  I substituted a 16 oz of frozen peas (thawed) for the pimento and used 1 (14 1/2 oz) can of low sodium/no fat chicken broth and only 6oz of 2% sharp cheddar cheese.  It was still a little too creamy for my taste, but still quite good.  We froze half of it too.

This was good. I made the full recipe and gave one to my neighbor, though I haven't heard her verdict yet. My fiance and I managed to finish the one pan in about 3 days. I used precooked chicken and canned (low-sodium) chicken broth. I added frozen broccoli and sauted the 1 lb of mushrooms with 2 cloves chopped garlic and 1 small onion in good olive oil. I also added black and red pepper, and used both mild and sharp cheddar cheeses. Next time (and my fiance says there will be a next time!) I will not use 3 cans of cream of mushroom soup. I will probably use 2 cans and add more broth, I found the condensed soup made the whole dish very heavy and I would have liked the texture a bit more if it were creamy rather than gloppy. Thanks though, for a functional recipe.

Lois, this is SOOOOOOO  yummy!!!!  Thank you for sharing it!  My husband can't eat the tetrazini with sour cream in it and this is terrific.  I split the recipe in half and used egg noodles.  I also used cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom, and sauteed onion with the mushrooms.  This was a hit at home and will definitely be added to our menu!

A good guide for a casserole if you don't have the proper ingredients. I scaled everything way down- only one can of soup, about eight oz. pasta, about 4-6 chicken breasts. Didn't have mushrooms or pimentos so I added some celery, carrots, onions, green beans. My kids loved it, and so did my hubby.

This was fantastic!  I made 2, 9 x 13 casseroles with this recipe.  Each pan wasn't completely full but pretty close.  One dish was for a family who just had a baby and one was for my own family, of which we ate off of for two meals.  I think this recipe is spiced up by how you saute your mushrooms.  So do that right and follow the rest of the recipe, of course using whichever cream of soups.  It will be a delicious hit.  Next time I will probably make 3, 8 x 8 casseroles instead and freeze 2 for future dinners.  What a great recipe!  Thanks.

This was the easiest version to make Tetrazinni!!!  I used the same water I boiled the chicken in, to boil the pasta!! Adds a more "chickeny" flavor!!!

I dunno, maybe I didn't make it correctly, but I thought this was only passable.

This went over really good with my guests.  I added a little bit more of the pimentos for a little extra zip.  It turned out awesome, and if you like cheese add a little extra it definately doesn't hurt.

I added ingredients like celery, almonds, onions and black olives.  I also used linguini instead of spaghetti.  It was very good and made A LOT!  This was the perfect main dish for my bunco group!

My family loves this! I added frozen peas to the mix and topped it all with crushed potato chips before I baked it. I also divide it and freeze it, as well. Easy..Easy..Easy!!!

I have had this dish with heavy cream, so I was excited to this one with out the heavy cream, this was a wonderfull dish. My husband is not very caring for mushroom, but I left them in and he didnt mind He though this was a great dish. I added one and a half cans of milk to the soups and a can and half of left over chicken broth. Took me about 45 minutes to get it to the oven.
