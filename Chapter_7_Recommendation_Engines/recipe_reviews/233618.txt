Amazing texture! I made these vegan so skipped the egg and the cheese but the flax is more than enough to bind the mixture without egg - just added a little water to the flax. Instead of the cheese I added nutritional yeast. Would like to play around more the spices but as a base this recipe is truly wonderful!

After trying several veggie burger recipes, I found this one to be my favorite. I used pecans and walnuts, melted cheese on a couple and skipped the pan frying at the end. The whole family loved these burgers.

My family of meat eating boys loved these burgers. I pureed the ingredients in the food processor, but next time I think I'll do it in batches...puree the beans but leave some of the rice and onions nuts whole to give it texture. But even with my mistake, we ate them all.  awesome!

This was excellent.  Okay, I added a little garlic salt and didn't have olives.  I believe if I had the olives, I would not have added the garlic salt.  I didn't have a food processor so I fought the good fight with a Bullet.  The mixture was a little thick so I had to add a tsp of water while blending batches so it would blend.  I skipped the skillet because it was fine without it.  I will be getting me a fp, if for no other reason, to make these.  It was work, but DE-LISH!!!

These were great! If I hadn't made them myself,  I would think they were made of beef. In my oven,  I had to cook them for a total of 24 minutes.

My husband is a vegetarian, and we have been looking for the best veggie burger recipe around--this is hands down the best one we have tried so far. We make a triple batch, and store it in our freezer--easy grab and go when we head to BBQ's during the summer.  And so versatile by adding/exchanging other ingredients.  Meat eaters like this recipe as well.

This was the best veggie burger I've had!  I didn't have olives, so just used a couple of tablespoons of olive tapenade.  I also forgot to add the onions, so added them before cooking them (let the mixture refrigerate overnight).  After adding onions and forming the parties, I put them in the freezer for about an hour while the grill heated up.  Threw them in the grill and came out perfect!!!!  Will try subbing the brown rice for toasted oats and different nuts, just to experiment a little.

I made this vegan friendly by using chia seeds and water instead of egg, omitting the Worcestershire, and replaced the parm with grated vegan cheddar. They were delish, definitely my favorite vegan burger thus far. Will add to the rotation. Thanks Rebecca!

After trying all the store-bought veggie burgers, I knew that I had to find a homemade version to eliminate the soy and other unwanted ingredients. These are the BEST! My husband loved all the flavors and natural goodness in them. I love that I can make a batch (or two) and throw them in the freezer before I cook them. I put one or two on a baking sheet in a 375 degree oven whenever we get a craving for them (and skip the stove-top step). We like to top them with a little mayo, tomato slices, salt, and pepper.

This is exactly as advertised--the best ever.  I made a mushroom soup that ended up working as a sauce on top of this that just pushed it that much further toward absolute perfection!  Really, if you're a vegetarian or just cutting down on meat... these are better than meat burgers.  I agree with other reviewers who advised not to process too much... keep some of the texture.

These were SOOOO good! We skipped the black olives and mushrooms and put in green pepper. Makes 12 so the leftovers were wrapped individually and frozen for lunches. Perfect!

I have to say these burgers were very good. I halved the recipe, used quinoa instead of rice and probably ended up quadrupling the mushrooms (by mistake) so that's probably why they fell apart, but they were delicious nonetheless.

Followed recipe to a T.    These were just ok to us.    We like Butter Bean Burgers on allrecipes better, so back to those for us.

I get very nervous making veggie burgers, because they always fall apart for me and I end up with a mess. This is my now my “go to” recipe for veggie burgers. As has been said before, this is a very flexible recipe, substitutions made easily. I used peanuts, sunflower seeds, green onion, small red beans and black beans. Also a tablespoon of meatloaf seasoning b/c that’s what I had.Reading the reviews regarding flavor, I added a whole jalapeño, a half of an orange bell pepper, and a couple tiny drops of liquid smoke.  Other than those adjustments, I made them as written.Formed them into patties ( I got 11, nicely portioned burgers) baked, then very gingerly and quickly grilled them. Only 2, tried to fall apart, so for me than is a major success! They looked like beef burgers and had a nice flavor. Next time I’ll add a little more meatloaf seasoning, but not much. This is an amazing recipe!!!! Thank you,

So, I did have to make a few changes due to food allergies, and I think I struggled some with the process.  But what I made was a bit dry and bland.  My kids ate it without complaint, but definitely not as tasty as the 90% grass fed ground beef we'd been eating (tho certainly lower fat!)

My alterations:  I'm allergic to garlic and hubby is allergic to onion, so I only put in one large shallot.  I have never found a bullion thats safe for all of us, so I used miso.  I used vegan Parmesan (dairy allergies) - which works great in a lot of situations, but I think it may have played a role in the dry texture here.  

I probably over-baked them.  I made them thin, and cooked them with convection on, and they werent browning so I left them in a while - maybe too long, as they were a little tough on the outside and dry on the inside.  I did fry up the kids burgers in bacon fat (we usually put bacon on burgers, so . . ).  Hubby and I ate them right out of the oven. 

No one loved them.  I may or may not try again.  I think they would be willing to put up with this as an occasional meal.  I do wonder if it would help if I cooked a shorter time, not on convection, and used some other cheese subs that actually have fat and water content?  Idk.

Oh, almost forgot - i also struggled with preparation more than expected.  I guess I put it all in my very large food processor, but it got gummy.  My brown rice was wet and still warm.  I had to scoop everything out and then manually pick throug

Husband loved! I had to improvise on quantities and didn't have parmesan cheese - very forgiving recipe! I would have added salt since I didn't have parmesan.

This was my first time using a veggie burger recipe. I did not want to use soy, so this was great in that regard. I substituted black beans for pinto beans as I don't care for pinto beans flavor, and also bypassed the mushrooms and olives and used green peppers instead. I debated about seasoning the mix as I noted there weren't any spices added to the mix. I decided to follow the recipe and not add any seasoning. I was pleased with the overall appearance of the patty and the consistency. I do wish that I would have actually added some spices. That is the only thing I think it needs.

I followed the recipe very closely and they came out great. For me, adding a bunch of Tabasco sauce to my sandwich worked excellently. By the way, the appearance of these so closely resembles beef that you certainly could fool the eye.
