With Power Bowls on so many menus now, I wanted to try making this at home. I think it could use a sprinkle of red pepper flakes.  I didn’t have feta on hand and when I make it again I’ll be sure to have it since I think it’s a key ingredient.  Loved the lemon dressing.  Will make again for sure.  Would be good with salmon or shrimp, too.

I liked it a lot. . It has a really nice bright, lemony flavor. I had 10 minute quinoa which I took out of boil in bags and used as if regular quinoa. It worked fine
