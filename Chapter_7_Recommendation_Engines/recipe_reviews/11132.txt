I've been making these for years...They are much better when you layer as follows: melted butter, sprinkle crushed crackers next, chocolate chips, walnuts, coconut & save the sweetened milk for Last. No need to press them down either. Cook for 28 minutes & you have the best cookie ever!

A family favorite at my house.  If you use a glass pan, you need to reduce the temperature by 25 degrees or the outside edge gets very hard.

The came out terrible. Even the guys at work did not eat them. There was no balance between the ingredients - too much crust, not enough chocolate. Parts were so hard they ended up going out to the birds. I was very careful in following the recipe, since this was the first time I had made them. I am no t a novice cook, and yes I do know the difference between evaporated and sweetened-condensed milk.

I usually make half as many of these using a 9X13 pan, and I always toss in a cup of butterscotch chips as well.  These are always a favorite!

Excellent, easy treat.    I line my pan with parchment paper......bars come out very, very easy....(chill first)  Also, I put 1/2 choc chips and 1/2 butterscotch chips on top of the crust, then the nuts, then the coconut......then, I pour the sweetened condensed milk over the top of this.....  Works much, much, better.

Looks like the last reviewer used EVAPORATED milk instead of Condensed. Make sure you use condensed or you will have a soupy mess on your hands!!

My family has enjoyed these for years and years.  However, we take out the nuts and coconut flakes.  And we sprinkle the chocolate chips on top without pressing them into the condensed milk.  One pan is usually gone in a night and there are only 4 of us!

I didn't have graham cracker crumbs so I had to use oreo crumbs, but I will agree that they were a bit too greasy.  However, everything tasted good together in combination (I think it would have def been better with graham cracker crumbs, less butter or more crumbs to avoid all the greasy texture)  Delish otherwise!

I have made this and I have made a easier recipe and they were practically the same! Just make home-aid cookies like you normally do then place them in a pan and sprinkle with nuts and bake! ta-da! so simple.

I started to make  these according to the recipe and realized that there was too much butter for the amount of graham cracker crumbs. I made a second trip to the store to get more graham crackers to soak up the butter. This resulted in too much crust. I used two jelly roll pans. The ingredients boiled over and spilled in the oven, burning and smelling up the house! They tasted fine but would re adjust the butter and use a 9x13 cake pan in the future.

These are SO EASY to make!!!  That alone is a good recommendation.  I live in Guatemala and don't always have access to all the ingredients, so didn't have nuts to put on it, but I don't think anybody notices, as they were so busy fighting over the left over crumbs.  I did have to make a few adjustments.  I didn't have enough graham crackers, so added about a cup of oatmeal to the  crumbs, and about 1/4 cup of brown sugar to imitate the sweetness of the crackers.  I don't have a full sheet cake pan, but cut the recipe in half and it worked well on a regular cookie sheet, lined with parchment paper.  These will definitely become favorites in my community.  Thank you for an easy, quick and delicious treat.
