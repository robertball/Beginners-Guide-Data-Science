I love herbed focaccia bread and this recipe sounded fairly easy.  I thought it had a tad too much rosemary..(i'm not a big fan). And of course a little oregano is a must!!  Use the leftovers for dipping in pasta sauce.  Just pop in the toaster oven till crispy.

I have yet to make the sandwich. My comments are about the bread. This is an easy and very delicious bread to make. I make it to go with our spaghetti dinners or any italian meal. I don't bother to let it raise the second time. I just put it on the cookie sheet and put all manner of italian spices on it and throw it in the oven. We love to dip it in olive oil and vinegar while it is still warm. It doesnt last two days.
