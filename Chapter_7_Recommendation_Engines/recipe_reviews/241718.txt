This is a great recipe!! My husband is a meatball fan so this was perfect for us. Very creamy and comforting. Will be making again for sure.

I'm the author of this recipe. I should have stated that the sausage is ground sausage such as Jimmy Dean's Pork Sausage.

I used Italian bread crumbs instead of plain bread crumbs. It is a time consuming recipe. But it is well worth it.
