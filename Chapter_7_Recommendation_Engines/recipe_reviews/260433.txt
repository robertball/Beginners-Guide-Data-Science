These were excellent! I made another kabob recipe along with this one last night and this one came out on top. Because I was making two different recipes and because there is only two of us, I halved the recipe. I don't know what half of 1/8 teaspoon pomegranate syrup would be but it couldn't be enough to make a difference in my opinion and I sure wasn't going to buy it for that. All of the flavors came together perfectly in this. I'm typically not a fan of allspice but it totally works in this one. This one is a keeper and 5 stars all the way!
