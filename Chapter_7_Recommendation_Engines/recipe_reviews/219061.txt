This recipe was all I had hoped it would be.  Hot, creamy and delicious!  My son wanted homemade mac n' cheese before heading back to school.  I wasn't sure what he and DH would think of the tomatoes in this dish.  Both loved it and said to be sure and save this recipe.  I made it as written, only using low-fat cottage cheese and light sour cream.  My son took most of the leftovers back to school with him.  Thanks FrackFamily5 for sharing your recipe, it will be made again.

I made only one change--I cut the elbow macaroni in half and stirred in one cooked, drained package of SteamFresh broccoli cuts. My family thought this was okay, they didn't much care for the whole tomatoes in the dish. My husband thought it was a little bland. If I were to make this again, I'd use a can of diced tomatoes and stir the whole mess into the macaroni and cheese ingredients and maybe add a couple spices. I'll try it again that way, then re-review.

In the interest of cutting down on the fat I used fat free sour cream, 1% milkfat cottage cheese, 2% reduced fat shredded cheddar and smart balance spread (1/2c) and omitted the can of whole tomatoes, I have to say it was just awful!  I was curious, being with Weight Watchers and I can say it was definitely a waste of points, how many, I don't have a clue, I didn't eat much of it and will have to throw it out.  I have come to the conclusion that the only way to have this is with the full fat ingredients, low fat and fat free do not do this justice.  The best recipe on this site, "Moms' baked macaroni and cheese" is hands down the best!!  I will just have to go back to that one and have it only occasionally.  Oh well, live and learn!

This recipe reminds me of my 95 y.o. mom telling how her mom made this every Friday (they were Catholic) with home canned tomatoes.  I always thought it sounded SO gross.  Boy was I wrong.  It is good w/store bought tomatoes and am hoping someday I'll be able to make it w/home canned. :-)  Thanks for sharing

I cooked some onion and bell pepper that had to be used up in the butter and added them to the mix. Other than that, kept it the same. Turned out good, and the leftovers are tasty as well.

This is better in my opinion without the cottage cheese. It's better to mix quickly after noodles are boiled and get a creamy cheesy mix...also might help to stir in a little milk as needed. I like fresh tomato slices on top!

I didn't have sour cream and added too many green chilies, so I'd like to try again with the right ingredients, but it was good and not greasy.

I used a small can of green chilies, diced, and diced up some roasted red peppers. Also used 12-16oz Velveeta for the cheese and crumbled some bread crumbs before baking. Turned out great!
