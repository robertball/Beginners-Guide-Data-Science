We really enjoyed these. Will definitely make again. I did a few substitutions because I didn't have all the original ingredients. I used shredded cheddar instead of feta, and used 1/8 tsp. dried basil in place of the fresh. I also added 1/8tsp. of garlic powder. Otherwise I followed the recipe. Really good.

These are yummy, you an change the flavors up with different cheeses and spices. I use this recipe to make pizza. Roll the mix flat on a sprayed pizza pan, bake, add sauce,  add toppings then cook till topping are heated though.

We liked these! I used whole wheat seasoned breadcrumbs and added a little garlic powder. Oh, and because the kids do not care for feta cheese, I used a mix of parmesan and mozzarella. I topped 1/2 with mozzarella before baking and they were perfectly cooked in 15 minutes. These also came out of the pan nicely, which is something I was worried about. I would make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I LOVED the Tots, my family loved the Tots, and my co-workers loved the Tots.  When I made the original Tots in the mini muffin pan I went exactly by the recipe.  Just a little salty. When I made the Tots a 2nd time, I doubled up the recipe, left out the salt, and used a regular muffin pan. DELICIOUS!!!

Turned out ok.  It was really hard to get the muffins out of the pan.

I used the recipe as listed and quadrupled it because I have sooo much zucchini, and I shaped them with a small melon baller to bake on cookie sheets. After 15 minutes turned them to brown the other side for the last three minutes. Came out perfect and yummy!

We loved these! Next time I will try to put them on parchment paper like a meatball instead of the mini muffins as that was hard to clean up. I also want to try with onion for a little more flavor. I will be making these again for sure!

I loved these and my family did as well! I used mild cheddar and added a few extra shavings on top and cooked them a few extra minutes (we love cheese)

Tasty way to use up zucchini. This recipe only filled up 13 holes in my mini-muffin tin so I could have made a double recipe. I used a clove of fresh garlic in place of garlic powder, and an 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper in place of the black pepper, but I didn't taste the cayenne. I didn't have bread crumbs so I used crushed stuffing mix. The tots came out a bit too salty so that might have been from using the stuffing mix. I mostly just tasted the stuffing flavor. I like this recipe and will be making it again.

The family enjoyed and said 4 stars(I wouldn't be that generous).  I thought they were too salty and just kind of ehhhh.  I'll take regular tater tots and fried zucchini any day over these!

These were so yummy and I’ll definitely make them again! I used cheddar instead of feta because it’s what I had. I also shaped mine into tots and put on a cookie sheet instead of using a muffin pan. I ran out of room and had a few left so I dropped them in the deep fryer just to see...won’t do that again. The deep fryer doesn’t do them any favors they were much better out of the oven! Thanks for the recipe!

I cooked it in the air fryer at 350 for about 10-12 minutes depending on the size of your nuggets.

Made as written except that I used the two spoon method to "shape" the tots and I baked them on a regular pizza pan. These were good but had a sweetness to them that I think came from the carrots. Next time I will leave out the carrots and serve with a warm marinara sauce instead of the sauce I chose to use this go around.
