This recipe is very close to one that was on a crab salad that we purchased in the grocery store in Spain. It had brandy instead of whisky and I substituted brandy when I made the recipe and liked it very well. Thanks for having this great salsa which is so great on crab salad.

Grazie Lucia. This is truly the original. Great for shrimp salads. The ratio is just just right for a nice dressing. If you don't want to use the whiskey just leave it out. The consistency will be slightly thicker but still perfect for salads. When I use the whiskey I only put 1 tsp instead of 1 Tbsp.
