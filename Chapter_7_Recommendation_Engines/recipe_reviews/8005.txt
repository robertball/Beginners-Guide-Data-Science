Great recipe! Everyone loved it and it was super easy to make. I think next time I'll use less whipped topping though, it overpowered the cream cheese taste, IMHO.

This recipes is very good and very easy .  It always gets rave reviews.  The cheesecake layer is a little light so I usually call it strawberry cheese pie instead of cheesecake.  I usually use strawberry or cherry pie filling on top instead of fresh fruit.  I think the tartness of the cherries is a nice contrast to the mild sweetness of the cheesecake layer.  I think it wouldn't be sweet enough with just plain fruit so if I were going to use fresh fruit, I think I would puree it with a little sugar.

This is just what I was looking for-a fluffy, creamy cheesecake.  I did use 6oz of whipped topping instead of the whole container.  Everyone loved it!

Excellent and very easy recipe!!  Cut the whipped topping to 8 oz as per previous reviewer suggestions.  As strawberries aren't so flavorful at this time of year, I melted about 1/4 cup of strawberry jam and tossed with the sliced stawberries which made them taste amazing!  Also drizzled some melted chocolate on top.  The whole pie was gone between 4 people!

Perfect recipe for people watching their sugar intake. I made this last night with a couple of subs: 1/4 cup Splenda and only 6-8 oz of Lite Whipped Cream. Used 8oz real cream cheese and whipped it all up with a spatula. Poured into a pre-baked pie shell and let sit for about 4 hours. If I figured it out correctly, there is no more than 7 carbs per slice (6 slices per pie). A perfect light dessert that satisfies the sweet tooth but doesn't blow the carbs out of control. Think I will add a package of SF instant pudding mix to the filling to change the flavors around. Will see what happens but if it turns out good, have found my new go to dessert recipe for the diabetics in my family.

This recipe knocked our socks off, and it was a snap to make.  My husband had to force himself not to eat the entire pie.  After one bite, he said, "This is the very best dessert you've ever made!"  It’s so light and fresh tasting with nice summer fruit in the markets right now.  Here’s what I did:  Used 8 ounces of lite whipped topping rather than 12 oz.  Added 1/3 C. of instant vanilla pudding to a brick of cream cheese, along with 2 T. of white sugar, 2 tsp. lemon juice, and a bit of vanilla.  (The pudding was a worthwhile experiment!)  Next time, I’ll add more lemon juice.   I used fresh blueberries for the topping.  My graham cracker crust was leftover from another recipe, and it only covered the bottom of the pie plate, which was fine.  Didn't take long at all for the filling to "set up" before I topped it with fruit.  Also, note that it was very easy to slice – it stayed firm while slicing.  What a fantastic summer recipe!  Thanks Anne-Marie!

This gets 5 stars just for the sheer fact that this was the easiest thing I've ever made and it seems wrong somehow for it to have tasted as good as it did.  My 5yo daughter wanted to make cheesecake for Christmas dessert so I wanted something easy that she could help with and this was it!!!  I'll admit it doesn't have that dense richness of "real" cheesecake but I'm willing to forgo that for convenience sake.  It was creamy and delicious.  The entire family loved it.  My husband did say he found it a bit too sweet so I may cut the sugar down some next time but even that didn't stop him from eating more than once slice. Great recipe.  I'll be making cheesecake more often now.

Overall this recipe is really good.  It's a quick easy cheesecake that isn't too rich.  I have used this recipe a few times and I found that it works better with less whipped cream, probably about 8 oz.

My mom used to make this for us all the time when we were kids.  I make it now for my family and it is super easy. My only change is that I add 1 tablespoon of pure vanilla extract while it is mixing.  Great for a quick dessert.

My 10 year old daughter made this and it was great! It was her first "cheesecake" making experience and it was fun for her. She topped it with sliced strawberries. She wants to stir in some peanut butter and chocolate chips next time. It's a very quick and simple recipe when you can't make the real thing.

OH.......MY.......GOODNESS!!!!! This is my now-favorite pie. Made this pie in "Shortbread Crust" recipe by Silly Rabbit. Served at Thanksgiving with twelve people tasting it. It was unanimously loved. Had to make a second pie! It wasn't too sweet either. It seems to have the correct balance. Thank you for this recipe!!!

I gave the recipe 4 stars because I had to change/add a couple things. I only used 1/2 a container of the cool whip as others suggested. I added 1/2 a teaspoon of vanilla extract and 1/2 a teaspoon of lemon juice to the sugar and cream cheese mixture to give it a little something extra. I have to tell you this is the BEST no bake cheesecake I've ever made. I will definitely be using the recipe again.

Gosh, how easy is this?!  I did process some bananas and blended those into the cream cheese/sugar mixture before adding the whipped topping.  Looked like enough filling to do two of the pie shells, so I went for it.  They were not quite full but by the time I added the strawberries (strawberry/sugar blend) you really couldn't tell.  Simply delish!

Omg!  This recipe is amazing.  I used less whipped cream and added vanilla and fresh squeezed lemon.  I then added the strawberries, sliced almonds and drizzles melted Nutella.  We ate the entire thing.

I've made this cheesecake time and time again, just as is, and people LOVE IT!! I've also tried it with cookie pieces and crumbs added on the inside and scattered on top. I personally prefer macaroons. Great recipe.

Great! Added  little more cream cheese and less whip cream, it turned out perfect.  Instead of sliced strawberries..I made my own fresh strawberry sauce.  I took 1 cup of fresh (or frozen) strawberries, added a few tablespoons of cran-apple juice (or whatever kind), a few tablespoons of honey and a tsp of cornstarch. Simmered in a small pot on low for about 15-20 minutes.  Refrigerate and spoon over cheesecake when ready.  It was SO tasty and better than most restaurant cheesecakes.  I think next time I may try light cream cheese and light Cool Whip for a slightly healthier version =)

VERY easy recipe that was super yummy! I made this for my husband's birthday, and I substituted low-fat cream cheese and light Cool Whip and couldn't taste a difference. I also followed other reviewers' suggestions and used 8 oz. of Cool Whip instead of the 12 that was called for (I think 8 oz. was perfect-anymore would detract from the cream cheese flavor). I will definitely be making this again!

OMG!!  This was sooo good!!  I didnt use the graham cracker crust simply because I cant eat wheat but the filling was a dream and so easy to make.  It literally took me 3 minutes to make it and it completely satisfied my sweet tooth!!

I made this twice on Easter weekend and it was loved by everyone.  Not too heavy but nice and light and creamy.  I used chocolate wafer crust, a bit less Cool Whip and put a chocolate ganache on top made with bittersweet chocolate.  This will become a favourite.  Thanks for sharing this!

I liked it but it did not taste like a cheese cake.The whipped cream overpowered and made it taste just like whipped cream instead of cheesecake.My family loved it though.That is my only complaint.I will make again though.

Can't get much easier than this one.  I prepared the filling and then put it into mini graham crusts for my kids.  Topped with fresh strawberries (yeah!) and blueberries, my kids loved that I made them individual and didn't care that it wasn't "real" cheesecake.  This is an easy dessert that can be prepared ahead of time and topped in so many different ways.

Such an easy dessert.. I took others advice and used cherry pie filling instead of fresh fruit as well as 8oz lite whip topping instead of 12oz of regular whip topping. It brings the cream cheese flavor out so much more. Overall this is such a delicous treat to serve.

You must beat this heavily with an electric mixer to make it set up properly. It was yummy with mini choc chips.

I was nervous about this one, thinking there was no way some cream cheese, sugar, and Cool Whip thrown together could taste all that great, but I was wrong. This is a great summer recipe, though I did as other reviewers recommended and halved the whipped topping. I also added a splash of vanilla.

I have made this twice and it is delicious.  The first time, I used 8 oz. whipped topping; the second time, I used even less-- probably 6 oz.  It had more of a "cheesecake" taste this way.  I also lightly tossed my berries with a tablespoon or two of homemade strawberry freezer jam.  It was delicious!

Yummy and soooo easy, I halved the whipped cream, used fat free cream cheese and topped with chocolate chips and crushed vanilla waffers. Perfect when you don't have time to bake a real one.

This was simple and easy to begin with but I made a few changes. I wanted more of a strawberry taste so I added pureed strawberries to the mix.  I also used 8oz. of whipped topping and about 10oz. of cream cheese. I liked that the cheesecake was strawberry flavored, not just with strawberries on top.

I took the advice of others and added extra cream cheese, and it was just too much. I think ill just follow the recipe next time and see how that is.

I've been making this since I learned how to make this from my mother in law. 
She'd had the recipe for years that she'd clipped from a magazine. It was originally called Summer Cheesecake. 
It's a simple dessert and not as heavy
as your typical cheesecake. I like it best with fresh strawberries.

This was a super easy recipe, but I thought it tasted like whipped cream with a little cream cheese added.  I doubled the cream cheese & sugar & added in 16 oz whipped cream.  This made enough for 2 cheesecakes.  I also made this for friends & added 2 tbsp cinnamon (for something different).  Turned out GREAT!!  I got rave reviews on it!!

Wow! I totally loved this recipe! The only change I made was I used soy cream cheese due to allergies in my family. Oh and I also added 1/4 cup key lime juice to give it a kick. Super easy and didn't last two days in my house! Yummo!

I tried this and it is pretty good. I do think it was missing something though. 

Maybe a little less cool whip and some lemon or almond extract it would be fabulous.

I made this no-bake cheesecake exactly as written for my mom’s birthday. It was a quick option for a yummy dessert. We topped it with strawberry pie filling and a little whipped cream. Next time I would make it in a smaller pie crust as the batter didn’t quite fill the 9-inch crust to the top the way I would’ve liked. But altogether delish!

I loved it! But I didn't use strawberries. I wanted something new and fresh. It made a good base for adding thing you probably already have. I added ground cinnamon and pecan pieces. You really could add anything and it's just as tasty on its own. Keep in mind it's only as good as the quality of your ingredients.

I really liked this. Very easy, I read some of the reviews and did revise it a bit. I used 2 pks of cream cheese, 2 small ready to eat vanilla puddings, 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. I will make this for Christmas as well.

Love this cheesecake recipe. Not a big fan of regular cheesecake that feels like a brick in your belly when eaten. This is light and sits well after a hot summer day. I used the 8 oz of whipped cream and upped the strawberries to 1 lb, sliced small. Made my own crust: 1 1/2 c of crushed graham crackers, 6TBLS softened (room temp not melted) butter, 1/3 c sugar, blended/crumbly and pressed into pan (fridged for 1 hr) I also added a little strawberry glaze to the strawberries and layered on top. I also have used the 9x13 for thinner slices or the 8x11 for thicker slices. I used my glass casseroles for easier removal upon serving. **Cut the fat/calories/sugar by using no/low fat/sugar ingredients.

This should not be called a "Cheesecake" nor should the picture of a traditional cheesecake be shown.  (It's a bit misleading).  It's more like a fluffy whipped pie with a subtle cheesecake flavor.  Nice and light, though, and "good" nonetheless.  I, too, reduced the whipped topping to 8 oz. and am glad I did.  Quick and easy,

I couldn't get the cream cheese to fold nicely with the whipped topping.. it was all just chunky even though I'd beat the cream cheese in the kitchen aid for a while. My mother and son loved this because it was so light. My husband (a true cheesecake lover) did not because it was authentic enough. It's a tough call as to whether I'll make this or not again because it was so split down the middle but it wasn't a bad cheesecake at all and a good no bake option for a hot summer day. :) Thanks!

This cheesecake was AMAZINGGGGGGG!!!!!! It was super easy and soooo delicious, and all my friends lovee it. The only thing I had issues with was getting it to solidify...... I had to put it in my freezer for almost three hours before it was firm. Other than that, best cheesecake I ever had! DEFINITELY going to make it again.

Easy and yummy. Did cut the whipped topping in 1/2. Also, mixed strawberries with some sugar for topping as they strawberries weren't that great.

This is soo yummy, I used half of the asked whipped cream and it was still a little to much for my taste. I used Lowfat and fatfree cream cheese combined and fat free whipped topping and you couldnt even tell. I also added a capfull of vanilla. I will definitely be making this again!!

Very good. I used the smaller container of whip cream. I brought it to work, but didn't feel comortable calling it cheese cake. It's more like whipped cheese cream pie. Next time I will try the same amount of whip cream and double the cream cheese. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I have been making his cheesecake for yrs, and everyone who has tasted it loves it!  I alway's have to triple the batch, and put it in my lasagna pan, and there is never any left.  I use graham cracker crumbs and butter and a little sugar to make a light/thin crust that is still crumbly, because I am not big on hard/thick crusts.  I also find that keeping it in the fridge overnight makes it set and taste not so whipped creamy.  So I alway's make it the day before.  It's always a big hit!

I love this recipe and have been using it for years as well. I have altered it to maximize the texture. I use one 12 ounce conainer of light cream cheese, 2/3 cup of white sugar, 2 teaspoons of vanilla and one 12 ounce container of light cool whip. Let cool whip and cream cheese sit out for an hour to soften, then beat all ingerdients for only about 30 seconds. Pour mixture into crust (I also cheat and buy store bought) top with fresh fruit (I like strawberries, blackberries, blueberries). Pop it in the freezer for a few hours or even overnight, and remove an hour before serving. Very light and fruity; great for summer!  I have also done a chocolate version be omitting the sugar and using a melted chocolate bar in it's place (I love using hershey's sympthony bar with toffee and almond pieces; must use the large size bar, 4.25 ounces) then top with crushed cany pieces (I use crushed Heath Bar). Pour into pie crust (I use graham cracker or oreo store bought crust). Again, freeze it and remove about an hour before serving.  ENJOY!

It was light and creamy, I still can't get over using the whipped topping but my family loved it. I used 1/2 the frozen topping as called for. I made a wild blueberry sauce and served it warm on top of the cake.

I love this recipe. It's quite a bit lighter than a traditional cheesecake which is what I like about it. I prefer to put melted jam on top instead of the strawberries as suggested by another reviewer.

Awesome!! This was so easy. I put about 6 oz of the whipped topping. I licked the bowl and the spoon.  We picked strawberries yesterday and I slice them up to put on top. Then I went to the store and bought more cream cheese and cool whip. Other reviews are correct, this is not as rich as baked cheesecake, but who cares, its yummy!!

I am a fan of cheesecake; either cooked or uncooked. It was fluffy but the whipped topping overpowers the cream cheese. And i used only half the amount in the recipe. This one I wouldn't make again, which dissappoints me. Sorry.

I really liked this a whole lot.  I took it to a woman's bible study and everybody loved it.  I halfed my strawberries and let them sit in sugar while I was making the pie.  I made my own graham crack pie crust and used 2-8 ounce packs of cream cheese.  I did not add more sugar it was great and easy.  I will make this again and again.

This was delicious! It was so fast and so easy to make! Everyone loved it! I took the advice and used 6 oz. of whipped cream instead of 12 oz. I bought the 8 oz. container and reserved the 2 oz. for garnishing. I also bought strawberry glaze and spread it on top and filled the whole top with fresh strawberries cut in half, it was great! This is a recipe I will continue to use!

I made this is cheesecake in a "extra two servings" pie crust so I used two packages of cream cheese and the entire 12 oz of whipped topping (I got the creamy kind), I didnt add anything else to it but an extra 1/4 of sugar. I made a strawberry glaze to go on top, it was fantastic.
