I LOVE pickled eggs, and this recipe is no different. I was a little skeptical of the beer, but the flavor is very mild. It just all works perfectly together. I used Sam Adams Boston Lager. Next time I will experiment with something different and see what happens. These are perfect for a quick snack or on-the-go breakfast. Btw, this recipe should really have a higher rating - one of the reviewers left a favorable review, yet mistakenly only gave it 1 star. Perhaps they put too much beer in their eggs? ;)

The Saranac Seasonal Ale is  a nice added touch!  I had prepared pickling spice, 1 1/2 cup white vinegar and 1 1/2 water and then saw this beer addition.   I divided 8 eggs each into (2)  used, clean spaghetti sauce jars.    I just sampled the brine:  YUMMMM.     Nice idea.     I don't think they will last long.

Nothing goes with pickled eggs better than beer.  With this recipe they go even better.

Made this nearly as is except I left out the parsley flakes and added 3 cloves of garlic.  Used Great Lakes Dortmunder Lager.   I'm hooked on these!  Unfortunate about the rating mistake by another reviewer.  I almost skipped this because of the middlin' rating.  Let's bring it up!  These are 5 star!

I only used garlic and dill  instead of parsley flakes, the beer and vinegar, and a little juice from some dill pickled carrots that had a bit of pickling spices in it. They won't be ready until tomorrow.
