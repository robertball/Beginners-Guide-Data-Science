I have GOT to remember this recipe! Surprisingly, astoundingly delicious, one of the better pieces of chicken I've ever had. With Hubs out of town I wanted something simple but special for supper and this appeared to be what I had in mind.  I wasn't about to fire up the grill however.  I removed the chicken breasts from the marinade, put them in a shallow pan and drizzled them with melted butter and a few good shakes of salt and pepper.  I baked them at 400 degrees for 20 minutes, then sprinkled them with paprika and finished them off under the broiler for a couple of minutes to give them an attractive golden-brown color. I let them rest for a few minutes and in the meantime prepared a bed of baby spinach and arugula, sliced avocado and grape tomatoes. I drizzled them with a light lemon Dijon vinaigrette, then laid the sliced chicken over the bed of greens. For added measure I then poured over some of the wonderful juices that had accumulated in the pan. Moist, tender, juicy and with outstanding flavor.  I was incrediby impressed that this seemingly unremarkable marinade would prove to be so spectacular.  I did use olive oil rather than vegetable oil and skipped the ginger as it doesn't move me - these were small changes that nevertheless were necessary for me and suited my tastes perfectly.  This chicken was so good I can't imagine it suffered at all from being baked and not grilled, and because it turned out SO good I know I'll probably prepare them the same way next time.

This marinade has a really delicious herb flavor.  I  pounded 4 boneless chicken breasts down to 1/2 inch thick.  I used low sodium soy, olive oil instead of vegetable and powedered ginger.  I let this marinate all day.  I thought it would have an oriental flair, but it had more of an italian herb flavor that was wonderful and looked great on the plate!

I found this recipe about 3 years ago and have used it to feed my family as well as a 50 person BBQ. I have used it with kabobs and breasts. I use olive oil instead of the suggested vegetable oil but if you stick with the main ingredients you will be fine. MOST IMPORTANT is the longer you marinade the better!!! I prefer it to be overnight so the flavor is full and completely through the meat. you can also do with fish just don't marinade longer than 4 hours as the acids in the soy and lemon will begin to cook the fish. 

LOVE IT!!!!

This was pretty good.  I marinated skinless, boneless chicken breasts over night.  I don't have a barbecue so I baked them in a glass dish, in the marinade, at 425 degrees for 30 min.  My chicken was a tad dry.  I probably should have baked 5-10 min. less.  I think this would've tasted better if I'd had a barbecue to use.  The recipe does not make much marinade and I barely had enough to cover 2 chicken breasts.  The lemon flavor really came through.  I'll make this again.

Excellent marinade!  I made kabobs with chicken tenders, cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, and sliced corn cobs.  I marinated for about 4 hours and then basted on the grill.  I could see using this marinade for lots of things...Great recipe!

BEST ever! I have made this a few times now, and it is always requested when we have cook-outs. You do have to watch the soy sauce though, for salt content. You certainly don't want to add more salt to the recipe. Totally yummy!

HOLY MOLY!! My family loves chicken, but I've been running out of new ideas of how to make it.  We planned a BBQ this past weekend and I tried this since it got such great reviews and WOW!!  Everyone loved it!  I was hoping there would be leftovers so I could munch on it myself for the next few days, but no way.  Everyone gobbled it up like they haven't eaten for months!  Guess I'll have to make another batch!  Thanks for the great recipe.

I found this recipe to have a nice flavour however it was too salty. I marinated the chicken for 24 hours so next time I will either marinate it for 12 hours only or reduce the amount of soy sauce and increase the wine & lemon juice. It has potential to be great but isn't there yet!

i never find good marinade recipes (or store-bought!), so i give this 5 stars. it's great! next time i'll add more ginger/less soy to see what happens, because i think you could really experiment with this. i'll also double the recipe because i only used two pounds of chicken and had barely enough marinade. i grilled the chicken on skewers with pineapple chunks and it was perfect. the chicken stays really tender for some reason, even if it's crisp outside. served with goya red beans and rice (substitite coconut milk for half of the water it calls for)and peas. a keeper! would be good with beef too, i'm sure.

Omigosh, this is good!  I was a little leery of the combination of marinade ingredients, but this was EXcellent.  The chicken was so flavorful and so tender.  I used olive oil instead of veg oil, low-sodium soy sauce, and I only made 4 chicken breasts, but made the full amount of marinade and it was just the right amount; only marinated it for about 5 hours.  Thank you so much, Laura!  Great recipe!

Very good and juicy. I marinated overnight which I recommend. I was out of onion powder and used a shallot instead of the garlic.

Due to unexpected circumstances, my chicken strips marinated for two full days, but we really liked them.  I recommend grilling them as the recipe states. Tasty!

this recipe is very easy..chicken was very moist and tender. I omitted the oil to make it low fat. I'm only giving this a four because although it did have flavor it mostly tasted like soy sauce.prob would make again with less soy sauce.

This marinade was pretty good, but not as good as I expected after reading all the reviews.  I made this with boneless skinless chicken tenders and made extras to have for leftovers.  It is a good marinade that would be good for many different meals, like fajitas, sandwiches, etc.  Also great to go along with rice, and good for eating healthy.

What an absolute 'sleeper' this marinade is.  I wasn't impressed while I was pulling together the ingredients, but my goodness, this marinade was an absolute keeper.  Good mix of flavors that provided the perfect complement to one another.  This one is going into the box of recipes that everyone always asks for! Thanks Laura - the credit is all yours!  :)

Made this tonight as is and it was great, the marinade was simple to throw together. I had it with sauteed creminin mushrooms, a package of grilled vegetable which was all tossed to homemade pasta and a mushroom alfredo sauce. My hubby who is picky said he LOVED IT and could eat it every day and be happy. So it is a keeper for sure. Thanks for sharing

Although the chicken was quite moist, I found the taste of soy just a little too overwhelming (and I used a "lite" soy sauce).

Finally got around to trying this recipe out, and I'm really sorry I waited so long. The combination of flavors is not something you would expect: hints of asian with a healthy dose of Italian-style seasonings. The result was really teriffic, however. 

As per the instructions, I sliced the chicken into strips before marinating. My general rule for marinating is 24-hours, but I was only able to let it go for about 8 hours this time. It still turned out tasty and juicy, and we'll be adding this one to our list of standard chicken preparations.

This was an excellent recipe.  We used chicken legs instead of breasts and it turned out great.  We also added some hot sauce, some fresh thyme, and some red pepper.  We also didnt have any wine so we used beer instead and it was excellent.

I used low sodium soy sauce and only 1/8 tsp. of ginger powder.  Instead of Italian seasoning, I substituted some parsley flakes, basil seasoning, garlic powder & garlic powder.  I also cut the chicken into cubes, instead of strips, for the shish-ka-bob. I marinated the chicken but did not reuse the marinade for any basting.  Even though the directions said to boil the marinade, I didn't want to reuse the marinade that the raw chicken had been in.  I've read some articles saying you shouldn't baste or glaze foods with a marinade that was used with raw food. One Internet site though did say that you could reuse a marinade; it said that any leftover sauce used for marinating must be boiled 5 to 7 minutes before basting or dipping.  Anyway, the chicken still was flavorful without the basting step.

This is very good!  Partially baked chicken on skewers and then marinated them in this over night.  I have baked mine (b/c I had to make alot for a party and that was the easiest), but love them grilled, too. I make extra marinade for when serving from a chafer to help keep them moist.

ONE thing! DONT use too much fresh grated ginger root! ;) Mine was VERY strong, and overpowering! I marinaded mine for well overnight +1/4 eve, so maybe that was it too. THe chicken sure was brown from marinading it so long!
I served it over steamed rice w/ bell peppers/brocco, and also baked it.

This was very tasty, even tho I didn't get to actually marinate... I just mixed a double portion up in a glass pan, placed the chicken strips in, and baked at 375 degrees for a half hour. I adjusted the taste to fit my family's preference, in our case more lemon was all we needed (but we are big soy sauce fans.) For my chicken strip dippers, I threw some of the strips into a fry pan and crisped the outsides for just a minute, and accompanied them with tater tots. As for the rest of us, we just served over rice and it was delish! The little bit of leftovers were even more amazing the next day as the rice soaked up the sauce wonderfully.  Next time I'll try to marinate n grill, n thicken remaining marinade w/ cornstarch slurry... and there WILL be a next time:)

SUPER Easy, very tasty and incredibly versatile. I was short on time so threw some chicken breasts in this marinade (I didn't measure and didn't have white wine) for a few hours then pounded out to about a1/2" and cooked at 400 for 15min. Sprinkled the paprika on top and broiled a few more. The paprika does take it up a notch. I served with sauteed spinach (my kids are addicted to this stuff and eat a ton. Served with garlic bread on this side. So easy how could I not love it? =)

I really thought we'd love this recipe but we just didn't.  It was fine but not amazing.  I'll make it one more time before removing it from my recipe file.

I let my chicken marinade over night, it was excellent. The chicken was so tender, this is my favorite chicken recipe so far.  My only problem was, I cut the recipe to 2 servings and I didn't have any marinade left for the grill so I just made some more up.  It was awesome. Thanks for the recipe.

AWESOME!! We used slightly less than 1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce and extra garlic, marinated 5 hours, skipped the skewers and cooked them on a vegetable rack on the grill. These delightfully seasoned, tender pieces of chicken will be a summer staple at our house.

I was the toast of the BBQ with these tasty skewers! My husband still talks about them, and begs me to make them again. A must marinade for summer cookouts. I have also used it to marinate chunks of zucchini, summer squash, and bell peppers - tastes great skewered on the grill or done in the broiler.

I have made this sooooo many times now.  I would buy about 8 - 10 chicken breasts and cook them all, whole.  I would store them in zip lock bags and use either cold on salads or hot right off the grill.  VERY GOOD!!!

This recipe got my attention with the ingredients and great reviews. I did not have
White wine so I used dry sherry. I also added brown sugar and crushed red pepper. I made kabobs and they were moist and very good.

I wasn't able to grill this as I had planned due to some unexpected rain so I had to bake this in the oven.  It had a nice flavor but was a bit too salty.  I would like to make this again and reduce the amount of soy sauce and next time cook it on the grill.

Tasty, but average.  I marinated over night, removed chicken from the marinade, and baked it in a 425 F oven.  I'm sure it would have been tastier grilled.  If I make this again, I will add 1 tsp. poultry seasoning, greek style yogurt, 1 tbsp. more lemon juice, an additional clove of garlic, and some heat.  I will also bake it in the marinade.  It was too mild, but the blend of asian and meditaranean (sp?) flavors was nice.

This was very yummy! I just threw the chicken with the marinade in a pan and cooked it that way. This marinade is yummy. Use some leftover marinade and put it over rice, YUM!

This was very easy to throw together.  It really keeps the chicken moist and gives it a lot of flavor, even on an electric grill.

This is my all time favorite chicken marinade. I found it on All Recipes a long time ago and have used it ever since plus shared it with friends and family. I skip the skewers and just marinade the chicken breasts and put them on the bbq. Absolutely delicious. Thank you for sharing!

I thought this was just ok, my husband wasn't crazy about it.  I, too made kabobs with the chicken.  The flavor was good, but it really didn't seem to have very much flavor, which was surprising.  I marinated it for 4 hours.  Usually I shy away from marinating chicken overnight (especially a marinade containing lemon juice) as it seems to break down the chicken too much, but this definitely needs to marinate overnight.  I used ground ginger, replaced the Italian seasoning with basil & oregano (didn't have Italian seasoning), olive oil and lite soy sauce.  It was very tender and I will make it again, but will let it soak overnight next time.

this recipe has become a standard for grilling at my house.  We call it "chicken on a stick". I've made it many,many times and i still follow the recipe as written.  the kids love it, the adults love it.  I could never skip out on making this, as it would be sorely missed by friends and family. Wonderful recipe - great combinations of flavors - don't leave anything out.  You can't go wrong!  Best to marinade overnight, but sometimes just an hour or two will do in a pinch.

Very good.  Only let chicken marinate for a few hours so the flavor wasn't very strong but still quite good.  Easy to make and grills nicely.  Will definitely make again but marinate overnight as Courtney suggests.

Tasty and easy to put together if you have these ingredients in your pantry. I use jars of minced garlic and ginger instead of fresh. I also used lime because I had it left over from another recipe and it was fine. Exactly what I was looking for.

this was very tasty despite not having grilled it.. i came home starving so i asked bf to pan fry the chicken strips in the marinade.. it was great over rice.. i didn't want to open up the wine for only 3 T's worth so i just used white wine vinegar.. we like pungent so it worked for us.. also used light soy sauce but regular would have been fine.. ty for the recipe

We had this last night and it was a *hit*! I, like some other reviewers, thought it would have more of an Asian type taste with the soy sauce but it really didn't at all. Just a nice, Italian seasoned taste. I marinated overnight and grilled it - the chicken was incredibly tender. This will definitely be making an appearance here again!

Too salty, and I didn't even marinated for 24 hrs like some.  I don't think the flavor pay off was all that amazing either.

Outstanding flavor and very simple to make. Added mushrooms, cherry tomatoes and canned potatoes to the skewers. The whole family loved it.

By far the best chicken marinade I have ever tried!  I doubled the listed quantity of wine so the soy sauce would be thinned out more, leaned heavier on the oregano in the Italian spices, then made a double batch for 8 boneless/skinless chicken breasts and 5 boneless/skinless thighs.  Poked the meat deeply all over with a fork and placed in a large baggie in marinade for 2 FULL DAYS before grilling it!  Chicken was full of flavor all the way through, tender and juicy!  All family members loved it!!!!

This was amazing! I only marinated for about the 3 hour minimum and still it had lots of flavor. I grilled slowly to make sure it didn't dry out by overcooking. Super easy and one I'll be using a lot this summer.

We give this one a 5+ .....it was delicious! Used olive oil instead of veg oil and dried ground ginger instead of fresh since I had no fresh on hand. I also let the chicken chunks marinate for 24 hours in a zip lock bag. Skewered and grilled tonight....very moist and very flavorful. Will most definately make again...thanks!

I found this to be a great addition to my family meal planning.  I use less salt, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with the original recipe.  Just wonderful!!!  :-)
Thanks, for sharing!!

Really, really good! The flavors are amazing! I'm sure it could be varied by the type of wine you use. I used a sweeter white. I also added a little thyme to the recipe. I combined all the ingredients for 8 breasts but only had 4 and thought I needed more marinade, so I added a bit more wine, lemon juice and soy sauce (less sodium kind). You can use the remaining marinade too. Bring to a boil on the stove and then brush on the chicken on the grill or use as a dipping sauce. The lemon juice really helps to make the chicken tender. I cut mine into cubes (frozen is easier to cut for me) then put on skewers (after marinating in a bag) along with peppers and onions. 
Use a bag for the chicken to marinate in so you can flip it throughout the day so it gets evenly coated. I lay mine on a dish in case the bag leaks.

I probably wouldn't use this recipe again.  I think I was expecting much more from all the great reviews.  Had a funny taste to it that I can't place, but I didn't care for that lingering aftertaste.  My husband liked this chicken more than the rest of us.

It's "THE" chicken recipe for us. Just tried it again last night.  I don't change a thing.  I've tried different grilled chicken recipes but this is still the winner since I came across it 3 yrs ago.  Husband agrees it's the best out of the many recipes I've tried. Kids love it too. Very tasty and super easy. Ingredients are already in the cupboard/fridge. The only thing I need to get is just the wings. Thanks!!!

Oh my goodness! These were so moist and tender. Very flavorful. The only things I changed (b/c it was what I had on hand) was rice vinegar in place of the wine and 1/4 tsp dry ginger instead of the fresh. Served with lightly buttered white rice, mixed veggies and a salad. Will definitely make again.

This was just delicious! I subbed rosemary for the Italian seasoning, and like LadyJayPee, I used low-sodium soy sauce and olive oil. We sliced it for our chicken caesar salad, and we were raving about the flavor. Great recipe!

Very tasty chicken recipe!  I make the marinade on Sunday morning, let the chicken sit all day and then cook it on my indoor grill Sunday night.  The chicken is delicious all week served over salad for a healthy & zesty lunch at work.

I've tried many marinade recipes for chicken, but this is my favorite.  Our family has enjoyed it many, many times and will continue to do so. I went to print it for my aunt and couldn't find the recipe in my recipe box but, to my surprise, the name was changed! 
Thanks for sharing this one Laura!

I made this for a dinner party at my in-laws, it turned out soooooo goooooooood. I liked that the recipe called to cut the chicken into strips, more  pieces had flavor instead of a whole breast. It was marinating for 6 hours and it was just perfect. Served it with rice and an oritental version of brocoli slaw.

This is great!  So easy to throw together and you don't have to do anything but throw it on the grill when you get home from work!  The chicken turned out VERY tender.  The great thing about this recipe is that it can be altered according to likes and dis-likes - I'm going to try adding some crushed red pepper flakes for a little more heat next time!  YUMMY!

My whole family enjoyed this marinade.  I let it marinade overnight and the chicken was very flavorful.  Even the leftovers tasted great.  I highly recommend this one.

My husband and I really liked this!!  Made it when friends came over and they really liked it as well.  Definately marinade over night if you can, way better taste.  Will use this again.

I used bone-in skinless thighs for this and marinated them overnight.  The chicken had a very good taste, but it wasn't like marinated chicken--the flavor didn't sink it.  Maybe it was due to using bone-in pieces.  I'll try it again with chicken tenders.

This was an excellent marinade for chicken skewers! I substituted red vinegar for wine, and it turned out great. I've made it a few times and found out the longer it marinates the better, 12 hours plus makes it mouth-watering.

I recently prepared this for a party of about 100 guests-marinating the meat overnight in pans and bowls (nearly filled my extra refrigerator). I borrowed a couple additional gas grills, so the grilling time was not overwhelming. Grilled all the meat a few hours prior to the party and kept it warm so I could mingle and enjoy the party. Served with grilled mushrooms and bellpeppers and some white sangria, the party was a GREAT success! Like some other reviewers indicated, I had to increase the amount of marinade a bit to cover all the chicken. I will use this often!

This is really a great recipe.You need to multiply the marinade ingredients by four for a single recipe and by six for a double recipe to have enough marinade to boil for basting while grilling.  We are making this for the Fourth of July and this our third time for the recipe. You only need a few minutes on the grill. Meat can dry out quickly.

I made this for dinner tonight using chicken breasts.  My whole picky family thought it was good (I nearly fainted when my daughter said she loved it!).  I left out the wine since I didn't have any and used a pinch of dried ginger b/c I didn't have any fresh ginger root.  Very good!

Did not care for this.  Maybe my bottled squeeze ginger was too strong but it overpowered the flavor.  Planning to dice up the leftovers in an Asian stir fry.  That should be good!

Made this for a dinner for my mother in law. We were all disappointed in how little flavor there was. Would add more spices and maybe let sit overnight not just 6 hours. Will try one more time before I give up.

This is literally my kids' favorite seasoning for any kind of meat. Been using it for years. We use it on pork chops all the time too, and double the recipe so we have some to cook down into a sauce. We have served it to guests and had them fight (good-naturedly) over the last few drops of sauce.  We made a recipe book of the boys' favorites to give to their step-mom for her first  Christmas with them, and they told me to write down a lot of other things but to NEVER EVER give her this one because it is our special secret recipe.  LOL

Delicious! I used low sodium soy sauce and let it marinade over 24 hours. I cooked the chicken breast halves (instead of skewering) and found them to be perfect! I have also used this chicken in other recipes to add flavor.

this is a great marinade. I will for sure make this again. The only thing I did was use low sodium soy sauce. To me if someone changes the actual recipe by adding different items then it is not the same recipe. Use your changes and register a new recipe of your own. This recipe is great the way it is.

Delicious and easy recipe! I started marinating the chicken in the morning, for a total time of approx 10 hours. Baked instead of grilled - 425F for only 15 minutes (I think the chicken started cooking during the day with the acidity of the marinade). Served on a simple salad of spinach, cherry tomatoes, avocado and quinoa. Will definitely make again!

Delicious flavor. I was only cooking for 2, so I halved the amount of chicken and instead cut an onion into eighths and a red bell pepper into chunks and threw it in the marinade with the chicken. It marinated for a day and a half and then I made kabobs. Was very good!

Loved this! I took all the same seasonings and used for whole chicken in crock pot. I kept basting every hour. Wonderful flavor!!! Juices that resulted better suited to au jus rather than gravy ...which means I can count this as healthy since not loaded with fat!!

9/25 I had to review this again. I made this with a turkey breast and only substituted chicken broth for the soy sauce. Fabulous!

It was good.  A little bit different from the usual soy marinate.  Did keep the chicken super moist. Marinated about eight hours.  I will try it again and marinate overnight to see if I can achieve more flavor.

I had some white wine in the fridge that was no longer so good to drink. Rather than throw it out, my boyfriend suggested making a marinade with it. I ran across this recipe, and gave it a shot even though I was missing Italian seasoning, onion powder and ginger. Instead, I used the equivalent amount of a ginger citrus spice I had. It was quite good, and I'm now eager to make the recipe with all the right ingredients.

I didn't have white wine or lemon juice on hand, so I left them out, but this was still a delicious marinade! I will definitely make this one again.

I did this with drumsticks and chicken breasts.  I baked the legs for my daughter and her dinner guest and grilled the breasts. Very nice flavor; super marinade for chicken.  I'll definitely make this again.  (AND, the kids loved it!)

Made as written and marinated overnight. This was tasty enough, but didn't stand out from any other chicken marinade. I used low-sodium soy sauce, and still found this to be a tad salty. Probably won't use this recipe again.

One of our favorite recipes. I have used this recipe for years.  I double the marinade and use boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  I also use olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and crushed (from jar)or powdered ginger. I always marinate the chicken as long as I can. I usually make extra and use the leftover chicken for fajitas, quesadillas or grilled chicken salad.

This is my go to chicken recipe when I need a dinner with little preparation.  I omit the ginger (personal preference, not a ginger fan), and use garlic powder in place of the crushed only because it's a time saver. Marinate overnight and the next night grill chicken breasts skipping the skewers.  The smell while it's on the grill will make your mouth water, and of course the best part, tastes great.  Goes well with any side.

I can't say for sure why I wasn't impressed. It was good, not great. The boys ate it up and I finished mine but I wouldn't make it again.

This is my most FAVORITE chicken marinade ever! Very tasty! You can use this marinade for a variety of things!  I used this to make orange chicken and chicken lettuce wraps and they turned out SPECTACULAR.  This is definitely a keeper.

First recipe that I have passed to my Mother, who says it is great too.Smells like &*^^&% when in bag- don’t judge by the Asian/booze smell!!! I did less garlic  + more wine… THE BEST!!! 
Another FIRST:  First time I thought to myself: “This chicken tastes better than a steak (or fill in your own fave meat). “

Good recipe, everyone liked the flavor. Though, I grilled halved chicken breasts and it was a bit dry when fully cooked. Next time, I'll try the skewers.

I skewered the marinated chicken with onions and broiled them because I don't have a grill. The ginger was a bit overpowering to me but the marinade kept the chicken moist. Next time I think I'll use less ginger and I'll like them much better.

Unbelievable!!! All i can tell you is that my mouth is still watering. Today i took a break and got up extremely late. It wasn't until the last minute that i decided to try this recipe, so i didn't have much time to let my chicken marinate. Didn't have any onion powder, added a little bit more wine and used ground ginger instead of fresh ginger. Let sit for almost 2 hours. Wow!! what a burst of flavors in your mouth!! i want my family to try this, so next time i think i'll be making "ramjam pork", since all in my house have a dislike for chicken... weird people!! ;(  lol. Thank you so much Laura!! :D

This was just okay probably because I broiled it instead of grilling the chicken.  However, I have tried other marinades that were much tastier.

Very good. I put it all together last night and grilled the chicken today for lunch. Served it with avacado. Will make again, it was nice and easy to put the marinade together. Plus no clean up, just used a ziploc bag!

This was a very good marinade for chicken.  The only thing was that when I brought the marinade to a boil on the stove to baste the chicken with, it turned into this gel-like goop.  I must have messed up somewhere?  Anyways, it was still good without basting and my kids loved eating it off the skewers!  :o)

This was excellent!  I made it with steaks, and only let them marinate for a half hour, then I made them on the George Foreman grill.  YUMMY

After reading all the great reviews I was excited to try this recipe. Sorry to say that we didn't enjoy it that much. We don't know what the big deal is. We've found better recipes on this site. On to the next one....

I didn't care for this.  My husband thought it was okay, but he'll eat just about anything I cook.  It seems like such a strange combination of ingredients.  I wouldn't make this again.

This was a great marinade. I cooked the chicken on my George Forman grill, after I let it marinate over night. Very tender, and the kids loved it.

This is a very good marinade. Even my 13-year-old (who hates grilled chicken and almost everything else) ate 2 whole chicken strips. I served this tonight with a spinach/pasta/chickpea salad (from this site) and bread. It made a wonderful meal!

Good flavors, not spicy enough for us.  I grilled the chicken breasts whole.  Maybe should marinate longer.

I marinated over night- too intense for my husband but he is the most finicky eater I know!
For him I would marinate a shorter time--for me--I thought it was terrific!A+

We love this recipe.  It's easy to make and very tasty without being overpowering.  We tried it for the first time a few weeks ago and have made it several times since then.  I usually triple the recipe so there is enough to use for basting.  It's also great on pork chops

This recipe was a hit! My boyfriend said it was the most tender chicken he ever had. I had some leftover chicken (raw) which I marinated and put in the freezer and used at a later time - still great. I threaded veggies like mushrooms, peppers and zucchini along with the chicken and it was excellent.

Yummy!! Didn't add wine though. We loved that distinct zing of the ginger. Used on boneless skinless thighs. We be making again often.

This was an excellent marinade.  Chicken was full of flavor and even my very picky 11 year old son loved it.

This is by far the best chicken marinade I have tasted.  I have copied this recipe for many friends who have passed the recipe on to others.  The chicken is incredibly moist and flavorful.

We loved this recipe!  It was super easy to make and the chicken was SOOO tender and tasty.  Even my 18 month old ate the chicken - a food she doesn't eat.  We can see ourselves using it all summer!  The only substitution we made was a little bit of ginger powder instead of the fresh ginger and it was yummy.

This is an excellent recipie,thanks Laura. I had 2 large unsplit chicken breasts, so I doubled the recipie. I had everything but the fresh ginger. I marinated the breasts overnight and baked them at 350 for 30 minutes in the marinade covered and 30 minutes uncovered. It was tender, juicy, and delicious.This recipie is definitely a keeper. Next time I will try it on the grill. Thanks again.

I usually have trouble with chicken getting tough on the grill or losing its flavor to the charcoals.  Not so with this recipe!  It was succulent and very tasty.  The soy and lemon were forthright, but the ginger, garlic, and Italian seasoning sing through. It was lovely...a definite repeat!

Very simple and delicious chicken. I mixed up the marinade in the morning made a pasta salad and dinner was practically done!  Everyone in the family enjoyed it.  I made a couple of extra breasts and sliced them up in a salad for lunch   for my teenage daughter to take to school. It was the best salad she said.

I made this without the ginger because I was out of it and it was still delicious.  This will become my standard marinade for chicken--I may try it with pork tenderloin as well. Mmmmm.

This recipe is wonderful.  I have twin toddler girls who can be somewhat picky, especially with chicken.  They loved it.  Even had seconds!

It was really easy and tasty.  I had everything in my kitchen already (except I had to run out for the ginger) and I put it all together in less than 5 minutes (including cleaning and trimming the chicken breasts).  I'll definitely use this again.

This gave us another great way to eat chicken.  It's the fresh ginger that really makes this marinate special.  I made extra for salad the next day...I like it even better cold!

Whether marinated overnight or just for a few hours, the chicken is very flavorful and ready when you need it to be.  Quick, easy, and tastes great!!
