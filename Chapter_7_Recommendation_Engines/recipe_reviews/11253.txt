I grew up on this too and was so happy to find the recipe again.  Put waxed paper in the pan before spreading out the cookies, and there is almost ZERO cleanup (only have to wash the saucepan where you cooked and mixed the ingredients).  AWESOME!

We are unable to eat peanuts so this snack is a sure winner.  It takes care of our craving for peanut brittle.  The only change I made was to use Frosted Flakes and decrease the sugar to a half cup.  It is absolutely delicious!

This is a fabulous recipe.  I used some other flake cereal that I had and don't like eating plain--now it tastes great.  I also added a few handfuls of chocolate chips just before the peanut butter.  My husband thinks it is great too!

I made this as part of my recent Christmas gift to co-workers, it got rave reviews.  They are great, easy to make, very tasty.  Will definitely be part of my "candy" making every Christmas.  Thank you.

Very easy and very nummy! Was going to take just a wee taste while waiting for it to cool, and now a whole 'row' is gone from the pan!
I really like rice krispie cereal, so used 6 cups of corn flakes and 2 1/2 c Rice Krispies....VERY tasty! I did find that it cools, and therefore hardens, very quickly in the bowl, before getting it into the pan. ...so I just microwaved it for a minute and it softened enough to get into the pan easily. I also found that it is easiest to pat down with clean fingers. Amazingly, this is not sticky to your hands, thp' ot does act like glue on a spoon.
Try it, you'll love it! Thanks for a new taste treat!

This was very good and easy! Tastes just like the real stuff except no messing around with that dran candy thremometer.  Two suggestions: 1. Next time I will use a much lareger pan so I can press it thin, this time it was thinker and you almost cracked a tooth eating it right out of the fridge.  2. It would be great if you could add just a touch of salt so you could have the sweetness off the peanut butter and corn syrup and saltiness of the peanut butter also.

My mom used this same type of recipe when I was growing up, however she made it in drop style clusters. My kids have never had them before and was glad that some one recommended me this recipe. It's just what I remembered but however next time I will make them drop style, they were very hard to cut through. But oh so good to eat. My kide enjoyed. I heated up a square of white chocolate almond bark and drizzled over the top to give it a pretty look. Thanks Tammee.

These were so chewy it made my jaw hurt eating them.  The flavor was OK and they're easy enough to make, but I recommend making them in a larger pan so they're not so thick and will be easier to eat.

This was really good. I put the cornflakes in the pan and then poured the syrup over it and stirred. Saves on cleanup. I'll definitely be making this at Christmas time.

This is a nice tasty treat. Sort of a cross between a cereal bar and peanut butter candy. Very sweet and delicious.

Not bad, but I probably won't make this again.  I'm not sure where this title came from, but this is nothing like peanut brittle.

Everyone i made this for, including the kids, loved it.  It was quick, using waxed paper to line the pan made cleanup a cinch, and one square in my diet was a yummy low point treat.

My step mom loves this stuff!! She can't eat real peanut brittle because of her teeth. I don't know how much it really compares to real peanut brittle, but who cares! This is yummy!! Just don't cook the sugar and corn syrup to long or it will be hard.I used generic cornflakes to cut down on cost and you can't tell. My husband calls it Oakey Peanut Brittle.

Made this tonight.  It turned out delicious.  I didn't have any problems with it hardening as I added the peanut butter right after the sugar melted.  I also added a TBLS. of salt free butter, then mixed with flakes poured into 2, 9x13 glass baking dishes, pressed, and put a "light" sprinkling of sea salt on top! In half the batch I added some chocolate chips, very good.

A quick treat to eat when you want something sweet, but don't want to sabotage your diet. Did 1/2 Splenda, 1/2 sugar, and used a fiber cereal instead of cornflakes - turned out great! Will make again!

Eh, these are ok.  They pretty much taste just like their ingredients...corn syrup and sugar.  They definitely don't taste anything like peanut brittle if that's the taste you are going for.  I prefer the Special K version of these called "Scotcheroos" or "Special K Bars".  Much more flavor.

Sampled some shortly after making it, while still moist. Found it to be delightful for a peanut butter bar. I did the error of refrigerating it, and from chewy it became a true jaw braker! I bent a solid knife trying to get the sqares out of the pan!  To facilitate extraction (!), I put the pan in hot water which somewhat helped.  
Nonetheless, a taste kids love! It didn`t last long regardless of its consistency!

I`ll likely do it again with the kids, but will keep at room temperature in air tight containers.

Not a 5 star recipe to me.  I do not think that it tastes at all like peanut brittle.  (I had made peanut brittle along with this, so I had it nearby to compare.)  To me, it tastes like cornflakes and peanut butter.  Even my kids were not bowled over by this one.  Sorry!

My grandma used to make this and it is excellent.  Thanks for giving me a slice of my childhood back.  It doesn't taste anything like peanut brittle to me, but it is a wonderful treat.

Okay, I must of cooked the sugar and the cornsyrup too long, because the end result was a very hard square. The flavour was wonderful and I can see how it could be really good.  I just wasn't sure when the sugar was dissolved. I actually skinned my knuckle and drew blood when trying to cut these. I'm sure it was my mistake!! On the other hand, my husband ate the whole thing!

I grew up on these treats also.  Since I hate peanut butter the fact that I love these must give some indication as to how good these are.

Great recipe...I am always looking for ways to use up the last handful of several kinds of cereal...I find that if I coat ANYTHING in marshmallows, or a syrup like this, the kids eat it up! Worked with shreddies, corn flakes, rice krispies and multi-grain cheerios - I just mixed it all together to make 8 cups. Good stuff!

I don't know what exactly I did, but the moment I tried to cut these, they fell apart.  Back into flakes.  Tasted good, though!  Very sweet, although I expected that from the corn syrup.  I didn't use any sugar since I had frosted flakes--maybe that was my problem?  Who knows . . . anyway, bf really likes them and is eating them by the handful.  Good thing, since they all fell apart!  Thanks for the recipe!

I've made a similar recipe- using 1/2 c brown sugar and a cup of chocolate chips added @ the end. 
Once you had the chocolate, you can't go back.

I really like this recipe. It's really simple to make, and fun for kids. I used frosted flakes instead of the corn flakes which worked just as good, and I also used peanut butter crunch cereal in it too && it turned out great...everyone loves it.

So easy and inexpensive to make. Everyone loved this dessert! My bf's g'ma was excited because she can no longer eat real peanut brittle and this tasted close enough for her. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is OK, but certainly nothing special.  It does not taste at all like peanut brittle to me.

This is an awesome recipe! It’s as easy as Rice Crispy treats, but with a wonderful, peanut butter flavor. My mother made it when I was a kid and I’m so glad I found the recipe.  My kids love it, too.

Used to make these growing up. We called them PBCF (peanut butter corn flake) cookies. My recipe calls for one teaspoon of vanilla added just before the corn flakes; otherwise the ingredients are identical. One thing we did differently was to drop them by heaping tablespoons onto wax paper lined baking sheets and we would keep them in the refrigerator. Mom would try to keep some in the freezer in case we had surprise company. My great grandmother and grandmother also made these. This has always been a family favorite!

Tasted good but with a cup of corn syrup and a cup of sugar it is very rich. Finished product was also very hard on the teeth (hard to chew). Worth a shot!

My family loves these! They are really good and they do taste like peanut brittle. I like the fact that they are easy and fast to make, and only have a few ingredients that you usually keep on hand. Great for kids!
