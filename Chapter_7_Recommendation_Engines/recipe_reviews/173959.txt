Delicious! I had to adjust the recipe though, since I am vegetarian. I used tofu instead of pork, marinating it according to the recipe, and I omitted the shrimps. It was easy to do, not too long and very flavorful. There's a lot of veggie and meat compared to the noodles, but I liked it that way. Do not omit the 5 spice powder: it really make the dish. If you don't have any, you can make your own by grinding 2 star anise with 1/2 tsp whole fennel seeds and 1/2 tsp whole cloves, then adding 1 tsp ground cinnamon and 1/4 tsp pepper. One last thing: it makes four generous servings, but it's so good that you may find yourself eating more than you should! Thanks Tina, I'll make it again.

I've made this a couple of times,with different noodles. rice and mung bean, I like the rice better thicker. with that said you can play with it,adding as much or as little stuff you like. Don't forget the dried shrimp though it is critical. I also made with 8 oz noodles and 6 oz noodles unless you really really like alot of noodles use the 6 oz. It's hard to mix in the noodles but be patient and gentle

I finally made this after having it in my recipe box forever. I agree that the five-spice powder makes the dish. I had issues with my noodles. After soaking for 10 minutes they were still crunchy. So I dont know if the rice noodles I bought were strange or something. I tried soaking them in hot water for 15 minutes and they were still pretty "el dente". I did like this dish, it makes A LOT. I added some siracha for some heat. Thanks for a great recipe :)

This is the only and best tsao mi fun dish I've found on the web. I made it for dinner tonight and it was soooo good. And I am Taiwanese. I LOVE five spice powder! And I do agree it should be for 6 servings instead of 4.

Awesome recipe! Just don't use too much five spice or dried shrimp, as they can both overwhelm the dish. Also couldn't find black mushrooms at the asian grocery, so just use regular mushrooms.

My dad loves Mi Fun from the local restraunt so I wanted to try making it for him. (He said if I'd keep making it for him he'd never have to buy it again:) I made a few changes - I like to do my eggs like the egg in egg drop soup instead of the pancake. I also omit all the ingredients involving the pork, skip the mushrooms and use regular shrimp. I use way more cabbage as we all like it. And at the end I add salt, pepper and soy sauce to taste. I'm so happy to now be able to make this myself!!!

Overall a good recipe.  Easy to follow and the taste is pretty authentic.  The only thing that may vary is the amount of time to soak the rice vermicelli.  It really depends on the brand.  The one I used took 30 minutes to soften.

Tasty rice noodle dish!  I found that the noodles seemed a little hard after pan-frying for a little bit, so I added more water and covered to soften the noodles.  Thanks for sharing!

I am Taiwanese and this dish is no-where near what I am used to. It came out a bit too dry, too... Not sure what I missed but one of our 5 kids seemed to like it. So I gave it 2 stars and am willing to try it one more time,,, maybe.

Thanks for the very yummy and authentic recipe. The only thing I did different was to add the water that I soaked the shitake mushrooms in to the vermicelli on the stove to soften noodles and to add flavor.

Something new for me! I used mung bean glass noodles and omitted the pork and cabbage (not a huge fan of cabbage and I just ate pork the day before). I also used regular mushrooms instead of the Chinese black ones, as they are hard to come by in my area without going to an overpriced specialty store. I also threw in some toasted sesame salad dressing.

We need more Taiwanese recipes!! Please post more if you have any!  The dish was delish~ I boiled the noodles instead and then mixed them together... it didn't take that much time. This made me miss the authentic street food from Taiwan soooo much! Thanks for sharing!

Loved it! A Foodie at Central Market advised that 'Chinese Black Mushrooms' are cloud mushrooms or wood ear mushrooms. Also, look for dried shrimp in the Hispanic section, if you can't find it in the Asian section.  I would use fewer noodles and more pork next time. Delicious!

I thought the proportions for the marinade were going to be off, because it seems like an awful lot of soy sauce for so little meat BUT it's added to the rest of the ingredients, and rice noodles soak up a lot of liquid, so it turned out to be ok.

I've actually made this recipe twice before, and it's giving my mom's version a run for her money! This time, I used spaghetti instead of rice noodles (maybe I can lessen the marinade next time for that, because I ended up with a lot of leftover liquid), and shredded my carrots instead of cutting them into matchstick-sized pieces. I also added some fresh woodear mushrooms,  which I sliced thinly, and it was great! I also added some sesame oil at the end, and mixed it together. My mom never made hers with egg, but I like the addition of egg in it! This recipe is a keeper!

Used Olive oil, rice noodles, rice vinegar and brussell sprouts and topped with sesame seeds...left out the mushrooms, bean sprouts and shrimp.  Was still amazing even with those changes.

I used ground chicken instead of pork and baby bok choy instead of cabbage. I also did some other things, like added in dried chiles for spice. Good base recipe that can be modified for taste.

i'm not sure if i can give a true review as i did not follow the recipe 100%.. i added more pork and different veggies and left out the mushrooms and the dried shrimp.. i feel like i can usually alter a recipe a bit (given what i have around the house) without it compromising the dish.. but maybe that's not the case here.. we both didn't care for the end product and found ourselves adding different sauces to make it more palatable.. i'm giving this a 3 seeing as how i didn't follow the recipe exactly.. but it's more like a 2 for me

Ok.. my first time so will try it a second time.  Like others mentioned, soaking noodle is really based on brand used.

I also thought the amount of soya sauce was too much so I did not use the excess while cooking the pork.

Good flavor but the noodles really messed it up.

I soaked the noodles for an hour in cold water before I cooked them. Highly recommend doing that. They came out great.

The sauce was..okay? It left this weird after taste that kind of turned my stomach...  Agree with other reviewers - came out dry. Didn't really care for it.

Made this with beef instead of pork as the hubby doesn't like pork. I personally rate this 3 star as I found the 5 spice overpowering and I didn't like how the vermicelli stuck to itself when it was fried alone in the pan. However, my husband thanked me for the delicious dinner and had 3 helpings, despite the egg which he doesn't like and didn't even notice until his second helping. Will probably make again but cut the 5 spice in half and put everything in the pan when finishing off the vermicelli.

I used rice vinegar instead of rice wine...it was more vinegary than I would have liked as a result. Interesting flavours nonetheless. I did not have the dried shrimp either.

This was great but it said it makes it for 4 but really it makes it for 6.
