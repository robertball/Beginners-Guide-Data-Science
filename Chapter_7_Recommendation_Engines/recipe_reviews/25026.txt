Excellent cookies. I made these for the second time and they were a big hit. Followed the recipe as written, except I added 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and about 2 tablespoons of cherry juice. Drizzled them with melted white chocolate after cooling for a beautiful presentation. Yum!!!

These were delicious. 
However, I found that I had to add a second egg. I made one batch that tasted
great, but the cookies fell to pieces. I had enough of the ingredients so I tried a 
second batch. I usually use large eggs, but I think that I had borrowed a medium
sized ones for the first batch. If you are not using large (or better yet jumbo) eggs,
you might want to use 2.

Substituted dry cherries- worked well. They do NOT flatten out, so how you form them is how they will appear. Pretty tasty- would be best with some semi-sweet chocolate chips.

I loved these, I baked all during the holidays and these were always on my list. I bought the colossal size cherries from SAM'S and COSTCO and cut them in half and placed them on the cookie before baking, it was wonderful the cherries candied during the baking. i also am a presentation freak so i melted some white chocolate put in in one of those ketchup/mustard squeeze containers and drizzled it oner the tops of these cookies, the red, white, and chocolate looked fab. I Have found I needed to add more flour to the  recipe to make the dough less sticky.

These cookies are fantastic!  I used cherry flavored "Craisins" and 1/2 cup white chocolate chips, and the turned out great.  
Do NOT use 2 eggs as a previous reviewer suggested...I tried this the first time I made them, and they went totally flat.

This recipe is easy to prepare and handle, and the cookies are delicious! However, I found that the cherry taste wasn't strong enough, and was overpowered by chocolate. I don't think that the maraschino quantity is wrong - they are just the right amount. But maybe a recipe that used fresh cherries would be more fruity and more to my liking... 
* UPDATE: I tried them the next day, and they were MUCH better! The 2 flavours were much more balanced. So, I change my rating to 5 stars. Thanks for sharing!

I made these for my office cookie swap and based on some of the reviews, I used dried cherries and added white chocolate chips.  They were good, but not the "wow" I was hoping for.  They didn't have a strong chocolate taste or much cherry flavor.  The cookie did stay nice and chewey which I love, so I might try them again with marachino cherries and no white chips!

These are fantastic, so soft, chewy and chocolaty!  I have made these twice, each time with a few slight changes.

First time: I substituted 1/4 c. wheat flour (which couldn't be tasted - I might try using 1/2 c.); cut back the butter to 1 stick (might cut back 2 more Tbsp next time); cut the sugar to 3/4 c.; and omitted the nuts (personal preference).  I also only used 3/4 cup cherries because that's what I got out of a 10 oz. jar, but the boyfriend thought this ended up being the perfect amount of cherries.

Second time: Used all white flour (didn't have wheat on hand), same amount of cherries as last time, 1 stick butter (forgot to cut back as planned), only 2/3 c. sugar, 8 Tbsp cocoa and no nuts.

I think next time I will use 3/4 c. sugar and 8 Tbsp cocoa.  I also might try adding 1 c. semi-sweet chocolate chips (although these are great without them).  These would also be good sprinkled with powdered sugar.

I got 35 cookies using my little cookie scoop (sorry, not sure what size it is).

Five stars on ease to make, I loved the flavor.  I really am ecstatic that I found a use for the random odds and ends I tend to have to toss out like the cocoa powder and cherries. These are a wonderful idea if you need something quick, tasty, and unique.

Delicious cookies.  Since there's no such thing as too much chocolate,IMHO, I added 1 cup of mini morsels instead of the nuts

The texture of the batter was definitely too soft. Next time, I will try to cool it a bit in the fridge before actually dropping in the spoonfuls on the baking sheets. I will see if this also helps to avoid them spreading which is usually caused by a warm butter or too hot of an oven or even the type of cookie sheet used. Beware that if you use a light colored sheet bake them for 10 minutes. With a dark colored sheet bake them for 8 minutes exactly. You can also lower the oven temperature to 325F if using a dark sheet. I also noticed that removing them from the sheet after about 3 minutes helped a bit to avoid excessive spreading. Anyway, I think this recipe has room for improvement on its texture and outcome. I will try again, but be assured that the taste is very  good. My only actual tweak was that I added 1/4c extra of nuts, because I like them a lot.

These were very good. Nice and chocolatey. I did add some of the cherry juice, because the dough was stiff. Just enough to make the dough pliable. Other than that I made the recipe as is and they looked like the picture.  They were delishous.

These cookies need no changes.  I normally don't like maraschino cherries, but I couldn't stop eating these.  Nice texture, not too sweet.

Five star flavor, one star for appearance and ability to hold up.  These tasty like cherry infused brownies!  I did give an extra TBS cocoa, cut the sugar to 3/4 cup, used Butter Crisco, and added some cherry juice to the dough.  Expecting them to stay in the shape I put them on the sheet, I flattened the dough... After 14 minutes in the oven, they were massive.  By that I mean, giant pancakes.  And, centers undercooked, though the edges were glorious.  I'll definitely make these again, just tink with the temp/time, and work on their aesthetic.

These are really good! My only complaint is that they can be a bit too sweet, due to the maraschinos. I've made them a few times already, they're perfect for satisfying a chocolate or cherry craving.
mmmmm

Well, they're in the oven now, so I'll rate the taste in a little bit.  For now  I gave it a three because the batter was SOOOOOO sticky!!   Then I didn't want to make 48 so I changed the servings to 24 and in the end I didn't even make a dozen.  I really think the servings need to be fixed!!!

But after all that trouble, they're worth it!  Wow, they taste great!!!!!

Perhaps the batter trouble I had was my fault.  I didn't have any cocoa powder on hand, so instead of that I added semi-sweet chocolate shavings/small chunks, and omitted the nuts (personal preference).  I also added a couple tsp of cherry juice, which was the sticky-making culprit, but they are so good, I wish I would have made lots lots more!

I bake cookies pretty frequently to take to work, and these are by far my coworkers' favorite!  I typically add about a half-cup of dark chocolate chips to the recipe for an even chocolatier flavor, but these stand pretty well as is!

Fabulous cookies!  I made these for a "girls night" and they were a big hit with everyone.  The only change I made was to add a cup of chocolate chips to the dough.  This recipe could also easily be doubled for a larger gathering.  Loved it!  Thanks!

Finally, a decent cookie combining cherries and cocoa.  I modified this for more of a "kirsch torte" effect: I added 1Tbs cherry brandy, used dark sweet cherries in the batter (chopped & drained), and reserved maraschino cherry halves to press onto the top of the cookie immediately before baking (put at least 3 cherry halves per cookie as the batter will spread).  I added ~1/4 c. flour more to make the batter thick enough (depends on how well your cherries drain).  Delicious!

This is a very chocolately cookie. I used both maraschino cherries and dried cherries as well as adding some of the cherry syrup. We then glazed with white chocolate flavored with some of the cherry juice.  The cookies tasted great but the cherry flavor is not consistent in all cookies. It really depends how much cherry is in that cookie.  We used a scoop to make the cookies uniform and got about two dozen cookies.  If you desire good chocolate cookies with a subtle cherry flavor, this is a great cookie.

Great cookies, fudge-y and chocolate-y and cherry. I made these to use up half a jar of maraschino cherries, but I'd buy cherries to make them again! Since I only had half as many cherries as called for I made a few modifications - added 2 Tbsp of the cherry juice to amp up the flavor and added 1/2 cup chocolate chips. I also thought the amount of sugar looked high compared to other cookie recipes, so I reduced it to 3/4 cup, and the sweetness was perfect. The batter was thick and crumbly, reminded me of brownie batter, but I pressed it together to form the cookies. They didn't spread at all but they did puff up nicely. I baked for 10 mins but probably should have gone 1-2 mins longer.

These cookies flattened out so much I didn't get the cute little balls I was hoping for; nobody was swept over their feet by them... So, nice to have tried it, but not a keeper for me.

These were delicious, much better than I expected.  They were very moist and had just enough chocolate flavor to make them delicious.  They were more like brownies though, good to be eaten right away or does not really keep, it's just a pile of mush.

I thought that these tasted great and were really easy to make, but the dough was soooo sticky.  I don't know if it would ruin the taste to add more flour, but they were almost impossible to drop.  I would try chilling them first to see if that helps.  They took 12 minutes to bake in my oven, but maybe that was because I made them too large?  I did not get 48 cookies out of the recipe.

I used 1 c. coconut, 2 eggs (instead of 1), and dried cherries. In the future, I would use less cocoa and more cherries. With two eggs, cookies flattened out in the oven. There is a sticky glaze on top, though, that I do not like - nor can I pin my finger on...

I tripled this recipe. These are YUMMY cookies. However, when I tripled it, I needed to add an entire cup of flour just so the dough would hold together. So it seems the ratios do not work in large batches. But these were a HIT with the entire family.

I thought this was a really yummy cookie. I used regular sweetened cocoa powder & they still tasted really good. This cookie has kind of a cake like texture & is good for a change of pace.

I didn't use the exact recipe.  Because I'm allergic to walnuts, I added almonds instead (sliced almonds broken into tinier pieces) and also substituted a tiny bit of the vanilla extract for almond extract, which worked out nicely. Would make these again.
