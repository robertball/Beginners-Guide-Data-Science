Very thick and good taste.  However, I used frozen strawberries and frozen banana along with about 1/3 cup of sweetened condensed milk and 1/2 cup of 2% milk to cut down on sugar.

I really like the tanginess from the lemon juice! I used frozen strawberries and bananas. I also used skim milk instead of the condensed milk and added some splenda. Nice and refreshing!

This is very good and easy yet it is also very sweet.
