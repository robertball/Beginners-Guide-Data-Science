I needed to bake something for my son's Elizabethan social studies class project.  We found a reference that these tarts were named for the maids of honour of Queen Elizabeth I.  These tarts were delicious and a big hit with the kids and teacher in my son's class.  I used mini-muffin tins, kept the oven rack at the regular position, and had good results using 10-12 minutes baking time.  Also, since I used the mini-muffin tins, I reduced the amount of jam in each tart, probably to about 1/4 teaspoon.  Wonderful taste and yummy combination!

I made these for a church bake sale and they were a fabulous hit! Amazing taste, I used raspberry jam, blueberry jam, and even lemon curd. All versions were just great.

Wowza, so good! Tastes kind of like a raspberry shortbread cookie in a tartshell. Mmm! I can see that trying different jams would be good too. I cheated and used store bought frozen tart shells so they were super quick and easy.

Tasty and not overly sweet. I used a discovered recipe for dough (involving a great deal of cream cheese, butter, and flower), and substituted rum for the almond extract (because I had nothing else). Also, I used blackberry jam (again, because I had nothing else). Turned out well.

Nice recipe but it is a recipe for mini Bakewell tarts, not Maids of honour which contain curd cheese
