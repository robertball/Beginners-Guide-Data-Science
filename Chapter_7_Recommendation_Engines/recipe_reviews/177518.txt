Very yummy!!  I did make some changes though.  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef to make it a little healthier (next time I may use more than one pound).  I also had to cook it for about 10 minutes in Step 2.  After that, I poured the mixture into a casserole dish, covered it with some salsa, then with some sour cream, and finally I sprinkled some cheddar and mozzarella cheese on top.  Then I popped in under the broiler for just a few minutes until the cheese was melted.  We used the light restaurant-style tortilla chips and they were great.  Both my husband and I loved it!   We'll probably end up getting two or three meals out of it too.  This is definitely going in my recipe box!

This is a good way to get some protein when you are craving nachos!  I added a can of corn kernels to the simmering mixture   and served with sour cream. Make sure you use strong tortilla chips as this is a very hearty mixture.  The scoop shaped ones would probably work best.
There is a lot of food here!  My husband and I ate this for two dinners and still could not finish it!  I'd recommend leaving out the toppings (lettuce etc.) for any part you want to refrigerate for leftovers.

OMG......this one is fantabulous! I sub'd the soup and water for Ketchup and extra spicy Clamato Juice which renders a body of flavor of its own. It was great!...Not too spicy, Not too Hot, but of course these things can always be added if one desires. Don't forget to heat your nacho chips in the oven. It makes them D Lishously crispy. My teens had the dinner of a lifetime with this one.

I followed everything to the core. I found that I had to add a couple extra cups of water because the rice was still not cooked after 10 minutes. After those extra cups of water and an additional 10 or 15 minutes, we were left with edible cooked rice, but not tender like you'd expect with this. It was disappointing, but can easily be fixed next time when I just use a rice cooker to ensure the correct texture and then just mix the two together. Not to shabby :)

These were excellent and everyone loved them.  I made them for my teenage son and several of his friends and they wiped them out!  I made some changes though.  I hate Tomato Soup, so in place of the Tomato Soup and the Instant Rice, I made a box of Zatarain's Spanish Rice with the can of diced tomatos.  I made the rice seperately and then added it to the ground turkey (rather than ground beef) mixture and followed the rest of the recipe.  I added additional toppings on the side for everyone to add as they liked, such as chopped red onion, sliced black olives, and sour cream.  Definitely a hit and I already wrote it into my family cookbook!

This is one of those dishes that looks gross but is very easy & very delicious! I cooked the meat & taco seasoning in a skillet & then cooked the rice, water & tomato soup in my rice cooker & then combined them all together. I added salsa on top & shredded cheese & melted the cheese in the oven on broil for a minute or so. Then we topped with olives & sour cream & ate with tortilla chips. YUM!

As written 3 stars but with these modifications 5 stars.  I used ground turkey and made the rice separately and then added to the meat mixture.  Then I added pinto beans, diced tomatoes, lettuce, olives and cheese and put it in the oven for 10 minutes and broiled it the last few minutes and it turned out amazing!  Very tasty and the whole family loved it!

This was pretty good! I browned and drained the meat before I added the taco seasoning so I didn't pour any off with the fat. Then I added 1 1/2 c water, a can of tomato soup, an 8 oz can of tomato sauce, 1/2 jar of salsa. Then I added 1 cup of regular long grain rice. I let it all simmer covered for about 20 minutes and then stirred it up to get the rice off of the bottom. It was really good! The rice has so much more flavor and texture when you cook it with sauces and there was enough thickened liquid left over to give it a really nice sauce. I served it with lettuce, cheese and red onion. Super yum!

This is a great, easy recipe, but it does need a lot of tweaking. First, the rice will not be cooked in 5 minutes, not even 10. I don't think it had enough liquid. I ended up putting it in a casserole dish, top with cheese and stuck it in the oven for 10 minutes. Then, I served with a sweet & spicy corn salsa, greek yogurt (great, healthy sub for sour cream), and shredded lettuce. Pretty good, easy. It could use some veggies added in the mix, and less rice. I only used 3/4 cup of rice and I think it was a great ratio to the 1 pound of meat. I also ground turkey breast- pretty good meal or heavy snack.

Easy, easy, easy… What more can a person say?  Oh, Yummy!    I had made a few modifications, but nothing so major to detract from the recipe.    First change I used the taco seasoning from http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Taco-Seasoning-I/Detail.aspx  (Ever since I first used that recipe I never buy the packets).  Second change was I cooked the rice in my rice cooker separately, 1-cup rice and 2 cups water.    Third change was I used a cup of habanera salsa that my manager made, and it was perfect!  She uses fresh ingredients straight from her garden.   Will definitely make this again!

Meh.  The dinner was easy to put together and it really did only take 15 minutes, but it was pretty bland.  To spice it up a bit, I added a little bit of chili powder and cayenne pepper.  I'm honestly not sure if I'll make this again.  Maybe if I had kids and needed a quick meal....

This was fantastic! The only change that I made was to not add rice- therefore I added less water.  I also heated some refried beans on the side and added that to my dip.  My husband and I love this recipe!  I'm sure this will be a new favorite of ours.

I am a teenage military spuse and full time college student. Time is evething for me. This recipe was quick and packed a nice spicey punch! I used Great Value's Hot salsa and Old El Paso taco seasoning. My husband is a very light eater but one wifff of my skillet and he piled his plate high. He also HATES leftovers and he fixed HISLEFT another plate for lunch the next day. That says alot! Thank you for sharring this recipe.

This was very yummy. I used a progresso tomato soup, because that was what I had on hand. I also used some leftover brown rice  from a different meal, which absorbed all the liquid. I added black beans to it, and just used cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder and a  little salt in place of the taco seasonings. It was a nice easy dinner. The kids liked it alot.

So easy to make and the left-overs are even better! This is the perfect choice on nights when I get home late and don't have a lot of time to cook. Definitely a keeper!

Very good!!! I used instant rice which cooked within 5 minutes after adding.  I was skeptical, but both husband and I enjoyed this and I will be making this again.  Great Friday night dinner and movie food.

I was very suprised at how good this was.  I added a cup of frozen corn, and left out the picante and lettuce.  You can also sub pasta for the rice and it is delicious.

We loved this recipe. I made this for the first time, and it is a keeper. This is something that worked out perfectly for us, because we are both so busy. We often times don't have time to cook. I made some adjustments to the recipe. I made it more like a casserole in the oven, and I added bacon (which added more fat - but worth it).

I cooked my rice first and added it to my taco meat that I prepared in a cast iron skillet. Then I added a can of corn and Rotel chilis/tomatoes. I put a layer of mexican cheese on top and put the skillet under the broiler, which I won't do again. It made the cheese hard. It was a little spicy for my girls so I smeared sour cream on top and they devoured it. The ingredients really worked to make a hearty nacho meal.

This is good only if you add a variety of topping.  Sour cream is a must.  Super easy, so I will definitely be making again.

This is a really good, quick recipe when you don't have a lot of extra time after work or you don't feel like making traditional, same old tacos. Definitely get the Campbell's brand tomato soup though, I tried Kroger brand and it had a whole different taste.

This was real easy & real good! After reading some reviews, I did cook the rice seperately & then mixed everything together. I had this on top of tortilla chips while my husband & my kids rolled it up in tortillas.

Even better than I thought it would be! I made this with ground turkey instead of beef, other than that, I stuck to the recipe, and was delighted. I may try adding a blob of sour cream next time, and I'd leave the lettuce and fresh tomatoes off of the whole pan if you don't have a lot of people- my boyfriend and I didn't even make it through half of this meal the first night. Good news though- it makes great leftovers!

This was an enjoyable summer meal. The only thing I changed was, after altering it for 2 persons, place a layer of Multi-grain Tostitos chips on the platter 1st, then a layer of the meat sauce, a layer of lettuce, a layer of salsa, cheese & repeated it over until pan was empty. Then I topped it off with sour cream. We had to serve it with a large spoon, but there were no leftovers.
Thanks!

This made really good taco filling. It would be good for hard shell or soft shell taco dinners as well as presented as suggested. I added the seasoning (sorry, a homemade one from this site although I did use Pace salsa!) with everything else after draining off the fat so as not to lose all the flavor. Also topped with a mexican cheese blend instead of plain cheddar. One last thing, this recipe makes much more than 4 servings, unless you have BIG eaters.

This was ok. I thought the rice with nachos was a little odd. By itself (without the chips) I thought it would made a decent Mexican one pot meal. If I were to make this as nachos again, I would leave out the rice.

Made this recently, and the family really enjoyed it. Easy, fast and deliciously filling dinner. I liked adding sour cream to top my portion (I love sour cream so that's just a personal choice). I'm sure guacamole would be great too. Two thumbs up!

I just made this for dinner tonight. I have chrones disease so because of that all of the ingredients I tried to get as mild as possible. I tried it and it was to spicy so then I drownded it with sour cream and it took the spicey down to where I could eat it. The recipe itself is very good and easy to make. As most know mexican is ussualy spicy so if there is anyone reading this that likes this kind of food but has stomach and digestive problems, but can eat milk products, drownd it in sour cream it might help. It did for me.

I doubled the recipe and used the leftovers for tacos the next day. Delicious. I did add light kidney beans for texture. I set out 9 small bowls with the make-your-own toppings including guacamole, sour cream, onions, tomatoes, cheese, lettuce, jalapeno peppers,cilantro, and the chips. It was a delicious, fun, finger food. Will make this again.

Delicious!  After the rice was done (which took a few extra minutes) I put all of it into a large ceramic bowl and topped with the cheese and salsa, then covered in foil and place in oven at 180 until cheese had melted- absolutely wonderful!! Will make again!

Quick and easy...both of my picky eaters ate seconds.  You need the salsa for more spice...VERY filling!  Makes a WHOLE lot more than 4 servings!  My husband and I have lunch for tomorrow plus some.

Super easy to make and my picky daughter had seconds. The cook time is pretty spot on too. I had to defrost the meat in my microwave and I still had dinner on the table in 20 minutes. I didn't put the lettuce, salsa, or cheese in the skillet more served it on the side since my daughter is a cheese monster and the 1 1/2 cups would never have been enough for her. Only change I will make is a bit more taco seasoning.

This was great. But I see no use for the shredded lettuce. It just got in the way. The taste was great. I was skeptical about the rice, but it worked out fine. And very easy to prepare. But next time I will just skip the lettuce. No reason to have it there.

Delicious!  Served more than 4 for us, but even the left overs were tasty.  I substituted turkey for beef and followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  Yummy.

This is good, and my "meat, bread, and cheese only" husband likes it too. It's easy to make. The only reason I did not give it five stars is that there is nothing that makes it really stand out. I will be making it again regularly though I am sure.
I added some re-fried beans to it and put it all except the salsa and lettuce into a casserole dish. Put the chips on a cookie sheet and warmed them both in the oven for 6 mins.

Fast Easy Delicious!!!  I picked up a box of mexican rice and made it while browning the beef. Added a can of diced tomotatoes. Combined the beef and rice, topped with shredded cheese, shredded lettuce, sour cream and guac.  The kids loved scooping the mixture with tortilla chips!!!  Very Yummy

This has become a household favorite. With three guys in the house it disappears quickly. If you prefer a spicier recipe, use a package of hot taco seasoning. I use long grain rice, which will take longer but still turns out great.

30 minutes and 2 extra cups of water later I am still waiting for the rice to cook.  There is also way too much rice relative to 2ground beef.  Depending on the taste, I may try half the amount of rice and cook it first next time.

For as it easy as it is, this is very yummy!  I only used 1/2 lb of ground turkey and added a can of rinsed and drained black beans.  I can definitely see myself making this again for my family.

This was really good. My husband and kids loved it too. I had some leftovers and the next day I made a delicious taco salad. I layered lettuce on the bottom, added the meat/rice mixture, crushed up some tortilla chips, then added the cheese and made a dressing with sour cream and salsa. It was seriously the best taco salad I've had so this recipe is very versatile!

Super easy and super good.  Makes a lot.  I served the toppings on the side which included chopped onions (for my husband).  He ate his like a taco salad by crushing the tortilla chips on top.  Took a little over 5 minutes for the rice to completely cook.  Definitely a do again dinner.

I added a can of refried beans and used zesty orange tomato soup, though I'm not sure what the soup adds because I didn't taste anything tomato-y.  I topped with sour cream, lettuce, and cheese, and used multi-grain scoops chips.  Very delicious and very filling.

I was planning to make this recipe as stated but ended up doing my own thing with this in mind. I made the meat as stated but added a can of Rotel's tomatoes & chiles to it. Instead of making my own rice, I bought Lipton's Spanish Rice- made as directed and then added it to the meat mixture. I also heated up a can of refried beans. I melted the cheese on the chips in the microwave first then added the beans and meat/rice mixture and topped with salsa, taco sauce & sour cream. Absolutely loved it!! It's like making your own Nacho Bellgrande :)

very easy and simple, of course I changed the whole recipe; I did spanish yellow goya rice(1 box) instead of plain white rice,used heinz chilli/ketchup sauce(it comes in like a bottle in ketchup aisle) for a little spice added just a little water to loosen the ketchupy flavor,added corn with cayenne pepper and parsley, and then turned it down low and sprinkled it with garlic powder and sargento's five cheese  and let the cheese melt....so good with the salsa,of course i seperated the meat and salsa for people to add as they liked,it was so much i thought a pound wasnt going to be enough but once u add the rice trust me you can feed at least 5 very hugnry guys off that

I doubled the portions for my large family. Used some leftover tomato sauce instead of the tomato soup and I used brown rice and cooked it before i added it to the ground beef. My family ate it ALL!My picky daughter who claims to not like rice even ate it.  The only thing I will fix next time is to use a .lb of sausage instead of beef just to kick it up a notch.

A great quick recipe. It does seem a little bit healthier than Nachos Supreme at a restaurant due to the rice and adding your own amounts of cheese and sour cream. However, it does need a little extra something to give it more flavor. We added Tobasco sauce and extra spicy salsa. A great meal in a pinch though!

I added a little diced onion, but other than that we thought it was great!  And very quick and easy.

I love this! It's a quick and tasty meal for a Friday and it is so darn good. My boyfriend loves it and actually asks for me to make it and my godmother actually stole my plate of it. It's easy to say that this is a new favorite!

Thanks for this recipe!  I get the feeling that this recipe would've worked out better for me if I had literally used "instant" rice instead of regular rice.  (lesson learned.  :P )

Did not like this very much, I think that it would be much better without the tomato soup. Needs sour cream.

This was just okay.  The beef mixture was a little bland in flavor with all the rice.  With the left overs I added some hot sauce to add some more flavor.

I made this last night for dinner. I was suprised at how much it made. I had enough left over to share with family. I added some frozen corn also. It was a little bland for me so I added some hotter salsa and it worked for our family. I would make it again.

This recipe was absolutely delicious!!! I did it a little differently, leaving off all the toppings so we could put as much/little on as we wanted. My boyfriend said this rates as one of his new favorites, and he wants it at least twice a month!!! We loved this dish!!!

This was very quick and easy. It was pretty good. If I make it again, I will definitely add some things. Sour cream, chopped tomatoes, black olives, and chives.

This was really good - and even better served with sour cream and nacho chips that I heated in the oven.  I would have rated this 3.5 stars if I could have because hubs and I both felt that there was too much rice in this dish - so next time I will reduce the amount of rice and water by 1/2 cup each. After trying this again, I find that reducing the amount of rice and water makes this dish MUCH better - but you do need about 1 1/4 cups of water to the 1 cup of rice otherwise the mixture is a bit too tight.

Very good and quite  filling. I used spanish rice instead of white rice and white corn tostita rounds. I crushed up the chips and mixed them in with the rice mix for my toddlers.

loved this recipe! I, too, made a couple of revisions. Since I had leftover cooked rice on hand, I used that in place of the uncooked rice.  I added about 1/2 a can of Ro-tel tomatoes to the mix to add more substance and flavor. I also made 1/2 of it vegetarian for my kids by using frozen veggie crumbles.  Everyone loved it! This mixture could also be stuffed into a soft tortilla for a wonderful burrito dinner! I'll definitely be making this one again!

Holly Goodness!!! This was sooooo easy and delicious it's rediculous. It made 4 one cup servings.  I served it over blue corn tortilla chips, with low-fat cheddar and pepper jack cheese, 2 tbps of salsa, and a dollop ofsour cream or smashed avocado.

This is delicious!  I think the tomato soup adds a lot of flavor.  I used brown rice instead of white.  I only topped it with cheese and salsa.  We just ate it like a casserole, even though I had tortilla's to wrap it in like a burrito.  SO GOOD!  I had leftovers for breakfast.  Thank you for posting this quick, easy, delicious recipe.

This is a keeper! What I do to make it work: cut back on the rice (by at least half), add black or red beans and corn, and spice as desired. To serve this, I just put out the pot and let everyone do what they want: some scoop it up with tortilla chips, some load it into a soft flour tortilla for a faux burrito, I like to use it as filler for taco salad, just adding shredded lettuce, sour cream, and a few crunched up tortilla chips.   Very versatile, and yummy. In NO WAY authentic Mexican, but an easy, (relatively) healthy, filling meal. And be prepared: this recipe makes a ton of food!

This dish made a delicious, easy meal in just a few short minutes. I followed the directions except using instant brown rice instead of white and veggie crumbles instead of beef. I also added black beans to the mixure. We will continue to make this!

My entire family loved this meal.  For those who talked about the rice not being cooked, I wonder if they used regular rice instead of instant.  I used regular, but I cooked it until it was almost cooked before adding it to the mixture.  We used ground turkey and turkey italian sausage.  This is definitely a keeper!!

Perhaps the change I made was the problem here, but in the end, I think it would have felt like a taco salad no matter what I did. I tried it because of the great reviews, and I did follow the advice of one of reviewers to make this with bagged Spanish rice. I did have to boil it about 20 minutes to get the water from the Spanish rice and the taco seasoning to boil off. It worked fine and turned out well - not runny or anything - but it was just boring!

This isn't what comes to my mind when someone says "nachos", but it is very good and easy to make. Would freeze great too. Husband and I really liked it.

The entire family loved this recipe. I stretched the recipe to feed 6+ by using 1 package of spanish rice (1-1/2 cups dry) and adding 1/2 cup dry white rice and increasing the water to 2 cups.  It came out perfect and I had a bunch leftover.

I knew it would be easy but the reception it got from my husband and our bachelor friends I often feed blew me away.  Everyone LOVED it. I did add another packet of taco seasoning and salt and pepper, because after adding the soup and water it seemed a little bland. I used brown instant rice instead of white, you could not tell the difference.  And I also grabbed a single serving pack of Birds-eye frozen corn and mixed it in. I served with refried beans, sour cream and tortilla chips. This is going to be a regular in our dinner rotation. Thanks for the great recipe!

Very filling family fun meal.  Be sure to use instant rice--those reviewers with rice problems probably used long grain which takes longer to cook.  Each family member topped their own bowl buffet style with: salsa, lettuce, cheese, black olives and sour cream to their liking--dipped with scoop tortilla chips.  Definitely a keeper in my house!

This was really easy and makes quite a bit of food. I've made it a couple of times because it makes up so quick. I use brown rice in ours and that's the only change. Made enough for leftovers too.

I only used 1 cup of rice and one cup of water and it seemeed to be a perfect meat/rice ration.  Quick, tasty dinner that everyone enjoyed.  Next time I would add some hot sauce.

Yummy! We loved this!  it is such a yummy, easy dinner. I'll definitely be making it again.  The only changes I made were to have sour cream available and when the rice/meat mixture was done, I topped with the salsa, cheese, and sliced olives.  I then covered it all and heated on low until the cheese was melted.  Oh, and I also added a drained can of diced tomatoes, but I don't think they were necessary, yummy, though!

for as long as this takes its good. I did use a homemade taco seasoning and homemade salsa. I had to re-season the meat after dabbing the grease out however it was quick and tasty. DH and Granpa ate theres as is with no chips I used chips to scoop mine up. It would also make a good quick burrito filling.

Awesome! Tastes like some good nachos you'd get at a restaurant. I don't have instant rice so I just made some white rice ahead of time and then added it to the beef & soup. I also didn't need the extra 1 1/2 cups of water.

Great recipe!! I made it for my family of 5 and there were no leftovers.  Everyone loved it.  I did use a bit more meat and a little less rice.  I was also out of taco seasoning so i used fajita seasoning instead, which gave it a little bit more flavor.  I totally recomend that everyone try it, it's awesome!

This was really good for a quick and easy meal. I was feeling mexican tonight and this totally hit the spot. Being a vegetarian,I used Quorn brand meatless crumbles. I put this in the pan with the taco seasoning and since I did not have tomato soup I just used tomato sauce. I also added a can of corn and black beans all together with the rice and other ingredients. Just brought everything to a boil and reduced for about 7 mins. I guess with the other ingredients it took longer for the rice.  The crumbles were already cooked just needed to be heated so I did not bother to cook first. Ta-da! Dinner! Put the mixture in separate bowls for my boyfriend and I and we each topped with cheese, salsa, sour cream, onion, and jalapenos and used chips to scoop. Thanks for posting! I will definitely make again when looking for a quick lunch or dinner.

I thought that this was really good, however my kids didn't seem to care for it very much. I served the toppings on the side and liked mine with chopped tomatoes and sour cream.  I prepared the recipe exactly as written using Minute rice. The recipe made tons, but I will enjoy having it for leftovers!

First off, I loved the concept of your recipe. I made some revisions. I started with ground turkey and sauteed it with Shillings Mesquite Marinade. I added green Onions and a jar od fire roasted salsa. I added one can of drained pinto beans and a can of drained black beans. Separately, I cooked a cup and a half of arborio rice substituting a half cup of Goya Chipolle Mojo sauce and the rest of the water. After cooking in the rice cooker, I added the cook rice to the skillet. Continuing to let it simmer till bubbling. I removed from the heat and topped with generous grayed cheese, a mixture of cheddar and jack. Topped with chopped tomatoes, avocado slices and sour cream. Then served over tortilla chip.

Really enjoyed this meal - did as other suggested and cooked my rice separate then added it to the beef mixture.  My hubby turned up his nose when he saw what was for dinner but as he was taking his second huge helping he had to say it was a keeper - big deal at our house to find a new keeper :)  Love reading the comments and the helpful info.

I made this using 1/2 the rice and an extra 1/2lb of ground beef.  I also replaced the tomato soup with ketchup and salsa.  Turned out fine!  In fact, the kids asked if I'd make it again!

My son made this for us during a busy week. The only change was that we did not have the instant rice, so he did the rice in our rice cooker. This came out rather "boring"! My husband said it was okay. These guys love spice and nachos, but the left-overs went untouched. Sorry. I probably will not make again.

Delicious. Substitutions: I don't like eating alot of rice, so I added about 2/3 cup of cooked rice, can of drained black beans and about a cup of frozen corn to browned meat.  I didn't add the water since I wasn't cooking the rice.  This was quick and easy and good.

This was pretty good.  My spouse enjoyed it more than I did, but it was good.  I went with the recipe as listed, but I added a can of kidney beans as another person suggested to give it more "fill".  I think a chopped jalepeno might spice it up a little more for my liking.  Also ... be sure to use 5 minute instant rice.  I think some reveiwers must have used reg (20 min) rice.

My Family loves this.  I add a little more water; the rice was hard the first time so I had to increase the cooking time.  I also like to add Kidney beans.  My children like to put their nacho supreme into a soft taco shell and eat it like a burrito.

Great easy recipe. Even my picky eater ate. Great leftovers too.  I added a can of cheddar cheese soup to the water and rice. It had to simmer a bit after.  Not sure if it made much difference but I had it and tried it.

This was amazing.  All my kids loved it, includng my skeptical 8yr old who only likes "plain" tacos.  I did what some of the other reviewers said and added the rice after I cooked it first and ommitted the water.  For the tomato soup, instead of campbells, I used my own from the "Garden Fresh Tomato Soup" recipe on this site.  Fabulous!  I also served it alongide "Slower Cooker Chicken Tacos".  Best taco night we have had in a while!

I liked the idea of this recipe but I only gave it a 4 star because I changed it considerably. I cooked the beef with taco seasoning and salsa. Then I cooked the rice with the tom. soup and water together on its own. Put it all together in a casserole dish, topped with cheese and broiled for 5 minutes - just so the cheese melted. Added some sour cream and green onion on top. IT WAS AWESOME!!!!!

Made this last weekend for my 5 yr old and the rest of the family.  i used ground turkey instead of beef and ground up the beans (as some one suggested) and threw in some orange bell peppers and spinach and onions w/wheat germ.  the family didn't know it but they actually had a healthy meal.  will use again.

I made this delicious and quick meal and was very happy with it!  I would have cooked the rice separately and added it in later, like others suggested though.  It took forever for the rice to cook, and I wound up giving up and having mostly cooked rice.  Delicious!

The recipe was ok, but not spectacular. The flavors were a little bland. I felt like there was so much more you could do. A good base recipe, but you definitely  need to add your own style to it - more vegetables, spices or whatever.

This has become one of my favorite meals. It's quick, tasty, and it makes several meals for my lonesome self. The only changes I made are using ground turkey instead of beef and I add a layer of sour cream. Great recipe!

I didn't have instant rice so I attempted to make brown rice seperate with the tomato soup and it turned out nasty. The tomato soup made it a goopy sweet mess. So I rinsed it all off and then stuck it in the recipe and continued. As far as I'm concerned just make plain rice and stick it in the recipe. In the end it was o.k. but I did add some beans and corn to it also.

For what it is-- quick, easy, kid-friendly fare-- it doesn't get better! I made this with reduced sodium taco seasoning and soup and instant brown rice and it was fine, and baked tortilla chips were also good.  Definitely will make it again.

I used ground turkey and added some chili powder, coriander and cumin to add some more flavor.  I also mixed 1/2 the cheese in so it would be all melty.  Put the other half on top along with sour cream, chopped cilantro, lettuce, tomato and olives.  Avocado is yummy too!  My 2 & 7 year olds LOVE this!! (great excuse to eat chips for dinner!! ;)

OUTSTANDING! I MADE THIS FOR A 'DRESS DOWN SUNDAY DINNER'.  I SKIPPED THE LETTUCE - TOO MESSY.  I ADDED THE CHEESE AND SALSA AND PUT THE COVER BACK ON THE HOT BURNER (TURNED OFF) TO LET IT MELT. THEN I FOLDED THE INGREDIENTS TOGETHER AND SERVED W/TORTILLA CHIPS.  WE SCOOPED A BIG SCOOP ONTO OUR SANDWICH PLATES AND WORKED FROM THERE.  WHAT A TERRIFIC APPETIZER THIS WILL BE IN THE FUTURE. THANKS SO MUCH. IT'S GOING IN MY 5 STAR FILE.

I bag of success brown rice=1 1/2 cups. I used the brown rice, came out great, but I had to cook for 20 min, instead of 5, and I added a can of rinsed black beans. The tomato soup makes it slightly sweet, but don't add salt if you are serving with corn chips. A very good recipe, even the kids enjoyed it!

I've made a similiar dish to this before.   Bet you could use packaged Spanish Rice or Taco Rice in place of the white rice.

These were great! I had to add about a cup of extra water in order to cook the rice long enough to be as tender as I wanted it.  Plus I boiled it for about 10-15 minutes rather than 5.  Next time I'll leave the salsa off and add it as desired on my plate because my husband doesn't like the taste of the salsa. I added sour cream on my plate this time and that was really great.  Otherwise a huge hit!

Really nice. I didn't add rice, salsa or lettuce. I added some diced green bell pepper and fresh corn to the meat sauce which tastes excellent. I used the taco dry mix from this site. I layered corn chips, meat sauce, grated cheddar and microwaved individual plates until the cheese melted and became bubbly. I added a big dollop of sour cream as well.

Tastes great and very easy.  My only complaint is I would have liked more veggies - I will likely add onions & tomatoes next time.

This was fabulous. My family loved it. I did make the rice in another pan then added it to the meat mixture. I also added 1 TBSP Chili powder to add a bit more spice. A quick, delicious weekday meal.

I have made this recipe AS IS for several years now and have only just now changed it up. I love the original recipe like no other. but this time I added a can of tomatoes with green chilis and a can of corn. it just adds a little something extra. :)

I also love putting it in tortillas for burritos!

At first I thought it was a dip. But when I made it, it was even better than that. I layered the chips in a Jelly Roll pan put the beef and rice mix on top, sprinkled it with cheese, and put it in the oven on broil for a couple minutes. It turned out awesome.

Yes it was okay. Needed a few extra goodies. I used onion and bell pepper, garlic salt and chili powder. And instead of cheddar cheese I used  Velveeta and a can of Rotel Plus it needed more water and a few minutes longer to cook. Worth a try again..

Living in a place where canned soup isn't available, I substituted a box of tomato sauce. After reading reviews, and not having instant rice at home, I cooked regular rice in the rice cooker. I also added corn. I decreased the water to 3/4 cups since it wouldn't be absorbed by the rice cooking.  Good basic recipe to start with.

Maybe it was us, but we both disliked this. It just didn't taste good.
