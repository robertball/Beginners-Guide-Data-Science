I KNEW this recipe would stain hands, countertop, rolling pin, etc...  I was wrong.  We were out of cloves, so I substituted a mix of allspice, mace, and ginger.  Worked great and smelled delicious.  The longer you knead the dough, the easier it was to work with.  My kids and I (ages 5 & 7) made 29 ornament/gift ties from this recipe.  Sand the edges after they dry to 'clean up' any rough spots.

Very simple to make.  I had to add a little bit more applesauce to get the right consistency.  I would say don't bother adding the cloves or nutmeg - the cinnamon is so overwhelming that you don't really smell either one and it's a waste of expensive spices.  I dried them in the oven and some cracked and others heaved a little.  If you have the time to air dry them, do it that way.   You'll be happier with the finished product.

This is a wonderful recipe!!  We substituted 1 TB allspice instead of the cloves and nutmeg and used the tiny cookie cutters, we ended up with 82 ornaments. Bamboo Skewers (not the pointed end) make good holes for hanging.  Then we decorated them with acrylic paints.  They make great gift tags or ornaments...and they made the house smell super!!

This scented my entire house. I only added Cinnamon, not the other spices. I also added about 1/2 c to 1 c of flour. Seems to bind everything more. Tip: pat the mixture on plastic wrap (prevent sticking-easy clean-up) instead of rolling for less cracking. Make'm thick or they'll break! Use simple cutouts to prevent breaking. I baked for 2 hours turning every 1/2 hour to prevent sticking etc. They are wonderful!! Thanx.

These are adorable and the smell is divine! Roll them out thick, otherwise the thin ones tend to crack. We used a straw to make the holes and then decorated them with white, red and green puffy paint. So cute and the kids had so much fun. Wonderful recipe!

I made them 3 years ago and they still smell great. I made several X-mas tree ornaments and gift tags/tie ons with this recipe. I had a couple of problems though: some of them warped and others had cracks. Does anybody know how to avoid these problems?

The house smells so good having made this recipe!  Thank you Susan for sharing.  I used a cup of applesauce and skipped the glue because it is not necessary and makes the dough harder to work with.  Plastic throw-away gloves are a good idea.  This recipe made 9 ornaments. (size shown in photo)  I found a dollar store is the best place to purchase cinnamon for this project, and I use the cheap store brand applesauce.  Because I made the ornaments a bit thick, I tried cooking them in the oven at 200.  After a couple hours, when they were getting near done, I noticed they were starting to curl.  I took them out immediately and allowed them to air dry.  I first made this recipe about 20 years ago and the ornaments are as good as ever.  I do nothing special to store them, just pack them away with the rest of the Christmas tree balls.

These ornaments turned out really well in the end, but I had to use more applesauce than the recipe called for because the dough was really crumbly.  Other than that, I really enjoyed making them with my daughter.  One hint...we used glitter glue, little round red hot candies, and hot glue gun to add decorations to the ornaments.  They look really pretty that way.

Great! Use a straw instead of a toothpick to make the holes.  Makes about 14 3" ornaments.  Needed closer to 1 C applesauce.  Be sure to reserve some cinnamon for dusting the surface (I also used parchement paper) and while rolling.

Added ingredients exactly as described.  Made them 1/2" thick and had 10 ornaments.  After cutting, placed on a parchment lined baking sheet for the 1st day.  Removed from sheet and placed on cookie rack and allowed to dry.  Turned each day and it took 7 days for them to dry thoroughly.  Used puff glitter paint to decorate.  Was presented this Rosemary plant as a thank you for hosting Thanksgiving brunch and as a lark just hung some of the ornaments to take a picture.  Thanks for the recipe!

Just adorable Susan! I remember my own kids making these in school as Christmas gifts for us and have always treasured them. Altho the scent is long gone, to this day, they still hang on my tree. I decided to make these with my sweetie's grandchildren over the weekend and each little ornament turned out so cute. The kids had a blast and thank you Susan!

I have made these ornaments last year and i ADDED some cinnamon oil (the kind you make suckers with) just a few drops. and the ornaments still have a lot of smell to them. We are making them again this year so we can put them on packages. When we made these last year the Cinnamon DID NOT stain the counters like i thought they would. I would recommend this to everyone who has children big or small. This is a fun project.

Great project. My house smells wonderful! You can buy cinnamon much chepaer at Sam's Club. I found it to be so easy to roll the "dough" between pieces of waxed paper.

I've made these for years using just applesauce and cinnamon.  There's just no need for the other spices or glue- the ornaments are perfect without them.  Roll them out thick so they don't crack, and if you're air-drying, gently turn them twice a day so they don't warp.  Perfect kid-friendly craft!

These were great! Very easy, and held their shape well! I will be sanding the edges because they are very rough.  I dried them in the 200 degree oven for about 2 or 3 hours and left them on the cookie sheet for a day or so to finish drying.  My 18 yo son thought he was being sneaky and ate one....said "I didn't want to tell you that these cookies are horible!...I thought they needed frosting to taste good!" We got a good laugh out of that!

Wonderful! I left out the cloves and nutmeg and just used the cinamon as suggested. I dried these in my dehydrator - very fast!

The bottoms got too brown but I may have rolled the dough too thin.  I did love them anyway!  I have a brown cow so made brown cow ornaments that were quite a hit!  They smell great too!

I made the recipe just as listed, minus the cloves because I didn't have any.  While mixing it was crumbly so I added a bit more applesauce. Still crumbly but before I added more applesauce I turned it out of counter (dusted with cinnamon) and started kneading it.  After about 2 minutes of kneading it was a perfect dough!  I used a meat thermometer to make the hole for the ribbon, it was the perfect size.  Just push it through while you're holding the ornament (before baking) so it goes all the way through.  I baked around 200 for about 3 hours.  After cool I used a nail file to sand down the edges and it made all the difference!  They look and smell perfect!

Great recipe to do with kids.  I suggest using a straw instead of a toothpick for cutting the hole.
You could also try flipping the ornaments when drying so they don't curl up!

We had so much fun making these cinnamon ornaments!  I doubled the recpe and it made quite a few.  I used cheap cinnamon apple sauce plus all the spices and I did not add the glue because as others stated it was not necessary.  My four year old had a blast cutting these out.  We decorated them with glitter glue and they are adorable! I can still smell the cinnamon.  I think I might make another batch today so we can give some away to the grand-parents.  Also, I bought  cinnamon at walmart for fifty cents a bottle.  Makes a great homemade gift and well worth the cost of cinnamon!

Although it rolled out nicely and smelled really great (I'm a cinnamon fanatic), truthfully? Cinnamon is too expensive to use 1 full cup for a recipe like this. Sorry! My friend and I tried this out with her own ingredients. No way was I going to waste my cinnamon and money trying this recipe.

These were pretty easy, but I only gave it 4 stars since these definately need more applesauce than it calls for.  I rolled them out on wax paper and after the 1st batch, they were so dry and crumbly I couldn't get any more out of the batch.  I ended up with only 5 useable ornaments.  Good basic idea and my 2 year old enjoyed it.

I just made these while my 17ht month old was eating in the high chair. Very simple to make. I did need to add more cinnamon. They are still in the oven. My house smells like Christmas.

These were great and easy to make. I put mine in the oven for a few hours so they would be done more quickly. Stick to the advice about not making them to thin and also I took others advice about adding some flour. I gave them to all the kids teachers in a goodie bag with some Christmas candy. Merry Christmas!

These Christmas oornaments were so easy to make. I decorated them with puff paint in Christmas colors.I attached them to presants.They did need a little more applesauce then the recipe called for.I kept remainder of dough in a ziplock bag.

Same wonderful recipe I used when my children were young.  Nicely scented and decorative for the holdiays.  Always a great craft or gift idea.

LoVe this recipe! I found that it works best when the dough is moist and kneaded well. I had to add more applesauce than called for (about 1/4 c. more). I used a cold plastic cutting board to roll the dough with a sheet of wax paper over the top. I have a rolling pin that I can set to roll various thicknesses evenly and set it to 1/4", rolled then cut basic shapes and let air dry. After they dry I'll use sand paper to smooth the edges as recommended and decorate. Smells like Christmas!

I've made this many, many times over the years and my grown children remember helping to make and decorate these :) The best applesauce to use is the cheapest you can find and save the expensive brands for lunches. The cheap applesauce has more water and sugar in it and will better  help the dough be moist and elastic. If your dough gets dry, use a sprayer to spritz the dough with water and work it in until it's back to a non-crumbly stage.  If it's too wet, your ornaments will dry and develop noticeable cracks on the surface so if you don't want cracks, shake some additional cinnamon on the dough and work that in until it's again a moist and elastic dough. 

I used a straw t make the holes at the top. Make sure you leave about a quarter inch of space between the top of the hole and the edge of the ornament to keep it strong after it dries. 

I used pearls, fabric paints, rhinestones, buttons and hot glued little decorative bits to the ornaments. Fabric paint is formulated for a porous surface so it performs very well on these. Glitter glue comes off in a very unattractive way if it's applied right to the surface. My ornaments lasted for almost 20 years and still smelled good. Store wrapped in tissue paper.

The first time I tried to roll these out , the dough cracked and crumbled.  I pulled it all back together and worked it  for a long time, kneading it until it was soft,  and it became MUCH easier to work with. I also rolled it between two sheets of plastic wrap and this kept my surface clean.

Wow this was incredibly hard to work with.  I ended up leaving it sit covered with plastic wrap overnight and it did get marginally better to roll out.  Found a much better recipe somewhere that works much much better.  The smell was wonderful!

My kids, husband and I made these tonight to hang from our tree. They were fairly easy for all of them (ages 2,5&8) and they smell fantastic, these will surely go down in our yearly Christmas tradition book thanks to ease and pleasant aroma.

These make great Christmas decorations and are fun to make with kids.  They smell amazing both  while they're baking and afterwards and are great to cut into shapes and paint.  However, they use a LOT of cinnamon so be prepared.

Do roll it out at least 1/3 inches thick so the edges won’t curl.  Also, it took twice as long to dry in my oven. But the sent is heavenly! I tripled the recipe.

I did some baked and some air dried and our air dried ornaments looked nicer. I made them 5 years ago and they still smell amazing when we pull them out of their ziplock bag to put on our tree. A favourite of mine and my 6 year old. This year we are making more to give out as gifts for teachers, and will likely make again in the future.

My son and I make a new ornament every year to give out to family and teachers as a gift from him. This was our choice for 2015 and it was definitely fun. At 4, he had a good time pouring in ingredients and rolling out the dough. We purchased a 1/4 inch stick of wood and cut it in half from the hardware store and rolled the dough out between them for an even 'cookie' and went without the dusting of cinnamon on the pan and used parchment paper instead. The hardest part was how sticky the dough was on our rolling pin. I just sprayed that down with some baking pam and it worked out fine. We used a straw for the hole rather than a toothpick like others have suggested. They turned out pretty nice with a little puff paint to finish.

Thank You so much. The kids had a great time making these. I ran out of wax paper so I used a clean garbage bag; rolled the dough inside, cut the sides open and it worked great.

worked very well, I added slightly more glue.  I also baked these, flipping them every 20 minutes for about 80 minutes and left them to set for a couple hours.
