Loved this recipe!!! I made it as is, but next time Iâ€™m adding spinach and a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes for heat. The recipe is super easy to double which is a huge plus when cooking for a family of hungry guys.

So easy to make. I changed out the beef stock for vegetable stock and my vegetarian friends gobbled it up!
