These were wonderful -- even my children loved them. Used ricotta instead of sour cream along with salsa.  Delicious!  Judy

I cut this down to about 1/4 of the recipe.  I had 7 good sized cakes.  These are real good.  I used leftover black eye peas that I had cooked from dried peas.   Will make again.

What a different and enjoyable way to have black-eyed peas.  The only person who didn't absolutely adore this was my son.  Bue he really liked it just not as well as the rest of us.

I could not find hush puppy mix so I used a corn bread mix and I think it turned out fine

this is an easier(for me)way to get the kids to eat their lucky peas for New Years. I fiddled with the ingredients a bit to make it a little less solid, and fried it as a hash with cheddarwurst.Paired it with the scalloped cabbage recipe on this site.

My sister and I are vegetarians, and have found that this recipe works very well as the "meat" for veggie burgers.
