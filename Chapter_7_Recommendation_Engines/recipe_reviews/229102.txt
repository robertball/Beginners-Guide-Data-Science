During the winter months, I make this quite a bit. It's almost like a pumpkin dump cake crossed with Impossible Pumpkin Pie. This is also really good if you use spice cake mix instead of yellow cake mix. I like to serve this with dollops of Cool Whip. Dieters, beware. My husband and I can sit and eat this all night, one sneaky spoonful at a time.......it's dangerous.

I made this dessert when my son came home from college.  Pumpkin is one of his favorite, and this dessert did not disappoint.  I used salted butter and we enjoyed the taste of the salty against the sweet.  I used half the amount of pecans and toasted them, covering only half the dessert.  This comes together quickly and we thought tasted even better the second day.  Thanks piequeen1215 for sharing this dessert recipe.

I tried this mostly to get rid of a can of pumpkin I had. My husband didn't want to try it because he doesn't like pumpkin and ended up eating seconds. He hated to admit he liked it after telling me he didn't want any because he just didn't like pumpkin. I loved it and my pumpkin-hating husband did, too. In my "Favorite tried and true desserts" file, and will make again.

My daughter made this for dessert last night. It was delicious! She used a spice cake mix since that was all we had....and only added nuts on half of the cake. So good and easy! She did a great job!

My mother made this for our early Thanksgiving dinner (me and my husband are going to his family's for Thanksgiving this year), and it was absolutely delicious. The only warning my mom gives is that you want to eye the pecans on top. Even a couple minutes more will come close to burning them and then the top will be too rigid. Luckily, ours did not burn and I thought it tasted irresistible, especially when paired with a dollop of whip cream.

I made this recipe for dinner when we had company and I used a pecan cake mix instead of the golden cake mix.  I also added in with the pecans on top some skor bits and it really added to the flavour as well. Everyone loved it.  My granddaughter doesn't like nuts so will use the golden cake mix when she comes over and just use more skor bits instead of pecans. Served with whipping cream.  Easy and Yummy!!!

I never have evaporated milk on hand . I substituted with 1 cup half and half and a little cream as that is what I had. Used cinnamon,nutmeg, ground cloves and allspice  since I did not have "pumpkin Pie " spice . I did cover loosely over the top with aluminum foil for the last 10-15 min. to prevent pecans from over browning. Yes I would make it again.

This dessert was so good. I made it for my co-workers and they loved it. I will be making this for my family at Thanksgiving. It had to bake a little longer though.

Easy to make and well received at dinner this evening  I had to use what the grocery store had, and they only had the pumpkin pie mixture instead. I didn’t adjust the sugar accordingly, so it was pretty sweet. Next time, I’ll be better prepared. Still, it was pretty good anyways

This is one of the easiest recipes to make with a huge bang for your buck. I have made this twice and there wasn't a piece leftover. it's great warm with the cool whip on top. it's not too sweet and it's really a one bowl preparation. People can't get enough of it. I highly recommend it especially when moving into the cooler weather. Delicious.

Super easy and my family loved it!  I cut the sugar by 1/3 cup and substituted walnuts for the pecans as that's what I had on hand.  Will definitely be making this again and again.

We used 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Also reduce amount of butter to just 1/2 cup. Sprinkled cinnamon on top of cake mix before adding butter and pecans. Everyone absolutely loves it!

I made it for a dinner dessert exactly as originally posted.  Our guests loved it.  I agree with the comments that it tastes better on the second or third day!  Easily rewarmed in microwave for individual servings.  Will be a repeat here!

It turned out perfect except I didn't use the cake mix and topped it with vanilla ice cream.

Wonderful dessert!  I may never make pumpkin pie again (and I made a delicious pumpkin pie!)because this is yummy, makes more servings, serves easily, and is a bit different.  I received many compliments when I took  to a gathering last night and have now shared the recipe.

I lives up to it's name. It is very rich, but it is good.  I used the spice cake mix like a couple of people suggested.  The first three bites taste like yummy holiday deliciousness, but you can't eat much more than that.  I liked it with vanilla ice cream on top!  I, also, should have left it in the oven in there a little longer, but it may have burned the pecans.   I think I will add The pecans 10 into the hour, and then leave it in the 10 minutes longer.

it was easy but only ok.  maybe I did't cook it long enough but the consistency felt wrong.
