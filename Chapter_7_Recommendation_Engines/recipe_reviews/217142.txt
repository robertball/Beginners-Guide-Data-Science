After reading reviews (dry muffins)and having made muffins with  oats as an ingredient (DRY)  I made these with the following modifications and they came out very moist and delicious. I cut the oats to 1/2 a cup and added 3/4 a cup more of fresh blackberries and 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips. Baking time was 17 min in my oven. YUMMY!

Made the recipe exactly as written.  It's a very thick batter, and the muffins, although moist, were very dense.  Did not get even a hint of the pumpkin pie spice which I thought was going to put this one over the top.  My apologies to the recipe writer because I know this had all 5-star ratings, but we were disappointed.

This is a great base recipe.  I cut the sugar in half, added a very ripe banana, orange zest, and LOTS more blackberries. Mine were VERY moist.

Great recipe. I substituted 1 cup blueberries and 1/2 cup chocolate chips for the blackberries. I also used cinnamon instead of pumpkin pie spice. Making a double batch next time!

With a few tweaks these are fantastic! I use quick oats instead of rolled oats.  I added 1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce and doubled the vanilla to 2 tsp.  I made my own spice mix (cinnamon,nutmeg, ginger, clove) and added about 2 tsp to the mix.  In addition to the 1 1/2 cups of blackberries I added 1/2 cup chopped strawberries.  This made a moist, not to sweet, muffin bursting with berry flavor! YUM.

These were ok -  made exactly as written and they were ok -  actually a little drier than I expected.  May use oil instead of butter next time.

What a tasty recipe!  The batter is a great base for any berry.  I usually change something about a recipe, but this one was perfect as is!  Love it!

Taking into consideration all of the comments about dryness and density, these are the changes I made: 1 cup buttermilk instead of milk, 1/4 cup cooking oil for the butter and 2 eggs instead of one. I used 3/4 cup oatmeal and whole wheat flour. For the spices I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp salt and added cinnamon chips. It made 28 muffins that were moist and delicious!

Had loads of fresh blackberries from the farm last night so I made these before I went to bed so they'd be there for breakfast.  When I took them out of the oven it was all I could do to let them cool for 10 minutes before I had to sample one!  They are moist and delicious.  The only changes I made were to use half whole wheat flour (I do this in most of my baking) and I added about 1/8c more milk to compensate for this.  I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I used 1/8 tsp. cinnamon and 1/8 nutmeg.  They turned out awesome.  I took some down to my landlady, her Mother and Brother in Law this morning and they loved them!  I will make them again as I have 4 baggies of berries in the freezer measured out specifically for this recipe!

This recipe is fantastic.  It is a little too dense, so I added whipped cream after they were done.  I used 1/4 cup sugar and added to mix.  Also, it was better to chop the oatmeal first to make them smaller and more powdery.  I didn't have pumpkin pie spice, so I added apple pie spice.  Turned out great with the Cool Whip.

I made these with whole wheat flour and frozen berries. They were very tasty and filling! The amount seems to be off though, as it made more than 12 muffins.

I didn't care for these at all. I made them exactly as directed ... but they were heavy, not sweet enough and fairly tasteless, except for the blackberries.

I made these this morning and I think they are excellent! I did change a small detail or two. I didn't have enough blackberries so I topped it off with some blueberries, I didn't have the sugar for the topping so I used some oats, and I don't like pumpkin pie spice (I hate ginger) so I used apple pie spice. I usually coat my berries in some flour before mixing them in the batter, I forgot to do this; and I don't think it was needed the batter was thick enough that the berries didn't settle.

I make a lot of muffins, and this one is good, but not the WOW factor that rates a 5.  Very dense and heavy, but still yummy. I had to add a little more milk so that I could mix it without crushing the delicate berries, it is very thick.  Love the sugar topping, it makes a nice crunch.  I used Mexican unrefined Cane sugar instead of turbinado and instead of brown sugar, since I had it on hand. Also these muffins come out of the paper liner very well, they don't stick to the paper.  Made 15 for me.  I will make it again.

I followed other reviewer suggestions and used 1/2 cup oats, buttermilk and 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce substitutions.  Muffins were quite moist with huge berries.  I've made them several times because they're now my husband's favorite.

I used thawed blackberries, whole wheat pastry flour, and doubled the pumpkin pie seasoning...they all worked great.  Based on the reviews that said the muffins were dry, I made my own modifications.  I used hot water in place of milk, quick oats in place of rolled, and grapeseed oil in place of butter.  My muffins turned out flavorful and moist...I will make these again soon!  Another reviewer suggested adding some chocolate chips...I did, because who doesn't like chocolate chips?  I won't add chocolate chips to these again...they detracted from the blackberries which were great on their own.

They were okay. They were dry enough the next day that I didn't want to eat them. And I feel that I added too much oatmeal. These muffins need something else, I just can't figure out what.....

Made this last night- house smelled amazing when cooking. I did hesitate like others about the oats since we light fluffy muffins so I only added 1/2 cup. The overall verdict in out house was they were a bit too dense.

Very good, whole family liked these better than traditional muffins.  I omitted the pumpkin pie spice as I did not have any on hand, but will try it next time.
I also used mixed berries (raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, blackberries).

They are OK...turned out pretty dry and nothing really special about the flavour.  However, worth trying again with changes: instead of butter i am going to use 1/4 cup oil or maybe substitute butter with apple sauce?  Different spices?  Maybe a crumb topping?

Based on the reviews I made a couple of substitutions.  I substituted 1/2 c of the oatmeal for 1/4 c of wheat germ & 1/4 c of flax meal.  I also subbed 1c of wheat flour instead for 1 c of all-purpose.  Since some of the reviews stated that the mixture was on the thick side I decided to add 1/2 c of orange juice to the batter and I also increased the pumpkin pie spice to 1 tsp.  Glad I made these changes. These were definitely yummy and I got about 18 nice sized muffins. A keeper with the changes I made.

These muffins are truly amazing!!! bursting with fruit,nice and moist, and the oatmeal gives a real "hearty" feel to them! I added both blackberries and raspberries and the result was so delicious!! Only thing i changed was to cut the oatmeal in half and add extra berries to make sure the muffins were nice and moist, which they were. I think this is a great base for any kind of fruit muffin and i am excited to try it with some other ingredients too.

I did make mine "jumbo" sized, so i adjusted the cooking to 22-25minutes at 375, they were perfect!

Fresh picked berries from backyard, oats and brown sugar......PERFECT. Dense but airy, nicely sweetened muffin. Fold berries in but dont over do it. Loved the crunchy top of turbinado sugar. Nicely browned at exact time and peeled of paper nicely.

These were delicious.  They made 12 huge muffins.  I followed the recipe exactly other than using half whole wheat flour.  I thought about reducing the sugar, but the wild blackberries we picked were not sweet, so it was just right.

YUM!  Used 1/2 c brown sugar (not packed) and 1/2 c Splenda.  Baked perfectly!  It kinda tastes like a banana muffin due to the pumpkin spice - but it is delightful!

These were not sweet enough for me, a little dry & too dense. I added 1/2 c white sugar to the second batch which improved the sweetness. Not sure what to do about the dryness & the denseness. Wish they were more like cake. Maybe some oil?

Very easy to make and turned out great.  Doubled amount of pumpkin pie spice (would probably add even more next time) and forgot to sprinkle with turbinado sugar.  Baked up beautifully and still tasted great without the extra sugar on top.  Will make again.

I made these according to the recipe, but was a little short on brown sugar.  They were really good, and I know I'll like them even more when I make them next, with a little extra sweetness.  Definitely a recipe to try out!

Holy Talito! I just pulled these out of the oven, and they are absolutely divine!  The only difference I made to the recipe were the ones necessary for high altitude baking, oh and the sugar topping cause I didn't have any of the specified type, so I used regular sugar.  My oldest son (7 years) declared that these are the best muffins ever! So thank you for the wonderful recipe!

Absolutely wonderful! I made the first batch exactly as said except substituted with home milled wheat four and wild blackberries and made the second batch (because the first batch was eaten in about 30 minutes) with 1/2 wheat 1/2 spelt and used soured raw milk. Both were exceptional. Thank yo for sharing such a tasty, versatile recipe. This is now a family favorite.

This was a great way to use fresh blackberries we picked earlier in the day! I did cut the blackberries since they were large and I wanted to make sure they were dispersed fairly evenly. I also used one cup of whole wheat flour and one cup of all purpose flour instead of two cups of all purpose flour. The recipe made more than 12 muffins (I did not want to risk overfilling the tin) so I made several mini muffins with the remaining batter. These muffins were hearty and made a good breakfast the next morning.

These muffins are delicious and a rich tasting low fat option . I upped the spice to 1 1/2 teaspoons. Batter was a bit dry, so needed a bit of milk added to moisten it. Makes 12 reasonable size muffins. Freezes well ( if there are any left)! Thanks for sharing!

My first time making blackberry muffins & using this recipe. Yummy! Moist, flavorful & satisfying! I doubled the recipe & added 1 t almond extract (just because I like almond flavor with berries), in addition to the required vanilla. It made 24 mini & 18 regular muffins. I started breaking the fresh berries in half after mixing it all together since I was filling mini ones. I wanted to be sure every muffin got some berry in it. It worked very well!

As others have stated made some changes: 1/2 c of brown sugar, 1 Cup plus 1/8 C milk, 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon (my husband loves cinnamon) and baked at 375 for 22 minutes.  They came out delicious, but since had to make changes it changed the rating.

This is probably my all time favorite muffin recipe!
I think it would work with a variety of other berries, also.
And it makes a large batch, which is good because they go fast in my household, and are popular with my friends as well!

Thsee are fantastic!  SO easy to make.  Moist and dense.  I used HUGE berries, and evaporated milk.  I used all purpose flour and the non-fancy ingredients from my pantry.  I cooked the muffins for less than 22 minutes.  (Until the knife was "almost" clean).  I let them rest for less than 1 minute, and removed them from the muffin pans so they didn't continue to cook.   I laid the muffins on the rack sideways to cool.  I served them warm with meled butter  on top, and on the plate I added warm cream cheese sprinkled with cocoa, garnished with 2 huge berries.

These muffins are very dense but still moist. I used both the oats and wholewheat flour and they were still quite moist, although I did up the milk content slightly. It made a big difference. I also reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup. It lacked flavour so I brushed sugar, cinnamon and butter over the tops. I will use this recipe again as it's quite flexible and healthier than other muffin recipes.

These were tasty!  After reading several reviews, I decided to make some changes to make them less dense.  I substituted 1/2 cup oil for the butter, cut the oatmeal to 1/2 cup and put it in a grinder, and I added one very ripe banana and a few more blackberries.  I would definitely make these again.

I was looking for a tried-and-true breakfast recipe that called for blackberries and chose this one.  Sure, I could have just used blackberries in place of blueberries in the blueberry muffin recipe I already have, but I wanted some variation!  These were super yummy and this recipe is going into our rotation.  I did take the oats down to half a cup per one of the reviews ... I didn't want to take the chance of using a whole cup and having a dozen too-dry muffins as some other reviewers complained about.

I tried the recipe just as written. My family says they are too dry. Are you supposed to use quick oats or regular? I used regular, and they were not too popular. What do you suggest?

This recipe is yummy. I added chocolate chips. I didnt use pumpkin pie spice. I used cinnamon instead. I have regular sized cupcake tins and this recipe made 24 muffins. I baked the first pan for 20 minutes and they were over baked on the bottoms. The next pan I baked for 15 minutes and that was perfect. They taste better cold from the refrigerator.

This recipe is great.  Just took some suggestions from the other reviewers.  Changed oatmeal to just 1/2cup and added 1/2 cup of orange juice. I did not have pumpkin spice on hand but added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, and 1/8 of cloves. Yum!!

Giving this 4 stars, but DH thinks they really deserve 3 1/2! Cut the recipe in half today to make what I thought would be 6 muffins; actually there was enough batter for 7. As did another reviewer, I used half unbleached white and half whole wheat flours. We really liked the texture and taste, although neither DH or I could taste the spices. Also, because DH is diabetic, I used brown Ideal brand sweetener in the batter, and sprinkled about 1 teaspoon of regular sugar over the 6 muffins. I will definitely make these again, but will increase the spices and will try these with other berries or fruit.

These muffins are AWESOME!  I had to slightly tweak the recipe because I didn't have dark brown sugar.  Instead I used granulated sugar plus 2 Tablespoons molasses.  I also increased the pumpkin pie spice to 1 teaspoon.  So much flavor and so moist.  Definitely holding on to this recipe!  Thank you Robin!

I thought these were okay muffins.  The oatmeal made them a bit chewy, but my toddler liked them with her breakfast.  I left off the extra sugar on top and used light brown sugar, but otherwise made them as listed.  Not sure if I will make them again, but not bad to add to a toddlers meal to get in a lot of food groups at once if you dont mind the brown sugar.  I did mix my berries up so she didnt get chunks of berry all at once so my muffins turned out a blueish green color, so be sure to fold gently if you want yours to be pretty.

These were delicious. I increased the pumpkin pie spice (based on another review) to about 3/4 of a TB.

Also - make sure you CAREFULLY fold in the blackberries. I dropped mine into the kitchenaid mixer and the dough and muffins took on an unappetizing grey color. Still delicious, but not something you'd want to bring to someone's house!

Delicious! This recipe yielded 16 regular-sized muffins for me and they were done in 18 minutes.

I substituted 1 c. of the flour with wheat, added cinnamon and peanut butter chips.  They were decent in flavor, but I also overcooked them a bit.
