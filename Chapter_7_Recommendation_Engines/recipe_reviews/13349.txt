I remembered (too late) the reason that tomatoes should be added at the END of the cooking: dried beans don't get soft if acid (vinegar, tomatoes, etc.) are added before the beans are soft. I thought it was odd, but followed the recipe almost exactly (no ham was wasted, at least) because of all the good reviews. When I re-read the reviews I noticed a lot of the reviewers mentioned using canned beans, and maybe others used them, also. So, important tips:  Canned Beans - Use less water (go by looks, you can add more later if you need it) and a lot less salt. No need to cook 2 hours.  Carrots - I followed the recipe and I thought the grated carrots looked very unappetizing in the cooked soup. Chopped work much better.  Dried beans - Either soak the beans overnight, or quick soak (boil 10 minutes, then let sit covered for and hour). DO NOT ADD TOMATOES until the beans are soft.  TOO LATE? If you've already been cooking the recipe as written for 2 to 3 hours when you read this, and still can't stomach the firm beans, you can put the beans in a blender if you didn't add the ham. I used some of the blended beans to make the Black Bean Vegetable Soup from the site. If I hadn't had those additional ingredients I would have had to order pizza.

This soup was so good that my picky three-year-old slurped the broth, and the hubs called it my "cure-all" tonic because it wiped away his stomachache.

I used three cans of black beans (and no extra salt) instead of dried; no bay leaf (didn't have any); 4 pressed garlic cloves instead of minced garlic and garlic powder.  I also used 3 crumbled slices of bacon in place of the enormous amount of ham because we were in the mood for a more veggie-oriented soup.

All I can say is YUMMY!  Made this soup for dinner last night and my whole family enjoyed it.  I followed some of the other reviewers recommendation of adding a neckbone or ham hock to the soup and cutting back on the salt content.  I omitted the salt and increased the celery salt from 1 teaspoon to 2 teaspoon.  I also added more cayenne pepper to add some spice.  I must say all of the ingredients for this soup was easy  to find and I had the majority of it on hand.  I will definitely make this soup again.  The flavor is GREAT and so easy to fix!  Thanks!

Yummy on a cold night! Hubby thought it a little salty and said he'd at least cut salt in half next time.  Served with a little sour cream & shredded cheese on top. Will definitely make again.  Already planning it for when we have leftover pork loin and will use in place of ham! Thanks - good recipe.

This was pretty good. Nice & spicy. Although I did make a few changes.  The biggest was to omit the ham as I wanted a non-meat version.  My mistake there was that I should have use 8 cups of water/broth instead of 10.  And instead of diced tomatoes I used about 2 cups of salsa which I didn't add until about 2.5 hours later when the beans were cooked through (since the acid in tomatoes doesn't let beans cook through).  Then I blended a little bit of the soup with an immersion blender just to make it a little smoother.  Can't wait to have it for lunch today!

YUM!!!! This is delicious w/ just the right amt of "spice." I had previously cooked the black beans, so used 8 C water vs the 10 C called for. Also, since I was busy, I put all ingred. in the crockpot & let it simmer away on low. I typically blend 1/2 of my soup(s) w/ an infusion blender to thicken, but I would NOT recommend that w/ this recipe b/c you'll get a grainy texture (I tried it). Also, I might suggest one remember that black beans are firm & need alot of soak/simmer time. I soaked mine overnight & also simmered for several hours b/c I like them on softer side.  THANX Angchick. This is a definite keeper!

I followed this recipe (I usually use a recipe as a guide) and it was very salty.  I wish I had read the review first that said to cut the salt in half, as I think that would have made it just right.

Wonderful, hearty soup!  I cooked my Christmas hambone in some water and 2 cans of chicken broth and then pulled the meat off and added the remainder of the ingredients (used canned beans).  I also put in a couple of chipotle chilies - WOW!  Really heated that broth up.  I ended up adding almost a full can of tomato juice and threw in some cooked white rice to cut down the fire.  Still had great flavor and warmed us up on a cold, rainy night!

Wow, this is good soup! I crumbled 5 strips of bacon instead of all that ham. I also added a 1/2 tsp of cumin and omitted the celery. This is  a fabulous, flavorful soup! Thanks for sharing!!

This soup has excellent, full flavor. One of the better black bean soup renditions I have had.   I made a few changes for my likes and what I had on hand: CHANGES 4 cans of beans, rinsed, only 4 cups of water, replaced the ham with 12 slices of turkey bacon, skipped the carrots, 2 diced roma tomatoes, and 2T tomato paste, 1/2 the salt fish sauce instead of worchetershire sauce.  ADDITIONS 1/4 t Epizote (mexican spice with enzymes to help digest the beans and stop or diminish unwanted after effects), 2T honey  Next time I think I'll add a jalepeno to the mix. This is so good I think I'll make a pot for the family gathering this weekend! Try it you will enjoy.

This was a great combination of flavors, but the texture could use some tweaking.  It wasn't as thick as I'd like.  Will make it again, but will probably puree some of the beans to improve the thickness.

This is the best black bean soup I've ever had. It was a tad salty for me, so I will experiment with decreasing the salt by 1/2 tsp or so. I used a pound package of smoked sausage instead of the ham. Everything else I did as listed. Wow! Great soup.

This soup is very good and very bold in flavor.  Even more awesome the next day.  I may try using diced tomatoes with green chiles next time for even more spice.  Thanks Angela!

I made this recipe today and my husband and I loved it. However, I reduced the salt by more than 1/2 so that is why I only gave 4 instead of 5 stars. I modified the recipe, based on most other reviewers comments and my own personal tastes. I only used one chicken bouillon cube, I reduced salt to 1/4 tsp., I used 1/4 tsp of celery seed instead of 1 tsp celery salt. I do not like Bay leaves so I omitted them. I also added ham and 1/2c chopped chiorizo sausage. Because of the spicy sausage and the fact that we like a little bit of heat, and not a lot, I only used 1/8 tsp of cayenne.  I soaked the beans in water for 6 hours before using them also. I think this is a wonderful recipe, even though I made those minor changes, I was really impressed with the aroma and complex flavors of this soup. Thanks for submitting it!

Oh my gosh....this is so good! I had almost everything on hand, it took no time to prepare and it was delicious. This is one of the few times that I followed the recipe exactly and I'm glad I did. I wouldn't change a thing. Make this, you won't be sorry.

This is a great recipe! I am used to a thicker soup so I didn't use as much water (8 cups instead of 10) and I used a pressure cooker to shorten the cooking time. I garnished it with lots of chopped fresh celantro and served it with cornbread. I liked it so much I had to make it again 2 days later!

I made this yesterday and it got mixed reviews.  I think I must not be a big fan of black beans but my hubby is and he really loved it.  My 4 yr old son wouldn't have any part of it and my 6 yr old daughter took a taste and called it "dirty".  I must admit I had a hard time getting past the unappetizing way it looks.  The flavor tho is really good and the leftovers will probably taste even better.  I only put half the ham it called for, omitted the salt and put only half the celery salt.  To suit myself better since I really didn't care for the black beans, I will try the same recipe only substitute pinto beans.

I made this soup in my slow cooker following the recipe almost exactly.... I used half of the salt and added the tomatoes after the beans had cooked as others had suggested. It was fantastic...a little on the spicy side which my family loves. It is definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing ANGCHICK !!

This soup was INSANE. SO good...I can't say enough good about it! I was out of dry beans so I ended up using two cans of black beans and two cans of black eyed peas in it. AWESOME. I also used andouille sausage instead of just regular ham...the subtle heat this added was out of this world. I HIGHLY recommend getting your hands on some good andouille for this recipe.

My two year old and three year old gobbled it right up (but they eat a lot of spicy food) and my husband couldn't stop talking about it and he is normally way "souped out" by this time of the year.

OH! Also, I added about a third cup of rice...which was very good and left out the carrots. Also I sauteed the onions, celery, garlic, etc in the bottom of the pan in butter before adding the rest of the stuff. 

This soup was unbelievable. Seriously, make it. NOW!

this is an excellent black bean soup recipe!  At first glance you might think it has too much garlic, but don't skimp---it adds a nice mellow flavor.  this is seasoned very well--just a bit different from your average black bean soup recipe.

OK......so this is my first time with bean soup.  I knew I loved it but I had to make it for a sick relative as well as feeding my family.  And --- all I had was one can of black beans and one can of kidney beans!!!  This is the best recipe I've made from this site and I've made a lot! I used( these are my changes)  6 cups chicken broth, 3/4 cup bacon bits (all I had) and one can of diced tomatos with 1/2 cup fresh diced.  This is a great recipe and I served with cheddar bay biscuits from AR and a lovely green salad.  Enjoy and thanks.

This was VERY good. Next time I'll put it all in the crock pot so I don't have to monitor for burning. Made brown rice to go with it and froze half as it's only my hubby and I. Definitely a Make-Again.

I made this as written. It was so salty I couldn't eat it. Looking again at the recipe I should have known: 2 tsp salt, 1 tsp celery salt, 2 boullion cubes, and pound of ham - no wonder! I will not be making this again.

This soup is soooo delicious.  I agree it isn't very spicy, but very very flavorful. I left out the salt and used only 8 cups of water.  Also, instead of covering it the entire time it cooked, I left it uncovered to help it thicken more so. You will not be sorry you tried this recipe! It's one of the best soups I've had!

Very delicious! I simmered two hamhocks in the water the night before and skimmed off the fat the next morning. Other than eliminating the tomatos, I followed the recipe adding only a little sherry at the end. I also used my "Thunder Stick" to puree the beans and then let the soup simmer (without the lid) for about another hour to thicken up. We topped the soup with scallions, avacado, jalapeno peppers and shredded jack cheese. Thanks Angela!

After reading the reviews.  I made a few changes:
1) Used low-sodium chicken broth
2) Used Smoked Turkey neck instead of ham
3) Chopped Carrots not shredded
4) No bay leaf or ground mustard, didn't have any
5) Added salsa, extra cayenne pepper, jalapeno
6) used dried beans, didn't soak .

It turned out very good.  Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious!  I added more spices than called for (may just be that mine are old) and used bacon instead of ham and no celery (no celery or ham in Albania) and used extra garlic instead of adding so much garlic salt.  I also took Karen's advice into account and cooked everything but the bouillon, salt, and tomatoes until the beans were just about cooked through and then added them.  I put some yogurt on top when serving it to help with the heat (I made mine pretty spicy).  Great winter meal and super easy

Everyone in our family loved this recipe (including my kids who were eating it for the first time)!  Stuck close to the recipe as written.  Reduced salt a little, no celery salt (as I had none) and added a little shake of cumin.  Topped with shredded cheese (a little cilantro for myself).

Didn't have time to do the long cooking version so I made the following changes. 2 cans black beans, added browned 1/2 lb. ground Italian sausage instead of pork, omitted celery salt and garlic powder...used more fresh garlic, used Coleman's mustard instead of dried...all the herbs make this very flavorful. Also served with shredded aged cheddar, sour cream and chopped shallots. Delicious.

The reason I gave this recipe 4 out of 5 stars is that the instructions did not tell the reader about the overnight or quick method soaking of the black beans prior to cooking. Otherwise, with that said it was wonderful. I made a few changes using chipotle boullion cubes in lieu of chicken, 8 cups of water instead of 10, and replacing table salt with kosher and only using 1 tsp. I also diced the carrots instead of shredding and added fresh homegrown cayenne pepper. This recipe does make a lot so I froze the leftovers for another evening when I do not have time to cook. One final thought, I recently spoke with a nutritionist who told me that the darker the bean the higher anti oxidants.....so eat lots of black beans :0)

This was awesome my husband and I loved it! I made it for dinner last night to go with a Spanish tortilla. I did have to make a few changes I used canned black beans and I didn't have any ham so I used smoked sausage.  Instead of canned diced tomatoes I used some tomatoe sauce. I also pureed half the  soup

This soup was delicious. Since it's just me & my husband, the batch was a multi-night meal. I omitted the regular salt when cooking it, and when reheating, I added a few more of the spices to freshen it up. It tasted just as good reheated as it did the day it was made! Thanks for the recipe!!! :)

Wow! This is fantastic! Used chicken broth instead of water and bouillon (always) and only used 6 cups because we like hearty "stoups". Only used 1 tsp. Of salt and diced tomatoes with green chilis added. Soaked the beans overnight and threw everything in the slow cooker in the morning. Cooked all day on low and gave it a quick spin with the immersion blender. LOVED this soup. Definite keeper!

One of the easiest and most flavorful black bean soup recipes ever. Did a couple slight changes: Sweated the onion, celery, carrots and garlic in a splash of olive oil before adding the rest of the ingredients. After the soup cooled a bit, I used a stick blender briefly to puree it a little to make a creamier base. This is a keeper.

Very Good and very easy. I pureed the soup after it was done cooking. I put it into a glass blender and slowly and carefully pureed the hot liquid.  It was scrumptious! Plus a dollop of sour cream on the top was great!

Was not nearly as spicy as I expected.  It needs more cayenne or something to spice it up.  I added a can of green chiles for a little extra kick.

Excellent! I will be making this again. Just a couple of small changes to the original recipe: made broth from a ham bone instead of using chicken broth; also, I saute'd onion in olive oil along with extra minced garlic and left out any dried garlic.

Hmmm... Do you think they meant "herby" when they said spicy?  As written this is a definite 4.5 star recipe.  I ended up doctoring it up with way more cayenne and after simmering for a while it seemed to thicken up to the non soup point so added a little more water.  Also threw in some fresh spinach.  Great flavor.  Maybe next time I'll add some corn.

I didn't feel it was that spicy.  I doubled the garlic.  I did like the flavor.

Awesome flavor!  I chopped the carrot's instead of shredding, and used a four blend peppercorn grind as I am out of Cayenne.  Garnished soup with shredded cheddar and sour cream.  A big hit with my family!  Tomorrow we'll have the thickened leftovers in tortilla wraps.  
Thanks for a great soup recipe Angela!

I really liked this soup.  I made a few changes though...I cut the carrots instead of shredding them, and used canned black beans.  I must have put a lot of pepper in there because it was really spicy! I only boiled it for 45 minutes or so...I find I never have 2 hours to cook dinner...and it was still good! Cant wait to try it again tonight because I am sure the flavors are even better. :)

Spicy?I wouldn't quite call it that... Delicious and easy yes! i had it with tortilla chips and monterey jack cheese. My four year old didnt call it dirty... she cleaned the bowl... If you are expecting spicy however add more pepper.. Otherwise good recipe.. lose a star for making me think it would be spicy....Kudos for not needing to soak the beans overnight

First time using this recipe. One exception is I used a ham hock I happened to have from Thanksgiving. Can’t make beans without pork... just an old habit. don’t know what Karen In DE is talking about I’ve always put tomatoes in my beans and there’s never been a problem with them cooking thoroughly.

Love this tasty recipe.  Spices are different from the typical Mexican flavors. There is no cumin in this recipe.

I have made this a couple of times now, with good results. I used about 1&1/2 lb of a bone in ham and simmered that along with the herbs and the washed beans in a quart of home made chicken stock plus enough water to cover. (there is no need to soak dried beans, just rinse and cook but don't add anything acidic, ie tomatoes, until your beans are tender.) After the beans were cooked, I adjusted the spices and added my tomatoes, a little Rotel with green chiles, shredded the ham, and simmered another hour or so. The spice mix in the recipe is very good, but I added about 1/2 tsp of cumin. Cayenne is optional, and as others have mentioned, this would be a good recipe to experiment with different peppers. Served with a sweet corn bread.....awesome for a cold winter night. Thanks!

This is a great belly warming recipe. We like ours with a little less salt, so we left that out, and we like it a little spicy, so we added more Cayenne powder and a couple whole dried ones too. Cooked all day, slowly on the woodstove and it was great. Definitely make this one again!

Way too salty and calls for the tomatoes to be added at the beginning which messes up the cooking process for dry beans. The broth had a nice flavor under the saltiness, but the salt definitely makes it inedible.

I don't know if I did something wrong but I can tell that this recipe should be good but mine has a funny after taste kinda metallic. Any advice on what that could be and how to fix it?

Loved this!  After reading other commenters, I left out the salt completely, and swapped the ham for spicy Italian sausage (which I had on hand).  I used dried beans, so only added the tomatoes after the first hour of cooking.  Will definitely make this again!

Just finished this. Wish I had read the reviews first!!! (I usually do). Ok, Next time, I will not add the salt, add cayenne to taste (I ended up uses a ton more, but I didn't measure it). Blend about 2/3 of the "soup" then sitr it all together. I had to add three more cups of water too, but it's delicious!!! Also, will add the tomatoes at the end... my beans are a little tough

Used my leftover Easter ham bone. The grated carrots totally disappeared in this soup, so I would slice them instead. Despite the name. I did not find this spicy at all, but it was pleasantly seasoned. This did make a ton of soup, and by the end of the week we were getting a pretty tired of this.  I would either cut this recipe in half or plan on freezing some.

I'm giving this a 4 instead of a 5 because I read the reviews beforehand and cut way back on the salt as suggested by others. If I hadn't, it would have been entirely too salty. The only other thing I did differently (again to cut down on sodium) was to replace the chicken bouillon and some of the water with reduced sodium chicken broth. This was a tasty soup and I will definitely make it again. Thank you!

This soup is absolutely delicious and it couldn't be any easier.  I followed the recipe almost exactly except I used fresh parsley and I added about a half a cup of red wine.

Maybe I undercooked the beans.  Maybe it was too spicy.  I don't know.  My wife, who loves spicy food said it was good.  However, it stayed in the freezer forever; neither she nor I apparently were enthused enough about the soup the defrost the pint containers we use.  Thus, six months after making it, I must say, "Ho-hum" and give it two stars.
