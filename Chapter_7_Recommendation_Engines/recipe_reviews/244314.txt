As the submitter suggested, I used a different sweetener (stevia) and substituted the Starbuck's Via pack for the espresso. Delicious afternoon pick-me-up while I read!

I changed the honey to 1/4 of sugar.   I had regular almond milk so added 1 tsp. of vanilla.  I thought it tasted pretty good, maybe a bit thin b/c of almond milk in which case I might suggest a bit less ice.  But, easy, satisfying to kids and probably saved me $12 at least since I made it for myself and my two boys instead of going to Starbucks!

Love this! Used regular almond milk and vanilla extract instead along with cold brew concentrate (about 3 ounces) and it was delicious! Will do it again!
