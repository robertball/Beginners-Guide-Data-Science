I got this recipe from the package of the chocolate Ready Crust.  Choco & raspberries usually go well together, but though not bad, I'd never make this again.  The cream cheese taste was completely overwhelmed by the other flavors even though I used an 8-oz pk, not 6.  Maybe more cream cheese, less choco would be better - Ready Crust needs to work on this one.

In spite of other comments I thought raspberry, cream cheese, and chocolate went very well together! I just added a bit more lemon juice because I thought the cheese cream was too sweet otherwise. I'll definitely make it again.

I had this dessert for New Year's Day dinner and thought it was really great!  Everyone there asked for the recipie and it was gone in a flash.  It was very rich and being so rich it could serve more than 8 people.  All you need is a small slice.

Very easy and quick to make. Everyone loves it.
I have had several people ask for the recipe. It
works better with fresh raspberries. If you use
frozen raspberries make sure they are thawed and
drain them well as the juice will make the crust
soggy.

This is one of the easiest and most elegant looking cheesecake recipes I've found on allrecipes.com; however, I'm afraid something's lacking in the taste department. I'm not a big fan of semi-sweet chocolate, so maybe that's why ... it just didn't seem to go very well with the raspberries. And if I made it again, I'd definitely use a homemade crust. The "Ready crust" was convenient, but nothing special. Other than that, it's an okay recipe -- not one of those desserts that "disappear," though.

This recipe is ok but I will try other cheesecake recipes.  The combination wasn't quite right and the texture was quite right either.

This recipe looked so good that we thought that we would try it for Thanksgiving Dinner.  However, it was not a big hit with our guests.  In fact, most was left on their plates after the first bite.  The rasberry/chocolate/cheesecake combination did not taste good together.  We will not be keeping this in our recipe box.

This is one fabulous recipe! I was skeptical because some of the other reviews, but I'm so glad I made it anyway! I used a bit more raspberries than called for....delicious!

I've used both Keebler and generic brand chocolate crusts, and the only difference is that the latter is much more economical.  My daughter, who's never liked cheese cake, loved this delicious treat!

An easy delicate cheesecake pie. Ready in no time, yet tasty as well as impressive for company. Will make it again. Used frozen raspberries, thawed, and a homemade graham crust.

This was an easy dessert to make, looked beautiful, and tasted delicious. I am not very fond of raspberries, and I loved it. I will probably use the chocolate topping "recipe" to top other cheesecakes as well. Thank you!
