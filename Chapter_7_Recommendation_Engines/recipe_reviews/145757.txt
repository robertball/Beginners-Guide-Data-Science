I submitted this original recipe, and I want to warn you that the amounts of nutmeg and pepper were too much (compared to my original recipe)!!!  This is definitely a taste-as-you-season sauce!  Start with 1/4 tsp. of each and build up from there as you taste!  Thanks for trying my recipe :)  As with any recipes on this site, it's a good idea to use your own judgement when it comes to any ingredients--it's also nice when people put tips for improvements in their posts!

"Kohl" is german for cabbage and "Kohlrabi" is a german word. Thus saying, kohlrabi will taste like cabbage or Broccoli... Great recipe - just like we do it here in Germany. I didn't put any cream in or did I let the sauce cook the extra 10 min. After the sauce thickened enough, I put in the kohrabi. The extra flavor in the sauce comes from using the drained cooking water for it!

Today was 'try a new vegetable' day.  This dish was very tasty, and the nutmeg was indeed a nice touch.  I steamed mine for 8 minutes instead of boiling, but I don't think it would make a huge difference.  I didn't have any cream but didn't substitute anything either.  I eyeballed everything in the sauce, pretty much, but the quote from the husband is "hardly ever does a vegetable taste that good". It seems to have a cabbage-like flavor over potato-like texture.  I'll be saving this and will serve it to company at next chance.  

A warning to those who are new to the lumpy purple thing like me:  there were some infrequent fibrous bits present, which I attributed to my being a kohlrabi-peeling novice.

This recipe looked appealing as I've just been exposed to kohlrabi.  I agree with another reviewer that being a novice when peeling I didn't get all the fibrous peeling out.  HOWEVER, I found that the 2 tsp of white pepper was way too much -- making the dish inedible.  However, I will try again without adding the pepper.

I would have given this a higher rating if it wasn't for the white pepper.  I should have realized before I added it to the sauce that it was too much.  I don't really like my food spicy hot and even if I did, the amount of pepper is overwhelming.  That's all I tasted.  I'm going to make this again, but this time, just a dash of the pepper.  The sauce did have a lovely creamy flavor/texture that complemented the kohlrabi.

I saw kohlrabi in the store today for the first time in years, and looked up the recipe here as a memory enhancer.  My German Nana used to make it this way with one addition.  She always boiled the green leaves in a separate pot until soft; drained and then chopped them; and mixed them into the cooked, sliced bulbs and sauce.  It added an extra dimension to the flavor.  If you have too many bulbs for the number of people, you can freeze them (raw or cooked without the sauce) in a freezer bag for another time.

This was good.  I remember eating this at Juergen and Britta's house often in Germany.  It was one of my favorite dishes at their house.   I couldn't find any here in the US, but I grew some myself this year.  Just like cabbage (which it is) it grows well and is one hearty plant.  I don't remember it tasting so much like cabbage, in fact at the time I had no idea it was cabbage, but she sliced it thinner than I did and I believe she cooked it more than I did.  Next time I'll boil it longer, and maybe not save the 1 cup water.  I've got more Kohlrabi so I'll perfect it over time.  I tried to go conservative on salt and pepper due to another review, but needed to add more after it was done.  I added a little black pepper too.  The seasoning depends on how much Kohlrabi you have, etc, so you have to season to taste.  It was good, but I think the good company also made it better in Germany.

This is the first time I've made kohlrabi and we (my husband and I) loved it fixed this way.  I didn't have the cream for the sauce, so I just added a little more butter and thickened it more with a little bit of cornstarch.  The flavor of the nutmeg came through nicely.  This one's a keeper!

Fantastic!!! I got my first vegetables from the CSA (community sponsored agriculture) for the year and had no idea what to make with kohlrabi and potatoes. I did a Google recipe search and it brought me this tasty, filling, vegetarian dish. Wonderful!! I recommend making this with less than the listed amount of kohlrabi - I used only one but kept the rest of the recipe the same (needed a touch more flour to thicken the sauce though.) It makes it very saucy which is great for ladling over sauteed scalloped potatoes. Yum! This recipe has made me a die hard kohlrabi fan! Thanks!

I give this a "3" as overall, it was a good recipe.  I liked the texture of the kohlrabi cooked, as I have always ate it raw with a little salt, like a radish.  I took others advice and cut the pepper in half and the teaspoon seemed to give it a good pepper kick.  I'm not a big fan of nutmeg, so I did not enjoy this like I thought I would.  I will definitely try again, but omit the nutmeg and maybe add some red pepper, and maybe thyme and basil.  Thanks for giving me something new to try!  I am always looking for something different.

Nice flavor. Never had this veggie before. It's very good. I sprinkled the seasoning in until it looked and tasted right.. used black pepper.

This was my first kohlrabi dish ever.  It was pretty good - I didn't love the tast of the kohlrabi itself (tastes like broccoli stems) but the sauce was good.  I'd make it again this way.

Not a great recipe.  Bought a kohlrabi at the Farmers Market and tried this recipe.  Much like creamed potatoes, only not as tasty.  Next time, I will just use the potatoes.  Kohlrabi not to our taste.

Kohlrabi is not sold in stores and I found it at the farmers market. I was thrilled! Then I was wondering if the sauce would be here on the website. I couldnt tell you how excited I was to have it available on line. My family is from Germany and we had this all of the time growing up. I just can't make it. We just had an exchange student from Germany and I asked his mom to make the white sauce if I was to buy califlower. She brough back many happy memories of all the wonderful dinners that my mom made. I will use this again and again. I added more pepper and that's just a personal taste. You did wonerful and now I can make it !!

Yuck. I LOVE kohlrabi but this sauce was terrible.  I ended up washing the sauce off of my kohlrabi so it didn't go to waste.

With the reduced amount of nutmeg and white pepper (about 1/4 tsp of each), this was tasty.

My Mom used to make kohlrabi in a white sauce, so this is pretty much what I was looking for.  I didn't use nutmeg because I'm not a big fan, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I agree with the other reviews.  I should have realized that it was too much pepper.  Other than that.....just like Mom's

This dish was great. But I modified it in my own way.  I don't drink milk and didn't have it or cream on hand and so substituted almond milk and almond butter.  It was fantastic.  The nuttiness of the almond perfectly complemented the earthiness of the kohlrabi.  I, of course, still used butter.  I mean, really, I'm crunchy, but nothing beats butter.

Good recipe, I used white pepper to taste.  Next time I will cook the kohlrabi to tender.
