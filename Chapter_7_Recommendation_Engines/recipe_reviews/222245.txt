I made these today.  Followed the recipe as written.  They were a big hit at our family fish fry.  Delicious, I wouldn't change a thing.

Thank you for sharing.   I followed the recipe as written, with the exception of adding two teaspoons of a cajun spice blend purchased locally.    These puppies were crispy, flavourful and bountiful.   We froze what we couldn't eat in a sitting.    They were just as crispy and tasty after a thaw and re-heat.

Thank you for the recipes !!! I made few changes to suit my kitchen stock and family's preference. I used 9 cups of the aunt jemima's corn flour mix (omit flour and corn flour and baking powder, it's what I had in stock), I did not have the pimento peppers so I omit it, I blended the onion and bell peppers because my kids and hubby don't like to eat onion chunks. They are so good and still good after frozen. Some tips for others : this recipes will make hundreds of hush puppies so you will spend hours on frying them. The hushpuppies will be bigger after frying so 6-8 tbs will make an apple or pear size, too big for my kids. A tablespoon is perfect for kids, will make a strawberry size hush puppies.

This was great as written.  Only substitution was I made it with
gluten free flour blend (tom sawyer or better batter work).  Was 
a quick and easy complement to a seafood feast.

These were fantastic. I found they made more servings than expected when I changed the number of servings and made a few adjustments based on what I had available.  Also, you need to make certain they cook all the way through.  If they brown lightly they're not quite done in the center. Be sure you brown them well.

I will make it again. Just need to learn better the shaping of wet dough and half the recipe.

I wanted to love these because the mix smelled so delicious.  They were just not flavorful enough, however.   We played with the mix adding seasonings and then frying one hush puppy at a time and tasting it.  We ended up adding more corn as well as onion powder and garlic powder - about two tablespoons each of the powders. Finally the raw cornmeal and flour taste was gone and they tasted very good.
