Okay, I signed up for this site, just so I can give my review of these cookies.  I own a deli and bake cookies for it all the time.  There are so many other incredible better peanut butter cookie recipes out there.  These were pasty and didn't have a strong peanut butter flavor at all, even though I was a little generous in measuring the peanut butter.  I'm going back to my recipe that I have tweaked to perfection.  I thought with 200 ratings on this recipe, that these would have been fantastic.  I was sorely disappointed.  :(

A lot of people love this recipe.  Some do not.  I think it is really good.  You don't need to add any extra flour to the recipe.  I will admit the batter is a bit more slack than a lot of people are used to.  Use a 1-ounce metal cookie scooper and you will have no problem with the dough.  Use a fork dipped in water to make the criss-cross design.  I did refrigerate some of the dough after scooping it and I found that it is actually easier to get a more uniform, pretty criss-cross design if you do it straight from the bowl without chilling.  The chilled dough did work okay, but it did crack on the sides and I had to push the sides together to make a uniform circle.  Also, check you oven temperature.  You cannot go by the time given.  Everyone's oven is different.  I baked mine at 350 degrees for 11 minutes and they were underdone and delicate/broke apart.  But, I baked a second batch for 16 minutes and they are perfect.  They don't fall apart and are still soft in the center and crisp on the edges with nice color.  I bake professionally for an upscale private club and none of our recipes have time listed.  You have to be able to tell when it's done by how it looks and feels.  Baking can be tempermental.  Mixing methods, ingredients, environment, humidity, and a whole host of other things affect your recipe.  The same recipe can come out differently every time if you don't pay attention to things like the weather, brands, heavy footfalls, etc.

MMM, delicious!! How do I even begin to rave about these? A great, strong, peanut butter flavor, and perfectly soft and chewy. I've never had a peanut butter cookie so wonderful, and everyone in my family thought they were absolutely the best ever. When I was making them, I was a bit worried at first, because the batter looked quite soupy - almost like a pure, creamy peanut butter - But dont worry, they turn out! Also, I accidently really burnt the bottom of my first batch. It worked best for me to put them on the top shelf in the oven, and to take them out at 7 minutes and 45 seconds (the bottom edge looks slightly brown - but don't wait for the top to brown too much or the bottom will burn). They are a bit crumbly at first, so you may not think they are done. But once they cool, trust me! You'll be amazed. MMMM. 10 stars. Oh- Also, don't half the recipe, You'll be sorry you did. Make the entire amount called for in the recipe. :)

These are just delicious.  What makes them so is that there is twice as much peanut butter as butter - -most peanut butter cookies recipes call for equal amounts of both. Great recipe Joey!

Great texture! Cheap PB works - but you can taste the difference when you use good the quality, rich stuff. Skip the milk...not needed, and I also added a little more flour (1/4 C). Good consistency to roll into balls, then flatten with fork. Try to stay away from dipping the fork in flour first - doesn't help much, and adds unnecessary flour. If your fork sticks to the dough - you probably need to add a LITTLE more flour. If you've added the extra flour - and want to keep your cookies chewy, then take them out of the oven a 1-2 minutes early - then before they completely cool, place them in an air-tight container.

This is a keeper. My roommate, who doesn't like sweet cookies, flipped for these cookies. Perfect texture: thick, soft, and crunchy (I used extra crunchy processed PB). I like cookies a little sweeter; adding 1/8 cup extra granulated sugar will make them sweeter and just a tad bit crisper. I tried several different baking pans. They came out perfectly on heavy, shiny, stainless steel sheets. I made them bigger than the dinky tablespoon drop called for in the recipe and baked for 15 mins. Those who are finding them undercooked are probably using insulated baking sheets.  Those who are burning the bottoms too easily are probably using the regular nonstick pans you find everywhere.  It's all about the sheets.  You might also try moving the pan nearer the top of the oven and baking a little longer. The dough is really sticky; chilling helps a little.  I didn't add more flour but just settled for irregular edges.

This is the BEST peanut butter cookie recipe I have ever made in my life.  They are not dry like most peanut butter cookies, very peanut buttery.  I actually improved on it by adding about 3 small bags of Reese's Pieces to the dough, and instead of flattening with a fork, I flattened them with the bottom of a glass dipped in flour.  Suprisingly, the Reese's Pieces held their shape.  Oh so good!  If you love PB the way my husband does, you must try this recipe.  Definately a keeper!!!

Wow!  They are the best! I didn't use quite a cup of peanut butter because it just looked like too much, but they were fantastic!  The dough was very fluffy (I used my Kitchenaid mixer), but workable. I rolled them in sugar and made the traditional criscross design.

Make a double batch if you're a cookie lover!

These cookies turned out really good. I used the Pampered Chef medium scoop to drop onto cookie sheet to eliminate the stickiness.  Also sprinkled them with sugar after I criss-crossed with fork.  Mine turned out chewy on the inside and a little crisp on the outside...just perfect.  They were a hit at my office.

I've been baking since a child, so well over 60 years.  I've used the Better Homes & Garden Peanut Butter Criss Cross recipe forever, they sell by request at bake sales, family and friends want them. I can't eat just one.  These, I could eat one.  The batter tastes better then the cooked cookie, which tells me the right things aren't going on chemically when they bake. I agree with the professional baker's review, pasty tasting and they do NOT melt in your mouth.  Batter looked perfect, even tried longer cooking at 350.  Nope, my taste buds prefer my 'melt in your mouth', irresistable BH&G cookies. These are going out for the birds and squirrels.

I just made these and I have to say that this recipe made one of the easiest and best peanut butter cookies I've ever made. I have to say that I wrote this recipe down in a hurry and wrote down baking soda instead of baking powder. That didn't affect these cookies at all. I didn't have one single issue with these at all. I did worry just a bit because the batter was so loose and fluffy but I used my spring loaded cookie scoop and it was cake. No issues at all. I will say that the baking temp might be a little too high, as these did have a tendancy to cook too fast and scorch so next time, I'll cook these at 350. That could be my oven. I will say from prior experiance that I've used off brand or store brand peanut butter in cookie recipes like this before and it will produce a bad peanut butter cookie. I wonder if some of the less favorable reviews could have been because name brand peanut butter was not used. Really great peanut butter cookie recipe that is quickly made, no need to chill and works with simple pantry items. GREAT recipe!

Made these for Xmas and everyone loved them! I prepped the dough into logs, wrapped in wax paper and refrigerated until cookie day with the girls.  When it was time, we just sliced and baked.  Some were thicker and softer.  Some were thinner and a little crisper.  All of them delicious!  This raw dough is outrageously good....like home made peanut butter candy!  Will make again.

Ridiculously scrumptious cookies!  Very simple recipe that I followed to the T.  I made them into balls of about a tablespoon each and dropped them onto a parchment-paper-lined pan instead of flattening them with a fork, which can be time consuming.  I used margarine instead of butter with great results.  I got about 55 small cookies.  I also baked them at 350 degrees, because I bake all my cookies at that temperature.  There is less chance of them burning.  I left them in the oven approximately 8 minutes then let them cool on the pan so they could set.  Great, chewy recipe that I will most definitely make again.

Like the famous tiger says, "They're Grrrrrrrreat!" I just got done making these. The last batch is in the oven right now! I followed the recipe exactly. I used organic sugar & peanut butter, but I don't really think it affects the outcome in any way (just healthier!). They're soft and taste Mmm-mmm! They have a terrific peanut-buttery taste. I read reviews for OTHER peanut butter cookie recipes and most of the complaints were b/c the cookies weren't peanut-buttery enough. Well, NOT WITH THIS RECIPE! So if that's a problem for you, try this recipe. (I sprinkled mini-choc. chips on a dozen and they turned out great too!)

Excellent! I made a double batch and accidentally added 2 tsp of baking soda instead of baking powder. When I realized my mistake, I added teh baking powder that the recipe called for, and the combination seemed to work magically! I also added 1 1/2 bags of mini chocolate-chip morsels and dusted the warm cookies with sugar. I was making these for a party and just had to "accidentally" break a few so that I could guiltlessly keep more for myself!

These were really creamy and good.  I used organic natural peanut butter and assume that makes them a bit better than the usual sugared PB.  Didn't yield 36 cookies though.  More like 24.  I will definitely make these again.

These really are the best peanut butter cookies I've made and I've made them a lot! They're soft, fluffy, moist and very peanutty. I add a cup of chocolate chips to the batter which makes them absolutely delicious. I was also concerned about how wet the batter was but no worries, they turn out great. They are NOT oily and even though they are soft they didn't fall apart. Thanks for this recipe, I don't have to look anymore :)

Oh, my!  So very yummy.  I add milk chocolate chips and tell my boys they are "Reeses" cookies.  By the way, don't bother to roll out in balls -- just use cookie scooper and bake on parchment paper.  Simple and NO MESS.  I'll do anything to avoid a mess.  :))

I didn't see the big deal with these cookies. I think they need more flour... they were a little flavorless and the consistency wasn't right.. they were very moist, but something was missing. I will keep searching for the perfect peanut butter cookie!

I followed this recipe to the T! The dough was way to sticky and the cookies were crumbly and tasted like a grainy biscuit instead of a cookie. Not sure what went wrong but definitely not trying to make these again.

I made these cookies for my husband 2 weeks ago and he is still talking about them. He loved them. He even took them to work and his co workers loved them too. The one guy even admitted he didn't like peanut butter cookies but he said these were the best ones he has had.

After reading the submitter's caption on this recipe I was hoping my search for the perfect peanut butter cookie had come to an end. I was looking for a chewy-on-the-inside and crisp-on-the-outside cookie and this turned out cake-like. Even though this called for a whole cup of peanut butter, the peanut butter flavor didn't shine through enough for us. If you like a super soft cookie then this is the one for you.  Not a bad cooke, just not one of my favorites.

***A few pointers: I signed up for this site just to review these cookies- I don't know how the person that gave it 1 start screwed it up, but this recipe is fantastic!!!  I just want to add a few pointers to make sure everyone has cookies as good as mine.  First- the consistency of the dough should be such that you can make little balls without the dough sticking to your hands.  If your dough is too sticky, keep adding flour until it reaches this point.  Second- make sure that you let them cool sufficiently on the tray before you remove them with a spatula- if you do this too soon they will tear or smush up because they are super soft.  Once they have cooled on the cookie sheet, move them to aluminum foil and continue to let them cool.

Très bon! I made these for Belgian friends and family (all of whom HATE peanut butter!) and they went wild! They were a huge hit and are already all gone - I should have made a double batch! This is now my favorite peanut butter cookie!

these were really good. I put the batter in the fridge for about 20 mins and rolled them into balls, and used a fork for decoration. Make sure you take them out when they are barely golden so that they stay super soft! yummy

These cookies are by far the best PB cookie I have ever had. Right out of the oven perfect, cooled, even better! 
I chilled the dough for about 45 minutes and kept it in the fridge while one batch baked. I lowered the temp to 300 and baked for about 12-13 minutes. They are golden and chewy with a wonderful texture. I have searched long and hard for a recipe like this. Thanks!

This recipe was simple and delicious. I didn't have the brown sugar so I substitued with 1 cup of sugar. I know it wasn't the same as the original but mine came out great all the same! I can only imagine how great they would have been with the brown sugar. I look forward to making them again (with b sugar). Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

These are great cookies. The peanut butter flavor is light, which is nice if you don't like to be overpowered by peanut butter flavor. They turn out soft and chewy and crispy on the outside. yum yum!

These cookies were amazing!  Loved them! Soft, moist, and delish.

If you follow the recipe exactly then the batter seems gooey.  However, if you refrigerate the batter for a short period of time (15-20 minutes) before you roll the cookies into balls it helps immensely.  Alternatively, just spoon balls of gooey batter onto your pan, it comes out great!

Made these to surprise my husband coming home from duty and what a disappointing surprise :( . They didn't taste like much other than grainy flour with a hint of peanut butter. They were neither gooey nor crunchy but much like damp sand that somehow manages to stick together. I did not make any changes to the recipe, followed it word for word.

This recipe was alright, but I wouldn't recommend it.  The cookies aren't chewy or soft like advertised in the 5 star reviews. The dough was alright and tasted good as dough, but once I rolled into 1" balls and baked for 7 minutes, they became dry and some burned lightly on the bottom.  They didn't have as much peanut butter taste as expected. As my brother would say "the taste of the Sahara baked into every bite"

I tried other recipes on this site to make peanut butter and chocolate chip cookies but none had that peanut butter flavor I was looking for so I decided to try this recipe and add the chocolate chips, and WOW – just what I was looking for.  I had to make these a couple times in one week because they went so quickly.  Didn’t change the recipe, just added dark chocolate chips. 
Advice – Use a cookie scoop, don’t over bake, leave on the cookie sheet for a few minutes before removing carefully with a THIN spatula (the cookie will firm up once completely cooled on wire rack).  Once cooled, transfer to a freezer zip lock bag and keep in refrigerator, they are soooo good that way, trust me.  And lastly, make a double batch and dont forget the chocolate chips :).

These peanut butter cookies are tasty and rich. I baked them for 8 minutes.. they were soft and crumbled in your mouth. Really tasty and had a perfect texture. Next time I might try baking for 7 minutes for even softer cookies. The dough is a tad sticky and pretty hard to roll into balls using 1 1/4cups flour, so I increased the flour to 1 1/2cups flour which made it just perfect for rolling into balls. If you don't want to add flour, you can also refrigerate the dough first or roll the dough in sugar then shape into balls.

These were not good. I am an experienced baker and make peanut butter cookies all the time. I wanted to try a new recipe... These tasted bland and NOT like PB. They also crumble, I can't believe they got a 4 star average! My husband won't even touch them, and he eats anything!

I made these with my grandbaby today.  It was easiest to make a double batch.  I used an 18 ounce jar of pb so I didn't have to measure.  We rolled the cookies in colored sugar and flattened slightly before baking.  They were very good on a silpat, 375 for 12 minutes.

I gave this recipe three stars because my husband said he thought they were "pasty." He rarely criticizes my cooking and he loves peanut butter. But, I liked them and will make them again. I do recommend adding a little cinnamon and nutmeg; chilling the dough for 30 minutes before forming the balls; lining the cookie sheets with parchment paper; and criss-crossing them with the tines of a fork. The dough does not spread much during cooking, so they can be pressed down quite a bit.

I was very disappointed in these cookies.  I used natural peanut butter so I am guessing maybe that is the problem.  My cookies turned out very dry and not very sweet.  I totally burned the bottoms of the first batch after about 8 minutes.  After that, I took them out in 5 or 6 minutes, and they didn't appear to be done.

Though I wouldn’t declare these the best peanut butter cookies I’ve ever had, they are still quite good! I used natural peanut butter when making these cookies (natural peanut butter is healthier and tastier than commercial brand-name peanut butter, in my opinion). To ensure the cup of peanut butter wouldn’t stick in my measuring cup, I greased my cup with nonstick cooking spray. I refrigerated the dough for about thirty minutes prior to putting it in the oven. The cooler the dough is, the less sticky it will be. Make sure you only bake the cookies for a maximum of ten minutes.

With a few minor tweaks these were almost perfect... sooo much better than the "classic" peanut butter cookies that aren't peanut-buttery enough. I followed the recipe exactly except for omitting the milk, because I wanted to be able to roll them with my hands. The dough was still slightly sticky, but when refrigerated in between batches it was perfect to work with. Baked for 8 minutes at 375 they were a tiny bit over-browned on the bottom, but 10 minutes at 350 was just right. They were sufficiently peanut-buttery, but needed an extra touch of sweetness, so I lightly rolled the remaining cookies in some extra white sugar before criss-crossing, and that was all they needed. This dough is a bit delicate, so let the cookies cool AT LEAST two minutes before removing them from the pan or they may crumble. They need time to set up. Also note that you can't judge the flavor of peanut butter cookies when they're too hot - the full flavor comes through when they are cooled. I believe the handful of people who found these bland mustn't have had enough patience to let the true flavor of these delicious cookies shine through. Once you let them cool COMPLETELY they are soft and chewy and the sandy texture disappears. Enjoy them slowly, if you can, and they are eye-rollingly good - the right combination of peanut-butteriness and sweetness.

My husband and I just made these as Christmas Cookies for the third time. After years of making peanut butter cookies that just weren't "peanut buttery" enough, we discovered this recipe in 2008. They are sooo peanut buttery!

Given all the reviews I was sure these would be phenomenal, but I was disappointed. I made them as stated, except for adding some peanut butter chips. The cookies are soft, but also a little dry and not super flavorful. If I try them again I will try adding more peanut butter and see if that helps moisten them up a bit.

Good recipe.  Nothing too spectacular.  I think the quality/type of peanut butter probably makes a big difference and thus the variety of opinions on this one.

Texture wise, these cookies were soft and perfect.  Easy and quick.  I would say that the peanut butter taste isn't that strong, and they could be sweeter.

I use this website daily.  However, this is the first time I insisted on reviewing a recipe immediately.  Initially I followed this recipe as written.  It was so bland .  I then did as others suggested and added more peanut butter. I did not care for this.

In light of all the glowing reviews, I'm sort of baffled at my own results. I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with a dough that was more like a batter - nearly too soft to "roll" into balls without it nearly oozing from between my fingers - had to work super quick and super light. The resultant cookies were way too flat with a gummy, sticky texture, so I added nearly a full cup of flour to the remaining batter and ended up with cookies that were just okay.

I wish I had read the reviews before I tried these.  I followed the directions exactly.  baked for ten minutes at instructed oven temp.   The middle of the cookie was too soft and raw and the bottom of the cookie was brown, I wouldn't have been able to bake them anymore.   the flavor was just ok,  very mile peanut butter flavor. sorry but these cookies are not to my family's liking.  I don't understand the high rating that you have received on them.

Awful. I will never use this recipe again. I followed it exactly, the cookies were baked perfectly and once they cooled, they turned into hockey pucks--rock hard, dry and crumbly.

I have been baking for over 20 years, and in all of my experiences with All Recipes, I have never come across a more poorly constructed recipe.  Temperature is too high, dough is not dough but soup -  they were scorched at 6 minutes - 2 under the rec. time.  I originally thought perhaps these were an airy change to the commonly dense and heavy version as indicated by the ingredients and method of preparation- sadly I was wrong.

Love 'em, love 'em, love 'em!  Took these to a potluck, and I even made them with low-fat butter spread because we ran out or regular butter, and they were gone in minutes.  They tasted even better with regular butter.  I will never make another peanut butter cookie recipe again.

This is an excellent cookie. Soft on the inside, and a tad crisp on the outside. I like to sprinkle a little bit of sugar on top immediately after taking it out of the oven. The only problem I have with this cookie is that it's not as great-tasting a day later. BUt definately the best peanut butter cookie recipe of the bunch here at allrecipes.

This recipe is A+++++!! Absolutely love it and it is my GO TO recipe for peanut butter cookies...I DO NOT use another recipe...There are only three things I do differently:
1: JIF PEANUT BUTTER ONLY...used a store brand once and they were not as good to me although no one else could tell the difference.
2: 350 degrees not 375
3: 8 minutes only. I LOVE a soft cookie and they stay soft this way
Other than that the recipe is GREAT as it stands!!! Definitely give them a try!

These were just ok.  I thought they weren't peanut butter-y enough, and a little too sweet.  They are very fluffy, which is nice, but I thought they were bland.  My husband said they were "all right," which is his way of saying "I'll eat them, but don't make them again."

I hate writing bad reviews, but honesty is the best policy right? Anyways, the cookies tasted really pasty, like one went overboard on the flour. There was hardly any peanut butter taste, which is the whole point of the cookie. Will be looking for a different pb cookie recipe. :(

Could not roll between hands, way to wet and gooey. just plopped onto baking sheet with spoons and flattened.  We prefer a thicker breadier cookie.  They were good but not our favorite.

Wonderful basic recipe. 4 stars because of the changes needed. I doubled the salt, omitted the milk, and added  1/2 tsp baking soda. The batter wasn't too thin, like some people had problems with. I put the dough right onto the pan, didn't refrigerate. Just used my fingers to scoop it up and form into balls. The cookies were a bit crumbly when they were still warm right off the pan, but they firmed up when they cooled. 
Lovely flavor. Did the first batch last night and a double batch today. Sending them to my mother-in-law as a Christmas present. :)

These were awesome.  Made as per the recipe, but added some leftover peanut butter chips.  Made larger sized cookies, so in my oven they took 12 minutes at 375 degrees.

Good recipe, I used my hens eggs but the rest was the same, turned out good, easier to scoop than other recipes. Used the pampered chef medium ice cream scoop and the pampered chef pizza stone and let them cool on the stone and they were great. Not burned and not too soft.

I made these for a small dinner party tonight and got rave reviews. My boyfriend can't stop eating them. I used natural peanut butter (Adams) and because it was a new jar, the cup I scooped out was pretty oily. Also melted the butter (unintentionally while softening it in the microwave) and added butterscotch chips. Very tasty. Just the right texture (I like crispy cookies, the boyfriend likes them practically raw) and they crumble just right in your mouth. Maybe not the BEST I've ever had, but my boyfriend asked me to write the recipe in my personal cookbook and told me they're better than his previous favorite of my cookie recipes.

I made these the first time almost exactly as the recipe says. They were perfect. The cooking time does vary, so my first batch was burnt, but the rest were fine as I adjusted the time.

The second time I made these, I omitted the peanut butter completely, and added 1 and 1/2 cups mini semi-sweet chocolate chips instead. They were PERFECT. Easily the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever had. Excellent recipe.

Very good!  I add a bit extra vanilla and a bit extra peanut butter. That said, I add a bit extra flour to compensate (on top of the bit that I add for high altitude - Colorado mountains).  Very good basic recipe though!

Fabulous cookies!!  These are the absolute best if you love soft peanut butter cookies!  I added frozen reese's mini peanut butter cups that i cut in half and I used natural crunchy peanut butter.  Next time I will make a double batch!

My family loves these cookies. I use crunchy peanut butter instead of creamy peanut butter and I also add chocolate chips. You cant really roll them into balls as suggested due to the runny texture of the batter but they are great all the same I also find that setting the oven to 350 instead of 375 really helps, if not the bottom burns too easy.

My cookies rolled easily into balls, looked just like the picture. I didn't like the texture at all.  They were neither chewy nor crunchy, more crumbly.  The only way I can think to describe it is like a super stale, heavy, grainy biscuit.   The flavor was pretty good, but I think I will stick with the flourless pb cookie recipes from now on.

I like this recipe because I don't have to chill the dough!  The cookies stay soft and moist, and don't get crusty.

These were very delicious! Unfortunately, when I put them through the cookie press they did not hold their shape when baked. Also, I think the cookies had a bit too much butter, the cookie press was leaking of it. Great taste, easy, chewy on the inside, crunchy on the out. Baked for 10 minutes and made blossoms out of them. *UPDATE* I doubled the recipe, but only used 1/4 cup pf butter. They held shape, too!

These are OKAY. They aren't gross, They just aren't anything to write home about.   I don't eat alot of cookies, so when I do I want them to be awesome.  My kids are gobbling them up, but I will look for another recipe to try next time I make peanut butter cookies.

These cookies were simple to make and pretty good, but not worth leaving my standby recipe for.  The dough was very slack, so I did end up adding more flour, which made for a sturdier, crunchier cookie.

These cookies are wonderful. I add honey and/or chocolate chips to the batter to get a little variety. My co workers,friends and family request these cookies.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.  If you have a large family or give them away you will want to double the batch.

These were truly tasty. I used Walmart generic brand chunky peanut butter and generic salted butter.  Worked perfectly and can't imagine this cookie tasting any better with higher priced products. The raw dough does not look regular cookie dough.  I was concerned about that and thought it would run all over the cookie sheet. I also expected the dough to be impossible to shape as it was so shapeless in the bowl. I wet my hands, then rolled the dough into balls.  Wet a fork, swirled it in sugar, then stamped each cookie with the traditional criss cross.  To my surprise, the cookies did not spread and totally held their shape.  I make chewy chocolate chip cookies a lot from a recipe from this site to which we are all addicted, but this recipe runs neck-and-neck as a close second. Probably best traditional peanut butter cookies I've ever made.... A keeper!

Great flavor.  Soft cookie that turned out more "dry" than moist and chewy.  I used an insulated pan and it took 14 min to bake.

This recipe rocked, and is replacing my old favorite (Mrs. Sigg's, which is awesome, but these are better.) I don't know why they didn't turn out for others, but these are the only cookies I've made here at 3500 ft above sea level that didn't come out flat. I doubled the recipe and used a whole jar of GV peanut butter, melted in the microwave so it would pour out of the jar. The batter looks a little greasy, but doesn't have any pools of oil or anything, and the cookies come out perfect. I use a cookie scoop for uniformity. I will be making these again and again!
**** Update. These were the best right out of the oven, but after they cooled, not as good as Mrs. Sigg's. I think I'll keep Mrs's Sigg's for a plain peanut butter cookie, and this one I'll add peanuts and peanut butter chips to for a chunkier cookie, since they rose so well.

I've been looking for a good peanut butter cookie recipe and I went with this one yesterday because I had all the ingredients on hand.  They were awesome!  I used a little more than a cup of peanut butter, and I used extra crunchy, instead of creamy.  I rolled them in superfine granulated sugar before putting on a cookie sheet, I think it helped the fork not stick when I did the cross-hatch design.  They were AMAZING!  I will use this recipe again and again.

No shortening! That's what I liked. I made these into bars by cooking the whole thing in a 7x11 dish at 375 for about half an hour. I have no patience for individual cookies. It worked great, even with just shy of a cup of peanut butter.

These are good.  I like that there is no shortening in them.  I added 1/2c of semi-sweet mini-chocolate chips; next time, I may add a little more.  I also subbed some of the A-P flour for whole wheat pastry flour.  These cookies seem to hold up after a couple of days and still taste good and have a good texture, which isn't always the case with cookies that often seem to change for the worse once they've cooled off.  Thank you, PL Weiss & Joey!

I only went with 4 stars because they were hard to bake. I cooked mine at 350 for 10-12 minutes. They didn't seem to brown on top so it was hard to tell if they were cooked.  They turned out better for me if I left them in a ball.  The peanut flavor was great.

I'm in love.  Each year, my friends and I get together and have a big bakathon, and these were one of my additions to the party.  I rolled them in tsp sized balls and rolled them in sugar and placed a Hershey kiss on after they came out of the oven.  They stayed so puffed, which looks really cute.  A honey of a recipe.

I have been baking for over 30 years and I really thought these were so easy to make! I made them exactly like the recipe and I also cooked some for a little longer becasue I prefer a little crunch to my cookie. The taste is really good! Super peanut buttery taste. 
I made some large cookies as well. I used about 1/4 cup of dough and flattend the dough to about 1/2 an inch thick. I flattened them with a fork dipped in sugar. These are like the peanut butter cookies you would buy from the Mrs. Fields cookie stands at the mall. Chewy and soft and very tasty. I also thought they were the perfect sweetness. Thanks for a great recipe!!!

I made the recipe as directed and the dough was so sticky that I could't handle it at all to make a ball. I was kind of concerned, I baked a mini-batch to see how it would come out. My boyfriend and I agreed that cookies were too light/crumbly and not peanut-buttery enough. I took the rest of the dough and added 1/3 cupish more flour and 1/2 cup more peanut butter. It was very stiff after that and I could easily roll and mash balls. I had to cool the cookies right on the pan because they were way too soft when hot to transfer, but we liked them much better once cooled! If you like a thicker, denser cookie try adding some more flour and peanut butter.

I never really liked peanut butter cookies, but I decided to make them for my husband because he loves them. They were absolutely delicious. I added just a little more of both brown and white sugars for a touch more sweetness and they came out great. My one year old can't get enough either

Absolutely DELICIOUS!! I added mini-chocolate chips and they turned out wonderful! Tasted like a Reese's and came out nice and chewy. I had to leave mine in for an extra 2 minutes or so because the first batch was a little undercooked. I didn't even bother with the using a fork to press them down and they still looked great.

These came out so crumbly that you couldn't even pick one up without it breaking into pieces. They were also very very oily. I've never had grease come out of a cookie before. One thing I'll give them is that the flavor was great but I wouldn't make these using this exacp recipe again. I might use this as a base for another recipe and adjust the ingredients. I'm an expert cookie maker and these just didn't work for me.

I halved the recipe, so that might have been why I found these tasteless and dry.The dough was too soft, extremely hard to work with, ended up adding more flour. Dip your fork in water to press the cookies.

Ok, Well I had more than my share of problems with this recipe.  If some one can help me I would be more than gratefull!  Not only did I only get a total of 26 cookies, they were basically flavorless and oily.  What did I do wrong?

What a waste of ingredients!  This is the worst peanut butter cookie recipe I have ever baked. I followed the recipe exactly,  but the end result was a dry and all but tasteless cookie.  I can't even think of a way to fix this recipe.

I recommend eating the dough before you add the flour, baking powder, and salt.  Don't even waste the time baking them.

I love these cookies so much that I actually bothered to sign in and review!

I first found this recipe sometime last year, and just picked it because it was the first one on the list that didn't need any ingredients I didn't have at the time.  Since then I've made it several times and each time I've liked it better then ever.  The cookies are soft and slightly chewy, without being overly so.  They aren't nearly as crumbly as most other peanut butter cookies I've had, and they actually seem to taste better as time passes so if you make a huge batch there's no problem if it's a couple of days before they're all gone.

My mom had some the last time she visited, not realizing when she first grabbed one that they were peanut butter, and was amazed to discover that even she liked them even though she's hated peanut butter cookies all her life!

I love peanut butter cookies but was disappointed with this recipe.  The flavor was ok but a little bland, and I didn't find them very soft.  I wouldn't recommend this recipe to people, but if you do make it, they're definitely better the first day; don't wait to eat them because they harden FAST.

My best friend Melissa & I spent the entire day baking several varieties of cookies. These were a huge disappointment. We couldn't even force our spouses to eat them. Very bland. Try ANY other peanut butter cookie recipe. We suggest "Favorite PB Cookies" by Anita. Go with God if you make these.

These cookies were OK. I added 1/2 cup of flour and also let the batter sit in the fridge for 1hr.  My first batch was crumbly and slightly "dry". Wanting a more chewy consistency, I added another 1/4 cup of packed brown sugar, 1/3 cup of peanut butter to the remaining batter and the second batch turned out VERY chewy and very peanut buttery.  My suggestion is to add additional peanut butter and brown sugar to acquire the desired chewiness and peanut butteriness.

Very chewy. I added a 1/4 cup of flour which made the dough a lot easier to deal with and allowed the cookies to be pressed with a fork without sticking. Very delicious!

Bingo!  Great peanutbuttery taste in a chewy cookie.  I've been searching for a recipe that is almost doughy inside with yet a thin crust on the outside.  This is it.  I read the other reviews and since the dough is indeed sticky, use a wet fork to mark.

This is a great recipe! Leaves a nice pnb taste in your mouth. You should be measuring out your flour by weight. 1 cup = 4. 25 oz's. It wouldn't hurt to run it through a sieve to aerate it too.

Wow!  What a disappointment!  These cookies are chalky and crumbly.  Very subtle peanut butter flavor.  Actually, very subtle flavor at all.  I don’t know how it got such great reviews.  Will definitely not be making again.

These cookies turned out perfectly! I prepared them exactly as the recipe states. They taste wonderful, lightly crispy yet a little chewy. They freeze well and thaw and taste like they just came out of the oven. I've made this "my" peanut butter cookie recipe. Thanks Joey!!!

I tried this recipe based on the number of reviews (read even the negative ones) but I have to say this is THE best peanut butter cookie recipe I've tried thus far! It DID seem a bit runnier than typical cookie dough, but I chilled it for 30 min (couldn't wait for the hour someone else recommended since I started baking at 10:30pm on a week day) and I placed the dough in small balls, did not use fork to even out. I let it bake for 15 min. The middle part turned out thicker which is what I wanted!  This way the outside was crisp and inside was soft. My boys absolutely LOVED this treat! Will be making another batch real soon!

If you don't flatten the top with a fork and leave them rolled in 1.5 inch balls then bake for 12 minutes they turn out  thick and super moist and soft. This is a family favorite recipe.

Cookies came out with a strange texture- not chewy,or moist,not crunchy; sort of soft and crumbly. Flavor was not very peanut buttery.

My mom used to bake the ones that come in the old Betty Crocker cookbook (which are quite crispy/crunchy) but I prefer moist cookies. So I've been looking for a nice soft PB cookie and these looked so promising. The five star rating is totally justified... these are truly *the best* PB cookie in the world. Needless to say, my whole family is absolutely over the moon for these. (They have have even replaced Mrs. Sigg's Snickerdoodles as #1 cookie in this house). I made one tiny change: I used bread flour instead of all-purpose. Bread flour has more protein and, therefore, makes a more chewy cookie. Delish! Would rate this at 10 stars if I could. Thank you for sharing your recipe!!

I had to try this recipe. I didn't want use the milk, so I omitted the milk and instead added 2 Tablespoons of Honey.  I also found the dough too soft to make balls so I added 3-4 Tablespoons of flour.  I reduced the baking time to 8 1/2 minutes.  They turned out great!

I have been baking for almost twenty years. I have tried a few peanut butter cookie recipes and this one will replace all the others!  It was easy and I did not change a thing.  I always use Jif for baking, and I'm sure that makes a difference.  They came out perfect!!  I had not made peanut butter cookies for a couple years and had a request from two people to make them.  My grandson just came home and tried one and is now asking for his own batch. Found this recipe just in time, thanks for sharing!!

I'm really disappointed with this recipe. I had a craving for peanut butter cookies and wanted a recipe that would yield a chewier cookie. I followed the recipe and the resulting texture was more like shortbread, crumbly and floury. The thing that bummed me out the most was that baking the first batch at 375 for 10 minutes resulted in black bottomed cookies, scorched. Baking for 8 minutes was better but overall these were duds. I see that lots of people like the recipe so wonder if the problem was that I used a more natural, oily PB, not one like Jiff or Skippy? Who knows. Anyway, I hope this review is at least helpful to someone.

Wow!  This is a fantastic recipe!  I didn't make any changes to the dough other than add 1/2 cup choc chips (Hubby's request!).  We both love the tenderness of the inside and the delicate crispiness of the outside.  I baked mine on parchment paper, which I do for anything I bake and I used the convection setting of my oven at 325 degrees for 12 minutes.  They are perfect!

DO NOT BAKE THESE AT 375!!!!
I should've followed my gut & baked them at 350*F like most cookies...I totally burnt 2 dozen cookies (Black Bottoms, Chewy Tops).  What a waste!
My dough was fluffy & delicious... I even left it on the counter (covered) overnight and it was still perfect!
I used a cookie scoop, pressed with a fork, and followed all directions (I doubled everything....I ended up with 72 cookies, minus the 24 that were charcoal.
Once I turned my oven down to 350*F the cookies turned out delicious!
Try this recipe, but bake at 350* F...you won't be disappointed!  I will definitely be making these again.

Fabulous SOFT cookie!  If you're looking for a crispy pb cookie, this is not for you.  I've made these a few times, following the recipe exactly, and they come out perfectly.  I use a small melon baller to scoop because the batter is very sticky, and bake for 7 minutes.  Don't let them go 8 or 9 minutes because the bottoms will get too dark.  Hope these tips help!

My husband used to consider himself the king of making peanut butter cookies, but recently he made a batch after being spoiled by this recipe, and they didn't hold a candle.  He was reluctant, but he surrendered the crown.

These cookies are a bit awkward to shape, but the flavor and texture are wonderful. The quality of the peanut butter that you use really matters for this one, so don't skimp.

This is a different PB cookie. The dough was very airy and light--easy to stir in the dry ingredients. I make the cookie exactly like the recipe was written. However, I found it much easier to refrigerate overnight, use a small scoop and then dip my fork in water, shaking off excess, and then making the imprint. I thought 375 was way too hot for any cookie and I went with 350 for approx. 11 mins. These taste very good, my family really enjoyed them.

These cookies are so good. What I love most about them is that as long as they are kept in an airtight container, they stay soft for a really long time after baking. I make them all the time and they've never turned out badly. LOVE THEM

Delish!  I made these and dipped half in dark chocolate and OMG they were fantastic!  You cannot find a better PB cookie recipe, in my opinion.  They turn out as just the right combo of crispy outside and chewy inside.  For those of you looking for a more traditional crispy cookie you may want to look elsewhere or bake longer.  But I will never use another PB cookie recipe!

This weren't the worst peanut butter cookie, but they weren't the best either.  Very pasty and not much peanut butter flavor came through.  Very disappointed because I thought with all the 5 stars I saw, this was THE altimate peanut butter cookie.

Well, I made these exactly how they said and they turned out great.

The thing is....what I thought was flour and used for flour...wasn't flour. It was pancake mix. My family didn't care, because the cookies turned out very well, even if I did have to keep them in the oven a few minutes longer than the recipe said. They were soft an tasted very good. Looking at some of the reviews, I think I'm glad that mistake was made, because at least they turned out well.

This may be a good base recipe, but it was a bit flavorless and a little soft. I think if the temp was down to 350* and baked a little longer, it might be the right crunchy texture, but that is just my preference. However, that still would not change the fact it was not sweet enough and had very little peanut butter flavor. Once again, this is just based upon my preference...and my fiance, and daughter, and neighbor, and friend.

This is my go-to peanut butter cookie recipe.  It doesn't have a strong peanut butter flavor so I tend to add more peanut butter, but they are super soft and can keep for awhile.  I also add peanut butter/chocolate kisses to mine for a little extra sweet.

These are the most peanut buttery cookies ever! They are a hit every time! I like to use an all natural peanut butter so there isn't any extra sugar. I love the recipie just the way it is, one time I forgot the milk, and the cookies turned out dryer but the textre did this crumbly melty thing when you ate em, nom nom!

These cookies were pretty good! I scaled down the recipe to do 24, but still used the entire 1 cup of peanut butter. I used half dark chocolate PB and half super chunk and they were very peanut buttery! The first batch I baked at 10 minutes and once they cooled, they were a bit crumbly - these tasted similar to PB fudge. The second batch I timed at 8 minutes but they looked very raw, so I left them in the oven another minute or so and they turned out better than the first batch. The dough was also SUPER sticky on the first batch  (even after chilling) so they were very hard to work with. The second batch went in the freezer and rolled out perfectly, so that may of made a difference in the first batch being a bit crumbly. I also added white choc chips for an extra kick. Will make again!

I just made these and they are so delicious! I doubled the recipe and used half creamy and half super chunky peanut butter. I also used butter vanilla instead of the regular vanilla extract. My kids are scarfing them down so fast,they're going to have a belly ache! LOL Definitely a keeper : )

I followed these directions word for word and they came out really good. I would use an extra 1/4 cup of flour as my batter came out a bit too sticky but when using any kind of batter you need to adjust after blending all of the ingredients. Top notch cookies. Everyone loved them. Just DO NOT over bake. Hard crumbly cookies are the worst. Don't be afraid of a little gooeyness it is your friend.

These are fantastic! I made them last weekend and brought them to work. Everyone raved! I did increase the sugar to 3/4 cup of each brown and white (I like them sweet) and rolled them in white sugar before making the criss-cross pattern. They stayed soft and chewy for as long as they lasted (4 days). I am making these for our "Holiday Cookie Walk" and for gifts at Christmas. I may dip them in melted chocolate next time! Yummmm

Wow!! These cookies are great! Very soft and chewy, and very peanut-buttery. I followed the recipe exactly, except I rolled the cookie dough balls in white sugar before putting them on the baking pan. Will definitely make these again!

Made these for the family, and they were a hit!
My cookie dough did not come out soupy or anything.  I followed the recipe as listed above.

Best recipe ever! So simple to make, always comes out perfect. Only problem is that they don't last long. Everyone here finishes them before they cool down!
Thanks for the great recipe!

Too cakey of cookies. There has to be a better balance of flour, but when I tried adding only a cup and a Tablespoon it was too gooey. I give up on this recipe. I want cookies, not cakies.

I would just like to state that I do not bake.  I just wasn't born with the ability, I guess.  I have been trying to lately, though.  

And I love this recipe.  I don't care if it's not the way "professionals" do it.  I did leave out the vanilla extract, because I didn't have any.  I also added a bit more salt, because I like saltish sweets.  Used crunchy PB.  Fantastic.  I'm saving this one.

Very sad that these did not live up to the hype of the reviews. 
I used Jiff PB, which has always had a strong pb taste, yet I thought the cookies were not very flavorful.  The dough was a bit tough to work with and I wasn't 100% impressed with the final consistency. 
Perhaps adding pb chips or something would make them better, but I don't think I will be giving these a shot again. They are the only cookies that have ever sat around for a week in our large household!

I was looking for a peanut butter cookie that was chewy.  I was so happy when I made these.  My entire family loves them.  I roll them in sugar before I press with a fork.  Great cookies!!!

These cookies are okay.  With such high ratings I figured they would be out of this world yummy.  Not a very strong peanut butter flavor.  I am going to keep looking for a great recipie for Peanut Butter Cookies.

This was SO easy to do. Someone mentioned dipping their fork in sugar before pressing on the dough and I completely agree. I'd prefer a little softer a cookie but great taste. Next time I'm adding white chocolate chips and peanuts :)

Awesome cookies, made exactly as shown and came out perfect! Kinda nervous about the batter being a bit thin but came out wonderful! Read a tip about dipping the fork in water and it worked better than the sugar I normally use. Will definitely make again, again and again.

These cookies are so moist and delicious; the best peanut butter cookies I've ever eaten (and I'm typically not a fan of peanut butter cookies). I only bake these for 8 minutes...at 350 degrees and then let them cool on the pan before transferring to wax paper to cool completely.  I also like to add one bag of Reese's peanut butter chips.  Give these a try--you'll be glad you did!

Delicious recipe.  I didn't criss-cross them at all with the fork.  Instead, I scooped the cookies in a round scoop and right after I took them out of the oven, I put a Hershey's Kiss in the center.  YUM!  Very yummy.  The cookies are moist, and chewy.  Just the way a good peanut butter cookie should be.

Awesomely soft and chewy, freezes very well.  I add a bit more peanut butter, but it was still very good exactly as drawn out here.

Just made half a recipe to try it out & haven't baked cookies in forever but these are really nice.  I wanted a soft centre and these needed just 8 minutes in my oven - don't be tempted to overcook - they harden as they cool. I pressed lightly in golden caster sugar before making cross fork marks - didn't have any brown sugar to hand so just used the golden caster in the recipe.

Delicious! Moist and tasty.  Very flavorful. I baked them in the oven for 9 minutes, and used a melon baller to make the cookie original shape.

This wasn't a bad cookie by any means, but it didn't bowl me over either. I mean, sure...it was peanut buttery and soft with slightly crumbly edges (perfection!) but the taste was...just good. The dough was hard to handle, as so many other reviewers have stated. It was SO sticky that rolling into balls was virtually impossible. I added an extra 1/4 c of flour and just dropped "balls" onto the sheets, smooshing them down with my fingertips. I baked them about 12 minutes per batch (making 36 cookies total). Not bad if you need a pb fix, but not the best I've ever had.

Made this as written, with whole wheat flour and chocolate chips.  The kids absolutely loved them.  The first trial I had batter that was too soft so they were drop cookies, and after baking for 9 minutes, they had a tendency to crumble even when cooled.  The second trial I packed the brown sugar better and as a result the dough was easy to work with.  I dropped the cookies using two spoons onto parchment paper.  Then I picked up each dough ball and rolled it round, then pressed flat with a fork.

These have a great peanut butter taste (which I usually find lacking in other recipes). They are a bit sticky to work with, but nothing major. All in all they were quite tastey!

These were THE BEST peanut butter cookies I've ever made.  Great flavor and texture.  Be careful with the oven heat.  The ones that were a little undercooked were way better than the ones that were a little overcooked.

These cookies were quite "fluffy" and soft and very bland in flavor. The dough was almost like a batter instead of being doughy. It was way too soft and we did not like them at all.

I'm looking at the 4 and a half star review on this one and scratching my head. Guess I'm just an odd ball, because I didn't even bother to bake the rest of the batter after I tasted the first batch. Not at all what I think of as a peanut butter cookie!

These were very good cookies, just not the type that i was expecting.  I was looking for the 'traditional' type of PB cookie (ie like that in the better homes and gardens cook book). These cookies turned out really great, even though the dough was very soft (i followed recipe to a t and didn't change a thing). Just keep in mind that although they are a great cookie, they may not be exactly the PB cookie you are expecting.

I love these peanut butter cookies.  They are definitely more chewy than the ones I had as a kid, but the only recipes I can find to make a more crispy cookie use shortening and I'll pass on that.  Make sure you let them set for a few minutes before trying to handle them, but 5-10 minutes out of the oven they started disappearing fast!

I am only giving these 3 stars because my family and I didn't personally like them - although there was nothing exactly wrong with them. I tried these because of the rating and the "soft and chewy" remarks in the description - which is exactly the pb cookie recipe I was looking for. I want a dense, chewy cookie. I followed the recipe exactly and while they have good flavor, they are not the recipe for me or my family. If you are looking for a more sandy or dry peanut butter cookie (which a lot of people love) then these would work really well for you. If you are looking for a dense, chewy cookie - I would keep looking.

These leave you wanting more. I did use 1.5 cups of flour rather than 1.25 cause the dough needed a little more body. Otherwise, they're awesome.

I have to agree with the below reviewer. These cookies came out greasy and not great. Has the recipe on line changed since it got all those great reviews?
Tips for working with this greasy dough: refrigerate it for 25 minutes before attempting to roll it, and make small cookies.

I followed the recipe exactly, except for baking for an extra minute or two.  I'm not sure what I did differently then everyone else who is raving about these cookies.  Not sweet enough at all and extremely greasy.  My three year old son wouldn't even eat them, nor would I.  I'm glad I didn't double the recipe as I usually do.

I've made a lot of peanut butter cookies, and this recipe is by far the best. I used vegetable oil instead of butter and they still tasted amazing. I made the for my boyfriend and he couldn't stop eating them! If you are looking for a peanut butter cookie recipe this is it. Make it now!

I thought these turned out great. Dont know what people were doing wrong. Didnt have to change a thing. They came out of the oven beautiful, tasted great. Not all ovens work alike. (9 minutes in my oven were perfect. Soft and chewy. Peanut butter taste was great. I also used margarine and they didnt flatten out. Will use this recipe again

Good, but not peanut buttery enough.  They stay really soft though and do have a nice flavor.

This recipe is great.  So much better than the ones that call for shortening.  I used 1/2 cup of creamy and 1/2 cup crunchy.  Turned out perfect.

I've never written a review before -- this is very exciting.  

Okay, so I'm a woman on a binge and what is my weapon of choice?  Ahhh peanut butter cookies.  That said....these were the strangest peanut butter cookies I've ever made.  I thought maybe I'd done something wrong but it's such a simple recipe there's nothing to do wrong.  

Someone else mentioned that their batter was fluffy and delicious -- mine too.  Thing is my batter was so fluffy and light I couldn't roll the dough into balls.  And forget trying to flatten the cookie or add sugar (to enhance the taste as per everyone else's review).  Not possible. The most disappointing part was when my cookies exited the oven.  They were flat as pancakes and, of course,  became flatter as they cooled. 

  This was not the satisfyingly decadent peanut butter cookie of my dysfunctional childhood.

Very disappointed! They tasted ok, not peanut buttery enough though. I was looking for a soft cookie but this was way to crumbly, I could barely get them off the pan in one piece.  Even 3 days later they're super crumbly. Will not make again!

My search is over for a great peanut butter cookie recipe!  I have made these cookies multiple times and they always come out great.  My favorite thing about them is how moist they stay, even days after coming out of the oven.

Delicious.  I did a little substituting to test out healthier ingredients (applesauce in place of the butter), and they were still great!

Maybe it was because I used natural PB, but these were really greasy.  They weren't very flavorful either.  My 2 and 3 year old boys ate them, but nobody else would.

One word: awesome.  I had no problem with these burning because I know to watch the oven whenever trying out a new cookie recipe (hello, people!) and I also had no problem with the batter being "soupy".  Mine was fluffy and soft and smelled like the gourmet peanut butter that they put in homemade peanut butter cups -- it tasted like it, too! ;)  My oven is screwy at best, so it took nine minutes on the top rack for them to brown around the edges and turn out perfect, soft but still a little crisp and crumbly like a good peanut butter cookie should be.  I did the old fashioned method of rolling it in sugar before pressing it with the fork.  If you have a problem with the fork sticking to the cookie (as mine did at first), just dip the fork tines into a bowl of sugar before each application to a cookie; it works magic.  Enjoy!

These were really good cookies. However my husband is a peanut butter nut and they were not quite as peanut-buttery as he likes. I think next time I may add a little more. Also I definatly recommend doing a double batch, they are small and go fast!! Overall though a really good cookie.

These cookies had an outstanding flavor, for sure.  I used crunchy peanut butter, but that was my only substitution.  I had trouble getting the right consistency baking these cookies, but I followed other's suggestions, so it's not necessarily the fault of this recipe.  Would definitely try to make again!

These cookies turned out good but not great. The texture was great. But I just think I wanted them to taste a little more peanut buttery. Next time I will follow the suggestions of others and add more peanut butter.

Ive tried 2 batches cooking at all different temperatures and various length of time.  Cannot get it right?  The cookies are falling apart.  The bottoms are cooked perfect but the middle of the cookie is still doughy?  UPDATE..I think I got it...Cook at 355 for 8 minutes lining the pan with parchment paper.  Also put the fork marks down the middle of the ball only, this squishes the dough to the sides so the center is flatter than the sides.

LOVED these cookies! I always tired of the cookies that flattened as they cooled. These held up nicely. I did notice my kitchenaid was not able to mix all the flour at the bottom which is important! Once hand-mixed it was great! Yum yum! This will be the recipe we use from now on!

These truly are the best peanut butter cookies I've ever made.  A couple things I did to personalize them is instead of making tradition circle cookies, I ball up two small circles (tops dipped in sugar), place them side by side.  Press them together once using med. strength with fork tines, then one mark on top of each individual circle with tines. They will turn out looking like peanuts.  But they are yummy round or otherwise!

DO NOT overcook these. I'm pretty  good about pulling cookies out before they're done to keep them chewy -- I hate  crispy cookies -- but these you have to REALLY watch and pull out well before what would appear even close to "done". I even used a Silpat cover on the bottom of my cookie sheet that usually won't let a cookie burn, but the bottoms got overdone. I turned the heat down to 360 degrees for batch #2 and pulled them out  much sooner than the first; this did the trick. I also added chocolate chunks to give it that something more. I wasn't blown away by any great peanut butter taste (hence the added chocolate to dress it up). I may have used a tad shy of a full cup, but I doubt that made a huge difference. Overall: pretty good cookies.

Excellent cookies!  I made mine with Crisco instead of butter because one of our friends cannot eat butter - and it was still a very soft peanut buttery cookie.  I will be making this again soon (very soon) using butter!  Thanks for sharing.

These cookies melt in your mouth!  This is now my favorite peanut butter cookie recipe.  Every time I get myself in the doghouse with my hubby, you know from spending too much money, etc, all I have to do is make peanut butter cookies and I'm home free.  Seriously, these are wonderful.

These were excellent! I would recommend only baking them for 8 minutes, then take them out to set-up on the pan to keep them soft. I also went ahead and made the classic criss-cross fork mark even though the directions say otherwise. I sprinkled the cookies with sugar before baking, and I highly suggest adding 1 small box of vanilla pudding mix to keep the moist for days. Although I ended up with only 21 cookies, I will definitely make these again!

It wasn't as good as I'd hoped it'll be. The batter was way too oily. Furthermore, the peanut butter flavour was a little lacking. The cookies spread out a lot in the oven while baking. The cookies turned out really crumbly.
However, despite a rather disappointing first try at baking peanut butter cookies, I still give it 3 stars for the convenience of the ingredients and how much better it tasted after it's been cooled in the fridge. I'll keep trying!

I decided to bake some cookies after having a bad day at work (I figured a nice treat for myself would turn my day around! ha-ha-ha).  I began to worry my evening wasn't going to be better after I finished mixing all the agredients.  The batter seemed extremely "wet".  Boy, was I glad I didn't toss it.  The cookies turn out excellent.  My 12 year old son really loved them too.  Will definitely make again!

I was absolutely thrilled with this recipe.  I followed the exact recipe and the cookies turned out beautiful and are still soft/chewy three days later.  As another reviewer mentioned, I was initially worried when the batter seemed more 'wet' than I thought it should be - but they turned out great.

Also, be sure to keep an eye on them in the last few minutes so they don't overcook.  I took mine out when the edges were just beginning to brown and the centers were still soft/crumbly.    They held together great after cooling.

I think this recipe is excellent.  I had to use what I had on hand when it came to the butter part, so I used mostly a spreadable stick of margarine, and the rest was butter.  It could have used a little more salt.  The dough is very moist, but I just scooped about a walnut sized portion of it and dropped it into some granulated sugar, rolling it around.  I was used to peanut butter cookies being coated in sugar anyway and it made the dough easier to handle.  I'll make this recipe again!  Thanks!

The BEST peanut butter cookies. I've made these every Christmas since I got the recipe. One year, they were the only thing my cousin would eat! They also freeze well.

I LOVE these cookies!  They always turn out perfect and they stay soft, unlike other cookies I "try" to make.  My boyfriend tries to snatch them as soon as they're done baking.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I thought these cookies were dry and bland but everyone I cooked them for thought they were incredible and wouldn't let me change anything, so I guess my sweet tooth is just out of control :)

The BEST peanut butter cookies EVER!  I make mine with butter flavor shortening instead of butter for a little chewier texture, but I'll never use another recipe.

These are good but not GREAT. I don't see why people here are flipping out over them. I've had better.
The dough is crumbly, and you have to pretty much roll the cookie dough together between your hands to make it stick as a ball. It took 15 minutes or more to bake each batch - I use insulated sheets.
Even so, they are kinda thick, little undercooked on the inside, crumbly, ok tasting.  I can do better.

I would recommend flattening them before baking with your hands, and keep them small - 1 Tablespoonfull MAX.

I don't know what the problem was with these,but they were a disaster for me from start to finish.  I never have a problem baking cookies, and Id id with these.  Firstly, there was no way I was going to form that cookie dough into balls.  I try adding flour, but if I would've added too much more, they would've tasted more floury than peanutbuttery.  So, I made them drop cookies.  Doesn't work with the recipe.  You'll burn the bottoms, and the rest of the cookie doesn't bake through.  Overall, they tasted fine, they just didn't produce the kind of peanut butter cookie that I like to see.

Okay-- I made a batch of these even though halfway through making them I realised I had no baking powder in the house. It didn't matter. These were very, very good. I never liked pb cookies, but I had always hoped to. They're usually so crumbly and dry. These were soft and delightful!  I have literally run out of milk. Drank a quart-and-a-half of it to go with my cookies. Tasty. Tasty. Tasty.

My husband loves these cookies. I make a batch twice a week at least. I guess I should have given the recipe four stars because I've only ever made them using light peanut butter so I'm not exactly sure what the original recipe is like, although I'm sure it’s great. The next time I make them I'm going to use toffee chips.

Hats off to Joey for this cookie recipe. Honestly I tweaked this recipe just a smidge. I used all brown sugar instead of the brown/white combination (only because this is my preference), I used Crisco butter flavored shortening (because I had it on hand), and I tossed in some milk chocolate chips (Hey, I had 3 bags left over from a party- what's a poor girl to do?). All jokes aside these are awesome. They taste just like the cookies my mom makes year after year at Christmas. My mixture yielded 47 moderately sized drop cookies. I've decided that next time I  make these, I'll try adding some vanilla milk chips. Thanks P.L. Weiss!

If the ratings were based on appearance, these would have received a better mark...HOWEVER, it is based more on taste and appearance, therefore I must give them only 2 stars.  These are good if you underbake them (7 minutes for 1" balls of dough).  They are dry tasting while keeping a chewy consistancy.  These look great though so if you are doing a photo shot, use these.

These are very very good peanut butter cookies. In fact, I would say they are the best I have made. They are nice and chewy but keep their shape very well and get a nice crust from rolling them in the sugar. I thought the dough was a bit too sticky when I was rolling them into balls and that they would flatten in the oven but they are the perfect shape and thickness! A *great* cookie!

Very good recipe - especially with chocolate chips mixed in.  The dough is super sticky - I dropped spoonfuls of it in sugar before shaping it into balls - that seemed to help.  Also followed the "wet fork" advice.  Nice soft texture.

A delicious peanut butter cookie!  I used chunky peanut butter for a little texture, and sprinkled colored sugar on top for a holiday look.

Pretty good...I made a few batches as per the recipe and then a few with peanut butter chips added.  Just a suggestion, but
I think adding the chips made it better.

This is the second time, ever, making peanut butter cookies.  These are so moist and flavorful.  I love'm.  I followed the recipe.  The dough was not hard to work with, as I remember from the time before.  Will definitely make again!

Like a few other people, I signed up for this site just so I could review these cookies.  I have a great peanut butter cookie recipe but this recipe sounded wonderful so I had to Ryan it.  These cookies are flat tasting and not very much peanut butter flavor. The cookies are bland and boring.

Worst cookies I’ve ever made. I knew there would be a problem with ratio of wet to dry ingredients. Tasted nothing like a peanut butter cookie. Was very disappointed. These should not be titled “best”   Tried one cookie from first tray, gross, tossed that tray in garbage. Tried again adding flour to dough for second tray, a bit better but I have tasted 100% better peanut butter cookies. Doesn’t have texture or flavour. If you want a bland but chewy cookie. These are great. If you want a peanut butter cookie then pass on this recipe.

I don't know what I did wrong, but these didn't taste very good to me. I'm 99.9% sure I followed the recipe with minor tweaks (added another teaspoon of vanilla and another tablespoon of white sugar) and the cookies turned out to be crumbly and with little peanut butter flavor at all. The recipe said to bake the cookies at 375 degrees for 8-10 minutes. After 10 minutes, the cookies were barely cooked and still doughy. I put them in for another five minutes at 400 degrees, and the edges were becoming burnt and the centers of the cookie were still doughy. By the time I was able to take them out of the oven, they were very crumbly (I lifted one up and it just shattered in my hand) and bland. I will not use this recipe again.

I agree 100% with COFECHIC. I just signed up for this site to comment on this recipe because I am so disappointed with it. The cookies lack the textural and flavorful essence that a peanut butter cookie should embody. They came out caky, flat and the peanut butter flavor is not very strong. Maybe Joey should specify what type of peanut butter he used? Disappointed about the time wasted making these cookies.

Cookies turned out very soggy with a greesy taste.  Perhaps without milk could have been more crispy. My kids did not like it either. Will not do it again.

Listen, I read the first reviewer and almost didn't make theses... I made these EXACTLY as is and they were AMAZING!!!! My family likes soft cookies not hard crunchy cookies, and these are perfect!  They have a great flavor and they are soft, let them cool for a bit and enjoy :). I do not write reviews often, and I certainly don't think a bakery owner should criticize someone's shared recipe.  Everyone has different tastes and that's fine but let's not be unkind if you just have a different taste.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, we love it and will enjoy it for years to come!

Followed the recipe exactly. Good flavour, chewy centre and crisper outside. I prefer a denser cookie but this is a good.

These were really good!! Don't touch them with anything when they're hot. Allow them to cook before taking them off the cookie sheet, or they will crumble.  I will make these again.

I made this as written. They were very good. I followed the advise of one of the posts since it was very sticky and not easy to mark with the fork, I dipped the fork in water and it was perfect!  Made 3 dozen cookies.  I baked them for 8 minutes and they were perfect once cooled.

These turned out good. I made them with 1 1/2 cups extra crunchy peanut butter for the extra texture of the nuts. The kids devoured them. :)

I'll make these again - they turned out very well and had a good flavor. I was a little concerned because of the one negative review, but they cooked up nicely in 12 minutes, didn't fall apart, and were delicious. Everyone's oven is a little different, and I always keep an eye on anything I'm baking.

When I moved I lost ALL my recipes ?? I came across this peanut butter cookie recipe and it seems to be very similar to the one I had. I personally add a little extra peanut butter than it calls for...just a little. They turned out pretty close to my recipe. One thing they missed on here, and some might be having this problem, is wetting the fork before pressing the dough. If you don't wet it, it will most likely stick to the dough. Just run the fork under water before pressing each cookie. It makes all the difference. Some say to use flour, but then you have loose flour on the top of the cookies. Overall, a good recipe!

BEST Peanut Butter cookies that I ever made.  I made them exactly as the recipe indicates.  At 8 min, I watched them closely and pulled them out as soon as the edges started to brown....they were perfect...crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside!   Definitely saving this recipe.

I loved this recipe! The only things I did different:
1. Set my oven to 350 and figured out 7 mins was best for my oven after burning the bottoms of the first batch. If I had set it to 375 they would have all been scorched black hockey pucks. Recipe times are always just a suggestion since so many factors affect the outcome.
2. Dipped my fork in sugar before making the criss cross pattern on top. It helped the dough to not stick to the fork since the dough is a little wetter than most cookie recipes.
3. Added a bag of Heath chocolate and toffee baking bits. This recipe would be just as delicious without them, but the addition of toffee and chocolate was awesome.

Made exactly as written and the cookies were sensational! Not sure how you can roll these cookies into balls since the dough is quite soft but I just dropped them on the sheet and used a flour dipped fork to make the crisscrosses. Definitely watch your cooking times, even one minute extra can make a difference in texture. My oven is pretty bang on for temp and the first batch went in for 8 mins, the second for nine and the first were chewier. Thanks for a great recipe!

I am not a big peanut butter cookie fan; however, I love this cookie. Light cookie with soft middle and crispy outside.  I  used Jiffy peanut butter added a pinch more vanilla and white chocolate chips. Baked for 9 minutes : cookies came out perfect with golden bottoms.  Thank you for the recipe. This will be my go to PB cookie.

These are excellent!  I don't care for the flourless peanut butter cookies but many standard ones are bland and not peanut-buttery enough. These are perfect. Crispy and chewy, 'short' but not falling apart. As with most, even tho they are flattened, they still expand. As they are rich, I made them small-ish and so my yield was just short of 4 dozen.  I baked at 350 for 10 min. As my oven runs hot.  They won't last long around here.  Next time I'll see you doubling the recipe works.

I've been a chef for over 25 years and we hand make our desserts where I work.  We have served these cookies at wedding receptions, off site catered events and other functions...they always get rave reviews...these are my favorite cookie anyway so iay be a little biased but definitely the best PB cookies I've ever eaten

It's almost midnight my time and all the sudden my hubby has a sweet tooth so i decide to make something fast and hopefully yummy for him. This recipe only took me about 15 minutes to mix everything and roll the balls and use a fork to make 2 criss cross pattern on top i put them in the pre heated oven for 8 minutes and they came out perfect ! Very soft and delicious. The only thing i didn't have was vanilla extract or enough brown sugar so i substituted the rest of the brown sugar i needed with extra white sugar I have to say we love them ! :)

I didn't care for this recipe.  These barely held together trying to get them off the pan because they are so dry and crumbly. And they lack in peanut butter flavor as well. I followed the recipe exactly so I just don't get it. I won't be making them again.

These are delicious!  I have to admit that I totally forgot to add the milk, but they still turned out great.  They have gotten rave reviews from everyone who tried them.  
I used half creamy and half chunky peanut butter, which adds a nice crunch to the texture.  I also used them to make cookies with a donut center (chocolate) which was also a huge hit.
I will definitely use this recipe again.

Most amazing cookies. I doubled the recipe and couldn't wait to try them.  I gave some to my friend and her daughter and her daughter had a friend sleepover and they were gone the next day. I also gave a cookie to my upstairs neighbors children and they loved them, so the mom and dad had to try one and they loved them too.  Then I made a really big cookie which was just to dough balls rolled into one to my mother and she thoroughly enjoyed it too.  So this recipe was a hit with me.  Going to make cookie baskets for Christmas this year and will include this recipe.

Nice recipe, Joey!  Easy to follow, great results!  I'd never made peanut butter cookies before... Husband said the batter was too wet when I was making them, but he swallowed his words when swallowed the cookies. ??  Baked mine for 10-12 minutes for a crispier cookie.

Hi all!  this recipe really hit it out of the park!  At first, I did find that the time to bake (probably my oven) wasn't enough, so I kept adding two minutes. When the edges appeared to brown a little,  I took them out of the oven and  let them rest on the cookie sheet as suggested.  Holy cow, they were so good. They were a little tender, so maybe I'll lower the temp to 350 and cook a little longer, as one member suggested.  But wow, no lacking in flavor in this cookie. It was fabulous.  Thanks Joey, for sharing!

I made this exactly as directed and they turned out wonderfully!  Great PB flavour and they just about melt in your mouth. I baked for just 8 mins - they don't seem quite done yet when you take them out of the oven (they are SUPER crumbly) but once you let them cool a few minute they are perfect :)

Everyone else loved them, I thought they were good but I like a crisp cookie.  These stay soft, even after being stored for a few days (if they last that long).
I doubled the recipe with no problems.  I used a small cookie scoop and didn't have any problems with the soft dough.  I smashed them in one direction with fork, didn't both to make the cross hash marks.  They don't spread much, so you can get a lot on one pan.  I used parchment paper and the bottoms came out perfect at just 10 minutes at 375.  let them cool before eating as they taste more peanut buttery after being cooled.

These kept their promise of being soft & chewy. I dislike dry/crispy cookies so this recipe was perfect for my tastes. Excellent buttery/peanut buttery taste. Followed the recipe exactly, mine were done at 10-minutes. I also added chocolate chips (half semi-sweet & half milk chocolate) to half the batch, and those were also pretty good. These were good, just not great.

I like this recipe. I find it best to flatten the balls of batter before baking them as they tend to stay a little thick. Not too peanut buttery and not too sugary.

This is the perfect recipe. I am only twelve years old and it turned out perfect!! all that i changed was that before i put the cookies in the oven i sprinkled them with sugar. i also allowed them to cool for ten minutes on the pan before taking them off of the rack. these are much better than any of the other peanut butter cookies that i have had before. all of the others were dry and flavorless, but this recipe is a keeper! it is super easy with remarkable outcomes and i encourage you to try it:)

I took some of the hints of others and added 1/4 cup extra flour. and baked 15 minutes extra on top shelf.  They were the best peanut butter cookies I've made.  I do recommend.  Thank You for sharing this recipe.

I love this cookie.  I add some type of  chip each time I make the recipe.  This time I used chunky peanut butter and toffee chips.  The kids (all grown) loved them.  Dipped a few in chocolate.  Went over great.  Will be doing more the next time.

These are great. Made about two and a half dozens from one batch. Baked at 350 for 11 minutes and turned out perfect. Lined the pan with parchment paper.

Love this recipe! I added all the ingredients but I added a box of chocolate pudding to the flour mix and my Family loved them. They came out soft and chewy like my Family likes cookies. Thank you for posting this recipe!

I made it exactly as the recipe states, no change except that I had to bake them a couple of minutes longer, but I did use a cookie scoop that made a bit bigger cookie. My husband and I both love how peanut buttery they are.  They are so quick and easy to make, I will definitely make them again.

I thought this recipe was very good !! I used Jiff peanut butter (my fave !) and only alterations were adding peanut butter chips and was more generous with the peanut butter. Turned out amazing !!

These are the best peanut butter cookies I've ever had.  They were soft and tender.  I omitted the milk, because the texture seemed right without it.  This will definitely be my "go to" recipe from now on.  They had a short, almost "sandy" texture - much like shortbread.  Not too sweet.  Perfect.

Wow, these are fantastic peanut butter cookies!  I doubled the batch and sprinkled the tops with sugar before I baked them.  Other than that, I followed the recipe to the letter.  Very good, nice and moist, with a rich peanut butter flavor.  I will make them again, and again.  Thank you, Joey, this is a great recipe!

I am a "peanut butter cookie specialist" ?? and these are the BEST peanut butter cookies I've ever made! Light, crisp and delicious! I followed the recipe exactly. When I creamed my butter with my sugars, I microwave it until it's almost melted. AWESOME, I've made peanut butter cookies for 35 years, this is an excellent recipe!

Hands down the best peanut butter cookie recipe ever! I get requests for these more often than ANY other cookie. For an added treat... I do not flatten then at all but instead place refrigerated balls straight into the oven & as soon as they come out, I place a refrigerated reeses cup mini in the middle then & let them cool room at temperature. Putting a 'chilled' candy in the middle is important to prevent it from melting away upon inserting into the cookie. These are delicious!

I added a few hersheys kisses ontop and let them melt. Honestly, my only problem with these cookies is that they are a little too sweet. Maybe next time I make them I will add in less sugar, other than that these cookies are pretty  good, especially if you're a peanut butter lover.

These were not sweet enough to be a...full fledged cookie (and I am not someone who likes things to be super sugary, but these were missing something that didn't really make it feel like you were eating a real cookie). They were boring and just did not taste very good. Surprised, as there are so many reviews. I followed the directions and the only thing that was different is that I did not have white sugar, so used this chunkier sugar that I had instead. Also, I only had chunky peanut butter (but really nice organic full-of-flavor, Santa Cruz).

So yummy but a little bit too sweet for me. We sprinkled salted chopped peanuts on 1/3, left 1/3 plain and added mini chocolate chips to the last 1/3. My kids loved them!

Great peanut butter taste, and just the right amount of crunch. Baked at 375 for about 12 minutes.

It was ok. But I had to leave them in the oven way longer than the 15 min. I would also add more sugar next time and a little more peanut butter.

Somehow we had a jar of store-brand, reduced-fat peanut butter that no one liked. So not to be wasteful,used it to make these cookies and they were delicious! Can't wait to try with good peanut butter lol. Only change I made was to bake at 350 degrees for 13-15 minutes.

These were picture perfect.  I substituted 1.5 cups of self rising flour for the flour/salt/baking powder mixture, and they set up beautifully.  Ten minutes baking time yielded a nice soft cookie. *update: I made these ahead of time, portioned out with a cookie scoop, and froze the dough balls.  I baked them straight from the freezer at 350 for ten minutes, did the fork-squoosh, and baked for another twelve.  Absolute perfection.  This has been my go-to recipe for a while, but now knowing they work just as well from frozen changes my baking game.  No more getting up at 3AM when I have to bring a treat to work.  Peanut butter cookies for all occasions now!

I loved this recipe! My sister says that her favorite part of the cookies is everything! :) When I found the recipe, I was looking for a peanut butter cookie with chocolate in it. I had already used this recipe before, and decided to just add chocolate chips into it. I used a whole 12oz bag of Guittard chocolate chips :) The results were amazing!

Amazing recipe for sure! I know that we all have our preference when it comes to Peanut Butter Cookies, but I go with Joey's everytime I make them. They are even so good with ghirardelli chocolate drizzled on top of them.

The dough was amazing, I think I could've got a couple more cookies if I didn't eat the dough.  End result was even better.  I followed the recipe exactly and used natural peanut butter.

THE BEST PB cookie recipe ever!  I follow the recipe as instructed.  They consistently turn out moist and stay soft throughout the week.  I usually use Jiff extra country PB.  Now I have to make them each week for my husband.  UPDATE:  Here it is Dec. 2016, and it's still the only cookie I make.  It's a rave and I (who doesn't like PB) still make and enjoy.  Another 5 star rating!  Thank you for sharing.

Not my favorite.  They were not very sweet and I used creamy peanut butter but the texture somehow came out gritty.  I make cookies often and typically make chocolate chip or sugar cookies and i have found good chewy recipes for those.  I mean they are home made cookies so of course they will get eaten but I would not recommend them to anyone or make them again.  The texture is really off and the dough is not very sweet...  The dough was very sticky too when forming the cookies...

I just tried this recipe for the first time (never made peanut butter cookies before) and they came out fantastic! I love how the recipe uses the basic ingredients you would normally find around the house. I cooked two batches (one regular and one with chocolate chips) and they got rave reviews from everybody who tried them. Putting this one in my recipe box for sure! Thanks, Joey! You rock!

These cookies were amazing. So good. I made them even "deadlier" by putting 2 cookies together with some peanut butter frosting (peanut butter, powdered sugar and vanilla, all to taste). My husband couldn't leave them alone and he usually has great will power.

I used stevia instead of sugar and almond milk instead of milk, all natural peanut butter, and put a raisen in the middle. I cooked for 9 minutes on 375 and let cool for 5 minutes after baking.

These were absolutely the best peanut butter cookies I've had. I made them last night and everyone loved them. The only thin I added was a bag of Reese's peanut butter morsels.

These were just so so.  Followed the recipe exactly.  They seemed dry and crumbly even when cooked for less time than suggested.  Some fell apart when taking them off the cookie sheet.  I will look for another recipe next time.

ok I am an avid baker here... and I tell ya this is a most fantastic peanut butter cookie.. I am not sure what people think when they say they don't taste much peanut butter b/c this is fantastic, very tasty and crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside... LOVE this recipe will make again .. gotta run batch number 2 ready to come out :) and for those that maybe skeptic about the pasty dough I was too .. it is very sticky but worth it keeps it chewy, just dust your finters or the top of dough with a very little amount of flour if needed to make balls don't DON'T add flour I think it will change texture of overall cookie :)

I thought these cookies turned out great. I'm not a fan of PB normally, and I don't like desserts that are too sweet.  I followed the recipe but used natural unsweetened peanut butter, 1 & 1/4 cups of brown sugar only. No white sugar. I also added a tsp. of baking soda. I baked the cookies for exactly 9 minutes and they came out delicious and chewy.  I was really pleased.

These were fabulous! These definitely had the perfect amount of peanut butter. I had to add a little more flour to mine and lower the temperature of the oven, my first batch burned on the bottoms. But this is a great recipe I will use again!

These are a very delicate cookie when hot, so allow to sit on sheet for a few minutes before moving to foil to cool. I had better luck lowering oven temp to 350 degrees. At 375 they browned to darkly on the bottom. Overall good flavor. Though I do get the "sand" texture remark made by some. I think good quality PB is very important to good results.

These cookies are exactly what I have been looking for.  I am the mother of 1 1/2 year of twins and am always looking for soft, moist, chewy cookie recipes that they can chew without the fear of them choking.  The have a tremendous peanut butter flavor.  YUMMMMMMM!  That's what my children said when they tried them.

This is a good recipe.  I followed it exactly except for adding a 1/4 C more flour.  They taste nice and peanut-buttery (there's a whole cup of pb in it! most recipes have half that).  Only four stars because they're kind of dry when you're eating them, but that's probably because of the peanut butter.

These cookies taste fairly good but the way they end up in the end seems like they are undercooked but no matter how much more you cook them they don't get that cookie consistency. It's too "melt-in-your-mouth" instead of chewy. I was kind of disappointed in them. They'd be so much better if they were actually more chewy and wholesome rather than completely melting in your mouth.

This is a great recipe!!  Followed directions exactly and they came out awesome.  I read some previous reviews about dough being runny and they must have done something wrong along the way because I was able to roll it without refrigeration.

My favorite peanut butter cookie. Not too sweet. They stayed perfectly round did not crack. If peanut butter cookie dough has too much flour the dough is dry and they will crack around the edges. I did not smash with fork too hard. They are soft but with just the right amount of sugar not to leave that grainy feeling of sugar in your mouth. I had no problem rolling them out. I used a fresh jar of peanut butter. The dough was light and fluffy. Only thing I did different from recipe is used the mixer to add flour as the instructions said to stir it in.

Made these randomly tonight as we had a sweet tooth....love them!  They were very fast to prepare, did not scorch even in my sinister burn-everything-a-little oven, and they were super soft and just the right amount of sweetness!  Will definitely make these again :) Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe is great!  My cookies were a hit for the wonderful cast I was filming with.  The only thing I added of my own were real chopped peanuts.  Comment from the enjoyers of these cookies was, "They could use more sugar.". I love the amount of sugar & brown sugar added the extra flavor, so thanks & great recipe!

I've been looking for a full flavored peanut butter cookie.  This is the best I have found so far.  It's a nice crunchy outside with a soft flavorful center.  Kudo's to Joey and thanks for sharing with us.

These cookies tasted ok, but they weren't our favorite. The dough was really runny and hard to handle. I put it in the fridge and managed to roll them in balls but when I tried to make the criss cross mark with the fork it was just a gummy mess. I don't think I will make these again.

as many other users have said - my result was cakey,  not chewy.  Good with chocolate chips, but not what I prefer in a plain PB cookie.  Will definitely use again for PB/chocolate chip cookies, though.

I always use extra crunchy peanut butter to thicken it up and add a bag of white chocolate chips and it's always a hit.

These are the best peanut butter cookies recipe ever! I so much prefer chewy cookies than crunchy cookies.  So if you like soft and chewy cookies this is the recipe for you.

Best peanut butter cookie recipe I've tried.  Awesome recipe, the cookies come out nice and moist.  I roll the dough around a bite sized snicker bar before I cook them.

I've made this 3 times. The last two I doubled the recipe because I can't keep them in the house for long before they are gone. Way to go Joey! The perfect taste for peanut butter lovers. I make it exactly how the recipe reads. Bravo!!

I thought I would try something different and made these cookies instead of the flourless peanut butter cookies I always make, BOY did I make a mistake. These cookies are very dry and they have very little peanut butter flavor. Don't waste your ingredients.

These are great if you love a cookie that really tastes of peanut butter like I do.   I add chocolate chips just for fun, but honestly, I don't find the recipe needs any adjustments.

These cookies are excellent using the recipe as is. Be very careful about over cooking. Too dark on the bottom and it takes away from the flavor of the cookie a lot.  Definitely try this one. It's a keeper. Tastes like the cookies Mom used to make.

These were super easy to make, not the best PB cookie I've ever had, but I'd still make these again with some minor changes (3/4 cup brown sugar, and I'd add nuts next time). I made these exactly as the recipe says, except I rolled them in cinnamon and sugar before I baked them, and my dough didn't get sticky until the last batch of cookies were getting ready to go in the oven. If you have a problem w/ stickyness just make sure your butter is softened, not melted & put your dough in the fridge between batches to keep it from melting.

Wow!  I baked these yesterday, and they are still super moist and creamy today.  I'm pleasantly surprised.  Followed the recipe exactly, except that I added Guittard milk chocolate chips.  Exceptional.  Thank you Joey.

not too bad a recipe, i found the dough a little too sticky for rolling by hand. It is not quite the moist chewy peanut butter cookie I was looking for, but over all not bad. The batch of cookies certainly won't go to waste.

Followed the recipe exactly as written.  The taste was exactly what I was looking for - sweet and very peanut buttery.  The cookies weren't too soft or too crunchy - just the right consistency.  Only thing I found is that it takes a little more than 1 Tbs to make a "regular" sized cookie, and thus I yielded a lot less.

These were pretty good, at least for a base recipe. As all recipes, I first made as is and baked only six cookies to try as they came out. Right off the bat I added some additional salt, I would say double it from the start. Baked another batch of six and decided to add some more sugar as well. I was fine with the amount of flour and peanut butter, they gave a nice consistency. But if you do nothing else, double the salt and at least roll in sugar before baking. Salt can easily make or break a recipe, both if over or under done. Mine were baked at 350 for 10 min on non-stick cookie sheets.

I have found my new peanut butter cookie recipe, I think.  These were very good.  The recipe was easy to make and they turned out very pretty.  My only dislike was mine turned out kind of dry.  I usually store cookies in a large ziploc bag.  Many of these broke inside the bag.  I did use the convection feature on my oven so maybe that made a difference.  It hasn't before but next time I make these, I try it without the convection.  All in all, a wonderful peanut buttery cookie that I would most definately make again and again.

This recipe is "okay." I like really sweet cookies and this one has a lot of peanut butter flavor... which is good but it overwhelms the cookie; I want to taste some of the sugar!  Rolling the cookies into balls was no problem, I put the dough in the freezer for 5-10 mins. and also wet my fork for the designs. Surprisingly that was the easy part. I had trouble with the baking process.  the bottoms burnt very easily well the tops looked undercooked.

I added 1/4c of flour and rolled the dough into balls by hand. Other than that, as many have said about varying cook times, this was an awesome recipe.

If you cook this cookie and it isn't good..you did it wrong. (*COFECHIC) And for the rest of you..this cookie is so good I cooked it twice the second time I made cookie bars and I used 1/2 cup of peanut butter and 1/2 cup of Nutella.instead of the 1c peanut butter ....yeah baby EnJoY!

These cookies are nice and soft!  The only change I made was to add a cup of chocolate chips, which was delicious!!  My husband said he could eat the whole batch.

The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I'm always in search of "the one" peanut butter cookie recipe and this wasn't quite "it."  I do really, really like these though...LOVE the texture.  Maybe there's just something missing for me, not sure what it is but I will definately make again and experiment.  Maybe these will eventually be a 5-star recipe for me.

Loved it! Not too sweet, crunchie and soft in the middle. Added a bit less of peanut butter, because I ran out :) Also added extra raisins which go extremely well with these cookies!

I follow this recipe to the tee and always come out with perfect cookies that everyone loves.  They're also super fast to make so great for those days you don't have much time.  The dough also freezes well.

This is my go to pb cookie recipe. Every time I make them I get rave reviews. If I want to sweeten them up I add chocolate chips. I also put the dough in the fridge before working with it to make it easier to roll.

These are very good! Not too sweet and they're very peanut butter-y.  I followed this recipe exactly, but I made bigger cookies so I had to bake them a little bit longer. This is a definite keeper! Thanks :)

I made this recipe exactly as stated but I put an extra scoop of peanut butter in for good measure (can never have too much PB) they turned out perfect I wouldn't change a thing. I did not have any problem with the dough it was a little soft but plenty greasy so it formed balls beautifully. Im not really sure where some people went wrong but I found the recipe and measurements spot on.

Good!  I made them like the recipe says and they turned out very tasty.  They were even fine for me to roll between my hands into balls (without using water).  Apparently my friend Brittany's fiance Matt loves peanut butter cookies and these were no exception!

These look good, an easy recipe to make, and have good consistency, but not as peanut buttery as I was hoping.  I'll blame store brand peanut butter.  Do refrigerate for a while before scooping out to form better balls.

WOW! This recipe is fabulous! I made it for 'snack day' at my office and I've never seen a cookie go so fast! They were the perfect blend of soft and chewy, with just a bit of crunch around the edges. They were thinner than some peanut butter cookies I've made before, so if you like thick and fluffy this might not be for you - but you should try them anyways because they're so good! :)

Absolutely delicious and I wouldn't change a thing! I made these for my coffee shop customers and they all agreed that these are the best peanut butter cookies they've ever had. These cookies have a more intense peanut butter flavor and they turn out soft and chewy. I do recommend that you not leave them in the oven too long for fear that they haven't finished baking. I left them in for the max amount of recommended time and they turned out perfect. They didn't look like they were done, but I followed the instructions and was pleasantly surprised.

These were soo easy, not that cookies are normally hard.  I used 3/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar instead of half and half because i think it brings a nicer flavor to cookies.  I used vanilla soy milk instead of dairy and doubled the vanilla.  I also used all natural peanut butter, which i think may have added a little bit of oil to the cookies but im sure would taste just as good with regular cheap peanut butter, i might try chunky next time for a little bit of texture change. I baked them for 10 min at 350 on a dark pan with one of those silicone backing sheets (these make perfect cookies)!!  I did not add any extra flower nor do anything to the fork and they did not stick to the fork or break around the edges like some others had problems with.

I decided to try this recipe as it had so many reviews.  I was looking for something with more peanut butter flavor than the traditional recipe. I found this recipe had a very good peanut butter flavor (I used Skippy Creamy). I tried it without the milk as some suggested and the first 9 cookies were dry and mealy tasting. I added a good one TB of mik to the rest of the batter and these cookies came out soft and chewy in the middle and slightly crisp on the edges with much improved flavor. The batter was moist, though not wet and thin. This is one cookie where my middle size Pampered Chef cookie scooper was a blessing. I used a damp fork to make criss crosses on the cookies. They only spread to the amount I pressed them out to. With this scooper the yeild was a little over 2 dozen cookies.  They do need to rest on the cookie sheet a few minutes before moving them off of the sheet.  All ovens vary. I have a new oven so I am experimenting with the times. I used the middle rack -oven at 375* for 8 1/2 minutes for the perfect cookie. Overall I like that the cookie is not overly sweet and still has a good peanut butter taste.

If you love peanut butter you'll love these cookies, they are terrific with a glass of milk.  I normally don't tamper with a good thing, but on my second batch I added a milk chocolate kiss after making the fork marks, the peanut butter/chocolate combination makes the cookies even better.

Wow so good. I ate so many just out of the oven.  Although these are not very chewy at all. I prefer chewy cookies but the taste is so great, I can deal with the softness of this cookie.  My family loved them. MY husband liked eating the dough more. Ty for the Rock Awsome recipe.

I have been searching for a peanut butter cookie recipe for about 8 years and now I can stop searching.  I made the cookies large, I could only fit 9 on a cookie sheet and cooked them for 10-11 minutes. They were soft, chewy, and have a strong peanut butter taste.  PERFECT.  My second batch I substituted a 1/4 cup of white sugar with brown sugar so there was more brown sugar than white sugar. One word DELICIOUS.

Not dense enough.  Very fluffy, cake-like.  Could almost taste the flour in the cookie and not enough peanut butter flavor.  Sticky batter that didn't allow me to use the fork design.

My 15yr old daughter actually makes these cookies & they are awesome!! The first time she made them she up'd the amount of peanur butter(she loves p-nut butter) & has been making them that way ever since.  Everyone @ work requests them on a weekly basis.If you are near a Whole Foods you may want to try their fresh ground honey roasted peanut butter that you grind by the pound these are quite tasty too!!

i've made cookies before but never peanut butter  ones. I was searching for awhile to find the right one and I decided to try this one. They came out great. They were soft and had just enough peanut butter flavor. I plan on making these again. Thanks

Awesome recipe.  I only had natural peanut butter on hand, which, when at room temp., is pretty liquid-y, so I omitted the milk.  My cookies turned out great, a little crumbly, which is probably due to omitting the milk, but still very yummy!

I do believe this is the first review I have ever done on AllRecipes though I have been using the website for years.  
Anyway, these cookies are the absolute best.  I love to make cookies and for Christmas I make literally thousands of cookies.  Until now I have never had a peanut butter cookie recipe that I have loved.  My family has loved all of the previous PB cookie recipes I have made.  But this one, I love.  I cannot stop eating these cookies.  I have made them several times over the course of the past couple of weeks.  And every time I have been ecstatic about the way they have turned out. I didn't change anything about the recipe.  It is perfect and now a part of my Christmas Cookie Lineup.

I thought this was an easy recipe. My peanut butter was pretty raw, meaning it was pure peanut and not much butter.So the cookies came out a bit dry. SO I would reccommend Jiffy or something a bit mainstream, mass made. Only for the moisture. Otherwise, the texture and the taste was very very good. I baked mine at 350 F for 10 min, even after putting the dough in the fridge after each batch.

My hubby loved these cookies.  My first attempt @ PB cookies wasnt pretty, however, this recipe was a winner.  I know I added more peanut butter (at least 1/2 cup more) and more white sugar to offset the additional peanut butter.  The dough was so light and fluffy...very yummy.  A great recipe that I will use over and over again.

These aren't great.  Lack of peanut butter taste and not very sweet.  They also did not spread out.  The dough had a good consistency.

I will use this recipe again for a traditional peanut butter cookie. I had to bake mine a bit longer to keep them from cracking while taking them off the sheet.

I enjoyed this recipe very much!  I tend to read the negative reviews first to see what I'm getting myself into -- don't be swayed by them.  The complaints are fixable!  Read the positive reviews for some quick fixes.  The suggestions for refrigerating dough, using a wet fork to make the criss cross, and adjusting the bake time due to oven differences really helped!  My own two cents: If you have a 1/8 cup scoop (it's often called a "coffee scoop"), use it to dole out the dough into balls.  They shape better and make it easier to make uniform sizes.  Also, lining the cookie sheet with parchment paper makes a difference in the transfer to the cooling rack as it lessens the stickiness.  If you feel like the cookie isn't holding together well, use crunchy peanut butter.  I'd never made peanut butter cookies before, but I found this recipe easy and tasty.

I was disappointed with these. The cooking time is way too low - I baked mine for almost 20 minutes. 8-10 min. wasn't even close. And I had to add some flour.

These cookies were ok, but I'll probably try another recipe next time. They came out quite flat and not as peanut-flavoured as I had hoped.

I did an unofficial taste test between these cookies and Mrs. Sigg's peanut butter cookies on this site, following both recipes exactly. These cookies were just ok. They didn't have as much peanut butter flavor as I would have liked and they were a little crumbly and dry. The other recipe won without a doubt. I would make these again if I was short on peanut butter but I'm sure there are better recipes out there.

Around 7:30 tonight, I got a major hankering for something sweet.  After a quick glance in my cabinet, I realized there were few things I could make.  I decided peanut butter cookies would be best and came to allrecipes for help.  I tried this one.  Not only was it quick and easy, these are quite possibly the best peanut butter cookies I've ever tasted.  I used my Kitchenaid mixer to blend the ingredients and chilled the dough a bit while the oven preheated.  I baked for 10 minutes and they were perfect.  I've already added this recipe to my permanent collection.  It's so good.

I've made these several times, and everyone just
raves about them. I've used creamy and crunchy
peanut butter, and I think I like crunchy the best.
I let the dough mix a full 5 minutes in my Kitchen
Aid and the consistency was perfect. 9 minutes at
375 in my oven seems just about right. I only get
24 out of my batch, but I may be using a bigger
cookie scoop. 5 stars and highly recommended!

I love this cookie recipe. The dough was a bit oily so I layed a paper towel out and before rolling the balls in sugar i placed all the balls on the paper towel for about 8 min this method was great for getting rid of the excess oil, I doubled the recipe, i like giant cookies so I scooped  1/4 cup of dough at a time rolled them in sugar and i raised the baking time to 
14 min, i also flattened the cookie dough slightly with the bottom of a cup then used a fork to make a criss cross pattern on top. After cooking i let the cookies cool in the pan for about 5 min then moved them to cool the rest of the way on a wire rack. This recipe was a success. I put each cookie in an individual sandwich bag. The cookies were still soft and chewy the next day. I will definately use this recipe again.

I was looking for a cookie to send to my brother in LA (from Florida) for his birthday. When I cam across Joey's Peanut Butter Cookies, well Joey is my brothers name! I knew this was the cookie for him and it turns out after being mailed to him they were STILL delicious!!! This is the best peanut butter cookie recipe I have ever had the pleasure to eat!

I wanted to figure out which of two recipes was better (this one and Miss Siggs- both are highly rated) so I made them both and took them to school. While this one was good most people seemed to prefer Miss Sigg's more which had more sugar in it. I'll keep both however as each makes a decent cookie. Thanks for the recipe.

the flavor on these is great! this is one of the rare cases i wished i hadnt read the other reviews on this one. the batter was not soupy or runny for me at all, although a little soft it made balls just fine. also, the cooking time of 10 min i found to be just right. i cooked the first batch for 8 since the other reviews said to take them out before they looked done, and they are REALLY doughy still. but tasty! basically, if you listen to the recipe exactly, these turn out great. for all the complaints, i doubt a recipe got this many good reviews by being horrible, you should probably figure out what you are doing wrong so you can fix it and enjoy these!

These are amazing, my husband and his co-workers go crazy for them. To make them super over the top, I add peanut butter chips and chopped peanuts to the dough and roll in sugar before baking. These are addictive!

I made the recipe, and it wasn't the first time I've made cookies, and they did not turn out for me. The bottoms burn easily, so I had to take them out before 8 minutes and put them on the top rack. In addition to that, it just didn't have the flavor I thought it would, so I tried adding more peanut butter and even some chocolate chips. It was hard to salvage them, my roommate found them edible so I will give it two stars.

Really good recipe!  I used PB Loco peanut butter in raspberry and dark chocolate peanut.  I don't know that you can really taste the raspberry but they're still really good!  I didn't have any problems at all with my dough being too thin.  Perhaps those with the problems aren't fully creaming the butters and sugars?  It needs to get fluffy or else you don't have the air in the dough to help stabilize it.  I also rolled them in sugar and did the typical criss-cross pattern.  Great recipe will be using again!

My hubby loves peanut butter cookies so, I have tried a couple of different recipes, but this one was by far the best. He really loved them. They came out soft and chewy and stayed that way until they were gone. GREAT recipe!!!

My husband would give this one a 5*, but, I did not. The dough was way too runny to form any kind of ball.  I added 3/4 to 1 cup of flour to the mix. I also used chunky peanut butter and I lowed the temp to 350F.  The cookie came out soft and the same size as I put them in the oven.  Over all great cookie and nice peanut butter flavor.

These have a slight powdery texture in your mouth, so they are not the best out there.  However, they are very flavorful and easy to make.

I wanted to make peanut butter cookies for my husband. I really don't like peanut butter cookies and never eat them. Also I'm not a very good baker, well with that said these cookies were excellent, my husband and I could not stop eating them! I followed the recipe the only thing I did differently was lowered the baking temp. to 350. I baked the cookies for 8-9 minutes and they turn out perfect. They look under cooked when you pull them out but they firm up. Thank you for such as easy and yummy recipe.

Great recipe.  Just the right balance of salty and sweet.  I don't like to press my cookies with a fork, so I just rolled them in sugar and baked them - so light and fluffy!

These are just okay for me..not super crazy about them..kinda simple. They were very soft..a few even broke pretty easy. Keep a good eye on them they cook quickly & i had my oven at 350 instead or they wouldn't have turned out for me. 350 was just right. Enjoy!

My husband absolutely loved these cookies.  So much so that he is taking them to work to enter in his teams cookie contest.  Only change I made was I added almost a whole bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I would have used the whole bag but there just wasn't any extra room for more chips in the dough.

We love these cookies, can't stop eating them!  To make them a little healthier (and less fattening) I used light butter, organic/natural PB (it separates so it has to be stirred first) and I also replaced half of the sugar with Splenda.  No one could tell I made the recipe a little healthier.  In my gas oven, 10 minutes baking time made them a little crispy, but I liked them that way.  My husband liked the 8 minute batch better.

Not that great. I'd say this is a basic PB cookie recipe. It wasn't bad just not it's hyped up to be. It's not chewy or soft, it got crunchy and hard quickly. I'll keep looking.

This recipe is awesome!  I follow the recipe exactly but add chopped peanuts as well...sooo yummy!!  The only "problem" is that they're so moist they practically melt in your mouth...but that's what I love about them.

I followed the recipe exactly and mine didn't turned out as I hope.  I picked it out because of the reviews but it was just not good, sorry :(  The dough was very sticky (almost impossible to roll). I put it in the fridge for about 30 mins-- still very sticky.  I scooped it with a big spoon instead.  The finished result is a very crumbly, not enough peanutty-taste and undercooked (even after 14 minutes) cookies.  I will keep on trying the other PB cookies here on this site.

These cookies are really good, but they were missing that little something extra. I made them a 2nd time and added a 12oz bag of peanut butter chips... WOW!!! Just what they needed. Also, be sure to refrigerate your dough and take it out of the oven VERY early. It is deceiving because they harden up and turn brown after they come out of the oven. If they get brown in the oven, it's too late, you will have very crispy, if not burnt, cookies on your hands. I took mine out at 8 min. exactly and had fat, chewy, yummy cookies.

I chilled the dough for about 2 hours - otherwise good luck with the rolling.  Also, I baked them at 350 for 11 minutes.  At this point, they didn't even look done, but I let them sit on the cookie sheet for a few minutes and they firmed up on the outside.  They are the perfect PB cookie!

My cookies turned out crispy, not chewy and flat instead of thick.  I took them out just as the edges turned brown. I didn't refrigerate the dough either before placing them on a baking sheet.  Maybe that will help.  I also found the dough to be very greasy, and the vanilla flavour competing w/ the peanut butter flavour.  I used bourbon vanilla and it has a strong flavour.  I'm not sure I will make these again.

I highly suggest baking at 350 degrees for 10-11 minutes.  They will be very soft when they come out but the bottoms will be golden brown, you dont want cookies to go past golden brown (the rest of the cookie firms up as it cools)!  Remove the cookies as soon as they come out of the oven to a rack lined w/parchment paper.  Also the batter is not as firm as your average cookie batter and I couldnt get the fork tong thing to work but it didnt matter. I used extra chunky PB and these turned out AMAZING!  I got tons of compliments!

My family loved these.  I used chunky peanut butter and they were awesome.  The recipe was very simple and I will definitaly use again.

The taste is somewhat bland. Just not the best peanut butter cookie that I have tasted.

Excellent cookie, I used all brown sugar instead of half white, I also used shortening instead of butter. I also added 2/3 cup of nutella ( chocolate hazlenut spread) it is by far the best peanut butter cookie I have tasted in a long time. Thanks for sharing

Despite many changes worked out perfectly! I used the entire 12 ounce mini jar of peanut butter (peanut butter lovers know it is safer to ones waistline to have a tray of peanut butter cookies rather than a jar of peanut butter), used whole wheat flour as that's all I had on hand, I had no brown sugar and just half a cup of white sugar so I used 3/4 cup of Splenda(the batter wasn'y sweet enough for me). Perhaps it was the whole wheat flour, but I had no trouble with runny batter, mine rolled into balls very easily. After 8 minutes they were done perfectly (always check the bottom of the cookie  as the top is deceivingly pallid). They crumble when hot, but after 10-15 minutes cooling are chewy (with a heavy crumb) and just delicious. I highly recommend this recipe!

Easy to make, one of the first PB cookie recipes that wasn't 'sticky' when rolling into balls or pressing down with the fork.  

Delicious, peanut buttery flavor when baked at the short end of the time specified.  I'm giving it a 4 star because the peanut butter flavor fades if overbaked.

I'll be making these again and keeping a close eye on the bake time.  I love the fact that I didn't have sticky dough residue all over the palms of my hands.

Okay, but really needs at least one more egg - too crumbly.  I used Skippy; so maybe it was the brand of peanut butter.

These cookies were great.  They were soft, light and fluffy.  My husband thought they needed more peanut butter for a more peanut buttery taste but I thought they were perfect. Regardless, he ate seven cookies in one sitting.

WOW - the reviews are right, if you want to make peanut butter cookies that truly do not lose the peanut butter taste after baking, look no further than this recipe.  These are so good and rich, I can't eat more than 2 at a time.  I'm giving these out to my neighbors as part of my Christmas cookie batch.  I followed the recipe completely and did not change a thing.  My dough was still pretty mushy even after adding the flour, too hard to roll into a ball so I just dropped spoonfuls onto the cookie sheet.  If you want dough you can roll, add more flour, but then again, do you want to mess with this recipe?  I dont - its that good!!

Made these for my husband.  I don't like peanut butter, but his comment was they were more than acceptable. Very high praise from him.  Easy recipe will make it again. Used buttermilk instead of regular, don't know if it affected the taste, but it was what I had on hand

I've been searching for quite some time for a good peanut cookie, as most recipes come out with the same results: boring, flat and bland...so when I found this recipe, I was a bit hesitant but decided to go for it. I thought for sure they wouldn't be any different. I am so glad I tried it! They are great! I added peanut butter chips to the mix. I like how the cookies are a bit puffier than others, and are on the chewy side. Unfortunately, I used a generic brand of peanut butter, and I agree with one taster who said that a good quality brand is a must. Will use my favorite brand the next time I make these. Thank you for a great recipe!

They, unfortunately, were mushy & not golden brown on the edges after the recommended cooking time so I cooked them longer.  When the edges just started to turn golden, I took them out and found that they were black burnt on the bottom.  I will try again but I was a little disappointed because they all ended up like rocks.

These were only so so for me. The peanut butter stood out for sure, but I was hoping for a little more sweetness. I added a 1/2 cup more flour as I read in reviews, but my cookies still came out a little thin. I like a thick PB cookie.  I will keep trying this recipe with a little tweaking here and there. THANKS!

I love this recipe.  I did these as drop cookies because I wanted to ensure that they were soft and dense.  They came out perfectly! They have just the right ratio of peanut butter to butter flavor in my opinion.  Not too overwhelming.  Great cookies!

These were very yummy.  I made everything exactly as the recipe states, and they turned out great.  HINT... I rolled the cookies in sugar.  AND YES, as others have stated the dough is very soft, and hard to roll into balls, but it's do-able.  They turn out yummy, and soft in the middle.  Good cookies I will make again.

These peanut butter cookies were soft, delicious and addicting! I just made them to send to my brother in college, but my friends ate almost all of them as soon as they were out of the oven! Hint: Spray the bottom of the fork with Pam cooking spray so it won't stick to the dough when you make the mark on it.

I did not care for these. I was not able to form these in balls as the recipe indicated, they were more or less drop cookies. The taste factor was on the very low end of the scale. So I would suggest saving your ingredients for another P.B cookie recipe.

Anytime I'm required to bring or make something for a party or function, I make these cookies. I (and the cookies) have become famous. They're always a huge hit, everyone loves them, and they always disappear quickly.

I follow this recipie exactly, and I have no problems. I do add peanut butter chips, which go perfectly with the chewy cookie. I also use a teaspoon instead of a tablespoon to form the balls of dough. They make for perfect, 2 bite cookies that everyone loves.

the BEST PB cookie recipe ever.
Make sure you make these by hand. Using an electric mixer gives a crispy texture whereas by hand I get a chewy, soft cookie. Also, remove them from the oven when the edges are golden, sooner rather than later and let them cool on the baking tray. Do not overbake and they'll be perfect.

These are hands down the BEST peanut butter cookies ever!!  I make them for work every year (for the last 2 years) and they leave everyone begging for the recipe and more cookies; Rather than standard peanut butter cookies, I make them into a small ball around a Hershey's Kiss and bake as directed.  They are soft and YUMMY!

I thought these were just grand. If you're looking for a crunch to your peanut butter cookies, these are not yours. Actually I like both types of peanut butter cookies, but my husband loves the moistness and denseness of this recipe. I found the dough seemed sticky at first, but after a few minutes it "tightened" up and I was able to roll the dough into balls. They are not good cookies for packing. They are tender and break easily. For the record I made this recipe with Zimmerman's natural peanut butter, not a big name brand but really good natural peanut butter from Pennsylvania that has no sugar or additives.

After making this recipe for years (from this site), I lost my recipe card, then realized I never reviewed the recipe. Shame! Peanut Butter is my favorite food, and I am extremely picky (choosey mothers choose Jif!). I can't believe this has had some negative reviews. I guess taste varies. This recipe has made me a hit many times. I ADORE these cookies, and hope folks won't be discouraged from trying them. The only change, is I use an extra egg (medium). This is one of my top five favorite recipes from this site!

This cookie fell apart a lot when I made it.  But, then again, I'm a dork.

Well, it tasted good anyway.

No one in my house liked these cookies at all.  We each only had one cookie and then no one touched them again.  I love soft cookies but these reminded me of the consistancy of playdough.  Not tasty at all!

I think these cookies turned out well, but my dough was extremely runny, maybe my egg was too large or something.  But Iheard no complaints from my husband!

We really LOVE these cookies at our house.  My boyfriend loves peanut butter cookies, and I like them because they aren't too overpowering.  When I make these, the dough tends to have the consistency of chocolate chip cookie dough.  I noticed in reading the reviews others talk about hte dough being sticky.  I have found that if I use a spoon, like I do with choc chip dough instead of rolling, and still make my criss cross, the cookies come out great!  try it.  it will make your life a whole lot easier!!

I thought these cookies were just average...I had higher expectations based on the high ratings. They were easy to make though and a good recipe to involve toddlers in the process!

Our first impressions of these cookies when looking at the recipe was that the ingredients seemed easy to obtain and fitting for a peanut butter recipe.  The time it takes to bake the cookies is also very reasonable.  When actually putting the ingredients together, things went smoothly and very easily.  After everything was mixed together though, the batter just looked like a clump of peanut butter.  It was very easy to form balls of dough, which spead up the time too.  A dissapointment of these cookies was that they didn't cook evenly.  The bottom burnt in about eight minutes, but at that time the top wasn't nearly done.  In the end the cookies where ok, but kind of bland.  They were gooey wich was nice, but the taste wasn't anything special.  I would make this recipe again, but it definitly wasn't my favorite peanut butter cookie recipe.

I have been searching for a very long time to find a really good PB cookie recipe. I have tried many, many recipes. This is by far the best. The taste and texture are exactly what I have been searching for. I was making these one night, it was getting pretty late, and I fell asleep while they were cooling, before I could put them in an air-tight container. The next morning when I woke up I was really upset, because I thought I had ruined them by leaving them sitting out all night. To my great surprise and relief, they were not dried out at all. Still very moist and chewy. I will be using this recipe, hopefully, for many years to come. Thank you P.L. Weiss for submitting it.

I loved these cookies, They were great. I added a 1/4c Molasses, a bag of milk chocolate chips & a 1/2c of peanuts. then I pressed them with a sugar coated fork. and cooked them for about 12 minutes. A soft center with a crispy coat. AWSOME!

I did not notice a difference between these peanut butter cookies and others I have made in the past, but they were good cookies made with a simple recipe.  I followed other user's suggestions and chilled the sticky dough before using it, which I would definitely recommend.

Destroy all other peanut butter cookie recipes and guard this one!  This IS the most true to taste peanut butter cookie ever invented.  How the recipe can use so little flour and have a great cookie turn out is a true mystery.  Thanks Joey!

These were good.  I used margarine instead of butter wity good results.  Refridgerate for 1/2 hr before rolling.  Rolling smaller cookies may result in burnt bottoms.  I baked at top rack - with bigger cookies and had good results.  Will make these again!

Great cookies the day I made them.  I ate four at once.  They got pretty hard the second day, even wrapped tightly.  Definitely better to eat the same day.  The kids loved them.  I'll make them again.

Oh my goodness, these cookies turned out so well, they were not only delicious but very easy to make.  I have made p-nut butter cookies in the past and have never been satisfied.  I am sending these to my husband whose serving in Iraq. I know he will absolutely love them! Thanks for the Recipe!!!!!!!

Yum Yum! Made them for my Best friend who's a PB Monster! She's still talking about them. I added *shredded coconut* to give a chewier texture. Soft on the inside, yet crumbly and crisp on the outer.

YUM! These cookies are very moist and not too sugary. They have just the right amount of peanut butter taste without it being overpowering. I actually had a bag of chocolate and peanut butter chips that I threw in the batter, and the cookies came out great. The peanut butter chips gave a little extra peanut-kick, and the small amount of chocolate gave it a subtle little surprise. This recipe was also very easy to make. Will be made many more times!

I only had one egg left and I wanted to make some pb cookies so this recipe was perfect.  The cookies came out soft and chewy.  I read a lot of reviews that said the dough was wet, but a little bit of flour on the palm of my hands made rolling the dough easy.  I also used a potato masher to make quick criss-crosses and sprinkled the tops with sugar.  I always use good-quality p.b. in my cookies and I think that helped get the quality I desired.  Excellent cookies!

These cookies were wonderful. I have the allrecipes cookbook and I was craving cookies. I found this recipe and I couldn't believe how simple it was! They were chewy and had a very peanut buttery taste! I will definitely be making these again!!!

i don't agree with any of this recipe's rave reveiws. I'm an experienced baker and followed the directions exactly, but didn't get that moist, chewy cookie everyone was talking about. these cookies were very dry and crumbly. although they did hold there shape well (a little to well, mine looked like thick disks). i won't be making these again.

I don't see what the big hoopla is about these cookies.  They are all right.  I used butter instead of margarine & I used the small scoop from Pampered Chef to scoop out the balls of dough, which I then rolled in granulated sugar & criss-crossed with a fork.  I didn't find them to be chewy at all, but they kind of melt in your mouth.  I'm still looking for a chewy peanut butter cookie.

I used margarine and chunky peanut butter. The dough is so sticky I had to refrigerate it to roll into balls.It seemed like I really had to watch while they baked to make sure they didn't overcook. Maybe there is no need for the added milk? The taste was "off" and I can't figure out why. I guess I prefer a crunchy cookie and think I will go back to my mother's recipe. Sorry Joey.

This is my college daughter's absolute favorite peanut butter cookie recipe. Made a batch for the dorm and work-everyone has the same question.  Why are you teasing us by making them so small? The cookies hold their shape and are what one would expect a great peanut butter cookie to look and taste-like in addition to being soft. Wonderful!

My five year old made these with me and wanted to add chocolate chips.  They are good!  But I warn you--when you want to go for that second one (and you will)--STOP!  They are so rich, you'll pay for it!  But it's probably worth it!

These cookies were GREAT!!! Just the right balance of chewy and crunchy! I had gotten some generic peanut butter, which the kids HATE for sandwiches, and decided to use it up in cookies...this recipe made that nasty peanut butter taste fantastic...thanks!!!

This was a very good chewy cookie, not dry like a lot of PB cookies.  The dough was sticky but you could refrigerate it like another reviewer mentioned or sprinkle plain white sugar over the top and flatten with a fork, this makes it easier to flatten and gives it a slightly sweeter taste.

Beware of all the rave reviews!!! These cookies stink. I was looking for a new peanut butter cookie recipe, but this will no way replace it. The dough is too sticky, they burn without warning, they do not spread well, nor do they taste good. I am writing this review, so that no one wastes their time. YUK.

This cookie was not what I had in mind.=( California girl was looking for a real chewy, super peanut-buttery cookie. This cookie was soft and fairly yummy, but only a "good" cookie to me. Not the best. I'm not sure the extra tummy crunches were worth it. I'm happy some "viewers" loved it though.

This is really a good cookie.  Every person I have given this cookie, say it is the most flavorful and moist peanut butter cookie they have eaten.  Sometimes there are a few cookies left the next day and they are even better.

I try MANY new peanut butter cookie recipes. They are my husbands favorite cookie. This recipe is easy to make and tastes great. The cookie is moist. I try new things in my recipes. Peanut Butter chips and chocolate chips added to this recipe makes it complete and fantastic.

I have absolutely no trust in reviews anymore. This is without a doubt, a below average recipe.  Ok, but would never make them again.  Bland is the best word for them. I used to have an awesome peanut cookie recipe and I couldn't  find it so I tried this one. I used Jiff Natural.  I should have known better with a name like "Joey's cookies"!

I used wheat pastry flour. Other than that, everything works: milk is a nice add. If you make your cookie batter balls too large, then you must cook them longer: the batter spreads as it cooks, but the criss-cross imprint holds well. Do let them cool before transferring to the rack. They batter was very light: like mousse, so keep the balls small and tight. I'd make these again!

So easy to make, and delicious! I did not roll them into a ball first, I just spooned them out and pressed each with a fork; they look more homemade that way and get crispier around the edges. Yum!

I LOVE this recipe!! I have been making these for years and years. They are my go to recipe for peanut butter cookies, and are the best I've ever had. I use this recipe every year for my Christmas peanut butter blossoms. The only thing I do different is add a little extra peanut butter, just to make them even MORE peanut buttery! I don't understand anyone who says this recipe isn't good!

First attempt at making peanut butter cookies and they turned out pretty well. Tasty and definitely a lot of peanut butter flavor. I'll probably try to make them again, but feel like we could do without as much flour.

These are just okay.  You can barely taste the peanut butter which is surprising since this recipe uses twice as much as most other recipes.  I see other reviewers have described the texture as chalky or pasty.  I would agree.  The cookies didn’t really spread or raise when baked.  This recipe also uses less sugar than most so if you like a not-so-sweet cookie, you might like it.  After baking the first pan, I decided to roll the remaining cookies in sugar before baking.  We liked those much better, but not enough to make again.

These are the best peanut butter cookies I think I’ve ever had.  They are soft and chewy, and fairly easy to make. I will definitely be making these again, as my family had a fit over them! The only thing I changed was that I heated my oven to 350 degrees, not 375, but everyone’s oven cooks differently.

If you are looking for the best traditional PB cookie, these are not for you. I suspect those who didn't like it, especially those who called them "chalky" confuse texture with taste. The dough is light and fluffy, (like mousse instead of pudding) and the baked cookies are the same. They never get hard, nor do they get really brown. They are done however, as long as the edges are slightly browned. The texture is distracting the first few cookies, but if you let them sit on your tongue for a little before swallowing they taste like a spoonful of PB. I really liked them.

Not bad....I would add at least 1/4 c. more of flour. Had to chill dough before baking. Would try again with that change and then make the final decision.

Followed the recipe step by step.  Very disappointed. 

Cookies turned out better, bland, and almost inedible. Bummer cause was hungry for a snack.

Cookies came out "fluffy".  There wasn't any of the density or chewieness you normally expect from a peanut butter cookie.  I'm the type of baker that normally uses a scale and has 2 oven thermometers hanging from the rack (back and front) and I followed this recipe exactly.  I even had 2 batches, one I pulled out a few minutes early and one I kept in for the full duration.  The ones that came out early still failed to exhibit that "density".  

Everyone universally agreed that the texture was not what they were hoping for.

People either seem to love or hate these cookies.  I found them to be be very cake like, sort of like mini peanutbutter pancakes.  But I wanted a chewy dense cookie and was really disappointed in these.  Also, the batter was too damp to leave fork imprints in the tops.

Easy to make. I like that they don't call for shortening, bake up and stay soft, and are less heavy. Family loves them. I added about 1/2 cup oats for my uncle. I might cut back on the sugar a little bit next time. I have a sweet tooth for sure, but these have such a great flavor, they can do without as much sweet. Yummy!

My friend asked me to make her some peanut butter cookies.  I didn’t have a recipe and searched the internet and found Joey’s!!!  I just finished making them and they are amazing.  I thought the dough was perfect for using the metal cookie scoop.  The first batch I made I forgot to crisscrosse them with a fork so they were puffed up.  They still had time left to bake so I took a fork, pressed down and continued baking them.  They were perfect.  The second batch I added chocolate chips and they are to die for.  I accidentally added 1 teaspoon  baking powder and not the 3/4 it called for, ommited the milk and I think they are terrific.  I now have a peanut butter cookie recipe.  I think my friend is going to love  these.

They turned out okay. I would agree with other reviewers that it’s not very peanut buttery. Not a bad cookie, they were decent and easy to make... especially with kids. Just not five stars.

Although the cookies taste ok, the batter was extremely sticky, and the cookies crumbled and fell apart. I followed the recipe exactly. i may try again and add more flour and skip the milk as someone recommended.

My husband has taken to a bit of baking since he retired. He made these with no help from me haha! They turned out great and the only addition was some chocolate chips melted and dried on the top. I have a feeling he will make them again.

These are perfect...we made sone exactly like the recipe called for and some with different chips in them...peanut butter chips and milk chocolate chips...all were amazing and soft. The milk chocolate chips were the best because the chocolate cut down of the peanut butter a bit. Additionally, we took about 2 cups worth and ground them in the processor with about 4 oz of cream cheese, rolled them into balls, and dipped them into chocolaelte for little truffles...best we have ever had...beats making reese's peanut butter centers. Best of luck!

Not the best, but pretty good.  Like several others, I think they needed a bit more flour, as mine spread to about 2 1/2 times their size and were very thin.  The flavor is mild, and in the future I think I will use half the butter and twice the peanut butter.  One ease way to do the cross on them is to mix sugar and cinnamon together, sprinkle a quarter tsp or so on each before cooking, then press the fork into the top.

I’m not very good at baking and followed the recipe as written. It’s thought they were delicious. My daughter didn’t care for them but I’m the peanut butter addict in the house. I read now that you could leave the milk out, I added it but wondered what it was adding to the recipe. I thought they were very peanutbuttery and liked the texture of them. Will make again.

One of my favorite recipes! I’d say even better than the Betty Crocker recipe. I followed the recipe exactly but I cooked mine for 15 minutes (because my oven always takes longer) and they came out perfect! I sprinkled a little sugar on top too. Will definitely be saving this recipe

Tried this recipe for a fundraiser. Disappointed. Flavor of dough was good, consistency was thinner than I felt it should be. I did pop the dough in the freezer for a bit to make it easier to make into balls, worked but warmed quickly. Finished product; flavor was ok, but the cookies crumbled.

My husband claims these are the best peanut butter cookies I've made yet (23 yrs of marriage!). I made two changes: 1) I opted to use 1c of white flour while substituting the remaining amt. w/ wheat  flour and 2) I added more peanut butter (approx 1 1/4c total). I made the cookies on the smaller side to offer less guilt per serving and create just the right amt of "chewy sweet"treat to compliment a hot cup of java.

So I'm not sure how I feel about this recipe. In the end, after baking a few extra minute, they really are delicious, thin, soft. I didn't add any extra flour and the dough is very loose, I used a metal scoop.l, a wet a fork to press. They are really peanut buttery and they taste good, just not really what I expected. I think I'll use this recipe again?

good tip to dip the fork in water before doing the criss-cross.  Worked well.  I don't think this is the best recipe ever but it certainly did the job on making decent pb cookies.  I felt the pb flavor was a little lacking (adding chopped peanuts may enhance the flavor) but all in all it was alright.  I made about two inch cookies, baked at 350 and they took about 14 minutes.

Really good if you roll them in a mixture of the two sugars with a little cinnamon before baking.

These are delicious cookie. Followed recipe just added m&ms. Mixed it all in my kitchenaid and the batter looked like peanutbutter fluff. But surprisingly not sticky at all. I was able to scoop up balls w a regular spoon and baked for 8 minutes. Tip make sure u dont remove cookies from baking sheet until they are cooled down because they  will break. This is a keeper.

As a 66 year old veteran of eating cookies, these are the best Peanut butter cookies I have ever ate or made ( and my wife agrees!) Please note, we love cookies of all sorts.  We used extra crunchy peanut butter because that is all we keep in the house. I ended up baking them a bit longer than listed, but per instructions waited until the edges browned. This resulted in the bottoms being caramelized like a praline. Thank you for a great recipe that uses peanut butter in mass ! Awesome cookies! Oh woe to my waist line! I bet theese will be awesome for dunking in our morning coffee! Thank you for this recipe!

These cookies are fantastic! They are a tiny bit sweet to me if you use commercial peanut butter, so I'd use slightly less sugar. I also used chunky peanut butter and I think they are the best peanut butter cookies I've ever had.

Delicious and peanut buttery! I halved the recipe and used half a flax “egg.” Baked at 350 for 11ish mins then let them sit on the baking sheet to cool. The reviews are killer and make you wonder if they’ll turn out, and I just say try them and hopefully you’re not one of the unlucky ones. :)

These are incredible. The recipe's perfect for the yummiest peanut butter cookies, but also great for improvisations. I like to add a half-cup of mini chocolate chips as a reward for my hubby. I've also given him a warm batch of cookies and some jelly to spread on them. If the naysayers are giving you doubts about trying this recipe, Be of good cheer. If you don't personally enjoy the cookies, there are millions of folks out there who'd love them as a gift.

Kudos for this fabulous recipe.

The oven temperature should be 350 not 375.  I did not like it, too much flour, not enough peanut butter flavor.

How in the world can this many people like this recipe?! It needs so many modifications to even begin to make a decent cookie. I bake A LOT of cookies and I just knew when the batter was finished these weren't going to be pretty. I say batter because no one in their right mind could call it dough. Even if you could get past their horrible texture, they don't even taste like peanut butter. Awful- look elsewhere and don't waste your ingredients.

These cookies are very good but  I only got about 30 cookies out of the batch because I like bigger cookies. Otherwise, they would have been way too small. Overall very good.

Amazing cookies! Used half crunchy peanut butter and half honey peanut butter. Also instead of brown sugar used 1 cup of white and 2 tbsp of pure maple syrup. And almond milk instead of regular because I didn’t have regular milk

First, my husband liked these cookies a lot! He says they are chewy and not too sweet. I felt the cookies lacked enough peanut butter flavor. I added 1 tsp. vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon based on other reviews, and still felt the peanut butter flavor was too subtle. The dough is super oily when you're done mixing due to the low amount of flour. After resting in the refrigerator overnight, I had trouble forming the dough into balls because it would fall apart. The cookies didn't turn out as pretty as the pictures (and that's ok!) I made 12 cookies, half on a dark pan lined with parchment, half on a light silver pan lined with parchment. The cookies on the dark pan were crispier. For more control over consistency, adjust your baking sheet, time, and temperature. I forgot to make high altitude adjustments, and might try that next time. I'll definitely make these cookies again because my husband is a big fan. As far as needing a peanut butter fix, I'll stick to eating it straight out of the jar!

I'm in a baking mood this holiday season and decided to add a couple of new cookie recipes to my arsenal. I selected 2 peanut butter cookie recipes that had lots of positive reviews to do a comparison. I chose this one and "Classic Peanut Butter Cookies".

This was my first time making peanut butter cookies so I was initially worried after mixing the dough that these were too wet and would ooze into one big glob. I followed the directions (which did not call for refrigeration of the dough) and pressed down once with a fork as specified. When they came out I was surprised that they didn't flatten much but they tasted OK. 

Next I made the "Classic" recipe which calls for refrigerating the dough for an hour before baking. It also says to make a crisscross pattern. Those cookies spread out and developed a crispier outside while still being soft on the inside. To make sure it wasn't strictly the result of the double press, I did the final few cookies without pressing down at all and they still flattened much more than "Joey's" although not as flat as those I had pressed. (The dough had also been at room temp for about 30 minutes by that time)

Both batches were made with the same size dough balls (I use a tablespoon measuring spoon) but "Joey's" was much smaller in diameter after cooking. My husband and I both highly preferred the texture of the "Classic" recipe over these. The taste was not very different and if I had not made the second batch I probably would have been very hap

OMG!!  These are the best pb cookies I've EVER had/made.  My hubby is crazy for pb cookies & he was extremely happy about these so I had to make 2 batches. (Next time I'll just double the recipe). Most recipes only call for 1/2 C of pb, so I had a good feeling about these with using 1 full Cup of pb.

I made one with the original  because we have people who don't like overwhelming peanut. I made another with 1 cup creamy and 1 cup crunchy and added an additional 1/4 cup flour and the peanut fanatics loved it ... will use again

This is a great recipe; I doubled it and they still turned out great (not always the case). I did refrigerate the dough for a couple hours before baking, but otherwise, you can trust this one.  Lots of p-butter taste, crispy edges and a soft middle. Everyone loved them.

Oh so good! My tweak ,I added one bag of peanut butter chips, rolled them into balls then sugar. baked for 10 min. Rest on sheet for 1min. Do not flatten these.
Also if you refrigerate the batter, they roll better.

This is a wonderful recipe, thank you!

Not sure why people rated one star.

I mixed according to ingredients and encountered the same issue with dough being too soft.  To avoid soft dough refrigerate  for about 20 -30 min to firm up to imprint with fork for cute design.
I added an additional 1/2 C flour after all was mixed which worked well for me (I am not high altitude).  I did not keep track of baking time, just waited for edges to brown,  they were perfect.
I made a couple batches, left them in oven to crisp up (these were our favorite)

I'm so happy to see a peanut butter cookie  that does not call for shortening.  This is definitely a keeper.
Thanks again!

In a way they almost tasted more bland in comparison to other peanut butter cookies. And this is coming from someone who LOVES peanut butter cookies! Something just tasted off, and baking them all the way through was a hassle. when they baked all the way through they were so crumbly I could hardly get them off the stones. major let down. I'm going back to Betty Crocker.
Edit: Gave it two stars. Mashed up the cookies, added more peanut butter and some water and made them into dog treats.

I never like things I make.  Have you ever noticed how your own handiwork does not taste as good as those who make it for you?   Well, for the first time, these cookies I made are amazing!  The only thing I did different was make my own peanut butter and used that.  No one complained when they ate the cookies.  So, yeah, it was a success.

I wasn't that impressed. The texture is crumbly and powdery in my mouth, not chewy like expected. I don't think I'll be making these again.

I made these exactly as stated, as I believe that any modifications make an honest review impossible.  Peanut butter cookies are loved by everyone in my house, though many are too difficult for a few members with mouth and gum issues.  These turned out flavorful and soft, even two days later, having been stored in an airtight container.  Even a family member with few teeth was able to enjoy them both with and without dentures in place.  THAT'S how soft these are!  Perfect!  I will be making these from now on and not bothering with anything else.

These turned out fabulous, followed the recipe as is but doubled it easily. Great peanut flavor, wonderful texture...crispy outside chewy inside. My only con is they don't last long, I made a double batch and they were inhaled as soon as they were cool enough to touch. Great recipe, Thanks.
P.S. Those who are having trouble with taste and texture...Use REAL BUTTER. Use good quality peanut butter (I used Jif, Make sure you sugars and butters are creamed till light and fluffy and don't over mix when you stir in the flour. Hope it helps. Happy baking.

The dough was delicious!!! Although when I baked it, it was still doughy. It was in the oven for way over 12 minutes! (And yes my oven was working) I think if I ever make these again I will squish them down more and hopefully, they won't be extremely doughy/thick.

I am one of those people who felt like the recipe needed more flour. However, I just decided I didn't need to make the design and cooked them like normal cookies. They were light and airy. I wish they had a little more peanut butter flavor for myself. However, no cookie will be wasted and all eaten!

These were fantastic!  When I was through mixing the dry ingredients in the batter seemed a little bit loose so I added a bit more flour.  Perfect !  They rolled nicely. Light brown on the bottom and just enough brown on the crisscrosses on top and still soft in the center.  Yum!

Eh, its ok. They're not bad, just a little mild for peanut butter cookies. 

Not sure why the milks in there. But I like to try and make the first batch exactly as the recipe calls before moding. In my experience  excess liquids cause cookies to be very bread like. These are no exception, like peanut flavored biscuits lol. This is why i rated 2 stars.

I used Sunbutter natural. Accidentally added 2 eggs, so I used 2 T. Milk and added just under an extra 1/4 c flour. Baked about 8 mins.

I followed this recipe to exact measurements, and while the cookies turned out and aren't bad, they just don't suit my taste for Peanut Butter cookies. I like my Peanut Butter cookies to be somewhat thick and chewy, and these cookies are slightly crisp on the outside and very cakey, light and almost crumbly on the inside. The flavor is good. I won't be making it again.

Followed directions to a tee, while the cookie consistency is indeed soft and chewy, the flavor is chalky and lacks sweetness. Won't make this one again.

This is an okay recipe. Texture is great, flavor is okay, but leaves something to be desired in regards to an awesome peanut butter cookie. Still in search of a keeper, but that being said, I'm a picky peanut butter cookie girl (being my fav cookie) and I'm attempting to replace the lost recipes of my family.

This has a nice peanut butter flavor, but the directions needed some tweeking for me - it was WAY too sticky to roll into balls just after mixing it so I put it in the fridge for a while while I mixed up some different cookies.  Even then, it seemed very sticky.  I found that using a cookie dropper and then dividing that ball in half, gave me the size of cookie that I wanted and lessened the mess.  I also found that I needed to remove them from the cookie sheet IMMEDIATELY after removing them from the oven.  If I let them sit even for a few seconds, they started to adhere to the pan and made it really difficult to get them off in one piece.  They also aren't quite as soft as I was hoping for and crumble quite easily when being put away.  Not sure that I would make these again because of all the extra headaches but they do have a good flavor.

I thought that this is an okay recipe. It is more of a doughy cookie, more like pumpkin cookies. I like both my peanut butter cookie and molasses cookies to have a courser texture, which I suspect is due to the brown sugar and decreased amount of flour in the mixture. If I make this recipe again, I am going to cut back on the amount of flour.

Very good cookies.  I baked for 10 minutes and they were done perfect.  I got 34 cookies instead of 36 but that was fine.  I used my small cookie scoop for even distribution.  I did dip my fork in granulated sugar and criss-crossed the pressings.  Yummm.... hit the spot!

I used this recipe because the overall reviews looked good and I was down to the last 1 1/3 c flour and the recipes I saw for other PB cookies needed more flour. So disappointed, The batter was not moldable at all. The first batch in the oven just used a cookie scoop to size the cookies, the second batch i refrigerated to see if that would help me form the cookies - no :(. Although they had a good taste they didn't have the texture that I'd prefer.

I love soft cookies, but after 8 minutes these were a bit too "raw" for me.  So I baked the next batch a full 10 minutes and then hit them under the broiler to get the tops a little more golden.  I also sprinkled each cookie with a tiny bit of sugar before baking.  YUM!

I followed this recipe exactly as written although I doubled the recipe.  I dipped a moistened fork in sugar which made the crisscross easier---didn't stick to dough. Everyone who ate one loved them!

Pretty freaking good. My roommates thought they were super tasty. Definitely really chewy. The bake time wasn't quite long enough so I just kept an eye on them and left them in maybe 5 more min, but different ovens are different so that's no surprise. I did use half skippy and half this white chocolate peanut butter I had in the pantry. A little sweet, but that's probably the white chocolate pb I used. Fabulous texture and good pb flavor though! Plus they're super easy!

I LOVE this recipe. I will say first off that they are not your "traditional" peanut butter cookies. The dough is definitely more sticky, in fact it was so sticky for me that I couldn't roll it into balls so I just ended up dropping them by the teaspoonful and then flattening them a little bit. I baked on a Silpat mat at 375 for about 12 minutes. Everyone's oven is different, however, so what worked for me might not work for you. I used Peter Pan Honey Roasted crunchy PB and added a bag of Reese's PB chips. I found the flavor to be outstanding and very peanut buttery. The texture was soft, but not crumbly, and I loved the addition of the crunchy bits from the PB and the chips. I would recommend this recipe to anyone but would definitely tell them that these are not "traditional". In my opinion, they are far better.

Perfect! Made exactly as recipe stated, used my Kitchen Aid and baked 10 minutes on 350 on parchment lined sheets and cooled before touching! Didn't need to refrigerate dough. Great recipe!

The batter tasted good but they turned out terrible and burnt on the bottom.  I had no idea why then I re-checked the recipe and it indicated to bake them at 375.

These are the only peanut butter cookies my husband will eat now. If I try a different recipe, he will ask why don't they taste the same? I usually have to make myself a different desert because he can eat the entire batch in two days. Isn't that embarrassing. Oh well, that's what happens when you make the best!

Made for housewarming party. Was delicious and so simple to make. Used creamy Reese's PB. My oven was on 350 and they took about 20 minutes, just watch them. Some were crispy some soft. Dind't use milk.

Delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, except for two thing: One, the dough was so soft that I dropped spoonfuls of it directly into sugar and rolled the balls in that before pressing with fork tines. Two, I baked at 350 since my oven runs about 10-15 degrees hot, and hotter on the bottom.

I made these exactly as in the recipe but refrigerated the dough a little before making them. They were reasonably good but certainly not the best ever. There are other better recipes out there.

After trying this recipe I will not make peanut butter cookies any other way.  Rich in flavor, soft and melt in your mouth.  Everyone in my family fights over the last cookies.  Very simple to make and I can not rave enough about them!

I likes these cookies because I ran out if baking soda and I liked that these cookies didn't need any lol I added a few minutes extra cooking time for my gas oven and they came out beautiful and uniform. The dough is a bit thinner than what I'm used to for peanut butter cookies, but that's ok. They look and taste great to me! (The only reason I gave these a four star rating is because I save that for blow me out of the water recipes.)

Delicious and so peanut buttery! Remmeber not to overcook, as they will appear underdone but be perfect. For me it was 9 minutes. I think you could skip the milk or ut back to 1T.

This recipe needs more peanut butter (both for taste and chewiness) and more shortening. They are only good right out of the oven; once cooled, even though I put them in an airtight glass container, they harden way too much...not a desirable thing for peanut butter cookies!

It was simple and easy! My boys (husband and grandson) loved it! I did add 1/4 cup more flour as I like a thicker cookie, but the taste was great! we also added chocolate chips to half the batter for a little kick. YUMMY! excellent!

For peanut butter tast, the best ever so far!
I followed the recipe to a "T" except I added one more dollop of 
peanut butter as I made a triple batch and that is what I usually do!
I used unbleached King Arthur Flour, Cabot's of Vermont Butter, McCormick Pure Vanilla and the peanut butter was Jif Creamy. I also used 2/3 of 1% milk  1/3 half and half, instead of whole milk. That is what had on hand.
I made my cookies using a ice cream scoop so I would get a larger cookie. I leveled off the dough on the scoop.I baked them in my electric oven for 14 minutes and transferred to cooling racks immediately being careful as larger cookies can crack easier than smaller cookies. I made 20 cookies and then dcecided to mix the remainder of dough with semi sweet chocolate chips. I made 15 of those.
I have made several recipes for peanut butter cookies and this one is the best so far. I will shipping some and I will individually wrap them. I will ask my "cookie monsters" their opinion!
I already ate 2! LOL

I actually made this recipe a few times and it is really good! Simple ingredients, no shortening, no fuss. I even replaced the butter with a mix of apple sauce and oil and they still came out delicious! I keep this one handy and use it every time I miss a good PB cookie.

OMG it may be that I am pregnant and that's why these taste so good but I can't stop eating them! This will be the only time I make them while pregnant because I will definately gain weight if I make them too many times! I don't like overly sweet cookies and I am not a huge PB fan so that may change how you view these cookies. I think they had a great pb taste...definately there but not overpowering....thats with the extra pb I used because my husband loves PB. I used slightly more PB than called for...like an extra tablespoon...nothing crazy. Make these and try them for yourself....you will not be disappointed!

Loved these cookies! My kiddos devoured them. The dough is very soft to work with but I was able to roll them into balls with minimal trouble.

I added peanut butter chips to the recipe and my husband (a connoisseur of peanut butter cookies) declared these to be the BEST. EVER. I didn't change anything else to the recipe, and they came out just perfectly, with full peanut butter flavor and great texture. Love!

I have been searching for a recipe that satisfies my husband's PB cookie 'requirements' for YEARS.  I made this recipe this evening, and my husband has informed me that THIS is the one!  More of a PB taste than any other cookie, and a nice moist texture -- not grainy or crumbly.  Perfect! THANK you for ending my search!

I have used many peanut butter cookie recipes and this is the best. Moist, chewy, dough was perfect! I made some dipped in sugar, some in nuts, and some with a Hershey Kiss in the middle. All came out picture perfect.

These cookies rock - I read some of the reviews before making them and I was concerned, but they turned out perfectly.  It was the first time I made peanut butter cookies that were perfectly round, moist and chewy.  They were not dry at all.  The only addition I made to the recipe was to throw in some peanut butter chips that I had lying around for some extra crunch!

These were great! Very good Peanut butter taste. The only thing I didn't do is, use the milk. After other reviews about the dough not being easy to work with, I opted to leave it out. I dip my fork into water to stop it from sticking to make the marks.

Great flavor and a nice texture, but a little too soft for easy packing and travel. I followed the recipe as stated but substituted 1/4 t of b. soda for 1/4 t. of the b. powder to make them less cakey,  chilled the dough for 2-3 hours before baking, and coated the fork tines with powdered sugar before marking the cookies. I used natural peanut butter and unsalted butter. People who eat more salt might prefer to use salted butter or increase the salt. I think relatively lower salt might be what some people taste as "bland". Disclaimer: I was using a new oven and may not have waited long enough for it to preheat. If I make them again, I will set the temperature a few degrees higher and make sure it is completely preheated before putting in the first batch.

These are the best pb cookies I've ever made!  Mine turned out soft and chewy with a little crispness to the edges.  Great pb flavor.  So darn yummy.  I can't understand the negative reviews.  Doesn't make sense to me as mine turned out awesome!

I have never made peanut butter cookies and the only thing I did was add 1/4 cup more flour. (I also used self rising and left out baking powder and salt. Used crunchy Jif and they turned out awesome. Not bad for a first attempt.

These got a thumbs up from my family.  I made half the batch with chocolate chips and half without because we like chocolate but I wanted to try them without too since we were sending them with a care package to camp.   I used half creamy pb and half crunchy, next time I'll use all crunchy.  My only one small issue was the dough was really soft and difficult to roll.  They baked up just fine though.  Most of the ones with chocolate I did as drop cookies because of the soft dough.

This is a great peanut butter cookie recipe if you like soft peanut butter cookies.  I omitted the milk since the batter was soft enough without it and many reviews said the cookies were difficult to shape with the milk added.  I baked two batches, one at 375 degrees as the recipe indicated and that batch was too dark on the bottom.  The second batch I baked at 350 degrees and those baked up well.  You definitely have to leave these on the cookie sheets for 2 minutes to firm up after taking them out of the oven or they will fall apart.  I enjoyed these cookies because they have good peanut butter flavor and they are soft.

Great recipe; the milk makes the batter just workable enough to avoid dry cracked cookies when using natural peanut butter. Also I find dipping my fork in a little bit of milk between pressing the tines very helpful. At different times - I have substituted shortening for the butter; I have also used 1 cup brown sugar, instead of 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown; and they were really good cookies.

these were very good but really sticky batter and could not form into balls until i chilled it plus i think next time i will eliminate the 3 tablespoons of milk rather than add more flour.

My new favorite peanut butter cookie. I added some chocolate chips and used only brown suger.  Perfect texture, lots of peanut butter flavour and not too sweet.

Hi. My name is Sue. I am a busy mom with four kids. Three are my future step-kids and one biological daughter. My future hubby is a truck driver and loves bringing goodies on the road with him. I needed a good peanut butter cookie recipe, that both kids and hubby would like. I found it!! I will look no further. These are the best peanut butter cookies I have ever tasted or made! I used Skippy Creamy Peanut Butter both times I made these, and was very happy with the results. Everyone that ate these cookies loved them! DELICIOUS!! 5 STARS.

Definitely wouldn't use this recipe again. My oven keeps good temp and I had to crank it up 25 more degrees and increase baking time so these cookies would cook. They were pasty and fall apart even when cool. They are edible & you can taste the peanut butter, but they are very pasty. I think they need another egg or something to bind it together more. To sum it up, my husband who loves peanut butter cookies, won't eat them! :-(

These were delicious!  Soft and chewy.  I put most of them in the freeze and I think they might even be better now that I am taking them back out.  I will make again for sure next time I make pb cookies.

This peanut butter cookie recipe turned out very good.We made them small so they were bite size so you will need to tone down the oven from 375 to 350 and watch them very close..They did stay nice and soft which my father-in-law likes..Great job on this one:)

After baking for 10 minutes at 375 degrees, they didn't look ready.  So I let them go for 14 minutes.  They're really good.  Loved by all ages. Thanks Joey!

OMG, these are the best PB cookies I've ever tasted.  Don't change a thing, just watch carefully so as not to burn.  If you do, the bottoms scrape off nicely.  I was telling my daughter about this recipe and it turns out this is the one she has made all along.  Now I have to search to see if Joey has any other recipes!!

I have to say, this recipe is delicious. I used dark brown sugar in place of brown sugar and added 1/4 tsp more salt. I was able to form the balls very nicely and rolled them in white sugar and made criss cross pattern. I will use this recipe for peanut butter cookies again and again.

these were pretty good. might be a bit too much flour or not enough something else? not quite sure but i am still really happy with how they turned out. esp. how soft and chewy they are considering a lot of peanut butter cookies tend to be on the hard and crunchy side.

This is an excellent cookie!  They come out even better the next day.  I always store them in Tupperware.  I have also added toasted almond slivers to the top of them, as well as dipping/drizzling them with glaze.  Sometimes I will add a touch of honey to the batter as well...I love this recipe.  Most Peanut Butter cookies are dry and crumbly...These are soft and moist!  Thanks for posting!!

Delicious recipe - added butterscotch chips.  Yielded 26 cookies.  Topped with shredded coconut (helped with sticky dough before pressing with fork).

These were not the best peanut butter cookies I've ever made.  I couldn't find my recipe so thought I'd try these, and I was disappointed!  I didn't use the whole cup of peanut butter, but the dough was still extremely sticky and difficult to work with.  I really don't think adding a whole cup changes the flavor much, so I would cut down on the pb to make the dough more manageable.  The cooking temperature of 375 was a little too hot as well.  Wish I had just called my mother for the recipe I had lost instead of making these.

Best peanut butter cookies ever! I made them exactly the way the recipe said and they turned out perfect! Alot of people said they had issues with the consistancy of the dough. I didn't have any of these problems. I was able to roll them into balls and flatten them with a fork just like any other pb cookie. I really love how moist and flavorful they are, and as a bonus they have a little more protine due to the extra peanut butter. I could rave about these cookies all day long! Thank you Joey for my new fave cookie recipe!

These peanut butter cookies were super yummy. They are very soft and chewy and I topped mine with some Hershey's Hugs which made them even better.

I'm not normally easy to dis-satisfy, but these were quite tasteless.  Very bland flavor.  The peanut butter flavor was almost missing, and they weren't very sweet.  I am sorry to have to say that this cookie was a flop for me.  The only reason this cookie has so many high ratings is because the cookie that normally comes out crunchy for the average home baker actually stays soft and chewy at the expense of taste.

These were very good.  I try to keep things low sugar around here, so my 2 and 3 year old Daughters and I made them With Splenda Sugar for Baking and Splenda Brown Sugar instead.  Everyone LoVeD them.

They are good cookies.. My problem is that they ended up to chewy. Perhaps to much peanut butter! Excellent recipe though.

Its impossible to eat only one of these delectable cookies! Absolutely awesome recipe! The ONLY change i made was rolling my dough balls in white sugar before pressing down with a fork on the cookie sheet. They are a moist chewy and a perfect balance between salty sweet peanuty goodness.

I feel bad only giving this receipe 3 stars as it seems everyone else really LOVES these, but for me they were just okay.  It's a matter of personal taste I suppose; like the guy who said he likes super sweet cookies.  I'm the opposite, in fact I almost found these a bit too sweet.  I like PB cookies to have a more nutty/salty with a hint sweet flavor.    I made the recipe as written and although I liked the taste for the most part, I felt the texture was a bit too light.  I prefer a PB cookie to be dense and chewy.  Mine came out moist and chewy, but they were very light, almost cakey.    It could be an oven thing, but I also found that the bottoms seemed to bake much faster than the tops.  I tried moving the oven rack around, but finally ended up taking them out at about 9 minutes and then let them finish baking on the sheet for a few minutes and that seemed to give them an even crispness.  Bottom line:  For me they are tasty, peanut buttery and easy to make, but lack the density I personally prefer when it comes to a peanut butter cookie and are a little on the "too sweet' side.   Give them a try though, you might like them.

Love, love, love these cookies.  They are my husband's favorite.  I keep thinking that he has to be getting tired of the same old pb cookie, but it is still his top request when I make cookies (which is almost daily).  These will be almost gone by tomorrow, so I'll make a different kind then. Fantastic cookies!

These were REALLY good, despite what the guy who rated it terrible says.  I have ZERO cooking skills but needed to make something for a work pot-luck and these came out amazing.  They were soft and chewy and I also added choc chips because I'm a chocolate addict.  The entire bowl was gone with tongue marks on the bottom.

Just made these tonight. My boyfriend LOVES peanut butter cookies. Made them exactly as the recipes says. I baked them in my oven on the middle shelf for 8 minutes. Came out very chewy and soft in the inside and a litle crisp on the outside. THANK YOU!

These are good, I usually make flourless peanut butter cookies, and I was curious to see how these would turn out.  They are very good, I might stick to flourless though, I think they just taste richer.

I made these cookies exactly how the recipe calls for.  It was definitely too creamy to roll in a ball and put the fork on top, and I did not want to take the time to put in fridge just to put the stripes in the middle.  The only thing I did change was the temp. and cooking time.  I cooked them at 350 degrees for 10 minutes, and they came out perfectly soft.  Thanks so much for this recipe it is definitely a keeper.

These cookies were sooo creamy, soft and chewy. I only baked mine for 7 minutes, and they turned out perfect! (I think less than the recommended time seems to be the concensus among all the reviews) I definately will make these again! They were gone the same day I had made them!

OMG these were good, I prepared them just as the recipe called for and they came out great, I've eaten all kinds of peanut butter cookies over the years but these were some of the best.

Absolutely fantastic!  The only thing I changed was I added chocolate chips, and only baked for 6 minutes.  Perfect!

Ehhhh. I really wanted to like them. They were not terrible and I'm sure someone would eat them but I ended up throwing it away!!! Didn't care for the texture (crumbly as others mentioned) and they didn't rise or spread AT ALL.... in a bad way.  I'm no expert baker but I'm guessing due to using solely baking powder. I thought the chocolate chips I added would be enough acidity to activate it in the oven but it did not seem to be the case. The only reason I really chose to make this was b/c people said it was really peanut buttery and b/c I only had one stick of butter on hand--- and a lot of peanut butter.  This was a disappointment for sure. There has GOT TO BE a better recipe out there for peanut butter cookies!

This recipe was just alright. Nothing impressive. It was the flavor that didn't excite me, it was too bland. However the texture was okay. I used 1/2 cup cake flour and 3/4 cup all purpose flour to make the cookies puffier and melted the butter before adding it in in hope the cookie would be a bit more chewy. I baked them at 375 for 10 min and let them cool on the pan 2 min before transferring them to a cooling rack. When making peanut butter cookies again, I probably wouldn't go back to this recipe.

I thought these were really great.  They had a very nice flavor and were easy to make.  I used Peter Pan honey roasted peanut butter (it's what I had on hand), and they turned out very well.  My 2 year old ate 5 out of the 12 cookies from the first batch... So they definitely have his approval.  :-)

Perfect peanut butter cookie! Soft, lightly crispy around the edges and so very flavorful and nutty! I have been searching for a worthy pb cookie recipe for ages. This has satisfied my search and is now in my recipe book! Thanks

These cookies are so yummmmmmy!  I love this recipe because it's easy to remember & makes the amount of cookies it says it will. My thing for PBC is always use an excellent vanilla & a cheap peanut butter.

These turned out great! Ate them ALL! I put them in for 7 minutes like another reviewer said, and they were not done cooking. Since I'm at a higher altitude, I think I needed to cook them even longer than 10 minutes.

I read all of the reviews (including others that referenced Joey's recipe) while my daughter and I were looking for a great PB cookie recipe.  We decided on this one and we were NOT disappointed.  Perfectly peanut buttery - my only changes were to bake just a few minutes longer (probably because we made BIG cookies).  Otherwise, delicious!

I made these exactly as the recipe called. I don't think they are the "best" peanut butter cookies Ive ever made...however, they have great texture! I think they will be a hit for the "grandpas" in our family who often complain of the "too sweet" cookies and cakes. It had a very nutty flavor but not too much sweetness. If I were making these for the kids I would put a candy kiss in the center to help sweeten it up and I think it would be a perfect balance! I also liked that it did not have baking soda (because I was out at the time! lol)

I was looking for a quick and good peanut butter recipe (a cookie craving had just hit!) and I'm so glad this recipe popped up! I followed the instructions almost exactly and just added some chocolate chips into the batter. They are even better the next day and my roommates have already eaten most of them! Two cons: the batter is VERY greasy. Looking at it on the cookie sheet made me not want to even put them in the oven. The second is that the batter wasn't easy to make in a nice circle and the criss-cross pattern didn't hold up well either. Overall... a good solid cookie!!!

People that are loyal to Jif and Skippy should really try this recipe with Adams Peanut Butter.  Even if you only buy a small jar for this specific use.  Yeah you have to stir it but the amazing outcome will make you a believer!!!!!  I tried it with Skippy and then with Adams.  My house is now an Adam's peanut butter only! Don't be scared to refrigerate the dough. TRUST MY ADVICE

I was very disappointed with this recipe. It was way too chewy and the cookies crumbled when I took them out. I was looking for a good peanut butter recipe and this was not it. It was like eating raw cookie dough and very greasy.....will not recommend.

Very tasty and easy. The dough was a bit gooey which made it hard to roll into balls but not impossible. I over cooked my first batch by accident but they were still good! The second batch I squashed down a bit more and cooked for less time. Those were my favorite.

I was looking for a good peanut butter cookie recipe with simple ingredients and found it with this recipe. Very light peanut butter taste, moist and delicious. It seems to be off a bit, next time I will try to add a bit more baking powder and peanut butter.

These cookies are NOT sweet enough! I didn't read too many of the reviews before baking these. They aren't my favorite. They are VERY peanut buttery (which is what I was craving before making these-34 weeks pregnant!) but just not sweet enough for the boyfriend and I.

This was my 1st try at peanut butter cookies, and I'm glad I chose this recipe. It's not too heavy, has the perfect level of peanut butter taste, and stays fresh and soft for days. I used JIF extra crunchy peanut butter.

These tasted alright, definitely peanut buttery enough, but I had the same trouble with baking times as some other reviewers. The tops weren't browned at all, and were barely cooked, but the bottoms were close to being overly brown so I took them out. The texture is a little odd because of that. Maybe I made mine a little too thin and that's why they didn't turn out? I used half all-purpose flour and half whole wheat. I'll keep looking for a perfect peanut butter cookie recipe.

It had been a while since I`d made peanut butter cookies and found this recipe.  It`s good...even very good but I don`t think it`s the best pb cookie I`ve ever had.  I followed the recipe precisely and had no trouble forming them into balls; I found the dough to be fine to work with using a tablespoon measure.  The flavour of the peanut butter is not quite as pronounced as I would have liked and the texture is a tiny bit cumbly but nothing serious.  They are otherwise ight and fluffy, not dense.  I really enjoyed these a lot but would still look around for that ultimate pb cookie!!  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent recipe.  I made both the flourless peanut butter cookies and this recipe and I like this recipe better and my boyfriend liked the flourless.  These cookies turned out really soft and I like the added chocolate chip in the center.  I will be making these again very soon!

Very good recipe! I actually forgot to make the fork imprints as my dog was distracting me... when I look to see how the cookies were coming along, they were all cute and puffy, so I added 3 chocolate chips to the middle before they finished cooking.  My boyfriend liked the ones with the chocolate chips better than the ones with the imprints! Happy mistake!

I did not like the taste of these peanut butter cookies. These cookies are to bland, and to chewy.

I'm proud to tell my friends I baked these from scratch!  I've been experimenting with different peanut butter cookie recipes and this has got to be my favorite so far.  I added 1/4 cup more of flour and kept the rest exactly the same except for the peanut butter I used 1/2 cup creamy PB and 1/2 cup crunchy and they came out perfect.  They're slightly crispy on the outside and perfectly soft and chewy on the inside.  This is definately a recipe I'll use over and over again.

These turned out funky. I had to keep making adjustments because I didn't find the proportions to be accurate. I wasn't too thrilled with the overall experience but the friends that tasted the cookies weren't complaining.

I see that so many people followed the recipe, but came out with such different cookies!  I really didn't care for the taste at all, but the ingredients were simple and it was easy to make.  My dough was the greasiest stuff I have ever baked with!  I couldn't believe how wet my hands and the dough was.  It didn't really feel greasy though, I guess it was just wet.  Thank you though, it was an easy and inexpensive recipe.

I wrote a review previously, but it's not going to let me edit it.  When I made these last time I did add more peanut butter as per many other reviewers and did end up with a pasty tasting peanut butter cookie.  This time wanting those unconventional pasty, stick-to-the-roof-of-your-mouth cookies I made these again, except I followed the recipe exactly.  They tasted very much like alot of other pretty normal peanut butter cookies.  Don't change a thing and you won't be disappointed.

I have been hunting for a good Peanut Butter Cookie recipe for the last four months... This is by far the best! Everyone liked them. I didn't change one thing. The only change i plan on making in the future is Splenda/whole wheat pastry flour to make them a little bit healthier.

I gave a 4 star do to the fact they fall apart easy! I read someone else had the same problem. Maybe i will try to make them smaller and leave them on the pan to cool. Otherwise the taste is good. just not a cookie i could share with friends!

Wow, these totally fell apart, completely! I followed the recipe to the letter, and they just did not hold together at all. Tasted okay... but no better than the traditional recipe.  Update: I believe the key to these being successful would be that you'd have to allow them to cool on the pan for a long time before taking them off. Today the cookies have hardened quite nicely. The taste better today too.

Loved this recipe - thought the cookies were perfect! The only thing I changed was I cut down the salt and I used half cup creamy peanut butter, half cup crunchy peanut butter (just for personal preference).  Thanks for sharing this recipe - I will be making these cookies many more times!

I'm sorry for giving this only 3 stars, but the dough was way too runny to form into anything at all. I added 1/3 cup of quick oats, formed the dough into balls, then rolled them in gran. sugar.  They came out perfect and tasted fantastic, but only after I tweaked the recipe.

The cookies were good.  I had no problems with this recipe as other AR users have.  I used natural peanut butter.  When I did the criss-cross pattern, I dipped my spoon in powdered sugar before making the pattern on the cookie.

For anyone making this recipe with a lower quality peanut butter, it works just fine.  I did have to refrigerate it about an hour though because of the peanut oil used in the peanut butter.  I found if you put it in the oven for about 45 seconds and then remove it to make the criss crosses, it is so much easier.  I like bigger cookies, so I made 24 out of the batch rather than 36, so I needed to cook them 11 minutes rather than 10.  Came out great and the taste was as good as you can get with a lower quality peanut butter.

All in all this is a pretty good cookie.  As one reviewer stated earlier her cookies turned out a bit crumbly and thought this may be due to using natural peanut butter.  I also used natural peanut butter and although my cookies didn't turn out crumbly they were a bit overly soft.  Also, not as sweet as if I had used regular peanut butter but still very good and I actually enjoyed knowing there wasn't as much sugar in the cookies as there would have been had I bought regular PB.  I will definitely keep this recipe and tweak it just a bit to get them the consistency I like.

These are amazing! I replaced regular PB with DARK chocolate PB and they turned out so delightful! I also put them in teh fridge for an hour or two, and they were easier to work with(with hands). I didnt use the fork technique though...I also used more white sugar (2/3 white 1/3 brown)I want to turn this recipe with the WHITE chocolate!

WOW!  I added 1/2 cup peanut butter chips to this recipe.  I didn't bother rolling the batter into little balls.  Just spooned it onto the cookie sheets lined with parchment paper.  Batter is very moist.  350 degrees for about 13 minutes.  Watch to avoid burning.  Moist, chewy ~ exceptionally better than store bought or any restaurant.  Thanks for sharing!!

These were okay. The dough as written was so incredibly sticky/wet and impossible to work with. I had to add about another 1/2 cup flour. The result made the cookies too dry/powdery for me. Which was a shame because they are also very peanut-buttery, and had I not been forced to add more flour, they would have been perfect.

followed the recipe and turned out great! I prefer a crispy cookie with a chewy center, so after I baked and cooled the cookies I rebaked the cookies for an additional 10 minutes. I use an airbake pan to prevent burning the bottom of the cookies. great for camping cause it lasted 5 days and still tasted awesome.

This was not a peanut butter cookie I will make again. Pretty bland--not chewy--more cakelike. I searched on and agree with other rater--the Better Homes & Gardens peanut butter recipe was EXACTLY what I was looking for.

These cookies came out great!  I was a little unsure when I had the "dough" ready to put on the cookie sheet.  It is NOT like normal cookie dough but you really do NOT need to add more flour.  I used a rounded tablespoon scoop and just skipped the fork marks because really they are not necessary.  End result was great.  Just watch your bake time.  Mine were smaller cookies so 8 minutes was perfect.

I love this recipe! At first I thought the dough needed more flour but I tried it the way it was (and added chocolate chips) and they came out great. I was making them every week for awhile until I realized I was gaining weight. :) I also shared the recipe with my sister who just called and asked for it again so she could send it to her friend. We all love it, yummm!

These were not as peanut buttery as they claim.  I should have made a small batch first, but opted to make several dozen and over half went to waste!  I would not make them again.

This recipe is simply not good. The batter is much to sticky. Forget rolling it into balls, it's just not going to happen. The flavor is bland at best. The only ones that ate them greedily were my kids who simply don't know any better. I'll use a different recipe next time.

These peanut butter cookies turned out very well.  Be careful not to overbake them.  I added a about 1/4 extra peanut butter.  The result:  a very soft tender cookie.

Very good!  I am not a sweet tooth so these were made for my husband who is, and he really enjoyed them.  I followed the recipe to the t, then cooked as directed for 8 min. (on middle rack)then put them one rack up for ab. 2 and half min. They came out perfect crunchy on the outside and moist and chewy in the inside. Not too sweet and a perfect peanut butter flavoring! Not sure if it is the perfect peanut butter cookie, but it's really yummy!

Doubled to make more. Cooked as instructed and they turned out good. Nice PB flavor but not too sweet. I really liked this one over any others - I will be sure to add it to my collection and get rid of the others. Nice and crispy but moist on the inside.

They are good and very easy to bake. I did need to increase the bake time to 14 minutes. I don't know if this was because I was using parchment paper or not.

These are very good, but if you live in a high altitude like me (5280), you'll need extra flour. Maybe a tbls at a time or so until you get the right consistency, these were a little too loose without it.

Good.  I doubled the recipe.  I rolled them into balls sprinkled them with red sugar then put a Hershey Kiss on top of them after they baked.  Peanut butter and chocolate is a win win! One more thing...these freeze really well.  I wasn't sure with the kiss, but we just took some out of the freezer and they were great!  I always freeze cookies.

These cookies are the best. There was one viewer that rated this a one, that person must have been baking a different recipe, because this one is fabulous. One really helpful tip. After you cream together the sugar, peanut butter, butter, milk and egg, mix in the dry ingredients with a spatula or a wooden spoon. It won't come out liquidy.Hope that helps. Everything was right on the money.I will make this recipe for many years to come.Thanks

I love these cookies and so do my family. But I did change it a little bit because I did not flattened them and when they are cooked I put a rosebud on the top of each cookie. They are delicious either way.

These cookies came out great!  Although ovens and such are different, I cooked them at 350 for 12 minutes which seemed to work better than 375.  I also chilled my dough for two hours which seemed to have made a difference.  After the first hour of chilling the dough it seemed like it was still kind of wet and wouldn't firm up so I added about 1/2 cup flour and they came out perfect.  I was told today that they tasted like they were from the bakery!  YAY!  Thanks for the recipe!

Good cookie.  The dough was a little softer than I expected, and they ended up having to be treated more like a drop cookie, since I really could not roll them into balls.  Also, the flavor, while pleasant, did not have as strong a peanut butter flavor as I expected.

This recipe was super easy to make. Cookies tasted fantastic - a bit crispy on the outside, but moist on the inside. Way better than other dry peanut butter cookies. 

We added small chunks of Hershey candy bar on top for a peanut butter - chocolate flavor!

I'm not much of a peanut butter fan, but I wanted to try making a batch for a friend. They turned out very light... not heavy and dense like I imagined they'd be. A definite hit - I've had requests for more ever since!

I followed this recipe exactly, and the cookies turned out great!  This is an easy recipe containing basic ingredients which most everyone has in their cupboards. I did need to cook them for about 15 minutes, because when I took them out after 10 they were still a little runny.  Very delicious!

I thought these cookies were very good and my family loved them too. I used whole wheat flour instead of white and used crunchy peanut butter.ecipe was mixed in my kitchen aid and I added chocolate chips to half the batch. I personally prefered the plain ones but my kids loved the chocolate.They were delicious, especially with a glass of milk!

These were yummy, a little brittle though. I like my cookies more chewy! anyhow, they tasted good.

I agree with many, they did not have a strong PB taste or the sweetness I usually like but the texture was very good.
I ut some caramel cups in the middles of some before baking and they turned out good, the dough held them well.

This was disappointing. I kept to the recipe's measurements and cookie size, but they came out really small, thin, and burnt! I ended up turning my oven down to 350 and only let them cook for about 7 minutes. And then I tasted the few edible ones I had, and there was not a lot of flavor. I used Kroger brand peanut butter, so maybe a better brand would have more flavor. They were also really greasy. They weren't horrible tasting, but not comparable to my dad's (whose recipe I didn't have with me).

Cookies were great!  Ate them with ice cream right out of the oven when the middle was still soft but the edges were nice and crispy. Yummmmmm.

I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could.  It's a good cookie, the dough is easy to handle, and the recipe actually makes more cookies than indicated by the yield.  The only negative is there's not quite as much peanut butter flavor as I'd like, and if you wait for the edges to brown, the cookie is over cooked.

I followed this recipe entirely as posted. I found it to be a little greasier and more crumbly than what I was looking for, but it tasted great. Everyone who tried the cookies said they were very yummy. Next time I may try another recipe or use less butter. Letting the cookies rest on the sheet and using parchment paper helped the cookies keep their perfect shape. 

Update- These cookies were MUCH better after they rested a day or two. We wolfed them down then. :)

There isn't a very strong peanut flavor but they are very tasty with a nice texture, soft inside and slightly crispy outside.  I found the batter to be very wet when I followed the recipe so I added extra flour.

These cookies were good, but not the classic Peanut Butter Cookie I'm used to. They were much softer, and I think that because they were so soft, you couldn't taste a lot of peanut butter. I later made ones from another recipe that made them a little crunchier/chewier and those tasted more peanut butter-y.

Overall though, these were good

My husband LOVED these!  Mine came out a little on the crunchy side (I know, it's all about the baking time) but personally I prefer chewy peanutbutter cookies.  And for some reason I keep expecting more of a peanut-buttery taste, but I can't figure out what I'm lacking!  Anyway, I rate this one 4 stars :)

My first time to try this recipe.  I made this recipe exactly as called for except I used margarine instead of 100% butter (I ran out).  The texture turned out fine and they taste like... SURPRISE! peanut butter cookies.  I can say these weren't my favorite cookies in the whole world.  My kids like them and that's what counts, right?

Mmmmmmm!  So delicious!  I followed the directions exactly (except for baking time and temp -- that always varies with my bizarre oven).  I was a little nervous at how difficult they were to shape into balls at first, but they came out perfectly soft, fluffy, and delicious!  Thanks so much!

These turned out a little blah for my taste. They're aren't quite as crunchy and chewy as some peanut butter cookies I've baked.  Flavorwise, they're not great either.

These cookies were great!  A few reviewers said the batter was a bit too thin, I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was the perfect consistency.  It was nice and thick for me.  I used a 2 ounce cookie scoop and maybe I should have used a 1 ounce because they didn't spread much and I was nervous that the middle wasn't done, but they came out fine. I think next time I will use a smaller scoop.  I will definitely make these again.

Recipe was excellent. Here are some tips. As mentioned by an earlier review, refrigerate dough. Roll dough balls into sugar if desired. Last, let cookies cool completely before removing from cookie sheet. Enough said, this recipe got my attention.

Very soft, actually almost too soft in the middle. The larger the cookie, the softer the middle is, and the more the edges break away from the middle. I will make these again!

Good cookies but a bit on the dry side, kind of a soft/crumbly texture.  I doubt any will go to waste but I'll keep looking for one that suits us.

Really good!  I used natural peanut butter and it was a bit dry so I added a little extra oil to soften it up a bit and make it more creamy.  I will definitely make these again.  I also added some extra sugar because of using natural PB.

GREAT cookie recipe!!  I served these to a group of my husband's friends....several big, hungry men and they went over fantastically.  They all said they were the best pb cookies they've ever had.  Thank you for this amazing recipe!  You made me a winner with the guys!

This was the best Peanut Butter Cookies ever! I don't know how you could end up with runny batter or crumbly cookies... maybe read the recipe more closely. And someone already reviewed and wrote about how she sprinkled sugar on top before she baked them, this was a GREAT idea, and it made the cookies taste really good. I will for sure use this recipe again!

I overcooked these.  :(  However, the flavor was very good and they were simple to make.  I'll have to try again.

i wasn't really impressed with these...and neither was anyone else who ate them at my house. i used natural pb so maybe it was because of that the flavor wasn't great.

I hate peanut butter cookies. I hate the dry and sandy texture of traditionally made ones. But my boyfriend requested these so I decided to try this recipe out. Turns out, I do like peanut butter cookies, when they're made like this. lol This recipe was really easy. I don't understand why it hasn't turned out for others. I didn't have butter so I used margarine which made the cookies flat but the texture was exactly how I like my cookies, slightly crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle, the taste is really good too. I don't understand why people say these aren't peanut buttery enough, b/c they are. I rolled them the size of walnuts and rolled them in sugar since sugar really does bring out the flavor of peanut butter and I ended up with 3 1/2 dozen. I also baked only one sheet at a time on the upper middle rack in the oven at the suggested time for 8 minutes. They came out perfect. If u do use margarine, don't bother pressing any designs into the cookies because once they're baked, they flatten out so much you can't see them.

Add some chocolate chips to this cookie and it make a nice twist on an old favorite. I agree with some of the other reviewers that this recipe doesn't produce a very peanut buttery flavor. I probably would not use this recipe as my main peanut butter cookie recipe, but it works well as a peanut butter chocolate chip cookie recipe.

AWESOME!  I did exactly as the recipe stated and I baked for 8 min. and these came out delicious!  Even the next day (in which I had in a zip lock bag--I tend to bake 6 cookies only at a time..that way dough is made up for anytime we'd like a couple of cookies.  Needless to say, they were still chewy and great.  They did 'not' crumble nor did they turn 'hard' as most folks have stated.  GREAT RECIPE!

Texture's good, flavor's GREAT, but they totally crumble. I'd put only one cross hatch in them. Also, I added 1/3 cup of flour because I thought it looked way too runny. Over all, though, pretty gosh darn good.

Melt in your mouth cookies! The best I've had. They're very soft, actually cake like. I use only all natural peanut butter so I don't know if that makes a difference. It's a very runny peanut butter, you can actually pour it. But they turned out great! The dough was so soft and fluffy, very airy and not greasy at all (again, maybe that's the all natural peanut butter?). I love to eat lots of cookie dough whenever I make any cookies and this dough passes that test big time. I couldn't make the fork criss cross marks, so I just didn't do those. In my oven it took just 7 1/2 minutes of baking, but I got 45 cookies out of it so maybe mine were a little smaller? Basically you just have to watch for light browning of the very edges and that's when they're done (as with any peanut butter cookie). These were awesome still warm and even better the next day! You just can't go wrong! Except my husband prefers a "crunchy on the outside and chewy in the middle" cookie, so he's not eating them. Oh well, more for the kids and me!!!!

A great five star peanut butter cookie recipe..they were delicious....I keep seeing my brother sneak more cookies. I follow the recipe to a "T" and use a whole jar of peanut butter instead of trying to measure it out.

These are great peanut butter cookies (and beautiful). The dough comes out looking like it is going to be too soft to handle, but trust the recipe, it works fine. I think I'll try natural peanut butter next time for a richer peanut butter taste and less sweet outcome. This recipe is going in my favorites list.

Tried to make these cookies for Fathers day, as they are my Dad's favorite.. and I'm having a very hard time with them.  It seems that if I follow the directions they come out horribly under cooked, but if I cook for more time they are very very dry (Although still soft)... very crumbly every time I try to move them from the baking sheet to the cooling rack.  Not sure whats going on with them.   They do taste delicious, though.

I just made these cookies for Father's Day. You will want to double the recipe! They are so yummy!! Watch the cooking time. Also, if you dip the fork in flour before making the cross mark it adds a bit of richness to the cookie. Highly recommend this recipe.

I made these yesterday with my children (ages 4 & 5) they did most of the work. I just mostly did the reading. They came out perfect and are still moist today. My husband loved them! The only thing was that I found the batter to be a little too wet so we added a tablespoon of flour until a better consistancy.

They taste like the cookies you break off and bake- but they were a little on the thin side.

These just turned out awesome. The batter was just right for making into the balls. I used creamy Skippy peanut butter. I cooked them in my convection oven at 350 for 10 minutes. Let then sit for about 2 minutes on the sheets, then removed to wire racks. Came out perfect!!

This recipe is a keeper.  I followed it exactly and used Trader Joe's roasted and salted peanut butter (which I think has a more peanuty flavor than other brands) and they came out perfectly.  Very, very peanut buttery and not too sweet which is exactly what I was looking for.  Thank you!

Just as amazing as everyone said. You should definitely try these. I had to cook them on the longer side and then let them cool for a while so that they didn't break. I also used Peter Pan honey roast peanut butter and that gave it an extra sweetness that was fantastic. Maybe I'll experiment with adding honey next time if I only have regular peanut butter.

These were pretty good.  I rolled them in sugar and then criss-crossed them.  I put chocolate chips in half the dough.

i lost my old trusty recipe for peanut butter cookies and this just happened to be the only good reviewed Plain and Simple recipe for them. I added some chocolate chip for fun and they came out awesome! its strange but my dough didnt come out runny or oily at all, perhaps because i used peter pan brand p.b.[not as oily as others maybe?] and half the milk. thanks!

Quick; easy; very tasty as a peanut butter cookie should be. I made large cookies and it took about 15 minutes to cook, they turned out nice and chewy.

I read the other reviews regarding the texture of the dough, but I had no problems the dough. The dough look like all the other cookie dough I've made in the past. The cookie was perfect, even the 1/2 doz that I over cooked. 
THIS RECIPE IS A KEEPER :)

I made this recipe exactly like it said but the dough was too sticky and wet to put on the cookie sheet.  I added some extra flour to thicken it up a little and they came out perfectly!  the extra flour didn't change the taste at all!  the cookies were chewy and moist exactly how peanut butter cookies should be!  oh yeah, 10 minutes didn't quite do the job...they were nowhere near done!  i cooked them at the same temp for about 12 minutes and they came out great!!

This recipe was great! I ran out of butter so I ended up using 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening and hoped it would not ruin them, and it didnt! These are by far the best peanut butter cookies I have ever had! They were supposed to be for my husband, but seeing that I am pregnant and I love them so much, he is out of luck. I will be making more this weekend. Great job on the recipe! LOVE IT!!!

Okay, I am adding more to my previous rating because I saw that this recipe got some low marks. Someone said they run a deli and bakery and that these cookies were bad. You are crazy!!! These cookies are great! What more do you want? I have used many peanut butter cookies and this one is where I stopped my search for my ultimate recipe. I love this recipe! =)

The dough was very sticky, so much that I had to spray the fork every time I pressed the cookies. I followed another person's advice and put the cookies on the top rack of the oven but they still came out burned on the bottom, don't know if that's the fault of the recipe, the oven, or the pan. I usually like crisper cookies and these turned out a little too soft for my taste, but as some people prefer soft cookies, it's still a good recipe. I probably won't try it again though.

These are good peanut butter cookies, however I needed to tweak the recipe in order to make them turn out right.  I needed to add extra flour because the batter was VERY runny (after measuring everything *perfectly*) I also added some peanut butter chips for extra flavour.  The cookies came out fine, not dry, which is always good.  I would probably try the recipe again.

We loved these cookies.  They were very soft in the middle - just how we like them.  My family couldn't get enough of them - I'll be sure to double the recipe next time.

This is exactly what I was looking for - soft, chewy, and delicious! I used Splenda instead of white sugar, whole wheat flour in place of the white flour, and I added two packets of maple & brown sugar Quaker Instant Oatmeal to the dough. That was a great addition! The flavor was enhanced and it also added a little texture.

these were pretty good, made a chewy cookie.  I have another that I think I like a bit more, but only because it makes a crispier cookie.  I doubled to send in care packages to college students, I think they will love them :)

This was a great recipe!  I subbed the wheat flour for spelt and the white sugar for organic cane sugar, used rice milk instead of regular milk and crunchy natural peanut butter.  The only thing I noticed is that the batter was really runny so I added a bit of extra flour.  They were a hit!  Thanks!

Everyone loved them except for that they tore quite easily, even after cooling for a couple of hours.
I like my cookies whole, not in pieces.

I'm going to rename the recipe "Sorry Mom Peanut Butter Cookies". They are so much better than Mom's recipe that I've used for 40 years. Unlike many reviewers my husband and I think they have a great peanut flavor.

These made more of a 'cakey' cookie.  They were delicious, no doubt, but I was looking for something more 'crumbly'.  When I'm in the mood for a softer cookie I will make these again though.  Also, the dough is sort of soft so I would definitely refrigerate this for a couple hours before attempting to roll into balls and bake.

I chose this recipe because of the high rating but I found it to be only just "ok". The cookies were a little bland, not very peanut buttery, even after adding reese's pieces. Ok but not the best.

I used Brummel & Brown low fat butter and changed nothing else.  The cookies are AWESOME!  They are soft, chewy, and have a great peanut butter flavor.  For the first time ever, not one of my cookies burned.  Thank you.  I will make again.

These are good cookies. I used 1/4c of whole wheat flour in place of white because I ran out. The peanut butter was Kraft "Natural" Peanut Butter; I made the cookies to get rid of it because the kids didn't like it. They do like the cookies. I do wish they had more nutty flavour. I think I would kick them up next time with some chocolate or peanut butter chips as others suggested. The method worked fine for me, but I did bake them at 350 for 9 minutes and let cool before removing from the pan.

A fabulous cookie! Most peanut butter cookies are crumbly but this one is soft and moist(think peanut butter fudge) I used freshly ground whole wheat flour and then chilled the dough prior to cooking and the results were outstanding. This is my new go to peanut butter cookie recipe!

The first batch I made came out a little crispy on the bottom when in for exactly 8 minutes.  The second batch didn't seem done in the middle when in for 7.  These weren't what I was expecting, but they weren't bad.  I'm giving 4 stars.

I'm addicted to these, they were really easy to make, the only thing i would do different is the time wasn't right for my oven so watch, they weren't fully done with the 8 mins. but def 5*'s hands down!

These cookies are FABULOUS!  Rolled in sugar first then pressed with fork.  Baked at 350 for 8 mins on top rack.  These are perfect, no lie!

Very, very good.  I wish they had been a bit more chewy.  I'm at a high altitude, though, so that may have made a difference.  Very good cookie!

Perfecto! Loved them! My 15 year old daughter made these and they were awesome! My oven is a bit wacky so we started checking them at 5 minutes and found that they were best pulled out at seven minutes and cooked on the top rack.

These cookies were pretty good.  The bottoms burned easily in my oven, so I moved them to the top shelf and turned to heat down a little.  Not my favorite peanut butter recipe, but they were worth making once.

This is an awesome recipe for peanut butter cookies. I followed the recipe exactly, except I added some milk chocolate chips to half the batch. The batter does look a little runny, but after you add the flour, it's firm enough to roll into balls. OH YEAH, only leave the cookies in the oven for about 8 minutes, then take them out and let them rest on the sheet for a few minutes before you take them off to cool them. They may not look all the way done, but trust me, they will be! If you bake them any longer (like I did with the first two batches I baked) they come out a little hard and dry (but still good with a glass of milk!)

These cookies are just right! They are fluffy, yet crisp, not too sweet, and nutty. I've used many peanut butter cookie recipes, but this is the one that I like the best.

This was just the recipe i was looking for these are the best peanut butter cookies ever! I highly recommend this recipe! My mom and i were at this hotel, and they had peanut butter cookies she loved. Then after we left the hotel she couldn't find any that were that great so i decided that since i recently took up cooking i would try to find a recipe, so i did and while she was taking a nap i made these for her and she had some.  She said they were just like the ones at the hotel she loved them!!!!! Thanx for this recipe Joey!!!

this is my first time baking peanut butter cookies.
few things to take note,
first, it is way too greasy in my opinion.
and too much peanut butter i think?
but nonetheless, its a great recipe, though i'll make some changes and add more vanilla extract.

I baked a batch of these yesterday and although they were good, I didn't find them extraordinary.  No cookie goes uneaten by my hubby and I so I will give them 5 stars although I wish there was a 4¾ catagory.  I also found that the recipe gave a yield of 48 but I only got 39 cookies of medium size.

My dad liked them- so I'll assume they're good. My only complaint is that mine cracked at the edges... perhaps its b/c I followed another reviewers advice on omitting the milk, so it was a bit dryer than it should have been...? The flavour itself is a little strange after awhile though.

Yummmy!!!! We made this recipe for the kids, and they loved these cookies. The cookies are very peanutty and melt in your mouth. Noone even noticed that I used reduced fat peanut butter, sugar substitute and low fat milk. :) This recipe will definitly replace my old peanut butter cookie recipe. Thank you Joey for the recipe, and thanks to your girlfriend for posting it!

Made these cookies today for a staff birthday tomorrow. Very good flavor and easy to make. They are not the "best" PB cookie I have eaten, but they are very good and I would definitely make them again due to ease of recipe, etc. I cooked mine on cookie stones and had to cook for a bit longer (11 minutes).

soooo good. Made them as a father's day gift and he LOVED them.  I was scared when I saw how wet the dough was, but they turned out WONDERFUL, can't say enough about them.  thanks for the submission!

Great cookies.  Didn't have to change a thing.  I did find that by putting the dough in the freezer for about 20 minutes it was much easier to work with.

Delicious, delicious.  The best peanut butter cookie —if not the best overall cookie—I've ever hard. Hardy peanut butter flavor, yet nice and chewy and soft.  I also must rejoice in the fact that there was barely any dough residue on my hands after I'd rolled it into balls.  The only changes I made were natural peanut butter, soymilk, maragine, and Ener-G egg replacer.  Delicious.

If you like crispy cookies, this is not your cookie! I love the soft texture of this cookie, it's amazing! I made a batch today, and they are going so quickly that I had to hide them from my kids!

I have searched and searched and tried many Peanut Butter cookie recipes, looking for the one that is both tasty and soft. This was one that I was able to make that even my picky husband loved! Definitely a mainstay.

As far as traditional Peanut Butter Cookies go, this is a perfect recipe.  The quick & easy recipe produced soft and delicious cookies that melt in  your mouth.  This version of PB Cookies is now the recipe I will return to for dependable results.

These are very yummy cookies. I followed the directions exactly for half of the batch and they were good. With the other half of the dough I made peanut butter kisses. After rolling the dough in balls, I rolled the balls in granulated sugar and baked until the edges were medium brown, then immediatly after I took them out of the oven I put a hershey kiss in the center.... YUMMY!! These were so much better than the first batch! I used a light cookie sheet on the middle rack which resulted in cookies that were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.

"They were fabulous!"  I used more peanut butter than called for and for the second batch added chopped Reece's Peanut Butter Cups.  They were really soft and kind of fell apart, but they also melted in your mouth.

I thought these were pretty good cookies. My three year old son loved them. We put sugar sprinkles on them. I did not have milk on hand so I used vanilla soy milk and they turned out just fine.

These were good...perfect consistency and baked really well. They were a litte poofy, but I liked it. I will use this again, but I think I  will add just a bit more PB - it didn't have quite enough. I hope that does the trick. Thanks for the recipe!

Unfortunately, these cookies, for me at least, were just not good at all.  They turned out dry and almost tasteless.  I followed recipe and cooking times exactly.  Wish I could say they were great like so many other cooks have, but I just can not.

WOW!!! I am ashamed to admit that it took me so long to locate this wonderful recipe. I have tried several, all in an effort to find one close to the peanut butter cookies of my youth. None ever cut it! This, however, was absolutely perfect! Directions were easy to follow and the recommendations of fellow reviewers (adding a little extra flour), made baking these cookies a cinch! Great recipe!!!!!

This cookie packs some good flavor, however it lacks in appearance.  This cookie is one ot the flattest cookies that I have seen.  I will continue my search for a, equally great tasting, but fuller cookie.  Thanks!

I've made many varieties of peanut butter cookies before.  By far, this is THE BEST one.  I tend to tweak recipes a bit, but this recipe didn't need any tweaking - it was perfect as was.  For a chocolate flavor sensation twist - I melted some milk chocolate and put spoonfuls of it on wax paper, then gently settled each (cooled) cookie on top, twisting the cookie until the chocolate had coated the bottom, then left them alone for the chocolate to harden up.  My husband took the cookies to work - and came home full of raves on how they tasted like Pepperidge Farm cookies.

Spectacular recipe!!!!!!!!!!!

These were the best peanut butter cookies I have made! I only put 1 tblsp of milk and I rolled the cookies in sugar before criss crossing them with the fork tines. 7 minutes was the perfect time in the oven to keep them nice and chewy. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made these cookies (along with Award Winning Soft Chocolate Chip Cookies) for our church coffee hour and not a single crumb was left!  These cookies went especially fast.  To quote our minister, "These peanut butter cookies rule!"

Made these for my son's school.  I never tried them and honestly I don't care for peanut butter cookies but my son asked for a peanut butter cookie.  He said that everyone liked them including his teacher.  He had none to bring home as they were all gone!!!!  I take that as a compliment!!!

The flavor was super yummy, however I tried to take them to a luncheon and they all fell apart--I was so embarrassed when the box was opened and it was all crumbs.  Maybe next time I will bake them a little longer so they aren't quite as soft.

i'm not a fan of peanut butter, but my my my... these are soft and delicious.  i used crunchy peanut butter and added some choco chips to some balls and left the rest plain.  i prefer the ones without choco chips because they tasted so much better.

the cookie dough was a little too "light" to form into balls without gradually adding  more flour. the cookies are in the oven as i write this review and they  smell  delicious!hopefully the taste is as well

These are an absolute favorite around here! I like to add chocolate chips as well and roll them in a bit of sugar before pressing them onto the cookie sheet. Fabulous recipe! Moist with lots of peanut flavor!

After I lost the pb cookie recipe I used to make 'em for Annie for her birthday every year, I had to find a replacement. This one was even better, and she adores them! Nice and chewy when fresh, and nice and crunchy when cooled.

Came out perfect!  Will make these very often.  Thanks!

These are very good basic peanut butter cookies and have been one of my cookie staples for months. The review isn't five stars because these cookies aren't noticeably better than any other peanut butter cookies --- don't get me wrong; they're still very good. If you like these, try the Oatmeal Peanut Butter Cookies from this site.

The flavour of this cookie was perfect.  I did add a pinch of cinamon as suggested.  I also cooked on 350 instead of 375 and made bigger cookies.  I added about a cup of chocolate chips and lessened the sugar slightly - delicious.It's hard to tell when they are done b/c the tops don't brown like you'd expect.  The only reason they didn't make my 5 star rating is b/c I found they cracked - maybe I didn't cook them enough?  Any advice would be appreciated.  Anyway, they were delicious and stayed soft for days after.  YUM!

I'm only giving this 4 stars because the dough is waaay too soft to even consider trying to roll it into balls.  I just used two teaspoons like I do with any other drop cookie, dipped my fork in water, and ended up with delicious cookies!! Nice and peanut-buttery, and easy to make.  Thanks!
Update 12/30/08 - If you are using unsweetened PB, as I did this time, you might want to up the amount of sugar a bit.  I also used all brown sugar and no white, with no really discernible difference to the end result.   Also: I don't know how ANYBODY can say these don't have a good peanut butter flavor.  The ratio of PB to butter to flour is very high, so if the PB flavor isn't shining through, I think I'd blame the PB and NOT the recipe.  Thanks again!

Very good as is.  We also liked them with a caramel chocolate kiss, or mini snickers bar pressed in just after removing from the oven.  We'll be making these again.

These cookies were awesome!  I usually don't care for PB cookies, but I made these because they were easy and I had all of the ingredients.  I couldn't stop eating them!  The day after I made them my husband made me take them to work so he would stop eating so many.  Great recipe!

These cookies were very nice looking, but they tasted just like regular old peanut butter cookies.They were neither moist nor chewy. I also used natural peanut butter, but they still cooked in 8-10 minutes. I will probably not make these again.

Pretty darn good, moist and chewy.  I used a natural peanut butter which tends to be kind of oily.  This meant that I had to increase the cooking time to 20 mins.  Fortunately, this didn't compromise any other aspect of the cookies, such as the bottoms burning.  
I really like this recipe because it doesn't use shortening.  Yum.

This is a good recipe however if you are choosing to make these cookies you should use more peanut butter.  I baked according to the exact recipe and there wasn't too much of a peanut butter taste.

This recipe is amazing! So easy and the cookies are the perfect level of gooey!
I had almost all the dough on the cookie sheets when I realized I had forgotten the butter - so I threw it all back in the bowl, added the butter, and the cookies still came out perfect!

These cookies reminded me so much of the wonderful peanut butter cookies I had served with school lunches.  I loved them.  I have been searching for a recipe like those school cookies since I graduated High School and that was 25 years ago!!!  Thanks so much for sharing.  These are the closest I have found.

These were the best peanut butter cookies I've ever had.  They were so easy to make.  I had all the ingredients I needed on hand.  They didn't take long at all.  My husband even said they were 'real good'.  Fresh out of the oven with a glass of milk...brought back childhood comforts.

These were really good, but I have had better peanut butter cookies. Actually I have made better ones myself. They arent real sweet to me, they have a good taste, but not as buttery as the recipe states. I am going to keep looking, myself. For the perfect recipe.

This is not my favorite recipe. The dough is sticky and difficult to work with and has a very pasty taste. They are ok, but not great.

These are very good and super easy to make. Just like the peanut butter cookies I had as a child.  I added a few choclate chips to the top of some of the cookies for a little chocolate treat.

I baked these cookies to give to my boyfriend for valentines day, he loved them. I lost half the batch to my family too. Instead of peanut butter I used Crunchy PB. Either way, these are the way to go: good flavor, and chewy, even after a few days of sitting in a box. Real easy recipe to make, but don't be afraid to flatten them out A LOT. I WILL be making these again. Thanx :)

I thought the cookies were a bit crumbly.  I had to bake them for 15 minutes on my air bake sheets. VERY soft and yummy, though. Good recipe.

I work with children and I baked these for one of our groups of 12-14 year old boys.  I didn't think they were peanut buttery enough, but they were gone within a couple of minutes.  They all gave this recipe a five star rating.  Now everyday at work all I hear about is when will you make pb cookies again!  Thanks for the recipe it was a big hit!

They turned out remarkable.  I made it for some children that I work with and in the end, my colleagues got to them before the kids had a chance! Will definitely make another batch soon.  One of my colleagues told me that she usually does not eat peanut butter products, but after a taste of these cookies, she thought they were the best things in the world!

TOTALLY AWESOME!  I've never had a better peanut butter cookie....I haven't ever had a better cookie PERIOD.  The slice of bread in the cookie jar really does keep them fresh longer.  I will make a triple batch and replace the bread a couple of times and they just keep getting softer and softer. WONDERFUL!

I was looking for a cookie that was both firm and chewy but not crumbly or dry...I have found an excellent recipe! I used slightly less than the 1/2 cup of margarine (almost 1 1/2 tbsp less) but made up the difference with slightly more peanut butter and they were awesome...

Very good chewy on the inside, crispy on the outside cookie that is super fast and easy to make!  Great flavor, and they spread just nicely.  I chilled my dough about 30 min. before rolling in tsp. size balls. YUM!  Will make many times I'm sure!

Flavor was good, but it seemed that they took a REALLY long time to bake. The suggested baking time was not NEARLY long enough! Otherwise, they taste really nice!

This is the best recipe I have ever tried.  They did turn out really peanut buttery and had a really creamy smooth middle that I thought was delicious.  I baked a batch up and took them to work with me for a co-worker's birthday party.  Everyone loved them and my family loved them as well.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I cook a lot of cookies for my department for different pot lucks. Peanut butter cookies are my favorite because they taste good and are cheap and easy to make.  I tried this recipe after trying numerous others and I must say this is the best recipe I've seen.  I now receive requests for this cookie more than any other I make...great recipe.

Though I liked the fact that you don't have to chill these cookies before baking, I didn't really like the end result. The cookies weren't very sweet and left a bitter aftertaste in my mouth.

My husband asked me for some pb cookies that were soft on the inside and crispy on the outside and after reading the reviews I made a double batch of these - rolling the balls in sugar- and my husband declared them perfect and ate a dozen fresh out of the oven!!  Will make again, Thanks!

Not a chewy cookie like Mrs. Fields.  It is a melt in your mouth cookie with buttery flavor.  Quick and painless but do not substitute butter wtih margarine they turn out hard.....I had to through that batch away.

I've nothing to add that's new, so shall simply echo the sentiments... VERY peanut buttery and delicious!!  I chilled the dough for several hours as I was going out, then rolled it into balls and baked the cookies later in the day.  They came out perfectly.  Thanks!!

These are, without a doubt, the best peanut butter cookies I have ever had. They have a really chewy texture.  The flavor reminded my husband and I of Reeses Pieces.  I had been looking for a good recipe with this knid of texture and the flavour was a definite bonus.  I used Kraft light peanut butter and they still turned out perfectly.  They freeze really well too.

Very peanut buttery and soft w/ a chewy middle. Dip the fork in water when making cross marks on top of the cookies. DH ate quite a few of these and that must mean the were delicious b/c he hates peanut butter!

I love these cookies! I made them a while back but I never reviewed the recipe for some reason... The cookies turn out soft and chewy (and stay that way days later). Very very good, I've never tried another recipe, this one was great.

I only had lower fat peanut butter around the house, so I tried making these cookies with that...I think this might of been a mistake.  They turned out ok but stick to the real stuff.

It certainly had a lot of peanut flavor, but the cookie was too dry for my tastes. I like a slightly chewy peanut butter cookie.

Absolutely fantabulous!  Easy to make with a delicious outcome.  I used 1/4 cup more flour than the recipe called for, and then covered the bowl and refrigerated the dough for 1 hour.  The dough was not "sticky" and was very easy to work with.  Thank you, girlfriend of P.L.Weiss for this excellent recipe.    GordonGoodGuy-age 73

These were the most AWESOME tasting peanut butter cookies I've ever had.  I like the chewy-er style, verses the usual dry crumbly cookie.  The flavour was REALLY OUTSTANDING!  Very easy to make, my 6, 5, and 3 year old made them with a little help from me!  They were gone by that evening.  They did kind of fall apart, and maybe a touch more flour would've helped, but I kinda liked them that way ;-)
Thanks for this EXCELLENT recipe!

The dough was easy to work, the taste amazing, and the kids liked them... but they crumbled into little pieces the next day.  I don't see anyone else saying that so maybe I did something wrong?  The flavor makes it all worth it, they just didn't hold up well for serving.

These cookies were very good.  I served them at a Christmas party and everyone loved them.  I didn't really have any of the problems with the batter, as I read in other reviews, other than the fact it was ever so slightly crumbly, but not enough to bother me.  They taste good and the only recommendation I would make would be to put some sugar on the top before baking, as I think that is what makes a peanut butter cookie.  This one will go in my permanent file.

Very good taste but extremely stickly even though I refrigerated 3 hours before baking.  I'll use this recipe again but will increase the flour to 1 3/4 to 2 cups so that they can be rolled into balls.  Very tasty.

great peanut butter cookie!  Too sticky, so refrigerated for an hour before rolling it, worked fine.  Very easy.

Very good cookies.  The batter feels like silk....very smooth and moist and light.  I found it easier to work with after putting it in the freezer for 1/2 hour.  The smaller cookies turned out better than the larger cookies.

These are an excellent cookie.  Easy to make and great tasting.  They are a little sticky but definatly worth it.  They are usually all gone the same day that I make them.

These were just regular peanut butter cookies to me. I expected something great, I guess. I will probably not make these again- I will go back to my old recipe or try a new one. I however have never been a huge peanut butter cookie fan. Not worth the effort here- very sticky!!!

These cookies should be called 'snickers' cookies as they taste very like the chocolate bar.My son aged 10 made these on his own and found them very easy. I found the mix a bit too sloppy to roll into balls but they turned out just fine by dropping small spoonfuls of the dough onto the baking sheet.

These were very moist, but I didn't think they were real peanut buttery.  Next time I will add more peanut butter or try a different brand.

I have made these cookies several times. Some plain and some with milk chocolate chips. These cookies are excellent either way. I doubled a batch and my daughter took them to a Volleyball game. The whole team loved them! I thought the dough was a little sticky too, so I refrigerated the dough for about an hour and it was fine. Thanks for a great recipe that I will use often!

the dough is very sticky and it is hard to put the fork marks in them.  Otherwise, one of the best Peanut butter cookies I have ever had.

This is a great recipe! However, I had to add my own special touch to make it perfect for my family. I cut the vanilla by 1/2 and replaced it with 1/2 almond extract and omitted the egg completely. I also added a 1/2 TBSP of Pumpkin Pie Spice. They were DELICIOUS!

I absolutely will cherish this recipe forever! It's so easy to make and delicious too! I added chocolate chips to this recipe and my family went wild over how scrumptios they were! The plate of cookies was gone in no time! I would recommend this recipe for anyone who wants big "wows" with not a lot of fuss over the difficulty of preparing these cookies! Enjoy!

I am such a novice when it comes to baking, but these cookies were easy, great tasting, and I had all the ingredients right in the pantry -- didn't have to put it on the "I'll make it when I finally get the ingredients" list!  Thanks!

THIS WAS THE BEST PEANUT BUTTER COOKIE I'VE EVER EATEN!!!  I DID ADD SOMETHING THOUGH.  RIGHT AFTER I TOOK THEM OUT OF THE OVEN I ADDED HERSHEY KISSES TO THE TOP.  IF YOU LIKE PEANUT BUTTER CUPS YOU SHOULD TRY IT.

all my life, i have tried to find a peanut butter cookie recipe that my dad would think was "peanut buttery" enough.  i finally found it!  this recipe was great, especially with peanut butter chips & chocolate chips added.  it was a little more crumbly than i usually like, but the taste totally made up for it!  thanks for the recipe joey's girlfriend!

I live in Sweden where peanut butter is not a favorite.  I made this and gave to my boyfriend and friends and they loved it.  I plan to make this more often considering how easy this is to make.  thanks))
