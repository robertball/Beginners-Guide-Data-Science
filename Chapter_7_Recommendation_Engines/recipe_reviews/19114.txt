Excellent recipe!!! The first one I attempted was a lemon cake.  When I poured it into the bundt pan I saw that the batter was too much to fill the pan so I filled it to where I thought was enough, then I put the rest of the batter in a cupcake pan which made 11 cupcakes.  The cupcakes were done in half an hour, the cake was done in 45 minutes and it still seemed to be overdone by the appearance and texture of the crust, but it was AWESOME when I tasted it!!  I think I doubled the lemon extract to 2TB and it had a very good lemon taste.  The cake still rose a lot and almost ran over the edges of the bundt pan but managed to be contained. The second time I attempted the recipe I just made it into a vanilla cake instead of lemon and ended up adding maybe 3TB of vanilla to make sure it tasted like a vanilla cake and not just a "yellow" pound cake.  Again, the batter was too much for one bundt pan so this time I put some into a metal loaf pan.  (Maybe I should have used regular pound cake pan??)  The cake turned out so good and moist and my in-laws loved it and kept sneaking slices throughout the day!!!  My MIL even said my recipe blew away her mother's pound cake recipe because it was dense, yet soft and so very moist.  The crust comes out a golden brown and is ever so lightly "crunchy."  Even though the cake takes forever to mix (and I used a stand mixer and took probably 30 minutes mixing it) it's worth the time.  Your family and guests won't be disappointed!

Great pound Cake! My first time cooking it. I didn't have shortening and neither lemon extract, anyway I went ahead and made this cake using 1 1/2 cup of butter and added 1/2 tsp. of baking power. I had people coming over for dinner and that was dessert. They ate it even when it was still warm. They loved it. I had baked  this cake several times with the same  great results and keep giving away the recipe.
Thanks Barbara!

I bake a lot of cakes and this one went in the trash.  It was terrible-- it did not taste like a pound cake at all.  Please do not waste your time or effort in baking this cake. It does not deserve the 5 star rating by any means!!

I printed this recipe at Christmas time, his cake was such a hit with my husband and the rest of my family that I have made it at least 20 times since then! Perfect cake if you want something that is not to dry. At christmas I topped this cake with the glaze mentioned and pecans. Since the warmer months have come around, I have served this cake numerous times with strawberries and whipped cream and then a scoop of vanilla ice-cream. MMMMM GOOD! Thanks Barbra

This is a true pound cake, dense and moist.  Made this cake to serve to my customers in my restaurant and got rave reviews.  It's a keeper!!  I added roasted pecans to the batter and topped the cake with caramel sauce and and icing sugar mixed with milk and a drop of pure vanilla extract, drizzled all over the top and sides of cake and put the remaining roasted pecans on top of that.  Superb with a good cup of coffee.  Use pure vanilla extract in the batter, that's what gives it the flavour and you don't need much.  Artificial vanilla just doesn't cut it.

~Great~ pound cake. And huge! Enough for a couple of days even in a large 
family. I was looking for a pound cake that was similar to a lemon-tinged
cake that my grandmother used to make. Very, very close. 
I wasn't crazy about the glaze; the cake truly stands alone. Add some strawberries
and fresh cream and you will swear you have died and gone to heaven.

This recipe is wonderful.  Very moist--heavy and light at the same time.  I've been making pound cakes for 35 years and this is one of the best.

PERFECT.  WONDERFUL.  DELICIOUS!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I did make one change in the glaze.  I used 2 c powdered sugar, 1/3 c. lemon juice, 1T water and 2T butter.

I can't say enough about how great this cake is!

TIPS: I used all butter,no shortening.  Allow the butter and sugar to cream while you gather the other ingredients.  Cream until it's light and fluffly.  Use room temp. eggs for increased volumt.  Also, I used 1/2 container of lemon icing mixed with 1/4 sour cream for glaze.

I have been looking for a really nice, moist pound cake for some time.  During the holidays here in Bermuda, pound cake is very traditional, so I really needed to find a good recipe.  This one is wonderful.  The only difference I made was I added 1 tsp of orange extract and about 1 tbls of orange peel.  It was so good, the icing wasn't even needed.

This was my first attempt at baking from scratch and it was a great success.  My family loved the pound cake.  The cake was moist and delicious. The glazing was not need.  The cake stands on it's own!

I made this cake for a wedding cake. We did several trial cakes, and compared a number of pound cake
recipes. This one was the best! Moist, stayed mosit. Held up well under 3 double layers. We did brush it with a simple syrup before frosting. The photo does not do it justice. Also, be sure to adjust the cooking time for layer cakes. A layer cake cooks in about 30 to 35 minutes. I think you will be pleased with the cake.

I found this recipe about 2 years ago.  And I have made this cake over a dozen times.  I receive sooooo many compliments when I make it.  The only thing I do differently is add more lemon extract.  Other than that, I follow the directions to the "T".  You know this is a good recipe, when your grandmother request that you make this cake.

Oh my gosh!!! This is one of the best pound cakes I've ever made. I made this for one of my fondant classes last week.  I've just sliced it tonight and guess what...its still moist.  This will be my number one pound cakes I'll be using for my clients as well as for fondant covering.  I highly recommend this one to be used to cover with fondant.   The only two changes I made was used butter flavored Crisco instead of  reg. shortening, omitted the lemon juice and L. flavoring.  I replaced it with vanilla, butter and almond.  Soooo, soooo, good.

I used an electric mixer to mix the shortening, butter, and sugar, but I mixed all of the other ingredients by hand. On a whim, I tossed in a cup of peeled, cored & shredded granny smith apples. I left the topping off. This cake is so dense, moist and lemony, and it tastes wonderful when chilled - by far the best pound cake I've ever eaten, and so easy to make. Thanks!

I have been making pound cakes for years
and couldn't find my old recipe so used
this one. I am sorry to say it was
a major flop!! I rechecked everything
to make sure I had added all of the
ingredients and the temp was right..
but it turned out really bad. It 
was way too moist..wasn't cooked through (and my oven is very accurate).
Sorry.

A beautiful, high, moist cake. I made a substitution of sour milk for the milk in the recipe. Because of this, also added 1/2 tsp baking soda to offset the acidity of the sour milk (Wouldn't normally have done this, but we had about a quart of milk that had gone sour, and I can't bear to waste.) Also substituted 1-1/2 cups Splenda for 1-1/2 cups of the sugar (This one is because I'm a diabetic.) So total 1-1/2 cups sugar plus 1-1/2 cups Splenda. The outside was a dark brown with a slight crunch, the inside was moist and tasty. The results were phenomenal! Dense and fine grained, but never heavy. The soupcon of lemon is just perfect - very subtle, but just enough to point up the butteriness. It's a tie for the Cream Cheese Pound Cake I recipe on this site. Different, in that it doesn't have the tang that cream cheese imparts, but equally good. Served with a puree of fresh strawberries sweetened with (yup- you guessed it!) Splenda.

This reminded me of the pound cakes that the southern ladies in my church used to make and bring around to all the new neighbors... it was so good that I didn't even bother with the lemon glaze - it was perfect plain! It was also good with fresh whipped cream and strawberries!

Really liked this one! Came out perfectly, moist and dense but with a silky texture that was wonderful in the mouth. Flavor was great, but might not use quite as much lemon extract next time. I made this for my parents and my dad, who doesn't generally eat sweets, had three whole slices! Really delicious cake! It will be a standard of mine, now.

This was so good!  I subbed almond extract for the lemon (used a little less, since almond extract is strong), and left off the lemon glaze.  I served with fresh berries and sweetened fresh whipped cream.  Tasted better as it sat, so I'd make this a day early if you are serving it to guests.  YUM!

This cake is amazing!!!  I made it in an 11x14 pan and baked it for 30 minutes and it turned out perfect!!  My bundt pan is small and I was afraid it would overflow as it makes a rather large cake.  It is the softest cake I have ever made and will definitely make again!

Used all butter, no shortening, and skipped the lemon extract, adding some almond instead. For glaze I just used powdered sugar and milk. It turned out great, looks fantastic and tastes better. Used a 10 inch Bundt pan and had no issues with there being too much batter.

Excellent ! Thank you very much for sharing this beautiful cake. I served it at my daughters home, everyone raved about it, my mother who's advise I really appreciate, loved it too. I substituted the lemon extract with the rind of 1 lemon, and the juice of the same. It was fabulous

This was my first cake recipe used from the internet and I was very pleasantly surprised how well the cake came out.  It was very easy to follow and it was just as great as the description said it would be.  Very, very moist my daughters description of the cake was it felt like velvet.

Excellent, easy pound cake that is MOIST. The only change I would suggest is lightening up on the lemon extract if you want a little less lemon flavor. My family really enjoyed it. Stays moist wrapped in plastic wrap for days. Excellent recipe!

I made this for my mom's Sunday dinner and it was a huge success! It was super easy to make and was very moist and delicious. Kids and adults both loved it. I did add 1 teaspoon of grated orange peel and 1 1/2 cups of frozen blueberries that I had dusted with flour. I also baked it about 10 minutes longer than the instructions called for, but I figured the blueberries added a little extra time to the baking. Excellent! Thanks Barbara!

Very good cake, easy to make, although it was a lot of mixing ;)  I did have to sub in about 1/4 tbsp. of orange extract but the flavor still came out lemony.  Did not make the icing as we served it with strawberries.  It was delicious, everyone raved, but my complaint is that it seemed too sweet to me.  Perhaps the glaze would balance that out?  Great flavor and texture.

This recipe looks pretty close to the classic pound cake recipe, which if I remember correctly, had a pound each of eggs, butter, flour, and sugar with no baking powder.  I can see why someone wouldn't like it. It's denser, drier, and less sweet than your typical cake mix cake, but I like it. It's really good topped with fresh berries and whipped cream. I bet it would go with a lot of different toppings and flavorings.

I made this the Saturday day and had to make another today it went soooo fast. The only thing I changed is the lemon extract to orange. I accidentally doubled the butter in the recipe, but it still turned out great.

I love pound cakes. This is my first pound cake I've baked. I've made it several times and very pleased that it always turns out great. Tasted just like the ones I grew up on eating the after church Sunday dinners. Now I can cook it myself. Moist and dense.  My mother-in-law loves when I make it. Definitely a keeper.

This is absolutely the best pound cake around.  I have made it numerous times and it's always a hit.  Have given the recipe away more times than I can count.  Always a success, even for a beginner.  And you are right, a stand mixer works best.  I'm going to use this for my 25th Anniversary cake.  Much Thanks

We have a cake rule in our house:  I will bake a cake and we will keep half and we give the other half away.  Well we wanted to keep all of this cake to ourselves!!  This cake was really moist and not too sweet.  I did not even make the glaze because the cake was delicious without it.  This is a definite keeper!!

This cake had great flavor and texture.  It makes a substantial amount so you could probably cut the recipe in half for a regular 10 inch bundt pan.

Yummy and easy to make with my toddler "helping", but it overflowed from my 10" bundt pan. Would use a larger pan next time. Also, only had five eggs and it still turned out great. Served with the recommended lemon glaze as well as homemade tart cherry compote and vanilla bean ice cream. It was a hit!

Really, really very good. I did not have a large bundt cake pan, so I used two smaller ones and bake the cakes for 45 minutes. My family ate both of them, the cake was a big hit even though we are not big cake eaters.

The best pound cake ever!!!  I made this for Christmas for my family get together and they all know I'm not a cooker at all.  Well, I got so many compliments...the cake was gone the same day!  This recipe is most definitely a keeper!!!!!!  The only thing a did differently was I added more vanilla and lemon extract.  However, it was delicious!!!!

This was so yummy! I used it in my berry/lemon trifle. I also ended up with a LOT of cake; this recipe made 2 extra large loaf pans (about 4 regular loaf pans). I was able to freeze for later use, which will be an added bonus in the summertime when you do not want to run the oven so much.

This cake was okay. It has a nice taste, but it was a little dry to me. I think I'll leave it in the fridge overnight and try it again tomorrow.Hopefully it will be more moist the day after.

Great cake with wonderful dense texture. I wanted a stronger lemon flavor so I grated the zest of a lemon and added half the juice of the lemon to the batter. Used the other half to cut curlies for the top to decorate. Took to a summer party and everyone raved about the taste and texture. Will definately make this one again.

I'm eating a warm piece from the oven  and it is GREAT!!  I didn't have lemon extract, so I added a teaspoon of lemon zest and a teaspoon of fresh lemon juice to the batter.  I also used about 3 Tablespoons of lemon juice and only 1 cup of confectioners sugar for the glaze.  It turned out great and was more than enough for the cake.
This is definitely going in my recipe box!

Wonderful pound cake.  Made it today for dessert and it looks and tastes beautiful.  The only change I made was to replace 1/2 cup of butter with 4oz. cream cheese. Thank you for sharing.

I liked this cake. It turned out just the way i like it - crisp on the outside. The only thing I did different was i cut down the quantities of each ingredient, because I didn't want such a big cake. I also didnt have lemon extract. The only thing that didn't turn out right was the icing. I dont see how 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and one and a half cup of icing sugar will give you a glaze. I had to add more lemon juice and heat it up to make it a dough ball. That made it difficult for me to put on the cake, and in the end I didnt like the icing at all, so I peeled it off and threw it away. 
But the cake was worth making. I suggest finding an alternative glaze recipe for the top, because you'll need an icing for sure.

First pound cake I ever made - it was AWESOME, my husband loved every bite.  Very moist, and the lemon drizzle sets it apart.  I found I needed to use more lemon juice than what the glaze called for.  Made quite a bit of mixture, I was able to make 2 in loaf pans.  Thank you for sharing!  Will make again!!

Very dense and moist.  I didn't have lemon extract so I used lemon juice, which may be why it doesn't have a very strong lemon flavor.  I think it would be great served with strawberries.  By itself (with glaze), I just thought it was okay.

Excellent pound cake!  I didn't have shortening use so I just incereased the butter to replace the shortening amount and the cake turned out wonderful.  I used the glaze recipe too, however like most have stated this cake stands alone just fine without it.  I've been wanting to find a pound cake recipe that's easy and still tastes wonderful and I've found it!  THANKS BARBARA!!!

Totally sinful!  This is a delicious pound cake!  I think by accident I left out the shortening but it was still grand.  I put most of it in the freezer so I would not be too tempted.  Now we just take it out and slice a piece and we are good to go.  Awesome recipe!

This cake was pretty good, but made better by the fact that my kids liked it so much!  I thought it would be a little richer based on all the butter (I didn't use any shortening) but overall a good recipe.

Excellent cake! I didn't make any changes to the recipe. Just follow the instructions. I made many pound cakes and this one is the best! It's moist, soft, crunchy outside . You have to use two Bundt pans, it's way too much dough.

I made this for the first time and it turned out delicious! I followed another reviewer's suggestions of using all butter and I added the zest of one lemon to the batter. I am always worried poundcakes will be dry, but this was dense and flavorful and just the right texture! I was super pleased with how it turned out!

The recipe made a beautiful and extremely tasty pound cake. I served it with fresh strawberries and whipped cream, all gone. I did use all butter as I don't usually buy shortening and the cake turned out great. I will definitely make it again.

I'm very inexperienced in the kitchen, so I followed this recipe to the letter, and it was delicious!  I made this twice in 1 week and although they were different consistencies (I think because of how long I beat the mixtures) it was delicious each time.

The best pound cake I've ever made, used almond extract instead of lemon and it was fine.  Very light and not dry.

Loved it! Simple to make. It made a huge loaf for just me and my husband, but I don't think he minded :) We both agree that it tastes better after it's been in the fridge overnight.

Really great.  I made it in two loaf pans, did not glaze (it was delicious on its own) and froze one.  Even after I thawed the second one, the cake was fantastic.

I've never been a huge fan of pound cake, but my husband LIVED on the Sara Lee kind before we got married.  He won't go back to it after I made this for him!

just made it and it was fantastic - made it with almond extract instead of lemon - also the frosting used bottled lemon juice and a bit of vanilla - baked it a bit longer to get it crusty and it was alot of batter and i used 2 pyrex glass loaf pans and they came out perfect-also made them in convection oven because it was very hot outside - put them close together on raised rack and when i took them out the inside wasnt done well - rebaked each for 5 more minuets and just great - next time would switch pans half way thru for better browing - thank you barbara for a wonderful treat

Very good! I did not use the glaze provided but used a vanilla glaze. I also baked it in 2 loaf pans instead. Turned out great! Brought it to a Memorial Day Cookout and didn't have anything to take home!!

This was a great pound cake!  I was out of lemon extract, so I used orange extract in the batter which worked well.  I also needed to use about 3 tablespoons of lemon juice to make the icing a drizzling consistency.

oh my goodness....this was soooo good.  i was skeptical at first because it looked like it might be way too much batter, but it fit perfectly into two loaf pans!  it's nice and crusty on the outside, and i poured fresh lemon juice mixed with sugar over the top and I am right this moment eating a warm piece and it is SO delicious!!  thanks for the recipe!

I used a lemon glaze of 1/3 cup fresh lemon juice and 2/3 cup sugar, mix and brushed all over the hot cake. After cool, sprinkled with confectioners sugar.

It was very good. I didn't have the lemon extract so I used 1 TBL lemon zest and juice. The glaze ingredients must be a typo because 1 TBL lemon juice wasn't enough, I needed a bit more. The glaze tasted great, but overpowered the cake making it seem plain. Next time I'll use the extract  and see if that works better.

This was very good. It had great texture. It seemed to get better each day after I made it. The last piece was awesome! I made my glaze a little thinner by adding more lemon juice. That gave it a good tartness. Yummy.

The taste of this cake was good, but I have made it twice and both times it sank in the middle. If I were to try it again I would add baking powder and salt.

Good old fashioned pound cake - I used some buttermilk and added a couple extra eggs cause I had them handy. Came out great. Makes a dense, moist cake. Glaze was not needed. Serve with whipped topping mixed with your favorite yogurt and some fresh sliced fruit for a grand dessert.

I think this recipe is really good. When I tated the batter I was somewhat skeptical bc it wasn't very sweet. I made it today and upon taking it out of the pan I had to try a piece and it was wonderful warm. It is also very good at room temp. I used all vanilla as I did not have any lemon extract. I halved the recipe and  it came out good. I just think I may have let it cook too long as its a bit on the dry side. Also think next time I will add 1/4 cup more sugar. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is jsut as Barbara states. It comes out large and moist! I have tried several pound cake recipes and this one by far is The Best...I have had.
 I did make one alteration to it. I like more lemon taste that most so I put all 3 tsps. of lemon extract instead of as the recipe calls for. It still has a wonderful taste and texture it just has more of a lemon taste. I will also use this for the holiday time and make smaller cakes from it. This will make a wonderful gift with some of my home made jams!  Thank you so much!

Well... mines in the oven this very moment but i can't wait the batter was delicious so i'm betting the cake will be ten times better. I added a carton of fresh blueberries to mine.... can't wait....an hour sure is a long time... the anticipation is completely over whelming.

This is the best cake in the world! I have made it for dozens of friends and they all love it! You can't get enough. One friend actually buys me the ingredients to make her one every week or so. I will never try another pound cake recipe, this is the one!

This was so yummy -- just what I was looking for.  I usually never mess with recipes on the first try, especially 5 star ones, but I had some buttermilk I wanted to use up so I substituted milk for buttermilk and I used 1 1/2 cups.  After putting it in the oven I became worried that I had wrecked the cake by using too much liquid, but I was wrong.  It came out of the oven after about 85 minutes and it was wonderful!  I love the subtle tangy kick from buttermilk and it seemed like just the right ammount.  My only dislike about this was the bottom crust was a little crisp for me, but the cake itself was so good.  I also omitted the glaze, it really doesn't need it.  I may make this again and I would use butter and/or maple extract instead of the lemon just to change things up a bit.

I thought this recipe was okay.  I was really looking for a much more lemony cake....I added extra lemon juice and extra zest, but the end result wasn't what I was looking for.  It was incredibly moist, not just one I will probably make again.

WOW!  I made this poundcake for Easter and a few people came back for a second piece!  There was only one left at the end of the evening.  I added a teaspoon of lemon rind and those who wanted added a scoop of fresh strawberries and whipped cream... although it was great without it!

Yummy!!!!  I don't normally like pound cake but I found that I couldn't stop eating this one!!!  I made it for my dad's birthday and my family loved it.  Its very rich and moist...the only thing I did differently was use lemon juice instead of lemon extract.  Its a very very GOOD pound cake.
