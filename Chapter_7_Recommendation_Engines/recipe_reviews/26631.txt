Yikes! This was a recipe for those who like their food smothered. I fixed it in a dish and used the sauce on top. No one would eat it because the BBQ sauce was so overpowering. The meat salvaged without the sauce was o.k.

My husband has never liked any type of meatloaf I have ever tried; always too dry and not enough taste he said; however, this one was an absolute hit!! Very full of taste and not dry what so ever!!! He requests this dish at least once a week!!  As an update, I have changed from using the Hickory Smoked flavor BBQ sause to using, Kraft's Honey Hickory Smoked.  With that change it is filled with even more flavor.

I made this recipe almost exactly like it says, minus the brown sugar and bbq sauce on top. I used ketchup only and it came out FABULOUS!!!!! I am not a meatloaf eater at all but will eat this. People think I am nuts when i tell them I use stuffing mix in it instead of bread or crackers, TILL THEY TRY IT then they beg for recipe.

You don't need 2.5 lbs of beef, I used one and just most of the stuffing box (I used chicken flavour, it's all I had), and one egg.  The stuffing gave a tremendous amount of flavor to this dish.  I will def make this again!!!

I used to make this all the time until we ate it so much we got sick of it. There seems to be big chunks of stuff ing mix in it. So, I think next time I make it, I will use breadcrumbs instead of stuffing mix. I cut the recipe in half & put it in a meatloaf pan. In my opinion there is way too much sauce on the top. I cut it down to 1/4 C each of bbq sauce & brown sugar.

Nice start with an excellent finish. I started with this recipe as the barbecue sauce and herb-seasoned croutons appealed to me.  But that’s where my interest ended, as the rest of the recipe seemed very basic. So by the time I got done embellishing this recipe to my liking I guess the only resemblance it had to the original recipe was, for the most part, the barbecue sauce and herb-seasoned croutons.  So…I used a ground beef, veal and pork mix – 2 pounds total, so I scaled this recipe to 6 servings.  I processed the croutons into fine crumbs.  I didn’t want an overpowering taste of barbecue sauce, so I reduced it by a third, to 1/2 cup (again, for the recipe scaled to 6 servings for 2 pounds of meat). I made up the difference with the milk (I used half-and-half, increasing it to 1/2 cup).  I wanted some contrast in texture, so I added 1/2 c. each of chopped celery and green pepper, and 1 c. of chopped onion.  It isn’t meatloaf without these ingredients, if you ask me.  I more than tripled the garlic, to a full tablespoon, and added 2 tsp. of Montreal Steak Seasoning.  I skipped the glaze altogether.  Meatloaf and sugar don’t work for me.  No regrets on that either.  What started out as maybe a three star recipe turned out to be a 5-star recipe after, I admit, fairly significant changes.

My family enjoyed this meatloaf. The glaze is good, but you have to like barbecue sauce. It makes a lot so that you can spoon the glaze over each slice of meatloaf, in place of ketchup. I sometimes add 1 or 2 teaspoons of lemon juice to the glaze and that is good, too.

After 12 years of marriage and countless meatloaf related tears and tantrums from my husband, my dogs and myself I have finally found a meatloaf recipe that isboth easy and delicious. The only substitution I made was I ommited the brown sugar and bbq sauce Because I am not a big fan of sweet tasting meats. I substituted 1/2 cup ketchup which I put in the meatloaf mix. About 20 minutes before I took it out of the oven I spread more ketchup over the top and then let it cook. The loaf as juicy,seasoned just right and my husband didn't run for the hills and my dogs aren't trying too call the humane society to rescue them frothe horror of mommy's meatloaf.  Thankyou for contributing this recipe.

This is a great meatloaf variation.  The only thing I did differently was saute the onion before mixing it with the meat since I don't like crunchy onions in my meatloaf, and I halved the recipe.  We're barbecue lovers, we really enjoyed this, and I would make it again.

I used 2 lbs beef, 2 eggs 3/4 c stuuffing mix,1 c bbq sauce, 1 tsp liquid smoke and 1/2 pkg of onion soup mix. I topped the meat loaf with bbq sauce and then placed 2 slices of bacon on top. Cooked for 50 minutes and broiled for 10 minutes to crispy the bacon. Best meatloaf ever!!

Very Good!  I was surprised how well the stuffing worked.  I will use this from now on for other meatloaf receipes.  Very moist.  The whole family enjoyed it.

This was really good.  I didn't use the BBQ sauce on top based on everyone's ratings, but I might add a little next time.  It was delish without it too!  I didn't have the bread stuffing...so I used bread crumbs and threw in some oatmeal.  Also used 6 cloves of garlic (we love garlic.)  Incredibly moist.  I froze one and we ate one today (made last night.)

I cut this in half to use the pound and a quarter of ground beef I had. I used two medium eggs and I ended up using the whole amount of dry stuffing mix and a whole half cup of milk. I did add in about a tablespoon of worchestershire sauce, some oregano, basil, garlic/onion powder and I skipped the topping. At the last minute, I threw in about a half cup or so of shredded cheese I had on hand that needed to be used. Very close to the recipe I used from Kraft when I first met my husband and I started as a beginner cook, but with some minor changes to make my family happy. I liked that this came together in about ten minutes with cheap on hand items and that my littlest could help me make it, too.

Way too sweet and I only used half the BBQ sauce and didn't put the glaze on. I was not very nice looking either.

I made this for my fiance who loves meatloaf. He loved it. I did make a few substitutions though, I didn't use barbeque sauce, I used ketchup and about half the brown sugar. It was really easy to make and my fiance ate it up like it was the best thing he ever tasted.

afraid it failed with me.  I found it greasy & not tasty.   Admittedly I used about 1/2 pork & catsup instead of bbq sauce,& no brown sugar....., so it could have been my fault, but adding bbq sauce at the table did not help it.  I will try it as directed next time.

As is, I'm not a huge fan... mostly because of the bbq sauce and brown sugar. But by modifying it a bit is was pretty good.

I'm typically not a big meatloaf fan, but I loved this recipe! I followed the recipe exactly except I added a little ketchup to the BBQ sauce that went on top of the meatloaf. I made 4 small loaves instead of 2. GREAT recipe! Will definitely be making again.

OK, but had an unusual taste.  I used regular BBQ sauce, rather than hickory...perhaps that would have made a difference.

I made this for an office potluck and everyone loved it.  One of the guys told his girlfriend and she now wants the recipe.  I did not use the sauce on top as a lot of reviews said the sauce was too much.  Will defineately add this to my list of favorites and will make again.

My family really enjoyed this. I am not a fan of meatloaf but my husband and son are. I found this one looking for one with lots of taste and this was it. I just used whatever barbeque sauce I had on hand because I don't like hickory smoke alot and put a mixture of ketchup and brown sugar on top because I ran out of barbeque sauce. You can really make the taste your own with whatever flavor sauce you prefer.

I cut this recipe in half for my family and it was the perfect amount for two adults and three small children. The sauce was too potent and had to scrape it off and put ketchup on it for the kids. It was a great meatloaf for those that like bbq.

I have been using my mom's meatloaf recipe for years, and happened upon this one while I was searching for what to do with 2.5 lbs of beef I needed to use up.  I made it exactly as the recipe called for, using 93% lean beef, and it got rave reviews from my husband.  He says it was "awesome" and needs to be added to regular rotation.  I read all the other reviews saying it made too much glaze, but I thought it was just the right amount to spoon over each slice I cut.  The key is to make sure it rests for 15 minutes before serving.  This lets the glaze thicken slightly, so when you pour it over the loaves it is a real coating.  It IS a sweet glaze, so I would recommend if you don't think meatloaves should have any sweetness, use plain bbq sauce or bbq mixed with ketchup for the glaze.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory & Brown Sugar bbq sauce in the meat and topped with a local-made sauce that is very vinegary mixed with the brown sugar.  On the west side of Chicago, it is called "mild sauce" at our local BBQ place.  Served with scalloped potatoes and steamed frozen peas, and it was truly delicious!

What a clever idea to use the dry bread stuffing mix!! I left out the bbq as the smoke-flavoring was kind of over-powering for us, but ketchup works great!  Here's a meatloaf tip:  make mini loaves in your cupcake tins.  Only takes about a half hour to cook, holds together well and with a little ketchup on top, looks cute on the plate, and we all know presentation is important!

Being English, I had never tried meatloaf before making this recipe. It tasted nice but fell apart when I took it out the dish. Not sure if that is normal or not? I had expected it to stay in slices like a loaf of bread.

This meatloaf was very tasty, but I did find the barbeque sauce a bit overpowering. It made the meat a bit too sweet in my opinion! Next time I'll probably leave the barbecue sauce out of the meat and just use it for the topping.

WOW, just WOW. This is probably the best meatloaf I have ever had in my life. I used 2lbs of meatload instead of 2 1/2, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. My husband absolutely loved it, and since I'm only cooking for two I have leftovers for the next few days. I would definitely recommend this recipe to anyone.

Way too much sauce for the topping along with sugar, so I fudged the recipe a bit and YUM! About a half cup of brown sugar, and maybe a half cup of BBQ sauce with a bit of water. Enough drippings for the mashed taters!

I love meatloaf and have been made several great recipes over the years.  This was my favorite.  & so easy!  I only had Stove Top to use for bread cubes. For topping: I used half Chili sauce half/BBQ sauce and the brown sugar.  It was fabulous.   (Made two, froze one with out topping.) I will use this recipe from now on.   Addictive.

I didn't make the sauce (too much sugar and time), accidentally left out the onion, and used half ketchup and half BBQ sauce (because we were low). I turned out great! Although my husband did add BBQ sauce on his piece, as always. *sigh*

The instructions were poor.  It  said to add the bbq sauce in step 2 and again  in step 3.   Which is it???      So I added a cup in step 2 & 3 and 2 cups was way too much..  Next time I will try half mixed in in step 2 and the other half in step 3 to go on top.  Would be nice if the recipe were properly written to clarify how much  bbq sauce goes in in which step.

Just made this a few nights ago and it was DELICIOUS!  I actually made 2 loaves-one, I followed recipe exactly as written EXCEPT did use 3 LB of hamburger as that is what the package was that I bought.  I didn't change anything else and it was very moist and tasted great.  The other loaf, I used the same amount of hamburger and followed recipe exactly except added some shredded cheddar cheese to the mix.  I don't think I added that much cheese to really alter the flavor too much so could definitely add more if you like it cheesy.  I will absolutely use this recipe again and again!  We are BBQ sauce fans so for us, it was great.  If you don't want that much BBQ, just eliminate the glaze.  I didn't think the mixed in sauce was too much BBQ and it was still very moist WITHOUT the glaze.  Hubby hated meatloaf growing up but this recipe has turned him into a meatloaf lover now!  Also, this makes a lot which is why I made 2-we have dinners for the ENTIRE week!  And the leftovers were wonderful as well!

I never was big on Meatloaf especially with all the ketchup on top. Since my husband isn't a fan of ketchup I tried to find one that didn't any in it or on it. I came across this recipe and just had to try it. I love this recipe and will be making this again. Thanks for sharing!

I add extra onions and garlic. I also added liquid smoke to add more flavour and everyone LOVES it! Additionally,  I line a 9 1/2" x 13"  pan with parchment paper including the sides to make cleanup a breeze. I always make 8 servings,  even though we are small eaters,  keeping some for leftovers and freeze some (or at least ATTEMPT to) for my daughter away in school. It's a fabulous recipe and have made this many times!

I did reduce the BBQ sauce to 1/2 cup.  The rest I made exactly as the recipe says.  I did not make or use the sauce at all because my family likes to use plain ketchup with meatloaf.  The actual meatloaf turned out awesome!  I have been searching for the perfect meatloaf recipe for years and this is it for us!  I put a greased cookie cooling rack on a baking sheet and baked the meatloaf on that so the grease drips down.  I baked mine uncovered on the "Convect Roast" setting at 325 for one hour.  The outside looked over done, but it turned out that the outside had the perfect crust while the inside was soft and moist.  Great flavor and texture all around! If you don't have a convect setting, bake at 350 as the recipe states.

This was my first meatloaf ever and my boyfriend loved it.  I substitute a spicy bbq sauce for the glaze and mix a mild and spicy bbq sauce for the hickory bbq sauce.  I did this my first time because I forgot to pick up the hickory at the grocery store, and now I sub all the time. I serve with steamed rice and we spoon the glaze over that, too. Very easy for anyone that is not a seasoned home cook.  Someone mentioned the stuffing mix was in chunks.  I use stuffing mix in other recipes.  The trick is to break it down while is it still sealed in the bag.  I lay it flat and press on it with the palm of my hands.  I love this recipe because if you mess up, it doesn't hurt the finished product.

great BBQ-ey meatloaf... I made mine with ground turkey as we have some non-red meat eaters in the house and it turned out very moist and flavorful. I halved the amount of glaze, as some reviewers reccomended, but did add a little more BBQ sauce to the top as it seemed to need a little thicker glaze... had no problem with the stuffing (it dissapeared ito the loaf as it should have). Thought it was great!
