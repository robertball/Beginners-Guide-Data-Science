This just didn't do it for us. The ratio of the dried cherries to the apples seemed off, and 1/4 cup of flour too much. If I was to make this again I would add another couple of cups of apples--the cherries would then be a nice accent rather than dominating the pie--we could barely taste the apples.  With the amount of cherries and apples kept as written, however, the flour should be reduced to just a couple of tablespoons.

The baking temperature was too hot and the top crust ended up almost burned and the filling and bottom crusts were undercooked.  The filling was runny.

This pie turned out wonderful.  The only change that is needed is in the cooking temperature.  Bake at 425 for ten minutes then lower it to 350 for one hour.

This was awesome. I used Alton Brown's pie crust recipe for this, and it worked great. The flavor of this pie is sour and wonderful. I was so pleased it wasn't oversweetened. It took 8 small granny smiths plus a full (small) bag of the dried cherries. I might add more cinnamon next time just because I'm a cinnamon junkie. I will agree with another reviewer that the cherries do kinda dominate the flavor, but that's OK by me because I love dried cherries. I found the amount of flour in the filling to be fine. As others did, I let the pie bake at 425 for just 15 minutes, then knocked it down to 350 for an hour. About 20 minutes before the end I covered it with foil so the crust wouldn't get too brown. Shoulda done the milk-and-sugar thing for the crust, but it was still a fine, fine pie without. Got rave reviews. I had a little trouble with my top crust (not enough water) so it didn't look as pretty as I wanted--but it was yummy anyway. The cherries ended up plump-ish and there wasn't any juice running all over the place even on the first cut (after cooling for five hours) so if you like the runny juice thing you might want to back off on the interior flour. I liked it exactly as it was. The pie was not tall--I might add a couple of extra apples next time to get a taller pie, but maybe not. :)

I adore this recipe!  We use dried cranberries instead of cherries.  I've made it for special fall occasions such as Thanksgiving.  The perfect amount of sweet and tart.

This was a hit. I used up a mixture of different apples I had on hand and added an extra dash of cinnamon..Delish!

Great pie - everyone loved it!  I actually used closer to eight cups of apples and one cup dried cherries; if I had used less apples I believe the cherries would have been overpowering.  I also lowered the temp to 350 after ten minutes.

Five Stars! I loved this pie it was delicious! I did turn the heat down to 375 after ten minutes. I also used cherry pie filling instead of dried cherries. That was all I had and it worked great. I just added 1/4 cup more flour. Also added more cinnamon. I used the Best Ever Pie Crust Recipe that is also on the All Recipe Site! It worked wonderfully! Need to try it! Glad I found both recipes!

So so good. Got nothing but compliments on this pie. After ten or fifteen minutes I lowered the temp to 325 and I cooked it a little longer. Works well even without cherries. A definite Thanksgiving favorite at our house!

This came out great.  I brought it to a family gathering for Christmas and just made it again for Easter.  Everyone loves it.  The only thing I did was added 2 or 3 more apples than the recipe calls for.  The first time I made it, the pie sunk in the middle a little bit.  Other than that, the recipe is fantastic!

Pie recipe is amazing. Honestly so good. I made it with the french pastry crust recipe on here. I used fuji apples because that is what I had, I think a more tart apple would be better but it was still great!

Good recipe for a dried cherry lover.  I used sweet Rome apples so I cut the sugar in half and used Tapioca instead of flour.  I felt the pie needed a little water and sprinkled 2 T of water.  Still thought it could use a little more after we tried it. Of courses, we cover ours with ice cream, so it wasn't dry:)  Easy pie.
