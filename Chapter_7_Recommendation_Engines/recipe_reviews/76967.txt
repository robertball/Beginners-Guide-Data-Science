Delicious, yummy and easy!  I didn't have 30 min. to let the cucumbers sit and drain, but they were fine after maybe 10 or 15.

this is good and easy. I added some plain yogurt in place of some sour cream, and kosher salt is much better to use on the cucumbers--you want to get rid of liquid, not make them salty.

I only made the cucumber salad and it was pretty good.  I added celery seed instead of dill, because it was what I had at the time.  I also only added 4 tablespoons of sour cream, left the seeds in and sliced my cucs chunky. :P Tasty.

We made this for dinner last night. We are watching our calories but not wanting to miss out on flavor. We made it exactly as written, it was full of flavor. The salad is light and refreshing. We will make this many more times. It is super!

Very flavorful. Loved the salad. I did add balsamic vinager to the salad which gave it a richer flavor.

Well I only made the cucumber salad to this recipe. I also made the salmon but I put it in the oven. I brushed olive oil on the filets, added a little bit of dill and rosemary and pepper and salt to each of them (not much just a little of each) then squeezed lemon juice on them and put some thin lemon slices on top, wrapped them in foil, put them on a baking sheet and into the oven. :) The cucumber salad was good too but I did add some chopped, seeded tomatoe pieces and it was yummy. I also just used regular vinegar since that is what I had. Both went very well together! Thanks for the idea ;)

This was ok. The cucumber salad lacked alot of flavor, but the salmon was good.

Absolutely delicious!  I was worried that the salmon itself wasn't "dressed up" enough, but the cucumbers were the perfect compliment and there was just enough sauce to add flavor but not take over.  Really nice recipe!

I just made the cucumber salad and it was really good. i didn't have red wine vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar. Seemed to work ok. And I bet it's awesome with the salmon!

I only made the cucumber salad tonight, but even with salmon its good. Simple methods work best with very fresh fish. We really enjoyed the cucumber salad tonight, I followed the recipe exactly. I liked the balance of everything; I like having a bit more sauce on my cukes. That said, next time I'll double the cucumbers and keep the rest the same. We are not huge fans of fresh onion, but this recipe is a keeper! Thanks!

I used this recipe mainly for the cucumber salad (because oil, salt and pepper on salmon isn't really a recipe) and while the flavour of the dressing was nice - do people really put that much on?!?! I made the dressing separately and wouldn't have even put 1/4 of it on the cucumber and that was plenty. If you want some cucumber with your sour cream, then this is the recipe for you. But if you're like me and actually enjoy cucumber, then I suggest you keep looking.

This was a recipe that I just happened to have the ingredients on hand so I tried it.  I didn't have raised expectations especially with the Cucumber Salad.

With the grilled Salmon I cheated by throwing some Montreal Seasoning mixed with Creole Seasoning.  I cooked this on a charcoal grill at about 400 degrees external temperature.  When the whitish sauce appeared on top of the Salmon I pulled it and the Salmon looked great.

With the Cucumber Salad I made 1 substitution.  I used Greek Yogurt instead of Sour Cream.  I also added a little more dried Dill.

The taste of this recipe was superb!  The Cucumber Salad accompanies the Salmon perfectly whether added together or on the side.  The Salmon was exceptional as well.

My Mom and Dad who normally are picky eaters went for 2nd and 3rd's on the Cucumber Salad.

This was simple to make with easy to find ingredients.  This is a great Spring or Summer dish to make.

We were split on this - those that like their salmon cooked with a marinate or sauce, probably won't care for this one much. The cucumber onion salad was better than we thought it would be.  I followed the recipe for the most part, except I used sea salt on the cucumbers and not quite half what was called for.  We will have again when we're in the mood for something different.

Really great texture and taste combination with the warm Salmon and the cool, crunchy salad. Will make again!
