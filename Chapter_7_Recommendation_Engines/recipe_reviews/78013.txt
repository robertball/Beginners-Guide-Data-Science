I love the simplicity of microwaving the asparagus.  I microwaved the asparagus (snapped into thirds) and a little bit of diced red onion. I made the dressing as directed.  I loved it.  The only reason why I gave it four stars versus five was I do not think you need to serve it over greens.  A nice touch but not required.  I loved it!

Steamed the asparagus, toasted the hazelnuts, added a splash of honey to dressing and let it all marinade together overnight. Yum! I have to agree that the asparagus tastes better alone than with the greens.

a nice quick salad although I too added a little sweetness to the dressing (and halfed it)- I added orange honey which complimented the juice. I also steamed the asparagus instead of microwaving it... that allowed me to avoid the hassle of configuring microwave wattage. Running the cooked asparagus under cold water after it was to my liking, also stopped the cooking to help keep it somewhat crisp. This recipe would also go nicely over baby spinach with fresh bacon bits replacing the hazelnuts.

I halved the dressing recipe, which was more than enough for 1 bunch of asparagus. Also, I added a little bit of sugar - otherwise it was WONDERFUL. I will make it again.

I have served this at several dinner parties now.  It is so easy and absolutely delicious.  People like the dressing so much they dip meat in it after the greens are gone!

It is nice to know that I can cook asparagus in the microwave.  I didn't serve this over greens, just served the marinated asparagus as a side dish.  Next time I'll cut the dressing/marinade in half because there was way more than I needed for just the asparagus.  Still, this was quite good and we enjoyed it.

This was good but nothing amazing.  I marinated the asparagus in 1/2 the dressing and then used the other 1/2 on the salad.  I also added tomato, cucumber, and boiled eggs.  I used almonds instead of hazelnuts.  I steamed the asparagus instead of doing it in the microwave.  Overall it was very easy but not so great that I'll make it again.

I scaled this down to two servings, but other than that, followed the recipe exactly.  I have not prepared asparagus in the microwave, so I was interested to see how this would work.  I set the timer for 3 minutes, and it was a little long for us, because it was past the "toothy" stage.  5 minutes would have caused it to disintegrate, I believe.  There were no problems with the lack of a vent in the plastic wrap.  As a matter of fact, it worked quite well, and as soon as the dish hit room air, the asparagus looked like it had been shrink-wrapped.  Nice touch to add hazel nuts, but I feel walnuts would have worked just as well.  This was a tasty salad.  Thanks!

I would rate it a 4.5 or 5 EXCEPT for the dressing. WAY too much balsamic vinegar and not enough olive oil. When I tasted the dressing, it took the top of my head off. I added a tablespoon of honey but still too strong.

I also made other changes because of the lack of "inventory". Had no salad greens so used two types of fresh basil growing in pots on my back porch. A friend gave me some orange infused olive oil I used for the dressing. I cooked the spears as directed in mic then completely chilled. Had no hazelnuts so used walnuts and threw in some blueberries!
