I give 5 stars not to this actual recipe but to the vegi version I make, which is much more simple.  I just use vegi crumbles (Morningstar and BOCA make them) and follow the recipe on the back of a typical Sloppy Joe seasoning packet from the grocery store (basically 1 6 oz can tomato paste and 1C. water) adding extra garlic powder and paprika.  The only thing I change is that I cut back the water and tomato paste just slightly from the packet, since vegi meat doesn't absorb liquids and flavor like real meat.  They always turn out perfect and take 10minutes to make.

I used a Hickory Barbecue sauce, which made this dish very tangy, but pretty good!  I would recommend this dish, but watch out!  They don't call it SLOPPY for nothing!

Great tasting and so easy to make.  I have made them a few times already and will make them again.

This dish was terrible! It tasted like bbq sauce on a bun. I do like bbq sauce, but it was too over powering. Perhaps some ketchup to soften the blow?
Although I'm a fan of Boca's, this recipe was awful!

I really liked it - few ingredients, simple and quick to make, and even the meat eaters in my house thought it tasted very good!

Very good, but I'm not a huge fan of onions, so I just used some onion powder instead.
