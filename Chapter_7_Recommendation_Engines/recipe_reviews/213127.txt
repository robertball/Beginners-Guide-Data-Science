Mathew, seriously?!  This is AMAZING!!!!  I followed the recipe exactly and the only change I made was to fill pre cut won ton wrappers.  Served it with a simple marinara sauce.  Super delish.  I will make these again for sure.

Oh my gosh, this was amazing!!!! Our store was out of pine nuts so I just used sunflower seeds instead and it tasted great; the nuts gave it more of a 'meaty' texture and the spinach and feta made it so rich. My husband LOVED it. I used the Egg Noodles recipe from this site to make the raviolis - it was really easy and wonderful. If you do that though, you only need half of the filling. Next time I'll half it. Thank you so much! I will definitely make these again.

DELICIOUS!!!  This is definitely a MUST-MAKE-AGAIN!
6/29/2012 Update: Followed this pretty much exactly as written but subbed wonton wrappers for pasta sheets and I toasted the pine nuts. I also used the lid of a jar that was slightly wider than my filling to cut the extra pasta off. GENIUS. Made the perfect amount of filling to pasta. Still amazing.

Delicious!! I made this using walnuts (I couldn't bring myself to spend $7 on pinenuts). I sauteed the spinach in some garlic, because I love garlic and used wonton wrappers for the pasta. Awesome! Served it with Marinara. It made so much that I froze half of it! Looking forward to having it again!

Made this with friends for New Year's Eve and served coated with Pesto. It takes some time to prepare but well worth the effort. Delicious!

These were incredible!   I used walnuts instead of Pine Nuts since I hate "Pine Mouth".    Served them with a walnut, cream sauce.    AWESOME!

This was a lot of work, and the result wasn't anything spectacular.  Both my husband and I thought the filling was bland, perhaps in need of pepper.  I love all the ingredients and was so excited to try this recipe.  I followed it exactly and ended up forcing five raviolis into my mouth before throwing it in tupperware and making a microwave meal.  Now, if you took the filling, added garlic and black pepper, and then tossed some spiral noodles in it, that might have been edible.

I wouldn't say that this is incredibly easy, I filled up the sink with dishes, silverware, and little bowls by the time that I had finished but it was pretty good, not bland at all. I used wonton wrappers instead of making my own ravioli and that worked out nicely. I would suggest adding only a little bit of the filling as a little goes a long way. They were easy to cook. I had to add an egg to the mixer because with all of the dry ingredients I couldn't get it to mix and that worked nicely. I also added some garlic to the mix because I always do! Great recipe and it makes a TON.

I only made the filling because I don't eat eggs.  The filling was very good, my hubby loved it and even my 4yrd ate it.  I used almonds instead of pine nuts because my son ate all the pine nuts when he was helping.

The filling was awesome! I wanted to try different fillings for ravioli so I halved this recipe and 2 more (1 cheese, 1 butternut squash) and everyone agreed this was their favorite. Instead of pine nuts we used walnuts and man, this came out near perfect.

This is an excellent ravioli recipe. Next time I will put away my ravioli mold and make bigger raviolis. After making the ravioli,  I put them on a tray and put them into the icebox of the refrigerator.  They didn't break apart as previous reviewers commented.

Made with the Easy Homemade Pasta Recipe, and got rave reviews for this meal.  It was so delicious!  Had a bit of filling left over and my husband loved it as a sandwich spread.  You should all make this!!

I added some fresh parsley to the mixture and a small clove of garlic ( just because they were spare). I also fried some fresh sage leaves in a little oil to dress the dish. 
To sum up: I made it for lunch, and my wife wants me to make it again for dinner!
Excellent recipe.

Pretty tasty dish...I used cashews instead of pine nuts but otherwise followed the recipe.  Served it with red sauce mixed with some alfredo from a jar.  Wife really liked it, she's a veg so I'm always looking for something to make that we'll both like.

I borrowed a couple different suggestions and added carmelized onions and a little nutmeg and of course fresh ground pepper. I topped the raviolis with a little brown butter.  Delightful!!

This was a hit at a ravioli making dinner party. I used a blend of pine nuts, walnuts and sunflower seeds in equal amounts. Roasting the nuts & seeds makes it very tasty! I also added a little bit of nutmeg. I used a stick blender since I didn't have a food processor to mix it together and it came together fine with 1-2 tbps of olive oil. For a sauce I roasted some garlic and blended it with melted ghee to drizzle on top. Definitely will make again.

We are having a dinner party tomorrow night and I made these and butternut squash raviolis as well. As I was mixing the ingredients as listed I tasted it, and as others, found it rather bland. I caramelized onions and added 4 cloves garlic and white pepper. Tasted...not so great...still! Cap full of Marsala wine and then parmesan to thicken out the liquid. A little nutmeg and it finally tasted good.

This was very good. This was my first attempt at making ravioli. It took a bit of time to stuff them but it was easy to do. I tossed the ravioli in a mix of tomato basil pesto & marinara sauce.

I added an onion, garlic, a dash of salt and pepper and nutmeg to the filling. 
When ready I drizzled some olive oil over the ravioli and sprinkled with parmesan cheese. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is so great! I used walnuts instead of pine nuts and I use wonton wrappers  now instead of pasta sheets. I add fresh herbs to the filling too. I highly recommend this recipe to all but make sure you cook the pasta long enough. The first time I tried this, the ravioli rose to the surface of the the boiling water quickly and they ended up being undercooked. Thanks for this superb recipe!!

Loved this , so did my family. My kids don't like pine nuts too much, but they all still liked it. I did toast the pine nuts first. Next time I will try other nuts as suggested. It does take some time, but its well worth it.
