I used salt instead of salt substitute, and real butter instead of transfatty margarine.  I also used french bread to make the bread cubes. 

I added: 1/4 teaspoon each of clove, nutmeg, and an 1/8 tspn allspice. 

I find that leaving it covered for the entire hour gives a better result if you're using french bread.
