I used 1 cup whole wheat flour in place of the all purpose flour, and changed the half and half to yogurt.  This was very good bread!  I baked it in a 9" pie pan for about 30 minutes, so we could have wedges of bread for supper.

This is the most delicious bread! And I've made many types of bread over the years. No more running over to Panera when I want a special cheese bread! Thanks a million for posting!

Wonderful, fast and easy bread!!  Spices can be added or changed according to your meal.  I love spicy food, but adding extra Cayenne just doesn't work well with the recipe.  I cook it in a pie pan so I can cut it in wedges for dinner - cook time is about 20-25 minutes for this type of pan.  I also add about 1/8-1/4 cup more milk, or it seems too dry and dense.  It's been a hit every time!

This is the first bread I have ever made, and it turned out very well! I liked the texture-- not too dry, and perfectly moist! The cheese gave it a lovely taste (and pretty orange tinge). The only thing I would leave out is the cayenne pepper, it sorta overpowered the other flavors and left my mouth hot for quite some time. BUT, I am not a spice fan, so I'm sure you spicy-food-lovers will love the recipe with the pepper in it. Thanks a lot! ~Bae

This is a good basic recipe, but of course I couldn't leave it alone. I didn't have any onion powder or Italian seasoning or enough cheddar cheese. So..I did have basil and oregano and I threw in mozzarella, parmesan and the end of a carton of cottage cheese. The results were very good and I will make this again.  Might try rosemary and gouda instead of the spices and cheeses listed. It's a good last minute bread for soup or salad using ingredients that you would have on hand.

I liked this bread quite a bit. I did alter things a bit. I used half whole wheat and half white flour, decreased the cheese, added some sun dried tomatoes and dropped the oil. It was a dense bread, but I liked it. Its nice to be able to make a fast tasty bread to have with dinner.

Absolutely amazing!!  My 5 year old loved it.  This recipe is so versatile.  I did cut back on the cayenne just a smidge (little over a 1/4tsp) because of my 5 year 5 and 2 year old.  I made 8 mini loves (18 mins) and 1 semi mini loaf (22mins) and they came out great.  I'm always in search of quick and easy morsels to take to staff meetings.  I know this will be a hit.

I didn't want the spicy factor so I just left out the cayenne and everyone gobbled it up! It was very easy and had the consistency of drop biscuits with a nice crunchy crust all around. The heal was to die for! yummy! Next time we may try some green chile inside. Also, I didn't have half-and-half so I just used all milk and it came out fine:)

Very good recipe!!  It was so easy to make!  It took 30 minutes to mix it up and bake it.  I didn't have Italian seasoning, so I used a tsp. of basil and a 1/2 teaspoon oregano.  It was wonderful with soup.  It is also a good base.  I will be trying different cheeses each time.

This is a dense, bread that's tender on the inside and crusty on the outside with a predominant flavor of Italian seasoning and cayenne pepper. I used fat-free half and half and skim milk. This bread was the perfect accompaniment for soup.

The flavor was great and the prep was super easy, unfortunately it seemed to have too much oil, IMO...maybe from the cheese?  I also didn't have any half & half so I used heavy cream and skim milk...maybe that contributed too?  Anxious to try it with Parmesan and mozzarella next time instead of cheddar.

I didn't have time to make a full loaf of bread, so I was looking for a simple, but flavorful, quick bread. This is now my go-to recipe for a delicious quick bread - thank you!

Keeper!  Mmmmm! Several of us were in the kitchen when this came out of the oven, and this loaf didn't last long.  Everyone who tried it (even those who don't care for spicy foods) enjoyed this to the fullest.  Thanks so much for sharing! :)

So delicious!! I made a few modifications, used 1 c wholewheat flour, 3/4 c white, splash of extra milk (and I used only 1% milk, no half and half) as well as extra cheese and seasonings in the bread and a bit sprinkled on top. Bit of a crunch on the outside, so moist on the inside. This is going to be an addicting recipe for sure!

I have made this recipe so many times I can't even count any more! I absolutely love it. I do add some extra garlic powder, onion powder, and Italian seasoning. I usually put a few extra shakes into the batter and sprinkle some on top. I also add a large pinch of extra cheddar cheese and some Parmesan cheese, and I sprinkle these over top before baking as well. It's quite spicy, so I sometimes do more like 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper. I typically use all milk (skim at that!) since I rarely keep half and half in the kitchen. Still turns out great! Crumbly, yes, but awesome flavor and sooo addicting.

My friends and I did this recipe for our exam in a cooking class. We found the bread fell apart easily, so we did it again as biscuits. It turned out much better and it was such a hit the teacher put it on the Menu as a side. :)

This was really good. I cut the cayenne in half and used low fat cheese and fat free milk to make it a little healthier.

This was excellent and ridiculously easy!  We all loved this.  It has a biscuit-like texture, which went great with the soup I made.  The only thing I did differently was leave out the cayenne because I was serving it to a 3 year old.  I can't wait to try it spicy.  So good!

I made this bread and really enjoy it!  I do not tolerate very spicy food, but this is great. the cayenne give a little kick but not too bad.  My boys would like more spice but say it has a great flavor. I will try to make it Gluten free for a friend with Celiac and see how it goes.  Thank you for posting the recipe.

I made it as is (except substituting the cream with milk as it's all I had to hand).  Delicious and easy to throw together,  like a huge,  yummy cheese scone!  Thanks for posting.

One tip, with the cheese, it tends to stick to the pan.  Use parchment paper on the bottom of the pan so it will fall out easily. I grease my pan then put down parchment paper cut to the size of the bottom of the pan so it stays in place.  We liked this bread a lot and it's super easy and forgiving.  I used a cup of evaporated milk because it was what I had. I used cheddar cheese and finely chopped jalapeno peppers, salt and pepper instead of all the spices and it was delicious.    Saving the recipe and will definitely make this over and over again.

The only change I made was I used 1/4  Cayanne pepper instead of  1/2 only because I have family members sensitive to spice. This recipe was awesome and I got great compliments from it. Served it with honey-garlic-curry chicken, rice and vegetables. Will definitely make this again!

I thought this was good. I was looking for a  savory bread to have with dinner. My husband asked if it was Red Lobster’s cheddar biscuit recipe. So, if you are familiar with those tasty bites, this recipe is spot on.

Liked this for toasting with butter on...left out spice abs doubled up on the cheese. The texture is perfect!  Crusty outside and soft inside... definitely super easy quick bread

An excellent basic recipe. We enjoyed ours baked in muffin tins (20 min). It's very much a biscuit texture.

OMG  this is soooooooo good!  i left out the onion because we don't care for oniony things.  i used 3/4 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup all purpose flour.  definitely a keeper!  my picky son gave it a thumbs up!
