Initially I had used the "ingredients on hand" to find a recipe using chicken, broccoli and cheese and this recipe popped up. So having said that, I used cooked chicken instead of ham and also added a can of mushrooms (with liquid)to the other ingredients. I omitted the cornflakes because I didn't have any on hand.I also added a little poultry season and a few shakes of crushed red pepper for some pizzaz. I put all ingredients in the microwave for 5 minutes so that the hashbrowns would thaw out some before putting in the oven. This was very good. There was enough to make a 9x13 plus a small one which I shared with my son and his wife. Thanks for the recipe!

I like the broccoli and garlic added to an old time favorite of ours.
