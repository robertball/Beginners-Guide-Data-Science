I added a few more spices that I found on other recipes and served with corn bread muffins. It was great!

This dish was very good!  It’s hearty and filling.  I did add another can of diced tomatoes and it could have used more beans as someone else mentioned.  I also added some leftover quinoa which made it thicker and hearty!  It could have used a little more salt but you can salt and pepper to taste.  It’s a keeper!

I made this for the first time in the crock pot and it came out great, just like in my Le Cruset.   I do not use any peppers as I am allergic.  But even so it still comes out really well.  I change it up a bit each time, sometimes using butternut squash in place of sweet potato.  I prefer things more savory than sweet, so will omit OJ if I use sweet potato.   I also tend to double the tomato and beans.  such a great recipe base.

The flavors of the sweet potatoes and orange juice makes this chili taste different than most. It doesn't have that deep rich tomato flavor and it was a nice change to my usual chili recipes. I used the slow cooker on low for 7 hours.
