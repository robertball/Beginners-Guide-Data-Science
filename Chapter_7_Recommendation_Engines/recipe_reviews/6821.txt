Very good pita bread. I don't have a bread machine so I made the dough using a kitchenaid mixer. It came out really puffy with a nice pocket inside. The trick to a nice pocket is to not over handle the dough too much. I learned this from a friend who is Israeli. We love pita and I will be using this recipe again...it's a real keeper. For those of you without a bread machine, proof dry yeast in warm water with the sugar. When foamy add oil and pour into the flour that has already been mixed with salt. Knead by hand or machine until it's smooth and elastic. You should have a moderate dough (not soft and not firm, in the middle). Don't worry if it's a little sticky. You'll need to roll it out with a little flour.

I like the use of bread maker in this recipe, it cuts the work in half.

The only thing I changed in this recipe was a way of baking the bread. I cooked it in the teflon frying pan on the stove like a pancake, but without any butter or oil. I rolled the bread into 4-5 mm thick circles and cooked each side for about 1 min or so until there were small lightly brown circles on both sides ,(heat knob turned half way). 
They were 1000 times better then the ones u buy from the shops and whole family loved them.

I have never made pita bread before, and was very impressed with how well it turned out. As I do not have a bread machine, I had to do it by hand by first proofing the yeast with the water and sugar for 10 minutes,then adding the rest together and kneading until smooth, letting it rise for about 1 1/2 hours, until it doubled, then continuing with the rest of the instructions. I did not need to add any more or less flour as with most other bread recipes. It was beautiful!! I also added about 1 tsp of dill weed and some cumin seeds during mixing. It puffed up perfectly in the oven, and I had no problems with it being too hard or crusty. I used the pitas to make falafels, and the finished product was amazing!! I would definately recommend this recipe.

I have made this recipe a few times now.  I use half whole wheat flour and half all purpose flour.  My husband prefers the taste of these to the store bought brands, even though the first batch were hard as rocks.  I have two main suggestions.  First bake the pitas with a bowl of water on the bottom rack.    Second, place pitas immediately in a paper bag, covering with a towel does not work.  The second batch turned out soft and wonderful.

I'm THRILLED w/ these pitas! Just made them this morning and had friends over for lunch and we enjoyed tuna salad in them. I replaced applesauce for oil, 1 pkt of equal for sugar and used 50% whole wheat flour and 50% bread flour for the 3 C. of regular flour called for! They are FANTASTIC! I think I might even make a 2nd batch this afternoon! THANK YOU FOR A GREAT RECIPE! - Sharon

Great recipe! Both me and my hubby loved it. It's the first recipe I tried where the pockets could actually hold anything inside. Much better than store bought. I brushed some olive oil on a few of them before baking and it gave them a nice golden color and a unique taste.

Very good pitas! Per others, I added an extra tsp of salt but now wished I wouldn't have...I personally didn't think it needed it esspecially since I added a tsp of onion powder. I don't have a breadmaker so I disolved the yeast in warm water, added the remaining ingrediants and mixed and kneaded for apprx 8 min (or until it felt right). I let it rise for 1.5 hours (until dough had doubled in size) and then followed the recipe per instructed. My oven produced 8 beautiful pitas that are pretty tasty and were easy to make. Just as good as store bought! I used these for "Pork Sausage & Cabbage Pitas" from this site and lunch yesterday was delicious! Thanks Sandy!

These are unreal! i just have some things to add that will make this a lot easier. Firstly i put all the dry ingredients(including the yeast and pure whole wheat flour)in my kitchenaid bowl and mixed it with a spoon. Than i added the wet ingredients, and i let everything run on slow until the dough was formed. i  let it rise for 1 hour, formed the balls to pancake shaped discs. Put them on a REGULAR COOKIE SHEET WITH PARCHMENT PAPER, and let them rise for 1/2 hour. i than put them in a 500 degree oven for 4 minutes, wrapped them in a regular kitchen towel(no brown bag handy),and removed them after 10 minutes.They were perfect!!!!!

Very good! Relatively easy to make, though a *little* time consuming. I added 1 cup whole wheat flour and cut the all purpose flour to 2 cups. They were tasty and puffed up nicely. My kids love 'em so this is a keeper!

This was a very easy and good recipe.  It was great tasting.  I did increase the salt to 2 tsp. I made mini gourmet pizzas using it as a crust.  I brushed the pita with olive oil and topped it with some canned Italian style tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, feta cheese and chopped green onion and broiled it for several minutes.  What a great tasting pita pizza!  I will definately make this again!

I am eating it as I type, and I still can't believe it. I. Made. Pita bread. Me. The most baking-challenged person I know. And it's awesome. Thank you just doesn't cover it. I will never buy pita bread again. Well...except maybe from that nice Pakistani family at the farmer's market. But only them. Because I can make my own! Whoo-hoo!   I subbed a cup of whole wheat flour for one of the cups of AP flour, and I think next time I'll go 50/50. So good. I seriously can't believe I just made pita bread! :D

After reading the reviews, I doubled the salt.  I also added 1 tsp garlic powder. Mine did not puff up that much before baking, but they still taste good.  I also split the flour into half wheat/half white.

Wow! This recipe is fantastic! After reading several sad online blogs about pitas that wouldn't puff I must admit I was nervous about trying this recipe, but in the end they turned out great! I rolled the dough very thin (based on blog recommendations) and then let it rise for 15 minutes in a warm place before putting them in the oven. Next, I placed the pitas directly onto a well-seasoned pan I'd been heating in the oven. I put the pitas back in, tossed a handful of ice cubes onto the oven floor (this keeps the dough soft but not soggy), cooked them for 2-4 minutes and then flipped for another 3 minutes of cooking. They puffed perfectly and turned a beautiful golden brown. When I pulled them out I put them into a sealed brown paper bag until they cooled and kept making new batches. Since I made mine smaller than the recommended size I ended up with about 15-20 six inch pita pockets. I couldn't be happier!

This recipe is amazing!  Made it exactly as written, except I used my KitchenAid.  Combined the yeast with the sugar and water and proofed for about 10  minutes.  Mixed in the oil and salt. Then gradually added the flour in.  Mixed for about 3-4 minutes on speed 2 with the dough hook, then turned out onto a floured counter and kneaded for another 3-4 minutes.  Warmed my oven, turned it off, then placed the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turned to coat, and let rise for about 45 minutes covered with a dish towel.   Rolled out into the rope, divided, and rolled out into the rounds.  Placed damp paper towels warmed in the microwave for about 10 seconds over and let them rise for 30 minutes.  Baked as directed, and when they were done placed the same paper towels (still damp) over them for about 10 minutes to soften.  This is the first time I've made pitas and they turned out great!  It was fun to watch them puff up in the oven!  Store bought doesn't even compare. Will definitely be making these a lot!  For those of you who are having trouble - make sure to proof your yeast and don't overwork the dough.  Also, yeast needs a warm moist environment to activate - so letting the dough rise in a warmed oven and then covered with warm moist paper towels really helps.  Served Swizzlesticks Philly Steak Sandwiches from this site in the pitas (instead of hoagie rolls) and then drizzled with honey for a light dessert.  Delish!

Great recipe.  Make sure you only let the dough rise for 30 min once rolling them out - too little and they will be tough, too long and they won't puff into pockets when baking.

I haven't bought store-bought pita's since I found this recipe a couple years ago. These are so much better than anything you can buy.  I find if you let the dough balls sit for about 5 minutes before rolling them out, they're much easier to roll into a uniform circle.

I thought they were great.  They were quick and yummy! 

Update: I made these again today, and made an observation about why some puff and some don't.  If you don't flour the dough before you leave it to rise for 30 minutes, it may stick to the counter.  If it sticks, it punctures the dough and thus... it doesn't puff.  So just make sure you flour it enough underneath so that it doesn't stick to the counter.  Most of mine puffed and they are absolutely YUMMY again!

I followed the recipe exactly except I used Quarry tile instead of the wire cake rack. You can buy quarry tile from any home improvement store for 50 cents a tile. Cooked at 425 also, but if you want a crisper bottom then cook on 450 or 500.

I had everything I needed to make gyros except the pita bread.  With gasoline costing over $3 per gallon, I decided to make the bread rather than take the 30 mile round trip to my nearest grocery.  I did not use my bread machine and halved the recipe; it turned out WONDERFUL!  I highly recommend this recipe.

This is a great base recipe.  I use whole wheat flour for everything so I added just a pinch more yeast and sugar to get a good rise.  I also had to let my dough sit longer to double, that's the nature of whole wheat.  I added a few shakes of garlic powder and paprika to the flour before adding the proofed sugar/yeast/water.  The pita turned out fantastic.  A tip on rising bread dough.  Before you begin mixing ingredients, turn your oven to 180.  As soon as it reaches temp, turn it off. then begin mixing and you will have a great space to rise the dough.

I'm from Israel and a good pita is a MUST! I read a bunch of Israeli websites and tried to get that "home" style pita I'm used to.
Things I changed according to other websites: I added a bit more water. The dough should be very sticky. I added more flour when I worked with it, but that was mostly for my hands. I used the whole (or almost the whole) packet of the dry active yeasts. Let it rise for 1.5 hours, then made balls and let these rise for 40 min. 
The biggest difference I found that the best pitas were the one i just flattened with my hands and didn't use the roll pin. 
Real pitas have to be "meaty" and have a lot of dough and not thin :)
good luck!

I mixed the water and sugar, and bloomed the yeast in it for 10 minutes. Then I mixed the other three ingredients with the yeast mixture in my dough-hook-equipped stand mixer for about five minutes. I kneaded the dough for maybe five minutes, put it in a greased bowl, covered it, and let it rise for maybe an hour. Then I started on step two... Okay, I'll admit that I had my doubts, looking at the pita rounds not rising at all (I put them in a warm, just above room temperature, oven to rise). I muttered, I glared, I paced. And then, after an extra 10 minutes (40 minutes total), they started to puff up! Yay! But for my oven, which usually runs cool, 500 degrees was too hot. I had to lower it to 475, and 450 might even be better in the future. They puffed up and looked like regular pitas! Woo hoo! I tip: If there's too much flour clinging to the pitas, use a pastry brush to remove it gently before baking or with a little more vigor after. Thanks, Sandy, I just hope they taste as good as they look! :)

VERY GOOD MY FIRST PITA BREAD, if you don't have bread machine just mix them by hand . don't overwork them so all will puff up evenly. rest for 40-1 hour till double in size. roll then not to thinly or to thick , just about half centimeter. most important put ice cube under it and a bit water so the steam are evenly. ( this will make it soft and puff up evenly ) . the first batch i only cover them with towel but not working too well ( esp if you them in oven too long ) for the second batch i put them in a container line with clean damp kitchen towel , put the bread cover with the rest of the towel the close the container, the steam will make them soft.

I thought these were absolutely wonderful.  After experimenting with several batches, the only changes I would make would be towards rising & baking methods.  My favorite is to bake @ 425 on a preheated stone for 4 minutes.  I did spritz the oven walls with water prior to baking.  Oh.  And for rising, either set to rise on parchment paper OR use lightly floured wax paper.  Some stuck like crazy and deflated the slight rise (but still tasted delish).  I think original ingredient are just fine, but favorite is to sub in 1 cup of whole wheat flour for 1 of the all purpose.  Thanks so much for recipe.

Very good recipe for beginners.  I use my kitchen center to knead the dough.  Anyone has experience hand kneading this recipe will work for them too.  

I have tried using the following combinations: 1) all unbleached flour; 2) 1 cup whole wheat + 2 cups unbleached; 3) 1.5 cups whole wheat + 1.5 cups unbleached.  They all worked out very well. 

Depends on the type of flour I use, I adjust the amount of water in the recipe.  I like to make the dough a bit softer than that for regular sandwich loaf.  

Once the dough is doubled, I punch down, divide the dough into equal parts.  It's very important to let the dough pieces relax for 5 - 10 minutes before rolling them out or they will resist the stretch and keep pulling back.  I like my pita pockets thin so I roll them as thin as possible.

Then I dust the flat dough rounds with a bit extra flour, lift the piece and, at the same time, stretch around the edge before flipping it over, then dust more flour on top.

Dusting the dough goes a long way.  It makes handling the final dough a much easier task.  Since I make my dough a bit softer than my regular loaf, using a bit flour for dusting doesn't make the dough dry, and I never have problems moving them onto a cooling rack for baking.  I covered my rounds and let sit for 30 minutes (they don't rise a lot) then bake them at 500 for 4 minutes only.  Turns out perfectly every time.

Amazing recipe.  They didnt rise much under a towel so i put then in the oven and they puffed up perfectly.  I had to add more water to the recipe than was suggested.

I'm not an expert at making breads from scratch so maybe that was my problem. We loved the recipe "Chicken Tikki Tenders" from this site so much that my boyfriend requests them regularly now. I thought I'd try to make my own pitas to serve them in. I added some garlic powder so the taste wasn't too bad but I couldn't get over the denser texture. I think I'll stick to buying my pitas. Thanks anyways.

Wonderful recipe! I switched out a cup of white flour for whole wheat flour and it still worked very well.  These are the perfect pita texture but still able to hold a lot of filling.  I love this website.  It has turned me from a cold cereal n toast eating scaredy-cook into a cooking thrill seeker.  I now love to cook thanks to this joint :)

Great, tasty and EASY recipe.  Next time I might add a bit more salt, and I would also experiment by adding herbs or even dried onion or in the dough for some extra kick.

This is my new pita recipe! Perfect! Don't have a bread machine, so I mixed it in my stand mixer, kneaded with the bread hook for 10 minues and let rise until double. Cooked it on a pizza stone for 4 minutes. yum.

I turned mine into pita chips and took them to a potluck with some hummus (from this site).  They were a huge hit. I made this in my Kitchen Aid.  Started with the water, sugar and yeast.  I let it sit about 5 minutes until the yeast bubbled.  Added the salt, oil (I used herbed olive oil) and flour and used the dough hook to mix.  I only mixed until everything came together and was a smooth ball.  I covered and let rise about 45 minutes - 1 hour. Punched down then rolled out into rounds.  I baked as directed then when cooled I brushed with olive oil, sprinkled with garlic salt, cut into wedges and then re-baked another 4-5 minutes turning about 2/3 of the way through.  AMAZING!

Delicious, and great fun to make.  Made with my 5yo, we enjoyed watching them puff up like a baloon in the oven.

These were delicious, easy, and so much better than store-bought! I put them directly on the oven rack for 5 minutes, then cooled half in damp towl and half in paper bag. They came out the same, so don't stress your cooling method.  Next time I may add in some whole-wheat flour....

What I modified: 1.5 cup of WW and 1.5 Cup AP flours 2 tsp of greek seasoning (p[urchased from Target) and 1/2 tsp extra salt.  They were cooked on a ceramic tile (works the same and cheaper than pizza stone) but did not puff up. I rolled 2 large and the rest thin. The large will  actually work great for gyros (to fold over like tortillas/tacos) the others were small disks which I figured i would probably use them for hummus dipping. This morning as I was about to cut them into triangles, I grabbed a butter knife and carefully made slits and was able to make deep pockets in them. So, they do stay dense in the middle, but it took me about 3-4 mins to make a pocket on one. But it can be done. Next time I will not crowd them on the stone/tile and see if they do better baking in batchs. Baked for 6 mins.

So I found that if you try to pat the dough or stretch it like pizza dough it does not puff up as well - use a rolling pin.  My kids loved it and could't even wait for them to cool before trying :)  I would also reccommend doubling the recipe - you will be disappointed that you ate them all before your husband got home!

Excellent. I've made this recipe twice so far in one week, and both times I've used half whole wheat/half white flour with great success. The first time I rolled out the balls per instructions. The result was great - but I prefer a "breadier," thicker pita. So last night I used the same number of balls - just rolled them out only to the size that I desired. Fantastic! I also decided to roll them out and pop them right in the oven, without waiting the prescribed 30 minutes. Worked like a charm. Couldn't be more pleased. I'll try increasing the wheat flour next as another experiment.

Very easy to make in the bread machine.  I followed the directions to a T but they came out being the most delicious English Muffins I've ever had!  They puffed before I baked them, the puffed more after I baked them, I let them set with a damp towel over them until the were "soft" and cut them open to find no pocket.  I'll use this recipe again but not for pita's!  I'll use it to make home made English Muffins, they're fantastic!!!!

Excellent recipe. I will make these again and again. They puffed up gorgeously, and they turned out so perfect. I used whole wheat flour and flaxseed, and they were great and tasty!

I had to make this without a bread machine, and I thought it turned out very well. I tried letting the dough rise on a wire rack, as suggested by another reviewer, but the dough wound up sinking through the gaps and sticking to the rack. The ones I cooked on my stone pan did much better.  After my first batch came out, I opted to brush olive oil on each pita and sprinkle some Mrs. Dash Garlic Herb blend. The subsequent batches were more golden and had a nice taste like the bread at a local Mediterranean restaurant. Will definitely make again!

I did it!!! I finally managed to make my own pita bread! I failed miserably in my 1st attempt with another pita bread recipe. But this recipe was sooo...easy! I added all the ingredts into my Bread Maker n press Dough setting. Then just practically followed the recipe to the T. Only exception is i reduced the temperature to 420F n bake for 4 mins. It was so fun to see the pita bread rise up like a balloon in the oven. We had these soft n yummy pita bread for dinner tonite with shish tawook grilled chicken ( recipe taken from allrecipes )They made a marvellous combination!! This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Ours came out soft and split but I too had a tough time transferring them to the cake rack.  Make sure that you heavily flour your work area- after they rise they tend to stick and make the move really hard.  Stuck to the recipe as is but added 1/2 tsp onion powder.  Used the towel method to soften pitas and then placed in the bag until dinner time.  Good recipe- the results are worth it!

Just made these, and I've already eaten two before they had the chance to cool! Mmm!

Made the recipe as directed, except for subbing 1/2 whole wheat flour and adding parsley for color. (I love recipes where I get to use my bread machine- such a time saver!)

Since the "oven or stovetop" question seems unresolved, I baked four and cooked the other four (no oil) in a nonstick pan. The verdict: more puffed up using the bake method, BUT the pan method makes a more aethetically pleasing pita.  I even tossed the baked ones into the frying pan for a few seconds just to give them some nice dark brown spots.

Next time I will add a pinch more salt and maybe some onion powder, as they're sort of bland. Definitely a keeper, though!

These turned out very good. I used 1/2 white and 1/2 wheat flour. Baked 4 of them in the oven and cooked the other 4 on my stove top griddle. The ones that were prepared on the griddle took a bit longer and did not puff very well. Softened half in a paper bag and half under a damp towel. Both myself and my husband preferred the griddle/damp cloth pitas even though there was very little pocket. Just folded them over!

Time-consuming, yes. But so very worth it. Where I live, it's hard to have buy healthy baked goods without the dough conditioners. This was great - I subbed half of the AP flour for whole wheat & 1/2 with bread flour cause that's what I had on hand. Without a bread machine, I proofed the yeast for 10 min with the water & sugar. Added the oil in before mixing it into the flour & salt. Kneaded for 8-10 minutes. Set out for about an hour before shaping into rounds. Great texture & flavor. The next time, I'll form into 10 rounds, as they were overly thick when I made eight 6-7" rounds

I found this recipe weeks ago and have been afraid to use it since my bread machine is a sort of scary mysterious guest in my house. But, lo and behold, this bread came out perfect. Not just perfect, but better than the ones they sell at my favorite local deli!! I used half whole wheat and half white,followed the recipe exactly, and my girls and I watched in amazment as the pitas ballooned up into billowy testaments to my bread making abilities!!! I almost sprained my ankle running to my cuisinart to make hummus to eat with my *homemade* pita bread. 
Thanks for the super recipe

Wonderful recipe!  I do not have a bread machine but my pitas came out puffy and delicious.  This is what I did:  Dissolve the yeast in the warm water and mix everything accordingly.  I used bread flour and found that this made the pitas a bit softer (to my preference).  I also added a teaspoon of garlic salt for taste.  I cut up the dough into 8 slices, rolled, and allowed them to rise only slightly (for quicker rising time, pre-heat oven to 200 degreee for 5 mins, turn off, and put the dough in for 10 mins).  Bake for 4-6 mins - be VERY careful taking the pitas out, the steam will come out of the pockets and burn you!  Place in paper bag for 8 mins and enjoy!  Hope this helps...thanks Sandy for the recipe.

I have made this recipe or several years and just love it. There is nothing so satisfing and make anything to do with bread. My kids love them I make a big batch and keep them in the freezer. Great for school lunches. When my children were young it was peanut butter with jam or honey, now it's chicken caesar.

So much better than store bought. The pita bread was pretty simple to make. I watched the video since this was the first time I made pita bread. I followed the advice of other reviews using a Kitchenaid. I did not use all the flour. I started out with 2 cups and added a little at a time until the dough pulled away from the dough hook. The dough will be a bit sticky. I made two batches of this recipe, just to get the feel of the recipe.  I think gently handling these pitas is key. First, I used waxed paper with some flour on the waxed paper to roll out the dough.  I placed the dough on the waxed paper in a long log. Made sure the log was the same thickness. Divided the dough into 8 sections and gently made into balls. I gently pressed the ball into a round shape then gently rolled out the pita into a 6 inch circle. I tried not to overwork the pita.  14 out of the 16 did puff up in the oven. I tried baking 3 at a time and I think that is an issue. So, I baked 2 at time. Next time, I make these I am going to place the pitas on parchment paper to rise the second time. Also, I plan to use a spray bottle in the oven to spritz the pitas. I used a damp cotton towel to soften up the pitas. I did have to rewet the towel to soften up all of the pitas.

I don't understand why people don't make the recipes AS IS before they decide to follow someone else' suggestions?  Why even make a recipe if you wont at least try the original way first?

I made these just a couple of hours ago, and that turned out perfect!  :)  I overcooked a few lol, and those were perfect for dipping in some hummus I just made.  :D  And the soft ones that I didn't almost burn, will be for sandwiches...  lol  I wouldn't change anything in the recipe, it turned out exactly as it said and taste just like pita bread should.  :D

God Bless ~Amy

Will keep this recipe. Added half wheat flour for the all purpose , olive oil and splenda in place of the regular sugar. It was the best pita I ever ate. Thanks for the recipe.

Have made this about 6 times. Perfect every single time. I haven't had one pita not puff up perfectly! Have made with half whole wheat and half bread flour. I do use olive oil instead of vegetable.

Great recipe! These were pretty flat when I put them in the oven and they plumped up just like restaurants! We make these healthier sometimes and use whole wheat. Then we eat them with honey or agave! Yum!

I made the recipe as is.  I had never attempted Pita bread before and I was so pleased with how it turned out!  I will make again with 1/2 wheat flour.  I placed the risen pita's on my oven rack which I took out of the oven while preheating.  Fantastic!! Thank you!

I made several other pita recipes and had trouble making them balloon. All of these ballooned and they taste good. I have tried the recipe with one cup of wheat flour and two cups of white flour and that was good, and I also tried it with fresh basil and oregano out of my garden and they were great.

These turned out great!  I don't have a bread machine so I kneaded and let it rise per another pita recipe.  I subbed 1 cup of wheat flour for 1 cup of white.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  They split nicely, better than the pitas I buy at the supermarket.  I think I'll make my own pitas from now on.  I took off a star because I almost skipped over the recipe when I only saw bread machine instructions.  It would be nice to see instructions with and without a bread machine on this page.

For those of you whose pitas didn't puff - I've made this recipe 3 times. My first 2 times were successful. The 3rd time none of them puffed. I looked at the date on my yeast and it was old. Old yeast will definitely prevent the dough from rising and puffing correctly. However, I was able to salvage a few of them. The ones that were soft enough to work with, I cut them in half. Then, using a sharp knife, I very carefully worked the knife down inside of the pita to split it open. Some of them I could do this with. The others that remained flat and unworkable, I saved them to use for homemade personal-sized pizzas. Just cover them with your favorite pizza sauce and favorite toppings and put them in the oven until hot and the cheese is melted. Very delicious pizza crust! So even the pitas that don't puff can be used for yummy things.

Editing to add one word of mention: DO NOT roll these pitas out on an oiled surface. It will cause them to go flat. I sprayed my table with nonstick cooking spray to prevent the pitas from sticking to the table. I had to throw out the entire batch, they were oily and the dough stretched out horribly when trying to remove them from the table. My next batch I rolled out on a lightly floured surface and they came out perfect.

This is excellent pita bread, but you absolutely must follow the directions for handling the dough. The dough must go through two risings or it won't puff and you must roll, rather than stretch it. I always bake these on a pan dusted with cornmeal, but you can also do them directly on the rack. Put them on a plate immediately after taking them out of the oven, then cover with a towel until cool. Then place in plastic bag.

I had to make this by hand -- was very worried when the dough never actually rose. Turned out great after baking though.

I mixed 2/3 whole wheat flour.

This is a definate 5!!!  Now one of my "standby favorites". If you use one tblsp FRESH yeast and be SURE the oven is well pre-heated they will all puff up. Putting them in a plastic ziploc makes them even chewy-er!! Let cool a bit in paper sack first, till warm to touch. This one is a keeper!!

Excellent pita bread!  I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour and they turned out beautiful.  I did not have a bread machine, so I just let the yeast stand with the sugar & water for 5-10 minutes, made the dough with my kitchenaid, let rise for about 45 minutes and then followed as written. I wasn't expecting them to puff, but they did!

This is not my first time making bread, but my first time with pita bread. Unfortunately, I don't know what went wrong. My pitas didn't split! :(  Tried both methods - in the oven and on the pan. Tasted alright though.

Wow, these are really easy when you let the bread machine do all the work. These are wonderful! They actually have pockets to hold the souvlaki kabobs. Just remove from skewer and mix with green peppers, red onions and tzatziki sauce. Yummy! Thanks for a perfect recipe, Sandy.

I'm still in shock: I just made real, honest-to-goodness pita bread!  This recipe was fun, and easy (especially since I have a bread machine to prep the dough).  I highly recommend this recipe, it doesn't need to be "tweaked" at all!

I'm always skeptical of bread recipes...but this one is perfect.  Tastes just like a restaurant/store bought pita.  Made some yesterday and making more tonight! TIP: For pocketless pitas, just prick some holes in the flattened dough with a fork before putting in the oven.

This pita bread is delicious!
It's hard not to eat the whole batch right as it comes out of the oven.

I substitute whole wheat flour for 1 cup of the white flour, just to add a little whole grain.  It still turns out delish!  I have tried adding more whole wheat than that and the pita turns out very crispy, like pita chips, and loses some of its doughy yumminess but is still tasty.

These were good. I mixed by hand about 5 min. and let rise about 40 min. in a warm place. They came out soft and chewy, perfect. I feel like some taste is missing to make it taste more authentic, but don't know what it is. Don't let them brown. or they will be crispy, not soft.

I really liked this pita bread. It's a pretty easy bread to make. I added garlic powder to the dough, but I didn't like it that much (my family did though:)

I have never made pita, and this was such a great recipe to follow!  I used 1/2 wheat and 1/2 white flour.  I also don't have a bread maker, so I kneaded the dough by hand and let it rest 1 1/2 hours before continueing to step 2.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a solid recipe but I recommend after rolling out the pitas to place them on the racks you will be baking them on to allow them to puff slightly, that way you won't have to handle them again before you put them in the oven.  I made the mistake of leaving them on the counter and when I moved them to the racks for baking they deflated and were pretty much ruined.  They tasted good but did not puff up in the oven and looked really weird.  It is not the recipes' fault though, it was mine!

I used two cups bread flour and one cup whole wheat pastry flour. I mixed the dough (everything but the oil) in my Kitchenaid until a good strong dough had formed (about 12 mins on speed 2), then added olive oil and mixed another 3 mins or so. Let it rise in an oiled bowl at room temp, punched it down, and then covered & refrigerated the dough for several hours because I wasn't ready to bake it yet. I let it come up to room temp, divided the dough into 8 pieces and shaped them into balls (I didn't use the rope technique) and let the dough balls rest, covered, for about ten minutes to let the dough relax before rolling it out. I rolled out the pita rounds, let the dough rise again, and then flattened with my hands again before they went in the oven. Good—although I may cut back on the salt slightly next time.

Thankyou Sandy for a GREAT recipe, my family made me promise never to buy pita bread again, only this recipe. Altho I will try a whole wheat recipe or sub the flour in this with whole wheat. They were better than expected! Made Greek burgers with Tzatziki sauce and stuffed with tomatoes and onions, better than any I've had away from the middle east.

I have made this pita recipe several times now.  I use my baking stone which works well.  One thing I've learned after a few attempts is not to be afraid to get the dish towel pretty wet when you go to cover the bread when it comes out of the oven...if you don't cover them with a damp enough towel then they come out crispy.  We prefer them nice and soft and serve them up warm with homemade hummus.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I have tried 3 other recipes and almost gave up making homemade pitas... until I found this one!  It is AMAZING! I altered the recipe slightly and did not use a bread machine.  I used 2c of AP flour and 1c of whole wheat (all King Arthur brand flour).  I used SAF instant yeast and added 1 heaping tablespoon of potato flour, 1t of easy roll dough improver, 1T of baker’s whole milk powder.  I used my Kitchenaid with dough hook on medium-low speed for 5 minutes then by kneaded by hand another 2.  I rested it in a lightly oiled bowl covered with plastic wrap for 1hr (until doubled) and followed the directions from there.  
I found that they puffed the best when on a cake rack set OVER not ON my baking stone.  When put straight onto the stone they didn't fully puff and was more like a gordita but crispy and browned on the bottom.  The taste was great this way (loved the crispiness) but wouldn't call these pitas when baked directly on a stone.  I want to thank Sandy for posting this gorgeous recipe and for the person who submitted the picture displayed.  That is what caught my eye and made me try just one more recipe for Pitas.  I will never buy store bought again! They keep well when adding the milk powder and potato flour.  We are on day three and they are still pliable and delicious.  After baking, I let mine cool for about 10 minutes (3 of those covered with a damp kitchen towel)  then placed them in a Ziploc bag still slightly warm.  These are amazing, you won’t be disappointe

I was shocked when my batch turned out.  Not because the recipe was inadequate - but because I have little to no faith in any bread recipe the first time I try it.
They turned out wonderfully.  It was like pita magic in my oven.
Oh yeah, and they were delicious.

This is a really nice recipe.  Like others, I substituted 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour for whole wheat flour and the dough turned out beautifully!  I baked the pitas on a pizza stone and they were perfect.  I just finished up a lunch of pita bread stuffed with avocado dressed with olive oil and lemon juice.  Sooo very good!

Wow, these are really good.  I made these to go with the Smoky Chipotle Hummus on this site, and what a delicious lunch!!!  I would definitely use a previous reviewers suggestion of cooking on the stovetop in a non-stick skillet as opposed to baking in the oven.  I tried it both ways and the stovetop is much better (softer and chewier).  LOVE these!!!

Thanks Sandy, for giving us this easy recipe.  I didn't have a cake rack, but dug a wire rack out of an old toaster oven (hmm...I wonder if these would come out as well in a toaster oven??)...so, it took me a little longer to cook all eight pitas, but the end result seems to have been worth it.  I am just letting them soften now, but as a pita bread fan for many years I can tell that the consistency and texture will be just right.  I plan to cut them into wedges and serve with Hummus III from this site, which I also threw together tonight (and it tastes amazing!!) People...Get rid of the chips and dip and try something a lot more healthy. The fat grams are GOOD fat grams!!

IT's MAGIC! You roll out little dough circles, put them in the oven, and they magically seperate into 2 layers to give you the "pocket" of pitas! I do not have a bread machine and rarely make bread. I used another reviewer's suggestion to let the yeast stand with the sugar & water for 5, then mix up the ingredients, then let the dough rise for 45 minutes and go from there. The hardest thing is to roll them into circles, mine looked more like oblong blobs. However, these were REALLY great and everyone loved them.

I thought this was GREAT.. I cooked the pita right on the BBQ!! We rolled the pita up with a filling of Tzatziki sauce, greek & lemon seasoned chicken breasts, green peppers, red onions and cucumber.. VERY DELICIOUS... I rolled one up in parchment paper for my husband.. and they were even better cold the next day!!! thanks for the recipe!!

easy enough.  i didnt follow perfectly, i dont have a bread machine and it has been my experience to put add the yeast to the warm water for a good four minutes with the occasional slow stir before whipping it all together with a wooden spoon.  needed the basic ingredients and amounts, i'm very happy with the outcome.  i made a greek dip and brought the pitas over to a family member's for dinner.  impressed, they wanted to know where we bought them.  whole foods?  fresh market?  nope, naw.  made them and baked them on a cast iron griddle in the oven at 500°.  i shouldnt be so proud, this recipe reads very easy and it was easy to make like that too.  so, many thanks.

I can't get over how EASY and SIMPLE this recipe was! I don't have a bread machine, so I made the dough in the late morning and let it rest (as per someone else's instructions - sugar and yeast in water until foamy (5min) and then combine as per instructions) until it doubled in size. I wasn't ready to make the pita yet so I just left it to sit for a while longer. I pulled it out and separated it as per the instructions and since I was at the cottage and the oven was occupied with potatoes, I did these on the grill! Be sure to oil the grill well and watch as they cook but they were fabulous! Soft and warm and perfect to go with the souvlaki I made! i will NEVER buy pita again!

I'm giving this one 5 stars because it puffed, and the other one I tried didn't.
I have no bread machine.
I let yeast get foamy in warm water in the kitchen aide mixer. 
I let it rise for 45 min in 185 degree oven in kitchen-aid bowl.
Punched down and rolled into circles and baked--didn't do a second rise.
Preheated cake rack on oven rack-- next time will wash cake rack so old oil on it doesn't set off smoke detector.
Let cool under a damp cloth on a cookie sheet.

So easy, so good! No more store bought pita for me. I subbed in 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and used honey instead of sugar. Next time I will try upping whole wheat flour to 1 cup.

I followed this recipe exactly (except for the fact that I didn't use a breadmaker), and I have never had pitas so good.  As is typical for me, I wasn't feeling confident - this being my first attempt at pita bread - but I needn't have feared;  this recipe was easy and yielded 8 absolutely delicious pita rounds, which I gleefully paired with the Hummus III recipe from this site.  Excellent!  Thanks for the recipe. :)

Dough rose beautifully and was a pleasure to work with, but unfortunately failed to rise further after being shaped and did not puff to form a pocket.

Made those without the bread machine and they turned out delicious. Instead of using flour to keep them from sticking I used a little bit of oil and it worked perfectly well. Thank you for the recipe.

I didn't love the flavor of this recipe.  It wasn't anything special.  Just use your own favorite bread dough recipe and follow the instructions on how to make pitas from there.

This took me back to a stay in Israel where I bought wonderful, fresh, pitas off the street for a quarter a piece and ate them plain! This was a great recipe. I will not roll them out as thin next time--they were difficult to slice open without tearing through. Thanks!

Best pita/flatbread/pizza dough recipe yet that I've tried on allrecipes. Came out crispy with air pockets on the first try. I like that the recipe utilizes the oven rather than an (iron) skillet as not limited by pan as to what and how many made - less chance to burn myself too!

This was sooooo much easier than I imagined! I used my Kitchen Aid and dough hook. Proofed the yeast (water, sugar, yeast)  for 15min, added the oil, then the flour and salt. ( I had previously sifted together while yeast was proofing) I used 1.5 cups AP flour and 1.5 cups spelt flour. Used a tortilla press to make them thin and round. :) Turned out wonderful!!!! Will be making these often! Thank you Sandy!!! I really wish I could rate it higher than five stars! ;)

Pretty good...Next time I'll try spritzing them with Olive Oil and throwing them on the Grill for a minute, because they were a little bland as-is. Nice chewy texture though.

So easy, and so much fresher than anything I could have bought at the store.  I liked the way these tasted.  Used them with Gyros burgers, also from this site.

These were delicious, but I made the mistake of rolling the dough out too thin, so the bread didn't rise and separate properly.

Definitely worth the effort - much, much better than any store pita. They hold well for a couple of days, too - we store ours in a plastic bag for sandwiches. The stale pitas can be cut into wedges & baked in the oven at 375 until golden - perfect late night snack (though it's rare that we end up with stales - they usually go quickly!)

The amount of water listed was too much on these. I had to keep adding flour to my bread machine to make it look right. Would probably work with 1 cup of water or even a little less. The dough was pretty tasteless and did not rise well.

Followed instructions using damp tea towels after rolling out, then after baking. They puffed out just like the photo! Added some cumin seeds per a reviewer, here. Fantastic. Thanks, Peppy!

Wonderful pitas! Thank you so much for this recipe, I am on a dairy/soy free diet for my baby and havent had bread in months and I love pitas so I was excited to find this. They are so easy to make. I substituted the veg. oil for canola and I did everything by hand. They taste great, the whole family loves them so much that this is the second time Im making them this week!

This is a great recipe. Very simple and if you follow it as is you will have no problems. I didn't use a bread maker (don't have one, don't want one) and there is really no need for one for this basic recipe. Just remember, pay close attention to your oven, they bake very quick.

These are pretty good! I don't have a bread maker, and am not familiar with the use of yeast, so mine didn't puff up as much as I would have liked. I used 2c whole wheat flour, 1c all purpose flour and they taste pretty good.  Just not as puffy as I would have liked. Not bad for my first baking project in Lord knows how long!

Oh, my goodness! These were so good! Definitely one of the best things that I have made from this site. I didn't make mine in the bread machine, did it by hand, and I kneaded it for about eight minutes. I wasn't sure how they would turn out because on the second rise it didn't go up very much, but once they were in the oven they got huge. It was awesome! My husband was very impressed with how well these turned out, and that is saying a lot. Will definitely make these again, and now there is no need to buy pita bread at the store, which is a nice feeling. Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe, Sandy!

Lovely! Tastes soooo much better than store bought ones. *Make sure you don't roll the dough too flat and place a little flower underneath when they rise.

I've tried several recipes and these were by far the best I've tried.  My daughter ate a couple pieces plain.    I used my kitchenaid using standard bread making techniques and they came out perfect.  The trick is to try to keep them round when rolling them out and to never let the dough fold up onto itself while rolling.

I think the key to getting the pocket is to be careful about the second rise before baking- they should start to puff up quite a bit. I don't bother doing this on the countertop- I do it straight on the cookie rack I cook them on so I am handling them less. If you do it on the countertop, the 'puff' is lost with the transfer. I roll them out pretty thin, and I also mix up the flour, using at least 1 cup of wholemeal as I prefer the flavour.

Followed the directs except I made the dough in my kitchen aid. I let it rise in the bowl for 30 minutes. Then 20 minutes after they were rolled. Really good.

This recipe is terrific! We spent some time in Israel and fell in love with falafel, and this pita bread is just like the fresh stuff we had there--nothing like it in the store. I followed the recipe exactly, and it was great!

I made this almost every week for two years and here is my notes :
1) double the sugar  (1 TBS sugar )
2) I've tried the active dry yeast many times , but the best results that I had is using an instant yeast (used the same amount 1 1/2 tsp instant yeast)
3) I used EVO even when I grease the bowl .
4) I don't have a bread machine so I l Put  the dough in a greased bowl and cover it and leave it in a warm place (some times in the winter  I set the oven on the lowest temperature for 5-10 mins and then turn it off and put  the bowl inside the oven and leave it for almost  30 mins or until it's double in size ).
5)when U roll the dough balls in to circles don't make them very thin or the bread is going to be dry , after rolling the balls to circles I leave them covered with a large piece of cloth  in a well floured surface for almost 20 mins .
6) I've tried to bake them on a cake rack ,but I hated it , I also tried the cookie sheet but the bread didn't puff high and sometimes it'll stuck . the best results I had is using an air bake pizza sheet  (the round one that has holes )  .
7) use the lowest oven rack .

OMG.. I was skeptical before I made these that I wouldn't taste "real" (I used to live in Israel), but they ARE!!  I've been so dissatisfied with the regular pita bread I find in the grocery store.  These are even EASIER if you use the quick rise yeast!  I don't have a bread machine, but who cares because it's even quicker with the quick rise yeast because you only need to prepare with 120 degree water and to let it rise COVERED in a bowl for only 10 minutes before shaping into balls!  I did wait the recommended 30 minutes after rolling them & covering on the counter, but that was only because I made a few mini pizzas first with a few of them (which BTW were AWESOME!!!).  I'm not sure if I would have had to wait the entire 30 minutes though because it's quick-rise yeast. I will make more another time & report back if just an additional 10 minutes covered on the counter worked instead of needing to wait the 30 minutes.  I haven't been this excited about a recipe in YEARS!!!!!!

this was awsome! The only change i made was I fried them instead of baking them. I wanted more ofa flat bread instead of a pocket. I fried them in a TBS. of olive oil in my cast iron skillet till the bubbles browned on then flipped thme over. Removed them and placed them on a paper towel and flattened them down with a plate on top. The only problem i had was i didnt make enough. I filled them with a chicken salad and my boys devoured them. Thank You for this recipe!

Beautiful.  I baked these on my pizza stone which I had preheated in the oven.  So nice!  I also let them rest on the counter with a bit of corn meal.  Compliments to Emma37 on her photographs of the bread... clicked on her other photo's and wow!  What a treat - I gained weight just looking at them!  :)

I have been making these pita's for about two years now. I first got the recipe from my mom who got it from here. I absolutely love this recipe. My husband doesn't really care for the store bought pita's, but he loves these ones. It is such a simple recipe and tastes so great! I make it just as the recipe states! :)

Awesome recipe!  I don't like my bread maker, so I put the water and oil in a bowl, added everything but the flour, then added the flour a 1/2 cup at a time and stirred with a wooden spoon.  I worked in the last half cup or so by kneading, then kneaded for about 10 minutes and put it into an oiled bowl for  about an hour until it doubled.  Then I followed the recipe, except upped the over to 550 and baked them directly on a pizza stone.  I put the baked pitas between two pretty wet tea towels for 15 minutes or so.  The pitas were absolutely wonderful - soft, round and tasty.  I served them with fried donair meat, homemade donair sauce, chopped tomatoes and raw onion.

Time consuming, but so worth it! WAY better than store bought. I followed other reviewers advice and cooked them in a skillet on the stovetop. Ended up with more of a flat bread than a pita, but that was exactly what I was looking for! This was the perfect base for my souvlaki.

These have a wonderful texture and flavor. I wish I could say mine looked as beautiful as Zakiah's but they did not. For me, this is going to take some practice. Made these again with whole wheat flour and am happy to say they were perfect! Puffed up just like the picture.

This recipe was was good, but nothing to write home about. Like others, I don't have a bread machine and had to knead the dough by hand. I had to add more flour to the dough (at least half a cup) b/c it was so sticky. But after the additional flour and some olive oil rubbed on my hands, I was good to go. My results were about 50/50, as far as puffiness goes. Let me first say that none of them were burnt or tasted bad. Only about half of them puffed up like they should; about a quarter didn't puff at all and the remaining quarter puffed in sections. You want to make sure that you at least have an even thickness when you roll it out. Yes, it does sound like common sense. My issue was when I would transfer the dough from its resting spot to the wire rack, it would stretch too thin in  the middle. After a batch or two, I decided to cool my pitas in between two damp cloths- I found that made the both the top and bottom soft. There is nothing outstanding about the flavor, kinda plain (most pita bread is). Adding some spices to the dough might give it a bit more flavor. Regardless, I'm going to make my 'rejects' into pita chips.

Oh my gosh these turned out sooo good!  Perfect.  I followed the recipe to a "T".  They came out puffed up and I stacked them on top of eachother in a paper bag to cool.  Then I slit them open.  Some I filled with honey butter for a tasty dessert, and some I filled with a shredded curry chicken mixture with sour cream.  I used a bread maker for these and I am not kidding, I've never tasted anything better!  I will be making these all the time!

My wife and I really enjoyed this recipe; me more so since I got such a laugh out of watching them puff up in the oven.  

Taste-wise, they were great.  They had a much nicer flavor than the store-bought pitas and generally seem to store better.   They are quite a bit of work, but these are excellent with home-made hummus.

I swapped in a cup of whole wheat flour the second time around and will probably continue to do so.  It seems like adding more would be a bad idea, though, as they do come out a little drier with the substitution.

These were really good pita breads. I don't have a bread machine, so I disolved yeast, sugar, salt in water, added the oil and flour and mixed until it formed a nice dough and left it to rise until double in size. I used half white and half whole wheat flour. I made a double batch and they were gone within a day.

These were good and easy to make - I followed the recipe exactly but cooked them on a sheet pan dusted with corn meal rather than directly on the rack.  They took a couple minutes longer in my oven than it has listed in the recipe.  Also, I think mine came out thicker than they are supposed to be when rolled to 6" diameter.  Most of them tore easily when filled with veggies (but I tend to overstuff), and they crumbled very easily the second day when I used the last one for a PB&J.  Nevertheless, I will make these again, perhaps with some onion or garlic powder for a different flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

This came out perfect the first time, a flop the second.  I used 1 cup whole wheat flour in the first batch, and all white in the second.  The second batch was a little sticky and never "poofed" in the oven.  Will substitute 1 cup whole wheat flour from now on.

I did as several other reviewers did and used wheat flour as well as white flour (1 1/2 cups of each).  I was disappointed that mine didn't rise as well as other reviewers did (no football-sized pitas in my oven) but most did expand and they had a wonderful flavor and texture.  I think that I over-worked the dough so it's probably an error on my part.  Thanks for the recipe Sandy!

This is our daily bread! It's consistently good and very easy. I do as others have written, though, which is to flip the bread to brown both sides evenly.

My kids love this pita bread.  I have made a few changes.  I changed the serving size to 12, use 1/2 cup wheat flour and olive oil instead of vegetable.  My kids use these for sandwiches for school.

3 out of 12 pitas puffed up.  The remaining ones did not, but they were chewy and delicious.  I will use a hot baking stone next time.  I'm sure that was the problem.

Absolutely delicious!  Better than store-bought.  It's just me, so making them all at once wasn't practical.  I refrigerated the dough after it was done in the machine, then rolled out two or three at a time over the next few days.  The dough held up great, and I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe!  Thanks!

What an easy and delicious recipe! I made these to go with a grilled chicken caesar salad and they were perfect! So much more tender than the store-bought variety. I wouldn't change a thing - thanks so much for the recipe.

It is nice to finally have a good recipe for "real" pita bread as opposed to the thin, rather tasteless version you typically find in the stores.  It is important to use all-purpose flour.  I ran out and used bread flour instead, and, though the results were just as tasty, the pitas didn't pouf enough to form the pocket.  We just folded them in half.  They also freeze very well with no difference in taste or texture.  Thank you for a great recipe!

This was a great recipe that gave me soft chewy pita bread like we get at a Greek restaurant.  I made chicken gyros with them, with tzatziki sauce, and they were amazing.  I used 1 1/2 t salt, and you have to watch the cooking time.  4 minutes was perfect - 5 was too long, while it didn't burn them, they did get really crispy.  I am going to keep this recipe!

This recipe is easy because the bread maker handles much of the work and the second rise and baking times are brief.  I made it with whole wheat bread, adding 1 1/2 teaspoons of gluten for each cup of flour.  It was delicious.  Anne

We really liked these!  This pita tasted sooo much better than what we can buy in the store, and who knew it was so easy to make! I bake them on my pizza stone instead of a cake rack and turned the oven to 450 instead of 500.  I've made it twice so far with good results.  The second batch I forgot to roll the balls out before letting them rise.  After the rising time I realized my mistake, rolled them out, and let them rise again.  I was afraid they wouldn't puff up in the oven after all that, but they still puffed and came out okay!  They're great with Greek salad and for sandwiches.  for lunches or snacking we wrap them individually in a paper towel and microwave for 10-15 seconds.  Very good!

Awesome recipe with the changes noted in the comments. I too made these part whole wheat and cooked them on a very hot cast iron. Also, mixed it in my Kitchenaid. I will NEVER buy pita at the store again!

So good, I made it twice in one week.  Second time was for a family gathering and everybody kept saying it was the best pita bread they had ever tasted (I am Lebanese and my family has eaten A LOT of Pita bread).  I followed the recipe directions exactly and used a bread maker to make the dough. It was actually very easy to do.....the "in between time" was a little time consuming but ABSOLUTELY worth the wait.

This is a very simple, reliable pita recipe.  I didn't use my bread maker, but used my Kitchen Aid stand mixer.  Just a hint...use garlic-infused oil for a little more kick!  
I use a tortilla press to flatten, since it is much faster for me, and I have tiled counters that are hell for rolling anything out on.

I don't have a bread maker and I was rushed for time so I skipped raising it entirely. (lol) I did let them rest for 30 minutes after I had rolled them out (didn't cover them) and they got a little fluffy. Then I baked as directed and threw them out of the oven into a huge paper sack that I would then close up after each batch. The result? PERFECT! I am sure they must be lacking something from missing the rise time but I can't imagine what since they are so perfect. :)

my kids gobbled it up in no time! it's quite tho original, perfect with feta and tomato salad with olives, like you were in Santorini...
I made the dough in the bread machne, it came out a bit sticky so I worked it with flour. Do not worry because it doesn't rise much, all the raising happens inside the oven, so to speak. I was in a hurry, so no brown paper bag and no damp towel either, straight from the oven on the table, but I reckon they didn't suffer for it...

I follow the recipe exactly as written and how it turns out is based on your level of experience making pita bread.  It took me three batches to get the hang of it.  :)  My first batch my pitas puffed but they were baked too long or I had too much flour as they weren't as soft as I would have liked.  My second batch, I rolled them too thin , I let them rise too long (you only need to let them rise for 20 minutes or so) and I didn't flour my surface enough so they stuck to my countertop and it was difficult to transfer to the racks.  My third batch was the most successful of all three from what I have learned from my prior batches.

I only rated it because it won't let me leave it blank. Let's pretend I didn't (hate to rate it when I don't follow it exactly).  So basically when you make it in your KitchenAid, it is perrrrrfect.  The dough is really easy to work with.  I proofed the yeast by adding it to the warm water with the sugar.  I then added the flour and salt with the KitechenAid on number2.    It took like a minute or two to mix the dough.  Then I took it out and kneaded it by hand for a minute.  I then greased the bowl and placed my smooth dough ball inside.  I covered it with plastic wrap and then a towel and placed it in my oven for 1 hr and a half.  I took it out, kneaded it for a few seconds and then rolled it out like a log.  I then cut them (with a knife) into about 14 small chunks; rolled them into balls.  Then rolled them flat w/the rolling pin.  You'll need a bit of flour every time it starts sticking to the pin or board. I covered them with a towel, but not too long, just 10 min and baked them on 425 for about 10 min. Note: When I used White Whole Wheat flour I noticed you will need to sprinkle in a little bit more water during the mixing process.  And it seemed to need a bit less cooking time.  
We really enjoyed and the hubby says its better than store bought.

Wonderful recipe. I did increase the salt to 1 1/2 teaspoon and added 1/4 cup of toasted sesame seeds as I wanted that particular flavor in the pita to go along with a curried garbanzo beans dish and the pita's were excellent.

I don't have a bread machine so I made it by hand. Used honey instead of sugar and safflower oil instead of veg oil. I let rise after mixing, used parchment paper on my baking sheets and let them rise on the parchment after rolling out. So FUN to watch them puff up in the oven (through the oven window, with the oven light on). When split there is a perfect pocket inside there. Taste is superior to any store bought pita I've ever eaten (infact, I thought I didn't like pita bread. . .turns out I DO!) Thanks!

This is a fantastic pita recipe! I used whole wheat flour and let them rise only while the oven pre-heated they puffed up great...very happy with them.  I tried brushing the tops with olive oil before baking and they turned out like naan bread....still very tasty.

Fantastic recipe. Had no idea pitas would be so easy.  I used EVOO and will try honey instead of sugar next time as suggested by other reviews.  Proofed my yeast first and didn't use a bread maker - turned out great!

Followed the recipe exactly as written and it came out well. But it did not have the flavor of good pita bread. Next time add just a touch of honey and use EVOO.

These are great! I used honey in place of sugar and half spelt/half a/p flour. I found that they got stale rather quickly, though I suspect it might be the spelt flour. Will try again using just a/p flour.

Dough puffs up like magic.  I cooked the first 2 on a rack and they did not come out right (the funny lines, they stuck, etc) so the rest I just cooked on greased cookie sheets.  They looked perfect!  But not a very ethnic tasting recipe.  Just tasted like regular white bread.

Well who would ever have known how easy pita bread is to make. My wife loves them as I do. I have a batch working away in the bread machine right now. I have a real Greek recipe for humus which I load into the pitas. Stay away from me if you don't like garlic breath. The pita bread is so easy and so good. Thanks Peppy.
I will soon post my humus recipe, easy and good.

These were so easy and so GOOD!  I used7/8 cup of wheat flour and 2 cups of all-purpose white to see how it would turn out.  They were light and delicious with the Tilapia Pitas we made from this site.  I had no idea pitas were so easy to make!  I actually sat and watched the last batch bake in the oven, because I wanted to see how these "bread bubbles" formed.  lol!  This is definitely my go-to recipe for pitas from now on.

Used the ingredients (changed to 2 cups whole wheat, 1 cup reg. flour) list but changed the method. Made the dough as suggested in my bread maker, then used a dumpling press to make my pita shapes. Baked on a baking stone @ 400 for about 17 minutes. Very good. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent recipe, I made only one minor adjustment and used olive oil instead of veg oil.  
I didn't have any brown bags so used zip loc bags for some and covered the others with a damp towel, they all softened lovely!  Will definately make again!  I'm using them to eat these with

Super easy, super success! We all loved it. It tasted so fresh and yummy from my own oven. Won't be buying any more store made ones anymore. Can make this anytime! If you don't want to make so many pitas, you can use leftover dough to make little dinner rolls. It's the same dough recipe. Or can add some sun-dried tomatoes and flaxseeds to make the rolls nice and flavorful. Cool recipe

This is our go-to for pita now! If we have them come out filled in and not hollow, we just pull the soft bread out of the crust and eat it with hummus dip. I actually prefer them to be "wrong" - I get 2 for the price of 1! Pita crusts for my sandwiches, and bread for dipping!

I've been making these all day to use next week at a party I'm attending.  My plan is to cut them into 8ths and serve with various dips and such.  They are actually almost TOO good as my husband is having a hard time keeping himself from eating them.   Instead of baking, I've been frying my pitas in a large cast iron skillet with a little olive oil.  So yummy!!  And if yours don't puff quite right, don't worry about it, they will still taste great.  Just use them as you might a tortilla (i.e. flat or rolled around fillings) instead of as a pocket.

Although this recipe didn't work very well for me, I'm giving it 5 stars because I'm certain the failure was mine. These didn't puff much and the outer edges were like concrete. The dough did come together quickly and easily and the flavor was nice, though. I'd try it again but I'm not sure what I did wrong the first time. :o)

I've been experimenting with these.  I like a more hearty fluffier pita so I have used bread flour with the higher gluten content.  I'm also trying to eat healthier so I tried half bread and half whole wheat flour and next I'm going to try all whole wheat flour with 1 tbl spoon of high gluten flour per cup of whole wheat flour.  So far everything I've tried, the original recipe and my modifications pretty much beat store bought except for one brand of whole wheat pitas which is almost as good and so cheap ($1.24 for pkg of 6) that when I can find them not sold out it's not worth the extra effort to make them myself.  Otherwise I'm extremely happy with this as a base recipe.

easy to follow recipe with minimal ingredients however, some of my pita breads did not puff up, and when I went to cut them, there was no "pocket" so I had to very carefully dig a hole in the center of those that did not puff.  still, great recipe and easy to make, tastes great.  i think next time I will add extra salt per other reviews.

AWESOME!  For what it's worth, I tried the pan method another reviewer described, and it produced more of a flat-bread.  The directions in the original (using the oven) work great for puffed up REAL pita bread.  I found 3 to 3.5 min produced the softest, most foldable.

PERFECT pita bread.  With pockets!  I would cut into less pieces to make pitas bigger.  Also I cooled them in a ziploc bag (sealed) and not paper and that worked fine.  Dont put on lowest shelf in oven unless you dont mind dark underside of pita

These came out perfect although I changed the process a little.  I proofed the yeast in the warm water with the sugar for 10 minutes, then dumped it into the food processor with the remaining ingredients.  The dough came out perfect.  I followed with the directions as given.  They puffed up beautifully in the oven.  Will be making these on a regular basis from now on.  Thank you Sandy.....

Not a bad recipe but definitely not an easy one! For those of us without a bread machine to do all the work: proof your yeast until it gets all foamy before adding to your dry mixture (I added 1 tsp garlic powder to mine). Mix and knead well and let it rise for about 40 minutes, then follow the rest of the recipe. I couldn't get the balls to not stick to my rolling pin so I just did it by hand. They weren't very pretty this way. I also had a hard time transferring them to the baking rack... they didn't stay round at all (more like deformed oblongs). I was pretty mad at this point. The end result was hit and miss. Some I were able to split open but some I were not. Out of all the pita recipes tried, this has definitely brought me the closest! Despite much frustration, I'll keep trying these until it comes out right.

Perfect.  Puffed up the first time I made it, which I had never been able to do with other recipes.  Delicious and easy!

The flavor was fine, but they didn't puff up at all! It'd be helpful it the directions say to not handle the dough very much.

so easy and fun to make - you can also knead by hand for 10 minutes leave until dough doubles in size beat down and follow instructions that follow.  Kids enjoyed watching them pop

Very mild flavor! We had this with hummus and the flavor of the hummus took center stage. Light and flaky. Will definitely make again.

Tasty but diffucult.  It was all going well, til I had to roll it out in circles.  After I muddled through that and they began to rise a little, I had to transfer them to the cake rack.  Well, hello, handling risen dough is not good - they fell and got mis-shaped.  Only about 3 out of 8 actuallyl raised up in the middle completely across while baking.  There must be a better method.  We are not humus eaters, so I am unsure what to do with the ones that are flat.

How proud I was of myself! I made pita! Wow!  I loved looking in the oven and seeing the little flying saucers! The possibilities are endless... and now really are now that I've learned how to make pita for a fraction of the cost of store-bought and oh-so-much more delicious!

This turned out awesome!  They puffed up and were perfect in 4 minutes.  I used fresh ground whole wheat soaked flour for a change, and they were great, even with whole wheat.

I don't have a bread machine, so I proofed the yeast and mixed the ingredients by hand. It only took a few minutes to knead the mixture into a good consistency. My only recommendation is that you don't wait until the pita starts to brown, but that you should take it out before then. The few pitas that started to brown ended up being too dry, even though I put them all under a damp towel after removing them from the oven. The other pitas, which had poofed but weren't brown turned out much better.

I was astonished at how good these came out!!  They weren't really rising very well after I'd rolled them out, so I was skeptical.  But they puffed up well!  I cooled them under a damp towel to soften them - I live at a high, dry area and a paper bag just wasn't cutting it.  I used these with hummus, and they were wonderful!  Also note, if you are mixing by hand, make sure you knead the dough a lot, otherwise they will turn out tough.

This is a fabulous recipe for pitas. As a first time pita baker I think my expectations were met for sure. I have never had luck letting dough rise on the counter top. After the 30 minute rise time, again I didn't see much of a rise so I reverted back to the oven method. Turning the oven on to its lowest temperature, then turning off the heat when reached, the rolled out dough went into the oven with the door left ajar. As has happened in the past, this method makes a world of difference for me. These are delicious and fun to make. I used them in Fatoosh, another fine AR recipe. Thanks for posting such a great recipe.

mmmm yummmy!  other than unlevened Naan bread, i've never attempted a flat bread before. You should've seen my face when i saw these baloons in my oven as I opened it! I didn't have a paper bag, and decided against the towel thanks to another reviewer. I used an insulated cloth shopping bag that zips shut, and just threw a tea towel in the bottom of it! it worked great, and my pita's were moist and delish!

This is a great recipe. First time making pita bread. Turned out great. I never realized how simple it could be. I rolled out and then refrigerated a few unbaked pitas, and baked them the next day, still with good results. Two days later they were still alright (but the quality was definitely inferior). This is going to be my go to recipe for pita.

I thought these were good, but not great.  They were more like bread than pita bread.  I would not let them rise a second time if making again.  I prefer a more authentic type of pita.

I was nervous to make these because a) I don't have a bread machine and b) I always have a terrible time with yeast breads....these, however, turned out great, much to my surprise!  I mixed everthing in my Kitchenaid with a dough hook for about 8 minutes, and I used fast-acting yeast, so there was no need for me to proof.  I wasn't too sure about how long I should let the dough rise, so I let it rest for about an hour, and it pretty much tripled in size (I have a warm kitchen, though).  After that, I followed the directions as stated.  I will definitely be making these again!

This is my first attempt at pita. It was an easy recipe. The rolling out will take practice. I learned not to roll them to thin. The taste is very nice. I  didnt get a puff like those pictured here but I dont think I would want then too. I like to cut them in small triangles and serve with hummas. I would make this again for sure!

These worked exactly as they were supposed to.  I was so excited to see them puffing up in the oven.  My husband said he like them better than the store kind because they aren't dry.  They were great.  We ate them with a greek chicken recipe for the grill & some greek cucumber salad made with yogurt, dill & mint.

I used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 bread flour, steamed them in the paper bag and my husband and son are already asking for me to make more. Unbelievable difference from the store bought! Can't wait to try them with some herbs and spices.

FUN FUN FUN! I had the best day making these. I love pita bread but had never tried to make them myself. I make lots of homemade bread for my family but had never tried this recipe. They were so much fun to see them rise in the oven and puff up. We couldn't wait for these to cool and get soft so we had to eat some while they were still warm. Put spinach, feta cheese, tomatoes, cucumbers in the pockets and topped with a dill sauce of dill/fat-free sour cream and lite mayo. They were totally awesome. I did sub olive oil for the veg oil and salt and sugar substitutes to make these healthier. I made two batches with white flour and then the second batch was with half white flour and half wheat flour. We loved them both but my favorite wast the wheat pitas. I will use this recipe on a regular basis as this is so healthy for you also and the fillings are endless. Can't wait to stuff these with leftover Easter ham salad filling.  Fun!

I decided to make this recipe because of the high reviews, but I've never had or used a cheat-er uh, bread machine before, so I made it the old-fashioned way. I used 2 cups of the flour in the dough and then kneaded the rest in. I used a TBSP of yeast, because that's about what's in a packet, and I will do so again next time. I will definately make this recipe again, however, if I want to make 8 pitas, like the recipe states, I will use one and a half times the recipe so that I will have the size and thickness to make a pocket. As is, this recipe would be good for Gyros, which are folded like a taco and don't need to be thick enough for a pocket. Oh, and I've always made my pitas on a griddle, and these worked great that way too. I did need to cut the slit in the middle, but maybe that's because they were on the thin side.

My husband calls me "Ready Kilo-watt" because of my collection of kitchen gadgets. After messing around with rolling,baking and stove top cooking this recipe many times with excellent results,I cheated. Used a tortilla press with a piece of parchment paper under the ball of dough, made a shelf in my microwave with glasses of warm water to raise the pitas and, since my tortilla press is electric-cooked them on the open surface removing the paper when I flipped them. Beautiful!! Don't you just love multitasking!If you intend to use this recipe a lot, purchasing a cheap aluminum tortilla press(under $15) saves overworking the dough and it makes pockets every time-one press will do you and transferring the pita rounds to the oven or griddle on the parchment paper prevents deflating the raised dough,

This bread has a great yeast flavor with an airy inside that you find in some restaurant dinner rolls & it rivaled pita bread that you find in many restaurants as well; we thought it was excellent.  I must have done something wrong because they didn't soften up much (I used the brown paper bag method referenced in the recipe) and soon the outer crust became very hard with the insides still soft/airy.  The great flavor is still worth it, so if this mishap happens to anyone else who is new at making pita bread, brushing a little water on them & placing them in the microwave for a few seconds will return them to normal.  :)

Awesome!!  some of them didn't puff as much as I would have liked, but I keep my house pretty cool so I assume the just didn't rise enough.  Most of the puffed up like balloons in the oven :)  The only thing I changed was I used 1 cup white flour, and 2 cups stone ground whole wheat, and i used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  This recipe is definitely a keeper :)

The best pita bread recipe around! I am greek and italian and our family loves any kind of Mediterranean food, pita bread being a staple! I made whole wheat pita bread with this recipe as well, just sub. wheat flour in for the regular flour... also I may recommend only using half wheat and half regular for the wheat pitas just to keep the nice consistency needed for the pitas. I also crushed up some garlic and let it sit in some olive oil while the pitas were baking and brushed them with the oil while still hot.. one more thing... put the pitas in a plastic zip-lock bag while still hot to keep moist!

Absolutely delicious! I have made these 5 times in the past 3 weeks! My family loves them!!! I follow the recipe exactly as written. Just make sure not to handle the dough too much when rolling to ensure they bubble up correctly!

This was excellent, I do not have a bread machine and followed the advice of other reviews. I foamed the yeast and used my kitchen aide to do the kneading. I used half whole wheat flour and half bread flour, I also added flax seed and wheat germ which gave it a beautiful color and texture. The pita bread comes out perfect everytime and makes perfect pockets. I also do not have a cake rack just a wire cooling rack which worked well over the oven rack. I have never had store bought pita bread and with this recipe I never will. Thank you so much!

Awesome Pita recipe. Works great every time. Sometimes I form the entire batch into one big round, cook it at 500 until it puffs up, then take it out of the oven, cover with a wet kitchen towel to soften it a little, then use it as a pizza crust.

very easy.  Was a bit disconcerted by the cake rack directions until I realized it is just a kind of cooling rack.  So I used the cooling rack I had to bake the pita breads.  however, they deflated a bit when I transferred them so I think I'll try a regular pan next time.  haven't had a hard time with that when I've made pita before.  it turned out chewey and light.  Thanks!

My daughter informed me the night before that a project was due and she needed Hummus & pitas!  I couldn't go & buy them, so I made them!  Excellent recipe!  Very easy & delicious.  I used Olive Oil, instead of vegetable oil.  We were so excited when they puffed up just like the picture!  Thank you so much.  My daughter a an A! 
Definitely a keeper.

Excellent pita. I think I'll have to improve my skills to make this a perfect pita with shaping and cooking, some of mine are weird shaped because when I picked them up they stretched out of shape, therefore not cooking as evenly as the perfectly round ones. 
They are just like store bought ones if not better and at a fraction of the cost, also easy to make. I think I'll be making pitas from now on.

These just came out of the oven. PERFECT! This is one of the few bread machine recipes I haven't had to alter. I cooked them on a large pizza stone and they came out great! I'm serving them with Sean's Falafel from this site for dinner tonight.. I can't wait! Thanks!!

I just made these for our lunch and they were excellent!!  I was very skeptical at first, but in the oven almost all of my pitas Puffed up nicely.  It was awesome. I will definitely make this again.  I also used half whole wheat and half regular flour.  

Thanks for the recipe!!

I found making these pitas a very difficult experience. I'm not an expert in it, but I have made breads with yeast before that turned out fine. I definately would not advise this recipe for yeast novices. My problem occurred after rolling them out and letting them rise again. It never happened! Then they got extremely sticky so I just quickly threw them in the pan. They did not puff up at all, but in the end they turned out edible and rather ok, more like naan though. However the frustration involved made it not really worth it for me, personally I probably wouldn't make these again.

I was so thrilled to find this recipe! Pita bread is usually expensive and hard to find, but this recipe is easy and cheap! Tip: I have my heat turned down to save money during the winter, which seems to impact the way yeast rises. My solution is to cover everything loosely with an electric blanket and turn it on high. A gentle bit of extra warmth seems to help.

I have to give this only four stars because I DID change the recipe, but it is deceptively easy.  I used some wheat flour, tahini instead of oil, and molasses instead of sugar.  I baked both on a cookie sheet and a wire rack, and the wire rack was hands down the winner.  The cookie sheet ones didn't puff.  Brilliant pita-making technique!

YUMMY!  These are great!  I added 1 tsp minced garlic and 1 tsp of rosemary to my dough and it gave the pitas great flavor.  After they came out of the oven, I brushed them with olive oil.  Recommended recipe!

These were awesome!  Made some Greek chicken to go with tomatoes, onion, feta, olives and cucumber sauce.  We will make these over and over.  Next time I will make these when my little son is home so he can see them puff up!  They were great fun and EASY to make.

This recipe is great, but I recommend using half as much salt and leave a lot longer in the oven so they're not as doughy.

OK, am I the only one who ended up with a big sticky mess on the floured surface?  I think my flour might have been retaining more moisture than everyone else's... Next time I will watch the dough in the bread machine and add extra flour if it doesn't look "doughy" enough. As it was I had to knead in some extra flour which made me nervous...especially since I certainly did not end up with smooth balls in the end. Then these got overcooked very quickly! I had to make them one at a time due to the "rack" issue, and it is hard to see when they are done... So I ended up with 3 of 8 turning out great, 2 of out eight turning out "ok" and 3 others that had to be trashed because they were tough and crispy. So, with a little hard work and luck these can be good. My kids did like the ones that turned out well.

This is great! I don't have a bread maker so I used my standing mixer to knead the dough. Then I let it rise. It turned out wonderfully. I will make it often.

Excellent!  As suggested by other reviewers, I used 1/2 wheat and 1/2 bread.  These turned out great.  I tried both the bag and the towel method once the bread came out of the oven and I thought the towel method gave me softer results, though both were great.

Easy, delicious and very impressive for friends and family.  Great served with a antipasto salad stuffed into the pockets.

These were so awesome! I was not sure,like many others, if they would rise or not, but they did. Although they did take a little longer to make then I expected. I do not have a bread machine so I just let them rise in little balls for about 10 minutes then rolled them out and baked them. These taste great with eggplant antipasto found on this website!

Great bread! I made this along with a curried chicken salad recipe(on this site, try it!). My bread didn't puff. Don't know what happened, it could have been the yeast I used. Possibly old. This recipe made great flat bread though! I can't wait to try it again. I don't have a bread machine so i made this by hand. A hint...roll your dough out on floured wax paper. That way when you're done just ball the paper up and throw it away.

A couple of my pitas didn't puff up & form a pocket, but most of them did.  This was a WONDERFUL recipe!  The pita was pretty dense, but that's to be expected from homemade breads in any case.  Store-bought breads tend to be lighter because additional gluten & lecithin is added to make them seem that way--homemade breads will almost always be denser.  So these pitas turned out exactly as expected.  The only problem is that they disappeared too quickly!  I used whole wheat flour instead of white flour, and we finished the entire recipe in less than a day!

Perfect! The kids got a kick out of watching them balloon up in the oven. I used whole wheat flour and honey for sugar. My husband was the envy of the Test House. One man even requested the recipe to take home to his wife!  Thanks so much!

Super easy using the bread machine - and incredibly good.  How fun to be able to make our own pita!  Thanks for the great recipe.  It will be a staple in our home.

Yummy!!  Made these for SuperBowl and pulled pork sandwiches.  I did double the salt and added 1 tsp of onion powder--I'll never use another pita recipe--Soooo Simple and great tasting!  Adding chives and garlic powder is another wonderful twist.

I thought these looked really good and they were tasty, but they definitely needed extra salt.  Next time I'll cook them on the grill with salt and a bit of oil for extra flavor.

I did not have a kitchen towel big enough, so I just covered them with a plastic bag after spraying them with a mist of water.
They are awesome, better flavor than the store bought ones.

the pitas did not rise as they should, and i'll take responsibility for that. perhaps the counter was not as warm as it could have been for the last 30 minute rise before putting in the oven.  as far as texture and taste, they came out fine. some could only be used as an open-faced sandwich but my wife used some as pockets.  i will certainly try again to see if i have better success.

I followed this recipe exactly, and my pitas turned out great! I'm really excited to have found this recipe. I usually buy pita breads at the store, and I find them to be very dry and crumbly. No more store bought pitas for me

I added a little bit more water 1 1/4 cup to 1 1/2 cup maybe because i used Unbleached flour. A trick to make it puff is to heat the baking sheet before putting the dough on it, you might put it in the oven while the oven is heating up. I don't have a bread machine I followed a review to mix the yeast with water and sugar first then I used my kitchenAid (don't knead so much).

I really liked this recipe using the breadmaking machine.  It is actually a fun bread to make because it puffs up. I had no problems handling it or rolling it. I under cooked them on purpose so mine aren't as browned as the photo.  Made a nice baked falafel recipe from this site to go inside.  Nice for Meatless Mondays!  And I have leftover bread for other types of sandwiches as a bonus.

Wow!!  Definitely the keeper!  Used bread maker dough setting.  Instead of baking as bread, I rolled out very thin and cut it in wedges and baked (used air fryer) to make some pita chips.  They were sooo yummy!  The flavor and the texture was right on and I know it would make great pita bread!

I had to make pita bread for a school function hosting 200 people.  This was the first recipe I found and it was a huge success!  Next time, I'm going to try to add a little flavor to it and see what comes of it.

Great recipe! I don't like crispy pitas (I use them for donairs) so I "fry" my pitas in a dry frying pan. They come out soft and fluffy. Awesome to use with Dash's Donair recipe.

This must be an excellent recipe because it turned out perfect for me.  I had been wanting to make pita bread and I am so glad I finally did, and chose this recipe.  I have made this three times in the past week.  I didn't change a thing.  Of course my husband said "What have we been eating; cardboard?"  I won't be buying pita bread anytime soon.  Thank you for sharing your recipe Sandy.

EASY!!  I have never seen such an easy recipe!  I am Greek and I remember my Yaya (greek grandmother) and aunties struggling for hours making the dough for pita's,  kneading the dough,  letting it rise and then worrying if they would rise and be pita's or they would throw the pancake like failures away...  I never wanted to make pita, ever.

Then I saw this recipe - it is EASY, and I mean EASY.  It is no fail - it makes perfect pitas every time and I mean every time!  Everyone I have recommended this recipe to is in shock that it makes perfect pita's so easily.  

I love it,  anyone can make this recipe.  No struggling with a skillet,  just pop them in the oven and BAM!  perfect pitas every time.

Very good and easy to make pita shells.   I proofed my yeast and used a stand mixer, but followed the basic recipe as written.   Will use again.  Thanks.

I just made this tonight for dinner and everyone in the family LOVED it! :)  My 3 and 4 year olds devoured them.  I will be making this again tonight so we can have them on hand for lunches this week.  Out of the 8 I made, only two didn't puff up.  Those two I did put some melted butter on top to see what would happen.  Perhaps that is why they didn't puff up or it could be because they were a little thicker than the rest. Thank you for a great family pleasing recipe.

All of my pitas puffed up nicely and have nice pockets. I didn't follow the instructions to a T though. I let the balls raise for 30 minutes, then rolled them out and let them sit for 15 minutes or so as the oven heated up. I layered the rounds between floured kitchen towels and I didn't have any trouble with the dough sticking. 

I took one star off because the damp towel method of softening the pitas did not work as expected. The only pitas that softened were the ones on the top and bottom. Therefore, I had to keep taking the top and bottom ones out of the stack to let the next set soften. It took a couple hours to soften all eight pitas. Next time I'll layer the baked pitas and damp towels, instead of wrapping a towel around the stack.

I rarely leave reviews, but I had to profess my love for these! Made them many times now, and they come out WONDERFUL... a ton better than supermarket bought, and as good as I've had in some bakeries in Israel! I substitute 50% whole wheat flour now, and they are just as delicious! The pockets come out perfect. So puffy and soft... mmm.

Turned out very well. Tried this recipe with 1 cup whole wheat and 2 cup bread flour and used 1/2 splenda and 1/2 sugar - kneaded the dough in the bread machine - turned out great. Baked it in a toaster oven at 450deg (max) - puffed up beautifully in 7 mins. Tasted delicious.

This was just ok for me.  They did puff up nicely in the oven to make true pita pockets, but they were more bland than plain white bread. I may read through some more reviews to see if folks are adding anything to give them more ooomph.  I would give 5 stars for presentation, but the flavor was so dissapointing.

Not very flavorful, but guess what?  Pita isn't.  Incredibly easy to make - I whip them up quickly to use for kid's lunch.  We do semi-homemade "lunchables" instead of buying that  they call pizza.  Much better to give my son real food!

I LOVE this bread for many, many reasons.  I doubled the batch and I am so glad I did, and yes it bakes in 5 minutes, another great reason right there.  We dipped it in hummus, olive oil, seasoned olive oil, and made mini pizzas--all in one day!  Now I am thinking this bread would be great for calzones since my house smelled like a pizzaria while it baked.  I added a handful of bread dipping seasoning to the dough, ya know the mix of seasoning that the nice Italian restaurants place in the dish with the olive oil. Definately brush with olive oil.  I can't say enough things about this bread! Thank you!

I have to say that as a general rule I stay away from anything that requires the use of a rolling pin, but am very glad I made an exception in this case. It was so good that I had to make another batch the next day! Used it to make gyros and it was perfect. I have also made it with a mixture of whole wheat flour and whole wheat white flour and while not quite as good (for me) it was still excellent. For me the amount of salt was perfect. I will never buy pita bread again.

This turned out perfect. I did add a bit of sesame oil at the end to add a bit of flavor. I made it twice and the second time I over cooked it a bit. Make sure you take them out the second you see any browning. Covering with a damp kitchen towel is also absolutely essential unless you want crunchy pitas.

I agree with other reviewers that these pitas excel far above those you can buy at the store. I've tried baking them as directed in the 500 degree oven and the reviewer-suggested method of cooking in a teflon skillet on the stove. Both methods work, and the stove top is definitely more energy efficient, but it did not produce the nice pockets characteristic of pitas. I will stick to the oven method when at all possible.

Yum! Notes on the cooking: I found them too small for our purpose (gyros) and so ended up combining them into 6 segments, not 12. I tried cooking half of the pitas  on a stovetop (as a reviewer suggested: 1-2 minutes per side in a non-stick pan with no oil) and half in the oven per the recipe. The stove pita bread I cooked at medium-high, after heating the pan for a few mins at high, and made nice, though flatter bread (which could still be bisected as you would expect), while the oven ones puffed up tremendously per some of the photos you can see on the site. My family actually *preferred* the flatter ones (which took much less time and were easy to check for doneness as with a pancake) for gyros--we just put the meat inside and folded them. So I advise anyone to try the stovetop method if you want a flatter "heartier" pita.

Awesome !! It's my first time trying to make pita. I was a little hesitant. However, it was PERFECT and surprisingly easy. Much better than store bought. Next time I won't put the raw dough to close to edges of rack towards the back of the oven. They cooked faster than the rest and had a few brown patches that I caught just in time. Pitas that were baking at the center of rack and towards the front were bakery window worthy.

Have made this recipe several times and my family loves it every time. Thank you. We have never tried to split it to make pita pockets, but somehow the consistency of the bread does not seem like it would work. Not like store bought pita at all. Better tasting, but not as functional.

I took these to work and many people asked me for this recipe.  Great tasting pita bread. Tips: Since I didn't want to take all morning making them, I prepared the dough the night before, up through the step where you roll it out and cut into 8 pieces. I individually wrapped those in plastic wrap loosely and refrigerated over night. The next morning, I quickly rolled them out and popped them in the oven. For those that have trouble with them puffing up, I suggest you handle the dough like you would pie crust dough: refrigerate the dough until chilled, and avoid handling them with your hands as much as possible when rolling them out. I used my marble rolling pin. Also, for a nice flavor, just before baking, I spread the dough on both sides with a light coating of olive oil.

This is a terrific, easy recipe.  The bread comes out so nice and fluffy and soft!  With other recipes, I have had trouble getting actual pockets to form in the bread, but these are perfect every time!  I made the dough and had my Sunday School class roll their own and watch them puff in the oven.  They loved it!!

I don't know why I waited so long to make my own pitas! Seriously, this is SO easy and they turn out great every time. I always use half white AP flour and half wheat bread flour and they are wonderful. Soft, beautiful, healthy. My hubby and 3 young kids (5, 3, 1) devour them as well.

I am honestly amazed how these turned out... the natural pocket that was created was incredible.... not too incredibly difficult to make either... i even kneaded the dough by hand because I made a batch and a half... I am attempting to freeze some of the leftovers for later.... very good and taste like good greek pitas... definately be sure to cover with a damp cloth as soon as they come out of the oven... Great Pitas

Very good pita bread recipe. I did make the following variations: used seasoning salt instead of regular salt to give a little extra kick. I found the oven time took about 15 minutes when putting the bread on a cookie sheet.

Very good recipe! I cut them into pieces after baking & rather than cover them with a damp towel - I left them in the open. I then "peeled" the pieces in two to make "Chips"!!

Absolutely phenomenal.  Even making this without a bread machine was easy.  I proofed the yeast, added oil to the yeast once the yeast was foamy and, with my KitchenAid going, added the yeast mix to the salt and flour.  I didn't work the dough that much and followed the recipe after that.  The flavor is amazing and puts store-bought pitas to shame!  Well worth the labor of love!

Turned out pretty good but stayed pretty hard. They didn't soften very well in the paper bag.

This was my very first time making pita bread, and it came out perfectly! We had ours with roasted garlic tzatziki (recipe also found on this site) and Greek meatballs. I will NEVER buy store-bought pitas again!

I actually had fun making this and it was sooo easy! My daughter loved watching it puff up. Next time, I would like to roll it out to 4.5-5 inches for a little heartier pita. I will not slightly brown it again as it came out crispy and took awhile to soften.

This pita bread is to die for! So easy to make. I substituted 1/2 the white flour for whole wheat and didn't have vegetable oil so I used olive. As per previous reviews, I put a pan of water on the bottom rack of the oven and after the dough had risen I handled it minimally- I got moist and puffy pita breads! I will NEVER buy this from a store again. THANK-YOU!

I love making bread, but won't be making pitas again.  Even using my bread machine, it was too much of a hassle for a marginal product.  My dough was quite sticky, so adding flour and trying to stretch the bread was time consuming.  Then they stuck to the countertop.  When I'd finally gotten them in the oven, parts of the pita didn't bubble up while others did.  After the hours of prep, I was left with half-puffed, semi-hard pieces of bread.  I think I'll spend the $1.99 at the store next time.

Followed recipe exactly.  Dough doesn't rise very much prior to baking.
If you dry fry this in a cast iron on the stove it makes a naan bread. I loved letting it rest in the fridge overnight.

Making it in the oven at 500 makes it puff like pita.  I found that a paper sack wasn't enough moisture to soften the bread.

So tasty so soft bread and so easy, I used 1:2 cup of whole grain flour to all purpose flour and knead the dough with hand for less than 10 mins  I followed the recipe measurements and it turned out wonderfully, I baked them on a non-stick skillet under so high temp, just few seconds on each face and little pressing by wooden spatula and loaves were cooked well and filled up by air exactly like in oven. And kept the remaining in the freezer. I suggest also baking them half baking for fresher taste when storing. My husband Loved them much.

Instead of baking these pitas off in the oven, I took them to the grill outside. They were so good! A great summertime bread to add to a grilled meal.

I still can't believe I made this!  It was so easy and turned out perfect.  I cut the recipe down to 4 pitas and it made that exact amount.  I proofed the yeist for 10 mins, then hand kneaded the dough for about 5 mins, let it rise for 1 hour.  Make sure the circle is totally smooth, with no creases or seams in the dough, which can prevent the pitas from puffing up properly.  I cooked it on the wire cookie rack and put it in a sandwich brown bag when done.  I cut it with meat scissors after about 10-15 mins.  I made Chicken Souvlaki Gyro Style from  allrecipes.com.

Good recipe; I started the pitas on a hot iron skillet and then transferred it to the oven on broil for 1 minute on each side.  It created bubbles and worked well for wrapping.  Next time, I will broil from the start.

These turned out well for me.  They were fluffy and the pocket formed easily.  They were kind of bland but I can always spice them up later.  I didn't have a cooling rack to cook them on so I cooked them on a pizza stone and they turned out great.  They went great with our dinner of khara masala balti chicken.

Very Good Pita Bread!  This was my first time making it and it was super easy.  I used my bread machine on the dough setting and at the end added dried cranberries and orange zest.  The flavor is a nice compliment to the chicken salad I like to put in the Pitas. I also did half whole wheat flour and half all purpose flour.  Only thing, they were a little dry, but was probably something I did.  Next time I may add a smidge more oil and perhaps bake for less time.  Absolutely use the paper bag, only think that softened them.

The taste is good. A yemeni friend taught me to make pita bread: flavor wise I'd give this a 4 compared to hers, but for the ease of using a bread machine I'd give it a 10 LOL. Once you have hand-made pita bread, the store-bought kind is downright disgusting. This is awesome. Thank you! Edit: I think mine could have used a tad bit more flour. Maybe 1/4 to 1/2 cup... it's just a little too sticky still. All other ingredients are perfect.

Awesome pita bread, I got so excited when they puffed up like balloons in the oven, my yeast is a few weeks past its best before date so I was a little nervous about that.  The only reason I've given it 4 stars is I don't like my bread machine so I did it by hand as another reviewer suggested.  A must try.

Excellent, and so much easier than I had expected it to be.  This recipe has been sitting in my recipe box for YEARS and I finally decided to give it a try.  I have been missing out for so long!  I should have tried it ages ago!  My kids oohed and ahhhed and they think I'm amazing.  Next time I will add more garlic.  I added some garlic powder, but would have liked more garlic flavor.

I love it! I made the dough in my Kitchen Aid and then baked them on my pizza stone at 500 degrees. My family is from Israel so I've eaten my fair share of pita and this is FABULOUS!

This is excellent pocket bread! I like whole wheat, so used (2) C whole wheat flour (Bob's Red Mill) and (1) C white bread flour.  Didn't sub oil and sugar because it was minimal, followed directions and turned out great.  Just stuffed with fresh tuna salad...mmmm!

Well, I didn't think I could pull it off...but I did!!  This recipe is perfect!  I did add some garlic powder to the dough to make garlic pitas.  I also put a pyrex bowl full of water on the bottom rack while baking.  Once out of the oven, I left them on a counter under damp towels.  The ones we had at dinner were slightly "crispier" than I had hoped...but the ones I had with leftovers were PERFECT!  I would suggest making them so that they have a few hours to resoften after baking until browned.  Or maybe I'll try to paper bag thing next time.  I didn't have any on hand at the time.  I'll double the batch next time!

This is the ONLY successful attempt I've ever had at making pitas.  I was about to give up until my husband ran into a deer - I made these pitas to serve venison gyros (this site) in.  I'll never be intimidated about making pitas again.  It was fun, easy, and so cool when they puffed in the oven that I had to call for my family to come watch.  The dough was very soft, so I had to make sure to dust it as I rolled it out into circles.  As long as I remembered to do that, it worked perfectly.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

Perfect pita bread. Never having made pitas before, I was a little nervous. But they puffed up nicely, and tasted great.

Terrific. Won't buy from store again. Used the paper bag technique. Using convection it only took 3 minutes on 475. Put in bag for 10 minutes. Cut in half with kitchen scissors and melted butter in cast iron pan and toasted lightly on both sides. Stuffed with chicken, avocado, tomatoes and ranch dressing. Delicious!

This was my first pita and turned out really well. I don't have a bread machine but kneading and proofing isn't so troublesome as it seems to be. I overbaked them a little bit but that was my fault. :) 5 stars, I'll use this recipe for pitas.

Those came out great:D they were gone in no time.The only thing you should note is to flour your work surface very well.some of the dough got stuck after rolling the dough with a rolling pin bec i didn't dust enough and also dust the place you will leave them to rise at(2nd rise) .but the dough was great to work with.Thank you so much for sharing:D

These were so good and too easy to make!  I suggest baking these in the oven and not in a pan like pancakes.  The oven puffs them and creates the pocket!  They were fantastic fresh from the oven with hummus.

Beautiful! Lovely, light, airy texture. I can see myself making these over and over... I just had trouble transferring them from countertop to wire cake rack - they were so deformed by the time I was done :( On the bright side, I'll NEVER pay for over-priced store pitas again!

These pitas turned out great. I have gotten really into pita and hummus and the other day I ran out of store bought pita and decided to make my own. These are better than the store bought ones! I substituted whole wheat flour and they are very hearty and healthy. The second time I made them I put in a squirt of honey to sweeten them a little, very tasty! My sister and I sat on the floor in front of the oven to watch them puff up, so fun!

This worked out very well-I followed the recipe exactly but didn't use a wire rack-I just used the oven rack.  4 minutes was plenty of time in my oven.  Best pita bread recipe I've come across so far!

Fantastic! I used my kitchen aid mixer and baked the pitas on a cookie tray that was lined with parchment paper.  The pita's were soft and tasted delicious!  I will make this recipe again!

Make this! I messed it up but still turned out perfect! I am just shocked I made them! They look amazing and smell yummy. I needed alot so make a double batch but didnt realize it was too much for my bread machine. It got mixed and the rising cycle started, I looked and it wasnt mixed at all, the yeast was still on top! I wanted to save it, so I dumped the whole thing on the counter and mixed it by hand. Then heated the oven for about half minute and turned it off, put the dough in a bowl, covered with towel and stuck it in the warm oven for about an hour. Luckily it doubled in size and I was able to go ahead with the rest of the directions! I did use half whole wheat flour and half white as my sister is very health concious. And used olive oil instead of vegetable, because that's all I had. They are so easy and amazing that I am making a 3rd batch tomorrow even though we only ate one pita from the 2 batches I made today. I'm excited.

Wow, this was so easy to make and it tastes so much better than the ones from the grocery store. Next time I want to try to make it with a blend of whole wheat flour and regular flour.

It was very  easy to make but a half of my batch did not puff up like it should have.  I brushed the tops with olive oil and this may have been the reason why.  I will make it again as I was still able to cut the bread  open.

Yummmm... tasty and delicious. For the reviewer who followed the recipe to the t and ended up with crackers- it probably wasn't the recipe so much as using a bad batch of yeast. It's a living thing, only the stuff that is alive will make the dough poof.

I made these with the intent to make pita chips. I was not disappointed! They were really easy and after using them for a quick lunch sandwich the rest became healthy chips. Yum!

This recipe was perfect! I've tried it before without a machine; it was very puffy and looked just like the pictures. This time I went ahead and used a bread machine, then cooked the pitas on a cookie sheet for 10 minutes (flipping each pita after 5 minutes) They're more like the traditional flat pitas that you buy, but still make much better pockets than others I've tried. Both ways were delicious, and I highly recommend this recipe!

Easy to make and very tasty.  It takes a little practice to figure out how long to leave them in the bag so that you get a pocket.  Even when mine end up pocketless they are still tasty.

Great recipe! One note though: never refrigerate bread. Cooling bread down to fridge temperature will make it go stale immediately. Bread keeps just fine at 70-80 degrees for a few days anyway.

I didn't use the weigh method, I weighed the round pieces.  3 oz each makes 8 pita breads.  I baked some on my pizza stone.  They didn't puff the same as the ones I baked on the cooling rack in the oven.  I put in large brown grocery bag with a towel inside and put a heavy bottle on the end to seal. It was kind of thick.  I might make 10 next time and roll it thinner.  Left it there until dinner was ready.  Served with homemade hummas and greek chicken.

These pitas are amazing!  Heads and tails above store bought.  I followed the recipe exactly and we loved them.  They are light and fluffy.  I used the paper bag method to soften them.  I will definitely make these more.

This is a wonderful, easy pocket bread recipe. I had made one many years ago and it was difficult, time consuming and didn't turn out. This was VERY easy, turned out perfect. The only thing I will do on my next batch (3rd) will be to decrease the water. I had to use quite a bit of flour to roll out the pockets because it was quite moist and sticky. I also weighed rather than rolled and cut since I can't get the portions right. With the above recipe, each pocket should weigh right about 3 ounces. Enjoy! They puff beautifully and are fun to watch in the oven.

I was in a rush when I made this, and I just stumbled upon the recipe.  I didn't realize I needed a breadmaker, but by then I didn't have enough time to find a new recipe.  So, I dissolved the yeast with warm water and sugar, tossed it all together and stuck it in a bowl that was immersed in warm water (to keep it warm).   I let it rise while I cooked the rest of the meal, forgetting about it then periodically giving it a quick knead.  It turned out amazing!  My husband and parents were impressed (all of them good cooks).  I used it as a flatbread base and rubbed it with olive oil and rosemary with mushrooms and stuck it in the oven at 425 (the oven was preheated for a pie, I figured it would do).  It came out beautifully!

first time making pita bread and it turned out fab!  we hate the ones from the store, but i didn't realize how easy it truly was to make, especially when you just throw everything in the breadmaker.  my hubby (whose from Israel) said he loved it and called it "high quality"  i followed the directions (except used olive oil and put in another 1/2 t. salt) and put them on my preheated baking stone at 500 for 4 mins.  perfection!

This was an excellent pita bread recipe.  Even left over, it was soft and tasted great.  Even the dough itself had a good soft feel while preparing it.  It was different from the store bought mainly in the fact that it was actually soft.  The pockets split well (made a pocket) on all except one of the eight.  That was the first one that I made and I think that I worked with the dough too much to try to get it perfectly round.  My whole family kept coming back for more.  Definitely a keeper.  I do think that I might add a tad more salt to the next batch.

Delicious! I made it a few times as written, although I kneaded it by hand instead of using a bread machine. I also tried making it with whole wheat flour (replaced 3/4 c of the flour with whole wheat flour). Both came out delicious. My Persian friend who grew up with pita bread loved it too.

The only problem I had with this which was my own fault entirely was that I baked it too long. Otherwise, very easy and way way better than store bought. I definitely will be making this again.

It's so fun to watch these puff up in the oven. These turned out great and so yummy. Next time I will try with half whole wheat flour.

Best recipe on here for pitas... and I've tried most of them! They are very authentic tasting.  About half of mine puffed all the way up, and those are the ones that tasted the best.  Key there is to make sure the dough is smoothly rolled and handled.  If it stretches too much or tears, it wont puff. Also has to be rolled pretty thin to work right. Highly recommend.

I wasnt crazy about this recipe. I had to add more flour than what the recipe calls for. It worked, but it just didt turn out like a real pita. However, it worked as a great dipper for the hummus!

The dough was more moist than I expected. I mixed it in the kitchenaid and just let it rise in the bowl. Turned it out onto a heavily floured counter and rolled pretty thin --about 8 inch circles. Cooked up perfectly wiht nice pockets. Do make sure, though, not to overcook, and to let them rise after they've been rolled out. I found 4 minutes to be perfect.

made these last night ..my first pita recipe..so easy and so good.i used all white flour and my bread machine on the dough cycle....i didn't have a rack to cook them on so i just put them on a baking sheet timed oven for exactly 5 min and put directly in a container with a lid....side note...while i was letting them sit on the counter after i had rolled them into circles my sweet little 4 yr old put her hand imprint on a couple those didn't rise well while baking because the dough stuck together where the hand was...i had rolled some smaller and some bigger ..some thinner and some thicker they all came out good the thinner ones were thin on both sides..evenly, but the thicker ones were thin on one side and thicker on the other..i don't know if this was because i used a baking sheet instead of a rack or due to the thickness ..next time i will be very careful to handle the dough as little as possible i really think this is the key to making these good ..not to over work the dough..or put you hand print into them...good recipe..

I have to admit I never make breads. I did make this recipe for a party though. We cut them into wedges to serve with hummus. I was suprised how easy they were to make (having borrowed a bread machine!) They were a hit. I'll be making these again for pita pockets. They would also be great with wheat flour and maybe a little honey for variety. Thanks for the recipe!

A very good pita! I probably should have left in the oven longer to get mildly brown but they smelled so good that I couldn't wait! I thought I had enough flour on my counter for the pitas to rest prior to cooking, but they still kind of stuck as others have experienced. Minor issues that don't effect this 5 star rating. I will be serving with Greek Chicken and Easy Greek Cucumber Yogurt Sauce on this site.

I don't think we will ever buy pita bread at the store again!  The kids LOVED to watch them bake and eat them up.  The second time we made this I did not roll the dough as thin as the recipe suggested and liked them much better.  Enjoy!

The resulting bread is incredibly delicious.  I did not have a wire cake rack and had to use a cookie sheet.  Unlike a previous reviewer who had success with this alternative, mine did not "puff" like those pictured.  Hmmm...  I'm going to buy a wire cake rack and attempt the recipe again.  Even if they do not "poof,"  I will continue to make them.  Perhaps my yeast was being difficult....not sure.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe.  500 degrees & damp towel were the big difference from previous (unsuccessful) attempts with other recipes. I didn't use the bread machine... Just made it like white bread, and went from there... Great!

I was pretty impressed! I think that 500 degrees is critical for the pitas to puff up nicely - my oven isn't 100% trusty on the temperature, and I noticed that the last that 2 I baked at a higher temperature puffed more. I'm also going to try tossing in a teensy bit more oil to get a stretchier pita. Great base!

They were great! I didnt have a bread machine so I put the yeast in the warm water and let it rest about threee minutes. Then I added the sugar and salt and finally only 2 1/2 cups of the flour. I kneaded the dough for 15 minutes while adding the remaining flour and let rise in a greased bowl for 1 hr. Then followed the directions starting at rolling it into a rope. Delicious!

Very easy!  I used 2 cups wheat flour and 1 all-purpose - the wheat taste is pretty strong so next time I might try half and half.

LOVE these!  so easy to make; I don't have a bread maker so I proofed the yeast the old-fashioned way (110 deg water with sugar, oil, and yeast for 8 min) and then kneaded in the salt and flour (I used 1c. whole wheat and 2c. AP) with my Kitchen Aid hand mixer.  I made half on the stove top and the other half in the oven on a pizza stone.  both ways worked wonderfully although the oven produced better pockets.  we used the stove top-produced ones for gyros so they were perfect as sandwich breads!  try these!

I don't think I'll ever buy pitas again!  These were fabulous and very easy to make.

I don't have a breadmaker, so I mixed the dough in my food processor and let it rise (till double in size) in my oven next to a pot of hot water.

It is also helpful to note that the circles need to be rolled quite thin.  I didn't do that the first time and ended up with thick pitas.

Some variations I've done...
1.  Replaced 1/2 the flour with whole wheat flour.
2.  Replaced the oil with applesauce.

I like this recipe but changed a lot and I think it turned out better and more favorful.I added 1/2 tsp. onion powder and 1/2 tsp. garlic powder to give it more favor and I think thats what made it so good. I also only used 2 cups all-purpose flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour. Since I don't have a bread machine I dissolved the yeast in the water then added the other ingredients and kneed the dough for about 8 mins. Then let it raise for 45 mins. and then followed the directions by cut the dough and rolling it into 5 in rounds and letting it raise another 30 mins. Instead of baking them I found putting them in a frying pan at medium high heat and cooking them on both sides was easier. They turned out really yummy and I think better than normal pita bread.

I just became a member to rate this recipe. 
It is so easy to make. 
I do not even have a bread machine, and it took me just a few minutes to combine the ingredients, then I knead the dough for a few more minutes, shaped it into a ball, and left it to rise for 30 minutes, and I followed the instructions.
My breads came out perfect.
I put a bowl of boiling water in the oven to keep it moist in there.
It's a fun thing to do with kids, my boys loved watching the bread blowing like a balloon in the oven.
Thank you for sharing this recipe.
Good luck...

This was easy and very good.  Will make again and again. Be careful to watch them while they bake.  Its very easy to overbake. I made the "Real Hummus" from this site and them into hummus sandwiches for lunch using alot of shredded letuce.

This is the second time I made this recipe. The first time the dough did not puff up like in the picture and there was no pocket in the middle. I think I might have overworked the dough and made it more difficult than it actually was. This time they puffed up beautifully and each one had a lovely pocket!  I cooked them at 500 degrees on a pizza stone. Wonderful!

Easy and yummy. I don't use a bread machine either. I've actually found that no oil makes my pitas turn out better, but who knows...
My roommates love these and they disappear quickly. We had them with Sean's Falafel recipe (and Cucumber Sauce which I didn't make) from this site.

These came out pretty good. I used 1 cup of bread flour and 2 cups of whole wheat (that was all the flour I had). I think maybe I should have left them in a warmer place to get "puffy", because nothing really happened until I tried putting a few on top of the warming oven. 
I tried the stove top method of cooking them "like pancakes". It worked very well, except.. the pitas have no pockets! So I have what looks and tastes like naan, which is just fine by me. I'll be making this again!

This made a very nice dough.  I didn't change anything except I made them on the stove top instead of in the oven.  I used just a little coconut oil in the pan.....maybe 1/2 tsp for each pita.  I made gyros with them and they were delicious.

This was beautiful! I did 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 all-purpose flour.  I also did it in my mixer, doing the yeast, water and sugar first, then mixing in the rest.  I got lots of compliments and will use this again and again.  It would make great mini pizza crusts, too.

These are ok, but I didnt' have the success that I was hoping for, but I am not giving up because I know that it was "user error" and not the recipe. I will for sure try this recipe again because I prefer homemade anything over store bought. Thanks!

Very similar to the pita's I had in the middle east, but my technique of rolling them out evenly still needs to be mastered. I would also make the pita's bigger, but that is just a family preference. thanks for sharing!

Great recipe! I did not use my breadmaker, instead I combined the yeast, sugar and water for about 15 minutes, then added them  to the flour, salt and oil and put it in the Kitchenaid with the bread hook for about 5-10 minutes and then let it rise for 1.5 hours. I also put the pitas between two layers of damp paper towels to soften and it worked fine.

This recipe was just was I was looking for!  I don't have a bread machine, so I made it by hand, letting it rise for an hour and a half.  I used half whole wheat flour and a touch more salt. My mother used to always make us fresh pita to take to school for lunch.  It's great for filling with your favorite chicken or egg salad and easy to eat on the go!

I used this recipe for Gyros. Mine did not puff up all the way. I couldn't use the rack I had to cook them on because it said you could not put it in the oven. Instead I used a pizza pan with wholes in it. It worked out fine because I just folded them in half for gyros instead of cutting them open and stuffing them. Good recipe would definitely use again.

I've tried making this recipe a couple of times, but it just seems to be lacking something that is in the pita bread you get at good Middle Eastern restaurants and stores. It is a good imitation, but it is definitely not the original.

Fabulous!  I felt like a true chef!  Don't be afraid to put these in a Zip Loc bag after taking them out of the oven.  If you don't, they will be more like crackers than pita bread.

So awesome! I used my bread machine, but had to knead in a little extra flour w/ my hands even after dough cycle was complete. I was amazed at how easily these pitas split open (to add fillings). Great recipe!

This turned out great.  Fun to make with kids!  One thing I'll do next time is make sure I don't overbake them.  My son (5 yr old) even experimented with rolling some up with cinnamon, sugar and butter and baking at 350 for 15 minutes.  Even those were yummy.

This was fun and easy to make! I substituted White Whole Wheat flour for all of the AP flour and applesauce for the oil. These came out just how I wanted them to - I'll be making them all the time.

I can't believe making pita bread is this easy!  Where we live, it's hard to find pita bread, so I was looking for a recipe that hopefully my three year old could help with.  She loved mixing the dough and rolling it out and was especially excited to eat the finished product!  Thanks for a great recipe!

These turned out just perfect - my sister and I had a blast watching them blow up into football shapes in the oven.  The most fun was eating our own, home-made pita bread!!

The easiest pita bread to make. I used 2c. white flour and 1c. whole wheat flour and it turned out really good.

These turned out perfect. I used 1C. of starter in place of 1/2C. water and 1/2C. of flour and the yeast. I also used 1/2 Whole wheat flour. I did not use a bread machine I let the dough double and kneeded slightly. They were tender and very good. This will go in my recipe book.

This turned out very nice. The dough was easy to work with and separated nicely after it was cooled. This tasted so good. Much better than the packaged pita bread and very easy to make! Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Excellant Recipe! I weighed the dough and divided the weight by 8. Each pita is 3 ounces if you are doing it that way. Mid way through the bake I flipped them for even browning. My husband shunned them saying "I'd rather have the meat, cheese, lettuce, mayo etc on the buns you make", so I stuffed the pockets with left over  beef noodle casserole and off to work he went.........He loved it!

I added 2T of sourdough starter to this just for the taste and I don't own a breadmachine so I made them by hand. They turned out very nicely! I want to add a little whole wheat flour next time. They puffed up perfectly and were excellent to stuff with chicken fajatia and guacamole!

I'm reluctantly giving this four stars.  Only 1 of 8 puffed up and 2 of 8 softened.  But the 2 that were edible tasted great, so I probably did something wrong in the process. I will more than likely be purchasing my pita bread, because this was very time consuming and the end result was a bit disappointing.

Very nice! Used two TBSP instead of oil.  I'm new at this, so my breads had a light coating of flour after I got them out of oven, so I pan fried them in a little oil in very hot pan-- perfectamente!  They split nicely and have great texture.

I made these by hand, but otherwise followed the directions (except for adding 1 tbsp of minced garlic to the dough). After 5 minutes in the oven, my pitas puffed up ENORMOUSLY! They're very tasty, but they look like footballs! This isn't a complaint, just an observation... I wonder what I did differently. My husband and I both burst out laughing upon seeing how huge they'd become. They are, however, crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Thanks for the recipe; no more store-bought pitas for us!

I thought that I would give this try, since getting good pita bread in our area is difficult. I found these to be a little dry, it did have some of the chewy texture found in fresh pita bread. I was more time consuming that I had expected, but I would make them again.

This pita bread came out much better than I expected. Guess I was thinking (in my head) about soggy, bland white-looking pita bread that resembles round white bread I occasionally see at the Supermarket. 

Here's a change for the better I made: in my experience, taking 1/2 the flour and changing it to wheat flour can be too drastic a change, especially since yeast and rising are involved, plus too much wheat flour and you get chewiness. I substituted 1 cup of the white flour for wheat flour. I highly recommend...Perfect! They rose beautifully, gave it a little more consistency and made the pita bread more reminiscent of the kind I grew up on; Israeli and middle-eastern homemade pita bread, slightly crispy on the edges, warm and grainy, the kind you'd find in good establishments.

I would have given it a 5 but I did tweak it some to make it more to my tasting. First instead of using vegetable oil I used olive oil that had garlic sitting in it over night. It infused just a little garlic flavor into the Pitas. Also, I tried baking them, but they always turned out way too crunchy. Instead, I cooked them in a frying pan over medium heat. I did some with olive oil in the pan and some without. The ones cooked in olive oil I patted dry afterwards and they turned out softer than without. Both were softer than the ovenbaked.

I'm not much of a "baker" but these turned out pretty good. I just threw them in the freezer and will use them later to make pizzas. I found that the dough didn't rise when I let it sit for 1/2 hour, at least it didn't rise much. They did however puff right up in the oven. They didn't take too long to make. Good recipe!

Fabulous!!  I had never tried making pita bread before and I was thrilled.  I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 all purpose and added a little more salt and some garlic powder. They came out perfectly (four minutes is just right), but I waited until the next day to write a review to see how they held up for the next day.  Just as delicious!  Thank you, I will use this recipe again and again.

Amazing, easy, and really fun to make.  Impress your friends by putting out some marinated lamb, cucumbers in sauce, lettuce and falafel, then have the pitas baking when they come over for dinner.  Great dinner party idea.

This was an easy and delicious recipe!  So fresh tasting, after what you buy in the store.  I took it to a baby shower, and got raves over it.  Everyone was so impressed that I had made it myself, and I was asked for the recipe several times.  Thanks Sandy!

Thanks!
Great Pita bread.
Simple and easy to prepare.
I altered the recipe by adding a packet of Lipton's freeze dried onion soup.
I add to cloves of minced garlic.
Yummy!

Made it without a breadmaker and still worked out. MY whole family loved them :)
Have now made it over 4 times.  Just a few tips.  Make sure when you place the dough on the tray, that you place the sticky side up, so that it will not stick when baking . My husband likes when it brown on both sides. If this is what your looking for brush only the top side with milk, if you do both sides it will stick (I have tried)

So easy to make! I did half whole wheat, half all purpose, some gluten, garlic powder, and caraway seeds. Made it according to directions, but used the chef John pita directions, as I didn't want to make a mess in my oven. 

My husband already ate 2 as is and claims they are the best pitas he's ever had. I'll definitely make this instead of buying from the store in the future. So much better and more affordable.

Oven baked at 500 for 5 min came out hard and incredible. After time in the paper bag it was better but still stiff. I tried pan frying on high and it turned out great. I'm sure the damp towel would work but I like grilling the bread. No wait time.

I followed this recipe exactly as written, except I shortened the rise times. The pitas puffed up beautifully and split perfectly. I let the dough rise till double in my bread machine, which was only 30 minutes. (My bread machine dough cycle is 1.5 hours.) After rolling out, I let the dough disks rest for 20 minutes then baked for 5 minutes. I think this recipe is my new “go-to” for sandwich bread!

These were wonderful!  First time ever making pitas so I spent the cooking time staring into the oven to be sure nothing burned.  I didn't change a thing about the recipe, just made it as is, and it came out amazing.  This one is a keeper.

I made this for the first time and read through the reviews prior to starting.  Followed the recommendations for using wholewheat flour and increased the yeast by 1/2 tsp.  Found that the dough did not rise while it was supposed to, but when I baked in the oven it came out great and puffed up as it should.  I did not put the pitas in a bag as soon as it was baked and as a result the leftovers became crunchy the following day.  No worries though, as I am going to serve as pita chips.   Thanks for the great recipe and the modifications!!!

Fabulous! I made this as written, using my bread maker, and it turned out great. Easy to follow recipe, simple ingredients and not too time consuming. I will definitely be using this recipe again.

Followed recipe exactly but do not own a bread maker, so proofed the yeast with sugar and 1/4c warm water for about 10 minutes then mixed all ingredients together and kneaded dough until smooth and elastic on lightly floured surface.   Followed remaining instructions and the results were fabulous fresh pitas with nice "pocketability"  :)

This pita was excellent and just as good as that of the high-end restaurants and middle eastern grocery stores. I did not use a bread machine but making the dough took about five minutes. Cooking them was a breeze and the looked, felt and tasted amazing.

Amazing recipe! I'm still in SHOCK that I made pita bread from my kitchen. Since I didn't have a cake rack, I put aluminum foil directly on the over rack. This required about 2 extra minutes of baking (12 total). Also, I did this without a bread machine. Proofed my yeast with 1t sugar and warm water- let it sit for 10 mins. Then mix in with remaining ingredients with your hands. The rest is history!

A General Note to Everyone:

Every so often I see comments here questioning how or in what order to add ingredients to a bread machine.  The key here is to follow the directions that CAME WITH YOUR MACHINE!! Some manufacturers say to put all the liquids in first and then the dry.  Others say to do the opposite.  I'm not sure how the machine knows what to do with them, but my Oster dictates wet items first, so that's what I do.  I've never had a bad loaf yet, and I've been using it for over two years now.

I have made this at least 5 times.  Exactly as written is great. Like some others don't have a bread machine so kitchenaide to the rescue.  I have also made it by hand and it is an easy knead.  The dough is slightly sticky so just added a Tbsp  of flour at a time while mixing until I get the right consistency/texture.  This batch I added a tsp of dried dill, 1/2 tsp of cumin seed and 1 tsp of reconstituted onions (think McD's burger onions).   Turned out great!  Thanks for this awesome recipe.

Holy moly I made my own pitas!! I am in shock, ha. These tasted great! I followed it just like it says. I chose to use the wet towel when they were done. I realized their shape as a circle is key. Will make again! Exciting! Thanks!

As an admitted failure at anything bread, I am thrilled that this worked. I pan fried the pitas and didn't get the puffiness (which is fine for souvlaki wraps) but the taste and texture were amazing. What wasn't used on souvlaki wraps was dipped in tzatziki sauce. Brilliant. Will make again for sure.

Easy to make and absolutely delicious! I don't have a bread machine, so as others have stated, made the dough by hand. 

To soften the bread, I tried two methods, both of which worked. First, I put a slightly damp kitchen towel in a tortilla warmer. I put the hot pita bread in the warmer, wrapping the towel around the bread, and put the lid on. The second method I used was to put a paper towel in the bottom of a gallon-sized Ziploc bag, put the hot pita bread in, and placed a paper towel on top. I then zipped up the bag. This allowed me to "steam" the bread without it getting soggy. 

By the way, I did have one bread that didn't puff up, but since the rest did so perfectly, I'm assuming that's user error on my part, not a problem with the recipe. Since I wasn't able to open it up properly, I just spread a bit of butter on it and ate it while it was still hot. Yum!

These turned out Great.  Followed directions exactly till it came time to put in the oven - used baking sheets with silpats as did not have wire racks.  No problems as they browned on both sides.  I made these for guests and they put the whole meal over the top.  No comparison with store-bought.  I will make again!!

I used a tortilla press lined with a gallon sized ziploc (cut the sides off) instead of rolling out the pitas.  Worked perfectly!

It was pretty good! I changed to 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt and 2 cups flour/1 cup whole wheat flour. I had to cook the pitas for about 10 minutes before they were right. A little more sugar would've tasted better, as they were a bit bland.

Very good pita bread recipe, though I made two changes. I made half the flour whole wheat and cooked on a griddle instead of the oven. It puffs up evenly and nicely and keeps in the freezer well.

Turned out great!  Baked mine directly on the oven rack .  They look like they'll drip over the edge, but don't worry, they puff up quickly.

I made this recipe several times before the pittas came out the way we liked them.   If you use a cooling rack  to cook the pitas, pre-heat the rack.  Also I baked them using the convection feature and it made a huge difference.   I don't use a paper bag.  I place the cooked pitas between two damp dish towels.  Make sure the temp of your oven is exact.  A good oven thermometer is a great investment.  I let mine rise an hour as 30 minutes doesn't do the trick.   And - handle with care.  Make sure you have enough flour on the surface when they are rising so they don't stick.  The less handled the better.  I can't make enough of these!

This recipe makes beautiful and perfectly puffed pita breads with perfect pockets! I don't own a bread machine and only have instant yeast on hand, so I had to deviate from the instructions. I used a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook in order to mix all of the ingredients together (note: I used 2 teaspoons of instant yeast in place of the 1 1/2 teaspoons of active dry yeast). I kneaded the dough on the mixer for approximately five minutes, until smooth. I then formed the dough into a ball and transfered into a lightly oiled bowl and covered with plastic cling wrap. I placed the bowl in a warm place to allow the dough to rest and to double in size, approximately 30 minutes.  I then followed step 2; however, instead of placing the rolled pitas on the countertop, I placed them on a parchment-covered jelly roll pans -- I was able to fit 4 pitas in one half-sheet jelly roll pan. I covered the pitas with plastic cling wrap and allowed them to rest for about 30 minutes, until they were slightly puffy. When they were ready for baking, I simply removed and discarded the plastic covers and popped the jelly roll pans containing the pitas straight into the 500 °F pre-heated oven and baked until the pitas were slightly browned, about 5 minutes. After removing from the oven, I immediately placed the pitas in a large (tall) towel-lined tortilla warmer and closed the lid to allow the steam to soften them a bit. Contrary to some reviews, these pitas are soft and pliable.

I made it without using any kind of bread machine or mixer. I just activated the yeast (with warm water and sugar) first, and then set in a warm place to rise for 1.5 hours. It worked perfectly.

THIS IS AN AWESOME BREAD!! I don't have a bread machine either. I don't even like making bread, but I'll make this one again and again. After reading other reviews I chose to add a dash more salt, substitute 1 cup wheat flour for the white and used extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable. I also brushed my pitas with olive oil prior to frying. Simply wonderful!

Cooked as described and it tasted excellent (used with Dash Donair recipe).
I think I might try cutting it into 6 and still make them 7". 8 rolled to 7" made them just a bit to thin and kids couldn't open the pita without ripping them. Just a little thicker and I think they'd have opened up nicer for them.

Excellent recipe as written. I did it by hand keeping the dough in the bowl the entire time for kneading.. keeping the counters cleaner.  I rolled them out on parchment so I could transfer to pans quicker.  Keep in mind every oven is different so watch them near the end but do it quick or heat leaves oven and affects baking.

This recipe is a staple at my house! Super simple and so delicious. My teenage boys love them. I use about 2/3 a cup of whole wheat flour in place of some of the all purpose flour, but otherwise, I make these just as the recipe describes. Thanks for a great recipe!

This came out Great - soft and delicious, and pretty easy, if you have time.   Heads up -  I put all eight pitas in the oven at one time, and I found the bottoms of the pitas on the lower oven rack started to burn just at the end of the baking time, because they were closest to the heat source.

INCREDIBLE! I missed pita bread so much and now I have a recipe that works and satisfies! Thank you! I'm gluten-free (health-necessity) so using this recipe with a few tweaks allowed me so much happiness that I've missed! Here are my tweaks, thanks to users and my own gf experience: I substituted gluten-free bread flour (has xanthum in it already) for the all-purpose flour. I don't have a bread maker so I proofed dry yeast in warm water with a pinch of sugar until foamy, then added all the ingredients, let it rise for ~1.5 hours, and then followed the rest of the directions. Be extra patient with rolling out: I put each ball onto a floured (same flour) square piece of wax paper to roll it then transferred the rolled out bread to a baking sheet with wax paper on it. I transferred it by picking up the small square after rolling it out and flipping it onto he big sheet with the rest (fit about 4 per a sheet). I was so impressed that a few even got the pocket even though they were gluten-free! This is a miracle recipe! Wish I could give it more stars! Thank you for this life changing recipe!

This is a fantastic recipe! I followed"sixkyej" review and advice and it was so helpful! 
I do not have a bread machine, so I proofed yeast and sugar in a separate bowl, covered with a dishtowel for 15 minutes, while I put flour, salt and vegetable oil in KitchenAid mixer. Once yeast was proofed, I added to KitchenAid and turned on speed 2 for a couple minutes. I then kneaded the dough for a few minutes on a floured surface, and transferred to a bowl which was coated in olive oil, covered with plastic wrap and a dish towel, and transferred to the oven, which I had preheated to 200 degrees while I made the dough, and turned off right before I put the bowl in. After allowing dough to rise for 45 minutes, I rolled dough into a log, divided into 8 pieces and rolled out pitas with rolling pin. I placed on baking sheet which were coated with cooking spray, and covered with plastic wrap and dish towel and allowed to rest for 30 minutes before baking in 500 degree oven for 5 minutes or so (I like my pitas a little more browned.) After removing them from oven, I immediately transferred to paper bag to soften.  These didn't last long at all! I've made them twice in one week!

I thought my pita pockets were a lost cause, but most of 'em popped up in the oven and were delicious!  Didn't give it a 5 star, because several of the pockets didn't rise.

Worked quite well. I tried on stove top and in oven and both worked. The stove top was a bit more difficult because I wasn't sure of the temperature.

Great simple pita/pocket bread recipe.  Cut salt down to 1/4 tsp because of low sodium diet.  Still turned out great.

I follow the recipe closely but do not cook on a wire rack.  I use a cookie sheet on the next to lowest rack.  I keep the oven light on so I can watch them puff out.  In my oven 3 minutes in the first side and 2 minutes on the second side works great.  i coner tgem with a moistened towel for 5 or 10 minutes and put them in the freezer until they are needed. Then I nuke the frozen pita for 60 seconds. If they are too moist, I will put them oin the toaster oven for a minute or so. Great foe felafel, oe cut them into wedges for humus or other dips. Peppy's pita is perfect!

I made this tonight for ground beef gyros and they were fantastic and easy!  I don't have a bread machine, so I let the yeast sit in warm water for 10 minutes, then added the yeast water and oil to the dry ingredients and let that sit while I mixed the ground beef for the gyros.  About 30 minutes after mixing, I separated the dough into equal portions and flattened into 6" circles.  I let them sit for another half an hour while I heated a cast iron pan, and immediately before pulling the gyros from the oven I added a little olive oil to the pan and started cooking them over medium heat.  I cooked them 30 seconds on the first side, flipped them and cooked for about a minute to a minute and a half.  They were easy to make and a lot more delicious and soft than store bought pitas!  Thank you for posting this recipe!

The best!....I was very nervous about placing the pita on a cake cooling rack before putting in the oven......genius! I bought a rack for very little money in Wilko, thought hey ho! and cooked two in my aga. Oh boy...did these bad boys puff up?! I was so impressed. 
Thank you so much for a fab recipe.

Delicious. I didn't have cooling racks so I cooked on stainless steel cookie sheets and they came out fine. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.

Great! In response to the person who said a damp towel didn't work for them, try doubling them up. Worked great for me! Recipe does have denser bread than the store-bought stuff, but it's good. I'm also thinking of the chemicals i'm probably saving myself. Thanks for the recipe, Peppy/Sandy!!

Yummy bread, but I would not call it pita.  I think this is more along the lines of naan or pizza crust.  Will make again as such!

These are great. I have made them twice now, and they are easy and delicious. I don't have a bread machine, so I just mixed all the ingredients together in a mixing bowl, turned the dough onto a board and kneaded it until it was a soft dough. Then I put it in a greased bowl to rise about an hour and a half. After that I followed the directions, except I don't have a wire cake rack so I baked them on a cookie sheet dusted generously with flour. That worked fine and they didn't stick to the cookie sheet. I just dusted off the extra flour when they were done. We ate them with homemade hummus, veggies and goat cheese. Yum!

For  SBDEVENEY who used splenda instead of sugar and the recipe still worked, I am surprised.  The sugar is not in the recipe for you, the sugar is in the recipe for the yeast.  Sugar feeds the yeast so that it rises.  I am very anxious to try this recipe myself, but thought I would warn others who are looking for guidance and pick hers to read.

Pretty straight forward directions. I followed all ingredients but instead of doing them in the oven I just heated a skillet and cooked them that way. The first one didn't puff up but I blame that on me not being very patient, all the rest came out beautifully. I also made some hummus with a recipe on here that called for no tahini and it came out delicious. I filled the pita pockets with some hummus and sliced tomato and they were to die for. I'll definitely making this again.

Instructions and video were so easy to follow.  I did use bread flour instead of all-purpose flour and they still came out.  I only cooked for 4 mins, like mine on the softer lighter side.  I did cook some for 5-6 mins and it was too long because they came out too dry and they became brittle quickly.  I suggest you follow the instructions to the tee.  Putting in a bag and sealing them is very important because if not they wont stay soft.

Family loved, loved them.  I will no longer buy them at the supermarket.  Thank you so much for this recipe.

These were great!  Very puffy and very tasty.  Mine did not come out very big, so I think next time I will roll them a bit thinner before baking, and also maybe make fewer than 8 per batch.  We will definitely make these again though!

NICE!  I found this recipe when I realized I was at home and didn't have bread for lunch the next day and was 30 miles from a grocery store.  I googled "bread machine pita" and pow! I followed the recipe (mostly) and did add 1 1/2 cups wheat flour to make it healthier along with adding honey in place of white sugar.  I tried it on the griddle like one user suggested, but mine only goes to 400 degrees.  Didn't work as well.  Put them in a 500 degree oven and they came out PERFECT!  I love the way they taste, love the fact that they are more natural and I didn't have to get in the car and drive to get them!  Thanks for posting the recipe.  Never buying pitas at the store again.

Enjoyed this as written, but made some changes to suit our tastes. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and subbed 1/4 flaxseed for the A/P flour and subbed a cup of wheat flour for the a/p flour. These were delicious toasted with hummus. Mmmmmm.

I made these because I had seen them made into pizza and it looked delicious.  After they were all gone my brother came to me and said, "when are you going to make them again?"  I really enjoyed them and they tasted great.

This is a perfect recipe for pizza dough! Thin and crispy.  I make it all the time.  We prefer this to take out.  Take it out of the machine when done and roll out two large pizzas. Top as desired and bake for 13-18 minutes at 425F. I brush some garlic butter on the crust before i bake as well.  Was delicious as pita bread too. One of the few recipes I did not need to alter.

Made these in my bread maker on the dough setting no trouble at all. They were just the thing to go with the Greek salad. I will say the hardest part was rolling them out they need to be as thin as they can be. I painted a mixture of garlic powder and olive oil on each side as I fried them. I think they would have done just as well in the oven which I'll try next time. They are great so much better than store bought.

Easy! And OMG, home made pitas!!! I cooked them on a pizza stone 4 minutes. I had no paper bags, so I just used a spray bottle and spayed them with water and then then covered them with a dry towel.

Tasty tasty tasty bread. I have made this at least a dozen times. I don't use a bread machine. Mix warm water with yeast - set for a few minutes. Mix rest ingredients in. Put in slightly warm oven for 30. Follow rest of recipe. I don't have  wire rack but do use the boil pan. 500 for 6 minutes. I end up with puffy tasty bread almost every time

Loved this pita bread!  It actually puffed in the oven unlike others I have tried!  Substituted mostly whole wheat flour except for a 2 cups white and they still turned out soft!  No more store bought pitas for our family!!!

This recipe turned out VERY well.  Took a bit longer than planned, but very tasty.  I stuffed some with pizza filling and had a couple left over.  Left them in a Ziploc and microwaved and the pitas were so soft!

Although mine didn't puff up a giant hole in the middle, it tastes great. It puffed up little bubbles, but not as a giant mass. Great recipe, simple and easy to make. I put a bit of olive oil on the rolled out dough before I baked it. They took about 5 minutes to brown nicely. I love the texture of the bread, slightly crisp, with a soft bready center.

Using a bread machine really cuts down on the work. I proofed the yeast first using 1C warm water & 2 tbsp organic sugar. I went with 1 1/2C bread flour & 1 1/2C AP flour, 1/4C veg oil, & a tbsp salt. After the dough is mixed, I let it rise then punch it down in the bread machine & let it rise again. Following the directions from there, I shaped it into a log, cut into 8 pieces, rolled into balls & let rest for approx 10 min. Then I rolled each flat, as thin as possible, covered with a towel & let rest for 30 min.

I placed a pie tin full of water on the bottom rack & used a baking sheet, turned over so the flat side is up, & pre-heated the oven to 500. I sprinkled a little water on the pan & cook 2 at a time. After roughly 3-4 min (when it puffs & the tops are starting to lightly brown), I flip over & cook for about another 2 min, then place in a brown paper bag.

Turned out great & the pitas were soft. I've found the key is to try not to overwork the dough & to not overcook. I'll definitely continue using this recipe, with a few slight modifications. Main reason I gave it 4 stars & not 5 is I don't see how using a cake rack would work without the dough sagging between the wires and/or coming out without having wire marks.

It's okay, but not great.  Not the flavour I was looking for at all.  It comes out with a run of the mill white bread flavour, which I didn't feel was worth the effort overall.

tasted okay, like a pita should taste, but instructions were slightly confusing for someone that has not done this type of bread before.  If one doesn't have a wire rack, what else can someone use?  I had not rolled them out and had skipped that part until the final two, I stretched it slightly, not seeing that it should have been done before rising.  I guess I have learned my lesson and will remember it next time.

This recipe for pita bread is great! Although I would suggest telling everyone to mix the ingredients together before putting them in the bread pan...the less experienced bread makers (like myself, LOL) will probably think they don't need to do that and end up with...sand... :)

These turn out so good every time!  I use 2 cups unbleached and 1 cup whole wheat flour.  These pitas are very easy to make and they are so much better than anything you can buy.  If you love pita bread, you will love these!

I read all of the reviews before I attempted this one...I am just learning to bake leavened breads. Even after much research, my dough refused to rise. I proofed the yeast with water at 110 degrees, used a 40/60 ratio of whole wheat to white flour, measured precisely and kneaded for 9 minutes. I really don't know why it wouldn't rise. I will try again, though...the idea of baking pitas at home is well worth the trial and error until I get it right. (My rating is based on my finished product, not the recipe itself).

All the rave reviews are true, this works! Like many others I went for half whole wheat, I also added sesame seeds. Advice like letting the dough rise on your baking sheet of choice was spot on. I did not have a bread maker or mixer, just a wooden spoon and a bowl. Go for it!! Mine did not puff but still had pocket, I took them out a tad early I think, was scared they'd get overdone. Toasted perfectly in the morning, like out of the oven! This is mine forever!

FANTASTIC!!!!  I've been making these for almost 6 months now and I still marvel at this recipe!  I make it by hand with a 1/4 cup of whole-wheat flour substituted.

Very nice. I used half white flour, half whole wheat. A little on the bland side, might add more salt or spices next time.

These were easy to make, but they weren't quite what I expected.  As another reviewer noted, it seemed more suited for pizza dough than pita, and I may try it for that.

Very good and easy! Great using Venison Gyros recipe from this site with my own tzatziki sauce. This pita can be used for any filling. They are great on flavor and texture. My son even ate one plain!

So the flavor of these was really good but I had an awful time getting mine from the counter top to the oven and then my pita dough started falling through the cracks of the racks.. did 1/2 this way and then did the rest on the stove top, which worked much better for me although a pocket didn't form. Will try again soon though!

I have made this recipe twice and I'm getting better at it!  The first time I followed the directions exactly and while it puffed great, it was a little tough. I don't fault the recipe. I think it was my lack of experience. I made the again today and this time I used bread flour. I also cooked them on the stove top. This time I didn't get a puff but there is a pocket and the bread is soft and delicious. I have to drive across town to get good pita bread so I'm so excited to be able to make it at home now! Thanks!

These were good. We put leftover grilled chicken, cheese and portabella mushrooms in them. I increased the salt to 1 1/2 tsp. I wrapped them in a damp towel and they stayed soft then I put the leftover in a ziploc bag and had a good breakfast pita. Thanks

This made great pocket bread. Tasted better as a pizza crust than pita. I will make this again for pizza crust or dinner rolls but not specifically for pita bread.

This is the best recipe! I also used my kitchen aid stand mixer, leaving the dough a little sticky in the end. I let it rise for 45 minutes to an hour and then rolled out the dough. My first batch was so-so, but the next 3 were awesome! I did substitute half wheat flour. This will be a staple in our house. Sandwiches will be back in style at our house!

I made them the original way and they were good, then made them substituting 2 cups of whole wheat flour for 2 of the cups of white flour, and 3 Tbsp of flax seed for the oil. They are delicious! It's been 3 days and they're still soft and chewy.

Wow.  I am speechless.  This was the easiest recipe ever.  Turned out wonderful!  I made gyros.  Boy did making these pitas, instead of using store bought kick it up a notch.  I will definitely keep this in my recipe box!

Yum!!!  Mine didn't puff up like it was supposed to :(  I'll keep trying though.  I don't have a wire cake rack and have actually never heard of one so I used a cookie sheet with parchment on it.  I'll keep my eye out for one of those wire pans though.  Thanks!

These came out great!  I baked them on a cookie sheet for 4 minutes then turned them over for another 1-2 min.  Out of the oven I flattened them with a spatula and placed them in a gallon ziploc to soften.  My family loved them!

I made this with entirely whole wheat flour and replaced the sugar with agave nectar.  DELICIOUS! And they puffed up beautifully.  When I set them to rise for 30 min I didn't think anything was happening, but when I baked them they turned into adorable little whole wheat balloons!  I made healthy pizzas on them; scrumptious.

The first time I tried to make pita, they flopped bad, but these thing poofed right up!  My wife loves them!  I used a gallon ziplock instead of a paper bag, but once they cool, I think they should be transferred to a dry ziplock so they don't go bad as quick. I substituted 1c flour with 1c whole wheat flour.  Tomorrow night, we'll roll them up with sliced grilled chicken, lettuce, tomato, and some ranch dressing!  :g

Do NOT use much flour on your board.  For our oven we cooked them for 4 minutes, flipped them and cooked for another two.  Okay but we probably won't make them again.

I had to revise my last review.
I put 1 1/4 cups of water +2tbsp last time I made these.
This recipe should just read 1 cup + 2Tbsp instead of 1 1/8 cups.  Not everyone has a 1/8 cup measuring cup.
Now that I have this figured out the dough turned out great even after using whole wheat flour.

I made these according to others directions and used some wheat flour. I was very impressed with how they puffed up...I don't understand the chemistry of it all but it works! The taste, however, was nothing special. It was actually pretty bland. I know pitas aren't supposed to super flavorful but this was bad. If I make these again, I'll have to make some additions.

Love this recipe!  I don't have a bread machine so I just mixed it in my kitchen aid and let it rise in the bowl.  I did use 1 cup of Whole Wheat flour and 2 cups white.  Turned out great!

very good, looked beautiful, and tasted delicous!  I added some seasonings to the dough to make it have more of a flavor.  My husband poked a hole in a few remaining (I made 2 batches and rolled them smaller) and put honey in them.  Very very yummy!

These were wonderful.  I did half whole wheat and half white flour.  I "fried" them in a skillet and they turned out wonderful.  Some puffed, some didn't, but that was ok, I wanted them for the spinach and feta pita bakes on this website.  YUMMO!!

I love this recipe!  I used half whole what and half white flour.  I used the damp cloth method after pulling them out of the oven.  They turned out way, way better than the pita you buy at the store - Which I will never buy again.

Perfect, don't change a thing!  Mine came out all sorts of wonky shaped because I can't roll a circle, and they still puffed up quite nicely (about 8 out of 10).  I'm very impressed with myself!!  Good bread taste too, perfect background for fillings!

well, I fallowed the instructions to the T and ended up with 8 7" crackers.  As crackers go, they don't taste too bad, but that wasn't what I was wanting.  After rolling the dough out into it's individual round breads, it simply ceased to ride.  I thought maybe the rising action i was seeing in the photo's would happen once they were in the oven, but no dice.  They stayed flat from rolling pen to finished product.

wow!  i was so pleasantly surprised when they actually puffed! I used these modifications: i substituted 1/2 cup whole wheat flour.  i don't have a bread machine so i did that part by hand.  and also, i used a pizza stone and it worked great.

I enjoyed making these. I've only ever tried making pitas once before years ago, and it was a miserable failure. I was a little more successful with these, and with practice, I'm sure they'll get better. Mine never puffed up in the oven.

Really great!  You need to cover them with a wet cloth after though, and they are better the next day.  I doubled the salt as they were a little bland without that.  My kids love them!

Much better than what I can buy at the store. I would make them more often if they didn't take so much time to roll them all out.

Easy to prepare, however the making part is touch & go. Let rise longer than 30 min b/c was multitasking something else, but dough did rise/puff. In the oven, however, only had half of them puff. The first 3 I don't think I did long enough or warm enough, so did try 2 extra times at the higher temp.--once cooked (even partially), they can't puff up much more at all--mistake learned. Tried the fry on the stove method, and only ended up with a few bubbles, but no "pita puff". Had no "cake rack" so used my airbake pizza pan-and that was just fine.

Made by hand and its okay - not what I was expecting.  Does not make pockets.  Ended up the end day poking holes with wooden spoon, drizzle olive oil, put on pizza sauce and parma cheese and green onions - good!  Italian pizza bread (foccia).

This is now my favourite breadmaker recipe! At first, looking at the pictures of the finished pitas, I thought "No way mine will turn out that nice." But they did! And they are delicious! I substituted canola oil for vegetable oil, and 1 1/2 cups all-purpose whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups white bread flour for the 3 cups all purpose flour. Next time I will try adding garlic and/or oregano. Thanks a bunch!

excellent recipe! I want to share this with everybody I know (or maybe not, so they are impressed when I make it for them!) It was the very first recipe I made in my bread maker. I didn't place them in the oven, but used the griddle like some suggested. Mine didn't puff up but honestly, I didn't really put much time into the rolling process. Next time, I'll try to make them prettier. These were the best pitas I've had, EVER! My entire family loved them. We ate them with hummus, but they were the star. I will make these very often. Thanks so much!

Great recipe--very easy, very tasty!  I usually don't bake mine, though.  Instead, I put them on a medium hot ungreased griddle and cook them until they're crisp on each side.  They usually puff up really well that way and they have the slightly toasted texture that I like.

Very good - easy too! Next time I will try and roll just a little thinner as I thought mine had a little too much "bread" taste as a little too thick in some areas. Perfect compliment to homemade hummus from this site. Yum!

This is a very good recipe, and most of my pita's rose well.  The only problem is they did not brown very well which gives them the presence of underdone.  So, we grilled them slightly on the BBQ pit and they were fantastic.  No changes in the recipe, just in the cooking.

This is the best Pita bread I have ever had.  I will never buy pita in a store again!!!  I do not have a bread machine, so I followed other people's directions.  I cooked mine in a teflon coated skillet with a tiny bit of olive oil to keep from sticking.  This also creates a soft pita.  They came out perfect!  If you want them to puff, they must be perfectly round with no tears, not even pin prick sized. I recommend placing the pita on a greased and floured surface to allow easier removal for cooking.

Delicious!  It was my first time making pitas too.  Followed the recipe as written and had no trouble with the rising or the softness.  Instead of the paper bag method, I used the damp dishcloth - but put the finished pitas in between layers of the damp towel instead of just draping it over the top of the plate.  It seemed to soften them up a little quicker.  Very easy, fun and MUCH better than store bought, although I agree with the previous reviewer, that if you want a grocery story size pita, either make fewer pitas or more dough.

I will never buy pita bread ever again! This was a very tasty and easy recipe. My pitas didn't puff up as expected but I was still able to make the center seperate. I'm sure it might have been because I rolled them too big so I'm hoping next time to roll them out right.

Thank you for the instruction to put the freshly baked pitas in a bag!  I had a similar recipe from my bread machine cookbook but they left out this very important step, which makes the pitas soft and chewy instead of crispy and not useful for pita pockets.  I used half white flour, half multigrain flour and got a nice nutty flavour and a bit of crunchy texture too. I did everything else exactly as written and am really pleased with the results.

Went just over 4 minutes. Ended up with pita chips. Very hard. Went directly into paper bag with no change.

Thanks so much for this recipe.I was always scared to try a pita recipe,I thought it would be so difficult to make.Then I found this and it was very easy to follow. I don't have a bread machine, I used a kitchen aid.  I minused the amount of water and used juice to add up to the right amount, and I used 1-1/2c. whole wheat flour, 1-1/2c. white flour it turned out great. My daughter loves it SO much she only eats pita instead of bread for her sandwiches.

Excellent, easy and fun to make.  If you put them in the paper bag, though, they get pretty hard & crispy.  Next time, if we want to stuff them, we'll try the damp towel method.

Good recipe, I use it all the time. I substitute 1/2 wheat flour to make it healthier, I also make more smaller ones to control calories. They don't always split really well, but can make great little pizza crusts if they don't. Just be careful to not let them get too cool when rising or flatten too much when transferring to cooling rack (on their way to the oven).

I was thrilled with these! The only thing I didn't understand was the instruction to roll the dough into a rope. I just formed a dough ball and then cut it into 8 pieces, which seemed a lot easier. As long as you don't make them too large they bake up with a perfect pocket inside.

I have always been a little leery of making pita bread but not any more. I made this today to take to a Superbowl party tomorrow along with some hummus.  I doubled the recipe and used my tortilla press instead of a rolling pin.  They puffed up just like in the picture.  I was really surprised. I didn't have a paper bag so I used a damp towel and that softened them up. I just cut one open and there wasn't much of pocket and the flavor is lacking.  I will give this a 5 for ease of the recipe but the lack of a pocket and flavor I have to give it a 3.

This was the first time that I have attempted pita bread. I will be making it like this from now on instead of buying it, since it is over priced and this way is so easy! Thanks for the recipe! Note- If you mcrowave a pita for about 30-40 seconds it will fold in half without tearing.

I mixed the dough with a kitchenaid mixer, and used a non-sticking frying pan for "baking" -- a very convenient method by the way, producing nice results. Add a very thin piece of rolled dough (the thinnest the best in my case) to the frying pan and wait for it to completely pop (don't turn). Turn after popping, to bake and color the other side. Put inside a ziplock bag 1 min after baking to keep it moist.

I made the recipe "as is" and wished that I had followed others' advice to add more salt. The pitas puffed and turned out nicely, I just wish they had a bit more flavor.

This didn't turn out easy to make a pita out of, but I think it was more my fault (lack of measuring utensils) than the recipe. That said, it was a very tasty bread, and I'll make it again.

My pitas turned out amazingly.  Like many others suggested, I subbed half whole wheat flour for half of the all-purpose flour.  I also threw in 1 tbsp each of dill weed and garlic salt.  This resulted in a nice flavorful pita.  I also do not have a bread machine and followed miki's directions for making the dough without one with great success.

The only downside in my experience was that the pockets did not form on their own.  This may have been my own fault, even though I'm not entirely sure of the physics behind pita pocket formation.  I do not have a cake rack and baked my pitas on a lightly greased and floured cookie sheet.  The pitas turned out well other than the pockets though the centers were soft and almost-pocketing.  I was able to cut into them to form my own pockets pretty easily after the pitas had softened up in a brown paper bag for a while.

Excellent recipe. I don't have a bread machine, so I just used the kitchen aid (proofing the yeast in 110 degree sugar/water mixture, letting it rise until double in size, and then following the rest of the recipe). They came out very tender and poofy. Make sure you watch them carefully, they can burn easily.

I would make these larger than suggested - maybe make six instead of eight. They don't seem to puff evenly - make sure you put them centered in the oven. The moist towel is key to the texture. Otherwise, quite tasty, great with tzatziki.

I was kind of disappointed with these--I guess I remember making pita that was a little softer than this. I also didn't have a cake rack, so I just threw them on a sheet and flipped them over half way thru the cooking so they wouldn't get too dark on either side.  here is something to note:  if you accidentally deflate the risen pita dough, it will not split when it's baking in the over.  so be careful in transferring the dough to the sheet (or pan, or rack, whatever you use).

The bread itself tasted pretty good. However, I couldn't seem to get the pitas to create a pocket, they were more like little air bubbles than an actual pocket.

I made these in my kitchen aid mixer.  Everything went well until I tried to roll them out into 8 balls.  They rose a ton before and I thought they were going to turn out perfectly.  I couldn't get 8 6-7 inch circles first of all.  I made 7 imperfect circles and then waited for them to rise again.  They rose a little bit, but didn't puff up as much as I would have liked them too.  I guess I am going to have to play with this recipe to make it perfect.  They tasted great with honey drizzled on them.

Per another reviewer's advice, I used half AP flour, half whole wheat flour.  YUM!  Great texture and mild taste. (5 stars for recipe WITH substitution)

Very good pita!! Very time consuming though.  I think I would rather just go buy a bag of pita from the store, but this recipe is good if you are in a pinch and can't make it to the store. All in all it made good pita bread.Thanks.

Used half whole wheat/ half white flour.  Turned out really tasty but the first few did not puff up.  They all tasted good, very light and tasted great with a tofu veggie stir fry stuffed inside.

I have made 2-3 times, they are great!  They freeze and thaw well, and are better tasting and more tender than purchased pita bread.  Very easy to make and so yummy as a sandwich!

I made these today, I doubled the recipe and it made 20. They are bland but I like them like that, because the filling can be sweet or savory. I will be making burgers with these and fill them with tuna salad tomorrow. Thanks so much for a great recipe. Perfect to make when it's snowing outside.

I just made these. They didn't really puff up and I don't really think I could use them as a "pocket". I don't really know what happened. They still tasted good though. I cut one into quarters and ate it with some hummus I made.

This was my first time attempting pitas, but not all of the pitas puffed up.  I also let a few cook too long--beware!  The bread that did rise had a good flavor.  Not sure I'll make again.

These were really good!  I added about 1 tsp garlic powder.  I used the stovetop method and had a bit of trouble keeping the level of heat even (electric stove), but they all seemed to turn out well.

These pita's were easy and taste great, even without a bread maker. I used a combination of wholewheat and best for bread flour. My son helped me make them and insisted that he have them in his lunch.

These were soooo delicious! And I thought I loved the pitas you buy at the store...they're nothing compared to these. I didn't have a rack so I used a preheated pan coated with cornmeal and it worked fine. Oh, and all of my pitas puffed up wonderfully.

VERY easy and VERY good.  I have made pita without a bread machine before and it was much harder and they didn't turn out nearly as tasty.  This is definitely the recipe I will be using from now on!

They turned out ok. Didn't puff up as much as the picture another baker submitted. I'll definitely try these again to get them to puff more and really keep an eye on them in the oven. The first 4 got a little too brown. Tastes just like regular bread to me. I'll be posting pictures soon.

Thank you for posting such an EASY and wonderful recipe! 

I do not, however, possess enough patience to use my bread machine. Instead I used bread machine yeast in the warmest tap water with the sugar and let it work together for 15 minutes, until the froth was thick at the top of the mixture. I combined the flour and salt while waiting for the yeast mixture. Then I combined all ingredients, including the oil. I let it rise once in the bowl for 30 min's. And then rolled them out per recipe and let them rise once more. What I liked most about this recipe was that the dough rolled out so easily -- very easy to work with!

Just to let you know that it wasn't just me who liked this -- I tried it with hummus at an informal potluck gathering of about 40 people. All the pitas were gone well before the end.

Kudos.

Heidi

This is one easy fix and the bread comes out beautifully.  It is much fluffier than store brands and my friends love it.  I have also added dried onion flakes and or dill for a nice change.  Easy to do, really and fun to see puffed up so nicely

Mine didn't come out the perfect shape, but that's operator error. They were very light, soft and delicious! We used them with the "Marinated Pita Chicken Sandwich" recipe from this site and we all loved it, my husband and 5yo were in love.  They were also delicious with homemade hummus. This one's a keeper.

Very easy.  I followed DReginek's instructions for making without a bread maker, turned out perfect, so much better than store bought.  I made them in the oven the first time and have put them on the grill each time after, totally fun and tasty.  I served them with baba ghanoush, so yummy.

these were great, and I thought the same thing so many other said.  Are these things actually going to "Poof"?  But they did!  And these were to make it 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 regular.  My son and husband LOVE them!!

I don't have a bread machine and this still turned out well.  So much better than the store bought-- when cut in half the pocket is big and easy to stuff.  I used 1/2 wheat and 1/2 white flour as some suggested and it was great--it never tasted 'wheaty' but was at least a little healthier.  Note: be sure to let the dough rise and proof for the correct amount of time or your bread won't puff up.

These were wonderful.  I made mini pitas and filled them with crab salad.  They were a little time consuming (didn't use a breadmachine) but well worth the effort.  Since I was making quite a few, I put them in a covered roaster rather than a paper bag.  Worked great!

A friend made these, and they turned out doughy and didn't poof. So, when I was making them, I made sure the oven was fully hot, and then cooked them until they actually were golden brown (about 7 minutes). They poofed! and tasted quite good. The flavor is very plain, but they go well with hummus :).

Quite good, but nothing spectacular. Fun to do, but not terribly better than store bought--but this does get points for coming fresh out of the oven.

This recipe is great! Every one of those pitas puffed up beautifully, something I had never been able to achieve before!
I used bread flour, half white and half wheat.
I think the next time I will move the oven rack up higher, so maybe the bottoms won't get so dark before the tops start browning.

Yum - these were tasty!  Time consuming, but worth it.  I used 1 cup of wheat flour in place of 1 cup white flour - next time I will try even more wheat to get that good-for-you whole grain fiber.  Also added a 1/2 tsp of garlic powder.  These puffed up nice and high. Would definitley make these again!!  :)

Excellent taste, better than the stuff you find in the store. I had a few difficulties because I live in high altitude and b/c it was my first time baking in a gas stove (which only offers direct heat from the bottom), so a couple that were very dark brown on the bottom and still very light on top. Next time I will flip them. This was all user error though and despite my shortcomings, very yummy. I made with Marinated Greek Chicken Kabobs and Tzatziki Sauce II for an excellent meal.

I was surprised at how beautiful these pitas looked when I took them out of the oven.  They tasted just as great too!  To prepare the pita for sandwiches, I like to brush on a little olive oil and touch of salt, then place on a skillet or Foreman for a few min.  I served the pita with homemade hummus, tabouli, feta cheese and calamata olives.

These were nothing special.  I prefer the store bought pitas.  I doubled the salt as others suggested and they were very salty...so I don't recommend adding more than the recipe states.

Easy, but four of my eight pitas didn't puff.  Those were the ones topped with olive oil, though.  I'm going to make this again, without the olive oil, and see what happens.  Also, I made these by hand because I don't have a bread machine.
