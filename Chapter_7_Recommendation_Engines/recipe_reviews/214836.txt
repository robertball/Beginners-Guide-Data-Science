Loved it! I had no green onions or tarragon, and used white onion instead. The taste would have been better with the green! Otherwise, I kept everything to a tee. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Very good!  I used left-over roast chicken instead of rotisserie, but  otherwise followed exactly.  Love tarragon, but think it could use a little less, and a few more mushrooms.  Needs a deep skillet!

Very good.  I would however leave the nutmeg out next time, because I don't like it.  I could still taste it.  But otherwise very good.

It was OK.  We'll eat it, but, not sure I will prepare again.

very good.  we made some modifications, and turned it into a slowcooker recipe.  we used almond milk and no sour cream.  we also used two thawed chicken breasts, tripled the amount of tarragon, and threw in a pack of frozen spinach.  also, we used two cans of chicken broth instead of the beef bouillon and water.  cooked on low for 6 hrs.

Rich with lots of flavor.  Easy to make.  I bought local grocery fried chicken (remove all the skin and breading) and that makes it easy.  Worked very well.  Substituted lo fat sour cream and milk.....recipe is high in total and sat. fat.  Great soup!

Not a fan. The lemon juice did not complement this recipe at all. It called for way too much sour cream. Between the lemon and sour cream it has a strange tang. No one in my family will eat it. Trying to save it now so it doesn't go to waste...

Simple and amazing...subbed cardamom for nutmeg and heavy whipping cream for milk (needed to use it up) and the result was creamy and sophisticated.

Delicious! I used homemade chicken stock instead of beef, eliminated sour cream and cornstarch

Very flavorful! I added truffle salt when I was sauteing the mushrooms and it brought out the flavor of the mushrooms. I also used a bullion stock base because I don't use cubes, I think it adds more flavor. I will definitely make this again.

The only change I made was adding a few more mushrooms.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly as written.  The soup was a huge hit with the family and I will definitely make it again.

I made this almost exactly as written. I forgot to buy green onion so I used white onion instead. This soup is creamy and delicious without the need to blend in a food processor. I used pulled smoked chicken from the deli. I will be making this again!

This soup was great!  Used a bit less taragon.  Wasn't sure I would like it as not keen on tarragon.  It was tasty and next time I would use amt. of taragon in recipe.  I expected it to need salt at the table as there wasn't much in the recipe but found it didn't need more for most of us.

This soup went together pretty quickly.  I had roasted a chicken the day before, so I used that instead of store bought rotisserie chicken.  Also didn't have tarragon, so i substituted sage.  I also added some garlic powder.  Very nice satisfying soup.  Will make it again.

It was very good, however I left the nutmeg out because I'm just not a fan of it except in baked goods. Otherwise I followed the recipe, but did add more mushrooms because we are partial to them.
