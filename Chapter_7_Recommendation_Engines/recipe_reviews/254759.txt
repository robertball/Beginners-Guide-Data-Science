I thought these were really delicious.  I added two things,, almonds because to me it isnt a cookie without nuts and I drizzled it with chocolate. The lavender was a nice taste and my house smelled wonderful. They were easy to make and the alternative flours were not overly heavy nor bitter.. glad I found a recipe to use them up in
