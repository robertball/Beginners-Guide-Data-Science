The presentation isn't all that attractive.  There is so much flour, it takes up most of the jar.  I would also suggest putting the pecans after the white sugar so the flour doesn't leak through them.

My mother use to make these for me when I was a child. When ever I make them everyone is shocked on how good they are and what there is potatoes chips in them

I used to have this recipe. I have been looking for it again. I do two things different. I leave them in balls to bake them. After they a completly cooled I roll them in powdered sugar.

I made these cookies and while they were good I thought that they were too much like pecan sandies because they end up being a drier cookie.

A unique delight of a cookie worth tasting. I wasn't sure how it would be with potato chips, but the end result was a pleasant surprise. The only suggestion I received was to add chocolate chips to them to give another flavor variation.

I had fun putting this together.  Mostly simple.

A note - read directions very carefully!!  I had no idea there was a difference in the mouths of the jars, and I didn't read closely enough, so I ended up with a ton of Regular-mouthed jars.  You REALLY need the WIDE-mouthed jars - it would have made it SO much easier to press each layer!!!  

I can't wait to give these out as prizes at the baby shower!  We'll also be making some of the cookies so that people won't be too afraid of them! :o)
