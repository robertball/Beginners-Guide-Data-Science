As recipes go this isn't much of a recipe - but I do have to say, you need more than a pinch of salt when cooking potatoes.

Great with small new potatos as well. I also added fresh lemon thyme to the pot while the potatos were boiling and left it in with them while they were being served. A good side dish to steak or hamburgers as well.

This recipe was a hit before I ever made it.  My guys love boiled potatoes.  I didn't have yellow-flesh potatoes, so I used what I had.  Super simple to make and it yields a potatoes with a lot of flavor.  I added 1 tsp. of salt to the potatoes rather than a pinch.  The potatoes were served with 'Autumn Apple Salad', Apricot Brown Sugar Ham' and 'Beer Muffins', they are all AR recipes.

I've eaten boiled potatoes my whole life but have always just added a little bit of butter, a little bit of pepper and plenty of salt. I liked the addition of parsley, but I agree with Baking Nana -- potatoes definitely need more than a pinch of salt, or you're going to be very disappointed.

Simple recipe. But believe it or not, it somehow helped me when I was looking for something ridiculously simple to serve with schnitzel. This was Perfect! Add more than a 'pinch' of salt, though. Throw the potatoes in the water, as the recipe says.....and when they're ready, hold them CAREFULLY to easily remove the skins. Add your parsley, butter...and whatever else you'd like! PERFECT! Thank You for the recipe!!

Super easy. Very good. Did add butter after draining, just a preference.

I grew up eating "Parsley Potatoes." I love it. The only difference was that we always had melted butter to pour over it. That's how I make it. Exactly as written then melt some butter (or I Can't Believe It's Not Butter) and pour on as little...or as much...as you want. Great recipe and great simple, hearty food from our German ancestors.

I thought it was pretty bland. Would definitely need to be served with something that has bolder flavor.

I drain them then toss with butter and herbs or sour cream and dill.
