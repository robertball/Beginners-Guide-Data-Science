Very easy and delicious!  Also, I cut back the amount of oil and used only one egg and it still comes out moist, delicious and lower in fat.

I made this recipe without the raisins. The bread was really, really moist. I also added about 1/4 tsp. nutmeg. Only complaint was that there was more cinnamon flavor than apple flavor, but it is worth trying again with maybe a bit less cinnamon.

A delicious bread that tastes like apple crisp!  I added about 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg and increased the brown sugar to a full cup.  I used less than half the amount of oil and it still came out incredibly moist.  I also added one chopped apple and next time I might add some chopped walnuts and a little vanilla. This one's a keeper.

This bread is very moist.  You would think there was more oil in it.  I will be making this one again for sure, maybe adding some grated carrots next time.

This was so easy to make as part of a gift platter. I did not have quick cooking oats so I pulsed normal rolled oats in a blender until very fine and that worked well as a substitute.

Very, very good!  I didn't have quick-cooking oats, but it still turned out nicely.  I disagree with turning it out of the pan immediately...it fell apart, and in my experience, that happens when you turn it out too soon.  Next time, I'll let it sit for ten minutes before turning.  It is lightweight and flavorful.  If you're finding your quick breads to be dense, it's likely you're overstirring.  When you combine the wet & dry ingredients, stir it gently with a rubber spatula just until it is blended.  It should come out great then!

Yes, this does turn out nice and moist.  I omitted the oil and added more applesauce (which did make it more "appley").  One idea may be to add shredded apples for more texture and flavor.

Super easy and very moist. I used cooking spray to grease pan instead of flour. It also took a little longer to cook.

This is really good bread. I added a glaze on top for a sweet kick. Medium heat, melt 1/4 cup butter, add 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 tablespoon vanilla, 1/8 molasses. Drizzle.

This is a good recipe especially for a breakfast bread (one feels like they are getting their cereal but a little more interesting).   Have to agree with other reviewers that it does need something to pep up the flavour and, for me, is to substitute 1/4 cup frozen concentrated orange juice for the apple juice.   Orange and oatmeal make a good marriage. Hope this is helpful to others.

Very Good! I omitted the oil and added a whole, shredded apple and a dash of nutmeg. Not too sweet and very hearty.

pretty good--I actually followed the recipe as is for a change--mostly.  I did make these as muffins instead though, and put a little strudel on top.  I had chunky applesause and that was really good..  Very light muffins, not really a bread-like texture.

I cut the recipe in half and made 6 delicious muffins.  As recommended from another review, I left out the oil and added a little extra applesauce.  I did not have any raisins so I left that out. I also sprinkled some oats on top before baking.  There is not a strong apple taste, but healthy and delicious! I will make again.

very nice bread.  it's slightly sweet, but not too sweet, and is chock full of flavor and moistness.  bravo on the recipe!  I didn't have a problem with taking it out of the pan relatively quickly . . .I may have waited a few minutes--not sure, but it came out just fine.  the only thing I didn't use in the recipe was soaking the raisins in apple juice.  i just tossed them in without bothering with that step, and ti turned out fine.  thanks for the recipe!

I think that this recipe may be good with modifications.  I followed the recipe very closely and it cooked so moist that it was doughy in the middle.  Also, there is very little apple taste.  I would not make this recipe again.

this bread is FABULOUS!  i decreased the oil by half and replaced with a bit more applesauce as others did. beyond that i was true to the recipe and it turned out great.  very moist, and almost a cake-like texture, but we all really enjoyed this. the oatmeal gives it a great texture, too. thanks!

I rated this recipe a 4 vs 5 only because I made modifications. I soaked the raisins in water vs apple juice (just b/c that's what I had), added 1/2 tsp ginger & 1/4 tsp allspice to pep up the taste and a handful of chopped pecans for added texture. I also baked it in a 9x9 glass dish and cut baking time to  35 minutes. I tried a corner while it was still warm and it was good. I can't wait to try a piece tomorrow after it's had a chance for the flavors to blend! Will probably make this again.

I make this loaf often. It's good to have a recipe which uses oats as well as applesauce. I took another reviewer's suggestion and sprinkle the top with additional brown sugar before baking - it adds a nice slightly sweet crunch.

I used water instead of apple juice because I didn't have any, used Bob's Red Mill old-fashioned oats instead of quick cooking, and added about 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt for the 48 serving recipe, though the recipe doesn't call for any salt.

I was making them for holiday baskets for shut-ins, and ...

It was excellent!

Very moist but too dense and doughy tasting. Ok to eat, but will not make again.

Pretty good, but there's something missing that I can't put my finger on.  In the recipe's defense, I did use Splenda brown sugar instead of regular, but that usually doesn't compromise taste.  I also added a splash of vanilla and a handful of chopped pecans, and they seemed to work well in the recipe.  The bread is very moist and not overly sweet, which is good.  I will keep this recipe and maybe try some other modifications to see if I get a better result.
