I love that this is one of the quickest treats I've ever done. When I added the sugar, the dough became fairly dry and I had a little difficulty mixing in the cereal and getting the nuts to stick. Maybe just add the sugar a little at a time till the dough seems to be of a good consistency. The contrast of the salty peanuts is wonderful against the sweet crispy peanut butter mixture.

This recipe won "Best Tasting" at a party I took it to tonight out of over 20 dishes!  It really was so good everyone kept asking me for the recipe and said it was so good it was addictive!  I don't think I had the consistency right because it would break apart more than I think it should have so play around with the amounts of peanut butter and butter you use to get it to hold together better, but as far as taste.  It's a huge winner!
