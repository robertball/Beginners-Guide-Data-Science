I made this with little measuring and only 1 chicken breast and 1 mango.  Be careful not to overcook the chicken.  12 minutes was enough.

It was ok, but the chicken was not as exciting as I had hoped.

I marinated the chicken overnight to give it a stronger flavor, and it turned out beautifully. To give the mangos an extra kick, let them get crispy on the grill. The texture of the grilled mangos will then be close to that of a roasted marshmallow.

My family loved this. I marinated it the whole day which I think helped keep the flavor strong. I also used more ginger than it called for. Overall I would make again!

The cooking time is definitely too long, but with an adjustment this was a nice refreshing recipe. The chicken barely has any flavor from the marinade, but is still good. I put this on some coconut basmati rice and really enjoyed it!

Yummy!  The marinade is tasty and the mango with the chicken is matched perfectly! I made this dish with "cajun style baked sweet potato" recipe from this site and I thought the flavors went well together. delish :)

I made a few changes and it came out great ... I used sesame oil instead of olive oil and added a lot more ginger root than what was suggested (probably double). I marainated it for a day which added more taste. I, also, added fresh pineapple to the kabob's.

First rule of grilling/smoking is to make sure you have a good food thermometer.  It is a must!
You should never  go off of cook time.  
Marinating is the key to bringing out the best flavor in most meats.   A stand by marinade I’ve used for years is just plain pineapple juice.   Feel free to add spices you like, really hard to screw it up.   Try and marinade for at least 3-4 hrs in the fridge.   
Good luck!!!

Didn't have fresh ginger, used powdered instead, marinated about 3 hours. Great flavor and everyone liked it. Will make again.

They were amazing but way to much for 8 of us for an app.   I would recommend it for dinner.  :-)

I didn't have any ginger root but I LOVE lemon pepper. It was tender and delicious. I never grilled mango before. I would use pineapple next time to be honest. Mango gets too mushy.

12-07-15 ~ A recipe that we really enjoyed.  I had a mango to use and a lot of chicken in the freezer.  Since it was cold outside, I didn't want my DH to mess with the kabobs, so we threw everything in a grilling basket.  I did add sweet onion pieces to the mixture.  The marinade is very good, and I let the chicken soak all day in it.   The next time I make this, I will add some orange zest to the marinade.  We had leftover 'Magnificent Macaroni Salad' from AR and sliced cucumbers to round out or meal.  This was a great 'cold night' meal, but will make a fantastic summer meal!

OMG! Amazing! I love the charred taste that the mangoes took on, and the chicken was perfection! I might use a little more ginger next time. But otherwise, this was a pretty perfect meal. Served along side veggie kabobs
