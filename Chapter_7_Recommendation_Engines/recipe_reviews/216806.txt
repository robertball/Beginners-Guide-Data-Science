I rarely assign 5 stars, because it means there is zero room for improvement.  I have given this recipe one of my coveted 5-star ratings, as I truly don't see any way to make it better.

Starting with the frozen Brussels sprouts.  I urge you not to think you will improve this recipe by using fresh.  Unless you are pulling them from your own garden, Brussels sprouts are never truly fresh, and they rapidly deteriorate once harvested.  If you MUST use fresh, be sure to at least use the ones that come still attached to the stalk.  The reason they sell them that way is because of the rapid deterioration these vegetable experience once harvested.  This is also why so many people think they don't like Brussels sprouts!  

The mixture of apples and onions into this recipe is perfect, and the lemon adds a nice tang.

As the original recipe notes in the footnotes, you can adjust roasting time for desired doneness.  I find that 40 minutes produces a better result, turning the vegetables every 10-15 minutes for even browning.  You want them slightly darkened and caramelized.  I am experimenting with using the convection feature of our oven to see if I can achieve this effect quicker.   Best to use non-stick foil to line your roasting pan to prevent sticking.

Let me preface by saying I combined this and the Roasted Brussels Sprouts and Pecan recipe because I like apples and pecans :). I started the process on the stove with my cast iron skillet to ensure a caramelized brussels sprout and then moved to my oven for 15-20 minutes. Absolutely delicious, no bitter taste either and the apples added a wonderful flavor.

Loved this!!  Unfortunately we only had one onion on hand, and we used fresh brussel sprouts, and one granny smith apple and one gala apple.  We placed everything in cast iron bowls and put them on the grill instead of in the oven, it was awesome!!  Loved the little bit of char and carmelization.

Very tasty and easy to prepare!  I used fresh brussels sprouts and cut them in half... came out great.  I am glad to have a brussels sprouts recipe that doesn't include bacon or butter.

Loved these! However-I had to use what I had on hand....Used fresh Brussels sprouts (about 16 oz), 1 apple, 1 onion and no lemon. Also, I mixed all ingredients and placed the mixture in aluminum foil and baked for about 50 minutes. Delicious!

This is a good, solid dish.  The apples and the onions play off of each other well, and the brussels sprouts come out nicely seared, giving them the best possible flavor.  I do have a few notes to take this from a 4 to a 5, though:

First, tossing the sprouts, apples, and onions in the oil instead of drizzling will help coat them completely and get a better bake on them.  

Second, pecans.  a cup of untoasted pecans added before baking will make this dish really pop.  I added mine after trying the dish, and it definitely enhanced the flavor.

I have made this recipe but use parchment paper (no cleanup) and I put the brussels and apples in a bag and drizzle olive oil into bag along with sea salt to cover them all before putting them in my table top convection oven for 20 mins at 400-425 degrees. So easy!

I have used this recipe as a side dish and loved it.  It is also delicious as a  vegan main dish by adding chickpeas and serving on a bed of quinoa  for more protein. (the red quinoa makes a nice color contrast) I also add a few chopped walnuts for extra crunch.

I prepared this recipe with 1 cup pecans. The apples did not do much for me. I did like the pecans with the crunch. I will not be making this again.

This was really good. All I had was lemon juice, so I drizzled that over all at the end. All 4 adults loved it. Mom doesn't like it. Apples got very mushy. Lemon zest and juice nice.

My kids love brussel sprouts, but we always eat them steamed.  I was looking for a way to change things up a bit and given the good reviews, thought I would try this.  Nobody, in my family of 4, liked this recipe.  Bummer, too, since we had such high expectations.

This has become a family staple! We make it all the time. My 11 year old loves it too!! Sometimes we switch it up adding sliced up cherry or grape tomatoes, mini bell peppers, or even mushrooms! Thanks for sharing!!

I used fresh Brussels sprouts. Proportions for my taste would be a third of each : 1/3 sprouts, 1/3 onions, 1/3 apples. I sliced them all thinly as I was in a rush : this way cooking only takes 10 mn in a frying pan. The lemon does bring a plus. Great with chunks of bacon or ham on the top.

Tasty and easy!  I took some recomendations from others and I started on the stove with the onions and brussels sprouts, cooked until caramelized.  Added apples and dried cranberries, cooked on stovetop for a while then added salt and pepper.  Transfered onto parchment paper lined cookie sheet and cooked for 25 mins....will add lemon juice and zest before serving!

Made with both fresh and frozen brussel sprouts on separate occasions and it turned out well. One of the reviewers said to cook it for 40 minutes did that and it was way too overcooked 25-30 minutes seems just right. It's a great side dish with salmon. Thanks!

I thought they were alright, my husband loved them. I left out the onions, just because, I tossed them on the stove in olive oil, salt, pepper, lemon, then put them with apples and walnuts in the oven. I added gorgonzola on top as soon as I took it out. They grew on me after a few bites, but were a hit with everyone else.

My guests liked the lemony flavor, but the texture was not quite right. Overall, the dish was good. If I make it again, I will definitely use fresh brussels sprouts. Frozen sprouts are no substitute!

I had high hopes for this combination. The apples and onions were good but the b sprouts were mushy. I only made half the recipe...good thing since no one cared for it.

This is an excellent recipe.  I roasted for 45 minutes. I used a tiny sprinkle of sea salt and lots of fresh ground pepper. The list of ingredients did not include garlic powder but the directions mentioned garlic powder. I did not use garlic powder. These sprouts were like candy.

This was THE favorite dish at my Rosh Hashanah dinner. People who didn't even like brussels sprouts became fans. Can't wait to make this again :)

The flavours are very good.  However, next time I would definitely cut back on the roasting time and/or consider sauteeing in a pan where I think the "chef" would have more control over the desired doneness of the sprouts.  I used fresh sprouts and prefer my veggies more al dente.  My first attept at this recipe left me with overdone sprouts and mushy apples.  Will try again using fresh sprouts cut in half and sauteed stovetop. Nice addition to my collection of sprout recipes.

A most pleasant change for Brussels.  I cooked it all on top of the stove.  To use the oven for 5 Brussels!!!!  The next time I think I might put some lardons in.

Combined several recipes that intrigued me!  Added cauliflower, golden raisins, diced walnuts, and substituted a drizzle of chardonnay for the lemon juice.  Eliminated the garlic powder (didn't have any on hand).  In total: brussel sprouts with a hint of sweet.   Yum!  (See  "Chardonnay Drizzled Roasted Apples & Brussel Sprouts" for recipe.)

I didn't care for this combo. I used only half of a lemon, and it was already overpowering the flavors. Apples turned mushy. I'm not keeping this one.

I've made this a few times and it has been a hit each time. I made the recipe as written and I've also added a 1/4 cup dried cranberries for a hint of sweetness. Either way is great, depending on flavor profile you're trying to achieve.

Apples essentially turned into applesauce and the thawed sprouts were waterlogged and therefore soft after roasting. Still had a great flavor, though.

It was easy to make and a bit hit. Left out the salt and pepper because I am watching my salt and one of my guests is allergic to pepper. It was delicious.  I used very little olive oil as well.  I will definitely make it again.

I love brussel sprouts!  This was good, but not much of an improvement over plain roasted brussel sprouts.  (I didn't really care for the texture/taste of the apples with the brussel sprouts -- onions were OK with them, though).  The second time I made this, I tried adding pecans (per another reviewer's suggestion) and liked that better!

Like several others. I added balsamic vinegar to the oil, added the apples after  15 min and baked for a total of 30. Was a big hit and will definitely make again!

I didn’t enjoy this recipe at all. Followed the directions exactly and it lacked so much flavor. So I added bacon and grated Parmesan and it was slightly better, but still not good. The Brussels sprouts never got caramelized the way they do when I use fresh sprouts. I will be sticking to my tried and true (and delicious) usual way of making them.

read the reviews first and noticed the comments regarding apples being mushy or lost so decided to use a more firm apple and also a mac, because of the flavor a cooked mac has, although I know that they do get mushy.  used fresh sprouts cut in half.  the macs broke down, even though I cut them into bigger chunks.  I agree all and all, the apple really does nothing to impart another layer of flavor to the dish.  the visual appeal is not all there.  I didn't dislike the flavor but would probably not do this dish again because the apples really added nothing.  the lemon did brighten the dish a bit.

Excellent, and my new favourite Brussel sprout. Recipe! I used 3 smashed garlic cloves instead of the powder. Also tossed everything together in a bowl with the oil to coat evenly. Added some sea salt before serving along with the lemon zest and juice.. Which was most delish. Next time I will be roasting my zested lemon along with the Brussels to get the lemon juice nice a sweet. Used fresh Brussels halved..took 35 minutes to cook.

This recipe is delicious!  It was simple and easy to make.  I used fresh Brussels sprouts and real garlic so I had to cook them for 30 minutes instead of 20.  It is definitely a repeat recipe in my kitchen!

Very easy, healthy recipe. I added some garlic and some spinach and it was an amazing starter. I used fresh brussel sprouts and left it a little longer than 25 minutes to make sure everything was caramelized. Will definitely make again!

I didn't think this was a good as other roasted Brussels sprouts dishes I've made...I had only a fugi apple, which could have made a difference, as it's not as tart as a granny smith.  I did roast for 40 min. and another 5-10 minutes would have been fine, and I think more garlic would have been better.

I've tried Roasted and Dressed Up Brussels. Very good. If you don't like brussel sprouts you may not think much of it but, I think you should try it. Cooking green leaf vegetables without water changes the taste quite a bit. Grilling them seems to bring out more flavor and sweetness.

Nice taste and nice change from brussel sprouts baked with maple syrup and sauteed with butter. I only used the juice from half a lemon, but next time, I'll use the whole thing as stated in the recipe.

I thought it was too onion forward. The apples got too mushy so you didn't get the sweetness that might have balanced the onions. Nothing wrong with the recipe - it just didn't appeal to me.

Roasted Brussels just can’t be beat. I followed the recipe as is, using frozen sprouts. The only change I made was to add some crumbled bacon afterwards and I couldn’t have been happier. I’m going to try it again with fresh sprouts just out of curiosity.

I didn’t have a sweet onion so I fried bacon until crispy and added chopped ....what’s not to love about bacon in any recipe?? and it was fabulous ! I also added whole garlic cloves to roasting, and it added sweetness. In addition to olive oil, added some of the bacon drippings to the Brussels sprouts and apples while roasting. YUM!

I used fresh Brussel sprouts,  Braeburn apples and Vidalia onions.  Roasted for 20 minutes and it was delicious!  This recipe went into my “favorites“ file.

This was my first time cooking with brussel sprouts, which I bought fresh (not frozen).  Mine were pretty big, so I cut them and made a bit of a mess.  I would prefer smaller ones.  I liked the combination of flavors, though I did find the lemon a tad overwhelming.  After 20 minutes, they were soft and fragrant.  I removed them then but now wish I had kept them in longer.

Unless you’re trying to save maybe $1 or $2, please just get the fresh Brussels sprouts—you can even get the ones on a vine if you have a Trader Joe’s in your hood.   Otherwise, I make b-sprouts all the time and nothing beats fresh.  The frozen ones are mushy. Yep, that’s it.

I followed the recipe exactly.  It smelled up the house so badly I I had to open up all my doors in cold weather.  It was a side dish that I brought to a Thanksgiving party.  All the guests politely avoided what they had spooned on their plate after just one bite.

Sooo good! We love Brussel sprouts and I was hunting for a new recipe to use. So glad I found this one! The apples/onion/lemon combination is delicious! I will definitely make it again soon. I had fresh sprouts on hand, not sure what the difference frozen ones make to the taste, but I’d be willing to try that too. Otherwise, made it exactly to the recipe. Yum!

I was expecting crunchier Brussels sprouts.  The whole thing was sort of mushy.  The flavor was good.  If I made again I would use a much larger baking sheet and spread it out so it didn’t steam.  Alternatively, just plan on a soft casserole type dish.  

I wouldn’t make it again because of my preference for crunchiness.

Did as others and started with olive oil, thawed brussel sprouts chopped in half,  fresh garlic and 1 purple onion cooked  in a skillet until caramelized.  Transferred to a baking sheet, added the apples, another drizzle of oil and cooked on 250 while I made a quick run to the store. Toasted almond slivers in the seasoned skillet and added these at the end after a drizzle of lemon juice. Very very good. Teenager and 3 kids under 10 ate these up.

I made this last night with about double the quantity of fresh Brussels sprouts, one good sized Fuji apple, and about 3/4 of an average sized Vidalia onion (what I had in the house).  The ratio was fine, the flavors were good.  I roasted until the sprouts were just getting crispy on the top, and the apple was getting soft, stirring it all around on the baking sheet every 15 minutes or so. Everyone enjoyed it, and it was easy.  I will make it again.

We had 24 fresh brussel sprouts and red onion so that's  what I used! Halved the sprouts, diced 2 Macintosh apples. Tossed with 2 Tbsp lemon juice, 2 Tbsp Canola, spread on a cookie sheet, and seasoned with salt and pepper. Super good. I would try a firmer apple next time though.

Good but a little mushy on the apples.  I cooked it for 30 minutes and it was still not browning so I put it on broil.  Maybe the change on my part impacted the final product.  Will try it again,

These are wonderful.  My husband is not a Brussel sprout fan but he ate these up!  Didn't change anything.

I followed the recipe.  Made this dish for a family dinner and everyone loved it.  The apples and onions really complimented the Brussels sprouts.  Will make this again!

Used fresh sprouts. This was ok. Not a huge fan of brussel sprouts but I know they are good for you. Roasted for the full 20 minutes and they came out with a slight crunch. The apples and onions saved it for me.

I don't particularly care for brussel sprouts, so I'm always looking for a recipe that might change the mind of my taste buds.  This wasn't it. I prepared the recipe per instructions. I thought the dish came out more steamed than roasted. And unless you are crazy about onions, one is plenty.

Uniquely scrumptious. I added red pepper flakes, and more pepper/garlic powder than it called for. Definitely a healthy hit! :)

I made these when I was making dinner for a friend who absolutely loves brussel sprouts.  I wanted to do something a little different and this came with good ratings, so away I went.  I used a honeycrisp apple, which coincidentally was the only kind of apple I had in the house at the time.  It stood up very well to the baking and was still pretty firm at end of bake time.  I used a regular white cooking onion and the recipe still worked out famously.  I used fresh sprouts and still baked them over the recommended 20 min to ensure they were cooked as they were pretty big sprouts.  I like the one person's ides of using nuts like pecans as well, maybe I'll try that next time.

The only change I made was to leave the apple peel on and I added lightly cooked bacon. 
  My Guests and Husband really enjoyed it. It is really very easy to prepare, even early in the day to cook later.
  I posted a photo of roasted potatoes..sorry. I can't seem to delete it.

I used fresh brussel sprouts. I blanched them for 2 minutes then into an icewater bath and drain. This helps to keep the green color. This will be my go to recipe for brussel sprouts. It was delicious. The apples provide just a little sweetness and the lemon and zest give it a fresh punch.

I used fresh brussels sprouts in this recipe, but followed the contents of ingredients. I splashed in a little lemon juice, and a little balsamic vinegar .  Roasting time was about 35 minutes with fresh sprouts, at 400. I recommend marinating them ahead of time which was almost by mistake in my case! Make sure to stir during cook  time as well .

I accidentally forgot to add the lemon, and I used 5 - 10 whole garlic cloves instead of the garlic powder. Even with the lemon omission, all four of us  (including two kids) enjoyed this recipe.I especially liked the sweetness of the apples alongside the savory vegetables. Next time, I'll remember to add the lemon, because I think the acid will make this recipe even tastier.

Tasted great!  I used frozen Brussels sprouts - I followed the excellent recommendation of other reviewers and put all ingredients into a bag and shook it up to coat all the veggies evenly and lined my baking dish with baking parchment for easy cleanup.  Since the recipe asked for the zest and the juice of the lemon, after zesting, I sectioned my lemon, squeezed out the juice and tossed the roasted veggies with the zest, juice and pulp of the lemon. It took 30 minutes plus to finish roasting, maybe my Brussels sprouts were larger. I will make this again.

Really dubious about this working but made it anyway as it was only for the 2 of us. The bag of frozen sprouts had been lurking in the freezer for long enough and needed to see daylight.
Well what can I say other than amazing,  it was really good and something  I shall do again and again.
I didn't  tweak the recipe apart from not adding the lemon zest, that was  because although I had 2 lemons they were well and truly devoid of any zest  having been  used in a earlier recipe. I'll add that next time though.

We really liked this!  Next time, I'll cook a few minutes longer because the frozen brussels sprouts were slightly watery/juicy  in the middle, and we like them overcooked.  But this was super delicious!  I held back on the seasoning a bit b/c I was worried about how the apples would taste with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, but now I know for next time not to be worried.  Would love to add this to our regular rotation.

My 9 year old is EXTREMELY picky, but LOVED this healthy recipe! (Do you hear the angels singing?) We put all ingredients (including some walnuts) into a large bowl and tossed before placing on a baking sheet. We increased the cook time to 30 minutes, but probably will decrease to 25 minutes next time.

Not sure how to rate it...I didn't actually try it myself! But my husband and bro in law liked it. And my husband doesn't like Brussells Sprouts usually. He didn't love it, but said of the ways he's had them cooked that he liked this version best. My mom is a sprouts fan, and wasn't sure about the citrus finish. But they went over well enough that I'll try making them again.

Pretty good.  I buy Brussel sprouts two or three times a year for my parrot.  Instead of throwing out the extras, I found this recipe.  Nice mix of flavors.  Great texture.  I predict I will make it two or three times a year.

We forgot to use lemon and we still loved these. My 5 yr old didn't like the brussel sprouts, but that was her first time having them, so I expect her to get used to them eventually. I will probably do 3 apples instead of 2 just because they cook down and the sprouts don't. Plus they're my favorite part of this recipe.

This recipe was AWESOME! I ended up just eating all the Brussels and put the rest of the vegetables over bowtie pasta tossed with butter and garlic salt. It was delicious! I also added red and green pepper to the roasting pan.
