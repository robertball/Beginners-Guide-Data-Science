My family loved this recipe and I was pleased at how fast it all came together. I used 2 cans of soup and 1 cup of sour cream. I boiled the chicken, chopped carrots, peas, and onions all together with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I combined all ingredients, added the cheese, and put it in my baking dish. Since I didn't have any baking mix, I used the recipe from this website for Cheesy Onion Biscuits and it was a hit. Will use this recipe for chicken and biscuits from now on.

This was a yummy and inexpensive recipe my whole family enjoyed.  It tastes similar to a pot pie. I did not unthaw the vegis enough so they were not as soft as my family likes.  I will remember to totally unthaw them next time and then it will be perfect. thanks for sharing this recipe with us.

This was very easy and really good. My only advice? Double the recipe - my family of four devoured it.

Great recipe!  I cooked this for my fiance and two friends, and everyone said it was delicious!  I took another reviewer's advice and added cheese and garlic salt to my biscuits.  I also used a rotisserie chicken - very easy! It must've been good because there weren't any leftovers.

This was very good we made 2 of them 1 for my house and one for my daughter to take to her boyfriends.  Everyone loved them.  it's not like a traditional chicken and biscuits because of all the cheese in it but still very good.  We will be making this again.

I had to customize this recipe for the ingredients I had available. I used frozen broccoli for the veggies and I only had mozzarella cheese. My hubby said it would have been a five if it was served over pasta. I don't eat broccoli, so he rated it:)

excellent and very simple. You could jazz it up with spices you like, but it is fine the way it is.

Very yummy!  I made some changes like adding some onions and milk to the mixture along with using a rotiserrie chicken.  The mixture just seemed too thick even after the sour cream and adding milk helped it become more creamy.  For the biscuits I used biscuick mixed with, parmesan cheese, sour cream, onions, milk and mild cheddar cheese.  Instead of making 6 seperate biscuits I just spread the bisquick mixture over the creamy chicken mixture.  To prevent burning it I put the baking dish on top of a cookie sheet with a 1/4 inch of water.  Since there was so much left over mixture I made a seperate container to freeze and even that turned out great weeks later.  Will definetly make again!!

OMG this is soooo good! My husband, who HATES, with a passion, chicken n biscuits or chicken n dumplings passed by my chair as I was eating and snatched a bite. He then said "What is this? This is delicious!" A+!

Really really good! I used fresh carrots and broccoli (steamed a little bit before adding them to the mix) and I also added about a cup of milk to the soup mixture because it seemed a bit thick otherwise.  Very yummy and easy!

I added fresh garlic, salt, pepper,and parsley to it for some flavor. I also used a can of cream of celery soup. My boyfriend and his dad really liked this dish. Next time I probably won't put cheese in the casserole though.

I like to cook and try new things often.  And out of everything I make, this is the simplest and it is my husbands absolute favorite.  Double the biscuit portion of the recipe.

Mom made this for us when we were kids, only she used Grandma's drop biscuit recipe instead of ready made mix. When I make this now, I use low-fat sour cream, broccoli/cauliflower/mushrooms/onions/garlic instead of the peas/carrots mixture. This is always a quick dinner for those busy days or a great way to use up leftover roast chicken from the day before.

I followed other advice and added milk to thin the mixture a bit.  I didn't add vegetables to the chicken mixture, but served it with homemade green beans.  My husband, who usually doesn't like chicken and dumpling type of recipes, surprisingly liked it a lot.

Really tasty - but not so great as leftovers because the biscuits get soggy :(
