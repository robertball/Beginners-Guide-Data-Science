What a beautiful, simple and tasty appetizer.  I marinated the mozzarella cheese balls to give them more flavor but you can buy them already marinated.  So simple, just purchase the ingredients and assemble, that is it and it only takes a few minutes.  Everyone was impressed by it.

Note, it's much more cost-effective to buy a little rosemary bush rather than pre-cut fresh rosemary. You can usually find these at grocery stores around the holidays. This year I'm doing a 2nd wreath with clusters of green, purple, and red grapes and also apple slices to look like mistletoe.
