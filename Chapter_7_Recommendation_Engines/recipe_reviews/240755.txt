Found this after I couldn't resist buying this nifty looking thing in the store yesterday.  These instructions are so simple, I'm going to try it for making candied ginger tomorrow, to be used in a buddha hand and ginger pound cake.

Amazing!!  I understand that you stated that this can be made with all types of citrus... I was wondering: would this work for pineapple? My husband, aunt, cousins, and mother are are pineapple freaks, and homemade candied pineapple would be a delightful gift idea -- placed in a Halloween tin, put in a pretty candy dish and presented to Thanksgiving dinner host, stocking stuffer, or simply tied in a cellophane bag with bright ribbon to a birthday gift.  If I can't use this recipe for the pineapple, can you suggest a recipe for that?  You rock!!!  Thank you!!!  Love this!!!

I have had a Buddha’s hand tree for a few years and the fruit is fragrant and beautiful, but I’ve never had a use for it until now. I first made this recipe last year, and I used this recipe, as written. I found the candied Buddha’s hand to be very bitter—so much so that I threw it all away. I’m not sure if I did something wrong or my fruit was over ripe?  I haven’t had more fruit to try again until now, so here I am a year later with a new crop. I did some research and decided to add a teaspoon of salt to the blanching water, 1/4(ish) teaspoon of salt to the sugar/water mix, and I picked the fruit while there is still a tinge of green left (prior had been solidly yellow on the tree for a few weeks). The bitterness level has improved a million times and the candied Buddha’s hand turned out beautifully. This is a terrific recipe and the video is quite helpful.

So tasty! Kind of takes you back when you first try it, but pretty addictive once you get used to it.
