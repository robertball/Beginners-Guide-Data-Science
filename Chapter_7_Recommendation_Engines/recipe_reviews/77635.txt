I overcooked the sauce (be careful), but this is definitely a winner.

The kids loved this. I thought it was too oily and lacking flavor. I marinated the chicken for about 24 hours, and that was good, but the sauce had no flavor. Not sure I'd make this again without adjusting the sauce.

This was fine.  It is an easy recipe but not alot of pizzaz.  Broiling it makes it a little dry as well.  I would probably partially cook it in a pan first and then broil the rest of the way.

I have been looking a loooong time for a good Teriyaki chicken recipe and I have finally found it!  This is delicious!  Be sure to use fresh ginger and grate it.  Everyone including three kids devoured this.

This was a great recipe, and so easy.  I marinated the chicken for 2.5 hours.  We did not need the extra sauce, as the chicken was tender and flavorful enough.  My husband loved it, and was disappointed that there wasn't more! I served with steamed broccoli and wild rice.
