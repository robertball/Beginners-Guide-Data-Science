I really liked these. I cheated and used a store bought fig jam (in cheese section). I can't get figs here most of the time. If you go this route, spread the jam thinly, it is sweet and can be overpowering. They were quick and tasty. Watch them though, they are easy to burn as with anything under the broiler. Also, I did not use the oregano. It just didn't seem right.

I served this tonight for company, and it was a hit!  One thought there was too much cinnamon/cloves, but the others wanted the recipe for sure.  I followed the directions as written using both mission and calimyrna figs.  I used Jazz apples rather than Granny Smith.  Be sure to not over bake the plain bread before adding the other ingredients, and I thought it was good to have the brie at room temp.  Excellent appetizer!  Thanks for making me look like a real pro, ShannonMcK!

Holy moly these are delicious! I made these for breakfast, and my husband and I loved them! The only thing I didn't do is puree the spread; I don't think it needed it. The flavors meld so nicely. Yum! It's a keeper!

I made this for my annual New Year's Day open house and it was a hit! My "regulars" to the party said it needs to be on the menu every year so I'm making it again this year. I'm always in a hurry for party prep so I took a short cut and used Dalmatia Fig Spread instead of making the fig jam from scratch. It tasted awesome and saved me that step. This is a staple for my entertaining from now on.

Nice recipe. May be a little too sweet with both the brown sugar and the figs. I may try reducing the brown sugar next time. All in all this was a great starter for dinner.

This was great and simple to make. I made it Christmas Eve and it was a hit!
