i was not impresed with the recipe. The icing was too thin to spread on all the cupcakes without falling through the holes in between where the cupcakes did not touch. i ended up adding a lot more icing sugar to the frosting to thicken it up. The end result looked okay, but it was more of a hassle than anything.
