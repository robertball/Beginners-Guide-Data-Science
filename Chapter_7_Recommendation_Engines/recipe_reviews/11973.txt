It's a great recipe with some modifications.

An Italian friend of mine who cooks told me that the proper way to make smooth Carbonara sauce is to combine the beaten eggs with the grated parmesan, and then to pour that mixture onto the spaghetti once the spaghetti has cooled slightly (so that it's still hot, but so that the eggs don't cook and the cheese melts seamlessly into the eggs and pasta). I tried that, and the sauce was unbelievably creamy!

A few other changes I made - I used less pasta, pancetta instead of bacon, and grated a brick of fresh Parmigiano-Reggiano for a sharper flavour - so that was about 3 cups of grated cheese instead of 1 cup. The final product was full of flavour and my guests wanted seconds - and no need to add salt. I didn't use wine because I didn't have any at the moment, but next time I will - it will probably add some interesting dimension.

Also tips on reheating in microwave - if it's on a high setting, it will cook the egg and the pasta will solidify. I reheat mine on medium heat so the sauce stays creamy.

SandyT. here -- thanks for all the positive reviews!  This recipe is a home adaptation of one from Angeli Restaurant in Los Angeles (where I was pastry chef for four years).  The original recipe used cured, unsmoked Italian pancetta bacon (which is delicious if you can find it).  Myself, I use applewood smoked American bacon, and usually double the amount in the recipe.  All your suggestions (adding cream, peas, mushrooms, etc., or omitting things) are great, because cooking should constantly evolve, depending on the cook.  Please continue to let your personal tastes be your guide!

Okay, I have to laugh, too, when people say, "I love it!  Now let me modify it!"  This dish is my all-time favorite, and this recipe is simply oustanding!  I've never found a recipe online that I thought approached my own version, til now.  But (you were waiting for that). . .someone asked for something different.  Three things I do different:  bacon, cream, and nutmeg.  I do half-bacon, half ground mild italian sausage, and set it all aside for later.  When doing the "quick combine" at the end, I add about 3/4 cup heavy cream, at room temp.  And to finish it, about 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. nutmeg.  Overall, it richens it quite a bit, adds to the fat content (no kidding?), but "warms up" the flavor in a really rich, winter-night sort of way.  Thanks for this terrific (and correct) version of this recipe, Sandy.

This is a near perfect and flawless recipe for the classic Spaghetti alla Carbonara. And even it it wasn't, who cares? It's darn good, which is really the only thing that matters. Traditionally this is made with pancetta (an Italian style bacon) but I actually prefer it this way, with regular ol' bacon! Just one suggestion--to ensure a creamy, silky sauce, mix the cheese and beaten eggs together before stirring into the pasta, off heat. Really nothing else to fiddle with or change here, because this is just delicious stuff!

This was outstanding!  I took one of the other reviewers' tips, and so I added 3/4 cup of heavy cream and a little fresh nutmeg.  I also doubled the amount of bacon.  It was sinfully delicious and even my kids were going on and on about how the dinner 'rocked'!  Definitely company worthy also.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Neither my wife nor I had tried this dish before, so we weren't sure what to expect.  Wow...was this good!  Here are the changes I made: added 1 egg and an extra clove of garlic (omitted the wine); cooked the bacon, added onions, then the garlic; mixed the eggs with the parmesan cheese; drained the spaghetti and added it to a large bowl, then added the bacon/onion/garlic mixture (be sure to scrape in the drippings, then toss), finally added the egg mixture and tossed well. Served with parmesan and chopped parsley on top. This is definitely a new favorite.

I gave it 3* because I think the ratio of pasta may be too much.  

Quick hints...upon beating the eggs, try putting some dry Italian seasoning.  I used a teaspoon of Mrs. Dash mixed in with the eggs.  Great aroma to the dish.
To combat the dryness, load up on the olive oil and squeeze in 1/2 a lemon into the mixture.  
Fresh basil works wonders for all you folks looking for that "zing" or feel that the pasta was lacking or missing something.  Overall, not bad, but few modifications to suit your taste.  But I agree to all out there that used less pasta in the dish.  The mixture of the flavors has a very soft taste and with the right porportion of pasta would make it even more flavorful.
Best of luck to all.  Keep sending those ideas!

My husband is a carbonara snob and loved this - I did use pancetta, however.  I think ideas to modify a recipe are very flattering to the Chef who presented it.  It's good enough to make it someone elses dish - which is wonderful about this website.  Definitely the cream and yes nutmeg, but adding sausage?  It is no longer traditional carbonara, but hey... whatever floats your gondola!

THIS is exactly the recipe I've been looking for! I kept trying to get carbonara right, and it never quite made it. This recipe was perfect. I took the other reviewers' suggestions about the cream, but didn't want to leave out the wine, so I put 2 tbsp of white wine and 2 tbsp of cream. It was exquisite!

This recipe is awesome!  My husband who claims to dislike carbonara ate it up.  The only change I made is I added a handful of green peas.  Definately a keeper!

Finally, a carbonara recipe that recognizes that once you add cream, it is no longer carbonara but alfredo!  I can't tell you how many times I've been disappointed going to a restaurant that advertises their alfredo with peas and bacon as "carbonara".

Carbonara isn't supposed to be saucy, it's supposed to have the egg and cheese more like a coating.  If folks want to add cream to theirs because they prefer it that way, that's perfectly fine, it's just not carbonara anymore.  

This recipe is very similar to mine, I don't use wine in mine, but I can see it having a nice effect on the flavor.

This was okay, but the traditional way is better: saute onion and bacon or pancetta (with fresh parsley and basil) in olive oil. Boil and drain noodles, and toss noodles and bacon/onion mixture together with a mixture of 2 egg YOLKS, a few tablespoons of reserved pasta cooking water, lemon zest, salt and pepper, and then add butter and parmesan and toss together. Traditional recipe uses NO garlic - the sweetness of the onions should dominate, and the lemon zest and basil give it that extra kick. The butter, egg yolk, and pasta water mixture makes the sauce unbelievably creamy, and it coats the noodles perfectly.

This is almost exactly my recipe for carbonara ingredient wise.  I mix the eggs, parmesan and spices together first and let this sit however.  Once the bacon is cooked I remove most of the fat add the onion and garlic and saute adding the wine at the end.  The bacon mixture is then poured into the hot pasta and mixed quickly followed by the egg mixture.  It is absolutely delicious and my friends say its the best they have ever had.  
I have made this hundreds of times and NEVER had a problem with the egggs not cooking so the previous reviewer can rest easy.  The pasta needs to be hot, right from the colander.  Enjoy this one.  Its a winner.

I think this recipe is terrific.  The only thing that I would comment upon is the lack of emphasis upon using fresh ground black pepper.  The dish, a la Carbonara, (carbon or coal) in Italy comes from the generous use of freshly ground (somewhat course, at least not fine) black pepper that gives  the dish its characteristic bite and appearance.  That was what I found in Italy, at least.  Also, I would not object to the use of cream sparingly although as one reviewer pointed out, that is not a part of the original recipe and if used the amount used should certainly not be enough to turn it into an Alfredo.  That would be a shame as the pepper and the bacon combine into a divine taste experience that in my opinion should not be dulled with too much cream.  Sometimes depending upon the consistency of the final dish I may add more finely grated Parmesan from a fresh chunk.

I love Carbonara, and this recipe was delicious!  I lightened it up some (par usual) by cutting the eggs back to 2 and making up the difference in liquid by subbing 1/4 C skim milk and 1/4 C cream for the lost eggs.  Same richness, a lot less cholesterol!  I also wilted a couple ounces of spinach after sauteing the onion and garlic with the wine because I needed to use it up!  It was a wonderful addition to this, which most leafy greens are (kale or escarole works well too).  Also, I used turkey bacon rather than pork, another norm for me.  One tip for those who are new to this dish: the recipe directions state that you should "cook until eggs are just set".  Carbonara really should not "set".  The egg mixture (eggs, cream, milk, cheese, salt, and pepper) should be added once the pasta mixture has been removed from the heat for a few minutes and cooled slightly, then put back on the burner and heated through on low heat, until the sauce is shiny and glistening, almost the consistency of a thin alfredo sauce, NOT set like scrambled eggs!

Very enjoyable recipe.  The only change I made was to add 1/2 cream to the scrambled eggs.  I also just used the starchy water from the spaghetti in lieu of the wine.  I didn't start cooking the noodles until the bacon was out of the pan, and the onions were more than opaque.  If you let the noodles cool they will start to dry out and lead to a dry overall dish.  Plus, if the noodles are cool, you'll have to cook over heat to make sure the eggs are safe.  Wait to cook the noodles!   Time it, so that you drain them just after step 2.  Then add noodles, egg, cheese and remove from heat.  My dish was very creamy, and not at all dry.

I followed the recipe almost exactly - the proportions seemed like it made a huge amount, so I cut it in half. The result was the perfect amount for a light meal for me and my husband with no leftovers. I didn't have bacon but I did have bacon fat - and I discovered that if you have the fat from fantastic bacon, you don't miss the meat! And I mixed the grated parmesan in with the beaten egg. The result was an absolutely luxurious, rich and incredibly simple meal. Whoever is adding cream and nutmeg to this recipe is so off track - if you want heavy alfredo sauce do that. If you want pasta that tastes like you're at a little table in a tiny Roman bistro, do this recipe and don't mess with it. My only quibble is next time I'll do it the *really* right way with some good pancetta and not bacon. Bacon is good here, but pancetta would be great. This, with some roasted vegetables tossed in olive oil on the side and a bottle of good wine will do any marriage a world of good!

I am eating this one as I write. Superb. I reduced the amount of spaghetti by 1/4 per suggestions. I also invested in grating my own pecorino romano cheese for the mix at twice the  amount called for which would be a cup (half a wedge works out to about $2.50). Another investment was the 1/4 lb. pancetta to replace the 8 slices bacon.($2.68 as opposed to ?). Once it was finished I did sprinkle freshly grated Wisconsin Parmesan on top. This was rich enough that I cannot see the need for the addition of cream. That would be overkill. Oh, and the fresh parsley? Do not risk getting in a traffic accident rushing to the store if you have none on hand. I am truly savoring this as I type. Thumbs up! Thanks Sandy.

Yummy! Combine your eggs w/ the parm cheese and Make sure to remove from heat before stirring in your eggs & parm cheese. I added in 1 cup frozen peas (cook in your pasta water the last 3 minutes w/ your spaghetti) Also the addition of 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg really makes this dish scrumptious!

Was pretty good.  I over cooked it on accident, so it was not oily/creamy like I think it was supposed to be.  I also added peas, I bet mushrooms will be good.

If you ad the eggs to the drained hot pasta and then stir till coated well and put the lid on the pot and let set for a few mins, it turns out amazing!
I grew up on a version of this with a stick of melted butter, orageno and bacon! It was my moms cheap dinner for a huge family!

YUM!!!  This was the first time I made Carbonara.  I didn't know about the eggs and really questioned if I wanted to do it at all.  But I had the ingredients and did it!  I pretty much followed the directions. I might have use a bit more bacon.  I also didn't have onion so used 4 shallots.  I followed some advise of other chefs and mixed my parmesan with my eggs.  I also added a little cream since I had it in the fridge and needed to use it up!  I finally added frozen peas right at the end.  This was amazing!  LOVED IT! My husband told me to make this over and over again!!!  Thank you so much for this recipe!

One comment.  I know that alot people don't like when you change up recipes.  But I find that when I am missing an ingredient, I like to read and see if someone substituted and if it works.  I think it is great to add individual interpretations of a recipe as long as it follows the orginial concept.

EXCELLENT! I've made this for a long time but just never reviewed it before. Like so many others, I too mix my cheese into the eggs and allow the heat of the pasta to cook the eggs. For some added richness (like it needs it), I did use up about 1/4 C. sour cream that I had too. Actually mixed that with the eggs and cheese & blended til smooth. Additional parmesan at the table and we were set. Such a classic pasta dish that is a family favorite.

I used 1 cup of grated Parmesan instead of a 1/2 cup and I didn't use wine. I added a couple of ladles of the starchy pasta water to the bacon, onion, and garlic mixture before tossing in the pasta. The addition of the water made the extra olive oil to coat the pasta unnecessary. I mixed the Parmesan cheese and the beaten eggs together before adding it to the pasta.

I have never made spaghetti carbonara before, but I have heard about it and know that the trick is to not overcook the eggs. I think I managed to do a decent job with this recipe! We really loved this dish and I will definitely make it again. I made it healthier by using turkey bacon. Since turkey bacon doesn't give off as much fat, I subbed with olive oil. I also used only half the amount of pasta (less carbs, more protein) and used a gluten-free quinoa-corn blend spaghetti. I was so consumed with the eggs, I forgot to season with salt and pepper, but we didn't miss it at all. I added the eggs and parm, then immediately removed it from the heat.

I was very worried when trying this new recipe because in the pictures it didnt seem like there was a lot of sauce. It was AMAZINGLY tasty!!! I would DEFINITELY recommend this to anyone who enjoys spaghetti, bacon, and eggs! I know it may sound weird but these ingredients together worked great!! I followed the recipe EXACTLY and was wonderful!

This dish is awesome!!  I followed advice of previous reviewers and mixed the egg and cheese first before adding.  I also added a drained can of diced tomatoes to try to get SOME nutrition in there :)  But it was so tasty, my husband says I'm not allowed to tweak it anymore...

Great last-minute-dinner-guests dish!  With the possible exception of the white wine (which is optional anyway), the rest of the ingredients are things most average cooks have on hand.  With garden salad or steamed broccoli as a side, you can't lose!  BTW, sauteed zucchini tastes great in this! As suggested by another reviewer, mix the parmesan with the beaten eggs before adding to the hot noodles and do NOT cook. The hot noodles will cook the egg enough and will give it a creamy texture thereby omitting the need to add cream as others have suggested.   If you cook it after adding the parmesan and egg, it curdles and looks like scrambled eggs and noodles.   A flourless chocolate cake would make a great fianale to this fantastic meal!

We love this meal with chicken and peas added... Don't add the eggs to the pot/cook on stove.. Instead, mix the eggs, Parmesan, parsley, and then add cooked noodles to the eggs.. otherwise you risk ending up with spaghetti and scrambled eggs.

Very good, solid reindition of an Italian classic. You may want to add a splash of cream, stock, or white wine at the end if you find the mixture too dry (I used half-and-half).  Also, I added the beaten eggs to the pasta right after cooking it, to let the residual heat cook the eggs (instead of re-heating the pasta at the end).  This works beautifully, and saves a step.  Just be sure to have the bacon-onion mixture ready by the time the pasta is done, and toss it right in.  Overall a very yummy recipe :)

I don't modify a thing when I make this. I won over my girlfriend with this meal. The secret is in the ingredients. Fresh bacon from your butcher counter and grate high quality parmesan wedges yourself and you'll taste the amazingness. Thank you so much.

I'd give this recipe 5 stars, however a crucial step was left out.  After my own experience, followed up by many YouTube "how-tos", it is imperative that you remove the bacon/onion/garlic/white wine/pasta mixture from the heat BEFORE adding the egg and parmesan mixture.  If you don't do this, the egg will scramble instead of becoming a creamy sauce.  In fact, the Italian YouTube videos I watched take the pasta, mix it into the bacon, onion, etc mixture, then pour it into a separate bowl that holds the egg and cheese mixture.  This will be my approach next time.  Flavors were great even so....

A great recipe - and totally authentic {NO america you don't need to add CREAM}!  freshly grated parm, cracked pepper, crushed reds and extra parsely to finish send it right over the top.  (I keep bacon frozen and just slice crosswise off of the end - then you have everything on hand when people come to your house after the bar)!  also great with sauteed zucchini, peppers etc for vegetarians or if you're out of bacon...   thanks again!

I always save a cup of the pasta  water, just in case I need to thin the sauce, instead of adding more calories with cream or more oil.  I also only use the yolks, 6-8 of them, and at least 3/4 cup of fresh grated parmesan...delish!!

I love this recipe.  I've been making it for over two years and my daughter still asks for it all the time.  It's easy and it tastes delicious.  I'm a horrible cook so I don't change recipes, it would surely end up worse.  This is actually something I can cook and it still tastes good!

I'm sorry, but all you guys who are adding peas, mushrooms and even vodka sauce? to this dish are crazy. This is the classic version of carbonara. No Cream! The eggs are what hold the dish together and give it it's natural richness. If you want the TV dinner cream dish, use another recipe!

This is very close to what I had in Italy, after I added cherry tomatoes to the recipe.  They are the last thing I put in before serving. It adds just the right texture and flavor to the dish.

This meal was so wonderful and VERY economical! It needs to go in the 10 meals for $10...it was less than that. I used a whole pound of bacon, fried crispy, and cut into very small pieces so there would be pieces in each bite!! Make sure you taste before you add too much of the Parmesan...it really can DRY out the recipe.Pre-measure and prep all ingredients b4 you start, it moves fast! Not good for re-heating. Will add this to my box!!

Delicious!  We loved it.  We used a bag of precooked bacon from Coscto and just put it in the pan to warm instead of fry.  Make sure to NOT use reduced fat parmesan cheese.  Stir in egg quickly or it becomes a solid egg.  
I added olive oil to each prepared plate at the end because it was too dry.

Tasted reasonably good, but it's not spaghetti carbonara, which uses pancetta, not bacon (pancetta is a cured, non-smoked bacon), no wine, no onions, no garlic. Having actual bacon, as well as those add-ins, changes the flavor significantly. True Spaghetti alla carbonara features few ingredients, and leaves an uncomplicated taste. Now that said, this dish is really quite tasty, and worth your time to make. It's filling, inexpensive, and appealing.

Perfection.  99% of cooks in America have each of these ingredients lying around anyway, so its the perfect "Quick Dinner" that has a great comfort-food taste...  yes, you can replace pancetta for the bacon (make it more authentic), but it's still great nonetheless.  It's not necessary to add cream either, unlike many other recipes... when combining the parmesan and eggs in one, it gives a magical creaminess that will make you trying to figure out "how can it be so creamy without cream?"... don't worry and just enjoy!

The ratio of pasta to sauce was way off. Either half the pasta or double everything in the sauce. Unfortunately no one in the house liked it. I thought the Fettuccini Carbonara on this site was much better.

Fantastic.  I love everyone's suggestions.  The only one I have to add is instead of adding more oil when/if your pasta dries out - just save some of the pasta water and use that.  There's enough fat going on in this recipe already!

This has become a staple in our family dinners.  The kids will beg for it and my husband and I thoroughly enjoy it.    Im from the south, so I do things a little differently.  I skip the the olive oil and use the bacon grease  that frying 8 slices of bacon provides.  I sautee the onion and garlic in the bacon grease.    Once the pasta is al denta, I drain it and lightly coat my pasta in a few TBSP of the bacon grease so my pasta wont stick together.  Then I add my wine to my grease, onion, garlic and saute for a few minutes and follow the rest of the directions verbatim.  Granted my directions kill the healthiness but its worth the compromise for the amazing taste.  PS:  Dont skip the wine.  I have made it with and without the wine.  This recipe really does need the wine.

My chicken didn't defrost in time for dinner tonight so I came to Allrecipes to find a quick, easy dinner.  I didn't have bacon, so I made this vegetarian. It was still absolutely fabulous. Creamy and delicious and easy.  I doubled the parm cheese and mixed the eggs and parm before adding to the hot pasta as suggested by another reviewer.  So much creamier than the carbornara recipe I usually use! I also saved some of the hot water that that pasta was cooked in to thin out the finished product since it was initially very thick instead of adding olive oil.  I've always made my carbornara this way with the hot pasta liquid.  Save some unnecessary fat! All of my kids devoured this.  Next time I'll add the bacon (morningstar veggie bacon, that is).  Thanks for the recipe :)

Outstanding and easy. I did a whole package of bacon. Chopped raw and cooked it 2nd. Washed off the spaghetti noodles with cold water before mixing with beaten eggs and parm. cheese, and SLOWLY simmered it to being warm again. (Like others said, else the eggs will cook.) Thank you for sharing your recipe and all who contributed their techniques.  I see it continues to be a hit after so many years.

I made this the other night for my family my teenaged  kids loved it so much that my husband didn't get a chance to try it.  I used herb flavoured tortellini instead of spaghetti because I had some in the fridge and wanted to use it up.  I didn't use wine because I didn't have any, instead I used chicken broth.  I found that I had to use more then the recipe called for.  I added the egg right after I drained the pasta and the egg cooked up so my pasta had litttle bits of scrambled eggs in it.  One other reviewer suggested letting the pasta cool a little then add the egg and cheese mixed together into the pasta.  Next time I'll try this method to see if the pasta comes out creamy. I also didn't feel the need to add the extra salt called for maybe because of the chicken stock even though I used low salt stock.  If this had turned out creamy I would have given it 5 stars. I made this recipe again tonight and it turned out better than the first time. I added 3 cloves of garlic. I let the pasta cool a little so that it wasn't so hot and it turned out a lot creamier instead of having bits of scrambled egg in the pasta.  I had white wine this time still had to use a little more then the recipe called for but it added another layer of flavour much better then using broth or water.  I had left over roasted chicken (about 1 1/2 cups) so I added that in to just before adding the hot pasta and the rest of the cheese.  Family loved it.  Will make again.

I've never had spaghetti carbonara before so I didn't know exactly what to expect. I was nervous about the raw eggs, but it turned out really good. I doubled the amounts of cheese and garlic. I also followed other's suggestions by mixing the egg and cheese together before adding them to the pasta. I removed the pasta from the heat before adding the egg mixture and the sauce was very creamy. There wasn't any scrambling.

Not a do over for us. Too many eggs - not creamy enough - even after adding cream. Unimpressed.

I was surprised that this spaghetti carbonara was comparable to some that I've had in Rome. (However, did not compare to the best carbonara I've had, which was in Florence - ah, memories). I did not add the white wine. Also, I was confused about reserving the 2t. bacon grease - I thought it meant to add later. I ended up adding it at some point later, and it still turned out fine. Now I see that it means drain all bacon grease excpet for 2t. and proceed w/ recipe. I will do this next time.

I just made this. The only thing I did different was to add a bit of the water I boiled the pasta in. It makes it more creamy but but without the calories.

Great way to stretch a dollar.  I eyeballed everything and added some sauteed sliced chicken breast and 1 inch blanched asparagus pieces (thrown in with the pasta for the last 20 seconds).

The flavor was great but the ratio of sauce to pasta was not right. Next time, I am going to either increase the sause or decrease the pasta.

This recipe was Awesome!!!!! Here are some changes I made to the recipe (these were suggested by others who have made the recipe before). I doubled the amount of bacon. In step 3 after returning the bacon back to the pan and adding the spaghetti, I then added 3/4 of heavy whipping cream (at room temp) and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg stirring until mixed. Then I mixed the 4 eggs and 1/4 parm together before adding to spaghetti & bacon mixture. also didnt add any extra salt of pepper. It tasted great the way it was. I didnt add any parsley at the end because I didnt have any but I'm sure it would be yummy. This was a huge hit & maybe a new favorite!!

I made this with only one major change, Asiago cheese instead of parmesan.  The Asiago is a softer cheese with a full flavor that I've become addicted to.  This was fabulous with it.  Thank you for a recipe that we will have often!

Well, I must say, it was pretty delicious. My husband even informed me it was pretty much as good as a very famous Italian restaurant that begins with an "M". I did use pasta water in place of wine but that was the only change I made. We're all pretty fat and happy right now. Thanks so much for the recipe! :)

Not for me-- I like the more classic carbonara -- that is bacon/onions, Parm & cream thickend with an egg yolk. -- I have made it also with out the egg & just reduced the cream more.  I like more sauce

This was good and simple...just what I like!  Hubby had never had anything like this, and he approved as well.  I lightened it up with turkey bacon; next time I will use EggBeaters instead of eggs.  I also used whole wheat pasta.  I forgot to add the parsley, but it was good without it.  Paired it with a blue cheese bruschetta from this site, and steamed broccoli.  Can't wait to have it again!

Ingredients are fine.  The preparation was less desirable.  Adding the cooked pasta to the pan to heat through so the eggs can be cooked has a side affect of making the noodles overcooked and the dish drier that desired.   
A better approach is to add the eggs and cheese to a large bowl, and pour in the pasta, fresh from being drained and mix.  The eggs cook with with the heat from the still hot noodles.  Then add cooked bacon/onion mixture and combine.

This recipe was delicious!  We loved it and will be adding it to our arsenal.  I used a whole package of bacon (12oz.) and added some fresh chopped tomato along with the parsley.  This was just a really good meal and not difficult.  Yum!

I made this "almost" exactly as written except I think I used a bit more (like double) of the parmesan cheese and I mixed it with the eggs before adding to the pasta as recommended by another reviewer and it came out nice and creamy. REALLY good... I only gave it four stars because I was comparing it to a great little Italian restaurant called Dante's in a little town in NH (Barrington, NH to be exact, if you are ever in the area GO THERE! You won't regret it! And Calef's is right around the corner!!!). Their version is AMAZING and it makes you moan at every bite. I usually eat it until I can't move. They call it "The Widow Maker" for good reason!

Wow this was bland, it needs something else. I followed directions step by step, it was creamy like people said but, we didn't care for this dish :( I usually like everything, I'm not a picky eater but the thought of under cooked eggs is unappealing to me.

This meal was very tasty.  My very picky family enjoyed it very much.  I did however make lighter version.  I used lean turkey bacon and egg beaters.   It still came out fantastic

Okay...yum! I made a carbonara recipe maybe twenty years ago and just hated it, but this one caught my eye and I decided to try again. So good! I don't cook with wine so I used a splash of apple cider to help get the yummy bits off the bottom of the pan, then I took the advice of some reviewers and beat the eggs and cheese together up front. I also added cream as recommended. The sauce was delicious, and I am saving a bowl of this for tomorrow betting it will be even better!

I followed the recipe like one of the previous reviews had suggested and the sauce came out really creamy. The only thing I did different was add crushed red pepper flakes because we love spicy carbonara. Very good!

Let me start this review by saying this was my very first attempt at making Spaghetti Carbonara.  My husband and I enjoyed this dish, but felt that there was just something missing.  We had the absolute BEST pasta carbonara in Venice last summer, and we were trying to find something close to it....unfortunately, this wasn't it.  I think we like the pasta and sauce to be more creamy than it turned out with this recipe.  All in all, we liked it okay, but weren't WOWED by it.

I understand recipes evolve.As they evolve you cannot call them the same. This adds to confusion and people not trying things as they were written. 
I feel a recipe should be made as originally written. After you understand the relationship of the ingredients, then you can experiment. You can use the pasta water to help to make the egg mixture creamier and assist in cooking the eggs. 
I find it amusing to see the ratings of the recipes. Since people always change them. It's a different meal.

I gave this 2 stars because my husband liked it but i was really disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly and the recipe came out bland, greasy and sticky. I even added more olive oil as the recipe suggested. The flavor wasnt bad....there just wasnt ANY flavor at all; despite the bacon and parm cheese it wasnt even salty. I won't be making this again :-\

This was awesome!  I had about 1/3 c frozen peas that I've been trying to use up, so I threw those in the colander and drained the hot noodles over them to thaw without cooking too much.  I was a little worried, as it was difficult to tell when the eggs had set, so I left it on low heat while tossing everything together.  My husband loved it, and I'm definitely making this when the in-laws visit!

I roughly scaled this recipe down for 2 people.  My bf and I just returned from several weeks in Italy, and this was our first time attempting carbonara ever.  Besides me undercooking the pasta slightly (I expected it to cook more as I mixed it with the meat and sauce), the flavor was really good.  I used proscuitto instead of bacon, and prepared it the same way, although there wasn't much fat leftover, which didn't matter.  I found that I didn't need to add any salt at all, since the proscuitto and cheese were salty enough and I had salted the water I boiled the pasta in.  My only complaint is that it cooled very quickly as I was mixing the beaten eggs in.  First they kinda started to cook b/c the pan was hot, so I stirred more vigorously to coat, but then when I ate the pasta, it was cooler than lukewarm.  Any suggestions from people on how to mix in the beaten eggs without cooking them into scrambled-eggs-with-pasta without cooling the dish too much?  I didn't add onion or white wine.  It tasted fine without.

This is excellent!!  My husband was a die-hard red sauce fan.  Now, when I make this I have to make lots so there is plenty of leftovers!! I made it the first time using parmesean cheese in a jar and the second time using fresh grated parmesean.  We preferred the jar kind - it had more flavor!!

We loved this dish. My changes... I don't eat bacon so I used one half lb. diced turkey ham cooked until lightly browned. I used about half the oil and just three eggs. These changes considerably reduced the fat. I admit it was not creamy or saucy but we liked the texture and flavor. Allrecipes is so helpful! I wanted to make a carbonara, did a quick search and scanned the recipes, decided on this one, printed it up, all in the four minutes it took my turkey ham to defrost in the microwave. I had dinner ready in less than 15 minutes!

Great recipe!  The only thing I changed was to use 5 egg Yolks only (Not whites), which enhances the rich texture of the sauce.

Just like momma used to make it! I added a package of sliced mushrooms to it, and a wee bit more bacon than called for. Freezes pretty well, too.  Yum, yum, yum.  :)

This recipe is great! It's the best Spaghetti Carbonara recipe I've ever tried. It's easy, and the instructions are very clear. I have to admit, however, that it took me longer than 20 minutes to prepare; more like 30 or 35 minutes.

Followed recipe for the most part, but added nutmeg and maybe 1T 1/2 and 1/2 thinking it would be more creamy, but still disappointed in the creaminess of it.  May try it again, changing some things up and give it one more shot!

Okay recipe. A whole onion is way too much. It overpowers the dish. I would reduce the chopped onion to 1/4 cup if I made this again.

I used a method from a Fine Cooking recipe that calls for tempering the egg/cheese mixture with a 1/4 cup of the hot pasta water before adding it to the skillet.  It came out perfectly creamy, certainly no need for any cream.

I first ate spaghetti carbonara at a small little hole in the wall, called Bella's in Frankfurt, Germany in the early 80's, it was amazing, but I would tweak this recipe, to more resemble Bella's. try omitting the wine, instead use 1 cup of heavy cream, and use a nice lean ham instead of the bacon

I made this recipe to the last ingredient.  There was to much pasta and not enought sause!!  However, this will be a work in process. The way it is now, it's very bland.  It needs more parmesan cheese !!!!!!!

I had no idea what to make for  the first time that my in-laws came over for dinner (my husband and I are into more gourmet/exotic/creative recipes, my in-laws are very much meat and potatoes) so I thought I'd give this recipe a shot and pray that it worked out. Thankfully, it did. This recipe passed with flying colors! I took the suggestion of other reviewers and combined the parmesan with the eggs and added them after the pasta had cooled slightly, and it was fantastic. This was so much easier to make than I could have anticipated, I don't know why I'd never made it before but I will be making it again! :)

Halved the recipe, but used 5 slices of bacon instead of 4 (Is there such a thing as too much bacon?), and 2 cloves of garlic.  Added a pinch of dried oregano, basil and thyme. Did not use the wine.  Adults and kids gave it a thumbs us.  This is incredibly creamy and filling, and easier to make that I thought it would be.  Will be making this again many times over

Just went to Rome earlier this month and tried this. I loved it so much, so when I came home, I just had to find a recipe. There are quite a few recipes out there, so I looked at the ingredient list and picked a few that sounded most like what I had. I decided to give this one a try because the directions sounded easy. I thought it tasted exactly what I had in Rome. I didn't use wine or onions because I don't like either. It tasted amazing! If you're feeding a family, this amount would probably be enough, but for just 2 people, halve the recipe. Also, if you're making the full amount, I would get a bigger frying pan. I'm using a standard size, and it was difficult tossing the spaghetti (over and over and over- your arm definitely gets a workout) without making a mess. May have to invest in a larger skillet just to make this :)

This was a good recipe. However, I like a little more bacon in my carbonara sauce and (just) slightly less onion and white wine. The wine and onion was a little strong and overpowered the bacon's flavor and taste. Although, this did not take away from the recipe as a whole. I have made numerous Carbonara recipes and the ingredients with this particular recipe were much better than most others. I would suggest this recipes to friends and family. Enjoy.

Loved it!  Husband raved about it and kids devoured it!!!  After pasta finished cooking gave a cool water rinse. Put in pan with bacon and onion and then mixed the egg and 1 and 1/2 cups of Parmesan together and then added to pasta.  Came out perfect, restaurant quality without the price!

This was delicious, but I have to admit I was a little weirded out by the egg. There is no way I could eat this leftover. However, I'll make this again when I have a few more people to eat it because I really enjoyed it.

We double the bacon and triple the parmesan and quintuple the bacon fat and then we gobble.  It's pure pleasure from a pan.  Oh yeah.

I like the Lean Cuisine version so I thought I'd give the "real thing" a try.  Even without real Italian bacon or fresh parsley, this dish tasted amazing.  I took the advice of some of the other cooks who mixed the cheese with the eggs.  I also added my freeze-dried parsley so that it would have time to rehydrate a bit.  I didn't add wine but next time I will probably use broth because the end result is a little sticky.  I will DEFINITELY make this again!  I bet it would taste great with broccoli or mushrooms.

Fantastic!!!!! Loved Loved it. I added 3 cloves garlic instead of one, didn't add the wine (my friend drank all my white wine), I tempered my eggs in warm water for 5 min. before putting them in my bowl and I too added my parmesan cheese to my eggs. Added more olive oil then called for and about 1 cup of parmesan cheese. Next time I make it I will add the wine. Thank you Sabrinatee for the wonerful recipe. I will be sharing this with my friends and family.

Just not sure what the fuss is about.  Okay dish and followed the recipe to a T.  My hubby and twin 14 year olds said it wasn't their favorite.  I would say lacking butter and lemon was key.

RE: Salmonella... my mother has been making true Carbonara like this for me since I was a child (carbonara in restaurants has more of a rich alfredo sauce)... we never worried about salmonella and have never experienced it... I do use 2 eggs as opposed to 4, a lot of it is in the timing... have the bacon sauce ready and make sure the minute you drain your pasta you are ready to toss it with the sauce and coat with the eggI do this all in the pot on the burner that has just been turned off or on very low to temper the egg as it is added

Oh, my goodness. Delish!!!  I've never had this before but it sounded easy to make.  My entire family LOVED it, except for my picky husband who hates onions. Everyone else had seconds.  I didn't add the wine because I didn't have any. I also didn't add salt.  I took the advice of others and did add a little half n half at the end to make it more creamy, and I added probably twice the bacon just because I had already cooked it all up.
This is going to be a regular in my line up.  Garlic bread and salad and it's a great meal!

2017 I was pleased with the creaminess and general mild flavor that didn't compete with my sweet potato side dish. I used 3/4 c heavy cream for increasing creaminess and I only had canned parmesan.  Next time, I will consider adding Italian sausage, sweet red bell peppers and white wine.

11/2018 I made it again and it was SO delicious! I poured on a big splash of olive oil, used a whole pound of bacon, added red bell peppers-- chopped small but not fine, and also remembered the white wine (it really made a delicious difference!). Lastly,  I got mixed up with my dinner plan and poured on a big helping of heavy cream, but there was nothing wrong with the outcome! It was a delectable dinner win!

This was so creamy and oh so yummy. I added diced chicken breast and extra bacon pieces. I also mixed the Parmesan cheese in with the beaten eggs before adding it to the pasta. I skipped the white wine, didn't use any salt for flavor. Family loved it! I will definitely make this again, thanks!

From age 2 through 29, we all liked this dinner.  I followed the recipe as I should except I added a lil heavy creamer and mushroom.  This had a rich taste, the wine really set off the dish.  I think this would be great with some sauteed shrimp or grilled chicken even.  Thanks for the great grub!

LOVED IT!! Incredibly easy and delicious!   I made 3 small changes. While the onions were sauteing, I added sliced baby bella mushrooms. They added flavor, texture and a bit more protein to the dish. Also, as recommended in other reviews, I combined the eggs and cheese (I had an 5-cheese Italian Blend on hand) together with 3/4c half&half before adding to spaghetti and tossing with tongs. I then added the onion/garlic/mushroom mixture back in and tossed. It made a deliciously creamy sauce that was milder than straight Parmesan would have been.   Definitely going on my list of quick and easy meals! I always have these ingredients in my kitchen, save the half&half.  I fed myself and 2 mid-20s males (who could eat me out of house and home) and still had leftovers to take to work!

My first time making this, and it came out perfect. Followed suggestions from other reviewers and mixed the parmesan cheese with the eggs before adding it to the SLIGHTLY COOLED pasta. No scrambled eggs= success!

I love carbonara but I was afraid that if I ever tried to make it, I'd end up with a scrambled, eggy mess. I practically followed this to tee, except I added in the parmesan cheese with the beaten egg as suggested by another reviewer.  It turned our perfect and delicious.  This is a keeper.

This is really good considering that it's so simple to put together.  I followed the directions exactly, except that I only had 2 eggs.  I can't imagine that it would be as good without the dry wine.  Also, if I make it again I will only use the fat from the bacon rather than adding additional olive oil.  Thanks for the recipe!

Tasty and easy to throw together.  I doubled the sauce and added a cup of heavy cream which I feel was just the right amount - can't imagine how dry it would have been with the sauce as called for.  Also combined the eggs, cheese and cream together before tossing in with the other cooked ingredients.  The dish is REALLY good, giving it a 4 stars because if made as-is it would be a disappointment.

This was delicious! My 9 year old really enjoyed it as well.  Only changes I made were:  *Omitted the wine *Stir the 1/2 cup of shredded parmesan cheese into the beaten eggs before adding to the pan with the spaghetti & bacon. Next time I will use maybe 4 slices more of bacon and maybe 1/4 cup more cheese.  Otherwise flavor was delicious!

Second time around I added 4 cloves garlic, 12 slices of bacon, used pecorino-romano and parm and LOTS of fresh ground black pepper.  Mixed the cheese and egg together beofre adding to noodles and tossed all together with about 1/4 cup cream.  I also used 1/2 lb of noodles instead of a pound.  The sauce had more flavor and there was more of it!

I never knew about mixing the eggs and cheese together and removing the spaghetti from the heat, I  am so thankful for the advice I read in the reviews. This was delicious--not scrambled eggy like the other times I made it...   I used whole wheat pasta that I had leftover in the fridge, so it was pretty quick too.

The perfect carbonara! I have tried several recipes and loved them, but there was alway "something" missing compared to the one I tried in Rome. Its the white wine!!! There is nothing missing from this recipe! (although I don't cook the eggs either... add egg and cheese together to hot pasta, stir in pan until evenly coated and serve)

I've wanted to make Carbonara for months but was always frightened off about cooking the egg and ruining the dish. Tonight I felt brave and found a great recipe to add to the regular rotation. =) I took the advice of others of combining the egg and cheese and added it to the dish after the pasta had cooled slightly. Creamy goodness! I used Turkey Bacon because that's all we had. The only comment my husband made was that he wanted more bacon and perhaps mushrooms in it too. Other than that he really liked it. It was quick, easy, and all ingredients are readily stocked in my house... love it!

First let me say that this is something no one in my family would have ever thought of even trying, but I LOVED this and so did my kids! I couldn't figure out why there was no sauce but after I looked at the recipe again, after eating it all, I realised I forgot one of the eggs, plus I didn't have any wine in the house. Next time I will double the bacon, remember all the eggs, add the wine and maybe even add some heavy cream. This is going into my rotation! About time we got to eat something different than what we always eat! Thanks so much!!

Good as written but great with a lot more garlic, about 5 cloves in all and 1/2 cup more parmesan cheese.  Make sure you use fresh parmigiano reggiano cheese.  This makes a huge difference!

If I could, I'd rate 4.5, but I rounded up.  This is a great recipe and I tweaked a bit based on other reviewrs. I'm a turkey bacon fan but I used the real stuff this time. When it was done, I added one chicken breast to the bacon grease. When I added the onion I also added a half bag of frozen peas- we like peas especially with bacon.  I did add the wine too.  I've been adding a little splash to many recipes here and there and I haven't been disapointed yet. The last change I made was mixing the eggs and cheese together then pouring over the noodle mix.  Also, I used just a little parmesan and in its place I used an Italian cheese mix.  I prefer this over parmesan. Didn't add any pepper or salt at the end nor did I have any parsley.  My whole family (including three kids under 4)ate this up.  I must admit, I've never had carbonara until tonight.  I was wanting Italian takeout and this fit the bill.  DH and I ate the left overs for lunch the next day. It's in my rotation!

I was so excited to make this recipe...however, I made it for dinner tonight and I feel sick to my stomach...the egg mixture --- it's a bit too much.  It's rich, but not in a good way...I would not recommend this recipe.

I also made some modifications based on others reviews. I used 5 eggs, 3/4 cup parmesan cheese and 3/4 cup room temperature cream, mixed all that together and then poured it on top of the pasta and mixed it well. I used a little more bacon as well and used a sweet onion and carmelized it and the minced garlic in the bacon fat. My son can't stand onion and he said the onion in this was good. I didn't have any olive oil so I sprayed the pasta with pam and tossed it to keep it from sticking...gave it a buttery taste. I will def make this again but maybe throw in some chopped tomato, sliced mushrooms and use fresh shredded parmesan instead. Maybe some asiago as well for a little different taste.

So incredibly delicious. At first, I couldn't fathom how eggs factored into the pasta; I'd never heard of this dish. But it was fantastic; my family loved it. I was out of parsley, so I substituted green onions. I will be making this several more times!

I decided to try this recipe simply because my husband was bored with the standard tomato-based sauces with ground beef.  And one of the few foods my entire family (me, Mrs. Don't Like Change, Mr. Adventure-eater plus three picky teens) agree on is bacon. What a wonderful surprise!  Everyone liked it!  Picky Teen #3 only *likes* it, but everyone else loves it.  Picky Teen #2 chose it as one of the meals she was responsible to cook, this past week, and it was a bit of a dare since there were two kid-friends over for dinner, but it was an even bigger hit than the first time we tried it--no leftovers.  We use less than a pound of pasta when we make it because we prefer more sauce and less noodle, but it suffers nothing from the lack.

Great dish, pretty straightforward and easy... my roommate and i like this a lot.  Those who want more sauce/flavor, dont be afraid of adding wine, it makes a great reduction with the onions / vegetables. Half a lemon is great to add to the mix too.

Really fast and yummy, and easy to make with items I have on hand.    My son absolutely devoured it, saying he really like the "pasta with bacon and cheese".   The wine definitely makes the flavor of the dish pop, so it's not optional for me!!  I will say that I cut the recipe in half and two eggs were just a little too rich for me.  I will probably make it again with half the eggs and a generous splash of cream (or evap milk since I always have some in the pantry).  Otherwise I would have given it a healthy 5 stars!!

I liked this recipe.  I did add an extra egg.  Also remember to get GOOD parmesan cheese, as it is such an important ingredient in this dish.

Excellent recipe!! I've made many pasta carbonara dishes, and this by far is the best. The wine is a must, and also 1/4 cup heavy cream is needed at the end right after the eggs go in. I used good quality deli bacon, which I think made it better. Also I just used the cheapest white wine I could find, I never can tell a difference in cooking when I use an expensive wine or a cheaper one. Instead of parmesan cheese, I used motzarella, came out really really good.

Delicious! It must be the unusual addition of white wine that gives this dish a terrific flavor. I didn't have spaghetti and so I used penne which worked out fine. I also microwave the bacon and food process the onion, garlic, etc. which makes the recipe even easier. Have saved this recipe for the future.

Excellent!  Everyone, even the picky eaters, loved it!  Only changes I made were shallots instead of onions, no olive oil, and added 1/2c.  soymilk to moisten/cream it up a bit (would have used cream, but was out.)  Served with hot-from-the-oven bread and a romaine lettuce salad.  A new family favorite!

Excellent recipe!!! Served it as an a starter for a dinner for 10 and everyone was raving about it! All the girls were put to shame when they tasted how good it was. I added some double cream at the end to make more sauce or else it would have been too dry... but overall this is the BEST recipe I've used from this site! Thanks!!!

I absolutely love Spaghetti Carbonara and this is the best.  To make it a little more saucier add a little cream at the quick toss stage in the end.  Delicious! I used Panchetta bacon too for a more authentic dish.  Real comfort food! Thanks Sandy!

Excellent! This is a very rich dish! I used extra bacon for flavour and  five eggs instead of four. I used less pasta because I love sauce. I also added some chopped and steamed green beans to add some colour and veggies to the dish and it was a nice addition. It turned out rich and delicious.

My family LOVES this recipe, as do I! I've been looking for a recipe for years that reminded me of the Carbonara I used to make as a kid, and this is the closest I've come.  Thanks! Oh, and I omitted the white wine, because I didn't have any.

This was,  hands down,  fantastic!  I was always worried about fooling up a Carbonara,  to waste bacon is an unpardonable sin.  This recipe was easy,  and absolutely delicious.  I left out the garlic and wine,  but followed the recipe exactly.  Thank you for this :) I will make it as often as humanly possible!

It was SO EASY and SO FAST to make. It will be my new go-to recipe for a quick dinner. I ended up also combining the grated Parmesan cheese into the eggs and then tossed it in the pasta like one of the other reviewers mentioned to do. I also added half a can of sweet peas.  I might add more bacon next time though. 12 slices would be perfect, and I barely had to add extra salt. Quick sprinkle did fine. Buca DI beppo restaurant adds chicken to theirs, perhaps I'll consider putting in some too...but this was just fine. Toast some garlic cheese bread and some salad on the side and you're good to go!

This is absolutely delicious as written. I've made it several times, and have added some heavy cream once, which was great but not vital. I've made my own pasta twice, and used "fresh" store-bought pasta another time (either will always be better than old dried boxed pasta!). Adjust pasta, bacon and other ratios to taste (as you should with any recipe). 

Many thanks, Sabrinatee, for adding such a wonderful recipe -- it is surprisingly easy, but will WOW your family and guests. Much better than anything you'll order in your local Italian chain restaurant!

This was pretty simple and good.  But I have to admit I read some reviews and made some minor changes.  I didn't want to make the full recipe so I "halved" it...that said, I used 3 eggs and 1/3 cup of parmesan, plus the full amount of bacon.  I also mixed the eggs and cheese together before pouring it over the pasta (I used angel hair).  Will make this again.

My Husband loves carbonara and I have made it several times…so it's hard for me to follow a recipe and resist the urge to tweak it to his preferences.  I did make this as written with the exception of the addition of the white wine.. I added a bit of melted butter instead. I did mix the cheese and eggs together off the heat as a previous reviewer suggested. The sauce was nice and creamy.

Very good recipe.  I used chicken broth instead of wine due to preference. Due to how many I was feeding I only needed to use 3 eggs to 11 oz of pasta with all other ingredients staying the same. and the sauce was creamy and delicious.  I followed review and added cheese to beaten eggs prior to mixing in pasta...it helped to not curdle the egg.  My husband...who hates pasta has requested this recipe again.  Nice recipe.  I only made changes due to needed portions and lack of wine!

Tastes just like what my mom used to make.  Even my youngest, who is a picky eater loved it.  I added about 3/4 cup of heavy cream, extra cheese, and way more bacon.  Definitely will make this again.

This was really good.  I did add the white wine, and I also waited to re add the bacon as I prefer more of a crispy texture when it comes to bacon.  I will be making this again.

Amazing and rich. We followed the recipe only changing the spaghetti for fresh tagliatelle noodles and smoked pork lardons versus bacon. It is going to be a favorite in our home.

This is really good, BUT you have to be really careful not to cook the egg in the sauce. I used half a pound of bacon and about 3/4 pound of thin spaghetti noodles. I sauteed the garlic and onion in the same pan in which I had cooked the bacon (I reserved about 1 T of the bacon fat for flavor). 


Once the garlic and onion were translucent and slightly browned, I deglazed the pan with the win. This is key! It helps you get all the great flavor out of the pan. I used about 1/2 cup of chardonnay and let it cook slightly until it was a bit reduced. 


I combined the eggs, salt, pepper, and cheese in another bowl, beating the eggs before adding the rest of the ingredients. When the pasta was cooked, I mixed it with the wine mixture AND the egg mixture without putting back on the stove. 


Remember: The egg cannot cook; it will curdle and turn like scrambled eggs, NOT a sauce - you don't want this! I reserved some pasta water and added back to my spaghetti to make a creamy sauce. 


You really have to eat this fresh; reheating cooks the egg too much. I left the leftover on the stove for my mom, but it got too hot and curdled, so be warned!

If you do this right, it's delicious and good enough for company; eat with crusty bread and a side salad for a complete meal. Oh, and don't forget the wine! :)

When a friend first made spaghetti carbonara for me and showed me how to do it, he said "one problem: if the eggs don't cook onto the pasta, you're left with a sloppy mess".  And the one time I tried it, it failed and certainly uncooked eggs are NOT lovely or creamy. Yes, you do know when it fails.

Well, with the above method, you'll know if the eggs don't cook and can turn the dish right into a 'bacon and egg pasta' dish instead.  With that thought in mind, I followed the technique and portions as per above, and IT TURNED OUT PERFECTLY.  The eggs coated onto the pasta, creamy and lovely, as well as the cheese.

I've done this a second time now, using rice noodles instead of pasta, and that works well too.  I love the fact that this recipe is adaptable, I will probably try pancetta next time instead of bacon, but "as is" it is a fantastic recipe and my husband loved it - both times!

This was very good. I mixed the eggs and cheese together before puring on pasta as another reviewer suggested. Used 1 pound of bacon and used 2 egg yolks plus one egg. Also added about 1/2 cup pasta water at the end to thin the sauce a bit.

A simple gourmet pasta that tastes amazing and can be served for any occasion, can't ask for anything more. Didn't change a thing, except I used a white wine sauce that I had, instead of white wine, tasted amazing. I find the flavor of this dish more subtle actually, so I thought it was a bit weird being described as super-rich, but tomato tomahto, it's delicious!

We thought the flavor of the onions and garlic and bacon all sauteed together was the best part of this. Next time I would like to try it with the white wine.

What a fantastic Carbonara recipe!  I think this may be the first time my 7 & 9 year old kids have ever asked for a second helping!  :)  Great balance - not too dry, not to gooey.  I personally prefer prosciutto to bacon, and I didn't add the parsley (simply because I didn't have any on hand), but I don't think either alteration causes a very noticeable difference.  Thank you so much for posting this wonderful recipe - can't wait to repeat!!!  :)

Brilliant recipe! Save some of the pasta water to mix back in after the eggs to keep the pasta from being a tad on the dry side. Lovely.

Very nice pasta, and easy too!  I've never made carbonara, but I have had it in restaurants and liked it.  I thought I'd try this since I had leftover spaghetti and wine and am glad I did.  I just made one serving--good thing, too, as I gobbled it down.  I used a white zinfandel that worked just fine.  Thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe. I agree with some of the reviews. The recipe asks for a lot of noodles. Either add more bacon or less pasta. I usually have some garlic bread along with this dish. I highly recommend this dish!

4.5 stars, easy, quick and delicious. Did not use the wine. Whisked eggs and cheese together, tempered with pasta water and added to the pasta and bacon..

Made this for breakfast because who says you can't have pasta for breakfast? I eyeballed the measurements and left out the wine and parsley as I didn't have any. I used whole wheat pasta and mixed the eggs, bacon, onions, cheese, and garlic in a bowl together and then added the hot pasta to sit for a minute or two. Perfect! I think a couple of spoonfuls of pasta water will help with the dryness issue some people seem to have. I added some to the leftovers to make reheating easier. I definitely will make this again for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack...

I have made all kinds of pasta dishes but never tried to make Spaghetti Carbanara before and I looked at a few different recipes but though this one was a good one to start with.  As always the first time I try a recipe I always, always follow the recipe with no changes and this was really good.  I found it to be very easy to make and a nice and hearty meal.  I will definitely make this again but with a few personal preferences.

Pretty good but not good enough to justify the calories for me.  Tried it with whole wheat spaghetti and tried baking the bacon, which didn't turn out so well.  Used the non-nitrate stuff and it wasn't that good.

This was fantastic!  I've made this dish before but it always tasted like it was missing something.  Today I made this for me & my kids and we all loved it.  Tastes great with a glass of wine.  I did put wine in the sauce.  Yum.  Left out the nutmeg & the cream like others suggested because adding that would have turned this into an Alfredo dish.

I gave this 4 stars for the recipe which I am sure is an excellent Carbonara recipe it's just I found we are not big Carbonara people. Carbonara is by nature too dry and difficult to reheat. That being said, I added 3 cups of fresh Parmesan (and a little milk to cream with my eggs) as one reviewer suggested. I knew 1/2 cup of cheese would never be enough for us. I used a whole pound of crispy bacon. I did the wine and added spinach and mushrooms. We found we like it better reheated with a drop of milk, a little butter and some Garlic Plus which is good on almost everything. It was made yesterday and is almost gone. I will make again down the road but not soon. We are just not Carbonara folk. Too dry, too many calories for your meal allowance. On the good side, easy, as tastey as you want it to be depending on what you add and most people have these ingredients in their kitchen which makes this dish cost effective.

This will be on our regular rotation. I ended up adding milk  and peas and some additonal cheese for flavor. The adjustments I will make for next time is use less pasta and more cheese.

Yummy! Yummy! This is going to be a staple recipe in my house. It's fast and easy and you can make it to fit your taste. I added a bit of crushed red pepper for a little heat and some forzen peas to give it a pop of color. I also doubled the cheese and combined it with the eggs before adding it to the hot noodles. This was fantastic.

Delicious! I have made this pasta several times now and it is soooo yummy! Perfect just the way it is! A good addition if you want to change it up is to add baby bellas when you throw in the onions. Yum!

Not bad. Used all the ingredients, except white wine. I didn't think it would turn out kind of bland/dry. I guess its because I like some sauce/liquid to my pasta.

Fantastic!  My boyfriend inhaled it.  To make sure that the eggs didn't cook up hard, I also mixed the parmesan in with the beaten eggs and added it to the pasta after taking it off the burner first. I added a small can of peas at the end too.

Turned out excellent. I followed reviewer's suggestions and mixed the parm cheese and egg before adding to pasta. It worked fabulously. I will definitely be making this more in the future!

I followed the recipe to a "T" which is rare for me (ok -so I added a bit more bacon) and the whole family loved it!  Whenever we have spaghetti there are always leftovers, not this night!

This is really good.  Sometimes i just make a gravy sauce so I can omit the eggs.  I do it kinda like biscuits and gravy, but I use the grease from the onions, bacon, and garlic for my rue.  Adding the cream, a little bit of butter and parmesan.

Outstanding recipe. I was afraid of the slight-cooked egg at first, but it worked very well. Excellent taste. I did chop the bacon into pieces before adding, I think big strands of bacon would make this too cumbersome to eat.

This was delicious!!  I didn't have any wine so I omitted that and added mushrooms and some chicken breast meat to the mixture.  The end result was great, the flavor was outstanding!  I will definitely use this recipe again!

I have never had Carbonara in my life.  When this recipe came through on my email I just had to try it.  Oh boy am I glad I did.  I used a little more bacon, 6 eggs and about 1/3 cup of fat free half & half.  I eyeballed the garlic measure.  I did not use olive oil because after draining the bacon there was enough to sautee the onions without the oil.  I did beat the eggs with the cheese, half & half and parsley before adding. We topped it with a generous helping of parmesan & romano cheese and fresh cracked black pepper.  You will have to adjust the salt measure to your liking. This recipe is a keeper!  I will be making it again.  For the people that don't like eggs, I suggest you try this as this does not have an egg flavor or texture.  As a matter of fact I plan on making this for an egg hater that I know without her knowing just to see what she thinks.  Thanks for sharing.

Excellent!  I followed a reviewers advice and toss eggs and Parma with warm pasta to prevent cooking the eggs.  Nummy.  Next time I'll add a green like arugula or basil leaves to make less sticky.  Would be juicier with roasted cherry tomatoes.

OMGOOOOD!!!  I've never had this dish before so I have nothing to compare it to but I think the recipe is perfect as written.  I left out the optional wine because I don't use it.  I added the eggs first & then the cheese & the sauce was smooth & creamy.  This dish is absolutely delightful.  I'll have to watch my diet much more carefully on other days because of the cholesterol in this dish but it's so good that I'll be making it OFTEN.  Somebody call 911, please.

This was delicious. My boyfriend saw the recipe on the computer when I was cooking it and he said "so the only meat in this is bacon?" He's a carnivore. He had seconds :) I had garden fresh tomato and basil that I added when I tossed it together. Also upped the garlic cause I love garlic. Lot's of leftovers too! Thanks for sharing. Will defiantly make again.

Thank you Sabrinatee for the most delectable recipe. When I  first saw the ingredients, I thought bacon and egg spaghetti? What the heck!?! It is different and I was looking for a change in my menu, I thought I'll give it a try (plus all the wonderful reviews sold me). And let me tell you it was delicilous. The eggs and cheese make it so rich and creamy. I haven't anything but praise to give to you. My family and I want to thank you for sharing and allowing us eat such a delightful dish.

we read some of the advice of other reviewers, and made a few changes. we pretty much followed the recipe with these changes. used one tablespoon of bacon drippings and a little more olive oil. used chicken broth instead of white wine, and sauteed some fresh spinach with the garlic and onions. turned out great! thanks for the recipe idea. my family loved it!

Delicious, quick and easy!  I made it a little healthier by using ground turkey that I seasoned with herbs, salt and black pepper instead of bacon, and adding some frozen chopped spinach after the onion and garlic were cooked.

Good recipe but not great. I found it a bit dry like other reviewers said. Next time I'll double the eggs, cheese, and bacon. Also I poured over the egg and cheese mixture over cooked pasta and AWAY from the heat. This way you will have creamy sauce rather than lumps of cooked eggs. Thanks for the recipe though.

I had never had nor made this dish before.  I thought it was good, but it need a little something more. and I'm not sure what.  It was better re-heated.  I added frozen peas and sauted creminis, and mixed noodles with egg sauce in a bowl instead of in the pan.

This was edible but not good at all.  I ate it just because I spent the time making it and my boyfriend ate it but said he didnt like it.  I took suggestions of others and added heavy cream and left the wine out. I also added more parmesean and peas as well.  It definatley needs something else though...there was just no flavor.

Simple and really great.
I used gluten free spaghetti - that's the only thing fiancée said he would change about it (even though it was fine).  
I will have to say, after I added the egg I thought it was going to be a disaster because it looked so messy and it didn't cook right away like I thought it would.  But then it cooked and I added the cheese and I realized it's supposed to look like that.

I would make this again - and definitely for company.

I followed the recipe exactly, but the results were disappointing. It seemed too dry and the onion/garlic was too overpowering. My kids were not impressed.

Yum!  I used whole wheat Angel hair pasta and heeded others advice to not use a whole pound of pasta~ it was not gooey and I think quite tasty.

Delicious!  Whole family loved it.  Did follow some previous reviewer suggestions: used slightly less than 1lb spaghetti, used more bacon, less onion, and added the parmesan and a little half and half to the eggs before adding to the spaghetti.  I appreciated the suggestions.

After reading most of the reviews, I made the following changes. I used pancetta, reggiano, a teaspoon of red pepper flakes and one half cup of wine. Everthing else was the same. The trick is to serve it immediately as suggested or yes it will "dry out."  Everyone loved this new dish and I will be making it again.

Kind of bland but definitely my fault.  1/2ved the recipe, only used parmesan, olive oil, bacon.  Could definitely have used some salt and the garlic & onion would have added flavor, but just wasn't in the mood to put forth that effort

Wow!  This was soooo good!  High-end restaurant good.  I made the recipe pretty much the same except I did not add the wine, substituted prosciutto for the bacon, and added sliced sun-dried tomatoes.  This will become regular in my kitchen.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made it the first time with the full pound of spaghetti, but that made it waaaay too dry, so the second time I made it with half a pound and added about 1/4 cup heavy cream and it came out perfect! I served it with sauted shrimp on the side and breadsticks. My bf said it was just like Olive Gardens!

I used whole wheat pasta, added a few mushrooms, extra garlic, skipped the first tbsp of oil.  It was okay.  A lot of parm cheese helps.  I appreciate the lack of heavy or whipping cream, but it tastes watered down, so I think I'll keep looking for another recipe.

WAY too much spaghetti, I would cut it down to 3/4 of a lb.  I mixed the cheese into the eggs and poured it over after taking the mixture off heat as others suggested...it was PERFECT.  I used the dry white wine too.  You won't be dissapointed.

This was an easy meal and I'm all about those. It was a little lacking on flavor and wasn't a huge success but it was still pretty good. Simple is sometimes more important than mouth watering in my house.

My sauce was not creamy at all, I highly suggest adding some milk to your cheese and eggs and mixing before adding it to the pasta. The taste was still good though I think the pancetta I added was the best part.

This was good. Granted if I hadn't made a boo boo of too much cream it would have been better. That was my fault and had nothing to do with the recipe.

My mom - who is not the greatest cook (sorry Mom) kept saying that she wanted to make me dinner on my birthday, so I said Spaghetti Carbonara as it is something I love but make it rarely (?)  I had used this recipe before with success so I gave it to her, she was nervous since she had never even eaten it before and did not know what to expect.  It was AWESOME, defnitely seconds and empty plates all around.  It's a great recipe too since you can do the bacon thing ahead of time , throw it together in minutes.  Love It!

I made this for dinner tonight.  My family loved it.   I used red onion and turkey bacon.  (that is what I had on hand) I don't like eggs so I was a little nervous about about adding them.  I mixed the eggs and cheese as someone else  mentioned. It was really creamy!  I also put the bacon mixture in the pasta hot pot added the egg mixture then poured the hot pasta on top of it as someone else mentioned.  It just needed a little extra salt.  It's a keeper!

This recipe was a hit in my house!!! Not a bit of leftovers. I had never made carbonara before so the eggs threw me for a loop - I was convinced we would all get sick. But we didn't and it turned out fabulous!!!!  Next time ill add a can of peas. Will be a regular in my house!!!

OMG this is fabulous.....we just finished eating this recipe for a pre Christmas dinner and it was out of this world.  Because of the occasion I did add some heavy cream about 1/3 cup, about 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and 1lb of large shrimp.  I served it with hot french bread....the bowl is empty and even my 4 kids loved it....thanks for sharing...will definately use this recipe again.

I thought it tasted like eggs and bacon mixed with spaghetti. No other flavors stood out. It was a waste of my time to make, not to mention money.

this was excellent. i recommend doubling the bacon and eggs, and tripling the parm cheese. i mixed the parm with the beaten eggs before adding. i cooked the pasta LAST, drained it, and then mixed the bacon, onion, and garlic in with a 1/2 cup of green peas and a 1/4 cup half and half. this way, i didnt have to worry about the pasta drying out and adding extra olive oil, or reheating it. i topped it with parsley and shaved parm cheese, and a little cracked pepper. i did not add salt.

This was okie. I made everything as the recipe said (even adding the wine) and it was very bland and oily for me.  It wasn't the greatest carbonara but it was edible. If I make it again, I would listen to the comments.

Love this!  Modified a bit - used a whole pound of bacon (we LOVE bacon in this house), and made it a bit simpler for ease and because of my young kids.  Cooked up the bacon and pasta at the same time, drained the bacon grease, immediately mixed it with the drained pasta.  Then (as another reviewer suggested), mixed the beaten eggs with the parm cheese and mixed that into the pasta bacon mixture.  Skipped the onion, garlic and such because of the kids, but I could see using it and other ingredients in the future.  Will make again!!

Great recipe, I don't want to eat spaghetti any other way now.   The only change I made was on account of laziness - I just left all the bacon fat in!

This recipe was right up my alley! I added half and half like other reviewers suggested and mixed that with the eggs and parmesan in a bowl before adding all at once.  Next time I will add a little more than 1/2 cup of half and half. I actually added shrimp and next time will add mushrooms. I'm glad I found this recipe and it tastes great!

This dish tastes great without the onion. The first time I made the dish with the onion, I found it to be terrible. Also, MAKE THE BACON CRISPY! It tastes ten times better with crispy bacon!!!

loved it. was scared of making the sauce but turned out fabulous. Took some other reviewers suggestions: added 3/4 cup half and half to egg and cheese mix, cut onions in half, tossed in some extra garlic, and mixed sauce and pasta in a bowl not on stove top to avoid cooking eggs. It was awesome. Reheating instructions for 50% power were dead on. This is a keeper

We loved this!  It's a great recipe because it is such basic ingredients. It was out side of my comfort level and I was a little scared of tossing the noddles in the egg.  But it turned out so creamy and we just could not stop eating it.  Next time I will chop the onions smaller and add more cheese.

This was excellent! I had never made a carbonara before and I'm very glad I found this recipe. I used turkey bacon (lower fat) and made up for the lost smokiness with some liquid smoke. I also followed the other reviewers' advice and mixed the eggs with the cheese before added to the pasta. The sauce was very rich and creamy! I will make this again!

Delicious! Cooking is not my favorite thing to do, and I am always on the lookout for easy, but delicious meals.  This one fits the bill. My family loved it! I will be making this dish again and again! I also mixed the egg and cheese before adding and the texture was creamy and perfect.  I did use a touch more olive oil with the onion, so the pasta mixed quite well and wasn't dry at all.

This was very delish and easy to make! I used Turkey Bacon and whole wheat spaghetti to make it healthier. I wish I had egg beaters on hand to use instead of regular eggs, but that's ok. Next time.

The flavor was very good in this recipe, but the noodles lacked "sauce". I made this for my husband on valentines day, and we had to wash it down a lot, (yeah vino!) because it was a sticky bunch of dry noodles. I would try using a little heavy cream next time, and temper the eggs with a little of the cooking water from the noodles before adding them, so they dont set up too much.

Uhm Yeah, this pasta is the bomb!   I make this all the time and everyone loves it.  I was afraid to make it at first, thinking it was too delicate and complicated but it really wasn't.  I reserve about a cup of the pasta water in case I need to thin out the sauce a bit and it comes out perfect everytime!  It tastes better than anything I could get in a restaurant!

This was amazing! I felt like I was eating at a restaurant. I added some nutmeg and I also mixed the eggs and the cheese together first and then added them to pasta. Also- the biggest change which turned out to be great was that I used Angel Hair pasta. So good!! Thank you for this awesome addition to my favorites.

This is now one of our favorites.  It is easy, cheap, and yes very unhealthy.  The only thing I changed is to mix the egg and parm (I used the bagged shredded) before I add it to the pasta.  Thanks for the recipe.

Good recipe-As a mom to 6 kids, I look for quality plus quantity.

I did use vegetable broth in place of wine and added italian sauages and mushrooms.  I also used cream and butter for the sauce.  All the kids (even the 2 yr old) loved it!!

Absolutely amazing! I made this as written and added prosciutto and chicken crisped up a little in a pan, and it was DELICIOUS. I had to make myself stop eating it! Only thing was I probably will just skip the bacon next time and go straight to the prosciutto and chicken-I liked them much better in this recipe.

Very good! I used only 1/2 of a pound of spaghetti and kept the ratios of everything else the same because I like a lot of sauce, and it worked out well. Thanks for the easy and delicious recipe!

Spaghetti carbonara is possibly my all-time favorite food.  This recipe is good, easy, and true to the principles of the dish: eggs, parmesan, fatty pork, and pasta. 

I recommend sauteeing the onions until they are super soft.

Rich (I get the feeling this is an Americanized version of the dish) but good.

My husband made this a few months back and it was just okay ( 2 star rating), BUT then I tried it again and merely followed the advice of one of the reviewers who stated, "An Italian friend of mine who cooks told me that the proper way to make smooth Carbonara sauce is to combine the beaten eggs with the grated Parmesan, and then to pour that mixture onto the spaghetti once the spaghett has cooled slightly (so that it's still hot, but so the eggs don't cook (that was our problem last time making it dry and sticky) and the cheese melts seamlessly into the eggs and pasta)...".  I followed this to a "T" and it was INCREDIBLY CREAMY!!!  5 STAR PLUS!!!!!   Here is my husband's previous review  (what you can expect when you don't allow the spaghetti to cool):  This pasta is just a little bland and dry for my tastes, but I am largly ignorant of what Spaghetti Carbonara is supposed to taste like.  That being said, our company loved the dish and said it reminded them of the food they ate while living in France which apparently tends to have a little less zing than American recipes.  Maybe I'll try preparing it next time with some salmon mixed in rather than bacon.

I made this for a large crowd, and it was a HUGE hit!  A nice change for spaghetti sauce and noodles.  Kids and adults alike loved it!  Definitely add the white wine for flavor though (we made it once at home without and we were disappointed).

You don't have to use the reserved 2 Tablespoons.  Try whole wheat noodles for nutrition and delicious taste! Great recipe! Next time I might try 3 eggs instead.

Delicious recipe, a real winner with my picky Italian husband.  I added 1 T of fresh chopped basil.  I also added more fresh parsley due to the amount of spaghetti.  The wine I used was Robert Mondavi Fume Blanc.  I also used thick sliced bacon to make the dish more hearty.  I served the spaghetti carbonara with garlic french bread.

This is one of my favorite recipes now. I like to add cooked chicken to the onion mix (two packages of sandwich chicken strips works great), and then add two handfuls of frozen peas to it. It's sooooooo good. ^_^

I'm from the Philippines and the carbonara here is usually made of mushroom soup. It's really awful. Then I found this recipe. I feel like an expert after doing this. It tasted so light and creamy! The only change I made was adding sliced mushrooms and mixing the parmesan and eggs before putting it in. And the white wine gave an exquisite touch on it. It's there but not overpowering. This is now my default "carbonara" recipe. :)

I was hoping for a creamier end product.  My eggs scrambled and I ended up with more of an Italian noodley egg fu yung.  I actually like Lean Cuisine's chicken carbonara and was hoping to end up with something closer to that.  I should have saved myself the work and calories and stuck with the freezer and microwave.

I was doubtful on this dish, but thought I'd give it a try anyway.  I'm glad I did!  Even with the several steps to put together, it is very easy to make, even for a person who doesn't cook much.  All the ingredients work together for a really great flavor. A must try.  With that said, I have to say I'd cut back to using just 2 eggs.  The 4 was just to much.  Besides that, superb.

My husband is still raving about this recipe.  After a few failed attempts at Carbonara with another recipe, we are quite pleased to have found this one.  We will definitely be making this again.  We doubled the bacon, added 1/4 cup heavy cream, a couple of sprinkles of nutmeg and next time we will add some sauteed mushrooms.  YUM!

great recipe - I doubled the ingredients (bacon, onions, eggs, cheese, wine) to add to the spaghetti and it worked really well

definitely didn't need cream in my opinion - rich enough as it was.

This was a hit with my whole family.  Even my 3yo who won't eat anything new loved it.  I did use a small amount of half and half to make the sauce a little thinner.  And I followed the advice and broke up the angle hair before cooking it.  I can't wait to make it again.  Next time I will try veggies of some sort.

I changed the recipe a bit, but I wanted to share because it was such a time saver.  I had leftover spaghetti noodles, about 3 cups cooked, so I used this recipe as a base for using them.  I fried the bacon bits (no onions), warmed the noodles in the microwave, and then tossed them directly into the pan with the bacon.  I didn't even drain the fat off as I didn't add any other oil.  I tossed those together, added about a teaspoon of red pepper flakes, couple of dashes of garlic salt, and 2 eggs (scrambled together), tossed those together and then added 1/2 cup or so of shredded mozzarella (no parmesan) and tossed it all together.  One pan, woo hoo!  So it came out very tasty as a "leftover" dish and I will likely cook extra pasta any time I make spaghetti so that we can have this the next night.

This is excellent... but I did make a few changes. I used 1/4 cup sour cream instead of wine... no onion ~ 2 eggs instead of 4, (I use half a box of spaghetti). I also reserved 1/2 cup of the pasta water, whisked cheese, sour cream, salt, eggs and garlic - then added the pasta water to that and poured it over the pasta... cooked on low heat until thickened... added pepper...... YUM. You can also use low sodium ham ~ but greasy, bad for you bacon tastes way better!! :-)

The recipe didn't come out like the carbonara that I'm used to.  I think it would've been better to take the carbonara off the heat when mixing the eggs.  Mine became scrambled eggs. Also, other recipes recommended mixing eggs and parmesan together.  Or combining both of thsoe with cream.  I'll probably try that next time.  Also, amount of onions could be scaled down and I would recommend the onions be finely diced instead of chopped.

This is a very tasty meal that doesn't take a huge amount of effort.  After looking at others suggestions, I added in some mushrooms and also added in some half & half at the end.  Bought the nutmeg to add in but forgot about it...I'll add some in next time to see what it adds to the flavor.

We loved this recipe.  I wanted it creamier, but instead of adding cream (and a zillion calories), I added evaporated skim milk.  It made the sauce that is so great, but didn't add much to the hips!

Hmmmm.... I made this tonight for our new friends. Our first guests in our new home. I wanted to serve something special so I picked this recipe. I am a little disappointed. We all thought it was okay. I am half Italian and my dad used to make Carbonara concoctions often when I was growing up, so I am very familiar with it. I have a recipe in a cookbook that I prefer over this one. I don't think I'll make this particular recipe again. I found this a little bland for my taste, even after the addition of more garlic, salt and pepper, and the cream. Before adding the cream, it seemed very dry. I'm thinking 1 lb of spaghetti is too much pasta in proportion to the sauce?!

This was really delicious and not difficult.  It's not as creamy as other carbonaras I've ordered in restaurants, but as I said to my husband, "that's probably a good thing!"  This was simple, pretty quick, and absolutely scrumptious.

This was a really good recipe.  My first time making carbonara and it turned out wonderful.  My dinner guests also raved about it and wanted the recipe.  There is quite a bit of preparation, bu the end result is worth it.  The only additions I made to this recipe were: I added 3/4 c. cream with the beaten eggs and a jar of capers.

Spaghetti Carbonara has been my favorite dish since I was a little girl.  But just like everyone else I have my own twist. Just as a suggestion; to add a surprising kick to this dish, toast a large handful or two of pine nuts and mix them into the pasta at the end. If you've never worked with pine nuts before, be careful, they cook extremely fast!

This was good but a little plain, and I don't think it was worth the high fat and calories, even using low fat parmesan. It's not something I would make too often. However, it's a quick and easy meal and I usually have all of these ingredients in my fridge.

I love this recipe - it's so quick and easy and can be made from things leftover in the fridge. It also tastes fine with different strong, hard cheeses if you don't have any parmasan.

This was actually my first shot at cooking pasta (young cook here *^.^*) so I may have had unusual difficulty, but the results were just yummy. It was also nice to have a carbonara without cream, since my mother is trying to lose weight and doesn't want to eat anything too fatty. I think in future I would add more garlic and perhaps mushrooms to make it more interesting, but this is a very good base recipe to work from, making your own additions according to taste. The whole family enjoyed it, even my vegetarian sister who picked out all the bacon.

It was wonderful. Even my girlfriend who doesn't like eggs loved it! I served it with a garden salad & garlic bread. It's flavorful but at the same time something is missing. Would love to find that perfect something to put in it.

Oh wow, was this ever plate-licking good! The only change I made was to combine the eggs and parm together before adding them to the pasta. Oh, and I didn't use any olive oil, choosing to use the bacon grease that the dish had already generated. The resulting dish was creamy and flavorful and restaurant quality.

This was okay. Half of my family liked it, the other half didn't. If I were to make it again, I would omit the white wine and reduce the onion. I did combine the cheese with he eggs prior to mixing it with the pasta and that seemed to work very well.

Great recipe.  I used double smoked bacon, a mix of sweet red bermuda onion and sweet vadalia onion, and a nice crisp chardonay. I also used at least double the parsley(curley leaf) and added it with the eggs.  Used 6 eggs not the four the recipe calls for.  Yes I will make this recipe again but I will mix the cheese with the eggs and remove from the heat just before adding to the pasta and bacon.

This was really easy to make and delicious.  My 9 year old and 7 year old even loved it.  I substituted chicken broth for the wine and I only used about 1/8 cup.  Other than that I did everything exactly as the recipe said.  I'll definitely be making this again.

Oh, this is delicious! I had this dish at a restaurant recently and this recipe turned out even more delicious.  I pay have added more bacon, I put in the whole pack, but I wasn't sure how much spaghetti I'd cooked anyway.  Otherwise, I made no changes.  This is definitely a keeper!

easy to prepare. ingredients I would always have on hand. Just delicious. I was worried that the bacon would be over powering, I was wrong. Everything blended together for a very delicious meal. My husband loved it and he is hard to please when it comes to new dishes. Will make it again.

I thought this was so delicious!! When I first read it, I was wondering why we would mix bacon and eggs with spaghetti. Wow.....was I wrong.
It was SO delicious. 
I added a bit more parmesan cheese because we like parmesan. And I used a whole pack of bacon instead of 8 strips because....come on. Bacon is the best.
I gave it only 4 stars because I think that this only makes 5 servings at best.
We had enough for my husband, myself and two small kids. There was enough for one of us to take leftovers for lunch and that's it. I would double it next time.

This is easy, different, and VERY yummy. Be careful with the amount of oil used, you can go too little to too much very quickly. Heats up great for leftovers with a touch more oil added. This recipe is great!!
EDIT: After making this over and over now this is an easy 5 stars. make it your own, I add more bacon grease, more garlic, and I make noodles from scratch and sometimes just buy store bought linguine. This recipe is restaurant worthy either way.

It was bland.. It was missing a something. I didn't put the dried wine in so maybe that was its problem!

Exceptionally easy to make.  The first time making it I followed the recipe exactly, but it seemed a little bland.  The second time I doubled the bacon (next time I am going to triple the bacon) and added an additional egg.  The added ingredients seemed to round it out a little better and added flavor.  It is great reheated in the microwave for a quick breakfast or lunch choice.

I served this for the Easter brunch together with roast chicken and fresh salad. Everyone loved it! A little variation though since we have moringa handy, I generously sprinkled the green over and voila an instant Easter feast.

Easy, and just as delicious as I remember my mum's growing up. I'll often add some mushrooms in with the bacon if I have them, but the recipe as-is is great.

Excellent! I didn't have any olive oil so I used butter instead and then, towards the end splashed in the tiniest amount of balsamic vinegar in hopes of cutting the richness. I also threw in a bag of steamed veggies with the onions and garlic. All in all a very cheap, yummy, filling meal!

My daughter and I really liked this recipe but we will eat just about anything.  My husband and younger daughter who are picky eaters didn't enjoy it as much.  I definitley think that it was very dry.  Like another reviewer said I think the amount of spaghetti should be toned down some.  That might make it all come together better.

Great basis for carbonara. But I do prefer about 1 cup of heavy cream, along with nutmeg. I also only used the egg yolks, not the egg whites. Put in a bowl, beat it and mix with parmesan cheese and then adding the mixture to the noodles after they cool off a little, so the eggs don't cook. Then toss with creamy sauce (make sure it is off the heat). I could definitely use more than 8 slices of bacon. There just wasn't enough meat. I probably try a full pack of bacon.

This was quite good, and very easy and quick to make. Husband loved it and we will definitely be making it again. Works with or without the heavy cream suggested by other reviewers -- I used almond milk and a little extra butter because that was all I had, and it still turned out delicious. A+. :)

My high school son's favorite!  But I only used 2 eggs and backed down the onion to 1/2.  No white wine, just a spritz of lemon.  Great go-to dish anytime and even better on day 2.  I never thought of taking it to a brunch but I bet it would be a big hit!

I've made this one so much that I don't even need to read the recipe all that much.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!  I agree with the reviews on adding the parmesan cheese to the eggs and mixing them together.  Then pouring that mixture onto the spaghetti and bacon mix. SOOO FREAKIN' GOOD!

I absolutely love this recipe. Not a pork eater, so I substituted with turkey bacon and couldn't imagine it being any tastier! I also consider the white wine a must, not "optional". And I probably used more Parm than called for...I always do! It was really great.

I've never had Spaghetti Carbonar before but I love bacon, onions, garlic, eggs and parmesan so I thought I would try it. It was delicious! The eggs and cheese make the sauce so creamy and rich. Not to mention the smokiness of thebacon- so good!
I didn't change anything on the recipe since there were so few ingedients I made sure to use high quality ingredients and i think that made a big difference.

Wonderful recipe; delicious! 4 stars only because of a few seemingly necessary modifications.  Like others, I added the parm to the egg then folded into the pasta OFF THE HEAT!  If pasta seems dry, gently adding in some of the pasta water is a good idea.  It's great without, but adding in some frozen petite green peas is quite nice.  Be sure pasta is quite al dente befor adding all else.

I really enjoyed this dish, and my husband and toddler did, too. The only thing that I didn't like is that it was a little too...dry. I don't feel like that's quite the right word, but it's the closest thing I can think of. But the flavor was great!

Simple and tasty recipe.  May need minor tweak on instructions, specifically a step that would help make the egg and cheese mixture smoother when it blends with the pasta. Otherwise it's a real win.

This was my first try making carbonara, and it turned out great! I used 1/4 c of the starchy pasta water instead of the wine, and a little extra olive oil as I tossed it together. My husband loves carbonara, and he immediately went for seconds, so I rate this recipe a success!

Great recipe...I added 1/2 cup heavy cream, used 5 eggs, and 1 cup parm. cheese. I put the cream, eggs and parm. cheese in the blender and made a smooth sauce to add. Also used 12 pcs. of bacon. Served over bow tie pasta. Fantastic!

This was super easy, but tasted great! I added some italian sausage and reduced the amount of bacon. I also added some veggies to give it color (and some added taste). I added a red bell pepper, some mushrooms, and a can of italian flavor diced tomatoes (drained). I also added a little more wine and olive oil since I added some bulk to the recipe. It tasted even better then it looked. This is a keeper.

It's another keeper!

I have been trying recipes from this website for over a year.  I describe them to my hubby and he is always skeptical.  Then I make the dish and he tells me it's a keeper.  He even takes pictures of the dish and sends it to his brother telling him that he HAS to try it.

Once again, we were not disappointed with this dish.  This was my first time making a carbonara and it turned out perfectly.

My husband is not a fan of parmesan and after being given a taste of the pasta in the kitchen, I caught him loading more onto his plate.

Needed something really quick for just myself tonight and though I didn't have any bacon on hand this carbonara has some excellent flavor!  I took advice of previous reviewer and mixed the parm in with the beaten egg before adding to noodles, also added a splash or two of white wine (Chardonnay).  Will make again when DH is home, including the bacon!  Thanks for a great tasting and quick dinner!

We made this once as is, and once with an over-easy egg on top with a little added Italian seasoning in the olive oil. My husband enjoyed it with the egg on top but didn't like it as much as written. We might just be used to American-ized Italian food. It was a little bland for our tastes.

This is one of the most requested recipes by my family. It is so easy and quick to make that it is almost laughable.  I use the entire package of bacon instead of counting out 8 slices.  I highly recommend removing everything off the heat before pouring in the egg and Parmesan cheese mixture.

Followed the directions exactly as stated and everything turned out wonderful.  I didn't  add mushrooms or peas as some restaurants do (though that may be an option in the future.)  The only thing that we did different was use peppered bacon and that's because it's what we happened to have on hand.  Great quick and yummy recipe.  Thanks!

This was good!  And so cheap and easy to make, also.  I did mix the egg and cheese together, and add a splash of milk before stirring into hot pasta. I also added just a tad more olive oil to the finished product.  Used fresh parmesan and added the white wine.

I will definitely make it again!

Good basic recipe, but can be a little dry if re-heated. Added peas to my pasta and did not add extra salt (bacon has enough already). Followed recommendations & added 3/4 cup Parmesan to eggs & blended well before adding to slightly cooled pasta. Not sure it needs the olive oil, but it is a quick & easy meal good for busy week nights...Thanks Sabrinatee!

Decent, easy version of pasta carbonara.  This is one of those dishes that is heavily influenced by the quality of the ingredients used.  I used pancetta (about double what the recipe called for) and Parmigiano-Reggiano, and added a little cream at the same time as the eggs and cheese.  We usually eat light, healthy fare, so this was something different for us.  All things in moderation...

Update:  Used Dawns Quick and Easy Alfredo sauce over this leftover carbonara from last night  and it brought a 3 star dish to a 4.5 star.//////////////////////////It was okay and good...we never have eaten carbonara before....I had no issues of not having enough sauce........It is extremely filling, a half of serving is all my hubby and I could eat so we have tons left over. Does this freeze well? We both agreed it would be better as a side dish to grilled steak and a green veggie and maybe not as a meal.  I give recipes 5 stars if I want to go get the ingredients immediately to make again; 4 stars if I am told to put this in menu rotation; So, I give it 3 stars since no one wanted seconds but ate it.

YUM!!! Absolutely the best! The only things I did differently were to use penne instead of spaghetti and instead of taking the bacon out, I waited until it was just about crispy, drained the grease and then added the onion and garlic to cook while finishing the bacon. Oh, and I did put the cheese in with the eggs. Gorgeous carbonara!

This was my first attempt at Carbonara and I don't think this is a dish I can make at home.  Better left to the pros, in my case.  The texture was unappealing for my taste, even though I followed the directions exactly.

Perfect - Loved this - just mixed the cheese and eggs together before adding them to the pasta as some reviewers had recommended, as my only change.  LOVED this recipe - easy- and everyone even my picky son enjoyed this - everyone was in agreement that this was a "make again recipe"

I've cooked this several times, sometimes changing things a bit; other times , making as is.  Tonight I added one tomato, artichoke hearts, and used vermouth since I didn't have white wine.  I usually beat the eggs, then add light cream with parmesan and other Italian cheeses.  Mix well, and stir into the bacon mixture- stirring quick,quick, quick and then dump it into the pasta and stir until creamy.
Thanks sooo much for this recipe!

changes to suit my taste: I used half the onion and twice the bacon.I had the dryness issue that the other posters had, but having read the other reveiws...adding a little pasta water helped. And like the other posters I also found that this amount of sauce was right for half the amount of spaghetti. When all said and done it was "pretty good" but still missing a little something to put it over the top. I tried adding a little oregano. THEN it was perfect! Also like the other posters....I found I liked the sauce better when the egg was mixed with the cheese first. I also added a coupl TB for cream to it. That way the sauce comes out creamy instead of like scrambled eggs. My family still ate the first scrambled egg version happily....but I like the texture of the sauce better the second way.

Cooked by directions....very good.  Did add 4 chicken breasts, used bacon bits instead of frying bacon.  Thought about adding a little cream, but tried by exact recipe first.  Was a little dry the second day.

This dish TASTED incredible, but I felt the recipe was not completely user-friendly for beginners.  For instance not all directions had heat levels for cooking and I still have 2 tablespoons of reserved bacon fat on the counter that I never used?  

I only used about 1/2 the pasta and 2 eggs for the final product - my skillet just wasn't big enough and honestly when the bacon cooks down there's just not enough of it anyway.  I should have cooked the whole package and used a bigger skillet...

It TASTED INCREDIBLE and for that 4 stars - even my son who won't eat cheese or eggs if his life depended on it, licked his plate clean.  

I just think the directions should be cleaned up a bit.

Followed the recipe exactly but without the wine as I didn't have any and it turned out dry and bland. Will not be using this recipe again.

This was tastey.  I added chopped seared chicken which was a nice addition.  Also, I didn't have some of the spices so i used a scoop of pesto that I had jarred.  Very nice.

Fairly easy to make.  We used very thick cut bacon and added frozen peas to the pasta while it was sitting.  We mixed the cheese and eggs together and added them to the pasta mixture after we had taken it off the heat.  This prevented the scrambled eggs effect.  Very tasty!

Excellent recipe!!! I did add some cream as reviews suggested but other than that followed it to the key. Really good, the whole family loved it and my wife said she'd like it to be a "regular home menu choice" and that's as good as it gets folks. 
Thanks SABRINATEE

My whole family loved this recipe. I followed directions exactly, but added the Parmesan cheese to the eggs and added 1/4 C of half & half. It was delicious. Thank you :)

How delicious! I followed the recipe (with the wine) but followed the tip to combine the Parmesan and egg before adding. Not sure if that made a difference. This was great with whole wheat spaghetti. I will probably double the bacon next time.

This was so satsifying.  I'm making it for a dinner party next week.  As another poster  mentioned I added the cheese to the egg before adding to the skillet.  Also I grated the cheese with a zester, it comes out very fluffy and melts easily.  I used about a cup and a half of cheese and doubled the bacon. This recipe is going in my weekly rotation.

Oh my word. This is absolutely delicious. I love pasta and cannot believe I haven't had this until now. The only thing I changed was to add a 1/4c of heavy cream and it coated the amount of pasta in the recipe perfectly. I made this for a small group of people and everyone loved it. We all went back for seconds and I even had someone request the recipe. Five stars!

I have always been nervous about the eggs in carbonara recipes. But I was determined to give it a go. My husband loved this recipe! I did only add 2 eggs. I added the cheese to the eggs first and a dash of cream. Really pleased with the result. Will be making this again!

I personally love it!  I did add about a quater cup of cream at the end, allowed the pasta to cool a bit before adding the eggs, and doubled the cheese but that was the only changes I made... My hubby (who is a meat and potatoes kind of guy) wasn't a huge fan.  He ate a large helping but no seconds :).  I would definately make it again....yummy!

I thought this recipe was very bland. I followed the recipe exactly except that I added more bacon. It seemed like there was too many noodles, it wasnt very creamy and I just didnt get it. I had to fish for bites with bacon and onions otherwise I basically just ate a bunch of noodles. I've never had spaghetti carbonara so maybe this is just how it tastes?

Very good. I did use some wine and I think that's what made it turn out so well. I had to add a lot more olive oil to keep it from getting too dry. I also will add more bacon next time. I used dried parsley because I didn't have any fresh parsley on hand. Great meal that I will be making again!

I thought I was going to be really impressed, but it was really simple.  Don't get me wrong, the egg sauce was creamy and looks like the right recipe for carbonara. maybe I'm just not a fan. After spicing it up a little it was better, but I probably won't make it again.

I left out the olive oil (there was enough grease from the bacon) and forgot the parmesan, but it still had a lot of flavor!  I would definitely use the white wine.

This recipe is AMAZING, PERFECT as written!  My teen son unexpectedly brought a friend home from tennis practice, so we had a guest judge on this one as well.  They both raved that it was something they would get from a local Italian restaurant, asked would I make it for them again!  I was hesitant to try it because of the eggs, but it was no problem at all and you couldn't tell they were even there when eating it, just a delicious sauce.  I will definitely be adding this to my "fix often" recipe list and am inviting people over just so I can cook this for them!

Excellent recipe. One thing I'd advise would be to take the pan off of the stove before pouring in the eggs in and allow them to cook off the heat from the noodles to keep them from scrambling. Also, the advice about mixing the cheese and egg before hand is also very good. I tried that and the Parmesan melted seamlessly into the egg, leaving a nice and creamy texture.

Delicious and easy.  My 13 year old son thought it needed a little more "something" and added a shake of Tony's on top.  He's had 3 bowls and isn't finished!  That's what I call a 5 star recipe.

I thought this was delicious. It had a great, rich flavor from the bacon, onions and wine. I added a little more garlic in mine. Plus, it reheats very well and was awesome as a next day lunch for work.

This is a good dish. I think that it would a little better with red pepper flakes and green onions. But it is worth a try.

We just had this for supper.  Wonderful recipe!
 I only changed it to fit what I had in stock.  Rice noodles instead of spaghetti, Cilantro instead of Parsley and DiGiorno Three Cheese shredded blend instead of Parmasan.

Very good, very different.  I can't wait to try the variations suggested here.

Goodness that was good.  Just make this.  I haven't actually had a lot of Carbonara out at restaurants to compare this to, but this was just heavenly.  I could've eaten two portions.  I was trying to find a way to use up some extra ham from Easter and wanted to do a pasta dish.  I'll have to try this with bacon or pancetta another day.  Upon reading suggestions I also, in a separate bowl, whisked the eggs, parm cheese, and a little cream and then threw the hot noodles, ham, and onion mixture in on top of it and mixed until all was creamy.  Next time the only change I'll make is a little more garlic.  Great recipe!

Really great carbonara! I accidentally put one cup of parmesan when it called for 1/2 cup, I think it dried out the sauce a little. My fault! Still amazing flavor! I did not add any salt at all and it was just great. Try this!!

I made this recipe last week and it didn't really compare to another one I have. My only gripe was my eggs scrambled when I added them. I might make this again but temper (add about a ladle full of pasta cooking water) my eggs before adding them to the pan. It wasn't bad, I just prefer my other recipe.

This was wonderful! As a uni student, I'm all about the yummy recipes that can be *ahem* adjusted to a tight budget. I know it isn't "traditional", but this was absolutely amazing for 2 people with 4 slices of bacon, 1/2c of that cheap mozza cheese, 1 egg, 1/4c diced onion, 4 cloves garlic, some nutmeg, salt/pepper and tada! University carbonara. 
Definitely mix the cheese with the egg as others have mentioned, too. 
I did get a chance to splurge and make it as listed and it was (obviously) even better!
Thanks for posting this SABRINATEE! Its superb!

Great!  Just added more white wine and cheese then the recipe called for to my taste and 3/4 a small jar of capers, just because we had them and was trying to clear out my cupboard.  Also threw in some left over rotisserie chicken.  It was really good, but would have worked fine without the additions too.

I really liked this. My husband thought it could use less onion, but he's not a fan of onion. We both thought that it needed more bacon however. We halved the recipe and used 4 slices for 1/2 lb of spaghetti. Next time we'll definitely add more bacon along with a bit more garlic. Thanks for sharing!

Very Delicious! The only thing I did was took half of the noodles out. It was too much. Next time I will keep the 1 pound of noodles & double the ingredients. The whole family loved it. This one is a keeper!

Amazing carbonara! I moved to Italy over the summer, and this easily compares to any of the carbonara I've had. Based on the comments, I made some changes that I'm pleased with.  First I started the pasta and cooked 8 slices of 1/4" thick pork belly, and used all the rendered fat to cook the onions without the olive oil. After the onions were translucent, I added three cloves of minced garlic and cooked for a minute, followed by the 1/4 cup of wine. For the pasta, I used spinach penne, and the last 5 minutes of the pasta's cooktime I threw the steamer basket with about half a can of navy beans and half a can of peas on top. When the pasta was done, the wine had just finished cooking for a minute, so I added the beans and peas to the onion/garlic mixture. I drained the pasta, let it cool for about a minute, and placed it back in the pot. I combined the onion mixture with the pasta, and added 1 cup of fresh Parmesan followed by the eggs (with a bit of heavy cream, not sure how much but I'd guess about 1/3 cup). I stirred for about 2 minutes and served. Absolutely amazing!

I just made this for my family, and it came out great! Even my super-picky five-year-old told me it was "pretty good!"  The recipe was easy to follow and best of all, it was quick since you can do all the prep while the spaghetti's cooking.  I look forward to making (and eating) this again!

It just seemed bland to me.  This is my first time trying Carbonara so it could be a fantastic Carbonara and I'm just not fond of the style.  I think the recipe would have been more flavorful with less pasta or more of everything else.  It seemed like I was eating a lot of pasta and a little flavor.

This was simple and delicious.  I would suggest using chicken broth if you decide to skip the white wine.  You need something to de-glaze the pan and add a bit of moisture.  I am making this again, only a week later, it has been a craving.

I used turkey bacon, and quite a bit of it.  I cooked it with the oil and the onions and garlic since I knew it would not be making any of it's own grease. I did add a little bit of cooking white wine, but not much and a little bit of Italian Seasoning.  I did mix the cheese with the egg.  I used some asiago/parm mixture, as well as some moz.  I added a shake of nutmeg as others suggested.  It was a good flavor but next time I will try it without.  I took the noodles out of the boiling water and put them into the serving bowl, and then added the egg and cheese and stirred and stirred.  Then added the bacon mixture and stirred some more.  It was very very good.  Very creamy, great flavor.  I had never made it before and was worried about ending up with scrambled eggs and noodles, but instead it was a beautifully creamy dish that looked like it just came off of Food Network.  Thanks for sharing.

This was so creamy and turned out just perfect!!! It is definately a keeper. My 5 year old LOVED it! I did what others suggested...added an extra clove of garlic, a 5th egg and some heavy cream. I whipped the eggs, parm, and cream together and then poured them on just before serving.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!!

I made this for my bacon/pasta/garlic loving daughter, and needless to say, she LOVED it.  I didn't end up using spaghetti because I already had rotini boiling in the pot.  I have now made this 2 days in a row for her for lunch and she wants it again tomorrow.  I was able to sneak a few bites, and even though I am not a big parmesan, I really liked this and am planning on making this for the family for dinner this week.  I also used turkey bacon because I already had some cooked in the fridge, and it tasted just fine.  Thanks for such a good recipe!

This was delicious! I halved the recipe for two. We also added extra parm and more bacon. I've always loved carbonara because it's so easy to make - especially with these ingredients [as opposed to cream, etc]. Definitely have made this a few times!

awesome recipe...added extra parmesan and some half and half at the same time that i added the egg to the pasta mixture. timing is really important; once the egg is added, quickly mix/toss til egg has set and then get it off the heat and serve!

My husband was stationed in Italy in the Navy and for 25 years I have tried to reproduce the carbonara that he remembered from Naples.  Well... he says this is exactly what he loved and requests it on a regular basis.  Thanks for sharing your recipe and ending my carbonara failures.

I made exactly as recipe stated (added the wine). I think it was kind of bland and I used a whole package of thick cut bacon! This was edible but I wouldn't make it again. :-(

This was good, but my family felt it needed something extra. I'll add the white wine next time. Perhaps that's the 'extra' that makes this a 5-start recipe. It was a nice change from our traditional spaghetti dinners. I'll keep it. Happy Eating! :o)

It was good. Just a little dry, I thought. But my family loved it, and husband went back for seconds!

Thanks for the great recipe! Loved the taste and ease of preparation. My husband took one bite and asked me when I can make this again. I will definitely make this again as he gobbled up most of it leaving me with just a small portion. Next time must remember to double the serving size!

Love it! Saved some of the pasta water in case it turns out dry. Have made this a few times and have sometimes had to add the extra liquid. BUT! I'm also cooking gluten-free pasta, so that may not happen to you!

A new family favorite.  Even all four kids loved it, with my 6yo asking if I could make it again tomorrow.  I followed suggestion of reviewers to add parmesan to eggs before adding to noodles.  Also use a whole pack of bacon instead of just 8 slices.

This dish was excellent.  I was full after the first helping, but it was so good I had to go back for seconds.  I added peas, mushrooms and diced tomatoes - very yummy!  Will definitely make again!

While this dish came out amazing and received rave reviews from the fam, I can't rate the original 5 stars because I made so many changes.  I reduced the onion as many reviewers recommended, used spelt pasta instead of wheat and turkey bacon instead of pork.  I also added peas and used a combination of almond mozzerella and seasoned feta cheeses in place of the parmesan due to allergies.  I beat the eggs and stirred in the cheese with the eggs as others suggested.  The KEY, however, was to temper the eggs with hot, starchy pasta water before adding it to the bacon/noodle mixture.  This also helped thin the sauce a little, without adding extra calories.  While it made a pretty big mess, the result was creamy and absolutely delicious.  EVERYONE went back for seconds.  Thank you so much for the fabulous base-recipe!!

I LOVE this recipe!  Carbonara is my Moms favourite dish - so for years I've been using whatever recipe I came across because I had never found a favourite.  This is the PERFECT base.  I've always added chicken and mushrooms (when you're making something this decadent you owe it to yourself to go all out) but that's personal preference.  I've finally found my keeper.  Thank you for posting this recipe!

I made as directed, and took the direction to mix the eggs and cheese together before pouring onto spaghetti. The onion was over powering.  And I love onions.  I have never had carbonara before and the uncooked eggs made me nervous.  It tasted okay but my stomach didn't like it.  Thanks anyway.

Yummy...I followed the recipe exactly except I did mix the eggs and parm...it was very good.  I think I overcooked it somewhat because I was "scared" of the egg/parm mixture but next time I will get it perfect...A hit with the husband...the kids were so-so...I guess you just can't beat Chef Boy-R-D with that gang:)  The reheating instructions to use 50% power was right on, by the way.

I got scrambled eggs!!  I did some research on food network and found that the eggs would do better at room temp and that you need to either turn down the temp on the stove after you place the egg mixture in or take the pasta off direct heat and add in the egg mixture.  Giada also added a 1/4 to 1/2 cup of cream.

Wow!!! This was my first time making Carbonara and it was such an easy/tasty recipe. I highly recommend it. It is tricky getting the doing the sauce at the end but I think it just takes practice. :) I tried to stick to the recipe but, of course, made some adjustments. I added baby bella mushrooms and used shallots instead of onions. Wonderful meal!

This is so yummy. Added a little less pasta than recipe called for and mixed cheese with eggs. Also added about 4 tbsp of the hot pasta water to the egg/cheese mixture to temper the eggs so they wouldnt scramble when they hit the hot pasta. My daughter requests this ALL the time and it is easy.

Very good!!! The only downfall I saw was the sauce to pasta ratio was too low.  I'd just use less pasta next time...maybe 2/3 of what the recipe calls for.

This was okay.  I must have done something wrong because it turned out pasty no matter how much olive oil I used.  I followed the recipe exactly up until the point where you add the egg and Parmesan.  I followed the advice of others and combined the egg and parmesan, which was fine, but I also followed the advice of adding extra parmesan and it may have been too much.  If I make this again I will try adding just the amount of parmesan recommended.

I love my family's carbonara but felt like trying something different. This recipe was okay, but not very traditional in my opinion. The onion kind of overpowered the taste of the egg/cheese combination and though I love heavy garlic in almost everything, I think the garlic may have been a little overpowering for this particular dish. I come from an Italian family so it might just be a different than what I am used to.     Also, I would recommend combining the parmesan cheese with the egg in a bowl. Then adding mixture with to the pasta immediately after the pasta is drained in a separate bowl and not over the stove top, the stove top will cook the eggs too fast and you won't get the carbonara texture. The heat of the spaghetti should be enough to cook the eggs

Out of this world!  To the people who said it was to dry...they probably cooked the egg to long, or didn't use enough olive oil.  Magnificent!

This is good, nothing spectacular.  I was hesitant to make this because I couldn't get past the fact that it contains raw eggs.   Added peas, sun dried tomatoes, and mushrooms to the dish to add more flavor.

This is an awesome recipe! We really loved this dish. I also added the parm cheese, and a bit more than called for, to the beaten eggs. I also used less spaghetti. The wine gives a wonderful depth of flavor to the sauce. Just had to say thanks for a great recipe!!

This was good, but here are some tips:  I took the advice of some others and combined egg and parm together before putting it in pasta.  The recipe NEEDED more bacon.  Also, I had to make an additional mixture of sauce because it was too dry, so I would double that to start with.  I also added chicken.

This was good, but I wouldn't say it was great. Definitely needs more of everything. Also, needs salt and pepper and lots of it. We also added parmasan cheese, which made the dish. Otherwise it was pretty bland and dry. I also had to add more oil. I used turkey bacon doesn't make any grease. Maybe thats why. Thats my opinion on it anyway.

Out of this world.  My husband brought unexpected company home at dinner time and I was terrified since I had planned for us to have leftovers.  I would usually have most of the ingredients on hand anyways for this recipe which is a big plus, but I had actually put this on our menu to have this week anyhow so I whipped out the ingredients and hoped it was company worthy AND WOW YES IT WAS!!  The guest raved and wanted the recipe!  So I didn't have to kill my husband after all.  It was creamy and very impressive.  I did add 3/4 c warmed heavy cream at the end, I used 4-5 pressed garlic cloves (we are garlic lovers and could have added more for our taste), and I did not have fresh parsley so I thinly sliced some scallions for the same effect and it presented wonderfully plus added a nice subtle onion.  A definite keeper and a new family favorite.  My husband loves bacon and eggs as well as spaghetti, so this dish is a match made in heaven.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this with less pasta as it was only for 2, and then ended up recooking the whole dish again the next night - it was that good.  I added a little cayenne but kept everything else the same.  This is a great dish that uses ingredients that I had around the house.

Great recipe, but didn't turn out as pretty as the picture. Maybe next time - Is there a trick to making it get creamier - mine looked like it had some scrambled egg bits if you looked very close.

I made this for brunch today and it was wonderful.  I used angel hair pasta instead of spaghetti, because it was what I had on hand. I will be making this for our family get together this coming weekend.

When I read some of these reviews, I was a little nervous about making this. But I decided to make it for my brother and my husband and it was FANTASTIC!!! I added an extra egg so that I would have a little more saucy. I added the parmesan cheese to my eggs and mixed it together before adding it to the spaghetti. I also added  a lot of garlic! Whenever the recipe called for olive oil, I just used the bacon fat that was left over from the bacon. The end result was amazing, creamy, and tasty! If you love bacon, you definitely enjoy this recipe!! :)

It was good, all but one kid loved it.  Something happened though that there was almost no sauce, it was completely absorbed by the pasta.  More likely a cook's mistake that recipe.  We will try it again but suing pancetta, peas, and cherry tomatoes.  It needed a little extra umph.

Excellent!  I added frozen peas (just so there's some veggies in there!) and an extra egg for the heck of it and it was soooo good! We went back for seconds and put it away so that we wouldn't fight over thirds...

This was really tasty. I did have to sub Romano cheese for the Parmesan because I didn't have any. I know. I know. A household without Parmesan cheese? Forget about it! *UPDATE* Without the wine, it's not as tasty.

Delish!  This recipe is perfect as written.  Even my five year old pickey eater loved it.  Mine probably wasn't as creamy perfect as a professional, but with repeated practice I hope to make it there.  Try this recipe, you won't be sorry.

I think this is the best recipe for Spaghetti Carbonara that I have ever tried.  I did make a lot of changes to the recipe for various reasons (picky eaters, making it healthier, didn't have the ingredient on hand), and I'm sure that my substitutions made the recipe less tasty.  My five star rating is based on this recipe without changes.  I left out the onion, wine, and parsley, used less pasta, used turkey bacon and egg substitute, and added a little more olive oil because the turkey bacon didn't have drippings to reserve.  I think the turkey bacon was the worst substitution I made.  It's just not a good replacement for pork bacon, although it's healthier.  I thought the egg substitute worked well, although it may have made a less rich sauce than eggs would have.  I stirred the parmesan cheese into the egg substitute before adding it to the hot noodles, and I didn't have any trouble with the eggs overcooking.

So very easy!   I had more than enough bacon grease (low quality bacon, haha) so the whole thing was very bacon-y and not dry. I love how the eggs and cheese coat the pasta and the flavors complement the bacon well. I skipped the wine because I didn't have any. I've been enjoying the leftovers cold and hot all week.

I've never had Carbonara before so I don't have anything to compare this recipe to.  I know that the eggs aren't suppose to scramble but some of mine did, my pan was too hot even though I removed it from the heat.  It was still pretty good though.

UPDATE: MY HUBS AND I ARE ON A BUDGET (I AM STILL UNEMPLOYED), SO I HAVE BEEN ON THE LOOKOUT FOR ECONOMICAL RECIPES THAT CALL FOR INGREDIENTS I ALREADY HAVE. NOT ONLY WAS THIS CHEAP, IT WAS DARN GOOD (BETTER THAN I REMEMBER) THIS TIME AROUND! I LEFT OUT THE BELL PEPPER AND CREAM (I ADDED BEFORE), BUT FOLLOWED THIS EXACT FROM THERE. PERFECT! :) Not bad. Halving this made more than enough pasta for my bf and I. As with most anything I try for the first time, I made a few modifications (both personal & based upon other reviewer's suggestions). Here's what I did: a) added ~ 1 c. of frozen (thawed) green peas, 1/4 c. chopped red bell pepper and 1/3 c. (room temperature) heavy whipping cream, b) used 2 cloves of garlic & 5 strips of bacon (I wanted to use up what was left from a previous recipe) and c) mixed my eggs / Parm cheese together, THEN added this mixture to my warm (not hot!) cooked pasta. My bf & I both agree that the bacon & garlic taste was almost very subtle. Our pasta was also a little dry, but I think that's my fault - I was a bit too generous with the spaghetti lol!!! NOTE: Be SURE to add combine your egg / cheese FIRST and add it when your pasta is warm. Otherwise, you'll end up cooking your eggs! All in all, this was decent and paired well with crunchy sesame breadsticks, a tossed salad (mixed with sliced Granny Smith apples, blue cheese crumbles, Craisins & honey mustard dressing) & spumoni ice cream for dessert. Thanks for sharing your recipe, SABRINATEE! :-)

Very very good! I cooked the bacon in the oven (cut down on the mess and grease)added 1/4 cup dry vermouth instead of white wine to the onions, some green peas and 1/2 cup half & half, and it turned out marvelous!

Made this last night for the family.  It was a huge hit!!  At first my husband thought oh it's just pasta.  Then after the second helping decided I could make that anytime!    I did go with another reviewers tip and combined the cheese & eggs before adding to pasta.  Perfect...no bits of egg!!  I was a little nervous about that point.  DELISH!!  It's a fav

WOW!  What a great alternative to your typical spaghetti. My very picky husband gobbled it up.  Mine was not dry though, like other people mentioned.  But I made a couple changes, so not sure if that is why it didn't dry out.  Since I was only cooking for two, I only used half a box of spagheetti.  I also tempered my egg by bringing them to room temperature before beating and slowly adding bacon grease to the eggs.  I also did not add the eggs to the noodles in a hot pan, so my eggs did not scramble.  I also added frozen petite peas.  Good luck, as there is a little bit of technique required for this so as not to scramble your sauce.

My picky little eaters LOVED this recipe. Easy to make and was eaten quickly!! Was a little dry, but with some practice I am sure I will figure out what I did wrong...

Loved this :) The only thing I did different was used Turkey bacon and loved it!!! I have been looking for this recipe for a long time- it was worth the wait. I bit sticky- not sure why- But loads of flavor and loved every bite. The kids ate it right up as well as the Husband- thanks

This is a great recipe. I used just regular bacon and found that I needed more. The pasta over powered the bacon. It was still really good though. I also highly recommend using the wine. It comes out really dry without it. And serving it right away is also a must. My dried out before the husband got home. I served it with garlic bread and it was a BIG hit.

I have never had spaghetti carbonara before so I didn't know what to expect. I figured it would be good since the recipe includes 3 of my favorite ingredients: pasta, bacon & eggs. Definitely a good, cheap & easy recipe. The real test is when my husband comes home. If he likes it I'll raise my rating to 4 stars.  Update: Husband loved it.

Added mushrooms and a little bit of cream. Start boiling pasta before step 2 since Step 1 takes the longest.

My husband and I made this for valentine's day.  He is a typical "where's the meat" kind of guy, but we enjoyed it a lot.  We let our daughter have some for breakfast the next morning and she loved it as well - said she wants it every morning... We used pancetta and used the suggestion of another reviewer and used 1/2 wine and 1/2 cream instead of all wine.  Will make again.

The reason that some of the eggs come out scrambled is because you are not "tempering" the eggs.  Add a bit up the hot pasta water- just a tablespoon or two to the egg mixture very slowly and you will not have that problem.  Good recipe

This was a very good recipe. I halved the recipe, but otherwise made it almost exactly as stated. The only change I made was to add a splash of whole milk with the eggs. DH asked me to make it again - five stars!

My only real gripe with this recipe is probably my own fault- I didn't bother to measure the amount of olive oil, so I it came out too greasy for my taste.  Also, next time I will use less onion, as otherwise that's the strongest flavor in the whole dish!

If I could give this recipe six stars, I would, it's THAT good!  I had it last night and I think I dreamed about it last night LOL.  Ever since I had the real thing in Italy, I've been searching and searching for something like it here, finding myself really disappointed when I order it at restaurants.  THIS recipe is it!  I did use only half of a large onion because it was all I had and I don't think I would have wanted more.  I think the white wine should definitely be included.  Some people suggest adding heavy cream to the recipe, it does take away from the authenticity of carbonara but who cares, it sounds delicious too!  Just don't overdo the cream or you'll interfere with the other flavors.  One important piece of advice to handle the egg, as other reviewers mentioned, is to beat the eggs in with the parm cheese first and make sure it's well mixed before adding it to the pasta.  Use good parm cheese for this recipe, I actually used Locatelli instead because I prefer the flavor. Thanks for an AWESOME recipe!

Totally hit the spot.  Now that I'm writing it all out, I guess I made more changes than I thought...Penne instead of spaghetti, 2 large shallots instead of an onion, butter instead of olive oil, chicken stock instead of white wine.  All these subs were b/c it's what I had not b/c I think any were needed.   I combined the eggs, cheese and parsley along with 1/4 cup of half and half and then poured it over the pasta at the end and tossed. It was terrific.

I don't know why but I just didn't enjoy this recipe. Perhaps it was because of how oily it was or maybe it needed some more flavor. What ever the reason I don't think I will make it again.

I didn't have any wine so I left that out, otherwise I followed the recipe as is and it turned out pretty good.  We hadn't had spaghetti carbonara before, but we both enjoyed it.  Next time I think I might add some grilled chicken to make it more of a meal, but it's good as is.

Wow! What a great recipe! My husband and I were both a little sketchy about spaghetti with no sauce and covered in eggs of all things but we didn't miss the sauce at all! I have never had or made this before but I will make again soon. I followed the recipe as written and added red pepper flakes and garlic powder after the eggs were added. I also added a liberal amount of fresh ground pepper to the bacon as it cooked. What a great dinner with ingredients I already had around the kitchen. I can't wait to eat it for lunch tomorrow!

I was really excited to try this recipe.  Unfortunately, I found the sauce very hard to make.  The eggs become solid and lumpy when I followed the directions.  I obviously did something wrong.  I might try this again if I knew how to fix it as it was tasty despite the lumps.

This was good. I thought that it would be similar to the Cheesecake Factory's Carbonara...it was in taste but it was rather dry. After making it, i decided to add seasoned chicken breasts sauteed in olive oil. Next, I added about 1 cup of milk to give it a creamier texture...The pan was finished quickly! It tastes good with or without the modifications!

my husband and i loved the flavor of this. Although i would cut pasta in half it was a little dry maybe because i used penne and its a little more absorbant than spaghetti.. Overall great flavor i will make this again!!!

we all loved this including my 4 yr old. I did do just a couple of things. First I just used the pre cooked fidge. bacon so I didn't have to fry. Added dried onion so I didn't need the fat. Used about 3/4 cup cheese and finally used one of the smallest cans evaporated milk for the wine. Sounds like a lot of changes but not really. Just made it a little quicker, a little less fat maybe, and not so dry. It was really great and not frying bacon was a great time saver. Just cut the bacon and add to the hot pasta. My husband ate the left overs the next day and said it was just as good.

Delicious! I gave it four stars because you need either more bacon or less pasta. I would at least put four more slices of bacon. Other than that, yum!

Pretty good.  I think the amount of pasta is greater than the amount of sauce.  I would closer to a 1/2 pound next time.

This was delicious, with no substitutions or additions.  I was worried about tasting slimy raw egg with each bite, but the egg/cheese mixture came together perfectly.  I couldn't resist, I even had some for breakfast the next morning.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Made this for a dinner party and everyone raved about how good it was.  Very easy to make which automatically gets high stars from me.  Followed others suggestions and added extra bacon, mixed eggs and cheese mix before adding to spaghetti noodles.  Quick abd delish!!!

This is a great recipe for last minute meals! Our kids love it! I substitute chicken, ham and prosciutto for the bacon to make it lighter.

Wow!  I've never had this dish before today.  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I used a red onion (what I already had) and I used two whole eggs and two egg yolks.  This was a FANTASTIC dish.

Delicious! I was hesitant about making this but I'm glad I did. I halved the recipe since I had half of an open box of spaghetti, and only two eggs left until tomorrow...lol. I omitted the onion since my husband is allergic. Added garlic powder to the end result since my attempt to add fresh garlic resulted in burnt garlic (lol...my pan was too hot). So I had to dump all of the bacon fat. Added the peas from last nights dinner. My 19 month old gobbled this up in an instant...peas and all! Last night he wouldn't even try the peas!

I've been making this for a few years now & it is an absolute staple in our house....we have it probably twice a month. I use Whole Wheat Spaghetti & Turkey Bacon to make it a little healthier. I also use 6 eggs & 3-4 cloves of garlic. Also a whole bag(8 oz. I think) of Parmesan cheese. YUM!! A big bowl of this spaghetti is all you need!

I was a little squeamish about the nearly-raw eggs, but I decided to make this for my very-traditional hubby, and he's now finishing his second serving.  The sauce wasn't as rich or creamy as I thought it should be, and the flavor wasn't my favorite; but I will give it another try & follow the recipe more carefully, with one exception--next time I will add much more FRESH Parmesan cheese.

This was great! I'm a single mother that works all day and doesn't want to spend half the night cooking with hungry kids running about, and this dish is perfect for me. The kids loved it! They ate up the whole pot. 

Thanks!

For once I followed a recipe without tweaking. I really enjoyed this, and am glad that I made it. My husband would have liked it better "without the onions, the wine, and the eggs". He's hopeless. I'll be making this again, I'll just have to wait for when my husband is in the field.

This pasta is very tasty. I did as a previous post suggested and mix the egg and cheese together with heavy cream and then added that mixture to the pasta.  It turned out nice and creamy.

This recipe was delicious and the WHOLE family loved it (even the picky 10 year old)!  The flavors were amazing and you just can't go wrong with eggs, bacon, cheese and pasta!  The only small negative was that it was a little dry, so I might use another reviewer's suggestion of adding a bit of heavy cream to moisten it more.  Otherwise this dish was a HUGE hit in our household and I will most definitely make it again and SOON!  Thank You!

I made this last night for the first time. I thought there would be enough for lunch the next day. I was wrong! It disappeared. This is definitely going to be made again. My boyfriend requested more bacon next time but everything tasted wonderful.  I just had to add something more. We've been trying to find ways to cut back on calories so we grill or smoke a lot of our meats and vegetables these days. I've tried this recipe by substituting smoked chicken, turkey or salmon instead of bacon. DELICIOUS!!! I've also used red onion for color and added fresh mushrooms and sauteed in olive oil.

Good recipe - very rich! It doesn't specify the heat to cook the bacon on, which was fine - I know how to cook bacon - but it doesn't tell you to change the temperature before you put the eggs in.  Mine almost scrambled, but I saved them.  The recipe should be more specific.

This was my first experience with preparing spaguetti carbonara and I was pleasantly suprised at the simplicity of it. Although I didn't personally eat it (too much fat and calories for me) I did something I never do and I experimented with a new recipe on company! Everyone said it was very good and I believe it because almost all of it got eaten.  After reading other reviews I cut down on the amount of spaguetti and i combined the egg and parmesan cheese before adding. Served with a tossed salad and french bread with an olive oil and garlic dipping sauce.

this recipe was bland. I followed the recipe verbatim but my family all agreed...there really wasn't a whole lot of flavor.  If you like a lot of flavor or spice in your menu then avoid this particular recipe as you will be dissapointed.

My first spaghetti dish and it came out so deliciously. I'm not a red meat eater so I took out the bacon, and substituted white onions for green onions. I will definitely make this again!

4.5 stars; it's simple and easy to cut in half.  I used maple bacon (my preference), and skipped the wine. When I started eating it, I thought it could have used a little more bacon but the onions made me quickly toss out that idea.  It turned out perfectly.

If you're used to a creamier (more alfredo) version of this dish, you might be disappointed. Also, I expect a dish that incorporates bacon fat to be less bland. Heavy whipping cream would make this better, but I won't be making again.

I'd never had carbonara before and was a little worried about using raw eggs as a sauce, especially making it myself, but it turned out delicious!  Have made this twice now, following the recipe pretty closely.  Tasted best with parmigiano reggiano that I shredded myself at home.

Very tasty!! I used center-cut bacon (adding a couple extra slices). This makes a thrifty meal. Good with green salad. Note: if making the entire recipe, I suggest using a stockpot; a 12" skillet is fine for 1/2 of the recipe, but not big enough for the whole recipe. This recipe is a winner! I will make it often.

Wow.  I whipped this up quickly without a trip to the grocery.  Flavor was awesome.  Simple, fresh, delicious.  I served it with a salad with balsamic vinegar.  Would've made or bought bread, but as I said, I whipped this up in a jiffy.  This will be a new standard fast meal in our house.  It might even be a nice side dish occasionally. Mmmm.

I will make again, as it has a fantastic base to it.  I found it too dry, so next time I'd use less pasta.  I'd double the garlic and bacon .  Sprinkle with hot pepper flakes and I'd think it would be a five star recipe.

My husband nor I had ever tried carbonara before, so with nothing to compare it to, we liked it. It was very simple to put together. While eating it, a couple of tomatoes fell off my bruschetta into it, and got me to thinking that maybe diced tomatoes would be delicious in this dish also! But as is, we really enjoyed it and I am sure I will be making this one again. Thanks for the recipe!

When I told the people that I made this for that they were about to have bacon, eggs and spaghetti for dinner they looked at me like I was crazy. They all loved it and there was none left over. I will definitely make this again. Thank you!

This dish was very tasty, althought I thought you could have easily used a pound of bacon. I also used only 3 eggs instead of 4. Good brunch recipe.

I made this pretty much as listed, and I loved that it didn't take cream like most listed. We didn't use wine or parsley, and used Canadian Bacon cooked pretty crisp. My kids LOVED this! I halved the recipe, and shouldn't have because we ate it all! I will probably be making it again next week because it's a new family favorite. To answer some commments - you don't cook the egg so that it tastes like scrambled eggs. It just coats the pasta and makes it fabulous with the cheese! Yummy!

So good! I didn't bother with the parsley, though the color would have been pretty. But I did add mini shrimp, which both my husband and I really thought added a lot to the taste. Next time we make it we want to add peas and diced tomatoes.

Wasn't sure how eggs and noodles would taste, but I am so glad I tried this new recipe. It was excellent and a new family favorite. All the flavors blended really well, and the egg gave a wonderful texture. I added a couple more tablespoons of olive oil than suggested just because I don't like dry noodles, but there was enough eggs that I really didn't need the extra olive oil. Great dinner!!

I made a few changes to the recipe - half pound proscuitto instead of bacon; basalmic vinegar instead of white wine, and sweet onion instead of regular onion.

My husband and I loved the multiple layers of savory and sweet tastes!!!  I would make this for company!!!

One caveat:  since this recipe has a lot going on during the cooking, followed by serving immediately, it's not the kind of thing I'd cook if I was watching young children.

I had never eaten spaghetti carbonara before and I had no idea what I was missing.  I used a whole package of bacon.  I didn't feel like chopping so I didn't add the onion or garlic, instead I put onion salt and garlic powder in the beaten eggs.  I also added about 3/4 can evaporated milk to the eggs.  I also skipped the wine and fresh parsley.  This was awesome, I'll probably make this once a week.  My new favorite food!

The first time I made this, they almost licked the bowl clean!  I do add 1/2 & 1/2 or cream, more bacon, & less pasta.  I serve mushrooms & peas on the side.

Pretty good, not great.  I added a little more bacon than called for, otherwise no changes.  I think I might prefer this with a different pasta like penne, but it was an ok meal as is.

Yum - Not the best carbonara i have had, obviously the crown for that goes to my favourite restaurant down the road! But this was a fine substitute... cheaper too! Used good quality parmesan... and i added about 8 shallotts/spring onions (not sure what you guys call them - in Australia we call them Spring Onions- the long thin sprouts) for extra flavour, as carbonara can be bland.. but this was delicous. Thanks!

I used turkey bacon, added a little feta cheese and marsala wine. It turned out great. Even my 91 year old nana loved it and she hates everything made with pasta.

My husband and I loved this! I did make a few changes: Doubled quantity of cheese, used 1/3 cup white wine instead of 1/4, stirred cheese and eggs into pasta just after it was drained without returning it to the burner. Also used penne because I was out of spaghetti. Didn't need to add any additional salt. I will definitely make this again! How can you go wrong with bacon, eggs and pasta?

I thought that this was ok.  My husband wouldn't eat it... he is pretty picky.  My toddler who loves "noonas" (noodles for those not trained in toddler-ese) wouldn't eat it either.  Bummer!  It sounded so good.

A great recipe and very easy. The fault was mine. Trying to "do the right thing," I used turkey bacon which left no drippings and sacrificed flavor. Next time will go the distance. I really liked that I had all the ingredients on hand. Excellent for a week night. May try to add sausage next time.

This recipe was great.  I added 3 cloves of garlic [I LOVE garlic], a ton of parsley, and topped it off with finely sliced green onions.  I was pretty liberal with the wine too [it was a good bottle].  I was too afraid of the fat content, so I left the recipe as is, and didn't add any creme as others did.  A fantastic treat, and I'll definitely this make again, although I won't be eating this one regularly!

Not my favorite italian dish for so many calories!  Not very creamy, had tons left over - hubby only had one small serving, won't add this to my dinner rotation.

Really enjoyed this recipe.  We dine out at Italian restaurants often.  This could rival some of the best if you use your own common sense with texture.   Very good.  Definitely will make many times over.  Thank you.

Good recipe but had to modify because it came out a little dry and a bland: added a little more olive oil, cheese, and garlic, used beer because I didn't have white wine, and added 2 tablespoons of sour cream. Was very easy to modify and tasted great.

I am 47 years old and this is my first time making stuffed peppers. I used a jar of marinara sauce instead. I too  covered the pan instead of basting.I  cooked some onions with the beef and added fresh garlic instead of powder. Topped it off with some mozzarella last 10 ten minutes. It tasted pretty good but needs just a bit more seasoning. Good comfort food on a cold winter day.

The first time I made it I was very careful to follow the recipe exactly and it was awesome.  The next two times I got a little sloppy and it was good but not as good as the first time.  This time I was careful to follow the recipe and it was much better.  I add more garlic than called for, but we prefer it that way.

Fantastic carbonara recipe! I always thought you needed some kind of cream (single cream or heavy cream) to make carbonara sauce... but this one only needed eggs and cheese and came out so yummy! Love it love it... And it tastes even nicer (IMO) with the bacon fried quite crisp! Will make it a regular staple...

We really liked this -- my 5 year old actually asked for THIRDS!!!  My "I hate all carbs" husbande liked it, but he said it "had no zing" (of course, he also thinks that suicide wings don't have enough zing, so take it as you will...)  It was actually a little plain, but it I didn't put any salt or pepper on it at the end, and I made the recipe mostly exactly (I left out the onions, and I used a "white" zinfandel as I didn't have any actual white wine).  All in all, this will become a regular meal in our house (and I'll just give my husband a bottle of hot chili sauce to pour onto it... ugh!)

Very good recipe. I am giving it only 4 stars due to the fact I had to add way more bacon and more oil than called for. I did use the wine as well and that really makes the flavour.  I used another readers suggestion and used cream, I will not be doing that again. Made this dish to creamy and it shouldn't be that way. I also mixed the eggs (3) with the cheese and tossed with the pasta just before serving. Overall a great recipe that I will be making again.

My mother used to make this for us when we were kids.  It has always been a favorite, and this recipe just enhances and adds to everything I remember growing up as a kid.  I like to replace the wine with cream, though.  But that's just a personal taste.  ;)  Five stars, all the way.

Very rich.  I thought it tasted great before I added the eggs in.  The eggs made it so rich.  To tell you the truth I like it without the eggs.  Maybe nextime I should just add 2 eggs instead.  Anyways my husband hated onions so I omitted the onions and added mushroom and tomatoes.  I accidentely left the heat on and slightly scamble the egg.  I was a bite disspointed, maybe that is why it seem so rich.  I will make this again, hopefully I will not scramble the eggs.  Thank Sandy.

I gave this a 5 because the taste was excellent!!  Mine did turn out a bit dry though.  I used lass pasta and a little more olive oil, and it was still kind of dry.  More olive oil next time I think.  But overall, an excellent meal!

An excellent Spaghetti Carbonara.  I made it with Turkey Bacon and added some chopped mushrooms and green onion as well the second time I made it, and it was just as good.  One note:  It does require a little more olive oil than the recipe lists.

First time turned out excellent.  I did everything but the egg ahead of time, then reheated and "egg-ed" just before serving about 2 hours later.  No probs whatsoever.

This recipe was okay.  Based on other reviews, we used less pasta than what was called for.  We found the dish very rich, a little bit went a long way.  On the plus side, it was a quick dish - combined with a green salad and some french bread it was reasonably good and quick for a weeknight meal

I LOVE this recipe. My mom used to make this for my brother and I all the time as it is our favorite meal. I cooked it for my inlaws and they absolutely loved it. We never could remember what the actual name of it was until my brothers best friend came over before he left for Germany. We always called it Cheese Spaghetti. My best friend used to put Ranch dressing on EVERYTHING she ate, but this! She said it would completely spoil it!

Well I don't think there is anything I would change in this recipe, and that is something.  The whole family liked it and that is REALLY something, it was a big hit.  Only changed a few things: Less spaghetti used, probably about 300 grams (6 servings); used only 3 eggs, since there was less pasta; no salt or pepper added, it was great as it was.  Try with extra virgin olive oil for a kick...mmmm...

I liked this recipe for the fact that I had most of the ingredients on hand and also because it was fairly easy to assemble, but overall I felt it was lacking something. I added skim milk and that made it creamier, but next time I'd add more bacon and perhaps peas and sauteed mushrooms. Seemed like the overall flavor was just "pasta" - I'll use this more as a side dish in the future.

This was blah...I even like all the ingredients in it too!  No flavor whatsoever!  I added more bacon and tried kicking it up a notch to save it with pepper flakes, but still didn't help.  Only good thing about this is that it's edible.  BIG disappointment!

Had this for dinner tonite....loved it!  Great weeknight or Sunday night dinner.  Usually have ingredients on hand.  To cut down on the fat, I used Egg Beaters in place of the eggs and it turned out great, couldn't tell the difference.  I also used half turkey bacon and half regular bacon.  I recommend using the wine, gives it a nice flavor.  I used a chardonnay.  Thumbs up!!!

Awesome!  Easy, quick, and delicious.  If you want to make the dish a bit more substantial and add some zip, throw in some chicken and capers.  Delicious!  Thanks for the recipe.  I've made it several times already and my husband requests it all the time.

It tasted great with the wine, but there wasn't much sauce after mixing it with the egg.  How do you make it more saucy?

I got a recipe by Ricardo for Carbonara in my local paper and it was great. My biggest problem was cooking the eggs but not scrambling them. His recipe calls for no wine, pancetta and four egg yolks - yeah, I thought the same thing but it is FAN-TASTIC!! You combine the yolks, the cheese (Parm and Pecorino) and 1/4 cup of pasta water in a bowl which the pasta goes into. It gives you a lovely, creamy sauce.

My Nonna never put onions or garlic in her pasta carbonara. Needless to say my Nonna never added peas either.  Guanciale, eggs and cheese are the only ingredients needed to make pasta alla carbonara.

It’s a great recipe. I will make a technique suggestion. After draining the pasta and saving some cooking water, drizzle a little of the water into the eggs while whisking. This tempers the eggs and prevents them from scrambling. Then the mixture can be put with the other ingredients and stirred into the pasta.

First time making this and absolutely loved it.  The only addition I made was to add 3/4 cup cream when done and tossing for a second.  That was included in a review by another subscriber, and it made extra creamy.  Will definitely be making this again!!

Super yum.   I’m not one to measure everything too precisely so maybe mine is a bit different.   From 250g of pasta, two large servings turned up and it was fantastic.  Instead of spaghetti I used Linguini, because that’s what I had in the cupboard.

This turned out great! I read some of the reviews and decided to add a can of mushroom slices without the water, to the onion mixture. I also thoroughly mixed up the eggs and parm seperately, and then tossed everything together. I skipped the white wine as I didn't have any, but it turned out smooth and creamy.  I will absolutely use again, and I would consider adding some peas if I had them on hand, that would be a great veggie addition.

Instead of bacon, use prosciutto, pancetta,, or we use soppressata because we just prefer that flavor over the other two. But either of the three make this dish taste way better than using bacon. As far as amounts, 4 oz. (diced) of the meats per pound of pasta. We also only use egg yolks. Don't know why, as my version comes from a recipe I got from my neighbor when living in Sicily. And wine is NOT an option, it should be mandatory.

I wasn't super confident about making this dish with the "make sure the pasta is cooled enough, but not too cool and not too hot that the eggs...".  It has ingredients that my family loves ...bacon, pasta, and eggs (With our own chickens now another great way to use them! Next time I'm trying it with duck eggs.) I followed the recipe exactly, other than the wine, didn't have on hand,  and mixing the cheese with the eggs.  Not a single noodle was left!  Super happy that I took a chance and trusted the recipe, video, and all the reviews.

10/27/19 - Very good, very easy.  Made about 3/4 pound of spaghetti but all of the sauce - 1/2 cup milk (didn't have cream), 3/4 pound bacon (cut in 1/2 inch pieces and browned), 1/2 small onion, 3 eggs, 1/2 cup grated parm, pepper and about 1/4 tsp of nutmeg.  Also threw in two minced cloves of garlic and 1 cup of steamed peas.  Excellent recipe, looks elegant and colorful.

The whole family enjoyed this dish. Using 3/4 lb of pasta and 12 oz of bacon works for us. I follow the remaining measurements as stated in the recipe and make sure to beat the parmesan in with the eggs before tossing it with the pasta to keep the sauce smooth.

So good and easy. I didn't read the directions carefully, so I ended up whisking the parmesan into the egg and adding both at the same time to the pasta/bacon mix, and it was fine. I've also added a little sauteed or grilled corn and/or tomatoes for a more summery feel.

Made exactly as written, as I always do first time.  Excellent.  Do ingredients as written, but noticed a tip that worked well.  Someone suggested combine beaten eggs and grated Parmesan into pasta after it has slightly cooled.  This way eggs don't overcook and cheese melts seamlessly.  
Delicious recipe.  Thank you for sharing.

My favorite dish of all time!  I do prefer pancetta, but I am no bacon snob!  All bacon is good bacon!  For those afraid of the undercooked eggs, they do partially cook because of the hot spaghetti, and you can always leave it on the stove a minute longer to cook them more, especially if adding cream or wine.  Plus, in America (not sure about other countries) we have some of the safest eggs available because they are shipped so quickly from the farms.  Many people don't even refrigerate their eggs.  Things like raw oysters and mercury in tuna make me more nervous than this dish.  But that's just me.  Enjoy!

This is absolutely delicious. I made it according to the recipe the first time and loved it, but my husband complained it was too dry. So the second time I made it, I added a small bit (2-3 tbsp) of heavy whipping cream with the garlic, onions and bacon and let it thicken for a moment before adding back the pasta. I dispersed the sauce over the noodles- it was not heavy, but very light. Then I combined the parmesan cheese and eggs together as mentioned in another comment and added it to the noodles while still warm. It was a lot less dry and sticky this time and the cream added another dimension of flavor. I will be making this regularly! Thanks for the recipe

This was my first attempt at Carbonara and I was pleasantly surprised. I forgot to put the wine in and that would've given it nice flavor. My son added hot sauce to his which was a nice touch if you like things a bit hot. I will definitely make this again but possibly add grilled chicken.

This is one of my family's favorites. I will sometimes add chicken to add a little more protein. Everything else I follow, even with the wine.

I prepare and my grandson fixes the final dish. He told his mom that my carbonara is better than hers.  This isn’t good, but I think his involvement accounts for the full review. After prep, it is easy to involve a child and is quite tasty.

I agree with previous reviews to reduce the amount of pasta.  I'd also add a little season salt for some additional kick.  Delicious!

This was good, but I increased both the bacon and the cheese by about half and though I could have added more, particularly the cheese.  That was solvable at the table but next time I’ll increase the amount initially. I didn’t use the wine.

I made the sauce but used spinach cheese ravioli instead of spaghetti. It turned out great, except that I scrabbles the eggs a bit. I added a bit more wine than it called for and it could’ve used even more. (I used Chardonnay.)

I made this pasta according to the recipe, as this was my first yime making it. I would make this again with thinner spaghetti if not angel hair pasta. I enjoyed it and so did my boyfriend. This is a good recipe. I have seen others that have a lot of added cream; I like to avoid that when possible.

Classic carbonara! This is good any time of year and leftovers are even better the next day. I add a generous amount of chives for greenery and onion flavor as well as plenty of fresh parsley. I also toss in capers for a briny flavor. Always reserve some pasta water and add a ladle full at the end to keep the sauce creamy.

Wow! This is definitely a keeper! My picky husband went gaga over this. I followed the recipe pretty closely. I did not use the white wine or parsley. Also, I only had 2 eggs on hand so I added some milk to the beaten eggs before dumping it in the spaghetti mixture. I might add another garlic clove and more bacon next time. Can't wait to make again!

I won’t be one of those people who tells you how great this recipe is and follow it up with what I changed.  I did read the other reviews and I would like to try this with pancetta instead of traditional bacon.  I did learn a few things you should consider.  One pound of spaghetti is a lot for a pan so unless you have a really big one, it won’t fit.  I cooked one pound but when it was time to assemble the ingredients, only about 3/4 fit (leftover pasta for something else).  I didn’t scale back on the ingredients anywhere else and it was fine.  The recipe is right, no salt and I like the wine as a touch to help clean things up in the middle.  If you family likes bacon and cheese - consider 10 slices and 3/4 of a pound of fresh grated Parmesan cheese.

super easy and nothing was left after dinner was over. Definitely a meal that we will keep into the rotation. Used Pancetta vs. Bacon and Added Red Pepper Flakes to give it a little heat.

Perhaps I am not used to a traditional pasta carbonara, but when I order it at a restaurant, it usually has some what of a cream sauce. Wish this had that, other than that very good.

Great recipe. One variation I’ve done (at first ‘cuz it was what I had in the fridge!) was to use turkey bacon. You’re going to need about a tbsp of butter and possibly a bit more olive oil to compensate for the lack of bacon drippin’s, but the end result is delicious and a bit lighter.

This was super-delicious! I used pecorino cheese to grate over the top for a delightedly scrumptious finishing touch! I had cut the recipe down to one quarter of the amounts, and still had enough for a second meal. However, the leftovers were not as satisfying as the initial dish. My recommendation is to make only what you might need for a meal.

Not a favorite, but not too bad.  Seemed like it needed more or a different kind of sauce.  I added some chopped green onion to mine.

This is my favourite meal and this is the first time I’ve tried to make it myself. I would recommend using a whole 375g package of bacon, as well as combining the eggs, a whole cup of grated cheese, 3/4 cup of whipping cream and a half teaspoon of nutmeg in a bowl and then adding that to the skillet after removing it from the heat. Be sure not to cook it too much after adding the last ingredients, or it will be dry! I also used a couple extra garlic cloves and another tablespoon of oil and another dash of white wine, since it was a little dry. I didn’t find that it needed any salt either. I’m making it again tonight for company.

I tweaked it by adding dried chili flakes. This recipe is very easy to make after you have made it once; then you can start being creative.

I made this last night on one of those "we have nothing to make for dinner" nights. Subbed turkey bacon 'cause I don't do pork and added an extra clove of garlic. My husband and I were hurting from eating so much...this one will be a regular from now on.

Next time, I'll omit the black pepper as it killed the taste.  Also need toss while serving as the bacon settles to the bottom of the pan.  (Some of the dish was lunch for the next day)

Absolutely love this recipe! I mixed the parmesan with the egg and poured it to the spaghetti on a very low heat. When it looks like the egg is going to set, take the pan off from the heat and continue to mix. I did that for a few times until it doesn't smell eggy. Kind of like Gordon Ramsay's way of making scrambled eggs. I also added a splash of warm pasta water to make it creamy.

Since I made enough for one, I wished I added more olive oil to the sauce while some pasta stuck together even to the egg.  But it tasted real good put together. No tweaks that I can think of, since it was delicious.

Came out great. I’d recommend using the biggest pan you have or use the pot for the noodles for the final mix. You need a lot of room with a pound of pasta to mix it enough so the eggs cook onto the noodles and you don’t end up with scrambled egg chunks. Also, I added a little of the pasta water to add some creaminess.

I followed the original recipe, other than mixing the egg with the parmesan cheese before adding to the spaghetti.  My husband said it was the best carbonara he'd ever tasted, so it's definitely a keeper.  :-)

Outstanding recipe! I used fettucine instead of spaghetti because that’s what I had. I don’t believe it changed the integrity of the recipe. This was quick, easy and delicious. My BF and I ate the entire pound of pasta.

Makes way too much spaghetti.  I would use less next time.  Other than that, the recipe was good.  Next time I might add some crushed red pepper or a dash of cayenne pepper added in with the eggs to give it a little kick.

I made this mostly according to the recipe. I took advice from other reviewers and added the cheese to the eggs. I also added Pecorino Romano because it’s my favorite cheese. It was still a bit bland in my opinion but overall good. Thank you for this recipe.

The flavor was great, but the pasta was a little sticky with not enough sauce, and my husband didn't like it much.  Here's what I would do next time: use less pasta (1 lb. is way too much); mix the parmesan with the eggs before stirring into the sauce; add more liquid, whether it's pasta water or wine or cream. I will make it again with these changes, and will review again.

Great ingridient list and preparation,  however it is very important in carbonara for the eggs to be added with the cheese only after the stove is turned off for good, that way the heat from the noodles cooks the eggs but there is no excess heat to cause the whites to cook in to white chunks.

As most people said, I used less pasta, and rather enjoyed this. Not being a big fan of dry pastas and this have such a large ratio of pasta, i can only give it 3 stars, but I think with the less pasta, it is pretty good.

This recipe was fantastic!! I had never used beaten eggs mixed raw into a dish that turned out tasting so good! I used bacon and Prosciutto in the mix and the dish turned out so good. I would not change anything as far as taste goes in this recipe but I will warn its all about timing when using the eggs. Try it and you will not be disappointed.

Was excited to make this recipe because I always have bacon on hand, and how could it be bad?  But I made this as written and really didn't care for it.  Note: pouring wine into the hot bacon grease and EVOO is a mess.  I'll look for a more traditional recipe using pancetta.

This was absolutely delicious and I'll definitely make it again. Everyone had more than one helping. I made it exactly as the recipe said. A winner! If I wasn't lying here on the couch ridiculously full, I'd totally be scoffing more straight from the pot. Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this the 4th time for the household and it's always a hit. Everyone at home is used to eating the creamy-sloppy kind of carbonara but this just blew them away. This is legit. I personally do not enjoy any cream some people put on carbonara. But this recipe is excellent. It's for keeps! 

I switched to adding the bacon after I've finished mixing the wet ingredients (eggs, oil). This way the bacon stays crisp.

Thanks for this!

It was quick and easy, and delicious! I used pancetta instead of bacon because I know that's authentic and my grocery store carries it. I forgot to save a little pasta water and didn't have white wine, so I added a little cream to thin it out, but I did everything else the same. My kids were hesitant to try it and ended up loving it.

Add pasta water into egg mixture before adding. Stir continuously while adding. Some fresh thyme goes nicely with this.

I made some changes to this recipe. First, I didn't have pancetta so I used two slices of bacon. I don't like an overt bacon flavor masking the flavor of everything else so this worked quite well. I also used 4 eggs plus an extra yolk and dumped out some of the egg white, then mixed in 3/4 cup parmesan, chili powder and black pepper. When I was mixing in the spaghetti I used 1/2 cup reserved pasta water, this way making the sauce creamier but preventing the strands from sticking together especially since this recipe itself is oil heavy. I also didn't have white wine and used a Corona extra instead. It turned out pretty  amazing.

Hi ,I  made this last night.  Followed the instructions to a tee!
Mine was dry, flavor was awesome, but dry.
Tonight I will add some 1/2 and 1/2 with eggs and cheese to make a roux, add it to the leftovers to add a little moisture!
Great flavor

I really enjoyed the base recipe. After making it once however, I added more bacon as I felt the amount of pasta overwhelmed the flavor of the bacon. I also had a few Cajun style andouille sausages leftover that I sliced up into the pasta for lunch. It gave it a great extra kick!

Made it as the recipe shows. I would  probably cut down to half an onion next time, or use a medium size one. I followed other reviews and mixed the egg and cheese first. It turned out really well. Will make again!

This was pretty good as written, but I was expecting more of a sauce to toss in the pasta. I started looking around at other carbonara recipes which all have heavy cream. I think that the addition of the heavy cream and peas would've made this a 5 star recipe. It was still very good, but not a proper carbonara.

We very much enjoyed this recipe!  I made it for my wife and me as a trial run and we've decided we're going to serve it at our next "brinner" (breakfast food at dinner) event.  Well...the rule is that the entrée must have eggs in it.  My wife prefers bacon, but I like it with pancetta, which I believe is the true Italian recipe.

This is now my 12 year old somewhat  picky daughter's favorite recipe! She had a second helping. I made some modifications to the recipe used gluten free pasta and I was out of olive oil so I substituted a tablespoon of organic butter. I also used half the eggs the recipe calls for because I wasn't sure my daughter would like so many. The result was delicious. Will definitely make this again!

It was actually very tasty; however, I did alter the receipt a bit.  I actually used 1-pound of diced bacon, five eggs, 1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese, and a  liberal amount of extra virgin olive oil.  It was simply delicious.  I neither add salt nor pepper when cooking because everyone has their own preference which may be added upon serving.  I also mixed the bacon, spaghetti, cheese, sauteed onion/garlic, and egg in a very large mixing bowel prior to placing the mixture back into the large sauce pan for the final stage.  Although I did serve it with just the finely grated Parmesan atop, I do believe that a light Parmesan sauce would be a great compliment for the same.

This is a very simple and fantastically recipe. Getting the eggs to cover properly takes some focus but just make sure to take the dish off the heat for a tick or 2 before mixing and then put it back on the heat to firm it up. Otherwise you will end up with scrambled egg in the bottom. We will certainly cook this again.

Really really good. I think I used less bacon dripping grease. Sautéed chopped bacon, removed, poured off most of the grease. Sauteed 1 small onion on low then added 1 large garlic clove crushed. Added about 1/4 cup white wine to deglaze, cooked down about 5 minutes.  Before pulling the pasta, used about 3/4 cup pasta water to temper the eggs.  To the pan, Added the pasta and a glug of evoo.  Added back in the bacon. On low-med heat, add egg water mix and stir constantly until thickened. Remove from the heat and keep stirring to keep from curdling. Add frozen peas at this point.

good and simple.  we made as-is w/the wine or beer.  added some tomato for color; and parsley at the end for freshness.  I shot the pasta in some cold water after boiling to prevent stickiness before adding back to the pan.

I made a few changes per how I remember carbonara. Pancetta, peas and don't throw away that delicious pasta water! I used pancetta instead of bacon. Pancetta is less greasy but just as tasty as bacon with a stronger pork flavor than bacon. I also added peas because the crunch is a nice offset to all the "soft" textures going on in this dish. Before putting the pasta in with the pancetta, onions, etc I added about 1/4 cup or so of the pasta water I saved from straining. I have no idea why but this makes pasta dishes taste better (in my humble experience). Further, I used "semi fresh" pasta instead of hard - I think buitoni or one of those brands makes some. But fresher is always better in every dish. If you can make real home made pasta, I have a deep respect for you as a culinary chemist!

So yummy!!!!! I halved the pasta (and used angel hair instead), eyeballed the bacon (we love bacon), and added about 1.5 cups of peas. Will make every time!

This is a really great recipe, and the only reason I gave I have to say is make sure you are using large eggs because I needed to add a bit of cream to the egg mixture as my eggs were not quite enough to make a sauce if you know what I mean.  I also should mention I used fresh grated parmesan and mizithra cheese in my  egg sauce. Over all very tasty and authentic. :) I finished this dish with lots of pepper, a sprinkle of extra parmesan,  a wedge of lemon on top and a ring of peas around the pile of pasta. It was really pretty and my hubby was  impressed enough to not mention that I should have added parsley to the dish.  Haha, I knew I forgot to add something.

Made it with bowtie pasta. Very nice, flavourful meal when you don't want a cream or tomato based pasta sauce.  Easy to make. Used good bacon for added texture and flavour.

I agree with most other reviews in which the pasta ratio is overwhelming. I also found it missing a lot of flavor and I think it's because I used bacon instead of pancetta. My husband and I thought it was too dry. I may try to make this one again but will definitely be reducing the amount of pasta and adding more bacon (or better yet pancetta) and more cheese.

Delicious!! Both of us loved it. Made as written, except I followed some reviewers' advice and mixed the parmesan and egg before adding it to the pasta.

Loved this recipe. Super simple and quick to prepare. I didn't have white wine so I substituted 2 tbsp white wine vinegar and 2 tbsp water. Worked a charm! I mixed my eggs with my parm. before adding to the noodles and that worked well too. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Made this tonight for the first time, following the suggestions to add the parmesan to the eggs , then add to noodles off heat.  Texture was great, smooth and silky (though I did only use maybe 3/4 pound of spaghetti), but flavor was bland, despite upping the garlic.  Not bad at all, but bland.  Definitely worth trying again with more herbs/spices or some other adjustment.

I used 3/4 amount pasta but I think I could go for even less, or perhaps more bacon/onion.  As is it was very good, though.  My husband is a terrible complimenter but his words were, "If I ordered this at a restaurant, I wouldn't be mad."  Some of the reviews were saying not to worry about the hot pasta and time it to mix in the eggs quickly - yeah, no.  I started seeing chunks of egg so I pulled off heat completely.  So do be careful about the temp of your spaghetti.  If you can, buy pre-diced bacon because that was my biggest annoyance in prep time.

I have made this at least a dozen times over the last couple years. We love it--so much, in fact, that we were eating it when we got engaged (ok, the two may be slightly unrelated but I'm not so certain he'd have asked if I didn't make this for him so often).

I made it as written the first few times before exploring other suggestions from fellow reviewers. Remember we all have our own preferences so this is in no way meant to disparage the existing, delicious recipe--but my favorite modifications are as follows:

1. White wine is NOT optional.
2. Add about 1/3 c (I eyeball it) heavy cream to egg mixture.
3. Add about 1/2 t of nutmeg to egg mixture.
4. Use fresh pasta.
5. Remove pasta from heat, mix with onion/bacon mixture, and immediately add egg mixture. Toss constantly--you do not want the eggs to cook.

Sometimes I'll add extra bacon, and the best kind I've found is pepper bacon. Yum!!

Very good as is but I prefer with 3/4 c heavy cream, and only use egg yolks.  I also added chicken, mushrooms and peas, might add zucchini next time.

It will be my  Carbonara recipe  from now on. I used whole grain spaghetti which comes less than a lb. That was sufficient.  My husband requested more bacon. I told him that would make it bacon spaghetti. I did mix the parmesan with the eggs and added them together.

Thanks to  a member s advice this recipe turned out great, adding the cheese and eggs together really made a difference  it was so creamy,  and waiting for the noodles to cool is the key to keeping  the eggs from cooking to fast and making this recipe perfect!

Added more parm cheese as others suggested. It needed red pepper flakes or some spice. It was good, but probably won't make again. Kids wouldn't try it.

This was excellent!  The only thing I changed was to leave out the onion.  I made stuffed pork chops with this and had a couple friends over, one of whom is a sous chef.  Everyone cleaned their plates and raved about how good everything was!  Will definitely make this again.

Excellent Classic Carbonara .
Restaurant quality and fairly easy.  Followed the directions and definitely included the wine.  I just read the tip about combining the cheese and egg before pouring it on pasta and will do that next time.
I hate when people give 5 stars but then suggest changes but here I go:
1/2 pound (8oz) spaghetti, not 1 pound.

Optional Add:
2 cups of green peas,
1/2 cup heavy cream.
Substitute leftover ham, instead of the bacon.

I love this recipe and have made it twice more since my first attempt. It was a big hit for my family, especially my mother (who's quite critical of my cooking). I did make some adjustments; substituted bacon for pancetta, added Romano cheese, and cooked the fresh parsley in with the sauce instead of just garnishing with it. This is now a staple in our dinner rotation.

This was a great recipe. I remember making pasta carbonara when I was a little girl but hadn't made it in years so I couldn't remember the recipe very well but this was exactly what I was looking for! Only alterations I made were adding crushed red pepper flakes to the oil before adding the onions (I saw Rachel Ray do it once lol) and adding a handful of grape tomatoes at the same time I added the garlic, right before adding that white wine. I also took other reviewers' tip and added the Parmesan to my beaten eggs. Came out perfect. Will definitely make this again. Thanks so much for sharing :-)

This was very good! Only thing I changed was I used less pasta...about 12 ounces and more Parmesan. (About a cup and a half.) I also added the Parmesan to the egg mixture and poured that into the pan. (My Italian friend said that's how ya do it! You can also omit the salt. Bacon is already very salty. Ill be adding this to my dinner rotation.

I've made Italian Carbonara from a dozen or more different recipes over the past 30 years and this is the best. My biggest fear is to over cook and have "scrambled eggs" in our pasta. This was creamy and wonderful. I cooked as directed, but added more cheese. Enjoy!

This was delicious!  I halved the recipe, but used the full amount of parmesan and only 1 egg.  Very tasty, easy and filling.

Very delicious. I know this isn't an authentic carbonara recipe, but this is so good. I used bucatini noodles and added some red chili flakes, because we like spicy. I added the Parmesan to the eggs, as that's how an authentic recipe usually is. And, I tempered the eggs with pasta water before adding it to the pasta mixture. Adding this to my favorite recipes.

Great base recipe with many wonderful tips in other reviews.

I particularly like using parmesan & parmigiano-reggiano both mixed in with beaten eggs for smoother texture.

My kids totally love this so I add in small cut chicken pieces for added protein.

Made it exactly as written with no regrets. It's very heavy, probably better for colder months. I made it in August and did absolutely nothing for the rest on the day. Will definitely make it again.

Big hit for dinner tonight!  A few changes based on reading other reviews and what I had on hand.  I made 1.5 time the sauce (egg, cheese, garlic, onion, wine) since many said it was dry and followed a reviewer suggestion to mix the cheese into the egg and add all at once.  Also, I didn't have any bacon, but had a 12 oz packed of hormel diced ham.  Subbed that and about a tablespoon of butter to make up for the bacon grease.  Turned out excellent!

This recipe was great! The only changes I made was I only used 3/4 a pound of pasta. The full pound was just too much for the sauce. I also added some frozen peas and carrots.
Could be a bit creamier so next time I might try some of the other recommendations.

Followed it almost exactly but did combine the parmesan and eggs before adding as suggested. Also doubled bacon. Bacon! Yum. I did add the wine (pinot gris) and that was good, so good. I had to made three varieties, one with gluten free noodles and no onions for my food sensitive daughter (green onions sprinkled on top for her), one without bacon (added sauteed mushrooms in butter) for the vegetarian friend and the rest of us had it with fresh pappradelle noodles. If I had eaten as much as I wanted I'd have exploded. Great recipe and easy. Thank you for sharing this.

I made this recipe as is, and thought it was really nice! I'm used to a creamier pasta, but this is likely more traditional, and the balance of flavors was really good.

I made this tonight for myself and my oldest son, it's something I've always wanted to try and I found this recipe to be both a good base for my families tastes, and fairly straight forward. I adjusted the recipe for 3 servings, as my son and I are large eaters. I followed the recipe, but took others advice and my own tastes into account. Added Lemon Juice, Mrs Dash, and pasta water, and only used egg yolks to the sauce, but otherwise followed as written and it was amazing. I was afraid my other kids and wife wouldn't like the dish because of the egg yolks which they dislike, but boy was I wrong! My other kids( Age 3 and 9) tried it and wanted some themselves. Everyone wanted some, so I had to make it again lol. This recipe is most assuredly a keeper and thank you to the Author!

This is a great, simple and easy carbonara! I didn't have an onion so I added a couple spring onions at the end. And used some pasta cooking water instead of the wine to help emulsify the sauce. I cut the recipe in half, but had to use close to a 1/2 cup of pasta water to bring the sauce together. So my only recommendation is to keep some pasta cooking water on hand when making this.

This was a good dish.  Not exactly like the carbonara I have grown to love, but a good dish nonetheless.  Next time I'll try more eggs, but just the yolk, and pancetta instead of bacon.

This, like all recipes, should be used with your own cooking experience in mind.  I used bacon which I simmered in water first before crisping in the pan. This rendered the excess fat out of the bacon yet left the bacon nice and crispy without excessive fat.  
I also added frozen peas, onions, and garlic and added both the eggs and about 1/3 cup of cream to the just cooked pasta.  I also drizzled perhaps 3 tablespoons of olive oil over the pasta.  Once everything was well-mixed, I added the grated cheese and tossed all with tongs.  For ease, I use a stainless steel mixing bowl on top of the pasta pot that has the hot pasta water still in it. It acts as a double boiler and allows easy mixing of all the ingredients without sticking. It is also the best method of reheating the dish.
Eliminate the bacon or pork and substitute shrimp and crab or mussels and it becomes another great recipe...well worth trying.

Delish! I followed the recipe but used turkey bacon instead of regular because it's what I had on hand. I was worried about raw eggs, but tossing it on the hot pan cooked everything perfectly. I topped the pasta with some ground pepper but that's it as the bacon and cheese made the dish salty enough. Would definitely make again.

When I added the egg it when down hill. It instantly went dry. I added pasta water thinking that would help but it didn't. It tasted like bacon grease mush. Will not make again.

Amazing! Used 12 oz of bacon with 6 oz of pasta (halved the rest of the recipe, as well). Added just a bit of 2% milk. Meant to add spinach, but forgot. Do this next time!

Nice! I didn't expect it to taste like this.I took the others suggestions with nutmeg and cream and part bacon part Italian sausage. I also used parm and Pecorino Romano. It's missing a little something though just have to figure out what that is.

Made this with the tip of 'Mystoniques' review and wow! it was delicious. definitely a keeper for the recipe book. Also instead of using whole eggs, I used 4 yolks + 1 white and only 1/2 an onion.

I think that for a pound of pasta, the whole package of bacon can be used. I did not findthat this lacked flavor. I added in some spinach after the egg and that helped a little bit and added addition nutrition. I would also suggest salting the eggs when beaten with maybe a tsp of salt to incorporate flavor and adding some parmesan cheese into the egg mixture.

This was excellent. I haven't made a carbonara before and I was a bit skeptical adding the egg at the end and just let the residual heat to cook it.But everything worked out fine in the end. Just add the parmesan to the egg mixture so you'll have the "creamy" sauce without having to add heavy cream.

My family enjoyed this for Christmas Eve lunch. I added peas and mushrooms to make it a little heartier. I also cooked some pancetta with the bacon. Because I added the mushrooms and peas, I need to add a little more salt. Yum!

The recipe is easy to follow.
Yummy.
I used ham instead of bacon and no salt or wine. 
I also added some cream and less oil.
Next time I want to add peas.

Pretty good and easy to make! Used leftover holiday ham, sliced thin and salted a little extra. Cooked that with two slices of bacon. Did everything else as directed. Delicious!

This is my husbands favorite meal. I used pancetta and about 3/4 of a pound. Does not need salt or pepper. And I used the wine. Gives it more flavor.

I've made this about 20 times and its a great recipe that you can customize to particular tastes.  If its just my husband and I I'll add 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes. If my daughters are around for dinner I omit them and have occasionally added some frozen peas. White wine doesnt make that much of a difference flavor wise but its always fun to have the rest of the bottle to drink with dinner!

I must have done something wrong, because it didn't turn out "creamy" like others said theirs did. It turned out dry. I ended up adding two or three times more olive oil, and I even used more bacon grease than the recipe called for, but that didn't help. I will make it again, but I will follow some of the tips from the reviewers to see if it turns out better. I expected more flavor.

Recipe is a good base recipe.  I made the following modifications:
1. Used two eggs and two egg yolks and 1/4 cup of cream
2. 3/4 cup of parmesan mixed in egg mixture.
3.  Nutmeg added to egg mixture.
4. Added crushed red pepper to onions and browned the onions  a bit.

Really easy and yummy.  I didn't have any wine, so I left it out.  The first time I made this I wasn't a fan because my eggs seemed to cook too much.  The second time turned out great, making the dish very creamy.  It did seem a little bland so next time I think I will add some lemon juice and a little basil as suggested by another reviewer.

This recipe is so easy to make and spot on, portion wise. I did combine the parmesan with the eggs and also warmed up the eggs in lukewarm water before whisking together and pouring over the spaghetti. My husband loved it and it is now part of my menu! Thank you for a great recipe.

B+ recipe.  I didn't use the wine because I was making it for the family.  It was a little dry-maybe I could have added more olive oil but I like to keep it on the healthier side.

Only four stars as is because there was too much pasta and the sauce was a little gluey. Personally, I'd reduce the pasta by about a third AND make sure to keep aside at least a cup (maybe cup and a half) of the cooking liquid to add. Also, juice of half a lemon really helps. Overall, though, it's a really nice base that just needed some tweaks for our personal preferences. Easy and very tasty!

Thanks for this fabulous recipe! I had some prosciutto that needed to be used up and, although I may never make it using this again, it was lovely.
I also added some leftover ricotta cheese to the eggs and a tablespoon of pesto (made with 1/4 parsley)instead of the fresh parsley. What started out as a good way to use up ingredients ended up being a gourmet meal.

This was a sensational recipe- it tasted better than the spaghetti carbonara I've ordered from italian restaurants. I followed some of the reviewers' suggestions by adding the beaten egg when the pasta has cooled slightly (pan no longer on the fire) so that the eggs dont cook. Will cook again soon

This was very good.  Full of flavor and easy to make.  I used low carb pasta to cut back on the carbs and no one could tell the difference.  Especially nice since my 19 year old daughter won't eat beef or sausage and I'm always looking for recipes the whole family will like.

I too, mixed my eggs with the parmesan cheese and added some fresh cracked pepper and pinches of sea salt, nutmeg, and basil. I'd run out of parmesan, so I also tossed in another 1/4 c of an Italian 5-cheese blend, which included smoked provolone. If it weren't for the smoky taste the cheese provided, I would've rated this dish much lower since I found the final outcome rather bland. My husband, who is the true pasta fanatic in the house, LOVED this, hence the compromised 4-star rating. I was a little nervous tossing raw eggs over the pasta since I was also serving this to my 4 year-old, so I set the entire pan back over low heat as I was tossing the pasta, so I wouldn't scramble the eggs. I added in some steamed green peas to my plate (hubby hates peas) and used turkey bacon. Not a keeper in my book, but I'd make it again if the hubby requests it.

This recipe is great and never gets old.   I have made it quite a few times now with only minor modifications.  Actually, I haven’t really modified it at all, just changed a technique. I used thick cut bacon then I just cut most of the fat of the bacon away.  I cook the bacon fat until I have a decent amount of grease in the pan, remove the fat and feed it to the dog, then I cook the bacon meat in the bacon grease.  This method requires 2-3 additional pieces of bacon.  I just don't really like bacon fat, so that is why I do this.  I recommend this recipe to everyone, it is that good.

The first time I made this recipe I found the parmasean a little overpowering. Tonight when I made it I adjusted it to 1/3 of a cup and didn't add any extra when serving it...this was sooooo good, a great recipe that will be a regular in my rotation!

This was really just ok for us. There was just the two of us so I only used a 1/2 pound of spaghetti and used half an onion. I also followed other reviews and mixed the cheese in with the eggs before adding it to the pasta. I added 2 more cloves of garlic and some Italian seasoning. It really felt like it was missing something. I don't plan on keeping this in my regular rotation.

Excellent! I was able to prepare this wonderful meal in 1 hour (I washed the dishes too, so maybe 40min). I'd be happy to pay $20+ to have this in a restaurant.

PS: I used 1/3 box of spaghetti (any more and it'd lose it's creaminess). For flavoring I used suggested wine, added about a 1/2 tablespoon sugar in with the onions and used fresh cracked pepper and a dash of salt at the end. Also, you don't need parsley and I used 2 cloves or garlic instead of 1.

aaaaaaaabsolutely delicious. I added a bit more bacon (because everything is better with more bacon) and didn't add any salt. Makes a delicious lunch at work the next day too.

A fantastic recipe! Thanks for sharing. I had some prawns on hand and I fried them up with a bit of the bacon drippings (wow, they were good!)
Tip - turn your pan off for a couple mintues before adding the eggs. You don't want the eggs to solidify, just barely cook with the residual heat. YUM!

I made this with no onion, garlic, or parsley and it was still one of the best things I've ever made.  I used pasta water instead of wine (don't put on eggs or they will cook).  It was quick, simple and restaurant quality.  I used leftover bacon, and warmed it up with the oil and bacon fat to freshen it up.  For pasta, I used linguine (flat, but not as wide as fettucini) and it picked up the sauce really well.  A real winner!

I have cooked this 5 times since I first tried this recipe a few weeks ago. So simple to make and really delicious. This is one of those recipes that matches restaurant quality food with an authentic Italian taste. And, to the recipe writer - thanks for such clear directions and tips. Cheers!

I didn't use the dry white wine....and this was the first time I'd attempted carbonara...and I'd venture to say that this rivals that of any restaurant!  This was delish!  Thank you for sharing!

I tried this recipe because there were so much good reviews but after eating it I just felt really grossed out because of the raw eggs. Don't get me wrong I know it cooks off with the heat from the pasta but I'm just going to stick with marinara and Alfredo sauce for now.

Fabulous!  I used proscuitto instead of bacon, but wish I had used pancetta.

I threw in oil/onions/garlic and meat into a wok together (should have slightly broiled proscuitto first) and the tiniest bit of salt and pepper.  Because of the salty proscuitto and parmesean I probably could have gone without the salt.

Followed one user's advice and pre beat the eggs then combined with the cheese before adding to the pasta.

Next time I would like to add some fresh basil and sweet peas.

SOOOOO VERY GOOD! My husband hates eggs but loved this dish as the eggs and cheese create the creamy sauce and not "eggy" at all!

This was good. I had all the ingredients on hand except for the bacon and I had some spicy garlic keilbosa to use up so I diced it up and used that instead. It obviously produced a sightly different taste than the bacon but it was really delicious. I served it with a salad made from tomatoes, red onion, basil and feta and it turned out to be a great combination.

This was dry (like they said it might) so I added milk as an impromptu solution and it worked. SO GOOD. Next time I'm going to try some lemon zest to make it more summer-feeling. BTW, the kids scarfed it.

I used a cast iron skillet, it scrambled my eggs. I think the pan was too hot! It was very dry, but I think it was my fault. It was still very good, but next time I will use a non-stick skillet.

The first time I made it, I followed it to a T....AMAZING.  Yesterday I made it again, but this time I sauteed a chicken breast in the same pan that the bacon was cooked in and I added 2 small chicken boulions.....HELLO OMG.  Thank You for sharing.

This is a very good recipe with excellent ideas for this classic dish.  If you take the advice of commentators and double the bacon and add 3/4 cup of cream, be aware calories per serving increase from 450 calories to 750.  And that is if you only eat 1/8 of the recipe- hard for me to do when it tastes so good!!

This was pretty good, next time I will use margarine instead of olive oil. To make this healthier I used whole wheat spaghetti and turkey bacon, but I think it would have been better with bacon.

Wow.  I was amazed at how easy and quick this was to make.  And delicious too.  We used linguine and added a little fat-free half and half after mixing in the eggs.  Granted, not something you'd want to have every night because of the fat, etc., but very good.

Might eat every day for the rest of my life, lol.  I added baby bella's and frozen peas (love them).  Also mixed 1/4 cup heavy cream, eggs and parm together before pouring over pasta.  I pour over pasta last and after removed from heat

Delicious!  I didn't have bacon, so I cubed Polish sausage and fried that, and while that drained on a paper towel, I cooked the onions and then the garlic.  I followed the suggestion to put the Parmesan and egg together before pouring it over the hot pasta, and it worked like a charm.

Delicious yet basic style of spaghetti carbonara. As others suggested, mixing the cheese (which I change to 1 cup of Reggiano) in with the beaten eggs on very low heat is crucial. I prefer mine with mushrooms, peas, 1/2 cup of cream (no need for much more since it's rich enough), nutmeg, and a good amount of italian seasoning. I was even thinkin about adding celery or green onions.. there's just so much room for experimentation!

This was a different, though good, recipe.  I used 12 oz. of bacon and tripled the garlic.  As suggested, I decreased the pasta by a few ounces.  I think I may add Alfredo sauce and some diced sausage to the leftovers.

Surprisingly good!  I first saw this served in France and thought people had lost their minds when I saw a raw egg sitting on top the pasta.  My husband loves this dish, so I made it for him one night.  Much to my surprise, I loved it as well!  Lesson learned in keeping an open mind!

This dish was great!  My Italian husband is a little picky, but this dish was very good.  I added some pulled apart rotisserie chicken as well which just added to the flavor.  This dish is quite rich, so remember, a little really goes a long way!  Thanks for the yummy weeknight meal.

This is fantastic. While I did add a couple of extra ingredients, I am rating this on the basis of the original recipe. I hate reading someone rate a recipe, but change many of the ingredients. Definitely a keeper.

I had high hopes for this recipe but I found it lacking in flavor.  There wasn't enough bacon flavor and the bacon fat left an unpleasant film in my mouth.

Tasted like onion noodles. I took the suggestion of cutting the amt pasta down (from 1 pound to 3/4 pound). You def do not want to have a pound...not enough sauce. Giving it a generous 3 stars on the chance it was ME who botched it. I won't be making this again though.

Wow!  This was so tasty.  The only thing I omitted was the white wine, because I used the last of it yesterday evening.  Next time I'll try with pancetta as the other reviewers suggest, because we have a great deli nearby.  I'd be interested in finding a way to make this a little less of a calorie bomb, but there's honestly no sense in modifying it if it would compromise the flavor.  As the no-longer-cookie monster would say, "A sometimes-food."

Not that great. Followed the recipe exactly. Needs more bacon and lots of salt and pepper.

Used 1 pound of bacon put onion directly in. Never took bacon out added 2 cloves of garlic and 1/4 cup white wine. Put about 1.5 cups parm in the eggs took sauce off of heat cooled 1 minuted and then stirred in egg mix.  So creamy so good.

I loved it. I added  1 1/2 cups of 35% cooking cream with 1/2C of white wine.It made  a world of difference. I also mixed only 2 eggs with  the sauce and used 10 slices if bacon just because I like bacon.I will definetely make this again.

I have made carbonara before but it turned out really rich and wasn't so good. This recipe was great! I added nutmeg to my dish and used turkey bacon instead of regular bacon. (It's less oily than regular bacon)

Hubby says 5, I say 4.5, because I felt like it was missing a little something. Hubby said missing something probably because I used the pre-cooked bacon so didn't have much bacon grease. Close to restaraunt flavor though. I did mix the cheese in with the eggs, and when I mixed it in, I had it on the medium-low heat and constantly stirred for 5-6 minutes, and did not have any egg pieces in it. Also did a little shake of nutmeg. Overall, very filling, think the cream may be too much for me. This is a keeper and will plan to serve to company in the future.

surprisingly good! i had never even eaten this dish before, but will be making it again. i added peas for color (and to sneak a little more veggies into my family's diet.) and didn't have any white wine on hand. tasty!

The only adaption that I made to the recipe was using whole wheat pasta.  Dry, and way to grainy with the whole wheat pasta.

Truly to die for.  Per the most highly recommended review, I beat the eggs, mixed them with parm-reg (3-4 times the amount called for in the recipe) and then mixed it with the still-hot-but-not steaming pasta.  I then tossed everything else in.  I omitted salt and forgot pepper, and it was still extremely flavorful.

Pretty good and quick!  Didn't have bacon.  Less angel hair.  More EVOO.  Italian seasoning mixed in w/ eggs and parm.  Add this at the end, after the onions/evoo/garlic.  Don't cook.

I have to retry this one.  I burned the bacon.  I did mix the cheese with the eggs before pouring on the noodles.  I wanted to add peas, but realized I didn't have any.  I added green beans instead.  Oh well.  I will attempt again.  Perhaps I will be able to upgrade the stars after I taste it appropriately made.  We still all liked it tho!

I loved loved LOVED this recipe! I searched for a while to look for authentic carbonara recipes and the only difference between this and others was the use of proscuitto instead of bacon.  However, I used this particular recipe because I knew bacon would go over better in my house.  My boyfriend was a little skeptical of this dish while he watched me prepare it (the whole raw-egg thing) but when I served it he absolutely loved it! I loved it as well.  I will definitely make this again! I followed the recipe exactly but didn't use the white wine because I had none.

I made this with Proscuitto!  Also added fresh black olives, and mushrooms!!  I didnt have any white wine, but the sauce still came out wonderfully!  This was an easy recipe with leeway to play with ingredients!  The proscuitto was great and less fattening too!!

I used the top 2 most helpful tips from 2007 and 2002.  The sausage and nutmeg and extra fresh parmesan are a must.  Pancetta also was a great change from bacon.  The heavy cream was a delicious addition.  The key is to serve immediately.

I did not care for this.  It was a somewhat dry and sticky and had little nuance to the flavor - the onion was overpowering.  I like the idea of Carbonara, but will be looking for another recipe.

At first my kids were looking at it weird, and then they tried it!  They loved it and so did my hubby!  I did use a whole package of bacon in mine.  This has become on of recipes that is in our monthly menu.  I love it because I always have these ingredients in the pantry.  Excellent!

Soooo good! I use more bacon and less onion. I also mix the cheese and eggs before adding to pasta as suggested by another reviewer.  I have made it with both the wine and without and, they both taste good.  A guaranteed winner if friends are coming over!

Tasty! My four children and husband liked it and I liked it because it was easy to make! I added diced tomatoes and that was good and gave the dish some color. The ingredients in this recipe are ones that are usually on hand. I will be making this again.

In spite of my pan being too hot, and ending up with a few "scrambles," it was delicious.  This is absolutely going into the regular meal cycle.  I added a bit of nutmeg and topped with some chopped, fresh sage that I had on hand.

This was incredibly delicious.  I didn't change a thing.  I used reisling for the wine and I definitely think that it is a 'must' step instead of optional to use the wine, it just gives it that extra depth of flavor. It fairly easy as well so it will definitely be going in the make again pile.

YUMMY!  I didn't do the egg like it said.  I added it after I cooked the garlic and I didn't add salt.  It was really good.

My boys absolutely love this!  I thought it was a little on the dry side, so maybe next time I will double the wet ingredients.  Good recipe!

Quite nice; we liked it alot; my daughter thought it was ok; my stepson ate barely half; if that, of his.  Did add a bit more garlic; as well as some mushrooms; some capsicum (bell peppers for those in America); and some spinach;  and omitted the wine (as we don't drink any at all; didn't see the point of getting some jus to use a little bit of the bottle; as the rest would have been wasted) - I do realize all of this would have changed the flavour a bit; but we liked it as we'd had it.  Great base recipe; though!

Sorry, this was just okay. I didn't think it had a lot of flavor.  The eggs didn't seem like they did much to the dish either.  Not sure what else it needed.  I don't think I would make it again.

The flavor was good, but the eggs just coated the pasta and I didn't feel like we got a lot of the flavor from them.  That may be how its meant to be, but next time we'll scramble the eggs in a separate pan and mix them in.

I made this recipe, and my husband, who is very picky, really liked it. To lighten it up I used egg whites and I added chicken and used less bacon and omitted the olive oil. I didn't have any parsley in the house so I used Italian seasoning and it came out great!! Thanks!!!

I didnt have olive oil so I used normal oil. The cream at the end is a VERY good idea.  A very good receipe (I overcooked the pasta) but I will def make it again.

Really great!  I used 1 and 1/2 times the bacon called for and 3/4 cup of heavy cream based on other user reviews.  I also followed the advice of others and mixed the parm and eggs before pouring on the pasta.  I was nervous about my ability to pull this off, but it worked out wonderfully.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I've made this recipe over a dozen times now.  Will be serving it along with Pesto Torta (layered spread) and Italian Cookies II all from this site to my bunco group later this week.  The only thing I do different is include an entire package of bacon and I use heavy cream to give it that extra creaminess.

modified following another reviewer's advice. Wow...was this good! Here are the changes I made:  cooked the bacon, added onions, then the garlic; mixed the eggs with the parmesan cheese; drained the spaghetti and added it to a large bowl, then added the bacon/onion/garlic mixture (be sure to scrape in the drippings, then toss), finally added the egg mixture and tossed well. Served with parmesan on top. This is definitely a new favorite.

Great, and done pretty quickly if you cook the "sauce" ingredients while your boiling the water and pasta. I took the advice of adding the egg to the parm first, then pouring over slightly cooled noodles... awsome! We did add some mushrooms and spinach and next time I'll probably add a little diced tomato to up the veggies but that's just personal taste. This recipe rocks!

I originally had 3 stars for this recipe, but after much determination in figuring out how to make this perfectly, I just had to give it a 5 star! If I created it word for word, it turned out too dry, and adding oil just made it too oily. What I did to make it perfect was beaten the eggs in a bowl, then mix in the cheese with the raw egg before adding to the noodles. For some odd reason, this made the dish perfect! Sometimes I add peas, broccoli or spinach, depending on what I got on hand to add some green. Delicious!

Delicious!  I only used 8 oz. of spaghetti because I knew a pound would be way too much for my family, so I used only 2 eggs but kept the rest of the recipe the same. Will definitely make again!

Excellent recipe! I usually time the spaghetti noodles to finish cooking right when I'm done putting together the rest of the ingredients. The noodles still have to be warm when you mix it with the sauce. Instead of using olive oil to loosen the noodles, I used some of the reserved bacon fat. Oh my! I occassionally add a little heavy cream when I want a heartier meal.

This was really good and a great quick dinner.  I did use pancetta instead of the bacon and a little more garlic.  This will be one of my go to recipes when I need to get dinner n the table fast.  Thanks!

This was very tasty and I had no leftovers between the four of us! The next time I will double the amount of bacon and garlic just because of a personal preference for more of those items. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This is what's for dinner tomorrow ;) This is sooooo good; perfect! Deliciously creamy. Flavorful. Easy. I listened to a reviewer and combined the eggs and the parmesan cheeses together then tossed them in the pasta and it turned out wonderful...other than that followed the recipe verbatim. Awesome!

I was so scared to make this. I had never even heard of spaghetti carbonara but it sounded way too fancy for me to handle! =) I made this for my husband, brother and mother in law and everyone RAVED what an amazing cook I have become!! I followed the recipe exactly- and I think its the fresh ingredients that really deserve the credit. Freshly grated parmesan, minced garlic, fresh italian parsley, some dry white wine... what's not to love? Plus this was SO incredibly quick to make. Loved it, love it!!!

This has become one of our favorite fast meals.  The only variation I have done from the original recipe is use twice the amount of bacon and I mixed the parmesan cheese in with the egg before adding it to the noodles.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

This was so good.  I followed the advice of one reviewer who suggested putting the pasta into a bowl and then add the eggs and cheese off the heat.  This was much easier than I thought it was going to be.

This was good. I didn't have white wine, so that was my only change. I don't think we were blown away by the recipe, but it was good. I did really like that I had all the ingredients on hand to make the dish.

This was probably one of the best recipes I have found on this site yet. My family actually eats it! Not only that but they want seconds, and with as picky as they are that's a winner to me. Also i loved that it made so much, I am notorious for being the person who always cooks too much for dinner but in this case there are never leftovers. there was enough to feed my family of 3, plus 2 guests twice! This is deffinatly a great recipe.

Pretty good, I think the pancetta makes a big difference though, the bacon was not as good.

It was good, but this was the first time I've made Carbonara.  I don't like the texture added by the egg.  I think it would taste a lot better if the egg were omitted.  Also, be sure to add the pepper.  I could tell something was missing after my first bite.

This recipe was awesome!  I'm not a big fan of pasta with your standard marinara sauce, this was a breath of fresh air.  I think if you're going to use a pound of spaghetti you may want to use a little more bacon, eggs, cheese, and olive oil to cover all the pasta.  Thanks for the great recipe :)

It was a little dry when I made it, and make sure you use a large pot and skillet when doing this, it gets a lot of stuff in.  It would be a really good idea to add the white wine, but may be even better with a little cream.

Mmm Yummy! Loved this one! Cheated a little and used pre-cooked/chopped bacon (from Costco). Also mixed the parmesan and egg together before adding to the pasta and it was VERY creamy. What a great brunch food this would be!

We've tried a few different Carbonara's and this one was very simple and nice.  It wasn't too heavy feeling, but still flavorful.  We did think it could use a bit more bacon.

I made this for my family and we all agreed that it was "ok", but, a little bland.  I did omit the white wine, but, followed the rest of the recipe as instructed.  If I made this again, I would add more garlic and bacon.

A nice recipe, but it's true - you do need to work quickly.  Next time I will take the advice of a poster who suggested mixing the parm and eggs together and waiting until the pasta has cooled slightly.  The few times I've made this recipe, it's been touch and go for the right timing.  I will try the modification, but overall - a great recipe.

This was so good and so easy.  As others had suggested, I mixed the egg and parm together before tossing in the noodles, I also added some cream, too die for.  So rich and creamy, my whole family loved, and it was even better warmed up the next day.

eh.....not bad, not good. This was easy to prepare but I thought for all the great smells during cooking it would have tasted better. I added the cream which most people suggested and I can't imagine what it would have tasted like without it. Nutmeg didn't make much differance in my mind.

I absolutely love this recipe.  I have made it about 3 times now and cant say enough good things about it. There are never any leftovers.  I did use Oscar Meyer turkey bacon and it's still fabulous.

My family loved this meal, and it was easy to prepare.  I used turkey bacon and canadian bacon to help make it lower fat.  I mixed the cheese and eggs before adding.  I used the wine and it made the difference.  Fresh herbs would help finish this dish!

I loved this, very fattening though! Def. not a "healthy" dish! I will make it slightly different next time as it lacked a little flavor. I will make 12 slices of bacon,3tbp of bacon dripping and add pepper and salt and 1c of grated cheese...

Loved this dish!  Easy to prepare & kid friendly.  I made a few changes to the recipe.  Used a half pound of pasta (instead of 1 lb), turkey bacon vs. real bacon, used 5 eggs, & added about a Tbsp. of dried basil.

So very yummy! After I cooked the bacon, I saved the grease and added chicken breasts and cooked until they were gone in the grease. Oh my goodness the chicken was SO juicy and tender!!! I cut the chicken up in cubes and tossed into the pan with the pasta. Adding the eggs was a weird process, but it still tasted very good. Thanks for sharing! :)

Very tasty. For those who are lactose intollerant use egg substitute and let others add cheese at the table so everyone can eat this.  Noone should miss out!

This is eggy and good!  I only kept 1 tbsp. bacon grease and didn't add any additional oil.  Did not use wine either.  Great recipe when you have absolutely nothing in the fridge for supper!

This is how to make carbonara at home!  I add red pepper flakes because we like it spicy at my house, and the flakes work well in this recipe.  I have also made it with other kinds of pasta, such as penne, depending on what we have in the cupboard.

I liked this quite a lot.  my husband wanted more meat and the kids said it had too many onions.  I thought it was good.  I added a bit of half and half with the Parmesan to make it a bit creamier and used broth in place of wine, since i could not find my cork screw.  I will make again and add some chicken or shrimp for the hubby, and chop the onion smaller to fool the kids (i like big sweet chunks of red onion in this! yummy!)

I had never made carbonara before and this recipe was very easy to follow. Also my husband doesn't normally like pasta dishes as much as I do, but he kept going back for more. This will definitely be put into my regular recipe rotation.

I followed this recipe to the letter.  I have never had this before so I am not sure how it should exactly taste, but I am a big pasta fan. In my opinion, it was bland and missing something.  I might try again with changes.

I made per the directions and though it was good, I was expecting something with more taste.  Without the bacon there would be virtually no taste to this dish.  It seems like it needed something else, I might try the other reviewers suggestions by adding cream but I also don't want to add to much to the fat content - oh well, guess I will keep trying.

I was so excited about this recipe, and quite disappointed.  I agree other reviewers about the blandness.  I was looking for something like Olive Garden's spaghetti carbonara, and this wasn't it.  To be fair, I tweaked the recipe in the following ways: added 1/4 c. red bell pepper (which was fine tasting), and I premixed the eggs and parmesan per other reviewers.  The texture of the sauce was fine.

delicious!  I added an extra egg (but then i didn't measure my spaghetti).  Great flavour.  I think next time I will use more bacon.  Also, the parmesan makes all the difference.  Buy the good stuff not the shaker.

Yum-ola!  Made this tonight, and husband and two year-old scarfed it up, as did I.  I only made two changes: I mixed the eggs and cheese, as recommended by others on here.  And I added some thinly sliced mushrooms with the onions and garlic, as I had extra left over from another recipe.  I didn't have any problem with the eggs scrambling.  It came out perfecto!

This was tasty, but next time I'll use the wine or maybe some cream because it was too dry without.  It was nice and quick to prepare also.

This had good flavor.  I don't know what I was expecting but mine was a little dry.  My family really enjoyed it.  I prefer a creamy sauce so I will try combining the egg and cheese together the next time as recommended by the other reviews.

A good variation on spaghetti if your tired of the same old thing.  It definitely takes a bit more time to cook, but overall its good.  I would add a tad bit more cheese and seasoning as it does taste a bit bland.  But it all balances out with some good garlic bread.

From all the reviews, I thought this would be something truly outstanding.  But it turned out to be just pasta with bacon and eggs - not one of those cases where ordinary ingredients make something extraordinary.

I never had spaghetti carbonara before, so I didn't really know what to expect.  It tasted bland.  Maybe there is too much spaghetti in this recipe or maybe more bacon added would have been better.  I probably won't make it again.

I loved this recipe and couldn't stop eating it.  It makes A LOT of food so I will probably cut it in half the next time.  I did have a problem with the eggs cooking into scambled strands, but I also did not have a pan big enough to hold all of that pasta so I had problems tossing. I will try the method of cheese and eggs togther based upon another review.  But even with me messing it up, it was still really, really good.

My entire family loved this! I changed the spaghetti to linguini because the flatter noodles hold the sauce better. I also cooked the onion with the bacon. After I removed the bacon, I added extra garlic and the white wine which nicely mixed in the bits of cooked bacon on the bottom of the pan. I also doubled the amount of bacon and mixed the eggs and cheese together before mixing into the pasta. My husband loved this and both my boys (picky eaters) cleaned thier plate. I'll be making this again!

As others suggested, I put the eggs and parm cheese together before mixing with warm pasta.  It was wonderful.  I did substitute turkey bacon, which didn't give off as much fat. I didn't drain off any of the fat and just added the onions and 2 garlic cloves.  I also decreased the pasta amount so it would be more saucy!  Yum!

My hubby and I devoured this. I did not use the 2 tbsp bacon fat but probably doubled the olive oil instead. Left out the wine since we didn't have any.

Loved this!It took a little longer than I thought it would but it could have been because I kept my skillet "not-too-hot" to prevent bacon grease from flying all over the place. Hubby really liked it. "Tasty!" I used the white wine and it added just the right touch.

I thought I should have added a little more olive oil but he said no and thought it had maybe a tad too much grease. (Then again, he uses an eyedrop's worth of dressing on his salad, so what does he know?!!)

Seriously. This recipe rocks. Definitely will make again. Thanks so much for sharing. :-)

My 5 year old daughter loved this!  My  husband and I thought it was okay.  Adding the eggs was tricky, they cooked too fast.  I'm sure with more practice I would get it right, but not sure if I'll try this one again.

Spaghetti carbonara is one of my husband's favorite dishes -- I never knew it could be so quick and easy!  I combined the parm and the eggs before adding to the spaghetti, as others suggested, and that worked well.  Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't have any white wine, but this recipes was outstanding. I used zucchini sliced with my mandolin into angel hair pasta becuase I am on a special diet (Specific Carbohydrate Diet) and can't have gluten or starches. That was the only change I made and me and my friends couldn't believe how good it was. It was so simple and used ingredients I had on hand. A def keeper!!!!

Very good recipe for carbonara!  I made it exactly as the recipe called for, but I didn't have any fresh parsley.  I will probably use extra bacon and garlic next time for even more flavor, but overall, this is a great recipe!

Very nice balance of flavors. We use whole wheat pasta. I used the wine, it was a nice depth of flavor.

In Japan raw eggs are eaten all the time. We use organic and don't worry. The heat of the pasta really does cook the egss well. I also added the 3/4cup heavy cream.

Delicious! Thank yoU!

I thought this was easy and delicious and loved the fact that it used things I had on hand.  For the wine I used Riesling and subbed turkey bacon.  I would give it 5-stars, but my bf said it tasted bland.

This recipe was terrific and very easy.  I made if for my family for lunch - my pickiest three year old ate a bowl full and had seconds.  It's easy and very tasty.  The only change I made was to use a 12 oz. pkg. of vermicelli b/c that's what I had on hand.
Thanks for a great, economical recipe!

Followed the recipe exactly and it was pretty good except for the fact it was way too dry!  Maybe I'll modify it next time.

This was good! I made it with heavy cream instead of wine as another review suggested. It didnt seem to have very much flavor so I whipped up a garlic alfredo sauce with some butter, heavy cream, minced garlic ,and a little salt and pepper and poured on top ... then I loved it! I guess thats not really the way it was supposed to be but good nonetheless! thanks!

This was pretty good - I had no idea carbonara was this easy to make! The eggy texture of the pasta may take some getting used to if you've never had this before. I was worried about heating up the leftovers (I didn't want the "cooked egg" effect), but it reheated in the microwave just fine, and I think it actually tasted better the next day. Thanks for a great carbonara recipe!

very good! i used dried parsley because that's all i had, but i'm sure fresh parsley would have been better. i mixed the eggs, cheese, and some half-and-half beforehand, and i turned the heat down just a tad before i added it so the eggs wouldn't scramble.

This is a new family favorite! I didn't use white wine and I used a garlic salt with dried parsley instead of fresh garlic. Even my 4 young children ate every last bite! My husband and I couldn't get enough of the fabulous flavor and I even had some for breakfast the next morning...bacon and eggs!

This was pretty good, but not the best recipe I've ever made/tasted.  Most of the reviewers that gave it 5 stars added cream, so next time I'll add cream if I make this recipe again.

This was my first time trying spaghetti carbonara. I decided to make it because my mother kept raving about how delicious it was when my aunt made it, (I guess I'll have to get my aunt's recipe and post it). I thought it was ok, my husband liked it and my 4yr old who is a somewhat picky eater ate it as well. I won't be making it this way again. If I do make it again, I will definitely omit the eggs, use a lot more garlic, omit the wine, and use way more olive oil, as it is a very dry meal.

This was AMAZING!!!!  I kept the heat on med-high until just before I added the eggs and then I turned it down to a med-low to avoid the "scrambled egg effect."  I then tossed in ~1/2c. room temp. whole milk.  I did not need to add salt.  The only real change was adding 1 c. frozen peas to the last minute of cooking time for the pasta.

I was concerned about how much 4 eggs looked like once beaten so I cut the eggs back to 3 instead of 4.  I would say stick with the 4 for the optimal creaminess.  I also used less chopped onion than the recipe called for (I added in some onion powder instead) just so my kids would eat. This recipe was good but I think it could benefit with a splash or two of cream or even milk.

What a great comfort food. I've never tried making or even tried spaghetti carbonara before this. Recipe was easy to follow, I used White Zinfandel for the wine and added 2 handfuls of frozen peas at the final step (when adding the bacon & pasta back into the pan). Delicious combination of flavors, my usually picky 4 year old wanted 2nds and 3rds on this!

This was really superb! I have to give it 5 stars. I did modify it a little bit using 2 large eggs as opposed to 4 which just seemed like too much. However, perhaps next time I'll be more daring and use the four but I'll definitely make this again. Thank you for a great recipe!!

As a good way to use up easter leftovers, I turn this into pasta primavera- I use leftover ham instead of bacon.  While the pasta cooks, I steam some veggies in the microwave, usually julliened carrots, broccoli and asparagus. Or use leftover veggies.  I add frozen peas after the veggies are cooked.  Then I add the veggies at the end when you throw it all together.

Also, it helps to get the serving dish warmed up in a warm (200*) oven and even put the plates in there if possible. Fill at the last minute  Really helps keep the whole thing from gumming up.

Simply delicious and very easy to make.  Make sure you have a VERY large frying pan when you get ready to toss around the veggies and a pound of spaghetti while trying to cook 4 eggs.  That's the roughest part but I think my skillet was just on the lower end of just-big-enough category.

I love this stuff, even more than traditional spaghetti.  I don't drink wine so I used 3/4 cup heavy cream instead, and 2 eggs.  Very yummy!

This was a really great recipe.  I followed it exactly and everyone loved it, my 6 yr old had fifths.  I used around a half cup of onion (1 small) and think that it could have been easily doubled and add a lot more flavor.  Next time I make this, I will only use 12 oz (3/4 lb) of noodles.  Mainly because there were a lot of leftovers but also because there wasn't quite enough of the mix to evenly coat all the noodles.  Definitely use fresh Parmesan, it really contributes to the depth of flavor!

I made this for the first time the other night. It was my first time making carbonara and it was a hit! My sister and her mother-in-law, who cooks all the time, loved it! The MIL even wants the recipe from me! The only thing I did differently was add a little more extra virgin olive oil. TERRIFIC!!

Love it.  In fact it's one of mine and my son's favorite.  When I cook it I always add alot more bacon.  Haven't tried it yet but probably one more egg.

Great recipe!  I used pancetta instead of bacon and the results were wonderful.  You have to really work fast at the end putting it all together to get the best result and silky sauce.  This is going in my recipe box and I will definitely use it again.  An all-around great quick carbonara.

It tasted great, but I still thought it could've used something else, maybe adding some peas? I still prefer pastas with a true sauce, so perhaps that's why it's not one of my favorites.

This was just ok. Husband just kinda shrugged when I asked him what he thought of it. I guess we just prefer pasta with a sauce. Thanks anyway.

I'm so happy to find this recipe.  So many carbonara recipes are too saucy, like an alfredo with bacon.  This one was just perfect.  I like it with extra bacon and I like to double the parsley and add it with the Parmesan for color.

I thought this was just okay.  Like others, I felt it was missing something.  The flavors were a good pair up, but there was no real sauce.  Will give it one more shot with the wine this time and more bacon and cheese and see what happens.

I was afraid no one would like it,but it was the opposite reaction, Hubby and kids loved it. I used a whole package of bacon since we are meat lovers. Can't wait to make it again. Thanks

Good recipe.  I cook the pasta last however. I drain the pasta and then put everything back into the pasta saucepan and cook it like that. The heat from the pasta helps cook the egg. I also mix the cheese in with the egg. You dont need so much cheese maybe 1/4 of a cup.
 I put the heat on low-medium reducing to low as the eggs cook and stir constantly about 10-15 minutes. Occassionally lifting the saucepan off the heat if the egg starts to clump.
 Also a good idea for the leftovers is to fry up some olive oil and get a nice brown on the leftovers. Makes a nice hash.

Not quite what I was expecting, but very good nonetheless!  I think I got a little too much wine in the sauce, so that flavor was a little strong.  WIll definitely make again, but I might try to find it in a restaurant to compare tastes first.

I made this recipe but I did not have spaghetti, so I used the 1-lb package of linguine that I had.  Linguine is thicker than spaghetti, so it absorbed more than I expected it to.  There was still a lot of flavor though, so I will definitely try this one again, and with spaghetti this time.

Love this dish!
I love pasta, and I am always looking for ways to make it that aren't just "pasta with red sauce".   The only changes that I made were using only two eggs (I only had two, and other recipes used less eggs so I figured it would be okay), and I replaced the wine with chicken stock.
It probably would have been richer without my changes, but it honestly tasted creamy and rich enough.
I will make this again and again.
It was so filling and delicious, and a great change from the ordinary.

I tried to make this recipe more like the Lean Cuisine dinner Chicken Carbonara by adding mushrooms and chicken.   I enjoyed it, although I didn't get the egg part right.  Will try it again with all my ingredients measured and ready beforehand.

I've made Carbonara before and it was a flop, but I thought this recipe was great.  Even my 2 year old ate it.
I read the reviews before hand and took their suggestions and added something to make this creamier - thus being sour cream and I added a bit of nutmeg.  I thought it had too many onions.  I will cut down on them next time.

I have a recipe very similiar to this.  I use 1/4 lb of slivered proschuitto and cook for last 3 minutes with onion/olive oil.  I use beer versus wine.  To spice up, use fresh cracked black pepper to taste individually.  Excellent recipe...fills you up FAST!!!

Im sorry, my family and I thought this recipe had no flavor whatsoever. I added more bacon and pepper, but still didn't help. I ended up throwing it away because nobody would eat it....plus it stunk up the whole house!  I guess I was expecting something creamier, it was dry, no matter how much oil I put in it.

I really like this, I think it is the white wine that makes it special so I can't understand why so many people omit it, if the egg and cheese are added at the same time the eggs won't overcook,

great recipe! i added some yellow and red peppers for a little color, and i substituted the dry white wine for cream. This is much better than your ordinary alfredo dish, and I find it less heavy.

This was the first time we've had this dish and we all liked it (including 3 small children). I think I might try it with kielbasa instead of bacon next time, as the bacon took forever to chop. lol

My husband liked this but he thought a different version was better.  I think so too.  I added 1/4 cup heavy cream towards the end to make it a little saucier.  I didn't think it had enough flavor.  It seemed to be missing something and I used really expensive bacon too.

Delicious! I used prosciutto instead of bacon and it worked out great. Also, I added chicken stock which added a little something extra.

Good recipe.  Added few tablespoons of cream with the egg mixture, to make a creamy sauce.  Also held back a few tablespoons of the pasta cooking liquid, and added to the pasta to acheived desired consistancy.  I HATE gloopy pasta.... Great recipe though

Awesome, awesome, AWESOME!!!  This is very close to the recipe that I usually use, but I never added onion before. I used a drop more white wine and instead of parmasean, I use asiago cheese.  This makes the sauce a little creamier as asiago is not as "dry" as parmasean.  If you do use parmasean, for heaven's sake don't use the kind in a can!  This recipe is not supposed to have a sauce that is as creamy as, say, fettucine alfredo.

It was wonderful!! I substituted a lot of stuff because I didn't have them and it still turned out fantastic. I used vegetable oil instead of olive- that's all I had. I used dried parsley and garlic and no onion - again I didn't have them. I will definitely make it again!

I thought this was not bad but it was not wonderful either.  I added some cubed chicked breats and I followed others suggestions and added some evaporated milk and still thought the sauce could have been creamier. I also found it a bit bland.  If I make it again, I think I will add more garlic and maybe some pepper flakes.

This was absolutely wonderful and so simple to make! But the real test was my husband and 3 children---they all loved it! Even my pickiest eater, my youngest. Thank you for the great addition to my recipe box!

My husband and I devoured this carbonara. It's an easy weeknight dish. It didn't create the creamy sauce I had expected, though, so next time I may try adding a little cream to help bond things together a bit.

No one would mistake me for Julia Childs, but this dish came out restaurant quality.  I didn't add the onion (personal preference), but did everything else exactly according to the instructions.  It was amazing and reheated well the next day, too.

This was an awesome recipe.  I added sauteed mushrooms, cut up steamed asparagus, and removed part of the yolks to cut down on the fat/chlorestrol content.  I used olive oil sparingly.  I used linguini noodles instead of spaghetti.  My husband who is very particular, could not get enough of this, he had five helpings.  Next time I will add pine nuts to the mixture.  I can't say enough about this easy, great recipe!!!  Thanks Sandy T!!!
