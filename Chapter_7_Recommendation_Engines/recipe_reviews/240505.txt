A good way to use leftover marshmallows. I heated some up in the microwave, then mixed in some strawberry jam. Vey quick and delicious and it was easy to only make a few.They only took me a few minutes to make. 
I will definitely make them again.

I made these twice.  Both times I made them the pastry had filling in a puddle around it.  they taste great, but I had problems with leaking.  I crimped the edges with a fork.  The second time I made them I paid special attention to sealing the pastry edges but still same problem.  must just be me, doesn't seem anyone else had this issue.  They are delicious though a bit messy when I make them.

I made 8 of these using canned crescent rolls with about 1/4 cup of marshmallow cr√®me and 1/4 cup of strawberry jelly.  A quick, easy, fun breakfast!
