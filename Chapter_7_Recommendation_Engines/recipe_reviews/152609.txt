This cake is beautiful and very big and impressive.  It tastes pretty good for a cake-mix and coolwhip-type cake and is better made a day ahead and chilled.  Top with some toasted coconut for added flavor.

PatA- It sounds like you haven't even tried the cake recipe. There really is no need then to bring the average rating down by giving it your 1 Star.

I wish that the cakes that are made with processed mixes were labeled in the heading......I'm tired of looking for a homemade cake and coming up with cake mix after cake mix.

This cake is just delicious - it's a huge hit everytime I make it!  I also love that it is so easy to make, and that I always have the ingredients on hand.  I make it in 3 layers rather than 2, and I use the larger size pudding with a tick less than 1/2 c. extra milk (I use whole milk for the pudding and extra creamy whipped topping).  I leave everything else the same.  Best made two days in advance.

I gave this 5 stars because I have made other "cake mix" cakes with the added eggs, sour cream, etc and they turn out much different than a cake mix made according to pkg directions. I have also made cakes "from scratch" that did not turn out nearly as well. I am making this cake today and I chose this one because of the ingredients! To start my only change will be one extra egg. Try it before you say you don't like it!!

Everyone, I repeat everyone, at our Easter dinner raved over this cake! Don't let the fact that it contains a boxed cake mix deter you. I saw that at least one reviewer gave this a one star review without even making the cake. Shame on them. Believe me, follow this to the "T" and you will be making it again and again.

This tasted really good but I couldn't get the layers to stay together.
