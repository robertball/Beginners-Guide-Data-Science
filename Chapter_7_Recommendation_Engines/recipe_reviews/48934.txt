The marinade makes the flavor a little tangy but enjoyable.  The 3 onions are a bit much and take away from the aroma while cooking.  I used 1 and a 1/2 onions and the aroma was very pleasant while cooking.  My husband is a very picky eater as is my son and they both enjoyed the entree.  The meat was tender and fell apart as I took it from the bag.  I made sure the fat was trimmed off the front, I think that made the difference between tender and stringy.  I thoroughly enjoyed this dish and will make it again.

The flavor was really good (marinated the brisket for about 36 hrs) but the meat itself was really tough and stringy. I've never used baking bags before so I didn't know what to expect. I might try this recipe again with a different cut of meat. Thanks anyway!

I kinda did this one out of the box. I rubbed the beef with rib rub, wrapped it up in 3 layers of foil and before I closed it up, added a maybe 1/2 each of red wine vinegar and soy sauce. Popped it on the BBQ over indirect heat for 4 hours. Every once in a while, I turned it around NOT over. By the time I figured it was done, I poured the sauce in a lil pot, added some chopped onions/cilantro. The family Loved it! 6 thumbs UP! Thanks Tobysgirl, Keeper for sure!
