Very nice! If you have an active starter, you do not need the yeast, just plan on a longer rising time. Also leave out the soda for a more pronounced sourdough taste. To use rolled oats, soak them in the warm water for 15 minutes before continuing with the rest of the recipe. I made them by hand. 
Beautiful! Yummy!

The changes I made: 

Rolled oats, 
No yeast,
No soda,
EVOO instead of margerine (used only 1/4 cup)

I used my Kitchen Aid to make these rolls. I proofed the yeast (I used one whole "packet" of active yeast) in the mixer bowl with the honey and warm water for ten minutes until the yeast "bloomed", then I added the starter, molasses, egg, melted butter (which I used instead of margerine), then the dry ingredients. I did run my oats through my mini-processor before using it using the ice crushing feature so my oats would be a finer consistancy. This did need about 3/4 cup of flour more than what was asked for in the recipe. I kneaded this dough with my dough hook for about five minutes, then I set it to rise for an hour in a large greased bowl covered with a tea towel on a warm heating pad for an hour. I used a 1/4 cup measuring cup to make uniform rolls and rolled them on the counter to make better shaped rolls. I covered the top of the rolls in a greased muffin tin with saran wrap before letting it rise on the warm heating pad for another half hour or so. I baked them at 400 degrees for 15 minutes. These rolls were really very good! The oats gave the rolls a nutty kind of flavor--which was just wonderful combined with the yeasty-sourness of the starter and the buttery-molasses-y flavor. These turned out really fluffy and soft and just......incredible! NOTE: I will say that I did not get 24 rolls out of this recipe, I got 12. That was fine for me because that was all I needed. For someone else who wants a recipe that make a larger quanitity, be sure to double this recipe.

My family and I really liked this recipe.  I made half of it into rolls, and the rest into a loaf of bread.  Making 12 rolls out of half of the dough made very small rolls.  I would make larger rolls in future.  The loaf was wonderful.  Tasty and healthful.  Mine had a dark but not too crisp crust, the inside was a nice even and soft texture.  This will be my standard bread from now on.

I'm so glad I found this recipe--the rolls are amazing. I used rolled oats that add a nice crunch to the crust, and I used all honey and butter. The sweetness and the slight tang of sourdough and the texture--wow, they are outstanding!

These were fabulous! I'm always looking for recipes to use with my sourdough starter. I sub'd 1 cup of whole wheat flour for 1 cup of A/P flour as someone else suggested. They can also be made without a bread machine. I used my heavy duty stand mixer. The dough handled beautifully. A keeper!

I made this into two loaves, rather than rolls.  Subbed 1c of the flour with 1c white whole wheat flour, and 3T of flour with 3T vital wheat gluten. Used butter rather than margarine, and whole oats rather than the quick cooking kind.  This had a dark brown crunchy crust and was light brown inside. I couldn't detect a sourdough flavor, but it tasted good.  Thanks for the recipe, Sconner!

While I recommend using a "sourdough sponge" {if you don't know how just look it up on the web} to give some extra sourdough flavor I thought these were wonderful.

I had a new Stand Mixer and some sourdough starter so thought this recipe would be good.

It was GREAT.  The rolls did not make it until the chicken was done though.  Next time I will double the recipe.

Soft and tasty.

Fantastic! I've made 2 batches so far. I followed the recipe pretty closely except for the additional flour needed which is very typical when making bread because of environmental differences. The second batch I used 1/4 butter (1/2 cup is just to much fat in a loaf of bread), and rolled oats that I soaked in the water, 1 cup wheat flour 2 cups white and again additional flour to reach the right consistency. These were light and fluffy with a soft crust. The kids devoured them. I agree it would be very hard to get 24 rolls from one batch but these are so yummy I'll need to double them every time!
    A few hints when using sour dough; it must be  kneaded until the dough is soft not sticky and an imprint with your knuckle springs back slowly. There is a fantastic site to explain the nuances of working with sour dough http://www.thewilbournegroup.com/Sourdough/SourdoughStarterHelp.html , especially note the paragraph on shaping and baking. I've never had another misshapen flat loaf again.(well worth the read).
  We made cinnamon rolls with a batch of these, also very yummy. Thanks for the great recipe!

Wonderful sourdough rolls.  Only change I made was to sub 1 cup wheat flour for 1 cup of white flour to make it a little healthier.  Will definitely make often!

This tastes great!  Using rye sourdough starter, this gives whole grain goodness. I formed some dough into a bread pan, and some into a free formed loaf.

these rolls are amazing....i made them in the kitchenaid stand mixer, added all the ingredients with the dough hook.  Had to add more flour as mentioned by the other reviewers when making in the stand mixer. Very simple, added to mixing bowl, set on low, added additional flour as needed, oiled mixer bowl, covered with plastic wrap allowed to rise for an hour or so, kneeded a few times, formed into rolls and placed on oiled baking sheet, covered with damp kitchen towel and allowed to rise for an additional hour and then baked according to directions! I will be making this again!!!

These are very good.  My sourdough is not very sour so I didn't get that aspect.  However, on the opposite side, I do not think they are too sweet.  I prefer my rolls to have a sweet background taste and these do.  I used about 1 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour to replace some of the ap flour.  I also added a t of lecithin granules and a t of vital wheat gluten.  Consequently the rolls were very light and fluffy.  I did not add the additional yeast because my starter has yeast in it.  The dough did not rise very much because of that.  I will add at least some yeast when I make them again.  I love oatmeal in bread and therefore I love this recipe.  I ended up with 24 rolls, after forming them into golf ball sized balls.

These rolls were pretty good. I didn't use the molassas, just added an extra tablespoon of honey. They had a good flavor and were pretty easy to make. The dough was pretty soft, so I had to add extra flour. I'm thinking next time I make these, I'll mix the four, oatmeal, water and starter and let it sit overnight. The next day I'll mix in everything else. I didn't notice the sourdough flavor, so I think letting it sit overnight will develop the flavor. Definately worth making again when I need to use some of my starter!!

Fantastic!  I have alternated between butter or Crisco on these instead of margarine (bleck) and have had success both times.  My boys like helping with these as well.  Great and easy!

I am a bread baking novice. These rolls are so soft, supple and unbelievably tasty that I had to leave the room while they cool to keep from eating more of them...  I followed the recipe exactly and the rolls are PeRfEcT!! I will be making these again. They are well work the wait!

This is a very tasty roll, but in my opinion not suited for dinner, because of its sweetness. One could eat it for breakfast of course. I will not make this recipe again.

I used old fashioned rolled oats which I soaked 15 minutes ahead and I used 1/4 C olive oil instead of the margarine (for a lactose-free version). I left out the baking soda as well. I don't have a bread maker so I let the dough rise an hour after kneading and before forming into rolls. The I let the rolls rise an additional hour before putting into the oven. The rolls were soft and fluffy with a very nice flavor. These freeze very well too.

I really liked the rolls. I don't have a bread machine so I kneaded the dough the old fashioned way. My total time was about 2 hours. They cooked up much bigger than I thought, so I'll make them smaller - golf ball size, next time. Hope it helps.

These were probably THE BEST rolls I have ever made. I used all whole wheat including my sourdough and they were fantastic. I left out the molasses and used 1/2 coconut oil and 1/2 real butter instead of the margarine. Raised high and were light and delicious!

I really likes this recipe. Unfortunately the measurements weren't correct. I needed more than one extra cup flour to get the dough into a manageable state and the baking time was way off, too.

Great recipe. I halved the recipe and used 100% Kamut flour and made 10 hotdog rolls.  I put everything in the bread machine and let it do the work and then took the dough out and formed them into hotdog rolls.   I slit them down the middle after forming and another time before putting in the oven.   It took about three hours for them to rise but it was a pretty cool day. The finished product probably would hold the hotdog better if you used half kamut and half white flour but the taste was wonderful and I didn't mind holding it together.

Since sourdough starters vary quite a bit in consistency, the exact amount of flour you need may vary from the recipe. My starter is quite thick, so the amount stated works for me. If your starter is thin, you'll need to add more flour.

I began a sourdough starter about 5 days ago and wanted to try making something with it before it got too strong.  I made these as rolls and they actually came out with a roll texture.  Usually when I try to make rolls from a bread recipe, the rolls come out rather dense and bread-like in the middle.  These were light and fluffy inside.  I did have to use a bit more flour (about 1/2 cup) as it was making a very gooey lump in my breadmachine pan.  I also cut the butter in half since it was still way more than I was used to using in bread recipes.  I made about 15 larger rolls and we had turkey cutlet sandwiches for dinner tonight.  I'll probably do a n egg wash over top next time to spiff up the crust a little.  I baked for 12 minutes since my rolls were a little bigger, but 11 would probably have been perfect as a few of the rolls on the edges got a little brown on the bottoms.  I'll definitely make these again!

I've made this recipe twice so far, just mixing the ingredients by hand as I do not have a bread machine. Once I made it with the molasses and once I substituted brown sugar. Both turned out well, though I think I liked the brown sugar version better. It was a bit sweeter and tasted more like a parker house roll to me. I used slow-cooking oats both times. Once I just stirred them directly into the mix and once I followed another reviewer's suggestion to soak them first. Soaking made for a less chewy product, which I think I preferred, though next time I am out, I think I will just get some instant oats to keep on hand.  I will definately keep making this recipe as it is an easy way to use the extra sourdough starter whenever I feed it (just can't bring myself to throw a cup of starter away). Very worthwhile recipe.

these were very good. My dough was a bit too sticky/had to add more flour into it. They were a little sweet for a dinner roll. I think personally I would try again and decrese the honey to be less sweet.*I made these again with some changes. 2nd time around I used half the molasses, half the honey, flour: used 1/3 wheat and 2/3 white +added 1/2 cup of flour; beat it in the kitchenaid mixer with a dough hook on low for  5 min. THIS one I like!Family did not care for the" sweet" one but gave the version with less sugar and part wheat flour the thumbs up.

WOW! THESE HAVE A GREAT FLAVOUR AND AMAZING SOFTNESS!
I FOLLOWED EVERYTHING EXCEPT I LEFT OUT THE BAKING SODA.
I ALSO LEFT MY STARTER OUT ON THE COUNTER OVERNIGHT TO FORM THE "SPONGE". I COULD REALLY TASTE THE SOURDOUGH IN MINE!
BEFORE GOING IN THE OVEN I EGG WASHED THE ROLLS.
I WILL MAKE THIS FOR ALL THE HOLIDAYS!!!!

Made these with 1 cup of wheat and 2 cups of white flour. Used butter and 1 1/2 tsp. of yeast since I live at high altitude.  Rose well and tasted good. 1/2 cup of margarine is a lot for a bread recipe so I will reduce it to 1/4 cup the next time.

This is the most flavorful bread I have made to date. I skipped the yeast and increased baking soda to1 tsp. I was a little worried that it did not raise good (took 2 hours) but when I baked it, it did raise alot more. This one is a keeper. I use a temperture guage to tell when it is done. 200 degrees. No more underbaked bread.

ehhh these were only so so.  I think the other reviewers made me think it was going to be something special but it seemed like more effort than it was worth.  They didn't rise very well and were very heavy for my tastes.  I also made the San Francisco sour dough at the same time and it was fabulous. . .maybe that's why this scored so low?

I made this almost exactly as written, but I was looking for a loaf...the only variation I did was to leave it all in the bread machine through the entire bread cycle. Made a very delicious loaf of bread...just as written!  Thanks for the recipe, Sally!

Make this recipe often.  Made some personal changes after making my first batch.  Thanks in advance for your original recipe, Sally!!!!  I use Organic Coconut oil in place of margarine.  Also use egg replacer for egg.  Old Fashioned oats instead of quick cooking. Substitute 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 2 1/2 cups unbleached all purpose for the flour.  Leave out the molasses and my sourdough strain is from 1847 started on the Oregon Trail!  Famous with my family and friends!!  Mostly organic, too!

I made 8 large hamburger size buns and two tiny loaves.  Did not use a bread machine, used the Kitchen Aid to do most of the kneading since this dough is on the "sticky" side.  Also did a milk wash on top before popping them in the over.  They came out beautiful and delicious!

Other than the sourdough starter I use a mix of whole wheat and soy flour when I make these and they always turn out great.

These are yummy. I don't own a bread machine, and probably never will. I start with the water, honey, molasses and yeast, add egg and butter and then the rest of the ingredients. I'm guessing the dough cycle of the machine lets it rise once. I didn't and ended up with fluffy but small rolls. I'll give it another rise the next time.

AWESOME! I replaced 1 of the cups of flour with whole wheat flour, used all honey (hubby not a fan of molasses), and 1/3 cup olive oil in place of the margarine. So light and fluffy!

Im always looking for great recipes for my sourdough starter and this was a winner!  I did not use a bread machine.  I combined wet and dry ingredients seperately (after proofing yeast in the water with a TBSP of sugar), then folded dry into wet in the kitchenaid.  I sprayed my hands with some canola oil, rolled 12 equal size balls and coated with a touch of flour then placed them in a 9X13 pan.  I let them rise until they were at the top of the pan and then let them cook!  My picky wife loved the recipe!  Thanks!

wow.  i would have not believed a "sourdough" recipe would be this good!  it is not sour at all.  it is sweet, just as sweet as "sweet dinner rolls", but (thanks to the sourdough) the texture is amazing.  they have a crisp outside and soft middles, soo soo soo delicious.  The flavor and the texure are just unbelievable.  must try!!

These are very good - I roll the dough out like a pizza - cut it in long thin wedges like a piece of pizza and roll them up like crescent rolls and put them in buttered muffin cups. Look and taste fantastic. Put extra butter in the muffin cups for "butter buns"! Yum!

These were good and are very fluffy. Very easy recipe and the dough was very manageable. Will definitely make again. These were the perfect balance of sweet and salty, the proportions of salt and honey are perfect. I always love recipes that incorporate whole grains like oatmeal. I added a pat of butter to my warm rolls and gave the inside a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar and they were so good this way but all in all they were good all alone as well.

This was my first time ever making sourdough, and I used 'no-commercial yeast starter' from this site, feeding it 12 hours before making these.
 I omitted the baking soda but kept the yeast because my starter didn't have any. Used 2 tbsp butter + 2 tbsp oil( 1/2 cup sounded like an awful lot). I also don't have a bread maker so I made it by hand, by proofing yeast, mixing in the wet ingredients, then the dry and kneading for 5 min. Then I let rise for 1.5 hours and followed the rest of the recipe from there.
They have a fabulous texture and light flavor...HOWEVER... I have to knock a star down because I could barely taste the sourdough flavor, and it is supposed to be a sourdough bread.

These are fabulous!  Melt in your mouth good and sooo easy!  I used grapeseed oil instead of margarine.  I also used old fashioned oats instead of quick and just soaked them in the warm water called for.  My kids used some of my rolls to create a "bear!" using raisins for eyes/mouth/buttons.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these almost exactly as directed, minus the molasses (didn't realize I was out).  I say "almost" because I used a Kitchen Aid mixer, mixed the dough for about 5 minutes, let it rise in the bowl, formed rolls on my cookies sheet, then let it rise again before baking.  They are yummy... just sweet enough and very soft.  I did make 12 rolls and they're huge!  Next time, I'll make 20-24.

This is more of what I would call a biscuit than a roll. it has a cakey texture not a puffy yeast one. we realy liked it. i think that it'll be delicious in the morning with a scrambled egg and maybe cheese too. 
Took another's advice and used all coconut oil that was solid. No cocnut flavor but a nice sweetness,  unami-type

omg! these are sooo yummy! so tender, moist, crispy outside, fully risen and light, using a heating pad was a jewel of a tip! I love these rolls. Took advice from other reviewers, no soda, no margarine, instead, evoo.. no yeast, just the sourdough starter,  and no salt...I think it inhibits the rising, so..and I used ww pastry flour for one of the cups of flour. did grind the old fashion oats in my mini chopper, to a course grind, added the water to them and let soak about ten mins...ok, that is it. They rose beautifully and baked in about 12-14 mins.   DELICIOUS!

Wow.  I loved these.  I used my fed starter, substituted butter for margarine.  I divided the rolls into 2 9-inch pans.  They needed to bake longer, 15-18 minutes?  Absolutely wonderful.  I'll definitely be making them again.

I love love love this recipe. I don't use any yeast, so I double the sourdough starter. I used butter instead of margarine, and 3/4c. of regular oats. They are so fantastic. I am trying bread next. Thanks for sharing.

These rolls were amazing--both in texture and in flavor!  Two grown men and myself could not stop eating them when they came out fresh from the oven.

These were awesome! I omitted the molasses and used butter instead of margarine but otherwise made as written. They are so soft on the inside!

Very good.  I made it into rolls for the family and then liked it so much that I made another batch that I braided into a loaf and cooked for my dad.

I have made this recipe twice and  we enjoyed them although I don't think they have a strong sour dough flavor.  The first time I formed the rolls into two 8" round pans and found that they didn't cook as well in the center.  I read through the feedback and altered the recipe the second time...decreasing the butter to just 1/4 cup, using all honey instead of both molasses and honey, and using 2 cups of bread flour 1 c of whole wheat bread flour.  The second time I placed them in muffin tins and they were perfect!  Will make them this way again!

These rolls are SO GOOD!!!! My entire family gobbled them up. Although they are not in the "low fat" category, they were worth it. I made no adjustments to them except, knowing bread, the recipe states that you should put them on the baking sheet after the second rising. That would make them fall. You place them ON your baking sheet FOR the second rising. They do not have a strong sour taste from the sour dough starter (and my starter is well aged and very sour), they had a wonderful flavor.

I made this in the basic cycle of my bread machine because I was too lazy to make rolls.  I added 1 cup extra oats and it turned out great!  It was perfect with my whole wheat Herman starter!

I absolutely love the taste and texture of these rolls! I needed to use some of my starter and these make such a light,tender, fluffy, slightly sweet roll. Perfect for the holiday table. I love the little crunch of the oatmeal. I don't have a bread machine so just mixed it up by hand. omitted the molasses and used 4 tbsp. of buckwheat honey, which is a darker, stronger honey. Thanks so much for a lovely roll recipe. Great alternative to using starter instead of the weekly loaf of classic sourdough bread.

This is a great recipe. I did it without a breadmaker and added some ground flax seed and spelt. I've done a bread loaf and rolls and it's been great both times.

I used brown sugar instead of molasses, as I was out.  The honey and brown sugar cut down on the tangyness of the sourdough, so it didn't quite have the sourdough tang we were hoping for, but they were good none the less.  It had firm crust, but very soft inside, just the way we like it!  I made 16 sandwich sized rolls instead of 24 dinner rolls.

Skip the yeast and baking soda. Just have it risen in longer hours. I used 4tbsp egg whites instead of whole egg and 2 tbsp of butter only. It turned out so good!

So amazing! I have been experimenting with my sourdough starter and this recipe is truly one of the top! I used my Kitchenaid mixer. I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and the rest AP. I also had to add about an extra 1/2 cup WW flour because the dough was too sticky. I allowed the dough to raise about an hour, punched it down, made it into rolls and then let it rise again about an hour. I didn’t have molasses so I used maple syrup instead. I have been GF for years and am so excited to find sourdough recipes as I find I am not sensitive when I include the sourdough starter. So yummy!!!

My husband and I thought this recipe was great! Very light rolls with a softer sourdough taste than normal sourdough bread. Worked up easily. The only thing I did different was to make by hand instead of by machine.

love the buns. Didn't put molasses in. turned out great. Weighed each one to be 1.5 oz. approx. Cut the dough in half, made a log out of each half then cut each one into 12 pieces. Worked out perfect.

Great, easy recipe. I don't have a bread machine so I used my Kitchenaid stand mixer with the dough hook attachment. I also did one batch with an egg wash which gave it a nice shiny, crispy crust.

I love to use up bits of things, and found this recipe. My sourdough was due for a good feeding, so this recipe was the springboard. Okay, I really didn't make anything like this, but I used this recipe for proportion. Boy, are they good! I accidentally mixed some rye berries with oat groats, so I ground them up and used them in place of the flour and quick oats. (Finally got rid of that mistake!) Then I added a little plain flour, and 2 tbsp. gluten, because neither rye nor oat flour have enough gluten. I added baking powder by mistake, so added some baking soda too, and a little kefir, for a little acid. I had more dough that it called for by then, so adjusted salt and yeast accordingly. Oh, and I got to finish off the honey in my cupboard, since I had increased the total dry ingredients  Are you still following me? ;) Oh, what the heck, let's throw in another egg! I questioned the instructions. Didn't seem like enough for 24 rolls. I don't have a bread machine, so I used my Ankarsrum mixer and kneaded for about 10 minutes. The dough was lovely, and I had high hopes. I had enough dough to measure out 24 - 2.5 ounce balls of dough. Had to let them rise an extra 20 minutes. Then I had some left over egg wash from some pastry I did yesterday, so I brushed the tops of the rolls with the wash (got rid of all of that, too), and then sprinkled six each with Himalayan salt (course ground), sesame seeds, poppy seeds, and black seed. I'm not sure I can ever duplicate them. Why wasn't

I've made this recipe twice now (as a loaf), and both times were fantastic. The first time I followed the recipe exactly, and ended up with a very, very light. mildly sweet bread - think Wonderbread. My family raved about it. The second time, I wanted something with a stronger sourdough flavor and a denser texture, so I omitted the water and yeast, doubled the sourdough starter, adjusted the flour, and let it rise overnight. It made a beautiful loaf with a strong sourdough flavor, still nice and moist, but with a denser more "artisan" texture. Both ways were excellent, just depends on your taste!

Beautiful and delicious rolls -- very soft and tender! I mixed the ingredients in my Kitchen Aid mixer since I don't own a bread machine. I was able to make 8 perfectly sized hamburger buns out of the recipe. I will definitely continue to make these again with only one change: replace the molasses with honey since the family prefers the taste of honey over molasses.

I had been looking for a recipe that incorporated my love of sourdough and my partners love of honey oatmeal bread  let me just say...this is AMAZING! I have not changed anything from the original recipe, and don't feel like I have to.  I have made these weekly, and have made them to take to my mothers for a family dinner.  Made as pan rolls, dinner rolls, sandwich buns and loaf bread.  Definitely a staple I my kitchen.

I thought with only 3 cups of flour, I could make this into a loaf in my bread maker.  Wow.  I was wrong.  This stuff gets HUGE.  It's delicious and fluffy though.

Made it and it turned out well, but don't really like the taste of honey in it.  Next time would use some other sweetener or less honey.

Yum! I did everything exactly as shown in recipe except I added a just a little more honey. I normally put quite a bit of honey in my sourdough recipes because hubby doesn’t love the sourdough taste.

I was disappointed with the flavor. Just seemed flat and not “yummy” like I expected.

They needed more time to Golden and the bottoms were not crispy at all. Baked in Pampered Chef pan that I use often for rolls and other foods that have crisp crusts so it wasn’t the pan.

I have it 3 stars because the first time I made it I found it too sweet and the molasses was overpowering. The decide time I reduced the honey to 2tbsp, omitted the molasses and bashing soda and reduced yeast to 1.5 tsp. Instead of butter I used coconut oil. I then baked it as one large loaf. The bread has a nice crisp crusty with a light spongy springy inside.

I made this in my mixer stand instead of a bread machine. I left out the baking powder and reduced the added yeast to 1 tsp. Consequently. It took a bit longer to rise (about 2 hours during the first rise and another hour for the second). After shaping into 16 rolls (8 in each of 2 9" round cake pans), they baked into beautifully caramel-colored rolls. It's a simple recipe that yields very fluffy rolls with a wonderfully fragrant and sweet finish. I've been on a sourdough discovery kick and this recipe is on my list of favorites (along with Sam's Sourdough Waffles on this site).

Turned out beautifully.  Used stand mixer rather than bread maker.  Topped rolls with melted butter straight out of oven and the family gobbled them up.

These rolls were fantastic! I made 2 kinds: sweet (cranberry poppyseed) and savory (rosemary and pumpkin seed). If you do want to make savory rolls, I suggest adding more salt to the mix.

Changes: I didn't have a breadmaker, and hand-kneading seemed to work just fine. I let the dough rise a bit before forming it into rolls. I used a sourdough sponge with no additional yeast. The rolls were baked at a lower temperature than suggested, and a little longer, since I made slightly larger rolls.

Great recipe! A new favorite for our family. I followed the recipe exactly, but I did grind the oats up a tad smaller in my coffee grinder and I used an egg wash before baking. Soft and tasty!

I've been searching for a great sourdough bread recipe, and I've definitely found it! I love that it includes oatmeal, molasses and honey. I used 1C wheat in the flour, butter and omitted the baking soda and was pleased with the results. This is a keeper!

These are some of the best rolls I've ever made or eaten.  Just a bit sweet, they are wonderful for small sandwiches or with soup.  They are soft, and the oatmeal gives them a hearty texture.  These will definitely be my go to recipe for rolls.

I have a lively starter, so I skipped the soda and extra yeast. Instead of honey and molasses, I used a 1/4 cup of sorghum syrup. (if there's a choice, and I have some, I always prefer sorghum) I let it finish in the bread machine so I have a loaf, but it's a very light, slightly sour bread. Very nice.

Amazing find! First off, I did not use a bread machine and I made a loaf pan bread out of half of the dough since I didn't need a lot of rolls. I also used old fashion oats (it's what I had). The oats just meld into the overall bread and made it great for sandwiches!  I replaced the molasses (which I didn't have ) with Maple syrup. I had to add quite a bit of extra flower but that could've been because my sourdough starter was thin. It's a new favorite at our house.

light, fluffy rolls.  I made them into cinnamon rolls.  They take longer to raise than regular yeast bread, so just be aware of the extra time to proof.  Worth the wait!  I used old fashioned oats and did a quick chop of them in the food processor so they wouldn't be so chunky.

this is suppperrrrr supppperrr good, soooo soft. i don't have molasses so i change it to brown sugar and i change the all purpose flour to bread flour. and turn out soooooooo goood, the dough is soft but not sticky anymore after the 1st raising. the dough is very similar to Taiwanese dough that i make before. this is a good base dough. so soft and have a nice soft crust. i make 3 kinds from 1 recipe , 1 is plain, 1 topped with course salt and the last on i topped with sugar and sesame. all is very good.  you can brush it with honey also after baking for the plain one to make it more sweeter and sticky on top. smells great i can taste the oat really well. up date : just bake it for second time using all purpose flour this time. the taste is not the same i think i should change it up to bread flour next time. it have better texture.the one with all purpose flour is a bit dry . because of this i down my rating from 5 star to 3 star only.

Absolutely fantastic. I didn't have molasses so I substituted brown sugar but otherwise kept the recipe and I am so, so impressed. I'm always looking for more things to do with my starter and this will be a go-to for the rest of my life.

These are yummy! Mine didn't rise much at first but plumped up nicely in the oven. I made these with my Kitchen Aid and I did need to add a lot more flour, about 3/4 cup, but after the first rise the dough was very easy to work with. I was a little disappointed that mine didn't brown, and the molasses gives the dough a slightly 'off' color. I also used about half the molasses because I think a little goes a long way. Will make again with a few changes. The sourdough flavor and the texture from the oatmeal is wonderful.

I love this recipe.  I don't have a bread machine.  I made them the old fashion way - by hand!! The rolls had great flavor.  I used one cup of wheat flour in place of one cup of the wheat flour. Next time I will definitely make a double batch.

I made my first ever sourdough starter and used this recipe to try it out, substituting whole wheat for half of the all-purpose flour, but think I prefer the recipe as published. Preparation was a breeze and the results FANTASTIC! Better than restaraunt-quality and cheaper than thaw-and-bake.  We use this again and again for soft and fragrant dinner rolls or for larger sandwich rolls.

Fabulous recipe. I even misread the recipe and only used 1/2 cup of sourdough starter instead of 1 c. and no molasses( i didn't have any) but extra honey. I also substituted 1 cup whole wheat flour instead of all purpose. Used my bread maker until i get a stand mixer with dough hooks for Christmas (dropped a hint to hubby today!)

This is a great recipe.  I have a good started so I did not use the yeast or soda.  I changed out one cup of white flour for one cup of oatmeal flour.  They rose up high and had a great flavor, and a tender crumb.  I will use this again and again.

These rolls are amazing.  I used butter instead of margarine, but only half of what was called for.  I brushed them lightly with melted butter when they came out of the oven.  These are a keeper.

These rolls are amazing! I cut the amount of honey and molasses in half but only because my husband doesnt like sweet bread. The texture and flavor were just what I had hoped for and my family LOVES them! Thank you!

These were great, and I didn't even put in the oatmeal! Thought I had some oatmeal until I went to get some.(oops)
I also only used 2 T. honey and no molasses. Maybe a little too much butter in the dough for me, but still good. When they came out of the oven I brushed them with melted garlic and dill butter. So soft and moist. I bet they will be even better with oatmeal. Thanks!
