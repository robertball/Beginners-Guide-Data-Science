This has fast become one of my favorite salad dressing recipes and I can hardly keep it in the house!  It works great on everything from just plain salad to onion rings to a veggie dip.  Very versatile and very tasty.  Thanks so much for sharing!

This dressing has a distinct, intense flavor. Slightly asian. It is very thick, more like a dip. So add milk to thin into dressing consistency.

Wow!
I'm temporarily in Belgium and there's really not many dressings here that I'm used to or like for that matter. Well I decided to try this on witloof and IT WAS DELICIOUS!! I didn't have any BBQ so I used regular old ketchup and it still turned out wonderful. This is by far the best dressing I've had in a while.
Side note...I also added a teaspoon of onion powder only because I like the combo of garlic and onion.
Thanks for this recipe, I'll be using this for a long time.

Quite interesting. I made this early this morning so it would have time to set before I used it for salad dressing. I did add one teaspoon of onion powder. I don't know if this was really a dressing for me, at least not for salads. I think this would be a good dipping sauce for chicken fingers or maybe even homemade jo-jo's but on salad, it was a little........different. Oh! I bet this would be great on maybe a chicken salad or even steak salad. Just a regular vegetable salad, it just didn't seem like a good fit for me and my family thought I might be right. I'm going to make this again and try this on a meat salad and update my review.

This has replaced all dressings in our fridge.  I make a batch every week and it is our all-time favorite.  I use it as a sandwich spread also.  Just remember that it does need time to chill for the flavors to blend.

This was strange when I tried a sample plain, but it is awesome on salad. I mixed it with basic salad stuff, plus I threw in some steamed okra. The okra went really well with it. I haven't tried it as a dip yet, but I bet it'll be great like that too.

I really didn't like this and actually ended up throwing it out. It tasted weird and too sweet on its own. In salad, it wasn't as bad, but it still had a very weird flavor. And more importantly than anything else, I couldn't stand the smell of it. Bummer!

Good! I was looking for a dressing to make to go with seared ahi tuna and spinach salad, so I decided to try this. It has a perfect hint of Asian flare that I was looking for. I used a little extra fresh garlic, only about 2/3 of the honey it called for, added a bit of onion powder, and a splash of milk to make it a bit less thick (as other reviews stated). This should go great with dinner. Thank you so much.

Wow!  This is great as a dressing or as a dip! Refrigerate at least a couple of hours as stated in the recipe.  The flavor is greatly enhanced and well worth the wait!

This is exactly what I was looking for and I wasn't disappointed! Yes, it is addictive. I prepared it for my couscous salad and it is perfect. I will also be making it over and over. I think I will try using plain yogurt in place of the sour cream next time though..just to experiment.

this is awesome. i did sub soy sauce for tamari and i used a bit less. i used reduced fat mayo and sour cream. i also used minced fresh garlic since I didnt have the granulated on hand. Its sort of a creamy asian dressing. its a nice switch from the normal. i used it on a chef salad. i will use this again.

I like all the ingredients in this dressing, so I was surprised that I did not like this dressing at all.  Just tasted strange to me.

Made this years ago, but just going through my recipes now to mark which ones I've made. a guy at work just loved this and would not stop talking about it. He just asked me about it the other day as to when I'm going to bring him some more. I guess I should make it again!

This is very very tasty but I have to admit to never using the tamari  sauce as it does not seem to be available in my town. It works great as  a dip for fresh vegetables as others have stated.

I used to wait tables years ago, and they had the most amazing creamy garlic dressing, I'm searching for something similar...this is not it.  Think, "lays BBQ potato chips" flavor, sweet and salty flavor, and I like those things, and those flavors, so this isn't a total wash but what I wanted to serve it with really needed the white creamy kind, not BBQ chips kind...it is also quite thick, so good for a topping or dip, not so much tender greens...olive oil, cream, milk or maybe a touch of rice vinegar might thin it a bit...overall yummy, just not the kind of yummy I was looking for...I also skipped the garlic powder and added more fresh.  Will add fresh chives right before I eat it...
