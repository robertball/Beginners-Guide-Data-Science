This
is
a
delicious rice recipe, but in my opinion, it needs less turmeric.
With 2 teaspoons turmeric the rice turned out more turmeric than lemon. And the rice turned out a little dry for our taste.
I used only 3 green peppers and it was enough. And I didn't use
cashews. With some modifications it will be a very good recipe.
Absolutely easy to make.

Delicious! Tangy and powerful flavors. I served it with crab cakes and it was perfect! I didn’t add any peanuts or cashews as my son is allergic, but it was still good. The second time I made it, I used a tablespoon of roasted diced chilis because I didn’t have the Serrano chili and that was a good substitute. I will make it again!
