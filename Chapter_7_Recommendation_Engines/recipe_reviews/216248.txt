This was very good, great skillet meal for the family.  I substituted quinoa macaroni noodles to add more protein and used cheddar cheese over the top.  We also use homemade spaghetti sauce to cut out the HFCS.  Will make it again!

Made exactly as recipe says, my family LOVED it!!!! My 6 year old actually stayed in his seat and ate until it was all gone! That's HUGE!!! There was non left, and that doesn't happen very often. Absolutely amazing seeing how simple this recipe is. Thank you so much!!!! :)

Great simple and quick meal. My husband was so impressed with it that I plan to never tell him (unless he outright asks) it is just canned chicken, noodles, and jarred sauce. I did add some seasoning, just sweet basil and garlic salt. I used penne pasta.

We are trying to eat healthy so I made my own spaghetti sauce. boiled chicken instead of using canned. Precooked noodles, mixed it all together and topped with mozzarella. It wasn't a quick dinner but everyone liked it..some went for seconds. Only gave it four stars because of the way I made it.
