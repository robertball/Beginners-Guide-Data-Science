Very good recipe! Chewy on the inside yet a little chispy on the outside.  I used the mint/semi sweet chips from Nestle and it worked out well.  Adding this one to my Christmas cookie list!

These were great! The peppermint flavour is not overpowering, these taste somewhat like the Arnotts mint slice we get here in NZ. Delish! I used a full cup of butter instead of half butter half shortening. Will definately make these again!

I made some changes. I used non hydrogenated margarine instead of shortening and butter. I  used unbleached flour instead of bread flour. I also used some dark chocolate chunks, and some broken dark Belgium chocolate wafers and I used dark German cocoa powder. The cookies turned out good. I would definitely make these again. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

For me, these cookies came out dry and they didn't spread much at all.  I don't like when cookies, especially chocolate cookies don't spread.  I think next time I try to make this type of cookie, I'll go with a regular chocolate chip recipe and do my own modifications.  *second set came out better.  I flattened the cookies before baking and didn't wait for the edges to get crisp.  1st set may have been overcooked.

Used dark chocolate chips/mint chips instead of the extract.  These were delicious when warm and when cooled.

LOVED THESE! I used unbleached flour, all butter, left out the 2nd egg yolk and extract, used Nestle mint chips (I had bought these and was looking for a recipe to use in) -- next time I plan to make part with walnuts and chocolate chips -- best cookie dough ever!!! :)

These quite honestly are my new favorite cookie!  The mint and chocolate are phenomenal!  I highly suggest using white chocolate chips instead of dark.  Very simple to make and great taste!

These came out great.  I did use regular unbleached flour instead of the bread flour and Smart balance for the shortening.  The family loved them.

Awesome cookie dough!  I added some walnuts and used mint chocolate chips.  I love walnuts and so do my family.  I got 63 cookies out of this exact recipe.  They spread nicely when they bake, though I found I was better off smooshing the balls slightly.

House smells amazing! Tweaker Alert! I used AP Flour because I didn't have bread flour. I used a whole 10 oz. bag of Andes Creme De Menthe Baking Chips that needed using. I used my melon ball size scoop & Parchment Paper & Baked at 350 degrees for ten minutes, using my convection oven!  15 year old says they taste; "Like squishy Thin Mint GS Cookies!" Thanks for the recipe!

These cookies are REALLY good! My husband took these to work and they were gone in 5 mins!!  I know, I know the purists don't think that you should rate a recipe if you make changes, but my changes don't change the recipe they are just my preferences, and I would still rate it the same without my changes, so there =)!  I didn't use shortening, I subbed that for butter (so in total used 1 cup of butter).  I used 1 whole tsp of peppermint extract instead of a half, and used white chocolate chips instead of dark chocolate, just for variation in colour I found the white chocolate chips made them look better!!!  If you like mint chocolate you will love these cookies!   Give them a try!

This seemed like a nice Christmas recipe. I replaced 1/2 of the chocolate chips with mint chips & thought it turned out well. The bites with the mint chips are better than the ones without so I highly suggest that. This is a sample cookie recipe though! My 1st sample cookie baked as suggested and burned horribly!!! I'm so glad I didn't ruin a whole pan! I ended up baking them at 300 for 8 minutes!

Amazing...  I used extra peppermint just because I love peppermint and I only had milk chocolate and semi-sweet chocolate chips so I used 1/2 of each. Came out perfect!!

This was probably one of the easiest cookie recipes.  I did refrigerate the dough before baking and they baked beautifully.  I would definitely do these again.  I had leftover dark chocolate and mint chips that I used and they were a hit.  A nice St. Patrick's Day treat for the kids.

I'll make again.  They do taste like the girl scout cookies.  Halved the recipe and came out with 12 regular sized cookies.  Used 1 egg did not use another egg yolk, although I wonder what I missed by not putting it in!  A nice treat, something different.

Love, love, love these cookies! I lost a Paleo version of this recipe from when I made it a few years ago and I've been searching for one similar for a long time and think I've finally found it! However, this recipe calls for too many chips imo. Like others, I opted out of the mint extract since I had a couple of bags of Toll House's Winter Chip Mix. The recipe calls for a 12 oz bag, but Toll House bags are 10 oz so I used 1 bag plus 2 additional oz. and chips were falling out all over the place. The chips do not adhere to the dough very well and the dough crumbles before you can roll it into a ball. I just grinned and bore through it singing Christmas carols and laughing all the way. I would make them again, but I need to figure out how to solve the crumbly dough problem first.

I don’t know what I did wrong and pretty sure I followed the recipe exact, but mine turned out terrible. They are dry and salty balls of chocolate.

Delicate and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Not exactly chewy though it certainly was delicious. the thicker the cookie, the less crispy it is. Cookie dough will spread in the oven and be prepared for it to rise quite a bit.

Delicious and easy. Used splenda for baking instead of white sugar. Used 1.5x peppermint extract to up the flavor a bit. Made 2 batches with my smallest scoop-1 as written with choc chips and 1 with choc, vanilla, and andes mint chips and pecans. Both delicious. Looked done at 7 min on 335 convection but the next day were very dry-need to be sure they look very underdone, maybe 6 min?

1/2 tsp of peppermint extract is too much for me.  I don't use any now, I just use the peppermint flavored chocolate chips and they are very good.

I used a mixture of all the milk, dark & white chocolate I had in the house. Cookies turned out good but thin mints are better.

These cookies were very good and my 2 daughters loved them! I halved the recipe as my wife would be too tempted to eat them too much! Next time though i would reduce the salt a bit.

These cookies are delicious! I bake at high altitude so its not often that I can find a good cookie recipe that isn't dry or hard. I have been doing some experimenting lately and made a few small changes. I didn't want to alter the recipe too much so I tried to stick with it for the most part.

I upped the temperature to 390, added 2 tbs more flour (kept with the bread flour) , about 1/8 tsp less of baking soda and added about 1/4 cup of milk.
