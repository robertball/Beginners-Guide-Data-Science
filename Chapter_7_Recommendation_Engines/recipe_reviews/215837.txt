So easy and so delicious! Plus it's a great way to beat the summer heat on nights when it's just too hot to grill. The recipe for the meatballs is very good and while I was skeptical about doing this in a crock pot vs. my usual way I was pleasantly surprised. I used a jar of my favorite Classico sauce and added a little minced garlic and fresh basil along with a few splashes of red wine along with the rest of the ingredients. I cooked it for 6 hours on low and it smelled wonderful. When it was done I served it on toasted crusty Italian rolls with some mozzarella and topped with shredded Parmesan and Romano cheeses - YUM!

These were really easy to make I happened to be staying home from work one day and thought I would pull out the crock pot for a meal. My husband and kids loved coming home to this.  I made a couple of modifications though.  Everyone has their favorite spaghetti sauce so I used our family favorite instead of Classico, I added diced tomatoes with basil and oregano instead of the can of crushed tomatoes.  Also, I had read on another recipe for a different spaghetti sauce to add 2 tablespoons sugar and 1/2 cup red wine.  I thought I would try it with this recipe, when I took a taste of the sauce I thought I had made mistake by adding the wine, but after 6 hours in the slow cooker it was really enhanced the flavor.  My kids said it was the best sauce I had made.  Not something I would make everyday, since it takes 6 hours in the slow cooker, but defiantly worth it in the end.   The meatballs came out great also, not to dry and full of flavor.   I will be making this one again.

I used chopped green pepper, onion, garlic, and panko bread crumbs with two eggs in about a pound and a quarter pound of ground chuck.  I used dried oregano, parsley flakes, basil, and a few red pepper flakes for seasoning.  The sauce was not as thick as it could have been, but I added a little Anduille sausage slices to it plus the above herbs again.  The amazing thing to me was that I set my slow cooker on high and in about four hours, the large meat balls were cooked and the sauce decorated the seperately cooked pasta.  Much more sophisticated than country with one large meat ball on the lighter, shimmering red sauce.

I thought these were pretty great.  I made the meatballs the night before and browned them in a skillet first.  I also seasoned them more heavily than the recipe calls for (Italian seasoning, basil, oregano, garlic powder and onion powder). Left out the onions for my kids. Instead of a jar of sauce, I used 28 oz of crushed tomatoes, 1 can tomato purée, 1/4 c red wine and lots of the same spices I used in the meatballs.  The meatballs were incredibly moist and tender and I just LOVE having dinner made by 10 am in the morning!!!!  Will make again.

I’ve never made meatballs in a slow cooker, so I decided to give this a try.  I liked the method, but the recipe itself was sort of boring.  The sauce just wasn’t that great and there was way too much of it, for us anyway.  I think a good quality spaghetti sauce without the added tomatoes and puree would have been better.  Although I doubt I'll make this exact recipe, I can see making meatballs in a slow cooker again.  Regardless, it's always fun to try something new.

This recipe was awesome! I used ground turkey instead, Hunts pasta sauce(original) and I had twice the amount of crushed tomatoes so I left out the tomato puree. I also did not have parsley so I added some oregeno and garlic powder to the sauce. It was really good, next time I want to add some more herbs. Also I did not have italian bread crumbs, I had original so I added tonys seasoning and it was delish!

It was pretty good, i did the sauce a bit different, i used 2 jars of orgainic sauce along with a can of tom. sauce and a small can of tom. paste, the sauce itself was great,. the balls were a bland as hell. I even added alot of seasoning but it still wasn't enough

we really enjoyed these meatballs, but i added1/2 tsp salt to the meatballs, next time I will add a whole tsp. I also added pepper. I left out the puree and added more spices. And instead of the bread crumbs, I used about 3/4 cup Quick oats and I prefried the meatballs in a little oil and then only had them in the slow cooker for 3 hours on high.

Great go-to recipe!  No changes except to add 1/2 tsp of salt to the meat mixture.  Great for subs!
