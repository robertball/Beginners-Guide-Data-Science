Delicious! No matter what combination of veggies you use this is going to be good. This is a great base to get creative and use what you may have on hand or fresh from your garden. I used portobello mushrooms, tomatoes, zucchini, yellow squash, red and green peppers, and red onion. I also used pizza sauce vs. pesto. You can also add different types of cheeses as well like fresh mozzarella, Asiago, Parmesan or Romano. Chopped fresh basil is a great addition too - YUM!

Very good.  I put a few different toppings on mine, because I didn't have squash, onions or portabella mushrooms.  I did add sliced mushrooms to bf's pizza, but left it off mine because I don't like mushrooms.  I added red peppers to mine.  Only issue I had was with the times, but I think that's my grill--even the low setting is too high.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I loved it, I made my pizza dough and I added some onion.  I also added some goat cheese on top along with the gorgonzola because I didn't have fontina and it was fantastic, thanks so much!

I love how versatile this dish is!  I change up the veggies depending on whats in season.  And lately I've marinated some veggies in italian dressing before grilling them and putting them on the pizza.  Gives it an extra kick!  Thanks Yum Yum for such a great recipe.  :)
