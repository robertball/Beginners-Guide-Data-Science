Super recipe that I've used for years. My original varys slightly, so for those who aren't quite sold on this version, here are the amounts in mine: 1 c oil, 1/4 c soy sauce, 1/4 c corn syrup, 2 T seasame seeds, 2 T lemon juice, 1/4 t garlic powder, (no garlic salt) and 1/4 t ginger. I allow my chicken to marinate overnight and use pineapple chunks in addition to the vegetables mentioned. Otherwise, the proceedure is the same and the results are always excellent.

These kabobs are absolutely delicious! I made them for my wedding reception, and they were eaten in a flash. I used 1/2 honey and 1/2 corn syrup in the marinade, and let them marinate several hours. I also used different colors of bell peppers, and whole, small mushrooms. I love these.

My husband and I loved this marinade.  It was easy to make and was delicious.  The best part was that it only needed 2 hours to marinate.

These had a great tangy/sweet flavor.  I used olive oil rather than veg oil and I used fresh crushed garlic rather than the garlic powder.

This was very good and easy to throw together.  I was expecting more of a sweet flavor from the Karo syrup, but it was just a very subtle sweet flavor.  I also cut the recipe in half and I had plenty of marinade for 4 chicken breast halves.

This is a wonderful recipe.  We have also used the marinade recipe for stir fry and to marinate a pork loin then grilled it.  I marinated the chicken overnight in a ziploc bag.  It was soooo tender.

These are the BEST kabobs I've ever had, and I am a REALLY picky eater.  I used broccoli, potatoes, onions, tomatoes, and chicken.  (I don't like green peppers or mushrooms.)

My husband and I love these kabobs.  I didn't have light syrup one time and used honey instead and they were still awesome. Fabulous

Okay, this is the first review I have submitted. These Kabobs were so good that I had to take time out of my busy night to sit down and share with you all how delicious these are. I made these for my family tonight and they LOVED them. I will definately make these again. If you are wondering which recipe to try, try this one, you will not be disappointed. I have tried several recipes from this website I have to tell you these might top the list. Try them, you will not be disappointed, restraunt quality!!!

Made enough to feed 12 people for a dinner party of 5 and they were all devoured with rave reviews.

I made it exactley according to recipe, only I do not own a blender so the ingredients were whisked together instead.

I have made these twice now and the results have been wonderful.  Only made a couple of small changes:  I full cup of oil is not necessary, 1/2 to 3/4 cup is plenty, used 1/4 cup of soy sauce and 1/4 cup of teriyaki sauce.  Onion, green pepper and chunks of fresh pineapple were alternated with the chunks of chicken and created the perfect blend of flavors.  Served these with Mushroom Onion Rice from this website.  Fabulous!!

These were just awesome and I am not a grill expert.  Very delicious marinade and easy prep..my family loved them. This will go in my keeper file! Thank you for sharing! I did cut soy sauce in half and used half of teriyaki marinade which boosted flavor and I too used pineapple, zucchini, and cherry tomatoes. Amazing!

These kabobs are delicious! I used 3/4 cup of vegtable oil instead of the one cup and I used 1 1/2 Tbsp of sesame seeds. I used an array of veggies including: Italian squah, whole mushrooms, bell pepper, green onion (the bulb) and fresh cut pineapple. The possibilites are endless. I couldnt stop eating them. Best dish I believe I have ever made. Give it a try.

These were good. I subbed brown sugar for corn syrup - other than that I made no changes and it was gobbled down quickly.

This had great flavor - I cooked the chicken too long, my bad - still tasted great but dry.  Veggies were yummy over brown rice.  Will definitely try again!

This was great.  I followed others advice to use honey and used the juice of 2 real lemons (to make 1/4 cup).  Will probably only use one lemon next time.  Could really taste it in the sauce.  Overall, I thought it was really good and will definitely make again.

This was awesome! I subsituted Honey for the corn syrup and marinated only for an hour and the result was great! I also like to add a little parsley and garlic, but I have tried this recipe as is and it is still amazing! This is a summertime staple in my house now, thanks so much for sharing!

This is a great recipe and everyone who ate them asked for the recipe! I used about 2 tblsp honey instead of corn syrup and used half olive oil and half sesame oil. I would use a little less soy sauce to cut down on the saltiness or a little more lemon juice with my version. I marinated it overnight and did not marinate the vegetables at all. It really can be tweaked to suite your tastes!

Absolutely delicious and easy! I substituted honey for the corn syrup and 2 teaspoons minced garlic instead of garlic powder. I also marinaded the chicken overnight. Couldn't be more simple and my entire family LOVED it!

The first time I made this recipe, I only marinated it for a few hours, and it was OK, but a little bland, I thought. The second time, I switched out the corn syrup for honey, added several cut up garlic cloves to the marinade, and marinated it overnight. It was awesome!  So my tip is marinate as long as you can. My guests LOVED these kabobs!

I've never had much luck with Kabobs but we love this recipe.  Very easy and it doesn't have to marinate all that long.  I didn't have corn syrup so substituted half the amount of honey, but followed the recipe other than that.  The last time I made these I used lime juice instead of lemon and that was a nice touch.

The marinade will really make your grill flare up if you plan on basting the kabobs. And if you use bamboo skewers, make sure you soak them before threading.

This was very tasty, although next time I would reduce the oil.  I used honey instead of the syrup and one clove of chopped garlic instead of the garlic powder.

Marinated Chicken Kabobs  Super delicious recipe,quickly has become a family favorite. Very easy to make which I am always looking for. Only modifications I made was using breast tenderloin and toasting the sesame seeds.

These were yummy!  I subbed honey for the corn starch and the chicken was prefectly sweet.  I grilled these on tin foil to prevent the honey from burning (turned out to be a good idea).  Added zuchinni which I will do more of next time in place of the green bell peppers.  Served over white rice and everyone loved them!

I have never enjoyed chicken so much!  (I'm not a big grilled chicken fan.)  I made the marinade the morning before our dinner party and added a little McCormick's Chicken Rub.  I used orange bell pepper, pineapple chunks, shallots, tomatoes, baby portabella and chicken.  WOW.

This was really really good. I made three types of kabobs with chicken, pork and prime rib, each with different seasonings/marinade. This one was the best. I also used it to base the veggie kabobs. I will be making it again soon! Oh, and I only marinaded it for a little over an hour.

In the interests of easy cooking I cooked the veg separately, and just threaded the chicken onto skewers.  They were fantastic on the barbie at lunch today, and the kids practically inhaled them.  Thanks for the easy "things I have in my cupboard" recipe.

This is a great recipe! We didn't have any sesame seeds so we just left them out-- it was still delicious. I agree with others (and it seems obvious) that the longer you can let it marinate the better. We had a small group over for dinner and we made far more than should have been necessary yet there was not a single kabob left at the end of the night.

Excellent marinade. Added mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, bell pepper, onions and pineapple to the kabobs. I doubled the amount of chicken in the recipe but didn't increase the marinade and it was more than enough. I marinated the chicken for about 5-6 hours. Wonderful meal.

I think this recipe should be rated "The Best Kept Secret" or "Yet to be Discovered".  We've been making this for a few years and it's just so good!!!  Of course everyone has their individual tastes but this one seems to please a variety of people.  (I do omit the sesame seeds - just don't think they add much.)

We liked this very much.  I made one adjustment:  because I rather mistrust corn syrup as a nearly universal additive in American processed food, I flinched from it for honey.  After filling the skewers, I had some scraps of onion, mushroom, and pepper left over that I chopped and put into the marinade for the boil up.

I made this for a guest and my husband tonight, and we all loved it. I used chicken thighs instead of chicken breast, and I added chunks of zucchini. I have tried this with the sesame seeds, but I find they just burn to crisps on the grill, so now I omit them. This may be the best kabob recipe I've made yet.

This was a great kabob recipe! Thank you so much. I added zucchini to the list of veggies since i had it on hand. Turned out great! It didn't mention marinating the veggies so i tossed them in olive oil prior to placing on the kabobs but other wise i followed the recipe word for word. (i did squeeze the lemon juice fresh) We served over white rice and was great!

Whole family loved even the smallest at 13 months. I smoked it for 45 min then cooked on bbq for 30. I will try to marinate it overnight next time to get extra flavor.

This was a great addition to our monthly meals. 
The chicken was tender and delicious. I did what other reviews said and added honey and used less soy sauce. I also added pineapple, peppers, mushrooms and onion. Great meal and will make it again.

I've made this several times now and even my picky grown daughter loves it. I usually serve with rice and salad. The longer the marinade the better!

This is a good recipe.  I marinated chicken separate from the accoutrements -  onion, pineapple, red pepper, tomato.  I didn't baste while cooking as I don't ever reserve marinade for that purpose or make extra to cook down.    The flavor was there after marinating for about 10 hours, however could be bumped up a bit.  In my opinion it was almost too subtle.  The surprise ingredient of corn syrup provided the right amount of sweet.  I used this recipe because I had all the ingredients on hand.  If I use again, I'll add about 1/2 tsp sesame oil and crushed pepper flakes for starters.  Thanks for the recipe! :)

Simple recipe for the marinate and my family liked it. Instead of sesame seed I used a ground sesame paste (Tahini). It still was the lemon flavor that came through.

Made these this weekend, and just swapped out honey for the corn syrup, per another's review. Also didn't have sesame seeds on hand so skipped that, but received rave reviews on these at the family cookout. Even my father-in-law who hates chicken decided to try them and loved them! That's super impressive!!

I followed the recipe exactly. My husband & I really enjoyed it! I think next time, I'd make a little more marinade so that you have more to baste on it.

This marinade is really good for chicken. I like the chicken diced so the flavor saturates it more then grilled in a grill basket. Awesome. If you don't want to buy corn syrup (which you might never use outside this recipe) just use 1/2 cup sugar and 2 TBSP water and heat in the microwave until you have syrup.

My version I've used for 30 years : 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1/4 cup oil, 1 Tbl. Brown sugar, 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1/2 tsp. ground ginger, (opt) 1 Tbl. Sherry. Mix all and marinate 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 pounds of chicken from 30 minutes to overnight. Can use whole breasts or cut up for shish kebabs. The best!

I used half a cup of vegetable oil to cut down the fat, and it worked perfectly.
