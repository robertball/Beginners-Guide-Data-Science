I was amazed at how nice this pie is.  I used 1 full cup of pecans, and that was my only change.  The filling was not super sweet but still wonderful.  This pie was all about the pecans, and not the syrupy custard that most pecan pies have.  I will definitely make this again!

OK...beware!!! You HAVE to use WHITE VINEGAR in this recipe. I only had Apple Cider Vinegar on hand & ewww yuck, what a mess! The mixture curdled while mixing it up. Then after baking an hour it still reeked of vinegar smell. Then a test taste made me throw it away:( I will try this one again with white vinegar as a friend told me that the apple cider variety IS the reason mine curdled.

corn syrup is *so* sweet, and i don't happen to keep it in my pantry because i never use it. so in finding this recipe, i had to try it. WOW!! this is such an easy and quick recipe, and sooo good. the "pie" came out custard-y, just the right sweetness and light. not at all the heavy, greasy, gut bomb pecan pies can sometimes be. well worth trying, even if you wrinkle your nose at the vinegar.

my tweaks to the recipe: used light brown sugar instead of the white sugar, upped the vanilla a half a teaspoon, added a couple dashes of cinnamon, and melted the butter before mixing with the sugar.

This is really good because it isn't so sweet.  The only thing I would do is chop the pecans a little.  We loved it.

My modifications:.....
1. Added 1/4 cup dark brown sugar
2. Added another tsp. of vanilla
3. Doubled pecans. Toasted, lightly.........

What I'd do next time:.....
Keep mods 1 & 2.
Add only 1/4 cup extra pecans and would chop them real fine. There's not enough filling and what filling there is is just too light and fluffy to handle many more pecans, imho...... 

Even if you don't add more pecans, chop those puppys fine. :o)
I didn't and cutting slices was impossible. A wreck. I had to spoon it........

Nice flavor with mods 1 & 2.  Very simple and fast recipe too.

I just made this for desert at my firehouse. EVERYONE loved it, it is not super sweet like other pecan pies are. I did however change a couple things, doubled the amount of vanilla and pecans, after all, it is pecan pie. This will definatly be my new standard pie recipe, seriously, everyone should make this.

Thank goodness that I found this recipe again!!! I used this recipe for Thanksgiving last year and forgot to save it to my recipe box. I had to search for it using the vinegar as an ingredient I wanted and corn syrup as one I didn't. 
This was one of the two very first pies I've ever made and it got rave reviews. I followed the recipe to a tee with no alterations. It's sweet but not an overkill on the sweet-tooth like most pecan pies. *****

Thank you so much for this recipe! I have some diabetic friends and i altered this recipe for them. I use Splenda instead of sugar. I look kind of weird but, it came out great! They absolutely love it! Thanks so much.

I really liked this.  I was actually looking for an "oatmeal" pie but couldn't find quite the right thing.  A lot of them had corn syrup which I didn't have and the one's that didn't usually had coconut which I also didn't have.  I was going to try a different pecan pie recipe that didn't have corn syrup and just substitute oatmeal for the pecans but then I saw this one and was curious about it because it has less sugar in it.  So I tried it with oatmeal instead of pecans and it came out really good.  It had a nice mildly sweet flavor and the oats were nice and chewey.  I'll probably make it again.

This pie was really yummy.It is far from the pecan pie I usually make with the corn syrup.I didn't have any corn syrup on hand so I chose this recipe.For my taste it could have been a little sweeter but still it was very good.Thanks for the recipe.

I've made this pie every Thanksgiving for the last 3 years. My family asks for it each year. It isn't too sweet like a lot of other pecan pie recipes.

My mom, who is well known for her more "traditional" pecan pie recipe, gave this recipe 3 stars.  I, on the other hand, LOVED this recipe and I would give it 5...so I compromised.  It really is delicious if you like pecan pie but enjoy things a little less sweet.

I followed this recipe exactly as written.  When we cut into the pie it was as dry as a bone.  The pecans just crumbled apart.  There was no filling whatsoever.  It was a mess.  I had read the reviews and was concerned that it would be runny - HA.

Just made it tonight and it came out so good! Nothing left of it! Even my son who doesn't like pecan pies in general ate it. I was looking for a pecan pie without corn syrup, and this is the first one I found. I made it just like the recipe says. Oh, I used melted butter instead of margarine, as I never have enough soft butter or margarine on hand and I hate the butter sugar mixing. I had a 9 inch pie crust instead of the 8 inch, so I added one more egg and a tablespoon of sugar. It came out the perfect amount. I am going to try more variations of this recipe, like adding chocolate chips, or apples, or simply  make  some berry pie, replacing the pecans with berries. This recipe is not too sweet and rich like other ones, so I'm going to keep it.

I made this for Thanksgiving.  I used the white vinegar like the recipe called for, but my mixture still curdled when I added the egg.  I threw that out, and tried again.  The second time, I added the vinegar to the other ingredients, and mixed that together before I put the eggs in.  It still curdled!  I went ahead and used it anyway.  I only  had a small bite, and what I had tasted fine.  Everyone else who ate it said it was good, and said the texture was fine.  I only saw a couple of other people that said their mixture curdled..did anyone else have that problem, was it SUPPOSED to be that way?

I have made it a lot of times but I prefer to use unsalted butter rather than margarine and I add more pecans., it breaks apart warm but if you can wait for it to chill in fridge, it holds better  to cut and tastes even better. I have made it a few times with grocery store apple cider vinegar and it tastes just as good. I get requests to make this pie often., everyone so far has liked it better than the  ones made with corn syrup. I will never make any other kind. Mmmmm.

Sorry, I really wanted this to be great. I used white vinegar and it curdled it. I used butter instead of margarine (maybe that is the problem but at this point, only one other person had a problem with this so I am guessing it's not the cause.

I had to make another half recipe just to fill my pie dish and it was still a bit shy. This is in the oven right now and I am not hopeful. FYI: I used Heize White Vinegar. I will post again after I try it.

Advice: Don't try this for a holiday, just to be safe. Being that so many liked it, do try it but don't put yourself in a must-be-delicious situation. It will make you nuts if it flops. I should've known better than to try something new on a special occasion. Just a reminder......so should you. :)

This pie was a hit!  I needed a last minute recipe for pecan pie but didn't have corn syrup.  My guests said it tasted better than the corn syrup pies.  I only had a deep dish pie crust so it didn't fill it but would have worked fine with the regular crust (or double the filling to use the deep dish crust).

I love this recipe, thank you for this site, I am away from home and my husband has asked for pecan pie.  Of course my recipe is at home and I was able to find it here.  I always chop the pecans small and use one cup.

I've been looking for this recipe.  It also makes a great pudding.  Bake it without a crust and, yes, spoon out the portions.  I never measured the pecans.  When the pie/pudding looked as if it had enough  pecans, I stopped adding them.  Delicious.

This was delicious! The perfect sweetness! It made a thinner pie than I expected, but it tasted perfect and looked great (even though I accidentally overbaked it!). Thanks for this extremely simple, tasty recipe!
