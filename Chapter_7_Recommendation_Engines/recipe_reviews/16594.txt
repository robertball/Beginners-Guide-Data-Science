I took this recipe and made it my own by omitting the water, adding bananas, strawberries, blueberries, pineapple juice, and a couple squeezes of honey for sweetness and it turned out amazing!

Tried this with the whole family and it was great.  I would not recommend anything with seeds though. :-)

This was very bitter...after adding a cup of suger, it was better.  It did have lots of seeds but this is to be expected with raspberries and blackberries. ALso had to add more liquid.  It was way too thick.

Lots of seeds in this one.

Was very bitter so added 2/3 cup of sugar which improved it a lot.  Then went a bit overboard and added another 1/3 cup of sugar hence creating an energy drink guaranteed to keep the kids crawling the wall for an hour or so. 

Not good at all following the original recipe though.
