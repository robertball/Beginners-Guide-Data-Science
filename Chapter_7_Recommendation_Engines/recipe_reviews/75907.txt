This really is a great way to fix garlic bread.  I used my usual garlic and onion powders and added more or less to suit our tastes.  I used oregano in place of basil and mixed everything together and spread it on a sliced baguette.  This went great with spaghetti and meatballs.  Thanks for sharing.

All my friends yelled at me for cooking dinner on my birthday, but hubby did dinner the whole weekend so how could I complain? I don't really know what garlic paste is, so I just roasted a couple of heads of garlic and smashed the cloves. Soooooooooo good Rita and thanks!

I have to say, mayonnaise is a little unconventional, but after all, this is garlic bread Mama Rita’s way…and it’s good. I used rolls from an excellent old Italian bakery in Milwaukee, which I believe makes all the difference.  This will only be as good as the quality of bread you use. Other than using fresh minced garlic rather than garlic paste (not really sure what the submitter meant) I didn’t play with the recipe.  Hubs is out of town so I only made one roll for me – good thing.

Love this recipe.  Perfect use for leftover sandwich rolls.  You can sub minced garlic or garlic powder for the paste if you don't have it on hand.

This was delicious. You can use any sort of rolls and cut them in half or in quarters. I also topped it with mozzerella instead of parmesan cheese.

Pretty good tasting garlic bread. I couldn't find garlic paste so I used finely minced garlic instead. This made a lot of garlic spread, I had more than plenty for the loaf of French bread I was using. Better tasting than the pre-made garlic breads at the market. I liked this even better than Pepperidge Farm's frozen parmesan-garlic bread.

Woohoo! I gave this recipe a try & I am sooo glad I did! It was the perfect garlic bread in every way. The only thing I did different was use oregano instead of basil (none on hand). Went perfect with my Sunday gravy. Can't wait to make it again. Thanks Rita.

The edges burned, and the middle didn't even get warm.  Good ingredients, bad baking method.  May try again baking at 400 instead of broil.

Oh, dear. This is DANGEROUS. I made a half recipe of this using marked down hoagie rolls--nothing remained. I had a couple bites of one and had to restrain myself. No leftovers.

Delicious and easy garlic bread.  I liked the addition of mayo and the use of fresh basil.  Will make again.

mmmm..... delicious!  the best garlic bread I have ever made!!!  It's not a strong garlic flavour but the combination of basil, garlic & parmesan cheese is heavenly. The mayo adds just a touch of sweetness. Thanks for the recipe!

Since I tried this recipe once, I can't stop making it.  Absolutely without a doubt the best garlic bread ever.  I never have fresh basil so I always use dried parsley.  And I don't even know what garlic paste is so I just use minced garlic.  I have used this on hamburger buns, whole wheat bread.  It works on everything!

Really good. Made as written except I topped half of my loaf of Italian with the parm and the other without. Dare I say the without came out better? It did. Yummy garlic bread!!

This is a very good recipe for garlic bread! Even my extremely picky 2 year old ate it. One thing, watch it very carefully when it is under the broiler! Mine didnt even take 2 minuets before it was nice and brown and bubbly!

This garlic bread was so good for such a quick to put together recipe. I didn't precisely measure everything, but came pretty close. The only thing I changed was using dried basil instead of fresh, because it was what I had, and I used just a couple of pinches. I used lite mayo and butter and just minced my own cloves of garlic. I left out the black pepper, but I do that in every recipe. I just put them in the oven for 5-7 minutes at 350, which is what I had the oven already set to, for something else I had just baked. But, broiled on low would have been great with a French baguette. This is a good go to recipe. the basil really adds that little bit of extra flavor. Thanks!

Yum! Easy to make and fast! Had this for lunch today with soup. I made some modifications and used what I had on hand. Used honey wheat bread and topped it with mozzarella instead. It was almost pizza-like. I baked it for 5 minutes and then broiled for a minute as the edges started to burn after that. I'm going to make it again for my husband to go with our meatball/tomato sauce penne tonight.

I must have put on too much of the Topping because I didn't have enough for all the Slices...It tasted fine, but I think something went wrong with the broiling. They were either burned or not crisp enough. I think next time, I will just bake them instead.

I would like this much better if it had a different spice than basil.  I halved it and it was still way too strong, tastes more like Basil Bread than Garlic Bread.  I think next time I'll use Italian Seasoning or even just parsley.  Otherwise, a good portion size for a meal (I've seen some recipes on here that use a whole cup of butter!)  I used hot dog buns instead of hoagie rolls as I needed to use them up and they actually looked really cute and were a perfect serving size.  Thanks for the recipe, I'll need to tweak it though before I make it again.

Very good, very strong garlic bread.  I served mine New Years Eve, with lobster tails, seafood alfredo and salad.  It is my opinion that in the future this recipe best be served alongside heartier sauces, like red sauce, as opposed to alfredo which is smooth and subtle tasting.  The garlic was an overpowering flavor in my instance.  I could not find garlic paste, used two cloves crushed, might trim that back as well.  Great taste though!

Very good.  Almost identical to the way I normally make garlic bread, minus the garlic paste (I usually just use minced garlic) and mayo.  Incredibly easy, too.  I used 1/2  loaf of french bread and halved the recipe.  Perfect.  thanks for the recipe!

Fabulous! I made these tonight along with Italian Spaghetti Sauce with Meatballs from this website.  I too was not sure about the mayo, but hey it's only 1 TBLS. So I figure, why not try it at least one time. I am so glad I did.  I only used 1 tsp. of basil, just a personal preference. I also did not have garlic paste, so I roasted 6 peeled garlic cloves in foil w/ EVOO sprinkled on them.  400 for 30 min. (actually did this in my toaster oven).  Once the garlic was done, I mashed it and added it to the recipe, perfect!  Also, there were only 3 of us eating so, I split 2 hoagie rolls for 4 halves (instead of the 6 called for).  I found this to be perfect for this paste.  I baked it at 400 for 4 minutes. Then broiled on high for 30 seconds. Do not leave the oven, this will burn fast! My two children loved it and gobbled it up! Will make again!

Freakin' awesome, restaurant style garlic bread! Baked instead of broiled, as I don't have much of an attention span, and had to sub out raw garlic 'paste' for some roasted garlic. Worked out fabulous! Make sure to use real butter and mayo for the full effect. :D Thanks!

We did not have any garlic paste so we chopped up garlic cloves very fine and used the same amount called for in the recipe.  We thought it was too garlicky - and we LOVE garlic.  Will try again with less garlic and maybe some mozzarella and parmesan on top.  We really liked the moistness the mayo gave to the bread.

Excellent, and a great change from the regular garlic bread.  If you're like me and like to have as much of the prepping done as possible, mix everything up and stick it back into the fridge.  Once it chills, the consistency is great for spreading on the bread.  Thanks, Mama Rita!

Darn good overall.  A great way to use up old bread and buns.  I add shredded cheese and always broil a bit longer than suggested, but we do make this a couple times a month.

This bread was great although I made a few modifications. First instead of using hoagie rolls, I just used a baguette and second, I doubled the cheese mixture and Im glad I did because it happened to be just enough. O yeah, and I added some shredded mozzeralla on top of the cheese mixture before broiling. MMMM..

I used roasted garlic and a little garlic powder.  It was wonderful and my family really enjoyed this bread.  I used a loaf of French bread instead of hoagie rolls. Simple and wonderful.

Yummy. I did as suggested and used french rolls (hoagie style). The bread came out wonderful with the fresh basil. Better than store-bought and the usual garlic bread recipes. I never made mine with mayonnaise before, and it turned out great. I halved the recipe since it was just my husband and I, and it was more than enough for 2 whole rolls (4 halves).

I thought this was a bit on the rich side but I was the only one who thought that - I guess I'm just a garlic bread purest - garlic and butter makes me happy.

I LOVED this garlic bread!  The only thing I did different was exclude the black pepper and substituted parsley for basil.  But that's only because of my taste preferences.  I'm sure this recipe is FABULOUS as is!  I made this two days in a row because everybody gobbled it up and wanted more!

This was good. I didn't have "fresh basil" so I used "fresh Italian flat leaf parsley," also used a 'french bread' it was on sale. Baked in the oven at 425 degress for 10 min, then broiled, just 2 min. or so.

I really thought the hoagie bread was a great idea.  I usally use french bread, but that is sometimes a little thick, and you get a little bread with some flavoring.  This you got a lot of flavoring to compliment the bread. Also, I usually use minced garlic on my garlic bread.  The roasted garlic really gave a depth to the flavor. A great recipe!

I never thought of using old sandwich rolls for garlic bread before.  That's a great idea - thanks.  This will be a good way to use up the last of the bread when it starts to get a little tough on the ends.

This spread is delicious! I used dried basil and Italian seasoning; I didn't have garlic paste so I mashed 2 garlic cloves into a paste and added to the butter, which I doubled. We spread it on sliced french bread and gobbled it down!

Five stars! My wife, who *loves* garlic bread, looked at me funny when she saw me putting mayo in the spread. I told her have faith. And she was rewarded, this is an excellent garlic bread. It took closer to five minutes on broil, not 2-3. And I used French Bread, not hoagies, as I had it laying around. Dee. Lish. Us.

Fantastic! The soft hoagies crisp up nicely around the edges. And the mayonnaise - who would have thought?!?! I added some parsley and used garlic powder, instead of garlic paste.

This bread is great! I had to sub garlic powder for the paste, but I loved the mayo addition and using hoagie rolls instead of French or Italian bread. The ONLY thing I'll do different next time is use half the amount of basil.

I tried these under the broiler and in the oven and we prefer the oven. My neighbor insists on using mayo in place of butter when it comes to cooking bread and sandwiches. I thought it a little weird, but he is a chef so I tried it and LOVED it! The mayo adds a nice moistness. If I had not already tried the mayo, I probably would have omitted it in this recipe, but glad I didn't.

YUM!!! So good! This was a perfect way to use up leftover hoagie rolls. After reading the recipe, I remembered my mom using hoagie rolls/hot dog buns to make garlic bread sometimes when I was growing up. All the components came together very nicely... we loved the bread, thank you. :)

Very good!  I just crushed 2 cloves of garlic and added them to my paste - this was really good and very garlicky. It gave me another reason to use my homemade mayonnaise, also on this site. Loved it! Thank you for posting this recipe!

Great flavor!!  I used sub rolls and only made a couple the first time and saved the rest of spread in fridge for another time.  Baked at 400 instead of broiling for about 5 minutes.

I made this just a stated except that I did not have fresh Basil so I added a few sprinkles of garlic powder to kick up the flavor.  My family loved this and it is so simple to make.  This will be a regular at our house!  Thanks for sharing this delicious and easy recipe!

This was good.  I used shreadded parmesan as the topping and it turned crunchy.  The next time I will use grated or maybe even mozzarela or provel.

This was so good....thank you! I didn't have any fresh basil, but I'm sure that would have made it even better. I was kind of doubtful about the mayo, but it was delicious.

Very very rich, but good! Husband wasn't too keen on the fresh basil, but I loved it. Thanks!
