Oh my, this is the best white bread to come out of my bread machine in a long time.  I followed the recipe exactly, but put the ingredients into the pan in the order recommended by the manufacturer of my machine, NOT in the order listed here.  I used bread machine yeast, so did not proof the yeast in the water; I added the water and oil, then the flour, then the spices, salt, and sugar around the edge, and put the yeast in a little crater in the middle.  My machine makes 2-3 lb loaves so I set in on white, two pound, light crust, and it rose up so fluffy and perfect.  Great sandwich bread too!  I've printed this recipe and can't wait to make more.

This was very good! I made this exactly as written and thought the flavor was great. This is definately a bread for the rosemary lover. This would be great dipped in some garlic infused olive oil. I will be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Easy. Dense bread with light crust. I used fresh herbs so doubled the amount.

Added a tiny bit more yeast and set my breadmaker on "quick rise" because I thought it a bit overproofed the first time, and I also add a touch more oil, too. Otherwise, great recipe. PARTICULARLY GOOD used as bread for hot roast beef grilled sanwiches with Tillamook Vintage White Chesddar. MMMMmmmmm. . . .

I tried this recipe and followed it exactly.  My bread machine says to add the yeast last, but I went ahead and let it proof in the bottom of the machine bucket like the recipe says.  The loaf didn't turn out at all.  It smelled wonderful, but it never rose and it was a hard deflated mess.

This is the best recipe my bread machine has ever made! The recipe is excellent and was gone in about an hour!   Reading other reviews, the bread came out dense.  However my loaf came out light and fluffy!  I after the 10 minute yeast/ sugar wait, I added olive oil, then the mixed seasonings and salt, and finally the flour.  I'm not sure if that had anything to do with my loaf coming out fluffy but HOORAY! GREAT LOAF!!

Terrific recipe!  I brought it to a dinner party, and it was a big hit with the crowd.  Served with soft butter or olive oil, it is the perfect (and simplest!) appetizer.

It turned out just like the photo and the taste is wonderful.  For my machine is was a 2lb rapid loaf 1.5 hours on lite crust, then let it cool.

Flavorful bread.  I've never baked my bread in the bread machine with the instructions given by this recipe and thought i would give it a try.  The crust was crunchy and the inside was quite tender. This recipe says it makes a 1.5 lb loaf but I think it's more like a pound.

Excellent recipe! SO easy and came out PERFECTLY! nice thin crunchy crust, super soft dough. loved the step by step instructions for using regular dry yeast instead of bread machine yeast which I can never find here! Threw in some coarsely chopped black olives and chives. Cut back on the thyme. Next time will double up on the garlic and rosemary for a more poignant savory taste. Lives up to it's name though! Super Easy! Thanks for the recipe!

I baked in the oven at 375.  After 10 minutes, I brushed it with vegetable oil.  Put it back in for 12 more minutes to finish.

Fantastic bread.

WOW! This bread is so Terrific!!! I made it exactly as the recipe says in my bread machine and it turned out so amazing. One of the best bread recipes I've ever made. We sliced it up and dipped it in marinara sauce and enjoyed it so much that we ate the whole loaf in one sitting. It is definately a favorite in my home. This recipe is a keeper! Thank-you so much for sharing it and Thanks also to all the wonderful reviews of it which helped me decide to try it. I hope others will try it and enjoy it as much as we do!!!

This recipe is the BEST bread I've ever tasted. It has a surprising and delightful sweetness to it. My bread machine runs warm, so I omitted a teaspoon of yeast, and since I was working with bread machine yeast, I changed the order, putting in the water, oil, and salt first, then combining the dry ingredients and dumping them in, then creating a small well in the top of the dry ingredients and adding the yeast. It was PERFECT! I also made a garlic dipping oil for it... it is AWESOME. My roommate and I ate almost the whole thing in about 15 minutes!

Very good and easy! My only suggestion is to mix up your oil and herbs in a small bowl while the water-yeast-water mixture is setting for ten minutes. It's a good use of time if you aren't busy with anything else!

This is my all-time favorite bread recipe! I double it and bake it in my oven instead of the bread machine. This bread doesn't even need butter because it is so flavorful.

I don't know if it's the olive oil or what, but this bread has such a lovely texture that I can't explain.  My 13-year old son tasted it and hugged me!  I made it on the "dough" setting in the machine, then baked at 350 until it looked golden brown.  A keeper - probably makes good rolls or "knots".

Oh My!  This just came out of my machine and am super pleased.  I gave it 4 stars because I changed two things.  I did not proof my yeast & I was out of garlic powder so left it out.  Put in the ingredients in the machine according to my machine's instructions.  Rose beautifully.  Super flavorful even without the garlic.  King Arthur AP Flour, King Arthur Fast Yeast, a Touch More Oil.  Also toasts up beautifully.  Am using toasted squares for the Spinach Artichoke Dip w/ tomorrow's Thanksgiving Apps.  Thank you for sharing.  I will be making this again and again.  Oh!  I actually mean another loaf right now as we keep eating it.  Might not have any leftover for tomorrow.  Update:  I am making me 5th loaf right now.  Has become a staple in our house.  Thank you, again.

Followed the recipe exactly and it did not rise much so I was worried it would be dense and flat. To my delight, it came out soft and fluffy in the middle with a nice, lightly crunchy crust. All three picky kids loved it. Note to those using a large bread machine (mine is a Zojirushi): this recipe will cook a very small loaf as written. To get the larger loaf, the recipe will need to be doubled. I will try that next time.

I attempted to make this recipe twice and it failed on me both times.  The first time, the yeast didn't seem to 'work'.  It smelled so nice that I tried again and the second time it turned out worse- it was a crumbly mess.

Maybe my flour was the problem.  I used Robin Hood All Purpose Best for Bread flour(Canada).

It's a shame because it smelled amazing!

This is a wonderful recipe!  I've tried the original, then tried doubling the herbs.  Both turned out great (but we did prefer the doubled herb batch). Yesterday I used this recipe to create a light rye bread by changing the 3 C white flour to 1 cup each white, whole wheat & rye flours - also dropped the herbs but adding 1 Tbls caraway and ground flax seed. EXCELLENTLY AWESOME RESULTS!!! -  In each case, I used my bread machine to only mix the dough, baking the loaf in my oven.  As suggested by others, I followed my bread machine directions with regard to the placement of the yeast (not premixing it). - I'm thinking that I won't be buying 'store-bought' bread very much anymore - so THANK YOU STACY!

Soooo good!  I added 4 tsps of Vital Wheat Gluten and did not proof the yeast; following my breadmaker guidance.  It was great with just a little spread (we are vegan) and even better toasted for a sandwich.

Great and easy bread recipe.  I ran out of all purpose flour so used half whole wheat flour, and it came out just fine.  Other than that, i followed the recipe exactly as written.  The fragrance during baking is simply delicious.  I will add sliced olives my third time around.  I doubled the herbs the second time and used 2 cups wheat flour and 1 cup all purpose.  This will be a regular item at my house!  Super yummy!

Easy and delicious. I didn't have any rosemary so I subbed it and the thyme with dried Italian seasoning and some fresh chopped parsley. I had instant yeast so I used 2 1/4 tsp and it worked great. I didn't have to let it proof. Loved the flavor of the olive oil. I used the light setting for a 1.5 lb loaf. I turned off my machine about 7 mins before the end because it looked just right to me. Will definitely make this again.

I like my bread lighter and fluffier than this recipe originally allows.  So I made some slight changes to get that restaurant table bread texture that melts in your mouth. I replaced the all purpose flour with bread flour, the yeast with baking yeast, the rosemary with fresh picked rosemary, and most importantly I added an eyeballed amount of extra olive oil.  (really good olive oil).  

My bread machine also called for a doubled recipe.  I learned this about half way through the kneading process when my machine flashed the 'add' signal at me.  I believe I have a standard sized machine so this might be something you should prepare for.

This bread turned out great the first time made exactly as reciped, but I ound adding these subtle changes made for a less dense, air pocket filled loa.  perfect with a plate of olive oil and cab-sav balsamic vinegar!

fresh out of the oven, my friends devoured the entire loaf in minutes.

This is a fantastic tasting bread. By the 4th loaf I added/changed the spices: Celery & caraway seed, dried garlic chips and dried onion. A teaspoon to wheat gluten helps to. (I can't resist messing with things) Also substituted 1c of whole wheat flour.  Overall this is great as it stands with no mods.

I really liked the texture of this bread compared to the other rosemary bread recipe.  If you use AP flour bread will be a little more "airy" and if you use bread flour it will come out a little more dense. I like my bread more airy so I always use AP flour.  I will for sure make this again.

Smelled goo while it was baking, but the taste was bland.  It was just okay.

Very good, moist inside, light flaky crust. Nice flavor, not overpowering yet not too subtle. I made this using the ingredients listed, but using my machines recommended order. No mixing yeast w water. I used bread machine yeast and added it after the flour. I used 2 and 1/4 tsp yeast instead as that's been the common amount in all other recipes I have used. Hopefully this made sense and it is helpful to someone. You can surely double the spices if you are looking for a stronger flavor. But as is this was great!

Really enjoyed this. Fantastic texture - great for toast. I add the yeast last, as recommended by my breadmaker. Update:  After making this about 6-8 more times over the few months, I have come up with a slightly more healthy version without sacrificing taste. Reduce both sugar and olive oil from 3 Tbsp. to 2 Tbsp. Increase the rosemary to about 2 Tbsp. Substitute 1/2 cup white whole wheat flour for the white flour if desired. I always use bread flour instead of all-purpose.

This bread tastes amazing.  I was a little skeptical to be using all purpose flour rather than bread flour, but the dough was the perfect texture & it raised perfectly.  The crust is a hard shell over a light, fluffy center.  I used rosemary infused olive oil so only used 1 teaspoon of actual rosemary & it was perfect.  I did not proof the yeast, just added it as the last ingredient in my bread machine & it was fine.  I will definitely make this again.

We are fans! Not too herb-y and turned out fluffy. I think the bread machine instructions trump the directions here. I followed my bread machine instructions (liquid, dry and yeast on top) and it turned out great. I did the dough setting and made rolls baking at 350 for 15 after brushing the tops with butter and sprinkling with sea salt. Delicious.

I usded 1 1/2 tsp. of bread machine yeast INSTEAD of the 2 1/2 tsp. of active yeast. Did everything else the same. It was perfect. The reason a reduced the yeast measurement is BECAUSE that is a better amount and average/typical for a 1 1/2 lb. loaf in the machine. Thanks for the recipe!!

I followed the recipe, but used my own bread machine directions (it has a yeast dispenser). Like some other people, the dough smelled great, but didn't rise at all.

This bread turned out wonderful. The texture and flavour was great. I followed the steps exactly and was very pleased. I will be using this as my base recipe for bread, just changing the "flavour" as I like. Added bonus: no egg and no dairy means my little one can enjoy this too. Thank you so much for sharing! (This is my first ever review - this bread is that good)

The house smelled GREAT making this in my bread machine.  I grow my own rosemary, and thyme so I used fresh herbs, and garlic cloves instead of dried.  My husband never wants me to buy another loaf of bread from the store again.

My kids are the world's pickiest eaters and even they gobbled this bread down.  Smells divine while baking, tastes even better.  Served as an appetizer with olive oil/balsamic vinegar/dash of kosher salt for dipping -- YUM!  This was my first attempt with the bread machine and it couldn't have been simpler.

Just made this and had a loaf with dinner. I threw in some sliced green olives when my machine beeped for it. We really enjoyed this! Spread some on our own homemade goat cheese, too. Very simple recipe and came out perfect.

We're new to a bread machine, and this was our fourth recipe. It was by far the best one we've done. I followed the recipe exactly, and the bread came out perfect, with a light but firm crust, tender inside with a lovely flavor of rosemary and a hint of the olive oil. It even looked better than any of the previous loaves! A keeper!

The bread was yummy! But this was my first experience with my machine. I used new yeast and it rose just perfect. But during the bake cycle the bread fell. I followed the instructions of the recipe to the T, but not sure what happened. Too much yeast? Help - because i would like to make it again, but want the pretty crust!

first vegan bread i've made in my bread machine, and I was very happy with it. I also used the bread machine yeast so skipped the step of waiting 10 minutes for yeast to ferment thanks to another person's tip.

This recipe is delicious! I made it for a girls Christmas get together. Everyone had seconds and didn't even use butter it's that good! I took the advice of a comment and doubled all of the dried seasonings except for the salt. I'm glad I did because it was so flavorful, but not overpowering. I cooked it on the basic setting and the 1.5 lb size setting on the bread machine (mine isn't super fancy) and it turned out good. Not as crispy as others have said, but still good and leaves room for reheating the loaf without it getting hard. I will definitely be making this again soon!!!

Made this for a ladies summer dinner, turned out fabulous! I substituted 1 cup whole wheat flour for 1 cup of white bread flour and it worked great. I did think it a bit too sweet, 3 tablespoons of sugar is a lot, next time I will try two. Also I followed one of the other reviews and put items in liquids first, then flour, seasonings, sugar and bread yeast in the well last. I was a bit concerned because my yeast was a week past use date (it is kept in frig) but it was just fine. Highly recommend! 
Served with a cream cheese spread of parsley with lemon. Yum!

This is an amazingly easy recipe. However, I didn't have thyme or rosemary but I had Italian seasoning. I used 2 tsp of Italian seasoning instead. Wow!

This savory recipe is super easy and you can make small changes to the ingredients such as trading out 1 cup of white flour for wheat flour, adding flax meal and/or chia seeds. Next time I might try adding a bit of applesauce to make it more moist. Overall, it is very good.

i followed directions exactly, but my bread maker did not cook it through. it seemed like too much liquid to flour , but with all the good reviews i just went with it. it seemed to require a lot of oil compared to other recipes i've used.

i was able to salvage it by baking in the oven at 375 for another 20 minutes.

i used the "regular" bread setting on my machine.

i really enjoyed the flavor. i will make again, just not sure how. either i will bake it entirely in oven, or just know to finish it there. or maybe i'll just take the idea of the seasonings and add to a tried and true white bread or french bread recipe i already have.

We LOVE this bread!  Its definitely become a go to!

I did as others suggested and doubled everything but the garlic & salt.  

As others also noted,  the dough was a bit dry so I added more liquid.  This was the first time making it so the process will get refined over a few loaves.

Tasted great! Made in my West Bend bread machine. No substitutions, but I followed my machine's instructions for what order to put the ingredients in. Excellent flavor, I'll definitely make this again. Pic shows loaf after a few slices have been cut off (and eaten)!

This sounded like a festive bread for a potluck which had the additional qualities of being kid-approved and vegan. It was really delicious, and an autistic boy at the event sought me out while eating a big piece of it. His mom said that was his way of saying he liked it and was thanking me. (Autistic kids have very fussy appetites.) I had a large slice myself and loved it.  This is a great go-to bread for special occasions.

I love this recipe. I have been making it for years. I have tried it according to standard bread machine directions as well as the directions on the recipe and it was always hit and miss. I found the most consistent way to make it is by proofing the yeast first in the pan and always testing the water temperature with a thermometer. Also making sure to let the yeast proof for a full 10 minutes and it should be thick ,foamy and bubbling, If it isn't start over with the yeast. 

I also add an extra 2 cloves of fresh garlic, extra fresh rosemary if I have it and a little extra olive oil. You can smell the garlic and olive oil as it's baking and it is heavenly.

You can use all purpose flour or bread flour, I prefer a combination of both but it's great either way. You can also use this as a basic bread recipe and make variations like, olive bread or parmesan cheese bread. 

A great crowd pleaser!

Simply the best and easiest herb bread recipe I’ve ever made. My kids (teenagers) are really picky about bread and they devour this. My college student went out and bought a bread machine at the thrift store so she could make this recipe in the dorm. Needless to say we make it a lot. I’ve always made it exactly as written and it’s perfect just as it is.

I made this about a week ago and it reminded me of why I bought a bread machine in the first place. I dug the machine out of a closet and cleaned it up and got started with this. Put the warm water and yeast in the pan first so the yeast can dissolve and foam at the mouth. By the time I got all the other ingredients put into a bowl it was time to add it all to the machine. I set the machine for #8, Sweet Bread, and came back about three and a half hours later to a perfect loaf. It tasted fantastic and was great with just some butter spread over it. Not bad for a nearly new bread machine from Goodwill for $10.

Easy recipe - great results! I did double up on the thyme and rosemary as we like our bread really "herby." We have a Mr. Coffee BreadMaker extra lrg 2 lb. capacity and we made this on setting 3 for light crust. This bread, combined with a good quality olive oil, makes an excellent appetizer. I plan on making this frequently!

So easy and delicious! I didn't change anything. I just cut pieces from the prepared dough and baked then in the oven in the form of a pull-apart bread. Excellent combination of herbs!

I will absolutely make this again!  It is delicious and as per the name it is really easy. I put in the yeast at the beginning instead of following the manufacturer's instructions.   

For substitutions: I used 3 small springs of fresh rosemary and about a teaspoon of fresh thyme.  

I set my machine to make a 1.5lb loaf on the "sweetbread" mode.  I also let the bread sit in the machine for 30 minutes prior to removing it.

It was a delicious bread, I substituted a cup and a half of white flour for a smidge over a cup of fresh ground wheat (white and while wheat absorb liquids different) I found it did not raise much and I can easily fit a double batch in my bread machine, other than being a little small, the flavor was great!

Followed the recipe exactly except I added a little Montreal Seasoning as well as the garlic and rosemary, and I added a LOT of fresh rosemary. The crust was perfect on the light setting and the inside was very tender and yummy! I made this for a Christmas buffet at work and everyone loved it.

I made this as written and OMG it was light, fluffy and not overly herbed.  It came out of the bread maker with perfect color and was terrific with some Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  This is now my go to recipe.

I haven't used my breadmaker in a while and I tell you what, this worked marvelously!  I left out the thyme because I was out, but it still came out wonderful!  It complemented my roasted chicken and pasta greatly!  It's also savory enough that I am eating it toasted with honey this morning!  Thanks again!

This recipe is so easy and amazingly good! I always bake in the oven, not the machine. Bake at 375, came out so beautiful! To the person that gave this one star. It is posdible your bread didn't rise because your water was too warm. 110 degrees, I have found is too warm. I usually aim for 93 degrees.

Super easy and delicious! We had a small amount left over, and it went great with some chicken salad the next day. Still moist and fresh tasting. Loved it! I did use fresh instead of dried Rosemary since that's all we had, and it was very scent-heavy, but the flavor was mild.

this was a great bread.  I used mostly bread flour vs. AP.  I sautéed a half large sweet onion in 1 T butter with 2 minced garlic cloves.  Reduced the EVOO to 2 T.  Used 1tsp each of thyme and rosemary.  I also added about 1/2C of parmesan.  it was YUMMY!!!

Used vegetable oil instead of olive and added a little bit of black pepper. Added the yeast last as per my manufacturers instructions and baked on light crust. This was delicious! Baked up beautifully. Very few crumbs made this a great sandwich bread. May lighten up a little on the rosemary next time.

Thought it a bit dry for my taste, so the day after I used it for toast. Very good! It slices very well. I'll try cooking it on a shorter bread machine cycle next time.

This bread is amazing!! The flavor is seriously the best I have ever tried for rosemary bread. Crunchy outside, light and fluffy in the middle. I used my bread machine recommended settings instead for this and it came out perfect.

This bread is really great!  The first time I made it, it rose too much and squished against the top window of my bread machine.  Since then I have been using only two tablespoons of sugar instead of three, and I haven't had any problems.  I have tried making it with a variety of different herb combinations, and it is delicious every time!

This bread is delicious. It was the first one I've made by bread machine, and it seems to have fallen in a bit, but I'm chalking that up to the learning curve thing (SO not the recipe's fault). I didn't have thyme, so I left it out, but next thyme I'll use it (herb humor).

Made this with wheat flour and turbinado sugar,  used the dough setting on my bread machine, then let it rise again, sprayed the top with olive oil spray, and baked for 25 minutes or so on 375. Perfect!

Delicious bread! It was my first time using a bread machine and I was nervous about putting the yeast with the liquids, contrary to the bread machine's direction, but the bread came out well- flavorful and delicious! My husband and children gobbled it down!

This recipe is amazing! The bread is very light and fluffy and full of flavor!

The first time I tried it, the bread didn't rise at all, but I tried it a second time and it rose and baked perfectly! I found out that what I did wrong the first time is I had the water too hot and used too much yeast. In my second attempt, for half the amount of water I used very hot water from the tea cooker and the other half was cold water from the faucet. And for the yeast, I didn't use a whole little package (for 500g flour), but instead just followed the recipe.

For the flower, I used half white flour and the other half multi-grain and it was absolutely delectable! 

Thank you for sharing this recipe! I will definitely be making it again! :-)

Flavor was good, but the bread itself I had a day or two later and tried to make a sandwich and it fell apart.
I started this in the BreadMachine with the dough cycle, as I have for the breads I have for breadmakers, took it out and let it rest for an hour and bake in the oven.  Again, flavor was there, just not the texture. of the bread for what I wanted it for.  Would be great for toasts instead of garlic bread with spaghetti or make croutons out of it.  I do have another recipe that I may try for sandwiches that does not crumble as much and incorporate these spices
