It's an easy recipe that is tasty and healthy. I didn't use blueberries as they are expensive here in the fall so I used black berries. They added a wonderful sweetness. Very satisfying. I also think that in winter when all berries are scarce and expensive that dried blueberries or cranberries would be great substitutes. It's a wonderful recipe, very satisfying.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was very good but there wasn't enough tuna for the amount of veggies/fruit. Next time I would double the tuna/mayo stated if using the amount of veggies and fruit listed in the recipe.

Wondered how I would like this recipe, but found I loved it!  The mix of ingredients is unusual, but works well.  Would also work well with chicken.

Pretty good recipe.  I did make two changes I doubled the tuna and I halved the spinach.  I will be making it again and next time I am going to add some herbs to lift the taste a bit.

LOVE THIS RECIPE!!

We eat a lot of fish and tuna during the Lent Season, and I needed a fresh recipe and found this. I'm so glad I did. I followed the recipe exactly and used whole wheat tortillas. My husband ate his wrap and came back for another even before I had a chance to try it myself. :) I highly recommend this as a light lunch/dinner. And I will be making this even after Lent has passed! :)

Not bad at all, but I definitely wouldn't go out and buy these ingredients just so that I could make this recipe. Personally, I would add more blueberries and tuna. I also found that  2.5 cups of spinach was enough. Good recipe to keep in the archives though.

This is definitely added to my list of "regulars."  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Amazing!  I felt like I was eating at a resturant when I took a bite of this.  I didn't have apple so I used cantalope.  Amazing!

This was simple recipe that turned out to be delicious! I used whole wheat tortilla wrap and low fat mayo to make it even healthier... I didn't have spinach so I ended up using just normal lettuce instead. It was really good. If you are on low carb, you can probably make this into a lettuce wrap as well. Simple and delicious.

I had to substitute dried cranberries for the blueberries and only used 2 cups of spinach but it seemed like the ingredient proportion was just right.  I especially loved the crunch and sweetness of the apple. Delicious!!

Im always looking for new can tuna recipes and this one is a keeper! I doubled the tuna and mayo, halved the spinach and used 3/4 cup blueberries. Everything else kept the same. Not sure if the mozzarella cheese is needed, I used it becauce I had it. I ate this with honey wheat pitas. A nice light and healthy lunch!

This was a surprisingly good combination! I would've preferred to eat the blueberries alone instead of use them in this salad, though.

Doubled the tuna/mayo and halved the spinach- thank you reviewers! Used frozen berriers. My guests didn't seem to like it as tons left over (did 4x's recipe). Brought left-overs to work the next day tho (lol) where it was devoured! Much better then hence 4 star. Don't think I'll make again though.

This is a fantastic wrap - I took these to a pot luck luncheon and people were surprised that I had made them, they thought they had been a deli store purchase.  Loved the combination of fruits and vegetables. I used whole wheat wraps and will definitely be making them many times.

I really liked it. My sons weren't that into it. one said it was too wet. I think in part because the spinach was a little wet from washing it.

Wow a whole different take on standard tuna salad! This combined a lot of veggies and fruit that was absolutely delish! We had it both on a wrap and just as a salad on the plate and my family loved it!.

First, I admit that I made a few tweaks, but based on how much I liked it, I would have to assume that the original recipe would be good, too. I needed a way to get more protein out of my breakfast and also sneak in eggs, so my changes are: I used two 5 oz cans of tuna, two hard boiled eggs in place of the cheese, and 1 tsp of balsamic vinegar for extra tang. Second, I admit that I was pretty skeptical about mixing fruits with tuna and mayo, but the combination was really diverse and delicious. I just found my go-to high-protein breakfast!

I was pretty skeptical about these flavors working together, but it was amazing! I followed the directions, but then after tasting it I added one more can of tuna, adding salt and garlic powder to it. We didn't have tortillas, so we used crackers. My husband almost ate the entire dish. I had to force him to save some for his lunch. Great recipe!

WOW!  Used a Granny Smith apple and Jarlsberg cheese (because that is all I had). Great blend of flavors.  Easy, quick and yummy.

Surprisingly yummy.  I am not a fan of mixing fruit with meat and or in my salads but I was so bored and desired something different today.  Gave this a shot, out of my food comfort zone and was pleasantly surprised!
