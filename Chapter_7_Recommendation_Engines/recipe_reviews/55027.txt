This may be the "True Manhattan" recipe, but I have been making Manhattan's for years now and what I've found makes them great is make the Whiskey/Vermouth 2-1 ratio then add grenadine or Cherry juice out of a jar of cherries till the color turns red.  A few more calories but are they good.

Oh my, this is my Dad's all time favorite drink and I'll never forget the first time he made me one.  It was a bonding experience for us both.  I agree with others that the Whiskey/Vermmouth ratio is definitely 2:1.  I use Maker's Mark Whiskey and like my Dad taught me - spill some cherry juice in and garnish with a maraschino cherry. Enjoy!

My grandma had one of these every night for years and years and she lived to be 93!  I agree that the correct recipe should be 2 parts whiskey to 1 part vermouth.  Add a little cherry juice, serve on the rocks, and you've got a classic cocktail!  Wild Turkey Whiskey is awesome in this drink.  Best served with cheese and crackers during happy hour!  :)

This is fantastic! For superior taste, and an even truer Manhattan, we always use Canadian rye whisky, not American bourbon. This is our favorite cold weather cocktail.

I admit the ratio is the same but I have been making Manhattans with a jigger (1 1/2 oz) of whiskey, 3/4 oz. of sweet vermouth and a glass filled with ice.  Naturally, cherries!!  LOVE this drink -- it's my signature!

I am an enthusiastic Manhattan drinker ("on the rocks with bourbon, no bitters, please!"), and I couldn't have written this recipe better myself.  Everything is accounted for - up or down, bitters or none - and the whiskey:vermouth ratio is just to my personal taste!  Seriously, I could have written this recipe.  Thanks!!

This is a good mix, as others said, 2:1 is a bit better. But please make sure you use a high Rye content whiskey, as that is the final hint of flavor that makes this a fantastic drink.

I use 2 oz rye whiskey (Whistle Pig), 3/4 oz sweet vermouth, cherry, bitters. Stir with ice. Rub orange peel on rim, pour into glass and squeeze the oil from a piece of orange peel. Delicious!

My all time favorite drink!!  A few notes to make it better: definitely go with a 2:1 whiskey to vermouth ratio; if you use rye, then use sweet vermouth...but if you use bourbon, use Italian vermouth; this may be personal preference, but I like about 5 dashes of bitters; finally (and possibly most important) DO NOT use those nasty fake red maraschino cherries...either brandy your own or buy Luxardo cherries (maraschino cherries as they were intended).

My favorite drink of all times.  If you don't care for the bite of say Makers Mark or other whiskeys, try  Brandy Manhattan, much smoother without the bark or bite.  My preference is a French Brandy called Raynal.  It is 1 step below the grade of Cognac.  Very relaxing.  Take care they will sneak up on you.

I only rated it 4 stars because a 'perfect' manhatten calls for a 'dash' of dry vermouth along with the other ingredients.  Bitters optional.

I really enjoyed reading all the reviews for this recipe.
The Manhattan is a historic drink and be it made with rye, bourbon, Canadian, Southern Comfort, brandy or even scotch, it never fails to warm the heart and brighten the day.  Traditionally only sweet vermouth is used, although to have a "perfect" Manhattan means that equal parts of sweet and dry are used. (If using Southern Comfort or SoCo, use only dry vermouth and the garnish is usually a lemon peel.)

In any event, after having read the reference to the ultimate of maraschino cherries - Luxardo!  I took the plunge and will be enjoying one today after 5 p.m.!

This libation conjures up great memories for most people including previous generations like listed in these reviews: grandmother, father, mother...  In any event, there should be a "Manhattan Enthusiast Society!"  This is without a doubt a great drink to salute the end of a day or maybe the start of one. LOL.
I think that it is the perfect drink to enjoy in a handsome glass, preferably one that is cut so that the contents are displayed to the greatest.

Sorry that I forgot that the variation made with scotch, is called the Rob Roy! Cin-Cin!

3.24.18  For my taste, the bourbon-sweet vermouth ratio is off.  I ended up adding a little more sweet vermouth, and then was all good!

Our crowd prefers less sweet drinks so we used dry vermouth rather than sweet. It turned out really well. We ran out of Angostura bitters after the first round and used grapefruit bitters for the second round - they were surprisingly good.

I bought some whiskey wanting something different, thinking I would enjoy sipping it straight. That was not the case! I was pleased to come across this recipe. Like other reviewers, I made mine with 2 parts whiskey, 1 part sweet vermouth and added juice from the cherries until the drink had a red tint...tasty!

I much prefer this 4:1 ratio of whiskey to vermouth than the 2:1 many recipes use.  I add a little Luxardo cherry juice as well. My dad would be proud.
