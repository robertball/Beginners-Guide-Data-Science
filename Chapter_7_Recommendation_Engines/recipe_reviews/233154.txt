This recipe made a usually dry boxed cornbread moister and more flavorful. It was a tad too sweet for us, I would make this again but cut out the additional sugar.

This by far is the best Jiffy recipe I've tasted. Of course I made a few modifications like most of us on here. I split the recipe in half to make sweet muffins and savory muffins. 1) follow basic recipe minus sour cream and sugar. Increased honey to 6tbsp plus added 1 cup thawed sweet frozen corn pulsed with 2-4 tbsp unsalted butter. Also added 1/4 cup heavy cream to the 1/4 cup of milk. 2) too make savory I added garlic powder, onion powder, black ground pepper, Cayenne pepper and shaved Parmesan cheese ( 1/4 cup or so). I love these base recipes that you can build on. These were a big hit. Thank you for sharing.

Delicious and moist! Did not add extra sugar on top. For a spread, mixed about 1tbsp whiskey, 1 C butter, 2tbsp honey. So good!

These muffins were so great and so easy. I have made them just by the Jiffy directions and they were so dry. This recipe fixed the problem and made them fabulous. Thank you!!!

This is definitely the way to go as opposed to just following the directions on the Jiffy box. I halved the recipe and also put it in a small round cake pan instead of making muffins because my muffin pan is MIA. I also omitted the sugar just as a preference and I am glad I did because it would have been too sweet for us. The cornbread turned out moist and fluffy with a wonderful honey flavor. This will be a permanent switch for our house. Thanks!!

I had two boxes of Jiffy at home but didn't want to use the recipe on the box.  I omitted the extra sugar per the reviews and these came out very tasty and fluffy.  The Jiffy box says that it contains 8.5 ounces of mix, not 7.5 ounces as stated in the recipe so I added a couple tablespoons more milk.  Taking these to Thanksgiving dinner and I think I'll use this every year!  Thanks!

So much better than just using the mix! Moist yet still crumbly.   I don't generally like things really sweet, so omitted the white sugar and cut the honey to 2 Tbsp.  I was out of sour cream so used plain greek yogurt instead- very good.

I've been making my cornbread similar to this forever! Instead of the extra sugar I've used a small amount of maple pancake syrup n omit the honey as well! It's yummy n not too sweet! I've also just used honey alone n eyeball it...very yummy!

I've made the Jiffy cornbread muffins per box instructions and they were dry and bland. This recipe tastes really good; moist and sweet. I did not add sugar, just honey.

I was looking for a great sweet cornbread and this was it!  My entire family loved it. It was perfectly moist.  I cooked mine in a preheated cast iron skillet.

I have made this recipe at least a million times (no, really!) and it makes perfect cornbread every time. It is slightly forgiving as I have subbed half and half for milk when that was all I had (makes it more cake like...yum!) and have added cane sugar in place of honey if I was out. I always use Jiffy boxes mix. Don’t skip the butter basting steps, makes the cake so good!! I’ve made it in cups, and a 9x11 pan, great either way. Perfect under a giant ladle of spicy chili, or by itself.

I just made this for our New Year's Day dinner and it was perfect.  I forgot to add the sugar, but it still turned out great.  Much better than the regular old Jiffy cornbread.  I did cook it in a heated and buttered iron skillet instead of a muffin pan.

I wasn't sure how to rate this.  I made mini muffins and didn't have paper liners so I sprayed the pan with cooking spray.  The muffins completely stuck to the pan so we didn't have much by way of muffin left when pulling them out of the pan.  But my husband really liked the taste.  And one out of two kids thought they were good.  I'll give it a try again sometime with muffin liners.

My husband and I thought these muffins were very good. I didn't have sour cream so used low fat cottage cheese that I had as a substitute. They are very moist almost cake like. Next time I will omit the sugar on top it just added extra calories.

I was looking for an easy way to up the level of a box of Jiffy and this was it!  I did not add the sugar as per other comments.  It would have been too sweet for us.

Soooo. I read the recipe incorrectly and added the butter to the batter. It actually turned out well. So much better than just the jiffy box. Butter makes everything better.

This recipe definitly is better than just a plain box of cornbread, however, I can't say it was a hit with anybody.I did not make them muffins and next time I will. I made them in 2 small loaf pans. I substituted sour cream (did not have it on hand) for cottage cheese and did not add the white sugar as suggested that it is too sweet with it. When making boxed cornbread in the past, I just add half a can of creamed corn and it is just as moist. Just a thought.

My family adores this cornbread recipe. It’s sooooo easy to make and tastes delicious. I omit the sugar topping but do brush melted butter on top. This recipe works for muffins and I’ve also make a cake version in a small cast iron skillet.

Used 2 15 oz cornbread mixes and double everything. 
9x13 pan
Important 1.  Mix 1 1/2 mins (like cake)
Important 2. Bake at 325 - 350 (375 is too high bottom burned took over 20 mins 
Was amazing even with the burnt bottom.

The best corn muffin ever. What I did to minimize the sweetness though I used 2 table spoon of honey instead of 3, and instead of using 2 table spoon of sugar I used a dash of sugar on each muffin. The best. :)

This was great!  I used brown sugar and no honey.  I didn't sprinkle the extra sugar either.  Kids loved it.  Seeing as how my last attempt to cornbread ended up like a door stop :)

I've had really bad luck with corn bread, dense, dry and bland kind of luck. These had none of those problems. They were moist, but still had that nice corn bread crumble to them. Hubby thought they were a little sweet, and since I halved the recipe, I actually wound up putting more honey than called for. So next time I'll try less. I thought the sweetness offset the spicy Jambalaya they were paired with perfectly though.

Omitted the sugar, accidentally mixed the melted butter in, and halved the recipe. Baked in an 8x8 glass casserole dish for 20 minutes at 375*. Came out delicious!! Thanks!

I don’t usually write reviews, but this one definitely needed one. Followed recipes pretty much to a t except I didn’t measure the sugar I just sprinkled it in. I have made this twice so far and both times I have received compliments from everyone in the house including friends outside of my home.

This was delicious and moist.  I subbed honey for the sugar and added thawed, frozen corn to the mix. I had to cook longer than 20 minutes, but that could just be my oven.  I didn’t brush with butter after cooking.  Instead, I sprayed the tops lightly with butter flavored Pam and baked at 450 for four minutes to make the tops a lovely golden brown.  Easy & delicious!

This recipe turned out just as described & They were absolutely delicious. I did make some small changes, just ever so slight but it made them turn out exactly the way my family likes sweet cornbread muffins. 

I removed 1/2 cup of the Jiffy, and added in 1/2 cup of  cake flour to the batter. I then creamed together the butter & sugar until fluffy. These changes helped to make the batter a bit more light & airy without compromising its texture (Hope that makes sense).  I also omitted adding additional sugar on top of the muffins & instead used 1 additional tablespoon of honey inside the batter. It provided the necessary sweetening but wasn't as sweet as granulated sugar.

Our family loves this cornbread recipe. I make it in a 9x13 pan instead of muffins and add half the amount of sugar into the mix instead of sprinkling on top. My niece asks for it every thanksgiving.

These tasted great and had an awesome texture, but I did make some changes. Most notably. ..I didn't read well and only used 1 box of mix. Oops. BUT when I made it like that is was so moist it was almost like cake. Not crumbly or dry. I read a lot of other reviews that they were too sweet, and I don't like honey so I just used the sugar. Turned out perfect on sweetness. Lastly, I only had almond milk at home which is quite watery, so in place of milk I used half almond milk and half Half-and-Half. I like this recipe because even with a lot of tweaks and mistakes it still turns out better than the side of the box recipe.

I made half a batch, reduced the amount of honey, and omitted the sugar as suggested by other reviewers.  Delicious and moist!  Much better than the dry muffins you usually get with Jiffy mix.

Woops, didn't read melted butter is for melting on top & added to the batter! And since Jiffy's actually 8.5oz not 7.5, I used heaping 1/2 cup of sourcream & allowed 1/2 cup milk to overflow. Box says 400° -vs-recipe 375° so I started @ 400°, dropped to 375° x15 min!  Didn't do sugar. Superb!!

don't know why mine didn't turn out well. Mine was kind of tasteless, I expected more with all the extra calories. Will keep looking for cornbread without the Jiffy shortcut.

Love how simple it was to add depth to the generic box recipe. I added the butter in with the batter, no extra sugar and made a 1/2 batch. Very pleased with the taste and results!

This is now my go-to cornbread recipe. The sour cream adds moisture, and the honey adds a depth of flavor that are otherwise missing when you make the Jiffy muffins as directed on the box. I enjoy the nice crust the top of the muffins get when you sprinkle the sugar on top, so I never skip that step. If you prefer a less sweet muffin, simply omitting the sugar sprinkle would definitely help. These are also great warmed up in the microwave the next day.

Per other suggestions, I dropped the extra sugar and the butter basting. I swapped sour cream for 2% greek yogurt. I also swapped regular honey for raw honey. I loved the texture and the taste!

Made it as written and it’s delicious.  They are even better served warm with honey butter.  I also like to add an 8oz can of corn for some different texture.

I love flat “wet” cornbread and my husband likes traditional dry. This recipe is the perfect happy- medium for us. So moist yet firm. It’s the only kind we make now! I’ve made it 3 times in the last 2 weeks! Every time hubby goes to the store he brings back 2 boxes of jiffy and leaves it on the stove lol he eats the left overs for breakfast the next morning with butter because he loves it so much!

OMG.... I had to leave my house because I couldn't stop eating them!!  I didn't have honey so I use some honey flavored syrup, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I didn't find them as sweet as other people suggested.  They were perfect.  I'll never again make corn muffins following the instructions on the package.

I was looking to take something to a potluck. Since I am in an RV, I had to use what I had on hand which was a box of corn muffin mix and a box of yellow cake mix. I made the recipe as is, except that I omitted all the extra sweetness—I figured the cake mix had enough sugar in it. Came out great, the sour cream offset the cake mix sweetness. I did sprinkle a touch of sugar on each muffin, it seemed to brown the top nicely.

The baking time recommended is too long. They will come out VERY BROWN for that time. I found that baking them at 15 minutes was perfect. This recipe is wonderfully amazing. My kids and husband really enjoy them! Thank you!

As most people do, I made a couple of adjustments to suit my family's preferences. I added the butter into the recipe instead of brushing the top, I did not put the sugar in at all, and I baked it in a cast iron skillet. I just prefer the skillet to muffins, though I dropped the temp and it did take a bit longer.

I didn’t add sugar to the top and I made it in two small loaf pans. Turned out delicious!!! Also saw in the comments the butter, whiskey, honey spread and made that as well!!! So good!

Made this on Thanksgiving and my family loved it. In fact they asked me to make it again the following night because there was none left over. I used coconut syrup instead of honey and I did not add the extra white sugar.

Skipped the sugar, but overall this recipe is simple and makes super moist and nicely sweet corn muffins.  Will make again.

I will make it again. Next time I'll definitely heat the oil in the baking dish PRIOR to adding the corn muffin mix; and I'll use less oil. 

I like a slightly crunchy bottom on my cornbread from the preheated oil, and unfortunately, mine had soggy bottoms :-(  Nonetheless, they tasted great, once you cut off the bottoms ;-)

Thanks for the recipe.  I halved it.  Only coated the muffins with butter once because I didn't want to keep opening the oven and we put butter in the middle anyway.  Also didn't do the sugar (laziness).  Went great with our pulled pork and green beans.  My 9 year  son said "Mommy, I really like your corn muffins". 
Thank you!

Everyone in my family liked it.  I thought it was excellent! Very moist, just what I was looking for.  I followed the recipe as written, but used a round baking pan instead. Thank you for sharing!

OMG! This cornbread is DELICIOUS! I have never been a fan of cornbread because growing up it was just dry and blah! There is a local restaurant that has amazing cornbread so I knew it could be done. 

I followed the recipe exactly as written, except I made it in about a rectangle pan (8x11 maybe) and I didn't put the sugar on top. The honey added the perfect amount of sweetness and the sour cream made the bread so moist. 

I am thrilled to have another recipe in my box that I can make time and time again knowing it will always be perfect and everyone will love it!

Beware:  I changed it a little! A little less honey and no sugar. Took it to a potluck and was asked for the recipe. I WILL make it again because it was delicious and moist. Thank you Mindyamac!

Since their is only two of us, I only used 1 box of corn bread mix.  Since I felt that they were sweet enough with just honey; I did not add the additional sugar on top.  These are easy and delicious.  They were served with Cha Chas White Chili also on AR. Thank you for submitting.

Great way to enhance cornbread boxed mix! Did a very very light coating of sugar on top and then topped with the butter and honey mix all throughout the baking process and then once more after I took them out of the oven. Still a little on the dry side but very tasty! Tastes better when warm or reheated

I usually don't blog but I have to with this one. I goofed the entire recipe. My sons allergic to milk so I pureed  1 can 14.75oz cream corn, less 1/4 cup.  Instead of 2 eggs I used 1 egg plus 1 egg yolk I used the honey as directed but omitted the butter. It came very much like corn bread airy creamy and delicious, best I ever had. However when I looked back at the recipe I realized I used only one 8.5oz box of Jiffy corn muffin mix.  The only thing I would do different is omit the sugar and of course it doesn't need the butter. I really don't think I'm going to try it the way it supposed to be now. 
Can't wait to see what my son thinks. I wonder how it worked so well? Though I must say, all recipes was always my favorite because I can usually look at it and know if its going to work or not. If I try it the regular way I will let you know how I do but I doubt  I will:-)
