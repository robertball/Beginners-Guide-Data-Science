I LOVE this recipe! The only change I made was to double the amount of broth, so the curry had a mild flavor and specifically use portabella mushrooms. This is my new winter favorite soup! Thank you!

The only change I made was to add more curry powder. Otherwise it was great. Iâ€™ll definitely make this again.

Only used half the amount of curry and half the amount of mushrooms.
