This almost the very same way my mom used to make us Clam Chowder.  i just omitted the flour as she didn't use any. i cook the potatoes in the liquid until slightly over cooked then stir in the clams and keep stirring gently which helps break down the potatoes a bit more which ends up thickening the soup! YUM!

Perfect and very easy, was ready in 20 min! It is brothier, than usual. As suggested here, I used real potatoes (red, or yellow), heavy whipping cream instead of milk, and 2 tbs flour. 
I never made clam chowder before, and following other suggestions, I used 1 green onion, and added some carrots; mostly for the color and texture.
Recipe deserves a 5 regardless the changes, because those are my personal opinion :)

Oh my, this is so good! The only ingredient I added was a tablespoon of cornstarch with the milk. Very creamy! My hubby loved it!

I will probably use 2 cans of clams next time.
There WILL be a next time.
All canned clam chowder vendors just lost my business.
Be prepared to thicken it up with a tbsp of corn starch.

This  chowder for two was just the perfect amount for two people. We had dinner one night and a cup of  chowder the next day for  lunch.  Very easy to make and very delicious!

Was okay except that canned potatoes have a distinctive flavor which permeated the dish and I didn't care for it. This chowder is brothier than some, just saying.  I did like the smooth texture of the broth.  I used canned chicken broth instead of clam juice but made no other changes. If I make again I'd cube a big russet and cook 10 minutes longer leaving out the canned potatoes. If I don't have time, ironically, I'd just heat up a can of clam chowder. Thanks for the recipe.

I microwaved two medium potatoes instead of using a can. It made two very generous portions and tasted fantastic.
