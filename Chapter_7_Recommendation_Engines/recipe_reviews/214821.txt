I had high hopes for this.  It would've made just an outstanding guacamole.  I'll probably try it again as just that.  But I think what ruined the flavor for me was the can of diced tomatoes.  It took away from the flavor quite a bit.  I mixed it more than I should've because I had to add salt to add flavor the tomatoes took away!  The end result looked like split pea soup.  I will try again, next time I'll modify and keep it as guacamole.

Excellent recipe. I used just one jalapeno pepper (seeded and deveined) to keep it mild. Really loved it, but next time, I plan to use lime juice and add cilantro. Someday, when the kids are all grown up, I'll try it with all the fancy peppers!

Bakermom, if you make this salsamole again, consider leaving out the olive oil instead of the tomatoes. I made some last night and I think the oil is the ingredient taking away flavor. Also green onions instead of yellow can give the recipe a lighter fresher taste because for some people the yellow onion can stick to the palate.

Great Salsamole! We changed it up just a bit... added a single tomatillo and half cup of cilantro.

I have been making a dish very similar to this for years.  I only use fresh tomatoes, but this last time I used the fresh tiny cherry tomatoes and cut them in half(the colour really popped from them). I also add a big bunch of chopped cilantro and only one jalapeno for the peppers.  Make sure that you do not buy over ripe mushy avocados for this recipe or you will have a sloppy mess.  For best results, add the slightly tender avocado's last and gently toss them only a few times so they don't make a sloppy mess.  Chill and enjoy. :)It is always a hit at the parties.
