This was good, but I changed it up a bit.  I added four slices of bacon and a little mozzerella cheese.  The inside was great.  The topping was just ok.   The walnuts were nice, but I think I prefer the tried & true french's onions on top.

Awesome! First time ever trying a green bean casserole and it turned out to be a great hit at my daughters birthday party! Only a serving left at the end of the night!

This was good, but my young kids did not care for the texture of the green beans.  I will cook them longer in the water next time..

Excellent.  Made this classic recipe for Easter dinner and it was an instant favorite.  Didn't change a thing.

This is a good recipe, the only thing I didn't like was that it says to cook the mushrooms so ling, they were completely dissolved into the sauce. I will use this recipe again but I think I will wait to add the  mushrooms until mix in the green beans.

tastes almost like the condensed soup version, but I hate using the canned soups!  I plan to take this to family gatherings now!

It was my first thanksgiving ever having green bean casserole.. I have been missing out! We did have to use celery soup because it was all we had, but it was still soooo yummy!

Not quite a five-star but very much enjoyed. I prepared this exactly as the recipe called for. I wouldn't ever recommend canned soup, but if you are short on time, prepared mushroom soup would do in a pinch.

This made a delicious vegetarian dinner dish and we will make it again.  It compares well with the old favorite dish with mushroom soup and fried onion topping.   I made it with 1% milk instead of non-fat half and half, and it turned out just fine.  We used frozen French cut green beans from Costco instead of fresh beans, microwaving them first for about 5 minutes.  These changes made the dish easy for us with ingredients on hand.

Cut the green beans in half so that they are not so long.
Also I used French's Onion topping instead of bread.

Really great flavor and if you are looking for one that is less creamy, this one is for you.
