I omitted the pie crust (decreased some of the fat & calories) and made this into a crisp. I substituted 1/2 the amount of sugar in the filling and the topping with Splenda and I substituted 1/2 the amount of flour in the topping with oats. Very tasty.

This was an awesome dessert, but a little too tart for my husband.  I made it again and added in a cup of blueberries and more sugar and only put in 3 cups of plums.  I also followed the advice of another reviewer and cooked the plums/blueberries with the sugar for 4 minutes in the microwave prior to adding to the crust. I used plums right out of my yard and did not peel.  I used the all recipes Best Flaky crust recipe and that definitely was a success.   I have found with that recipe for easy cleanup I rolled out between cling wrap and crust did not stick to the cling wrap as it did the second time when I used the wax paper.  I also put this into a 8 1/2 by 11 casserole dish and baked for 50 minutes and I did not cover the tops of the crusts.

I think this is hands down the best pie I have ever had. The measurements are just right so that the sweet and tart are perfectly balanced and it takes no time at all to throw it together. I can't wait to make this again. I used plums that were not over-ripe - about 9 of them - some black plums some d'angelo plums. Although I was wary, you do not need to peel the plums. This is one of those recipes that folks will beg you for.

I wasn't really expecting much from this recipe - I don't really love plums and I'm not sure I've ever had a plum pie before. But I was looking for a way to use up a bunch of them - and I was thrilled with the results. It turned out perfectly - the only adjustment was I added a bit more butter (1 more T.) to the topping since there didn't seem to be enough when I was cutting it into crumbs. You will enjoy this, even if you don't necessarily like plums. Excellent!

AMAZING! My husband said this was the best recipe I'd ever found on the site and I've been using Allrecipes for years. I bought a big bucket of plums at Costco and we just weren't eating them fast enough so I needed a way to use them up. From now on I'll be buying extra plumbs for the express purpose of making this pie. I was worried about the top layer not incorporating with the filling, but it's perfect. It creates a crunchy sweet crust that is to die for.

This tastes fantastic!  We think it's more of a cobbler than a pie though.  I first mixed the sliced plums with a 1/2 cup of sugar and microwaved them for 4 minutes then followed the recipe.  I rolled out the pie shell to fit well in an 8X11 baking dish then poured in the plum mixture and followed the recipe, baking for 50 minutes and not covering with foil.  I served it with butter pecan ice cream.  Every person at the table (8 of us) thought it was one of the best desserts ever!  Thanks for sharing!

If I could give this 6 stars I would! 

We were caught inside during a summer storm I ran out of plums at 2 cups.  I substituted fresh organic blueberries. I also didn't have enough flour to make my own pie crust so we made it without. This was the most decadent and perfect dessert paired  with vanilla ice cream! I will be making this at least once a week.

Very good! I had a couple of pluots that I needed to use up so I made 1/2 of this recipe. The only other changes that I made were that I did not use a pie crust, and I used brown sugar in the topping instead of white. And now i will admit something. I ate this all by myself...within a couple of hours. I'm just keepin' it real...

Excellent!!
Not too sweet and tart just right, great with ice cream or without.  I made it with a home-made crust using recipe Basic Flaky Pie Crust on this web site (also excellent recipe), and with fresh purple plums from my tree.  I replaced white sugar with brown sugar.  I'd say, this is the best pie I've ever tried. My husband who is not big on deserts liked it.

This was fabulous, the perfect combination of sweet and tart.  It was ridiculously easy to throw together, and doesn't require too much fat in the topping, which came out nice and crispy.  It was a perfect solution for a bunch of plums I had bought at the market that didn't taste good at all!

I think I just found my new favorite pie. YUM!!! I used the recipe on this website for Best Ever Pie Crust. And I used a round cake pan. And I made the following modifications to this pie: Added 1/2 Cup brown sugar, increased flour to 1/2 Cup, increased cinnamon to 1/2 tsp. Combined the sliced (unpeeled) plums with the white and brown sugar, then microwaved for 4 minutes before adding the other ingredients. I didn't have lemon juice, so I used white vinegar instead (1/2 tsp vinegar = 1 tsp of lemon juice). For the topping, I wanted a thicker topping after seeing other's pictures, so I used 3/4 cup flour and also added 1/2 cup of brown sugar, increased cinnamon to 1/2 tsp and butter to 5 T (because I added extra flour and the brown sugar). We like our pies better sweeter than tart, so this is why I made these mods after reading everyone's reviews. The crust, the topping and the filling was just melt in your mouth delicious. Definitely will make this again and again!

This is a lovely pie that makes so many people say "yum."  I think it's perfect with vanilla ice cream, otherwise I can only eat a small slice as it's very sweet and flavorful.

I made this exactly as the recipe was written.  Excellent and incredibly easy to make (especially when using a Pillsbury refrigerated crust). Perfect with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.  My husband was eating it out of the pie tin and he doesn't even like plums.  My only regret was not putting foil underneath when it was baking... have some oven clean-up to do.

This recipe was wonderful! I have had my fill of plums this summer and was looking for another recipe to use them up.  My kids LOVED the pie.  I did not have any lemon to add, regardless, it was very flavorful and will make it again!

I followed the suggestion of another commenter -- skipped the crust  and made this into a crisp (save calories for the ice cream!).  For the topping, I used 1/4 flour and 1/4 oatmeal instead of 1/2 cup flour, but kept all other ingredients the same. Might add some pecans on top next time. Delish!! I mean, licking the bowl because I loved it that much!

Used some homegrown plums a coworker gave me so all the plums didn't go to waste. It was waaay too tart.  I think it was because the plums were so small, about 1and a half inches diameter, and there was so much tart skin in the recipe as a result.   Took it to work and no one really ate it and no one commented on it.  I personally did not care for it.   I think it would be much better with store bought plums.

I too made this recipe without the crust and it turned out great.  I followed the suggestions of another user and substituted half the flour for oats in the topping.  This was an awesome, easy dessert that I would love to make again!

I am not a plum eater but my neighbor gave me some and I found this recipe and I'm so glad that I did.  It's fantastic!  This was delicious and would be good following the recipe exactly or doing your own variations.  Mine was not too tart but I added some variations.  I used the Basic flaky pie crust recipe from this site and used an 8x11 dish instead of a pie pan.  I also sliced the plums and added 1/2 cup of sugar to the plums and microwaved them for 4 minutes and then followed the recipe.  (This may be why it wasn't too tart, however I may omit this next time because I like a little tartness; whereas this had very little-but still good!) For the topping I used brown sugar instead of white,used 4-5T. of butter instead of 3T. I also increased the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp instead of 1/4 tsp.  However, like I stated before, this would be a delicious recipe even without these adjustments.  Enjoy!

I don't know if it was the type of plum I used(a very sweet, yellow variety). It was really tart and really runny.

I loved this!!!  Like others, I didn't use a bottom crust and made it more like a cobbler, but I think it was a bit soupy without the bottom crust, so next time I will probably use one.  I also threw in some blueberries, and it was out of this world!  I absolutely loved the flavor!!  I don't like overly-sweet pies, and the tanginess of this one reminded me of the marionberry pies I grew up on.  Mmm mm mmmmmm....soooo good!!!!

This pie was delicious!  We had a bag full of plums to use that were starting to go bad, and this was the fix.  I didn't measure out the plums exactly and it wasn't a problem.  I doubled the recipe and the proportions worked out great, no extra or short for two pies.  One of the roomies is vegan, this was super simple to "veganize" for her.  The pre-made shells were already vegan, so I just left the topping off one pie.  The topping is definitely delicious, so if you're not vegan, don't skip it over!

Added Kiwis too this which made it tart and tasty.  Made it in a deep dish which required extra 45 minutes of cook time.  Delish!

I got a bag of plums at a big discount from my local grocery store and was looking for something to make with them. I made this pie exactly as the recipe suggests and it is the most amazing pie I have ever had! It tastes wonderful and fresh and it's pretty enough to serve to company. This recipe is a real find and definitly a keeper!

OMG! I've never had plum pie or even heard of it, however, plums were on sale, and when I came across this recipe I had to try it. It is so amazingly good! It is most definitely that recipe everyone will be begging you for!

This was a really delicious pie.  I substituted tapioca for the flour and made a double crust pie instead of using the topping.  I used the Ruths Grandmas Pie Crust recipe from allrecipes site.  Baked for 50 minutes.  Yum!

Yum! I took another reviewers advice and did not use the pastry shell (didn't have on on hand). So it was more of a crisp than a pie. I also added 1 cup fresh blueberries that I had on hand. Delicious!

ADD MORE SUGAR!  The pie is very tart, despite the fact that I used ripe plums and added more sugar.  I used my own pie crust recipe and baked it in a 9" pie plate.  I recommend making 1.5 times the filling - I used 6 cups of plum, and it was barely filled the pie plate.  Also, no problem keeping the skins on the plums, although I suspect they add to the tartness.

Delicious!!  I made this just as the recipe called for, except I used 3 cups of fresh yellow plums and 1 cup of fresh blueberries (that's what I had on hand).  I also used brown sugar in the crumb topping instead of regular sugar.  It was so delicious!  The flavors mixed very well, and my family gobbled up almost the entire pie in one night.  We served it warm with vanilla ice cream, but it was also good cold with a dollop of whipped cream the next day.  Great recipe, this will definitely be a regular!

I was  a bit skeptical of "plum" pie, as I had never heard of it or tried it before - but with a bag full of plums from my neighbors, I figured- what the heck!?! So glad I tried this recipe!  This is fabulous! Followed it exactly and my family LOVED it!!! They are asking me when we can have it again! Excellent!!!

I was VERY skeptical when I first made this pie, but I had a pile of plums in my freezer to use up. I love it, it has such a great balance of tart and sweet with a great custard like filling. My eldest son who isn't a huge fan of pie or dessert asked me to make a second one this weekend and so for the second time this weekend in the oven is baking Purple Plum Pie #2.

Typically I wouldn't rate a recipe that has so many glowing reviews already, but with this one I couldn't resist.  Plums are not my favorite stone fruit...necatarines, peaches, apricots...all are preferred.  However, a client of mine presented me with a large quantity of fresh plums from his tree and I came to AllRecipes to figure out a way to use them all.  This pie is AWESOME!!!  In fact, I think it may be one of my favorite pies of all time.  The combination of tart plums, savory crust and crunchy sweet topping is incredible...it was gone by the next afternoon.  Make it!  You WILL NOT regret it.

This turned out tart almost like rhubarb...maybe it doesn't need the lemon juice?  I don't have much experience with plums, but I think the type of plum and ripeness may influence this recipe considerably. Maybe some extra topping would help to sweeten this a little.

It's tough to explain how fabulous this pie is! It was the first pie I had ever made and was, if I do say so myself, the most delicious I've ever had. It is wonderfully tart with an excellent texture and the crumbly top was absolutely to die for. People look at me like I'm nuts when I say plum pie. I feel like it's my dirty little secret :)

Oh Yum! Was feeling so guilty for not using up our bumper crop of plums this year and some of them had gotten over ripe.  Had a pie crust in the freezer so threw this wonderful pie together.  Both sweet and tart-similar to a boysenberry taste.  Ours was very juicy, probably because the fruit was too.  I did sub tapioca for the flour in the filling because there was so much liquid.  I also used half oatmeal-half flour for the topping and really liked the crunch that resulted.  Was glad I baked it on a parchment paper-lined cookie sheet as it really bubbled over.  So delicious with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Thank you!!

I'll give this recipe 5 stars even though my pie didn't turn out.  I don't want to mar this recipes reputation because my plums were not suffice.  This is more of an "advice" than a "review".  I received my half of brown bag full of plums from a neighbor and decided that because I hate to waste food, I'd try to put them to good use.  Well about 7 of the bag were the size of an apricot and the rest were the size of a bing cherry.  They were all over-ripe so I thought that I'd give this recipe a go because most reviews requested very ripe.  Long story short, the skin of the plum is what gives it the rhubarby flavor.....tangy.  The meat of the plum and the sugar gives it the....sweet.  In this case, because the plums were so small, there was way more skin and not enough meat.  Therefore it was extremely tart.  I LOVE rhubarb pie and I could definitely taste the resemblence, but mine was over tart because of the sorry plums.  I even threw a hand full of  fresh blueberries in and added a little more sugar because I knew this would be the case......still didn't work.  Now I'm wondering how unhappy the tree is that this fruit came from.  In my opinion....if someone offers you fruit, ask if you can pick it yourself.  They'll be happy to not have to do the work and you can choose or judge if you'd like any at all.  By the way, I will definitely do this recipe again!!!!

My plums weren't very ripe so I thought the pie was way too tart (my fault, not the recipe!) Anyhow, my husband and kids LOVED it! My 8 yr old usually picks the fruit out of pies, but he gobbled this up. It is a delicious recipe and I'll be making it again with plums from my dads tree.

Fabulous! I used this recipe with some plums I got from the grocery store that were not sweet at all. I used puff pastry sheets instead of pie crust and an 8 x 11 dish. It turned out delicious. And as another reviewer wrote, it tastes just like the McDonald's apple pie.

I am a great pie maker and something is off in this recipe. I noticed when putting the filling together that the filling was very wet. My baking instict was to add some corn starch and heat it on the stove top but I like to stick to the recipe when I am making something for the first time. I didn't add the corn startch. BIG MISTAKE! My pie was pie soup. The taste is nice. I am going to experiment with this one. I am thinking maybe adding some firmer fruit like apple and putting in a bit of corn starch. Maybe some types of plums are much jucier than others and this is a factor. What a bummer!

This was amazing and so easy. I made 2 pies  but ran out of flour so didnt make the toppin so made a lattice crust of the remaining dough . Was short of plums so added apples .a combination of Plum & apples this was the 1st time had a pie with plums in it. For the 2nd pie i used only pears tasted fantastic.I added vanilla essence as well. Would love to try this recipe with Cherry,Peach,figs etc.

Wonderful recipe for plums that I seem to have an overabundance of every summer. Its a bit tart, maybe add a bit more sugar next time. I made mine in a springform pan. Looks more like a plum tart rather than pie.

This was the first plum recipe I have ever used, and it was so good.  It reminded me of rhubarb- with that tart taste and bright red color.  It was very liquid when first out of the oven, but as it sat it thickened perfectly.  Do not cut back the sugar- as another reviewer stated, the proportions are just right.

This was only OK ... more a function of our plums than the recipe I think. It had a funny after taste. The crust and topping were delicious. I think I'll just use the overload of plums to make jam next year.

This recipe was so surprisingly delicious! i had gone to the store and bought some red plums and they were gross. the fruit itself was bland and the peel was just plain tart. i didnt want to throw them away so i looked up plum recipes and found this one. its SUPER easy and sooo delicious. if i didnt know better i would have said they were delicious plums. this recipe is great with cool whip! as another person suggested i used a 9" in springform pan. the crusty topping ended up leaking and didnt get crispy i blame myself. Looks like im going to have to make it again. Oh well :D

I'd give it maybe 3.5 if I could - this was VERY tart.  (and I'm typically OK with tartness).  maybe it was the type of Plums I used (I used Santa Rosa Plums).  Eating it with Ice Cream helped a lot. I couldn't eat it just straight it would be too tart for me!

This pie is fantastic! The perfect combination of sweet and tart.  I had 3 gallons of fresh plums that I had to do something with.  I ended up making 3 of these pies in a week and giving them to friends.  They raved about how good they were!  I followed the recipe exactly all three times. I used a deep dish pie pan and a store bought pastry crust. I baked them for 50 minutes and they were cooked perfectly.  I did not have any problems with the crust getting too brown but then the crust barely stuck up above the filling.  This will become one of my seasonal staples.  Thank you so much for sharing!

My co-workers LOVED this pie - they begged me to make another, and another, and another.  Tastes a lot like rhubarb, and was delicious!  I also made the recipe with peaches instead of plums - and it was GREAT too!

This was a wonderful pie! My friend made her favorite pie crust which was made of dough, and it was good but didn't hold up to all of the liquid. The crumble on top goes great with the plums!

We have firm sweet plums... and this pie was PERFECT!  It wouldn't be too hard to modify for extra juicy or more tart plums either.  It tasted a lot like cherry pie, but came out of our backyard!  Yay!  I left the skins on... no problem.  I also didn't make the crust because I didn't have time and although the crust would have been awesome, it was not ruined by omission!    Best served warm with vanilla ice cream.

great use of the bushels of plums we got from our trees.  Quick and tasty, not too sweet.  Took others' suggestions of using the Flaky Pie Crust recipe and adding some blueberries to the filling.  A keeper!

Absolutely delicious.  Deemed "my new favorite pie" by a very picky friend.  I thought it tasted like a blend between apple and cherry pie.  I will soon be famous for this pie. :)

Delicious!!  A coworker gave me a bag of home-grown plums that were starting to get soft.  I found the Purple Plum Pie and Flaky Pie Crust recipes on this site.  I quartered and pitted the small plums but left the peels intact, which gave the filling a texture like cherry pie.  Many were skeptical about the idea of plum pie, but all were impressed upon first taste.  Those coworkers offered to get me more plums so I could make another.  As a final note, I had never made a pie before this one.

After an abundant harvest I used a juicy 4 c of Victoria (I think?) plums which had been a little too long in the fridge and started to take on that fizzy taste... this made me very nervous about starring them in a pie but I had everything else prepped and so decided to give it a go, hoping that the alcohol would bake out.
Well anyway the pie was quite nice though I noticed that the way my fruit cooked it was a little more tart than expected (even though I neglected to add the lemon juice), and somewhat runnier than I prefer. It tasted very much like rhubarb, and I will treat these plums similarly in the future.

Very easy to make and absolutely wonderful.  I thawed out plums I had frozen and they worked just fine.  Also, I reduced the sugar in the filling to half of what was called for and it was perfect.

This pie was delicious and incredibly easy to make; it only took about 20 minutes total to prepare everything. Plums were a bit expensive so I used nectarines as well and it tasted great. The crumb topping was a bit powdery, but I think that because I didn't cut the butter in well enough. However, it still looked and tasted fantastic!

This is SO DELICIOUS!  I made it without a pie crust, and as I had plums that were on the sweet side, I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup in the filling.  What a great dessert!

Delicious! Perfect balance of sweet & tart. I made this once as written, using a pie crust, and once without the crust (so it was more like a crumble). It was equally delicious both ways! The only change I would recommend is using brown sugar instead of white for the topping. I also added a cup or so of blueberries, which gave it a really nice flavor.

This was a hit!
I used the butter flaky crust recipe on this site (which could have turned out a bit better, but it was my first time making it and I played with the dough for too long), and I bought the smaller italian plums, which are easier to slice, as the pit is free from the fruit, and are less juicy, which is good. I had to use half a stick of butter for the crumb topping, but otherwise the recipe was great! Will definitely do this one again.

Wonderful. Just the right balance of tartness and sweetness. We had some flavorless, overripe plums that I didn't want to toss, so I made this recipe. I'm so glad I did. The flavor reminds us of rhubarb crisp. Can't wait to warm it and serve with ice cream tomorrow.

Wow! This was amazing! I onl had to give it a four because it was really, really tart. I added 1/4 cup of brown sugar hoping that would sweeten it up. Either way, the flavors were great. It is heaven if you heat it up, and put a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. Pure bliss.

Awesome. If you love tart and sweet, this is the greatest. Add a little vanilla ice-cream and you have a fabulous dessert!

Simply amazing! This is such a wonder, olde fashioned pie. I added a bit of chopped mint fresh from the garden and it gave an extra special something. Everyone oooh'd and awwww'd!

Excellent pie. Not too sweet, and mildly tart. I omitted the lemon because I did not have it, and added an extra tablespoon of butter to the crumb topping. It tasted delicious, and was a great way to use up plums that no one wanted to eat. Of course, everyone wanted to eat the pie!

One of the best pies I've ever had!  I used limes instead of lemons because I love them.  This pie rocked my world.

This is the best pie I have ever had (and I used to work at a pie restaurant!)! It is also the first pie I have ever baked and it was so easy. I use the basic flaky pie crust recipe from this site (also great) and it held up so well. I didn't have enough plums so I added blueberries and blackberries to make it 4 cups of fruit. So good. So good. So good.

wow I really loved this pie! It tasted kinda like mcdonald's apple pies - except they were plum flavored yummy. I was looking for a way to get rid of plums and this worked out great. I used the basic flaky crust recipe from this website which turned out very nicely. It smells yummy while it's baking too!

We have lots of plums on our tree right now, and I was looking for a way to use some of them. No one in my family really likes to eat them plain.  WOW!!  Now I will look forward to the plums coming on each year.  This recipe is awesome.  My family members all declared it to be amazing.  I used a roll out pie crust from the refrigerated section at the store making the whole process real easy. Thanks for sharing!!

Nothing wrong with this, but I didn't think it was anything special.  The plum flavor didn't really pop; I almost felt as if that could have been any fruit underneath that topping!

Awesome! I skipped the bottom crust and made it more of a crisp. Subbed half brown sugar for white, added a touch more cinnamon and oatmeal. I also made 1 1/2 times the topping since I switched it from a pie to a crumble. Delicious!

What a lovely surprise!  Quick to make and delicious, especially with ice cream.  Next time I will skip the bottom crust so it is like a cobbler.  A huge hit with everyone.

I didn't have enough plums to fill the pie dish so I added a couple nectarines and a handful of blueberries to the mix.  It was excellent for desert and breakfast!

This was a super easy and super delicious recipe. I didn't have four cups of plums, so I used 1 1/2 cups of blueberries to make the four cups of fruit.  The topping was crunchy and tasty, and the filling was tasty without being overly sweet.

This recipe turned out superbly.  Using a sugared home made pastry raises the quality of the dish.  No changes needed in my opinion.  Perfect.

This was awesome! I did eliminate the pastry shell (didn't have it on hand) and used 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar for all sugar mixtures.  Loved this! Two of us ate the whole 9x13 pan in one evening! Will be making it again tomorrow night.

Our plum tree produced plums for the first time this year. I searched for a recipe and found this one with so many great reviews. I have to say it is absolutely delicious. I cut the first 2 pieces and gave them to my sister and her husband. Then I suggested we take the rest of the pie and go to my mother-in-laws to share with her. She put on a pot of coffee and we all enjoyed this wonderful pie. Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe. Decided to make it a cobbler and save on calories and fat. I have made this many times and like to add different fruits to the plum mixture. My favorite is dried cranberries - adds a tart kick to the sweetness. Have also used blueberries, cherries and golden raisins. Each was great! My neighbor has a prolific plum tree so this will be our go to favorite for years!

I had Greengage plums from the garden at work and I decided to use this recipe for them. Delicious. I'll definitely make it again but I think I'll be adding more crumble mixture on top as it was a little bit bare. It all fell apart too easily, although it was being eaten too fast for this to get noticed much!

This pie is simply amazing! I've never been a fan of eating plums off the tree because I'm not fond of the texture or the mess, but our plum tree yielded so many that they were going to waste! This recipe changed that! Thanks so much for such a creative pie!

This is superb!  I decreased sugar amounts in both the topping and filling to 1/4 c each and omitted the pie crust altogether, as another reviewer suggested.  Made a killer rhubarb-like crisp.  Tart and just sweet enough and I don't feel too guilty eating it.  Will make again next time I have plums beginning to turn into prunes.

Great recipe, but plums have a very bitter aftertaste.  I added some blueberries along with the plums to sweeten it up. I would make this recipe again, but with apples or blueberries, not plums.

We picked 2.5 gallons of plums off of our tree (unknown variety), and I thought this would be a great way to use them up. My plums were medium-small so I didn't use all of the skin to reduce the tart taste. The fresh plums tasted like candy but, unfortunately, the pie was still too tart for us. I used a 10 inch pan, and it was too big. Although I added extra flour and cooked the pie longer, I think that contributed to the pie being runny. I used the Basic Flaky Pie Crust recipe (rocks!). I can see how this recipe could taste yummy, and maybe the type of plums were the problem, but I won't make this again.

This is really easy and delicious.  I had too many plums that were waaay to sour, and this was the perfect way to use them.  I used 4 1/2 Tbs of butter because 3 was not enough.  The pie will be gone by the end of the day!

If you like a tart pie, then you will love love love this recipe.  I made it exactly as described.  I didn't peel my plums.  I had bought too many at Costco and this was the perfect solution to using up my plums.  I did use another person's suggestion and microwaved the plums with the sugar for 4 minutes.  It turned out perfectly.

My pie sank in the middle, needs more filling or crumb topping.  I chose to use firmer plums but it made the pie kind of sour, had to pair it with vanilla ice cream to balance it out.  Will make again, good way to use up plums from our plum tree.

Excellent!  This pie was soo good and so easy to make (I cheated and used store-bought crust but it saved lots of time)!  Fantastic way to use plums from our backyard tree so they don't go to waste.

Delicious!  I used two types of plums...the purple Italian ones and some small green ones.  The pie turned out great.  The only thing I did different from the recipe was omit the nutmeg but only because I didn't have any.  Thanks for an excellent recipe!  I'm going to try this one with a mixture of other fruits as well.
