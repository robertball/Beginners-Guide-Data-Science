This would be a much better recipe with a small, but important change, but I can only rate it two stars as written - I've made a baked mushroom recipe before and didn't care for the stewed, rather than roasted effect.  Mushrooms are already loaded with water and this recipe only compounds the problem by calling for even more water and then to cover the pan!  I changed the cooking method altogether, simply sauteing everything in a large skillet in a combination of butter and olive oil and NO water. Rather than Italian seasoning I used a handful of chopped fresh herbs at the end.  This version was so much better; a solid 4 stars, and a unique change from the sauted mushrooms I generally serve with our grilled steaks.

I made this for a dinner party the other night, and my guests really seemed to enjoy it.  Here's what I did: I left out the green pepper and added a couple of green onions instead.  I also left out the water at the suggestion of my fellow cooks and instead couldn't resist 2 small splashes of dry sherry instead.  I didn't see that the recipe said seasoned salt until I actually looked closer so I had cracked some fresh salt on them first then did a quick sprinkle of seasoned salt, still staying light on both so that guests could add their own.  I took another cook's suggestion and tossed the mushrooms a few times.  I also added some garlic and herb breadcrumbs during the last 10 minutes.  Since I kept it covered the whole time the breadcrumbs were really soft when I pulled out the dish after 45 minutes so I stirred the whole thing together.  It made a really nice sauce.  The mushrooms smelled heavenly before they were cooked and even better after.  I don't even like mushrooms, but they were so easy and smelled so wonderful that I wouldn't hesitate to make them again.  What an elegant dish!

Extremely easy recipe and very tasty too!!!  I do add a 1/4 cup of White Wine to the pan, it seems to bring out a little more of the mushrooms flavors.  Not really a dish for kids unless they enjoy mushrooms!

Thank goodness I halved the recipe, I couldn't stop eating these! I used green onion, dried parsley, doubled the garlic & seasonings, used white wine instead of water & didn't have any green pepper.  So much for following the recipe, but it turned out great!

This is very flavorful, but next time I make it I'll omit the water. It came out way too juicy! I drained a whole cup of liquid off of it.  I added dried Italian bread crumbs on top during the last 10 minutes of baking.

really good, I will make this again. Everyone I had for dinner loved them. I followed some suggestions of others and added more garlic, a little less onion and green pepper and no water. The mushrooms had enough water in them. I also tossed them twice throughout the cooking time and they turned out great.

These WERE FANTASTIC!! ~ I'm SO GLAD I OMITTED THE WATER! ~ Also, it occurred to me the recipe does NOT SAY COVERED, and reading the reviews, seems most people covered it.  This might be why the EXTRA WATER, etc. comments.  I sorta covered it (not knowing what to expect), and checked it 1/2 way thru...probably could've been uncovered the entire time ~ Be sure and add LOTS more seasonings and/or salt. (I used Essence and Garlic Pepper Seasoning). I also omitted the bell peppers and used green onions.  These were EXACTLY what I was looking for with my baked chicken :))  Thank you Gail!!  WILL DEFINITELY MAKE AGAIN!!

Very tasty and a great way to use up mushrooms.  I did substitute the fresh parsley and used dried.

This is a delicious and easy way to prepare mushrooms.  I omitted the water, as many here have suggested, and the "jucies" came out perfectly.  I also added extra garlic, because I add extra garlic to everything!  

This tastes great over egg noodles, and makes a speedy meal.  The only thing I will change next time (and there will be a next time, for sure!) is to omit the green pepper.  It adds a lot to your prep time, but because of the seasonings, garlic, etc., you can't even taste the pepper.  So why spend the time?

I doubled the recipe except for the onion and green pepper. It was watery, no problem, I just drained it off. Delicious and easy for Xmas dinner w/ beef fillet.

I agree with other reviewers, that this had too much liquid. I mixed some cornstarch with some of the liquid and mixed that into the whole thing to thicken it, instead of throwing the yummy sauce out. Also, i added a little mozzarella cheese and parmesan cheese. This made it all bind together. I left out the green pepper, and i don't think it missed it. Right before serving i mixed in some raw chopped spinach, letting it wilt enough so it was soft but not soggy. That was my favorite part of the dish, actually. Instead of the water, i put in cooking sherry, and left the cover off almost the entire time. What i ended up with was a very rich meal that i served with cornbread. I'm going to work on this to make it better. Very good base recipe, you can add practically anything to it.Very good the next day.

Don't use ANY extra water, the mushrooms will excrete water too.  I go a bit heavy on the garlic and it seems to be a bit more savory, with a great flavor.  If you don't have the fresh parsley it is okay to skip too, it seems the same but the parsley makes a nice color queue for guests.

As others, I did not add water and uncovered mushrooms part way through the baking period.  Preparation was very quick and easy.  Although good, the final outcome was rather flat tasting.  It definitely needs some additional seasoning.

Tasty! I used a mix of crimini and button mushrooms. Also, I didn't have any green pepper on hand, but I did have a zucchini, so I used that. I subbed extra virgin olive oil for the butter and only baked it half the time with the cover on and then removed it for the remainder, stirring every so often. I added a lot more garlic and seasonings than called for (to suit our tastes). These were really good! I would totally make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I found this dish pretty bland. I followed all the directions, but I didn't have Italian seasoning so I just used a little oregano, thyme, salt, and pepper in its place. I also poured a little white wine into the pan before baking. They just tasted like ordinary sauteed mushrooms to me. Even cooking them with rice the next day didn't seem to liven them up much.

I made a few alterations and it turned out perfectly!  I used portabellas that I am growing in my house (fun!) and just sliced them in thick chunks.  Threw two boneless/skinless chicken breasts in with them.  Sliced the onion (not diced) and then drizzled the entire thing with some garlic infused oil I had made (instead of butter).  Omitted the water entirely, as other readers suggested and it made just enough juice to use as a sauce for my brown rice.  Also left out the bell pepper and didn't miss it!  YUMMY!  Loved it!

This is a fanstatic recipes. It was a huge hit at a family dinner. I made one great change, I drained the excess water after mushroom were done then I put 1 cup of Mozzorella cheese on top and baked until cheese melted.

I love mushrooms and thought this would be a great addition to the grilled pork tenderloin I was serving but these were awful! I left out the water and green peppers.  When they were done cooking I tasted them and kept adding more seasoning and garlic salt until I liked them. These definitely needed some doctoring up!

This has a fantastic flavor, one of my favorite mushroom recipes.  I don't like chunks of onions, so I used 1 1/2 tsp of onion powder instead, and it turned out great.  Also, when scaling the recipe to 2 servings, I only had to cook for about 25-30 minutes.

I used three different kinds of mushrooms, which gave it added flavor.  I also served shaved parmesan cheese separately to sprinkle on top.

I prepared this recipe as is, and it is both flavorful and a perfect compliment to any protein dish. Great vegetarian side if you omit the butter. I will definitely be making this again.

My family loved this recipe. I used red, green, and orange peppers and they gave it extra favorite. I have also made it on the stove exactly the same way. It also came out great. Thank you for the recipe.

These taste like the ones I do in foil packets on the bbq but they were watery. Next time I will omit the water. Still really good.

Although this was very quick and easy, it was also very, very bland. I doubled the garlic and italian season, but it needed something more.

These were wonderful.  I followed the suggestion of some previous reviewers and substituted white wine for the water.  Instead of draining the considerable amount of liquid these produced, I put them on top of the stove over a high flame and reduced the liquid--it made a great sauce.

Received rave reviews from my dinner guests! I doubled the mushrooms and seasonings and garlic, but stuck to one green pepper and I think two green onions. Subbed white cooking wine for water (it did have a lot of "sauce") and olive oil instead of butter. I stirred a few times during baking as per other reviews and I sprinkled some whole wheat breadcrumbs on top near the end of baking. They're delicious as a topping or as a solo dish!

This was super easy and really tasty!  I used other reviewer's suggestions and subbed the water for Chardonnay and added italian breadcrumbs on top near the end of cooking.  The breadcrumbs didn't brown much but did make a good sauce when mixed in.

I read all of the reviews about this recipe so I made some alterations to it and it turned out fantastic! I devoured it! The only reason I am giving it a 4 is because I changed so much. Here is what I did: Baby Bellas halved, onions (1 medium yellow) sliced, red and yellow bell peppers (2) chunked, 1/4 c white wine, 1 tbls minced garlic, 4 tbls melted butter, garlic powder, salt, lots of pepper, some lemon pepper seasoning, parsley, baked uncovered at 350 for 40 minutes. It looked delicious (though I wish I had put more mushrooms b/c they cooked down so much) and there was some liquid but it was good! And I drizzled it on some brown rice that I had with it. This recipe is definitely made to my liking (i love pepper and garlic!) but anyone can change it to how they like so it's a really good base. Enjoyed very much! And very low in calories! Especially if you use a light margarine instead of butter but then it wouldn't taste as good :)

This was a fine side dish.  As suggested, I omitted the water and used half of the butter.  It was nice when company was coming, that you could get it ready ahead of time (up to the melted butter) and then just pop it in the oven to cook before serving.

My husband and I both enjoyed this - and he is not a veggie eater.  I added more garlic and red pepper than the recipe called for and omitted the water.  I also uncovered the dish for the last 15 minutes, which dried up some of the liquid.  Then, I placed the leftovers in the same container as some left over pasta (juice and all) and that was fabulous the next day.  Next time I think I will try this recipe with a little lemon pepper.

Nice side dish with Lasagna.  There was too mucb liquid in the dish.  I would have poured it off, but I thought it might stay warmer on the buffet table.  With the sauce making it look a little scary...not as many people tried the dish.  Not the greatest presentation in the cooking dish.  Looks better on the plate.  I added one green pepper and one red pepper and made a double batch for holidays.  I would make it again.

2Tbl butter
1tsp bals vin

This was also easy to clean up since the mushrooms didn't stick.

Mushrooms were whole, which I didn't mind but I would cut them if serving to others so they'd cook more evenly.

Topped with mozzarella. Mustard and hot sauce were good condiments.

Not a ton of flavor with the ingredients suggested.   I would probably double the seasoned salt if I make it again.  Volume shrank a lot.   Hard to see how this makes 6 servings unless it's served as a side.

I love mushrooms and these were no exception.  Very good and very easy!  I did make a few changes though.  I didn't use bell pepper, but added two chopped green onions.  I didn't add water (cause mushrooms are very wet to begin with) or parsley, but it wasn't missed.  I also cut the onion in half and add another clove of garlic and twice the seasoning salt and Italian seasoning.  I will for sure make this again.

Easy dish to make.  We enjoyed it as a side, but felt it could use a bit more flavour.

The recipe was very good. I did make a few changes: I did not add water and I did not cover. I will reduce the onion to only half the next time. I also used baby portabella.

If you like mushrooms, you will love this recipe. I followed the directions exactly, only leaving out the water. Cook uncovered for the entire duration, and there's still more than enough moisture from all the ingredients, but not too soupy. Enjoy!

These were good.  I omitted the water as some other reviewers suggested.  I thought they were a little bland, so I will definitely add additional spices next time. I think they tasted better the second day and they warmed up well.

I loved this recipe, its so simple yet so tasty, The only thing i did different was i added some fresh cream in the place of water and right at the end i added some cheese to give it a creamy taste. I think even without the green peppers this recipe will work, you can add yellow bell pepper like i did. Thanks for this awesome recipe.

I substituted canned mushroom (I didn'y have fresh ones on hand)and used red, orange and yellow peppers in place of the green peppers to add some color. I also sauteed the vegetables on the stove top - and removed them after 5 miutes - so they would be tender-crisp.Very good!

This is such a good recipe--with a few changes.  I replaced the green bell pepper with diced red bell pepper, added a zucchini, and used red onion. I added a few pinches of crushed red pepper, doubled the garlic (or tripled!--my fiancé and I love garlic!), doubled the Italian seasoning, added a few sprinkles of rosemary and replaced the seasoning salt with half the amount of regular salt (didn't have seasoning salt).  Also, I omitted the water, added a few splashes of the pinot noir we were having with dinner, and used three to four tablespoons of light butter.  For four servings, I baked the dish for approximately 30-35 minutes and cooked covered for the first 15.  There was a bit more liquid than I cared for, so I believe I will leave it uncovered the next time.

I used half red and half green peppers. Also, added 1/2 a yellow and zucchini squash. Boy, was it pretty! It looked like something at gourmet restaurant and tasted good, too. Thanks for the great recipe!

I love mushrooms so this was pretty good. I used white onions because I had them on hand but I'll probaby use red next time. I also omitted the butter because I'm watching what I eat but it came out fine.

Thanx for a quick and easy recipe but truth be told, I wasn't too crazy about the results.  Too watery & not very tasty.  I was hoping that the flavor would makes it's debut the next day, but that wasn't the case unfortunately.  On the plus side, my whole kitchen smelled yummy.

I didn't like this recipe very much, but my sister-in-law loved it. She said the parsley added huge flavor to it. So I guess it's a matter of taste.

This sounded terrific, but I also experienced a very watery end product. The flavor was OK, but nothing special and it did not look great in the bowl.

If you follow this to the t, it is excellent!  The vegetables had the right degree of cooking time, they weren't too soggy or crisp for that matter.  Excellent, and to think that so few herbs and ingredients could yield something so simply tasty..you have to try it!

This was absolutely wonderful.  I forgot the garlic, and it was still wonderful.
