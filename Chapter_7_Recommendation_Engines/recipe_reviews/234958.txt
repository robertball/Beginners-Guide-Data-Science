Thought I would try this since I have a ton of leftover Halloween candy. Followed the recipe exactly, but doubled it and put in a 9x16 pan. Came out perfectly!  I used Reese's pieces, Reese's peanut butter cups, Almond Joys, KitKats, and Hershey bars so there was quite a variety of chocolate and crunch.  I still have mega-amounts of candy left so I'm planning to make another pan (or two) and just put in the freezer for unexpected company.  Thanks for the great idea!

This is a creative idea to use up some of that Halloween candy!  And it's great for sharing with others!  The recipe was easy to follow, and my children (ages 5 & 2) were able to participate in every step.  They especially enjoyed picking out the candies.  Instead of mixing in the candies, we placed them on top of the batter before baking.  Super yummy!

I think it's more of a cookie bar than a brownie.  Delicious!  I used Twix.  Great recipe!

I thought they tasted really good but next time ill either use less candy or make more dough. You can taste all of the candy inside. I uploaded the picture they came out kinda ugly but tasted great.

I followed the receipt (except for the vanilla) and used up 24 leftover mini-candy bars.  Pleased with result!  Batch is very sweet, which family loves, but I may try tweaking a batch for myself to dial back the sweetness a tad.

I went to make this and realized I didn't have as much candy as I thought, so I added butterscotch chips to equal the amount of  total candy in the recipe.    I did a 1 1/2 X recipe, and put in a 9x11 glass pan.  Turned out great!

I just used a mixture of candy that came out to 2 cups. It came out well and I will use this again!

I made these, but for some reason, the actual brownie part was vanilla, so it was vanilla brownies with chocolate chunks.  They didn't really turn out the way I hoped.

I made this using 1/2 cup M&M's, 1/2 cup Milky Way, and 1/2 cup KitKat. I used an 8 inch pan and baked for 28 minutes. It was pretty good! Definitely a nice way to use up extra candy. I'm looking forward to trying out different types of candy bars in it. I personally didn't care much for the 'crunch' that came out of the KitKat so I'll avoid anything crunchy from now on as a personal preference.
