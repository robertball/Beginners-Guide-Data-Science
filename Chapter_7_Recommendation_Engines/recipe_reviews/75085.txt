This was really good! I'm a huge salmon fan but not the biggest avacado fan, but the two went really well together! I grilled the mushrooms with red onions instead of sauteing them with butter to save on fat. I also used Cilantro only, subsituted baby spinach for lettice, and added green olives.  I highly recommend.

This was so delicious! The only changes I made were I omitted the mushrooms, used a baby greens salad mix, and used red wine vinegar instead of white vinegar. This was very fast to prepare and the flavors went together very well. I can't wait to make it again. Thank you for a great recipe!

This was a great salad.  It had a great taste, I really liked how the avocado complemented the other ingredients.  With my changes it was a bit different from the original recipe - I omitted cilantro and jalapeno (I didn't have them) and instead of adding feta and a vinegar sauce, I added a honey dijon sauce (1 part butter, 1 part dijon mustard and 2 parts honey - like what is used for the baked dijon salmon recipe on this site).  It was fantastic like this!

I left out the mushrooms and jalapeno, used  roma tomato (and more of it),  and substituted lemon juice for the vinegar. I already loved combining salmon and avocado.  The cilantro and feta were interesting and tasty additions.  I am sure I will make this again, perhaps with the mushrooms next time (I didn't have any on hand.)

This salad was very good.  I used red onion instead of the mushrooms.  I did not use the vinegar but used lemon juice with the olive oil.  I also did not combine the lettuce and instead just plated it.  The salmon was still warm when I added it to the bowl so next time I will cook the salmon ahead of time.  It may be even better if it all melds in the fridge for awhile.  Will make this again.  Yummo!

Pretty good, but I added another big  tomato and used pickled Jalapenos (about 2 TBSP)instead of fresh because my fresh ones are still on the vine. My avocado was a big one also. Put a bunch of arugula in with the lettuce to give it a more peppery flavor as well.  Will make again!

Not bad, but I wasn't keen on the mushrooms with the other flavors. Also, I used white balsamic instead of distilled white vinegar as I find the latter way too tart. If I were to make this again, I would throw in some red onion and maybe even some sweetcorn kernels. Thanks, Dena!

Very tasty and very easy!  I added shredded carrots for extra nutrients, but didn't have mushrooms to add.  I only used half a fresh jalapeno and that was enough.  My husband said it added "just enough" surprise to his tastebuds!  I liked the oil & vinegar dressing because it makes it lower caloried, but if I had fresh mangos I would add some to this salad.  The mango would help take the bite out of the jalapenos.   I'll will make this one again.  Thanks!

This was a great inspiration recipe for me and I have to admit I made several changes.  I eat salmon at least 3 times a week, and usually bake or grill it.  I  never use oil with it, as it is an oily fish to begin with.  This time I decided to poach the fish using 1/2 c water, 1/2 wine, some sliced onion & tarragon.  Only took 5 minutes and poaching leaves NO fishy odor in the house.  I made my salad bed with romaine lettuce and added fresh mushrooms (why saute them?), avocado, and grape tomatoes.  (Had no feta or would have it it too)To save time, I used a little of  Paul Newman's Lite Honey Mustard Dressing.  Wow! What a fantastic salad.  Next time I think I'll add some red pepper and a handful of blueberries.

Everybody loved this salad! I wasn't too sure about putting in the fresh jalapenos, so I put them on the side for those who wanted to try. I really liked the added kick. Thank you!

We really enjoyed this as a base recipe, which I modified both to make healthier and based on our tastes. We steamed the salmon and then put a little salt, pepper, and olive oil on it. Left out the mushrooms. Used mixed greens instead of lettuce and left out the cilantro, jalapeno, and feta. Instead of the vinegar, I subbed lemon juice, and I added some chopped green onions. It turned out light, flavorful, and oh so healthy.

The family loved this one.  It was so pretty that my husband actually took a picture of it, will make sure he uploads it to show. I nixed the feta and added bacon, it was a huge hit!!

We just tried this one and it turned out pretty good. I followed the suggestion of adding onions to the mushroom and I also throwed in some finely chopped leek.

Did't have jalape√±os this time, but will make again soon with all the ingredients.

Perfect for a summer dinner.

This was good, but I wasn't too keen on the  salmon/avocado combo. I'd prefer chicken instead, with a splash of lime juice as well.

This salad was top-notch! I made it for lunch the other day, and could not resist gobbling it all up because it was simply melt in your mouth delicious. I broiled the salmon, adding a bit of lemon pepper seasoning to it (the no-salt kind), and went without the avocado because I didn't have any. This recipe blew my mouth out of the water. I loved the texture, especially the combination of the salad greens with the tang of the torn cilantro. Excellent, quick, divine meal!

Wow! This salad is really tasty. The only thing I changed was to add some some green onions to the mushrooms but this recipe would be perfect as is.

Delicious!  We had some chilled King Salmon that we had grilled the night before---perfect!  I doubled the mushrooms (used Crimini) and used a 5 ounce bag of Organic Herb Salad mix from Trader Joe's.  I whisked the olive oil and white wine vinegar in a small bowl before adding it to the salad.  Yum!!

We're big salmon fans in my house so this was a great addition to my recipe collection.  I did make a few tweaks though inlcuding leaving out the vinegar, using red onions with the mushrooms instead of butter and a couple spritzes of 'fake' butter spray instead of brushing the salmon with melted butter in an effort to reduce the fat content.  It was delicious!!!

This salad is a great summer dish. Its a warm salad but not hot. I really enjoyed it. The only change I made was to leave out the cilantro and add some fresh snipped parsley. I forgot to add the feta at the end but it was still great.

Made a great lunch for my husband.  I used canned salmon and prepared guacamole and it was still delicious.  I will try it with fresh salmon next.

This was really good.  I made some additions and substitutions: lemon juice in place of vinegar, and dressed it with a little Paul Newman Honey mustard dressing.  I served it cold, as it was a really hot night... Will make this again!

This was an excellent dish! I followed the recipe fairly closely, except went a little heavier on the salmon (probably 10oz) and used red wine vinegar instead of white vinegar. My finance said this is now her favorite salad, period. We will definitely make this again!

Very Yummy! My husband loves Salmon and I fixed this for his birthday dinner exactly as the recipe said, and he told me that he thought this was by far one of the best meals I ever made for him...definitely a keeper!  I loved it as well and wouldn't change a thing.  It was easy and on the dinner table quick.

Very Good. i will make it again. I used raw mushrooms instead of cooked, canned salmon instead of fresh (that's all I had), lemon juice instead of vinegar, and I omitted the oil. If I were to make it again, I would add more tomatoes and maybe some sunflower seeds for crunch.

Loved this!  I broiled the salmon without butter and then followed the recipe exactly.  I ate it for lunch the next day and it was excellent and filling.

I really liked this one. I used cut up regular tomatoes rather than grape tomatoes, red-wine vinegar rather than white, and dispensed with the jalapeno pepper. 

I would caution that the salmon may get overcooked at 15 minutes, so check it earlier. 

The mixture had a surprisingly melded, almost woodsy flavor. Looking back, I do wish I had put in that jalapeno pepper, but it was great as it was!
