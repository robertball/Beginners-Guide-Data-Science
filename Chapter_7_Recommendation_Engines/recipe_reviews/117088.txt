This soup is incredible!  I was doubtful because of the few ingredients.  My 4 year-old said, "YUM!  What's in here?"   I only used 8 oz of salsa. I added 8oz of chicken broth.  I served it with grated cheese to sprinkle on top and Triscuit crackers.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!  UPDATE:  I made this again (a few times) and used on 10oz package of frozen spinach added at the end.  I add it frozen and wait for it to thaw in the soup.  Delicious!

Awesome!  Didn't have salsa so I substituted diced tomatoes w/herbs & spices.  I added some chili powder, cumin & garlic.  So yummy!

Out of this world good!!!  I'm on Weight Watchers and this was LOW points!- 1 added 6 oz of canadian bacon while it was cooking and ate it with 1 tbsp of plain yogurt on it- DELISH!  Dh said it was the best lentil soup he ever had (and he's not a fan of lentil soup! It was a coup just to get him to eat it!)  YUM!  Thanks!!

Excellent especially for something so healthy. I added approximately 1.5 times the spinach and it was still very good. Do not add the spinach until just before you plan to serve. It turns dark green/brown when stored. After first made, it is a beautiful-healthy-looking grass green.

This soup is unbelievably good! Especially considering how healthy it is. I'm doing Weight Watchers and this recipe is virtually 0 points because of its high fiber content.

This is the first time I've rated anything. This recipe is so great. I used a hot chipotle salsa (can I name brands?? Rick Bayless/Frontera) and also added yams. It's so hearty, easy and spicy. I will be making this a lot during the cold winter months. Thanks so much for sharing!

This was wonderful! Best lentil soup I have ever had - I don't even really like lentils!

 I deviated from the instructions a bit by adding a couple cups of barley in with the lentils, three chicken breasts cubed, two garlic cloves, a 1/4 head of cabbage, a couple handfuls of green beans and chopped the carrots instead of grating them. My pot was nearly overflowing but I will be enjoying this for lunch and dinner all this next week.

My son is allergic to dairy and we have the hardest time getting any protein into him.  This recipe was great.  My husband and I loved it and my son did too.  Apart from being good for you it's just "good".

I absolutely loved this soup.  Thick, interesting flavor, used lentils, and didn't take too long to cook.  On the other hand my hubby hated it.  He kept saying that it had some spice he didn't like (and I know he likes all the ingredients). Strange.  
    I made a few changes.  Chopped the carrots--it was easier.  Discovered I only had a cup of lentils so I substituted a quarter cup of pearled barley.  Also didn't put in quite the whole package of spinach.  May I repeat--I loved it. Will make again when Hubby isn't home.

I was looking for something to pair lentils and spinach. This worked quite well. I took some tips from others and added spices and garlic. I used chicken broth instead of water. Turned out really well.

We absolutely loved this soup.  I used broth to up the nutritional value and squeezed the juice of a lemon into the pot.  An easy, healthy soup on days when you don't feel like cooking.

This was good and healthy.  I chopped the carrots instead of shredding them.  I didn't have any salsa so I added 2 medium fresh tomatoes, about a teaspoon of cayenne pepper and about 2 tablespoons of tomato paste.  This came out perfect!

Loved this soup, just made a few changes. Chopped the carrots and added some minced garlic when I sauteed the veggies. Used a can of tomatoes, can of mushrooms and some bay leaves, basil and red and black pepper to give it some spice. Big hit with my hubby and me!! Topped it with shredded parmesan and some garlic bread.....SO good!!!!

Very good recipe, so simple. I would reduce the suggested cooking time though or else you'll end up with mush. Also, the spinach cooks in 1 minute, not 10,

Spicy and good.  I used Pace medium salsa.  I reduced the amount of spinach to 8 ounces and added some nitrate and nitrite free canadian bacon which I chopped and added to the end of sauteing the onions and carrots.  I topped each bowl of soup with a dollop of reduced fat sour cream.

this was very good, though I *did* make changes.  I used a mix of vegetable broth & water.  I added cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, and fresh garlic too.  At the end, i added fresh cilantro & lemon juice (1 Tbsp) along with the spinach, and served with a dollap of plain yogurt, on top of basmatic rice.  It was healthy & very tasty.

Delicious lentil soup!  We really enjoyed the flavors of this super easy soup recipe.  I used a 10 oz. package of frozen spinach as I didn't have any fresh on hand and it was still very tasty!  Will definitely use fresh next time as I'm sure it will be even better.  I used 4 cups water and 2 cups chicken broth but I don't think that was necessary.  It's important to pick a mild or medium salsa that you really like as the salsa flavor may be a little strong and may turn you off otherwise.  Ours was perfect and we thoroughly enjoyed this soup with a loaf of handmade italian bread.  Perfect healthy dinner!  Thank you for the recipe!

I have only made this soup with a few modifications, and everyone in my house absolutely loved it. I added less salsa and instead added three freshly cut tomatoes.. I cooked the vegetables with three cloves of garlic and added cayenne pepper, fresh ground pepper, and curry powder to the soup. Next time I would chop the carrots instead of shred them. Overall, it made a very flavorful and healthy soup and I will do it again.

Love this soup!  I chopped carrots and added chopped celery and minced garlic.  I sauteed it in canola oil, although olive oil would have been fine.  I also used vegetable broth instead of water.  I doubled the recipe by using a 16 oz. bag of lentils & added a 6 oz. bag of fresh baby spinach at the end.  I figure if I'm going to do all the work, I might as well make a big batch & freeze it in individual serving containers.  What I would strongly suggest is to add LESS salsa.  You can always add more to suit your taste.  For a double batch, I used one and a quarter cup of medium salsa & this just added enough tang for my family.  Someone else might like it spicier.

Very tastey. Used salsa verde instead of regular salsa because that was what we had on hand. Added some fresh garlic, cayenne, cumin & garlic powder as well. The taste was fresh and.....well....healthy. But also just plain good. A nice way to have a good for you meal that you can truly enjoy. And the hubby LOVED it!

This soup was so good, and really easy to make.  Pretty cheap too.  I followed the recipe, but subsituted and added where needed.  I didn't have carrots, so I used red bell pepper.  I also had some leftover cabbage, and added maybe a cup and a half, chopped.  The cabbage was the yummiest addition, since it's got a nice texture.  I will add more cabbage next time.  Also, about halfway through the simmering phase, I added two jalapeno chicken sausages from Trader Joe's, chopped.  I used frozen leaf spinach, maybe a cup.  Also, in addition to the 6 cups of water, I probably added at least 3 additional cups of water throughout, maybe since I added a lot more stuff.  So yummy, and very highly recommended!

I loath lentils, but this was good.  I was scraping the bottom of my salsa jar and wasn't able to come up with but perhaps a half cup.  Topped with a little parm cheese and did my body good for the day.  Will make again.  Also, for those watching their calories, carbs, etc - recipe yielded 6 cups or servings.  The *Nutritional Analysis* at the bottom of recipe says it is based on 1 1/2 cups as a serving (or a total of 9 cups) - not that it makes a huge difference, just an FYI in case your're hungry and want to eat more :)

Yummy!  I have made this several times these past few weeks, and love it!  I added a few stalks of celery, and really liked the flavor it added.  I also added chili powder and cumin to bump up the flavor, and omitted the salt because of the salsa.  Definitely a keeper.

Added a bouillon cube as a user mentioned using broth instead of water. Didn't add salt. very good. Might be better with broth, but don't think that the soup needed it to be good with all of the other flavors. Simple and fairly healthy.

I wasn't sure how all these ingredients would come together, but I loved this soup (and how easy it was to make)! It's even pretty healthy. I only put in half a jar of salsa and replaced a cup of the water with veggie broth. I will so make this again during the upcoming winter!

I'm normally not into soup, but this recipe is so delicious and healthy! I make it ALL the time. Started adding some potato at the suggestion of my meat-eating roommate and now he loves it too!

Tasty and easy to adapt for low sodium!  I omitted salt and used tomatillos, green chilies, red bell pepper, garlic powder, and black pepper in place of salsa.  My vegetables were a little overcooked in an hour for my taste, so I will reduce cooking time next time.  Thanks!

I loved it, family didn't, but that didn't suprise me.  Sour cream or yogurt on top adds depth.  I served mine over leftover rice for additional texture and that is how it is preferred by my family.  I think it would be great over noodles as well.

Excellent Lentil Soup.  I am currently doing the Standard Process Purification program so with some minor changes this made a perfect soup for me to be able to have.  I did not use the jar of salsa but instead substituted (as another reviewer suggested) with tomatoes, cumin, garlic and pepper.  My husband added some salsa to his lentils and said it was good.  My 7 yr old daughter ate three small bowls!

Loved it! It's easy to make, nutritious and tastes great. The only changes made, based on other reviews, were sauteing some garlic in addition to the onions, using chicken stock instead of water and adding some cumin. Definitely a keeper.

Very delicious soup. Instead of 6 cups of water I used 4 cups of chicken broth and 2 cups of water. In this case use less salt as the broth has enough salt in it anyway. Otherwise excellent. Will certainly make it again.

It was okay nothing too amazing and I think it would've been pretty bland had I not added cumin, chili powder, and garlic. I also thought there was way too much spinach...I'd half the amount.

This is a fabulous recipe! I was looking for something easy with not too many ingredients and it was perfect. I followed the directions to the T only adding a little oregano and 2 garlic cloves for more flavor. I also used Pace Picanted salsa and went for the HOT one because we love spicy food. My husband took some for lunch and sent me a msg that this soup better be a part of our everyday meals! I guess it's safe to say he loved it :)

I have never been a fan of lentil soup. On Friday night I followed this recipe exactly using medium salsa. Directly after making the soup it tasted bland to me. Dissapointed in my cooking ability, on Sunday afternoon I decided to freeze the rest assuming no one, but me, would eat the rest. Sunday my husband suggested we have this soup for dinner. With trepidaton I pulled out a freezer bag, luckily it was not yet frozen, and served it for dinner. I had warned everyone, so both teenage boys tried one ladel full. For me it was like eating a new soup because the flavors had time to settle in since Friday night and I was actually enjoying it. I was shocked to see both boys going back for more with no prompting by me :) Fabulous! Everyone thought it was hearty and very good. Now we can all enjoy lentil soup. We also had Miller's Bake House sesame seed bread (organic whole grain wood fire-baked) from Chico's Farmer's Market along with Earth Balance buttery spread and a tossed salad. Wonderful healthy vegan meal. We are not vegan and this meal requires nothing more. Easy, hearty, excellent taste and healthy too. Thank you Sally!

I made this soup tonight and it was fabulous! I made some alterations, however I don't believe it changed the flavor of the original recipe. I added an additional 1/2 cup of carrots - I used matchstick (next time I may use more since I love carrots in the soup). Also, the jar of salsa I used was medium spice and was 24oz rather than 16 - I didn't want to keep the left over salsa so I threw it all in. WONDERFUL flavor... this is a keeper for me!

Great soup!  After sauteing the onion and carrot I threw everything in the slow cooker because I was going to be out for the day.  Perfect.  I will be making this again.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

Very easy and tasty.  I shredded the carrots in the food processor, and added 4 cups of chicken broth instead of water for added flavor.   I also added 2 1/2 c more water since I like my lentils more soupy, added a tiny bit of ground cumin and let it simmer for probably an additional 45 minutes since I like my lentils extra soft. In the future I may add some chopped bacon for another dimension of flavor, and maybe omitting the spinach and adding cilantro instead.  Garbanzos or small noodles I think would also make it more appealing to my children.   This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I made this for my husband, since we're trying to keep his weight down.  It is very healthy, and I was very surprised by the flavor imparted by just the ingredients with no additional spices.  I added mushrooms and a small amount of ground turkey that I first seasoned with some salt, peppper, and some chopped garlic.  I deinitely recommend this recipe.

I didn't have onions so I cooked the carrots with minced garlic instead. My carrots also should've been thrown away and not eaten and this recipe was still AMAZING!

I LOVE THIS SOUP!!!!
I tried spinach lentil soup for the first time last week oddly enough at a hospital cafeteria 
and i loved it!!!

I found this simple recipe and it is perfect!
Next time I'll add 9 cups of water because there wasn't enough broth for my taste 

This recipe impressed me so much!!!
I will make again!!

This is a new staple in our house!  I skipped the onion, oil, and salt as the salsa has enough flavor.  I used ChiChi's medium salsa and blended it first.  I have made it with water as instructed but have also substituted part of the water with vegetable broth.  It's also pretty tasty if you add a little chopped up turkey sausage.  I swear I could eat this almost everyday...and no guilt!

Easy to make and very tasty.  I used a can of diced tomatoes with seasoning instead of the salsa.  It was thick, not soupy, but that's the way I like it.  If you want a more brothy soup, add more water.  My lentils were tender in about 35 minutes.  This was my first time trying lentils, I really like this.  You can beat the price either!!  I'm trying eat less meat (organic, grass fed is just too expensive), so I was looking for alternate sources of protein.  Lentils have lots of fiber and protein.  $1.99 per pound for organic green lentils from the bulk bin at my grocery store.  This recipe is definitely going to be a regular part of my diet!

Super easy, delicious and nutritious! Perfect for a rainy Sunday afternoon. I served with cornbread and it was wonderful. I followed directions exactly (except I had extra cup of dried lentils so I tossed them in too. Next time I'll experiment with adding other vegetables as suggested by others. Soup was great as written.

This soup is fabulous...I pureed the spinach instead of throwing it in torn and I did not shred the carrots but rather cut them into small pieces. Other than that it was really tasty and quite hearty. I would definitely recommend it!

Excellent!  I wanted to use up my package of shredded carrots and found this in a search.  I was hesitant to add a whole jar of salsa, so only used half, but next time will add more.  I also added some chicken and used 1 can of vegetable broth and 4 cups water, and used frozen spinach.  Paired it with the Basic Buttermillk Corn Bread also on this site.  Just excellent - thanks.

My brother & I (both meat-eaters) liked the soup. My daughter (the vegetarian) thought it was bland. We added a couple cloves of minced garlic to it. The soup smelled amazing while cooking. I thought it was good. I think a bit of hominy would have added some texture and I would like to try adding a bit of smoked turkey next time. And maybe some collared greens instead of spinach.

Very good!  Even my 4 year old loved it!  I was afraid it would be too thick but it ended up being just right.  I used 1/2 mild and 1/2 medium salsa because that is what I had on hand.  I also omitted the salt (plenty of salt in the salsa!) and it was fine without.

This was heartier than me or my husband imagined!  I added cummin, substituted a can of chicken broth for two cups of water, added garlic when I sauted the onions and carrots, and also added oregano and cayenne pepper for spicy-ness.  Used 16oz of frozen spinach and it turned out GREAT!!

This soup is not only great for your waistline, but also your wallet!  I have also made using frozen (defrosted and drained of liquid) spinach with good results.  I have never been a big fan of lentil soup, but this easy recipe will be made time and time again.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I have made this several times now and it is loved by all. Took to a party (forgot the spinach leaves at the end) and friends thought it was a whole new recipe. Those that said they did not like Lentils went back for more! The best batches are made with FRESH salsa (home made or store bought). But even  shelf friendly Pace works in a pinch. Definitely add this to your Recipe Box!

Really tasty!  I used frozen spinach (added the last 10 min of cooking), didn't have the meat so made it veggie and was great!  Oh, and I also added a squirt of lemon to every bowl as it was served.  Everyone loved it - even my sometimes picky 3 yr old!  Thank you for a great recipe!

I used chicken broth instead of water and didn't have salsa so I pureed a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes instead. I added about 1/2 tbsp cumin, 3/4 tbsp garlic powder, 1 tsp chili powder, and salted and peppered the carrots and onions while they were sauteeing. SOOOOO good!

I love spinach and lentils so I thought a marriage of the two would be great...not so. There are a lot of better lentil recipes out there, keep searching. I won't be making this one again.

I'm giving 5 stars because it's easy, inexpensive, tasty, and uses things I keep around the house. I used half broth, half water, just in case. And I used fancy salsa the second time but didn't notice a difference.  I'll stick with the standard (cheaper!) stuff next time.

This was easy to make and I felt healthy eating it, but it was pretty bland.  I added a lot of cumin but I couldn't taste it.  Next time I will saute a lot of garlic with the onion and maybe use chicken stock instead of water.  I used fresh and frozen spinach and they both work really well in the recipe.  It's a good way to use up frozen spinach without going through that annoying step of thawing and squeezing out water; you just throw the icy block in the soup.  Next time I'll also chop the carrots, their flavor is kind of lost when they're in tiny shreds.

Easy to make and I love that I will almost always have all the ingredients on hand.  I will probably make this one more in the winter when I want something warm and hearty.  I may add more veggies next time as well - some bell peppers or celery perhaps.

This soup is surprisingly tasty! It is really easy to put together, and it is very healthy. I didn't use quite as much spinach as the recipe called for, but that was the only change I made. One suggestion though; it doesn't take anywhere near 55-60 minutes to cook the lentils! Mine were done in about 20 minutes!

I followed the recipe exactly and found this to be a great soup. I have been trying to eat more healthy and expand the variety of soups I make. This is definately one I will be keeping. It makes a lot and is quite hearty. The only thing I will do differently next time is add a clove of chopped garlic. Other than that, terrific!

Delicious, however, I had to substitute whole canned tomatoes for the salsa (had none!).  I did add cayenne pepper, cumin, garlic power, as well as minced garlic and celery, and chicken broth.  Such a low-cal dish!

Good soup.  The success of this recipe depends on the salsa. I think I need a different salsa than the one I used. Served it with a dab of sour cream. I had leftovers so, to change it up for another dinner, I added smoked sausage and served over rice without the sour cream but with a sprinkle of Parmesan.

This was so easy and so good.  Hubby and I loved it.  Only changes - added celery, a bay leaf, used box of frozen spinach, and lentils did not need 50 minutes cooking.  I was very impressed.

Great recipe- I made this in the crock pot and used a box of frozen spinach instead of fresh- turned out great.  I then added some acini di pepe (tiny round) pasta I cooked in chicken broth - excellent! Serve with a sprinkle of parmesian cheese -yumm.

This is BY FAR the best lentil soup I ever had! I thought the salsa sounded like a strange ingredient, but it made for a fantastic soup. I added double the spinach to make it a more vitamin-rich meal. I have brought it for lunch for two weeks now, and all my friends keep asking for a bite!

A simple and satisfying soup. Great to use up those leftovers! I used half a jar of left over chunky pasta sauce (onion n garlic) Soaked the lentils together with chickpeas overnight. Didnt think it had enough flavour probably my fault for using less sauce. So i added, 1 tablespoon tomato sauce, 2 tsp dried oregano, 1 tsp dried parsley, 1/2 tsp cayanne pepper and 1.5 tablespoon apple cider vinegar as I prefer my soup more tart. Added pasta in it for a filling meal. If freezing leftovers, I would suggest that u only add the amt of spinach u'd be eating then add spinach whenever u reheat. This way, it wldnt get mushy. Great value n healthy indeed!

the only change I made -substituted half of the salsa, for stewed tomatoes, both of which I can at home. this is a great soup, extremely low in sodium and yet so flavorful and almost provides a full days worth of fiber intake with just one serving.  Thanks for submitting it Sally!

I was skeptical at first, thinking this wouldn't have enough flavor, and boy was I wrong.  This is an outstanding recipe!  I added a little garlic for flavor, as well as using vegetable broth instead of water.  And for the salsa, I used this 3-pepper salsa that the guy at Trader Joe's recommended.  Excellent - and incredibly healthy!

This is really good and really easy to make!  I used half the amount of salsa, an extra cup of water, a little extra lentils (maybe an extra eighth or quarter of a cup? Not sure; the bag's in metric), and I added a little green pepper and a small can of corn.  I chopped the carrots instead of shredding them.  I also added 2 small packets of vegetable boullion powder, and some chopped roasted garlic in the sautéing phase.  Delicious and so versatile!  This is the second time I've made this recipe, and I love it.  Thank you so much!

I make this soup recipe a lot.  I usually use broth instead of water as others have suggested.  When I make it vegetarian, I use vegetable broth.  Sometimes I add meat, like  Aidells spicy mango and jalapeno chicken meatballs and then I use chicken broth.  I find the flavor is influenced a lot by the kind of salsa you use.  My husband prefers it when I use Pace Mild Salsa. I usually use red lentils because it looks so pretty compared to other lentils.  Great flavor and very healthy.

Very easy recipe to put together. The result is a quick, tasty and nutritious soup. I did find I had to cook it longer in order to get the lentils as soft as like them. However, I was using larger than usual lentils. I think next time i make it I will add some garlic to it. Definitely will make again.

excellent recipe. I put half the soup in a blender and added it back for texture. I also added fresh lemon juice before serving. My husband was suspicious of trying something out of the ordinary, however, after one bowl, he had seconds and thirds. I love this soup because it is easy to make and low fat.

Really delicious!  I had 2 c. of chicken broth left over, so I used that plus 4 c. water.  I didn't bother shredding the carrots, but diced about 4 and also through in some diced celery.  I can't have the lime juice in prepared salsa, so I used a can of diced tomatoes plus 1 tsp. cumin, 1/2 tsp. paprika and a dash of red pepper flakes.  In addition, I added a half cup of elbow mac with the spinach (or kale, sometimes).  We topped it with some crumbled turkey bacon and some shaved cheese.  YUMMO!

Bland, bland, bland...I made according to the recipe except subbed 4cups chx broth for part of the water.  This recipe needs some major jazzing up.

Made this last week and loved this so much I am making it again! I did not shred my carrots out of laziness and they turned out fine chopped.  I used half water half veggie broth but really don't think it was needed because the soup was very flavorful.  I will be making this often, yummy, healthy and filling!

This soup is amazing.  To make it a bit thicker and creamier I pureed the spinach with some parsley, a little milk, and one of the cups of water first to create a base.  Then I threw in a bunch of vegetables, mango salsa, and a little nutmeg and it is awesome.  After simmering for awhile and then standing for about five minutes it thickened up so nicely that it's a perfect winter soup.

Great recipe and so easy! I added some whole wheat rotini when I added the spinach, which made this soup into more of a heartier stew. Topped this off with grated Parm and served with fresh baked biscuits. It was yummy! Thanks!

The flavor of this dish probably depends a lot on what salsa you use. My salsa had corn in it so I added some more (scraped off the cob). Came out pretty well. A nice, easy vegetarian dish. When I reheat the leftovers, I will add some additional spices.

For fun I added some pork steak and bacon bits at about the 30 min mark to give it a little bit of meat flavoring, which I like.  5 minutes before serving I also tossed in some minced garlic (maybe 1.5 tsp) to make the flavors pop.  It worked for me!  DH and I were filled up after just one bowl each!

Great recipe!!  I added some chopped cilantro (I always add it to a dish that has spinach) and it really lightened the flavor.  I also added a pinch of cumin, coriander & curry.

Using just the ingredients listed I was not crazy about the soup.  I switched the water and chicken broth amounts, added some fresh lemon thyme, garlic, bay leaf, fresh chopped red pepper and mushrooms and decided not to go with the rice.  Just needs tweaked to individual tastes.

I thought this lentil soup tasted good but for some reason it took FOREVER for the lentils to soften. I cooked it over 1 1/2 hrs. and the lentils were still sort of al dente, so that's how we ate it! I have made other lentil soups and never had this problem before. I used chicken broth instead of water.

i had low expectations of this recipe, probably because it has lentils in it and only Indians eat lentils.  and there aint no meat in it.  BUT IT IS GOOD.  and it'll impress your vegetarian friends too.

I have made a few changes, and this is now my family's favorite soup. Instead of salsa, I use a can of diced tomatoes, either plain or basil seasoned. When I add the water, I also add a couple of teaspoons of Vegetable Better than Boullion. It's such a hearty, flavorful soup!

This was delightful!  Fantastic flavour- I had never considered using salsa in a soup before!  I did add some vegetable bullion in with my water, and some garlic and fresh cilantro that I had on hand, but otherwise I made the recipe as written and it turned out great!

This is so good and easy...I've made this with both water and chicken broth, and I definitely recommend using chicken broth because it really boosts the flavor.  I've also added turkey kielbasa, and it's delicious.

I found this soup pretty boring.  It was nice, I'd eat it any time it was served but I won't bother making it again.  A bit of lemon juice was an improvement.  Perhaps my salsa was too boring?

As is this recipe is pretty good. I have started making it with a few modifications and it's now a favorite in my house. I used about 3 cups of shredded carrots instead of 1. I used some organic free range chicken broth instead of water. And I tried a few different salsas and found that Emeril's Original Medium salsa is perfect for this recipe. At my wife's request I omitted the spinach and I don't miss it with these other changes I've made.

Lovely soup.  I was looking for something colorful and soothing to deal with my cold, and this hit the spot.  I added a bit more spice, additional carrot, and fresh mushrooms--also used 10 oz of frozen chopped spinach instead of fresh and let it thaw in the pot.

I agree with Joanne that the recipe could have been more flavorful.  Does it need more spices?  Bacon?  Different salsa?  Probably its downfall is its best quality - this is a simple recipe, which is why I made it, and why I give it four instead of three stars.  I agree with the author and Joanne that this is a good base recipe and you should add any other veggies that you love.  Maybe some herbs and spices too, or very flavorful lentils!

Very simple and good.  I like the salsa addition, it would taste a bit different every time depending on what salsa you used.

maybe I'm just not a lentil fan...not sure.  I made it for a friend who's in the hospital and is vegan.  Compared to the hospital food it was good but I found this recipe quite boring.  It was edible but trying to get my teenager to eat it was impossible.  Would not make again.

I loved this recipe!  I didn't have some ingredients on hand and I'd never cooked lentils before, but I managed to pull through and the delivery was superb.  I started with two teaspoons of minced garlic sauteed in a few tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil with onions, one chile pepper, a few pinches of ground cumin, and some diced carrot.  After the onions looked a bit translucent, I added the lentils and water.  I substituted diced tomatoes for salsa, and did add some more mild peppers of some kind.  Seasoned with a bit of salt, dill weed, and basil.  Brought it all to a boil, then turned the heat down and simmered for 50 minutes, then I added broccoli (since I had no spinach on hand) and cooked it for around 10 minutes or so longer.  It turned out delicious!  I am excited to make this again when I get a chance to get the spinach!  Though, I will not add salsa, I prefer to use tomatoes and season it myself!  A delicious recipe!

I had a cold and needed to make something nourishing and easy and this was the ticket.  I too added half a bag of frozen spinach right at the end of the cooking time.  Thanks for such a easy and welcome recipe.

Easy and delicious. Used vegetable broth for more flavour and chopped carrots instead of grated because I love carrot chunks in soup. Thanks for the great recipe!

This soup is just plain yummy! I used one jar of home made canned tomatoes and a half jar of home made salsa instead of the salsa listed on the recipe. It was still very good.   I think that if you used a medium salsa, it would give it a little "kick" and that could be a lot of fun with some seared flour tortillas.  It was light enough that it was tasty and warming on a cold winter day. I will definitely make this again and again. My hubby ate till he was full as a tick on a dogs back.

This was really good for a healthy dish. I just diced my carrots and sauteed in the oil with a good bit of minced garlic and the onions. I spiced things up with Frank's Red Hot, used medium salsa, cumin, seasoned salt, fresh ground pepper, and chili powder. Served with a caesar salad and french baguettes.

Very easy; very good! My daughter is allergic to carrots, so I put in about 1 cup of chopped Celery and 1 cup of chopped yellow and orange bell peppers instead. I also used fresh salsa, instead of canned. It turned out fantastic, and everyone enjoyed it. This is a great vegetarian option. I served it with corn bread. My 15 month old daughter loved the soup.

This soup is great.  I used beef broth in place of water because I had it on hand and figured it would add flavor.  Be aware that the spiciness of the salsa you use will determine how spicy the soup is.  My soup was a little too spicy for my kiddos (they added a little cooked rice to temper the heat and gobbled it up) so I'll be sure to use a milder salsa next time.  My husband has tried lentil soup in the past and didn't care for it, but he liked this one.  I'll definitely make it again.

This tasted better after it had a few days to let the flavors meld, however, the spinach seemed like it was out of place with salsa flavoring.

This soup was gone in 15 minutes at a party yesterday. Couldn't have been easier to make and everyone asked for the recipe. Can't beat how healthy this is and even my allergic son can eat it. Great job! (P.S.  - The party was in Liverpool, NY, ironic)

Really enjoyed this healthy soup. Used a good quality balsamic vinegar, added some potatoes and a chopped zucchini for extra veg. Even my husband, who usually isn't keen on 'healthy' loved this soup and went back for seconds.

So few ingredients for such big taste!!  Absolutely incredible and soooo easy!  I chopped instead of grating the carrots and added a yellow bell pepper only as I had one that needed using up.  I decided to use a low sodium beef broth (would normally chose veggie, but served this with Beef Samosas from this site).  Since I used the broth,I did not add the salt.  I only had red lentils on hand and they definitely did not need the full 50 min cooking time, so when I do this again, I will adjust that accordigly or use lentils that take longer.  Regardless, excellent recipe and even better cuz I can enjoy the leftovers!!

This is a great recipe. It honestly couldn't be simpler to put together. I followed it exactly as written except for substituting chicken stock for the water. I used "medium" store brand salsa, which gave the soup a little heat...just the right amount, I think. The spinach is really what makes this recipe. I topped it two ways...and they're both good...with shredded parmesan OR with a dollop of sour cream. Thanks, Sally, for a delicious, healthy, easy recipe.

This soup is delicious and simple to throw together on a cold night!  I doubled the ingrediants (1 jar of mild/1 jar of medium chunky salsa) and followed the instructions.  Did top with shredded Parmesean cheese and diced Canadian Bacon as others suggested.  So healthy and liked by everyone!

Fabulous!  I didn't change a thing.  The first time I made it I thought only my husband and I would like it so I made something different for the kids.  They took a taste and loved it.  This is now a weekly meal in our home.  Oh, did mention how easy it is?

I cannot say enough about how awesome this soup is.  I had never made lentil soup before, so I was sort of hesitant.  I ended up not having enough salsa, so that also worried me.  So the only changes I made was I added some fresh mushrooms and a jar of marinara sauce, and that made it absolutely perfect!  This soup gets better the longer it sits in the fridge, the second, third, fourth day.  We all loved it, and I'm making it again this week!

Simple and wonderful! I agree that you want to add the spinach at the last minute. When I'm reheating a single serving in the microwave, I actually put a handful of baby spinach in the bowl,  and ladle the soup on top. I was apprehensive about using jarred salsa in a recipe since so many recipes on here seem to require a can of cream of mushroom soup or a bottle of italian dressing... but I can honestly say that this recipe is an exception to that rule!

I gave this 5 stars because it was not only easy, it was delicious. The only "hard" part was chopping the onion ;) which is my kind of recipe! I made a slight error and used "hot" salsa so it was a bit too spicy... but I think that with regular salsa it would be perfect.

Such an easy soup. Turns out nice and hearty- in face, you could probably add some more liquid- I would recommend broth. I might also use a can of vegetable broth instead of 2 of the cups of water. The salsa is a good idea- it doesn't end up tasting salsa-ish. Good, hearty wintertime soup.

Surprisingly good, especially given how few ingredients required and how healthy it is! I used chicken broth and vegetable broth in place of the water. Would be great with some ham or smoked sausage (if you're not vegetarian, of course). I served it with a dollop of sour cream. Yummmmmm!

This is good, I also didn't have salsa so I used a can of diced tomatoes, and some shakes of paprika, cumin, and parsley. Added celery, and one veggie buillion cube. I loved it, my husband only liked it. We both prefer the lentil soup recipe on this site with dried apricots. Mmmmm.

I was always hesitiant to cook with lentil as I always thought they were so tasteless.  NOT this recipe!  Rave reviews from my roomates - added a little garlic and some chile powder just because I can`t live without either of those ingredients! Will 100% make again.

I love lentil soup, and this couldn't have been easier! I used the food processor to shred the carrot and onion. At first taste I thought the spinach taste was overwhelming, but reheated it blended perfectly, and is some of the best lentil soup I have ever tasted.

Fantastic!  My whole family loved it.  I used "medium" salsa.  I think the few reviewers who said it was bland and added spices to it probably used too mild a salsa.  Anything other than mild should work pretty well.  It's very flavorful without any changes; chicken or vegetable broth is definitely not necessary.

This was a very simple and hearty soup. It couldn't get any easier to make, I didn't make any changes and used a freshly prepared salsa. Great Vegan dish!

A very good and easy recipe. Perhaps it was just the salsa I used but I thought it was a little bland at the end so I added a bit of cumin and that gave it a really tasty (slightly middle eastern) flavor. I'll definitely make it again. Perhaps I'll try adding some garlic next time as a previous review recommended.

I made the recipe exactly as written and it was very good.  I used chipolte salsa and thought I had made a mistake but it gave it a really nice smoky flavor.  You'd never know it was a meatless dish.   I did have to add a cup of chicken broth because it was thicker than I like.  I definitely will  make this again.  My hubby loved it, loved it!

Quick, easy and delicious. Loved the addition of salsa - all the seasoning it needs. I didn't have enough lentils, so I rounded them off with split peas, which worked out fine. Also instead of 6 cups water, I used 4 cups of veg broth and two of water to goose up the flavor. I chopped my carrots into tiny dice instead of shredding. YUM, YUM, YUM! Another scrumptious addition to my soup rotation . . . thanks Sally!

I followed the recipe just as it is written, except I just put in the entire bag of Lentils and it came to about 2 cups.  Made it more of a stew instead of a soup. But this is a keeper!!!

Absolutely delicious! I too was skeptical of the few ingredients (I kept wanting to add stuff...), but they blended very nicely into a flavorful, hearty and filling meal. It's not that often that you find comfort food that's healthy to boot, but this certainly did it for us.
