Please!  Slow cooker receipe?  You spend nearly as much time getting this together as you do in the slow cooker.  And you could get the same effect on the stovetop.

This was great!  Easy and tasty.  I used penne pasta and a 5 blend shredded cheese mix and two cans of diced tomatoes, one with mild green chilies and one just tomatoes. I also added some garlic and minced onions while cooking the chicken. My Daughter and my boyfriend loved it, will definitely make again trying other pastas!  Can't wait for leftovers for lunch today!  Thanks for the recipe!

I liked this recipe, and so did my family. Some thought it was too spicy, so the next time I tried it, I just used a can of tomatoes, but it wasn't as good. I say leave the recipe as is!

This recipe served its purpose very well.  I needed a recipe for the ingredients I had on hand, and that could be kept warm for hours until we needed to eat.  This tasted like "comfort food", and everyone loved it.  Next time, I will use less spaghetti because my crockpot is small and everything didn't fit.  The only problem with this recipe is you have to wash three pots (chicken, spaghetti, and crock pot), but other than that it is a great pot-luck type of dish.

This is a great, "child-friendly" recipe. I always add in some 'real' sharp cheddar cheese for a little more flavor, but it works well either way. Popular at church, too! Give this one a try. :)

The leftovers are yummy too.This was a nice change from the usual spaghetti
dinner.Thanks for this one Sharon it's a keeper!!!

My family loves this recipe. I added a chopped onion and a can of mushrooms, omit cream of chicken soup but add 1/2 can of chicken broth and rub the pot with butter. Put all (except noodles) in the pot and cook 4 hours on High, then add cooked noodles. Cook another 1.5 hours on Low. Super easy slow cooker recipe, and so yummy!

I will give this recipe 4 stars because it was very easy.  The taste was just ok.  I wish it had more flavor.  It was kind of bland.

This recipe is pretty good. Without additional spicing for the chicken or sauce, though, I can see how it can be bland, due to the cheese not contributing savor and the chilis being the only other source of flavoring. To cut down on pan use and make this recipe easier, here's what I did. First, I cooked the chicken in the slow cooker, 5 hours on low, with 2 tbsp of butter and a splash of wine, covering the chicken with various spices. I used oregano, basil, thyme, black pepper, cayenne pepper and a hint of curry. Use your favorite spices. Then I added the rest of the ingredients. I admit that I used 12 oz of processed cheese food instead of 8 oz because I was looking at the block and thinking that I didn't care to have 4 oz of it sitting around in my fridge. This made the spaghetti very very dense - beware. Delicious but dense if you add more cheese. I also used linguine because that's what I had sitting around. I feel thicker pastas pick up sauces better and allow other things in the sauce to adhere to each strip of the pasta. Pretty good stuff, lots of leftovers (4 servings!) with three hearty eaters.

The whole family loved it! I did not make it in the crock pot.  I boiled chicken, took it out and boiled pasta in the same pot.  I didn't want to wash more than one dish.  I used cream of celery and cream of mushroom soup.  This was easy and will definitely be making again.

Try decreasing the amount of noodles in this recipe. It also lacked alot of flavor that you would expect from all the ingredients.

Really enjoyed this for something different. Definitely did not use the crock pot. I just used the same pot with which I boiled the pasta then put it all in a casserole dish, topped it with jack cheese and baked it for 15 minutes. I did add one more can of tomatoes with chiles. Next time I will use shredded pepper jack or cheddar instead of or in addition to the processed cheese.

Loved this recipe. Only I didn't use the slow cooker.  Instead, I used chicken thighs (I know that chicken breast tastes better, but that is all I had) and I boiled the chicken in a big pot and then took out the chicken and boiled the noodles and strained them and then just combined it all and cooked it on low.  Super easy and not a big mess!

My family asks for this at least 3 times a month. The only thing I changed in the recipe is the cheese. Instead of using processed cheese, I buy a bag of grated mixed cheese (choice depends on personal preferences) and add that instead. To me, improves the taste. Leftover's are always a hit as well. Highly recommend this to anyone that wants a fast and delicious meal.

Unlike one review I read....this recipe is NOT hard to get together at all.  I am not one to cook alot of homemade meals because im a busy mom of 6 but I like to try new easy crock pot meals a couple times a week.  Sure you dont just throw it all in at once but cooking the noodles and chicken before hand was not a big deal and its well worth it.  This is absolutely yummy and its an easy recipe to double for larger families.  Thanks for a delicious new recipe to add to my cookbook!

I thought this recipe was good. It was WAY to spicey for my taste. Even my husband said so and he likes spicey. So when I make it next time I will only add one can of tomatoes with green chille's and a can of regular tomatoes. I thought it was delicious aside from the spiceyness. Oh and the other thing, it is NOT worth the time to put it in the slow cooker/crock pot. Takes WAY too much time. I ended having to put it on the stove top because it wouldn't heat fast enough.

The kids loved this one! They said it was a definite "make again".  I didn't use the crock pot, I just heated it on "low" on the stove and kept stirring to insure it didn't burn. Next time I will probably use penne pasta, but is probably good with whatever pasta you have on hand.

This is wonderful!!  I have made it several times for pot lucks and for just me and my husband!  I have changed this recipe over the past few times I made this.  I use 1 can cream of  mushroom with herbs and 1 can of cream of chicken with herbs.  I use 1 can original rotel, 2 cans of whole tomatoes that I squeeze into the crockpot, velveeta, abd thin spaghetti noodles.  I'm a spice fanatic so of course I add about a tsp. each of garlic powder, onion powder, cayanne pepper, salt, and pepper.  Once the cheese is melted I turn the crockpot to warm and leave it in there for about an hour.  Garnish it with chopped green onion and it's perfect!

I love chicken spaghetti and especially this recipe! I cooked my chicken breasts in the slow cooker and then removed and cubed them. I added my tomatoes and chiles, soup mixture and cubed cheese in the crock pot with the chicken juices that had cooked off. Once the mixture is smooth and the cheese is melted, I added the cooked noodles and chicken, mixed and allowed to simmer on low for 40-50 minutes. 

Cooking the chicken in the crock pot makes it more of a slow-cooker recipe, but this is done easily on the stove too. So tasty and easy!!

Nice comfort food. It's impossible to have just one serving. I used wheat spaghetti and instead of boiling the chicken, I browned the cut meat in olive oil and garlic powder. For quicker melting, cut the Velveeta in small pieces. As others mention, a slow cooker doesn't seem necessary.  Save having to wash another pot and cook the entire mix in the same pot used for the pasta.

This was good--very thick, though.  It kind of tasted like chicken echilada filling with spaghetti.  I'm not sure why you would need to put it in the slow cooker, except to keep it warm for a while.  I just did it on the stove top.  My family liked it--even ate seconds!

My husband is not a chicken lover, but even he enjoyed this dish. I'll definitely add it to my go-to list.

This is actually one of my son's favorite recipe's. I have always made it in the oven and not the crock pot.  When I make it in the oven, I add all the ingredients above as well as 1 can of water and 1 stick of butter.  This gives the rice a little more richness and moisture.

This is a great and quick recipe. You could probably just cook it on the stovetop and get the same effect. I used some left over grilled chicken breast and I used fettucini noodles instead(because that's all I had on hand) I also added granulated garlic, onion powder, and fresh cracked pepper. It turned out absolutely wonderful for such a quick meal! My 1 1/2 year old asked for more!

This should be renamed 'Queso dip with chicken and spaghetti noodles' cause that's what it was. It would have been quicker for me to mix up Velveta and salsa in the microwave and pour it over some chicken and noodles. BLAH!!!

This is an excellent recipe for large groups also. I think the original recipe that says 6 servings should be for 10. I used the mild diced tomatoes and was just spicy enough. I fed 60 with this and it holds well for a extended serving time. It would be great for church dinners.

This was really quite bland. We ate it, but it wasn't that exciting. No need for this to be a slow cooker recipe, when you spend so much prep time.  This one is not worth your time.

Did not like this recipe at all.  I decided to give it a try since I had all the ingredients on hand, but I made it on the stove instead of in the slow cooker.  It tasted just like the classic queso dip made with Rotel and Velveeta mixed with spaghetti noodles.  We couldn't tell that the soups changed the flavor at all.  It maybe would have made a good dip for chips, but I didn't think it made a good chicken spaghetti.

The flavor of the sauce was very good!  I did not use my slow cooker, but cut down on the dishes/time by cooking the chicken in my skillet, then adding the soups, rotel and cheese.  Served the sauce over the spaghetti.  Next time will add more tomatoes or maybe some spinach.  It needs more veggies or color.

Great recipe! I used 8 oz. of angelhair pasta instead of the 16 oz. of spaghetti it called for and it still made a pot full.  Will make this one again.

The title is misleading but other than that this was great.  Instead of spaghetti I used elbow macaroni.  I didn't have any tomatoes on hand so I used canned mushrooms instead.  I also used a mix blend of cheese(cheddar and monterey jack cheese) and it was fantastic.  Very tasty but I wouldn't really call this a "Slow Cooker" recipe.

I've had a very similar recipe for a few months now, the only difference is mine asked for cream of celery not chicken.  But as always I tinkered with it and tried cream of chicken.  Both ways are awesome.  This is one of my families most frequent requests.  It really isn't a slow cooker recipe, but a great make ahead recipe.  Eight thumbs up from my family!

Why even bother with the slow cooker, when you have to precook the chicken & the spaghetti?  This recipe has no taste whatsoever except salt!

My husband and I really liked this recipe. I only used a few slices of swiss cheese instead of the 8 oz. the recipe called for. The cheese didn't overpower the recipe. I think the recipe would be good without any cheese. I also didn't use a crockpot and spooned the sauce over whole wheat spaghetti.

I needed a quick meal (with ingredients I have on hand) for the kids and sitter tonight - put this together in less than 10 minutes....I did make some changes:  put uncooked spaghetti on the bottom of crockpot, added chopped chicken and topped w/ slices of American cheese....subbed cottage cheese for cream of chicken, mixed w/ cream of mushroom and rotel - poured over other ingredients!  It smells great and I think they will love it with a veggie and some cheese muffins.

This is exactly how we have made this for years, we don't make it in the slow cooker and it is still amazing so yummy and creamy we have found that using cheese whiz is the easiest cheese product to use. It can be a little spicy but double the recipe without doubling the tomatoes with green chilies and that will help, or half it and use half of a can.

Yummy! Super easy!  Instead of fresh chicken breasts I used a couple of cans of canned chicken...gave the whole thing a little bit of a tuna noodle kind of flavor.  We enjoyed it.

This was really not that good. I thought it was quite bland. It was different. Everyone kept saying, "oh, is that chicken cheese dip?" and that really is what it looked like. I won't be making it again.

I am not a cook so I had no clue what they meant by "processed" cheese. I wish they would've said slice cheese! I substituted the cheese with colby and monterey jack shredded mix and 1/4 cup of ricotta cheese (I love cheese! LOL!) and since I am not a huge fan of chiles, I only used half the can of Rotel...... DELICIOUS! I would add mushroom slices in addition to the soup when I make it again.

Use a slow cooker liner, rotisserie chicken and I only have the pasta pot to clean up!  And if it is too spicy, use mild tomatoes and green chilies!  That is how I make it!

I am a horrible cook when it comes to patience so this recipe was really easy and didn't require much prep! (Which is great for me). The only problem I noticed was that it seemed a little dry... maybe I needed to add more cream of mushroom but regardless it still tasted yummy.

This was pretty simple to make.  The diced tomatoes and green chile peppers will dominate the dish.  Used whole wheat penne pasta, velveeta cheese,added my own spices to the chicken and added some frozen veggies that were in the freezer. This is definitely a kid friendly/comfort food.  I wouldn't use it to impress adults.

This was a pretty decent recipe. I made it on the stove top so that I didn't dirty three different pans. I don't know if that had to do with it being a little dry but...I only used 12 oz of angel hair pasta and we had tons left over. I actually liked the taste of it better the next day for lunch. I may try this again but I will have to adjust it somehow. Thanks though....

This was great!  Everyone in my household loved it.  Easy to prepare and very good.  Would make a good church potluck dish as well.  The only change I made was that I used two cans of Ro-tel.
