Our first attmept at leg of lamb. We used a boneless tied roast and added sage to the herb mix. It was a big hit with our guests. I will use this recipe again.

Well Sunset, I wanted to manted to do something different with that leg of lamb I've had in the freezer and boy was this different... sad to say but my family absolutly hated.  I've always cooked my lamb with just garlic and mint.. without any complaints and I suppose that's how I'll have to make the next one so that I don't have to worry about being replaced.  Guess we're just a family that likes traditional flavors.

I used this recipe for 2 lbs of lamb chops, I used dry parsley, increased the garlic and salt and decreased the paprika.........also, I baked it with potatoes and carrots layers on top. My husband and I LOVED it, I will definitely make it again!!
