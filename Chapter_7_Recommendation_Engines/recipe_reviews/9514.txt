Tasted like hot pudding to me rather than chocolate sauce.

This tastes fine--very minty. Mixing everything together at once caused the pudding to make little clumps. I had to pour mine through a mesh strainer to get out most of the clumps. I think next time I would start with the pudding and then stir in the milk before adding the candies and heating.
