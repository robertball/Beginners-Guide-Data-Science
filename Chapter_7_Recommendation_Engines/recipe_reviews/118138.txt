This is very easy and has such a fresh taste it's wonderful.  4 stars only because mixing the sour cream and pudding mix together created lumps due to the how thick the mixture was, which were difficult to get out prior to incorporating the whipped topping.  Will surely be utilizing this recipe again.

I made this recipe for a couple of friends two nights ago and it was a big hit. Absolutely delicious and easy! Can make ahead of time. Also, I whipped my own cream (added confectioners sugar and flavored with vanilla)instead of using the store bought stuff - I think it makes it richer.

This didn't set very well and I made it the day before.  It ended up being very messy at serving time but the flavor was good.  Next time I will freeze it before taking the sides off of the pan.  I used chocolate wafer crumbs for the crust and topped it with chocolate crumbs instead of nuts due to an allergy.

This was very good and very simple.  Had a little issue with the pudding mix and sour cream.  We used nilla wafers, instead of grahm crackers and no sugar.

This is really "Yummy"! Followed recipe exactly and it was perfect. Not too sweet, great balance of flavors and textures with the firm banana slices and pecans. I did cut it too soon (only chilled about 4 hours instead of 6), so will make it earlier next time and plan for longer chilling time. Still great though. Everyone here really enjoyed this dessert. Will make this again soon. Thanks for sharing!

Made for Recipe Group. I couldn't get the beaters on my hand mixer to beat the sour ceam and pudding mix for two minutes, it was getting stringy. I added the whipped topping and mixed it all up then added the bananas. Let it chill for 6 hours and still not set very well. It is now in the freezer.  I added a little shaved chocolate on the top instead of nuts. Good banana flavor, like eating a banana cream pie, nice crunch from the crust. I had a real problem even after freezing and defrosting with getting the crust off my springform base. It glued itself on there. Was still not set well. Thanks Angel.

Made this for Recipe Group and took it to my mom for Mother's Day...HUGE HIT w/ everyone!!!! I did use sugar free pudding, fat free whipped topping, light sour cream and splenda, because my mom is dieting...it worked out wonderfully! I made this yeasterday and put it in the freezer overnight. This morning, I unmolded it (super easy), plated it and decorated it w/ more whipped topping and the pecans and put it in the fridge. It kept it's shape nicely and cut perfectly. This tasted just like banana cream pie~YUM! This is gonna be a definate repeat dessert (my mom already demanded the recipe, lol), especially for the summer! Thanks for sharing. :)

Delicious and just right for the warm days!  Would bake the crust for at least 10 minutes and cool before adding other ingredients.

An absolutely wonderful dessert!  The flavors go so perfectly together.  I made this for friends today and they all loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I toasted the pecans as mine were in the freezer and I felt that would freshen them up a bit.  Thank you for sharing a great recipe.

This was awesome, the only thing I changed was I used Vanilla  wafers for the crust, as one other viewer stated, I put it in the freezer to have it setup for a few hours, and I didn't use pecans on top of it because they don't like pecans so I used some of the leftover crumbs from the vanilla wafers, all of my family loved it, and you really don't need the pecans it was so awesome , thanks for the awesome recipe

The sour cream/pudding didn't exactly mix right. It set up fine for me in the freezer but showed signs of being runny as the edges thawed. I think the pudding mix should be gently stirred into the cool whip, and the sour cream folded in, not the other way around. I've made soft frosting before that started out mixing pudding into cool whip, and I liked the result I got from that, so I might try this again switching the method around. I had no issues with the crust or the bananas. I did use chocolate graham crackers because I had some open and didn't have regular graham open. The flavor was very well-received. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this for Recipe Group:  07, May '11.  This dessert was a huge hit in our house and with the  company too.  After reading the other reviews and the problems they had serving this, I put mine in the freezer.  It was in the freezer about 18 hours before I put it in the refrigerator to thaw.  I removed the sides right before serving (after 8 hours in the frig) The dessert had thawed and sliced and served nicely.  As I'm writing this review I realize I forgot the chopped pecans.  Everyone loved this dessert and I will definitely be making it again.  I would suggest the freezing method rather than the refrigeration method to get this dessert to set up.  Thanks Angel for shaing this.

This recipe had a high annoyance factor.  First I had trouble combining the pudding and sour cream and then it didn't set up well even though it was in the coldest part of my fridge for at least 18 hours so it was very sloppy looking when served.  I didn't have enough room for it in the freezer.  The flavor was good, but my family just wasn't wowed.  Thanks Angel, for the opportunity to try something new

This dessert had really good favors but it never set. I read other reviews and tried some suggestion. Made ahead of time never set in fridge so froze but either way never set. Don't think I'll be making this one again.

Very yummy!  I made this with ripe bananas rather than firm, and put it in a 9 x 13 pan.  Worked out really well.
