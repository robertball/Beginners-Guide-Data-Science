Really enjoyed this recipe it was quick and easy. I used red pepper instead of green.  It gave it a little sweeter taste

This stew is marvelous darling, but I am a lazy cook so I used precooked Italian meatballs (cut in 1/4) and then cooked white rice and onions in liquid. when the rice was almost done I dumped in about twice the recommended green pepper. Then keep checking until the peppers were the correct texture.
2 things:
don't over cook the peppers
don't skimp on black pepper
