While this recipe was great use of leftovers from Thanksgiving. I have to be in the middle of the road with this. And this is me and me alone on my opinion. My family loved it very much. My issue was, I didn't like all the wetness of the gravy and cream corn (because it baked right over the edges of the pan and dripped everywhere in the oven). It made the mashed potatoes very wet and soupy-like (I don't like runny mashed potatoes) and the stuffing was lost underneath. I didn't realize until I tried spooning it out of the pan, that I myself, didn't like the goopy-ness. Again, this is me because my family had other opinions. The gravy needs to be left out and served with over the recipe after the dish is baked, that would appease my senses in enjoying this casserole. However, as is, I myself won't be eating it this way again. I apologize. My family on the other hand likes it as it is.

This was pretty darned good.  I used leftover stuffing instead of the bread cubes, which made more sense.  A leftovers casserole should be made of leftovers.  Other than that and adding more cheese than called for, I followed the recipe, scaled for two.  I'll make this again.

Unfortunately, I didn't have any stuffing, so I made the recipe without it.  I also used one can of regular corn because that's what I had.  I loved that this recipe was simple to make and the cheddar on top added a little something extra.  Would make again next year.

I was craving Thanksgiving dinner in October. I searched and found this recipe gem! The only ingredient I changed was using cooked ground turkey instead of chopped leftover turkey meat. I used smoked provolone cheese because it was the only cheese I had. This casserole is absolutely yum! I can’t wait to try this with the real deal of extra Thanksgiving turkey leftovers. “Winner, winner Thanksgiving leftover dinner!!”

This is yummy comfort food and so so easy. I skipped the whole first part and placed leftover stuffing in bottom of a lightly buttered casserole dish, then the turkey, gravy and leftover green beans, and mashed potato, finshed the baking step with grated fontina. Top with cranberry sauce...

Made this recipe today with our Thanksgiving leftovers. Substituted leftover stuffing for step 2 and used about 3 cups of gravy instead of the 2 called for in the recipe. My husband loved it! I am not the best cook usually and we are all sick of turkey at this point, but this recipe made it seem less like leftovers and more like a brand new meal! Loved it!

I made this exactly like the recipe  I was practicing to see if this would actually be good the day after.  It was good but my kids were disappointed in the stuffing part because it didn't taste like mine.  I  usually make sausage dressing and use sage and poultry seasoning.  Next time I will at least add seasonings.  Also it would be better with my gravy but I bought some as I didn't have any.  I still give it five stars because they ate it all up.

Very tasty, wife loved it. Had to make some changes to accommodate what I had available. Used 1.5 cups of leftover prepared stuffing instead of dry & left out broth. 
Great flavor, but far to much liquid, and I had forgot to add in the creamed corn, sat=w it on the counter after it started baking. Almost overflowed the skillet. Spent a good amount of time removing the excess with a turkey baster. After cooling for 15 minutes, it did set up some. Would add a thickener next time or reduce the gravy in half. 
Will do it again with some adjustments

This dish is amazing!! So simple but so good. I substituted the turkey for rotisserie chicken, and canned corn rather than creamed corn. I found that the creamed corn added a little too much liquid (but still tasted good), it just depends on your preference. I’ll definitely be making this again soon!

Delicious. I did use leftover stuffing instead as it only made sense to me. I did fry onions and celery and added it to the gravy. I didn't like the thought of adding creamed corn thinking it might end up runny so I added regular corn. Very easy to make and it could easily be adapted for different meats and veggies.

I used canned corn instead of creamed corn and it turned out terrific.  This is definitely a keeper, so easy to make and the entire family enjoyed this dish.

I made this casserole and it is wonderful and not soupy at all like a previous post said. The only thing I did different was instead of corn I did green beans. It is delicious and will make again.

I LOVED this recipe.  It was such a comfort food.  I can't wait to make it again next year.  Next time I will double the batch though so there's more leftovers!
PS  I didn't use the corn.

We thought this was great.  What a great way to use up leftovers and make something new!
I had leftover stuffing, so I skipped step 2.
I added some sautéed onions and mushrooms and green beans to the turkey and gravy layer.... otherwise made as directed.... will make it again for sure anytime we have turkey and all the fixings left over

This was a big hit in my house.  Since it's not Thanksgiving I used ground turkey.  I browned it first.  Since it's a layered dish I do think I will add a layer of sweet potatoes and marshmallows next time.

Great way to rework your Thanksgiving meal!  I, too, used leftover stuffing on the bottom layer rather than sautéing bread crumbs, celery and onion.   A little sprinkle of finely chopped chives or parsley on the top will give it some needed colour.  My family enjoyed it.
