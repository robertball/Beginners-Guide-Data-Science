This is the simplest stuffing recipe in the world. This recipe never fails at thanksgiving.  I do deviate from this recipe though and for the best I think.  I use all cornbread no other bread, for broth I used the stock made with the neck from turkey.  I also recomend cooking your cornbread (Jiff) 5-10 min longer than recomended.  This does two things one it gets a denser crust on the edges adding some great texture and two it dries better allowing for more absorbsion from drippings and the initiall mixing enhancing the flavor.  You will not go wrong with this recipe.

I made this stuffing for Thanksgiving this year! Absolutely delicious! There were 5 families total and everybody really liked it. I did not alter the ingredients in this recipe at all. First, I cooked the chopped onions and chopped celery slowly (on med-low heat)by itself in a little bit of melted butter until all of it was tender soft.  Then, I cooked my sausage in a separate skillet(I used Jimmy Dean - Pork Sausage). Next, I combined them in a big bowl and put them in the refrigerator to let the flavors blend. Several hours later, when it was closer to our dinner time, I warmed up this mixture in the microwave. I added the rest of the ingredients exactly like the recipe called for, and then baked it.  Very Yummy! I had so many wonderful comments. This will definitely be our annual Thanksgiving stuffing recipe! It turned out perfect!

After some changes, this stuffing turned out alright. I have to say, I really think the 5 cups of bread crumbs is a misprint.  I only put two cups of crumbs and about half a cup extra of chicken broth and it came out fine. Unless you like really dry stuffing, i wouldn't recommend this recipe.

Mine is just a little different and it comes out great. I use a roll of sage sausage and omit the additional sage seasoning. Also cook your cornbread a few days ahead of time, wrap tightly and store in the fridge.  It dries out which is good for making stuffing :)  Also, bread crumbs are to fine. I get a bag of dried bread chunks or toast old bread (white/wheat combo is fine) and add.  I also only use one onion, about 1/2 cup celery and 1/2 cup green pepper and I don't cook it with the sausage. it goes into the stuffing mix raw and cooks in the oven. Finish off the mix with seasoning salt and fresh ground black pepper...the mixed peppercorns are great. add enough broth or water til sticky, but not drippy wet. Also if you are running short on time or don't like all the chopping, omit all the veggie chopping and use chicken broth with herb seasoning. College in makes a good variety.

My mother used to make her cornbread stuffing this way when I was growing up, and it's the best way I know to make cornbread stuffing.  I start off by baking a small pan of cornbread by mixing one cup each of cornmeal and flour with 2 tsp. baking powder, and water.    Once cooled, the cornbread is crumbled into a large mixing bowl along with the sauteed onions, chopped bell peppers, and celery.  In addition to the pork sausage, we cook the turkey neck, gizzards, and the turkey heart in a small pot with 3 cups of water.    The cooked meat is removed from the neck bone and chopped along  with the cooked gizzard and heart, all of which is then added to the cornbread mixture.    The remaining broth is added to moisten the stuffing with additional water as needed.

I had to make Thanksgiving dinner on my own and needed a stuffing recipe because I, quite frankly, have always hated it.  This looked like a winner, both in prep and ingredients.  I used 2 Jiffy cornbread mixes and had a fair amount leftover; Pepperidge Farm Herb Seasoned Stuffing Mix (I can't imagine our recipe giver Sal meant bread crumbs like Progresso), and just to save a step I took another reviewer's suggestion and used sage sausage, therefore omitting the 1 tsp of sage.  I made the stuffing the day before Thanksgiving, then baked it the day of (I let it sit at room temp for about 20 minutes and then baked it per the regular directions).  This dish was the hit of Thanksgiving dinner, so I decided I better see what all the fuss was about -- I could have eaten the entire pan!  Delish!  It had a little kick to it, don't know if that was from the sage sausage or all the onions, but wow!  I will make this every year from now on!

I was really disappointed by this recipe, my husband told me 5 cups of bread crumbs were way to much, I should have listened to him because this was to bready, I even added more broth, all I tasted was the bread crumbs.
It was alteast edible though so I gave it 3 starts

This is one of the best recipes I have ever tried.  I've been trying to find a recipe that was similar to my mother's.  This is the closest to it and the best.  I have used this recipe 3 times already and I am sure I will use it even more.

My husband liked this recipe a lot; however, I wasn't fond of it at all.  I was confused on the bread crumbs.  I used the finely chopped bread crumbs, but was wondering if recipe really meant the herbed cubes that are usually used for dressing.  The finished product was just a gooey mess in my opinion.

I love this recipe.  I do however 1/2 the recipe and put it in an 8x8 or 9x9, depending on which pan I pull out.  I usually just cook it for 30 min.  I don't know if it helps, but after I have formed the cornbread into the dish I sprinkle it with chicken broth, (usually 1/4 C.).  I also like to add 1 to 2 chopped hard boiled eggs.  Thanks for the recipe.

Best cornbread ever! Use only cornbread (no bread crumbs). 7-8 cups of slightly overcooked Jiff (4 boxes) is best. Krusteaz is too sweet. Use sage sausage and a couple teaspoons of powdered sage. Also up the poultry seasoning to a couple tablespoons. Finally, add a package of chopped fresh mushrooms at the end of the saute (crimini or baby bella). Wonderful!

I LOVED THIS RECIPE!!!!!!!!!! For Thanksgiving I made our family favorite stuffing because my family does not adapt to change easily. And, I also made a pan of this recipe, it was lapped up like a parched dog on a hot day.  This is now the stuffing recipe that my family requests I make from now on.  Thank you Sara!!!

I didn't use cornbread but all bread stuffing from the large bag. I also added one egg to help bind. It came out moist and tasty but the sausage was a bit much so maybe more bread next time or one bag plus cornbread and a little more liquid. Not the best I have had but certainly a keeper none the less.

This is the bare-bones version of cornbread stuffing. I punched it up with dried cranberries (pre-soaked in some oj to plump) and grannysmith apples. and made cayenne cornbread for the kick. Still, this recipe works!

I love this stuffing! I do use the neck and giblets to make my broth with a hunk of onion and the celery pieces that you'd normally toss.  I strain the liquid and use this instead of purchased broth.  As one reviewer suggested, I used all cornbread and everyone was delighted with the outcome.  Was hoping we could have turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce sandwiches on sub rolls with the leftovers, but there was only about a tablespoon of stuffing left.  Of course, I did not let that go to waste!  I often make stuffing for Sunday dinners with a roasted/baked chicken and this is the most asked for side dish! Delicious, easy and a BIG keeper.

Just made this for a potluck and it's amazing! Now to make it for Thanksgiving and Christmas! 

If you're wondering how much cornbread you need to buy, I used two 6oz packages and had a little left over.

I used 4 cups of homemade cornbread and 1 cup of zesty seasoned bread crumbs.  The stuffing was a tad dry and very spicy.  The flavor was very good.

Absolutely delicious. I made two pans, one with turkey sausage the other with pork. The other difference I added a little more broth to make it smooth. The turkey sausage was the preferred choice because there are no left overs. Loved it!

This was really good!  I made it for 2 different holiday dinners 5 days apart, and made some revisions the second time around.  First time I used a sweet-type boxed cornbread mix, which I didn't like in this dish at all.  Next time I just put about 1 cup (whatever I had left over from the first time) of cornbread in and about 9 cups of sourdough bread, crumbled. I left the crumbs a bit bigger the second time around and found the stuffing was much fluffier.  I think cubed bread would be the best, rather than crumbs.  I will definitely make this next Christmas.

Great recipe, I tweaked a little, used all cornbread instead of a mixture of both.  And I also added a variety of herbs for flavor.  Always a hit year after year.

This is a great recipe for stuffing, the only thing I did different was I used 6 cups of cornbread and 4 cups of bread crumbs. I also cooked the celery and onions together and and the sausage separate then mixed them and let them sit in fridge overnight. Yummy!

I mixed two cornbread stuffing recipes I found on here. I omitted the bread crumbs and made two bags of cornbread.  I added sugar, 2tsp of sage and pepper to the cornbread mix prior to cooking, I used a chicken boullion cube since I live overseas and we do not have poultry season. I baked it all together and let it sit overnight. I mixed in 1 cup each of celery and onion and cooked it with my ground sausage.  It was perfect. This was my first time making this recipe and it was soooo yummy!

I tried this recipe and loved it. I did add a small can of chopped water chestnuts to the celery and onions, it added a little bit of a crunch. My kids went nuts over it, I make it often.

This was a big hit!  I had lots of leftover corn muffins so I used only corn muffins and no bread crumbs.  Everyone loved it.  I served it with Pork Roast with Hard-Cider gravy and Spiced Apples.  It went great together and it's the perfect way to use up extra cornbread.

Very popular and tasty traditional stuffing.  I took the advice of other cooks and used about half of the bread crumbs.

This stuffing came out so well!  My only suggestion would be to use a savory or spicy sausage.  I used a brown sugar turkey sausage, and the sweetness overpowered the dish.  In the future, I would make this with a nice spicy sausage to complement the sweetness of the cornbread.  Overall, a great recipe!

Instead of sausage, I used maple cured bacon.  Also, since I'm not a huge celery fan, I used only one cup.  As well, I used only two or so cups of bread crumbs.

The recipe came together beautifully, and neither me nor my company could stop munching on it.  Thanks!

I made this for Thanksgiving. This was the first time that I made dressing. My husband raved that this was the best dressing that he has ever had in his life!! After reading the reviews, I cut down on the bread crumbs, but I also used crushed Ritz crackers as well. I used the sage sausage and didn't add extra sage. It was wonderful!

I made this stuffing for Christmas dinner and it was sooo good. Very easy steps to follow and the flavor was great.  I used turkey sausage because I dont eat pork, but the flavors were still in fact there, and my family loved it.

I made this recipe with leftover cornbread (mine was from a Boston Markets meal) and PA-Dutch style sausage.  I also used torn up bread instead of bread crumbs.  I threw bread ends in the oven to dry them out and it worked perfectly.
The corn bread will completely break up in this recipe as you stir it, so if you use bread crumbs there will not be large pieces of bread.  If you like traditional stuffing made from bread cubes, you might not like this.  That's why I substituted the torn up bread.
But it is a great sweet and savory stuffing and was a hit at our Christmas table.  NOT for the diet-conscience!

Very good. I made a couple of changes. I doubled the sausage, but then it was too much, so I'd stick to one pound. I also made bread cubes out of half a loaf of wheat bread instead of the bread crumbs.

Great flavor.  I'd never had this type of stuffing so I wasn't sure what to expect.  It was a big hit with my entire family.  I used store bought corn muffin tops to make the stuffing with to save time and it worked just fine.

as per stated in several reviews, I used all cornbread (from Jiffy mix) and wasn't impressed.  Reminds me of scrapple.  A bit too sweet for me.  Was ok, probably won't make again though.

I've tried a different recipe every year, but this one is worth repeating.  Definitely add you own favorite ingredients.  I only have one oven, so I cooked some ahead in the crockpot and the rest in the oven after I removed the turkey.  I liked the crockpot batch better.

I liked the stuffing okay, but I think it could have been better.  I followed the recipe exactly and had way too many bread crumbs.  I think if it wasn't so crumby I would have really enjoyed it.  I used Jimmy Dean Maple sausage and added mild green peppers and that really added flavour.  When I do it again I will cut the bread crumbs by at least a third I think, or use cubes.

This is very similar to my stuffing recipe, and I actually use this recipe for my shopping list when I need to make it. 5 cups of bread crumbs is a big no no, way too much. I make 2 boxes of jiffy cornbread a couple days ahead of time and let it sit out. I cook a pound of sausage, a couple stalks of celery and a really big onion the night before (and drain) and let them sit in the fridge for the night in the big bowl I am going to mix everything in. I put a pot of chicken broth on the stove and mix in the poultry seasoning until it is hot, not boiling, to loosen up any hardened remaining sausage fat when I mix everything together. I do add some breadcrumbs if I feel it is a little too moist since I don't really measure the chicken broth. Once you get the hang of the stuffing, you can just tell what it needs. Keep on messing with the recipe until it meets your tastes, I promise it is worth it!

Like some of the previous comments, I think the 5 cups of bread crumbs could be a misprint.  It did not turn out very well at all.

No left overs!  That says it all!  This cornbread sausage dressing was a hit!!  I added Granny Smith apple diced and fresh herbs.  My children have Celiac Disease  so made this recipe with gluten free cornbread.  Delicious!!

I add garlic and carrots (2c), and sub whole wheat bread for the crumbs.  This recipe is amazing!! i make it every thanksgiving and christmas.  My family loves it, and i live on the leftovers for days- it's practically a meal on its own.

We love this so much that my family wont let anyone else make dressing!

I have made this recipe for years the only changes are I use bacon fat to fry sausages and onion celery. Also I substitute the breadcrumbs with a bag of pettridge farm seasoned stuffing mix. It’s a family favorite

This Stuffing/Dressing is as close to my Grandmothers Southern Dressing as I've found... It's a winner with any Poultry/pork dinner.... I actually added another 1/4 cup of fluid and a 1/4 cup of finely chopped carrot to mine so it was perfectly moist and tasty...... Enjoy! picture is pre-baking...

Will definitely save this recipe and make it again. I did tweak it with adding diced carrots and additional diced onions. I used part of the stuffing to stuff a Turkey and the rest in a baking dish. The stuffing from the bird was INCREDIBLE.

This recipe called for too much bread crumbs. Next time I would use just the cornbread crumbles and more sausage, then I would see if it needed breadcrumbs to bind it.

Made this for Christmast dinner. Came out great!   I made it ahead of time, covered and put in the fridge overnight.  Then on Christmas, just popped into the oven for the 1 hour.  Came out really moist.

I made one major change to the recipe before I made it for the first time for my Thanksgiving dinner yesterday: instead of just bread crumbs (like the Progresso kind), I went with the suggestion of another reviewer (KIRBY97), and used Pepperidge Farm Seasoned Stuffing Mix.  Everything else was exactly the same.  It was a "5" with the Stuffing Mix.  I also used this same reviewer's tip to make it the day ahead, let it come to room temperature for about 20 minutes, and then bake as directed--highly convenient.  Great flavors and texture!  I will probably use this again for my Thanksgiving dinner next year as well!

I made this at Thanksgiving to take along as an extra stuffing and everyone seemed to like it. I simplified it by using 2 boxes of cornbread stovetop stuffing. With this amount I only needed one large onion and half the celery. I also added half an apple. This  still filled the 9 x 12 dish.

i have now made this recipe for 4 thanksgivings and this will be number 5. I have had EVERYONE rave about this stuff and how good it is. I double the recipe and I put 1lb of HOT Italian sausage along with 1lb of sweet Italian sausage, that is the only modification I have made. Awesome stuff, try it you wont be disappointed

I thought 5 cups of bread crumbs was too much . The mixture was too dry . Had to  add a little chicken broth and also added zucchini , carrots , butternut squash and used chicken  sausage instead of ground sausage . I also didn't mix  veggie mix with stuffing . I layered it . Stuffing , middle ..... sausage veggie mix the more stuffing on top . Wanted to make a more heartier meal lol overall .... amazing !!! :)

To make it five stars...
Use 3 cups of Herb seasoned bread cubes (not crumbs) instead of the 5 cups of bread crumbs...
Add one finely chopped green apple
and use Jimmy Dean Breakfast Sausage, we like sage...

This was so easy to make.

Before I started, I read through some of the other cooks' helpful suggestions.

I used my homemade cast iron skillet buttermilk cornbread.

Changes?  I use sage sausage and did not drain the juices off because it was not grease.  Used 6 cups of cornbread and only one cup of seasoned bread crumbs.  Did not add sage, but used one teaspoon of poultry seasoning.  Added one half teaspoon of black pepper and one half teaspoon of salt.  Also, I only used one can, 14.5 ounces, of low sodium chicken broth (I like my dressing on the dry side).  Smells so good and tasted great.

Maybe next time I will add a can of sweet corn with its juice.

This recipe turned out well.  When I mixed it together I thought it was going to be dry, but after cooking with the foil on it was delicious.  If I make the recipe again I will likely add about a 1/4 more broth and hope that it adds just a bit of moisture without making it gummy.  I did have to do an emergency substitution and used thyme in place of the sage, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I used day old Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread from this site.

I made one change. Instead of seasoned bread crumbs, I used cubed, very lightly toasted bread. It was a huge hit and I will definitely make it again and again!

I just made this for thanksgiving dinner and my VERY picky father-in-law loved it!  He complimented me twice which must be a record.  I was low in chicken broth so I used some dry white wine to supplement and it was really nice.  only change I made.

I made this stuffing for a Thanksgiving potluck at work.  My coworkers all gave it rave reviews.  We are still fighting over the leftovers!

My son and I love this stuffing at Thanksgiving!  I'd love to make it more often, but my wife isn't a sausage person.

I want to say, I love to cook, and followed the recipe, adding some ideas from others.  I put in some dried cranberries, as well as let the onion, celery & sausage sit in the fridge before mixing with other ingredients.  I still found it to be dry and lifeless.  At the least, add more chicken broth.  Once I cooked mine, I placed more over it and will use it to reheat in the morning. I will say that to do this right, I think a dried chorizo sausage (think Whole Foods, not Kroger!) and maybe some poblano peppers to zest it up.  It would be in need of gourmet ingredients, otherwise, it is on the bland side.  It just is missing some kick and I can't quite place it.  I am a vegetarian cook, so I am used to spices, but I just can't nail what is missing, other than trying this with higher end ingredients.  Hope this helps.  I think the recipe is a good one, just needs gourmet tweaking.

I made this recipe last week, and it turned out excellent. I think my hand was a bit too heavy with the poltry seasoning, but, it still tasted great. My family loved it. I'll be making it this Thanksgiving as well.
Thanks for an extremely easy and fantastic tasting recipe!

I am not crazy about stuffing, but this was very good.  A little moist for me.

I followed the advice of another and used only cornbread and it ended up tasting a bit sweet, not what I'm used to with stuffing. Other than that, it was delicious.

This has a wonderful flavor. Unfortunately for me, this was my first attempt at making stuffing from scratch and I added too much liquid so it was a bit too moist. Not to worry...next year it will be absolutely perfect!
