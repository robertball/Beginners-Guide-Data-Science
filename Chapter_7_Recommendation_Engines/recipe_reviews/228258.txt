I want to try this recipe, but I will likely use coconut aminos in place of soy sauce, since soy sauce contains wheat and isn't paleo. Other than that, it sounds good

Made this, specifically wanted something without bread crumbs.  Used Tamari Sauce instead of soy sauce, but would try the coconut aminos next time.  Was afraid the almond meal would give it a slight almondy flavor, but didn't notice it at all.   Totally forgot to add the salt and pepper, d'oh!   I would have liked it with a little more zing, so maybe next time I will use a spicy salt and perhaps some chopped jalapenos.   But it is a very easy, quick recipe to prepare.  A food processor really helped to mix it up too, by hand I couldn't get the tuna chunks small enough to absorb the liquid.  Family of 4 ate them all up.  Would make again.

I've had to go Paleo for health reasons and eating this way for 3 months now I needed a new way to make Tuna! Wow, I loved this recipe. I used coconut aminos in place of the soy sauce {soy sauce is NOT paleo}. I used 3 egg whites and 2 yolks so its not so eggy tasting. I also added a shake of ground red pepper to spice it up some. I didn't have to use a processor. I just mixed it up really well and it was fine. Next time I will try adding onions! Thanks for the recipe!

I made this and served it with an avocado salsa and it was pretty darned good. I've never eaten tuna like this before, and was surprised that it was pretty darned good. Thanks for the recipe!

I liked these. Served them in a high fiber tortilla with some fall harvest salsa.. I am not Paleo so I dont know if that was allowed on the plan or not. Either way. .. tasted good!
