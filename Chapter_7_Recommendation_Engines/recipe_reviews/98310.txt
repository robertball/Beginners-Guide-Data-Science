Apart from the hash brown this is pretty accurate. Our fry ups consist of sausage bacon tomato (whole canned will do at a push though fresh is the way to go) mushrooms egg (scrambled for me fried for Husband) fried bread and Heinz baked beans. I top my eggs with Heinz ketchup and serve with a huge pot of steaming PG Tips. Cheers!

A few things. It's important to use Heinz baked beans in a teal blue can. Also get back bacon from the butcher if possible instead of strip bacon. I worked in the UK for just over a year and greatly miss three things: an english breakfast a good gammon ham steak and a pint of green king abbott ale.

Delicious recipe. The British Fry-Up doesn't traditionally include hashbrowns; sometimes it's served with French Fries but definitely not hashbrowns. In Northern Ireland it is served with fried potato bread and soda bread. In other parts of the U.K. they use regular fried white bread (you'll need much more vegetable oil if you try this). Many health conscious Britons are now grilling (broiling) as much of this dish as possible i.e. the sausage bacon tomatoes breads. HP sauce is a must but ketchup is wonderful too.

Leave out the hash browns. Fry the bread in the bacon grease. Add black pudding or kidneys. Now your talking!

Very accurate rendition of a British Fry Up! The hash browns are "chips" or french fries here in Yorkshire and since in the US you don't have the Heinze version of baked beans use pork-n-beans. What is missing is "Brown Sauce" the closest thing in the states would probably be a store brand of A-1 to dip the sausage bacon eggs and potato in...lovely!

Just like I remember after living in Yorkshire for 10 years!! However I have never been able to find a good substitute for Lincolnshire sausage (my favorite!!!) on this side of the pond!!!! Fried bread is a must and I'm fortunate enough to be able to get Heinz baked beans and HP Sauce here!!

Rated it 4 because I changed it a bit. Instead of using oil I just cooked everything in the bacon grease. Also the second time I didnt cook the tomato because I think it was better fresh. Instead of hashbrowns I made potatoes from this site. It's chopped red potatoes and onions cooked in a skillet with butter. That's it. Thanks for the recipe!

Fairly accurate UK recipe. Leave out the hash browns. Add lamb or veal kidney fried bread and baked beans. I prefer a Portobella mushroom.

I have always appreciated the English breakfast plenty of pork and especialy the baked beans. I like the American hash browns also. Unity is a great thing. I just wonder if you folks really need a recipe for a standard bacon/sausage/egg/toast breakfast. What's next? Cereal and milk?

Well this definitely is a "Great" American version of a "British Fry Up"! This was a nice change up for Sunday breakfast. I left out the oil and chose to fry everything in the grease produced from the sausage and bacon. Definitely not the "healthiest" dish so I wouldn't indulge in this often and while this recipe didn't include the Heinz baked beans I opted to leave them off my plate as a personal preference for "this side of the pond" and served it with coffee and OJ.

Yummy stuff! I could not fit it all into one pan so I used 2. I did the bacon egg and mushrooms in one and the hash browns sausage tomato slices and red onion slice (I added that) in another. I forgot the bread slice in the picture so oh well. Be sure to season things up with salt and pepper as you go along;)

I'll give Cate a C for effort. Instead of frozen hash browns I use chips (french fries)--which are mandatory. Need good juicy English bangers too. Scottish bacon makes it not the kind we eat in North America. Cook the whole thing in rendered beef or bacon fat. Fry the bread in it until it crisps up. As a note scoff like this could be tolerated in Britain because central heating didn't really come into use until recent times and with the inefficient open fireplaces that people used and lack of wall insulation the body needed calories from food to warm up. Now we don't!

Im British and well travelled and there is no real one way of you putting your typical British Breakfast. All do have a few key things sausage fried egg bacon (any cut you like) and last but not least Heinz Baked Beans. However in England your likely to get fried tomatoes and mushrooms even in some parts kippers(smoked herring) but in scotland your going to get with your key ingredients fried bread tattie scone black pudding and haggis and in Ireland your gonna get soda bread and white pudding and once in Wales i even got cockles with my fry up ugh!!! Lol so to say one way is wrong because its not your way is to say all ways are wrong. Just know British Breakfasts are awesome

I thought this was fantastic! I did have to make some adjustments due to availability(snowed in pantry meal). I used cold boiled potatoes cubed and fried homemade baked beans crunchy crusted toasted bread leftover honeybaked ham and raw tomato slices.To me the over easy eggs were essential. That yolk in the beans! Oh my! I served it for supper with a big mug of steamy tea and my half frozen hardworking husband just loved it. Will definitely make this again maybe with some Spam! Oi!
