Healthy and very savory.  Used a quick version of Puertorican sofrito as the base- a puree of onion, green bell pepper, cilantro, and lots of garlic.  Will try it a little soupier next time since the black bean sauce was so tasty! Can't go wrong with this recipe.

Of all the black beans & rice recipes I've made, I like this the best.  I think the cider vinegar is the secret to this dish.  It gives it a fresh taste.

I have been making this recipe for at least 6 years since first finding it on this website.  I always add an extra can of black beans and use a full can of petite diced tomatoes for the tomatoes it calls for.  We LOVE it!  Made a very large batch for a vegan dinner party once, and they all loved it, too.  Many thanks for one of my favorite recipes!

I LOVE this recipe and use it all the time.  I do add a "little" sin achiote, it gives a tad more "spice".  I put mine over brown rice with a dollop of fat free sour cream on top.  YUM YUM

Sooooo good. My boyfriend is a big meat eater (but I'm vegetarian), and even he LOVES this dish. Last time I made it, he said, "I could probably eat this every day." It's just soooooo good!!! I prefer more beans, so I use two cans. Also, for ease, I just use a whole green pepper and a whole onion. I keep all the other ingredients the same (sometimes I toss in a little extra thyme and garlic salt because I LOVE the flavors). Anyway - this is delicious, nutritious and comes highly recommended! :)

My family really likes this recipe. It isn't very often that my husband asks me to make something again. It is very easy to make and easy to modify to your own taste. A definite recipe box winner.

i didn't add the tomatoes maybe that would have made a difference.  Too soupy and all i could taste was the vinegar.

I'm so glad this recipe is listed on Allrecipes. I get annoyed when I look at a can of Bush's black beans and it has a different recipe. Now I can see it no matter what! I make this all the time and it always comes out nice. If I have extra time, I use fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. Also, I may leave out the hot sauce if I'm making it for my kids.

Not bad, not great.  A little bland for my taste.  I read the reviews here before making it and used 1/3 less vinegar.  I could absolutely still taste it and I don't think I would have liked any more. Not sure I'll make it again.  There must be some zestier versions of this bean dish out there.  I'm going to try some others.

leaving a review to offset the negatives.  Have used this recipe for years and can only think the low-reviewers used too much vinegar, or whatever!  Never smelled-up our small condo.  We always use brown rice, so it's definitely a good healthy meal.
