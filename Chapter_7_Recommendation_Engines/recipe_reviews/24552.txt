I enjoyed this recipe- very authentic tasting and easy to make. I added a little extra salt to it and it was perfect with the golden syrup I had on hand. Maple syrup would be good too

This is good if you like anything low-fat.  I put butter on it, and it was alright.

Aussie Tip:  Damper is cooked over an open fire outside.  Find a long stick 1/2 inch thick.  Wrap the damper around it so it's about an inch thick and about four inches long.  Hold over fire til crispy on outside and cooked on inside.  Pull off stick and spread some jam on the inside - delicious!!  This is traditional bush tucker.

These were WAAAY better than I thought they would be, considering how freaking simple they were! I told the boyfriend that they were biscuits (and he's one of those weirdos that prefers the pillsbury junk) and he liked them! He hasn't liked any other 'drop biscuit' type recipe I tried. Little crunchy on the outside, but the inside melted in my mouth. Delicious with a bit of butter!

If you hate the taste of baking soda try using a bit of sprite instead. It will help the bread to rise and will taste 100% better!
