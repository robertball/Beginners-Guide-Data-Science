I thought this recipe was quite good but there are a few things I will make special note to you of.  I put the cloves in the apple slices as suggested, but I think I put far to many.  Next time I would just use a few.  Also I thought it tasted better to fill the glass about 1/3 full of wine mixture and 2/3 with soda.  This is a very light and refreshing drink.  Very pretty in a glass pitcher w/the fruit pieces.

Great recipe--my guests LOVED it.  Very refreshing on a hot Texas afternoon.  I used a cheap Italian Lambrusco and it was delicious--inexpensive too!

This Sangria called for way too much fruit and was not nearly as good as what I have had before.  It was better after adding some sugar...  I will be sure to try a different recipe next time I make Sangria.

This sangria was well received by everyone at a recent spanish themed dinner party. I reviewed many different sangria recipes and decided this was a winner-and it was! 
All guests especially appreciated that it was not too sweet.

I didn't use any strawberries, but I think you can use whatever you have.  This was a big hit with others.

I'm more of a white sangria fan, but this recipe was very good with lots of different types of fruit to add flavor.

This turned out great... I let it sit overnight in the fridge & made it exactly according to the recipe, except added a little less of the lemon lime soda at the end.

I used a couple of different leftover reds and it tasted great.  There was entirely too much fruit though, I'll have to cut back.  I also used Marcharino cherries (including the syrup).  Added a great favor.  All in all, definitely a crowd pleaser.

I thought this rocked.  I used a decent Merlot and skipped the strawberries and added cherries since that is what I had.  Using Bacardi Spice rum  I reduced the # of cloves to 3.  It didn't taste sweet enough so I added about a cup of Trader Joe's Cherry Cider and that helped.  I didn't use the soda, I just drank it plain.  I loved it but found quite a few unfinished cups while I was cleaning up after the party, so  I deducted a star.

I thought this is a good, versatile recipe for Sangria.

This was so EASY & QUICK to make up.  I brought this camping with a group of friends and it didn't make it through the first night!  Everyone wanted a copy of the recipe.  Thanks for the yummy Sangria!

I made this for ladies Bunco night, and everyone really enjoyed it . . . BUT, the recipe calls for WAY too much fruit!  I used like half of the amount, and it was still a lot of fruit to wine ratio.  You would need to add at least another bottle of wine to this amount of fruit.  Not a bad recipe, just needs to be adjusted, that's all.

Wow! This turned out great! Love being able to have restaurant quality sangriia at home!  I left our the cloves, and adjusted the fruit to what I had on hand, and it still turned out wonderful.  I tried to use this same recipe for white wine, and it was a flop.  I will stick to red on this one :)
