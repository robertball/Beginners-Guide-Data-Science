I wish I could do half stars because this was a 4 1/2. Such an easy recipe. We used spicy sausage which worked great against the sweetness of the fennel. The olives added a nice salty element into the dish but I think they need to be very finely chopped and perhaps a whole cup is too overpowering. Either way this is a keeper. Great way to get some fennel into the rotation~such a delicious veg and so underused! Thanks for sharing Chris Denzer

This is an excellent recipe. I wanted to make it as published, but realized I did not have any olives. So I skipped them and added chopped onions. The only sausage I had was hot Premio sausage, so used it instead of sweet. Still came out very tasty, and we ate it all, nothing left to take picture. Next time I will make exactly, to taste difference between sweet and hot sausage dish.

Excellent recipe. Served it over chopped raw spinach. Made the paleo style breakfast sausage from this sight to use in it. Thanks for the recipe!
