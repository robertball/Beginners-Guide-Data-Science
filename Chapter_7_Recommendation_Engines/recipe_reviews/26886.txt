This recipe was one of the easiest I've ever used.  The chicken wings were very tasty and moist.  This was the messiest chicken wings I have ever had.  I would not serve them as a standup appetizer.  You need to be in complete control or the salsa drips all over.  I used Ortega Medium and they were not overly spicy.

These were the best chicken wings and they were so easy to make. The Ortega taco sauce really adds a zesty, spicy flavor to the wings.
