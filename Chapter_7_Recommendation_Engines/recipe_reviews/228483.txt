I only cooked for 15 minutes and used frozen blueberries and they turned out great! These are way better then any Special K Bar!!!

Also If you use frozen blueberries make sure to drain them really well!!!

Great muffins! Loads of berries.  I subed out the sugar for splenda, and used unsweetened almond milk instead of the milk.  Got these bad boys down to 80 calories each!

I love this recipe!!!!!!!  I personally found it too sweet, but I have low blood sugar.  My daughter is very finicky, and she loved them!  She is into all that healthy stuff!  Her daughters loved them too!  :).   I added a little more applesauce and used organic whole wheat flour.  Oh, I added more vanilla too.  Oh, and I also added nuts to give it texture and flavor!  My English teacher from high school would be so disappointed with the sentence structure here!!!!!!  Lol!!   I am going to leave out about 1/4 of white sugar the next time I make these, by the way!   ;)

Made these for my mother the way I like them. Not enough sugar for her. So, I made them per recipe, with nuts and flax seed added. She loved them!

Positives: the flavour is nice, and they are low calorie.
Negatives: the texture is very chewy and dense. The "dough" was thick and hard to work with, and I had to add a lot more milk just to be able to get the batter in my pans. The berries burst and created a blackened, sticky mess in my muffin pans. I even used cupcake liners, and my pans were still a nightmare to clean.
Overall: disappointed and would not make these again. My kids would not eat them.

These were good. I made a few minor changes following reading other reviews. I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown, a little more cinnamon and a little more vanilla and used Almond Milk (amazing) Next time I make I will definitely use a splash more milk, reduce the sugar a little more, more cinnamon and more vanilla and cook for a little less time. My oven runs hot. Would recommend these. a great snack in the middle of the day to keep you going, calories for me were 96 per muffin could reduce this more with some more tweaking of the recipes. Highly recommend, thank you for sharing.

Absolutely loved these muffins. I picked up some blueberries this morning at a good price and decided to give these a try. This is definitely a "keeper" recipe. My husband isn't usually a fan of low-fat muffins but he said these were "low calorie, high taste". Really love the cinnamon flavour - and the intense berry-ness of them.

I baked them for about 17 minutes.

Great recipe! I only made 12 muffins with the 16 muffin recipe so it was very blueberry heavy. Delicious and loved by everyone in the family.

Ours turned out terrible.  There was another reviewer who stated the batter was hard to work with--I know exactly what she means, because ours came out more like cookie dough than batter, and the flavor was meh and the texture dense and chewy and not at all tasty.  We couldn't eat but a few, and it was such a letdown to throw the rest away because I *love* blueberries (plus they're currently close to 3.50/lb!).  I am a fairly decent baker, and I can certainly follow a recipe, but I must have done something wrong because we did not like these AT ALL.  Sorry :(

Love the guilt free muffins!!! I didn't have applesauce on hand so I substituted it with a tub of 2% plain greek yogurt. It seemed a bit too viscous so I doubled the milk. I also added some nutmeg, cloves, and allspice. Overall they were very satisfying and surprisingly moist. There were a lot of blue berries, so I would recommend going with 1 1/2 cups instead of two. Make these muffins, you won't be sorry :)

I was a little apprehensive to try this recipe at first as i couldn't believe this muffin is only 100 calories and would taste good too. But oh yes, it is good. Yummy!! The only change i made was that I substituted the sugar with Equal for even less calories. Yeyy!! Definitely going into my recipe box! Thank you sooooo much for sharing.

I changed some ingredients to 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, 1 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, and 2/5 cup milk to make them perfect! The calorie count changed to 158 calories per muffin but it was worth it! They were moist and very delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly except I decreased the amount of blueberries to 1 cup instead of 2.  I think 2 would have been too much.  I also made 12 muffins instead of the 16 called for in the recipe.  They were done in 15 minutes.  The muffin in general tasted good for a muffin with no butter or oil.  But it was a little on the dry or tough side.  I would make it again just for the healthier part of the muffin.

These muffins are delicious and I am so happy to have a sweet treat that doesn't wreck my calorie count for the day! I added 1/3 cup fat free plain Greek yogurt for moisture, and used unsweetened applesauce and increased it to 1/2 cup.  Also, I used whole wheat flour. I used 1/2 cup Truvia brown sugar blend and 1/4  cup organic cane sugar instead of the 3/4  cup white sugar. I added 1/3 cup light vanilla soy milk. They turned out just a little too sweet, so next time, I would only use 1/4 cup Truvia brown sugar blend. They were nice and moist and only 87 calories per muffin if you make 16 from the batter. Last, I only baked for 16 minutes and that was perfect.

I doubled this recipe using 1-1/2 cups white whole wheat flour and 1-1/2 cups of whole wheat flour. I increased the applesauce by 2 tablespoons. Added zest of 1 lemon and its juice as well as 1 tbsp. of lemon extract and used on 1/2 cup of sugar. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly, doubling the ingredients to make a double batch. The muffins are very good, however, not at all sweet due to the decrease of sugar I used. If you increase the sugar, you will have a sweet, yet more healthy muffin. I will make this again....and maybe increase the sugar a bit (keep in mind my 1/2 cup of sugar was for a double batch). Thank you for this recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly, and was very disappointed. I had a feeling these weren't going to work out from the beginning, as the ration of dry to wet ingredients is pretty obviously off, but decided to make them anyway because of the supposed low calories. The batter is not a batter, it's a dough, thick and hard the mix. It does not make 16 muffins, at least not if you expecting traditional sized muffins that fill the full cupcake liner/tin, and certainly not the size of the muffins in the picture. If wanting full-sized muffins, I would guess that only about 9 could be made from the existing ingredient proportions. They don't expand at all, so the amount of space the dough takes up, is the size your muffins are going to be. Very dense and tough. Way too many blueberries. I don't like the super sweet cupcake-like flavor of some muffins, but there were so many blueberries, that the slightly tart blueberry flavor overwhelmed any sweetness at all.

I cut the recipe in half and made 20 mini muffins that are only 27 calories a piece! I used unsweetened almond milk instead of skim milk and loved them.

Delicious muffins. I used less sugar and half the blueberries. I baked them for 15 min. at 400 and another 5 min. at 375. Loved them. Will definitely make them again.

Very good! I used 1 cup all purpose flour & 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. Added an extra 1/4 cup of applesauce because it seamed too thick. I will cut back to 1 cup of blueberries next time.

I am eating one of these right now, fresh from the oven-I used unsweetened applesauce, so I used almost the full amount of sugar, and I added about 1/8 tsp of Cardamom: The next time I will use half the cinnamon, as I found the full teaspoon a bit over-powering, unless you are a big cinnamon fan. After reading all of the reviews I went with one and one-half cups of fresh blueberries, which was perfect. Over-all I am thrilled with these. I also made a batch with 1 grated medium zucchini instead of blueberries, omitted the cinnamon and used grated nutmeg instead. Baked them in my muffin-top pan and they are awesome.  Store-bought low-fat muffins are expensive and taste bad:  This is an awesome recipe !!

This was a total failure and a complete waste of ingredients.  The "muffins" did not rise which I think is because there was no salt in the recipe.  Absolutely awful.  Should receive a: "no star" rating.

I think this should have been called a biscuit or something instead of a muffin. I'm a single guy trying to lose weight and cure a sweet tooth at the same time. Baking is pretty new to me, so I thought these would come out like you would expect a muffin to come out. They didn't.  That being said they are kind of tasty in their own way, but I wanted muffins!

I used frozen blueberries because that what I had. I also used coconut milk instead of skim. Used slightly less than 3/4 cup sugar and I think I could have used even less. I'm not a big sweets person. Tasted great though! Love that there's so many blueberries! I'll make em again!

Yes to changes. Used stevia 1/2 gluten free flour and 1/2 almond meal, used 2 cups blueberries first time and 1 cup second batch.  I live in NC and 1 cup of our large berries is better.  Also used applesauce in place of eggs since I cannot eat eggs.  After all of these changes they were very good.  Will definitely fix again.

I would definitely make these again. I doubled the recipe and added a few recommendations from the other reviews. I used 4 cups of berries,  almond milk (adding a little extra), added a little extra applesauce, and used half regular flour/half whole wheat, half sugar/half brown sugar. I added the zest of a lemon, a teaspoon of lemon extract, added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon, and baked at 375 for 15 minutes. My family loved them.

I would make this again. It was not as sweet as some have said, but that may depend on the sweetness of blueberries. The texture is a touch rubbery, since there is no oil added. But my hubby liked them.

Easy and delicious!  Next time I might change the ratio of apple sauce to sugar, with more apple sauce and perhaps balance with oats and less flour.  Either way....there will be a next time!

Great  flavour and texture. Only con is that you have to really stretch the batter to make 16 muffins. The recipe really should be for 12, but I was trying to do the 16 to keep them at 100 calories. Also 2 cups blueberries is a lot for the small amount of batter. Only need to bake for 20 minutes max

These turned out great. I substituted the applesauce for Greek yogurt  and used cashew milk instead of  skim milk and they turned out wonderful, to furthe cut down calories I used 1/2 cup of truvia in lieu of 3/4 cup of sugar, I find truvia to be a bit sweeter than sugar.

Unfortunately,I have to leave just one star because these didn't turn out good. The dough was too heavy and it didn't get nice and fluffy how it supposed to get in muffins. I have some experience with baking and usually I have no issues,but this time I just had to throw my time and expensive blueberries away :( sorry!

Not a recipe I'd make again.  As a couple of other reviewers have mentioned, the "dough" was very heavy, and it was hard to stir in the blueberries.  The flavour was great, certainly appreciated the lo-cal aspect of the receipe, but would not make them again. There are better receipes available.  We did eat them.....I refuse to waste food.

Okay recipe. Used cashew milk instead of milk, less sugar (1/2 cup mixed brown and white) and still only made 10 muffins (not filled to the top). The texture is heavy, but that is an okay exchange for an "un-cake" like muffin, which I prefer. If I make these again I will double the recipe and do some other additions.

This recipe is REALLY good, I made these for a party and they were gone within 30 min. Made a few adjustments, and it was great!
