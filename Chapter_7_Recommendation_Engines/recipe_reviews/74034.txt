I was a little concerned about the very short cooking time, but it turned out perfectly! The asparagus was crisp ans so flavourful and the sauce wasn't too overpowering. I may try it with fresh mint next time (I prefer the taste of fresh). Yum!

This was so good-- the cheese on top definitely gave it a nice tang. Everyone at the table had seconds!

Wonderful!! I was eating it off of the serving dish with my fingers! Both my brother and husband, who hate asparagus, were gushing over it. The kids didn't think a whole lot of it, but I didn't expect them to. Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!!!

I didn't have any mint but this was still really good. I didn't think 45 seconds would do much but it really does. Thank so much for the recipe!

I thought this was a great recipe (and super easy!) I used dried mint from my garden, so it was mixture of mints. I prepared the lemon/mint mixture in advance and had the water ready to boil, so it was easy to whip it up while the meat rested. One person suggested there was a bit too much mint, but that could have been due to the time the lemon/mint mixture spent sitting before I cooked the asparagus (It was probably sitting 4 hours or so). The feta added to it as well! Next time might be tasty with some black pepper added as well. Overall, great recipe!

made a 12 serving version - only change was I used fresh mint leaves instead of dry leaves.  Everyone really enjoyed it.  Yes I would make it again.
