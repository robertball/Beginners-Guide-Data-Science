Sofrito is the key to Cuban cooking! This recipe starts out right...Onion,garlic, sauteed in Olive oil is a must!No beer in Cuban beans-instead add cumin,1-2 bay leaves, salt(!!!), pepper, "bijol" if you can find it at your Latin grocer. All of these are to taste- Cuban style cooking (a pinch here or there- a lo cubano). :)

Did not care for this. Thought it seriously lacked in flavor.  I am a huge fan of Cuban food and this did not taste like those black beans found in Cuban restaurants.

This is an excellent quick recipe for black bean soup. I omit the beer just b'cuz I don't like it.  Also, I'd saute 1/4 to 1/2 lb. chopped bacon in the pan first, remove the bacon, & saute the veggies in the drippings.  This adds an authentic flavor to the recipe.

Very good! I found that using a little less beer makes it less soupy and more of a side dish. I also added cumin, some cayenne, and red pepper flakes to give it a little more flavor.

Good bean recipe.  I made it as described except with Yuengling and doubled everything and my family liked it.  If making it for myself I would have added some jalapenos or anchos.

We thought these were really good. They were a bit bland when done cooking, but once I added some salt, they were perfect. I liked that they were simmered in beer, which gave the beans a nice flavor.  I cut back on the beer, as suggested by another reviewer, but I ended up adding in the full amount. I let them simmer over low heat, uncovered, and they thickened up nicely. When ready to serve, I drizzled them with a bit of jalapeno olive oil, for an extra kick. These beans would be really good with cumin, chili powder, or chipotle powder added, or even cooked with some diced jalape√±o. I will be making these again, with some variations here and there.

This was very good...the flavor was GREAT!!!!! I didnt have the right kind of pepper so I used red pepper flakes and it was wonderful. Parts were a little dry but will surel make this recipe again. I will try not to cook it so long next time. I left it in the crockpot for 9 hours.

this is not a bad recipe but it definitely is not what I would consider Cuban blk beans.  Reviewer Maya hit it on the head.  Cumin is a must in Cuban blk beans, and if you like a smokier flavor, had some bacon.  Also this dish is served with long grain white rice, and a banana.  Eso es jama cubana

I made this for a large event - I used Maya's recommendations and skipped the beer, added sofrito, cumin and bay leaves.  It was excellent with the recommended changes!!

Very tasty! I put Barilla tomato sauce and a bit of some Indian chili sauce because I didn't have peppers, along with some drops of Tabasco. Whew! It turned out really hot but eatable. I managed to save it by adding more Barilla, water and rice. I'm sure if I follow your ingredients it will turn out even better. Will definitely try this recipe again,
