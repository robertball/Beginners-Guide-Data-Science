Dish was so good!! I didn’t have any poblano peppers so I didn’t use them. My kids don’t like spicy foods so it was fine. I also didn’t have pork so I used hamburger. I think it would have been good either way. I ate it alone but you could put it in tacos shells or burritos and would be great. Thanks for sharing!!

Had to add additional broth to finish cooking the rice. Adding the salsa and corn caused the meal to cool off too much. Had to microwave. Overall was good.

One of my 2020 New Years goal is to try a new recipe each week. So I started with this one!  I’ll make again. I’ll try it with brown rice next time, and I’ll throw in a can of black beans too!

A little time consuming  but tasty. First time to roast Poblano peppers. Not sure if I roasted too long. Pepper was very thin after peeling. I had to add more chicken broth as I only had basmati rice and it took longer to cook. Added a small can of mild green chilies and black beans rinsed. I topped with sour cream and the homemade salsa. In a pinch I think I could use a jar of salsa but nothing like fresh with cilantro. I would make again. Makes a lot with the added beans. Four stars only because it was a bit time consuming because of the chopping.

The dish sounded good except for the pablano peppers. I made this dish tonight, I served mine with heated flour tortilla shells.  However, the dish was delicious all by itself. I will definitely make this again.

Made a quadruple batch of this for a our large group on a ski weekend! Everyone loved it (save for one youngster who has an aversion to vegetables!??)

This is a very simple recipe and has good flavor even when heated up. And it is mostly cooked in one skillet. Loved it!

I was worried about the rice cooking in the oven. The rice cooked perfectly. The recipe was full of flavor and I can’t wait to make it again. 
I did cut the recipe in half for 2 people and we were full.

Super easy & delicious!
Used ground beef instead of ground pork. 
Made this for the adults. And, made a second batch but omitted the poblanos for the kids since the poblanos gave it a pretty good amount of heat/kick.

01-18-2020 update - made twice more for company - they liked it very much - sent them recipe.  Added a can of black beans to latest batch.  VG!


1st made review - good - had a personal problem - I didn't turn oven from broil to bake.  took forever until I figured that out.

I made it using ground chicken sausage and it was delicious!! And so easy to make.  I also didn't roast the peppers, because I forgot, and just added them in to bake with the mix.  It was still great!

My husband dove into this before I could take a photo. It was delicious. He said the salsa added so much brightness and added flavor. Next time I’d double the salsa. I used a SouthWest veggie combo by Birdseye ( or Green Giant ??) with cirn, black beans and peppers. It was perfect. I made the poblanos but did not use as I did not like the taste. I will try this again with chicken or ground beef. But definitely the pork again!  We loved it

This recipe is so forgiving it's worth noting how easy it is to adapt.   I didn't have roasted corn, so I used plain frozen corn.  I also added a can of black beans, a can of diced tomatoes and a can of chilis, instead of fresh, because I had it all in the pantry. All this went in before it went into the oven.  I also used jarred salsa to top it. It was delicious, and it used up stuff I had in the house. Regardless, the original recipe is very easy and very good. It's a keeper.

We don't care for peppers so we left them out and it still worked great! It has a wonderful zesty Mexican flavor! We've even tried doubling the salsa and making soft tacos with the recipe. Same great flavor!

Excellent for a family dinner.  I couldn't get Poblano peppers so I used orange and yellow - still good.  I am sure the Poblano would give it an amazing flavor!  Also, i had to use ground beef instead of pork but I loved it.  I hope to find both original ingredients next time I make it!

Whole family loved it! That never happens! I had some leftover chicken that was marinated in a carne asada (so I guess it’s pollo asada...? Lol).  Turned out great and got to use up some leftovers.
