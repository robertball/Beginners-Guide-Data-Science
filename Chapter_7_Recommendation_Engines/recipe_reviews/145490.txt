I've made these for 30 years, and twice in the past two weeks for parties. They always disappear! I never cook the sausage first, nor do I add baking powder. I also use less water. be sure to use hot sausage and sharp cheddar - the flavor is much better. Make the balls no larger than a quarter and the sausage will cook fine.

I modified this just a little and they turned out fantastic. I precooked  homeground spicy sausage till just about fully cooked, cut the baking mix to 1 & 1/2 cups, and added milk a tablespoon at a time to help with mixing. I used a measuring spoon to dip out heaping tablespoons and put them on a rack on a foil lined baking sheet, baked at 350 for about 25 minutes. They disappeared way faster than I could fix them! I tried them with the original recipe first, a little dry and heavy, but still good.

Been making these for years they are always great; and a big hit at parties.  You do not need to cook the sausage first, it cooks in the oven when you bake them.  Like others say, use hot sausage and sharp cheese.  I even add more red pepper flakes. YUMMY!!!

These were pretty good but nothing spectacular...they needed a little more flavoring, I added a little garlic powder and they were still a little bland, next time I will add a little more red pepper flakes and some parsley...

Very yummy!  I precooked the spicy Bob Evans sausage and drained the grease before mixing in the rest of the ingredients.  They ended up light and fluffy!

I've been making these for years without the baking soda and water.  My new variation I just tried today:  1 & 3/4 cups Bisquick, 1/4 cup shredded parmesan, 2 cups shredded cheddar and a couple shakes of paprika and garlic powder plus 2 T. water.  My husband gave this a thumbs up!  I will definitely keep the parmesan in for the future; it adds a nice little golden crust to the bottom of each one!

I just tasted one right out of the oven and they are delicious.  I used the Homemade Italian Turkey Sausage recipe on this site with some modifications to the recipe and it turned out wonderful.  Will definitely make again.

These are SO addictive!  I've made them twice and everyone loves them.  I used spicy sausage and sharp cheddar.  Gives it a good kick.  Will definitely make them again!  Definitely need to cook the sausage first.

Although these puffs garnered lots of praises at a church brunch, I found them to be very dry and greasy. I also had a difficult time getting them out of my "well greased" pan and cleanup was bad.

I've made this using both Bob Evans original and Bob Evans Zesty Hot sausage, and both times it was delicious and I received tons of compliments.  Note: this also works with fat free cheddar cheese!

I loved these! I was a little nervous making them because of the amount of sausage and cheese that it called for, but it was perfect. I used turkey kielbasa and put it in the food processor first. I also used a the homemade biscuit mix recipe on this site which I definitely recommend and used whole wheat flour to make it a bit more nutritious and filling. Will absolutely make these again!

My sons love these. Super easy and reheat really well. Be careful not to over cook because they will dry out keep an eye on them. I use my cookie scoop to make them uniform in size. Great dipped in ketsup, mustard or your favorite sauce.

I halved the recipe and used the ground sausage I always buy. I cooked the sausage first as recommended by another reviewer. They started browning in under 20 minutes. Didn't go over well enough to make again.

These were great!  Everyone loved them.  The recipe made a too many for us though, even when giving many away.  I will definitely halve next time.

I made these for some friends during a football game and I was disapointed.  After twenty minutes the bread was done but the sausage was not cooked. I left in for five more minutes sausage was cooked but the rest was dry. My husband said they were good but he's always really nice about anything I cook. I won't make these again. I gave them 3 stars because they didn't taste bad but they didn't taste too good.

Great snack to watch OU Sooner football I didn't have enough biscuit mix so I supplemented with Biscuit Baking Mix, from this website. I think the addition of baking powder makes these a little lighter. I used lean sausage and about 1/3 cup water instead of 1/2 cup.
