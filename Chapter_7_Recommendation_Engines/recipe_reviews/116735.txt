If you toss the chopped jalapenos in with the dry ingredients before mixing with the wet ingredients they will stay distributed throughout the batter and not float to the top.  Great recipe!

This was really good.  I used a small can of jalapenos and made it into muffins.  These babies were hot!  I used 1 C cornmeal and 1 C flour, because that is what I had on hand, and they were the perfect texture. **Helpful hint: if you don't have buttermilk, put 1 tablespoon of lemon juice into your measuring cup before filling with milk and wait 5 minutes.  It's an easy substitute!

Yum! I used canned jalapenos and regular milk instead of buttermilk because those are what I had. And I added a bunch of 2% milk shredded cheese for extra kick and calcium.
  I like that it has a lot more corn meal than white flour. You get more corn flavor that way, instead of using more white flour and adding whole corn kernels. I've tried a lot of cornbread recipes, but many were to tedious or took too many ingredients or were too fattening or too dry. This one is none of those things and I am content with it.

Don't seed the jalapenos if you like a little heat! If you seed them, there'll be no spice. I sometimes throw in an extra jalapeno depending on the size. Be sure to toss the chopped peppers into the dry ingredients. You can substitute fat free plain yogurt for the buttermilk (same amount). It creates a very yummy, moist bread. I add 1 tbsp extra sugar, and a few dashes hot sauce to the wet ingredients, a few dashes of cayenne to the dry ingredients and add dry to wet at the end, combining until just mixed. For muffins, cook for 18 minutes at same temp.

This was great. I was a little worried that the sugar might be a bit much, but it was perfect. It turned out nice and fluffy and spicy, just like I wanted. Thank you!

Excellent recipe, even after I substituted soy milk for buttermilk. I omitted the sugar because I do not like sweet cornbread and it was perfect for my taste. Also, I added extra peppers for more spice but next time I think I will include seeds for real kick! I cannot wait to make this using buttermilk, thanks so much!

Really good bread!  I suggest not leaving it for more than a day or two. It doesn't save well.

I'm not a baker so thanks for allowing me to wow my hubby with this recipe. The steps were easy as pie to follow and the bread turned out excellent. We had it with chili and brought leftovers to his work who gave even more raves!

I will definitely make it again tonight!

This cornbread is super easy and beautiful. I love baking this and wrapping with ribbon and presenting it as a gift. When I am able I use fresh buttermilk form the farm and the same with our garden's jalapeno plants. Other days, I just use milk and the tbls of lemon juice sub and canned jalapenos. Either way this recipe demands great flavor and is a hot topic at the table!

Not my favorite.  I like the richness that butter and quite possibly another egg would have contributed. In consideration of Hubs' sensitive innards, I used green pepper instead of jalapeno. I also added some shredded cheddar to the batter.

UPDATE: I have made this with the oil, and with melted butter. We liked it best with the melted butter.  I add the melted butter to room temp buttermilk. DH and I loved this rustic jalapeno corn bread recipe. I cooked mine in a 9" round. Will definitely make again, I will add more jalapenos and maybe some fresh corn off the cobb :)

I used fresh jalapenos and these came out okay.  They had good flavor but they didn't have a "we definitely have to make these again" quality or flavor.

We loved this. I used more jalapenos because all I had were jarred. I only used 2 T of Turbinado sugar, used WW Pastry Flour. I didn't quite have the full amount of buttermilk, so I added a bit of water. It was fantastic!

Thanks, Archie. A quick & tasty treat to go along with our chili tonight. Unlike the photo shown with the recipe the peppers all float to the top of the cake when baked - followed the recipe exactly. It would look a lot nicer if they were spread throughout the cake. However, it was delicious and I will probably make it again. Don't worry about the peppers, three of us agreed it is not spicy at all. The sugar must offset the heat somewhat.

I love this corn bread recipe and so did my family and friends. I made two batches. The first just as the recipe stated. I only seeded one of the peppers to get that extra kick of heat. The second batch, I seeded Two peppers for those who don't want the extra kick, also I added 1-8 oz can of drained sweet corn, 1 3/4 cups of sharp cheddar cheese, 1/2 orange bell pepper, and one finely chopped shallot. I also used 1/8 cup canola oil and add enough melted unsalted butter to make 1/4 cup oil. Plus I used 1/2 teasp. salt to the second batch because of the corn. This recipe is so delicious and versatile. I can make delicious cornbread without the jalapenos or add to make something a little different. Thank You for sharing this great recipe. I am also telling my family and friends to look up Archie Timmons on Allrecipe to get this wonderful recipe. Adding less flour and more cornmeal makes this REAL cornbread

I thought I had jalapeno peppers but didn't so I used one red chili pepper instead. I  like it.  The bread was tasty and moist but next time I'll make sure I have the right peppers on hand to taste it as planned.

This was yummy! Not too hot either, but a good kick and change from traditional cornbread. I did cheat and used Jiffy, added the freshly diced jalapenos, and then followed the rest of Jiffy's recipe. I added 1 cup of Monterey Jack cheese and cooked in a cast iron skillet separated for cornbread triangles. Next time, will make homemade CB, but it was still so good. Thanks so much for sharing!

Let me start by saying that I've NEVER made corn bread before.  I followed this recipe and it came out PERFECT.  The only thing I did different was pour it into a cast iron skillet to bake.  I was very pleased with the results.  And it was a big hit at the party too.  The texture is perfect, the edges came out golden brown, just the way you want them.  And with the seeded jalapenos, you get just the right amount of spicy kick, not green peppery, and not overly spicy, PERFECT.

Very tasty!  Used 1 cup of cornmeal (ran out) and 1 cup of white flour.  I used jarred jalapenos.  It turned out great and I will make it again.

Very light and moist. Not that dry "bready" texture that makes me dislike cornbread after two bites.  Followed another reviewers suggestion of adding the jalepenos to the wet mixture. Left half the membranes and seeds for some heat.  Used butter instead of oil and used my cast iron skillet.  Served with room temp butter and chili.  Everyone at my football party killed it.

Perfect recipe. Thanks for the suggestion of putting the jalape√±o in the dry ingredients, that made a perfect amount of jalape√±o in each bite.  Cooked this in my cast iron skillet. Preheated oven to 450 degrees, when oven was about 375 added skillet to preheat with a couple of tablespoons of bacon grease. Gave it a nice crunch on the bottom and slid right out of the pan.

This is a great recipe! I prefer a less sweet cornbread, so I cut the sugar down to 3 tablespoons and it was perfect!

Wow -- this is really good!  I followed the recipe exactly except for adding double the jalapenos (my garden was overflowing with them, so I needed to use them). Adding the extra peppers gave it a pleasant spice that balanced nicely with the sugar.  If you've tried this recipe before and found it too bland or sweet, then it's an easy fix: add more peppers!  Also, take the advice of a previous reviewer and toss the jalapenos with some of the dried mixture before adding them; it will ensure that the jalapenos stay nicely distributed throughout the corn bread and don't float to the top.

This was awesome...I added 1 cup of fresh from the cob, corn kernels, a cup of shredded sharp cheddar and used an extra 1/4 cup of milk and 1/4 cup of sour cream to add extra moisture and made muffins out of them...they were moist, sweet but not too much with a perfect  amount of heat from the jalapeno's....Great recipe...

Followed the recipe to a T (with the exception of 1 extra jalapeno) and it was OK, but we didn't care for it much and wouldn't make it again.  Biggest negative to me was the olive oil. The flavor of the oil came through very strong and would have much preferred a buttery flavor.   Texture was rather crumby -- didn't hold together all that well.   Lastly, Using 4 jalapenos (no seeds) added some flavor/interest, but we like spice and found it not at all spicy.  If you like spice, you would probably want to do as other reviewers suggested and use the seeds as well.

This was great . . . sweet, spicy and it managed to NOT crumble!  I did substitute canned green chilis for jalapenos.  There is NO way that my household would survive jalapenos - although I could!

This was good but didn't blow my socks off.  I chopped and roasted the jalapenos first, which I think was a good decision.  I would make this again but I think I'd experiment with adding creamed corn or a handful of frozen corn and maybe some chopped apple.

As other reviewers suggested, I cut the sugar down to 2 tablespoons and added some grated cheese (I used pepper jack).  I also baked this in a 10-inch cast iron skillet.  I was very impressed with the end result.  The corn bread sliced beautifully without crumbling and it was absolutely delicious.  Thanks so much for the post!

Very good recipe! I have found that it actually works better when you use the buttermilk substitute as opposed to actual buttermilk, for whatever reason. The substitute is 1T of lemon juice and enough milk to make 1 cup. Let sit for five minutes before adding to recipe.

Great jalapeno flavor!  My only change to the ingredients was the amount of sugar as we tend to like our cornbread on the savory side instead of on the sweet side.  I reduced the sugar to 2T.  I left the seeds in 1 of the 3 peppers and will leave them all in next time.  We thought a little more kick would be even better!  Definitely use fresh jalapenos as the bright green color they produce is gorgeous!  I also used a 10" cast iron skillet to bake in and it turned out great!  Perfect thickness with a golden brown & crispy crust.  Thanks for the recipe!

I DO NOT understand the rave reviews.  I made this exactly as stated using lowfat buttermilk.  It was grainy, dry and void of any flavor.  I expected VERY GOOD cornbread after reading the wonderful reviews but was disappointed and embarrassed as I made it for company.  I'm a very capable cook and this is not the first time I made a recipe from this site based on glowing reviews only to have the recipe turn out mediocre at best.  I'll stick to the foodnetwork, Martha, and Epicurious from now on for when I take the time to make a recipe from these sites a good review yields and good recipe.

This is a really delicious side dish for soups. chilis, and stews.  I used fresh jalapenos, at least double the amount called for, and it came out of the oven filled with flavor but not a ton of heat.  I am a terrible baker and this has turned out perfectly for me several times.

Excellent recipe - I took some hints from others - I used reg milk and added a tablespoon of lemon juice in lieu of buttermilk, sugar was just right, i also added some shredded sharp cheddar cheese in the liquid mix .. and oh, don't forget to mix the jalepenos with the dry mix first so they don't all be at the top ..

Wow.  Killer killer cornbread!  Only change was having to use pickled jalapeno peppers, regular milk, and baking in cast iron skillet.  Rose up beautifully - light, yet moist, with just the right amount of crumb.  We loved.  Thanks so much for recipe - will definitely use again.

I make this often to go with chili. I don't remove all the jalapeno seeds to keep some of the heat, and mix them with the dry ingredients first as other reviews suggest. Yum yum!

(I have an oven that tends to the "cold" side so I usually bake at 405-410 for up to 30 minutes so the middle bakes all the way through - I have done the toothpick test and thought they were done, only to have runny batter when I cut the bread for dinner! Something to keep in mind if your oven runs cold, as well.)

OMG! This recipie rocks the vote! Just made it in my Cast Iron Skillet & wish I would have doubled this recipie because it was sooo good! I DID NOT de-seed the jalape√±os, and I cooked 1/2 a small onion with some butter & sea salt till the onion was translucent, added it to the dry mix, then I shucked 1 ear of corn adding it to the dry mix along with 1/2 of a sliced orange, & red pepper and added them to the dry mix as well. This was very very nice looking with the green jalape√±os, red, & orange pepper, yellow corn, And the cooked onions. When I added the wet mixture I just folded it in and stirred it till it was all incorporated. Great spice, full of flavor. 10 STARS!

Super easy.  Cornbread wasn't spicy at all with the seeds removed, however.  I might try leaving in a few seeds next time.  We used muffin pans with this recipe and made cornbread muffins -- They turned out great!

I used self rising cornmeal and flour to cut down on the number of ingredients.  I also used canned diced jalape√±os that I let drain on paper trowels.  I liked that better than the fresh because the fresh didn't cook while baking.  I also added 1/2 cup shredded cheddar to the batter and then sprinkled another 1/2 cup over top.  Cheese makes everything better. :)

Jally good.  I made mine more Texican by adding one half cup of grated Monterey Jack cheese and cutting back the sugar to one tablespoon.   Be sure and use coarse ground corn meal.  Goes great with Chicken Chili.

An fyi if you don't ever have buttermilk on hand. For every 1 cup of milk you have, add 1 tablespoon of vinegar or lemon juice and let it sit for 5 miutes to make buttermilk.

What a wonderfully light cornbread!  This was super easy, fast and absolutely delicious.  It was not a dense, heavy corn bread which was a good surprise and the jalapenos added the most wonderful flavor and texture.  I made them into muffins for easy serving.  This will definitely be made again in my house!

The cornbread was absolutely delicious.  I made some minor changes...I used jar jalapeno and diced them into the dry ingredients (suggestion from viewer) and I added 1 cup of cream of corn for moisture.  This was pretty good cornbread.

Very flavorful recipe, but watch your cooking time as they get dry fast.  Terrific with a pipping hot bowl of chili.

This is a wonderful recipe.  It has great corn flavor and texture.  I reduced the sugar to 4 tablespoons because I like my cornbread a little less sweet.  I also grated 1 clove of garlic into it.  Yum!

If I could give 10 stars I would with this wonderful recipe. I used stone ground cornmeal and followed the recipe to the tee. It was fabulously delicious!! Thank you for sharing.

These were very moist and everyone really enjoyed them. I gave it 4 stars based on the opinions of others but I personally didn't feel like the jalapeno flavor really stood out though. Next time I might try sauteing the jalapeno first or using the canned variety. I think I'd also add some grilled or sauteed sweet corn.

I used regular milk and vinegar since our local market did not carry buttermilk. with the buttermilk i hope it will bring some moisture, in which case this recipe is a definite keeper.

I made this into muffins and baked for 18 min.  I will definitely make some changes next time.  I added all the seeds of all 3 jalapenos into the mix, and the muffins didn't come out spicy at all.  Next time I will add more jalapenos, and Mexican shredded cheese to moisten them up and bake for less time; these came out a little dry.

Fantastic recipe. I only made a few modifications: I ommitted the sugar as I do not like sweet cornbread, used only 2 jalapenos but kept the seeds (plenty of heat) and added about 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese. The cheese helps bind the dry ingredients and gives it a great flavor. Thanks for the recipes!

I made this for a NASCAR party last weekend and it was good but you have to like jalapenos. I think the concept was really good.   I made another corn bread from the site also and that one was devoured.

The best! I accidently bought masa harina instead of flour tortilla mix a while back. I scoured the internet trying to find out if I could substitute masa harina for corn meal, with no definitive answer. I used it in this recipe, verdict: perfect! I didn't seed my jalapenos because I like the heat, and I used the suggestion to toss the jalapenos with a little of the dry ingredients before adding to the batter. I've always used cornbread mixes in the past, but once they are used up, I'll never buy another one.

OK, I just made this,it is still warm. I made a double batch for two corn breads.I added more salt for our taste and added some cayenne pepper(about 1/4 teaspoon,maybe more)and added much more jalapenos, along with some of the seeds and veins. It turned out great! Oh, I almost forgot..I also added the jalapenos to the dry ingredients as suggested earlier and then I placed some sliced jalapenos on top of batter before cooking. It looks very inviting... The breads are spicy with just enough sweetness for us.....We are eating some right now....ummm. Thanks for the recipe!!!! :-)

This corn bread had a subtle jalapeno flavor (having seeded the peppers). I might add a bit more jalapeno, or perhaps leave a few seeds in, to give it more heat next time.

Pretty good.  I don't think jarapenos I used are very spicy.  
I used gluten free flour, almond milk and honey as I avoid refined sugar and gluten.

Made this the other day for my boyfriend & he loved it! I used 5 jalapenos & didn't seed them, only because he wanted the extra heat. Gave it 4 stars because the cornbread itself was a little dry.

I thought this cornbread was quite nice ... with a fine crumb (not the "hole-y" coarse kind of crumb some cornbreads have). The men loved soaking it in their bowl of beans and made lots of favorable comments.

Good, but I added a few things... I added cheddar cheese to it and as a garnish. I added a bit more sugar like 1 tsp more. I loved it!

delicious! I put 1/2 cup of cheese in this as well, and it was very good. My boyfriend couldn't get enough of it!

Oh. My. GOSH! This cornbread is wonderful! A new family favorite for a side dish. It has just enough kick to it.

Made this to go alongside black bean soup with a handful of changes.  I added a cup of corn kernels to the wet batter, used plain Greek yogurt instead of buttermilk and used whole wheat flower instead of white.  I also added 1/2 tsp of ground chipolte pepper to the dry batter.  This was a huge hit ant the diced jalape√±o and corn made for a lovely presentation.  Next time, I will increase the yogurt to 1 & 1/4 cup to add moisture.  Definitely a staple in my house from now on!!

This was the first corn bread I ever made and it turned out great! It was really light and fluffy, but was also moist (which made my husband very happy!).

I did make a few modifications: I only put in 4 tablespoons of sugar, and added in about half a can of fresh corn kernels along with the diced jalape√±o.  I cooked this in my cast-iron skillet which made for a deliciously crispy bottom.

Will definitely make this again!

Simple and perfect! I followed the recipe exactly, except scaled it up 1.5x; and to add a little more heat I laid some thinly sliced jalapenos (fresh, no canned) on top before baking. That last step made for a great looking dish, and since this is a good one for a potluck it will let people know it has some heat inside. I may try adding a little whole kernel corn next time, but this was excellent as-is.

I decreased the sugar by 2 TBSP. I added a TBSP of lemon juice to a cup of milk (and let it sit for 5 or so minutes) to make buttermilk, and baked it in a cast iron skillet. I've also made this without the jalape√±os and its good.

I made this to go along with jambalaya. This was simple, tasty, and a perfect side. I thought the flavor of the jalapeno worked nicely. Thanks for sharing.

The only changes I made was use melted butter instead of olive oil, whole wheat white instead of all purpose and a can of mild green chilies instead of jalapeno peppers, only because a)I'm feeding two kids with this and b)that's all I had on hand. Really good! My boys thought this was great, even. No worries about any leftovers because.....there was none leftover! Great with chili.

Great recipe! I love cornbread and this recipe was pretty basic just with an addition of jalepenos.  Next time i make these, I will try it with corn kernels and a little more spice in the mix.

VERY GOOD!!  I made this in a 9‚Äù cake pan, using some jalapenos from Hubs‚Äô garden.  I used four jalapenos because they were sort of small, and I included most of the seeds.  We didn‚Äôt find this to be too hot/spicy at all, so next time I would add more jalapenos and I‚Äôm tempted to add a small (2 oz.) jar of pimentos, drained, for a little more color.  Definitely worth making again!!

Absolutely the best cornbread I've ever had, and ever made.  I used a grating plate to grate the jalapenos, and I mixed them in with the wet ingredients just before I combined everything.  So very good!

Once again a good recipe. I was so tickled to make cornbread from scratch. I decided to leave the seeds in the peppers to give it that extra kick and it was delicious. I will never buy cornbread mix again. Thanks once again

I made some serious adjustments to this recipe, but it turned out fabulous.  I used 5 tablespoons butter vs. 4 T olive oil, 1/4 cup plain yogurt + slightly less than one cup buttermilk, 2 1/2 T sugar, 2 jalapenos + 2 chili peppers seeded, and 3/4 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  I melted 1 T butter in an oven safe skillet while oven was preheating and cooked the bread for about 25 minutes due to the extra additions.  It was perfectly moist, not spicy, and got rave reviews at a family get together.

This is an excellent corn bread recipe.  The ratio of corn meal to flour is perfect, yielding a bread that has great corn flavor but is not too heavy.  Also, it is not too sweet.  I like a good corn bread muffin as much as the next person, but I prefer a less sweet corn bread to serve with soup and chili.  I love putting cumin and cilantro in the batter for an extra flavor kick.

Perfect blend of hot, savory and sweetness.  The texture is on the lighter side. I added tobasco sauce to the wet ingredients and added sauteed jalapenos, yellow onions, green onions to the dry ingredients.

Very good! Reduced jalape√±o to 2 and used melted butter instead of oil. Didn't have enough cornmeal so I used 1 cup and increased the white flour to 1 cup. Reduced sugar to 4 Tbsp.

I used all the ingredients as called for, and it came out really well.  I intentionally left the seeds in to add some kick, and it definitely did the trick.  The only problem arose when I touched my eyes with my jalapeno soaked fingers.  That will teach me to ignore the advice about gloves, I suppose.

Will this corn bread recipe raise if I leave out the sugar? I do not care for sweet corn bread.

These are delicous. I've made them everytime I have chili since discovering this recipe. Thanks
