Really simple and easy to make and it was pretty tasty. Had to cook about 10 minutes longer than the recipe called for but it was delicious!

Good, quick and easy. Helps to pound out chicken ahead of placing in marinade.

I have made this a number of times and loved it -- except I used lemon juice in place of lime. it's easy and I don't need to measure exact the ingredients. thank you for the recipe -- simple ones like this are useful for inexperienced cooks trying to not to dry out the chicken

Really really a good simple marinade. I butterflied my chicken and decided to grill mine because it was rather warm here today. The garlic and the lime both shined in this recipe and I'm the "garlic" lady but I did grate mine over a Microplane so maybe that made a difference not sure but this is one I would totally make again.

A simple but tasty recipe!
I added more garlic than recipe suggested, chicken came out very moist and tender. A solid base for other chicken recipes.

I made this for my family last night. I'm a vegetarian so I can't speak for myself, but my husband didn't really care for it. It said it was fine but didn't love it. Based on other reviews, I put in 1-1/2 the amount of garlic but otherwise left it unchanged. Will look for another recipe before trying this one again.

Baked in a glass baking pan with additional marinade poured over the chicken. Put it under the boiler for about 5 minutes to brown it. The extra marinade made a nice sauce for the chicken.
