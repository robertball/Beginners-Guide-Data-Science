This is one of my favorites from Better Homes and Gardens 75 Years All Time Favorites Cookbook. You must use wine instead for the 2/3c broth for the best flavor. I also use Creole Seas. Blend from this site mixed 50/ 50 with a commercial blend. This gives you lots of flavor with less salt.2T of this mix, 2 cloves garlic in place of the shallot, 6 cups mushrooms and because the extra mushrooms make it wet only 1/2c of broth.The capers are a must! This is worth the extra work.

This dish was absolutely awesome!!!I did use white wine, because I love to cook with it. I sub. the first measurement of ckn broth with wine.  The capers make the dish very elegant and instead of using the jarred pepper I roasted/charred a fresh one instead.  One more thing, fresh spinach wilted in makes the dish sing.

I tried this again last night, several years after making it the first time, thinking maybe my lack of cooking skills before had hindered the outcome.  I was wrong, and this recipe is wrong.  It's not bad, it's just that shrimp and stroganoff don't mix well - even my 12-year-old daughter picked that up 1st bite.  There are FAR better shrimp pasta combos out there. Sorry, but this is just not right.

My whole family loves this recipe, it's quick and delicious! We make it weekly! The only changes I make are to use 1/2 white wine and 1/2 chicken broth instead of all chicken broth, and to use cayenne pepper, red pepper flakes, garlic and black pepper instead of the Cajun seasoning. I also use no-fat or low-fat sour cream and leave out the capers. Thanks Linda for submitting it!

Yum!!  Like some previous reviewers, I left out the peppers and capers because I didn't have them on hand.  I also used 1lb pre-cooked shrimp, letting them sit in the cajun seasoning (more than 1T) 1+ days before making the dish.

It seems I've been looking for years for that perfect shrimp pasta I could make at home.  I found it in this dish.  Very good.

This recipe was amazing!!!  I used portabella mushrooms which really added to the flavor.  I also used 1/2 wine and 1/2 chicken soup broth. I also left out the capers  It was a real hit with my guests and I have made it a few times now.

AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Make sure you use the red peppers, they add so much! I added scallops and doubled the cajun seasoning and olive oil. I also used a good quality fetuccini from costco, so good!

WE liked it very much, both wished there was more of it,  I took other peoples advice and used 2/3 c of white wine,  I also used onions and instead of the roasted red peppers I added some red peppers with the mushrooms and onions.

Well, I'm on the fence on this one.  Hubby liked this more than I did, I think.  It was good, but I didn't think it was great.  I think 6 oz. of pasta for four people is a bit skimpy, unless, of course, you're watching those carbs.  The sauce was thinner than I would have liked and the recipe didn't indicate whether or not to drain the red peppers.  I did drain mine on paper towels.  I can't imagine how thin the sauce would have been had I not drained them.  I also thought this recipe was what I call "fussy" - into the pan, out of the pan, into the pan, out of the pan - a lot of juggling going on.  All and all a good recipe, just didn't wow me.

This was really good! I couldn't find roasted red peppers so just left them out but didn't miss them. The sauce is fantastic. My husband doesn't care for pasta so I substituted rice.  Worked great.

Fantastic! Except for adding a 1/4 cup of white wine while saut√©ing the mushrooms and serving over medium bow-tie pasta, I followed the recipe exactly. I loved it and will be adding this to my favorites. Thanks, LINJO!

This recipe was quite intriguing to me over a year ago and I *FINALLY* made it! I happened to have everything on hand except the mushrooms, so I stopped and picked some up for this quick dinner. Result: We really enjoyed this! I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe! The Cajun seasoning gave just the right kick, a perfect amount of saucy-ness...loved the flavor and color the red bell peppers added (if you must, tomato could be a good substitute). The capers are a must - it elevates the dish and, in a strange way, made it seem more special. :) I wouldn't hesitate to make this again!

This is like a dish I order at French Quarter Bistro.  Now I can make it at home with fresh gulf shrimp.  For the Cajun seasoning I used Zatarain's Blackened Seasoning and it was to hot.  The second time I made it I was able to find Cajun seasoning.  Zatarain's was better.  Next time I will use a reduced portion of Zatarain's and will also reduce the amount of roasted red bell peppers.

I can't wait to try this with cream instead of sour cream. I think it will be better.

I omitted the capers as we hate them, and I used regular onions instead of shallots as that's what I had on hand. I've only eaten jarred roasted peppers a couple of times previously, and I have to say I'm not as fan of the squishy texture - next time I will roast my own. I recommend adding the Cajun seasoning a little at a time until it's as spicy as you like - 1T might be way too much for some people. Nice recipe though. Thanks!

This was a big hit in our house.  Not sure why some reviewers thought this was bland.  It's anything but!  I used minced garlic instead of shallots and light sour cream in an attempt to bring down the fat content.  I included the capers, but had to do without the roasted red peppers as I didn't have any.  Still, this was very flavorful; presentation gets 5 stars as well.  I used a combination of vegetarian chicken broth and white wine - next time, I'll be on the look out for reduced sodium broth and maybe reduce the amount of Cajun seasoning as the sodium content is a bit high for my diet/liking.  Thanks a bunch for sharing this recipe!

This recipe was very easy, and very tasty!  Instead of Cajun seasoning I used Old Bay, 1.5 tsp, and it was perfect!  I also substituted one small onion for the shallots.  What a great blend of flavors!

A little bit too spicey for us but that is easily fixed next time.  I just kept adding stuff to the mushroom mixture and added cooked shrimp at the end.  Yummy!!!

Used less cajun seasoning on shrimp as others suggested and added a little amount to the first broth, but still it was a bit bland. probably should have used the 1 T cajun seasoning for which the recipe calls.

Used 2 cups of mushrooms, onions and 2/3 cup of white wine instead of shallots and 2/3 cup of chicken broth. No peppers. Try original recipe.

I wanted something different for dinner, but didn't have time to run to the store to get what I was missing, so I made do with what I had. I had frozen, cooked shrimp, which I thawed and still cooked for the 3 minutes as directed. I only had canned mushrooms, but I drained them, and I used minced garlic since I had no shallots as was recommended in another review. No bell peppers either, so I just omitted them. Oh, and I used elbow maceroni, as it was the pasta I had in the pantry!   Overall, and since I butchered it, LOL, it went over well and my husband took seconds! Would love to try it as the recipe calls for it!

This dish was just super!  I doubled the sauce, and added garlic.  I didn't have the roasted red pepper, so I put in asparagus, which was delicious.  Another reviewer suggested spinach...I think I'll try that next time, and there will be a next time, because we all just loved this one!

this was excellent.  did not use the extra oil with the shrimp marinade.  also used light sour cream, no shallots, but used garlic. the sauce wasn't quite thickening up as i wanted so i used a tad bit more of cornstarch dissolved in chicken broth.  thanks for the post linjo!

I'm only giving this recipe four stars because my boyfriend liked it, and thouhgt it showed promise. I would definitly use white wine, slice the peppers into smaller pieces, and probably leave the capers out, unless you like to eat them on their own.  They seemed to stick out alot.  Using fresh peppers sounds like a good idea. I have realized that seafood and cream don't mix well for me. You may want to consider this if you're going to try this recipe. All things said, wine may make it a fairly good shrimp stroganoff recipe.

I used wine only, no chicken broth and would probably used 1 and 1/4 cup total, rather than 1 and 1/2 cup.  It was pretty strong.  Also, I added about 2 tsp. of cajun seasoning to the entire dish after it was finished.  
It's a good dish - great for a cold night!

This was a great recipe.  I used low fat yogurt instead of sour cream.  Next time I will try using a fresh red pepper (instead of roasted in a jar) and adding it when I cook the mushrooms.

This recipe was delicious.  Not too hot or spicy, just right.  I couldn't find the shallots, so I left them out.  It was perfect with a nice glass of Sauvignon Blanc white wine.

This was fantastic!  i would have followed the recipe perfectly, but was missing a few ingredients...used onion instead of shallots, and left out the red pepper.  Along with the cajun seasoning, i also added some italian seasoning...and this was very tasty!  i gave this 5 stars, because i know it would have been good without my changes.  The only thing i might add next time is some garlic bread to sop up all the sauce :)  I will definitely make this again, and the great thing is, you could easily add different veggies, etc for your own tastes!

Excellent recipe!  I have made it twice now - the first time I stuck to the recipe, and the 2nd time the main change I made was to add fresh garlic.  I minced a couple of cloves into the shrimp & olive oil first step and I also added a couple cloves to the shallots & mushrooms as they cooked.  In my opinion this gave it a more complex flavor that was just a little bit lacking the first time I made it.  But I am a huge fresh garlic fan, although I tried not to go overboard with it so as not to overpower the other flavors.  It was really excellent & very rich tasting despite using LITE sour cream.  As delicious as similar recipes that use heavy cream - just not necessary.  Thanks for a great recipe - will be making this one quite often!

Very rich and very good. I omitted the capers and added black pepper instead and also squeezed just a tiny bit of lemon juice on top. This was a wonderful lenten meal. Thanks.

This is a great and fairly simple dish.  I substituted one cup of white wine for the first 2/3 cup chicken broth, which added a nice and sophisticated touch and aroma.  Will definitely make this again!

I added artichokes to this dish only because we love them. This is a fabulous and easy dish to make. I did increase the sauce by half. I might go with low sodium broth next time because the cajun seasoning I used has so much salt already.

I love this recipe for one simple reason...i didn't follow it exactly to the specs and it came out wonderful...didnt have cajun used old bay..ran out of sour cream added yogurt and kept cornstarching it to my desired consistency. I used big big tiger shrimp, and didnt let them pink all the way on their own as this would cause them to become like little chewy pieces of tires, I let them pink on the outside and then cook through at the end with everything else. Thanks for this recipe..it's wonderful!

I was a little leary about mixing sour cream and chicken broth, but I figured I would give it a shot. Boy am I glad I did! It was delicious! The sauce was flavorful and 'calm'. I am going to definetly do this recipe again, but I am going to try it with chicken breasts. Maybe even both chicken and shrimp. Thank you for a new pasta sauce!

I had high hopes for this one but I was disappointed.  It lacked the richness I had hoped the sauce would have.  However, I used light sour cream.  Maybe if I had of used the "real deal" it would have been fantastic (if you are looking to cut calories, however, the light sour cream still had a great texture).  I used a really good quality Cajun seasoning too. ..and cremini mushrooms instead of regular white. I would make this again, it's just not as great as I had hoped.  I bet by adding a little whipping cream to it, it would have been great.  I think I'll try using white wine next time, like some of your recommended.  Or maybe chicken stock instead of broth.  The combination of ingredients is great though. This is why I'll try it again and tweek it a little.

I was rather skeptical after reading some reviews but found it quite delicious.  I'm not one for thick sauces so this was great.  I used some white wine along with the chicken broth and I didn't use capers since I didn't have any.  My husband enjoyed it also and has requested I make it again.

This was a delightful dish in every sense of the word.  I will use fresh red pepper instead next time.  The capers,in particular,allowed for just enough seasoning.  I will be making this again!

It was delicious!  I took others' advice and added wine (1 cup) in place of some of the broth and also added spinach with the shallots and mushrooms.  We also added more shallots (can never have too much!) and finished it off with lemon, pepper, and parmesan cheese.  We also used bow tie pasta.  I'm not taking away from the awesomeness of the recipe, just wanted to try some suggestions. Lots of leftovers. Highly recommend it!

Loved it as printed.  The second time I used seafood stock (2/3rd cup) and white wine (1 cup).  It made a big difference and won't use chicken broth in this dish again.

Followed other reviewers and used white wine in first part of recipe and used regular red peppers fried with the shallot and mushrooms rather than mushy bottled roasted red peppers.
Very good!

followed the recipe almost to the tee. used a sweet onion and green onion with garlic instead of a shallot since i had none. the shrimp had the right amount of bite. this was delicious and will be going into my meal rotation.

Wow my family and i loved this! I used portabello mushrooms and some white wine in place of the 3/4 cup broth. The flavors are very rich and the sauce was restaurant quality. Will make again.

Very tasty! I found it to be lacking slightly even though I doubled the Cajun seasoning and added a little garlic to the shrimp. Forgot the capers so that could have been my fault! Next time I'll add a little Dijon mustard just prior to serving. This would also be good with mixed seafood and/or chicken.

Tried this recipes for my family on Valentine's Day, it was a hit! I did make few changes. I used my own no sodium chicken broth. Added a tsp of cajun seasoning to the sauce, and about 1/3 cup of sweet peas, I did omitted roasted pepper to red bell peppers. This will absolutely be made again. Thank you.

I added more capers (1/3 of a 3.5 oz. jar), substituted shrimp broth for the chicken broth, and used portabella mushrooms. It was very flavorful and the juice was great sopped up with our toasted garlic bread.  We're going to change it up next time to make the sauce thicker...a bit more like alfredo. We'll see!

This was fantastic!!  I took the advice of others and substituted 2/3 cups of chicken broth with white wine.  The sauce was delicious.  Everyone like it so much that kept coming back for more.

Made this tonight for my husband and I. Tweaked it as suggested by some reviewers such as added 1/2 chicken stock and 1/2 white wine. I also made my own blackened spice which is simple. Loved it! Will definitely make it again. :)

i found this recipe awkward.  Nothing quite held the dish together.  Kinda tangy, kinda savory, kinda heavy and light at the same time. This dish was lost without a direction.  (in my opinion)

This was a hit with my family, including my picky 2-yr-old daughter. I used regular onions rather than shallots, and didn't have roasted red peppers. I also used Creole seasoning instead of cajun. I love that this is a lower-fat version of similar dishes - thanks!

WOW!  I made my own fresh roasted red peppers, and added in some fresh roasted garlic....this dish was so good and worth all the effort.  I like things spicy, so next time I will add more cajun/blackening seasoning.  I loved the capers with this!

Made this for my stepfamily, they loved it! Since they're currently on weight watchers, a single serving (1 cup pasta, 1 cup sauce) came to about 6 points. Everyone went back for seconds. I also used whole wheat angel hair pasta, fat free sour cream and reduced sodium chicken broth.  Adding veggies like spinach added good color and taste...this is a favorite.

Fantasitic!  I loved this guilt free pasta recipe!  My husand and I couldn't get enough.  I did leave out the red peppers and the capers because I don't like them, and we used fat free chicken broth and sour cream to reduce fat content.  The changes were mainly because this recipe that is suppose to serve 4, only fed us two.  We DRENCHED our pasta in this wonderful creamy sauce that didn't have a bunch of heavy creams or fat!

I made this for supper last night and it was inhaled!  Even the 5 yr. old grandson loved it (he does have a rather sophisticated palate, though).  I didn't have cajun seasoning, so I used Cookie's Spicy Seasoning and some garlic powder.  Guess I'm going to have to buy some cajun seasoning.  Great recipe Linda, thanks!

Instead of making the pasta and the shrimp sauce at the same time, I finished making the sauce and kept it on a simmer while i cooked my pasta.  Doing this really infused the flavor of the roasted peppers through the sauce.  Excellent recipe, gave a four  just because it doesn't deserve a five.  Quick and Easy and Delicious.

I didn't follow this recipe to the letter, I thought there was too much work in the cooking.  I saute'd the vegies all at once, added the chicken broth, watered down some cornstarch, added it to thicken, then added the shrimp to simmer.  I let the family decide whether or not they wanted sour cream.  I tasted the combination of the vegies and thought it was very good without the sour cream.  I had also used yolk-free egg noodles instead of fettuccini.  It was outstanding.  Even my 16 year old liked it, very unusual to like peppers in anything, but he did.  I will surely be making this again.  Thanks Linda!

This was a wonderful variation of my simple stroganoff that I use for all types of meats. The cajun spices gave it that little extra that made it unique. (I did not use capers just because I would have had to go to the store.)It was a little salty so beware what type of cajun seasoning you use. All in all an excellent additional to my recipe box.

Absolutely delicious...I used half chicken broth and half vermouth plus added additional capers because I love them.  Totally over-ate!

I made this dish for the first time with company - of all ages.  Everyone loved it!  I was somewhat worried about the spiciness of the Cajun Seasoning, since I have never used it before.  It added just the right amount of zip without being too overpowering.

My husband liked this better than me. I would only give 3 stars. I was just expecting something to blow me away and it didn't. Still good however and the presentation was very pretty. I followed the recipe to the letter. Should use the capers and the roasted red peppers instead of fresh as they both add something to this dish.

I loved this recipe and would definitely make it again.  I didn't use capers and I used fresh red peppers.  The sauce isn't too heavy and tastes great.

I loved it, really rich taste. It took long time to shop and prepare. But it was 100% worth it. The sauce came too watery I will probably use less than a cup of chicken broth next time.

Was  tasty. I used portobella mushrooms,so I had to add 2 T butter, because they don't give off much liquid when frying. I made without the peppers and capers because I didn't have any and served it over rice. Next time I will use the peppers. When I tested sauce in the pan I thought it was going to be too spicey but once you put it on rice it wasn't bad,but really needed salt with the rice. I will try with the pasta next time. Thanks Linda!

This recipe was excellent.  The flavour was great and the cajun spice is all you really needed.  I didn't even have to add salt which was great for me.  I would make it again.

Absolutly fantastic. Kids were gone and fixed this for just me and my wife. Perfect with a nice white wine. Sent this recipe to my in-laws with the same response. Highly recommend this one.

Delicious!  Excellent recipe.  It does dirty a few dishes, but worth it.  I used the individually frozen shrimp, which, when thawed and heated added liquid leaving my sauce a little runny.  If you use the same type of shrimp, drain the liquid after cooking the shrimp.  Sourdough bread is a must have with this dish to sop up every last bit of this delicious sauce

My new favorite. It's perfect as it is, but you can spice it up with additional Cajun seasoning. I've cooked it without capers, and without peppers on anther occasion for picky friends. It is just as good. The sauce makes the recipe. It's good to splurge on the best noodles.

Wow this recipe is sooo delicious!!  I used the 2/3 cup of chicken broth as stated in the recipe but used a cup of wine instead of the cup of chicken broth . It really enhanced the flavors. I also used black pepper and cayenne pepper but I like a nice spicy flavor. I highly recommend this recipe I will be making it again .

This recipe was delicious and easy to follow. I did add white cooking wine to the chicken broth and used fresh red pepper instead of canned which added a nice crunch to the meal.

Underwhelming!  None of us were impressed with this. The combination of ingredients just did not seem go together.  Any flavor that it had, Which wasn't much, seemed disjointed. I won't be making this again. A waste of some very good shrimp.

I decided to use my fresh pesto instead of using the blackened spices. So I would come up with pesto shrimp stroganoff. It was delicious. I did use white wine for the first reduction.

This was delicious! I used almond flour instead of cornstarch for thickening the sauce and added Cajun sauteed chicken cut up.  For the shrimp I used precooked ones  and just heated them up on the frying pan with the  Cajun seasoning (LeBlanc's Cajun Bar-B-Que Rub) on top.  Served this over fettuccine for the kids and on salads for myself & husband. For the salad I just put a little bit of the sauce on the chicken/shrimp mixed it up and put it on a bed of lettuce with Parmesan cheese and Ranch dressing. We all loved it!

I loved it .. this was so easy to make and my family really enjoyed it.
A few changes, i substituted the cajun seasoning for a blackened blend for the shrimps but otherwise like everyone else i added white wine instead of the broth ... oh and a bit of parmesan cheese at the end.

Perfect recipe!!

I use Pinot Gris in place of the 2/3 cups of chicken broth. My whole family loved the dish! It‚Äôs a keeper.

I did put garlic and oregano on the noodles because that's just me.  And I used both peas and peppers, but wow! this was delicious.  Definitely a part of my permanent recipe file.

Phenomenal shrimp recipe! I did sear my peppers before adding them and it added nicely to the flavor profile. Shrimp were perfectly cooked. A new favorite!

Good dish. A little time consuming and there is room to cut down on pans/bowls. Needs seasonings to be more than its inherent 'good enoughness'. I added some lite cream cheese and cooked the pasta in salted water and leftover lobster and prawn shells...made for very flavorful pasta in an of itself.

This is going to go in the favorites box!!  I used wild mushrooms and the first time I made it was going all healthy and used zucchini noodles, not as good as the second time with brown rice noodles.   I didn't take time to take pictures because it gets eaten too quickly!  I read the comments, thank you for those of you that made comments, it helped my preparation.  Reduction is an issue for me normally too but left it hands off after cleaning the bits up and the broth reduced quite nicely and the sour cream mixture got very creamy very nicely.

Was super yummy.  I'm allergic to shrimp so I used chicken.  I used "slap your mamma" cajun seasoning and to cut on calories used spaghetti squash.  Will definitely make it again.

This dish is good, not quite great, and somehow took a lot more effort than the directions suggested. I wish I had read more reviews and tried the white wine, as something seems missing or not quite right with the combination of flavors. Maybe it's using sour cream instead of something like mascarpone or cream cheese, and the capers don't fit. The flavors just don't meld. Hopefully leftovers taste better.

Edit: as hoped, this tasted much better the 2nd day. Lots of recipes take time for flavors to meld. Changed from 4 to 5 stars. Will be making this again.

I used a clove of garlic and white onion because I didn't have a shallot.  It was really good.  Next time I will have to cut back on the Cajun seasoning for my daughters taste.

Nice way to make a fancy dish. I substituted a weak chicken gravy for the corn starch and chicken broth and found it gave it more body. Also left out the red peppers . Next time will add some white wine to the sauce. Would serve to company.

This is awesome! I used the footnote suggestion and replaced the chicken broth with shrimp broth created by boiling the shells and tails in about two cups of water. Adjust the "heat" with the Cajun seasoning. I would add "season to taste with salt and pepper" to the recipe. We loved this.

This is a wonderful recipe, but where does the blackening of the shrimp come into play? I am a Cajun cook, and these shrimp should be peeled, deveined, tail off and put into a very hot iron skillet to blacken and the white wine added and a lid to continue the cooking, not overcooked. By boiling you are taking out the flavor and have blanched shrimp. Then proceed with the wonderful recipe.

I should have realized the words ‚Äúblackened‚Äù and ‚Äústroganoff‚Äù do not go together before wasting good ingredients on this recipe. 
 No one in our family liked it at all. I followed the directions as written and the best review I got (from the youngest) was, ‚ÄúMom this really tastes yucky, do I have to eat it?‚Äù  Answer: NO

Husband and I enjoyed this for dinner tonight. After reading reviews I did make some changes  just because I wanted to use ingredients I had on hand. 2 garlic cloves in place of shallots and Old Bay in place of Cajun seasoning. Peas in place of roasted red peppers and white wine for the 2/3 cup chicken broth. The last two changes were both suggested by the Cook who submitted the recipe. Definitely will make again.

I liked it made as specified. The only substitution that I made was added shrimp at end due to shellfish allergy and did half with chicken with same seasoning. Husband found to be a little salty will try the white wine option next time.

This is a wonderful dish.  We made our own Cajun Spice Mix (from Allrecipes!) using 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes.  For 4 servings though I would add an additional 1/2 # of shrimp and cook twice as much pasta.   The recipe as is,  made about 3 servings, though there was plenty of sauce leftover.  It was very tasty.

I substituted extra dry Champagne for chicken broth and frozen peas for capers, and it came out great!  Would definitely make again.

My husband loved this dish! The recipe is very versatile to what you have on hand. I used garlic instead of shallot. I skipped step 1 and added the shrimp at the very end. I added garlic powder, frozen peas, and Parmesan cheese. Delicious!

Easy to make and utterly delicious. Replaced half the chicken broth with white wine and it came out creamy, savory, and irresistible.

I did mine with shrimp and scallops. Also spiralized zucchini for noodles. Just the right amount of heat and I let my seafood marinate a bit. I saut√©ed my mushrooms till they were dry. Undercooked seafood a smidge as keeps cooking when move it to bowl with mushrooms and tented with foil. Really need to use the roasted red peppers (drained) and capers- it ups the level of flavor. I did use a Chardonnay for first deglazing and broth with the cornstarch and sour cream. I added garlic to my zucchini that is cooked for about 30 seconds and garlic in with mushrooms. Absolutely a top notch recipe as is or with my modifications.

I made a double recipe for 1 lb pasta.  Fettuccine is too heavy a noodle, especially given that this is not a thick sauce, in my opinion.  Use white wine instead of the first reference of broth and don't double the second reference of broth - the mushrooms add plenty of liquid.  Use more wine if necessary.  I also use more shallots than what is called for.

Due to a shrimp allergy I used imitation crab instead, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  We loved the combination of light sweet crab with the creamy spicy sauce and a pop of brightness from the capers.  The mushrooms and roasted red pepper ( I made mine fresh) added so much texture that every bite was interesting.  Thanks for sharing

I made this again at my daughter's request for a small dinner party. I used white wine instead of the first 2/3 cup of broth, and I added minced garlic with the shallots. I also sprinkled grated Parmesan cheese and some red pepper flakes over before serving (we like spicy). The capers add just enough salt and are a must! I'm typically not a fan of jarred red pepper, but they work in this recipe. We all loved it & they ate the left overs the next day.

I followed the suggestions of others and subbed in wine for the 2/3 cup of broth and the garlic for the shallots.   I found this recipe good, but not over the top.   I think it needed shallots AND garlic, but more shallots than just a tablespoon or two.   I also wasn't wild about the sour cream taste in the recipe.   I think with some tweaks for my own personal tastes that this recipe could be fantastic.

I made this with the wine as suggested by other reviewers. Glad I did because I think just the broth wouldn't have added enough flavor. It's still a little bland though, need to figure out how to punch it up. Great, easy meal though and of course, the kids love anything with noodles.

Fantastic! I seared the shrimp on high heat to give that 'blackened' appearance and flavor, and used a combination of white wine and chicken broth. I also subbed plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream to cut down fat and calories. Hubby's comment was"This one is a keeper." Served with side of oven roasted Brussels sprouts, delicious!

Excellent dish. Is a perfect cozy meal for a cold winter night but with the twist of having shrimp to keep it a bit lighter tasting than a beef/chicken dish. Only change was going with the suggestion of using 2/3 c wine to deglaze the pan after cooking the mushrooms & shrimp. The capers are a must.  This is a keeper!

I made this last week on Valentine's Day.  Of course, it's a recipe, so that means it's just a guide, right?  Used scallops because that's what I had.  It was wonderful!  We've been looking for a good pasta dish w/o tomatoes or tomato sauce but hadn't come across one we both liked.  I used some Mrs Dash instead of the seasoning.  A keeper!

I made this last night for a special meal with family.  It was five-star restaurant quality and everyone loved it.  I did tweak it a bit which is unusual for me on the first attempt but I felt the sauce needed the addition of Parmesan  cheese.  I also used white wine in the initial sauce.  Wonderful recipe, thank you!

Very good flavor. However it didn't quite have the kick I was looking for. Next  I'll double or triple the Cajun seasoning. Nevertheless it is now saved to my recipes!

This one is a keeper. Followed the other reviewers suggestions and substituted half of the chicken broth for white wine. I also couldn't find the roasted red peppers but I wanted the color and used sun dried tomatoes instead. I did have hubby stop at the store on his way home and pick up a jar of capers. The others reviewers were correct......the capers are a must! Yummy.....everyone loved it. Hubby was bummed their weren't any leftovers to take for his lunch the next day. I doubled the recipe, guess I'll have to triple it the next time. Thanks for sharing!

I didn't have sour cream so used plain unflavored Greek yogurt and it was tangy-fantastic (and lower calorie to boot).  If you want a change from Cajun Seasoning try Seafood Seasoning such as Old Bay Seasoning or Penzey's Chesapeake Bay Seasoning.  It tastes great!  For people who have trouble with lumpiness, I suggest whisking the sauce with a whisk during preparation.  It took out my lumps in the yogurt mixture.

This was okay, but I wasn't able to master the stroganoff technique thing . . .the sour cream sauce clumped up and didn't thicken (is it supposed to?  I have no idea), so perhaps it needs tempering.  Hubs liked it okay, and I just thought it was so so.  To be fair, I did accidentally over garlic it--used whole garlic cloves instead of shallots and I was a bit too liberal with the amount.  Other than that, I left out the roasted red peppers (don't have them at the moment) and the capers (hubs hates them, so I humored him).  We still ate it, and I don't think we'll ignore the leftovers, but we'll try something different next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is one of my favorite go-to recipes. I usually cook the shrimp in step four instead of in step three. I also add more capers since I love them. In any case, this dish is awesome and you should try it!

Made this recipe as written other than subbing white wine for the 2/3 cup broth and adding cloves of garlic in with the saute.  Really enjoyed it, has a wonderful rich flavor.

My sister-in-law introduced me to this recipe. It is beyond good; exceptional. She made a couple minor changes, but nothing drastic. I can imagine all kinds of variations. Also, there were leftovers and I fried a couple of eggs in the morning and put them on top of a serving ... For something a little different, it made a great breakfast.

My husband who doesn't care for any pasta loved this. Didn't have any roasted pepper so I just used red, orange and yellow bell peppers and placed them in the pan with the mushrooms and onions.  This was an excellent dish!

We really enjoyed this dish!  Substituted sweet onion for shallots and skipped the mushrooms, but other than that, followed it exactly.  A nice change of pace for dinner.

This would have been really good - without using so much Cajun seasoning!  I would suggest not using a whole TBSP since there is SO much salt in it!  The salt flavor really overpowered the dish - which otherwise would have been really good!!  I used white cooking wine instead of chicken broth for the most part (I did use a little bit of broth at the end).  I served it over gnocchi.  Didn't have any capers or shallots and didn't miss them at all.

This shrimp-pasta dish is very good.    I used blackened seasoning and substituted garlic for the shallots cause that was what I had in my pantry. I also increased the amount of pasta to 8 oz  and there was barely enough food to feed my family of 4.
This recipe is definitely a keeper.

We loved this recipe.  I omitted the red peppers as we don't care for them, used garlic and white onion in place of the shallots, and added parm at the end.  This is so good!  I would have rated a 5 but since I didn't follow the recipe as written I gave it a 4.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow, delicious!  I substituted frozen peas for the peppers and left out the capers.  My only advice is to serve this as soon as the sauce is thickened.  I covered mine and let it sit for about 15 minutes before I served it, and the sauce thinned out.  I had to add more cornstarch and sour cream to thicken it up again.  Still tasted delicious, though.  Thanks!

Yum! Next time I'm going to increase the cornstarch, exclude the capers, and substitute peas (or another vegetable) for the roasted red peppers. Make approximately 12 oz of fettucini noodles.

This recipe was good.  I used Zatarain's Creole seasoning.  I didn't use capers or the roasted red peppers, but it still turned out flavorful.  Don't get hung up about simmering down the chicken broth before adding the rest of the chicken broth and sour cream mixture, it didn't seem to matter.  I used a bit more corn starch then what was asked for to thicken the sauce, and used penne pasta.  It's a keeper.

My boyfriend said, "this rocks!" and he is known to be somewhat picky. I did have to add a little more cornstarch then called for. My cajun seasoning was pretty salty so I substituted some of the tablespoon of that with blackened cajun seasoning. The combo of spices was just right. The recipe is a keeper.

DELISH!  My whole family loved it.  The only changes I made are as follows: I omitted the capers (not a fan) and used finely chopped onion instead of shallots.  I also diced up two chicken breasts and coated them in cajun seasoning and flour and pre-cooked them and then added them in at the end with everything else.  It was YUMMY!

We thought the recipe was kind of bland. I followed it exactly. I might recommend using wine and a cajun seasoning that has a kick. I used Mccormick cajun seasoning.... really not a fan of this recipe.

We actually made this with chicken instead of shrimp because the shrimp did not seem fresh at the store.  It was absolutely delicious with the chicken.  The sauce is great.  I actually did not add any salt because of the capers, and it did not require anymore seasoning.

This recipe was absolutely delicious.  I ate leftovers for lunch the next day and it was even better.  I served some to my sister and she couldn't stop raving about it.  The only change I made was to put it over cheese ravioli and used scallops instead of shrimp.  I will most certainly make this again!!

My kids and I LOVE THIS! I sometimes use scallops instead of shrimp and it's even better!  The combo of sour cream and capers is awesome!

Found this to be good, but salty.  It's really not fair to rate a recipe if you don't follow it exactly.  I followed most helpful suggestions.  Otherwise, capers are salty and it really added to the saltiness of the dish.  I think that it was worth my time to make and my husband devoured it.  I do recommend giving it try and see how you like it!

Was hotter than expected, we both liked it, but said we would probably not make again, but it was nice for something different. Did not add capers, and used light sour cream to cut down on fat.

This is a KEEPER!  My whole family including 2 girls ages 6 and 4 loved it! The sauce was delicate and creamy, but not thick or too rich.  It coated the noodles lightly.  I made some changes because we did not have some ingredients.  I used frozen precooked tailess shrimp and frozen peas.  I sauted my onion instead of a scallion and added 2 garlic cloves.  I used the broth, then added the mix of cornstarch, light sour cream, and broth.  I had to simmer this for a few minutes for it to thicken (it was still runny- but perfect for us!).  Then I added the shrimp and peas and 2T of fresh parsley.  I served it with garlic bread and it would also go well with a green salad. Yumm-O!

GREAT! My inlaws just came home from a cruise..and this is what I made.  They thought it was incredible..and better than anything they had on the ship all week. (I think that's a good thing?!)  Anyhow..it was a big hit and I'm keeping it for future gatherings.

This is one of the best recipes I've found on this site. My boyfriend agrees! I changed a few things, but it would be great the way it is listed. I added scallops because we like them so much. I also cut out the sour cream to be healthier and didn't use any capers. I used a vegetable broth instead of chicken, and only used half as much of the broth (I read other reviews and decided to go with white wine--excellent) and substituted frozen peas for the red peppers. I also used a whole wheat spinach fettuccini. I baked some of the pull apart Pillsbury biscuits just to have something to go with it. We're ready to make it again tonight! Thanks for the delicious recipe.

I really liked it.  I thought it was a little salty, and I didn't add any salt at the end.  Therefore, I think I will cut down on the chicken broth next time

I made this recipe exactly as written and it turned out so salty it was practically inedible!  Maybe I did something wrong......Don't know if it was the chicken broth or the cajun seasoning.  I might make this again someday but I doubt it.

I fixed this for dinner last night and it was not only wonderful, but quick and easy as well.  I will definitely make this again, however next time I'll use angel hair pasta (personal preference).  Also, my grocery was out of jarred red peppers, so I used pimentos instead and it worked just fine.

Tasted good, but lacked something. I don't think the sour cream/cornstarch mixture adds the right richness to the dish. I'd make it again, but add cheese or something to it.

Very creative and tastes great, too. I also used fat free sour cream which worked out well. Had a great spice to it from cajun seasoning. Try it.

Great dish! My family loved it. To reduce the fat, I used a good quality fat-free sour cream.
