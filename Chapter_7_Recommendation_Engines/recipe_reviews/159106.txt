Hi, this is my own recipe so I thought I'd share a suggestion I left out. This recipe is similar to those for rum balls, so I thought I'd pass on this tip I learned making those: if the mixture seems too sticky to form balls, chilling it for a bit first helps a ton.

Used a Sin Zin to make this for a Zinfendel tasting ... everyone LOVED them and wanted the recipe.

Someone left a bottle of Yellow Tail Cabernet at my house and I really prefer sweeter wine so I didn't want to drink it. I didn't want to waste it either so I tried this out, and it wasn't good at all. Maybe it's because I don't like this kind of wine, but it just wasn't good. I would suggest using more vanilla wafers too, if you want to be able to form anything out of the mixture.

I've made these a few times and they are always a hit with wine lovers. This time I used store brand vanilla wafers and the batter seemed too dry so I added a bit more corn syrup and wine. I used a cookie scoop to portion the balls before rolling them by hand and that worked well.
