I used a homemade lowfat creamy italian dressing in this dish and cubed provolone, only because I didn't have the other cheezes on hand. To fill it out just a little, I threw in one peeled and cubed cucumber. My husband and kids really liked this pasta salad--the leftovers that were in the fridge after dinner were eaten late last night by my husband.

Loved this recipe!  I made a few changes, I omitted the cheese because I personally am not a fan of blue cheeses.  I used a Fat Free Ceasar Italian dressing that is great.  This salad is amazing, definitely a go to lunch meal, it was easy to make and very quick.  I am excited to eat the left overs for lunch tomorrow!

I was looking for a cold pasta salad recipe and was lucky enough to stumble upon this one.  I used 2 small diced roma tomatoes instead of cherry tomatoes because that's what I had, but other than that, made per the directions.  The only thing I would do different next time is double the recipe because it is that good!

very easy and yummy!   I added some sliced olives and made my own Italian dressing with 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil, 1/4 cup red wine vinegar, 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, 1 tsp Italian seasoning.
