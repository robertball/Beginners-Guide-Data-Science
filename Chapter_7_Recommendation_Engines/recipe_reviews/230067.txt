Wow!  How has this not been reviewed yet? I discovered this recipe last Thanksgiving and my sweet potato-hatin' husband actually requested it again this year. He said it "Wasn't bad for sweet potatoes." High praise, indeed! Everyone loved it and the dish was scraped clean. I made it exactly as written.

Super simple and tasty recipe. We added a sprinkling of cinnamon over the potatoes before adding the maple syrup / butter mixture. My husband and son said it was good but asked for some chopped nuts with brown sugar topping next time.

It was easy and very tasty. I didn't have very much maple syrup so I used an artisan spiced chai honey instead. I also substituted half & half because I didn't have any milk. I topped it off with some cinnamon and the few drops of maple syrup and I got rave reviews! I loved that there were only 4 or 5 ingredients too!
