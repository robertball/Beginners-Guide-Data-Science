I didn't make the salmon, but I am sure it wonderful. I make the carmelized leeks and carrots for another dish......They were the favorite item on eveyones plate! They are a keeper!

5-Stars for sure! Anyone who rates it less simply cannot cook.  I made this for myself and my girlfriend and, suffice it to say, it was a hit!

I have used this recipe a few times with and without the salmon.  5 stars every time. What can I say about these leeks?  They cook up beautifully with the carrots and the smell is outstanding.

I tried this tonight with my first attempt at cooking with leeks. I added some balsamic vinegar to the carrot & leek mixture and it came out superbly! Thanks!

Was good, but not sure its a 5 star.  Cooking time for leeks specified is way too long.  Also the leeks carrots need for liquid or sauce to compliment the salmon.  Salmon was cooked well, but needed something.

I made this recipe exactly as it is and it turned out very delicious! This is the first time I used leeks and they bring a very good sweet onion flavor to the dish and complement the salmon very well. I am happy with how this turned out and will definitely make this again.

Quite good - VERY easy.  I lightly sprinkled the brown sugar and was happy with the amount.  Too much and it would be too sweet.  But all in all, a tasty dish, easy to make and a great way to use your leeks!

The flavors work so well together and it's a super simple/healthy recipe.  Used frozen leeks I had on hand and put everything over some quinoa.  Perfect dinner, definitely a keeper!!

What did I do wrong???  Too high heat?  Cooked the leeks too long?  they were black and crispy, even though I followed the instructions. Will have to try this again...

The star of the show are the leeks. I never knew what the heck leeks were but I am now a fan. The leek/carrot combination with the butter/brown sugar is only half the joy of this dish. The way the leeks crisp up a bit in the oven sends them over the top. The baked salmon is a really just a backdrop to the veggies. Superb!

Super easy! Make the salmon the way you like it. I kept it simple with garlic, salt and pepper. I used three leeks and about a half cup of pre shredded carrots. Added a table spoon of butter and increased the brown sugar about half a tbsp. Paired with a spinach salad with vinaigrette. So good and not too sweet!

I loved the caramelized leeks and carrots, but I didn't care for the suggested seasoning for the salmon.  I'll keep the recipe for the leeks, but I'm going to stick with my tried-and-true salmon seasoning.

i'm gonna go ahead and review this recipe despite the fact that i made some wholesale changes in the method and slight changes in the ingredients.

in order to get crispy skin, i seared the salmon in a medium-high skillet until the skin was nice and crisp. the pan and oil are hot enough to add the salmon when you start to see whisps of smoke. you may want to reduce the heat slightly once you add the filets.
once properly seared, i removed them to a baking sheet and baked in a preheated oven at 400 degrees for 15 minutes. after that i removed the pan from the oven, tented them with foil from the sheet and let them rest for a few minutes.
for the leeks, i used the same pan in which i seared the salmon, but reduced the heat to medium. i also omitted the carrots, brown sugar and butter, as leeks are naturally sweet once caramelized. i added diced shallots, minced garlic and deglazed the pan with 2Tbl balsamic vinegar, which i reduced.
the result of all this was moist and tender salmon with crispy skin and sweet and slightly tangy leeks that make a great topping. i served with orzo and wilted spinach for a great meal.

Like some of the other reviewers, I also skipped cooking the salmon. Instead I made just the leeks and carrots and these were really good! Even my picky husband went back for seconds and he doesn't like leeks. Thanks for a great and yummy side.

When leeks are in season this is one of my favorite dishes to make. I love the sweetness of the onions and leeks. Whole family enjoys this dish.

Great dish! I loved it. I didn't follow the exact cooking time for the leeks though. I put them in the pan, salted them and covered with a lid. They softened within 10mins. I added the carrots and brown sugar. I added about 3 teaspoons of brown sugar and sprinkled with salt 3-4 times. I took it off the stove just when the carrots began to lighly soften up, about another 5-1mins. Everyone loved it. =]

Made this for my friends Birthday dinner.  My friend is super picky and does not eat many veggitables. She could not stop raving about the leeks and carrots. She said that if she could "yelp" it she would give it 5 stars, so I am giving this recipe that here. (I used less leek because I only had two. To the salmon, I added juice from half a lemon and a little soy sauce instead of salt.)

I doubled (maybe next time I will triple)the topping (leeks, carrots, brown sugar and butter). It turned out perfect and tasted wonderful. We will have this dish often.

I followed the recipe for the leeks and carrots exactly, and though I enjoyed the combination, somehow it was visually unappealing on the plate.  I brushed the salmon filets with olive oil, added two thin lemon slices each, sprinkled with salt and grilled on a plank.  I felt the salmon needed the lemon slices.  The combination of flavors was good.  So often salmon recipes are sweet, and with the sweet flavor of the vegetables, sweet salmon would have been too much.

Definitely a keeper! Didn't change a thing with the leeks and carrots, but did add a bit more seasoning to the salmon. I plan to serve this the next time we have guests.

Love this ! Have made it many times and get ohs and ahs! Last time I took a bunch of raw spinach, and placed it last minute over the leeks and carrots. turned off flame, and let it sit there a bit. i loved how the green added a lot of color and tons of nutrition!

The salmon is basic and nothing extraordinary but salmon is just darn tasty with nothing more than salt and pepper and a little oil. The leek/carrot mixture was also tasty but the leeks were chewy and I cooked the heck out of them. Next time I will peel off more outer layers and cook longer.

This was a delightful treat to have. I've made some minor adjustments: instead of cutting a carrot , I've used store-brought matchstick carrots to save me time. I've used frozen salmon from Aldis's instead of fresh. But it tasted real well. I'll make it again for sure.

This underrated recipe is an awesome change from standard recipes. I did top the salmon with parmesan - a lot.  Yum!

I made it, easy enough, and turned out beautifully! My wife has been the major food preparer, however, as I get used to retirement, I’m learning my way around a cookbook, and she claims this is a keeper! No changes required!

Simply amazing! This tastes like something you would order at a high end restaurant.  I highly recommend this dish. I made a few slight changes. First I baked the salmon at 350 degrees instead of 425.  I seasoned the fish with a bit of garlic, salt, pepper and lemon juice. I added fresh chopped ginger to the leeks and carrots. I plated it on a bed of brown rice, then the  veggies and the salmon on top. Delicious!  I will be making this again!!

I upped the sugar a bit and added 2 mini bell-peppers sliced. I didnt have any olive oil so I used argan cooking oil and paprika when seasoning the salmon and baked for 15-20 minutes at 400 degrees.

I've made this a few times and love it.  I do season the salmon with rosemary and basil and add cherry tomatoes to the leaks and carrots.

WOW- apparently I love leeks.  Followed exactly and was delicious.  My husband hates carrots but mixed with these delicious leeks, he wanted seconds!

The leeks/carrots were outstanding - added some mushrooms and made it all the better -- only thing I changed was to make the salmon using another recipe - " Slammin Salmon" which you can find on the All Recipes site -- made an outstanding combination.

Those leeks were KILLER. I plan on making that part of the recipe all the time as a side dish. I couldn't stop myself from stealing tastes out of the pan while they were cooking! They went great with the salmon, but the topping was the total star.

This was tasty! My fam likes it better with a teriyaki sauce, but I liked this for a change every once in a while
