Wow, I am diabetic and made this exactly as the recipe states except substituted Splenda for the sugar and also added an extra half cup of coconut as some reviewers suggested. I also poured 2 tbs of fozen raspberries with the juice from some frozen raspberries I had defrosted on to the top of the pie before I put it in the oven. Feeling artistic I drizzeled the juice and few frozen raspberries onto the top of the coconut custard pie in a little pattern AND this thing was UNBELIEVABLE.  I had to take my blood sugar again two and a half hours later to see I had made a mistake. This desert hardly moved my blood sugar up at all. It was 117 at an hour and a half after eating 1/3 of the pie and 119 two and a half hours afterward. I get five times that rise on one bagel. I really recommend this desert for anyone who is watching their diet and loves good food. The taste is to die for and the food impact is to not have to die for good deserts, even if you are a diabetic. Thanks Jo Pelletier.

This is a very good pie.  I would suggest leaving the ingredients just the way they are and baking the pie for 40-45 minutes.  My pie wasn't set in the center when I checked it at 35 minutes.  Good warm or cold.  Thanks for sharing.

Oh my Lord this was good. I was looking for a custard that didn't have to be baked in a water bath or cooked on the stove and this was exactly what I had hoped to find. It smelled so good, we couldn't wait to chill it. So we had some warm. The next day, we were as equally thrilled to eat it cold. It was to die for. Thumbs up!

As usual, the simpler the better.  So goes with this.  I did add a bit more coconut probably 1/2 cup - just to use the last of it.

Delicious! and so easy. I loved this recipe, will make it a part of my repertoire. The only thing is, it's a little mushy to scoop out of a pie pan. I might cook this next time in a ramekin. Definately a keeper!

Very nice!  Found this after doing a search to use up some coconut.  After reading the other reviews and noticing that a few commented on the filling being runny and the bake time being too short, I dumped in an extra cup of coconut and baked for 45 minutes.  Set perfectly and a whole lotta coconut to enjoy!

This was great.  I added an extra cup of coconut.  I probably wouldn't flour the dish next time.  I wonder how this would do in the coconut crust recipe on this site???

Oh my goodness, I can't get enough of this! I've made this, three times now, with a couple changes. I do not care for the taste of evaporated milk so I replaced the 12 ounces of evaporated milk with 6 ounces of heavy cream and 6 ounces of whole milk. I also added 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract, 1/4 teaspoon pure almond extract, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg. (I use only Spice Islands spices. Some of this brand's products are a bit pricey but they really do make the difference!) This pie is so rich and creamy - almost like coconut flan. Very simple. Just follow instructions and it turns out perfect every time!

Is it just me or does the photo look like the pie has a crust? I'm glad one review stated it was a crustless pie-they need to use an ACTUAL photo.

I was looking for a great recipe which was similiar to Entermans that I could make myself using organic ingredients. This is it!!! I put it in a crust, and make sure not to add additional coconut. I added extra coconut once and it didnt turn out the same. One cup is perfect and allows the cocount flakes to float to the top and form a nice crust. Use freshly shaved organic coconut for the real deal (supermarket brands are dry and bland compared to fresh).

I just made this today for a family dinner.  This recipe is so easy and tastes wonderful.  Everyone at dinner was asking for seconds.  I followed the recipe and added 1/2 cup more of coconut and 1/4 tsp of coconut extract.
Will definately make this again.
Thanks

Great Pie! I have made it a number of times for my wife and I. Easy and great flavor. The advice of baking 45 minutes and adding 1 and a half cups of coconut by other reviewers is good advice. I made one pie  leaving out the coconut and grating in a teaspoon of nutmeg and made a great plain custard pie.  This is simple to make and will please a lot of people.

I love this recipe!! I mixed it all together except for the coconut, poured it into my greased and floured pyrex, then I sprinkled 1c. of coconut over the top and gently tapped it into the custard with the back of a fork until it sunk down a bit. Baked for 45 min. and it turned out with a beautiful golden crust on top. I let it cool before cutting it, and it came out of the pie plate with no trouble at all. Thank-you for sharing such a great recipe!!!!! The flavor and texture were perfect!

Love it!  I'm a diabetic and followed the advice of another diabetic 'rater' making it with Splenda, adding 1/2 c more coconut plus some frozen raspberries and baked for 45 min.  it came out perfect, even my husband had some & he's not diabetic.  Next time I'm going to add more raspberries, they really added a nice flavour & it looked pretty enough to serve to company.

DELICIOUS!  Our family loves coconut and this was so good!  Super easy to make!  I really like that it is crustless as well.  We often make pumpkin pie without the crust because my husband isn't a huge crust fan! Will definitely make again! Thanks Jo for a great recipe :-)

The taste reminded me of a large macaroon cookie.  Everyone liked it.  I garnished with maraschino cherries.

This pie is AWESOME!!! It has such a great creamy custard taste! The coconut floats to the top and gets nice and golden! I did have to cook it about 50 minutes before it was set in the center. The taste is good when it's warm, but is amazing once it gets cold!! Made it just as written with the exception of cook time! I will try to make it with Splenda as suggested, but only for my diabetic family members. I want mine just as it is! Thank you for this AWESOME recipe!

Think custard pie with a floating coconut top. But don't think coconut pie or even flavor. I added 1/2 cup more coconut and it really was indifferent to the taste but over flowed my 9 inch graham cracker crust. This was deliious both warm and cold.

Very good -- actually better than I expected.  Tastes great with fruit toppings.  I made one with homemade cranberry sauce on top, and another with a caramel/walnut/coconut topping.  The sky is the limit.  (Well, I made one with pineapple that wasn't so good... )

So Good!!  This was so easy and it turned out perfectly. We all loved it. It did take longer to bake in my oven. I think the recipe needs a new title as it's not just a Mother's Day Pie.  The word coconut needs to be  in the title when people search for coconut recipes.  Thanks for posting this little gem!!

This didnt really do anything for me or my coconut loving fiance. I added another 1/2 cup of coconut but it still lacked enough and the taste was a little bland.

great pie! I have never made a crust less pie before and was skeptical as to how it would slice out of the plate.  The pie cuts were beautiful and it tasted like a giant macaroon.  I will make this again when my mom comes to visit.   I may trying to reduce the amount of sugar next time.  many thanks Jo

Absolutely delicious! Definitely keeping this recipe on file. I made two 9 inch pies with this recipe and added a little more than 1 cup of coconut. Tried it both hot and cold and all I can say is DELISH!!

I made this for my mom on Mother's Day and she loved it! It was fluffy and I drizzled raspberry juice on it and it was amazing! If a 14 year old boy can make this perfectly anyone can.

I substituted the evaporated milk for sweetened condensed milk and left out the cup of sugar, as I could not find any evaporated milk here. It turned out so delicious that I'll be making it again and again. As decoration/topping I whipped a package of cream with half a teaspoon Pandan flavoured green paste and 1 spoon of sugar. Thanks for this GREAT recipe.

Delicious! I was craving Coconut custard pie and this satisfied my craving.  Quick and easy.  The only thing I did differently was to substitute half the evaporated milk with coconut milk just because I had it on hand.  One of my new favorite recipes.

This pie is just so amazing! It's incredibly quick and easy and uses few dishes so there isn't much washing up at all! 

I add more coconut (maybe about an extra half cup)and arrange canned peaches in the mixture after pouring it into the pie dish. I imagine it would also be pretty good with other fruit.

Yummo!

This is an old recipe we call "Impossible Pie". I put everything in the blender and pour into lightly greased pie pan. I use 2% milk instead. GREEEAAATTTT.

I made this pie exactly as described ExCEPt . . I used fresh coconut.  I cracked a whole white coconut, drained it, pried out the meat, peeled the brown parts off the meat, and chopped it in a Cuisinart.  I used the whole coconut in place of the one cup specified in the recipe.  It was DIVINE!  The coconut was the star ingredient. The fresh texture gave a great crunch, and the custard highlighted the light, natural coconut flavor perfectly. Amazing.

Great, even when you use Gluten Free flour substitute.  I did find that I had to bake it longer to get it done in the center, but it was still yummy!

Really yummy! We made it with coconut oil instead of butter and coconut milk instead of evaporated milk and it was great! Used 2/3 cup of sugar instead of a full cup and it was still really sweet. Might use even less sugar next time and there will definitely be a next time!

WOW!!! This is terrific!   I used to watch my grandmother make coconut pie with whipping cream.  This tastes just as good without the fat and calorie count.  The only change I made was to increase the coconut amount. The custard set nicely and tasted great warm and cold. Definitely going into the dessert file. Thanks!

I loved how this pie turned out. Reminds me of a custard pie. Easy to make however I did go by what others suggested and added a little more coconut. I'm also going to add some fresh fruit to the top of pie.

I turned this into a GF "magic bars" style dessert. After replacing the flour with coconut flour, I poured the mixture into a jelly roll, lined with parchment paper. I then added an extra 1/4 cup of coconut, and some pecans, chocolate chips, and white chocolate chips.

This was so easy, very coconut-y and super yummy! I used about 2 cups of coconut flakes which I thought made a big difference. Because I'm lactose intolerance and butter is hard on my tummy, I used coconut oil instead of butter. Maybe I'll switch the evaporated milk to coconut milk next time so it'll be completely dairy-free. I live in a high elevation area right now so I baked it for 50 min, turned off the heat then left it in the oven for 5 more min. I'll make this again and again!

Very, very good! I substituted stevia for sugar and used 6oz of half n half, 6oz coconut milk instead of 12oz evaporated  milk. I too added about a cup more of shredded coconut. Before serving pour some of the remaining coconut milk on the plate & stream a chocolate or fruit syrup design. Place the pie on the coconut milk, top with carmelized pineapple bits, toasted coconut, fruit or chocolate shavings. Yum!

Pleasant texture and taste, simple to make, but I missed a crust/crustlike texture at the bottom.

Made this last night and it turned out great . I did use 2 cups of coconut because I like more of the coconut than custard and I use 2 tablespoons of vanilla. I made coconut cookie crust and poured the filling onto the prepared crust and baked the pie for 45 minutes on the middle rack and 5 minutes on the top rack in the oven. I ate it warm and cold and it was delicious both ways. My dad took it to work and less than 24 hours I had two pie orders!!

Eh...this went kinda weird on me.  The coconut sunk to the bottom and the whole thing was a little too sweet for my taste.  That could be my fault though; I DID use sweetened coconut and I toasted it first.  Flavor was really good, though.

I've made this pie several times and it's always delicious. Recently, due to health issues, I adopted a gluten-free and dairy free lifestyle so I modified the recipe as follows: 
I used 1 can (13.5 oz) of coconut milk, ghee instead of butter, and Bob's Red Mill gluten-free flour blend.  I'm also consuming less sugar so I used 1/2 cup of turbinado sugar and unsweetened shredded coconut.  
Yummmm! So happy I can still enjoy this wonderful pie.

I have made this several times. The first time I used sweetened coconut. We thought the pie was sweet. The second we used unsweetened and subsequent pies also. Delicious!

This turned out very good for me; served with fresh raspberries, but it’s great by itself!  I made a double batch and, based on previous reviews, made a few changes, but honestly think it would have been fine as written. The changes I made were as follows, I mixed equal amounts of low fat coconut milk and evaporated milk, I added 1 teaspoon coconut flavoring along with the vanilla, I backed off the sugar by a couple Tablespoons, and finally, I also added in an extra half cup of unsweetened organic coconut,(along with 1cup of sweetened coconut). It think because the unsweetened coconut was much dryer than the sweetened, it helped absorb the liquid, and therefore I did not have any issues with it not being set enough after baking. I also followed someones suggestion and sprinkled the coconut on top of the liquid instead of mixing it in. Not sure if it makes any difference though. I will for sure make this again, it was delicious. Thank you for sharing!

I love coconut!  I made this recipe exactly as printed to share with my sisters (who also love coconut) and it was delicious! I topped it with a little whipped cream and enjoyed that addition. I had one small piece left over after 2 days and discovered that the flavors blended even more. Will definitely make again.

5-star recipe! Only thing I changed was use Splenda instead of sugar to cut some calories.  I think a chocolate drizzle would be a fabulous addition after having this last night. -- both in flavor and eye appeal.

I added my twist to the recipe by substituting sugar for Splenda and adding pecans. It is officially one of my favorite recipes now and I don't even like coconut (picture that!). Absolutely delicious!

This is a nice alternative to a coconut cream pie! I used an equal amount of Domata (gluten free flour) instead of the regular flour and it turned out great! I hope to make this one again ~ yum!

This is amazing! I've probably made it now about 20 timesand have to warn that if you love custard and coconut, its quite addictive!?? (My only suggestion would be to maybe halve the butter from 6T to maybe 3T and see if that doesn't stop any feeling of excessive butter that sometimes results).

Substituted Splenda for sugar and coconut extract for vanilla extract.  Added about 1/3 cup more coconut.  Made for a yummy diabetic treat both by itself and under fresh strawberries. More like cake than custard.

We loved it!!!! You think it does not have enough coconut flavor but if you do as the recipe says it will taste absolutely delicious.

Very easy to make, our 3 year old helped me.  Did add the extra 1/2 c. coconut because I love it.  This was very good.  Will definitely be making this again.  I did not have a 9 inch pie plate but, a 9 inch cake pan worked just fine.

I made it as written, except I baked in a 9x9 inch square pan instead of pie pan, so that I could cut it into squares to share at work. It was ok, the texture was decent (I baked 35 mins so it was firm and slightly browned on top, still soft and a little custardy on the bottom) and the taste was mildly coconut but not much else. It didn't wow me so I won't make it again. Also it's a hard dessert to bring somewhere since it can't sit out and really needs to stay cold.

This pie is delicious and quite easy to make. I did find that a ten 
inch pie plate was a better choice than the nine inch in the directions.

I reduced the sugar by 25%.   Did not seem to affect the taste, everyone still wanted seconds.

I made this for 2 dinners and added a dollop of whipped cream and a raspberry on top. Everyone liked it and wanted the recipe. I used 1.5 cups coconut and had to cook it 55 minutes in my oven. Checked it at 35 and 45. It is definitely more like a macaroon and I happen to love macaroons. 
Would give it 4.5 stars.

Really delicious!  I used coconut sugar instead of regular sugar, coconut flour instead of regular flour, and a combination of heavy cream, coconut milk and evaporated milk.  This is so easy and foolproof, as you can change the ingredients and you still get a beautiful dessert.  Definitely will try some variations next time...and there will be a next time!

Made this today for my Mom & it was a hit!  It's like eating a macaroon.  Not too sweet...just right!  My husband is not particularly fond of coconut & he even said it was really good.  I like that it's crustless too.  It's a definite keeper!

HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY!!! I USUALLY DO NOT EAT PIES BECAUSE OF THE CRUST. WHEN I HAD SEEN THIS CRUSTLESS RECIPE I HAD TO TRY IT. I TOOK THE ADVICE FROM OTHERS AND USED MORE COCONUT. I HAVE TO SAY THAT IT ALL DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH COCONUT YOU WANT TO PUT IN YOUR PIE. I ALSO USED COCONUT OIL INSTEAD OF BUTTER, AS I HAD NO BUTTER. I USED HALF A CUP OF SUGAR AND HALF A CUP OF SPLENDA. IT TUNRNED OUT GREAT. BAKING IT ABOUT 10-15  MINUTES LONGER WAS JUST RIGHT. I LOVE THE FLAVOURS AND I WILL DEFINITELY MAKE IT AGAIN. 
THANK-YOU AND HAVE YOUR BEST DAY EVER!

My guests and I all loved this recipe!
So easy to make!
I will definitely make again and soon.
I did take one reviewers advice and got the fresh cocoanut, the finely grated for the substance of the pie and the large flakes which I added to the top ten minutes before completion. Also used cocoanut extract , but snuck in a 1/2 tsp. of vanilla anyways. It did take 45 minutes to cook. 
Thanks for a great recipe

Oh this is really good. I added extra coconut.  Next time I'll toast the coconut first to see if that adds another depth of flavor...all-in-all, really tasty!

I wasn't a big fan of this recipe. It tasted too sugary sweet and eggy. I've had custards before that I liked but this one went uneaten and was thrown out a week later. That pretty much never happens in my house! I did like the crunches coconut top but not enough to make it again.

I've made this several times and got rave reviews.  I used fat free evaporated milk & you'd never know!  Delicious!  I always have to bake longer, though - 45 - 50 minutes.
