I think I imagined something more, it was ok but the flavor was on the plain side.

These were OK.  I thought they were a bit dry, but my guests really like them.  They were also very time consuming. Next time I would use a variety of meats for different flavors.

I have made this recipe twice recently.  Once for a Mary Kay party and once for a group of friends and former co-workers.  This recipe received rave comments both times by absolutely everyone present.  There were no leftovers.

These are not quiches by any stretch of the imagination - but that wouldn't matter if they weren't so hard to make and so expensive and so unusual in their flavour and consistency - ground beef really doesn't like to be prepared this way - even really good meat becomes unpleasanty chewey - and the garlic powder thing needs to either be lost or reinforced that it should be garlic powder and not garlic salt....The former will pleasantly flavourless (since it's porbably been sitting in the pantry for six years) but won't affect the cooking, while the latter will draw every single bit of the juices out of the meat and into the fat and render the whole meat into grainy little pieces.

These sounded like such a good idea, but they were very dry and not too flavorful. I think they would be better if you used a pastry dough for the crust instead of a "baking mix".
