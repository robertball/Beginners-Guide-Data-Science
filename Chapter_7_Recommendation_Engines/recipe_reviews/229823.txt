I used this recipe last night for an experiment - I'm trying to make a Ham and Cheese Pye similar to one I ate in Weston, MO. at the American Bowman Restaurant.  This was good and my DH said I could make this again.  I did add 1/2 C. half and half to the 2 beaten eggs and 2 1/2 C. shredded cheese=1 C. sharp cheddar, 1 C. Mont. Jack, and 1/2C. Velveeta.   This is a hearty, tasty, filling pie and easy to make.  Though I am still searching for a recipe for Ham and Cheese Pye.

It came out beautifully from the oven. It  was just right neither too dry nor wet. I put some onion inside as well. Tasted great. Everybody liked it in the family, even the most grumpy one over food. I fried the ham a bit before filling the pie. That removes excess liquids.

These are pretty good, and you can't beat how quick and easy they are.  Mine was a little watery from the ham, but otherwise had a great flavor.  It'd be a nice quick breakfast treat.  I think it'd be great with a cornbread crust, too.  Or with other fillings.

I used 4 eggs and added diced onions and asparagus to give more it  veggies and nutritional content! Delicious! Better then when mom made it growing up. I'm a seasoning girl so I was nervous there was no additional spices but it doesn't need it. Easy meal to cook after you have leftover ham ( Easter and Christmas especially!)

Loved it, but if you use glazed ham it's really sweet with the crescent rolls.

Great dinner and if there is any leftovers, an imaging breakfast reheat. I used 4 eggs instead of 2 to make it a bit more moist and keep the crust from drying out!

I was apprehensive that their were no spices but decided to try as is.  This was GREAT, the family loved it!  My husband did add tabasco to his portion and said that made it even better.  Very easy to prepare, and I just added green beans as a side as I made this for dinner, very filling

Everyone loved it - and I didn't even take the time to make that beautiful basketweave top crust.  I just rolled out the dough and put it on top.  Next time I'll add some peas!
