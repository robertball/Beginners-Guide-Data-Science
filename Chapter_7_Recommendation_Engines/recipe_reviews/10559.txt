The taste is great, but I had trouble with the dough.  It was very elastic - after cutting 3" squares they would reduce rather quickly.  This made it difficult to cover the filling.  I'm not sure I'll use the dough again - maybe put the filling in something else.

Loved the flavor, but had a hard time with the dough. Unlike SJHSPN, my dough was crumby and dry and wasn't holding the cookie shape. I have to confess that I subbed butter for olive oil and added about 1/2  tsp each of lemon and orange zest so the dough would have a stronger citrus flavor, so maybe that is what made the difference. As I tried to shape the cookies, I progressively added a little more OJ in hopes of making the texture of the dough more workable, but I couldn't get it right. Finally, I gave up on individual cookies and turned them into cookie bars instead, laying them out in a 9 x 13 baking dish with dough on the bottom and filling on top. They baked up well, tasted wonderful, and cut into bars nicely. Our guests loved them and had no idea they were not intentionally cookies bars.
