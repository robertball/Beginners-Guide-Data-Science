This was great! I can't wait to make it in colder weather.. I made the following changes to my own taste..
Used less onion since I am not a huge fan.
Omitted the carrot and parsley because I didn't have any.
Used corn starch instead of potato flakes because I didn't have those either.
Added half a clove of minced garlic.
Threw in some sauteed asparagus chopped into bite-sized pieces we needed to use up.
Added a handful or so of grated chedder/jack mix.

This recipe turned out very bland and runny. I think I was supposed to drain the potatoes and onions after cooking instead of just adding the other ingredients to them, but the directions never said that. Anyway, I ended up just adding more flakes and puree'ing the whole thing to make a creamy soup.

This was okay, but nothing to write home about, so I made a couple of changes:  cooked the onion in a little bacon grease to carmelize a little and bump up the flavor a little, and when I served it, I sprinkled shredded cheddar and more crumbled bacon on top, then a small dollop of sour cream in the center.  Gave it a sort of "potato wedges" flavor and more depth.  It needed it.

Gave it like this to husband for lunch.  He said it was fine, but when asked, he would have prefered a corn chowder or something like that.

I made this according to the recipe up to adding the 4 cups of milk. I couldn't see how 3T of potato flakes could thicken that much liquid in addition to the cooking liquid. So I only added 2 cups of milk. It was still really thin so I thickened it with flour. After tasting, I added some chicken bouillion and then 5 slices of Am. cheese. It was then OK, but nothing special. The bacon flavor wasn't very prominent...and the bacon pieces were chewy. If I made it again, I would save the bacon to crumble on top. And the T of butter didn't add anything but calories IMHO.

This was a very tasty soup. I added more instant potato flakes because I wanted it a little thicker. A good add in would be sauteed chicken breast cut into cubes. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe with us!

I don't cook much and when I get the chance to cook I always want to try something new.  This is the first time I've tried a recipe from your website and I must say it was most helpful.  The soup eventually turned out great and all my 8 guests loved it.  I will surely cook it again.

This was a fairly good recipe.  I added sour cream and chicken boulion cubes.  My husband thought that it was great and the kids gobbled it up.

Realy good but I thought it was missing something so I added some chicken bouion to it and some flour I put th flour in a jar with a tight fitting lid and added some flour and a little bit of water to make a "paste" ) to help thicken it up and it was great it went so fast. We will make it again for sure!

Very good, but watery.  When it says to cover potatoes and onion with water that could vary.  Mine turn out running, but I just added more potato flakes to thicken.

I made this recipe and it turned out really great! The only complaint I had was that it was very runny. I ended up adding about a cup of flour and the entire package of dry potato flakes. I also added corn and about 15 min before I took it off the stove I added pre packaged biscuit dough to the soup (cut into quarters) This added a nice heartiness to the soup and made it more of a thicker consistency. You will need to add salt and pepper and other spices though, as it is kind of bland.

Excellent!  I cooked the potatoes with fresh minced garlic.  Couldn't really taste it so at the end I added garlic salt and it made a huge difference.  My 10 year old daughter couldn't stop tasting it!  She said it sounded gross, but tasted awesome!  A previous post stated that she thought you should drain the water from the potatoes, but the directions didn't say to.  That is because you should NOT drain it.  I added more instant potatoes than called for.  I will definately make this again, especially in winter months!

This soup recipe is excellent with some minor alterations.  I add more potato flakes to make it thicker and add browned pork sausage to make it more hardier.  My husband loves it.  And I recommend it to all my friends/co-workers.

Pretty good...I never put carrots in a potato soup, I usually use chopped celery, but I put in the carrot and it was all right! I didn't use the tablespoon of bacon drippings, either...I gave the potatoes a head start in the bacon grease, so it wasn't necessary to add the fat into the soup. I also added a couple cloves of chopped garlic because potatoes and garlic do magical things when cooked together. This was a pretty recipe, thanks for submitting it!

This recipe is awesome!  Easy, economical and delicious.  A great base recipe to build off.

I deviated a bit from the recipe by adding a chicken bouillon cube and I used a can of diced carrots.  Using potato flakes instead of flour to thicken made such a difference in taste and consistency. 

This was a big hit with my friends and family.

This was really, really good! I used only three cups of water instead of four, and added a little extra potato flakes to make it thicker. Would definitely make again!

We made this soup, but a low sodium version. We omitted the bacon and grease. I think that's why I didn't give it 5 stars. Bacon makes everything better. We added a little cheddar to finish. I think this would be great with some heavy cream. Overall, a good hardy soup.

Love this so much that I could have eaten the entire pot myself! I modified it by reducing the milk to 3 cups, added some veggie broth, a tablespoon of chicken base, celery and a 1 inch chunk of Velveeta. It was one of the best potato soups I've ever eaten. Serve with some crunchy toasted bread such as Italian or French.

Good recipe for comfort food on a cold evening.  Like many have said, it is a tad too watery. I drained a portion of the water off after the potatoes cooked and doubled the flakes. Great flavor without using chicken stock.

I’m a beginner and found this recipe very useful. It was simple and easy with common ingredients. I found that I needed to add more potato flakes to it to make it to my taste. Otherwise top notch.
