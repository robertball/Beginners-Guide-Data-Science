I have used this recipe 8 times since the new year...
I have yet to make the crust- we'll see how that works out this evening!
The recipe is so simple which makes the pie all the more fun, as it offers the flexibility to switch things up according to taste. I, for example, use leaks plus shallots, and chicken broth instead of water and chicken base. Peas go in very last minute, so they still have a nice pop when eaten.

This was SO good, I love that the recipe is made with all natural ingredients :). I did make some changes as follows:
1. I did not use a crust (so it was more like a casserole). Instead, I made the Cheddar Buttermilk Biscuits from this site and served them on top of the pot pie. I also added some sage to the biscuits.
2. I used a whole pound of carrots, left out the celery (because I forgot to buy it), and used redskin potatoes (a whole bag) with their skins on.
3. I added a few dashes of cayenne pepper with the rest of the seasoning, to match the cayenne pepper in the biscuits.
4. I added 1/2C plain, nonfat Greek yogurt to the sauce, making it a little thicker and more creamy :)

I ended up filling a 9x13" glass dish to the very top, covering it with foil, and baking for 40 minutes. 
The only reason I didn't give this recipe 5 stars is because the prep took me almost an hour. Maybe I'm just slow at prepping, but precooking the chicken and vegetables took at least half an hour, not to mention dicing and slicing everything.

Otherwise awesome. I will definitely make this again!

Good recipe...the crust gave me some trouble though, and in the end the cinnamon and nutmeg didn't taste right with the chicken and veggies. I made a couple other minor changes though, to fit my family's tastes...about half the onion and potatoes...and 1 1/2 Cups baby carrots chopped into thirds and 1 1/2 Cups celery. Didn't have sage, and used canned peas.

Aside from the crust though, we loved the finished product! My husband had multiple servings and was still raving about it  the next morning.

good but dry inside. I like my pot pies with a lot more broth.

I don’t know what I did wrong. I’m followed the recipe and instructions carefully. First, not near enough water for the pie crust. Second, not enough sauce to cover my veggies and chicken, I had to make an addition amount. Third, 1 hour was not near enough time to bake, the crust was still raw. The oven temp is not hot enough.

This was fantastic. Turned out perfectly except I thought it could've had a little more gravy. Otherwise, it was perfect.

Family liked it!!   I used ready made pie crust and accidentally went heavy on the peas but it was good anyway.  Plenty for two dinners for my family of four (two little kids)
