My gang is in love with "Liberty Onion Soup" so I enjoy trying different versions. Being that no one reviewed this recipe I decided to give it a try. I just hate to see lonely recipes. Maybe the bacon fat scared people off, but my feeling is that most of the time I cook heart healty meals, so once in a while, you can splurge. Like Emeril always says "Pork fat rules"! He's right, because the flavor was wonderful although I did drain the fat once the onions were cooked thru; which, however, should really be cooked until a deep golden brown in order to bring out the sweetness of the onion. I also added a bay leaf, thyme, garlic powder, black pepper, a can of beef consomme and used red wine instead of white. Very, very good Julia and we thank you for sharing this great soup recipe!

This has the potential to be a really good french onion soup but the recipe as written needs some changes. 1. I would recommend using half the amount of onions called for. After cutting the recipe in half and only using one small sweet onion and one large white onion, I still had enough soup for 4 people (as an appetizer). 2. I added only a pinch of salt, broth is salty enough. 3. I cooked only 3 slices of bacon and that was plenty of grease! 4. I added the recommended allotment of wine and thought it was too much. 5. Use real sherry, not cooking sherry. With those changes I think this would be a five star recipe. The bacon adds a unique flavor.

My husband and I made this soup and it was EXCELLENT.  He picked the recipe out - which wouldn't have been my first choice based on only 2 reviews but I think he picked it for the bacon.  It was WONDERFUL and full of onions.  We made it exactly like posted and actually called our neighbour over to enjoy a bowl with us.  BRAVO!    I've made it again, but used more broth, and I kinda blew it - too watery, but still good.  Next time, I stick with 8 cups of broth.  Yummy!!!

I've never made french onion soup before this, so this was my very first time.  I'd saved this recipe ages ago and finally decided to make it.  It was a HUGE hit! I cut back a little bit on the onions, maybe used 1/4 LESS than the recipe called for, but it probably would have been fine either way.  The bacon gives it a subtle, unique hint of flavor. Definitely making this again!

I made it but had to go Keto style.  So used white onions and added 1 T stevia to compensate for the sweeter onion substitute.  Did not add the toasted bread cause that would be a big cheat on Keto.

Overall this was a very good dish. The only problem I saw was the amount of pepper called for. I put in a little less than half of what it calls for and it was perfect. Also, I would suggest taking the time to de-stem your Thyme instead of chopping it.
