Excellent muffin with a lot of character.  Fun to make, fun to eat, and a very attractive muffin too.  I chose to use butter, and half and half filled in for  evaporated milk.  I added nothing other than 1/2 tsp. salt to make all the flavors come alive, nor did I omit anything. My muffin tins must be a little smaller than the submitter's, as I ended up with several extra muffins and they only needed 20 minutes to bake - those without the cheesecake center, which was great by the way, were every bit as good. The muffin itself is packed with the carrots, raisins and nuts. While the cheesecake filling is just the right density and not too sweet, the orange flavor is very prominent, a little too prominent for my tastes but it may be just right for others.  This is a real specialty muffin, the  type you'd expect from a coffee house.

I liked the taste of these pretty well, but had two issues. First, I didn't like them the next day, after they had been refrigerated  overnight - they were pretty soggy. Next, I felt that the cream cheese center was too heavy. That might be my fault though, as I made them in a texas muffin pan, which only yielded six mufins. It was, however, quite awesome that I was able to use some sad little baby carrots from the bottom of my veggie drawer to make these muffins. Just threw them in the food processor. As some other reviewers suggested I added some ground ginger, nutmeg and vanilla. I also sprinkled sugar on top before baking. I might make these again...

wow! the are wonderful,not too sweet. I made a few changes,I didn't have butter ,so i used canola oil,I also used 1 cu whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup wh wh pastry flour and I didn't have walnuts so i put some cranberries in the batter. They turned out SOOO GOOD! I imagine they would taste even better with butter. I also made a crumb topping to sprinkle on top,didn't need it but it was nice. I will make these again and again and Im e-mailing the recipes to my friends.since I wrote this review I made them once more,following the recipe w/o changes and they turned out irresistible, we couldn't stop eating them until they were gone. Fabulous!

Yum!   Didn't put in the raisins or nuts and subbed 1/2 cup of oats in place of the nuts, but these are spectacular muffins!  Loved the filling!  They'll be gone in 2 days and there are only 2 of us!

Delicious!  I didn't add the orange juice or orange peel.  Instead I added 2/3 cup of evaporated milk.  I dusted the pan and topped it off with sugar.  Also, I didn't refrigerate after baking.  Turned out great!

really enjoyable muffin.  Made them as instructed except I added some ground ginger and some nutmeg because I like things a little spicy.  Very tender and really yummy.  I will definitely make these again, they look very fancy with the cheesecake filling!

Good. A carrot cake-like muffin with the surprise of orange cream cheese frosting inside. My kids really liked these ones for that little surprise inside. They are a little more labor intensive than most muffins, so not a recipe I would make often.

Yummy recipe!  I would give it 4.5 stars.  I used oj concentrate, and 1/2 and 1/2 instead of evaporated milk.  May have thrown in extra carrot as well.

Can't wait to make these again.  Perfect muffins to add to the bread basket for Easter dinner.  Love the cheese filling.  Do put in the fridge for storing and reheat in the microwave. Great snack with a warm cup of java.  Just as good the second time around.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were absolutely delicious! The only change I would make for next time is to double the cream cream mixture.

Yum!  Very tasty.  Tons of batter, I made 12 muffins (filled to the top) and still had extra batter to make about 10 minis.  Filling is really yummy!  A bit long to make but totally worth it once in awhile.  I had no evaporated milk so just used regular and they turned out fine!

Delicious. I only made 2 little changes. I used 1/2 cup pineapple juice instead of the evaporated milk and 2Tbsp of sour cream instead of Orange juice. They turned out wonderfully.

I say 2 stars, but my coworkers seemed to enjoy them. I just did NOT care for the clump of cream cheese in the middle of a perfectly good muffin. I thought I would enjoy them--with the sugar and zest--but I wasn't happy with the end result. I love the black-bottom cupcakes with the cream cheese, so I thought I'd REALLY love these... but it wasn't a keeper for me.

Followed the recipe and took these muffins to the teacher's lounge at school.  I received many compliments from the teachers.  These were moist and the cream cheese filling was perfect.  It didn't sink, but rather rose up, making it obvious there was a filling in them.  These made a nice presentation and the taste was great.

We love the carrot walnut muffins from Mimi's Cafe. I made a recipe that was very similar but don't know where I found the recipe so decide to try this one. I thought they were even better than Mimi's with the cream cheese in them. Yum!
Update: I made these a second time and was disappointed. It took forever to make (I don't remember spending so much time of them the first time) so I won't be making them again for a very long time. I used the grated orange peel this time too and didn't like the flavor in the muffins at all. Also, the filling popped through the top when they were baking.

These were very good although next time I will double the filling.  I also yielded 18 muffins.  I used non-fat milk for evaporated, left out raisins, left out orange juice (didn't have any) and subbed grated lemon in the frosting. Very nice muffin.

I really didn't care for these. The orange rind flavor was really strong, and I even cut it in half as suggested by another reviewer but it still was kind of prominent. It seems the orange flavor should have been hinted on in the recipe title. All the different things added to the batter were good in the muffin, but the overall base seemed really bland and dry. I followed the recipe except I used lower fat dairy products, which I have never had a problem doing. At least one of the reviewers mentioned that these took a long time to make, so I used pre-chopped walnuts and store shredded carrots. I thought it was an interesting recipe but maybe I prefer a more sweet muffin base with a moist texture.

Wonderful! I was not sure about this totally when I began, but my step mother was coming for a visit and loves carrot cake, so I made them. They were awesome. Plus they freeze very well also! I had the "leftovers" after they had been frozen and they were wonderful.

These were fabulous, fresh.  Since they had cream cheese in them I refrigerated them and they became quite dry.  But I made them again for brunch guests and they were perfect.  I didn't do a thing to the recipe.

ok, these muffins are awesome! I tripled the batch and it made 3 1/2 dozen muffins and 4 mini loaves of bread (w/o the cream cheese in the center of the bread) and they turned out perfect! I cooked the mini loaves at 350 for 40-45 minutes. I cooled both the leftover loaves and the muffins for a couple of hours and then put them into freezer ziplocs to freeze for later. Pull them out, thaw for a good 20 minutes, warm them up a bit in the microwave and wha-la!  A HEALTHY(ish) breakfast is served!

These were great.  I found them to be a little dry but that could easily be remedied by upping the liquid next time and perhaps taking out a little sooner.  I was baking on convection so my timing may have been a bit off.  I omitted nuts due to allergy concerns as I was taking these to church.  They were a hit.  The orange zest in the cream cheese filling is a really nice treat.

These were tasty. Not too sweet. I used pecans since I did not have walnuts and it was still yummy. Good breakfast muffin. I like the cream cheese icing mixture in the center. 
I used muffin cups and they did not release easily, so next time I will just spray the pan as directed.

Very nice muffins!  I love the cream cheese filling, and actually doubled it bc of a few comments that there wasn't quite enough.  I had a bit leftover that I used to frost some of them and turn them more into cupcakes--delish!  These are a little time consuming, as with all filled muffins or cupcakes, but worth the time.  Bf was skeptical at first about the carrots but really liked them once he tried one.  I guess my muffin tins must be small, bc I got 18 out of this recipe, not 12.  Definitely worth making again!  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent muffins! great flavor, not too sweet, and an orange cream cheese filling as a nice surprise. what is not to like about these adorable muffins?! My muffin pan must be smaller because somehow I ended up with 6 extra muffins, totaling 18 muffins. But that's ok-these were wonderful treats and more for me. I had all of the ingredients on hand. I chose to use butter, hallf and half, and reduced fat cream cheese. The only thing that took time was the actual grating of 2 medium carrots for the batter. The 4 ounces of cream cheese filling was the right amount for each muffin. I topped the muffins off with a light sprinkle of cinnamon/sugar mixture. They baked up in the oven exactly 22 minutes, cooled for 5 mins. then I moved them to a wire rack. The cake itself was moist and packed with lots of raisins, chopped walnuts, and specks of grated carrots. Loved the hint of cinnamon. The cream cheese filling is the best part. I could taste the orange flavor but it is not overpowering to me. Then again I love orange. I did cut back on the amount of white sugar in the cream cheese filling. Very pretty, moist and delicious!

I love the flavors in this muffin.  The only change I made was to use light cream as I didn’t have any evaporated milk.   Don’t be afraid to fill them to the top and the orange zest is strong so if you are not too fond of orange zest, reduce the amount to half.  To me, this is a perfect morning muffin to have with my coffee.

These muffins were incredible, they are the perfect combination between cheesecake and carrot muffins. I made them as mini muffins and only baked them for 15 minutes and they turned out perfect!!

Thank you for this recipe. It came out really nice and soft and not too sweet. I didn't have evaporated milk on hand so I used condensed milk diluted with a little water to bring it to the consistency of evaporated milk and it was still great. I also used 1teaspoon of cinnamon instead of 1/2.

Thanks for this recipe! I followed the instructions exactly and the muffins came out perfect. The combination of carrot, raisins, walnuts and cream cheese is fantastic.

Love these. I didn't add the walnuts or raisins bc my hubby doesnt like them. I also substituted the evaporated milk with sweetened condensed milk bc I had a can open.

Good basic carrot muffins.  Liked the cream cheese filling.  Added raisins and walnuts.  Needed a little more sweetness to me.  Will try again but add more sugar and probably some type of glaze or frosting.

I made these this morning and they turned out Great.  I love the cream cheese in the middle.   I often put the cream cheese mixture in all the muffins I make.
