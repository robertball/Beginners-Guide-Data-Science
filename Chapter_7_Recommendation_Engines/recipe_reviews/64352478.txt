Have been doing this for about 10 years. Won't use any other method. ...If you want to impress your family...weave bacon for their BLT sandwiches...Cut 3 pieces in half. Lay 3 halves side by side and weave the other 3 halves so that you have a square. Turn bacon squares halfway through cooking time. It does take a little longer to cook but it  comes out as a perfect square for an even bite of bacon every time. My kids like that they don't have bits of bacon falling out of their sandwiches....My friend says I have too much time on my hands to do this ...LOL...but nobody refuses my invite for lunch!

I tried it. Never again. Awkward preparation. A but of a mess. Cooked over 25 minutes. Lots of smoke but the bacon is not crispy in the least.

Great way to cook bacon I always you thick bacon and itâ€™s taste as good as in the skillet but no mess. Thank you for putting that in the recipe.
