This sounds so easy, I must try it - Just had veggie dogs with plain mustard and would have preferred a relish!

Very easy and tasty too!  I used a mini food processor and this came together in a snap.

This was so easy and WAY better than the hot dog relish in the store! My family are not fans of sweet relish so this was a big hit at our house!
