This was relatively easy to make (and quick cleanup- just my processor)and was a hit at a dinner party.  I was a little unsure of how they would be recieved because it did not look like traditional bruschetta, but they are SO much tastier and there were no leftovers.  I added some diced mozzarella to the tomato mixture for that complimentary taste.  I will definately make these again...One problem though- the recipe made way too much pesto, and i did not even use the requested amount of almonds.  Thanks for the recipe, Maryanne.

This was definitely a big hit at my family gathering.  Most said it was the best bruschetta they ever had, and I would have to agree.  I recommend purchasing a bag of pre-washed spinach leaves situated at the grocery store next to the bags of salad - more simple that way.

Wonderful recipe.  I made mine in the blender this time but I believe it will be easier in the food processor (a little "gummy" to begin in the blender).  Definitely will make again!!!

5 stars for taste, 4 stars for the ingredient list, 4.5 overall.  First of all, I halved the almonds because I ran out.  I started using my blender but it couldn't do the job so I had to get out the food processor.  It makes too much pesto, but it tastes great!  I ended up only using about half the pesto so I need to find something else to use it for.  Next, I used two medium tomatoes and it just wasn't enough.  Between the caprese salad and this I was out of tomatoes.  I would increase your tomato amount if you like it more tomatoee on top.  If you are using good tomatoes, omit the olive oil in the mixture.  I was using wonderful tomatoes and thought the oil took away from the fresh flavor.  Make it easier on yourself and make less pesto and more tomato mixture without the oil.  Excellent!

Mmmm...I loved this bruschetta and so did everyone else at the party.  Without a food processor it was a little messy to make but my small electric food chopper got the job done.  I will definitely make this again!!!

Tastes Great and a hit at the last party
I went to, but the spread was messy to 
make (especially without a food

This recipe went over very well. I like my bruschetta warm so my only altercations were adding mozzarella cheese in the tomato mix ( i used diced can of tomatoes too) and then putting it in the oven to warm it and melt the cheese. I also omitted the almonds because I did not have them, the pesto came out great!

I received rave reviews from guests when serving this!!  My food processor is broken, so I finely chopped the pesto ingredients together for just a few minutes and it still turned out great.  I also made the pesto the night before and refrigerated it, so it only took a few minutes to prepare before serving.

Although this recipe was extremely fast and easy, it tastes absolutely wonderful! I couldn't ask for a better recipe.  The kids love tearing up the spinach too!

Outstanding! Keep in mind you end up with alot more pesto than you need for one loaf. I froze it and made it again a month later for another party. I also used some for pasta.

I was very disappointed.  I did cut the recipe in half as it was more than enough to serve 8 people.  The spinach mixture clogged my chopper so I took it out mixed it by hand.  It was thick & a bit overwhelming.  I gave it a 3 star because everyone said it was 'ok'.

Very very yummy!  The proportions are off--you'll have way too much pesto than needed for the amount of tomatoes here.  I guess that means I chop more tomatoes and we have it again tomorrow night!  I only used about half the almonds and was happy with the texture they added.  Also, if substituting dried basil for fresh, use 1/3, which would be 1 teaspoon in this recipe.  This is also a great way to sneak spinach onto the menu.

Wow...this was very good!  1st attempt at Bruschetta (and pesto, too) and this impressed our dinner guests.  The pesto was very "thick", though, and didn't want to blend in either the food processor or the blender.  I'll try decreasing the almonds even more next time to get a better consistency.

Awesome, awesome, awesome!  I was taking this to a party so I couldn't stack it up like it suggested.  Instead I mixed the pesto together with the tomatoes and cheese and served it with the toasted baguette pieces.  It was FANTASTIC!  It think my husband and I ate the entire bowl ourselves!

THIS IS AWESOME!!!  I usually don't review recipes, but had to with this one.  Made this for a friend's visit, and we both loved it.  I made about a third of the recipe, and it was plenty for 8 slices of bread.  Because I didn't have enough almonds, I also added pine nuts to the pesto base (half and half ratio).  YUM!!!!  Will definately make this a ton.  Used my hand chopper instead of the clunky blender.  Love this recipe!!!!

Too bad there is not a photo yet. These are beautiful. And DELICIOUS.  I've tried other bruschetta recipes from this site, and this recipe is worlds above the rest.  I made the pesto and tomato mixture several hours ahead to let the flavors intensify.  I also added a good balsamic to the tomato mixture. I needed alot more EVOO than 2TBS to make the pesto a good consistency.  Otherwise, perfect!!!

I love this recipe.  I left out the almonds and the fresh basil because I did not have any on hand.  When making the pesto I only put 1/2 the amount of olive oil called for in and it turned out fine.  I put it in my little chopper and it did a great job.  I used cheese bread to put it on and topped with fresh tomatoes from the garden.  Yum.  I used the leftover pesto as a dip for wheat thins and everyone loved them.

Very good! These went quick.  Everyone wanted more.  The only difference I did was add more olive oil to make a better consistency and a little balsamic vinegar to taste.  I will be making these again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Five stars all the way!  These were amazing!  Everything about them was delicious!  We prepared a four course Italian dinner and these were more than a perfect compliment. To make these taste even better, we added a bit of grated cheese on top and that really topped it off. The pesto sauce was amazing and put together it was just a perfect appetizer.

This was absolutely fabulous. This is definitely a keeper. Thanks a lot for this wonderful recipe. I only found the amount of almonds too much, & so I halved them. Thanks again.

I felt this was too rich/heavy taste for what I was looking for, although it was very good with a lot of flavor. It was also very messy to make in my little food processor. I made the recipe as instructed without alterations.

This was a BIG crowd pleaser at a barbeque I attended. I was asked for the recipe several times! I also halved the almonds, and I hand chopped everything... it was worth it. Delicious!

THANKS!

Made this for my bible study group--many who profess to hate pesto. They ate every one and raved about them, demanding the recipe. Only addition I made--I added some Romano top of the tomatoes on 1/2 of them and toasted them lightly. The crowd liked both versions.

Everyone raved about this! However, I used walnuts instead of almonds and only half the required amount.
