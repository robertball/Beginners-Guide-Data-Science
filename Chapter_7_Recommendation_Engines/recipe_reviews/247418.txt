Really quick little appetizer that is perfect for the hot dog lovers! If you like hot dogs on a pretzel bun, then you'll definitely like these little appetizers. The sauerkraut and grilled onions are the perfect toppings, and I used a whole ground Dijon mustard to give it a little extra kick! We loved these!!
