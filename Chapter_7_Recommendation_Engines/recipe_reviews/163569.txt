Tastes just like country fried steak! So so good!  We did ours in a deep fryer and there was no need to put it in the oven after cooking.

This dish was a big hit...not at all greasy like I thought it might be. Mine was pretty crispy after frying, so I only baked it 3 or 4 minutes. Super good!!

This was just great! The only bacon I had was Maple flavored, One pound was scarfed down in nothing flat. I took them for appetizers. Great hit. Thanks for the recipe. Next time I will make two pounds of bacon.

I was excited to make this and serve it with mashed potatoes, white gravy, and mixed veggies.  Usually I can never make enough bacon because everyone fights over it and because it lacks so much in nutritional content, I don't make it often.

However, I won't make this again.  The flour coating is just too bland.  I added more pepper and salt than called for and it still lacked flavor.  It actually made the bacony flavor of the bacon sort of disappear.  My family of seven kinda picked at it and broke it into pieces and mixed it with the gravy.  The white gravy is what made this bacon somewhat tolerable.

Like I said, we LOVE bacon and I don't even mind greasy foods, but coating and frying this bacon made it bland.

Did not bake, but otherwise followed recipe to the letter.  A huge hit with my friends.

well it looked better than it tasted.

I found that the bacon flavor was gone and all you tasted was batter.  My kids, who absolutely love bacon, didn't care for it either.  Maybe it's just that there was too much fat, fat from the bacon and then fat from deep frying.  yuck.

It seemed like a whole lot of effort for no reason

I won't make it again

I made it with a thin cut bacon, so my end result tasted like fried flour with a hint of bacon, but I can tell that it'll be better with thicker bacon.

Also, no gravy so I dipped in ranch. Say what you will, but fried anything is good in ranch. Yes, even fried flour.

Made this for Super bowl Sunday last year and they were a hit -- was requested to make again this year.  We cure our own bacon, so will use this recipe again with that.
