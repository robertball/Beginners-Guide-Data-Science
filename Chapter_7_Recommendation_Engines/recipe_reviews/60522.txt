i know youre not supposed to change the recipe however, this is made especially good if you fry the hotdogs with a little onion n a pan first and right before you add the beans sprinkle in a little brown sugar and put the heat way down and let them simmer a while. i did everything else how the recipe called for and it was easy and good.

I took soupisgoodfood33's advice and sauteed the hot dogs in a little butter until they got little crunchy bits on them before adding the other ingredients. I served it over hot buttered rice. The kids liked this okay--they ate it but I can't say for sure that it'd be a make again recipe. Best part about this recipe is it's cheap to make and it's great for kids who want to make something for dinner on their own.

I tried this recipe recently, and liked it.  It tastes good the first day, but definitely tastes better the next day!  Waiting until the next day allows the flavors to 'mellow'...

This tastes just like when my southern Mother said we were having Beanie-Weenie's for dinner. Loved introducing a memory to my children, No, it's not lobster, but it's some good beanie-weenie's.

Franks and beans is a recipe I depend on when I'm extra-tired at dinnertime or if I'm just too broke to buy meat any more expensive than hot dogs. I have made this version a couple of times and I think it's pretty good. It tastes like BBQ'd beans. It's easy and I made it even easier by using dried parsley flakes instead of fresh. I also put in a Tbsp. of dried chopped onion. Also I would suggest keeping the heat down VERY low just so it barely bubbles and stir it fairly often to keep it from sticking to the bottom of the pan (I also advise to use a large pot rather than a skillet to make stirring easier). It comes out rather thick and cooks quite awhile so that's why frequent stirring is important. It is a very filling recipe and is good with the shredded cheddar cheese on top.

I've made this several times now and using vegan ingredients and the intensity of flavor from garlic worst. sauce etc. makes this so satisfying. I add a scant bit of cinnamon not enough to taste it but to help meld the flavors. I love this with grilled (vegan) cheese! I think it would be fantastic as a slow-cooker dish.

Really Good. I had to take my closet wallpaper down so I wanted something really easy to make. I did put this in the crockpot for 3hrs on low use fresh garlic and used 2 - 16oz cans of pork and beans. I put on top of jasime rice. What really sets this apart from others is the tartness you get from the cider vinegar. The Best beanie-Weenies Ever!

Good flavor, although it seemed like there were too many weenies, and not enough beanies in the mix.....

Made exactly as is.  I liked this pretty well the first time I made it, possibly because I was just in the mood for something like this.  My brother had been making beans & hot dogs, and I hadn't had that for a while and was getting the urge.  However, the second time I didn't quite like it as well.  I think the vinegar and Worchestershire sauce are a bit much, and despite a couple of others saying they were exactly like Beenie-Weenies, I don't think so.  But it's super easy and gets points for that too.

Made this for my kids for lunch. I sauteed the hot dogs with onion prior to adding the other ingredients. I also skipped the cider vinegar and only added a few dashes of Worcestershire Sauce.

This was a great family dish for a rainy night as I was trying to clean out the pantry.  My kids loved it and they both asked for seconds, something that rarely happens here.  I found the cider vinegar taste a little strong for my liking and I think next time, I might cut it in half and see what happens.

I really liked this. I added some onion that I cooked with the hot dogs for just a few mintues before adding everything else. I was out of cider vinegar so I used red wine vinegar.

First, this recipe will not yield 6 servings, even kid -size servings. As someone else said, the ratio of beans to franks seems to favor the franks. The ketchup seemed to stand out in the flavor making it somewhat acidic. Maybe adding another can of baked beans would take care of all these problems. It wasn't gross, but I wouldn't fix it again per this exact recipe.

Great recipe! Only things I changed were : 1) fried hot dogs in canola spray and onion powder before adding other ingredients; and 2) reduce vinegar to 1 Tbsp.

A bit stronger than I'm used to, but my wife and our roommate loved it, so it was a big hit in my house! The sharp cheddar tip really did bring it all together. Next time, I think I'll make a bigger batch and stash the rest to see how it tastes once the ingredients have sat together a while.

I usually use molasses when I make beanie-weenie, but I was completely out so I looked up this recipe. It's ok in a pinch, but I miss the rich flavor of the molasses. Hubby ate it up though. I'll definitely cut the vinegar down next time to mellow it out.

My husband and three boys ate a couple of bites and then threw it away. They do like canned baked beans with franks or Italian sausage in them but they didn't like the flavors in this recipe at all. I followed it exactly. Thanks anyway though. Donna

I sometimes use 8 ounces of tomato sauce and 1/4 cup of brown sugar, if i don't have ketchup on hand. Definitely a five star worthy recipe.

Bf HATED this one and wouldn't even eat it.  I'm sorry.  :o(  I thought they were ok--but just baked beans and hot dogs.  Usually we just put brown sugar in with beans, so I thought I'd try this and see if we liked it better.  Clearly bf doesn't.  I thought the vinegar taste/smell was pretty strong.  I don't mind eating the leftovers, but I won't make it again.  Thanks for sharing.

I made it because our roommate, my hubby and I were craving a bit of our childhood lol. This is a good recipe but I did have to make some changes since I didn't have all the ingredients, so instead of the vinegar I used soy sauce and instead of the parsley I used two heaping tablespoons of minced garlic. I used garlic powder, onion powder, dried minced onion, and adobo for seasonings. I made two 28 oz cans of the Busch's original beans because 1 wasn't going to cut it, especially with the ratio of beanies to weenies. So I doubled the other ingredients to match, then it tasted too much like ketchup and was a bit too salty so I added 2/3 cup of honey mustard to balance it better. When it was all done it had great balance of tangy with a little spice. We had some buttered bread with it, delicious! Will definitely make it again.

This is delicious of course I tripled the recipe for my family. A few changes: I used dehydrated parsley from the produce section ( because it's what I had on hand) added about 1/2 cup of Sweet Baby Ray's sweet and tangy bbq sauce about 2 tsp of cayenne pepper a few dashes of Frank's Ted Hot sauce & i used minced garlic instead of garlic powder (what i had on hand). I also used 50% less sugar & sodium ketchup. Keep in mind my additions are to a TRIPLED recipe

This takes me back to my mom making this for me. However I would recommend baking it in the oven in a casserole dish and then adding some cheddar cheese towards the end.

This is similar to the Beanie Weenie I grew up with however my mom threw it into a big casserole dish covered it with cheddar cheese and baked until golden brown! We loved it and it was and easy pleaser for 12 kids...not many dishes did we love unanimously besides this one.

Very tangy - needed sugar. Added brown sugar and molasses to give it some sweetness.
