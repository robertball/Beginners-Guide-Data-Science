Our great Aunt Cheriee loved these potatoes when we served them for our annual Christmas Party. I made all the preparations and refrigerated the dish until time to bake. They were a hit, I had to e-mail the recipe to Great Aunt Cheriee immediately.

Loved it! My whole family ate it right up. I felt like I was making mac and cheese, so I added a little mustard powder which I like in homemade mac. Used velveeta but Im sure you could use cheddar or any cheese. I also precooked the hashbrowns in microwave until all thawed out and then only had to cook for 1/2hr. I will be making this again! It was so easy.

We really enjoyed this sidedish! The potatoes were very cheesy! We only used 1 1/2 cups of half and half and a little less cheese but very good and will make again.

I made this for our Christmas dinner because it was easy to make.  I was a little unsure about it because of the processed cheese and frozen potatoes, but everyone loved it!

Just didn't work for our family.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Once in a while I'll tweak a recipe that has a good basic taste and is quick and easy but this wasn't one of them.

I tried this for the first time and it was really good.  My husband said it was very much like "honeymoon potatoes" except that cottage cheese is used instead of half-and-half.  I took another reviewers suggestion and used Potatoes O'Brien...this added a lot of flavor plus I sprinkled with garlic salt and pepper.  I used Velveeta and a little shredded sharp cheddar.  I defrosted the potatoes first so I thought the cooking time would be less, but after 1/2 hour at 350 it was still very soupy.  Increased the temperature to 400 and took off the tin foil.  Only then did it cook more quickly. and to the right consistency.  Not sure why you do covered for so long....maybe it works better with frozen potatoes.  Very good and will make it again.

My family absolutely LOVED them!  They were ALL gone by morning! lol  The only thing I did differently was add some cut up scallions and season them with salt & pepper!  Easy and delicious - it doesn't get better than that! : )

Quick, easy and a great potatoe side dish. The only change I made was to use Potatoes O'brian instead of hash browns to give it a little more flavor.

We don't use processed cheese so I substituted mild cheddar. Nice and easy; everyone liked these. I think they could use some seasoning, and maybe breadcrumbs/paprika for color. Will make again.

This is yummy.  We really don't care for processed cheese, so I used a sharp cheddar and a little colby jack, too, instead.  I layered the cheese, potatoes, and onions and poured the milk mixture over the top, and I used evaporated milk instead of half and half.  I also added some garlic powder, dry mustard, and red pepper to the milk mixture.  I don't know how close my end result is to the recipe, but we love it;  that's a success in my book!  Mine did take much longer than the time in the recipe, but my hash browns (I used Yukon Gold frozen ones) were just partially thawed, so I expected that.

Deeeelicious!!  I halved the recipe for 2 adults and 1 child and we have a little left for lunch tomorrow.  I didn't have processed cheese so I used half cheddar and half mozzarella.  I will make this again!

Wow, This recipe truly surprised me! My boys love Delmonico potatoes when we go out to eat so I decided to try making them at home. This recipe seemed way to basic and easy to compare with a restaurant dish but I decided to give it a try based on the ratings and reviews- I am so glad I did. These are excellent, as good if not better than what we get when we go out to eat!  I'm making them for the 2nd time in 1 week and my boys have already asked if we can skip the mashed potatoes on Thanksgiving and have these instead. I made the recipe exactly as directed and would not change a thing. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Reading how others cited a need for some textural difference, I sautéed an onion with some salt, pepper and paprika and added to the milk mixture. It is ridiculously easy but I think it needs flavor enhancements as people have cited. No it doesn't call for salt and pepper, I would never cook without it and it is a necessity in this dish. I think it would be fantastic with some diced veggies mixed in or even ham/prosciutto, etc.
