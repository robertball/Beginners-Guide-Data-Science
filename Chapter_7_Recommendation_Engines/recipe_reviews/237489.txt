2.27.16 This is very similar in texture to hummus (maybe just a bit creamier). Honestly I was surprised how much flavor this has considering how it breaks down nutritionally (often a disappointment there)...it's Super Star healthy but tasty too! Do allow time in the fridge as the flavor definitely improves. MissaLissa thanks for sharing your recipe. I most certainly would make this again.

I tried this on its own when I finished making it and thought that it was really odd.  Scooped it up on a carrot and it is fantastic!  I couldn't stop eating it.  It's a unique and refreshing take on veggie dip.  This is the kind of recipe that makes me wonder how someone came up with that.
