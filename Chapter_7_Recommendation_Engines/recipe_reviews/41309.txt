This recipe is very much like the one Kraft submitted to this site. Its soooo yummy. I added White Cheddar because we don't care much for Mozzarella. I pulse the bacon, cheese and some green onion or chives in my food processor for a COARSE grind because the pieces were too big and kept falling off the loaf. Also to keep the loaf more "contained" I baked in a tube pan for 35-40 minutes at 350 degrees. Oh...for an even better taste sensation, use Steve Morrisons ONION, GARLIC, CHEESE bread from this site, rather than the frozen stuff. Boy Howdy!!!! With Steve's dough, this recipe becomes and orgasmic delight, instead of just really good!

I used my bread machine for the dough part which made it quite easy.  I added a little less bacon and only about half of the recommended ranch dressing mix.  The whole family was practically pawwing at the oven door, they couldn't wait and we were very pleased.

Great supporting role addition to the game time munchie menu.  Completely devoured, but not the first thing on the table to go.

WOW! This is too easy and very delicious!  My guests devoured it!  Next time I think I will try pepperoni instead of the bacon.  Thanks for a great recipe!

At the risk of sounding like the bad guy, we did not like these at all. The combo of flavors was weird to us and the taste was salty as well. We threw most of it out. I'm only giving it 2 stars b/c it was easy to make and luckily, the ingrediants weren't too expensive.  Granted, this is just my family's opinion...take it or leave it but since I can't say anthing else nice about this recipe...well, I guess I won't say anymore.  Sorry T.O.H.!

Frequently requested, and always appreciated. Used Italian Dressing Mix instead of Ranch as personal choice - highly recommend it.

I made this recipe using the buttermilk buiscuits in the can instead.  Maybe this is why the bottom of mine burned???  In any case, I think next time I will just dip the tops of the bread into the bacon/cheese/ranch mixture as it was a bit heavy.  The taste was pretty good & I might make them again, they were worth trying and the guys seemed to be a bit more "gaga" over them rather than the gals.

This recipe disappointed me - I was really excited to make it (it was actually a prize winning recipe in the Taste of Home magazine several years back). I don't think the mozzarella cheese did anything for the flavor and the ranch dressing mix gave it a weird sort of tang/sourness. I do like the idea of it though so if I were to make it again, I would use a sharp cheddar and some seasonings of my own. I guess it all boils down to people having different tastebuds...

This was good but I was not too thrilled with the ranch dressing taste.  If I make again, I will try some other dressing mixture.  (Per my families taste) Thanks

I was really excited about making this because we're bacon freaks!  I was a bit disappointed as I felt it lacked flavor.....I thought the dressing mix would really tweak it up, but it didn't.  I was kinda bummed.

This is an awesome recipe!  I have made it many times and I get great comments.  I cut back on the turkey bacon and made the bread pieces a bit larger than the recipe asks for.  I have also used colby/montery jack and mozzarella cheeses and it tastes great!Thanks for the recipe!!!

Yummy!  My husband loved this!  Made it for Thanksgiving.  It's easy, looks great, and it's fun to eat.  I will make this again, but will probably use something other than Ranch dressing mix...I dunno, maybe a garlic and herb, or something. I also think I'll increase the amount of cheese, and add minced onions.  This pull apart bread recipe seems very versatile and one could customize the flavors to fit the meal you're serving.  Thanks!

I'm sorry, but this was terrible! I was really disappointed because they sounded so good and got mostly 5 stars from the reviewers. But, I have to agree with the few who didn't like this recipe. The ranch dressing is what I think ruined it. No one in my family liked it,even my husband who loves just about any kind of bread.

I goofed when I started making this, thinking that I had the Ranch mix.  I got half way through, and all I had was Italian.  Went ahead and made it with the Italian mix and was very pleased with the results.  My boys had friends over and they inhailed it, then asked for the recipe.  Coming from 11 and 14 year old boys, I'd say that was a rave review!  Will try it with the ranch mix next time.

This bread was a big hit at Easter dinner so I'll make it again, however next time I think I'll leave out the dressing mix. It didn't taste right with the other ingredients.

My family loved this easy bread, not only for it's taste but because it's fun! I used my bread machine to make the dough rather than using frozen bread dough, and it turned out perfectly! I've also made it with Italian dressing in place of the ranch dressing that the recipe calls for.  Absolutely delicious!

This bread is really good. Since my first attempt last week I've made it three times- the family loves it. I make a basic white dough in my bread maker and have used veggie bacon aswell as ordinary-equally good.Lovely cold with cream cheese.

These should be a four and a half.  They were good, just not to die for good.  If you like bacon, cheese, and ranch you'll like these.

I have made this many times and it has always been a hit with guests.  I roll and cut bread on a large cutting board for convenience.  This can also be mixed the day before and kept in the refrigerator until ready to raise and be baked.  Note:  a non-stick spray helps with easy removal from pan.

I did not like this at all.  I don't know what it is about it, but there is an aftertaste that is just nasty.
