I made this and it hardened on my cupcakes like cement.  It tasted just like straight up cornstarch too.  What a waste of 3/4 cup of splenda.  The choclate-choclate cupcakes were good though after I peeled off the icing like elmers glue.

Worked like a charm in cream cheese frosting for traditional carrot cake -- got rave reviews from my friends.

i used this in an icing recipe and it was great. i couldn't see using just by itself as a garnish, but it worked well mixed in a recipe. i think i'll try it tonight in my whipped cream ! I did use it in the whipped cream and it was good-I wouldn't recommend using more than a pinch or you'll get an aftertaste
