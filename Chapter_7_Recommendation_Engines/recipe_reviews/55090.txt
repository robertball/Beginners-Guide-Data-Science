I was making snack food for a "girls night in" and found that the marshmallow cream that I had  planned to use for my fruit dip had expired, so I found this recipe and decided to try it.  What a hit this was!! I did use a whole cup of powdered sugar and it was perfect! We all loved it! Glad I found this recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

You can easily switch the whipped topping with vanilla yogurt, tastes the same.

Good fruit dip!  I used low-fat cream cheese and light whipped topping, it was super!  I will use this recipe again.

I didn't have marshmallow cream like many other fruit dips ask for so I tried this. It could be a little sweeter but other than that it's a good dip.

I made this dip but didn't like the consistency.  I added water--about 3/4 cup and a little extra powdered sugar.. Delicious..

We love this recipe all year but especially around the holidays. We double the recipe then freeze one container each time we make it. We do add a tablespoon of lemon juice to the doubled recipe which does not take away from the sweetness but ads just a little zing and thins it out a little.

This was very good. I used 1/2 cup powdered sugar, 1/4 cup confectioners Swerve, and 1 tsp vanilla. Not too sweet and everyone at my moms group loved it!

Very good flavor!!!  Just a little thick so added a touch of water to thin it out to make it "dipable".  Will make again!

A friend surprised me with some fresh from the farm strawberries, the day before a scheduled get together with some friends. I found this recipe, for which I had all the ingredients on hand (yeah! no extra trips to the store). So easy to make, a division fabulous. Everyone raved about the the dip, wanted to know how to make it.  A real keeper!!

So much better than dips made with marshmallow fluff!!!  The bowl was scraped clean at a family party.  Simple, versatile and delicious - thanks for a great recipe!

I made this for a 4th of July family gathering. It was a huge hit! I had strawberries and cinnamon graham crackers to dip in it. The only substitute I made was ½ tsp almond extract instead of the vanilla. Will definitely make again.

This was a hit at a work pot-luck served with fresh strawberries!  Everyone liked it much better than the marshmallow fluff variety of fruit dips.  I used 3/4 c. powdered sugar rather than 1/2 c. and doubled the vanilla. Super!!
