I used the claret shown in the photo and it was way too strong. So we cut in about 200ml water and about 1/2 cup orange juice. Now it tastes right.

I made as written for it but decided to add star anise to this one. It was ok but better as written. This was heavy on the cloves for me but hubby liked it a lot.
