Too sweet to enjoy on its own, but good if eaten with a tall glass of milk. Also terrific with peanut butter.

These really are melt in your mouth cookies. You can never just eat one. My husband makes these for me when I am craving something chocolaty and sweet! And the best part is, he doesn't mind making them since they are so easy & quick to make.

These cookies are not too sweet to eat alone, they are just delicious by themselves. That is why you can't eat just one. Everyone that I know who has eaten them has said they are truly delicious. So many people have told me that I should try to get a company to sell them for me. I am the original owner of this recipe and put it on the internet on recipe sites in 1999. Try them you will just love them! I have finally been able to upload this photo of my cookies.

Loved these! will definitely make again. So easy! followed the recipe and came out great.  They have a great crunchy crumble to them.  Like other reviews have said peanut butter on them is good too.  They aren't any sweeter than your average cookie.   Just a powdered sugar flavor rather than the granulated.  Yes you need milk but don't all cookies!  And you can sample the dough since there are no eggs!

It was too dry and the middle was too soft and the edges to hard. It didn't have much flavor either

Stick to regular chocolate chip cookies because these are not good. The oats seemed a little misplaced and they were. There's something very off about these cookies, I just can't put my finger on it. I followed the recipe exact and the flavors just weren't there. All the other reviewers raved about how the flavors compliment each other but I found them to be very bland. I will never make again. I was expecting like a powder sugar taste kinda like Christmas cookies but nothing. Very disappointed. The reason I even gave 2 stars is because they were so easy to make.

My dad thought that they were chocolate chip shortbread when I made him try them.

These cookies are great. I quartered the recipe (I made them for a small group) and it made 16 cookies. The dough is very crumbly but I packed it into the ball shape and they baked up fine.  Definitely a make again!

Oooooh, wow. The combination of flavors is wonderful - I think these are better than either chocolate chip or oatmeal cookies. Mine baked the full 12 minutes on a silicone baking mat. I scaled the recipe to 66 cookies, and it made about 30 cookies using a cookie scoop. 

I accidentally poured in too much baking soda this time, so I left it and decided not to push them down with a fork before baking. Great results! I baked an extra 2 minutes to make up for the extra height.

Soooo yummy!  Love these cookies.  Easy to make, soft, delicious, and the perfect combination of flavors!  I used less chocolate chips than called for and it was just the right amount of sweetness for me.
