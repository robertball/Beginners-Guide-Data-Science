Very good, and you can modify the ratio of Salmon to Cream Cheese to get the consistency that you prefer.

My family and I LOVED this dip.  I used Neufchatel, since it's a bit lower in fat than regular cream cheese.  It's so wonderful.  My family had it with whole wheat crackers as a snack on Thanksgiving.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  My cousin ate half a bowl in one sitting, and I had doubled the recipe.  I also tried it with fat free cream cheese--big mistake.

I made these for the Christmas holiday and I'm just now getting to review. These were really good! I used a ziploc bag, cut a hole at one end of the bag and used that to pipe into the veggies. They were so impressive that I was accused of going "gourmet" with my appetizers. Much easier to prepare than you might think. Thanks!

Very delicious. I made the spread in the food processor. Cherry tomatoes were very fiddly, but tasty. Great for a party.

Very tasty.  Easy to make the night before a party (though I made it harder by accidentally getting a BLOCK of cream cheese instead of the whipped but fixed it by mixing in 2 tablespoons of plain yogurt).  Very pretty hord'ouerve when piped into hollowed-out campari tomatoes and garnished w/fresh dill.

I used fresh dill and about double the amount of salmon.  It was delicious!  Served spread with sesame crackers which went over very well (in addition to the veggies).  Leftovers were great on a bagel the next day.

All I have to say is yummy, yummy, yummy!!  We used fresh parsley, rather than dried.  Next time I'd like to try it on something non-veggie, like crackers.
