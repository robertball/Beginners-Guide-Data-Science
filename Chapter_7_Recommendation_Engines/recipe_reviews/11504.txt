Great recipe! I made a couple of changes, though, to make it less cake-like and more brownie-like: I doubled the recipe and added one less egg and 1/3 cup less flour. I also added an extra 1/3 cup of peanut butter (and a few less tablespoons butter) and spread a thin layer of a chocolate glaze on top when it came out of the oven. It was a huge hit! I'll definitely be making it again.

First, if you want these chewy and brownie-like DO NOT BEAT THE EGGS UNTIL THEY'RE FLUFFY that will only make it cake-like.  In fact, don't use your mixer at all.  Use a fork to mix together the butter and peanut butter, then mix in the sugars, then the egg and vanilla, and then the dry ingredients with a spoon.  This will make them chewy and yummy like a real brownie!  Great basic recipe though!

I should have trusted my instincts on these and used my own judgment rather than paying such close attention to all the reviewers who recommended a longer baking time. Do not overbake, or you'll end up with one, dry peanut butter brownie. Mine would have been perfect at 25 minutes, but I let it go another five. Having said that, they're good, with a nice peanut butter flavor--but with so many other recipes out there, I wouldn't call this a "must make again, to die for recipe." I frosted them with Chocolate Frosting I, which made them twice as good as they would have been otherwise.

Tastes like a peanut butter cake, moist and yummy!  I added about 2/3 cup of chocolate chips and baked it in a 8x8 baking pan instead of 9x9.  Very quick and easy to make.

These brownies were amazing! My boyfriend hates chocolate, so I'm always trying to find desserts that don't have any in them. I made the recipe as is, but made a peanut butter icing in order to make it extra special! I used 2 cups of confectioners sugar, 2 tablespoons of milk, 2 teaspoons of corn syrup and 2 full tablespoons of peanut butter. It made the brownies sweeter (the way I like them) and added even more peanut butter flavor! I'll definitely be making these again soon!!!

These are really yummy, especially with chocolate frosting.  To double the recipe, I baked them in a 9x13 pan and lowered the temp to 325 (as was suggested by another reviewer) - they were more than ready in 35 minutes.

HELPFUL TIPS WHEN BAKING TO PREVENT HARD EDGES: I cover the pan with foil and with a knife... I cut out a big square in the middle so just 2" all around the edges is covered w/foil, so the edges are AS chewy as the middle.  I double this recipe and it takes about 35-45 min to bake.  I just wait for it to spring back as indicated and be a nice golden color (check the very center b/c that's where it will be gooey if not done).  I add eyeball amount of chocolate chips on top before baking which I think is goodness. Or you can melt a chocolate glaze/frosting on top after it's done which also tastes delicious.  I freeze the leftovers but definitely make double the amount using the suggestion of doubling all ingred. but adding 1/3C MORE pb, 2T LESS butter, and 1/3C LESS flour (so 1C + 2/3C).  Excellent each time!

Fantastic Brownies! This is quite a refreshing change from the usual chocolate brownies, and it was very enjoyable! It was easily made in about a hour for me, and even though I am not too fond of peanut butter, I couldn't stop eating these! I ended up baking my batch in an 8x8 pan, and baked it for an extra ten minutes because I really prefer chewy bownies! Quite a crowd pleaser! Thank you Jo! This will have a permanent spot in my recipe book! =)

These are awesome. I make them over and over and my room mates always ask for more. Even better than semi-sweet chocolate chips is just 2 Hershey bars broken up and placed on right after they come out of the oven. Then smear the chocolate all over when it melts. These are amazing and fast.

So sinful and good!  There is no need to change any of the ingredient amounts to make these more brownie-like, rather than cake-like.  All I did was barely mix the ingredients together and then put them in for only 25 minutes instead of 30.  They were still slightly underdone in the middle, which is how I love them.  I tossed in 2/3 cup of white chocolate chips because my boyfriend loves them!  They were a big hit and I plan to make them again very soon!  Note: Double the peanut butter--they're even better this way!  You can also replace the butter with applesauce without any noticeable difference.

Everyone loves these brownies! I did make a few changes. First of all I doubled the recipe. I only use 3 eggs instead of 4 and 2 cups peanut butter. I also decreased the white sugar by 1/2 c and increased the brown sugar by 1/2 c. Lastly, I add 1/2 bag of Reeces peanut butter chips!

Of all peanut butter brownie recipes on this site, this is THE ultimate recipe. I've tried them all. If you want them even chewier, substitute 2 Tbsp. of Egg Beaters for the eggs and add only 1/4 tsp. of baking soda. That way the batter does not rise very much and they become chewy. Bake them for about 25 minutes. Thank you, Jo!!

Don't bake longer than 25 minutes! I'm glad I read some reviews and didn't bake any longer. Also glad I didn't overbeat eggs, just mixed til incorporated, and used 1 egg and 1 egg yolk. Made a simple butter, powdered sugar, cocoa, milk frosting. Family likes them a lot.

OMG - after reading this on the recipe buss - I am sitting at my desk dying to go home and make this stuff.  It sounds great.  I am taking one of the reviewers ideas and double the recipe, then use - 1 less egg; 1/2 cup more PB; and 1/3 cup less flour.  I am going to bake them and them about 5 mintes before they are done, I am going to use the new MINI PB Cups (which are awesome by the way) and throw on top; then when it comes out; I will drizzle with PB and Chocolate.  I cannot wait to try on vacation in three weeks.

I did a double batch and used 1/2 cup margarine, around 1 cup of peanut butter (I never measure peanut butter, so it was probably more like 1-1/4 cups), 1-1/4 cup sugar, 1 cup of brown sugar, 3 eggs, a big splash of vanilla, 1-3/4 cups of flour, 2 tsp baking powder, and 1/2 tsp salt. I baked it in a 9x13 pan for around 30 minutes, but the oven was closer to 325. They turned out really well! Not so much a brownie as a chewy bar. I iced it with Chocolate Frosting I from this site, delicious! Thanks for sharing, Jo!

I had never tried peanut butter brownies but love the taste of peanut butter so gave this recipe a try.  What a pleasant surprise.  They are excellent and were a big hit at work.  After reading some of the other reviews, I made a double recipe and baked in a 9x13 pan with only one alteration.  I only used 3 eggs and the result was a chewy moist brownie like bar with a wonderful peanut butter flavor.  I will definitely use this one again.

This is a quick and easy dessert. I just fixed one today it was great! I've made these PB brownies about three times before and I am not a peanut butter fan at all these brownies changed that for me and now I keep a jar of peanut butter in my pantry just so I can make these. I would also like to add that you can omit the salt because the butter and the peanut butter has plenty of  salt already in them. DO NOT beat until fluffy! You will have a cake like brownie. One person suggested using a fork to blend the butter and peanut butter, then use a spoon to mix in the rest of the ingredients. This will keep you from over mixing. I followed her suggestions and they turned out better than the previous ones. Thanks for this great recipe.

I followed FOODWIZ's advice about not using a mixer and not beating the eggs till fluffy, but instead  "Used a fork to mix together the butter and peanut butter, then mix in the sugars, then the egg and vanilla, and then the dry ingredients with a spoon."
With that I give it a four star rating, even though I didn't follow the recipe in the making. I did use all the ingredients listed. My 20 month old son LOVES then and I think they are fantastic!

I've made these several times and they're always a hit!  I use crunchy PB and add 1 rounded cup of chocolate chips.  I increase the serving size to 24 and bake them in a 9X13 glass baking dish for 30 minutes and they are the perfect thickness!  They stay nice and chewy kept at room temp in an airtight container for a few days!  They are a great treat to take to a potluck or BBQ!

I don't know what I did wrong. But the brownie rose and fell. The outside was crisp and the inside was chewy. The taste however was fantastic.

Made these following the recipe exactly (used butter instead of margarine) and then sprinkled chocolate chips on top prior to baking. They are fabulous! Next time I make them, I will probably not put the chocolate chips on top before baking. I will put them on after removing from the oven and spread out the chocolate chips once melted. I've read a lot of other reviews and am quite suprised. Mine did not come out dry or cake like. They are great. Give them a try!

These are a pretty good base.  I mix them by hand and add a lot of chocolate chips.  I also add more peanut butter depending on how I feel.  My husband is the peanut butter lover and he loves them with those additions.  They would be lackluster without them...

After reading some reviews,  I added an extra 1/3 cup of peanut butter, added chocolate semi sweet chips and cooked brownies at 325. The texture was perfect and chewy. Daughter loved them. Definitely will make again.

Looooooove these!!! Reminds me of the "peanut butter bars" my mom used to make when I was a little girl. So easy to make, and I always have these ingredients on hand. I even used all-natural peanut butter and it turned out great. This one's a keeper!

I made these with Gluten Free flour and they are wonderful. They were more cakey and soft like a thick cookie rather than chewy and they had only a slight peanut butter taste. I also added chocolate chips. We loved them!!!

I made these as written except used an 8x8 pan.  They were *so* yummy!  I baked them for 26 mins. and they turned out fantastic.  Coated in Chocolate Frosting I, this recipe is definitely a keeper!  Thanks!

very easy and yummy recipe! i used a 9x13 casserole and baked at 325 for 40 minutes, as others suggested. i  mixed in peanut butter and chocolate morsels. the only improvements that need to be made (on my part and not the recipe's) is to cook maybe 5 more minutes (the center was still a little doughy), and to add more chocolate morsels to the top, after baking possibly, just to achieve a chocolate/peanut butter combo. otherwise, just as is, this is a great dessert! (i have made this twice now, and we gobble them up in record time!)

Made the changes Miller 676 suggested, but it still came out like a cake, though I may have over mixed it.  i also didn't add the chocolate glaze.  It has a good enough flavor that i will definitely try to make it again with less mixing and chocolate glaze.  Everyone at work really enjoyed it though.

I thought it was pretty good.  It is actually less brownie like and more giant soft peanut butter cookie. I only used one egg.  I was a litte questionable with the consistency after all the ingredients were mixed together but it came out okay.

The texture leaves a lot to be desired. If I make them again, I will tinker with the proportions to get a chewier, more brownie-like (less gooey) texture.

I really like these a lot, and used a very simple chocolate glaze (sweetened condensed milk, chocolate chips and vanilla from this site) to make them perfect.  I will be using this recipe frequently - thanks very much for the posting!

My daughter made these and substituted cocoa for 1/2 of the flour, and cooked them for 10 min. less (maybe just our oven). They were fantastic, gooey, perfect, peanut butter brownies. Will definatley make these again.

This did not turn out for me in a 9x9 pan. It was too thick and as a result I ended up with very crunchy hard overdone edges and a very gooey underdone middle. I think it would have turned out much better in a larger pan. They were tasty though so I'll probably give them another shot.

Eh...these were just okay.  I followed the recipe as written (except used butter because I didn't have margarine) and I would have to agree with other reviewers that they didn't have a strong, definite flavor.  Mine also turned out gooey rather than chewy.

Pretty good, but not sure they would have been much without the chocolate chips added at the end.  I guess I thought they would have an unmistakable peanut butter taste, but they were really like a non-descript sweet bar.  Hmm..not sure where to start to kick them up a notch.  Maybe some peanut butter chips added?

Really good - like other people, I doubled the recipe, increased the pb by a few tbs, decreased the flour a little, and used 3 instead of 4 eggs in the doubled recipe. This came out amazing, though I will use less sugar next time, it was really sweet. I put choc chips in it and disappeared quickly.

Great recipe if you are a peanut butter fan. I really missed the chococateyness of regular brownies, though, so I added chocolate chips. Next time, I think I will add some cocoa powder to add a bit more chocolate flavour as well.

These were delicious and a great addition to our plate of Christmas cookies this year.  Gave it four stars only because cooking time should of been less because edges were a bit overcooked crusted.  I cut off edges, and the rest were super yummy! Next time, I plan to cook less time, and on possibly on 325.

I've made these brownies several times now, and they're so good! I only make a few changes: I use butter instead of margarine, and I mix in a cup of chocolate chips (semi-sweet and/or milk chocolate). I also use natural peanut butter. My oven tends to cook things quicker, so they were ready in about twenty-five minutes. Good stuff!

These were delicious.  I took another viewers suggestion and increased the peanut butter and decreased the butter.  I also doubled the recipe.I mixed together peanut butter and milk chocolate chips and sprinkled those on the top before baking.  My guests went crazy over them.  I will be making these again that is for sure.

These were delicious.  All of my kids and husband (who are all peanut butter lovers) really likes these.  They do stay soft and fresh for a few days if you store them covered.  I made them just as printed.

Good, but not stellar by any means. I cut the flour by 1/4 cup, and baked them for 5 minutes less, hoping to increase the chewiness. It didn't work. Putting the word "Chewy" in the title is misleading. They're roughly akin to a short peanut butter cookie, just in bar shape. The texture is more sable (like Pecan Sandies)  than chewy. Nothing wrong with a sable texture, but when the recipe is billed with the first word "Chewy, that's what I expect to get.  I added coarsely chopped dark chocolate and spread with a thin layer of melted dark chocolate while still warm. Might make them again, not sure. But if there is a next time I'll know what to expect. My peanut butter cookies are actually chewier than these, so although they take more time, we like the results better than these.

I read the reviews and definitely wanted chewy, not cake-like, brownies, so I doubled the recipe and added one less egg and 1/3 cup less flour. I also added an extra 1/3 cup of peanut butter. I also added two cups of milk chocolate chips. They were AMAZING. I bake often, and everyone said this was the best thing I've ever made.  I made them for my boyfriend, who took them home last night, and now I wish I had kept a few for myself! Definitely a repeat recipe :)

This recipe is very good as is, but in my opinion it turned out better the second time I made it with a few modifications. The first time the brownies were more cake-like, and when I have a brownie, I expect it to be more fudgy. The second time I made it I doubled it, left out one of the eggs (so that was 3 eggs in the doubled version), and reduced the flour by 1/2 cup. I also added chocolate chips as shown in the picture--so much easier to pack in a lunch than something with icing. With those modifications, I thought it was absolutely amazing! A great change from a regular chocolate brownie.

This is the perfect peanut butter cookie in a bar!  Quick and easy.  Delicious!  I doubled this recipe for a 9 x 13 pan but used only 3 eggs.  I added peanut butter chips which is a must in the perfect peanut butter cookie.  We *loved* these!  Also, for a 9 x 13 pan I found that baking for 30 minutes at 325 worked well.

Great recipe!!  I followed the advice of another user and I didn't beat the ingredients with a mixer at all. In fact I only used one bowl--mixed the PB and butter then added the sugars, followed by the eggs and vanilla (used 1 tbl), then the dry ingredients. I used a cupcake pan and made 12 cupcakes at 325 for about 20 min.       Thanks for submitting!

These are out of this world.  My husband doesn't care for peanut butter and can't keep his hands out of the cookie tin....The second time I made these I used crunchy peanut butter and increased the amount to 3/4 cup....YUM_O

These are really good brownies...  I did, however, make them as recommended by a previous reviewer.  I doubled the recipe, added 1/3 C. pb, used only 3 eggs, 1/3 C. less flour, and after the brownies were finished cooking, I placed several hershey bars on top... waited a few minutes then spread it over the top.  It was really good.  Thank you for the recipe!

These turned out great! I only had an 8x8 inch pan, so they took longer to bake and they were still kind of soft in the middle, but they were very chewy and flavorful.  I added about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips which worked really well, I can see them being good with frosting too!  These were very easy and quick.

Very good, I didn't have margarine, so used butter and used Splenda instead of sugar, egg beaters instead of eggs.  Very yummy!  More cakelike than brownie-like though, next time I will use the recom. of another to use less egg(beaters) and baking soda for chewier brownies.  Added choc chips to the top when they were done.

These were fantastic! As per other reviews, I used one egg and just a bit less flour.  Mine weren't too sweet, as other had said, but I think that depends on what kind of peanut butter you use.  We use low-sugar, so I used the amount of sugar called for.  I also added chocolate chips, cause I can't live without 'em. Mine were a cross between a cookie and brownie - perfection!

I combined this recipe with the recipe for deep dish brownies from this site...YUM!  I mixed up the PB brownie recipe (omitting the salt and vanilla, using real butter) and pressed into a well buttered 9x13 glass baking dish.  Then I mixed the deep dish brownie recipe (again, using real butter, no added salt or vanilla) and spread over the top.  I baked them at 350 for about 30 minutes, absolutely wonderful!  I think these would probably be really good on their own, but I love chocolate and PB together.  The PB part works best on the bottom because it's a very thick dough and the chocolate part is much more spreadable.

The brownies taste was delicous, but they didn't cook as well as i would like. I cooked them for 40 minuets, and that still wasn't enough to get the inside to cook well. I would recomend to spread the brownie mix out into a thin layer so that they cokk better in the inside. But otherwise they were very good

Excellent! I like to sprinkle a cup or so of chocolate chips on the top of these right after they come out of the oven, let them melt, and then spread the melted chocolate over the brownies. It firms up and makes gives them a peanut-butter-cup taste! Soooo good! Plus it's easier than making a batch of frosting. Soooo good!

This is a fantastic recipe. If you're looking for an alternative to the same old brownies for a tea, picnic, or pot luck, give this recipe a whirl.   Of course, the quality of the peanut butter used effects the flavor but the texture of the brownies is wonderfully chewy.  I cream the sugars, butter, vanilla, and egg then fold in the dry ingredients until just combined. The finished batter looks very much like peanut butter fudge. I took the advice of the reviewer who suggested putting chocolate chips on the top. I spread approximately a half-cup of chips on the brownies hot out of the oven, shut the oven off and return the pan for a minute or so to melt the chocolate.  Once I remove the pan to a cooling rack, I spread the melted chocolate with a spatula and allow to cool. Bittersweet or dark chocolate would be good options, also.  This recipe is definitely joining my "favorites" file.

Used butter instead of marg, whole wheat flour, splenda in place of the brown sugar, and much more pb, probably 3/4 to 1 cup. No salt as the pb is salty enough, and also melted good Belgian chocolate with chopped hazelnuts over the top. I baked them at a bit lower temp since reviewers said they were gooey in the middle and hard at the edges... about 170 C, for about 45 mins. Kind of fell in the middle, but still... SO GOOD! Definitely need a glass of cold milk with these. Will make again, husband loves them!

This is a good recipe. I added a bit more peanutbutter and added peanut butter chips and milk chocolate chips to the top. It took a bit longer to cook than the recipe suggested but that could have just been my oven. I will use this recipe again and next time try frosting.

Really nice. I used 3/4 cup peanut butter, and omitted salt 'cause I'm not a big salt person and peanut butter's already salty. I also dumped in half a bag of peanut butter chips. I had to use part white sugar and part splenda that I have from my father's visit 'cause I ran out of white sugar. Cooked easily in 25 min. 
Very good.

i followed this recipe exactly and it turned out to not even taste like peanut butter. my family asked me what they were after tasting them and even after i told them they were peanut butter, they couldn't taste it at all. very bland recipe. if you perhaps added peanut butter chips or chocolate chips and frosted them they might be better. i will not make this again.

Good brownies. I doubled the recipe and baked these in a 9x13x2 pan. I reduced the temperature to 325F and baked for an extra 10-15 minutes. They were thick and moist, but the frosting would have been a good addition. I threw in mini-chocolate chips, too. Great recipe altogether.

Just terrific!!!  Made some today after work for my high school girls group at church!  They polished them off and my hubby tried one and asked that I make them again tonight after church so I made two batches in one night!  He wanted to bring them to his work so he'd be a star!  Like using recipes that call for margarine (even though I'd much rather bake with butter) because in my area, margarine is TONS cheaper!  YUM!!!!

I used an electric mixer until I needed to stir in the dry ingredients (flour, baking powder, and salt), then used a silicone spoon for the rest. Still kept the brownie texture! 

Next time I make this, may press in peanut butter morsels in the top, or use almond extract. Because I am THAT much of a nut fiend.

These are just so good.  I made them twice in three days.  I like to share them.  I did decrease the white sugar to 1/2 cup.  I made a simple peanut butter, powdered sugar and a little milk frosting for them.  If you love peanut butter, you will certainly love these.  Thank you Jo for sharing this wonderful recipe.

If you like peanut butter & brownies, you'll love these! I made them for a peanut-butter-loving friend and we finished 1/2 the (8x8) pan with our coffee. I froze the other 1/2 and they tasted just as good as the fresh ones when thawed after 3 weeks.  I tried the foil around the outside edge of the pan, but don't recommend it because the center got browned nicely but the edges were anemic-looking. I haven't quit craving these, so I'll be making them again today...

I tried this recipe for the first time today. I followed everything to the T, and made my own homemade Peanut Butter glaze for the top and Oh my Gosh. I am a huge fan of peanut butter and this nails two of my favorite foods. Brownies and Peanut Butter. Thank You so much for the recipe. I'm going to introduce this to Mom and watch her take a trip to heaven....LOL!!!!!!

Very good, and a nice change from regular brownies. I used applesauce instead of margarine, and ground flax instead of eggs. I added a heaping cup of chocolate chips to the flour mixture, and a chocolate glaze to the top. I will make these again!

Followed the advice of FOODWIZ and just mixed everything by hand so as not to OVERmix.  I added a handful of chocolate chips.  They were wonderful!  I used them as a base for brownie sundaes when we had company (including 2 little boys) over for dinner.  Everyone wished there was more!

My new favourite (non chocolate) recipe! Simple, quick and with every day ingredients. I do not change anything, though sometimes underbake them if they aren't to take somewhere. (underbaking makes them wonderfully gooey, but hard to serve nicely!)

I've been replacing butter/oil with applesauce in all my baking recipes and I think it's a nice improvement. I also used almond butter instead of p-nut butter. They were sooooooo good!

These were really, really good.  Make sure to mix by hand and do NOT overmix--that helped them stay chewy and more dense, like an actual brownie.  I folded in 1 cup of chocolate chips (who doesn't love peanut butter and chocolate?) and loved the combo.  My only issue was that it took longer to bake then instructed--30-35 minute time frame just wasn't long enough to ensure they were completely baked in the middle.  Will for sure make again.

I was disappointed.  They sounded so good, but I had such trouble with them baking.  They wouldn't cook in the center at all, it was still wet dough.  I baked it a little longer, and then longer again, and by that time, they were hard.  May have been cook's error, but I won't try making them again, unfortunately.

My best friend always made these for me with an extra 2/3 up chocolate chips thrown in back when we were in high school.  10 years later we live in different cities and I've taken to making this every couple months.  A very good recipe!

I followed another reviewer's suggestions and it turned out very crumbly on the outside, mushy and almost rancid on the inside. I'm somewhat new to allrecipes/baking, so for any other beginners, I suggest you try the recipe first and then modify it. I'll give this recipe another try tomorrow. (rating this 3 stars- it seems very promising :))

Very yummy. Took the advice of another reviewer and did not beat but just creamed the butter/sugar and then mixed carefully only to blend. I also used butter ,added white chocolate chips and only baked them for 25 minutes to make sure they were nicely gooey. Served them with a scoop of chocolate ice cream. My dinner guests loved them!

Very good -- and chewy! I cut the white sugar to 1/3 cup, and the brown sugar to 1/3 cup packed, and it was plenty sweet. Added an extra couple tablespoons of PB. Used chunky PB. Also added about 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Baked just over 25 minutes. Sprinkled with powdered sugar. DO NOT over-bake!

These were awesome. Nice and chewy the way a brownie should be. However, I took some hints from other reviewers when I made these. I made a double recipe and cut the eggs back to 3 instead of 4. I didn't cream the butter-sugar until fluffy, just mixed everything by hand like one reviewer suggested. And I only baked the double recipe for 25 minutes in a 10x15 baking dish. A 10x15 pan produced brownies about 3/4 inch thick.

These came out fantastic.  I prepared them as directed & they were great.  After reading some of the reviews, I checked to see if they were done before indicated & they definitely needed some more time.  They were a big hit & I'm making them again RIGHT NOW!!!  :)  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Chewy not cake-like which we really liked.  Mixed all ingredients by hand rather than using my mixer.  I think this helped with the chewyness factor.  Used whole wheat flour, natural almond butter and egg beaters.  Baked for 30 minutes in an 8x8 pan.  Family loved them.  Did add 3/4 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips.

These are great and super easy. I added chocolate frosting while they were still warm. They were gone by the next day!

These are fantastic! I added ingredients as written, but per other reviews I baked at 325 for 25-30 mins. I did the toothpick test and pulled them the minute the toothpick came out clean; was afraid of over-baking. I added "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" from this site. The final result was chewy and gooey...just perfect! Will definitely make these again.

Delicious! My husband said they tasted like reeses. I sprinkled semi-sweet choc chips on top, but next time i'm going to make choc frosting. This is definately a keeper!

I would like to start by saying....I am a picky baker. Only the best recipes for my family.  HAVING said that, I want everyone to know that these peanut butter brownies are AWESOME!!!!!  We tried these approximately 20 minutes after they came out of the oven and the texture is wonderful.  I mixed with a wooden spoon used about 1 tablespoon less flour and sprinkled peanut butter chips and chocolate chips over the top before baking for 29 minutes. If these are as good cooled then we have a new favorite at my house.

I threw in some mini chocolate chips (they don't sink in batter like regular ones do), then covered it with ganache after cooling.  Delish!  They bake up nice and tall, too.

These brownies were very good but just a little dry.  I added a peanut butter topping from "Monkey Peanut Butter Bars" and that helped.  I think next time I will cook them just a little less.  My husband is a real peanut butter lover and he did enjoy these.  We will have them again.  Thank you for the recipe.

Really good and moist! Disclaimer: I also cut back on the flour and added about 1/3 cup more of peanut butter, to ensure creaminess. They turned out AMAZINGLY well.

I halved the baking powder, added a cup of chocolate chips to the batter, only used one egg and the egg yolk from the other.  Lastly, I added "Brownie Frosting", a recipe I found on this site. :-) These were soooo good, and they actually tasted better the longer they sat after baking.

I was really looking forward to this recipe and followed it to a T, but it wound up being horrible -- not brownie or cake like at all. I tossed it in the trash.  I won't be making this again.

Yummy! I doubled the recipe and added white chocolate chips. I also dropped in about 3/4 cup of shredded coconut. Used a 9x13 pyrex baking dish and baked for about 45 minutes. Super good.

Loved this recipe!  My brownies turned out perfectly.  I read the other reviews and added a bit more peanut butter (2 tbsps) and about 1/4 c. more flour as the dough seemed too runny. I also added 2/3 c. of semi-sweet choc. chips.   I followed the advice of one reviewer and just used a spoon to mix the wet ingredients and same when adding the dry ingredients.  I used a 9X13 pan and baked for 30 min.  I didn't frost them because they're great as is.  Awesome chewy brownies!  Will def make again!

These were pretty good!  I made them exactly as the recipe stated.  They turned out shaped like  brownie without the "brown"!  However, we are peanut butter lovers so no one complained.  It actually tasted a lot like a nice, soft peanut butter cookie only thicker.  They were quite easy to make and I will more than likely make these again.

wow! really, really great recipe! not overly peanut-buttery, but enough for my taste. i used 1/3 cup + 1/2 cup brown sugar and only 1/3 cup granulated sugar to make sure they came out extra moist and chewy, and that worked very well. they were moist and chewy for 3-4 days after baking!

These brownies are TO-DIE-FOR!!!!  I just put another pan in the oven.  I doubled them b/c I'm taking them over to a friend's house who just had a baby.  If you like PB, then you'll love these.  I also add milk-chocolate chips...YUM!  Edited to say that this is a recipe that you will come back to and come back to, time after time!  I have another pan in the oven as week speak.  I've made these at least 4x since my original post.

These are absolutely delicious (after cooling them completely -- I never like hot peanut butter, esp. as it tastes less sweet). I used nearly all organic ingredients, including natural (no sugar or salt) organic peanut butter. Thanks to other reviewers' suggestions, I added 1 tsp vanilla and 1/3 cup (organic) semi-sweet chocolate chips rather than frosting them. It's just a matter of preference. I've made these now 4 times, and they turn out moist and chewy, and everyone loves them! One thing I recommend is to take them out after 25 minutes (don't wait for the toothpick to come clean, though the top should look solid), and let them continue to bake in the pan as they cool. This creates soft, chewy, moist brownies. :)

I made these for my kids and if the bus doesn't come soon, there won't be any left for them.  I doubled the recipe (only adding 3 eggs and a little less than double the flour to avoid the cakey-ness).  I did melt chocolate chips for the top.  Very good recipe - not quite what I know as "brownies" but very good nonetheless.  Where's that bus!

This was so much better than I expected, tasted better the next day.  Hubby took some to a gathering and came back with only the Costco cupcakes I was trying to get rid of :-).  Anyway, the only thing I did was use real butter instead of margarine, you could add chocolate, but I liked it plain, kind of like a gooey peanut butter cookie.

I'm not a peanut butter LOVER, but these were so good.  I added choc chips to top after they came out of the oven.  I will add them to the batter next time I make these, and yes there will be a next time.
Maybe tomorrow!!!!

These were a hit with my husband. He's a big peanut butter dessert fan. Huge. 
These were really simple to make. I baked
them 10 minutes longer to make them more
brownie-like, as suggested by another cook. Next time, I'll add some kind of 
nut meat and chocolate chips, for 
a different taste.

The only complain about this recipe is that everyone loves it so much they keep bugging me to make it again.:)
I didnt use the chocolate frosting. Just sprinkled some semi sweet chocolate chips on top before I baked it and it is a hit!!

I made 1 1/2 times the recipe and put it into a 9x13 pan.  I also added half a bag of chocolate chips right before baking.  These were absolutely delicious.  Very moist!

I think my expectations were too high.  I love peanut butter and was expecting something more fudge-like.  I think the overall flavor wasn't distinctly peanutty and they were too sweet.  If I make these again, I'll reduce the sugar, add more peanut butter and follow others' recommendations for less flour and only one egg.

Not quite cake, not quite brownie.  It's a nice in between.  I used crunchy peanut butter and added peanut butter chips to make it a little bit more peanuttier.  I liked it much better that some blondie recipes I've tried.

Mmmmm... so good. Nice and chewy and not too sweet. I like to cream the butter/sugar by hand to help keep the brownes dense and moist.

Dee-lish!  I baked it in a larger pan than called for in the recipe,(8 x 12 in.) which yeided a less cake-y brownie, but still moist.  I followed others' advice and melted a 12 oz package of milk chocolate/peanut butter chips on top while it was still warm, spreading the melted chips like frosting.  Can't wait to make again.  Thanks!

OMG! These are the best, to-die-for, absolutely amazing brownies. I tweaked it a bit, threw in a few handfuls of mini, vegan chocolate chips and some salted roasted peanuts. I just might finish the entire pan myself!!!! Make these as soon as you can!

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, but I baked the brownies in a 9-inch round since I don't have a square pan, then cut them into wedges. I could hardly wait to dig in, and cut the brownies too soon so the first serving fell apart. Let them cool 10 minutes or more.

We loved these.  They bake up nice and even and are easy to cut.  They're dense and chewy, just as the title promises.  We'll be making these often.

Good- it got a little too dark around the edges but it was still good.  I used half whole wheat pastry flour, natural peanut butter, and reduced the white sugar a lttle.  The texture was chewy, but not quite as chewy as a regular brownie.  I frosted these with a dark chocolate frosting.

My husband, the peanut butter lover, gave this a "strong" 4 1/2 stars, but since that's not an option, I factored in my own rating and gave the recipe 4 stars. Very good, very easy to whip up! I sprinkled a half cup or so of chocolate chips on top directly after removing the bars from the oven. Waited for them to melt and spread them to create a thin layer of chocolate on top. Yum!

These were simply delicious! Very moist and chewy--just as we like them to be. I did add a bit more peanut butter than 1/2 cup, I used about 3/4 cup. I made it even more tasty by preparing a rich chocolate frosting from cocoa powder to spread on top. A tad more decadent than a Resee Peanut Butter cup! Will surely make again soon.

These where good and easy to make, but I dont think I will make again unless I tripple the amount of peanut butter. I love peanut butter, and was hoping to taste more of a peanut butter cookie in brownie form

These were very simple and turned out well.  I like a slightly more peanut-buttery taste, so next time, I may add a little bit more peanut butter.  Overall, they are really good...I think I may try to sprinkle chocolate chips on the top next time.

I had never heard of brownies without chocolate in them, but these were pretty good. I added in ~ 3/4 c miolk chocolate chips. I, like others, found the inside to still be wet even when the edges are getting dark. Is it supposed to be like that? My husband loved them and rated them a 4 to 4.5. I'll probably be making these again, and trying to get the inside to cook more. And I won't be calling them "brownies" but rather "peanut butter bars". Thanks for the recipe!

These were good!  I'll definitely be making them again.
ETA: Changing my rating to 5-star.  I made these again and put white chocolate chips on top.  They were soooo good! I made them in a glass dish and think 30 minutes is the perfect cooking time.

These brownies were really good.  They reminded me exactly of the peanut butter brownies in our school lunch program 25 years ago that enticed all the students to eat school lunch the day they were offered.   I followed the recipe exactly as written and they came out perfect.  Thanks Jo for the taste down memory lane.

These were good with 3/4 cup of reduced fat peanut butter, light margerine, and egg beaters.  The only problem was that mine came out cakey like the rest of the viewers.  I overbaked a tad because the middle was still doughy and two minutes later is was too brown.  Make sure you reduce the heat if you are using 9 X 13!  Still good taste though with chocolate chips on top.

I was expecting more of a peanut butter taste. They were on the dry side. Maybe I should have added the chocalate chips. My 4 year old did like them. I am not sure if I will try again.

These are really great.  Don't have a 9x9 pan, so I used an 8x8 pan and lowered the temp to 325 degrees.  Cooked them for about 40 minutes and they came out great.  Added chocolate chips to the batter and topped them with melted chocolate chips.  Yummy!  Great for peanut butter lovers like my MIL.

This is a five-star recipe for sure! Made EXACTLY as directed in an 8x8 square pan and baked for about 33 minutes. The bars came out PERFECTLY. Chewy and moist and flavorful without being overpowering. Hubby would have rated this a 10/5 if he could. I don't even really care for peanut butter and I couldn't stop eating these bars! Make the recipe, folks, stop with all your tweaks and substitutions! The recipe is perfect as it is!

I make this recipe probably 1-2 times a week since first trying it back in August. Everyone LOVES it, they ask for it over and over,  and I don't mind one bit because it is so easy to make and tastes absolutely delicious. I add Reese's brand peanut butter chips , or occasional unwrapped mini Reese's.

These were good. I think the peanut butter could be increased a bit. I also added some semi sweet chocolate chips which I think are essential for this recipe.

Update: after making this a second time, we upped the peanut butter to 3/4 c, 3/4 t vanilla and added 2/3 cup chocolate chips. This was ready after about 40 minutes.

If you are interested in making a healthier version, I used natural peanut butter and substituted 1/3 C. of light olive oil for the margarine.  They turned out fantastic and I couldn't stop eating them.

Oh these were really delicious!  I loved the light peanut butter flavor in these.  You could up the peanut butter if you wanted them to be more rich in the peanut butter flavor.  I went exactly by the recipe except I did not whip the mixture until fluffy.  I hand stirred with a whisk to incorporate the ingredients together, because I like a dense chewy brownie and not an airy cake like brownie.  I cooked at about 32 min. just until they were slightly undercooked and they were perfect!  I did see many people icing these with chocolate icing.  But I didn't want to take away from the main brownie flavor.  So I did add about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips on top while backing.  I agreed and my hubby also said to up the chips on top.  So I think next time I will use 1 cup and do half chocolate and half peanut butter chips on top to bake in.  These were delicious and will for sure make again!  They were still great a few days later, chewy and moist like we like them.  Thank you for the great recipe!

This recipe is AWESOME!! The only thing I would recommend to differently is to double the recipe because when I made it, it was pretty thin. This would also go pretty good with some form of chocolate, maybe next time put chocolate chips in it. The brownie is also pretty crumbly but that is to be expected from the peanut butter:)

I was looking for a Peanut Butter  BROWNIE. This recipe doubled was perfect and chewy.  Using a 9x13 pan at 325° it took a little under 35 minutes.  My topping worked really well and cut like a dream.  I made a milk chocolate ganache with 2 cups good milk Choc Chip put into 1/2 cup heavy cream with 1  tbsp unsalted butter.  Let sit until spreadable after melting then pour or spread over warm brownies.  I added Reeses Pieces to the top and let them cool overnight.  They cut beautifully in the morning.  They were gone by noon. :). For ganache bring 1/2 cup heavy cream and butter to a quick boil ... Take off heat and drop in the chips.  Add vanilla if you like, about 1/2 tsp nd stir until dissolved.  I used a small whisk and spread it with an offset spatula.

Turned out really moist and delicious. Love peanut butter, this is a keeper! On a side note I reduced the sugar a bit (half a cup less) probably gonna do the same next then.

I've made these a few times and today they finally turned out perfect. I doubled the recipe, except the eggs, I used 1 large only.  I baked them at 350 for 25 minutes in a 9x13 glass dish.  If you bake them longer than 25 minutes, you'll probably wish you hadn't.

We ate them but the flavor is lacking.  Made exactly as written and they came out perfectly cooked. Nice and chewy. They just didn't have a great peanut butter flavor. Won't make this recipe again.

They are a bit too salty, not enough peanut butt. 
I made a fresh batch last night and 'tweaked' them; 3/4 cup of peanut butter,1/3 cup (stick butter) softened, 3/4 cup of white sugar, 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 2 eggs, 1tsp of vanilla, 1 cup of flour, 1/2tsp of baking powder, and last but not least a PINCH of salt. I baked them in a 9x9 pan @350 for 25-30 minutes, let them cool and added a chocolate drizzle. Put them in a container and sat them on the counter over night with a concealed lid over them to keep them fresh. Tried one today and went back for a second one!!!

I followed the recipe exactly, but I wasn't expecting such a thick batter. The batter was more like cookie dough than brownie mix. I felt like it did not make a lot because I had to spread it pretty thin in the pan. I had to make them 24 hrs ahead of time and by the time I got to cutting them, they were really dry. Chewy, but too dry. More like cookie bars than brownies. Maybe I baked them too long? I will try this recipe again and do some things differently. They were a hit at the party I took them to!

Great recipe. Easy to make and the family loves them.
TIP: melt the peanut butter and butter together in a saucepan instead of creaming them.  Very easy and turns out delicious.
Also, mix in chocolate chips for the PB and choco combo!

I love this recipe!  I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup, because I don't like things too sweet.  It is still quite sweet.  The brownies are a bit delicate and cake-like, and they were moist.  Will make again and again.  I cooked for 35 min. in a 350 degree oven.  Have also topped with semi-sweet choc chips and peanut butter chips for a great result.

These were simple to make and tasted wonderful; crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside!  I made 2-bite brownies by using a mini muffin tin and baking for 14 minutes.  I got 35 2-bite brownies out of this recipe.  Thanks for sharing, Jo!

I baked these in an 8x8 glass pan for 35 min, and they were just slightly underbaked, the way the best brownies are.  However, these were a little short on flavor.  They need either icing or some added nuts or chips.

Great find! My family loves peanut butter and I was looking for a new way to use it in dessert. This is s great way to change up the same old boring brownies! I mixed by hand just until well combined and I made the following adjustments: I put the butter and peanut butter in the microwave for about 30 seconds to make it soft . I used Splenda in place of sugar and only baked for about 20 minutes. I topped mine with an icing as follows:
1 tablespoon softened butter
4 tablespoons peanut butter 
1 tablespoon milk
2 tablespoons honey
1/2 cup powdered sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
Mix all together by hand and pour over warm (not hot) brownies.

I added chocolate chips to the recipe and baked in an 8x8 pan. They were good, but cake like and too sweet for my taste (but that's just my preference). I'll probably try these again, but follow some reviews to make them more chewy and brownie like.

Before baking, try sprinkling chocolate chips on top, put in oven for 3 minutes, take out and run knife through melted chips to marbleize and then return to oven to finish baking. Yum!

I wasn't thrilled with the consistency of these - they weren't quite as brownie-y as I wanted them. A bit more cakey. BUT they tasted great, and I would make them again.  I used 100% natural PB and added a good 1/3 c. cocoa to the mix, and chocolate chips.  For icing I just melted margarine and semi-sweet chocolate chips, added some icing sugar and vanilla, and spread over the warm baked brownies.  I sprinkled a wee bit of sea salt on the icing as it cooled to cut the sweetness.  That might sound weird but no one notices that there is salt on it, unless you tell them. If you don't say anything all you hear is "can I get the recipe for these??"

Made a double batch - Used 2 cups brown sugar and no white, ..definitely would have been too sweet with the extra 1/3 cup.  Baked for 25 minutes in a 9x13 pan - came out really tasty.

I love PB so was excited to find this EASY recipes.  I will make these again.  I used a fork to mix and 9x13, light colored pain to keep them light.  I think I just found out that dark pan cook to fast.  Anywho...I thought these did not have a strong PB flavor so next time I all add more PB.  I also thought they were too sweet, will use less white sugar next time but will make again...Boyfriend rated a on scale 1-10 as an 7-8, so with tweaking I think I can get a 10.  Nice basic recipe to put into rotation.

This is my FAVORITE recipe! Every year at our annual baking party I get requests for this recipe. I do add peanutbutter chips to the recipe but other than that I make it as it says. If you like peanut butter you def have to try these!!

These tasted like a peanut butter cookie bar not really a brownie, which was fine with me!  I sprinkled chocolate chips on the top before baking.  I would make these again.

Followed the recipe to a T and they turned out wonderfully. My cook time was a bit closer to 40-45 minutes. Also, I added some peanut butter frosting to the top and they were a big hit!

These were easy to make, and tasty, but a little dry. Next time I will bake for less time. I topped it hot out of the oven with semisweet chocolate chips, to make an easy glaze. Thanks!

These bars really didn't have much taste. I think maybe a crunchy peanut butter would have helped or a peanut butter glaze as one of the reviewers had done from their picture. If I had my eyes closed I would have guessed I had just eaten a very plain blond brownie. Also, take these out a little before they are done like cookies otherwise they will harden. The full suggested time is way to long. Start checking on them after 25 minutes so they stay soft when cooled. Adding something with peanuts or peanut butter this has potential to be a good dessert bar.

These came out delicious. Ending up making a serving of 24. My boyfriend enjoyed them, and started nabbing at them! I was a little hard on myself because I expected them to be chewier, but that's probably because I left them in for 35 minutes to be safe. Next time I'll add frosting/filling,and leave them in the oven for 30 minutes or less. Their so tasty!

I just made these tonight & they came out so yummy. I skipped using a mixer/blender & just used a fork & spoon to stir.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I sprinkled a few chocolate chips on top of the batch before baking. I baked them for the full 35 minutes & they came out chewy & soft. YUMM!!

These are really good.  I added chocolate chips, next time I might add a bit more peanut butter.  I baked for about 32 mins, next time I'd bake a little longer.  Thanks =)

Refreshing alternative to fudge brownies! 

I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of using cooking spray to grease an 8x8 glass dish, not a 9x9. 

I used a fork to mix everything until each part was well blended. I baked it for 30 minutes, then another 4-5 after checking it. It didn't really bounce back, but it was just starting to brown nicely. 

These were the chewiest, best brownies ever. The peanut butter is perfect, without being too overwhelming. They were all eaten within a day! Which may not be a good thing... ;) 

P.S. I meant to take a picture, but we were so excited about trying them we forgot!! lol

Delicious! My friend and I experimented and added chocolate chips to some, swirled in chocolate syrup for others, and left the rest plain peanut butter. They were a hit and disappeared in one night!

I made  a few changes...I used whole wheat flour just to make it a bit healthier...I used chunky peanut butter for more texture and added almost 1/3 cup of cocoa because I wanted it more brownie-like (chocolatey). They turned out amazing and didn't even need frosting or anything on top.

Everyone seemed to love these, but I thought they were a bit too rich.  They definitely need some sort of a chocolate frosting.  They seem to lack without it.  
I made a basic chocolate frosting out of chocolate chips, and poured that on the top of the brownies once they came out of the oven. Next time, I'll add chocolate chips as well.  
Definitely a good starter recipe.

I doubled the recipe, ommitting one egg, and added about a cup of chocolate chips. I baked it in a 9x13 pan for 45 minutes (my oven runs slow), and these were perfection!

I followed suggestions of other reviewers and doubled the recipe, added more peanut butter and used only 3 eggs. These brownies were quite good. Next time I will try to add chocolate chips or chocolate frosting.

I made these with butter instead of marg and a thin layer of Rich Chocolate Frosting also from AR.  A great breakup treat for my roommate!  These are really tasty without the choc, but sometimes girls need a bit more decadence :)

This is a great recipe.  I made it for my boyfriend for his birthday, who also loves chocolate and cherries.  I added a jar of marachino cherries to the mixture, and chopped up chucks of white almond bark and covered the top of it before placing it in the oven.  He really enjoyed it!

My pan must have been more like an 8x8 and 33 - 35 minutes probably would have been the best for the center ones.  I think I went 30.  I topped with some choc chips and p.b. chips.  Yum Yum.

Just made these and while baking it smelled really good but I'm a little dissapointed with the outcome. They do taste ok but after baking for 27 min the bottom burned a little but the center is kind of still under cooked. I also find it doesn't really taste like much, needs more peanut butter and the vanilla that it calls for is useless, don't taste it at all. I'm glad I added chocolate chips otherwise it would be a big waste. Sorry probably won't make again, its a good idea though

very delicious!  i had to substitute butter flavored shortening for the margarine because it is what i had on hand and they turned out terrific.  I used an 8x8 pan lined with aluminum foil and the edges were nice and chewy.  i will surely make these again.

This recipe needs more peanut butter & less flour! It is too cake-like and dry. Definitely do not bake for the recommended 30 minutes- 25 minutes is more than enough! Good recipe, but I wouldn't make it again without making some changes!

Pretty good, although I struggled to get the right chewiness, but didn't have exactly the right sized pan. We ate them all up nonetheless.

Very easy to make.  Tastes great.  I agree with another reviewer, just bake for about 25 min. for the gooey type of brownie. If you cook much longer, it will be cake like and probably a little dry.  Thanks for the fast and last minute evening dessert.

I placed a square of Cadbury Dark chocolate out of the oven on each piece that would be cut into squares when the brownies cooled. Also, I followed Sandy's custom version and cut down on the butter in favour of more peanut butter. YUM!

Made these last week and found the flavor was pretty good but the texture was too cake like. I am always hunting for a good peanut butter recipe for my son who loves all things peanut butter. I would try these again if I could make them chewier, maybe less eggs(?) Thanks

Wow, these disappeared like there was no tomorrow. They are like a giant peanut butter pan cookie. Very very good and would be even better with a chocolate frosting on top. The batter was super thick and I had to spread it out in a quarter sheet pan but they sure turned out great. Family raved and that makes me smile.

These were a huge hit in my house! I cooked them for no more than 28 minutes so they were slightly under done. After they cooled I spread a thin layer of peanut butter and then chocolate fudge frosting on the top... they were chewy, rich, and incredible!

I used real butter but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  I baked in an 8x11 dish that I'd sprayed with Pam.  Baked exactly 25 minutes, pulled out and let cool.  Frosted with the Peanut Butter Frosting recipe that was recommended below.  It's a hit with my peanut butter loving hubby!!

I made this recipe today with a few alterations because of the many comments about it being cake-like, and it turned out soooo delicious!  I increased PB to 2/3 cup, increased margarine to 1/2 cup; decreased flour to 2/3 cup; added 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips; and topped it with Hershey's Chocolate Fudge Frosting. This is now a favorite in our house.

These were super easy to make and surprisingly delicious!  I only had salted butter so I replaced the margarine and omitted the salt from the recipe.  Turned out great.  I also baked using an 8x8 pan for about 37 minutes or so.  The top does not spring back in the center, only on the edges where it's more well done.  It would have been too dry if I baked until it sprung back in the center.

I’m giving only 3 stars because I changed the recipe quite a lot to get it where I wanted it to be. First off I nearly tripled the peanut butter, when all was said and done I used almost a cup and a half. I tasted it with just the ½ cup it called for and could hardly taste any peanut butter at all. I also replaced the white sugar with honey, decreased the flour to 2/3 cup and decreased the egg to only one and had to add some water to get it the consistency of brownie batter and not cookie dough. This was all in an effort to make it a more chewy “fudgy” consistency rather than cookie or cake consistency which is what a lot of people commented it was like. When all was said and done it tasted fantastic and came out very chewy and moist but surprisingly light at the same time. I frosted with dark chocolate homemade frosting and I really liked them. They aren’t something REALLY special though that I would bring somewhere to impress but I would definitely make them again for me and the family.

These are so amazing! I didn't have any chocolate chips to add to the batter which would have made them even better or any chocolate icing. Soft and chewy, easy to make and I usually have all of the ingredients on hand. I used 1/3 cup shortening instead of the butter/margarine and I used all white sugar with a bit of golden syrup to replace the brown sugar. Thanks for posting this recipe I will definitely be making it again.

Very nice, but perhaps I should add more PB and less butter (I used butter as we don't buy margarine - I also use 'no added salt, no added sugar' PB). We all like them. I added Choc Chips to a batch, that was a good idea. REALLY decadent cut in small slices and served (with fruit) with the 'EAGLE BRAND® Chocolate Fondue' from this site.

Like everyone else has said, these are more like cake.  Without the added chocolate chips that others suggested, these wouldn't be worth making.  I and my coworkers thought these were just "ok".  Be careful not to overbake them - 20-30 minutes is appropriate, at 35 minutes they will be overdone and dry.  I used butter since I don't use any trans fats any more (manmade fats - margarine, shortening).  I will not make these again.

These were pretty good.  I had to cook them longer than the 25 minutes - it was probably about 30 minutes, and they turned out perfect - soft and peanut buttery.  They basically taste like peanut butter cookies - I might add 1/2 cup cocoa next time, as I think it chocolate-peanutbutter would be an improvement over the current peanut butter alone.  I added, like others, chocolate chips (ie. crushed Hershey milk chocolate bars), and they really add to the tastiness factor.  I would make again.  Give it a try!
-----------
SECOND TIME:  Just ok this time - followed the recipe exactly.  Consistency more like a cake than a brownie.  Next time would stick with adding chocolate.

I should give this recipe 0 stars for the directions.  30 minutes is WAY TOO LONG for these brownies.  I took mine out after 22 and they were already dry, I can't imagine how they would come out if someone actually followed the recipe.  1/3 cup of butter is not enough to make moist brownies.  These were dry and crumbly.  I would advise if you are going to make this to add more butter (maybe 1 stick), lessen the flour (by 1/4 cup) and bake for only 20-25 minutes (depending on your oven).  I'm not going to bother making this again.  Wasted my time and half a jar of peanut butter on this recipe, that was enough.

I used only one egg bc i like fudgy brownies and decreased the flour by 1/3 cup.  I added almost a cup of choc chips.  Next time I might try a chocolate glaze and a little more pb flavor.  Delicious!

So good!  I followed other reviewers' advice and used the Chocolate Frosting I recipe on the top of the brownies and they were excellent.  They are chewy, but still have a nice, thick almost-cakiness (I am sure that's not a word!) consistency to them, which I prefer in a brownie.  I definitely recommend these.

If you find that you want more peanut butter flavor, use peanut butter chips. Very good.

I think that these brownies are really good. I should have added some chocolate chips to the batter before I cooked them.  The next time I make these I will definitely add some.  Overall these are very easy and really good.

These were somewhat dissapointing. The concept is great, but the result wasn't as amazing as I had hoped for. I am going to try it again with some changes: more peanut butter, and instead of 2 eggs will use 1 whole and 1 yolk. These weren't peanut buttery and chewy enough for my taste. Also, I made mine with chocolate chunks and am convinced that without them, these would have been even blander.

Really good! Although I took someone's advice to add a touch of cinnamon and added too much. But they're still amazing with milk chocolate frosting to top them off!! Definetly a keeper!

Sorry these didn't float my boat.  I added chocolate chips and frosting.  I think without these, it would have been really awful.  I don't think I'll make these again.  Very dry! I just got a call from my son.  I made these for his poker game last night and he said they were "great".  All the guys loved them.  Based on that I'll change my rating to 4 stars.  I'm sure I'll be making them again.  Thanks

These are the BEST brownies that I have ever made! I made them exactly as written, adding 1 cup of chocolate chips. They were just perfect, moist and gooey in the centre! I think that those who are getting a more cake like brownie are simply baking them for too long. I always start checking them quite a bit earlier then the suggested time just because every oven is different. And, the best way to tell if they are done is to stick a toothpick or knife in the centre and there should be fudgy crumbs stuck to it. You don't want it to come out clean because then you have over cooked it! Try this recipe it is the best!

OK- but I would not call this a 'brownie recipe' It has a cake texture. My husband told me not to make again-and he LOVES peanut butter. As a cake, it tastes fine- you would need to add something-icing, choc chips, etc

My family really liked these!  I took the advice of another reviewer and did not beat the eggs, but mixed everything with a fork/spoon.  I added semi-sweet chocolate chips which I think works well with the peanut butter flavor more than milk chocolate chips do.  My personal opinion only.  The brownies were chewy on the edges, but the center was moist/gooey.  I think next time I will bake them just a little longer.  I wrapped the brownies in plastic wrap and refrigerated because I like them cold and every single one was eaten.  Great recipe and thanks for posting!

This was an awesome, easy recipe.  I took the adive of others and frosted the top with chocolate frosting.  the only problem I had was that the pan i used was 9 x 13, so i didn't ahve enough batter to fill the whole pan. Next time i think I will double it. Thanks!

I used a bigger pan to cook them in and cooked them for about 35 mins.  I added chocolate and peanut butter chips both inside and on top of the brownies.  Not too many though.  The peanut butter chips on top browned a little more than I would have liked by the time the brownies were cooked but they weren't too bad.  I wasn't crazy about the brownies myself but everyone who ate them raved about them and the kids loved them.  I was afraid I had over cooked them a little and ruined them but after they had cooled and I cut them they were perfectly cooked and chewy.  I will make them again.

I added 2/3 c. of dark chocolate chips and baked the brownies for 40 min. at 325. They turned out moist and full of flavor. I've found when baking peanut butter cakes/cookes or making peanut butter candy, a strong flavored peanut butter works best.  I like Jif as the peanut taste is stronger and the cooked/baked products have more of a peanuty taste when completed.

I made these brownies because my husband is crazy about peanut butter.  I am not as crazy about peanut butter, but we both really enjoyed the brownies and prefer to regular, chocolate brownies out of the box.  We aren't fans of icing, so instead of adding chocolate frosting as some users suggested, I topped off my mixture with peanut butter and milk chocolate chips - this turned out well so I will definitely add again. Overall, very rich and yummy.

spectacular recipe! will definitely make it again...I took it to a gathering and they disappeared. everyone loved them.  I did add about a cup of chocolate chunks, because i am a lover of chocolate with peanut butter.  my roomates like them too.  I had no 9x9 pan, so i used an 8x8 and cooked them for longer, and they still came out gooey...but we liked them this way :]

Brownies have never been a successful area for me, but this recipe changed that.  I followed everything as written, but added chocolate chips.  Let's face it: peanut butter and chocolate were made for each other.  These brownies were absolutely delicious and a HUGE hit at my house; they did not last long at all!  Thanks for sharing - it's a keeper!

Wasn't impressed with the flavor.  I wish I had read TMillers review before I made them.  I usually like to give the recipe a fair shot.  Not very peanut buttery recipe. More sweet then anything else.  Very cake like...brownies are supposed to be fudgy and full of the flavor they claim to be (i.e. chocolaty) So over all blah...maybe I will add peanut butter chips to it.  But I do love the concept. Followed the instructions for the time...it turned out perfect...some people might want to invest in an oven thermometer might be why your brownies didn't turn out.

These were great.  I made them for a bake sale, but I ate two before I took them to the sale!  They definitely tasted like peanut butter cake.  I added chocolate chips to the batter, and covered them with more melted chocolate chips (needed to finish the bag).  I think next time I will experiment with adding choc chips and covering with peanut butter frosting.  YUM!

These were good.  Next time I think I'll add chocolate chips and maybe use chunky peanut butter to give it some texture.  Very good!

I baked these in a 8X8 for 30 mins (my oven cooks a little fast) and added white chocolate chips... very, very naughty.  ;  )

Thanks for the recipe!

Found these to be very good. The only thing I did different was add 1 stick of butter instead of margarine,a little more peanut butter and 2 pks of instant oatmeal cereal. Put them in a 9 by 11 pan and baked for 25 min. They firm up as they cool down.

This recipe was disappointing. I followed it exactly and by the time it was cooked through in the center, the edges were burnt. It tasted mediocre. More cakey than chewy.

I live in Africa, so getting all the ingrediants together can be challenging. This was very easy, gooey, and yummy. My only advice is don't listen to the other reviewers that say cook for longer than 25 mins. They will dry out.

Taking tmiller676's ideas - I doubled the batch, too - less one egg, a bit less flour.  I also shorted the white sugar just a touch.  Then, added in half a bag of Mini-Choco Chips.  Checked at 30 min's, and these weren't even CLOSE to being done!  Come 45 minutes, the edges were gettin' pretty dark and I pulled them.  Still ooey gooey in the center, but that's fine with me - if there's no gooey'ness to my brownies, I won't like 'em.  I will tell ya, these are much better after being refrigerated on the overnight.  Paired very well with my morning coffee... A lil' too well.

I LOVE this recipe.  Its like a chewy peanutbutter cookie.

Instaed of the icing, I take the warm pan out of the oven & put chocolate chips ontop, and put in the oven for 2-3 mintues.  The chips then can be spread ontop to create a thin crispy chocolate top when they cool.

very good brownie! i thought i would try my hand at this since i happened to have some peanut butter. I added about 3/4c of peanut butter and omitted the salt and I mixed it all by hand with a wooden spoon. i didnt want to chance it and use a hand mixer and overwork it and they came out great! the outer crust was great and the inside was nice and chewy. i followd the suggestion of another and sprinkled some milk choc. chips after i took it from the oven and let that melt and spread it on top..very good with a tall cold glass of milk.. this is a keeper..thanks :D

I had to rate this a 2-star due to a few things. The brownies came out flat and thin. I followed the recipe exactly, although I did add 3/4 cup peanut butter to give it more flavor. Had I not done that, this would have been awful. The next day they were rock hard and inedible. I did put a very thick layer of chocolate frosting on these, which is the only thing that redeemed them.

Sorry, I didn't really like these.  I don't know if it was something I did or what, but they were dry and gritty.  I did top them with a chocolate frosting. That was good, but I ended up throwing them away.

I doubled the recipe since I didnt have a 9x9 pan; however, I did NOT double the salt (peanut butter has plenty of salt in it anyway) and they turned out great. I also used a light layer of chocolate frosting on the top just because I was craving chocolate too. My fiance - who is not a big fan of sweets or chocolate - loved these! Perfect for non-chocolate lovers. :D

Great bars.  I melted bittersweet chocolate chips on top at the end.  The bars are sweet so I prefer the choc chips to frosting.

Mmm.  Like a thick, chewy peanut butter cookie.  Very good warm and with a big glass of milk.  They are also good with chocolate frosting.  I used reduced fat creamy peanut butter and light margarine, and the texture was still perfect.  Unlike others, I thought the PB flavor was very rich and noticeable.  I will definitely make these again when the peanut butter craving hits.

These were a yummy change from traditional chocolate brownies and I like that it didn't make a huge batch. I used 3/4 cup peanut butter and only baked about 25 minutes because it appeared nicely brown and the toothpick test came out clean. I iced them with the chocolate frosting I recipe (per another reviewers advice) which was a perfect quantity and paired nicely with the peanut butter flavor. Upon cutting into them however I realized they could have used another 10 minutes baking time as they were pretty gooey. Luckily my husband loves them that way.

These are very tasty!  They are flavorful, moist, and extrmely easy to make.  I am a huge peanut butter fan, and I absolutely love these.  Next time, I'm going to try adding peanut butter chips or chocolate chips.  I HIGHLY recommend these to any peanut butter lover!

These were good, although I was expecting a little more peanut butter flavor.  Also, they were well done in 28 minutes.  I should have taken them out a little sooner.  Overall, a good recipe.

Great recipe! I topped mine with melted Hershey bars, as suggested by another member, and they were excellent! Will definitely make again!

These brownies were easy and qiuck and they taste great. They were gone in 1 day. My husband says they are the best he's ever had. Even my 3 year old who practically lives off of pasta and chicken nuggets asked for more! I will use this recipe from now on. Thanks!

I used crunchy peanut butter because that’s what I had, these were DELICIOUS! Soft and chewy! Also I sprinkled about 1/4 bag chocolate chips on the top when I took them out of the oven, let them melt and gently spread the chocolate over the top of the bars. Great recipe, thanks!!

Sometimes when I make these they turn out perfectly and are delicious. Fluffy and soft on the inside with that peanut butter flavor I love and slightly crispy on the outside. Sometimes, however, for some reason they just don't bake through and I'm forced to over-bake them in order to get the inside fully cooked. Not sure why this happens sometimes. It could be my mistake, but for the most part, I love this recipe.

I made this with 1 C of peanut butter and it turned out well. It's not chewy in the slightest, it's quite light/airy/cakey for a brownie recipe. Still tastes good. Good way to use up peanut butter. 

--- EDIT --- It is now the day after I made this recipe, and it has now become chewy with a dense brownie-like texture. I take back what I said in my original review. So my tip is: WAIT 24 hours to eat this because it magically changes and becomes better overnight.

Amazing recipe. My kids inhaled these and begged me to make a second tray. Would give this 10 stars. Only change I made was using 1/2 creamy and 1/2 chunky peanut butter in an 8x8 pan. So thick and chewy like a brownie but they tasted like super soft peanut butter cookies. Delicious!

Used to eat these in elementary school for breakfast (before schools paid attention to peanut allergies).  The school chef (she was chef worthy) would always put cream cheese frosting on them, basically my favorite time of the day was eating these peanut butter bars before school started!  Thank you for sharing, I have made several times already and my kids love them too!

I definitely did something wrong. Everything was all mixed but the batter was more like cookie dough, I added an extra egg and some honey, but it didn't do much. I couldn't even pour it, it was so thick. It's in the oven now, I'm hoping the heat will spread it out. It was just a big blob in the middle of the pan. Anyone know why?? I was so excited for this!!

I loved these brownies! I made it in an 8 x 8 pan because that is what I have. I added some chocolate chips. Delicious. I will be making these again!

Delicious! I did double the recipe & took the advice of a reviewer when doubling the recipe to use one less egg, 1/3 cup less flour & a dollop more of peanut butter. After stirring everything together, I used an electric handheld mixer for about 20 seconds to make sure the ingredients were well incorporated. The batter was creamy & spread easily into the 9x13 glass dish. I baked for 30 minutes & the center was still very jiggly. I laid aluminum foil over dish to prevent over- browning & had to bake for 10-15 more minutes (just keep checking for a non- jiggly center- then they're done) I waited 15 minutes for them to cool some & then frosted with a simple chocolate frosting: 1/2 stick melted butter, 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 cup sifted confectioners sugar, 1/8- 1/4 cup milk, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract (mix with electric hand mixer until smooth). 
They were chewy and absolutely delicious. Huge hit with my dinner party!

PB  brownies are usually dry and tasteless, but  these were not! Very chewy and moist. I will make them again. Cover halfway through with foil so the edges don't get too brown.

A new family favorite and a real keeper. The second time I used Crisco butter fLavor bar in place of margarine and 2 tsp of baking soda. I also added Reese’s Pieces. When baking, I covered 1 “ in from edge with foil (not touching batter) and they came out light and chewy. Scrumptious!

These are definitely chewy and an excellent brownie base. I added chocolate chips to the top. They could use a lot more peanut butter flavor, it’s very mild.  Maybe adding Reese’s pieces would give it the extra peanut butter kick it needs!

I followed the recipe ingredients as listed but I chose not to beat the eggs as some of the reviewers recommended. The texture as well as the flavor came out great. I baked mine in a 9x9 square nonstick pan and it was the perfect thickness. I will definitely make this recipe again since not only is it delicious but super easy to make. Next time, I will decorate it with some melted chocolate drizzled on top to make it look and taste even better!

Reminds me of a peanut butter brownie I had while in high school, so moist.

I cook at 6000' feet, first batch was thick and cooked to 35 minutes.   Nice out of oven, but then turned hard.   Second batch, used 3 eggs and cooked 30 minutes.   So far, so good.

These are simply wonderful!  I doubles the recipe and baked it in a 9x13 pan.  I iced them with a cooked icing.  1/2 cup butter, 1/4 cup peanut butter, 1/3 plus 1 Tbsp milk, 1# powered sugar, 1 tsp vanilla. Heat butter, peanut butter and milk in a pan till it boils.  Remove from heat and beat in powdered sugar and  vanilla and pour over warm brownies. Yummy! Yummy!

I'm here to review the recipe shown online, and ONLY that recipe, lol...
I tried as is printed...yes the edges got darker/hard so I cut those off. I checked it at 25 minutes but the middle was gooey so I left another 5 minutes and that took care of it.
The taste...the outer edges reminded me of a PB cookie, the inside tasted like a fudgy brownie, tasting of peanut butter.
Still, since I love PB, I sprinkled PB chips on top as soon as it came out of the oven and spread like a frosting.
No complaints from me! :))))

I added 1/3 cup more peanut butter just because I wanted extra peanut flavor. I used butter instead of margarine, and self rising flour in place of all purpose and baking powder. Really good!!

Oh so perfect!  I beat my butter & sugar really well, then beat the eggs, sugar & vanilla till fully fluffy before folding in dry ingredients & these came out very moist & delicious for me.  Perhaps because my oven runs hot, I lowered temp to 325 & cooked 33 min. (watching/testing from 25 min. on).  I did throw in a generous handful of mini chocolate chips & some finely chopped peanuts I had left over from another recipe (small handful) & they are simply heavenly.

I made this with the following changes:  Dbl. recipe; 1 egg + 1 egg yolk, used truvia sugar and brown sugar, 1 1/3 c. peanut butter, 6 T. butter, 2/3 c. flour.  They turned out really good.

I also made another batch: dbl. recipe; 1 egg + 2 egg yolks, stevia equivalent to sugar amts., 1/2 t. xanthum gum, 1 1/3 c. peanut butter, 6 T. butter, 1 1/3 c. almond flour.  They also turned out really good.

You have to make sure you DO NOT OVER BAKE them, stay with the 20 min. if you do a 9x13 pan and DO NOT use a mixer, use a spoon to mix so they are more like brownies.

WOW! These were amazing. I followed the ideas from some of the reviews and did not blend all of the wet ingredients until fluffy to preserve a brownie-like texture-so it turned out as a delicious peanut butter cake/brownie dessert!

It was good right out of the oven but not chewy but rather dry especially a day after.

This was so good, my family said it was the best thing I've ever made. I doubled the recipe and used butter instead of margarine, used a mixer until it was time to add eggs, then used a fork, and added reese's peanut butter chips to the batter. Baked in a 9x13ish pan and used the tip someone mentioned to not overcook the edges-- I covered in foil, cut the center out of the foil-- baked half way, about 20-25 min, then removed foil and baked until clean toothpick tested.  It needed to bake longer than suggested due to doubling for sure. Great recipe for someone who doesn't like chocolate! (my husband)

This recipe has potential for sure. I did what most people suggested and doubled the recipe, plus adding one less egg and less flour. I also added 1/4 more margarine(on accident) and put some dark chocolate chips on the batter before baking. The extra margarine actually really made it good.

The only thing that keeps this recipe from being 5 stars as written, is the baking time.  After the full baking time, they were soft and gummy in the middle, and my oven bakes too hot!  I made these as written except for the addition of some chocolate chunks in the batter, probably 1/2 c. in total.  And while the chocolate added another dimension of flavor, I'm positive it was not the reason for the under cooked results.  That being said, this is an easy correction to achieve 5 star brownies.  I will make them again and add more time in the oven.  Update:  Made these again today.  This time I sprinkles the chocolate chunks on top of the batter before baking.  They were still under baked at 30 min.  In fact I had to add another full 10 min. before they were done!   The flavor is alright, sort of a mild peanut butter, but these just don't have the "wow" factor.  I might make them again, but they just aren't something I would crave.

Delicious, tastes like a really chewy peanut butter cookie. I've made this recipe hundreds of times, it is a huge hit with my family. The first  time I made it was for Thanksgiving and now my family asks for it every time we have a potluck.

Nice recipe, but a bit too sweet for me (and Im a brazilian, we live on sweetened condensed milk and dulce de leche). Will definetely make it again but try to cut the white sugar by half. Also, as I usually do on cake/brownies recipes, I used only half cup of flour and replaced the other half for oats, works pretty well (and might be the reason why it ended up so sweet :P )!

I love these. I used only 1 egg and instead of 1 cup of flour, I did 2/3 cup of flour and 1/3 cup of cocoa powder, as someone had previously suggested. Will definitely make them again.

These were great. The texture is a nice fudge brownie texture. 

I did follow the suggestion to mix everything by hand and only as much as needed to incorporate, I only added 1/3 tsp of baking powder, a heaping 1/2 C of peanutbutter. Baked only for 26 mins per another suggestion.

In my opinion this was not the consistency of brownies. It may well have been BREAD. The PB flavor did not “pop”, it was too muted by the sugar. I definitely think it should be a creamier chewiness; maybe more PB, less sugar and flour.

I followed what some  of the others said about not beating the eggs and also did not use my mixer at all.
They were delicious and next time I will double the recipe.

Wonderful! I used butter instead of margarine and reduced the amount to 1/4 cup and then increased peanut butter to 2/3 cup. I didn’t have any brown sugar on hand, so I used 1 cup of white sugar and 2 tbsp molasses. After I put the batter together, I threw in a generous handful of peanut butter chips and another of 70% cacao chips. I lined a 9 x 9 pan with parchment and baked in a convection oven at 325 F for 35 min. You’ll need to spread the batter out, but you’ll love the finished texture if you beat it by hand. Slices up neatly for a beautiful presentation.

My son cooked these today.  They turned out really well.  I'm going to follow the suggestion and ice them with chocolate icing tomorrow; however, they are quite delicious plain.  (I'll cut them after icing so nobody knows we snitched a sample!)

I followed the recipe exactly accept I add some cashew nut butter to it, along with the peanut butter. It turned out perfect. Delicious, chewy and so good that I made it again within two days. I love peanut butter cookies and this fits the bill. Luv this recipe, quick and easy to make. I have an old enamel oven which bakes quickly so the second time I took them out within twenty minutes. YUM!

Oh my goodness, these brownies are amazing!  After reading a few comments I opted to use only a large bowl and a wooden spoon to mix it all up, just like the late great brownie recipes of yesterday.  Chewy, flavorful, happy comfort food.

These were not tasty. I should have known after reading so many good reviews with alterations. Please, can rate the actual recipes, without modifications? 
Sure, I could bake these again with my own modifications for an improved product, but I was looking for a recipe that was good as is.

These are so good! I used butter instead of margarine, and added chocolate chips to the batter and the top before baking. They are so moist and chewy with just the right amount of peanut butter flavor.

Super big hit at work! I will be making this again and again! As suggested I only used three eggs when I doubled the recipe. I baked it at 325 deg for 35 min, also as suggested. Absolutely nothing negative to say here! Thanks for the great recipe!

I just made these brownies.  They are the bomb.  I followed the recipes ingredients, but mixed them differently.  I creamed the peanut butter and butter until creamy.  Then added the sugars and continued to cream another 3 to 4 minutes.  Then added the eggs and vanilla extract.  Once all mixed, I removed from the mixer and stirred in the flour, baking powder and salt.  Once it was combined, I added a cup of chocolate chips.  I used a 9 x 9 bake pan and baked for 30 minutes.  I let them cool in the pan for 10 minutes.  Then cut and cool on a wire rack.  My husband  and boys loved them.  They thought they tasted just like my peanut butter Christmas cookies..  Now they can have the taste all year long without waiting for Christmas.  Awesome recipe.  I don't feel they were like a cake.  They were dense like a brownie.  Perfect.

I didn't whisk together I took one users suggestion and mixed together with a fork to make sure they stayed chewy - I don't even like peanut butter but I liked these. Definitely don't over bake. The first time I slightly undertakes them on accident but I like stuff like that sometimes just somewhat doughy. Second time I added chocolate chips and let's be honest you can't go wrong with that. Easy to make, delicious. Five stars : )

Family loved these brownies! I doubled the recipe but, as one reviewer had suggested, cut it down by one egg. Used homemade peanut butter (believe it or not, PB is hard to find in France!) and covered the top before baking. Covered with tin foil for the first 20 minutes at 160C degrees (325F). Ended up cooking at that temp for another 15 minutes and then raised it to 175 - but they weren't finished for yet another 15 minutes, so about 50 minutes cooking time in total. The bars cut beautifully (after cooling completely) and were moist and chewy. I know I'll be asked to make these again!

Made these for a picnic and they were a big hit!  I picked suggestions from other reviewers that made sense to me:
Doubled the recipe except used 3 eggs instead of 4
Used 1/2 cup butter instead of doubled margarine.
Added 1/4 cup extra peanut butter (I use natural PB).
Reduced white sugar to 1 cup
Added 3/4 cup milk chocolate chips to batter.  Great chocolate taste without messy frosting on a hot day!
Spread dough in a 13 x 9 x 1 pan and baked at 335 degrees for 35 minutes, adding a 1" frame of aluminum foil to protect the outer edges from over baking halfway thru bake time.
I will be making these again.

I didn't have any brown sugar, so I made the recipe with golden syrup in its place. It is fantastic and I will be making it  again.

Loved these  and only made one change. Instead of using white sugar, I used a cup of packed dark brown sugar, because we like the extra bit of flavor the dark brown sugar adds to these.

Used a rubber spatula for all my mixing and got the perfect blondie/brownie consistency! It was a little sweet for my tastes (though not too sweet to stop me from having three pieces in one night), so I might cut the sugar next time I make it.

I made these brownies exactly as written for a mid-winter family get-together. I did not change a single thing except to double the recipe and bake in a 9x13 dish (they of course took a bit longer to bake so I just watched them). We LOVED them! For us, they are the perfect blend of peanut butter flavor, chewy texture and just the right sweetness. This recipe is a keeper and am sure will be making it many times in the future!

I love peanut butter, so I made these. The only thing I did different was add butter instead of margarine. I will add more peanut butter next time, or chips. They were lacking something.

This was just ok.  It did not have enough flavor for us.  Maybe it needed the addition of chocolate that the other reviewers added.  Don't plan on making again.

Simple and delicious.

I added 1/2 cup dry roasted peanuts ground in food processor to about the consistency of fine bread crumbs.  Add this to the batter before adding the flour.  This little trick I learned when making peanut butter cookies and really boost the peanut butter flavor.


I substituted butter for the margarine - I don't do margarine.  

Also added 1/2 cup chocolate chips and made a chocolate ganache frosting that really goes well with the peanut butter.

Recommend not baking more that 30 minutes, and probably 25 is better for chewier texture.  

Although there may be "better"recipes out there for this type of brownie, I like it because it was very simple -- easy for kids to make, and very tasty.

These were okay.  My family enjoyed them, but they didn't love them.  I just followed the recipe, if I'd make them again I would put chocolate icing, add cocoa, or chocolate chips.  But I have other chocolate-pb recipes that I like.

Used remaining brownie batter from brownie batter cupcakes and mixed it in just barely to marble.  Added 1/2 cup of pb cups and 1/2 cup of pb chips. Frosted w chocolate frosting and sprinkled pb cups on top.  Square pan.  Really good.

Mixed with whole giradelli, 1/2 c cups and chips, 9x13 Pan 350 for 40 min.   No frosting or cups on top, made sundaes.

The reason some people are saying that the brownies are turning out cake-like is because the recipe calls for margarine. I made mine with margarine first, didn't like it, did some research, and when I made them a second time I substituted margarine with butter and they turned out DELICIOUS!!!!

I've loved peanut butter brownies for forever now but had been making them differently.

I stumbled across this and followed it to the T and they are AMAZING! Thanks for the recipe.

Followed the recipe exactly except I used butter in place of margarine. I would have liked a stronger peanut butter flavor. Perhaps adding chopped peanuts or using crunchy peanut butter would have helped. The brownies were done in 25 minutes.

This is an easy recipe to make. I made a double-batch and put it into a 9x13 casserole dish because I don't have a 9x9 pan. It had to cook for 35 minutes and then came out of the oven looking beautiful; however, after several minutes of cooling, the top caved in pretty significantly. So, it doesn't look as pretty anymore, but they taste wonderful. It's the texture of a brownie with the flavor of a peanut butter cookie. Definitely a keeper!

Yum, yum, yum! The only ingredient I substituted was the margarine with butter. I think the next time I make it (and yes, there will be a next time!), I will add some sort of frosting or glaze, but it really doesn't need it.

Yum, yum, yum. To make these chewier I melted the  butter and stirred in the peanut butter. Then I stirred all the other ingredients in with a spoon. The batter looked a bit strange to me, like shinny sticky claydough. but I thought why not keep going. I spread it in the brownie pan and baked as directed. The result was yummy chewy peanut butter blondies...so good I ate 4 while they were warm.

I had some milk chocolate chips  and peanut butter to use up, so I chose this recipe to make. I wanted them to be more like brownies, not cake, so I doubled this recipe and only used 3 eggs, and used real butter, not margarine, then added about 2 cups of milk chocolate chips. I used a 13 X 9 inch pan and watched carefully, my oven cooked them in about 35 minutes (it runs cool,) they are chewy and delicious! Many thanks!

So my stepdaughter told me that her grandma on her biological mother's side made a peanut butter dessert that she absolutely loved, and that her grandma gave her the recipe and specifically said "Don't share this with your stepmom"...Challenge accepted...only, I found this recipe and made it, and all my stepchildren, and my 2 year old loved it! I guess it wasn't really a challenge because these were awesome! I will be making these again and again, and if I ever see bio grandma again, my smile will be extra wide.

I followed the recipe exactly, adding about six small squares of chopped dark chocolate. The chocolate breaks up the sweetness of the peanut butter and makes the brownies utterly decadent. I mixed everything by hand so I would get a brownie vs. cake consistency.

These were wonderful! Only changes I made was to use butter instead of margarine, and I used crunchy peanut butter - turned out great. Loved the texture and they were nice and thick since I baked them in an 8x8 glass baking dish. They took about 30 minutes to cook. I tented the edges with foil at about the 20min mark and was glad I did. Didn't have chocolate so I made a Nutella sauce by adding a little 1/2+1/2 and microwaving it for a few seconds. I then drizzled that on top. Can't wait to make them again soon!

I had a little trouble with this recipe.  The first time I made it, I doubled the recipe.  I had read not to overcook the brownies, but when I took them out, the sides were crisping but the center was still nearly liquid. Not sure if I made a mistake or not.  But after cooking them longer, they were a hit, even with the crunchy edges. I just remade them in a 9x9 brownie pan (with the divider insert), and they turned out much better, though the center piece was still a bit gooey (that isn't necessarily a bad thing!).  I melted chocolate on the top the first time, this time I did no toppings.  But I'm thinking of using a peanut butter frosting or glaze.  Or putting in chocolate chips next time.  Or even peanut butter chips.  So since I have lots of adaptations in the works, I figured this was a 5 star recipe, cause I plan on making it several more times!

Meh. The texture was a little weird to me, I can't really call it a brownie, or a cake, or a cookie. Wasn't an awful texture, just one I've never had before. The taste was just ok, these have a lot of sugar in them, but did not taste sweet. I used a no-stir natural crunchy peanut butter, that could be the reason maybe. I just wanted something different for dessert, and I've wanted to try this recipe and the Blonde Brownies I recipe from this site for a while. This one won since I had no chocolate chips on hand. While I thought these brownies were just so-so, a chocolate frosting helped. I used canned frosting spread over the warm brownies to melt like a glaze. I bet they would be good warm with ice cram and hot fudge(and banana, PB and banana...so good together!). They really do need some chocolate, but I might as well just make regular brownies with PB in them. I'll make these again, with some experimenting(nutella instead of PB or using less white sugar but upping brown sugar or maybe some mashed banana, or add chocolate chips or etc, etc, etc.... I always have these ingredients on hand, and they're easy to make, so definitely worth a do-over. Thank you for the recipe and for getting my creative cooking juices flowing! :) EDIT: I wasn't too happy with them yesterday, but, these taste way better the second day! I've upped this to 4 stars. :)

The texture is too cake like to really qualify as a proper brownie. I expect a brownie to be more chewy. The peanut butter flavor was also lacking. I would not make this two times.

Absolutely delicious.  I replaced the flour with Bob's Red Mill Gluten-free All Purpose Flour (and added the required amount of xanthan gum) and they were exactly like the original!!  I can't wait to bake them again, thank you.

Out of this world! Everyone LOVES these brownies! I usually double the recipe and bake in a 13x9 pan. I also always add much more peanut butter and peanut butter chips and milk chocolate chips to the batter. Delicious!

I was looking for something different and easy to bring to work.  This was a HUGE hit. I tripled the recipe to make in 2 8X11 pans. I realized I was out of sugar and substituted powdered sugar and molasses for the brown sugar. It was incredibly delicious.  This recipe is a keeper.  I did drizzle with chocolate.  It made the brownies prettier, but the flavor could easily stand alone.

Awesome recipe!I used chunky peanut butter, which was great! I made 24 servings instead of 16. I used a 9x13 sprayed glass dish. I left it in for 45 minutes @ 350*
Wonderful! Thanks!

Great recipe. Next time I think I all drizzle some chocolate over the top for some added delicious calories. LOL. I baked it for 25 min. when the top turned golden brown just because I like more gooey brownies and they were delicious! I think baked any longer (depending on your oven) they might be dry. All in all great recipe!

Made using "WOWButter" and threw in about 1/2 c of Carob chips and these were very yummy! Will definitely make them again! Made with WOWbutter so they could be taken to school and with carob as my son goes nuts on Chocolate. Even my picky husband tried them and then went back for a couple more pieces! =)

My family and I absolutely loveee this recipe! We really enjoyed the cake-like texture of it. I had it in the oven for 35 minutes, and the brownies had a nice soft center that was amazing! I made them for my family three days ago, they were gone within 24 hours, and now they're having me make it for them again! Definitely a keeper, thanks so much!

Delicious! If your expecting a chewy, brownie like taste/texture, your in for a disappointment. However, these peanut butter squares are delicious and totally worth trying. I iced mine with a peanut butter chocolate hazelnut icing. Yum!!

Have made these several times and everyone loves them. Usually double recipe and take it camping, very portable. No frosting needed but I usually do add some chocolate chips. Just had a craving for these and got my recipe out (again ) so decided too finally write a review this time.Thanks for sharing a tasty recipe !

I have made this 4 times and have followed tmiller676 advice and doubled it, plus I use real butter, and just like food whiz suggests I fold the ingredients with a fork, bake at 350 for 35 mins is the perfect setting every time. I bake mine in a ceramic 12x9" pan. When I am done mixing it it needs to be spread around with a spatula as it has a very thick consistencies. The last time I made it I added semi sweet chips, it did stay in 40 mins. accidentally but was still awesome. My kids love it, I think it taste best when it s still warm. Last I wanted to give my review 5 stars but the system won't let me, it kept rejecting my review it only took with a 4 star!

call it 3.5 - these were too sweet for me, but best friend loved them.  I'll try this again, lessen the white sugar, maybe add an egg, and definitely a little more peanut butter.  I wanted it a little less "gooey" and a little more cakey brownie.  but great starter!

So good and simple! I added 3/4 Cup of semi sweet chocolate chips. Cooked for 34 minutes and they came out perfect! Everyone commented on how moist and delicious they were! And they smell amazing coming out of the oven, couldn't resist the first bar.

Loved these...I did double the recipe and I didn't have vanilla (not a baker) so I used almond instead. Those are the only changes I made. But the almond gave them a Maple Goodies candy taste!

These came out great! I added a cup of chocolate chips and they were the perfect peanut butter blondie!  I lined my 7" x 11" pan with foil so when they were cooled I could lift them out and cut easier.  Delicious! Thanks, Jo!

ok, i baked these brownies i used a 8x8 pan since that's what i have, the batter is pretty thick, i did add some mini m&m's to it which made it colorful. It baked 30 mins the edges were dark, i did check at 25 mins but the middle was way to raw. I let them cool in a pan then i cut them and wrapped them up. I was worried about the middle was gooey and the edges were hard. but after a few hours everything set up well the edges softened and the middle firmed. I used and off brand pb that i needed to use up. I tasted the pb flavor but my bf didn't but he really loved the flavor anyway.

I made a single batch and cooked mine in a 9x9 at 325 since there were comments about the center being difficult.  Mine cooked fine, took 30-32 mins.  I added cocoa to the flour mixture, but have decided it was too much (not reflected in my rating since it was my own alteration).  Next time, I will either put in less cocoa or only add it to half and swirl with some plain.  Also, I swapped the sugars and decreased the flour by a few Tbls for a more chewy result.  The texture came out great.  Overall, pretty good.

The taste of these brownies was good, but nothing special, this coming from a peanut butter lover. I also had a hard time with cooking these-- the middle just wouldn't cook through, while the sides got hard and even a little burnt. It didn't really cook evenly and didn't taste exceptional. I wouldn't make these again.

Very yummy! I added 1/4 cup more peanut butter, and next time think I'll add a little more. Very good recipe, I just really love peanut butter. I added a thin layer of brownie icing. Amazing, thank you!

Hands down best peanut butter brownie I've ever had. I might even choose it over chocolate brownies given the chance.
I didn't have brown sugar, instead I used 1/2 cup plain sugar mixed with 1/2 tablespoon molasses and the results were great. The brown sugar/ molasses flavor is a great compliment to the peanut butter.

The whole family loved these!  These were easy to assemble.  I beat the eggs with a fork in a separate bowl and then added the beaten eggs and mixed.  Will definitely make again!

These were nice. The baking time took me a bit longer than it said but it could just be my oven. I would make them again but with chocolate chips in it next time or frosted with chocolate as suggested. Overall pretty good and simple with ingredients I always have on hand so it's great to whip up anytime you have a pb craving.

Followed recipe to the T with the one exception of accidently melting the margarine in the microwave instead of just softening.  I also added chocolate chips in the batter and I absolutely loved them!  I am a big fan of chocolate/PB combos anyway.  Would definitely make again.

I won't make these again. They really don't have a peanut butter taste if that is what you're looking for. A good base brownie recipe as they came out moist and fudgy.

These were completely amazing! I only put one egg in, like someone else said, to make it more chewy rather than cakey. And I put frosting on it. It tastes a lot like a peanut butter cookie, but it won't disappoint!

Did everything according to recipe, except just before baking I drizzled about three tablespoons of Nutella over the top, then swirled it in with a knife.  Baked for 35 minutes, covering in tin foil for the last 5.  Delicious!  Perfect texture: not too cakey, not too gooey!  Will make again.

I'm giving these three stars because even though I didn't like them, my mother thought they were tasty. I followed the recipe almost exactly as written (the only difference was I mixed in the eggs by hand) and I also had a problem with the consistency being far too cake-like. They weren't dense and chewy like brownies. Not that there's anything wrong with cake-like, per se, but...I'm not baking a cake. Also, the flavor was lacking. Not very peanut butter-y, so if I make these again, I would certainly increase the peanut butter. Honestly, I think I'd bump the white sugar up a bit too. This recipe is not a bad starting point, but just not *quite* there yet.

These were good, but definitely need a little something extra like other reviewers said. I didn't have any chocolate on hand, so I just made this recipe as is with a few modifications from other reviewers. It needs more peanut butter than what the recipe calls for. Without any chocolate these just taste like peanut butter cookies. Next time I will add chocolate.

I tried this recipe as is, just doubled it and added a bag of milk chocolate chips. These were really good! When doubling just add between 10-20 minutes to the bake time listed, check so they do not get overdone.

This is one of the first recipes from allrecipes that I made to the T without adjusting anything and it turned out pretty good. Next time I make these, there will be a next time for sure, I will use crunchy peanut butter for more texture, will use more peanut butter and less butter/margarine per another reader's suggestions, and add chocolate chips.

The batter of these brownies was TO DIE FOR however, once baked, they seemed to lose a bit a flavor. To make up for that lost flavor I iced with chocolate buttercream icing and then drizzled melted peanut butter (mixed with crisco so that it would harden into a glaze) over top. Looked great and everyone loved them, however, I still wish that the amazing taste of the raw batter had come through in the cooked brownies. Overall I will still make them again but perhaps attempt to make them more peanut-buttery!

Awesome! Tastes like the Reeses' Peanut Butter Bars but better! Followed the recipe exactly, except baked for only 25 minutes. Topped with the chocolate recipe on the back of the cocoa container as recommended by the other reviewer - wow! So good, I've already made a 2nd batch for my husband and brother-in-law and have been asked to make more for Father's Day.

This is a pretty good recipe.  Be careful not to over bake it.  It has a good peanutty flavor and goes well with vanilla ice cream for an extra rich dessert.

These were yummy.  I did mix everything with a fork.  I added some choc. chips too.  Without the chocolate, it wouldn't have been as good.  I think it would've been a bit plain.  YUM!

I agree that these taste more like a chewy cake than brownies, and it took me more than 25 to 30 minutes to get the batter cooked all the way through, but I still give this recipe five stars because it was absolutely delicious and easy to make. I made my own little twist on it by adding 1/2 cup reeses peanut butter chips, 1/2 cup milk chocolate chunks, and 1 cup of chopped pecans.

I was a little disappointed. I made these yesterday for a bbq. After having them in the over for 30 min at 350, the center was still raw and the edges were already starting to turn brown. So I turned the oven down to 320 and kept them in for 10 min. longer. After letting them cool, I cut into them. The edge pieces were dry and the middle was still somewhat uncooked. So I can only serve the perimeter pieces at the bbq. Not sure what Ill do with the not-quite-cooked center pieces. I probably want try these again...I think I would just make peanut butter cookies instead. Also, I added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips, which I would recommend if someone else tries these.

While these were pretty tasty, they weren't quite the texture i was looking for.  I added almost a whole cup of peanut butter, and the flavor was still pretty minute.  I also added about 2/3 c of chocolate chunks.  Overall these tasted more like a really dense cake than a brownie, and my picky husband liked them, but i think i'll keep looking for something with more of a heavy peanut butter flavor.

I am very disappointed, and was looking forward to making these for everyone to enjoy.. They are still delicious but did not come out the way i expected from the recipe shown above. =(

This is a really simple recipe. I added a half cup of chocolate chips to the recipe and topped it with chocolate chips. My only complaint was that the edges browned and hardened. But... overall, these were delicious brownies! :)

This is an evil, evil recipe! My boyfriend and I ate the whole thing in 36 hours -yikes!  I used butter instead of margarine and crunchy natural peanut butter. I followed another reviewers advice and did not mix the eggs until fluffy. I also added a handful of chocolate chips and a handful of peanut butter chips. The brownies (I'm calling them blondies) took a little longer in my oven, about 38 minutes total, and I had to cover them with foil after 30 minutes because they were browning too fast.  They tasted exactly like the huge peanut butter cookies you can buy at coffee shops, which was just what I was craving! We loved this recipe, thanks so much Jo!

These were delicious and soft!  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I added some peanut butter and milk chocolate chips to the top before baking (as suggested by another reviewer).  Oh, it was so good!  I was worried when making it because the batter was very thick and pasty, but it baked up perfectly.

These really did not turn out well for me, but it may have been due to my trying to incorporate too many suggestions in the reviews. I started by doubling the peanut butter due to the complaints that it was not PB-y enough. I used a whole stick of butter instead of margarine (to avoid trans-fats) and used a bit less than a cup of flour. Also used 1 egg and 1 egg yolk and mixed ingredients just with a fork. The texture is just terrible-- way too crumbly and not only is it not brownie-like it is not cake like either.

I made these because of the picture. Mine did not turn out like the photo at all. They were greasy and flat. At least they weren't dry like some reviewers suggested. I may try again, I think it may have been the addition of the chocolate so I will make them without next time and see if they improve.

These were just "ok".  Almost needs more Peanut Butter taste.  I added chocolate chips which were good and do think perhaps peanut butter chips would work well.  Probably won't make again since I didn't care for the cake-like way it came out.

Nice flavor.  Very peanut-buttery.  However, also a little cakier than I'd like.  I dumped come choc chips (dark chocolate) in and then made Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site for the top.  I think they're pretty good, my husband loves them and since he's the /real/ peanut butter fan, I'm adding a star over what I would normally have.

This were good I just think they needed a little something more.  I added some milk chocolate chips but next time I think I will add maybe 1/4 cup cocoa powder to get a taste similar to reeses peanut butter cups.  My boyfriend loved them!

Easy to make, but baking it was sort of difficult. I was so worried to over bake them. The top was starting to brown, but the inside was still under cooked..

I tried this recipe using one of the suggestions to bake them for 25mins to avoid dryness. They turned out looking fine on top but the bottom was definitely underdone. I can't stress enough that you use the FULL BAKING TIME if you want this recipe to be successful. After I tried this recipe a second time and followed the baking instructions they came out beautifully and ended up a big hit! I will make this again and again.

These brownies were very moist. I followed the directions exactly and I did add in chocolate chips. I'm only giving this 3 stars b/c the flavor really lacked something. Not that strong of a peanut butter taste. Not sure what to add to make this more flavorful? More peanut butter and maybe a dash more salt?

I thought these were really good, but could have used a bit more peanut butter. Next time I make them I will add a couple tablespoons, since I am a big peanut butter lover.  Like others I added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips, and I think it makes the recipe.   I will be making these again.

Not bad the first day (four stars), but they did not keep well.  Dried up quickly.

I have made this recipe twice in the last week, it is that good. All I changed was to add chocolate chips to it. Yummy! I didn't have any problems with dryness or over baking. Family and Friends love them.

If you throw in half a cup of chocolate chips, these will satisfy any chocolate and peanut butter cravings. Yum! I only used 1/4 cup of white sugar and they were sweet enough for me.

These were pretty tasty! I'm giving them three stars because it's a pretty picky recipe.  The first time I baked them, I took them out at 40 minutes but they still didn't seem totally done (tasted good though!).  I gave the recipe to a friend and hers came out dry at 35 minutes.  I think it does help if you add chocolate chips.  These definitely taste like brownies though, not cakey.  EDIT: I am increasing my rating to 5 stars!! THESE ARE AMAZING! Everyone requests them!! I chop up 4 chocolate baking bars and add right to the batter then bake like normal. Have made these with half white/half wheat flour and still tasted great!!

I multiplied these out to make a hotel pan.  They still turned out very well.  Very moist and not too strong of a peanut butter taste.  Made them at a camp in France this summer multiple times and every time they were a hit.

The first time I made these, I doubled the recipe(minus one egg, little extra pb) and marbled them with a boxed brownie mix, then put mini pb cups in them! sooo delicious. I took them to a get-together with some of my Amish neighbors and the pan came home scraped clean!!  The second time I made them, this afternoon, I simply went by the recipe and put them in a 9x9 and added about 1/2 c. of mini milk chocolate chips.  Simply wonderful :-)

My group and I made these brownies for our culinary arts class. The brownies turned out very nice and everyone enjoyed them. We drizzeled the brownies with bitter sweet chocolate to add a little flare. I would suggest maybe adding alittle more peanut butter for a bit more flavor, but overall they turned out pretty good and we were pleased with the results.

This is honestly one of the best recipes I've ever found on this site; they turned out wonderfully! I subbed butter for the margarine and added a handful of semi-sweet chocolate chips, and it was great. I made the mistake of leaving them alone with my husband, and now half the pan is gone! Ours took the entire 35 minutes to cook. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

These were really yummy. My only complaint is that when I took them out, they seemed unbaked! But after I left them cool off, they were chewy and delicious! I baked mine in an 8x8 and maybe that's why they didn't bake all the way through.

Very good. I accidentally baked mine in a 8x8 pan instead which required longer baking time.(hence the extra dark top) but it didnt taste over baked/burnt at all and in inside was perfect. Adding chocolate chips seems like a great idea. i will try that next time.

These were a big hit with my kids. I followed the recipe except I also added chocolate chips. I enjoyed the chewy outside while my kids loved the mushy middle. They made everyone happy! I will definitely be making them again - a double batch next time!

Yum! I followed the recipe almost exactly, just mixed in chocolate chips also. I don't know what some reviewers are talking about... These brownies were nice and chewy, not at all "cake-like." My boys are gobbling them up now! :)

I am not a person who thinks a brownie has to be chocolate in flavor or color to be considered a brownie, but I don't think this is one because of the texture. It simply isn't dense like a brownie. It is more like a bar or bar shaped cookie. I did add 1 cup of chocolate chips (though I made the recipe for 24 servings), an added touch I thought it definitley needed. I didn't do the frosting like so many others... personally I think that would have been too much. Bake time is a little off though... I should have listened to other reviewers; 25 minutes would have been plenty. It still looked gooey though which was deceitful since it hardened up after it cooled. Still good and chewy but the edges were a little dry and I think at 25 minutes it would have been soft and moist. Overall a good recipe that is simple and tasty.

These were really tasty, but more of a cake than a brownie. I substituted smart balance for the margarine (health reasons), and I added about 1/3 C chocolate chips to the batter.  It took way more than 30 minutes to bake (maybe because of the smart balance?). When it was done, I sprinkled some more chocolate chips on the top, put it back in the oven for 1 minute, and then spread the chocolate chips to make a chocolate glaze on top. The chocolate on top was great!

These brownies are good, except the peanut butter flavor isn't very pronounced.  Had I not added chocolate chips, this would've tasted like a bland bar cookie.  If I were to make this again, I would add much more peanut butter (and decrease the shortening accordingly).  25 minutes in the oven was perfect for me.

The taste was pretty good, but unfortunately, they didn't bake well for me.  The edges were very brown and crispy after the alloted cooking time, however, the middle was not baked through.  Also, I added about 1/3 cup chocolate chips and frosted with chocolate frosting and I think that both were overkill.  They were way too sweet, and I have a huge sweet tooth!  I would recommend either adding the chocolate chips or putting frosting on them, but not both.  Thanks for the recipe.

Yum!  To cut a few calories, I decreased the white sugar by a third cup and brown sugar by a quarter cup.  I also only used two TBSP of margarine - the rest was substituted with applesauce.  I found that they were still plenty sweet.

I made these brownies exactly like the recipe called for with the exception of the peanut butter- I used 3/4 cups instead of 1/2.  I also added semi-sweet chocolate chips.  These were fabulous!! My boyfriend and I ate the whole tray in a day (we don't make sweets often because we eat too many too fast.) I will definitely be making these again.  One more thing- if you are like me and like the edges of the brownies for the chewiness- try making them in muffin pan and instead of adding chocolate chips add 2 dark chocolate Hershey kisses to the center of each brownie and cover with more batter before baking.  This is my favorite way to make them- delicious chewy brownies with a gooey chocolate center! YUM!

Very good, and easy to make. I recommend doubling the recipe, you will find that a 9 X 9 is not enough.

These were amazing!!!  I added a cup of chocolate chips since I just love chocolate and peanut butter deserts.  These brownies are so moist and chewy we couldn't stop eating them until they were all gone. Great with a glass of milk :)

These were pretty good! I was feeling a little iffy while pulling them out of the oven as the edges were quite brown and I wasn't sure if the middle was cooked thoroughly. However, after frosting them, they looked perfectly fine and tasted delicious.

I made these with chocolate chunks and then topped them with this frosting: http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Texas-Chocolate-Frosting/Detail.aspx . It made the MOST DELICIOUS COMBINATION ever!! The brownies were so good and peanut-buttery but I don't think they would have tasted as good without the frosting, it would have been too much overkill with the peanut butter taste.  With the chocolate frosting though, it tasted like a baked form of a Reese's mini peanut butter cup or something - SO GOOD!

Very sweet! Tried it once how the recipe stated and for the most part everyone at work loved it. Tried it a second time like a review said by adding cocoa powder to make it look like a chocolate brownie it made them very brick like and dry, had to throw them out.

These were good but a little too sweet. The batter was really thick and they turned out to be more like a cookie than brownie which isn't what I was looking for. Added some choc. chips in

Very tasty! I used crunchy peanut butter.  I also did add about 1/3C of chocolate chips as well as frosting them with chocolate frosting, but next time i think i will just use the frosting...having that much chocolate takes away from the peanut butter and i love the peanut butter flavor!

Love this recipe because it's an easy treat with ingredients you always have. Followed everything to the T, but I did have to bake them for close to 50 minutes for the center to set. I couldn't resist waiting for them to cool to try one. Even better the next day with caramel and chocolate sauce drizzled on top!

for me, it didnt turn out like a peanut butter brownie. it was pretty much like a giant peanut butter cookie. actually exactly like that. not gooey, or fluffy or soft. it was very dense and hard and not really very good. maybe i didn't follow directions closely enough. I think I added more peanut butter than it suggested to.

Brownies (no cocoa powder and thicker batter), no; chewy, YES! A great recipe; make a double batch! I added 2/3 c. semi-sweet morsels, which made them much more like PB chocolate chip cookies in bar form. I took them out at (and they were PERFECT at) 25 min (the edges were browning and a knife came out clean in the center); the full 35 min would probably have dried them out. After cooling completely, they cut very cleanly.

Great reciepe - I cooked in a 9 x 9 pan for the 30 minutes. Was just a little too long, edges were a little tough. Maybe try 28 minutes next time. Topped with chocolate frosting. Yum!

Okay so...I read pretty much EVERY review so that I could get these right. No one's tried them yet because they're currently cooling, but they do look delicious. I was originally planning on making 2 8 x 8 pans, so I doubled all of the ingredients, adding just 3 eggs - but there was definitely not enough mixture for two pans, so I used one and made a very dense brownie. Since it's supposed to taste like cake I figure that'll be fine. I also made Tianne's frosting recipe (from this web site) and will add it once they've cooled. I also added just under a package of semi-sweet chocolate chipits, a bit over 1 cup of peanut butter, about 1/4 cup cocoa powder and only 1 3/4 cup flour.

I made these for a friend who just had a baby and she raved about them and asked for the recipe!  I even used reduced fat peanut butter and they turned out great.  I would HIGHLY recommend frosting them with chocolate icing.  MUCH better this way!

These are very good. I made a few substitutions like 4 tbsp of arrowroot flour for the eggs, and vegan sugar substitutes, and I added some carob powder (I don't know how much I just tossed some in for the fun of it, I'm guessing like 4 tbsp or so). They have a nice soft texture and I think 25 minutes was more than enough time for them to bake well. Yum!

Cover these babies with some chocolate frosting and I'm in heaven.  These were a hit in my house and I didn't change the recipe one bit.

The taste of these were very good. My problem was that they did not cook all of the way through. At first, I tried to take the other reviewers' advice and cook it only 25 minutes, but they were not even close to done. I ended up cooking them for a little less than 35 minutes and they were still not completely done - I think that it was due to the pan I used. 

I do agree with other reviewers, however, that it could have used more peanut butter. 

Other than that, they tasted good, and my family liked them a lot.

I'm sorry, but we didn't really like these. We followed the directions exactly, and pulled them out at 30 minutes---the top was springing back nicely---but we found them to be undercooked. I thought they were edible---until we frosted them with chocolate frosting. Too sweet! I'm getting a cavity just thinking about it!

These are very good and chewy!  I used chunky peanut butter and added some chocolate chips to the mix before baking.  I think those two things really added a little something special and just made them that much better.

These weren't bad exactly, but were pretty bland and I could barely taste the peanut butter.  Mine weren't dry at all, texture was like a bar cookie.  The only changes I made were to use salted butter instead of margarine, and added 1/4 c. chocolate chips.  Maybe the margarine makes a difference.  I can definitely see these being good if you added peanut butter chips and more chocolate chips.

These are so yummy.  I had to bake them for about 48 minutes, as they just weren't done, at the suggested baking time.  I used crunchy peanut butter and a little less of the sugars.  I served them for New Years Eve and everyone loved them.  Thank you!

Everyone loved them. The only things I did differently was to bake them for 25 minutes instead of 30-35 minutes, and I added mini semi-sweet chocolate chips.

Loved the brownies, PB flavor but not too much. Baked mine for 25 minutes because I know that is what my oven is like. Brownies came out moist with a crusty edge and chewy inside.  Followed recipe exact except for baking time.

My family FLIPPED for this recipe!!!  I added Hershey's mini kisses to the top at bake time and they melted a bit and added enough chocolate to the peanut butter...it was a great combo!  Watch the cooking time though; I opted for less and my brownies were soft, moist and chewy.  DELICIOUS!!!

I did'nt think that these had a whole lot of flavor.  I would have added another 1/2 c. of peanut butter.  They were defintley more cake like then brownie like.

This is my new favorite recipe! All my friends beg me to make it.  And my husband wants it for his birthday instead of cake!!! I added chocolate chips and extra peanut butter.  I only have a 8x8 pan so the center was a little gooey despite extra baking time BUT I like gooey brownies.  I've doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13 pan and they came out just as good.  YUMMY!

These are yummy. I doubled the recipe and added a half cup of peanutbutter chips and a half cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. I baked them at 325 degrees for 30 minutes as others suggested. As soon as they came out of the oven, while still hot, I covered the brownies with another cup or so of semi-sweet chips. When the chips melted I spread them around the top of the brownies instead of frosting them.  Great basic recipe.

Let's be realistic - these aren't brownies because brownies have chocolate!  Thus, I added my own gooey chocolate icing right out of the oven and let it melt through these bad boys, and it was fantastic!  They are somewhat cakey in consistency, but they taste fabulous.  Don't be discouraged if the batter looks doughy, it stretches just fine in the oven.  I made this in 2 small pans (5x5 and 4x6)and it made plenty more than 16 brownies.  Taste great, but a bit more peanut butter would be a good call, and definitely mix in both creamy and crunchy kinds!  All in all - great, but it needs a bit of chocolate flair to make it a real brownie!

I'd give this a 5 star rating for flavor, the fact that it was quick and easy, and the ingrediants are easy to come by. However, Im not sure what happened with the baking. I baked these for a good 40 minutes, perhaps a touch longer, and they were pretty mushy. The next day, they were better, but still a little under-done in my opinion. I will try again and update rating if it goes better next time.

I didn't really care for these.  I didn't think they had much flavor at all.  They weren't very sweet, and I could barely taste the peanut butter.  The only thing that saved them was adding frosting.  Without the frosting, these "brownies" would taste like absolutley nothing.

This is a great recipe. I have an exchange student who is gluten-intolerant, meaning no wheat products. So in place of the flour I used 1 cup all-purpose gluten-free flour and 1/2 tsp. xanthum gum, and this recipe still turned out delicious. Some of the recipes I've tried to make gluten-free didn't turn out that great, but this one did. And I am sure it would be 5+ stars with regular flour. Thanks for the great recipe. Oh yeah, I also added some chocolate chips to the recipe before I baked it.

I'm sure they would have been better if I put chocolate on them.  They were ok, but I doubt I'll make them again.

These were great! I added semi-sweet chocolate chips and once the brownies were done I melted the rest of the choc chips and spread it on top of the brownies. Very sweet and delicous. My personal opinion is that these wouldn't have been good w/o the choc.

This recipe is a good “cake-like” peanut butter brownie recipe and doesn’t have the “traditional” brownie texture.  Still, this was a good recipe.  I'd try it again.

These were decent. I had to make minor adjustments because I live far above sea level. The taste and texture was very peanut butter cookie like. I did take the suggestions and frosted them which they needed because the flavor isn't deep enough to stand alone.

Very easy, very yummy. I made this in an 8x8 and this is the frosting I used: I mostly melted two squares semi-sweet chocolate in the microwave then added about a cup of thawed whipped topping--stirring until the squares were completely melted. I had plently of frosting left over. This was a big hit with my husband and his friends.

These didn't come out very well at all. I baked them for 35 minutes, the top sprang back and a toothpick came out clean and it was still undercooked when I cut them. I made it for dessert for company so I was quite disappointed. It tasted good but the texture was quite yucky.

I have never left a review before, but felt I needed to after making these.  THEY ARE SPECTACULAR. I did make changes as others suggested, 3/4c PB, little less sugar, 1 egg and a little less flour, added choc chips and cooked just to 25 mintues.  OH MY!!!  THE BEST!!!

OMG!  So good!!!  As many others suggested, I added some milk chocolate chips to the mixture.  If you are a fan of cookie dough, this could possibly be the best I have ever tasted (even though not exactly "cookie dough").  I tasted one of these yesterday after allowing them to cool and I had another one today.  They were even better today.

Followed the recipe to a "T" except for the addition of chocolate chips(which really doesn't change much;)I enjoyed the dense, chewy, brownie texture, as well as the ease of the recipe. However, I think next time I will look for something a little more peanut buttery. These were yummy with just a hint of peanut butter, but I would like to see more.

Very good and easy to make with ingredients I always have on hand.  I think the recipe could use a little more peanut butter; the pb taste wasn't as strong as I thought it would be.  I added mini kisses.  I won't do that again.  I think the addition of chocolate is a great idea (not needed, however) but I would use semisweet chocolate chips or chocolate icing.   I will definitely make this again.

I thought that these were delicious. I did add a chocolate frosting which made them even tastier. The edges did come out a little crispier but they softened up once I stored them in a plastic container. Personally I thought the amount of peanut butter was perfection (and I love the stuff). Thanks for the recipe!

Very tasty.  I don't know what I did differently from everyone else, but I baked mine for 35 min, and they still seem a bit raw in the middle.  The edges were just barely done.  Not to say they still aren't delicious and disappearing quickly.  We made them into a brownie sundae with ice cream, chocolate syrup and whipped cream.  Super Delish!!!

These were good. But I didn't feel like they really qualify as a brownie. They were more like cookie bars as they had a texture more like a cookie than a brownie. Still good though.

I just finished making these and when they came from the oven, they were missing just one thing: a sweet peanut butter aroma.  Despite the lack of tempting scent, they were rather good.  I added chocolate chips to spice things up a bit.  They were good, but not something I would make again.

I was a little surprised to see that this recipe has no chocolate!
To make them more brownie-like I removed 1-2 tbsp of flour and added 2 tbsp of cocoa powder. I also threw in some chocolate chips, they were REALLY good!

I used 3/4 cup peanut butter and only 1 egg per other reviews.  Tastes pretty good, still not peanut buttery enough maybe.  Mine turned out a little too dry and gritty.  I used broken up chocolate Easter bunny mixed in, overall very yummy.

We were looking forward to these all week and I wrecked them.  Ended up coming out more like a cookie cake.

I cooked ours for 30 mins and probably should have only let them go for 25.

We may try these again with some modifications.  The smell while they were cooking was incredible.

These are good but maybe I was expecting a little more after reading all the positive reviews. I added mini kisses to the batter and extra peanut butter but I don't think it has that much of a peanut butter taste. If I do make this again I will add only one egg so it's less cake-like.

We all liked this one, I used the idea of the chocolate chips on the top to take the place of icing and it worked really well, so thank you for that idea as well.
 A really good recipe, thank you

This was a great brownie recipe. I used only one egg. I also melted chocolate chips on the top, this made it to sweet though. Next time I will just drizzle chocolate on the top and try them with chunky peanut butter.

This recipe was just ok. My family seemed to like it, but they aren't that picky. They will try anything. I was looking for something more chewy and brownie-like and less cake-like. The flavor wasn't that great either. It tasted more like very heavy and rich cake that was missing something. It definitely needed more peanut butter and less flour. I don't know what would've happened if I hadn't of added the chocolate chips melted on top at the end. That really salvaged the flavor somewhat.

I'm assuming I did something wrong because these were terrible. I doubled the recipe because I didn't have a small pan and I added extra peanut butter as others recommended. It came out like a cake. A very dry cake. I put store bought chocolate frosting on the top and that helped a little. But wow, they wree dry. And flavorless. Not sweet at all. I'm not sure I'd even try this again if I had the right size pan.

I used flax and water to replace the eggs in this, as well as subbed half the fat for applesauce. The brownies were kind of flat and were really greasy, even with half of the margarine replaced. Chocolate melted on top made them edible, but heavy.

Very good, although it took a bit to get them completely cooked (I used an 8X8 pan).  I added chocolate chunks and people raved over them.

These brownies are great. I made them for 180 kids at summer camp. The only change I made was to put the chocolate chips in the batter so they would be easier to handle. Everyone raved about them. These will be a regular on my camp menus.

I followed the recipe exactly and our family and guests just did not care for them.  They were not sweet enough, maybe because I used natural peanut butter.  We added chocolate frosting, and they still just did not taste good.  I gave 2 stars because they did taste a little better the next day, when they were cold out of the refrigerator.  Probably will not make these again.

I had a sudden peanut butter craving and these certainly hit the spot.  Easy to make and I topped them with canned frosting.  Following other suggestions, I added 3/4 c. of peanut butter.

Didn't look that great when out of the oven, but once frosted (I used a whipped frosting) they were fine.  And tasted great! Will make again.

Delicious!  So many modications were being made to this recipe, I decided to make the recipe almost "as is."  My only change was increasing the p.b. to 3/4 cup.  Chocolate frosting would be great, but I took the super-quick approach and tossed some chocolate chips on the top as soon as they came out of the oven. . .then just spread them around a bit once melted.  I'll be taking these to a meeting tonight and expect them to disappear quickly!

i also used about 3/4 c of peanut butter, reversed the white and brown sugars, and didn't add salt. baked at 300 degrees for about 35 minutes. they are a bit crumbly rather than chewy, and a bit dry. next time i will add an extra egg. frosted with a light chocolate frosting. these are good, and with some adjustments, i will make them again;******* made these again wihout any changes, and added erin's frosting suggestion. i even made them without the benefit of an electric mixer, AND while holding my ten-month-old son. my husband, who begs for a great pb bar, loved these. 5 stars, and added to my permenant collection ... :)

LOVE this recipe!!  I did make small changes after reading the reviews.  I put in 3/4 cup peanut butter.  Used an 8x8 pan - cooked at 325 for about 50-55 minutes - but I checked at about 40 and they needed a bit more to be done.  I bought a chocolate frosting from the store and put it on the brownies while they were still warm.  This melted the frosting a bit - then I put the brownies in the fridge to cool.  Very good!  Will make this again an again!

These turned out pretty well.  I increased the peanutbutter to 3/4 c., added 1/4 c. of cocoa and 1/3 c. of chocolate chips and put in an extra egg because the batter seemed kind of stiff.  When it cooled, I frosted the brownies with chocolate frosting.  I didn't have a 9X9 pan so I took others' recommendations and used an 8X8 pan and reduced the heat to 325 and cooked the brownies for 40 minutes.

this brownie recipe was really simple and easy... the second time I made them, I added an extra egg and used 3/4 C of peanut butter instead of 1/2 to make the flavour strong and give them more of a brownie texture. Baking them at 220C for about 13 minutes works really well =)

These were great with a handful of dark chocolate chips sprinkled on top fresh out of the oven. However, either the temperature or the cooking time was a little off. the edges were hard and the middle was liquid. After I put them back in a cooler oven for a few minutes longer, they were more firm inside. Delicious, though!

Hubby doesnt like chocolate SO......always looking for a new "brownie" recipe for him.  This was OK.  Needs more PEANUT flavor and for some reason they werent "cooked" in the middle and still HARD as a rock on the edges...and I am an avid baker so my oven is PERFECT, no problems with that.  Still on the search for a good peanut butter brownie recipe!

Good but alas, I prefer chocolate to peanut butter!  I did sprinkle dark chocolate chips on the top and spread them once they were melted.  Mine came out a little on the dry side like a couple other reviews have suggested but not too bad.  I would still make them for anyone who is crazy about peanut butter!

I'm so lucky to have this recipe as my first experience in baking. It's soooo great! I followed the ingreadients exactly and it turned out great! I just notched up the oven to about 220C, cooked at about 15 minutes and it came out perefect! I ate it together with Nutella chocolate spread and it was even better! I can't wait to have my officemates taste my creation ;)

I used an 11x7 pan and had them in at 350 for close to an hour. The top was starting to burn and they were nowhere near finished cooking in the center. Added 3/4 c. peanut butter and didn't find enough p.b. taste even after sprinking with peanut butter chips before baking. May try again after reading MORE reviews and taking good notes.

Super good, super easy, super fast!  I used 1/2 a recipe of the 'Chocolate Frosting I' on this Web site to top them.  Excellent!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is great!  My family loved it.  I made them once for a MLB game and by the end they were gone.  Then when I made them on vacation in a matter of 1 hour they were gone!  I think they're best with about 2 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate chips sprinkled on top before baking. Delicious!

Good Recipe, There is a chocolate Cream cheese frosting you can buy if you do not have the itme to make your own frosting.  If you stick to the recipe you may end up cooking it longer (about 45 min) because it dosent quite get done all the way in the midlle.

These were great. Took them to a party, frosted with Tianne's chocolate frosting (off this website). The only problem I had was they were a little too soft in the middle, but everyone loved them none the less. And for all I know they're supposed to be that way, it wasn't a BAD thing, just different.

This was so easy and delicious!  I thought mine were going to end up a little dry, but the outside was just right and the inside melts in your mouth.  I added melted chocolate on top after they came out of the oven.

This was truly wonderful, especially with the chocolate frosting. This one is a keeper. The brownies are chewy and moist with a lot of flavor. My kids like creamy peanut butter but it would be fun to try it with extra crunchy!

This recipe is great!  I brought the brownies to work and evryone loved them!!!!!  It was also very fast.  It makes a perfect amount.  The only thing I found frustrating was the 1/3 and 2/3 cup measurements (many measuring cup sets do not have these for dry ingedients) I used a liquid measure cup instead but everything turned out fine.  I will use this recipe over and over again.

I tried this recipe last night and we love it!  It is a great brownie, better than a fudge one in my opinion, but is nearly perfect with a little chocolate icing.  I only had an 8x8 pan, so it was a little thicker, and took a few minutes longer to cook, but definitely a new family favorite!

These were great. I sprinkled chocolate chips over the top when they came out of the oven and it was a perfect topping.  I'll definitely keep this recipe.

These brownies are really easy to make and are delicious! I double the receipe and take these to work. Every day my co-workers are asking me when I am going to bring more. Definitly a keeper. I added chocolate chips to mine and semi-sweet m&m`s baking pieces to add a little color to them
