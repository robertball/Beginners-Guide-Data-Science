Amazing - a bit spicy and sweet but with subtle complexity to the flavor. I would give this 4.5 stars if I could but I'm rounding up since I can't.

For the sauce I used 5 fresh Anaheim and 2 dried California chillies instead of gujillo (both are fairly mild in heat), 5 large cloves of garlic, 1 tsp. of garlic powder, a 7 oz. can of chipotle chili in adobo, 1 tbsp. canola oil, about 1/4 cup of extra adobo sauce and I put salt and pepper on the roast before coating it with sauce. 

I vacuum-pack marinated the meat for 7 hours and instead of stir frying I sous vide cooked the pork roast for 20 hours at 143 degrees in the marinade. 

The tacos turned out incredible but the meat with a bit of sauce and pineapple was delicious to snack a la cart. The meat had a slight kick from the chipotle so it you like a lot of heat add more of those or maybe add a serrano or two with veins. 

This dish is going in my main rotation.

This was very good the first day, but amazing the following day! I put the whole recipe in my crock pot without marinating, cooked on low all day, and made al pastor burritos the first night. The meat was quite tender and delicious, but I knew marinating would have given it more depth. Taco's the next day were great, and the third day I just ate it straight- yummy! 
I did change the pineapple ratio as I don't care for sweet meat. The first day it was sweet, but the second day it had balanced, and the third day it was spicy!

I could not give this more than 3 stars. I followed the Recipe exactly but it had virtually no flavor (and I marinated the pork overnight). I did add plenty of Adobo, but this definitely needs some good old fashioned SALT. It didn't taste bad, but for all the work this was, it was not worth it and that was really disappointing. I will stick with a different recipe.

Popped the whole recipe in the slow cooker after making the sauce as per the recipe. Cooked on low for 8 hours and it was fabulous! Fall apart tender and everyone loved the little "street" tacos we served.

Really good recipe.  It was a lot of work but the end result was AMAZING!  I would suggest a little more salt in the dish.

This recipe is an awesome starting point. After making the marinade as directed and tasting it, I made a few modifications:

The marinade needs to be boiled for more than 2 minutes for it to lose the raw onion flavor, and I felt that it needed significantly more pineapple juice for it to have the sweet-heat flavor I was trying to recreate. I ended up adding three 8 oz cans of pineapple juice (total), and boiled the marinade for 15 minutes or so to reduce the liquid and let the flavors come together. I also used 2 tablespoons of adobo from the chipotle can, added a few tablespoons of brown sugar, and a fair amount of salt (I also added salt to taste to the pork while it was cooking). I used fresh pineapple instead of canned. Otherwise, followed the recipe to a T. It was a big hit at my house, and will definitely be part of our meal rotation.

A few tips: There ended up being A LOT of marinade, so I used only the marinade that was needed to saturate the meat, and set aside the rest to freeze. Glad that I'll be able to make this meal on the fly next time. When I make this again from scratch, I will double it so that I have several meal's worth for the freezer. This recipe is labor intensive for sure, but definitely worth it! Especially if you can get more than one meal out of it!

Also, instead of cooking the meat in batches, I saved time by using more than one pan. I had one cast iron and one calphalon, and both worked equally well.

I didn't have time to marinade so I slow cooked the pork in the sauce instead of just marinading in it.  The results were very good!  The sauce needs additional flavor...more adobo seasoning, chile powder, cumin did the trick.  FYI...this is not a novice recipe.  It is pretty involved, but worth it!

I've always loved those little tacos you can buy on the streets of Mexico! Three for one dollar and they are soooo good! This recipe is about as close as you can get .... north of the border. Ole!

Needs a bit more spice but otherwise very good. I used shredded cabbage and cotija cheese, spritz with lime juice.

I made this last Halloween. I followed the recipe but instead of adding chopped onions, I added onion powder (so I didn't have to boil it to remove the onion taste. Lol). I used crushed pineapple and added the juice and the pineapple when I put the mixture in the food processor. This recipe needs more salt. I added more adobo seasoning and cumin and more of the sauce from the chipotle chilies. Marinated it overnight and it came out so good!!! We grilled the beef slices and choppped all up and mixed in the remaining marinade to the still hot chopped meat. Everyone in my family loved it! My husband ate the leftovers for days!!! I'll make this again. The effort was worth it!

Awesome! Did a 24 hour marinade and will make these again soon!! I got 33 street taco sized out of my batch. They were a hit with everyone even though I added an extra chile and adobo sauce. I use crushed pineapples & blended 1/2 into the sauce. I was eating the sauce w/ a spoon right out of the pot.. it was so good!

Serve w/ onions, radish & cilantro. Some of my guests wanted cheese to I used finely shredded monterrey jack.

We just love this recipe!  After making a few times, these are my modifications to suit my family's taste (The recipe is still 5 star without them)  I add about 1/2 can of chipotle chiles in adobo sauce and double the pineapple juice and chunks ( ie 2 20oz cans).   I marinade the pork overnight and then cook it in crockpot the next day.  Fresh tortillas, pickled onions, avocado, lime, radish, cilantro = Heaven!    Even better, I throw about half of it gallon ziplock and freeze for another meal, too.

I already had pork tenderloin in the crockpot with some spice, a dash of liquid smoke, pineapple and black beans when I found this recipe. Added 2 tbsp chipotle chilli and adobo after reading recipe and a tbsp of brown sugar. Used mostly for ideas on serving the tortillas themselves. Served with small warmed tortillas with pineapple chunks, sweet white onion, the pork shredded and chopped with the reserved pineapple juice added to make it juicy, fresh cilantro and lime. The side was broccoli slaw with honey mustard dressing and celery seed. Loved it so much had again the next night with home made corn tortillas. That's was even better.

I can't believe that I made these at home. They are restaurant quality for sure! I served mine with the lime, cilantro, and onions that the recipe called for, plus some thinly sliced radishes, pico de gallo, and avocado. An absolute hit and worth the time and effort. The only thing I changed was to add a pinch of salt to taste after the pork had cooked because it needed a little boost. Definitely make these tacos! They're amazing.

It turned out like the thing I have dreamt of. I never like the Americanized taco that covered with cheese. We went to the Hispanic festival and decided to try the real taco. I went back to the long line to get more and determined to hunt for the similar recipe. This is the closest one. Thank you so much Goya. I guess there is no Goya branded salt so it's not on the list. Just add salto to your liking. After the first attempt was a success, I usually double or triple the recipe and freeze the rest. I use the fresh pineapple and add salt. I even make my own tortillas now !!!

This is very good and easy. My family has been buy Al Pastor at a local Hispanic grocery store that was very good but they changed the recipe they were using. So I decided to make it myself. It was easier then I thought it might be and the flavor was really good. For sure I'll make it again.

I have tried this recipe for few times and using the fresh pineapple is the best one. Use a good ripened fresh pineapple with yellow crunchy meat and sweet great aroma at the bottom. Chop half of the pineapple and add 2 cans of pineapple juice to marinade the pork. Add more salt to your taste and you will never go back to Taco bell taco.

Good sauce, I only used one chipotle pepper (too spicy otherwise) mild New Mexico dried chiles are ok too, instead of the 5 Guajillo and 5 Pasilla chiles, cheaper in Arizona but the original chiles were tastier...and added 1/2 to 3/4 cup of Orange Juice too.  Used cheese grater for onion not chunks and blended in a Ninja blender for 3 minutes.

This was an easy dinner!! Everything was delicious! I recommend it for others to try.
