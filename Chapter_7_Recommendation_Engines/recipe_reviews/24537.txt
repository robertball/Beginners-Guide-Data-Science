I added caraway seed and I browned the pork before adding to crock pot.  The house smelled great when we got home.  Excellent winter meal.  I served it with mashed garlic potatoes and applesauce as suggested, but also served peas and carrots on the side for color.

I made this for New Years Day to take into work for dinner for my co-workers. I had never made a pork in the crock pot and it turned out great! All the guys at work raved about it, and suprisingly, they could even taste the apple. I did modify this recipe slightly, using a 4 lb pork roast/loin (cut into about 6 slices) and used 1 1/2 apples. The apple did reduce the "zing" from the sauerkraut. I like the "zing", so maybe next time I would probably only use the 1/2 apple that it called for. Otherwise, it cooked up great-meat was tender, and I served it like everyone else seems to, with mashed potatoes and applesauce. Oh, also, I used the sauerkraut that somes refridgerated in a bag, found it back in the meat dept.

I loved the addition of all of the spices in this dish, comparred to other simular recipes from the site.  I used a bottle of Sam Adams Cranberry Lambic, and that made for a wonderful tasting roast.  If your roast came out dry, my suggestion would be to use the entire 12 oz. of beer, otherwise there will not be enough liquid, hence the dry roast.  Good recipe Bianca, served with mashed potatoes & applesauce as suggested = yum. Thanks!  (Hi Manda, the point of the apple is to take the tart out of the sauerkraut.  Happy Cooking, better luck next time ;)

I think the secret of this recipe is to start with a good tasting sauerkraut. I made the recipe exactly as written with the exception of adding a few caraway seeds. I also used sliced kielbasa instead of the pork. My wife even commented on how great this turned out. Five stars for sure!

This was my first experience with sauerkraut. My hub requested it because his mom always used to make it. It is strong flavored but I really like it. Follow the guidelines and have it with mashed potatoes and applesauce to kind of ease the strong flavor. I follow the recipe exactly except skip the beer and it is really very delicious. My hub says it is better than his moms :)

I was disappointed with the results. I found that doing away with the beer and adding a touch of brown sugar improved the flavor.  I won't be using this receipe again. Sorry.

My mom makes a pork and sauerkraut dish that I was looking for when I found this recipe, and this one was even better! I followed the recipe almost exactly... but my pork loin was over 2 lbs, so I doubled everything except for the apple. I also added about a tsp of caraway seeds. I didn't cube the roast either, I just cut two long slits lengthwise and stuffed them with sauerkraut, then broke broke the roast up as it cooked. Excellent meal, and it was exactly what we were looking for on a cold day!

Sorry Grams, but this is dull.  Too briney, not enough interest, the pork was flavorless. I wouldn't make this again.

this was amazing.  everyone loved it.  it went really well with the mash potatos. i used an apple in the recipe as suggested. i had doubled on most of the ingredients to make extra.  it was a tradition in my family to make this for new years.  i think this was the best it has ever tasted.  the apple and the beer make a huge difference in the taste.  im not sure if my mom did that. i was worried that i had used too much beer, (i used 2 full beers) but it cooked all day long and by the time it was finished it was perfect.  everyone loved it, we ate many left-overs and it tatested great every time.

I don't know what happened but it turned out awful. I couldn't eat it. I am originally from PA dutch country so I know how it usually tastes. This wasn't it.

Very plain, home cooking style meal.  Easy to make, very fast with pressure cooker, and my European friends loved it.

This is a really nice basic crockpot recipe! Instead of a roast, I used two extra thick pork chops, added some onion soup powder (I didn't have onion salt), extra garlic and omitted the apple (I like the sauerkraut zing!)..Will make again but may add more liquid as I LOVED the juices! Thanks for sharing!

Loved this recipe!!!  My grandmother was Pennsylvania dutch and this tasted just like hers, only less fatty because she would use either a whole roast or bone-in chops. I added garlic also, and the carraway seed as suggested by a previous viewer...delicious!!  I would love to try it with the cranberry beer as someone indicated.  I like to use a thicker chop, and cook it slow.  I love the zing of sauerkraut too, but the hubby doesn't so the apple really helped.  He said this recipe is the only way he'll eat sauerkraut.  Add a little scallion to your mashed potatoes, and spoon this over them and it's wonderful!

First off, I doubled this recipe and instead of using an apple, I used 2 cups of homemade apple butter and added Kielbasa. It was a hit for the New Year and was full of flavor! My family loved it and it was so easy to make!

Will make again next New Year's!

Very smooth flavor.  I don't like my sauerkraut too sweet or too sour.  We also like to add bisquick dumplings on the top.

Everyone else liked this better than I did, the sauerkraut was very mild. I, on the other hand, like my sauerkraut with more of a bite. Hence the four stars.

I made this for my husband's birthday. This is a HUGE hit!!! Exchanged the pork roast for bratwurst sausages, that I cut up into 1 inch chunks. Also, couldn't find dry mustard, used a few squirts of regular mustard. This came out delicious, and everyone kept going back for more. I will definitely make this again!

id go with a pork tenderloin. when i made this, it was a good flavor, but the meat was pulling apart enough as to make the bits of pork blend well with the other stuff. the pork roast kinda binds up. its not bad, but i think a higher quality meat is much better. also, throw in there two keilbasa pieces to give a little fatty content and its yumx2.

i like the mustard, dill, onion and apple combo. its a good recipe, but needs a lot of tinkering to get it right..so that its awesome on 'taters.

I made this today, but used dried dill.  It was flavorful and delicious.  My piece of apple disintegrated into the sauerkraut when I stirred it, and it tasted great anyway.

We used pork chops, and browned them first.  We also added sliced onions, a little bit of brown sugar, horseradish mustard and fresh garlic.  It was very good, but could use a little more flavor and spice!

Great idea in crock pot. This is Penn Dutch dish my Mom would serve on New Year's Day for good luck for the whole year.  My Dad added potatoes and carrots toward the end of cooking for a one pot meal.  He was Norwegian so he had to have potatoes!

Made this in the crockpot. It came out more like a soup but was good. Probably wouldn't use beer, too much liquid. Served with potatoes and applesauce as suggested. Good, cheap meal.

I never really liked pork and sauerkraut when I was growing up, but this recipe is very tasty.  I made a double batch in my crock pot for a church fellowship meal. Everybody really enjoyed it. I will definitely make this one again.

I omitted the beer and there was enough juices with the sauerkraut.  I would drain the kraut if I used the beer otherwise it would be too soupy.  The dill and garlic taste great.  I really enjoyed this simple recipe.

I made this last night for dinner, I did not have any beer so I used a 2/3 of water, to try and avoid the dish from burning and the meat drying out. I did not have any minced garlic so I used 1 tbsp of garlic powder. Sadly the meat turned out very DRY. I will give this recipe another chance using the beer next time and fresh garlic, however I will scale down the "low" temp cooking to 4 hours to try and avoid the meat from drying out.

I tried this for the first time and thought the pork turned out very dry. I make very sour kraut and pork and do a very good job! I shown this recipe to my wife and she said let's try it for the New year. The sour kraut and it's flavor was very good, but the pork roast was very dry and we picked it out of our sour kraut. I followed the recipe to the T. We had our roast cut from the butcher and we checked it off and on for tenderness. I'll go back my own way.

This is so tasty!  I added a little garlic and onion powder to it.  (Maybe a teaspoon of each) I also added about a half teaspoon more onion salt.  I think next time I will use one inch thick pork chops cubed instead of pork roast.  I don't like the dark meat so much.  The apple sauce and mashed potato accompaniments were delicious.  Served it with a nice Belgian beer.  A big hit!

I made this in the crockpot today and it was fabulous!  My 13 y.o. son had a couple of friends over, and they liked it alot.  I used 2 1/2 lbs. of pork instead of 1, and used a 1 lb. container of fresh, locally made sauerkraut.  This one's definitely a keeper, delicious!

This was a good recipe.  I did not have the time to cook it in the crock pot so I cooked it on the stove for an hour.  I will make this again, maybe with the caraway seed.

I love sauerkraut.  I found this one intruiging.  I used a bottle of Guiness in this recipe.  I didn't really care for the taste at all.  Won't be making it again.  Didn't really understand the point of the apple.

You have to brown all sides of the pork roast in a separate pan before you place in the sauerkraut or it will fall apart cooking with the sauerkraut. Also if you add hot dogs you MUST wait till the temp of the pork reaches 180 degrees or you will cross contaminate the hot dogs!

I made it with no beer and  it didn't lack for liquid.  I dusted the pork cubes with AP flour and browned in olive oil. I used two whole  skin on chopped granny smith apples and two sweet onions, which I sauteed in the same olive oil along with the garlic and dill weed. I added table salt in place of onion salt. and a bout 1/4 of brown sugar. We will have this again, and I will change it to fit what is in the house. Very versitile.

My Polish version contains   kminek / cumin, paprika  majeranek marjoram, I brown my pork and use good quality sour cabbage   farm shop or own home made  not to sour, if , it is to sour  just wash  part of it and squeeze well and I use vegetable stock or instead of sour cabbage brine I my shred 1 carrot or add a  2-3 dried prunes or  tomato puree... from my observation most market caned sour kraut contains vinegar but the natural sour kraut/cabbage the flavor gets from various lactic acid bacteria, including Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus, and Pediococcus. That way sam my experience problem whit to sour final dish...

This turned out wonderfully! I substituted apple butter for the apple, as someone had suggested. I used a gluten free sorghum beer and a friend contributed homemade sauerkraut.  We both loved it!  Served it with homemade gluten free bread with butter. A side really seemed unnecessary for this filling meal.

I adapted this for 6 thin cut chops, lightly browned and spiced with dill, salt and pepper, layered on the bottom of Pam'd slow cooker. Covered with large jar of Bubbies Kraut (added another cup of kraut, so about 6 cups). Two sliced honey crisp apples. 3 chopped garlic cloves, teaspoon dried mustard and half bottle of lime Michelob Ultra! Added a cup of chicken broth after two hours on high and finished after one more hour (3 hours on high total). Amazing, easy and chops were fork tender. Served with mashed potatoes, apple sauce and pretzel rolls.

I found that the sauerkraut tasted a bit too "apple-y" for me (I like my kraut with a bit of tang).  It could be due to the beer/cider that I'd used (Angry Orchard original), so I may attempt this with a different type of beer.  The pork chops were great, however; nice and tender.  I would probably recommend a light beer as opposed to a dark ale-type.

I also added caraway seed like some recipes suggested. I completed the recipe pretty much as written otherwise (fresh onion for onion salt was one other substitution). I also browned the meat before throwing it all up in the crockpot, which helped both flavor and texture.

I would smush this into my mouth again.

Very good. Used a dark lager which added to the seasoning. My family really liked this,even my youngest who is not fond of sauerkraut.

I really loved this recipe especially since myself and my kids don't really like sauerkraut. I made this recipe on a night when I had my mom over and she loved it too.
