Very flavorful.  Even worked with "veggie shreds" instead of cheese for those who may be lactose intolerant and are missing the creamy soup recipes.

We love this.  I left out the potatoes and green beans, added peas and thickened to gravy consistency, used boneless, skinless thighs well trimmed and served over mashed potatoes. It was delicious. I have also tried it without the cheese and think it's even better. Thank you Okie for a wonderful, versatile recipe that doesn't include canned soup.

Great soup. Halved recipe & made my own broth by boiling chicken breasts with a bullion cube, some parsley flakes and dash of garlic powder. I made the roux in the pan with the sauteed veggies and like other reviewers was not satisfied with the thickness of the soup, so I added a few tsp of cornstarch. I also used about half of the cheese and ranch mix as was recommended and it had great flavor. Will def. be making again. :)

I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS soup. Just so everyone knows I submitted this recipe some years ago.  I submitted the recipe stating thicken to your own taste and/or preference using roux and described how to make roux.  I make it as a chowder and pretty thick,  however some people don't like it as thick as I do.  Thus the choice in the recipe.  It has irritated me forever that many of the comments say the soup is not thick enough as written. This is because it is not written verbatim as I wrote it, you can make it as thick or thin as you want to. The flavors are what the recipe is about, as with all soups.  You can make any soup into a chowder by thickening it with roux.  When I make a roux I keep on thickening whatever I have made until it as thick as  I like it.  I love this soup/chowder and make it every winter!

I made this recipe tonight and it turned out great.  Based on the other reviews on the thickness I decided to change it up just a little.  I added a little extra flour to the base as well as a little milk to thicken it up.  It turned out perfect and was fairly easy to make.  I will definately make this recipe again.

Impressively good soup.  I followed the directions exactly except I thickened with 1 tbs. cornstarch instead of the roux.  I will make this again for sure.

Delicious soup with great flavor. I would definately call it a "soup" rather than a "chowder" because it is a thin soup. I added some cornstarch to thicken it.

This soup had a very good flavor, but was a little on the thin side. I will thicken it more if I make it again.

Delicious! Made it without the red pepper flakes, as we have small children, and worried it would be to spicy. Still great. Added the soup to the roux instead of other way around. Made extra roux which we put into the soup after the first batch. I used 1 1/2# of chicken as we have 6 people. Also increased ranch to 1 1/2 oz, and cheese to 3/4-1# (the extra 1/4 didn't seem to make that much of a difference). Threw in some half & half for extra richness. Absolutley delicious!

Tasty, simple, and inexpensive. I made it exactly as the recipe stated. Makes more than six servings -- more like 10.

First off I didn't realize what a huge batch this made. I should at least half the serving sizes next time. But let me just say that this, while being a thinner chowder, was one of the most delicious things I've made. The leftovers were great too!

Wow! Such great flavor. I "healthafied" by using 1.5 cup shredded cheddar with 2T whole wheat flour and 1T corn starch mix into the flour before putting it in the soup. This was my thickener. No butter. 1.5 packets of ranch because I already had one open. So flavorful! Husband lived it too!!  Already added to the cook book!

Not bad, not bad at all. I would've preferred the roux to make the chowder a bit more thick, but all in all not bad for a Wed night dinner!

This soup is delicious. I think the recipie is missing something, though, as it doesn't call for cooked chicken and it doesn't tell you to cook the chickne for more than 5 minutes. Maybe I am missing something. To resolve this, I cooked the chicken with the potatoes and followed the directions otherwise. Get some good sourdough bread for dipping. Excellent soup!

Wow, my husband and I really enjoyed this soup. I pretty much followed the recipe with some additions. I added half and half and added corn. I always read reviews and saw the writer stating to thicken as desire. I also just used real cheddar cheese as garnish. It was so good. Thank you for a great recipe.

I have not made this as of yet, but it sounds absolutely fantastic, instead of a roux I will use cream soup base.  Yum, can’t wait to make it!

Due to so many reviews saying the soup was thin I only used 6 cups of chicken stock which gave it a nice consistency.  I thought the ranch mix was a great twist on a really basic chicken soup, but it just didn't have to wow factor I was hoping for.

I will make it again, but I will leave out the crushed red peppers.
It was too spicy for me. Some people thought it was not spicy and some did. I would probably try Hungarian Paprika instead.
The only problem was that it took me much longer to prepare than was suggested. Instructions say 20 minutes prep and 40 minutes cook time. It took me 3-1/2 hours total for prep and cooking.

Good recipe!! I was looking for a chicken stew to serve with corn bread and this turned out great. Since it's just my husband and I, I halved the recipe. Also I have gluten allergies so I thickened it with potato flakes. We both really enjoyed it.

After reading the reviews, I modified as follows, and everyone loved it and came back for more! I used green onions, peppers, carrots, green beans, and pea pods from the garden since that's what I had.  I only used 6 cups of chicken broth. I only used about 2/3 of the ranch packet. I thickened it more with cornstarch and added a bit of half and half. My chicken was rotisserie chicken.

Wonderful recipe!!! My extremely picky boyfriend said he absolutely loved it (and he never says that about ANYTHING) !  Made it exactly as written except I doubled the cheese and I didn't have a bell pepper so I used zucchini instead. Try it!!!
