I didn't like the cream filling.  I made it over using confectioner's sugar and 2% milk and it was much better.

Very yummy.  I altered the recipe to include two boxes of jiffy white frosting and powdered sugar instead of just white sugar because of the unique taste the jiffy mix has.  Also, instead of cutting bars and splitting, I just split the whole cake, frosted, then reassembled.  The cream was great and thick enough to not splooge out too much when taking a bite!

I made these yesterday.  I needed something to make for my kid's lunches.  I did the recipe exactly as stated.  They came out great.  Next time, after the cake has been taken out of the pan and cooled, I am going to put the cake in the freezer before I cut it to make the bars.  Just make it easier with the cake partially frozen. I put them in individual sandwich bags and put in the fridge so they will have snacks for the next few days for school.  Thanks for the recipe!!

How is it that yellow cake mix is listed as sponge cake??  I made a Betty Crocker sponge cake and used a cream filling consisting of 1/4 C of butter, 1/4 C shortening, 2 C confectioners' sugar, 3 TBSP milk, pinch of salt and 1 tsp vanilla.  Try it! It's better than the brand name.  Took it to a church bake sale and they sold like hot cakes.

These turned out really yummy! I took them to a church dessert social, and they were a big hit! Plus, they were surprisingly easy to make.

WOW!! Made this yesterday. ABSOLUTELY OUT OF THIS WORLD!. Tastes better than the brand name of Twinkies. My grandkids were inhaling them. Even Chris, and he doesn't like Twinkies.Even my husband ate 2 and he doesn't eat sweets. Thank you so much for a wonderful treat that will be made over  and over!!!!!!!1

For a recipe that attempts to be like a well-known filled individual snack cake, this one succeeds.  My husband says that it is even better than Twinkies.  Next time I will try the recipe with a chocolate cake mix.  A really nice (not fancy) dessert.

so i followed the advise of the people before me who said that i should us powdered sugar, and so far i'm not too pleased.  i was hoping for something much more airy and less buttery.  most likely i made it wrong, or i haven't eaten enough Twinkies to be able to compare but i don't think the recipe stacks up.

These were soooo delicious! I used butter-flavored shortening instead of regular since that is what I had on hand, and it was still so yummy. My husband is not even much of a sweets fanatic and he loved them as well. At first I thought the filling was not going to turn out; it looks really runny at first when you add the milk and vanilla, but after beating it about 5 minutes it was perfect. I will try this again maybe with an orange or strawberry cake mix.

I made a homemade cake recipe rather than a cake mix. I also made cupcakes instead of a cake. The filling was a bit "gritty" and not very sweet so I added a litttle powered sugar. I split the cupcakes and filled them with the filling. Pretty good!

I made it as stated. 
They taste great. I had trouble with the icing. Much of the milk would not incorporate into the rest of the ingredients! Where did I go wrong? There was still plenty of icing for the cakes.  I Will try again because they taste Great!!!!!
