I didn't follow the cooking instructions exactly as directed for this, but I wanted to make this because the ingredients sounded nice together. The directions don't say how you should cook the chicken, so I cooked it in a separate pan on the stove and then added the sautéed onion and garlic, (because how can you not have garlic?), to the chicken. I also used some basil and some italian seasoning on the chicken. I found it strange that this recipe had no added spices or anything. Then after that was mixed up a bit, I added the tomatoes and stirred in the cream cheese so that it could melt together nicely. Then I took all of that off the oven and mixed it in with the spinach and the cooked noodles and placed it in a casserole dish. Covered it with cheese and baked it in the oven. It was pretty yummy. I will say I accidentally made too many noodles because I used no yolk noodles instead of penne, so I think next time if I use the right amount of noodles, the flavors will be much better. This has a good basis for a delicious family pasta dish. I will make this again.

This was tasty. I used leftover chicken I had grilled the night before.  I did add garlic that I sautéed in zesty Italian dressing. I added the tomatoes, sliced up cream cheese and spinach to that mix before mixing it with pasta. It got rave reviews in the family.

Chicken Spinach Pasta Bake Haiku: "My favorite combo. For things in a pasta bake, no surprise, it's good!" I've made many variations of pasta bakes, but my tastebuds always fall back on wanting my classic chicken/spinach, so I was happy to try out this recipe, only Oops! I didn't have cream cheese, but that's OK, b/c I just added some extra Italian-blend shredded cheese and it still retained its yummy factor. Also sauteed garlic along w/ the onion b/c something seems infinitely askew w/ the kitchen universe when I don't smell the 2 mating in olive oil together. Had to S&P to taste, but all in all, a successful pasta bake.

This was delicious!  I typed in ingredients I had on hand and up popped this recipe. I followed Amber's review on mixing the ingredients.  The creamy, the aldente penne pasta, just the right amount of tomatoes, combined with everyone's favorites of chicken and spinach.....all compliment each other so well to make a great dish!  Bravo??????

I made this delicious dish for my family of 7 and they loved it! It doesn't tell you how to make the chicken but I sautéed it with garlic, basil, a dash of salt, pepper and a dash of thyme. First I boiled the noodles (al dente') about 11 min. While boiling the noodles, i sautéed the boneless skinless chicken tenderloins (with the seasoning listed above). I added the onions to the chicken and sautéed again for about 6 min. Once onions browned, I added the penne pasta (drained of course). Then I added the diced tomatoes. I couldn't find "Italian-styled" diced tomatoes so I added Italian herb seasoning and about 2 teaspoons of sugar). I stirred that together and added it to the pasta, chicken and onions. I transferred it to a big baking dish and added the cream cheese and spinach. I mixed all of it together in the baking dish and sprinkled the mozzarella cheese through the dish and on top for garnish. Baked it covered with foil for 30 min and it came out perfect! The entire family loved it! I will be making this again in the future and will save this as one of my favorite family dishes!

This was delicious. I seasoned my chicken first. I didn't have an onion so I added 1/4 tsp onion powder as well as 1/4 tsp of garlic powder. I place that in a large skillet with the chicken and added the tsp of olive oil.  I then added the tomatoes and softened cream cheese.  I also added about 2 ounces of Mozzarella cheese since I bought a 2 cup bag and didn't want to waste it.  I also added the spinach and mixed up really well.  I put the mixture in a 13x9 pan and sprinkled the rest of the cheese on top.  It was fabulous. I received rave reviews from all family members. Make sure you season the chicken first. Will make again.

Great pasta recipe specially for us. My wife loves pasta but doesn't car for tomato based sauces. PS: mixing everything in a large bowl first makes this a lot less messy.

I added a little garlic and used chicken that I cooked. Took a little longer than just shredding a ready made rotisserie chicken. Oh, I almost forgot! I used tripasta!

I use diced tomatoes with basil, oregano and garlic.  Also use ground turkey and spice that up a bit.  Always has turned out wonderful!

I don't care for spinach, so I used zucchini as a substitute.  Tasted pretty bland, so out came the spices.  Played around until I felt it was tasty.  Good recipe for last minute, hurry up meal, but don't expect a lot of kudos.  Good because most of ingredients are pantry staples.

Made this and it was okay but I probably won't make it again. Nice recipe to try, but I added fresh garlic and more spices to the recipe, too.

The dish looked great, but it lacked flavor. Next time I would try it with maybe, a rotisserie chicken, or link sausage and more spices, along with a little of the pasta water to loosen.it up a bit

I made this and even added some ; Better than Boullion, little red pepper, & garlic...but was still way to bland. The base of the recipes is great but needs more tweeking. (*More seasonings!).

Very good, but need a few notes to make this easier. 1) Do not drain the tomatoes, you need the moisture; 2) Use a large baking dish : 9x13;  3) Oil the baking dish; 4) Mixing in the baking dish is too messy, use a large mixing bowl then transfer to the baking dish.

Very good! I doubled it for a large family and leftovers. Also my daughter has Celiac disease so I used Barilla gluten free penne pasta and you couldn't tell the difference. Will definitely make again!

The rating is for my modifications.   I boiled fresh chick tenders in salted water with a little cayenne pepper.  I couldn't find the Italian-style DICED tomatoes so I used Italian-style STEWED tomatoes (I chopped them).  I substituted onion and chive cream cheese for the original kind.  We prefer things a bit spicy, so I added some seasonings.. garlic salt, S&P, and reduced-sodium Lawry's seasoned salt along with an extra can of tomatoes (original Rotel) because it seemed a bit dry.  (I may have had a bit too much pasta.)   Also, I didn't add the mozzarella until the last 15 minutes of baking.  I think I will try using fresh spinach next time.   I served this delicious meal-in-itself with hot, crusty French bread.

I'm always looking for delicious recipes using leftover chicken.  This one is a winner!  I used Rotel diced tomatoes with green chilies ..pretty much followed the directions to a "T".  It was better than I expected!   Try it.....you'll like it!

It was surprisingly good, considering that no spices whatsoever were required.  Our 16yo son said it was a definite 5-star rating, though...he loved it!  We had all the ingredients on hand, and even added broccoli to it that we wanted to use up.  It is very versatile and we will make it again -- maybe with some red peppers next time.  We will definitely add seasonings when we make it again.  After reading some of the other reviews, garlic and Italian seasoning are a must.  We encourage you to try it.

Flavors are good but I felt the spinich was too wilted. The recipe also calls for way too much spinich. I only used about 5 oz. I melted the tomatoes and cream cheese together then mixed all the ingredients before transferring to the baking dish because I didn't want clumps of cream cheese.

Quite nice. I did change a bit - sauteed 3 cloves of garlic with the onions.  Left out the chicken for a veg option. Added 4 chopped sundried tomatoes.  Nice comfort food.

Sooo tasty, but putting in oven for 45 minutes burnt the bottom. Next time:20 mins tops. Used chicken from slow cooker that was shred with fork, and added Parmesan cheese before eating. Literally perfect

I used plain diced tomatoes and added a good bit of Italian seasoning. I also used canned spinach instead of frozen, spaghetti for the pasta, and omitted the onion. My family enjoyed it and I'll likely make it again.

The only change I made was that I added cooked bacon.  I thought the recipe was good and can easily be changed to your liking. Next time I make it  I want to add fresh mushrooms. It was a little bland so I think I'll up the seasoning next time too, again that can be tweaked to your liking. It was a good recipe and I will make again.

I made some changes to the recipe; used fresh spinach. After sauteing the onions and garlic, added spinach with some pasta water to wilt it; then added marscapone [it is a splurge, but worth it] and chicken. Would recommend mixing everything in skillet through pasta and then put it in baking dish. Next time will try mixing in 1 cup of the mozzarella before putting into baking dish, sprinkle  with remaining mozzarella and adding some parmasan on top. Definitely use some herbs.

This was great, my 1.5 yr old daughter and hubby loved it!   I added some italian seasoning and garlic salt when I sauteed the onion and also used a 28 oz can (double what the recipe called for) of italian style seasoned tomatoes.  Also used an Italian blend of cheeses instead of mozz.  Excellent!

So easy to make! I used a stored cooked rotisserie chicken added a bit of garlic, Cajun seasoning and basil. Also added  panko bread crumbs to the top and removed the foil for the last 10 mins. My family loved it! Definitely a do over!

Was a winner.  I boiled my chicken first.  I did not use Italian diced tomatoes.  I used diced tomatoes with onion and green pepper.  I used creamed spinach as it added flavor.  I also did not use a whole onion.  I used onion to my taste and added garlic to sautee together.  The amount of penne pasta is correct.  I also cut up my softened cream cheese which made it easier to melt.  Poured the noodles over the cream cheese and mixed.  Added the spinach and onions and mixed.  Added the diced tomatoes and mixed and added the chicken.  As crazy as this sounds, I washed my hands and used my hands to get this good and mixed up.  Served with garlic bread and enough left over to freeze.  Winner in my book!

This is delicious. I used chicken breasts that were roasted in the oven. I did make some changes. I substituted garlic for the onion and I added chopped black olives. The dish was a success and received many compliments. I'll certainly be making it again.

As stated already, needs more seasoning to it. I used a Mediterranean spice mix that I happened to have ~ 1tsp. It's an easy recipe and a good option for when I need to make a quick dinner. Will do again.

Made this for company late last week. It's good at the firs meal, but left-overs aren't as good. Guess the pasta absorbs any liquid after sitting in the fridge making the dish very dry.

It was okay for me but my husband liked it.  I didn't use Italian tomatoes because of the salt content--used regular diced.  I added seasonings to make up for the lack of "Italian".  Didn't have much taste.  Next time, I will use the Italian tomatoes. (I ended up adding lots of salt to add more taste.)

It was quite bland and seriously needs some help in the flavor dept. IF  I were to ever make it again I would trying adding some garlic and italian seasoning.  It is certainly a pretty and colorful dish along with being very easy, it just simply lacks flavor.

I took Amber's suggestion and sautéed  garlic with the onion then added the chicken to cook  it along with some basil and Italian seasoning.  I added the tomatoes and cream cheese which I cut up to help it melt.  I added the pasta last and baked as directed.  It was delicious and easy.  I will be making it again.
