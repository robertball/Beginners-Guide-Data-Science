O-MY-GOSH ... these muffin are so... delicious ! I made exactly to the recipe and it made 20  perfect size muffins , took 20 min in oven ( was a bit skeptical of the 17 min to begin with )  I agree with the other reviews to add the raisins , even tho not such a huge fan of them , they added a nice sweet flavor that it needed , I also did handful of walnuts .  I started out with cutting a muffin in 1/4's just to taste one and ended up eating the whole thing ! LOL ~

i made some changes to this recipe and it came out amazing!

2 and 1/2 cups flour
1 cup quick oats
1/2 cup brown sugar + 1/2 cup white sugar
one large zucchini + one rounded cup of matchstick carrots, blended to a puree in a blender with 1/2 - 3/4 cup of water 
I used 4 tsp of club house pumpkin pie spice blend instead of the separate spices

I did not add nuts or raisins.
Everything else was measured the same as original recipe.

all i can say is... A-MAZING! and so moist! definitely a keeper!

I needed to use up zucchini and carrots in my fridge and wanted to make them into something my three-year-old would eat. This was perfect. Itâ€™s not a very sweet muffin so it definitely needed the raisins. I omitted the walnuts and sprinkled  sugar on the tops before they went in the Oven. This made 21 muffins.

8.5.18 Pretty tasty muffins.  Would recommend not omitting the optional raisins and walnuts because the raisins add sweetness and the walnuts some crunch.  Texture was firm, but moist and tender. Scaled the recipe in half and ended up with 10 smaller-size muffins.  sassybyheather, thanks for sharing your recipe.
