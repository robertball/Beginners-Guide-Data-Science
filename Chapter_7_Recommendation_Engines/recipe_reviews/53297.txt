This was delicious!  

I followed the other user's advice and cut back on the milk (only 3/4 c) and the crust was PERFECT.  Just cakey enough for me.  

I also made some other changes and thought they were good.  

For the berry mixture I only used 1/2 t cinnamon and 1/4 c butter (1/2 stick).

For the crust I only used 3/4 c milk and 3/4 c sugar instead of the 1 c the recipe called for.  

I thought it was great and so did the whole family!  

We're looking forward to making it again with some berry alterations (adding blueberries or strawberries.  Great Cobbler Recipe!!  Thanks!

I made several changes to this recipe, first I added brown sugar to the fruit mix instead of white sugar, I enjoyed the deeper flavor of the brown sugar more than I would have the white sugar.  I cut back on the butter in the dough - will not do that again found the dough to come out a bit hard.

This recipe is really easy and really good. We even used Splenda (something I've never done) instead of sugar and it is still great!

Way too much liquid.  Between the melted butter and the milk it was very moist, almost to the point of being gooey.  The taste was excellent- but I will cut back on the milk and butter if I make it again.

VERY EASY to make and the final product tasted delicious.  I altered the recipe slightly by adding more berries (blueberry & blackberry) since I didn't have enough peaches handy.  I also reduced the amount of sugar in the batter to 3/4 cup.  I reduced the butter to 6 TBS instead of 8 TBS (1/2 c.).

This was delicious but needed some alterations.  I used brown sugar for the fruit mix, only 3/4 cup milk, and 2 less tablespoons of butter.  I also used blueberries because I had no raspberries on hand.  The edges had a nice crispy crust texture and the middle was gooey but I think it would be too gooey if you followed the recipe exactly.  Next time I will make 1 1/2 recipes for the dough (thought it needed more) but keep the rest the same.  I was hoping it would look more like "Sumchelle's" photo.  Will try this again though.

So good! Perfect cobbler taste and texture.  I didn't have raspberries, so I stirred in a little raspberry jam. Yumm!

The cobbler came out good, but not "to die for," If you half the recipe, be careful not to add a full cup of sugar as indicated in the text--only 1/2 cup is needed.

It was great with a few modifications...I used brown sugar in the fruit mix and only 3/4 cup of vanilla soymilk for the batter...it made it a thicker batter so when it cooked it was PERFECT! I hate when cobbler is doughy! I saw that some people cut back on their margarine but I left mine the same....1/2 cup. It looks like a lot until it bakes...it will cook into the dough. If you cut too much out, your crust will be too dry and hard. Serve this warm with vanilla icecream over the top and it is heavenly! Happy cooking and baking everyone! :)

I am an avid baker and have been for quite some time. I am rating this recipe two stars because I followed the directions and ingredients to a "T". My mistake is that I should have listened to my instincts when it came to the Baking Powder. I thought Two Tablespoons would be too much. It was. Sorry I could not have rated it better, I am entertaining the thought of trying the recipe again with TWO teaspoons of Baking Powder, or, looking for another recipe.

Made this last night and thought it was quite good. (Better than a cherry version from another recipe that I made this summer.) Our guests arrived 30 minutes early and I literally threw this together in about 8 minutes. Next time it will look prettier, but as it was, for the quick prep time, the end result is definitely enjoyable. No substitutions made, but will probably add blueberries next time.

This was really yummy!  We did cook it in a dutch oven, used less butter and just pre-made a cake mix instead of making homemade (though I love the homemade much more, we were just rushed!)  I would definitely add more peaches and raspberries to make it more fruity!

Was ok- it did seem a little flavourless- I used refridgerator buscuits and that was great. I think I just would rather have plain jane peach cobbler. But thats just my opinion.

This was absolutely delicious. Almost too rich; I used only 3/4 cup of sugar for the batter.  Also, used about half the amount of baking powder to avoid spilling over. Used 3/4 cup milk because the batter was pretty liquidy at that point.  After the butter was melted along the bottom of the dish, I poured most of the excess out.

This is really a good recipe.  I made it with the preteen girls and they enjoyed using this recipe for their fresh picked wild blackberries.  It is very easy. We did cut down the sugar by half because I like the flavor of the fruit better, but it really could have used more sugar.  Thanks for submitting!

The cobbler is perfect even prepared in a metal pan.  Had to use this because our Anchor Hocking glass pan, shattered in the oven, while we were melting the butter!  The only suggestion that we would have is to add more fruit to the recipe. Will enjoy this again!

I LOVED this recipe! I only gave it 4 stars because I followed the other reviewers advice by only using 3/4 cup of milk and I substitued 1 cup of sugar with 1/2 cup of white and 1/2 cup of brown. I also added a little more cinnamon, personal preferance, and finally I used fresh blueberries. This cobble was a big hit at a family party and I enjoyed it!

It is wonderful!  I was short on Peaches so I put in peeled plums and I didn't have Raspberries so I put in frozen (I thawed) Raspberries, blueberries and blackberries mix.  
I loved the way the flour mixture came up and over the top of the berries.  If I was to change anything I might check my fruit mixture and add a little more sugar.  I think my berries were a little to tart.  

But...Great recipe.  Will use it again.

So easy to make.  I did cut down on the milk to 3/4 cup but I have made it with the full cup and not too much difference. This is a southern staple.

This is now the only way I will ever think of preparing peach cobbler again! The only difference in my preparation was that I baked it using apple wood in my smoker. It was absolutely heavenly. Thank you so much for this fantastic recipe!

Easy and excellent recipe! I followed the recipe, the only change I made was to use brown sugar instead of white sugar. It came out a perfect cobbler. I will say this: Be sure to melt the butter in the pan, in the oven. Adding the batter to the hot butter and hot pan made the batter start to cook early on. Almost immediately, as a matter of fact.

So this cobbler is in the oven right now and i'm just so excited. I blanched the peaches before peeling and then slicing. just kinda estimated with a measuring cup mixing the peaches with raspberries and blueberries. (I thought the blueberries looked really nice in all of the pictures so i added them) I actually used fresh peaches and frozen raspberries and blueberries just letting them thaw on their own in a bowl. The batter for the cobbler part is SO good just as batter i wanted to eat it right then and there. I put a little less baking powder because my mom and i don't care too much for the taste. used brown sugar for the fruit mixture and half brown and white sugar for the batter. DON'T use more than 3/4 cups of milk that's all it needed to be evenly moist. it looks BEAUTIFUL! and I'm so excited! will update on taste!  EDIT-- SOOOO GOOD! my mom said it just got better with every bite. I topped each slice with homemade whipped cream and sprinkled a tiny bit of nutmeg and cinnamon over it for looks. Amazing! definitely will make again!

The fruit combination was great, but this time I finally realized I am not a cobbler lover.  The dough is too salty, soft, and bland for my tastes.  Peach raspberry crisp is the way to go.

this recipe was ok, but next time I'm going to put the fruit on the bottom and then the cake on top...when I put the fruit in gollops on top, it just went directly to the centre...and we like an even amount of fruit tasts...but will try again, so rating may change!

Sweet & Tart!  Only had two peaches, so I sliced them (leaving the "skin" on), added more rasp, black, blue & strawberries.  Followed Jason's advice and used BROWN sugar for the fruit mix.  For the crust, I cut sugar to 3/4 cup and just a hair short of a cup for the milk.  I will admit, I was sketchy about the stick o' butter in the pan, but the fret was for nothing.  Baked up beautifully and extra tasty!

This was delicious, and I am not a big dessert person. I blanched the peaches in boiling water for 30 seconds and then plunged in cold water to get the skins off the them. I also halved the recipe and used an 8x8 glass dish. Worked great and this was quick and easy to make.

No changes, I did it just like the recipe. We loved it. Next time, I want to try blueberries in place of the raspberries.

I used a gluten free flour blend in the same proportion and it worked out just fine. I also followed someone else's suggestion of using brown sugar instead of white on the peaches which gave it a nice flavor. Easy to make. Definitely a keeper.

I also followed this recipe to a T.   There was way too much baking powder. i am thinking this was a typo? my one son also hated it.  My husband and older son did not notice anything....could different people be more tolerant of the metallic taste?
