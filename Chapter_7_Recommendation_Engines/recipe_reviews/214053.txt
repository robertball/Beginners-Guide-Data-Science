Very good! I added a little cumin and garlic powder and just garnished with the black olives instead of mixing them in. My husband ate them up! Thanks :)

I think these are nice change of side. I had to add more cayenne and chilli powder I also added some garlic salt. Overall pretty good.

I brought these along to a mexican themed dinner at a friend's house. Everyone loved them! In fact they were requested again. Nice twist on an old favorite.

I found the filling to be too runny to stuff into the eggs, despite using 8 egg yolks instead of 6.  I used a vegan soy mayonnaise substitute, which might have been the difference.  NOW--here's what to do with the extra filling:  Add the rest of the canned (4 oz) green chilies, the rest of the (4 oz) can of sliced olives, a can of whole kernel corn (drained), two or three sliced green onions, a quarter of a red bell pepper (diced), and a good grinding of black pepper, to make a nice corn relish/corn salad.  These two recipes would be perfect to take to a picnic--you get credit for two dishes, but really only had to do one and a half!

Very good!  I quartered them and piped with a bag.  They were a hit with the little kids and at a taco themed luncheon.  I was very pleased that quartering worked!  I will do that from now on.

These were good, but I was hoping for a more Mexican-y flavor. I added some salt and pepper and garnished them w/ black olives and an extra sprinkling of chili powder. I may try to play around w/ the flavors more b/c I think there is potential here. Thanks for sharing. :)
