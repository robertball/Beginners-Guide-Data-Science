Wow! So good. I cut the eggplant in half lenthwise and baked them on a cookie sheet at 450 for about 25-30 minutes. Then followed the recipe from there. Delicious!

Take it from a Lebanese. The recipe deserves a 5 stars if you remove the yogurt and the cayenne. I don’t like it when people doctors a perfect recipe. We invented the humus and baba ghannouge. I understand people like to put their own twist on recipes but the baba ghannouge should be left alone because it’s perfect.

Mine came out just like Chef John's photo. The Greek yogurt really makes that flavor I am accustomed to in Baba Ghanoush. Not every mid-eastern restaurant does it this way, and it is sometimes too tart and sour. This is PERFECT! I only want to add that you should add tahini and the lemon juice a bit at a time for your personal taste.

I've made this recipe twice, and my husband loves  it. The first time I followed the recipe exactly, and the baba ghanoush was delicious.  The second time I was bold and made several recipe modifications with equally good results. Instead of two minced cloves of garlic, I used half a dozen cloves of roasted garlic. As I found I didn't have any plain greek yogurt, I substituted Mexican crema. I also added maybe 1/2 t. of cumin.

Fantastic as-is!  My eggplants were small, though, so I didn't get much dip and had to adjust the other ingredients. In the future, I'll make a lot more.  I roasted the eggplants in the oven - 45 min, 400F.

I stuffed around 6 cloves of garlic into the knife slits I made in the eggplant.  OMGoodness, what a great addition to an already great recipe.

This was fantastic! I was skeptical at firest as I don’t have a lot of experience with eggplant recipes. The only changes I made were to add a lot more garlic, some seasonings when blending, some spicy seasoning mix. Made it the day prior to our party and on day of drizzled olive oil on top and added fresh chopped parsley. Can’t wait to make it again when my eggplants get big enough, may add some toasted garlic to the top when surved.

It was excellent. I don't really care for smoky eggplant so I made the eggplants roasted in the oven instead, then followed directions.
Really great taste!

Served at a bring-a-dish holiday gathering. Specifically made this for vegan friends, and as expected, had limited demand when omnivores have an array of other meat dishes from which to choose. Made as written other than making it a day ahead, and the flavors developed more fully after being refrigerated overnight. Used a Big Green Egg to smoke the eggplants.

This was fantastic. My first time having Baba ghanouj but I trust Chef John so I knew it would be good. The difficulty is that I did them on a pellet grill for the eggplant and it ended up really charring the outside. The flavor was good but I had to just be careful to not get charred flakes into the eggplant when I scraped it out. Who knew you could tell the difference between male and female eggplants? Loved going to the store and asking them for male eggplants. Ha ha ha.  Didn’t change a thing in the recipe and I served this with naan as a side to chicken schwarma.

DELICIOUS! I was disappointed that I had to use dried parsley instead of fresh... but we couldn’t tell the difference. Superb! I love Chef John, and this is only one example! Thank you, Chef John!

I didn't know what it was until I made it. Fantastic flavor. Better than hummus. Smokiness from the grilled eggplant really made it nice.
