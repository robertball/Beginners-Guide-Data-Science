Who doesn't love super simple and super quick on a busy weeknight? Use any size shrimp you want. I prefer larger shrimp and that is what I had and this recipe worked just fine. I added some sweet paprika for color and that was a nice touch.  You really can't go wrong with this recipe.

Good as written. But, do your heart a favor and use olive oil instead of butter. Do your taste buds a favor and chop up some real garlic, instead of using garlic salt, by all means use real lemon juice, but you can use other herbs to season and avoid salt altogether and your blood pressure will thank you. Oh, and so the shrimp don't get lonely, give yourself a break and make up a box of Zatarain's Yellow Rice to serve with the shrimp. This is my favorite dish of all time. Fairly quick and easy.

My husband and I both loved it. It was a quick and easy recipe that we will definitely be having again....soon. My only additions were  mushrooms and serving on ramen noodles. Thank you for sharing your recipe with us.

This was tasty. I added real garlic, grated zucchini and smoked sun dried tomatoes. I served it over pasta for a very satisfying dinner

Made it for a salad, was very easy and very good.  Could add other seasoning, but like the simple taste of garlic and butter
