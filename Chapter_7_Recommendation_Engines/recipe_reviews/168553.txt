Great Pie!  I will confess I used a prepared crust (GASP!)  I know, I know.  But I haven't mastered crusts yet.  I'm actually glad I did because this is quite a heavy pie.  The filling was creamy and YUM-MY! (My advice to those whose didn't set right - You need to cook the filling until it is THICK!  Not just thickened, THICK!  We're talkin' wallpaper paste people.  Cook it over Medium to Medium-High Heat and Constantly Stir.)

Anywho, I also threw the Strawberries in a bowl with about a cup of Sugar and chilled for about an hour (or until they get juicy) I used the Strawberries in the pie and used the juice to make whipped cream to top off the pie.  Spectacular!

I think next time, because the filling is so heavy, I'll make smaller Tarts instead of a whole pie.

This was delicious! The sauce on top is very yummy, and the fresh strawberries are the best part. the crust was great too. the only problem is that it gets old quite fast because of the fresh strawberries, so must be eaten in probably 2 days.

The recipe did not set up like it should have I think that it should have had egg whites instead of egg yocks. The recipe was delicious even though the pie was just a iquid with strawberries. The pie crust was scrumsious and very easy!!

One of the best pies I have ever made. The pudding was so creamy and flavorful. Everyone said it was a keeper recipe and I will try it with bananas next.

I thought this recipe was excellent.  The crust was different for me & I will probably use it for other pies as well.  I think it would make a good peach pie???The filling/pudding was excellent as well.  The addition of sour cream made it a little different but not quite like a cheesecake filling.  I think the quantity of crust ingredients would be used easily in a 7X11 pan or slighty larger.  I didn't have my crust the same thickness all over so it was a little thick in places.  Thanks for the recipe.

Simply awesome...rock on!!
This is absolutely scrumptious and no changes or substitutions were done on the recipe.
For those who had runny pie I am wondering if you cooked the custard long enough or maybe you used frozen strawberries?  I made mine with fresh and watched the clock when cooking and it set up perfectly.
Thank you for the recipe, it is a keeper!

It looked great when it went into the fridge.  I let is "set" overnight and it was complete soup.  I, too, had some issues making the crust even ~ though it tasted great.

very tasty indeed, but mine didn't set up either -- I plan to try it with egg whites instead as maddie03 suggested

I think the title represents the pie incorrectly. This is a CUSTARD pie! There is nothing cream like. However, I love custard and I love strawberries. I thought the pie was interesting and had great flavor and the crust was great! I will definately make again, but only when I know the peeps I'm cooking for enjoy CUSTARD! You really have to like custard to enjoy this pie.

This pie tasted good but wasn't quite what I thought it was going to be. I was expecting the cream to be a light, fluffy cream, but it was more like cheesecake- a thick custard.

Excellent dessert.Turned out great. Those who are having problems with it setting up just have to make sure they cook it to the proper consistency. I substituted canned strawberry pie filling for the fresh ones and it was still delicious.

I use instant vanilla Jello pudding mix, mixed per directions then add sour cream and top off the strawberries. I also  use cream cheese mixed with cool whip and white sugar to top off strawberries or chocolate pie mix.

Excellent recipe. No problem with the thickening issue turned out perfect.  I made mine into a raspberry cream pie and will next time half it and add more fruit and put it on top.  I am so glad I finally found a cream pie!
