I agree with other users.  This recipe required some "tweaking". First off it should be 3 tsp of cinnamon, As well I added an additional 1 1/2 cups of water and cooked the apples in the syrup mixture.  It was still a little on the thick side but overall not too bad.

I'm not above admitting I did something wrong, but I really had to play with the amounts in this recipe.  the cinnamon is very strong and the mixture got extremely thick before it got anywhere close to clear.  I had to add extra water to thin it out.  I haven't put it in a pie but have tasted it.  It is ok but has too much cinnamon for my liking.

I have never rated a recipe but this was just awful...  TOO much cinnamon (and I used less) and how could a mixture with that much cinnamon be 'clear'? The whole mess was just a waste of time and ingredients,should have read the reviews first!

I was in a hurry & didn't take the time to read the reviews until after I made this.  I had doubled the recipe and used brown sugar instead of white.  I put most of it in the freezer, but left one to make up in an apple crisp the next day. I didn't find anything wrong with this recipe and my husband loved the apple crisp.  I greased a 9x9 pan, put my filling in and topped with a mixture of 1 cup flour, 1 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup margarine, baked at 350 for about 25 minutes.  It was delicious.  Not sure what all the bad reviews are about, my bunch loved it!

I didn't read the directions before so I didn't cook anything I just added everything but the nutmeg and cornstarch. I have green apples from my tree and they needed to be super sweet for my easy as pie apple muffins anyways. I thought it was great. I like to add things or take things out to make it my own recipe but I'm very happy I found this recipe.

I liked this filling.  It never did become clear and I maybe put 2tsp of cinnomen in.  I really like teh maple flavoring and how thick the filling is.

This pie had very little flavor.  My husband said it tasted like nothing.  I am not a good enough cook to be at the recipe tweaking stage just yet...which is why I rely heavily on this website.  My mistake was not reading the reviews before making this dessert.  ...Sorry, to have to be so critical.

I decided to change it and put it in the Moen Recipe Book, It makes it all that much better.

After reading the other reviews, I tried this with the following alterations and it got rave reviews with my family and our guests. And our version has NO SUGAR. Changed water to apple juice and reduced to 1 Cup, reduced corn starch to 1/3 Cup, and left out sugar completely. Reduced cinnamon to 2 tsp. It was perfect.  We diced our apples to use in mini-pies, and refrigerated overnight before using, don't know if that would made a difference. This will be a keeper as I have had trouble finding an apple pie recipe we love.

I used Honey Crisp apples from my yard. I think the ratio of apples to matrix is too low. After all, isn’t “apples” is what it’s all about?! I microwaved more apples and added them to the mix. Now I just have to make a pie and see how it worked. BTW, I thought the cinnamon amount was ok although I saw some criticism. I also added a little brown sugar as the honey and maple syrup wasn’t quite enough sweetening for me ( I actually I like less sweet).

With a little tweaking, this is one of the best apple pies you will ever have!
I had 10 small Spartan apples that I used, they weighed 2.8 lbs, I reduced the cornstarch to 3 tbsps (1 tbsp of cornstarch to 1 cup of water is the normal ratio, I doubled to make sure it would set) also reduced the cinnamon and nutmeg to 1 tbsp Apple Pie Spice.
When the mixture starts to thicken it will darken really fast, do not be alarmed! remove from the heat, add the apples, then put back on the heat on low to soften the apples.
This tastes and smells awesome! I could have eaten the whole pot with a spoon. Next time though I would reduce the water to 1 cup and the cornstarch to 2 tbsps as I just like a higher apple to sauce ratio.
I used Buttery Flaky Pie Crust from this site as it is my favourite, the pie baked at 425 for 40 minutes. I had enough filling leftoveer to make a large turnover with another crust as well.
Place foil or a cookie sheet under the pie when baking as it tends to drip a bit.
