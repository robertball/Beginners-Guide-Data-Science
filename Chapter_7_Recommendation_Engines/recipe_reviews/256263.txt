TI enjoyed this recipe very much. It's one of those kinds you have to eat right away though because it doesn't sit well for very long at all. On that note I loved the flavor of the sauce but was disappointed at how quickly it made my crispy shrimp soggy. Next time I will just dip the shrimp instead of pouring it over. Great flavor though and one worth making!
