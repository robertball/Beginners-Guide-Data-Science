I lived in Kenya for 4 years and with a few small changes this was almost perfect! Omit the mushrooms, use chunky salsa for 1 of the cans of diced tomatoes, add fresh crushed peanuts after it is done, and use chicken broth not veggy broth.  Also, spice the chicken (while browning) with garlic - fresh is the best!

Exceptionally chic and delicious! My boyfriend and I loved it and I brought it to a party and received the best comments by everyone. I added some sesame seed oil, fresh cilantro, shredded carrots, a sweet potato, and since I like things spicy I added a small jar of spicy salsa, finely chopped hot pepper, and used spicy olive oil. Since I added more I added more broth and used chicken broth instead. I used basmati rice and smooth peanut butter. I also topped it with sour cream and some cilantro. This soup is extraordinary full of flavour and I will make it over and over again. Try it-youâ€™ll like it!

I thought this was rather tasty. I cut the recipe in half, as there were only 2 people going to be eating it! On a whim, I added 1/4 tsp. of chili powder instead of the 1/8 it would have called for, and I did closer to a half cup of peanut butter. The extra chili powder was excellent. The extra peanut butter was ok, but what it calls for would be fine too. The only complaint I have is that I need about double the time to get the rice cooked-- 15 minutes wasn't nearly enough time. I will still make this again.

Yummy, and easy to make. I love the peanut butter and red bell peppers together. Things I did differently or that weren't specified: I used Jif Extra Crunchy peanut butter because it was the only extra crunchy one I could find in the supermarket. I was afraid it would be too sweet (I usually buy natural nut butters), but it was fine. I might add a pinch more chili powder next time. Since I was using brown rice that normally takes 45-50 minutes to cook, I cooked it for about 30 before tossing it into the soup. Next time, I will probably up the rice to at least 3/4 cup, if not a cup. I did add the sour cream, but it is delicious when served alone, too.

Delicious.
Using a NATURAL peanut butter is a must for this recipe... natural has a more peanutty flavor suited better to this recipe.
I used vegetable broth.

I did make a few changes. I added a chopped jalepeno with the peppers; used tricolored peppers... mine turned out a little paler than the photo-- not the prettiest color, so I added a little bit of tomato sauce to darken it-- which I found improved the flavor.

Even brought some to a friend from Ghana-- she thought this was tasty and very authentic (although she is used to creamy peanut butter herself.)

Edit:  Wanted to add that this is probably something you'll either love or hate. Very distinct flavor.

The five-star rating is for the inspiration.  I'd never have thought of making this had I not come across this recipe.  However, like many, I did make my own changes to give it more flavor. I added cinnamon, cloves, and crushed red pepper and increased the chili powder significantly.  I also doubled the garlic just because I felt like it and added thinly sliced zucchini for more bulk.  I found that the soup was very versatile and handled the changes and additions very well. Have fun with this recipe and make it your own.  Oh, and the flavors definitely do get more intense with time.  Lovely!

Wow -- this was my favorite new recipe I have tried recently. Both my husband and I loved it! I added the rice earlier and cooked it longer afterwards.

This soup was delicious.  I personally liked the crunchy peanuts, but my fiance didn't, so next time I will use creamy peanut butter.  I added one cubed sweet potato in the 30 minute simmer stage, and I also used 10 minute brown rice to cut down on cooking time.  It turned out wonderfully!

As good as expected. I agree with others that spices can -- and should -- be increased. Certainly twice the chili powder, and a little cinnamon and/or cumin would be good too. I used various coloured bell peppers, all natural peanut butter, and white rice to cut down on the cooking time. Delicious. I bet it would be great with cilantro on top!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe. I made it three times within the first week I discovered it, and it's always a crowd pleaser. It's unfamiliar and savory. 

Like many others, I also substituted chunky salsa for the tomatoes. I use chicken broth instead of the veggie stock, and I also saute the garlic from the get-go with my onions and peppers. I also add an uncooked chicken breast after it's been simmering about 20 minutes. After it's cooked I take it out and shred it before adding it back to the pot. I've used white rice, as opposed to brown. When I add the rice, I also add a peeled/chopped potato, making it extra hearty. 

For the peanut butter I've used Jif extra crunchy. I've noticed a lot of people concerned about the sweetness in processed vs. natural, but I think it's a good flavor. You honestly don't even taste the peanut butter if you measure it right. The peanuts add extra bulk to the stew, while giving it a nice creamy consistency. 
Served with sour cream to cut the spiciness (Everyone else likes spicy, but I don't so much). 

I HIGHLY recommend this recipe. Give it a shot.

OMG! This soup was delicious. Who knew that tomato, red pepper, and peanut butter was such a wonderful combination?! I made it almost exactly as indicated except I made only half a recipe as I only had one red pepper on hand, I doubled the chilli powder as other reviewers had suggested, and I put the rice in with the crushed tomatoes and broth as it takes 30-40 minutes to cook brown rice.

I really enjoyed this soup.  I doubled the amount of rice, precooked it,  I added it cooked and let is simmer for 20 min at the end. I also added diced cooked chicken, it was thicker like a gumbo. I also used chunky jif pb, doubled the chili powder and used chicken stock instead of veg, since its all I had.   I will definately make this again.

This is a new favorite in my household and by everyone we've asked to try it. My hubby has to have meat so I also add two seasoned, shredded chicken breasts. I upped the rice the second time we had this to 1 3/4 cups. I've added shredded carrots and this time am adding sweet potato. I also have been using chicken stock and took others suggestions and used salsa instead of tomatoes, which hubby is not a fan of. I also upped the peanut butter. We top it with cilantro and lime juice. Its actually pretty similar to pad thai, but in a soup. We LOVE this!

The best darn soup I've had in a long time!  I used quinoa instead of rice.  I used frozen tri-color bell peppers.  I added a shredded carrot and little extra peanut butter . Super Yum!

I ate a bowl of this right after cooking it and thought that it was just okay and may or may not have made it again.  I didn't eat any of the leftovers until a couple of days later, and (like soup tends to be) it was WAY better than the first bowl I ate.  I will defintely make it again, and I think that I will try adding chicken as many other reviewers have suggested. Oddly enough, I am not a fan of most of the vegetables in this soup, but I loved it anyway.

I crave this soup.  Since it's so hearty it makes for a great meal or lunch, especially in the winter.  I tend to add the peanut butter to taste, which is a little more than what the recipe calls for.  A dollop of sour cream on top is delicious.

Pretty good as written, the only thing I'll be doing next time is increasing the spices or taking Liz E.'s suggestion and using salsa in the place of the chopped tomatoes.  As written it was very nice but a bit bland for my tastes.  The tomato/peanut butter combination isn't for everyone, but I really enjoyed it so I'm sure I'll be making it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I am giving it 5 because I am sure it is pretty good on it's own.  However I did combine it with another recipe, the Peanut Butter Vegetable Chicken Soup because I wanted the chicken and the extra veggies.  The two together were awesome!  I don't know about authentic but what I do know is we loved it!

Delicious!  I made it twice.  The first time, I followed the recipe as-is (except I used white rice) and it turned out good but bit bland.  The second time, I used some reviewers' suggestions.  First, I used a jar of spicy salsa instead of crushed tomatoes.  The extra spice in the soup is excellent.  I also added cumin and a bit more garlic.  I used crunchy natural peanut butter, but also added some crushed peanuts at the very end.  The first time I made it, I used white rice.  But I liked it better with the brown rice, so I'd suggest definitely sticking to that ingredient.  This recipe is perfect because you can tweak it if you want, or eat it as is-either way, it's wonderful, healthy, and hearty.

This recipe was lackluster for me. Even though I used correct measurements on everything, was soup was much more red than the reference photo. The taste was somewhat bland and both my boyfriend and I found it to be be missing something (I thought more spice). I am not sure I will eat this pot, but I may try again with some spicy peppers and chicken in it.

I'll admit, some people were put off by the description of this dish but they are the ones who missed out. I made this for a get together and it was a hit!

We really enjoyed this soup. I did add some cayenne powder, cumin, and crushed red pepper. Used sesame oil along with olive oil for sauteing. Loved the crunchy p-nut butter in it. Definitely add salt. Did use one 14/15 oz. can of crushed tomatoes and one can of Rotel with green chiles. Also used chicken broth in place of vege broth. This may seem like a lot of changes for a five star recipe. But they were changes made to my taste. It had nothing to do with the original recipe. I often, if not always will add a little extra here, or less there to most of my recipes, as I'm sure most of you do. The salt was the only thing, in my opinion, that should have been in the original  recipe. But this comes from someone who nearly always has to add extra salt. Anywho, give it a try. It really is a unique and delicious recipe that my whole family loved.

There is nobody more surprised than me that this stuff rocked.  I make it for my African co-worker and he was thrilled.  He said it was very authentic and delicious.  I now find myself putting peanut butter in other soup recipes!

This soup was good. It was something different which is really nice. I feel like it's missing something, but I couldn't tell you what. Overall, it's a nice change and tastes quite good. It has a rich flavour which my boyfriend and I both liked.

I have made this soup for the last several years. It is excellent. There are so many variations. I usually spice it up with a dose of curry and/or jalopenos. Sometimes I serve shreddeed chicken on the side for the non-vegetarians. I always use veggie stock. I cook the rice first. Everybody loves this soup. Everybody. I add a sweet potato or two. Squash if I have it. Pumpkin good too. Apples. You can't go wrong. Just play. It is peanuts after all.

The idea of peanut soup may seem odd to many Americans, but this is fantastic!  Everyone that I've gotten to try it, has become hooked on it.  Everyone is always asking when I'll make it again, just so they have a chance at getting some.

This was pretty good, but i think the peanut butter almost kind of ruined it. The soup before i added the peanut butter was delicious....next time I will use less than half the peanut butter.

I found this recipe (or a variation) on another site, and its ingenuity and versatility are what struck me most.  It is completely versatile as long as you have rice, peanuts or peanut butter, tomatoes (canned, fresh, salsa...whatever), and some kinds of vegetables.  I highly recommend using the onion/garlic, but the proportions aren't crucial.  Other than that, what you add is up to you: bell peppers, hot peppers, mushrooms, potato, squash, carrots, celery, brocolli would all work.  If you don't have vegetable or chicken broth, water and some (optional) salt does just fine.  Chili powder is not necessary, and as others have said, various spcie combinations all work.  If you're not comfortable making changes, the recipe as written is good, but might get boring ;-) Tip: base the cook time after adding the rice on the simmer time provided on the rice package directions.

this soup is great as is, but I made it a second time and think these improvements are good enough to share. Decreased the liquid by half, doubled the peanut butter, added cumin, added 3 baked yams and used my soup emusifier on the yams and 1/2 of the soup. then added it all together with a lb of cooked diced chicken, and served with rice on the side (not in it) and allowed guests to portion out each.

I made this for the first time recently. I did not put in the red peppers because I didn't have any on hand. I followed the recipe precisely after that, until the end when I thickened it with a tad bit of cornstarch. The hubby doesn't like super thin broth soups, so to get him to eat it, measures had to be taken.   The taste was great. The husband loved it. Since it was only the two of us we had it for three days, and it was eaten all up. I'll be making this again soon.

I was a little apprehensive about putting peanut butter in a soup, but we overall enjoyed this. Try using smooth peanut butter, it's just as good.

My soup for the coming week. As usual, the recipe didn't escape tweaks. Doubled the called-for spices, added a quarter-teaspoon of cumin and a healthy pinch of cayenne. Substituted stewed tomatoes for the called-for crushed ('cause that's what I had; probably changed the flavor profile a bit) and cobbled together the chicken broth out of two cans and the drippings from supermarket rotisserie chickens. Looks to be a winner.

This was quite good! I wanted to add some texture and fiber, so I added a can of garbanzo beans, a few stalks of celery, and a diced sweet potato. I used brown basmati rice, added with the second step, and cooked it for about 40 minutes. I had exactly 1 cup of rice left, so that's how much I added. I think the extra rice was a good thing, but I did end up having to add a little water before serving because it had thickened up considerably. I also doubled the chili powder and added 1/2 t cumin. Thank you for sharing!

I am in love with this soup. It's hearty, delicious and unique. I was introduced to it by a friend who followed the recipe exactly and I knew I wanted to make it myself. In terms of modifying the recipe, I used vegetable broth, added some chicken breast, increased the peanut butter (about 1 cup of the natural stuff) and threw in a bit of spice (chili pepper olive oil) and it was just as delicious if not a bit more hearty and, well, spicy. My BF loved it as well and suggested using more tomatoes so I will be trying that for next time. For anyone who is skeptical, give it a go... it's a soup you can modify to your own tastes and it still retains it's own well-balanced character. As for me, I will be making this soup for many years to come... thanks for the recipe to others for their suggestions!

I thought it was really good but a bit bland. I halved the recipe and at the end added 1 tsp soy sauce, 1 tsp chipolte hot sauce and some chopped cilantro and that made it spectacular!!  For lunch tomorrow I think I will also add some leftover chicken breast to make a real a full meal

Great soup! Changes: Doubled spices and rice.  Added rice with the tomatoes to allow for the longer cooking of brown rice. added 1/4 cup of salsa & crushed peanuts. Topped with juice from 1/4 lime, sour cream and cilantro.  Served with baguettes.  Really, really tasty!

I loved this! :) Absolutely divine. I increased the amount of brown rice to 1 cup, used half salsa, half crushed tomatoes, and threw in some zucchini because I felt like it needed something. :) Fantastic!

My husband is African and makes this often. Although the recipe varies, the consistency is more thick and uses it to serve over rice. Very delicious!

Wow!  this was delicious!  My picky husband and 9 year old daughter loved it too.  We weren't sure about it at first...peanut soup and all, but it was great and I'm going to make it again.  I used Red Rice instead of brown and liked the chewy texture it added.  For the peanut butter, I used Earth Balance with flaxseed, so we got some Omega 3's added.  We are new vegans and this satisfied us all!  Thanks for sharing :o).

Yum!  I'm giving this four stars for how it's written, and five stars with how I prepared it.  I halved the recipe, but still used a full 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes.  I also added about 2/3 of a big jar of Pace Picante - Hot and a handful of chopped cilantro.    I added about 3/8 c of rice instead of just 1/4.  And I probably added more peanut butter - I just globbed it in.  The result was a thick & spicy soup.    Yummm...  Will definitely make this again!  I might try adding some shredded chicken and coconut milk to make it different, but it was definitely great the way I made it this time!

Ridiculously good.  The vegetarian I had over thought she had died and gone to heaven.  I did make it a bit heartier by borrowing from another African peanut soup recipe; I added 1 yam, 1 drained can of black beans, and 1 jalepeno.  I really liked the brown rice in this recipe and the texture it gave.

This was really good. My fiance didn't like the crunchy peanuts so I'm going to try it with creamy peanut butter next time. I followed it exactly and like the others, the rice take around 55 minutes before it's soft.

In making it the first time, I cut the recipe in half and used a 14.5 oz. can of crushed tomatoes and a 1/2 cup of extra crunchy peanut butter.  Also added a finely diced celery stalk to the onions and red pepper and one mashed sweet potato after the vegetable stock.  May pre-cook the rice next time as it took longer than 15 minutes to become tender.  Wonderful, hearty and very tasty!  Great Lenten soup for those who follow the Orthodox fasting traditions!

I utilize this site a lot for recipes, but this is my first time reviewing -- that's how awesome this soup is! It was so easy to make, and I froze a portion of it a couple weeks ago and just thawed it out and it's still fantastic! I pretty much followed the recipe except I added like a quarter cup of roasted peanuts in addition to the crunchy peanut butter because I wanted it to be pretty chunky. If you are hesitant because you think this is a strange flavor combo -- just try it, it somehow just works!

This soup was delicious!  Even my brother, who rarely rates food better than "ok," said that this soup is amazing.  I followed the directions exactly, but I ended up simmering the brown rice for about 45 minutes before it was tender.

I've made this a few times now.  If I don't add chicken, I like to double the rice.  I also like a dash of cayenne in addition to the chili powder.  I only use one red pepper to appease my veggie-phobic children.  (I chopped the one up so fine that they didn't know it was there--bwa ha ha!) Great low-cost, high-taste recipe!

This was good! Although it was not followed directly, I think it would have turned out better if I had. I put all ingredients in a slow cooker and it turned out to be a very hearty soup the family enjoyed. I used green peppers instead of red ones because of what was on hand. I it would of been a tad sweeter if I used the red ones. Thanks for sharing.

This was really tasty.  I doubled the chili powder and added some red pepper flakes and some diced hot pepper, and then some cilantro and a squirt of lime juice in each bowl.  I think next time I might add some peanuts.

We absolutely loved this soup ... I substituted carrots for the red bell peppers, salsa for half of the tomatoes, chicken broth rather than vegetable, used 1 cup rice, and added cumin (as others have suggested).  The brown rice definitely needs to be pre-cooked for at least 30 minutes prior to adding.

Highly recommend this as a winter 'comfort' food!  Cilantro and sour cream, or peanuts, would be great toppings as well.  Very simple to prepare, and very flavorful.

I didn't think I would like this as I was making it, but in the end it was pretty good. I made half the recipe, added more chili powder (dbl or triple at least) + a dash of cinnamon & threw in a little cooked chicken. Probably a bit more peanut butter too. It thickens up after adding the peanut butter. It is pretty tasty. I may try using salsa instead of the tomatoes. It does need a little more spice in my opinion. Overall, very good.

This soup tastes great!  I loved it.  So unique!  The only change I made was to add 2 chili peppers instead of chili powder and because I only had smooth peanut butter I added walnuts to the soup.  Loved the crunch!

I had never eaten peanut soup, but was tired of the usual vegan fare I had been making since our conversion.  As other reviewers pointed out, this was pretty good the first day, but much better after it was in the  refrigerator overnight.  My father, a picky eater by his own admission, was convinced to try a spoonful.  He suprisingly exclaimed, "Why that's pretty good!"

Very good and easy to make.  I did make some changes based on other reviewers: used chicken instead of veggie broth, double the amount of chili powder, and added a pinch of two of cumin.  I paired it with toasted bread and a salad with smoked paprika vinaigrette (also found on the site).  My roommate and I both loved it...definitely exceeded my expectations.

Weird ingredients in this soup but so good! Dont let it scare you. It is a must try!! The changes I made was added 4 chicken breasts that was chopped and sauted in garlic and pepper, chicken broth, 16 oz jar of salsa and 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper and 1 cup rice. Most changes was because of what I had on hand. It is a nice and hearty soup and will make many more times!

We liked this a lot. I let my onions & red peppers caramelize (because I was chopping the remaining peppers to freeze up) for about an hour before continuing the next steps. I used salsa for the crushed tomatoes & would do that again. I added fresh cilantro. I doubled the black pepper & chili powder because we like things spicy. I served this with grilled pb&j sammies on the side. Thanks very much, my mother made soup very similar to this when I was growing up, so this was a nice trip down memory lane :)

I may be the only one who's taste buds prefer this, but I thought it needed some sugar added for a sweet and creamy peanut-y flavor.  I added about a 1/2 cup sugar and also some salt, and it was fabulous!

I am surprised at how many people gave this recipe high ratings.  I made it for my family and while there was nothing unpleasant about it, there was nothing enjoyable either.  I made it EXACTLY as stated (and added a dollop of sour cream just like suggested in the description) but after eating a bowl full I decided there was something missing.  It was sort of spicy, sort of tangy, sort of sweet, sort of a lot of things.  None of the flavors were fully developed and all of them were competing for attention.  I decided to add more spices but even that didn't help.  I don't know what to say.  By no means is this recipe disgusting but I certainly will not be trying it again.

Completely different than anything I've ever made, and I keep having to sneak another spoonful.  This is really delicious--and a perfect Fridays-of-Lent alternative for us Catholics!  I added some extra chili powder and some cinnamon, as suggested in one of the reviews, and pureed the finished product, as suggested in another.  Delicious.  Thanks!

My husband was very nervous about trying this soup.  He said the mix of ingredients sounded odd, but I convinced him to give it a try.  We really enjoyed it!  The different textures create a soup that is a meal in itself.  The tastes blend together in a very complementary way.  I gave this recipe to a colleague and her family enjoyed it as well.  THANKS!

This was a good soup but not the best I've ever had.  I liked the flavors and it was comforting.  I followed the recipe exactly except I added some more spice to my taste.  So I upped the chili, red pepper, red pepper flakes and cumin.  I could taste the peanuty flavor with the recommended amount and I also added french green lentils with the rice because I thought they would be good in it and have alot and cooked it longer.  Also because of what I had on hand I subsittuted wild rice medley (good)and fire roasted diced tomatoes (recommend this change).  Also which I think helped the flavor alot is I used fresh ground peanut butter from my neighborhood grocery so the peanut taste was very fresh and strong.  On a personal note, to anyone who buys reduced fat peanut butter, don't!!! It's horrible for you and peanuts have good fat in it for you and your replacing it with more sugar and corn syrup instead when you do that.  Sorry personal rant for the day.

Made this very close to the recipe originally (except I used a can of crushed fire-roasted tomatoes and a can of Rotel tomatoes) and subbed chicken stock for the veggie broth, because that's all I had and I do not use water in my soups, and I cooked the rice separately.  It was ok but I still felt it was missing something.  I added some cubed sweet potatoes and a bit of Garam Masala and a can of coconut milk and simmered until the potatoes were tender.  I refrigerated overnight and served over brown basmati rice the next day, and this is now a favorite soup of mine!  It's nice and thick, too.  My hubby gives it a thumbs-up, too.

Wow!  This tastes great!  I halved the recipe, but probably added about 6 cups of chicken broth, as that made it more soupy.  I also added the brown rice at the beginning, as it takes way longer to cook than listed (at least 45 mins).  I substituted the tomatoes for salsa and added a pinch of cumin and chili for some extra heat.  I will be making this again!

Excellent Recipe! Upon recomendation, I added a Sweet Potato (Cubed, uncooked) with the tomatos and it turned out great! I also added a good amount of Cumin, which also added a nice flavor. I wasn't sure how thick the soup should be, though I made it pretty chunky and it was very good, like a stew! It had a strong peanut taste, which I have mixed feelings on. While it was VERY good, in some ways it reminded me of oatmeal (consistency, peanut butter). All in all, a GREAT recipe!

Absolutley delicious! I use all natural peanut butter (regular brands have powdered sugar in them- which don't belong in soup!). I also like to spice it up with chili flakes. Yummmmm!

This was REALLY good. My husband and I had it for lunch the day after I made it because other reviewers said it was the best the next day to let the flavors meld. I did a few things different. I used hot salsa instead of crushed tomato, used a red and yellow bell pepper, added 2 jalepenos, 1 - 2 tsp cayenne pepper, and I used wild black rice and precooked it some. It was watery last night but has since thickened up. We added a dallop of daisy (sour cream) and ate it with Indian Naan in a curry flavor and it was absolutely wonderful! Thanks so much for the recipe. I will make again and again!

I made this soup for my boyfriend who is from W.Africa.  He said it was good and it almost taste like the original.  He uses a peanut paste in his soup which gives it more of a peanut flavor.

WOW! What a great flavor.  I've never had anything like it. And so easy.  I'm making it again tonight.  Don't have any chili powder but cayenne does the trick. Super with a dollop of sour cream.  Thanks for the recipe!!

WE HAD THIS AT A RESTAURANT AND LOVED IT!  WE WERE CURIOUS WHAT THIS COMBO WOULD TASTE LIKE. THE VERSION WE HAD USED CREAMY PEANUT BUTTER NO RICE WITH DICED CHICKEN WITH CHICKEN BROTH. I AM GOING TO TRY BOTH RECIPES BUT I DON'T THINK THIS WILL TOP THE RESTAURANTS VERSION!

I thought this was great. It has a different flavor from the things we usually eat and it was a nice change. I did add an extra 2 cups of water, doubled the rice, and tripled the chili powder.

I was excited about this recipe but disappointed in the results.  There seemed to be something missing -- maybe more spices (cayenne?  cumin?) would make this better.  The only change I made was not using brown rice because I only had basmati rice in my pantry.  Also, this recipe makes a HUGE amount.

Pretty good! I usually think tomato soup is too acid, but here the peanut butter takes the acidity out, and leaves you with a delicious soup.

This soup is amazing.  I made some changes.  I used a jar of salsa and a 10 oz can of diced tomatoes with cilantro & lime juice in place of the can of tomatoes.  I added 1/2 t of Cumin and 1/4 t of cayenne pepper.  I used creamy natural peanut butter.  I used one red and one orange bell pepper.  The result was excellent.  Thank you so much for the recipe.

My 7yo didn't care for it but we loved it. It is so tasty! I followed other reviewers and tweeked a few things as well such as peeled chopped potato, 1/2 cup salsa and I had an African blend spice which has cinnamon and fennel in it..yum. I used brown basmati rice, fresh roma tomatoes, sliced carrots and put a full cup of Kraft creamy peanut butter. You really can't go wrong. Definitely be making this again and again. Thanks for sharing!

Overall not a bad recipe. DELICIOUS the first bowl but after that it gets a bit boring. I made a big batch then froze smaller batches instead of wasting a big pot full. Be careful with others' suggestions - I may have added too much salsa based on another review and it made it taste slightly acidic. I added cinnamon, shredded carrot & celery which turned out beautifully. Give it a try! Definitely taste as you go along to make sure that it tastes the way you want it to.

This is a wonderful soup. I followed Liz E.'s slight modifications to make it more authentic, though I think it would have been just as good had I followed the recipe exactly. Thanks for this wonderful African soup!

Used 365 brand crunchy peanut butter, used Lotus brand pink Madagascar rice, which cooked pretty quickly and had just the right texture.

Very good!  Traditionally, instead of rice, would be yam / sweet potato, which my family doesn't like so I used boiling potatoes instead of rice.  Served with roast chicken and carrots - which I thought was good also mixed into into my bowl :-) anyway, I'll make this again!

Like many other reviews I added a bit as I was working and this recipe turned out DELICIOUS!  I substituted one jar of salsa for one of the cans of tomatoes and doubled the chili powder as well as added a dash of cinnamon and a dash of curry powder to the soup.  This soup turned out to be a hearty, spicy, vegetarian dish I would be proud to serve anyone!  It's going into our rotation from now on.

Made this soup for first time today. Found it to be excellent. I substituted the bell peppers with Cayman Seasoning peppers, turned out great.

Really seriously good!  Added some cubed butternut squash 15 minutes into the simmer along with some cinnamon and a heaping tablespoon of chili powder.  I also minced a large jalepeno pepper and sauteed it with the onions and bell pepper.  Sour cream and cilantro finish it off nicely.  Can't wait for the leftovers!

I added a huge bunch of fresh mustard greens from our local CSA to this recipe and it was yummy! Used 4 baby walla walla onions instead of 2 mediums. Went seriously heavy on curry powder instead of chili powder. Put in salt as well as the pepper the recipe calls for. Used vegan "chicken" broth. Took almost an hour for the brown rice to soften though- not 15 minutes- so allow for that :)

I simply didn't like it. The flavors didn't meld and the canned tomato taste was too dominant. If you do make this I strongly recommend using less tomato. As others have noted, 15 minutes isn't enough to cook brown rice, so I added the rice at the same time as the broth (I used chicken broth).

This soup was wonderful.  As other commenters noted, it took a lot longer than 15 minutes to cook the brown rice... but using quick cook brown rice or white rice would solve this.  Next time I plan to throw the brown rice in at the beginning.  Overall, the flavor was wonderful, and it was incredibly hearty and filling.  I made it vegetarian and my husband who isn't a big fan of vegetarian food loved it as well.

A great soup! I used a 14 oz can of tomatoes and 16 oz jar of salsa (instead of the 28 oz can of tomatoes) per another reviewer, and white rice instead of brown and creamy instead of crunchy peanut butter (because that's what I had on hand), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Delicious and filling. Added a touch of salt at the table. I agree that it would be great with some shredded chicken in there too. Will have to try that next.

I really enjoyed this soup! I added some crushed red pepper for a little spice.  It was delicious and filling as is but I think you could add shredded chicken or a beef stew meat and it would also be good!

This is a great recipe! I have made it twice. The one thing I would mention about it is that (and it could be due to my love of peanut butter, or maybe it's the kind I use?) both tims I have had to add at least twice the recommended amount of peanut butter. Ater adding more, the soup is a bit creamier and seems to have the amount of peanut flavouring I am looking for.

Loved it! Like some others I added sweet potato and cilantro. Used wild rice which gave a  nice texture along with the addition of chopped peanuts, as I  only had creamy natural pb, also chopped up some chicken and cooked it in the soup. Served with a wedge of lime to squeeze! Delish!

This recipe really worked out well for me. I did make a few changes. I cut the recipe in half and even then got lots of soup. Instead of using brown rice, I used quinoa (probably about 2/3 cup). I also added one cayenne pepper (because I like a bit of fire) and used chili powder, salt and pepper to taste. I did not saute the vegetables. Basically, I cut the onion and pepper into smallish squares and added everything to my slow cooker. I let it cook for about 3 hours and ended up with a nicely textured soup. I will definitely add this to my must make again list. Thank you!

I threw mine into a crock pot for convenience (low 6 hours, 1 hour on high uncovered to simmer down).  I would reccomend putting the rice in a couple hours later so it doesn't over cook.  I did double up on spices as others reccomend, and I am glad I did!  Also, I would reccomend looking at how to make your own peanut butter, its easy (healthier) and a much more "peanut buttery" taste.  Its super easy; peanuts, some oil and a good blender or food processer, voila!  You can look up a recipe on here for home made peanut butter.  I am only giving this 4 stars because I think it needs some thing more, it was lacking something.  I think some sweet potato or squash would push it to 5 stars.

Amazing! Has a Thai vibe, if you need context. I added jalapenos, used all green peppers, jasmine rice (but any will work), and topped with chopped cilantro. Everyone loves this!

I love this soup. I did doctor it up somewhat, based on comments and reviews. I added a yam, upped the rice content, doubled the spice, added some cumin  and used chicken bullion cubes.  I might use fresh chicken next time. I don't have any sour cream to put on top. I try to keep fat content down, so perhaps I will get some low fat yogurt and try that instead.

Enough peanut flavor and definitely better with the crunchy texture.  I like the rice in there as well and the chili powder gives it a nice backbone.

What a great recipe.  Like many other reviewers, though, I substituted and added one or two ingredients.  In my case: quinoa for the brown rice (cooks in the 15 minutes suggested) and a whole lotta hot sauce (Sriracha).  Organic peanut butter is definitely the way to go, especially with a bit of the separated oil that sits towards the top of the jar prior to opening.  The result is a very unusual conglomeration of ingredients and effects-- unlike anything I've ever tasted!

BLAND.  I even added a huge chopped sweat potato but the only real taste of anything was when you got a piece of the sweet potato in your spoon.  I even upped the spices and doubled the peanut butter on the suspicion that this would be bland..no help. ..sorry.

This was really good, but if you use normal brown rice like I did, you'll have to simmer the rice for 45 minutes in the soup, I added it 15 minutes into the uncovered simmering, then simmered for 30 minutes covered. The flavor of this soup is fantastic! I used regular chunky Jiff peanut butter. I garnished with reduced fat sour cream, roasted peanuts, and freeze dried cilantro. The taste with the sour cream was almost cheesy, very good. The combination of flavors was delightful, not strange like one may expect. The whole family enjoyed this one, I will keep it in my recipe box!

This really was fantastic.  I used creamy PB (because that's what I had in the house) and added chopped peanuts.  I also used a little less garlic and onion and more chili powder.  I will definitely make this again.  Loved it.

This was great and easy to make.  I would definitely add salsa instead of crushed tomatoes, just be careful that the salsa isn't seasoned with a lot of chipoltle.

Delicious soup.  I made this twice.  The first time as written.  The second time I added leftover curry rice from the night before and a little extra curry.

Delicious! I freeze all the juices from the canned tomatoes, beans, corn, legumes, etc. and use those as veggie stock. I also used Smuckers Natural Peanut Butter.  The brown rice needs a lot longer cooking time, however, or you could try leftover brown rice.

yum!  Threw in some shredded cooked turkey meat and chopped peanuts on top (used creamy PB 'cause that's what we have) also used chicken broth in place of vegetable broth. I also didn't put rice in it because we'd already had our allotment of the grain group for the day, and it was still plenty filling!

LOVED this soup. I love to make soups and this was a really interesting addition to my soup repitoire. It's super easy, and has a VERY unique flavor (not in a bad way!!). I used creamy PB and it turned out excellent. My husband is usually pretty critical and he LOVED this one. Thanks for the great recipe!!

This is definitely something different and I liked it.  As someone else said brown rice takes a while to cook and the directions are a bit off in that respect.  Some indigestion occurred, but overall worth a try.

This recipe was very similar to another on this site called "indian peanut stew." I made a few changes: used 4 cups vegetable stock and 2 cups chicken stock, added chopped zucchini, carrot, and sweet potato, used almost a full cup of natural chunky peanut butter and added crushed dry roasted peanuts (my boyfriend and I love peanuts). We also like things a little spicier, so I added lots of chili powder, paprika, ginger, and a pinch of cinnamon and cumin. We cooked brown rice seperately on the side which is why we used 2 cups less of vegetable stock in the stew. It definately tastes much better when it cools off or over the next couple of days.

I really loved this recipe! I put in a little extra cayenne and then about a 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes. It gave such a great flavor without burning your mouth out. I also halved the recipe as it wasn't for a crowd, and took the reviewers advice of adding salsa for one of the cans of tomatoes. I did end up adding a spoonful more of peanut butter because I tasted it after putting it in and I couldn't really tell any was in there. After the about 15 minutes though you could make out the peanut flavor. I think next time I will stick to the orginal amount but only due to the fat it adds to the recipe. Overall the flavor of this soup is awesome and I'm going to be in heaven for the next couple of days. This will definately be a staple recipe from now on.******

****
I'm still in love with this recipe. Now I let it boil for awhile to reduce down a bit and it makes it nice and thick. I have since started eating fewer carbs and now add shredded chicken thighs instead of the rice....yum, yum. These changes give it a kind of a stew like quality, serve with a dallop of sour cream and some chopped dry roasted peanuts on top...to die for!!!

I loved this recipe!  What a unique taste.  Along with other reviewers I added my own tweaks: I added shredded roasted chicken.  I added cubed sweet potato, more chili powder and some cumin.  I used smooth PB: cause that is what I have and added unsalted peanuts.  I used a jar of spicy salsa and for whole grains I used a mixed bag from trader joes' which had quinoa etc.  I think I am a good cook and this was excellent!  I am part of a "soup group exchange" of good cooks and we all really liked it.  Thank you for the recipe.  I think next time I may toy with the idea of adding some more veggies: zuchini?

I have never had anything like this before and was not sure I would like it, but it tasted really good.  I cooked the rice ahead of time and just added it to the soup at the end.  The servings were pretty large.

This was good.  Easy to make, too. It got really thick with all the simmering- I added a few TBS of water at the end.  I used Adam's Natural pb and pre-cooked my brown rice.  I really liked the flavor, but it could use something... not sure what.  But we did enjoy it, thanks for the recipe!

Hearty and delicious.  I kept pretty much everything the same, except I added a jalepeno for some kick and instead of crushed tomatoes I used half tomato sauce and half spicy salsa.  Oh, and per other reviews, I cooked the rice separately.  I loved this with a slice of toasted bread for dipping.

I added some chipotle peppers (thumbs up).  I give the rice a thumbs down though; it was not done enough.  Next time I will boil it separately for ~10 min before adding into this recipe.  

Overall, though, I will certainly make again.  Different and tasty.

Wow this was terrific!  I used canned tomatoes with green chilis and it really added some zing!  If you like it a bit hotter, this may be something you'd enjoy as well.  I only had chicken stock on hand, so I used it.  I doubt it changed things too much --and since this turned out so great, I'll most likely use it again.

I made this a second time two days later. I didn't add rice, because... I didn't want to. I added some Chinese hot sauce (you know which one I'm talking about... I can't spell it... starts with an "S" has a rooster on the front." Thank you SOOOO much for this recipe, I will make it again.

This is a great soup but it is a little heavy on tomatoes. My sweetie and I used more peanut butter (freshly ground) and a little flour. Instead of rice we used shredded chicken and chicken broth instead of vegetable stock. Needs more chili pepper and perhaps some giner... Thanks for the recipe.

I was only slightly impressed the first time I made this, but since then I've come back to it over and over again.  It's now in the regular rotation.  I make it exactly as written except that I use 2 c. cooked brown rice.

We followed this recipe exactly and didn't like it.  It had an underlying tangy flavor which I disliked.  It might be better with natural peanut butter, but I'm afraid to try it again.  Our family gives it four thumbs down.

This soup is DELISH! I only made half of the recipe because there is only 2 of us, but i wish I made it all to have more left-overs! Instead of regular vegetable broth, I used half Imagine Creamy Butternut Squash Soup (http://www.imaginefoods.com/pages/products/soupbroth/soup.php) and half water. Also, Instead of chili powder I used fresh ginger, which was really yummy and added a great zip to it. I will make this again and again.

Delicious! My brother and I loved this wonderfully creamy, interesting soup. It really is good with bread and sour cream (or yogurt for the health-conscious). The crunchy pb can be substituted for a low-fat version, if you want (that's what I did), but the crunch is probably for texture. I definately recommend this soup - easy, scrumptious, and different!

This works very well, but I agree with the other reviews that it needs a lot more spice/heat than as written. I'm still giving it 5  stars because it's easy enough to increase the spice level to your taste. I added red pepper flakes in addition to doubling the chili powder. I also added in some canned chickpeas along with the rice and that was good, but it's good as written, too. Thanks for this soup!

Wasn't good. Next time I would use less garlic (half),more peanut butter and more rice.

I think that those of us who use tomatoes, peanut butter, and broth without added salt, sugar, or other additives need to make alterations to this recipe. Here's what I did.
This was a hit after I altered it.
To start,I used less veggie broth. And I partially cooked the brown rice before I added it.

Additions after it turned out bland:
Maple syrup (approx 1/4 cup),
Lakewood OG Pure Lime juice (approx 1/4 cup),
more pepper, 
more chili powder, 
fresh cilantro,
more garlic (about 6 cloves total)
more peanut butter (I used Woodstock OG crunchy), 
2 med cans diced tomatoes.
And chopped peanuts and fresh cilantro for sprinkling on top of each serving.
Yummm!

I made this for the first time last week.  I love it because all the ingredients were in my pantry or frig. I read all the reviews and tips and followed a few of them.  I added frozen butternut squash, chopped fresh zuchini and crook neck squash because I had them.  We were eating this as a main dish with salad so I wanted a hearty soup.  I doubled the rice but would probably only add 25% more when making it again.  I also added 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes because we are addicted to spicey foods, some cummin and by mistake cinnamon because I thought it was cummin (same size container), increased garlic also.  The cinnamon was delightful in the soup as a background surprise flavor.  This soup was a hit by all who ate it and yes, it was better when we heated it up while watching football on Saturday afternoon.  It is a keeper recipe for anyone vegan or not and makes a generous amount, enough to freeze.  Thank you for submitting this delicious recipe.

An excellent soup.  I tried to adhere strictly to the recipe, but did follow the advice of others and replace 1/2 of the tomatoes with salsa.  Used chicken broth instead of vegetable, used natural chunky peanut butter, used quick cooking brown rice.  Agree that chicken would be good.  I think that I will add sweet potato next time as well.  When I first tasted this right after preparing, it wasn't anything great.  But, after it had been in the fridge for awhile, it was absolutely superb.  My family made fun of me for making peanut soup, but they all said they loved it.

Love this recipe!  It's an absolute favorite of mine.  I made a couple slight changes.  I add a full cup of peanut butter instead of the recommended 2/3 of a cup.  I also cook the rice separately and I double the amount...  I cook a full cup of brown rice and add it all to the soup after it's done cooking.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this soup!

One of my favorite soups: easy to make, nutritious, delicious, and freezes well. What more could you ask for? 
For variety, I've tried substituting cashew butter--also great.

I love this soup so much that I buy red bell peppers whenever there's a really good sale (and then I chop and freeze them), so that I'll be able to make this soup whenever I want to, without having to pay the normal full price for red bell peppers.

Took someone's advice and used half the crushed tomatoes and added about a cup of salsa. Also added a little bit of kale. It was really good!

I love soups. They're so versatile, simple, and cheap to make. For just a few English Pounds this out and out delicious soup has become one of my top-ten! The only change I made was to include a tsp of Allspice ...Yummy.

I added chili pepper flakes, as well as more chili powder than the recipe called for, based on other reviews.  However, I added too many chili pepper flakes, so I added a can of coconut milk, which tamed the heat.  The recipe was okay, but I feel that something else needs to be added to give this soup some oomph.  Strangely enough, this soup reminded me of Campbell's tomato soup AND bean with bacon.

There are not enough stars to describe how delicious and wonderful this soup is...!  We didn't quite have 8 cups of vegetable stock so the balance was beef stock.  Our soup was certainly thicker than what is shown in the photo, closer to a stew, but that was just fine with us.  A serious hit in our family and it is going on our list of favs to make again!!  Thanks so much for the recipe.

Amazing! I changed it based on reviews and I tripled the chili powder, added cinnamon and cumin and curry. I used diced tomatoes instead of crushed tomatoes. They were actually Kroeger garlic diced tomatoes! I loved it straight out of the pot with no sour cream. I cant't wait to try it second day!

Fantastic, but changes made:  Added corn, carrots, cinnamon, nutmeg, chili flakes, extra garlic, salt and pepper and double the rice. Let simmer for about 2 hours, added rice about 45 minutes before done. It thickened up, to more of a chili, and was sooo delicious! Added sour cream and a fresh squeeze of lemon juice at the table, really added a whole new kick to it.

Wow was this fantastic.  I downloaded this recipe a while back and finally got around to making it- not sure what to expect.  This will be on my "frequent flyer" list.  Made as written with the exception that I only had crunchy peanut butter not extra crunchy so I threw in a few crushed chopped peanuts

I followed this recipe exactly and it was very good.  It just lacked spice, we added a little hot sauce and it was perfect.  I also added the rice at the begining because my package says it takes 45 minutes to cook.

Surprisingly delicious! The peanut butter somehow works well with the other ingredients in the soup. The only thing I really noticed is that there is no way that the brown rice will cook in 15 minutes, I had to let the soup simmer for at least 30 minutes to get the rice soft enough to enjoy.  Overall, I enjoyed it and will be making it again.

Very satisfying soup.  As another reviewer suggested, I included some salsa and less of the canned tomatoes.  Good recommendation.  I also used homemade chicken stock instead of veg broth.  This will now be in my quick mid week meal rotation.  Thanks PIETOGO!

I just made this and it was absolutely delicious!  I did double the chili powder and added about 1/2 tsp of cayenne to add bit more of a kick.  The rice also takes a lot longer than 15 minutes to cook - closer to 40.

I loved this! My husband not as much, but he isn't as much of a soup lover as I am. I doubled the onion, tripled the tomatoes, added spinach (great addition), and added the brown rice in as I served it to make sure the grains don't absorb all the water! Fantastic, and I've already made this 4 times now.

This was an awesome soup. My kids wouldn't touch it because "Peanut butter goes on bread!" My husband and I really enjoyed the flavor.  Easy to make and easy to store. Bell peppers and peanut butter, who would have thought?  Will make again in the winter.

This recipe is exactly what you would expect it to be. Tastes like peanut soup. Not quite to my liking although definitely not bad at all. Probably would not make again.

Followed the recipe closely so I could rate it. (One exception below.) I thought doubling the spice would have been an improvement as it was a bit bland; my husband doesn't like spicy food so he enjoyed it. I don't like rice in soup (it gets an unpleasant texture), so I substituted barley. I think barley for rice was a great substitution.

Excellent soup.  I had a dinner party and this recipe was a hit.  I was a little short on the vegetable stock by about 4 cups and it turned out thicker.  I can use it as a spread :)

This is definitely one of the best soups I've ever tried!  I only deviated slightly from the recipe by using chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, and smooth peanut butter with actual chopped/crushed peanuts.  I will make this again and again.  If you like trying new recipes and tasting new things, I would absolutely recommend this!

Wow! I was so worried about this one. I made it for a party and didn't know if the flavors would be a good match. But it worked, and everyone wanted the recipe.

"Peanut Soup? What was she thinking?!" is probably what my guests thought when I announced what was for dinner, but everyone loved the soup! It takes a lot longer for brown rice to cook then the recipe states so either increase cooking time or pre-cook the rice.  I will bump up the spice next time (I don't like spicy food but this needed more kick even for my taste).  Thank you for this recipe!

The soup was alright.  But I thought it needed more peanut butter.  My leftovers tonight will have some added peanuts.

This recipe is delicious! Depending on your preference, I would recommend adding a little spice.After following the original recipe, I added in some chili powder and Tabasco to taste. 
Very unique flavor and great texture.

if i could get an iv of this i would.  cut the recipe in half, used creamy  peanut butter, added a couple pieces cut up boneless skinless thighs and topped with the white sauce from fish tacos(sounds wierd but it's my new favorite sauce) instead of sour cream.  Can't wait till I'm not stuffed to have some more.

Excellent!! I added about a cup of red roasted peppers, a teaspoon of ginger, a few big squirts of thai hot sauce (the one with the rooster on the bottle) and doubled the chili powder. The only rice i had was Near East-brand pecan and garlic mixed brown rice-- which i made separately. Will definitely make this again!!

This soup was such a surprise--I never would have thought peanut butter, tomatoes, and rice would taste so good together. It probably won't be something I'll make often, but it's a great dish to impress friends and family with.

This is one of mine and my husband's favourites. I do everything according to the recipe except the rice. Like other reviewers, I don't find that it cooks sufficiently, so I usually cook it on its own while the veggies simmer and add it near the end. Prepared in this way, I find this soup almost addictive. I usually end up eating it for every meal (and even snacks) until it's gone.

This was very good! However, it did take a LOT longer to cook the rice. I would use creamy instead of crunchy peanut better next time. I added at least 2x as much chili powder and I added some cayenne pepper. It never got quite as spicy as I would like, so I would add a jalepeno pepper with the onion to give it more spice next time. Overall - really good and tasty and fairly easy.

Loved the flavour, but the rice took MUCH longer to cook than expected. Next time I will add the rice right away instead of waiting or use instant rice.

This was super delicious!  My husband caught me putting the peanut butter in though!  He said "sounds interesting..." with the raised eyebrow.  hee hee.  I showed him, when he was done with his 2nd bowl he said "this one is a keeper!"  My two kids loved it too.  The only thing I added was 1/2 of a habanero pepper and I used extra chunky jif.

I tend to make this in the crockpot, so when I actually made it on the stove, the rice was not cooked enough.  Probably should double the rice time or switch it to white rice.

Very good!  I used white rice because my brown rice takes 40 min to cook versus the 20 it took the white, and I didn't have the time to spare.  For the amount of soup this recipe makes I recommend doubling the spices.  Served with homemade wheat bread.

of all the great recipies on this website this is not one of them...its not "bad" id say its more "interesting".  I added a little more chicken broth and also used salsa instead of canned tomatoes...like the reviews suggested.  I dont think that I will be making this again...but for those of you who do try it  i bet it will taste better with shredded chicken, cilantro and maybe some coconut milk- it will give it a Thai flavor oh and maybe some chilies to make it spicier

First, I don't understand how people can rate the recipe a 5 when they make so many changes!  We are rating the original recipe, not your creation!

With that said, I give this a 5.  This is a fun vegan/vegetarian recipe that seems fairly difficult to mess up.  The only changes I made were adding one full cup of brown rice and one full cup of natural creamy peanut butter.  I think this is perfect for someone who is used to eating vegetarian/vegan food.  I would make no other changes at all.

I created a hybrid of this and the "African Sweet Potato and Peanut Soup" recipe for a potluck, and made half vegetarian and half meaty.  For the meaty version cooked cubed chicken with the onions & peppers and used chicken stock.  From the other recipe I added cubed sweet potato and a mix of cumin, cinnamon, ginger and cloves to both versions for more complex flavor.  Also used canned fire roasted tomatoes with green chiles.  After adding brown basmati rice and sweet potato simmered for 45 minutes and turned out great!  Garnished with sour cream, cilantro and chopped peanuts for rave reviews from both vegetarians and carnivores.

Wonderful! Even the kids love it! For more texture and a sweeter flavor add sweet potatoes while it simmers.

This is fantastic!  I didn't have brown rice so I used long grain white rice.  I did everything else exactly as directed and I wouldn't change a thing.  We're only two people so I froze some of the leftovers (not for very long because I found myself craving  it).  It thawed and reheated very well.

Great soup. COOK THE RICE LONGER. I cooked it for 30 minutes instead of 15, and added a full cup of peanut butter instead of 2/3 cup. Will make this again.

Rather nice. Though i found that the tomato overpowered the other flavours in the soup. So i would use more peanut butter and less tomatoes.

I made this last night and used diced tomatoes instead of crushed tomatoes,chicken broth instead of the vegetable broth(Got these ideas from other reviews),shredded cooked chicken seasoned with chicken boullian and pepper. I didn't have crunchy peanut butter but I did have smooth and I just crushed up my own peanuts. I agree with others that the rice should be cooked ahead of time. IT WAS PERFECT!!

LOVED IT!  Made it exactly as directed and it came out really good.  Next time I may try adding chicken, although my hubby liked it even though it was vegetarian (he's a meat & potatoes guy).  I'll make this again for sure.

I loved this recipe. I blackened the peppers and skinned them, then pureed them. This adds a slight smoky flavor that goes well with the peanuts. Will make again.

An easy winner for us... rich, very satisfying for a vegetarian meal.  I think it would impress open-minded guests because even though the combination is unusual it tastes very good.  Maybe I would try adding neutral veggies (small pieces of cauliflower) next time for an experiment.  Will make again for sure.

Made this last night and it was delicious.  The sour cream on top makes this soup.  I served it with scalloped corn, a mixed green salad, and garlic bread. Yummy!!!

This soup is delicious!  It's new for me to mix peanut butter with something like tomatoes, but it's a welcome flavour. Being a student I like to freeze meals to keep something on hand for a quick meal. This soup freezes great, and is even better as leftovers. Thanks!

This soup is delish! I have varied the recipe by using natural chunky PB, quick brown rice (and more of it!) and adding more spice (chili pepper & fresh ginger). I like it as a comfort soup for the cold months.

Hmmmmmm! This is really hard to rate.  It was okay and very interesting to try, but not something I would make again.  The chili powder is not optional, it adds a lot of flavor.  IF I was to make this again I would not use crunchy peanut butter.  It just did not work with this recipe (use creamy).  I scaled this recipe to 5 but left the rice at the 10 serving size, it could use more.  I think diced tomatoes would work just as well as crushed.

This is very good and unique; I like that it is a balanced, healthy, and filling meal.  I don't know if it was just me, but I ate it for 3 days, and every day it tasted better.  Maybe it improves with some time to sit.  I left out the peppers, used diced tomatoes, and reduced fat PB. Thanks

I'm not sure what I expected with this recipe.  The concept was relatively unique and new to me, so I thought I'd try it.  The biggest (maybe only) strike against it was that I found it bland.  I found the spice/seasoning profile was far too light and there was no discernable peanut flavor.  Making it again, I think I would triple the peanut butter and quadruple the spices.  I would also experiment with basil or something similar to lift it up a bit.

Wow! This is a delicious soup! Wasn't sure how I would like it but figured I would since I love peanut butter! I did increase the amounts of chili powder and pepper and also added a couple of cubed sweet potatoes I had on hand. I used basmati rice which cooks in 15 minutes vs closer to 45 minutes for brown rice. This recipe is a keeper!

So i used poblano peppers and a fair amount of ancho chilis.  Used extra crunchy Jiff.  It was awesome.  Topped with cilantro and green onions.  Only other item i changed was to use fire roasted whole tomatoes.  I drained them and cut them up, and then sautÃ©d with the onions. Added the tomato juice with the stock.    I let it sit for a few hours as i always do with soup. 

I didnâ€™t have brown rice so used white.  Think brown would have been better, but it was still a success.

i will for sure be making this again.

This was very good! I made it last night at half the servings with a few changes and had it again today for lunch. Like many soups it tasted much better the next day.

The changes I made are that I took other reviewers advice and added cilantro and fresh lime juice during cooking and topped each bowl of soup with some roasted peanuts and sour cream. I also added some chile and lime salt spice. I cut the rice out (I try not to carb it up too often). The BIGGEST change I made was to the peanut butter, but hear me out!

I realized I only had honey roasted peanut butter on hand, then remembered I had PB Fit powder. I used about 3 large spoonfuls. I really liked that it added the peanut butter flavor without making the soup too thick or heavy. 

Delicious starter recipe, next time adding chicken for sure!

Very good! Unique yet familiar. 

Changes I made:

-added a block of tofu: adds protein & volume without changing flavor much lol

-added 1/2 sweet potato per other reviewer's suggestions. worked very well

-I  made a 1/2 recipe, but kept the full amount of PB!!! Why not. It was decadent. Probably still good with the "correct" amount but delicious with double ;P

-I don't feel that the rice added much. maybe if I hadn't added the sweet potato would have noticed it more. I think you can skip the carbs & leave the rice out, OR, maybe serve over rice instead. 

If I make again, I'll add some chopped peanuts on top, & serve over basmati rice

Love it. I can't  eat dairy and thought  peanut soup was lost to me. Not  so. This is a rich soup with veggies. I did put in 2 T of grated ginger as I had read it in similiar recipes. Very good, plan on sharing at next potluck as it goes together easily.

This soup is simple and amazing. I like it more spicy, so I add more cayenne / jalapeno. I recommend having a healthy amount of crusty bread because it's great for dipping.

Great base, but needs tweaking to reach full potential.
The spices are completely unnoticeable in such a large volume of liquid. I added 4x the black pepper and double the chili. Also added paprika. 

With those minor additions, it was hands down the best African peanut soup I've made, and I've tried a dozen different recipes.

I loved it! I made it twice but the second time I upped the peanut butter to all of a small jar of all natural peanut butter.  I'm guessing 28 oz.  The extra peanut flavor really made the soup better.

We really liked this. The only change I made was to add the brown rice when the liquids went in, because it seemed like it would need that whole time to cook. Served with a green salad and some take & bake bread for a nice light dinner.

A seemly odd combo that works really well! I doubled the rice which ended up being a mistake and it was super thick lol. Best to leave that bit as is probably.

This was delicious!  We loved how all the flavors worked together and the rice gave it a stew-like consistency. The only change I made was to add some shredded chicken I had on hand. Next time I'll add a diced sweet potato and bump the heat a little by adding a can of diced tomatoes and green chilies.  This one is a keeper!

Love this soup!  It's my "go to" for lunch.  I just add additional chilli powder, some cumin & cinnamon.  Occasionally I'll add red pepper flakes to spice it up.  If I don't have crunchy peanut butter I crush some peanuts.  YUM!!  For a vegetarian I substitute chicken  bouillon for the veggie bouillon.  Both are great!

I have made this soup as is and it's very good, especially with some crusty bread and a dollop of sour cream mixed in.  I add a sprinkling of cayenne towards the end and it moved it up to 5 stars for me and mine. It lasts surprisingly long for a vegetarian soup, what with the peanuts. Thank you for a great and unusual recipe!

Thought this was really tasty!  I added an extra 1/4 cup of rice and used white rice because I didn't have any brown rice.  I also added 1/4 cup of chopped cilantro, shredded cooked chicken and 1/4 tsp. of cumin when I added the peanut butter.  It was delicious!

Substituted 1/3 of the crushed tomatoes with purÃ©ed squash, added 30% more extra crunchy peanut butter, and added smoked paprika, red curry powder and ground cayenne pepper to kick up the spice a bit.

Winner of the Fineview 2016 Soupapalousa!

Made this recipe in bulk for a multicultural food fest, smelled and looked amazing and completely sold out! Very simple to make yet so good! I would also suggest mixing part crushed tomato  part mild salsa in place of just the crushed tomatoes. Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome, made this a number of times now. Some hints and tips: First of all,  I was tempted to try canned diced instead of crushed tomatoes; don't recommend it, it's worse.

However some changes that I found are worth it:
* For the quantity I had, I used about 5-6 cups instead of 8 cups of broth since the pan was too small. Leaving the other ingredients the same amount. So it's more dense, which is nice!
* Add a handful of crushed peanuts for even more crunchy nutiness!

This is delicious if you like peanuts which I do. The soup had a great texture and flavor. I added a cup of precooked brown rice and reduced the vegetable broth to 7 cups. I also added 1 tsp of chili powder rather than a half. I will make this again.

This is one of our family's favourite soup! I make it a bit heartier by adding chicken breasts to it at the beginning and boiling them, and then I remove them and shred them once cooked and add it back into the soup once done. I also add crushed peanuts because I use smooth peanut butter. Love this!

Just made it for the first time today and I absolutely love it! I added fresh chilli instead of powdered and some ketchup for a little sweetness as I made it quite spicy. Will definitely be making this a lot more.

I made this soup for the first time for a dinner parry.  I took the advice of other reviewers and substituted mild salsa for 1/2 of the tomatoes.  It was so good that several people asked if they could take some of the leftover soup home.  I used chunky natural peanut butter and brown rice.  I just let the soup simmer while making other dishes so that the rice would be done.   Topped with sour cream and cilantro, this soup made a pretty presentation in glass soup bowls.  I do plan to make this again.  It's so quick and easy.

I loved it! But I did make it a little bit differently. I doubled the garlic cloves, doubled the powder, and used chicken stock as opposed to vegetable stock. I also didn't add the full 8 cups of broth as I like my soups thick, I only did about six. I did a full up of rice as opposed to 1/2, and I only used one large onion since I chose to substitute the can of tomatoes with chunky salsa. I sautÃ©ed half of a sweet potato (diced) in olive oil, a little butter, and some cinnamon then added it to the mixture before adding the peanut butter. I also added a little more peanut butter than called for which was PERFECT! I ended up realizing I didn't need to add any additional peanuts in the end because of this (which was awesome seeing how I forgot to buy extra peanuts!). After the soup was finished, I found myself adding a bit of chilli powder, onion powder, and seasoning salt to my bowl. It was DELICIOUS! Soooo....  time I will add a little more garlic and chilli powder. I will also throw in a little onion powder ?? Try the recipe! Make it your own!

Delish! I put my rice in with the broth and tomatoes, which had my basimati rice perfect after 30 min. Also added an extra 1/4 tsp of chipotle chile pepper for more heat, a pinch of cumin and some lemon juice.

I made this the other day and it tasted great! I used whatever ingredients I had on hand; can fire roasted tomatoes, chipotle pepper in Adobo sauce and a box of College Inn Thai Ginger broth. Added the peanut butter (super chunky) during the last 30 minute And let it do it's thing in the crockpot! Easy no must no fuss recipe!  Freezes nicely, will be making again but not too soon! This isn't exactly waistline friendly!

I just got this recipe into the slow cooker! Cannot wait! Is there anyway of finding out the nutritional breakdown/calories per serving?

Oh My Gosh. This is wonderful, definately not what I expected. It seemed a little odd, but the taste is absolutely addictive. The family really liked it too. It tastes better the next day as left overs too. I did have to boil the brown rice 40 minutes or so, not the recommended 15. Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this for my family on Christmas Eve and everyone loved it!  I doubled the red peppers and the garlic and added a little cumin (1/2 tsp).  It was a unique flavor.  My family said that they wouldn't have known there was peanut butter in the soup if I hadn't told them.  The peanut butter is subtle but adds just the right twist.  Thanks for the recipe!

I absolutely love this soup! It became one of my favorites from the first time i made it. I've made it several times as written and with some slight alterations to suit what i had, it's wonderful every time! I can't get enough, i'll even eat it cold!

I made this the night before I intended to have it, because I knew the flavours would improve given the chance to mingle. (I cooked it until the rice was almost done, and then let the pot sit undisturbed on the stovetop til the next day. Then, I heated it to boiling, and simmered on low until the rice was cooked.) The combination of flavours is weird at first, but tastes better with every serving. I used veggie broth, fresh tomatoes, and additional chili powder. The day after, I stirred in a bit of hot Mexican-style tomato sauce and it was even better. Garnishing with chopped nuts or using chunky peanut butter is a must--the crunchiness is great.

Though not necessarily a quick dish, this dish is easy to make for a college student like me.  The ingredients are not hard to find and are usually things i have around the apartment anyway.

I made a few small changes to the recipe that i am not sure if anyone else did because i didn't read the 119 other reviews.

1.  Added Cayenne pepper to the mix... mostly to taste, i never measure anything anymore, just eyeball.

2.  cubed and browned a lb and a half of tofu and tossed that in right after i stirred in the peanut butter.  This adds another texture and absorbs the rich flavors of the soup.

3.  This isn't as much a change to the recipe as it is a suggestion for a side.  I served this with pieces of sourdough for dipping.  My friends and I really enjoyed it.

I loved this soup. I was unsure of it at first, but when the flavors all blended together, it was awesome. My husband didn't care for it, but he is a bit picky. If you are looking to try something different, this is it.

Excellent savory peanut soup.  I ended up adding a tbsp or so of carraway seeds (which i mistakenly thought was brown rice), which made for an interesting yet tasty flavor.

This was mum mum delicious. I used regular rice and not instant so, my rice needed additional cooking time. That is the only modification I would suggest.  I also used more peanut butter because I love peanut butter but a friend who tasted it said she thought it would be perfect with less peanut butter.  I also added crushed red pepper and turkey sausage to make it more spicy and more hearty.

Like most soups, it was definitely better the next day.  Initially i was like...ummm...it's ok....what's all the rave about?  By the next day,   i was hooked and in love.  For sure do the extra crunchy peanut butter.  I also went with the additional green chili's, cayenne pepper, and cumin. No sour cream was needed for me.  Can't wait for the next pot.

Yum!  We were a bit skeptical of the idea of peanut soup, but with all the positive reviews it sounded worth a try.  This is a great change from the more typical American potato and tomato soups.  I wouldn't change a thing.

This is excellent -- one of my favorite soups.  I make a big pot of this and my husband and I eat it for several days.  It's a unique flavor, but it really grows on you.  Excellent with crusty bread.  I usually add a little extra peanut butter.

Awesome soup!!!  Hubby and I both loved it.  A few minor changes...  I used 4 cups chicken broth (instead of vegetable broth) and excluded the rice.

This is a wonderful soup!  I followed the recipe almost exactly, except that I tossed in some tomatoes that I had grown that were starting to get soft.  This is even better the second day.  My family loved it.  Its a keeper.
