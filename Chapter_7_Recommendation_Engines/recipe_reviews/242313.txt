The worcestershire sauce just overpowered and although this really is an easy recipe it just didn t taste like Tonkatsu sauce to me. I ended up adding some soy sauce ginger garlic powder and even a splash of dry sherry. With these changes it worked OK on the chicken and my 3-star rating is based on adding those additional ingredients. Sorry for the less than favorable review but this just didn t work for me.
