This was delicious, and I can't wait to prepare it again!  I used fresh apples, however, and cheese flavored Ritz crackers.

My husband LOVED this dish! I made it with red delicious apples, so it was a little too sweet, but I will make it again. I served it with pork chops that were marinated in raspberry honey mustard! Wonderful combination!

Hmmm..."truly memorable" as in "I'll remember the next time I've got cheddar and apples, I won't use this recipe again." On paper, it looks like a slam-dunk, but my results were more "dish"-appointing. Rather blah, in fact. My husband thought it was a potato dish - even after he tasted it! I used MacIntosh apples and good cheese, but honestly, it wasn't worth the time or effort. I'll save the apples and cheese next time for the wine.

i thought this was just okay- i like it better with pineapple, and a pistachio cruble topping.

this is a very quick recipe to put together and is also very good. I made it for my husband and he loves it,and I made it for my dad on his birthday and he loved it as well. I used fresh apples. I doubled thye recipe and used 4 cups of apples in a 2 quart baking dish.
