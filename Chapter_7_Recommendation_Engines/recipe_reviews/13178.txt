Delicious I used fresh green beans and put in at begining. I like mine with more vinegar and used almost a 1/4 cup. Didn't use any sausage. It brings back good childhood memories. As a bonus it does not get easier than this.

I did the recipe as stated and then added thinly sliced celery and chopped radish greens. It was incredible. I used fresh string beans and started them at the same time as the potatoes. Thank you for the recipe:)

This was very good! Since I am not a fan of sausage I used shredded chicken instead. Very delicious!

Delicious - I used fresh green beans though. Not a fan of canned. My family liked it.

Looking for a soup that used green beans I came across this recipe. It called for canned green beans I used fresh. I just started the beans at the same time I started the potatoes and threw the onions in at this point also. The recipe doesn't tell you how much water to use so I used enough to completely cover all the vegetables. I used Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream as that is what I had on hand. Make sure you remove the pan from the heat and let rest about 5 minutes before you add the sour cream. That will help with the small curdling white pieces from appearing. They don't hurt to eat they just don't make the soup pleasant to look at. I cooked Polska Kielbasa in a separate pan and added it right before serving. This soup had good flavor and was a nice new way for my family to enjoy green beans. I paired this with 'Fyre Lake Cornbread' a personal recipe from AR. We had a nice dinner on a cool evening. This recipe has been "faceless" since December 2002.

Delicious! I added more vinegar as I enjoy the taste and kept it vegetarian. My whole family loved it and my husband has asked me to make it again. This is going into our permanent meal rotation.
