My husband rarely rates anything five stars, but this recipe got his full approval.  The topping adds wonderful flavor without overshadowing the salmon, and it makes a beautiful presentation.  Thanks for sharing.

Restaurant quality !  Marinade using "Salmon Tango" recipe on this site for 1 hour.  In the meantime mix up the topping. I did add some fresh cilantro, and parsley along with the fresh basil.  I used 1/2 cup chunky salsa with a generous amount of  sliced grape tomatoes and also added some capers with just a bit of caper juice. Pan fried the salmon in olive oil along with the left over lemon rinds for 6 minuets a side. Salmon came out so deliciously tender. I served on a bed of fried rice cauliflower which took it to the next level. I got a .99 cent bargain in the produce discount rack on riced cauliflower and used a recipe from this site for "Fried Riced Cauliflower ". There are also many good frozen riced cauliflower options to choose out there to save time.

I goofed and put 2 tablespoons of the balsamic vinegar and added the garlic. To be precise, I did everything backwards and goofed it yet it still tasted great!

Family loved it!   The stovetop saut√©ed of the salmon added a lot of flavor over a traditional bake.   The balsamic reduced and added a wonderful sweetness.

Really liked this. Used some of the sauce for a topping for veggies since I doubled it.

It was amazing! I added one cup of tomatoes instead of 1/2 cup and came out great! Everyone asked for seconds!
