I made this dip for my daughter's 2nd grade class. They all loved it!! The teacher asked for the recipe.I was careful to follow the recipe exactly.I was concerned that one reviewer had lumps from the cream cheese in her dip. To avoid lumps, I took the cream cheese out of the refrigerator a few hours before I used it and let it come to room temperature. Then I put it in the microwave for about 40-seconds to make sure it was soft. Then I stirred it well and then added the condensed milk and stirred it well. As a matter of fact, I used a mixer. In the morning, I did not have lumps nor did it separate and look like cottage cheese. It was perfect. I stirred it well, one more time to make sure. I will no longer purchase fruit dip from the store again. Yum!!!

This was fabulous and couldn't be easier to make. How could just three things taste sooo good together? I used strawberries, melon, apples, and pineapple for dippers.Everyone at our party devoured this and wanted the recipe. I  made it again yesterday to try on my kids-they loved it and ate lots more fruit than usual-and that's a real plus. I added a little more lemon juice. Delicious!

This is a wonderful summer recipe-Not sure why the other reviewer had trouble mixing in the cream cheese.  I put the softened cheese in the mixer and whipped it until smooth then added the sweetened condensed milk and lemon juice. Everyone loved it-even kids-at our party last weekend people were fighting for the last strawberry to dip, and I gave the recipe out many times! No one could believe it was so easy.

I used a mixer to blend all the ingredients together, and even after a few minutes of beating, the mixture still wasn’t homogeneous.  I couldn’t get rid of the little bumps, and none of my guests were crazy about it.  I liked it, but it was hard to get people to try it.

This was a realy good dip! It was a little sweet for me so I added more cream cheese, and it was great. Our favorite to dip in it was Granny Smith Apples, the tartness was yummy with the sweet dip.

I wasn't too crazy about this fruit dip, but a friend of mine absolutely *loved* it and begged for the recipe.  She was really excited about it.  So don't let my lack of taste deter you from trying this recipe. ;)

I just made this, and it is EXCELLENT! This is almost a clone of the Marzetti's cream cheese fruit dip! Just beat the cream cheese FIRST, then add the sweetened condensed milk... wonderful! Absolutely 5 stars, and thanks for this recipe!

I made a triple batch of this for my daughter's grad party - HUGE mistake. First of all, one batch would have been too much. This had a funny taste to it - maybe from the canned milk. I would pick another recipe- marshmallow fluff based recipes are much better.

Looking for a fruit dip for my girls Valentine's party with what I had in my pantry and this one fit the bill :)      The trick to a creamy dip with no lumps is to beat the cream cheese (on high with electric beater)by itself really well until smooth.  Then add the eagle brand a little at a time until it's the consistency of marshmallow cream (I only used 1/2 the can).  I added 1/4 cup powdered sugar because I will be serving this to 4 year olds and didn't want it too tart.  After it mellowed in the fridge overnight it was perfect!  Can't wait to see what the class thinks about it...

I served this for a group and had numerous inquiries on where I had "bought it".  When I told them I made it, everyone was so impressed.  It went great with fresh strawberries and golden pineapple!

This is my recipe and I am very glad people are enjoying it.   The taste and texture of this simple recipe is totally different and infinitely better when the flavors are allowed to blend in the fridge overnight. Thanks to those reviewers who figured it out for themselves, and apologies to everyone else who tried this- I should have included that info in my original directions!  And of course the cream cheese needs to be softened to allow it to blend smoothly.

This is the first time I've ever made anything with condensed milk. I couldn't get past the smell of the condensed milk to eat any of the dip, even after adding more lemon, vanilla, and powdered sugar. Any suggestions? I may try Eagle brand or use less next time. I expected condensed milk to be sweet and creamy but it actually reminded me of breast milk or baby formula.

This is the best fruit dip I've ever had! Admittedly I don't even measure the almond or vanilla I just mix it to taste...probably way more than recommended. It does continue to get better and better as the flavors meld overnight, but it's great when it's just mixed too. Can't go wrong!

yummy! this fruit dip is finger-licking good!!...i only made a very slight change the second time around which was to leave out about 2 Tbs of the condensed milk just to suit my sweetness level...and as long as the cream cheese is softened as the recipe states, i had no problem getting it smooth.

This had a wonderful taste. There were little lumps in the dip that I couldn't get rid of, but I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese, and I think that may be why. Even though there were lumps, it tasted delicious. If I made it for company again, I would use regular cream cheese.

Made this for Christmas and was very disappointed...had no problems with lumpy mix or taste but, it was too thick despite my letting the dip come to room temperature...so, you took a chunk of fruit and had to dig in with very little dip adhering to the fruit...it would have made a better spread....the fruit all was eaten but, the dip was tried by everyone and not eaten.

I really thought I would like this, and we had a huge platter of fruit on skewers for dipping in it, but it was way too sweet for me.  I might try it again with less sweetened condensed milk, but I'm not sure if the cream cheese would be too strong in that instance. It could be good, just needs some tweaking for our tastes.

skip the lemon! This also makes a great spread for gourmet type crackers... or bread. Added a teaspoon - tablespoon (guess-timation) of peanut butter to it, my darling took one taste and promptly declared the whole bowl HERS. Also tried it with a hint of caramel instead of peanut butter. That was also very delicious!

I only used half a can of the milk because it seemed to get really sweet, really fast.  I added a splash of vanilla as well.  I mixed a lot of fruits (apples, strawberries, cantalope, grapes, etc) and put in the smaller fluted solo cups and let everyone spoon the dip into their cup.  It was like a parfait.  Very yummy and easy as an appetizer.  Just grab a cup and spoon on how ever much dip you want. It was a little thin but after being refridgerated over night it was a perfect consistancy.

I made this for the first time for our son's Confirmation party and served the dip with a fruit salad (grapes, kiwi, strawberries, blackberries and pineapple). The dip had a great flavor, but was still a gooey texture. I did receive many complements on it but it was *really* messy. (I didn't change the recipe at all.)  Instead of dipping my fruit into the dip, I drizzled it onto my fruit, like a sauce.

This definitely is UNBELIEVABLY the BEST fruit dip ever. Super easy to make & the texture was perfect. Not too thin or thick.   Tastes better the next day after. I used the lemon from the bottle & it turned out fine, along with the Philly Cream Cheese from an 8oz tub & Eagle Condensed Milk. I tried another fruit dip  on this site, & hands down, this was the better of the two. Great for anytime & parties. I will be making this next month for a bridal shower & birthday party no doubt !

I really enjoyed this fruit dip!  I tried using low fat cream cheese (neufchatel) and used generic ingredients.  Since I was just making for my family, I experimented.  It still came out really good and I didn't have a problem with lumping - even with using just-out-of-the-fridge cheese.  I may even get brave enough to try the fat free sweetened condensed milk.  It makes a great base for other flavors. I can't wait to experiment more!!

You know, this had a really good flavor. I left the cream cheese out on the counter for a day and a half, but I could NOT get the cream cheese lumps out of it!  My hand-held mixer won't do it.  My potato ricer wouldn't either.  Any suggestions?

I have to agree with the crowd - simple, but fantastic with all kinds of fruit!  Another reviewer mentioned that the dip was lumpy - to avoid that, be sure that the cream cheese is room temperature ("softened") and if you're not confident in its non-lumpiness, use an electric mixer to beat the cream cheese until it's smooth, then add the milk and lemon juice!  Thanks, Ruthie!

This was easy to make, and I had no issues with clumps like some people. The dip definitely grew on me as I ate it, but to be honest when I first tried it I didn't like it. You could taste the cream cheese too much, and I had hoped this would be more like a sweet fruit dip I'd had at a party once. It tasted better once I had it with fruit, and is probably healthier than the one I had tried, so I'll probably make this again. I will look into making a few changes though. I wonder how pineapple juice would mix? I need something to make it a tad less cream-cheesey.

Awesome fruit dip! Makes fruit even tastier, if that's possible. I served it with strawberries, pineapple, blackberries, blueberries, and raspberries; I'm sure it would be great with lots of other fruit too! Very easy to make. I discovered that you can't mix it by hand, and switched to an electronic mixer, and refrigerated for about one hour. The reason you can get a bumpy texture is because the cream cheese isn't softened enough. When it's colder than the other ingredients, they don't mix well. Great recipe!

This is so very well named!!!   I love it!  So very good.  Mine was a little lumpy but I didn't use a mixer or blender and will do so next time but the texture didn't take away from the taste.  Absolutely amazing for so few ingredients.  Thanks for the recipe.

Wow for such a simple dip, this is awesome. Rave reviews at the party we served it at. 

I am going to take the leftover fruit and mix it all up to make a fruit salad so you don't have to dip...

This is really tasty!  Of course, I'm a huge fan of condensed milk!  I let my cream cheese sit for four hours before blending and I still had a few very small lumps.  After stirring they slowly melted away.  I whisked by hand, but should have used the stand mixer.

So good and so easy! I even forgot to make it early. Very yummy, it thickens up when refrigerated.

I love this recipe. It is so easy and so good. I used this at my son's first birthday party. The parents loved it.
Do listen to everyone about leaving the cream cheese out for a while. That helps a great deal.

Update...I now make this with fat free cream cheese and fat free sweetened condensed milk. I don't use the full amount of the sweetened condensed milk because it makes it a little runny. People have said that they cannot even tell the difference.  This dip tasted great and was a hit for my memorial day gathering. I did have small lumps in my cream cheese that I thought that I had eliminated prior to adding the condensed milk and lemon juice. I had let it sit on my counter for approx 4 hours and it appeared to be room temp and soft enough, however, it was apparently not enough time. The next time I make this I may stick the cream cheese in the microwave for a few seconds just to be safe. I made mine the night before, however, it was still a little thin. Does anyone know if this is how the dip is suppose to be or there is another trick so that it will be a little thicker the next time? Thanks for this excellent fruit dip.

I've made this many, many times and it's so good!  Sometimes I use vanilla in place of the lemon juice, but it's great both ways.  What's important is that you mix the cream cheese by itself in the beginning...that's how you get rid of the "little bumps" that are bothering some reviewers.  This works for other recipes as well.

Loved it, but it is necessary to use alot more lemon juice, if you want to taste it.  I used 3TBSP's lemon juice and I still could have probably used more.  If I didn't use that much, it would taste good, but it just tasted like condensed milk.

This is delicious.  Not too sweet and a perfect complement to fruit.     I did add another tsp of lemon juice, vanilla and lemon zest.    Let it chill for flavors to blend.   I softened the cream cheese for 40 seconds as suggested by others and it blended very smooth.   I would do this again.

Made this the first time years ago for a wedding.  Everyone wanted the recipes.  The cream cheese has to be soft or it'll come out lumpy.

Amazingly simple to make and tastes great! In addition to the fresh lemon juice, I'll probably add a bit of lemon zest next time to brighten up the flavor a bit. In order to make it smooth, your ingredients need to be at room temperature. Buy the boxed cream cheese in the foil pouch, and soak it in a bowl of hot/warm water for 10-15 minutes, and then knead the pouch a little to test the overall temperature. If it's still cool, you might want to replace the water so it's warm again and soak it for a few minutes more. Once it's at room temperature, mix everything else together. I used a KitchenAid mixer with the paddle attachment, gradually increasing to top speed for about a minute.

I didn't have a full 3-4 hours before I needed to use this, so I popped it in the freezer for about 15-20 minutes, and then put it in the fridge. It thickened up nicely and turned out great! It's better than anything you'll find in the store!

I only used 1/2 can of condensed milk and it was plenty sweet for my very sweet tooth! I also added about 2 tbsp of grenadine to make it a pretty pink color. Everyone was raving about it!

I used fat free cream cheese and fat free sweetened condensed milk. Processed in the food processor. Also added a bit of pink food coloring. Tasted great, a bit gummy, but over all very good.

It is good and delicious.  Very easy to make.  One thing I did not so much appreciate was that it was kind of watery.  But, my kids loved and ate a good amount of fruits, which is good.

I love making this dip because it is so yummy and only takes a few minutes to make!  Definitely make sure you can let it chill in the fridge for a few hours...it's not nearly as good when it is first made as it is a few hours later!

Since this dip is like any cheesecake you must beat it for several minutes in order to get the lumps out and to make it smooth and creamy.

We thought this dip "as is" was too sweet. I added more lemon juice, 1/4 tsp vanilla, and a cup of sour cream and that helped.

Excellent.  All 10 people raved over the fruit dip.  I used 1 tsp vanilla extract instead of the lemon juice and added about 3/4 tsp of freshly grated ginger as well.  It was extraordinary.

I was looking for a fruit dip recipe without marshmallow cream, since I can't find any, and I found this one. I served it as a topping for fresh strawberries and mango: I could have licked my plate clean! It tastes exactly like liquid cheesecake!

Very good fruit dip! We did not wait the 3 hours to eat it,though. We ate it right away. I cut up fresh pineapple and bananas, put a dollop of frozen cool whip on top and drizzled the dip(sauce) over the whole thing, added a cherry. YUMMMM! It was like eating a little heathier ice cream sundae! I will wait the three hours next time to try it the way it was supposed to be.

This recipe was very good and so simple to make.  I took it to work for a pot luck and everyone kept telling me how great it was.  They were surprised to find out the ingredients b/c they all thought it was low fat!  I guess fruit to them = low fat.  The only problem I encountered was that the cream cheese became chunky again after it was chilled (I did use the hand mixer to cream it) and everyone thought it was cottage cheese.  I also added a little more than a teaspoon of lemon juice and it turned out not to be so sweet which was a good compliment to the fruit.

This is a very simple recipe! I didn't want a dip that was super sweet, so I only used half the can of milk. It turned out great!

So very easy.  Yummy.  I got a ton of compliments.  I think next time I want to maybe try adding more lemon juice to give it more flavor...?  But still mmm....

Much too sweet so I added additional lemon juice, better but still overly sweet and needed something else.  Perhaps vanilla.

I was weary about using lemon juice. I added a bit to a spoonful and it was amazing! I ended up using the juice of almost an entire lemon. It is delicious! I'll make it again. :)

Very disappointed with the lumps. I had softened the cream cheese and spread it out with a fork before adding other ingredients . In the end, I used a strainer to get the lumps out. Taste was bland. I read several reviews at this point, and added pineapple juice . That improved the taste. I will not make this dip again.

I followed the recipe exactly, and served it with apple wedges and Nilla Wafers. It was tasty, though with this pairing, I think I would have preferred the dip without the lemon juice. But served with a wider variety of fruits, I think it would be perfect as written.

I needed something fast and simple and had a can of condensed milk so this was really nice.  I had to add more lemon juice to cut some of the richness and it turned out creamy but bright.  Good idea to soften the cream cheese and cream it with a hand mixer before adding the liquids.

Really close to the taste of the fruit dip sold in the produce section at the grocery. We bought whipped cream cheese and didn't have any problems getting the mixture smooth.
I thought it was really good but it was a little too sweet for my wife's taste. If it's too sweet for you, just start with half of the sweetened condensed milk and adjust for your taste!

It smells & tastes like condensed milk - way too sweet & runny for me. I read through the reviews & will try adding more lemon juice/cream cheese/etc. I had no trouble getting everything emulsified. The cream cheese was at room temp & I used an immersion blender - it did take some time & while blending used a spatula to 'mash' the mixture against the side of the bowl to speed up the process.

We loved the flavor and it was really easy to make! We noticed the clumpy consistency too, but I wonder if the acid from the lemon juice is what caused it. I will try vanilla extract instead next time.

This was fabulous!! I searched last minute for a fruit dip which did not contain marshmallows fluff and came across this. I took this to our family Sunday dinner and everyone loved it (kids included). Very quick, easy recipe. I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and used my hand mixer to incorporate all of the ingredients. I had no lumps but it was very thin at first. After 6 hours in the refrigerator it did thicken up. Definitely will be making this again!! Thank you for a wonderful recipe:)

Tasted good, but the consistency was too thin and runny. Maybe decreasing the amount of  sweetened condensed milk would help.

"Lick the Beaters" good!  OMG, this dip would make anything taste good!  I used lower fat cream cheese and added a tsp. of vanilla extract to the batter, but that's it.  I have 2 lbs. of HUGE strawberries all washed and ready to dip!

Just made it with my kids........it was so simple, even they couldn't believe it and they're 3 and 1 yrs old.  They loved licking the beaters and couldn't possibly wait the 3 hours before trying.  I'm sure it will only get better after chilling in fridge and flavours really combine.  This will definitely be a standard in this house........and I'm eager to try an adult version by adding grand marnier as suggested.

Absolutely Fantastic!  Make sure you chill for at least 3 hours... gives the flavors a chance to blend and thickens it up a bit.   I made this for my sister's baby shower and everyone raved! Couldn't be any easier... Thank you!

This was really good.  Everyone liked it and I had no trouble getting it smooth.  All you do is leave the cream cheese out on your counter for an hour ahead of time to soften.  Other reviewers said it was a problem, but I think it is just common sense when you use cream cheese.

I added a teaspoon of vanilla and 1 jar of marshmallow creme, sprinkled the top with cinnamon for garnish.  Served with fresh Bosc pears and strawberries.  YUM!  Can't wait to try adding some peppermint and serving with chocolate and brownies.

I really liked this recipe, as did everyone who tried it.  It was much better the next day.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because I felt it needed a little more lemon.  I Will definatly make again.  Thanks

Very good.  I tried adding a little ginger as one reviewer suggested. It was great.  Also, I had some extra, so I added some whipping cream and diced strawberries, peaches, pineapple and a little coconut - mixed it up and put it in the freezer- it was like homemade fruit ice cream.  Awesome.

Very good dip.  Everyone loved it--my guests made a game out of guessing the ingredients.

I made this for my book club, which is all women who cook and isn't shy to tell me if something isn't good.  Well they ATE almost all of it - I didn't have enough fruit.  And they loved it!!  So it is book club approved.

This was a really great dip. I did change it a bit though based on someone's suggestion. Instead of lemon, I added about a tsp. of vanilla. Turned out great! Yummy! I put it with strawberries and blackberries...

I loved this dip but, then I love condensed milk. I skipped the lemon juice and added fresh vanilla bean and I have also added fresh mint as the third ingredient.  I made it for a party then mixed it with the left over fruit the next day for a salad. You can't go wrong with this dip,
