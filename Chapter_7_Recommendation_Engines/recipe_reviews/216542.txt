I had my doubts about the cilantro and parsley combo, but it totally works. We served this over angel hair pasta, as suggested (12 oz. of pasta for 4 people though), and I added a splash of white wine and a chopped tomato (that needed to be used up), which helped to create a delicious sauce to help condiment the pasta. Everyone enjoyed this, even my picky teenagers! Will make again, thanks!

Very simple and easy to make. I loved the combination, we added some white wine as one of the reviews recommended and it was very good.
