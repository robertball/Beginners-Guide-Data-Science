Instead of melting the chocolate in the microwave, I sprinkled the morsels on top of the hot toffe-coated matzo and let it sit for a minute until they got soft.  Then I spread the chocolate.  This just eliminates an unnecessary step.  I also toasted the pecans before sprinkling on top.  Delicious.

Great recipe, delish dessert for Passover.  I would either increase the number of matzos or decrease the amount of chocolate slightly in this recipe, chocolate overload (if there is such a thing).  Otherwise, these were a hit!  And easy!

20 oz of chocolate seems like too much for 6 matzohs.  Make sure you lightly toast your pecans!! Also make sure you cut them while warm or you'll be sorry! I make something similar, but use light brown sugar, one cookie sheet, 4 unsalted matzos, stir 1 cup chopped pecans into the caramel right before spreading on the matzohs, and bake the caramel on the matzos at 350 for 7 minutes.  Then take out, add 1 cup chocolate chips, put back in oven for 2 minutes, take out, spread, then add sliced almonds and pat them down while chocolate is still wet.  Thanks for posting this variation.  This toffee is worth the effort!!!!  Everyone who tastes it likes it.  Seriously!

I make this with milk chocolate....kids love it more! Also put parchment paper on cookie sheets, it won't stick. I also just put choc chips on top when it's out of oven, once melted, smear with back of a spoon.

I made it a variety of ways, one of which ways to use no topping at all after the margarine/brown sugar combination.  My husband like that the best.  The key to getting the margarine and brown sugar to combine is to constantly stir the mixture.  This is a great Passover dessert after such a big meal.  I served it with a Strawberry Mousse made with a package of strawberries cut in quarters, one egg white and a 1/2C sugar whipped for 15 minutes with a hand mixer and then frozen.

Every time I make this recipe I scale it down to one piece of matzoh and pretend that that's one serving, and end up making more because I'm craving it after its gone!

I tried to substitute olive oil for butter in order to make it parve (non-diary) kosher for Passover.  It did not work.  I ended up burning the sugar, but that was my fault, not the recipe.  Next time I should try it following the recipe exactly.
