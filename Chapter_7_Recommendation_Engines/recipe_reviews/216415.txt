I served this dish for Christmas dinner, and it was a huge hit.  Everyone raved about it.  I made it exactly as written, except for the lemon rind because I didn't have any, and it was absolutely delicious.  The rosemary in the crusty topping adds a nice touch.  I don't like cheesy potato dishes that are swimming in melted gooey cheese sauce.  This has just the right amount of cheese.  I'm saving this one and will make it often!

I made this tonight. It was delicious!! I used Mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar - I can't wait to make it again.

Didn't have any lemon zest, so I just added a couple teaspoons of lemon juice instead.  Otherwise, I made the recipe exactly as stated.  OUTSTANDING!!!!!

Pretty good, although they turned out a little dry so maybe cook time in our oven should be minimized

I love potatoes. Was thinking of cooking something like this and found this recipe. Tried it tonight and even my asian roomate loves it. Added some ground beef into it.

These were delicious! So easy to throw together and the cooking time was spot on. I added just a touch more lemon zest. Will definately make again! Thanks for sharing. :)
