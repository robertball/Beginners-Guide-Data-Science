Loved it!!  I love creole & cajun food, but am not too fond of rice, this was great because the sauce was the right consistency for pasta (which isn't always the case if you swap pasta for rice).  I read all the comments regarding the spiciness and the amount of creole seasoning & saltiness.  I think it has a lot to do the the brand of seasoning you use, as well as your family's tastes.  I  keep 2 or 3 different kinds in the spice rack, they vary greatly in heat, and I know how much of each one my family can tolerate & how salty they are.  I would never put 3T in of a seasoning blend I wasn't familiar with. As it was I used 1T of my hot one to give it heat (we like heat), and 2T of a mild one, to give it a depth of creole flavor besides hot.

Very good recipe! I didn't have creole seasoning so I made up a batch of "Creole Seasoning Blend" - a recipe from this site and only used 1 TBLS of it. Although I thought it was pretty mild - had it been any spicier, my family wouldn't have been able to eat as much as they did. Also, I reduced the garlic powder/lemon pepper seasoning by half (again, to keep it kid friendly) and used regular chicken broth. If you like "spicy" foods, I'd use 2 TBLS of seasoning and if you like it "hot" I'd use all three. Since it was now only mildly spiced, my family gave this dish 2 thumbs up! Thanks Michelle.

This has become a signature dish for me. I use 1 chix breast, 1/2 pound cooked P/d shrimp and Chicken Andouille sausage. I like spicy but also like flavor, I use Zatarain's Creole seasoning and have gotten by with 1 tbsp. I have used Tony Chachere's and gotten by with 1 1/2 tbsp. I use a cup 4% milk for a little creamier sauce. 12oz mushrooms and add yellow pepper as well, instead of Green. I like it best with linguine, but fettuccine works well also. Can also use spiralized zucchini noodles versus the pasta. Real butter unsalted- no marge.

Would not make this again. No one cared for this and ended up throwing it away. Too much preparation and time involved to yield such an unappealing dish.

GREAT!!!!  Very Spicy like it says, I wouldn't reccomend adding the cayenne because that would make it overly spicy, but a really great dish.  Everyone loved it!  Would make it again.

We really liked this!!!  The Man is a huge gumbo fan, and said it 'smelled' like N'Awlins.  Like another reviewer, I didn't have creole seasoning so made up a batch of my own from another recipe from this site.  We also like spicy, so we added a few fresh chiles.  I will make this again.

I reduced the quantity to serve 2 people and at first used 1 1/2 tsp of creole seasoning.  Well I figured I could add the remaining tsp of seasoning to give some more flavour, and WOW!!!  This dish brought some heat, I followed the recipe w/ the exception I didn't add the green onions (due to allergy reasons).  I opted to use baby bella mushrooms, and for the creole seasoning I used the bayou blast that Emeril makes.  Had no trouble w/ the sauce thickening up.  This was a  pretty tasty dish...and wow did I mention it brought some heat?!  Will post a picture.

The flavor combo is excellent however I did not read the reviews beforehand and I agree with many in that it is entirely too salty and I like salt. I'm not sure if it was the creole season I used (Tony's) or the fact that I didn't use low sodium broth? This was my first time to try Andouille and I loved the flavor. I sliced instead of diced it but this would have not altered the flavor of the dish. I will definitely make this again and just cut back on the creole season and use low sodium broth. One other note is that I grilled my sausage first and then just added it in the end but only because I like my sausage really brown/black :)

We loved this spicy pasta dish!  We even added the cayenne pepper. (We're from South Louisiana.)
I would highly recommend this to anyone.

I am totally diggin' the sauce! I used chicken andouille and peas instead of a green pepper. I also added 1/2 a jalapeno, diced. After tasting the chicken at step 2, I decided I needed more spice, so I added more cajun & lemon pepper seasonings and garlic powder. Thank you for a keeper!

Delicious, calorie conscious recipe.  Was very spicy (which is a good thing).  I think it would be much better with fettucini rather than linguine (I will try that next time).  I used "Emeril's Essence" for the Creole seasoning.  Thanks so much for this recipe!!

I could not eat this - waaay too seasoned. I should have read the reviews before trying. Do not use all the seasoning if you are trying this. I love spicy, but this was just too much salty flavoring. Also, ingredients call for margarine but it's listed nowhere in steps

FANTASTIC!!  After reading the reviews, I started with 1 tblspn cajun seasoning, and then tasted and added from there, while it cooked.  I didn't add lemon pepper, just some coarse ground pepper.  I even sprinkled some cayenne pepper on it at the end.  We love spicy food. Anyone who enjoys lots of flavor, it really delivers.  It's been awhile since a dish has excited me, I had to write this review right after eating it.  Delicious.

This is delicious!  I started by making a roux - I skipped the chicken, but sliced and fried the andouille with the onion (I used yellow because we didn't have green), melted a couple of Tablespoons of butter in the pan as well, and then added the flour to that. I added the liquids after cooking the roux and let it boil, then tossed in the rest of the veggies. (I used frozen pepper strips and fresh mushrooms.)  

I didn't have any creole seasoning, so I used: 1 tsp garlic salt, 1 tsp onion powder, 2 tsp Italian seasoning, 2 tsp paprika, and one shake of cayenne.  The flavor was perfect for us! I served it over corkscrew pasta. 

I love that this is a "jambalaya" recipe for pasta.  It's a nice change from the rice!  I'll definitely be adding this to our dinner rotation!

This was so good! I LOVE spicy food and this really hit the spot. I don't like mushrooms so I left those out but followed the recipe on everything else and it was outstanding. Thanks for the great recipe!

My boyfriend and I love this recipe. I've made it with both pasta and rice, and we both agree that using rice is better. Adding a can of tomato paste to the broth gave it a bit more of a bite and thickness...The sauce recipe listed here is just fine, it was just a bit too thin for me. I added quite a bit more creole seasoning and threw in some cayenne pepper as well, because hey...Creole things need to be spicy. ;)

No one at our table could eat this dish due to the extreme amount of salt.  I love salt and use it liberally, but this was too much.  Since it comes from the Creole seasoning, I do not know how to decrease the amount without affecting the flavor.

This was pretty decent. The sauce was a bit more liquidy then I thought it would be. I was expecting something that stuck to the noodles more. Instead it was closer to an egg drop soup consistency.

This was awesome....Recipe made ALOT, so I might recommend cutting it in half if it just you and your spouse eating it.  I made it as the recipe called and we both were able to eat on it for 3 full meals, and still had at least 4 servings left to freeze.  Will definitely make again for a get together or dinner party.

Delicious! This dish was extremely easy and flavorful. It's pretty spicy, so You may want to change the amount of Creole seasoning based on how spicy you like your food. It's also pretty salty, so you may want to try the reduced sodium chicken stock.  All in all, it was an excellent dinner!!

reviewing as I munch :) I didn't have every ingredient...i.e. green onion, used chicken andouille sausage and olive oil served w/ brown rice as I am trying to go healthy. This is delicious...I made my own cajun seasoning that was pretty power packed...didn't bother w/ additional garlic powder (since my seasoning already had it as well as pepper...so skipped the lemon pepper...might have added a squeeze of lemon had I had one. I'd make this again. It was plenty spicy and I really enjoyed it as I do like spicy food!

This recipe was awesome!  I made as written.   I love everything spicey, this receipe is definitely very spicey as written!!  I would say probably too spicey for most.  If you just cut down the Creole to maybe half that would lessen the heat.  Sauce thickened up nice.  Definitely will be making this again...just probably a little less heat so the rest of the family can eat it :)

Love, love, love this recipe as is. Modifications we have subsequently incorporated are: Fresh lemon instead of lemon pepper, fresh garlic instead of garlic powder and we add extra hot cayenne powder.

This was delicious!!!  We made one alteration which was purely to suit our tastes by substituting two anaheim peppers for the bell peppers.  It was creamy, spicy and very satisfying!!!  We didn't have any problems with the seasonings... we kind of just tossed them in there in approximate amounts...  We used a Cajun seasoning blend from a grocery store in our area which worked great...

Family loves this dish!  Changes I made:  use penne pasta, cut back creole seasoning to about 1 1/2 tablespoons, use minced garlic instead of garlic powder and leave out lemon pepper.  Sometimes use turkey sausage instead of andouille.  We live in Southeast Texas but are from Louisiana, so we eat lots of cajun food.  I make my own "creole seasoning" without salt, and the 1 1/2 tablespoons of seasoning is plenty for us.  Adjust accordingly.

It was alright. Rather spicy, but didn't have too much flavor. My sauce was thick enough; there wasn't any trouble there. However, I'm not crazy about Creole food. If you're fond of this kind of food, I really think you'll like it. Follow the recipe as is, but you might cut down on the creole seasoning if you're using extra spicy sausage.

I made this last night as a Valentine's and Mardi Gras combined celebration dinner. It is amazing! What a fun new way to eat Cajun!  I used freshly roasted chicken (adding it after I cooked the sausages and veggies) because I already had the cooked chicken. We all really loved this recipe!

Regarding the saltiness...I make my own Emeril's Creole Seasoning and cut the salt WAY DOWN, so it wasn't too salty for us...if you buy it, you might want to taste test it along the way...that being said, this was fantastic and I even added more heat with red pepper flakes and a dash of Cayenne (we like it spicy).  My hubby manages an Italian restaurant and gets enought pasta THERE so I served it over rice.  I used regular smoked sausage instead of Andouille b/c that's what I had and it was fine.  GR8 cajun/creole recipe!  Thank you!!

Great Recipe!  I used 2 Tablespoons of Creole Seasoning. Perfect for us. Also instead of using cornstarch and water, I added 2 Tablespoons of Wondra Flour to the 1 cup of milk, whisked together. We served this delicious dish over  Zatarains Yellow Rice, a family favorite.  YUM! This is a KEEPER!

Let me just tell ya'll this.....my family and I LOVE cajun style foods.  Well to make a long story short - my husband of 28 years ate this and proposed to me....again....my dog ate a few of the noodles that "accidentally" dropped on the floor and spoke "human" words (hahaha...just kidding there but he was a happy dog!)....this dish is DEFINITELY a keeper!  The hardest part to preparing this dish is the wait!  All I served with it was french bread..I mean, you can't eat a cajun meal WITHOUT french bread! LOVED it and you Michelle!  Thanks for sharing this girl!  You rock!

This wasn't bad. I followed the recipe exactly, except I left out the mushrooms, as I don't care for them. I even tried the suggestion of adding a bit of cayenne pepper. The amount of spice was perfect, however, I'm not sure if I cared for the sauce in general. It reminded me of gravy, but I suppose that is because of it's color. Also, where do the 2 tablespoons of margarine come in to play? I'm guessing when you cook the sausage and chicken, but the recipe doesn't say.  Not sure if I'd make this one again, but it was a nice way to spruce up the ol' linguine.

Made this without milk and used Cajun spice, not Creole (which I couldn't find at the market), and cut the recipe for about 2. My husband loved it (so did I) and asked to have it again. Great!

My boyfriend complimented me to death about this dish and it was a last minute decision for me!  We wanted to spice up some chicken tenders, so I just used chicken cut into strips without the sausage.  I also didn't have mushrooms, but added about half a can of cream of mushroom soup since some had mentioned that the sauce needed more thickening.  I ended up adding more water and cornstarch because it got a little salty (but my boyfriend LOVES salt!) Other than that we have a ton left over to pour over rice or pasta for tomorrow!

I really enjoyed this recipe. The creole seasoning I used is naturally very spicy so I only used half and it was still WAY to hot...But boy was it good. Next time I plan on using penne pasta...the linguine kept falling off of my fork!!!

This was a perfect meal. We doubled the recipe for lunch the next day. I did make 3 changes... 1. Instead of cornstarch, I used whole wheat flour to thicken the sauce. 2. I doubled the amount of spices. 3. I used Chicken Andouille Sausage since we don't eat pork. Tasted great! This one is a keeper for sure! Thank you for such a delicous & easy recipe!

Take this with a grain of salt - I changed this by making it cajun instead of creole. I just really wanted a cajun dinner :) Also, I did not use any dairy or corn starch. And this uses a LOT of onion - I was going to use just 3, but I stopped after 2 because it adds quite a bit. Also, for me personally the pieces of the peppers are really big, but my bf loves them like that. Anyway, even cajun this was delicious. I absolutely love andouille sausage and chicken together. I definitely recommend.

I used andouille removed from the casing and I didn't have any bell peppers.  I added fresh green beans and used portabello mushrooms.  Very fattening but very delicious.

This was wonderful!  I didn't have Creole, so used Cajun and a little Cayenne instead. Also couldn't find any regular andouille so used Hillshire farms smoked andouille style.  This is a keeper!

Pretty good.  It seemed to me that the majority of the flavor came from the creole seasonings and not necessarily the andouille.  I will make again, but will omit the andouille and just have chicken creole pasta as a much healthier option.

This is a very good dish! I followed the recipe exactly except for using what was left of three different packages of spaghetti. Sixteen oz. of spaghetti would be too much. This would be a great recipe for company; all you need to add is a green salad and garlic bread for a complete meal.

Very good taste but way too goopy.  If I make it again I will cut the sauce in half or double the meat and vegs.

This is excellent.  Whatever you do, don't use anything but no sodium or low sodium broth because it will be way too salty. Will make this one again.

I can't knock it for this but WOW, was this spicy!  And I cut down on the Cajun seasoning.  If you could get beyond the nuclear fallout in your mouth, this was good.  Not sure I'll make it again but to make it family friendly, REALLY cut down on the heat!

This is a great recipe. The only variation i made to this was substituting shrimp for the sausage. Both ways are fantastic just depends on the mood you are in.

I was really looking forward to making this after reading all the reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly, but it just wasn't all that impressive.  We love spicy food, but this just wasn't all that special.  We didn't even keep the leftovers.  I won't be making it again.

Man. I am stuffed! I just got done eating this and it was awesome! It took a moderate amount of time to cook, about an hour and 15min. Most of that time was spend chopping veggies-easy enough to do. I cant believe that the only spices in this are creole seasoning and chili powder (i used about 1 tbs of creole, so that it wouldnt be overly spicey, and then made it up to the heat i wanted by adding chili powder) This tastes like a lot more would go into it, very yummy! The veggies can be customized to whatever you're in the mood for and same with the pasta. I wasn't able to find andoullie sausage so I just used italian, and it came out really good. I didn't find this to be overly salty and I used Tony's Creole seasoning. I will make this again for sure, it was really good.

I am sorry, but this dish was way too salty for my taste. Maybe it was my brand of Cajun seasoning. The only change I made to the original recipe was using freshly grated lemon peel and fresh ground pepper instead of the lemon pepper seasoning. I liked the spicyness of this dish, but the saltiness really turned me off. Maybe I will try it again using my own blend of spices instead of store bought seasoning so I can control the amount of salt.

This dish was pretty good. I too cut back on the Creole because I am just wimpy but the flavor was still very nice. I made it with penne. Next time I will try this with different veggies and maybe add a touch of cheddar cheese to the sauce.

I've made this SEVERAL times this past year, and can only say that it is WONDERFUL!  And yes, a ps to non-Cajuns, it is a little spicey, so don't forget the bread.

This recipe had a very nice flavor and though it was spicy, it wasn't overpowering.  It's very colorful and looks quite appetizing which is more than half the battle!  However, I would never have thought to serve the sauce over pasta.  It's much too like a gravy that seems more appropriate over mashed potates or rice.  As far as the sauce is concerned, I wouldn't change a thing.  Thank you for sharing!

We love spicy foods and liked this dish.  I had a hard time figuring out what consistency the sauce should be, so I added more cornstarch to thicken it some.  I would fix this again.

I'm from Mobile which has a strong Cajun influence. This tastes like  home!!! The only thing I substituted was fresh garlic for garlic powder. My favorite creole seasoning is Tony Chachere's. Never fails. To cut down on prep time, I cut vegetables up the day before. Great recipe!

Delicious, I doubled the recipe for our large family. Good thing I didn't completely double the Cajun seasoning, SPICEY.  we like spicy but it was too much. Next time I will use 1/2 of the Cajun spice. I also added corn, WHY, because I had some.

The fam and I really enjoyed this. Just enough heat to have the family grinning at each other. Used Chorizo because I didn't have any Andouille and I love Chorizo. I'm not sure what the other reviews did to make it so salty, ours was fine, didn't add any salt though. Would definitely make again. Might use cream instead of milk just to make it well, creamier:)

We had this yesterday - really enjoyed it! We husband is not fond of spicy, so I used 1 T. cajun seasoning (homemade). I had leftover chicken breast, so chopped it and added it before the broth & milk. Used penne pasta in accordance with some reviews. The consistency of the sauce was perfect for us.

I made my own cajun seasoning and instead of chicken I put a 1/2 cup of shrimp. I didn't have chicken broth and left out the lemon pepper and I'm not a fan of mushrooms. Can I say this is spicy and awesome? I always order a cajun pasta in restaurants but now that I know how to make it I definitely will be picking something else!!

Very yummy if you LOVE spicy food! I followed the recipe exactly and think I might try it over rice next time to soak up more of the delicious sauce (it's not a very thick sauce). I may also add shrimp next time to add a little texture. Also, I had to transfer mine to a stock pot because it made so much....next time I'll just start with the bigger pot. Overall, very good!

Flavor was ok but there was a lot of "sauce" so much that the chicken and sausage tasted boiled like it was boiled in water. Mushy texture. My fiance and i couldnt eat it.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe.  I reduced the amount of cajon seasoning as we are not fans of extremely hot spices.  This has become a fan favorite with friends.

this was sooo good.  i'd say it was about 4.5 stars.  i only used half the recommended creole seasoning, and it was still very spicy. used 33% less sodium chicken broth.  i also, love the consistency, but i think i may use a little cream (vs. water + starch) next time. instead of water, i used 1/2 c milk and starch.  just a thought.  thanks for the recipe.

The flavor in itself was good, but this was way too salty for me (and I like spicy foods). The next time I'll reduce the amount of Creole seasoning to 1 TB. That should make it perfect for me :-)

My hubby really loved this. I thought it needed a little work from a flavor stand point and consistency.  Thought it needed some depth and it didn't thicken like it should.  I followed the recipe as written. Next time will try adding the celery and making rouex instead of the cornstarch as some have suggested. I think the sausage needed really browned before adding the chicken to give the sauce some color.   Also, both of us thought it would be better over rice instead of pasta.

great proportions, not in love with the sauce. would be better (while worse for you) with a heavy cream sauce, scratch the cornstarch. but the flavor was yummmmmy! will thicken the sauce next time.

Fantastic! You can adjust the spice so don't be afraid to try this if you have people who can't handle the heat. Made this for New Year's Eve and everyone loved it - the kids had it the next day, and my 6yo wants it again! I used Emeril's Southwest Essence for the Creole, to 'control' the heat, and used red, orange, & yellow peppers & no mushrooms. Served it with penne.

Preperation and cook time  totaled 2 hrs.   some instructions were missing from this recipe.    I cut the chicken breasts into chunks instead of strips because I have a large family. I also seasoned the chicken breasts with seasoning salt, garlic salt, pepper to taste with a little virgin olive oil and mixed well before cooking.  I added the margarine in as I added the veggies. Overall it was liked by the family (kids ages range from 5-14)  I

I made this on one of the coldest days in NC.  As the recipe states, this dish is very spicy, so I added a teaspoon of sour cream right before serving and it was perfect.  I will make this again, but not when we have warm weather.

I used 2 T of creole seasoning and it was just right for our palates.  We loved this dish.  With a little extra chicken broth this would be a great souped-up chicken soup.

I love this recipe!  I took the advice of others and used only 1 T of creole seasoning and it was still plenty spicey.  I also added an extra link of Andouille because we love it.  Very tastey meal and makes a TON!

I loved this recipe! It took longer than 45 min. though i'd say closer to an hour. i also made it very spicy by adding lots of cayenne pepper, red pepper flakes, season salt, onion powder, and black pepper. It turned out great!

My family loved this recipe. I had never made "creole" anything and was very pleased with the results. I made the recipe as is, with the exception of rice instead of pasta and chicken italian sausage instead of andouie (I had it on hand.) I made the creole seasoning from a recipe on this site. Great fat Tuesday meal!

This was pretty good, just seemed to be missing a lil something.  Topped with grated parmesan.  Maybe will add 1/4 or so of parmesan to the sauce next time.

I would say if you used a homemade version of Creole spice without salt this would be great.  But, as is, it is too salty.

Very delicious, hearty and spicy. I played around with the veggies a little to suit my own tastes, but made everything else as-is. As someone stated the sauce would be well-suited for rice or potatoes - I think next time I'll try this over some oven-roasted potatoes, with a crusty loaf of bread to soak up the sauce. Thanks so much for sharing :)

I was really tasty, not too spicy, but I think I would have liked the sauce to be a little thicker.  Maybe with a cheese involved.  A little parm or maybe monterey to thicken it up and give it a different texture.

Spectacular recipe! Always good to find creole/cajun recipes with good taste and some bite to them! My boyfriend and I gobbled this up! I'm a lover of pasta and creole so the mixture of the two was perfect to me!

Very spicy!  I loved it!  My family really enjoyed it as well...great way to mix things up during the week and easy to prepare.  Will definately have to make this again.

Woo,this was spicy! Of course,we're in the Pacific Northwest, and we don't see a lot of spicy food up here. I will probably decrease the amount of Creole seasoning if I make this again. I used chicken andouille sausage. A friend of ours had the leftovers and said it was really delicious too.

This was delicious! Very spicy if following recipe.  I think my family would prefer this with rice and when I make it next time will use rice. It makes a large amount of food and reheats very well.

I am from Texes and we like our Creole recipies hot and spicy.  This ranked a 1 for spicy for my family, kids included. We found it to be flavorful and will make it a lot at our house.  I added some fire to it.  There was plenty left over for the next day too!
