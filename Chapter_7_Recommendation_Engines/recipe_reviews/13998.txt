I have made this a few times--one time I substituted a different cheese (tasted much better to me with the Parmesan) and one time I intentionally made the zucchini chunkier (so so much better if they're thinly sliced as directed).  So I prefer this recipe as is!  My preschooler helps me make it, it's so easy.

This turned out to be a very good side dish, and reviewers helped to make that happen.  I only made 1/2 of the original recipe, and for my 1/2 recipe I only used 1/8 cup of oil.  Used lower fat Bisquick, and added garlic powder and liquid hot pepper sauce (for a little kick).  Also sprinkled the top with black pepper.  Omitted any salt and didn't miss it (plenty of sodium in the Bisquick and cheese!).  Do try this.  It is GOOOD!!!

Boy! did my husband like this one.  I used Bisquick and also sauteed the onion first (we like it well cooked) and it was delicious.

This was an excellent recipe.  Quick and Easy.  The kids liked it a bunch. My husband and I enjoyed it.  I did bake it 5 minutes longer to get it a little browner.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and Bisquick Heart Smart to make it healthier and it tasted awesome.  Thanks for this recipe.

This was very tasty. I added some garlic and tabasco sauce to pep this up a bit. I also reduced amount of cheese to 1/4 cup and reduced oil to 1/4 cup as well.. very tasty still an lower fat and lower calories. I also used egg beaters and reduced fat/calorie bisquick.

I thought this was very good as is, but I also layered some sliced tomato in it and loved that.  It's a good recipe to use up garden veggies.

since my husband has to watch his cholesterol, I only put 2 whole eggs in,and just the whites of the other two. I also added about half a cup of grated, colby/jack cheese We thought it was delicious. I will make it again, since he is growing zucchini

What a nice picture, if I do say so myself. (yeah, gratuitous pat on my back for a good food picture)
I liked this recipe quite a lot though I think I will continue to try and refine it.  I topped it with sliced roasted red peppers and that added a nice taste.  Next time I'll dice them and mix them in.  I also added a half teaspoon of cayenne.  
My food processor was very helpful to make this.  I used the slicer blade for the zucchini and the shredder side of the blade for the onion.  I baked it longer than recommended and it still didn't seem 'set' in the center.  I've since tried making it in a muffin pan thinking that would alleviate the mushiness but it didn't.  Next time I'm spreading the stuff into a cookie sheet and baking it that way.

I enjoyed this dish!  And it's very pleasing to the eye and nose as you take it out of the oven.  I kept in mind the previous reviews written here.  I cooked it about 10 minutes longer so that it browned nicely and I added a 'kick' to it.  Well, I added just a little more cheese, salt, other spices.  I ate the leftovers cold for a snack.  YUM!

Very yummy!! I used Bisquick and added mozzarella cheese fresh tomatoes across the top. While I was making this I was thinking it wasn't going to turn out well, but I was wrong.

I would trade the buttermilk baking mix for 1/2 c bread crumbs, and instead of vegetable oil, reduce to 1/4 c (or less!) olive oil.  As another review suggested, I added 1/2 tsp of cajun seasoning and it had the perfect amount of zip.  I added a pound of pre-cooked mild chicken sausage from Costco to make it more of an entree.  Sprinkled very lightly with a shredded colby jack and ground black pepper prior to baking.  Extended baking time to 40 minutes and it turned out beautiful.  Tasted great!

I also doctored it to taste and had to cook it longer. I halved the recipe, added mozzarella, my homemade Italian Seasoning, 3 big cloves of garlic (I'm a garlic lover) and sundried tomatoes. I left out the salt (we can't have it) added fresh cracked black pepper. It ended up being fantastic.

This was really yummy with a bit of flavor doctoring, and I would have given it 5 stars for sure if not for that.

I did add some garlic and seasoned bread crumbs, and sprinkled more Parmesan on top along with Italian seasoning. I also found I needed about an extra 15 min baking time even after preheating the oven.  So easy and a great way to use up the bountiful supply of summer zucchini! Thanks for posting

I liked it a lot. I did make some changes. I wanted to add mozzarella cheese but was out so added shredded Monterey Jack Cheese. I used garlic salt instead of regular salt. I baked it for 45 min like some other reviewers suggested. Also, because I was having a conversation with a friend, I forgot to add the vegetable oil that the recipe calls for. But the Zippy Zuchini came out delicious (and less fattening)anyway. I fed two 7 year olds and they loved it and had seconds. There wasn't any left.  We had it as a main meal.

Yum-o!  We're new to zucchini but really enjoyed this recipe!  We added 2 cloves of minced garlic and sauteed it with the onion before baking.  Also eliminated the cheese due to a milk allergy in the family (used Bisquick - it's milk-free).  Loved it!

Loved it! The bottom element in my stove went out, so I thought this would be a good side dish for the microwave.  I cut up half of a giant zucchini I had.  I didn't have parm. cheese, so I used sharp cheddar.  I microwaved it for about 20 min., then put more cheese on top and put it back in for a couple more minutes.  Easy, quick and tasted great!

Very tasty and easy.  Used a mandoline to slice zucchini very fast and evenly.  I have an abundance of jalapenos in my garden, so added 2 seeded and minced red ones for heat and color.  Next time, will add zucchini after other ingredients are combined, because the baking mix stuck to zucchini slices.  Used butter flavor baking spray on pan, used liquid egg substitute for whole eggs, left out salt, and added fresh ground black pepper to taste to individual servings.  I am vegetarian, so I sprinkled about 2/3 cup of shredded mozzerella on top for the last few minutes, for more protein.  Served this with crusty garlic bread and a glass of wine.  As a one dish meal, it easily served 6.

It's a hit! Even my preschooler loved it. Instead of baking mix, I used pancake mix to give a hint of sweetness. Garlic salt instead of salt, omitted the onions, added 1 Tbs hot sauce. I baked it for 45 minutes to get it all the way set up inside and a little brown on top.

Came out really good.  Was scared about the consistency and zucchini to bisquick ratio, but it came out great.  Like other reviewers, we let it bake for 40 minutes, so the middle wasn't too mushy.  We used the heart-healthy bisquick and didn't use salt (although, I was missing some salt at the end).  All and all, came out great, will make again!

I followed the directions exactly and when mixing everything up I had my reservations.  As others said it needed some kick, I added fresh garlic to the cooking process as well as crushed black pepper.  It did need 10 more minutes in the oven.  It did get nice and brown.  Upon tasting it, it still needed something more, too bland.  Added some Red Hot and that helped.  I am hoping it tastes better the second day as there are plenty of leftovers.

Simple and delicious!  Once the kids try it (tell them to ignore the fact that there's green in it), their faces tell all. . .not bad!  Perfect for those weeknights when you are running late but want to add a vegetable that EVERYONE will love to the meal.  Thanks

I love this recipe, and have adapted it to suit my tastes. I cut back on the zucchini, and added sauted garlic, onion, red pepper, black olives, shredded baby spinach, oh, and mushrooms. I drain the saute mix on a paper towel to get as much olive oil out as possible, the add to mix with one sliced zucchini. Delicious. I have made it several times and shared it with the girls at work. They love it. My husband....not so much.

I found it to be dull & a bit dry.  It certainly needs some zest of sorts. I did grill the onions first.

This was delicious and a great way to use up the zucchini in my garden. After reading other reviews, I changed up the recipe as follows: I added 1 jalapeño pepper and sauteed it along with the onion before adding them to the rest of the ingredients. Since I'm a vegetarian, I wanted to include more protein, so I chopped up 1 tofurky italian sausage link into small pieces and added it, plus I put in a couple drops of Chipotle pepper sauce to give it some zip. I didn't have any cheese in the house, but I can imagine that would've made it just perfect.

This is a great starter recipe. The changes I made were slight. I purged the zuccini, place the thin sliced zuccini on a plate lightly salt place a second plate on top and weight it down let sit for 20 minutes sqeeze off juices, it makes it lighter and cooks perfectly. I did not put any salt in the recipe because the purging adds salt. I did put a little creole to give it a zip.

The title and picture is what drew me to this.  After making, I'm not sure where the red in the picture came from - mine looked nothing like this when done. I only had 2 zucchini which I chopped instead of sliced. I cut the recipe in half except followed the suggestion of others to add garlic powder and only 1/8c oil.  I added a little Emeril's Essence and sprinkled the top with pepper.   Still a little on the bland side, so next time I'll go heavier on the spices.  Overall, pretty good and my very picky 11yr old even tried it and liked it which says alot!

This was ok. I give it 4 stars though for the potential. It is a great starting point to add whatever flavors or extra ingredients you may want to add. I made it exactly as is, as I pretty much always do with any recipe. Once I know how it comes out I will then modify accordingly. Next time I will definitely add some tomatoes and something else (hot sauce or red pepper flakes maybe) for some kick. It was a little one dimensional in flavor.

Modified this for a quick main course by adding about one pound of italian sausage squished out of the casing and browned and very well drained and dabged with paper towels to remove oils. To handle the reported blandness factor I added about a tablespoon of bottled 'sweet/hot red peppers' easily found in the condiments area or at the 99cent stores.  Followed the advice of others and cooked 40min.  I also sweated the zucchini by sprinkling with salt after slicing and pressing with paper towels to remove excess water.  Turned out darn near perfect.  This will work great for potlucks or even an emergency brunch!!

I agree with all the prior reviews of it being slightly bland.  Great recipe to start from though, has some great elements that make it a little different.  I also accidentally made it with corn bread mix instead of buttermilk, but it turned out pretty good.  So, I will surely try it again but will be more creative :)

This was just o.k..  It definately needs some seasoning, very bland.  I would recommend adding something to this for seasoning.  I gave it 3 stars because my gf seems to like it.

This was very easy and I loved that the fresh zucchini taste wasn't overpowered by the other ingredients.  It was a great side dish!

The first time I made this I didn't have biscuit mix in the house, so I took some tips from other reviews and used bread crumbs, added tabasco, some herbs and garlic  also a few cherry tomatoes for color, and it was wonderful! Next time I used the biscuit mix and it seemed soggy and heavy, though browned top and bottom. So next time I will go back to bread crumbs.

I found that cooking it a bit longer than suggested was what worked for me.  Our zucchinni here in Alaska are very large (over a foot long) and it was hard to gauge how much I had to use to equal the amount called for. My husband, son and myself really liked it.  My daughter thoght it was "OK".
