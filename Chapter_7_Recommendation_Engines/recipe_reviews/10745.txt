A little addition to the timing debate--I still have my mother's recipe from 30 years ago and it stresses that you need to bring this recipe to a ROLLING BOIL and then time your minute. If you begin timing when the recipe "just boils" you won't get the same texture or set.  Once you hit a full, rolling boil, time for one minute. It's never failed me.  

There are a few variations on this recipe, but this one is probably my favorite. I prefer the texture you get when you add the peanut butter after removing from heat as opposed to boiling it with the sugar, etc.  I also prefer the cocoa added in the beginning, but other good recipes call for it at the end.  Different strokes!

This is an old familiar favorite of mine since childhood.  However, we called them Grandma's "Boiled Cookies," simply because she boiled them on the stovetop.

My Grandmother used the exact same ingredients and exact same amounts.  However, boiling time is crucial and essential.  We add the Peanut Butter with the other ingredients to boil (milk, butter/oleo, sugar, cocoa, salt) and bring the mixture to a hard boil over a medium flame(roughly, 4 - 5 minutes from beginning to boil).  We were too poor to afford a candy thermometer, I suppose.  THIS IS WHERE GRANDMA TOLD ME THAT THE TEXTURE PROBLEM LIES - " ... Too little boiling time, runny/wet & unable to set properly (because the mix did not reach high enough temperature to become the confection); while too much time produced dry & crumbly cookies (result of too hot too long, burning off moisture)."

Also, I choose to use Super Chunky peanut butter for more peanut texture and Grandma is probably rolling in her grave, but it defintely works for me!

Then, after we remove the boiling mixture from the flame and stir in the vanilla and quick oats (one-minute), spooning out mixture onto wax-paper lined cookie sheets.  Also, I've noticed that if I use baking/cooling racks, these tend to cool and set a little more rapidly.  So, if you're like me and can't wait ... 

I've never had a soft batch.  They're definitely one of my all-time favorites.  Not to mention the favorites of any guests and all of my neices and nephews!

I have made these no-bakes many times successfully. I always boil for about 2 minutes (candy thermometer reads about 210-120 which is above jelly stage but below thread stage).  I find that I have enough time to drop all the cookies without them getting hard, but they will start to jell near the end.  Have ready a couple of cookie sheets lined with wax paper so that you can drop them all without any hardening.  Another tip: make sure peanut butter and oats are measured and ready to go once your timer goes off at 2 minutes. The final product is shiny and chewy but no where near gooey.  And yes, they are sweet, but they are so yummy!

I love these cookies, but I'm too lazy to use the stove so I microwave them instead.  Put everything but the oats, pb and vanilla in a bowl and cook for 3 1/2 minutes, stir and then cook for 3 1/2 more minutes and stir in the oats and stuff.  I've also done it once where I left out the cocoa and microwaved the rest but at the end I added oats and cut up peanut butter cups and they melted beautifully.

The 1 minute boiling time is not long enough for these cookies to harden.  I tried this recipe a number of times following the directions exactly, but my cookies are always mush.  I found many other recipes for these cookies that say to boil for 2 minutes.  I tried this and my cookies turned out much better!

LOVE THE QUICKNESS!!  We opened a store 4 weeks ago & everyone has been asking for homemade cookies.  I tried these thinking no one would really buy them because they are so easy to make anyone can make them.  Guess Again!!  I have been making 4 batches of these a day & am still running out!!  The only thing I noticed about these cookies were the longer you stir the batter the duller looks wise they get.  My first batch turned out somewhat shiny looking when set...the second set looked really dry (stirred alot)...dull in color.  So don't stir alot!  These are the easiest quickest HOT SELLING cookies I have ever made.  Thanks!!

If you like sweet stuff, this is the perfect recipe!  As others had suggested I used whole milk, cut sugar back to 1 1/2 cups, and boiled for at least 2 minutes.  Unfortunately for my thighs they turned out perfectly!

These cookies were a smashing success at a recent potluck.  People inhaled them and I got several requests for the recipe and a mock proposal of marriage.  Instead of using the full two cups of sugar, I followed others' suggestions and only used 1 1/2 cups.  Also, I boiled the liquid mixture for 2 minutes instead of 1 and they turned out fine.  I even used 1% milk and reduced fat peanut butter and still everyone loved them.  A recipe I'll definitely use again.

This is a great version of these cookies. Make these a lot, but could not find such a good recipe. The only change I made, was that I cooked them for exactly 3 1/2 minutes once the mixture started boiling and they always turn out perfect.

Thanks everyone for suggesting 3 minutes--they turned out perfectly. For anyone who likes them a little less sweet like I do, I put 1 1/3 cups sugar and they were perfect! YUM!

These are great cookies!  I end up boiling them for about 2-3 minutes to make sure they harden up well.  Instead making cookies out of these, I just dump the batter in a 9 x 13 pan, throw in the freezer for 15 minutes then just cut into squares.  I have also doubled the amount of cocoa for extra fudgy cookies.  They are quick, easy, everybody loves these!

This is THE PERFECT no bake cookie recipe. It is a perfect balance of peanut butter and chocolate--you can taste them both, but neither overpower the other. It is CRUCIAL to follow the directions about timing 1 minutes after liquid comes to a full, rolling boil. If you are a new cook, that means when the entire surface of the liquid is covered with bubbles. It's also important to use a pot with a level bottom so that the entire mixture gets heated evenly. I have some older pots that are warped that I use for abusive dishes like mashed potatoes, but that kind cannot make good no bake cookies. Stir, stir, stir in the peanut butter quickly, add the oats, then spoon them out as quickly as possible. If you leave the cookie mix lingering in the hot pan they will become dry and hard, just as if you overcooked them. Sounds complicated, but once you figure it out, you will have the best no bake cookies on the block!

I'm rating 2 stars because they left an essential part of the recipe out - YOU ARE TO STIR CONSTANTLY FROM BEGINNING TO END!!!  Omit the salt, up the Hershey's cocoa to 5 tbls. Once it starts to boil, boil for 2 minutes. CONSTANTLY stirring.  When 2 minutes are up, remove from heat and quickly add the peanut butter (off brands work better) 1 minute quick oats and vanilla. Stir well.  Drop onto waxed paper and let them set up in the refrigerator.  Also store in refrig. or cold pantry.  We've been making these since the 60's.  And they always come out great.  Another tip:  when they start to boil, turn down the heat just enough to keep it rapidly boiling.  Some people don't understand that the heat doesn't have to be kept on HIGH to keep it boiling.  Also, when starting to make, mix the sugar and cocoa well, get it wet with the milk, then add the stick of butter to the pan.  Stir till it starts to boil, put on timer for 2 minutes, keep stirring until timer goes off.  Quickly add the last 3 ingredients. Mix well and drop and don't stop.  If you would find the mixture is hardening before you are done dropping - return to stove, add a little milk, stir until it's wet again.  New cooks seem to have this problem.  UPDATE:  Don't boil 4-5 minutes.  This is BAD for the sugar content.  ALSO - measure the oats in a one cup meas. cup 3 times rather than your large 4 cup measuring cup.  It's more exact.  Have everything pre-measured and cookie sheets ready before you even start to cook.

I first made this recipe in Home Ec class when I was in high school many, many years ago.  This is a perfect no fuss recipe with basic ingredients and I make it often in the summer so I won't have to turn on the oven.  I have made it with crunchy peanut butter too, and it tastes just as good as it does with smooth!

Update: My addiction to these cookies continues to thrive. In the mean time I have been playing around with the measurements of the ingredients to see how much I can reduce the fat and sugar without compromising the taste and texture. So far I have successfully made these cookies with as little as 1 cup of sugar and 1/8 of a cup of butter with everything else remaining the same. Surprisingly the cookies came out just as moist and sweet as all the other batches I have made yet so much healthier (relatively speaking)!

This recipe is just amazing, I might be addicted. I've made these cookies three times in two weeks already! Every time I'm amazed by how fast and easy they are to make. They come out perfectly moist every time!

This recipe makes perfect cookies every time!!! They key is to bring your ingredients to a boil at medium heat instead of high, and don't start you minute until it is a rapid boil. They remind me of the cookies my mom used to make:)

Absolutely perfect!!!  I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out perfect.  Took the advice from another review and waited until it reached a full rolling boil before starting the 1 minute timer.  Also, before boiling the other ingredients, I measured out the oats, then plopped the peanut butter on top of them, made a dent in the middle of the peanut butter & poured the vanilla in it.  This way it was easy to add all 3 of these ingredients immediately after removing the pan from the heat.  They turned out perfect - set up nicely, and were not too dry nor too gooey.  My husband wants me to make these every week now!

I followed the recipe exactly and the consistency was perfect!  However, after I took it off the stove I added 1/2 cup coconut instead of the peanut butter.  That is my memory of no-bakes..coconut and oatmeal with the chocoloate.  Fabulous!

I have been making a version of these cookies for over 50 years since my aunt Ida taught me how to make them when I was 8 years old. There are a couple of things that I suggest to make them easier and better. First, don't use margarine. These are far better with butter. Second, use 5 tablespoons of cocoa rather than 3. 

For ease of mixing, add the peanut butter when you take the boiling mixture off the heat. Completely mix it in before you add the vanilla. Adding vanilla immediately causes the alcohol in the vanilla to boil and evaporate and the flavor isn't as good. Finally, add the oats. 

I use parchment paper rather than wax paper and I don't use cookie sheets - I just lay the paper on the countertop.

ALWAYS tasty!  I usually make mine in a sheet pan & cut them in little squares to save time.  Great flavor & texture.  My only suggestion, use a good quality oat (Quaker, etc.)...I tried once with generic brand and it just wasn't the same.  Yummy, thanks for the memories!

Made these last night to bring into work today.  Pretty good!  SUGGESTION: Pre-measure all your ingredients before you start!!  I used 4 TBS of cocoa, used NO salt, and forgot to add the vanilla (pre-measured sitting right in front of my face and i spaced on adding it).  Dont think the vanilla woulda changed the taste much.  Still turned out great.  I was out of wax paper so instead of making them drop cookies, I spread the mixture onto a non-stick cookie sheet and let it cool overnight.  This morning, I cut it up with a spatula (a wet knife just wasnt working) and plated them up.  Been at work almost 2hrs - All the cookies are gone!   
After eating 1 1/2 cookies myself, I wish I had some milk right about now!  :)

Very tasty no bake cookie. My son begged me to make these and I couldn't find my recipe, so I used this one. Great flavor. Easy to make, quick and no need to heat up the kitchen or dirty a lot of dishes. We do this the easy way and pour it all out into a rectangle shape, cool, then cut into bars. Thanks, this is just what I was looking for.

My 11 year old and I made this recipe as written (except we used skim milk).  When the chocolate mixture reached a rolling boil, we timed exactly 90 seconds and then added the peanut butter, vanilla, and oats.  We scooped them out with a cookie scoop and they came out uniform and set up perfectly.  Nice and shiney.  We made a second batch with equally successful results.  So good!

A very good recipe!  My husband's grandmother use to make these too!  It is so simple and the ingrediants are  readily available.  Make sure to reach a hard boil before timing, and don't cook less than a minute!  Trust me on this one!

I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cup because some reviews say it's too sweet and i used butter instead of margarine. Scooped them right away and put in the fridge for a little bit. They came out perfect, held up just fine.. not falling apart or too soft like some reviews say. So easy and yummy!!!

These are a family favorite and one of the first cookies I taught my daughters to make. To the person who said the boiling time is not enough, I've been making these for over 40 years and have discovered that if the humidity is high/its raining, etc., yes you will have to boil the mixture longer. If you make these often, you will begin to be able to tell just by how the mixture looks. I've made these using chunky peanut butter and they are good too.

My husband's aunt made these cookies and wouldn't give out the recipe. But I found it !! Thank-you ... I find that boiling for four minutes hardens the mixture better than one minute. This would be perfect for a school bake sale.

First time i made them they were delicious, but they werre way to greasy for me to feel good about. This time I brought about 2 tbsp of butter, 1/2 c white sugar, 1/3 c agave, milk, cocoa, and salt to a rapid boil for 1min. Working quickly (having everything prepped in advance) I added the peanut butter to melt, then 1 small mashed banana, and once all incorporated, I added the vanilla and oats.  They turned out way less greasy, but equally delicious. The banana adds a subtle flavour, but its works well with the peanut butter and chocolate. I'm proud that I figured out an alternative that works!

Great recipe! These are super easy to make, and taste great! As other reviewers suggested, I brought the cocoa mixture to a full rolling boil before cooking for one minute...this helped the cookies set quickly and not spread so much. I also ran out of creamy peanut butter, so I ended up using half crunchy peanut butter. I actually really like the additional crunch of the peanut pieces in these, although I'm not sure my picky family does...
Other than that, I made these exactly as written, and couldn't be more pleased. Thanks for sharing the recipe...it's a keeper for sure!!!!

I learned to make these a long time ago, but lost my recipe in my many moves. Only one thing I change: depending on the moisture in the kitchen and outside I add a little bit more oatmeal to dry it out a bit. 1 minute has always been enough, even though humidity has killed many of these cookies :)

These cookies are definitely sweet, but really delicious. The best part is you can really do anything you want with them... add chopped nuts or Rice Krispies, add a little less peanut butter. And to make them a bit easier and more portable, you can pour them right into foil cups! Great, simple recipe!

I let it set in the pot a couple minutes before scooping onto wax paper.  I didn't want it to spread.  They took a while to firm up, but they tastes GREAT.  I keep them in the fridge/ freezer. You can eat them straight from the freezer (they don't turn into rocks),

It's hard for me to review these cookies, because I am just flat-out not a fan of "no bakes".  HOWEVER, my husband loves them and I had lost my recipe and he said these were even better than my old recipe, so I will give them a FIVE!  I can't keep them in the house for more than a day :-)

I made these cookies for my sister-in-law for her birthday, but they never set.  After a let them cool, for about 3 hours they still were not set, so I placed them outside overnight (below freezing) and the next morning still nothing.  I used to make these all the time, but they never turned out like this.  The taste was good and she ate them, but I am sure there is a little something missing from this recipe.

CAUTION: These are highly addictive! I added an extra tablespoon of cocoa because I like my cookies really chocolatey, and used butter instead of margarine. I only buy natural peanut butter, not the regular kind, so the texture was a little grainy. I also discovered that the oats are a little softer the next day after they've had time to absorb moisture from the other ingredients.

I used butter instead of margarine and canned milk instead of regular just 'cause that's how I roll when baking/cooking.  Things just taste better with butter and canned milk has a better consistency for cooking/baking, imho.  I used creamy PB but will also make again with crunchy for more texture.  I used Hershey's brand cocoa but will try another time with some Dutch processed cocoa I have in the cupboard.  Last time, I tried with nutella instead of peanut butter but they didn't set very well.

Make sure you start your cooking time from the time it comes to a rapid boil, and I always cook maybe 1 1/2-2 minutes. If you don't they won't harden up quite as good and be runny. I also usually throw in maybe 1/4 cup extra oats. These are really good, remember my mom making these when I was little.

Despite conflicting reviews on whether the cookies will set or not following the given directions, I decided to follow the recipe to the "T".  I made sure the ingredients that are meant to come to a boil came to a full rolling boil while stirring.  At that point, I set a timer for 1 minute and continued stirring while the mixture boiled.  As soon as I put in the remaining ingredients, I knew the cookies were not going to set properly.  I went ahead and put them out on the waxed paper.  Usually, no bake cookies set fairly rapidly upon cooling, but these did not.  The kids couldn't wait any longer and were scooping the cookies up with a spoon and eating them.  By the next morning, about 12 hours later, they had set enough to at least be able to pick them up.  They were still a little more "wet" than most no bake cookies.  
Even though they took awhile to set, they still tasted fine.  In my opinion, the sticky ones are much better than coming out with dry, crumbly cookies.

Very good.  You have to move quickly when dropping them, they harden quick.  I have already made these several times.  The kids love them and so does my husband and he doesn't eat much chocolate.

These were excellent with a couple changes.  I brought to a ROLLING boil and boiled for 2 minutes.  I had old fashioned oats and put them in the food processor.  After pouring the 3 cups in I could see that it needed a whole lot more oats to be thick enough to form cookies.  I added at least 1 more cup of oats and they were perfect.  Even my picky husband liked these.  So easy to make and good for breakfast this morning.  An easy way to eat your "oatmeal".  haha.

I love No-Bake cookies.  I love to cook and bake anything, and I'm very good at both.  However, for years I've tried to make these cookies, and I could never get it right - the ingredients would turn into a dry, crumbly non-formable mess.  It was so frustrating and disappointing ("was" being the operative word!!) Recently, I had a strong craving for them, and I knew I wanted to conquer this cookie!!  So with the help of a reviewer' comments and a friend's recommendation - I was able to be a accomplish my goal! A friend suggested, to overcome the dry crumbly mess I was getting to use a heaping measurement for the peanut butter - so I used a heaping 1/2 cup of peanut butter - maybe closer to 3/4 cup.  With the recommendation of a fellow reviewer of this recipe - I waited until the ingredients came to a full rolling boil before I began the 1-minute timer!  With those suggestions my cookies were perfect!  I will definitely be using this recipe again!

I made this recipe using Splenda the type where you use the same amount as you would sugar - AWFUL.  They didn't turn out at all.  I was trying to make them for people that can't process the sugar but boy it didn't work. It was dry and the flavor was off.

I just had a tip for anyone in a hurry, instead of dropping them onto waxed paper individually try buttering a 9"x13" pan and spreading them into it, cool and cut into squares. I work in a school cafeteria and this is the way we do it, it's so much faster when you have to make that many at once!

Amazing! Chocolaty, peanut buttery goodness! Perfect for the middle of July when you don't want to heat the house up baking cookies. Love this recipe. I did make a small change - I used 1- 1/4 cups of white sugar and 3/4 cup of brown sugar. I just love the flavour and texture that brown sugar gives to sweets. It was so great! Thanks for the recipe; a definite keeper.

These are good, and there are a thousand different ways to make them. I prefer 4 level tbsp. cocoa powder and 1 c. of peanut butter. Definitely don't start counting your minute until it's at a full rolling boil. An old recipe book I have says not to stir during the minute of boiling, so I never do.

These are a family favorite. We've been making them our whole lives. You don't have a family party without "Mess Cookies". The only problem is that the recipe has been a little muddled, passing verbally from one person to the next. No one could agree on the cooking times, so I started testing. The key to the no bake cookies is the boil time. You MUST have your mix at a hard boil (you stir and the boiling isn't reduced). Do not time before this point and only cook at a rolling boil for 1 minute. If you cook it at the wrong time, you will either get hard dry cookies or very gooey cookies that will NOT set up (thus our naming them Messy).   This recipe has all the portions correctly. It is excellent :D

what did I do wrong? I followed the directions and it turned out like a dried granola mix1 It was so dry I couldn't even form it into a cookie.

I did these a few times and they turned out horrible, but I know why. As I boiled it I added the oats and pnb instead of boiling it, taking it off the burner, and then added the oats, pnb, vanilla, and salt. I was doing it all on a hot burner and the cookies would never set.
This is a great recipe.

I've tried similar recipes, but this one sets up the best. The only thing I changed was that I substituted butter for the margarine.

I was looking for something easy to make for my kids for an afternoon treat. It is 101 degrees outside so I didn't want to turn my oven on. I came accross this recipe and boy am I glad I did. I made it exactly as written and it came out great! I did use dutch processed cocoa, because that is all I use, and it made the cookie have a deeper choc. flavor. Even my son, who HATES oats, ate them! This is a keeper!

Wow! Add me to the legions of fans for this one! As I was preparing it my kids came running down the stairs due to the wonderful smell and were pleasantly surprised to find their wait was not as long as usual to dig in. They are simply fabulous. A little something for everyone. A definite keeper. Like everyone else, I used less sugar (1 and 1/3 cups sugar and they are still plenty sweet) and cooked a little longer (2+ minutes).

Has been my favorite for years!  I use this for every quick party, potluck, and especially BBQ.  Most of the ingredients you have on hand always.  Make sure you don't let the batter cool in the pan too much before scooping onto wax paper, because it may become too crumbly to scoop.

These are yummy. I made a few changes:
I was out of cocoa so I used instant chocolate pudding mix (worked great!), I used chocolate silk soy milk, and reduced fat Jif PB. Next time I will decrease the sugar buy at least 1/4.

Mine were not runny at all and taste GREAT!

I've made this recipe several times already. The cookies set up best when I let the mixture cool in the pan for a couple of minutes before spooning onto a cookie sheet.

Great recipe. I'm not a huge peanut butter fan so I reduced the amount of peanut butter a little bit. Like everyone said, let it boil for a minute before the oats are added in. This helps the cookies stick together. The first time I made them, they didn't solidify because I didn't wait to throw the oats in. Great recipe. This is my all time favorite cookie recipe!

My recipe has a few differences: an extra cup sugar, an extra tbsp cocoa, an extra 1/2 cup butter, no salt, 4 tbsp p-butter instead of 1/2 cup (I think it's about the same amount though), & an extra tsp vanilla. My directions: mix sugar, cocoa, butter, milk & "bring to a ROLLING boil, & continue to boil for 1 minute. Add oats, peanut butter & vanilla, & beat until fairly thick. Remove from heat & drop by spoonfuls onto greased cookie sheets or waxed paper. Place in a cool dry place & let sit for at least 1 hour." In my experience making these, the following works best: 1) you need to bring the mixture to a good, rolling boil before timing - this cooking helps blend the flavor of the cocoa with the other ingredients & make it deep and rich; 2) you need to have the oats, peanut butter & vanilla measured out and ready to go as soon as you pull the mix off the stove; 3) use a large wooden spoon to stir the whole thing in the pan – you’re literally going to "beat" the mixture by hand. It is very tiresome, but the longer you "beat", the thicker the mixture becomes, the less shine it has, & the better it will set once placed on your cookie sheet. BEWARE: It *is* possible to over-mix, & wind up with crumbly cookies. You want to beat the mixture until thick & it has lost some of its shine, not until it's chunky. Chunky means you've beaten too much (or taken too long and the mixture has cooled). These are very rich cookies, & not for the faint of heart.

first of all, I have never been even tempted to review a recipe before, but oh my god..these cookies are fabulous. I substituted the cocoa for 1.5 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips and reduced the sugar to 1 cup, but they taste better than any cookies Ive ever had. not even just no bakes, all cookies. definitely try them, you wont regret it.

My boyfriend had been asking me to make no bake cookies for the longest time. I had never made them before and did not have the foggiest idea of how to make them. I tried this recipe based on the ratings and reviews and he was thrilled with them! I followed the recipe using chunky peanut butter instead of creamy, and cooked it for about 2 minutes. They came out perfect. A keeper!

Did not follow this recipe the first time but took others advise and cooked the sugar/chocolate longer (bad idea)...  Then when I added the oatmeal I thought I should add alittle more (another bad idea)... I ended up with chocolate rocks.  My kids didn't think it was too bad but I thought it was really yucky!!!  Today I made another batch to see if I could improve myself.  I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect, perfect, perfect!!!  I was wondering if some of the oatmeal could be substituted with coconut flakes to get a "Mounds Bars" taste. Will have to try that.

Followed recipe to a T and use this recipe faithfully as no bakes are my husband's favorite cookie.   These are excellent!  I also followed the instructions in the comments to allow the mixture to come to a rolling boil and then start the timer for one minute.

Followed the recipe exactly and they turns out perfect. Make sure you time your one minute after the rolling, rapid boil starts. And then work quickly to add the other ingredients. The cookies set up quickly.

This is a great recipe.  I love No Bake's.  I've been eating them since I was a child.  But every time I try to make them myself they Never turn out! Either to mushy and the butter separates and they seem over cooked.  Plus the flavor seems off. I swear I try to follow the recipe exactly. I pre measure everything before hand and time the boil for 3 minutes.  I am starting to think it may have something to do with the hard anodized cookware that I have been using for the last five years.  At least that is what I am starting to think.  So frustrating.  Any suggestions on type of cookware?

This recipe works well as is, but I make a bunch of modifications to suit my own tastes and needs. I like my cookies very fudgy and almost gooey; I want them to have more chocolate flavor but not lose the peanut butter and finally, I want them to pack a slightly healthier punch. So... if you don't want yours like that, you can move on to the next review, if you do, here's how I modify them.
1. decrease sugar by 1/3 cup.
2. decrease milk by a couple of tbs and use 2 pinches of sea salt.
3. increase peanut butter to a full cup.
4. use 9 tbsp of Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa instead of 3 of regular.
5. use real butter, it's healthier than margarine.
6. use old fashioned oats and add them right after the peanut butter, then add back in those 2 tbsp of milk to help soften them a bit (don't worry, it'll set because of the chocolate chips, keep reading.)
7. add 2 Tbsp Ground Golden Flax Seed with the oats.
8. add 1/3 c. of special dark chocolate chips.
9. after adding the peanut butter, oats, vanilla, flax seed, and chocolate chips, stir slowly over low heat until the chocolate chips are melted and then scoop out onto the wax paper.
For the nutritionally inclined chocoholic who wants a decadent dark chocolate treat that still has some redeeming qualities, these are SOOOOO yummy!

Good and quick, but a bit dry.  I will try less boiling time, and on med heat instead of high.  Also, I found this a bit too sweet.  I will try omitting a half cup of sugar.

To try recipe out I halved which worked out fine.  My only complaint is they are too sweet.  I even lessened the amount of sugar called for and still sweet. I probably used 3/4 cup instead of the 1 cup but still too sweet. Otherwise all other proportions were right on.

Just made these for the first time.  They taste great, however, they are still fairly soft.  They did not set up as quickly as the recipe says.  Not sure if that's my mistake or if they just take longer to set.  These are my son's favorite and he says to let them set out a while longer and see what happens.  The flavor is great though!

this is my first time making no bake cookies...
mi changes:
-i used only 1 1/2 cup of sugar, it's really enough sweet like this
-instead of milk i just used the same amount of water
-i like it chocolaty, so i added an extra spoon of cacao
-i boiled it several minutes... not just one or two...
 
for the ones with no time to scoop and spoon, just divide the mixture onto two diff. baking sheets, cover with another baking sheet, use a rolling pin to flatten the whole thing, take a knife and cut in squares or whatever shape you like and voilaaa...
bonne appetit!! :)

This is a family recipe that has been made every year. We use evaporated milk for a creamier texture and pour the mixture into a 13x9 pan, cool and cut into squares. Quick and easier. Forget dropping by spoonfuls!

This was super easy and came out great!!  I boiled the mixture for 2 minutes after a full rolling boil was achieved as previous people mentioned and they turned out great!  They set they way they were supposed to and were not crumbly.  Also i didn't stir the mixture a lot, only to combine and then once or twice after that, which I think made a difference.  Will for sure make these again and probably often!

Sorry, this recipe didn't work for me! I read all the reviews, I boiled for two minutes, but I guess it wasn't a high enough boil because I still ended up with ooze, they weren't just mushy, you couldn't even pick them up. I was wishing I had made some other type of cookie because it was pretty much a waste, and I never have any problems when I bake! I don't think I would try to make these again, sorry.

These taste good when you really want cookies and don't have much time to make them, but I really prefer baked cookies.  The oats don't quite have the right texture when they are raw.  Also, they are a bit too crumbly for my liking - I need cookies that can stand up to a young child holding it.

Great recipe,  but the timing is off.   As a hint,  the humidity has an effect on how the cookies will "set up".   What I do is bring the mixture to a boil,  then rolling boil for 3 minutes if it IS humid,  and 2 minutes if it is NOT humid.    Also,  in the winter,  I will make this recipe without the oatmeal and pour in a pan and let it set and cut into squares. This recipe has been around for 40 years or more!

Instead of judging what is "just a boil" and what is a "rolling boil," I bring these to about 100 C (212 F) and they set nicely.

I have made these cookies for many years and the timing is the key. I was taught to bring to a rolling boil then time for 1 minute, no more no less. I have also added about a cup of coconut to mine from time to time, they are very good this way (if you like coconut like I do) try it sometime, you'll like it !

did the recipe almost as it said followed other reviewers advice and increased boiling time to 2 min. (the second time around) it tooka while for the first batch to set and I was getting worried but they turned out just fine even only cooking for 1 min. was very easy and very good. I did use fat free evaporated milk and increased PB to 3/4 cup.

pretty darn good but of course my cookies didn't harden.  I looked around at other recipes and most tell you to have the recipe at a rapid boil closer to 2 or 3 minutes.  I will try to make them again just boil the liquid a little longer next time.

Used butter instead of margarine and old fashion oats instead of quick oats. Boiled for the 1 minute and had plenty of time to put them on parchment paper before they set up.

I've found that using a med/small ice cream scoop with trigger will give you the nice round cookies versus amoeba-like looking cookies.

Wonderful cookie!  One of my co-workers LOVES these, so I'm making them for her for Christmas.  The texture and taste are right on!  Thanks to other reviewers for helping with the timing thing.  I'm not much of a candy maker, so definitely a huge help!  Thanks for posting! ~*~*~*~*~Edit~*~*~*~*~ I just tried this again, going by the same guidelines, except I covered the bottom of a small muffin tin with mini marshmallows and then put them mixture on top...OMH!  This was ASTOUNDINGLY good!  I think I'm going to make a second batch and make it into a bar cookie, covering the top with marshmallows while it's still hot so they stick to it.  MMMMMM!

These 'No-Bakes' are fantastic! I make them sometimes by omitting the chocolate when I am having a peanut butter craving, and call them 'Peanut Butter No-Bakes'. Again, great recipe!

The ingredient ratio is perfect. The steps can use some work. First put your vanilla in with the oats mix then add your peanutbutter in with the oats, mix and set aside. The trick is to slowly heat the sauce. Start the heat on 3 and gradually work your way up to 4 and then 5 (med heat) till you get it to a rolling boil. You only need to boil it for one minute. My cookies come out perfect everytime.

These turned out good. I followed KIRVIN's advice for cooking them in the microwave and it worked fine. The only other thing I did differently was that I poured the whole thing in a 9x13 pan and cut them into squares when cooled. Fast and easy and I didn't have to heat up my house :)

This is a deliscious recipie and I added something that was fun after letting it boil at a Rolling boil for a minute, I added half of a bag of marshmallows, it worked perfectly, and after letting them melt I finished the recipie as instructed, it tastes wonderful and is slightly fluffier than the original

OMG...these cookies should be illegal!  They are just that addictive.  It's a great recipe and it doesn't make the house hotter.  I will definitely add these to my christmas cookies list, they're so fast to make I can make them while baking something else.

Sometimes it's best not to mess with a recipe. I followed some suggestions and added 1/2 cup oats and 1/4 cup cocoa-they were dry as a bone and didn't look like the picture! will have to try again!

This is the best no-bake cookie recipe on this site.  Stick with 3 T of cocoa vs. the 4 T called for by some recipes...it's much better.  Also, I use 1/4 cup less sugar so they aren't sickeningly sweet.

I've been craving these and the ones from Wal-Mart are always too grainy. When I was making them, I discovered I'd run out of regular coco and so I had to used flavored coco. Caramel coco and holy cow did it come out awsome!!! A bit of a adult flair to this childhood classic.

These are my all-time favorite dessert.  I make these once a week and I'm not exaggerating.  We call them "Globs"  What I've found after making them MANY times is to use 1/2 cup baking cocoa and only 5 Tbsp. of butter.  I let the mixture boil for 2 min. before removing from heat to add the rest of ingredients.  Just make sure to have the peanut butter already measured out so you don't have to fuss with that when you're in a hurry.  These are the best!!

I loved it, but everyone thought it was too sweet, even though I put 1 1/2 cups sugar instead of 2! Next time I will only add 1 cups. And the quick oats stayed a bit hard, so i will use instant oats next time. Also, I poured the whole thing in a 9x13inch baking dish, and cut them into squares. Picture will be available soon. All in all, the flavor was really good.

I was looking for a quick, easy cookie recipe since I need to make 18 dozen for an upcoming bake sale.  Glad I tested a batch of these on the family first!  I don't know what we were expecting, but these were horrible.  They set up nicely and were easy to make, but they were way too sweet and just tasted like chocolate flavored oatmeal.  Maybe it was just our taste preference, but this is one we won't be trying again.

Just what I LOVED as a kid. These were always my favorites.  The suggestion about waiting until a full boil before starting the minute is a good one.  I use low fat PB and 2% milk as well as lite margarine with no problem. These are super! Ally

I made THREE batches and they all turned out gooey. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly. Then, I did it again, allowing it to boil 2 minutes from the rapid boil. Then...I tried again and let it boil 3.5 minutes. STILL gooey. They taste fine, but they can't be picked up like a cookie. :(

Love these cookies!  I used to make these as a child and I wanted to introduce my 4-year old son to them.  I'm so glad I found the recipe again here!  I did change the sugar to 1-1/2 cups and added the peanut butter in with the boiling ingredients to melt it.  Quick tip:  to get these cookies to set faster, put them in the freezer for 10 or 15 minutes!

I grew up on these! Absolutely delicious! I also let it come to a FULL BOIL THEN start the timing -(1 to 2 mins) It's almost like candy so it needs to hit the right temp to 'set' correctly. (don't overcook or they will be too crumbly. 

I like to use extra crunchy peanut butter and a little less coco, but my kids perfer creamy and lots of coco - we've even added raisins for a nice change. The coconut idea sounds like something we will have to try. A word of warning for those of you in rainy areas... since it is a little like candy, the rainy days are not good days to make these (we have made some on rainy days and they are a little gooie and don't set right).

I followed the recipe exactly, and they turned out perfectly!  I dropped them by spoonfuls on a foil-covered cookie sheet (I didn't have wax paper) and they didn't stick. When both of my cookie sheets were full I just poured the rest into a pan and cut them into squares.  Thanks Robin for the excellent recipe - A friend of mine from Pennsylvania used to make these.  Every other recipe I found for them turned out either too runny or too crumbly.  These are great!

I have a cookie business and this was a big hit when I took it around the first time!!Who doesn't love the combination of peanut butter and chocolate!! Defiantly have to be carefull not to cook for more that a minute or two or else you will have a flat little puddle of a cookie! I love to eat them frozen from the freezer!

I love these cookies because you can add or take away whatever you like.  I added a handful of coconut and about 1/4 of a cup of cream of coconut.  I had to substitute about 1-1/2 cups of brown sugar because I didn't have enough of the white.  I've been eating these since I was a little girl (thanks to mema) and I never get tired of them.  Thanks for a good memory Robin.

These were not awful, they were just sickeningly sweet. I used 1-1/2 cups of sugar.. and that was still way too much for my taste.  There must be alot of people out there with a nice sweet tooth! If you like this kind of sweetness.. Go for it! But not for me! (my hubby hasn't tried them yet.. he may gobble them up! lol

This recipe made my bosses year.  He had not had it in several years and while doing some holiday baking for office he asked if I made NO Bake cookies.  I had never heard of them but went to All Recipes and searched.  Found this recipe and tried it.  This was the flavor his holiday taste buds had missed so.  Thank you for sharing.  Great site and recipe for the sweet tooth.

This recipe was very good and easy to make.  It reminded me of my childhood when my best friend and I would run home from school so we can make this recipe by ourselves.  We didn't have to turn on the ove, that was the best part.  Today, my 5 year old loves it.  She can't get enough of it.  Thanks.

I love this recipe. I have tried over and over to make these and never had any luck getting them to get hard like they should. I decided to try it one last time and never make them again and I got it. They were all gone before the night was over and I made a second batch and they were great too. Thank you for sharing this with me.

I tried this recipes the way it's written and it was good. But I wanted no-bake cookies that were a little more firm, peanut buttery, and less oily. So I doubled the peanut butter, quartered the butter and added a little more oatmeal. It was perfect!

First i must say I'm not a cookie maker or  baker and a novice cook at best so i thought how cool it was that i could make cookies without baking. But I  also did not read the reviews so i now have a couple dozen piles of runny oatmeal/chocolate blobs laying in the kitchen on waxed paper. Great tasting blobs but can't take them off the paper without the intent to eat them. BOIL LONGER THAN STATED!

These were VERY good. I always make as directed the first time for rating purposes, although I did cook this one minute longer than the recipe. I don't think that would change the taste much though. The only reason it gets four stars instead of five is because I think they were overly sweet. I used peanut butter that was all natural and contained absolutely no sugar, and they were still too sweet for my taste. They would be even sweeter with regular peanut butter. Like other reviewers, I recommend cutting the sugar to 1 1/2 cups.

This recipe is amazing!!! My sister-in-law is allergic to dairy, soy and gluten which makes it almost impossible to make a dessert for family get-togethers but I substituted coconut milk for cow milk and canola oil for the margarine and they still turned out great!!!! I took the advice of Lorna and started timing 1 minute as soon as it came to a full boil and I had absolutely no problems with texture. These cookies tasted amazing and it was nice to know I could provide a treat that people with or without food allergies could enjoy.

Full rolling boil. Check. Timed minute. Check. Added peanut butter after removing from heat. Check. Reached in the cabinet to shake in the oats....oh no! WHERE ARE THE OATS?!?!? In a panic, I tossed in RICE KRISPIES, the only thing I had that resembled oats. Sort of. I burnt my hand on the pot, so a bit more than called for went in...hurried and flipped them out on wax paper with a big serving spoon since the cookies are now twice the size they would have been... hmmmm....SO DELICIOUS!! For once, a happy accident in the kitchen...

My husband loves no bake cookies - I used to buy them at Wal-Mart for him.  I finally decided to make my own and found this recipe.  He told me he likes these better than the store bought cookies!  I read through hundreds of reviews and followed a few tips from other people, and these have turned out great every time.  I did try reducing the sugar, per some reviews, but my husband and kids like them sweeter.  I wait for the full boil, then start timing.  I have found that it takes a little longer than the minute, maybe 15-20 seconds longer, probably has something to do with high altitude.  I put the peanut butter on top of the oats and pour the vanilla on top of that, so that everything is ready to mix in when the boiling is done.  I always have my husband help drop them onto the pans and have never had trouble getting them dropped before it hardens.  He also cleans up all the drips :)  Thanks for the recipe, and all the helpful reviews!

I have been making these for years and years. Always perfect and delicious. Make sure you are using real butter or real margarine. It must have 100 calories per tablespoon to be real. Anything else is a margarine spread (even if it is in stick form) and should never be used in a recipe. It will not allow your cookies or candy to set up or harden. If your cookies did not set up, this may be the cause. Another cause may be not allowing mixture to come to a full rolling boil. A full rolling boil is a boil that can't be stirred down. 1 minute cooking time (after it has reached the full boil stage) allows a creaminess to the cookie texture that you won't get if you boil it too long.

This recipe is basically the same as the No Bake Chocolate Cookies II, but with a bit of a twist by adding peanut butter.  They're pretty good, but I still prefer the others (they have a bit of coconut in them.)

Make exactly according to recipe.  These are delicious little bites!  I used my small cookie scoop to shape them and got 50 cookies.  Read afterwards that I should maybe boil longer (2 minutes).  Mine are soft, but hold their shape.  Irresistible and easy!  Thanks, Robin, for posting.

First time making this, it didn't turn out well, because I let it boil too long. Second time, I made it to a T and it was runny, so added 1 more cup of oatmeal and it was yummy after it hardened. Took awhile though. So for the third try, i cut the sugar to 1&1/2 cups ('cause i need to lay off some sugar!), and let it boil for 2 mins. Looked better than the second try but added 1 more cup of oatmeal and it was perfect! Well, at least for my family. Very yummy unhealthy recipe, LOVE it! Will make it again and again. ;)

When I was in grade school, these were fixed by our lunchroom ladies. One of the ladies was a neighbor and she gave me the recipe. They were called Peanut Butter Delights. Every time I fix them, it is like stepping back to when I was a child. It is also a precious gift this sweet lady left behind.

these are great as printed, but my family likes the oatmeal browned in a skillet before I add it to the mix, so I start with that step, and then go on to the rest of the recipe.

I really really liked this recipe. I purposely set out to use this recipe, to make it on a Memorial day cake display. And it was perfect. I did do 1 thing different but it really was for cosmetic reasons, not for preferred taste or "it was what I had on hand" reasons either. I used only half the oats in the recipe but added rice crisp cereal to it. Because, I was making fake-out hamburger patties and wanted more of a bumpy look. It worked out great. The flavor was still good and I enjoyed eating it, very much. TY The recipe stood up to my food gag, as planned. And now it will be my go-to recipe to continue the food gag for other preps in the future.

Very good, but I still prefer my mother's recipe which call for 1/2 cup cocoa and no added salt. I used real butter - the salted kind. This is why I chose to leave out what the recipe calls for even though I appreciate the richness of a chocolate-and-salt combo. The four stars comes from the fact that they weren't cocoa-y enough for me; maybe I've just been spoiled by my mother's recipe though. I did have to call her regarding the level of heat over which to boil (she said to use medium heat), and yes, I have ALWAYS known these cookies to require one minute EXACTLY at a hard, rolling boil to set properly. Overall, this is what I was looking for.

My favorite cookie ever!  The key to the perfect texture (not too runny, not to dry) is after the mixture comes to a boil, reduce heat( but still keep it at a boil) and DO NOT STIR.  Boil for 2 minutes and they will come out perfect!

These are delicious, just like my mom made when I was little. Take the suggestions of boil time (4-5 minutes after boiling begins), and they will not fail or disappoint.

These tasted okay (far too sweet), but mine were crumbles after cooling.  Maybe it's because I used real peanut butter or I didn't stir enough, but I couldn't let the kids eat them because they would turn into a pile of crumbs when we picked them up.  They were not flat, cute, little, glossy cookies that were discussed or shown in pictures.  And I know how to cook and make yummy hard candy so these should have been easy peasy.

I have used this recipe for years and it is by far the best one I have had.  I will not even bother trying a new one.  Thanks for the recipe!

Tasted amazing, but I had to refrigerate them to get them to fully set.  I don't know if this is typical or if I should have added more oats.  I will try the recipe again.

Because I'm diabetic I used equal parts of splenda, stevia and sugar. I boiled for 2 1/2 minutes and they turned out fantastic.
My non diabetic hubby whom I make bake goods with sugar loved these too. Hmm maybe I should make him his own batch.

Good flavor but mine didn't set.  They turned out more like soft candy than cookies.  Next time I'll cook them longer as suggested.  We didn't have any problem eating them up though!

Believe it or not, I had never had these until a friend turned me on to the "Wal-Mart" version. I had to save her from that, so made these and they're very good! All who tried them loved them. I've made them with both regular and "Special Dark" cocoa, and both are good. I may try adding raisins or dried cherries next time!

Excellent!  These were the perfect consistency.  I followed the advice to make sure they cookies were at a full rolling boil before timing them for 1 minute!  Thanks for the great recipe.

1 minute for boiling is not nearly enough time to cook. Complete waste. It may have turned out ok if it was cooked longer.

Boiling time debate.  I agree with Lorna:  One minute at a ROLLING boil is just right.  This is the first time I've made them.  They came out yummy, shiny, and set perfectly.  It's been hot, hot, hot here and I didn't want to turn on the oven.  My 13 year old son helped me, and we are eating them 30 minutes after we started.

Perfect!  Just as I remember as a kid.  Boiled 2 minutes as suggested by others.  Used no salt peanut butter (trying to use up).   Even used skim milk because that's what we keep in the house.  Was looking for something where I didn't have to turn on oven in the summer.   Such simple ingredients with spectacular results.

This has been the same recipe that I have used since I started cooking as a young girl.  The only additional info that I would add is to the boiling time.  If you do not have a candy thermometer, bring mixture to a roiling boil and boil until mix forms a soft ball when a drop is dropped into cold water.

Quick, easy, yummy - pretty much sums it up!!  I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and also used 100% all natural peanut butter, which is not sweet compared to 'normal' peanut butter.  The end result was still plenty sweet to me, with that great peanut/chocolate combo, mmmm!  My 3 boys and my nephew LOVED these - I have a feeling this batch will be gone in no time :)

The first time I tried this recipe, I went with the suggestion to boil for 2 minutes with not so good results.  The cookies were dry and crumbly and they set up before I could scoop them out of the pan.  I tried it again exactly as written and they are PERFECT. So chewy and yummy, and still glossy.  I had time to scoop them all out onto the paper before they began to firm up.  Amazing what difference a minute makes!

Delicious.  I think the 1 minute boiling time is perfect if you wait for it to get to a "rapid" boil.  Don't start counting right when you see bubbles, give it a little time.  I used butter instead of margarine.  Great recipe!

I found this recipe in a chocolate craving fit, wanting a quick chocolate fix. This is great. The first time, I dont think I boiled long enough, it was a bit crumbly, but still tasty. The second time I made them I forgot to put the butter, they looked like dirt balls but were still yummy. I will get it right eventually.

I used only 1 cup of sugar and made sure that the sugar/milk/butter mixture boiled for a good 4 minutes. I also used all natural chunky organic peanut buuter from Trader Joe's. The consistency and texture came out just right. Not too dry and it set perfectly in the fridge within 1 hour.

This is a great no bake cookie recipe. I added 4 Tablespoons of cocoa instead of 3, and an extra 1/2 cup of oats. Make sure you boil the mixture for the full 1 minute. I actually boiled it for over a minute and it came out wonderful. Just make sure you hit the 1 minute mark. A little over won't kill this recipe, but a little under could. I also poured the whole thing onto a cookiesheet lined with wax paper and pressed it out flat, then took a cookie cutter after it cooled to get fun shapes instead of the "drops" of cookies you usually see. Thanks for this awesome recipe!

This was TOO sweet.  I'll be cutting back on the sugar next time or trying brown sugar instead.  Either way, I won't be making it this way.

I don't know what I did... however, mine were not moist at all. These were the driest no bakes I have ever made. I made no substitutions at all so I am rating it how the recipe is stated.

I made these with carob powder instead of unsweetened cocoa because I can't handle the caffeine in chocolate. Also, unsweetened, organic creamy peanut butter from Trader Joe's and 1-1/2 c. sugar. They turned out great!! You can't even tell it's not chocolate and they're just a smidgen healthier to boot.

I used the other reviewers tip and boiled till 210. Always perfect. Also I though the sugar was way too much and reduced it by half a cup or even more. Because I always want to add more nutrition sometimes I ground almonds and add half oats half almonds. Hubbi never know and its high in protien, also change to low fat milk.

I gave these cookies three stars because the adults liked them fine and the cookies were simple and quick to make, but the kids were less enthusiastic about them.

This is so much like a recipe my Mom used to make when I was a child, except she didn't use peanut butter.  I love these cookies, very tasty.  I was craving chocolate, and these are a great treat!

When i was growing up we called them "Cow Plops" because they look like cow poop, i grew up in Vermont and i loved it there and these no bake cookies remind me of the "Cow Plops" that we used to make there. :)

This recipe did not turn out for me.  I am not a good candy maker, so when it comes to the boiling process, I often fail.  I waited for the mixture to come to a rapid boil then timed for one minute.  I stirred during the minute which could be the problem.  However I am very disappointed to waste ingredients and still not have a no bake cookie to eat.

Awesome recipe! I like this WAY more than regular, baked cookies. Like the others have said, the timing isn't right. Other than that, it's perfect. The coco, oatmeal, and peanut butter blend is yummy! :)

Maybe I did something wrong, but I'm fairly certain I followed the directions properly. These cookies just would not harden or keep their shape. Even after freezing them, they were all in one big lump. We ended up eating them with a spoon because they flavour was still so good!

The proportions are perfect in this recipe, it's the TIMING that is wrong.  The sugar mixture needs to be boiled to nearly soft-ball stage or the cookies won't set.

These are Fantastic, I do let mine boil for 2 full minutes.  It has to be a full rolling boil for the entire 2 minutes though or the cookies will not harden completely.  Quick and easy recipe!

I altered this recipe to make it dairy free for my son who is very allergic.  I substituted butter flavored shortening for the margarine and vanilla soy milk for the milk in the same amounts.  I made it according the recipe otherwise and they turned out great.  Almost as good as the original.  Set up great and everything.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is one of our all-time family faves - my dad has been making them since I was a toddler. What makes them REALLY good? Put them in the freezer instead of on the counter, then they not only get nice and firm and easy to eat but taste AMAZING! Make it like the recipe says, don't change half the ingredients and still expect them to be good. Don't forget to use parchment paper though! :)

Our men and women overseas love this recipe, have been sending it to them since 2000. Don't worry about how they fare in shipment. They will eat them, but you can wrap individually and they hold there shape.

These were very easy to make. I'm not really sure what I was expecting, but I didn't really like them. Maybe add some raisins? Hubby liked them but agreed they "needed something" I probably won't make them again.

Okay, I'm in Germany and had to improvise a bit with this recipe. Instead of peanut butter and cocoa I used Nutella, about 1 cup, and decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup. I also used whole oats because I couldn't find quick oats, I just added them when the rapid boil started and let it boil 2-3 minutes, then added the Nutella. Forgot to add the vanilla, but I don't think they needed it. They came out amazing!!

I have made this recipe too many times to count and they've always received rave reviews. Personally, I think they're "just ok" but almost everyone I serve them to seems to love them. And because the cookies are very easy to make and don't require turning on the oven, this recipe gets 5 stars. I've tried a variety of changes including decreasing the sugar (you really don't need 2 cups), slightly decreasing the butter (which I use instead of margarine), slightly increasing the peanut butter. I've adjusted batch size (increased and decreased) to good effect. But if you want to double the recipe you should note that it'll take longer to drop all the cookies and the mixture may start to set in the saucepan. When this happens to me, I just put the saucepan over high heat for just a few seconds. Also note - do NOT substitute veg oil in whole or part for the margarine.. this will not work well and the cookies will be crumbly (though still tasty).

My husband and son love these cookies.  I like that you can taste the peanut butter in them.  These were easy to make.  Like others, I recommend boiling an extra minute for a firmer set up.

My 17 year old has been requesting these for the last week. Kinda funny really as I don't think I have made them since she was much younger. Last night I made them and she loved them. They were dull looking and not glossy, must have over stirred a little, but definitely hasn't affected the taste! Just like my Mom used to make when I was a kid!

This recipe makes the most perfect cookies! I've tried so many of them and this is now MY recipe for these cookies. I don't start the timing until the rolling boil begins, but I only boil it for 1 minute. I tried boiling them for 1 1/2 - 2 minutes and that made them dry and crumbly. Some folks may prefer them that way, I don't. Boiled for 1 minute as directed by Robin gives a perfect result for me. Thanks Robin!!

These cookies were great, but two cups of sugar made them too sweet for me. Following other reviews, I boiled for a little over 2 minutes and the cookies set perfectly and were not hard to work with. I used old fashioned oats because that's all I had, and they turned out chewy, but still delicious.

Super easy, but too soft still at one minute. I'll try 2 minutes next time.

Not quite as "wet" as I like my no bakes, but an awesome recipe I highly recommend. Be sure to have all of your ingredients gathered and ready to go before starting. It didn't take long to get things rolling in our Emerilware, so be prepared to throw everything in and to enjoy a tasty treat!

These are amazing!  I didn't have wax paper so I just put the on cookie sheets and they came off just fine.  If you want them to set quick you can put them in the fridge for a while.  I'll make these again and again.

I'm reviewing after making it twice. I love it for the simplicity and taste. Used crunchy peanut butter both times. Excellent, just like my mother made us as children.

These are exactly like my grandma made!! EXACTLY! Thank you so much! I used butter instead of margarine and only added 1 1/2 C sugar. I have a sweet tooth for sure, and they were plenty sweet still!

Highly addicting! I substituted 1 cup of the sugar for Splenda and it turned out great.  Also, I put mine in the freezer to speed setting. Works perfectly!

These were cookies my mom made for my siblings & I when we were kids and I absolutely loved them. This recipe is exactly what I remember and they are just as good now as they were then! I used butter (didn't have margarine) and they came out great. Thanks!!

What a great and super quick snack "cookie." I followed others' suggestions and started timing AFTER a rolling boil. I used real butter (because I ALWAYS cook with real butter). My little boy helped me make them (he is 7, so they are super easy to make). No mess, no baking and no fuss, just quick and easy! My son loved them! Thanks!!

This recipe is the classic one.  I have made these cookies by the millioins I suppose.  One suggestion I want to make is this... do not use margarine in these cookies anymore.  The margarines today have too much water in them and then the cookies dont turn out right.  Use real butter and even 1/2 and 1/2 if you want REALLY great cookies! Never use low fat or non fat milk! I do increae the peanut butter by 1 tbsp. too, and I cook it for 1 1/2 minutes AFTER IT COMES TO A ROLLING BOIL. One that cannot be stirred dwon.  Aint this just the greatest cookie tho?

I'm not sure why these got such great reviews. At least the clean-up was easy. All I had was to do was wash one pan and roll the wax-paper up, cookies and all and toss.

Awesome. My 10 year old daughter made them for us and they turned out great. We took other's suggestions and rapidly boiled the mixture for 2 minutes.  We also used a small melon scoop which I always use for cookies and it scooped them out perfectly.

Pretty good! My almost 10 yr old made these today and it was an easy recipe and tasty....my only thing that wont let me give this 5 stars is because I did one batch on the waxed paper and the paper stuck to the cookies.....the other batch on a silpat and they came off beautifully!!   Just that one glitch knocked it down a star...otherwise good easy, kid friendly recipe....but use a silpat if you have one....or I bet parchment paper would be just as good! Thanks!

I have attempted twice at these no bake cookies, as my boyfriend raves about childhood memories of no bake cookies.  I have followed the recipe exactly, and then I went through the reviews and went by the other suggestions, and both times, they come out really really soft, never setting firm.  They come out with a caramel-y texture. I give up!

I was afraid these wouldn't come out right because I am a college student with no measuring cups / spoons, and no stove.  I estimated the amounts as closely as I could and cooked them in a hot pot.  That last bit scared me the most because I can't maintain a boil for more than about 15 seconds.  I basically just let it boil a few times and then let it sit for a bit longer after putting the oats in.  When I spooned them out, I put them in the refrigerator to cool, hoping they'd stay whole and not run back together in a gooey chocolaty mass after I took them back out.  They've been in a plastic container, sitting on top of each other on my desk for over an hour now, and they're just the consistency I'd have hoped for.  Maybe I got lucky, but they came out amazingly, and they taste awesome too.  Just like when my mom makes them.

Super easy.  I cut the sugar nearly in half, eyeballed the peanut butter, and used rolled oats instead of quick oats.  These turned out slightly gooey (because of my changes, I'm sure) but still held together and tasted great!

These are the same ingredients in the recipe my mom used(and now I use), except hers called for only 1 T. peanut butter. Also, to get better consistency, bring them to a full boil over medium heat stirring constantly and continue boiling for 2 minutes. I don't think they're quite as good if you boil them too rapidly - don't set up as well. But a huge hit! These are excellent - just experiment a bit to get the right heat and timing. Also, I prefer less peanut butter than 1/2 C.  Think my mom's recipe of 1 T. is about right.

These are really good cookies. I have made tehm many times but have found they turn out a little better for me if I made a few adjustments. I use 2 TBsp. cocoa instead of 3. I leave the salt out and up the peanut butter to 2/3 cup, I let boil for 2 minutes stirring constantly. The adjustments makes them a bit thicker for me so they hold together better and everyone seems to like the taste more. These are a family fav here.

A great recipe! Like the others I used 1 ad 1/2 cups sugar but instead of vanilla, I used almond. My family loved them!

For the second bach I once again cut back the sugar, added 2 extra tb butter and used vanilla. Then I swirled wild clover honey over the oats before blending them in to give them a deeper, richer flavor.

If I told you  to use 1/4 C. butter instead of 1/2 C. would you believe me.  Also the flavor isn't lost if you delete the salt?  And If I told you whole oats work well to for and extra burst of flavor?  Then you have my perfect No Bake Cookies.  These are the BEST!

This is the recipe I use, but I always cook them until  my candy thermometer reads 225-230 degrees.  I've never had a batch turn out well with the "boil one minute" part.  It always turns out when I use the candy thermometer.

My baby daughter has a dairy, egg, nut allergies.  A friend of mine had introduced this receipe to me without the peanut butter and using soymilk. We were thrilled it set up.  It was my first time eating chocolate in six months.  I have since played with the receipe.  I have substituted the milk with vanilla soymilk (no need for adding more vanilla,)dairy free margarine in place of butter, baker's sugar because boiling time is much shorter and so is stir time and I use Sunbutter instead of peanut butter.  I have added 1/4 cup sunflower seeds also at the end and it really makes the cookie that much better.  I hope someone else with children with food allergies will benefit from me sharing my tweeking of this excellent receipe.

I made a few changes, I only used 1 3/4 cups of sugar and added no cocoa.  My kida loved them they were a big hit at school for the halloween party.  I dropped the mix inside cookie cutters and then refrigerated them and they came right out of the cutters.

I made this recipe twice, the first time I followed the directions exactly and they turned out fine. But I like more peanut butter so the second time I used 1 cup of peanut butter instead of 1/2 and liked it better. The batter was thicker and made it a little easier to work with and they hardened up more quickly. Either way the recipe is great.

These were amazing!  A huge hit at preschool.  And they really do only take 15 minutes.

These are pretty good, but I did make a couple changes. I like my no-bakes chocolatey, so I used 1/2 cup cocoa, and I used butter instead of margarine. I also used 1/2 cup less sugar, and I used rolled oats instead of quick cooking. I boiled the mixture for 2 minutes, and they set up within 15 minutes.

These are excellent! I had lost my favorite "No Bake" recipe and was happy to find this one. I added 1/3 cup extra oatmeal, like I did with my old recipe, and they turned out perfect. This will now be my favorite "No Bake recipe.

I made these and used a 9 x 13 pan to save time.  I cute them into squares and wrapped in cling wrap.  One year I gave them out to nieces and nephews when they came Halloween night.  They asked for the recipe the next day!  Thanks for sharing.

I have made these three times. They turned out the best the third time. 

I used 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 2 cups (they are still a little on the sweet side, but I also tried using just 1 cup and they didn't turn out) and I boiled  the first set of ingredients for 90 seconds instead of 60. They set up within 15 minutes. 

These are great cookies and very easy to make!

Yum! Easy and quick. I've already made several batches - two times using substitutions: once I used Cheerios instead of oats - very good, except if you do this, use more Cheerios than the 3 C. called for in the recipe - I used 4 C. Also, the last time I made these I ran out of peanut butter so I used butterscotch chips. If you do this - use less sugar - maybe 1/4 or 1/2 C less. They seem a bit more crunchy with the chips - but I still like the peanut butter better. Great recipe - thanks!

I followed this recipe exactly and mine came out too runny. I would  boil for 2-3 min and add more oatmeal. If yours seem too runny just add more oatmeal until you get a stiffer mixture that you can roll into a ball in your hands. That should do it. By the way, they did still taste really good.

I can see why everyone is giving this one 5 stars - and why I am, too -- can I just say YUMMY -- this is going to be one of my new favorites - so easy to make - a great cookies - needs no eggs - no chocolate chips and no brown sugar - great when you don't have those ingredients on hand -- and great not to turn on the oven on a hot humid day with no A/C -- I love this cookie [bar] - I spread it out in a pan to make like a brownie - cookie bar -- it's so yummy -- there goes my diet ;-)

Haven't had No Bake Cookies in years.  Got a craving for them and stumbled upon this recipe.  It comes out tasting like no bake cookies, but unfortuantly mine never "set up" correctly.  I thought it would be hard to screw up no bake cookies but something went wrong somewhere.  The batter was much thinner than any other no bake cookie recipe I have tried and even when they were completely cooled they were still rather gooey.

I used this recipe to make cookies to send to my brother in the Army.  They turned out horribly.  The recipe didn't indicate how long to continue cooking all ingredients.  The cookies were runny and a complete waste.

I'm giving these a five star as I think they have potential.  I cooked them more like 2 minutes as I was worried about them not sticking, and they turned out just a little bit crumbly.  My kind husband squished the cookies together by hand and they tasted good.  I will try again only next time stick closer to one minute.  Thank you.

I had to learn that the trick to this is timing it once the mixture starts to boil. Unfortunantly, I had to throw out my first batch because I didn't do this properly. But the second batch was wonderful!!! Definently will make again!!

I made these at 10pm when a chocolate craving hit. Ingredients are usually stuff I have on hand anyway, which is always a plus. The flavor was great, the texture a little like fugde...yu-hum! They did their duty that night, and I'm hanging onto this recipe.

I love these! We had these a lot while growing up. I enjoy baking and this is a quick, easy treat for my sons. I kept everything the same except I added a tablespoon of chocolate silk (chocolate flavored peanut butter). These took only a few minutes and turned out great. I added the peanut butter to the other ingredients before boiling the mixture for two minutes. These are not dry or crumbly at all.

Thanks for a great recipe.  I think it is important to do the following:  Fill your sink up with hot, soapy water first.  Prepare all of your ingredients to have at hand in front of you, including laying out the wax paper.  Once the mixture comes to a full rolling boil, then time it one minute.  I mixed it around once about every 10 seconds.  After the minute, pour in the next ingredients and mix them together half way on the burner and then continue by removing it from the heat.  Work really quickly scooping it out, doesn't matter how they look.  Put your pot along with all those measuring things you used to have at hand in the hot soapy water for an easy cleanup!

I have searched high and low for this recipe.  my mother made these for us for christmas when we were kids,  thank you so much for sharing.  They are easy to make although you have to work fast to get them onto the parchment paper.  I absolutely love these,  and are so hard to resist. Thanks again for sharing.

Taste wise very good.  I added another cup of oatmeal because they were too soupy.  They took longer to harden than I suspected they would.

I definitely agree with allowing it to boil longer. However, I put the gooey ones in the freezer and then ate them all up! They were so yummy! Next time I'll boil for 2 min instead.

I decided to change the recipe a bit.  Instead of using milk I used soy milk (Silk). This brand of soy milk comes in vanilla and chocolate.Which, I think would be great to use as well.I used chunky peanut butter, also added coconut and rice crispies. This really turned out great!Everyone loves them!

When I made these cookies, they tasted delicious but they kinda were gooey and weren't really hardened all the way.  They fell apart easily and they looked like they were fresh out of my cousins diaper, which was a definite turn-off for my friends.

This tasted more like a fudge (very dense and thick)than a cookie. My husband who is a "sweet tooth" didnt care for it. My children and my friend did however, enjoy the cookies. I dont think this is a recipe I plan to make again.

These are my favorite cookies of all time!  They are very easy to make.  I have boiled the mixture from anywhere from 1-2 mins and they turn out fine either way.  I also reduce the sugar just just under 2 cups.  My whole family loves these, you can't go wrong.

I cooled them on a cookie sheet and cut them in squares.  Also adding cinnamon gives them a different taste.  Also adding some mini marshallow as the last step is another unique idea.

This recipe was really good and easy to do.  I made it with my 4 year old daughter and we had a great time.  She was able to help me from start to finish and it's really fast to make.  We will make this one again.

I made these cookies for my son to take to his grandparents house tonight, I ate one cookie and threw the rest out! I have the worst stomach ache. I refuse to let my son eat them for fear his little tummy will hurt. bottom line- they are way to sweet, if you like tummy aches, enjoy.

Definately the most convienent, delicious cookie ever!!  I always make when in a hurry and have to make a dessert to go out.  Everyone raves over these.  They are so addictive.  I always use about 5 tbls of cocoa, and boil for about 3 minutes, no more, otherwise the cookie falls apart.

I followed the advice of some other reviewers and boiled for about 2 1/2 minutes but the mixture turned to crumbs once I added the oats. I guess you must get the cooking time perfected for your climate for these to turn out. Next time I will follow the instructions and only let the mixture boil for 1 minute.

I remember eating these as a child and I was glad to find the recipe again.  I made these for my family and they went quickly.  My 6 children and nephew could not get enough of them. My husband said he ate too many and my brother came home to find only one left. He asked me to make more. A quick, delicious keeper.

These are DELICIOUS!  I made them using 1cup of vanilla flavored soy milk (instead of cow's) and NO butter or margarine.  I also boiled the mixture for about 1/2-1 minute longer.  They turned out absolutely WONDERFUL (everyone who has tried them agrees!!!), and they are much lower-fat AND animal friendly!!!  Oh, and if you make them this way, be sure to let them sit uncovered for longer than usual... mine took an extra hour or two to become firm.  But that didn't stop my family and friends from devouring them within the first 5 minutes!!!

I used regular long-cooking oatmeal and took this to a work party - two people asked me for the recipe and one even said she liked it better with the traditional oatmeal because it had more flavor.  The 2nd time I made it I accidentaly added the peanut butter before cooking it 1 1/2 minutes and they did not turn out! Oops!

Totally awesome!! These are just like the ones they served in my (Deepwater) elementary school!! All that was missing was the Melmac bowl and the hair-netted cafeteria ladies!!!!!!

I used regular(not quick cook) oats and soy milk and they turned out just like I remembered them!! I also took the others advice and let the mixture boil for 4 or so minutes before adding the vanilla(it splashed and sizzled-be CAREFUL!!) and peanut butter.

I have three words....YUM!! YUM!! YUM!!

i made these cookies exactly according to the recipe and they turned out as blobs of mush. many reviews mentioned tips for settling problems, but the bottom line is that this recipe, AS IS, is misleading. The instructions should be changed. I was left with wasted ingredients and wet mush.

These are my husband's favorite cookie! Here in Tennessee there is a little store that markets them as COW PIES...tookme forever to find the right recipe for them.  HINT: If you add extra chunky peant butter it adds that nutty flavor. I have also put coconut in these and they are good. I agree that by boiling for a little longer than one minute you can be assured that the cookie will harden correctly! I have made batches where you have to roll them off the wax paper!

This is a great recipe. My husband loves no bake cookies and I was having a hard time finding a recipe that included peanut butter. A couple of quick notes though....boil for at least 2 minutes. I had to throw several batches away after boiling for only a minute. Also....by mistake, I bought "old-fashioned" oats instead of the quick oats and used them anyways....they make the cookies very chewy for anyone who would like a chewier cookie!

So for a first timer making these, I had to try it two times to get them right.
First time I did the way it was directed and eh. Second time I went with the changes of 1.5 cups of sugar and boiling for two minutes, and they are not kidding guys- you gotta move with lightning fast speed otherwise those suckers dull up and turn into a crumbling mess (first time I was thinking, “I’ve got a little time, 30 seconds won’t mess it up that bad) and I was so, so wrong. . Get everything prepped before hand and stir everything up like a middle aged woman named Karen running late is watching you make her latte! Stir the entire time and dump em on the wax paper as quick as you can. And then behold your beautiful creations!

This became my families new favorite cookie after the first time I made them. I have now made them three times and have been experimenting with adding coconut. First time I added 1/4 cup, then I tried 1/2 cup and finally tried 1 cup of coconut. I think 1/2 cup turned out best. I love that these are not too soft and gooey nor too hard.

I added a bit more chocolate, used Jif creamy, and these are the best I have ever made.  Full rolling boil for a whole minute is key.

This recipe works for me every time! I have ALWAYS had problems before with the no bakes not setting up. It works with this one. I've used margarine (as the recipe says) and I used butter too. It works both ways.

The only modification I made was I allowed it to boil for 2 minutes per the reviews and I used chunky peanut butter. These turned out perfect! Would have liked to be a tad bit firmer but overall I give this a 9.5/10 on ease and taste! Definitely a recipe I'll be revisiting and using for potlucks.

These are outstanding! I have made them several times. The texture is through the roof and the flavor is dead on!
One time I made these with slightly more oats then called for, and it still tasted fine, however it ruined the texture. So be careful with the oats measurement!

I have made this several times now.  I made the recipe as originally stated and the cookies were too soft.  I cooked the chocolate mixture up to 3 minutes and it was more like what I remembered as a child.  This is only one of a few recipes that I have reviewed.  I think if you are to review a recipe you should make it exactly as written first.  I did that, then modified to make them more like what I remember.

This recipe is so delicious and easy. I did alternate a few ingredients . I substituted the chocolate powder with carob power..which you can pick up at any Whole Foods market or a place like that. Then I used coconut oil instead of butter and it had a flavored taste as well. Actually it set the cookie stronger. Then I used brown sugar instead of white sugar. Also I used a tad bit more than a pinch of salt..and viola very good. The results were great..omg sooo goood!!! Btw the video really does help alot..

I made this exactly as the recipe is written.  I brought the chocolate to a rolling boil then timed for 1 minute.  I scooped quickly to prepared wax paper.  My cookies turned out dry and crumbly.  What went wrong?

I have tried several recipes on this site for no bake cookies. This one is absolutely perfect! I use this recipe every time the grand-kids come over, and everyone in the family loves them! So, easy, and fast. I did increase the cocoa a bit. If you allow it to come to a rolling boil and then remove from heat, they set up perfectly.

This is my first time making these cookies, as I love no-bake peanut butter cookies.  I watched the video to be on the safe side and followed the 2 minute boiling directions.  The cookies turned out great! I may leave out or reduce the coco to get more peanut butter flavor next time. I used skim milk and real butter instead.

After a craving for chocolate, the only thing in my cabinet was unsweetened cocoa powder. I came across this recipe and it really satisfied the craving! 

I'm usually a little impatient with this recipe, so putting the cookies in the freezer and then keeping them in the fridge generally works pretty well.

Exactly what I was looking for in a no-bake cookie. I did make sure the mix came to a roiling boil before timing my minute boil, and added the cocoa after boiling the mix.

If you have peanut allergies try Almond Butter!!  I tried using Almond Butter since my husband is allergic to peanuts. I also used Vanilla Almond Milk since it's all we had.  Turned out wonderful!!!  Consistency is the same!  We like them with 1.5 cups sugar and boiling for 2 minutes as others have suggested.

These are awesome but I add a little more cocoa than the recipe calls for. They are devoured at family gatherings and are always requested to be made year round from family. I do boil mine longer than the one minute it calls for. A great way to check them to see if they are done is the old school trick you do with fudge, by dropping a tiny amount of the liquid into cold water. If it splatters, that means it needs to cook longer but if it turns into a "ball", it is done. Easy, yummy cookies.

Super easy to make.  I have followed the recipe and have mixed things up as well.  My family likes it with coconut milk instead of milk.  Half coconut oil and half butter, one cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of coconut sugar and chunky peanut butter.  The only problem with these cookies are waiting for them to cool.  The coconut milk gives it a nice creamy taste.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I used the steel cut oats instead of instant oats, and found that I liked no bakes much better. I had made them for someone that loved no bakes and I had never been a fan until I tried this recipe.

I love this recipe! It worked perfectly this time. Shiny, soft and tasty. Didn't change a thing...used real butter, 2% milk and Skippy peanut butter. In my experience, the weather, the type of peanut butter and butter really can make the difference. I stir constantly until the rolling boil, that can't be stirred down. The time can change between 1-2 minutes, watch the texture on the spoon. Then put a lid on the mixture for that minute without stirring. If heat is high you could burn the mixture. The moisture from the lid keeps sugar crystals from forming which makes the cookie dry and gritty...The lid hint came from Alton Brown making fudge. Works for me...

I think this is the same recipe I used over 50 years ago.  They are still just as good and always turn out great.  I have never heard of anyone who doesn't like them.  I do cut back just a little on the sugar and use butter in place of margarine.  I also like to add about 1/2 cup of coconut.  Yum.

I've used this recipe for at least 40years and have had good batches and flops. I've found you cannot undercook or overcook, it has to be just right like several have suggested. My granddaughter made a batch while I was gone. Of course, she didn't read the recipe through and because she didn't, she didn't cook them but beat them to death with a mixer. The cookies were horrible! She said, "They are no bakes!" Teenagers!!!

Followed as written except decreased sugar to 1 3/4 cup from 2 cups. Set up so fast we ended up throwing about half of the mixture away, even though all ingredients premeasured and we worked quickly and didn't over mix.

Really fast and easy! Turned out delicious. Only recommendation I would suggest is to put the oats and peanut butter in a large bowl and add the vanilla to the chocolate mixture after it has been made and then stir in chocolate to oats in the large bowl. This seems like it would be much less of a mess to clean up. Otherwise, great recipe!

These reminded me of the no bake cookies they used to serve at lunchtime at school. This recipe is easy to follow and the cookies taste good, but I didn't want to eat more than a couple before I was tired of them.

I'm giving the recipe four stars since it gives you the great taste and texture that you remember. But I really feel like it's more of a three star in the grand scheme of delicious cookie deserts.

I tried them today and was quite pleased. I emptied the batter into a pan instead. I followed the recipe and it worked well for me. Thank you Robin.

It's been way too hot to turn the oven on for weeks now. I finally decided to give in and try these stove top cookies. From reading the reviews, I think I let it boil a bit too long, because they were slightly crumbly. I turned away from the stove just long enough that I didn't start timing when it was at a rolling boil. That's completely my fault, they were still delicious, just a little messy. I'll be sure to keep a better eye on them next time!

These turned out really well!  So well, in fact, that I converted a co-worked back to eating No Bake's because she stated that all the other types she had had were very dry.

i have made these all of my life...i assemble them a bit differently...i mix milk, sugar, cocoa,butter, then bring to boil for 1 solid min maybe a few extra seconds...i judge it by the look when it starts to look glossy its perfect ...if you cook too long you get cookies that are brittle, not long enough soggy...so if you stir the whole time then when you cant stir away the bubbles then time for 1 min turn off heat add peanut butter let melt and vanilla...then i add a bit less oatmeal as 3 cups makes them too thick and not creamy enough try adding like 2 1/2 cups maybe a bit more ..if you play with this a bit you will be pleased...but please 2 min is too long to boil...like i said i have made these my entire life its always been 1 min after it comes to rapid boil that is the trick...and stir constantly...you will have better results good luck

Yum! perfect recipe, thanks Robin!

Just a couple changes to keep cookies from getting crumbly:

add peanut butter thats room temperature, or microwave it before adding. Cook sauce just a lil after adding peanut butter. add about 1/4 less oats than written. Also, use old fashioned oats instead of quick cooking oats for a better texture.

I really like this recipe in almost all versions, but I always put in less sugar than the recipe calls for. Also, I almost always make these in the microwave. The instructions are pretty much the same, other than you may need to modify the amount of boiling time based on your own microwave.

easy and tasty.  I imagine I could tweak this to sneak in a few healthy add ins but tasted great as is.  I added a bit of nutella because we are crazy about it. :-)  Worked fine but probably not worth it (maybe it you used all nutella it would be.

I like sweet cookies.  However, this was more like candy.  I put 1 and 7/8 cup of sugar in the recipe and it was still way too sweet.  1 think 1 1/2 cups is a more realistic amount.  If the sugar amount was reduced to a reasonable amount I would probably give it 4 or 5 stars.

These are delicious and so easy to prepare! Followed other reviewer's suggestions and waited to start timing until the mixture was at a hard boil. Definitely going to make a second batch for gift giving!!

Made this recipe with substitutions for the butter and milk, which I was really scared to do. I used 1/2 cup crisco (ew!) instead of butter and replaced the milk with a single serving hot chocolate mix with a 1/2 cup of water. I wasn't expecting them to turn out, but they turned out PERFECTLY. I may even like this variation better than the original.

This is the recipe I have used for years, and no other recipe hits the spot like this one.  I agree, you don't start your 60 second count until the hard boil begins, and be sure to use a stiff peanut butter. Some all natural pb, for instance, is a very thin consistency that prevented my cookies from setting. So don't be me. I had to refrigerate my cookies to get the pb to harden.  Not that this prevented us from eating every last one!!

My review isn't 100% accurate because I changed a few of the ingredients. I used splenda instead of sugar and soy milk instead of milk. These were WAY too sweet--all I can taste is sugar. If I made this again (which I will), I would cut the sugar in half and go from there. I would also double the peanut butter. ('cause I love PB!)

No-Bakes (Stove Top)are my ABSOLUTE favorite cookies! I made a small change. I added the peanut butter to the saucepan with the other ingredients, then when it comes to a rolling boil I start timing for 1 1/2 minutes. The cookies are the perfect consistency, everytime. Also I used butter instead of margarine.

Excellent recipe. I've had problems in the past with my cookies not holding together very well. I think the key (as others have pointed out) is to start timing the minute AFTER the ingredients come to a rolling boil.

I looked through a lot of reviews and couldn't figure out if I should be cooking the chocolate mixture on medium or high, so I thought I'd just share that I cooked it on medium high, and let it boil for 1 1/2 minutes (just to be safe) and they turned out perfect.  I didn't really have to rush scooping them, the mixture was still plenty soft as I scooped the last spoonful out.  They took about 20 minutes until they were hard enough to pick up.

Fail. Mine never set. I read a TON of the reviews trying to figure out how long to boil the mixture for, and decided to go with waiting until it was at a rolling boil, and then setting the timer for one minute. I'm guessing that's not long enough, or maybe it was too humid that day, or the baking gods were just not smiling down at me, but I ended up with gooey blobs of cookie dough. I ended up freezing them and eating them myself when I was looking for a chocolate fix. They weren't bad frozen, just not the crispy cookie I was hoping for.

Yummy!  I substituted almond butter for peanut butter and they came out great.  I let mixture come to a rolling boil (when it cannot be stirred down to below boiling point) and let it boil for 1 minute after that. Delish - thanks for the recipe!

The cookies turned out perfectly. I had no problem whatsoever with the firming up of these cookies. I did use chunky peanut butter and butter instead of margarine. Be sure to bring the mixture to a rolling boil (a boil that cannot be stirred down), then time it for one minute. I keep these in the fridge.

I was craving chocolate and all we had was cocoa powder, so I found this.  I halved the butter, cut out a 1/2 cup of sugar, and added a tbsp of cocoa.  Definitely have the oats, peanut butter, and vanilla all in a bowl and ready to dump into the boiling ingredients together- it wouldn't have worked well otherwise.I think it would taste better with natural peanut butter, since it's still very sugary, so maybe I'll try that next time.  It's a great quick fix if you lack ingredients and don't feel like running to the store.

I have always loved these cookies since my grandmother used to make them when I was a child.  If you think about it, it's essentially a fudge recipe with oats added in.  My grandmother used to add coconut as well as oats, which is a nice variation.  I like a heartier oat presence (and chewiness) and so I use half quick cooking, and half old-fashioned oats.  I have also increased the total amount of oats at times, which is a different way to make a less sweet, healthier cookie, and I find they turn out fine that way too.

Wayyy TOO much sugar! I have a major sweet tooth, but these tasted like granulated sugar. 3 minute boil is too long and 1 is too short. Next time I will try 2minutes and a lot less sugar!

Good. Just like I remember. My family called them "Bird's nest cookies". I've made these a lot over the years. This is a good recipe for them. Some reviewers say boil one minute, some say two minutes, so I do 1 1/2 minutes (after rolling boil) which seems to work perfectly.

I used butter instead of margarine (due to the fact that I didn't have any margarine) and I also only had old fashioned oats instead of quick oats.  It still turned out completely delicious!!

So yummy- made it vegan by using earth balance buttery spread instead of margarine and soy milk instead of milk. Used Smuckers Natural peanut butter (the kind you have to stir) instead of regular peanut butter and only 1 1/3 cups sugar. Used microwaving tips from other comments. Turned out great!

I followed another person's suggestion of letting the chocolate mixture boil for one minute.  I like the texture and thickness and will be making these again, especially in the summer months when I try to avoid turning on the oven.  I will also try my next batch with a little less sugar.

It wouldn't be fair, I suppose, to give a lower rating since I altered the recipe. I tried to lower the sugar amount by almost half, as I find most cookie recipes are too sweet for our tastes. However, while I did bring the mixture to full rolling boil, especially because I saw in previous reviews this was an issue, and I had "rolled oats", but I stilll couldn't get the mixture to "set up". It did taste great though! We kind of ate it with apple slices-and my 4 yr old loved it just by the chunk-ful (since we didn't really have "cookies".  I believe the sugar content must not be altered for the cookies to take shape...

Made these vegan substituting milk for unsweetened almond vanilla milk, and non-dairy margarine and they turned out perfect!  Make sure to use quick oats, as opposed to old fashion oats.  Next time I will substitute flaked coconut for peanut butter.

Best. Recipe. Ever!!  My 10 year old daughter made these for my No-Bake-Loving husband.  They turned out perfectly.  The only adjustment we made was boiling an extra 30 seconds.  It is difficult to judge when a rapid boil technically starts.  Will make these over and over and over again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a very easy recipe to follow...and according to my husband, these are the best no bakes he has ever had!  A very quick and easy recipe when you are craving something sweet!  I measured out all my ingredients before starting and from start to finish it took maybe 10 minutes.  We put the cookie tray in the fridge so that they would be ready faster!

Definitely the key to success for these cookies is boiling time, I have made this dozens of times and between 1 1/2 to 2 minutes works best. But a good easy recipe that everyone just loves to eat up.

Followed the recipe as written - my batch turned out on the soft side (I think I must have started my minute too early). I didn't want to throw them out, so I froze them, and they turned out good. In frozen form, they were soft enough to eat immediately, but firm enough to hold. It turns out these cookies are a great treat for the hot days of Summer as well!!!

These cookies are also one of my childhood faves. I notice a lot of differences of boiling time.
Could his have something to do with humidity levels?
After I moved to Florida, I had a lot of trouble getting my recipe I used in WV to work, then I got into a discussion when an old chap at my work had brought some that his wife had made.
He told me not to try making them when there is a high humidity level because they won't set correctly.
Does anyone know if this is true or should one of these longer boiling times solve the problem?

My mom made these when I was growing up.  I'm 49 and the youngest in the family. I believe the recipe came from her mom. This recipe has definitely been around awhile, but really nice seeing it on a website so more people can enjoy it. :)

Very yummy cookie!  I took the advice of another reviewer and cut the sugar to 1 1/3 cups and they are plenty sweet.

These are a childhood all time fave!!! I've tried other no-bake recipes and the consistency of the cookie was too soft, or the texture was different- but these were spot on :) thanks for this recipe! awesome just the way it's written!

This is a great recipe but I find that if you use imitation vanilla extract the cookies don't seem to set right. It might be a little pricier but the real deal is the way to go.

These cookies are AMAZING!!!  At my house, they dont last more than an hour!  They are simple to make, and everybody loves them!  I will be making them again very soon!  
I am a major chocoholic and these satisfy my cravings.  But usually I use less oats (about 2 cups instead of 3) so they dont dry out so fast and I think it makes them more chocolatey!  But who knows?

Tasted good, did do the rolling boil for 1 1/2 minutes.  The only thing that bothered me was the way they look, lol if I did not know better I would say the looked like cooked hamburger patties.  Don't think I will be making again, but glad I tried it.

Well, I'm a casualty of the not-boiling-long-enough phenomenon. These still taste great but never hardened. I thought I boiled for 2 min but might have been just under. Harrumph.

This recipe for No Bake Cookies is the BEST I have tried!  I made no modifications, and brought the liquid to a rolling boil before timing for 60 seconds.  The cookies turned out perfectly!  My family LOVES theses cookies!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Excellent no-bake recipe! This is one that it always requested in my house for the holidays and they always disappear before they cool. This EXACT recipe always turns out perfectly and I have made it dozens of times. Allowing the mixture to boil rapidly for exactly one minute is crucial. They are runny at first but set up beautifully. Make them small and don't bother trying to double the recipe. It will be crumbly by the time you form all the cookies.

Very good recipe!  I use this recipe when I do make them.  However, I did something different today.  I made them without butter/margarine....I didn't have any.  I have Nutiva coconut oil.  Used that to replace the butter/margarine.  It was Awesome!  I had to cook it longer than one minute....more like 3-4 minutes.

My sisters and I made no bake cookies all the time as kids but over the years I lost the recipe.  This one was just perfect and brought me right back to childhood!  I made sure to follow the advice of not timing the minute until my mixture was at a ROLLING boil (still bubbles vigorously, even while stirring) and they set perfectly.

I've made this a couple times and these are pretty good.  The first time, they turned out brittle because I let the sugar and butter mixture boil too long...but the 2nd and 3rd times, they were timed perfectly and i had chewy, sweet cookies.

clearly the laws of physics doesn't apply in my kitchen because 2x I have made these cookies following the advice and directions to a T even the advice of starting the timer as soon and the cocoa mixture hits a rolling boil and still my cookies didn't set up. I'll stick to my moms no fail recipe.

Our family loves no bake cookies, and I like this version best.  I like the texture when you add the PB after the boiling stage.  I use butter and double dutch processed cocoa; sometimes, dark double dutch.

Great and simple recipe.  I think cutting the sugar back to 1 1/2 c. lets the peanut butter and chocolate flavor take over more.  I also like to use Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate cocoa powder.  Never had a problem with them coming out once it hits a rolling boil and time for just over 1 minute.

Great and easy recipe!  Just as others have stated: wait until you have a full rolling boil before you start timing.  I have to make these cookies for work everyday (appx. 300 each batch) and if you wait before you start timing they will turn out perfect everytime.

Make sure you keep the heat on after you put the oats in until the mixture really thickens. Double the peanut butter.

Simple, easy to do!  I substituted 2oz. of semi sweet baking chocolate, added 1/2 c. more of oats, used SOY milk (slightly more than 1/2 c.), also used CRUNCHY peanut butter.  Set perfectly - and as others suggested, this was much better at 3-4 mins of boil time.  I didn't pre-measure anything & they set just fine.  Great, simple recipe for no bake cookies! Will use again!

There are other No Bake Cookie recipes, but this is the one my mom used to make - and my son's favorite. I've made this dozens of times - boiling TWO minutes, remove from heat add peanut butter, oats, and vanilla. Add enough oats for the desired consistency and drop on wax paper. Allow them to cool and enjoy with a cup of (soy)milk.

These cookies are delicious! I did follow the recipe exactly for measurements and such but with only one exception. I read a handful of reviews prior to starting and decided to take the advice of boiling the mixture just a bit longer. One minute of rapid boiling isn't long enough for the sugar to transition from just being wet and sticky to becoming a combining agent. I waited until my cocoa mixture came to a complete rapid boil and started timing then, for 2 minutes 15 seconds and the cookies turned out perfectly. Otherwise a SUPER easy and amazingly delicious recipe! Thank you! :)

This is a favorite at my office.  I have learned that you can cook this in the microwave for 4 mins, instead of boiling.  Perfect every time.

I just got done making these and they were dry, terrible looking, and fell apart.  I have made other recipes like this with no problem. I followed this recipe EXACTLY as stated.

Best cookies I"ve ever eaten.  Years ago we used coconut vs. peanut butter.  Just a heads up they're just as good.  I really love these cookies.  I like the fact that you don't have to use the oven at all.  Just the refrigerator.  I probably boiled everything for 2 minutes just because of the reviews that said 1 minute wasn't long enough.  When i put the cookies in the fridge, my boyfriend couldn't wait for them to harden and he went a sneaked a plateful.  You'll need a big cold glass of milk to go with these.  they are WONDERFUL!

it was my 1st time ever making these cookies and they came out GREAT.  let the mixture boil and then start the 3 minute countdown. next time i make these i will add less peanut butter (not a huge fan of pb) and add more cocoa. good recipe though.

This is the first recipe that I've used that set up perfectly and was shiny! It was wonderful!! My husband loves these cookies, but I could never get them right. I boiled the butter mixture for 2 1/2 minutes after the rolling boil started. I only had natural PB, and it worked well in the recipe. Thank you!

I add a bit more peanut butter - just because it is my family's preference - these turned out awesome!!!  If you follow the cook times - these will firm perfectly in a pan or on wax paper.

This is by far the best no bake cookie recipe I've tried. The peanut butter just makes the cookie so much tastier! I used 1.5 c. sugar instead of 2 c., and just eye-balled the 1/4 c. peanut butter, and the cookies turned out great. Rave reviews by all who ate them.

I've found that BUTTER needs an extra minute of rolling boil time compared to MARGARINE.  My family loves these cookies.  They are easy to make with ingredients on hand.  I usually cut the recipe in half to make 15 small cookies.

This was a perfect no-bake cookie.  We loved them. Just followed the recipe making sure it reached a full boil before timing it.  They weren't dry or crumblier than usual.  (aren't no-bake cookies by nature very tender?)

Very easy and yummy!  I followed other reviews and used about 1/3 c less sugar and made sure that the mixture was at a rolling boil before I timed my minute!

I've failed many times with No-Bake Cookies (go figure, huh?) but these were fantastic.  I timed my one minute of boiling starting with the rolling boil.  At first I thought I might have ruined them because the pan had a funny smell, not burnt but just not right.  But I guess that is their normal smell after boiling, because the taste was wonderful and they set up nicely.  Plus, the smell was only immediately after boiling, after that they smelled delicious.

Tastes like my childhood.  :)  Identical to my mother's recipe, only she added about 3/4 cup peanut butter instead of 1/2 cup.  Yummy.  You can use about half old fashioned oats instead of half the quick cooking without a big difference in texture - it's too noticeable with all old fashioned though.

First time the cookies came out too soft because I boiled them for 1 min. So I had made a ball out of each cookies and dipped in coconut flakes. They were pretty and delicious. Next time I boiled them for about 2 min. Came out great, candy-like cookies. Thanks for the recipe!

Yeah....the one minute rule-thank you for that! I've made these before with another recipe and they tend to get dry...but followed someones advice to stick to the one minute of boiling and these were perfect! My son says they are his favorite now and keeps asking me to make them again! So easy too.

On a hot summer day, it's great to be able to make a treat without turning on the oven. It's REALLY easy and covers the basic food groups for those with sweet tooth:  sugar, chocolate, peanut butter with oatmeal to remove the guilt. Next time I'll take the advice of others to reduce the amt of sugar.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipes EXACTLY as written & it turned out perfectly.  These were exactly what I remembered as a child & had a craving for.  I wish people would stop complaining when they don't follow the directions & whine the recipe wasn't good.  Unless you actually follow the recipe, don't bother reviewing.  Coconut milk is not the same as regular milk.

I love these cookies, this recipie is just like my mom's.  I have found though now that I have moved to Atlantic Canada (from Colorado) right at sea level, I have to add an extra cup of oatmeal for them to set correctly.  This might help some of you that find they aren't setting right.

I use basically the same recipe, but with 2 cups of oats instead of 3.  I don't think there would be enough liquid to coat 3 cups of oats properly.

The secret is to boil the mixture for 4-6 min... the longer you boil the more the sugar carmelizes and the quicker the cookies will set up once you remove them from the heat. If they look a little watery (like my first batch did) then just let the mixture set for a few min before spooning them out on the wax paper. These are so delicious!!! I've made them several times. With and without peanut butter... you can add almost anything to these cookies. I've even made coffee almond ones! I also use dark chocolate cocoa and it makes them even more decadent. I will continue to make these for a loooong time!

We have company coming for dinner, and it's too hot to turn on the oven, so I made these today with my 6 year old daughter.  I did the cooking part, she scooped them on the parchment.  I love the subtle peanut butter taste.  It's very easy, and the ingredients are staples, so it will be a great last minute "I need dessert, quick!" recipe.

My mother received this recipe from my elementary school cafeteria lady and I'm now 47! She made them once a month for the students.  The recipe is fantabulous as it is but we often change it up by using chunky peanut butter and occasionally adding raisins!

I took note of the following recommendations: I used coconut milk, increased the PB, decreased the white sugar and rapidly boiled for just under two minutes. My cookies sat in the fridge overnight and are greasy and mushy. The flavor is nice, but who wants mushy cookies? I'll stick with cranking my oven - even in 90* weather.

I shouldn't call these cookies, more like a chocolate candy. Very rich. My husband didn't like them, (too sweet)When the mixture boiled, I didn't stirr any more, boiled for 3 minutes. After putting in the oats, pn butter and vanilla, I stirred very well and fast. The cookies set up very fast and they are beautifully shining. Next time I will try adding some peppermint extract instead of vanilla.

this is the same recipe that a friend gave me years back.  I followed the advise of many other reviews and boiled the mixture for a full 2 minutes at a rolling boil and they set up very well (better than I had ever made them before!)

You need to let the cookies set out for awhile, otherwise they tend to stay really gooey.

These were the best no bakes I've ever had.  I did decrease the cooking time.  I brought it to a boil and then timed 45 seconds.  It's a personal preference though.  I like mine good and soft and not set up hard.  Good recipe!

These were fantastic and easy to make with kids. I did have to make some substitutions with the ingredients. I used brown sugar instead of white, was out of vanilla, and used organic peanut butter (sometimes this doesn't work as well in recipes, but worked fine in this one). I let the mix come to a rolling boil before timing, then I let them go for a minute and a half before mixing in the other ingredients. Next time I might try using 1/2 the butter and subbing in 1/2 virgin coconut oil and maybe adding some toasted coconut.

I always used another recipe that said 90 seconds, and I tried this today to see if it worked better. It needs at least 90 seconds, if not 2 minutes. I made these for a neighbor, and they turned out mushy and too sweet. Definitely boil for at least 90 seconds, and cut the sugar by about half a cup. Then they'll be wonderful!

I'm glad I found this recipe; it was exactly like the one I'd lost when I moved.  It was easy enough that my 9 yr old brother was able to help me, and the cookies set in a little less than half an hour.  Tasted great, easy to make; my little brother and I give this recipe a solid 5 out of 5!

These are great, just like we would make when I was a kid! The recipe as is is perfect. The first time I tried the microwave directions posted by a reviewer and I got chocolate crumbs, so dry they wouldn't even press into a pan to make bars. Then leery of overcooking, I cooked 1 minute AFTER it came to a rolling boil, and the cookies were perfect.

I followed the recipe using the 1 minute time, however they didn't want to set. I was able to redeem them however, by adding 1/2 chocolate chips and 1/2 peanut butter chips to the still hot mixture, and sure enough they firmed right up. Once I did that, they had great texture and they were firm without being hard or crumbling. Yum! I'll definitely make these again but I think I'll boil for 2 minutes next time.

My family loved these cookies! However, I will not add the extra 1/2 c. oatmeal that was recommended in the review next time.  It made them way too dry.  I had to add extra milk.  I think the recipe would be just right "as is".

These were so good! I only did a fourth of the recipe because I wanted to try it out first, but I regreted it and was glad I did it at the same time, or else I would of eaten it all! I didn't have cocoa powder so I used chocolae chips...much better! It had a great chocolatey taste. Yumm!

If you have trouble with the wax paper slipping, wipe the counter with a damp sponge first. And if it starts setting up in the pan, just dump and spread like a big pancake, then break up in chunks when cooled.

For a non-dairy option, use coconut milk instead of milk and be sure to use dairy-free margarine (no whey or casein added). The coconut milk adds a subtle cocunut flavor, but it goes well with the chocolate-peanut butter flavor of the cookies. My friend has a dairy allergy, and these make a great treat that I can share with her!

Follow this trick for a perfect no bake cookie- bring to a rolling boil over medium heat for 90 seconds and DO NOT STIR, if you stir these or boil them over high heat they turn out DRY, if you don't bring them to a rolling boil or don't cook them for 90 seconds then turn out too SOFT and do not set! You will end up with a perfect cookie guaranteed!!

I have made this recipe many times, it's one of my favourites.  However, I have found it to be a bit finicky.  I tried boiling for 1 minute, and that wasn't long enough, so I tried for 2 minutes.  Well that was a disaster, the sugar ended up burning on the bottom (even though I stirred plenty), I mixed in the oats and it was soooo dry and crumbly.  So I usually boil for 1 minute and then add a bit of flour when I add the oats in.  It works for me, and they are worth the experiments!

Yummy. I'll make these again. I made the cookies too big, I'll scale back next time - stick to the teaspoon suggestion. Excellent.

I followed this recipe pretty much. I boiled for 3 minutes. I also just eyed how much PB I put in, I think it would have been more than 1/2 cup though. Turned out great!

We were out of power for 7 days now.  Kids and I wanted cookies.  Found this and made it on the woodstove.  WOW!  I did make changes due to allergies and tastes.  I used Peabutter for the peanut butter, added shredded coconut, and about 1/2 cup Artisana Cocao Bliss (coconut butter and cocoa).  I used 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup brown.  These are amazing.  Super tasty and very easy to make.  I was suprised.  I have never done a no bake cookie before.  Plus, these are egg free so another family member can eat these since she is allergic to eggs.  We have a peanut allergy so that is why I subbed.  These would also be good with soynut butter as well.  There are hardly any left.  I have already added this to my recipe book!

The flavor was decent but it was so crumbly that it was impossible to make it into spoonful.  I don't know what I did wrong but I did heed others advice on boiling little bit longer than written.  Will not make this one again!

These came out awesome!! But don't try to double the recipe they didn't come out right.  (Fantasicook "To bake is To prepare, as food, by cooking either in an oven or under coals" Maybe you should read the recipe again)

I followed the recipe exactly and the cookies did not set up.  They taste good but are all gooey.  I guess I will try less milk and maybe boil a little longer.

recipe was great! followed it to a t!  I didnt know if you put the oats in pot or vice versa so i dumped it in the bowl with the oats and vanilla and peanut butter.  i let it boil (rolling boil) for 1 min and then i added peanut butter to soften and then dumped it.  Will make again.  Thanks

Finally, the recipe I made growing up! I only read the first couple reviews so the following might be in another review... The rolling boiling is the key to this recipe. I have made it several times and finally got the consistancy right. I did mess up and add the peanut butter before I was done boiling the other ingredients and it burnt to the bottom of the pan. So make sure to add the p.b. and vanilla along with the oats AFTER the boiling.

Excellent consistency but too much sugar.  Reducing sugar to 1 c. was still very sweet.  Great balance of ingredients otherwise.

These are soooooo good. I actually didn't let the mix bowl for 1 minute before adding the oatmeal and peanut butter. It made the cookies kinda gooey even after they cooled and I like them better that way. It was more fun to eat and I think they have a better overall flavor.

I've been making these for years but I think there are two keys to making these.  One is to make sure the mixture is at a FULL BOIL for 1 full minute (I do not like the consistency when I boil them longer).  And the other thing is not to make them on rainy days because it's been my experience that they don't set up right if there's too much humidity in the air.  My family loves these cookies, and it's nice for me that they are so easy and quick to make.

The best way to portion these out is with a small ice cream scoop. No mess, and they make consistent sized cookies!

Recipe is delicious.

Yum, yum, yum!!  I love these cookies.  I made some modifications to try to make these have less sugar and less fat.  I used 1 3/4 c sugar as someone suggested, but I used splenda for half of the sugar.  I used 1 stick of Land O Lakes light butter, skim milk, and natural peanut butter.  I also added 2 T milled flax meal and I used old fashioned oats since that was all I had.  The oats are a little chewy, which I like, and you'd never know there is flax in them.  Will definately make again!!

These were fabulous! I used the recommendations from others to cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups.  Once mixture came to a full boil, I started my timer for 90 secs.  I had my oatmeal, peanut butter & vanilla premeasured so I just had to dump it in.  They came out perfect!!

These were gobbled up quite quickly at my house. They were fantastic! but a bit too sweet for my liking. I don't think that i will make them again, even though my hubby raved about them! Just way too much sugar.

I followed the directions with only one minor adjustment and they turned out great.  I added the peanut butter and vanilla to the chocolate mixture and mixed until the peanut butter was dissolved.  Then I added the oats.  I used a small Ice cream scoop to scoop the cookies onto the wax paper placed on the counter. No need to use a cookie sheet.

This was an okay recipe, but I've honestly had better.  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers by adding peanut butter and vanilla to other wet ingredients to boil, which could be why they didn't solidify very well (even put them in the freezer to get them to harden, which worked until we started eating them).  They also didn't have as strong of a peanut butter flavor as I prefer.

This was my grandmother's exact recipe, and like another reviewer, we called them "boiled cookies" too!  I have found that you can use quick or regular oats, and I don't measure the peanut butter, I just add a big spoonful of it during the boiling.  We also boil for 1 minute, and usually the cookies harden fine. But for 
whatever reason, if it is rainy outside, they are likely not to get hard!

I have always had problems w/ no bake cookies. I bake alot, and you would think something this easy would be hard to mess up! I read a lot of the user reviews, and realized my boiling time was my problem. I thought I would give it another try, since these are one of my favorite cookies. I told my husband not to get excited, because they never turn out, but we were both excited with the results. I liked a jelly roll pan with plastic wrap and poured the cookies in the pan to cool. Then cut like bars. These turned out perfect! I am happy I have finally got the hang of making these. I will definatly make again and again!

Very good recipe. I cut back to one and one half cups of sugar, used extra chunky peanut butter, and used the old fashioned oatmeal instead of the quick cook.  The addition of the chopped nuts in the peanut butter and using old fashioned oats adds more nutrition and reduces the glycemic load.

I just made a 1/2 batch of these cookies to give them a try, and they turned out great.  My 4 year old just inhaled a couple and so did I.  I made sure to bring the ingredients to a rolling boil and then continue to boil for 1 minute more.  The consistency seems perfect to me.  I probably should have tried a recipe w/out peanut butter since my family are not huge peanut butter fans.  They still are fabulously yummy!

Easy recipe; just make sure, as other reviewers have posted, to have all your ingredients pre-measured and ready to go.  And, yes... the rolling boil should be timed at 2 minutes.  The only reason I'm rating this 4 stars is because I thought they were too sweet with 2 cups of sugar.  Other than that, this is a nice recipe that brought back great memories of when I had these as a little girl.  :)

I'd just like to add that the freshness of the peanut butter you use really makes a difference; if your peanut butter is not fresh enough it may taste as though you made a mistake in your preparation when you didn't. Also, try adding just a little bit (a couple teaspoons) of caramel. One more thing, sometimes I use chocolate rice crispies like cereal instead of oatmeal (you might think that the no bakes have enough chocolate in them already and the extra chocolate wont taste so good but believe me you got to try it). I commonly use 'Malt-O-Meal Cocoa Dyno-Bites' which comes in bags instead of boxes like normal cereal and it works great.

Classic no-bake recipe.  Excellent!  I boiled the mixture for 3-3.5 minutes and that was a tad too long (the cookies were a bit crumbly).

Probably, 2-2.5 minutes is right around right.  I have noticed several reviewers saying that their cookies wouldn't set up correctly and 1 minute (as the recipe says) is probably not enough.  If your cookies don't set up it's most likely because the mixture didn't get hot enough (whereas if it's crumbly or a bit dry, it was boiled a bit too long).

Also, beware of sugar subs for this type of recipe because they can do unexpected things (I know for a fact that granulated fructose simply won't work with this recipe).

This has always been a favorite in my house.  These cookies are easy and the ingredients are always on hand.  
If I may mention this; Ladies if you need a PMS chocolate fix, this is it!  An excellent recipe for summer too because you don't have to turn on the oven.

I started making this recipe about a month ago and have since made over ten batches for different people/functions.  They take about ten minutes to make including the time to get all the ingredients from the cabinet.  

I quickly divide up the items to be boiled and separate them from the items to be added (pb, vanilla and oats) so they can be added quickly after removing from heat.  I then lay out a sheet of wax paper and then get to work.  So easy!

Boiling seems to be about 2 1/2 minutes to get just right.  This is with adding 3/4 cup crunchy peanut butter (the peanuts are awesome in there!), 1/3 cup coconut (even better texture!) and 1/2 cup less sugar (have to do something about that 170 calories per cookie.. hehe).

This recipe is great! I followed the directions word for word and I wouldn't change a thing. They are not to sweet (at least for us). I set the timer and let it boil extactly one minute, then took it off the heat and added the other stuff, which was pre-measured (peanut butter first, so it would melt). They set great and were not grainy! Definitely a good one :)

These are a nice change from baked cookies! We would make these all the time in high school (Ohhh memories). I used chunky peanut butter, added about 3/4 cup of coconut flakes, and added about 1/2 cup more oats so they would be more filling! I heated the saucepan ingredients over medium heat, and once it came to a rolling boil, I stirred it for 1 1/2 minutes. Thanks!

Perfect! I have tried this "cookie" for many years and it has NEVER set. This recipe worked wonderfully, they were perfect. The only changes I made were that I added 4 Tbsp. of cocoa and I boiled it for just about 2 minutes. Thank you so much for the great recipe!

My favorite cookie! I substituted Splenda for the sugar and boiled for 90 seconds. With the splenda it is not as good as with sugar but still VERY yummy and worthy of 5 stars!

Couldn't be easier! The results are perfect--not dry & crumbly and yet not gooey either. With four cookie choices at our son's party, these were the first to be gobbled up!

My son (age 24) requested these cookies for his birthday.  They were great!  I added an extra 3/4 cup of Oatmeal.  The cookies are also wonderful with chopped nuts.

This was my family's absolute favorite dessert and we called them "Fudge Quickies".  When I got married I was sure to ask my mother for this recipe.  As many times as I've made it, I never could memorize the recipe.  The trick is to boil it at least a minute although I boil it for closer to two minutes just to make sure they don't turn out too runny.  Of course, the recipe is so good that even if they are runny, they will still get eaten.

I Love these cookies. When I was 13 I became allergic to peanuts and have craved them forever. I just found a substitute for peanuts. It is soy butter. It looks, smells and tastes like peanut butter but is made from soy. I made these cookies this weekend with the soy butter and they turned out perfectly. I also cooked mine in the microwave. I just would stop and stir frequently.

I accidentally put in twice as much peanut butter, but it came out perfect! So good! Normally I've had recipes  suggest I boil for 2 minutes, and then the cookies turn out dry and ashen. These are awesome. However, I didn't make cookies, I poured them in a baking disk and cut them into squares like we had in elementary school. Brought back great memories, thanks!

These turned out exactly as my mom used to make them.  Yum!  I only boiled it for 1 minute and they're a bit soft but hold together fine.  I'm at a high altitude, though, so maybe that makes a difference?

I think the reason these come out runny is because my old recipe says to use 1/2C cocoa powder....and this is less.

YUMMY!! FUN!! AND EASY TO MAKE!! These are great tasting cookies.  Very sweet. I used some of the suggestions from previous reviews i.e. I used rolled oats/old fashioned oats(21/2 cups) and raw organic sugar.  I also boiled it for 2-full min. However I believe that 1 1/2 min would also do the trick and allow you a little more time to place the cookies on the wax paper before they set.  I also made a batch using crunchy peanut butter.  I found those not to be as creamy as the ones I made with the smooth peanut butter. As stated earlier these cookies are yummy my whole family loved them. TRY THEM AND ENJOY!!!!!  OH... I almost forgot I also used organic CAROB POWDER...you'll never miss the chocolate(I promise).

When I was a child, some 50 odd years ago, we called them haystack cookies also. I had lost the recipe and truthfully as much as I used to make them I should have had it memorized. I was glad to have found it again. And like the other reviewers have said, you must boil with out stirring for at least one minute. I personally go for two. I have made it without oatmeal, and used real butter and cream. It made a fabulous silky fudge type candy.It is a recipe that is easy to alter to taste.My grandkids adore it.

Thank-you, thank-you, thank-you!! No-bakes are my most favorite cookie and I have tried to make them for years, but they would never set up. Well, I thought I would give it another try and make your recipe and they turned out PERFECT!! This recipe is one I will be making for years to come! Thanks so much!!

I lost this recipe a couple of years ago so i have been trying many other recipes that kept coming out dry like the ones you buy in they grocery store-I thank you so very much for reconnecting me with the delicious chewy ones i have been missing.
P.S.I put mine in the freezer to cool and that's where they stay for about a day- till they're discovered!!
THE BEST NO BAKE COOKIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!

I had a little trouble with the first two batches, but the family ate them anyway. Now I seem to have it down and these are really good!

I tried recipe twice and they came out way too chewy  both times, nothing like the picture. They should not stick to the wax paper.

These are fabulous. My grocery store sells choc-PB no-bake cookies at about $4 for a dozen. I got a lot more cookies for a lot less out of this recipe, and it tastes better, to boot. I stirred in the PB first before adding the oats at the end. That helped make sure that I didn't get PB clumps. Hubby is chowing these down, and he doesn't normally have a sweet tooth.

Great recipe!  Just like what my babysitter from Michigan used to make when I was a child. Followed the recipe exactly, except used butter instead of margarine - came out just as well.

These were so easy and came out just perfect. I brought them to a chocolate buffet and everyone loved them. I boiled my mixture for a full 1 min 15 seconds, and instead of dropping the batter into cookies, just pressed it into a 9x13 pan. Then, after it cooled completely, I cut them into little squares. Yum!

This is not as good as it could be, so I made some changes.  I bumped the cocoa to 1/2 cup.  I also used unsalted butter instead of margarine, but that's a personal preference.  I NEVER use margarine ever.  I would also cut back a little on the oats, down to 2 and 1/2 cups.  With these changes, these are just like I remember from my childhood!

I've been making this recipe for years with only a few minor changes that make this easy recipie even easier.  I only use 1 stick butter and I use 4T cocoa.  I put the milk and butter in a glass bowl, and microwave for 1 min.  Add salt, cocoa and sugar and microwave for 5 min, stiring occasionally.  Add vanilla and p-nut butter, blend well, add oats and stir.  Drop by spoonfuls onto wax paper and throw in the fridge.  I love that I always have all of the ingriedents on hand, and if I am having a real chocolage craving I will put the first tray in the freezer.

These are the best!  My mom used to make them many, many years ago for all the neighborhood kids and we used to call them "Mom's Cookie Crumbles".  They never lasted long enough to put in an airtight container (or to see if they would get stale). So easy to make and so good that everyone loves them.  I substituted Splenda for Baking for the sugar as these really are sweet.

These are very good.  Next time I will add more cocoa, to give them a darker look and taste.  Be very careful not to overcook the mixture, or else they will have a grainy texture.  Overall, a very good cookie.

I use the microwave instead of stove and it works great.  Also I add up to 1/2 c of cocoa and boil the ingredients for 4 minutes.  Stir in peanut butter first to melt it before adding oatmeal.  I also add 1/2 c chopped pecans and 1 c coconut and reduce the oatmeal to 2 1/2 c.

These turned out great!  After cooking the mixture for 2 MINUTES, the consistency was perfect.  I used a little brown sugar in place of white sugar for some extra flavor too.

My husband loves these and your recipe is great. 
To cut down on calories I used Splenda and it worked out just great. You may want to add a few drops of water to get the right consistency when using Splenda.

fantastic and easy to make!  I took the advice posted here and made sure to spoon them onto the wax paper really quickly and i didn't incur any problems.  i'm definitely going to keep this recipe and use it around Christmastime.  Because, y'know, there just isn't enough chocolate products at Christmastime already :)

My 13 year old son recently asked me to make these cookies but I didn't have a recipe.  I would have to say this recipe turned out great.  I cooked 2 minutes once it came to a full boil and they were just right.  All my son could do was give me a big smile and a thumbs up.  He loved them.  Thanks.

I didn't eat these, since I don't care for oatmeal, but I made them for my husband and his "crew" at work. There were none left, so I can only assume they were good. They smelled heavenly, and were so easy to make. I made them slightly bigger than the recipe dictates, and it didn't take them too long to cool. Will make again for my hubby.

So easy and so incredibly delicious! I made a couple batched for our big family Christmas party. There were some fancy desserts there, but this were the biggest hit. Several mentioned they had made them at some time in the past but had forgotten about them. They are just dangerous for me to have around the house because they are so hard to resist. Thank you so much for sharing!

By the way, I followed the directions to the T, starting the timer at the boil. They came out perfect each time. Getting ready to go make more right now. :-)

Super easy, especially if you have an extra set of hands.  Make sure you have your waxed paper all ready to go before you start.

I love this recipe. I have been making these cookies with my kids for over 25 years. This is the first cookie I made with the kids. They are now 27 and 22 and still ask for them. I have never had problems with the cookies turning out to crumbly or gooey. I have always waited until the mixture has come to a full rolling boil then start my timer for 2 minutes. I believe that if your cookies are not setting then you started your timer to early. Your mixture has to be at a full rolling boil before you set your timer.

Excellent no-bakes!! I previosly had a recipe that called for 2 cups quick-cooking oats and boiled hard for 3 minutes, and those cookies did not work at all - they were always flat, gooey puddles. So I definitely recommend boiling for 1-2 minutes and using 3 cups quick-cooking oats. Also, with this recipes, I added about 1/2 cup of grape nuts (for an added crunch and nutritional benefit), which tasted delicious. :) Highly recommended!

Very yummy....I read all the differing reviews, concerning how long to boil for and if they were too soft - and ended upboiling for one minute, using three and a HALF cups of quick oats....and real choc instead of cocoa (didn't realise I'd run out!) I made them for the children in my partner's kindergarten class and they went down a treat!!

My husband is soooo picky, but he loved these!!  Said they were the best he ever had, one batch lasts about a day.  A lot of things with baking cocoa he thinks are bitter, but he didn't feel that way about these.  I make them a couple times a week!!!

Yummy.  Made these cookies on April Fool's Day for my daughter's class instead of the gross tasting "Cat Poop Cookies" offered on this site.  WOW!  They disappeared!  Placed tablespoon fulls of "dough" on a tray then popped the tray into the freezer.  After a few minutes, I took them out and gently gave them the appropriate shape while leaving them on the tray. Quick, easy and very realistic.

These are good, fast, sweet treats.   I took others' advice and boiled for longer (2 1/2 minutes). I didn't have any problems with them setting.  I also sprinkled them with powdered sugar to make them a little prettier.

Cheap, easy, quick, and absolutely delicious. I always use rolled oats because I like them a little more chewy. I used soy milk in place of cow, added an extra tablespoon cocoa,used half the butter and they always turn out great.

You can increase the cocoa to 5 T if you want to.  That's the way my original recipe reads, and they turn out a bit darker and richer.

These cookies were mine and my siblings favorite when we were younger. We use to make them weekly and never get sick of them. I lost the recipe when I grew up and was ecstatic to find this one. My husband can't get enough of them. I just made them for a Vegan friend with soy milk and margarine. They turned out great! Thanks for the recipe!

I added more peanut butter for more of a peanut butter favor instead of a strong chocolate flavor.

These are delicious.  I'm glad I read the reviews first. I do agree that the directions need to be written in a little more detail.  I went with others reviews and lengthen the cooking time to about 2 minutes after it comes to a full boil. They turn out GREAT!

Excellent!  My husband isn't too hip on sweets, but he loved this!  Very easy to make.  You definitely need to move fast when dropping onto wax paper.  I will DEFINITELY make again and might try adding nuts to replace a portion of the oats.

A favorite this summer.  No oven.  And I'm sure it will be a favorite all year round.  The peanut butter adds a special flavor.

These are a really good cookie! I would have everyone try them! I did have to make them twice before I could get them to set though. Note: when it say's to rapid boil for 1 min., I suggest that you should rapid boil for 4-5 min. I did and they set up perfect! They are a fast and easy cookie and have a great taste! You really should try them!!..

These cookies were a staple item growing up in the South. Although most of the same recipes call for the same ingredients, the key to this one being the best, in my opinion, is that the author made sure to mention ‘working quickly’! If you don’t start spooning them out as soon as you get the mixture completely combined, they won’t set up and will stay tacky. Take the author and my word for it, work quickly to get them on the wax paper! They will begin to set up almost immediately.

Very good!  I bet I haven't made these in  40 years.  I think next time I'll keep on stirring them till they're cool and almost set and then scoop them out with a small ice cream scoop and serve in little paper cups to make them more festive,

I've used this recipe for the last few years.  I made the mistake this year of using all natural JIF peanut butter.  Learned my lesson the hard way!  DO NOT USE ALL NATURAL!  Batch 2 will be made using the original JIF peanut butter!

Made these last night for my christmas potluck at work. They tasted so creamy and delicious. My oven had broken this week right before my holiday baking :( So this was an excellent alternative for me and it was more than easy to whip up.
I followed exact instructions and boiled it for about a minute longer than it stated and they turned out great!

I've been making these exact same cookies for 50 years with my mom and the timing is 1 minute AFTER you bring it to a rolling boil.  That is the only thing that is different and more than likely why people are having difficultly with the cookie being mushy and not setting.

I added mini marshmallows after I had it all mixed turned out great you can even add crushed candy canes for Christmas cookies. Make another batch and leave out the cocoa powder you can still add the marshmallows. Enjoy and create your own.

After watching the video, the tip about allowing to boil for 2 minutes was PERFECT! They were absolutely fantastic, the kids loved them and even said “DAD, you should make these all the time!”  All in all.... great recipe!! 1000% Approved

Doubled the recipe, used 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream and 1/2 cup milk, Substituted margarine with butter, boiled for just a few seconds over a minute. Mixed the pb in with the oats while the sugar, butter, milk, and cream were boiling. These things are rich but so good!

I used a stick of salted butter *and* a pinch of salt.

Also, used 5oz. of crunchy peanut butter. 

I let it boil for about 90 seconds -- slightly past the soft crack stage.

Turned out really well!

These were really good! I did follow the advice to cook the oat mixture longer... a bit over two minutes and the cookies firmed up nicely.

I didn't have any milk so I used heavy whipping cream.  Still great flavor, maybe just a little bit richer.

So I gave this a 5 star because what I did was no ones fault but my own lol these cookies were extremely sweet and didn’t taste at all what I was expecting (they were good without a doubt but not what I was expecting ??), and here’s why, my mom use to make no bake cookies as well, but she didn’t add peanut butter, or milk, she would add condensed milk, coconut, and 1/2 cup of cocoa, and I think she said something about marshmallows. So this was totally my bad! But like I said, these no bake cookies still impressed my husband and my 9 year old ?? I’d say these cookies taste dangerously close to peanut butter fudge! Thank you!

Did not add salt during the cooking process, instead try:

Add 1 cup chopped pretzels to saucepan RIGHT before dropping on the cookie sheet.

My family loves this basic recipe. I prefer to use extra fine sugar (more of a melt in your mouth texture). I use about 4 tablespoons of cocoa. We use the creamy peanut butter over the crunchy but it’s a matter of taste. I don’t use any salt because there is enough salt in the butter.

These turned out very well! The only issue I had, was that the directions didn't specify what  setting to cook them over, I referred to a similar recipe, it said to cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, then after boiling for one minute,  remove from heat to add the peanut butter, oats and vanilla. I didn't have any wax paper, so I put mine on a cookie sheet sprayed lightly with cooking spray. They set up just fine! Tasted great! I'll definitely make them again!

I would never use margarine. I used butter and reduced sugar to a scant one (1) cup. I also used Almond milk instead of dairy. Delicious. I agree with Lorna that the base needed to boil longer and will take to a rolling boil next time. The cookies were too soft when I followed the recipe.

My favorite recipe for no bake cookies!  Only change I made was using half brown sugar and half white.  It must be adding the peanut butter last that makes these cookies soooo good!

Not enough details in the instructions and cookies were way too sweet.  Too much sugar, not enough salt or cocoa.  No idea how long to let it boil or when to reduce the heat.  Also, my saucepan is way too small to combine everything.  I ended up putting oats in a large mixing bowl and then pouring the cocoa mix over it and blending with a wooden spoon.   A good recipe depends on how much detail is in the instructions...and there were none is this.

I made recipe exactly as stated (did cook for longer as others suggested) but found it to be very sweet.  Otherwise, very good.  Would love suggestions on how to tweak it by taking out some sugar and how to adjust the other ingredients if I do that?

LOVE no bake cookies! Though if you don't freeze them as long as needed then they will be melty and mushy. This is my altimeter favorite dessert! Enjoy!

These were sooo good. They tasted like gooey fudge brownies, but better! My entire family loved them (even the ones who don't like no-bake cookies). I substituted almond butter for the peanut butter, and usually when I do that they don't turn out as great, but these blew all previous no-bake recipes out of the water!

Used Nestle’s Dark Cocoa and butter instead of margarine. Also, let the cocoa/butter/sugar/milk mixture boil for 1 minute before adding the peanut butter and vanilla helped in holding the cookies together. Great recipe!

This recipe is amazing! It is also helpful that it is gluten-free. the only thing I would change is to add the peanut butter and vanilla BEFORE the oats. Otherwise, it's always been perfect.

I changed the boiling time to 3 minutes and it came out perfect! I also mixed the peanut butter in first after it was down boiling in order for it to mix together properly !

I lost my recipe that I usually use. This one is too sweet, and I even added extra cocoa. I will look for a different no bake recipe. This one has way too much sugar.

I have been making this basic recipe for years. I agree with Lorna's suggestion to bring to a rolling boil and then time. I cooked it more like 2 min. I love these like a cookie + candy in one! Family inhales them!

The cookies will NOT set up properly if you follow this recipe exactly - even w/ the rolling boil.   Use 1.5 cups sugar AND  rolling boil for 90 seconds.  I've  used this recipe twice now and both times were disaster.  Had to remake....

Delicious! This is the exact same recipe that my mother in law gave me that she used for years,  except she adds coconut flakes. We also add them because we love coconut. Made these into bars this time for Superbowl.

Yummy and easy to make. Don't start timing till mixture comes to a full roiling boil

I made this recipe exactly as it states.  They turned out great!  I usually have trouble with my no bake cookies setting properly, but not this time!  I will definitely make these again!

Turned out wonderfully. My granddaughter made this batch. We did boil them a additional 2 minutes. May have been to much, but looking really good now. We’ll see when they cool.

I followed the direction and watched the video, and read the reviews.  The flavour is fantastic, but mine came out crumbly.  I was disappointed.  However, I can see what the possibilities are if they came out correctly.  This recipe is worth trying out again.   For the crumbles (and there`s a lot of them, it would be perfect over ice cream or used as crumble for apple crumble).

I will need to try take 2 of this recipe.  It may be an ingredient issue.  I used old fashioned oats instead of quick cook as it was what I had on hand.  The texture didn't turn out to my liking.

Made these with my 7yr old. Used chunky peanut butter but also gluten, dairy, and soy free. Still tastes like I remember as a kid. Unsweetened almond milk. Soy free margarine. Gluten free oats. Food allergies 0 me 1. Thanks!

Followed the recipe EXACTLY.  Seemed to have a bit too much margarine.  Need less margarine and more peanut butter.

Added some Christmas sprinkles on the top half the batch.

This is the standard recipe that I’ve been making for years. My favorite cookie! If you’re having trouble getting them to harden, here’s a couple tips. Stir your mixture until all the butter has melted. Stop stirring at that point and let it come to a rolling boil. Once it comes to a rolling boil, cook it for two minutes. Always works for me.

I followed the additional notes concerning boiling time. I also added 3-4 handfulls of oats because my batch seemed to liquidy. I couldn’t find my wax paper so I used aluminum foil. The cookies turned out scrumptious! I’m so happy! I love these cookies and I finally made them. I’m glad I picked this recipe. I forgot to take a picture when they were all lined up nicely on the cookie sheet so please excuse the mess! Oh I used extra dark Hershey’s cocoa.

This is the same basic cookie we all grew up with.  No need to tweak it at all.  Remember to start the timer after it reaches a full rolling boil.  
They disappear fast. :)

These are AMAZING. I made these on a whim after doing an internet search for no-egg dessert recipes when I had a craving for something sweet but was out of eggs. After reading the reviews, I increased the boil time to 2 minutes, and cut the white sugar back to 1.5 cups. They were PERFECT. My husband and I both fell in love with them, and my diet is going to be in trouble!

Great recipe to follow! Instead of cooling my cookies on parchment paper, I actually like a rectangle cake pan with parchment paper then spray it with Pam cooking spray. Once that's done, I poor my peanut butter no bake recipe straight into the pan. I let that cool in the fridge & sort of set while I make my chocolate no bakes. Once the chocolate recipe is all done, I poor it over the peanut butter no bake. Again I place the pan in the fridge to cool & set. Cool for  about an hour, cut & serve. The end result is a Reeces Cup no bake bar! This is a little time consuming but easy & absolutely delicious!! I hope y'all try this. Enjoy!

I first tried these when I was at a potluck in Florida. The guy who brought them said his mom makes them all the time. I think I ate about 80% of what he brought!! No shame here. :)  

Some notes from my learning that hailed from disasters:

- I live at a high altitude in a very dry area. You may have to adjust your recipe. I had to adjust boiling time and milk. Don't be afraid to experiment. 

- Use a big enough pot to do this or you will have a big mess to clean up and none of it will be edible. 

- Use unsalted butter instead of margarine. I've found margarine doesn't seem to let the cookies set up. Don't get me wrong. They are still edible (the cook gets the edible mistakes, right?). 

- Please wait until you have boiled the candy and taken the pot off the heat before you add the vanilla as it evaporates pretty fast so wait so it gives the cookies just another layer of flavor.

- If you want a really easy way to get these cookies out onto the wax paper quick, use a little disher, like the ones for ice cream. Inside on the sweeper is a number that tells you what size it is. Get yourself a disher that has the number 100 on it. Perfect size and makes the job way faster. Also, these are really not going to spread much so there is no need to leave a lot of room between each cookie. 

- Lastly... if you really want these to last until the family gets home, you get to that event, or you make it to your friend's birthday, do what I do...make another batch!

My grandmother made this when we were kids. Such a wonderful treat. Only thing she did different was use crunchy peanut butter.  This is a great snack. Thanks!!

Dry crumbly mess and waste of all the ingredients! Night before my son’s bday and I have to find a new recipe and hope I have enough to start over! Not. Cool.

Just like how we used to make them with grandma when I was a kid! I actually discovered this morning that our milk had gone spoiled.... I decided to use the ALMOND MILK we had in the fridge as my 4 year old stared at me in much disappointment.. to our surprise they turned out just perfectly! And I actually think we're going to use almond milk from here on out, they are absolutely delicious!!!!

Followed recipe and waited for them to fully cook. They are way too soft and gooey. They take pretty good, but hard to handle.

Turned out OK. I always had issues with the cookies setting in the past. I used a digital thermometer and let the sauce mixture get to 235 F  degrees then added the peanut butter and oatmeal and they set.

I’ve made this a few times now, after trying out other recipes. It’s the only one that works great “as-is”. That being said, I personally like to add 4 tbsps of cocoa instead of 3, and butter instead of margarine. Reminds me of my mom’s!

Yes! great recipe. The only thing that I changed is I used butter (I don't buy margarine), also, I  took the advice of one that said to start counting your 1 minute boiling time when the chocolate sugar combination is at a rolling boil and I only have old fashion oats (but they worked fine!). This will be my 'chocolate fix' for tonight. Lol.

Used brown sugar, taste great!  Waiting on them to set been about an hour on counter.  Also, I let it come to a full rolling boil before starting the timer.

Well, learn how they turned out when you buy regular, Old Fashioned oats by accident instead of Quick.  I put the oats into the boiling mixture and cooked them for the 5 minutes you are supposed to on the can.  Turned out perfectly!   Very chocolate-y and nice texture to them.

These cookies are truly amazing! I am constantly asked to make them for friends and family and trust me when I say they don’t last long in our house ??! I also didn’t get a picture because of the same reason (they get eaten up fast)! When you bite these cookies they melt in your mouth and are perfect for when you are craving something chocolaty! I do recommend that before you boil the first set of ingredients that you prepare the oats, peanut butter, and vanilla that way you can dump them in right away and don’t run the risk of burning the chocolate and sugar. I also recommend boiling for 2 minutes.

Read through comments before making them, as I always do, and cut back on sugar by 1/2 c. and increased ROLLING BOIL time to 2-3 minutes with starting ingredients. Turned out perfect and super yummy! Kids are currently waiting for them to cool and devour them. If there happens to be any left to cool by the time they're done digging in them.

Ah, the childhood memories.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

(Hint: Make sure you use regular oats and not something like Coach's Steel Oats. Coach's might be okay if you cut the amount in half.)

Have made these cookies for 35 years but, was too lazy to look for my recipe card. The cookies were fine . The family felt something was missing.  After comparing the two, this recipe  does have the same instructions as mine . However, my aunt's  uses 3-4 Tablespoons of cocoa powder (we like 4) and 3/4 cup of peanut butter.  Remember bring to a rolling boil then turn the timer on for 1 minute. Also, be mindful of the weather - humidity may flatten them.

My mom made these when I was a kid, called it school fudge. Let me tell you, I had a hell of a time finding a recipe for it, since I’ve only known it as school fudge. My mom died when I was a child and sometime when I was a teenager, I started wanting it again. My mom had a “cookie journal” she shared with her sister where most of our recipes were stored, but the recipe didn’t list how much milk to use! This recipe helped me to rediscover a family tradition. Thanks!

Simple and delicious!  I was searching for a quick and easy sweet treat for my Hubby and I to enjoy on football Sunday.  This did not disappoint.  It wasn’t my first time making no bake cookies but I modified this batch to give us a sweet treat but not overly sweet.  I used 1 1/2 cups of sugar and 2 1/2 tablespoons of cocoa.  I also add the peanut biter to the mixture to boil.  Oh, and I substituted regular milk with almond milk.  The results....absolutely yummy!

I’m finished wasting ingredients on this recipe. The flavor is exactly what I’m looking for, so I’ve made 4 batches. I boiled each at a different time and still results in a cookie that doesn’t behave. Boiling for 2 minutes from the rolling boil as reviewers suggested is far too long, dry crumbly cookies. Boiling for one minute, same results.  So I thought maybe they don’t understand what a true rolling boil is and are timing it too early. So I started the one minute timer from a rapid boil, the cookies still didn’t have the texture I was looking for. On my way to the store to buy more ingredients to try other recipes. I tried...I really tried.

Ok. I have yet to find a recipe that works for me. I have the worst luck making these! I'll try again with some advice from others comments.

I've been trying to get these cookies right for years. This recipe and the tips from the comments section have given me the perfect cookies! I boil for a full 2 minutes to get them to set properly. I guess it depends on your pans and stove but my sweet spot is a full two minutes.

I can’t have dairy so I substituted unsweetened vanilla almond milk for milk and coconut oil for margarine and they turned out great. Delicious cookies with a hint of coconut and a great texture. Yum!

I have made this recipe many times, and every time I forget things! Like I forget to put the butter in the microwave, for the cookies turn out better when I do, or to bring to a rapid boil. I never try to do EXACTLY everything right, but they always turn out differently.

Only 4 stars because the rolling boil advice of 2 minutes was spot on for firm cookies. And totally agree if you want shiny don’t over mix. This recipe is fantastic

Best tip I ever got to make these is to make sure your sugar is fully dissolved before bringing to a boil. If you want to make this real simple just pour into cookie sheet and let cool then cut into squares. Perfect recipe!

Followed the recipe except I put the vanilla and peanut butter in the sauce pan. Once the peanut butter was running thin I poured it over the oats. Turned out perfect!!

These no bake cookies were made by my girl scout troop in the '70s. So good. All you need to know is that the "cooked" portion of the recipe is just a retro "minute frosting"  The "minute" is at a full rolling boil.  My mother always made a double batch of the frosting and, after frosting her cake,  stirred in peanut butter, oats and walnuts. What great memories.

I am 14 and I love cooking. We have a recipe very similar to this but they need to be frozen which doesn't work in our small freezer. This is amazing and is the perfect chocolatey soft mix. I use tinfoil for cooling I find it works better for taking cookies off smoothly. And my dad who does not like this kind of cookie likes them. He likes peanut butter and says he can really taste it.

My daughter is allergic to peanuts, so I used this recipe exactly as written, only substituting wowbutter for the peanut butter.  They turned out very tasty, though maybe a little runnier than they would be had I used peanut butter.  Cooled to a nice solid consistency though, so complaints here!

I loved these as a kids. It was one of the first things my Grandma made with me. It was the beginning of my love of cooking and baking.
I did vary the recipe. 
I used 4 cups of quick oats instead of 3..
I used 4 Tbls of  cocoa instead of 3.
I also used Dark cocoa because thats what we like.
This is the second time making these. The first were a little runny thats why I added a extra cup of oats. I wanted a more intense chocolate flavor so I used an extra tbls of cocoa.  These turned out delicious.

Recipe is fine. Cook sucks. They were crumbly because I forgot, of all things THE SUGAR and everything was boiling when I added it then it had to come back to a boil. Ugh! I honestly don't know why I'm suddenly trying to be a cook. lolol

I used to make these where I worked. I add the vanilla when the rolling boil starts. It will spit a little so don't have your face too close. After the 1 minute boil I take it off the heat & stir in the peanut butter til mostly melted then stir in oats in thirds. It's wonderful!!

Perfect! They come out exactly like they did when I was a kid. I kept trying as an adult and couldn't figure out why they were runny?  The trick is to let it get to a roaring boil and then time it 2 minutes. Also, I prefer half the vanilla.

My grandmother used to make these cookies when I was little, lost the recipe, was devastated! But these cookies are the closest thing to Nana's I could find! So good! What I want to try next time is maybe adding in coconut shavings, or even some kind of nut to the recipe:)

I ended up putting 1 1/2 cups of sugar as I thought 2 was overkill... Turns out they are still way, way to sweet. I'm not sure I want to serve them to others they are so intense. 
Even debated giving this a 1 star... Question of taste I guess. Nice texture though!

Wonderful! I had some friends with dietary restrictions so I made them with smooth skippy peanut butter, gluten free oats, and almond milk (same proportions). I also used a candy thermometer and got the mixture up to 215 degrees Fahrenheit. I want to eat the whole pan!!! Thank you so much!

Have made these cookies for years, family favorite!  I boil for 2 minutes and add 1/2 cup of coconut. To save time, you can press them into a jelly roll pan and cut them in squares after they've cooled. Yummy!

I halved the sugar and wish I hadn't. The flavor and texture were great though. I didn't have quicknoats so I pulsed regular ones in the food processor and added them to the boiling mixture half way through so they wouldn't be too tough. Thanks for the recipe.

These are a great version of the no-bake cookie. They *do* need quite some time to set up, though, so be patient!

Really, Lorna has said it all in her review! I have the same suggestions or considerations, such as bringing it to a rolling boil, then begin your one min timer. Cookies turned out great and they are a wonderful treat when you are looking for a tasty chocolate fix!

I love these "Cow plop cookies" (my Dad called them to make Mom made). This is the same recipe she used. As far as timing; I bring it to just starting to boil at a medium heat, then raise the temp and boil for 90 seconds. The texture comes out like fudge with oats in it...

Pretty good. To our tastes, it needed an extra 1TBS of cocoa. Don't forget the pinch of salt! I did this in the microwave this time. 2 min, stir, 2 min, then the oats & stuff. I used my cookie scoop and got 26.

I had a few friends over for a dinner party and one of the ladies is allergic to eggs.  I was looking for a quick desert that didn't require eggs and found this recipe.
I remember making these when I was a kid and liked them, so for me this was perfect.
I didn't think there was enough cocoa powder so I used an extra 1/2 T and it was just right.
I did what another reviewer suggested and timed my rapid boil for 2 min.  It was a mistake.  They tasted really good, but came out a little too crumbly.  They held their shape when I scooped them out and put them on waxed paper, but after cooling completely when you bit into them the texture was just a little too dry.
Next time I make these I will time my rapid boil for 1 min., as the recipe instructs.
I didn't think these were too sweet, they were just right, it balanced out the richness of the cocoa powder and the peanut butter.

Delicious & so easy!! I took these to a cookie exchange & they nicknamed them "crack cookies." Lol... I did follow some of the siggestions from the other reviews. I melt the peanut butter with everything else in the sauce pan. I also bring to a ROLLING boil & then set timer for 2 minutes stirring frequently. After I add quick oats I let it stand for 1 minute before dropping onto wax paper. Perfect texture & flavor for us. Thank you!! I will be making these again!

Great recipe because I like that it uses quick oats instead of regular old-fashioned oats because they have a softer consistency. The only problem was they are too sweet, and that's coming from someone who likes things very sweet...next time I will try to cut the sugar by a half cup at least.

Ok, seriously, AMAZING. I made this twice to take to take places when I was short on time, and they were DEVOURED and I had people asking for my recipe. Wow! They are delicious. I made them with shortening and they turned out fine.

This was a good start if you are willing to change and experiment a little. I used the other review suggestions of 
-1 1/2 cups sugar
-natural peanut butter
To specify the boiling... 
-1 minute is not long enough! I tried 1min 10 sec. The first day and they were very messy and gooey still. 
-The next day I boiled 1 min 40 sec., and it took the cookies 4-5 hours to finally set up 
-I WOULD SUGGEST TIMING YOUR BOILING FOR 2 MINUTES FROM THE ONSET OF BOILING POINT.

I haven't even ate a cookie yet, just tasted what's was left on the spoon and all I can day is that these are the best! So yummy! Very similar to porcupine cookies, without the coconut. I may be making these at Christmas time instead of porcupines!

This is a favorite in my community.  I live in Guatemala, and many people do not have ovens.  So every time I make these wonderful little morsels, I am besieged for a lesson to make them.  Normally I just make them following the recipe (except I always use butter, not margarine, or coconut oil), but we do love them with added cinnamon (we like it a lot, but you decide what you like) and/or coconut.  I normally just pour the hot cookies into a cake pan and cut when cool.  They stay softer longer, although they never seem to be around long enough to dry out.  They take no time to make and the ingredients are fairly common to find here.

Very good! I made the first batch exactly as written, when I made the second batch I ran out of white sugar so I used one cup white sugar and one cup brown sugar, and the second batch tasted better than the first, next time I'm going to use all brown sugar and see how it turns out.

Rolling boil for one whole minute is the best advice. Not just a few bubbles, an actual rolling boil for one whole minute. Extra chunky peanut butter is my advice if you like the texture of the peanuts in the no bake cookies. You could add coconut shreds if you'd like (we love). I had to use unsalted butter because that was all that I had. Add salt to mix to be boiled (it was just as great as the other times that I've made it with salted butter.)  all of the kids at school are asking for Trevor's mom's special recipe. I just found it here. Thank you so so much!  this is the best recipe!

I thought 3 cups of oats seemed a little much, but I stuck to the recipe and used 3 cups.  Next time I make these cookies, I will add only 2 cups of oats.  The cookies turned out very crumbly.  I'm talking fall apart in your hand crumbly.  But they were very yummy!!!

Started writing a review but accidentally submitted it before I actually got to reviewing the recipe... Oy. The inital recipe was pretty good, but I made a few adjustments which suited my tastes. I found them too sweet and a bit thin, so I cut the sugar by 1/2, added 1/2 cup chopped almonds, and added 1 cup of unsweetened shredded coconut, and added about 2 Tbsp more milk. really great!

This recipe is as old as the hills.  My mom had a large family to feed so she doubled the recipe.  4 c. sugar, 8TBS cocoa 2 sticks real butter, 1 c. milk, 2tsp. vanilla, 1c. peanut butter 6 c. oats.  I put mine in an 11 by 7 inch pan.  I don't think they're as crumbly that way.  They are sweet but who cares.  If you double it like I do, simply remove 1/2 c. of oats from smaller oat container and use the rest.

not bad at all if you're looking to make some cookies quick! I even used butter instead of margarine and unsweetened soymilk instead of cow's milk and they turned out great... melt in your mouth with just the right amount of sweetness! I'm also a fan of using pure maple syrup instead of vanilla extract and let the mixture boil for 2 minutes, just to make sure! not my favourite cookie, but was quick and easy to make without having the oven on during a hot summer's day :)

Really good! Only one cup of sugar is necessary.  I've also tried them with coconut oil instead of butter and they worked well. I had to increase boil time to 3 minutes to get it to stick together.

These are the best. I use to make them all the time when my children were young. I recently found the recipe again and decided to make them. They taste just as good now as they did then. I sometimes add raisins and/or nuts or other dried fruit. Sometimes I add coconut, basically whatever I feel like at the time. It's all good. It is important as others have mentioned that you wait until the mixture comes to a rolling boil before starting your timer. Thank you for reminding me of this great and easy cookie.

My kids love these and they are so easy to make. I make these cookies often and I've never had any issues with them setting up. I start the timer when the mixture in the pot bubbles and boils big,  fluffy, and foamy , aka a rolling boil. The vanilla is added last so the heat won't evaporate it.

I substitute the butter with butter-flavored Crisco+1 TBS water, and I add 1/8 tsp. cream of tartar. The Crisco keeps them from crumbling, and the CoT keeps the sugar from forming crystals.

Super easy.  I followed a lot of other suggestions and cooked it for a good 2 minutes.  I used a scoop to scoop out on to parchment.  I think I may reduce sugar by a half of cup based on other suggestions.  They were a bit sweet.  But delicious and addictive.  I gave most of them away!!

I use to make these  for my children when they were little, and I lost the recipe. I was thrilled to see it again. I now make them for my grandchildren. I add lots of different ingredients at different times depending on my mood. Great with a small amount of crumbled popcorn, or some home dried raisins for a different twist.

Very easy and tasty. I add a bit more peanut butter and boil for 3 minutes instead of 1. I also spread in a 9 by 13 pan and cut into bars instead of making drop cookies.

Love these cookies.  A trick I have learned over the years of making them is add a little more oats, also if you boil the mixture too long the cookie will be dry and if you don't boil long enough it will be too soft and won't form into a cookie.  I also only used a 1 3/4 cups of sugar.

I liked these cookies because they were easy to make with my 2 year old. However, they were WAY too sweet. I would make them again with half the sugar.  Also, they're a little crumbly so I would also use honey instead of sugar to see if they hold together better.

After reading other reviews, I allowed the mixture to come to a roiling boil for 1 minute. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. It came out soft and runny. Great taste, icky texture.

I tried cutting the recipe in half, there wasn't enough of the cocoa mixture, to cover the oats. So when it came time to form the cookies it was like a crumbly chocolate like granola, and I was not impressed with the taste.

03-03-16 ~ It took me two batches to get this correct.   The instructions just say to cook  'rapid boil for 1 minute.'  The first batch I did that over high heat.  They were very dry and wouldn't hold  a shape.  Tonight I made a second batch at a temp of just a little over medium, and boiled for 90 seconds and I'm pleased to say they worked perfectly.  Made these to take to Tennessee for our son.

These tasted great. They weren't as smooth and creamy as I would have liked but I followed the advice of others and started my one  minute timer once the mixture came to a rolling boil. They seemed a tad overcooked, a smidge on the dry side. No bakes are a tricky cookie to make - a little overcooked can make a dry cookie. I also used butter instead of margarine (I never buy margarine) and it worked great.  I used my large cookie scoop (#24) and it made 18 perfect size cookies. Work fast though, the "batter" got stiff the longer it stayed in the pan.

Made this almost exactly as written, replacing margarine with butter. Perfect. Wouldn't change anything else about it.

Great cookie! Very easy and quick! The whole family loved it. Just make sure to boil long enough before taking off the heat or the cookie won't set right.

It is my first time to try a no-bake cookies but they were so delicious, the only thing I added was few chunks of dark chocolate, and it was yummy
Thank you for the recipe :)

I have made them, but never with the peanut butter, now I will try that, I also agree with the comments about cutting the sugar, in fact I have doubled everything except the sugar and they still loved them, don't need that much sugar.

I rated this recipe 4 stars for taste. It might have been a five star recipe but II made the mistake of reading the reviews for this recipe before making it. I noticed how some people were saying 1 minute of boiling time was not enough and some people saying that they boiled up to 3 1/2 minutes. I figured i would go in between. I boiled for exactly 2 minutes. Unfortunately that was to long. While they taste wonderful, They are dry and crumbly. I wasn't even able to get half of the pot out before the mixture stopped sticking together. So I am left to figure out what to do with half a pot of crumbles :( Lesson learned, next time I will follow the original recipe the first time.

Well, I always make personal changes. I'm not a big sugar fan so I backed that off to 1 cup. Instead of plain cocoa I use the Hershey's Dark cocoa. They turned out really good. If they lasted that long I would know whether they set up or not!

These are very yummy!  However I am not sure what happened to some of mine that they did not hardened together.  I thought I moved as quickly as possible.  So some of mine are just crumbles.  I did have the mixture come to a rolling boil for 3 mins as others suggested.  Would make again!

I have made a few different no bake recipes, all of which have pretty much the same ingredients at different quantity. I find this one to be just about right for me. The only change I made was margarine to butter. I have tried both and there is a difference in taste and texture. 
I do want to share a tip that took me some time to figure out. Almost all of the recipes that I have seen tell you to boil for a set time, usually between 1 and 2 minutes. I could never get the texture I wanted until I finally googled the trick/science behind the perfect no bake cookie. The key to texture is in the boiling. You have to get it to the soft ball stage on a candy thermometer. It actually took me almost 3 minutes to achieve this temp. And after about the two minute mark I was getting a little nervous but stuck to my guns and let it reach the required temp. 
I am so glad that I did. My cookies turn out perfect every single time now. I actually don't even use the thermometer anymore. I've timed it a few times and now know that it takes about 3 minutes for me. Now maybe I am cooking at a lower temp or something but 3 minutes is what it takes at medium heat on my stove. Of course the time will differ with everybody depending on many variables im sure. 
Anyone having texture issues should try this method. Also, one chef suggested not stirring once it starts to boil. I also follow that rule. As soon as it reaches temp I take off of heat and I immediately stir in vanilla and peanut butter. Make

Will make again. Used 7-8 tablespoons of cocoa for a double batch since I was at the end of my container. A little extra chocolate never hurts anybody, right? Cut the sugar to 1&1/2 cups (3 for double batch) based on recommendations from others. And oh, darn. Had an extra container of half & half in my fridge. Used that for the milk. Rolling boil for 2 minutes. Delicious!

I always add a little more peanut butter than called for and maybe a little more cocoa, but that's me and I have never had a bad batch,  Again wait until the FULL ROLLING boil starts before timing,   -  but then again you cant really make them taste bad if you measure out everything.  I have eaten many a batch with A SPOON  - not mine but I never turn them down-

Made these as is and they're great! I felt it was just a bit too heavy on the oats. I'll add about a half-cup less next time and see how that goes. I know many people have noted that their cookies didn't "set" and that the timing is vital; here's what I did: I waited until the boiling ingredients swelled before adding the rest of the recipe (you'll know what "swelled" means if you wait for it). It worked. Cookies came out perfectly. Just very oat-y. Boyfriend didn't care for the peanut butter, as a matter of taste. He still ate 'em, though. 4.5 stars, will definitely make again. Thank you!

These turned out like a liquid even after I let them set I even put them in the freezer to try and harden them. I don't know how you can make the dough more dense.

I reduced the sugar to 1 1/3 and boiled the initial mix for 3 mins. Didn't have quick oats to used regular and they are a bit bit firm but still edible! 4 out of 5 of us like them although we'd pick chocolate chip cookies over these...

Very good. I followed the recipe exactly, and they turned out wonderfully. Make sure to let the mixture boil rapidly before starting the one-minute timer.

I made these again tonight for about the hundreth time, at least that's what it feels like. Everyone loves these cookies and I get requests for them over and over.  I always start my 1 minute timing AFTER the mixture reaches a full, rolling boil.  I make the entire recipe in one saucepan on the stove - love the easy cleanup!!  Two things I've learned - you can sub butter for the margarine and half-n-half for the milk (which I did tonight in a pinch); and the longer you stir the mixture after you add the oatmeal, the uglier they become.  Stir JUST UNTIL mixed and they will retain a lovely gloss. I've tried other recipes and this is my favorite!

I know these are very highly rated and I think the concept is good, but they were way too sweet (and for my family, that's a pretty strong statement). I don't think I will make them again, although I do wonder if the recipe could be tweaked to have more peanut butter and less sugar. One helpful tip... I put my oats in the food processor and gave it a few pulses, them added the peanut butter, vanilla, and chocolate mix. Then, another few pulses and it was ready for the cookie scoop. Made it much less messy.

Perfect  no bake cookie, yes it is sweet, more like a candy.   Start the timing when the mixture starts boiling hard....I usually go for 1.5 mins.... Take it off he heat and then add the peanut butter.....vanilla and oatmeal.  I have always loved these cookies from childhood.

I did what others suggested and reduced sugar to 1 1/2 cups and boiled for 2.5 minutes at a rolling ball. I coated a medium sized ice cream scoop with non stick spray and used that to form the cookies and they look great! TIP: You have to keep stirring this or it can burn.
This was my first try at these and they came out great.
Thanks for the easy recipe.

Both times I have tried it, it turned out great! I will definitely make this again! The only tweek I made was the vanilla. I added just a little more than 1 tablespoon. They did longer than a little bit to firm though. Overall this is a very good cookie recipe!

Just like my grandmother used to make!  I tried to turn them into nests for Easter (and put 3 Peanut M&Ms in the middle of each one), and it was kind of a pain.  They cooled too quickly for me to get them all scooped out of the pan, forget adding the M&Ms early enough for them to stick.  But they were still cute and delicious!

I agree that these cookies are way too mushy with the recipe as written. The favor was really good but the consistency was not good at all. I would either boil longer or try another recipe.

Amazing!! I make these when we have people over, and everyone loves them! The mixture is good cold or straight out of the pan! Probably the best no bake cookies out there.

They turned out great! Seems like every time I make no bakes they don't harden, but this recipe finally worked. Perfect cookies that taste great!

These turned out shiny, yummy, gooey and not hard. The only adjustment I made was boiling for 1 1/2 minutes versus the 1 minute.

I altered them due to a PEANUT ALLERGY. My whole family loves these cookies. They are fast and easy.  I eliminated the peanut butter and added a cup of coconut.  I only used 1 3/4 cup of sugar, added the cocoa to the oatmeal mixture instead of boiling it, and YES - once it gets to a hard boil, set your timer for two minutes.

This recipe has been a family favorite since I can remember. We LOVE these cookies. I don't add any salt but definitely do bring to a rolling boil for at least 1 minute (I do 1 minute 30 seconds) so the cookies will set. I like to pop the batter into silicone cup cake holders for easier transport and consumption.

I lost my Mom's "Bakeless Cookie" recipe some time ago and have tried a variety of replacements, but this is it!! I followed it exactly for the first try and I won't change a thing! Non-glossy, smooth, non-chalky, melt-in-your-mouth consistency with excellent flavor. My Mom's recipe said to bring to a roaring boil and then start timing for "1 minute, 15 seconds" :) I started counting at the "roaring boil" point for 1 minute and these were perfect!

I just made these and used special dark coco instead of regular. Decreased the amount a little. Our humidity is very high today (96% not raining) and I boiled them for almost 2 minutes and they turned out yummo!

I followed this recipe 100% & they are Delicious!  My step son said they were "the best cookies he ever had", which is huge considering his grandma's famous for hers. To speed up the firmness, I put these in the fridge for a little bit. This recipe makes about 2 doz.

First off let me start off by saying that I have never made "no-bake" cookies. This recipe was very quick and easy. I will definitely be making this again. The recipe is perfect as is. I made no substitutions. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Perfect no bake cookie! I use regular rolled oats and boil for 5-6 minutes.  The cookies always turn out excellent with just the right texture and delicious flavor.

My son-in-law was craving these cookies and I had not made them in a long time. The recipe was quick and easy to follow. It will take a little practice to get them perfect, but my son-in-law said he would gladly help since he would get to eat them, perfect or not

I just made a batch of these bad boys and OMG!!!! They are even more fabulous than I remember. My cousin used to make them during Christmas season and I always think about them. I did use butter in lieu of margarine because I dislike margarine and I also used natural peanut butter that contains no sugar. I feel that this type of peanut butter prevents these cookies from being over the top "give you diabetes" cookies. Too sweet = too much. Anyway, they are Delish!

I gave this recipe five stars because it is the first recipe that I used and actually had the cookies harden like they should, and quickly! I have used about four or five other recipes in my lifetime. If I have the same success next time, I will definitely use this recipe from now on! Why change a good thing? (I followed the recipe exactly.)

This is the best recipe for No Bake Cookies.  Perfect consistency...not too gooey, and not too brittle.  Only thing I do differently is use real butter, but I'm not sure it makes that big of difference.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I tried this instead of using my old tried and true recipe.  After reading reviews to follow recipe exactly.  I did.  The cookies came out a soupy mess.  Scooped them up into a bowl and had to eat with a spoon.  Will not use this recipe EVER again.  You need to boil the mixture at least five minutes.

Good for those hot days when you don't want to turn on the oven, but these cookies don't disappear the way traditional cookies do.

Start timing after rolling boil, let it go for 2 minutes. I would also reduce sugar qty to 1 1/2 C. I added in ground flax & coconut shavings to give it a healthy zing!

I am so glad this recipe was posted.  My mom used to make these cookies but when I've tried the results have been hit and miss. Sometimes they wouldn't harden and I never knew why. Know I know that the secret lies in boiling the mixture just enough.  Can't wait to try it out again with my new found knowledge! This is why I LOVE these reviews!!

I loved these cookies!  I took several reviewer's suggestions and made a few changes; only 1 1/2 c. sugar, butter instead of margarine and allowed to boil for approx. 2-3 min.  They were perfect!  Great taste and easy to prepare.  I plan to make these over and over again.

We call these "Raggedy Robins" and I learned to make them many years ago in my 7th grade Home Economics class.  I still make them today for my family and hope to pass this recipe on to my grandchildren!  They come out great every time and are so easy to make.  I always use butter because it just makes them taste much better!

Excellent recipe.  Take the guess work out of your boiling time.  Use a candy thermometer.  Shoot for 230 degrees.  Perfect every time.

It was quick, easy, and delicious, but a little too much sugar and the peanut butter taste was a little strong for me. Otherwise, this is the perfect cookie to make within 30 minutes.

Quick, easy and Mmmm. Learned this recipe when I was a Brownie in a Girl Scout Troop.  I've been making it for over 50 years now!  My kids learned how to make it and now my nieces make it all the time at their friends request.

Made this with dark chocolate cocoa and it was awesome. Boiling for 1 minute worked fine for me, but I didn't start timing until it was boiling HARD. As in, it was boiling hard enough that it started "growing."

The first time I made these I used all natural peanut butter NOT kept in the fridge (which can be pretty liquidy), and subbed 1 cup of honey for all the sugar. They pretty runny even though I added 1 extra cup of oats, but after putting them in the freezer for 30min and then storing them in the fridge, they set fine. This time I made the recipe for 36 instead of 24, still subbing the half portion of honey but using regular peanut butter and no extra oats, and they got much thicker much quicker! I had to race to get them spooned out before they got so dry they wouldn't stick together! But the best thing was that I used my MUFFIN PANS and smushed a large spoonful down into each cup (no liners or oil or anything), stuck them in the freezer again (30min), and when I took them out I could pry out each perfectly shaped cookie with a butter knife and they didn't crumble or break! I will use less peanut butter next time (or go back to the thinner, natural kind), but I just love these cookies! I'm going to try using olive oil instead of butter and almond milk instead of regular one time, and then they will be GF AND DF (not that I care but other people do haha).

Dangerously good. So sweet, so chocolatey, so peanut buttery. I made these just like the recipe says, and they turned out great. I didn't have any waxed paper, so I lined my cookie sheets with plastic wrap and lightly sprayed them with non-stick spray. They're cooling in the fridge right now :)I plan to make these again and I will try, as someone has commented, to make them with 2 T butter and 1 c. sugar.

These cookies were so fast and easy! I always have trouble with no bake cookies and these ones turned out well. They do harden extremely fast and they aren't exactly cookie-shaped, but they taste amazing! I didn't have a whole 1/2 cup of p-nut butter and I almost burnt the coco mixture trying to add the other ingredients, but I think these cookies are definitely worth the effort. If you're looking for fast snack to share with your kids, then these are perfect, I just wouldn't recommend them for a party or anything. Thanks for the recipe, Robin!

Very easy! Very yummy! They came out perfect! I added a little extra cocoa and another 1/2 cup of peanut butter. They went fast, next time I'll double the recipe!

In an old Jif cookbook, these are called "Chattahoochee Crunchies".  They are fast, easy, and something you just can't resist, especially while they're still warm and gooey.  YUM!

Classic recipe made from stuff we always have on hand. So If i feel I'm in need of chocolate...or fiber, I can whip these up in no time. Amazing results every time. If you don't know why they are setting up, never fret, just put it all into a big bowl and use a spoon, they are amazing however you eat them lol

Back home people used to make these no back cookies for just about everything, here at college it was like no one had ever heard of them.... I was trying to find a recipe that made them turn out the way I remember them because it seems that everyone always had a slightly different take on how to make them.... I followed the ingredients in this recipe except used butter for margarine.... I took the advice of the other reviewers and boiled the mixture for two minutes instead of one... then I stirred in the peanut butter and vanilla until well mixed and finally the oatmeal.... mine seemed to turn out good, they held together great but a little on the drier side... this is such a quick and easy recipe though... that even if they don't turn out perfect everytime they are still AWESOME!!

I have been making no bake cookies for probably 50 years.  The recipe I have always used is in the Betty Crocker cookbook that I grew up with.  Sometimes I will add coconut to mine.  I agree with others that you don't start timing until it comes to a rolling boil.  Love, Love these cookies

I also boiled too long, so they were a little dry.  I also used splenda to try and cut the calories.  I will use sugar next time!  
And bandwife, these aren't supposed to be crispy, so they may have turned out exactly the way they were supposed to.  When done right, they are yummy and I think the ingredients are perfect.

I must give a tip this recipe is perfect the way it is, if you boil any longer it will make dry hard cookies, they should not be dry & hard and the secret is in the boil time.....

SO SIMPLE!!!  I did what everyone recommended.  I waited for the 1st step to come to a rolling boil, and then started timing for 1 min.  Then I moved directly into the next steps.  I used skim milk and butter, because they were what I had on hand.  I scooped them out with the ice cream scoop, so they all looked the same.  They turned out beautifully!!

I followed the recipe, but I must of done something wrong because my mixture was just a dry mess after about 10 cookies. I worked quickly but the cookie mixture wouldn't stick together. I used creamy peanut butter because the recipe didn't say creamy or crunchy. Was that what went wrong? If anyone can help me with this, I'd appreciate it.

These were great! and fast! I changed it just a little. I only used 1 1/2 c sugar and 1/3 c peanut butter and 2 tsp vanilla. Left everything else the same. I did boil for 3 minutes and you do have to move a little quickly when dropping on sheets, but had no problem with them setting up. Again the fastest cookies I've ever made! 20 minutes from start to finish and everyone commented on how yummy they were!

These pretty good. They came out a lot sweeter than I'm used to though and had more of a sugary taste than a chocolate/peanut butter taste. I will still make them again, but maybe use less sugar next time.

Really great flavor, but I found it impossibly difficult to actually form these into cookies.  I ended up just putting all the "batter" into an 8 x 8 glass dish and then we ate it with a fork.  It would be great in crumbles for an ice cream topping.

These cookies did not come out for me. I followed the recipe. But we couldn't even pick them up.Tthey didn't set up right. I also thought they were a bit gritty. Maybe I didn't do something right.

These come out more like fudge than cookies.  Also, they were WAY too sweet for my husband and I.  If I were to ever make these again, and I won't, I would use a lot less sugar!

My mother made these. Only thing I do differently to all no bake cookies is boil for 1 1/2 mimutes.  I've never had a problem.They are also good if you leave out the coco. Mades a nice peanut butter treat.

I was pretty excited to try out the procedure suggested by "sweetthing" pertaining to high humidity...but am sorry to say the cookies came out dry and crumbly. Not only do I live in Florida, but it's also raining out today so I'm sure the humidity percentage is extremely high. Guess I better stick to more tropical-friendly recipes. I'm rating this recipe high since it brings back wonderful memories of my grandma when I was a young girl living up in Massachusetts, and this recipes is exactly the same.

I've always loved these since I was a kid and even now I eat way too many of them.  :-)  Here in the south with the high humidity I boil it a little longer and add additional oats to ensure they harden in the summer time.  Love this recipe and these cookies!

These came out excellent. My family can't stop eating them! I followed the recipe exactly, but I spooned them onto a large silicone mat instead of wax paper. I did make sure to boil the mixture hard for one minute, and they set up perfectly. The best part is that they're somewhat more nutritious than most cookies, and they're gluten-free.

HELP ME!!! We can't stop eating these cookies lol! I used to buy this type of cookie at our local Supercenter and decided to look up the recipe. These are soooo easy to make and taste even better than the store bought cookies. My husband and kid's went nuts over these cookies (ok...I did too, lol). Thank you for this yummy recipe!

The taste was the same as I remember, but these didn't firm up at all - I even used real Vanilla as one poster suggested.  They are sticky and just a step away from gooey - 18 hours later in the fridge

My mom made these years ago, and now I have made them for years.  The whole family loves them.  In terms of the ingredients, the only change is to increase the peanut butter to 1 full cup.  I start timing them just as they reach a full boil and they always set up just right, no refrigeration necessary.  Not that they really need to set in my family.  After they get plopped out on wax paper or foil, we scoop up the warm, gooey yummy stuff into bowls and eat with a spoon.  Delicious stuff!  Be sure to have plenty of cold milk on hand.  :)

I have made these over and over growing up. They are delicious. I use butter or margarine and don't add the salt. It's not needed. A great cookie for kids to learn how to make.

Very good, I ran out of vanilla so I didn't use it..seemed fine without it :) I also added the oats after the roiling boil stirred them in then I added the peanut butter, giving the oats a chance to cook, turned out great.

Perfect.My first batch I accidently used regular oats.My second batch I used quick oats.Both came out equally good.The first batch was darker but I believe the oats were the reason why.All in all the taste was the same and they set up great with one full minute at a full boil.Thesecookies are always a hit!They are just like the ones they sold in the school cafeteria many years ago!

Not a huge fan of these cookies, but it could just be my preference. I felt that they were a bit grainy. I might try them again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

I made this today exactly as written. 
Only difference - boilded for 1 1/2 minutes instead of 1 as suggested. Had oats, pb, and vanilla in bowl all ready for mixture. They came out awesome with lots of shine. Set up quickly as well. I made my about 1 1/2 inches and I got approx. 30 cookies. Keeper!

Yummy!  I used brown sugar instead of white and omitted the cocoa powder.  Instead, I lined a muffin tin with cupcake papers, dropped just enough mini chocolate chips in the bottom to cover, patted the warm mix in, then sprinkled a few more mini chips on top.  Refrigerated for awhile just to set the chocolate, then brought back up to room temp.

These turned out so much better than I thought they would.  I didn't have quick cooking oats so I used the regular old fashioned instead and they turned out great.  Nice and chewy.  The only thing I would do differently next time would be to reduce the amount a peanut butter because it overpowered the chocolate slightly.  Great recipe.  Super quick too!

I don't think I let mine boil long enough. Also I used soy milk to since i'm allergic to diary. it's a little soft/gooey but it's super delicious and i will definitely make this one again!!!!

This was so easy and so delicious. I would definately stick to the suggestion of boiling AT LEAST 2 minutes though.

I thought these were great.  I did follow the suggestion of getting the first 5 ingredients to a rolling boil, then time for 1 minute.  Remove from heat, add vanilla and PB and melt that.  Then add the oats. Perfect choc/pb flavor and consistancy.

Be sure that you do not cook the mixture longer than 90 sec. or you will have a crumbled mess.

Fantastic. Made these in less than 10 minutes. I can't stop eating the wet mixture. Soooo good. Only made 8 servings and it made exactly eight cookies using a rounded tablespoon, thanks for the recipe!

If you love chocolate, oatmeal, and peanut butter you will love these. And the best part is you don't have to spend your time baking. You just set them on the wax paper and let them cool.

Followed the recipe and timing exactly. I have had these cookies in the refrigerator for 15 hours and they are still so gooey I can't even peel them off the wax paper. I made these with the intention of sending them with someone on a trip, as I do not like them myself. I am now stuck with a bunch of gooey lumps.

I have made these hundreds of times over the years and they turn out EVERY time. I usually make a double batch and they are gone in less than a day! Really follow the recipe when it comes to boiling the chocolate mixture, that is the secret. I also use crunchy peanut butter every time.

I thought these were just ok. The peanut butter flavor was stronger than what I typically think of for No Bake cookies and the chocolate flavor wasn't strong enough.

I agree with other raters--the 1 minute boiling time is not enough to harden the cookies.  I waited almost 30 minutes and my cookies didn't harden.  Next time I will boil 2 minutes and see if that helps.

I love this recipe.  For those of you who are turned off by the amount of butter and sugar, I cut the butter by about a third or fourth (I didn't have much left in my frig but had already started cooking, so I went for it!) and cut the sugar in HALF, sprinkled about 1/2 cup of milk chocolates at the end because I only had dark unsweetened cocoa powder on hand, and they still taste WONDERFUL.  Yummy.

totally awesome recipe. I've made dozen of batches over the year using a different recipe and this one blows it away. It is incredibly sweet and fudgy. I might try to cut back on the sugar next time. I just made a half a batch (wishing i would have made a full one) I let the mixture "rapid" boiling for about 2 minutes.

Probably my favorite cookie recipe with a little modification.  1 cup of sugar is plenty, boil for 2 minutes instead of 1, butter instead of margarine (for health).

HOLY MOLY!  These babies are great.  Mommy, Daddy, and Kids approved.  I followed the advice of another rater and let the ingredients "rapid boil" for one whole minute.  Put them in the fridge for 25 minutes for a rapid cool down and PERFECTION!  Have the milk ready for these!!!

We've been making no-bake cookies for years and many of the reviewers are right about waiting for a FULL roiling boil before starting the timer, though we're in the military and we move around a lot, so we've found that if you live in a humid climate, you have to boil the cookies for longer and in dry climates, you don't.  One minute works fine in dry climates and much more humid climates require up to a minute and a half.  If you're trying these for the first time, make a guess on the time (1 min for desert, 1:30 for the tropics, gauge if you're somewhere in between!)  I would recommend cooking it a few seconds longer than you think you need to, I'd rather have slightly crumbly cookies than ones that don't set up!  Good luck!

When I mixed everything together it looked like soup. I added another cup of oats and we were in business. I always keep my in the fridge for those that had hardening issues.

Just the choc/pb fix I've been craving!  I encountered one issue that turned out to be a wash.  I made these on a very humid day, so they didn't set very well.  All I did was pop them in the fridge and keep them there.  Given how hot it's been, cold cookies are better than room temperature!  So the minus was that they didn't set, but the plus was that my solution was also a good way to beat the heat.  So overall it's a wash and I still love these cookies!

Awesome! I use Nestle Tollhouse Baking Cocoa, and doubled it because I LOVE chocolate!  I've been making these almost once a week for my husband since I found the recipe, and I find that when I'm more liberal in measuring out the peanut butter they get too chewy and won't harden.  Now I always use a little less and it works every time!

I remembered these as a kid and after a chat about our childhood favorites, a coworker gave me a no-bake recipe from one of those 'recipe of the day' email lists.  I made them several years ago, but couldn't figure out why the texture was so soft when the ones we made as kids were nice and firm, almost fudge-like.  I had a hankering, pulled out the recipe, and made a batch last night.  After spending overnight in the fridge and the morning in the freezer, I was getting nowhere on the soft texture, so I came here to find a new recipe.  Instead I found the exact same recipe I'd just made with the missing "ingredient:"  boiling time.  Thanks for providing the fix that I needed (in more ways than one! ;)

These cookies were EXCELLENT and very fast to make.  My proportions must have been little big since I only got seventeen cookies but it was still more than enough.  The only thing I did differently was I used crunchy peanut butter and omitted the salt [by accident . . .].  Will definitely be making these again!

Recipe turned out just as expected.  I used organic peanut butter and I was worried that they wouldn't turn out because of the texture of the PB, but they seem fine.  I think I waited until the mixture was at a full boil before I started timing - but I'm not sure.  Will probably try exchanging Nutella for the peanut butter next time.

Couldn't be easier and super yum!  I did follow the recipe as stated, but did let the peanut butter melt into the mixture before adding the cookies.  I also made sure to let the mixture boil a full minute AFTER it was a ROLLING boil, not just bubbling.  ENJOY!!!

Very yummy.  I didn't have enough unsweetened cocoa powder but I had unsweetened cocoa chocolate bars.  So I used one and half of those to equal the amount.  Just melted them for a few seconds in the microwave to get them soft then popped them in the pot and they melted perfectly.  The cookies taste perfect.  Still having issues with the boiling and crumbly cookies, but that was my issue I'm sure.  I will be using this one again.

These cookies are fantastic!! When I was a kid I loved to eat these with a spoon right out of the pan.Just be sure and not overboil them or they will turn out dry and crumbly.I can't make these very often because they are so good I can't quit eating them!

These turned out perfectly! All 24 were gone in 4 hours. I did let it come to a full rolling boil for 2-3 minutes because I noticed my sugar was not fully cooked down. Love these cookies and making them again right now.

These turned out so GOOD! I made a few changes: 1.5 cups sugar instead of 2 and a bit more cocoa and peanut butter than required. I also followed another reader's tip of timing it a minute from the rolling boil. The result was perfectly chewy (not crumbly or runny) cookies that were an instant hit. Also I loved that they barely took 5 minutes to make. Thank you so much for sharing this fantastic recipe!!

I made these using Sunbutter from Whole Foods instead of PB because of a peanut allergy in my family. I also used Rapadura Whole Sugar instead of white sugar and used a little less sugar than it called for and threw in a little Stevia to make up the difference. And the final thing I did different was to used rolled oats instead of the quick cooking kind. The recipe turned out great and the cookies only lasted about a day!

I have been making these cookies for years using different recipes. I decided to try this one. It is the BEST I have ever tried the cookies have a shiny look to them and the taste is much better

I did not care for the flavor of these but my kids thought they were ok.  The only change I made was using Splenda instead of sugar & boiling it for two minutes instead of one.

I was really disappointed in this recipe!  My nephew is in the army and I wanted to send these cookies to him for Christmas because they are his favorite.  After I made these and tasted them I made another batch and changed it quite a bit... First, since I had already used all of my peanut butter in the first batch, I substituted Nutella (hazelnut spread) in the next batch.  I also added 1 1/2 cup coconut and 1/2 cut chopped pecans.  With those changes they were AWESOME!!! I also received a medal from my nephew.

They were perfect!  I did take the first reviewer's advice and let it boil a full minute after it came to a rolling boil.

I just finished making two batches of these. The first batch I did 2 minutes at a rolling boil, but they were hardly salvagable as cookies- taste great, but were so so crumblt it was hard to form them. I tried the second batch timing one minute from a very rapid boil and I didn't add a whole 3 cups of oats, just a little less. I also used butter instead of margerine on both. The second batch turned out great! Thanks

Awesome recipe, delicious and easy.  I followed some people suggestion and upped the boiling time to 2-3 minutes.  They turned out perfect, even with non-fat milk, smart-balance butter and low-fat peanut butter.  No one would ever know!

These are incredible!  I changed servings to 36  (which actually made 50 cookies) to accommodate daughter's choir party. I also added the peanut butter before boiling and boiled 2 minutes--SMOOOOTH!!!  I've had grainy ones before (not enough cook time=undissolved sugar). Also, didn't have to work terribly quickly at dropping onto baking sheet, in fact, took about 15 minutes to get all cookies on sheet, and the further I got along, the cooler the batter was and actually held itself up rather than spreading as the earlier, hotter batter did. Thanks, Robin, for a fantastic recipe, and to all other reviews!

Fantastic Recipe. This is just like my mom's I did the directions excactly the way they are written and it came out perfect!! A reminder to anyone who has not done these cookies before timming is everything. Put your burner on 6 Med-Med high heat. Let everything melt while stirring. Wait for it to come to a COMPLETE rapid boil once you are there then set your timer not before 1 minute is just enough time if you wait for the rapid boil.   Thank you so much for sharing this recipe now I can stop asking my mom for it :-)

YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM! These cookies are decadent and delicious! So easy and quick to make and SO good! I followed other reviewer's suggestions and used just under 2 cups sugar but they were still very sweet so next time I will go 1.5 cups! I also brought to a rolling boil and boiled 2 minutes and the cookies still came out soft so maybe even 2.5- minutes will be better next time. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made these yesterday and they were fantastic! Super easy  and you cannot mess it up. I boiled for 1 minute. The time really doesn't make a difference, I don't think. just make sure it's a rolling boil!

Sorry! I followed the recipe and mine were dry and kind of crumbly : ) I was really looking for a new recipe that makes the kind of no-bakes that spread out some on the wax paper and not stayed in a ball or lump. I'll keep looking! Thanks anyway!

Soft - not runny, Chewey and delicious!  I added the cocoa when I put in the oatmeal, used natural peanut butter and unsalted butter.  My family recipe for no-bakes  had 1 cup of coconut stirred in with the oatmeal and NO peanut butter. In the end - it's ALL GOOD

These taste good...but I've made them twice now.  My son is allergic to milk so I used soy milk the first time and they didn't firm up.  I used rice milk today and they still didn't firm up.  It could be the dairy free margarine I used too.  It's the same type I always bake with.  Who knows!  Tasted good, way gooey.

Easy is right.  Almost TOO easy, because these are a fast way to satisfy those cravings for chocolate that would probably be best not satisfied.  I remembered these from my childhood, and was happy to find a recipe that scales down perfectly.  Soooo good!

NOM NOM NOM! These were so tasty!  I had to improvise a little because the peanut butter here in Chile is SOO expensive!  So I used something called "manjar" instead which is like this carmel sweet milk paste.  They were No Bake Cookies Chilean style!  My boyfriend and I ate them all in one night.  Que gordos!

These were fine.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and I had no issues with the timing of it.  I followed the advice of making sure it comes to a rapid boil before you start timing.  Consistency was great, but I was maybe expecting more on taste/texture.  Never thought I would say this, but almost too much chocolate...I will try again, but will maybe add more oats.  Thanks for the recipe.

I've tried other no bake cookies from this site, they are great!  But I have been looking for one that mimics the flavor of ones I had in childhood... and voila!  I finally found them!  Thanks for the recipe, now I can have that nostalgia from childhood when I eat these.

This type of cookie is my husband's absolute favorite. I had lost my recipe, and found this one. I gave it only 4 stars because I had to increase the cocoa to 5 tablespoons, annd the cooking time to 3 minutes. Once that was done, they were perfect!

Tasted good but didn't ever fully harden. I prefer my no bakes to be a little harder so they are easier to transport and eat.

The best recipe so far for these!  I have tried loads as I love them and remind me so much of my childhood... This one is good, I threw in a little more peanut butter but that is because I am a PB addict!  yum yum yum my boyfriend and I ate them all in one day!

I couldn't get over the texture and the sweetness of these cookies. I love the concept, but I love the crunchy baked feeling of regualr cookies. I think it is the uncooked oats that kills the texture for me. These also came out overly sweet, even for a pregnant sweet tooth it was too much. They were however easy to make with common household ingredients so there was no need to run to the store!

A great cookie - I entered it at our county fair and won 2nd place.  My son thought he should have been allowed to taste the 1st place entry - because he said "there is no way their cookies were better than yours".  I must admit they were great.  I also made a batch and left the cocoa out - these weren't entered at the fair, but I had trouble keeping my mom out of them.  I do agree that you need to come to a full boil and then boil for one minute.

A good cookie that my kids & hubby liked and I timed it for 2 minutes once it came to a rapid boil.  Took 1.5 hrs. to solidify.  Cut back sugar to 1.75 cups, but would cut it back more to 1.5 next time.  Great recipe for the kids to learn to make.

The remedy for a sweet-tooth emergency. I think the 15 prep time is even a stretch;it took me maybe that long from prep to eating. I did try another member's microwave version and they came out a scorched, powdery mess. The "longer" stove-top version is nearly fool proof.

Turned out great!  Just like classic no-bake cookies should be.  I made mine extra rich because I was out of milk and had some cream left over from another recipe.  Wonderful!

I cut the recipe in half which still made plenty of half dollar size cookies for my family of three. I brought to a boil and then timed for 1 minute, should have been a full 2 maybe 2 1/2 minutes as they are very sticky. They have to remain in the fridge. The taste of these is spot on though, just like my mom used to make for me!

I give this recipe 4 stars b/c the cookies were very tasty, but the consistency was far too soft. We had to eat them with a spoon. I followed the recipe except I used only 1 1/2c sugar as recommended by many reviewers. I followed the detailed instruction given by a "most helpful" reviewer to allow the mixture to come to a rapid boil and then time it for one minute, but this was not long enough. I will try boiling for 2 minutes next time.

we have used this recipe for years in my family, except we never used salt, and I always found that putting them in the fridge always helped them turn out better, and that way they end up shiny no matter how much you stir it. And i know this is labeled cookies, but at my house we almost always just pour the stuff into bowls and eat it that way. If we dont finish then we cover it with aluminum foil and stick it in the fridge.

I made these tonight for a church function.  They were all gone.  I never got to try one.  But my husband said this recipe is a keeper.

I made this today for the 2nd time and made the following changes because it wasn't chocolaty enough last time: 1/4 c plus 1 TBS of cocoa powder.  Otherwise I followed exactly and they are awesome! Just like my mom's (I keep losing her recipe!)Thanks for the recipe! They didn't get hard and crumbly, just smooth and glossy and yummy! :-)

These cookies were so easy to make. I made no changes to the recipe except boil for 3 minutes instead of one. I do have to admit that next time I make these I'll try boiling for 2 minutes. They were still. A hit but I would have liked them a little chewier. Thanks for the recipe. Definitely a keeper!

This is the best recipe I have found.  It was very easy to follow.  I even made them without the peanut butter and just added a handful of extra oats.  I also used reduced fat peanut butter, just because that's what my family uses all the time.  GREAT RECIPE!!

Great easy recipe with indredients usually in residence!  I'll make these with my grandkids next time.  They love to "cook".  Exactly a minute of rolling boil resulted in perfectly set cookies.

Yummy!  Just like I remember my mom making.  We probably boiled them a little longer than one minute, and didn't start timing until the full, rolling boil, and they came out just right.

This recipe is the one like my childhood recipe. We call it cookie crack..it's so addictive. Anyway. I tried one minute after rolling boil. Set up but took a long time, overnight really, but half were gone by then anyway. Second time I cooked 4 min from first boil. I watched when the full rolling boil started at this ended up being 2.5 min after rolling boil. And stirred CONSTANTLY.(I also added 1/2 cup more oats for 3.5 cups total) This batch set up in 15 min and my family preferred the texture. I personally would cut cooking back by 1/2 min so 2 min after rolling boil or 3.5 min from first boil, and stir not so much. Hope this helps.

Childhood favorite!  I was so excited when I finally found this recipe that is so just like the ones I had when I was younger.  I now make these cookies every Christmas.  Super easy and you can't just have one.

I made these as a kid with my mom and every once and a while I crave them.  I didn't have any chocolate but I had Ovaltine for the kids milk on hand and used it instead and it still came out great!  It just took a little more to get the flavor right.  Great recipe and of course the kids loved them!

Great recipe. I did cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups instead of 2 and did the microwave method mentioned in one of the reviews- microwave all ingredients except oats and pb for 3 1/2 min. then stir, microwave for 3 1/2 more minutes and mix in the oats and pb. Mine actually set up in about 15 minutes.

Five stars because my children could not get enough of them!  Mine stayed sticky and didn't firm up but still tasted excellent. Since I will be making more, I will play around with the boiling time and see if I can get them a little less pudding like and more cookie like.  :)

After reading some reviews, I made some changes and thought they turned out great!  I decreased sugar to 1.5 cups (which still seemed to be PLENTY) and cooked AT A ROLLING BOIL for a little over 2 minutes.  Not too runny, definitely not dry!  Next time I will probably try to decrease the sugar by another 1/4 cup and increase the oats by a bit.  I like my cookies hearty.

I love the flavor of these cookies, but for the life of me I can never get them to set right! I just made them again for the 4th time and while they look pretty resting on the wax paper they are to soft to peel off. On a positive note, I made these at 11pm at night, and didn't want to run to the store for white sugar so I substituted dark brown sugar in its place, and they still taste awesome. I normally wouldn't do that, but I was invited to a last minute Sunday Dinner at a friends and thought taking a desert would nice, and these cookies are quick and easy to make.

I love these! I did follow someone's suggestion about how long to boil. Everytime I make them they turn out different. But, they always taste wonderful :)

I am a beginning baker and my boyfriend really wanted these cookies for his birthday.  I was so intimidated by these cookies!  I found this recipe and decided to give it a try and I'm so glad I did!!  If you follow the directions exactly it makes a very yummy cookie!  A few tips I used...measure out all your ingredients before you start cooking so they are ready to go and you can work very quickly.  Once my mix started to boil rapidly, I then timed the boil for 1 minute.  This worked beautifully and I had a large batch of yummy cookies!

I doubled the peanut butter in this recipe and added a bit more vanilla. Delish! I didn't have any problems with them hardening after 1 minute of boiling, but you may want to add 30 seconds on just incase.

I decreased the sugar to 1 and a half cups.  It would have been too sweet otherwise.  I also used all natural peanut butter.  This came out pretty runny but it didn't matter to me the taste was great!  Next time I will boil for 2 minutes instead of 1 as other reviewers have suggested.  Thanks for this, it was a childhood favorite of mine!

For me, it is tricky to get the timing down on these to make them firm. I think you should boil them for a long time. I have boiled them more and more as I make them and am up to 5 minutes and they get at least firm enough to hold to eat, but not firm enough to stack. I do follow the recipe exactly too.  I stick with it because the taste is divine! The mixture of flavors is awesome.

I've been using this recipe for years and it has never let me down!  It's essential to let your mixture come to a full rolling boil before starting to count the one minute.  Perfect every time! :)

I made these cookies last night, we wanting somethng for dessert, and I wanted something easy to make. The recipe I have for these cookies turns out sometimes and sometimes not. So, I thought I would try this recipe. I am very pleased with this one, this is going to be my recipe for these cookies. They turned out perfect, the only thing that I did different was I used old fashion oats. Then I put them on cookie sheets and stuck them in the fridge to cool off and to set up faster. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Old fasion oats work as well as quick cooking in this recipe. I did need to add more oats to this then the recipe called for.  I've made these cookies since I was a little girl. I now use rapadura or sucanat in the place of half the white sugar and add about 1/4 cup flax seeds that I've ground in my blender. It helps to make them a bit healthier, but they're still good. They are still crazy good!

A friend requested some no-bakes and these turned out great.  Followed the instructions and ingredients to a T.  Definitely make sure it comes to a ROLLING BOIL to begin timing as a previous reviewer stated.

This is similar to a recipe I learned to make when I was little. Easy to put together and a tasty treat. My recipe used less sugar and more peanut butter, but resulted in a gooier cookie.

I thought I messed these up when I was making them.  I was afraid I had burned them and was going to throw the mixture out before I even added the oats.  I'm glad I didn't! They turned out really well.  Easy too for those of us who can't bake.

These are super-easy to make. The chewy consistency is great! In the future, I would cut back on the peanut butter a little; maybe by 1/4 cup. I also plan to make a non-chocolate version for those with allergies or those who don't prefer chocolate. This a good base recipe for chewy granola cookies or bars. Add some nuts and/or dry fruit. Yum!

WARNING: Only make these when there is a large group of people you want to feed, otherwise you'll just end up eating them yourself! 
I love these - sort of like fudge - very rich. I ran out of milk and just used plain old water - added a little more oats and they were fine.

I just want to tell you all that I have never found a No Bake recipe that has worked for me, so I love this site so much I thought I would come on here and try to find a recipe and try it ONE more time for my husband and oldest daughter, and it worked!  I boiled for 2 minutes and these turned out perfect, so easy to make and fast and I had my daughter just try one and she loved it, I am going to make another batch for tomorrow.  My husband works 3rds so he hasn't gotten up yet to try one but I am sure if she loved them he will too, she usually has to eat them with a spoon so this was awesome!  Thanks for the recipe!

These are just too good! Followed others suggestion of only using 1 1/2 cups sugar and boiling the mixture for 2 minutes instead of 1 and this came out perfect!  I will definitely make these again!

These are great! I waited until it was at a full rapid boil and timed it for about 2 minutes. I also took another reviewers advice and tried not to stir everything too much for a shiny cookie. They look great and taste better. They haven't fully set yet so I am anxious to see how they do in that area. But it doesn't really matter because they are so delicious! They have the perfect amount of chocolate and peanut butter. I have another recipe that calls for 1/3 c. of cocoa powder and no peanut butter. These are 100 times better! Thank you!

I, like many others, did not have cookies come out of this, but had "globs" instead. The globs did, however, taste very good. They may not have set because I used skim milk and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter. Maybe the minute was not enough to boil the chocolate mixture. Personally, you get the same great taste from a "puppy chow" mixture made with chex mix, chocolate, and peanut butter. That recipe is much easier and has an easier clean up.

Ok recipe.  The cookies were not shiny (possibly due to my part) but I was hoping for a more chocolately-peanutbuttery flavor.  I would add more chocolate next time (and maybe just a tad more peanut butter - I love the stuff).

Simple to make. I boiled for 2 minutes just to be on the safe side and added an extra tbsp of cocoa. As another reviewer said, this is a forgiving recipe. Used a 1/4 cup instead of a teaspoon to make bigger cookies and ate almost all of them myself. Delicious!

All of my coworkers love it when I bring in No Bakes.  When I brought this batch in they actually finished the cookies twice as quickly as the regular ones. I think they really liked it. I thought it wasn't very peanutty and too soft.  I usually add an extra cup of oatmeal which gives it more bite/chew and even so this batch was soft.

1 minute boiling time is definetly not enough time...the boiling time makes or breaks the cookie! At least 2 1/2 to 3 minutes after it starts boiling will make a great looking (and tasting!) cookie :)

I found that it won't set right unless I boil it after I add the peanut butter so now I just add the pb in the beginning.  I also boil for 2 minutes to be safe and it works great.  Thanks.

These were really good - just like the "preacher cookies" my mother used to make.  They're a quick way to satisfy a sweet tooth with just a few common ingredients.

I used just 1 1/4 c sugar and an extra tablespoon of cocoa, so they weren't too sweet and just right. Boiled at rolling boil for about 90 seconds, and they set just fine in the refrigerator.

I made these cookies the other day for my step-son. I read many of the reviews before I made them. I did change the margarine to butter and added 1/2 cup of oats (for a total of 3 1/2 cups) per suggestions. I would like to add more cocoa powder next time. I also did stir, stir, stir and added the vanilla after a full minute of a rolling boil (always stirring). I then added the peanut butter to the hot mix and stired until smooth, then added the oats. The cookies firmed up just great and my step-son and husband ate them all up !! Thanks for sharing the recipe !!

These were the best.  I used butter and crunchy peanut butter because that is what I had.  At first I thought they were going to be too runny, but they hardened up nicely and I was eating them before they had even cooled.  Will make these often because they were so good and easy to make.

I remember making these cookies as a kid.  The recipe first came to me as part of a grade school health class.  They are quick, easy and yummy!  For more peanut butter flavor, use crunchy pb.

So yummy.  I used butter instead of marg and decreased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups.  You could probably get away with just 1 cup.  Mine didn't set hard but they are still yummy (keeping them in the fridge!).  Will boil for longer next time and I hope this will firm them up.  I also added a handful of raisins and chopped apricots.

These cookies were pretty good, but I think next time I will add more cocoa powder or decrease the peanut butter.  I love peanut butter, but I like my no bake cookies to taste a little more chocolate-y than these were.  Texture-wise, these came out perfect!  I brought the mixture to a rolling boil and let it go for 1 min (stirring constantly so not to scorch it), and the cookies were nice and chewy.

Liked it.  Bumped up the cocoa and peanut butter for more flavor.  Boiled for 3 minuted to make sure there was a smooth (not gritty) texture.

Time your boil, and make sure it is a rolling boil!  The comment by Lorna_Eby was a lifesaver!  We used unsalted butter in place of margarine to no ill effects, and our non-quick-cooking oats made for a chewy texture, but we like that so it worked out okay.  If you like a smoother texture, be sure to use quick-cooking!

My boyfriend and I had a late night, must have cookies now! attack, and were also low on ingredients...luckily we had enough to make a half batch of these and I think we had two cookies each they were so chocolatey and fantastic! We made no changes aside from halving the recipe, will definitely make again and again.

These cookies are adictively good. Just make sure you make them plenty of time in advance so they have time to set.

These aren't the same as what my mom made, but with a few changes they get close. My mom never used peanut butter, so I made a few changes. I substituted the PB for extra cocoa in the initial boil as well as reduced the amount of sugar. The trick is to wait for a real rapid boil to start your timer for one minute. Then I added my oats ( I only had the old fashioned kind, so I had to let them cook in the mixture for a minute or two) and about a 1/4 cup of chocolate chips. Mine didn't need wax paper, I just  plopped them on a plate and stuck them in the fridge while I made dinner. Never really formed perfectly, but they are still a little taste of heaven. MMMM

These were great! My husband, who doesn't ordinarily like No Bake Cookies, actually really liked these. He said they were as melty as the other recipe I usually use. I will definatly keep using this one now!

These are great; essentially fudge.  I used rolled oats for better texture but otherwise made the recipe as written.

These are really good, but are extra sweet, so avoid making them too huge... like me. ;o) I made them bake-sale size, and they worked out excellent.

I made this over the weekend and it was awesome. I think I didn't boil them long enough because they were still soft (better luck next time). Despite my mistake, I followed the recipe exactly and these tasted awesome (just like I remember from childhood)!!!

I made these cookies for my husband and he loved them, he said they were just like the ones he had as a child. 
I personally was not fond of the cookie, it tasted like chocolate oatmeal to me.
I'm giving it 5 stars for my husband.

I thought that these were right on.  I dont remember having these as a kid but I wish I would have had the opportunity!!  I think next time I will follow a few other reviews and add a 1/4c. more peanut butter.  Great recipe!!~~~~ I made these again but I only had 2c. oats, so I scaled the recipe down to 16 serv. and less choc., sugar, butter mixture = less cooking time!!  Needless to say they were a little hard and dry, next time I will definatley only cook for 1 minute flat.

These are great, just want I remembered from when I was little.  I made sure the mixture was at a full rolling boil before timing for one minute.  I also used 1/2 smooth and 1/2 chunky peanut butter (still to equal 1/2 cup total), just to add some texture.  They turned out great.

These tasted great, the only problem was MY error in thinking I could sub old fashioned oats for quick cook. It was cheeeewy - not in a good way either. Otherwise, the flavor was RIGHT ON. They were still gobbled up quickly, chewy or not!

Taste great!  Mine were a bit dry, and I followed the directions exact. My Grandmother's recipe has the same ingredients, but she adds the Peanut Butter to the boiling mixture and doesn't add the coco until she adds the Oats and Vanilla.  They are moister that way. Yummy!

Good- but not as good as the recipe like it called "preacher cookies". The extra cocoa gives it what this recipe is lacking.

I bumped up the cocoa to 4 Tablespoons, used butter instead of margarine and omitted the salt since it was already in the butter. These are an easy and fast cookie to make with staples one usually has on had. It came in handy for our egg-allergic family member.

These are pretty good, however mine came out with a fudge like consistency. They set up just fine, but were still a little gooey. Will make again, but I'll boil longer as suggested by other reviewers.

Excellent, easy cookies all without turning the oven on.  Try it with dark cocoa for a richer chocolate taste.

This good old fashion recipe works if you follow the directions.  I have never had a problem with this at all.

These cookies were great.  I followed others advice and let the mixture come to a rapid rolling boil for apprx. 3 minutes.  The cookies set up perfect.

I don't know what is happening with this recipe. The first time I made them, I boiled for one full minute and they turned out sticky and unset. After reading reviews and talking with friends, I decided to leave out the dark cocoa I had used the first time and boil for 2 1/2 minutes (full, rolling boil) stirring constantly. They still won't set.  They taste GREAT - but not formed.

My sister comes over all the time with ingredients for these cookies so we can make them and she can take them home. It's hard to get them to set because usually they are all gone before they can! We love these cookies and will be making a quadruple batch for ur local homeless shelter's Christmas party.

I followed the recommendation of others and reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, boiled longer and 2 hours later, they still haven't set.  Don't think I'll try this one again.

These cookies are very simple to make.  I sometimes use nutulla or marshmallow fluff instead of peanut butter.

These had the right taste as the ones my mom has always made, which was delicious. The only problem was the texture, they never really set, and were pretty gooey. From reading other reviews now, it was probably my fault but I think the recipe should stress the timing a little bit longer. Other than that, they were great :D

I LOVE these cookies. I lost my recipe and this is just like it. My son in now diabetic so I also cut back the sugar. And I usually make 2 batches, one without the cocoa. YUMMY!

I made these last night and like other reviewers mentioned I let the mixture boil a little longer than one minute just to ensure that the cookies would set up properly. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly as written and the cookies are great! I think next time I will add a little less sugar and a little more peanut butter.

I followed others' advice and used 1 1/2 cups sugar and boiled chocolate for 1 minute and 45 seconds. They turn out every time. This recipe was a favorite growing up and now my own kids not only enjoy eating them but enjoy making them too. It is a very kid friendly recipe for older chidren that does not take long to make.

The taste was decent but, at least the way mine came out, it reminded me more of a candy than a cookie. I have never made no bake cookies, so maybe I should have expected that, but, I really overall didn't like them. I am giving them two stars because I am unfamiliar with no bake cookies and may be this is exactly how they are supposed to taste.

These were good but way too sweet.  I wish I'd read the reviews first because I think they would have been perfect with half the sugar.  I will make them with 1 1/2 cups instead next time.

This came out perfect as directed.  I let my boil start after a good rolling boil began and then gave it a few more seconds past 1 minute and it was great.  Perfect fast and easy recipe for after school snack and with few ingredients.  Thanks!

Sadly, these were a disappointment. They never did harden, even by the next day. And they were very, very, very sweet, despite my cutting back to 1.5 cups of sugar as others suggested. I don't know why they didn't harden... I think it's worth a little more effort to get a good, reliable cookie. Sorry.

This recipe is an OLD Texas School cafeteria standard(1960-1970)...of course in triple amounts or more.  I grew up eating them at schools and later I became a lunch lady in the 1980's and I made all the salads, and these cookies, snack items for years while I hatched a few young-uns of my own.  Sadly I later raised my boys in Washington state and the schools here didn't make ANYTHING from scratch for meals or snacks.  I'd had loved it if my kids could have what I consider a pretty healthy snack food.  It has no packaging, no preservatives and they get ate before they get stale.  LOL

The taste is fine, just how I remember, but the texture is WAY too gooey. I might use butter next time. I'm not sure if using margarine and skim milk was the problem, but I couldn't even pick mine up after they had cooled they were so sticky.

I tried this reciepe and it was the very first time that I ever made no-bakes and they came out excellent.  I did boil them for 2 mins, and they held together very well.  I took them to a gathering and there weren't any for me to bring home!  Thanks for such an easy, beginner-like recipe!  It was great.

I've tired many versions of this recipe but this is by far the best. If you allows the mixture to really come to a rolling boil for at least 1 minute they come out right everytime. I've also used crunchy peanut when I was out of creamy and they still tasted great. I love this recipe.

These cookies turned out very good for me and tasted great. I also cooked them for two minutes as opposed to one-(very important). Always looking to cut calories and fat, I decided to try them the second time with lowfat margarine, 1/2 of the peanut butter and Splenda. BAD IDEA. I know you're probably thinking "Well DUH!!", but it was worth a try. Although they tasted OK, they didn't set up until I froze them. 
Oh Well, guess I'll just let the kids enjoy the real things.

My husband needed a dessert for a potluck at work. He forgot to mention it to me, so I only had 1 hour to find something.  These cookies were very easy to do and were not has sweet as some others I have tried in the past. These are the only ones that I have ever made that came out the way they were suppose to. Thanks for the best no-bake cookies.

My 8-year old granddaughter made these.  So easy, great taste.  She used about 1/2 cup less sugar to save calories.  M-m-m-m GOOD!

WHOA! Very good, but very sweet.  That was to be expected though.  I made them bigger than called for and dropped them on foil since I had no wax paper.  I will make them again but maybe cut back the sugar a little bit next time.

I have made these cookies no less than 15 times in the last 3 months.  You can't mess these up!  These are now requested every time I attend a get-together.  I usually double the recipe and it still never seems to be enough!  Great recipe!

Delicious as always!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and boiled a little longer - about 2 minutes.  I was a little worried, since I live at a higher altitude, but these set perfectly.

I rated this 4 stars due to it being a bit salty.  I used the Laura Snyder? organic pb which is just peanuts and salt, so maybe nixing the additional salt will make it less salty?  This recipe did taste its best the next day though.  My sons asked for more :)

I made this recipe and the cookies hardened but they are still seem pretty gooey. I boiled them for two minutes. Maybe I should have boiled them longer. They still taste great though!

These were quite yummy. I made them exactly as written. I topped them with cinnamon and powdered sugar. My son loved them.

I boiled for exactly a minute though and did them just as described in the recipe.

Better than the ones I thought were so wonderful growing up!  Not too sugary!!  The only difference was more peanutbutter (1/2c vs 3T) & adding a pinch of salt to the first ingredients to be boiled--I believe this may help ensure that they turn out; I understand that salt does not make things boil faster, but at a higher temperature.

Very good recipe. You MUST allow the ingredients to boil for ONE MINUTE EXACTLY or they will not set up once cooled. I have messed up several batches trying to rush through it, but hey... even the gooey mess is awesome.

These were as I remembered them from when I used to make them in the 1970s. Like other reviewers, I used 1/2 cup less sugar. We enjoyed this nostalgic treat!

This recipe is ALMOST perfect.  It calls for too many oats.  I used 2 1/2 full cups instead of 3 and they came out awesome!  They have a texture similar to fudge and aren't too liquid or too dry. Love it!!

I added 1 cup of peanut butter because we are super peanut butter lovers.  Because of the extra pb, I had to add extra oats as well.  I always refrigerate them to get them cooled down quickly, and my, what a treat!

Everyone just loves these! I've made them in the past, but I don't think I had the same recipe. I add another heaping tablespoon of peanut butter because we are all pb addicts! The whole house agrees that we should try this with crunchy peanut butter too. 
Thanks!

These turned out soo great! I also reduced the sugar by a fourth as suggested. They took overnight to set...probably had to do with the boiling time (I did it for 90 seconds)...nevertheless  it was worth it!! Thanks!!

Talk about easy! These turned out great and tasted great too. I was out of eggs and craving something sweet and these did the trick! Plus I didn't have to tend to the oven all evening. I ended up with 30 cookies, and that was using a large cookie scoop.

These were good, a unique flavor. I think adding coconut would be a good idea, and tasted better with a little more peanut butter.

So...am I supposed to have the patience to not eat them until their set?  LOL  Half of them were gone before they reached their potential, but this morning, I had one, and it was a good, solid consistency.  These are good...not great, but good.  I think I prefer baked cookies overall.

After reading some reviews, I did two things to make sure the cookies would not be too runny.  First, I added the sauce to the oatmeal so I could see if I needed all the sauce or not.  Second, a friend told me to let the cookie mixture sit in the bowl a little bit to cool down and then spoon it on wax paper.  This worked great.  For a creamier taste, you can also add marshmellows with the peanut butter and stir until all is melted.  Great recipe!

Tasted good - a little too sweet, but that could be easily fixed by decreasing the amount of sugar. Like other reviewers noted, mine turned out kind of runny and didn't set properly. Next time I make these, I'll add more oatmeal, and boil the mixture a little longer too.

These cookies tasted wonderful. I mean who doesn't love chocolate and peanut butter? But they didn't stick together very well and were turned out a little crumbly. Maybe I did something wrong. Either way they were still gone by the end of the day. Thanks

These are very yummy. They didn't really firm up like I thought, so I had to keep them in the fridge. They went to a  meeting my husband had and to plate them I coated the bottoms with finely chopped peanuts, perfect.

This was pretty good! I did decrease the sugar by 1/2 cup as other reviewers suggested. I am a huge chocolate freak and thought it wasn't chocolatey enough for me...so I added almost a 1/2 cup of cocoa powder. Perfect for my family of dark chocolate lovers!

This is the perfect No Bake Cookie recipe!  The perfect amount of each ingredient = the perfect cookie! ;-)  Just the one I was looking for - thank you. 
Someone said 3 cups of sugar was too sweet????  That's because the recipe only called for 2 cups!!  and 2 cups was just right!

This was a big hit, especially with the kids. I made it twice. The second time, I used raw cane sugar instead of white sugar because the cookies were so sweet the first time. The flavors were more balanced with the cane sugar and the consistancy was the same.

Terrific recipe, great for those last minute "Mom, I need to take dessert" moments. For a variation, I use Maypo, in place of oatmeal.  And of course, remember to boil for at least 2 1/2 minutes, as mentioned in reviews before. Thanks Robin for a family favorite!

GREAT RECIPE!  Just in case you don't have the quick cooking oats, you can use the "old fashioned" oats, just use 2 1/2 Cups, the cookie will be heartier, but just as delicious!  Also boil the choc mixture 2 full minutes, and they will set EVERY time!

These rock!  I made one similar without peanut butter, but when my friend brought some with pb, I instantly fell in love with them.  I'm the only one in the house that likes them, so I only do a half batch (a great thing about this recipe).  And I took the advice of some, and added coconut.  It is great to not have to turn the oven on... and I will surely make these again- they are so simple!!!

Great cookies. Came out soft but not runny as they sometimes can. Will use a little less butter next time because the butter flavor is a little heavy for me. Perfectr amount of peanut butter!

These cookies were great!  I made them for my husband to take to work and they were gone in no time!  I also added whole unsalted peanuts and a half cup of coconut.

Love this recipe!  The first time I made it, I didn't let the chocolate sauce boil long enough, so the cookies didn't solidify completely - they ended up very soft, but still tasted great.

Thank you for this recipe. My aunt gave my mom a recipe similar to this when I was little and she would make them all the time.Since becoming a mom myself I've tried to find a recipe,mom's can't be read anymore,so I can give the same treat to my kids.This one is also alot easier than the one mom had.

I used to make these all of the time in high school, never knowing if they'd set up or continue to run right off of the counter.  These set up very nicely.  I added less oats, threw in some graham cracker crumbs, coconut, and more peanut butter.  For my tastes, I will add more chunky peanut butter next time.  Overall, I was impressed at how quickly these cookies set up!

This recipe tastes just like the one I recall from childhood. Since the cookies are easy and fast to prepare, Mom and I could make them for me to take to school for that bake sale or class party I'd forgotten to mention until the last moment...It turned out perfectly. I'm in South Africa now and have just introduce my Afrikaner husband to these No Bakes; he gives them two thumbs up. I had to translate your recipe into metric weights since they don't do the "half cup of margarine" thing here, but it turned out just right. (Guess all those Math Club bake sales are paying for themselves now.) ;)

This is the perfect no-bake recipe.  I have been experimenting with replacing some of the sugar with splenda.  You can't tell a difference when you use 1/4 cup splenda and 1-3/4 cup sugar.  I figure every little bit helps!

This is the best no bake cookie ever!!  I don't bake very well and if I can do these, anyone can!  I actually made 2 batches and wasn't paying attention with the second batch and forgot to add the white sugar to boil, (holiday stress i guess lol) I added it at the end and added a little more milk and peanut butter and oats and they set up just as perfect as the first batch! Will definately make again. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

These cookies are one of my families favorites! Since I have a severe allergy to peanuts, I have adapted the recipe without the peanut butter. I cook the chocolate mixture longer and they turn out wonderful!

the taste is great but mine didn't set right. they've been sitting all night and still stick to the wax paper and are chewy and not right! i added extra oats because they didn't look right from the start. i'll try boiling longer next time!

Ok everyone listen up!  I have NEVER never been able to get my no bake cookies to set up right, until now!  I promise you this recipe works.  I have tried over a dozen recipes and none of them have worked.  You would not believe how excited I was when I got off of work to come home to perfectly set up cookies.  They peeled right off of the parchment paper like they should.  I always hate when people review a recipe and say they changed this or that. But I have to be one of those people too.  I added about 1/2-1 cup more of oats and boiled the sugar, cocoa, milk, and butter for about 5 minutes.  I was scared it wouldn't set up and so I just had to change a few things.  Next time though I am going to cook them as the recipe says and I'll let you know how they turned out then!  Be sure to try this recipe!!! It works!!!

It needs to boil more than 60 seconds.  It should be more like 2.

Mine did not set properly.  I know it was something I did, but not sure what.  Maybe did not boil enough?  I know the cook time is critical, so I timed it at one minute from the time it became a rolling boil.  They are still delicious, just not easy to get off the wax paper.  Will try them one more time.

The cookies turned out soggy. Not sure if I did something wrong. I will try them again and increase boil time. DH thinks they are too sweet, but the kids like them messy or not.

WOW...These are just like the ones my friend's mom used to make me!!!
This recipe is the closest to hers that I have found...Totally delicious!! 
Make sure you watch that boiling time though as it can ruin a batch.

Just like mom used to make and SO easy. My boyfriend made these and they turned out perfectly... so anyone can do it :). He used chunky peanut butter and it really added some crunch. Yummy.

I make these cookies today my oldest daughter was craving some and the last batch lets say didn't work at all. Well got my nerve to try this again and they turned out perfect!! The only thing I did wrong was I printed out the information and during my rushing to put them onto wax paper I placed the paper onto a burner that was turned ON!! and FIRE! I threw it into the sink no harm! Making another batch now!

I leave out the cocoa powder and stir in milk chocolate chips right before I spoon the cookies out on to the waxed paper.  It's a great way to change the flavor of the cookies if you don't like unsweetened cocoa powder.

Very easy, very good. One suggestion - 2.5 cups of oats would be enough. I used old fashioned oats. Cooked at a rolling boil 2 minutes.

Awesome recipe. These have become my boyfriends favorite cookies! So easy to make. I'd taken to adding some coconut in place of some of the oatmeal.

Finally a no-bake that worked!!  The rule about waiting to time after rapid bake really helped.  I used toasted old fashion oats rather than the quick oats.  Very good a bit more bulky & chewy just like I like them!  Also used the reduced fat peanut butter & skim milk.

I can't believe that I haven't seen one suggestion on adding raisins to these, a half a cup is perfect!  Otherwise, I boil a minute longer, and a touch more peanut butter make happy faces!

A little tricky to get right but once I figured out the importance of timing the boiling ingredients they turned out great. I boiled mine for 1 min 15 sec and they didn't set up too gooey or too crumbly. The taste was good. :)

People made these all the time in Michigan.  I've made them so much, I can throw a dozen together without measuring a thing!  When I moved to Arizona, no one had ever heard of them!  They are an easy, delicious treat!

This is really good.  Much like I remember as a kid.  I did have ot make one change to accomadate my gluten intollerant children.  I used quinoa flakes instead of the oats. I also used vanilla soy milk Because that was all I had instead of the regular milk.  All in all very good.  I did find it a little too sweet.  so next time I will be decreasing the sugar to 1 1/2 cups.

Wow, so easy.  I'm not much of a baker, so these are perfect for some one like me.  They are quite good, I used butter instead of margarine, (I don't have the cookbook in front of me, but I swear that's what it said to use in there), and they were a little runny & took longer than I expected to solidify.  They are delicious, maybe a little too chewy though, but my only real complaint is that they are not very aesthetically pleasing.  Other than that, yum!

These were wonderful. I substituted chocolate soy milk for regular milk because it was all I had in the frig, and it turned out wonderful.

These are sooo good. I first came across this recipe many years ago in an old cook book. They were called "Preacher Cookies". The ideal being when the preacher stopped by unexpectedly, you could whip these up in no time. You do have to watch the boiling time so the cookies set up right.

Made this last night, very easy.  Tastes just like the no bake cookies I wanted.  You may want to double the batch if you want these to stick around for a while.

These were very easy to make. I scaled them down to 16 servings because I only had 2 cups of oats. I remember my mom making them when I was a child, but did not remember the taste. They are good! Thank you.

These are so easy to make and everyone loves them. I sometimes add a few extra oats to get them to set right and I stick them in the freezer for a few minutes if I need to transport them to a get-together quickly!

I have never had any luck with no-bake cookies and they are my husband's favorite. The only time he got them was when my mother made them for him. He was so excited when he came home from work and found the perfect no-bake cookie waiting for him. I timed the boiling time for 2 minutes and they set up perfectly. Thank you and my husband thanks you too!

Yummy!Does everyone have childhood memories of this cookie? Don't change a thing and if you don't get the cocoa mixture hot enough (to the candy thermometer soft ball stage) they will not set right but they will still taste good. Thank you Robin.

This is a classic no bake cookie recipe.  I dropped the peanut butter (we never used it when I was a child either), and boy were they delicious!  I am eager to try them with cornflakes, as another reviewer suggested, as oatmeal is hard to find where I live!

I made these for a friend who loves this type of no bake cookies... he loved them, but I thought they were a little too sticky/gooey. They had a hard time coming off of the wax paper. Good to make b/c they're easy.

This was much chewier than I expected; it was almost fudge-like. I know the oats are necessary to hold it together, but their texture isn't quite right. That's why I only gave this a 4. I made it in the microwave and it was wicked simple.

I liked these although they were too sweet for the average person.  They also crumbled when bitten into, so I thought they were a bit dry.  I let them boil for the reccommended 2 minutes.  I will probably make these again but cut back on the sugar by about 1/2 cup.  Overall, pretty good and everyone else who tried them went back for seconds.

Very good. I suggest melting the "wet" ingredients first- I almost burned the white sugar, while I was measuring the next ingredients. Boiling for two minutes was an excellent idea- worked perfect.

This was my first time cooking “no-bake” cookies and they came out perfectly!  I wanted something quick and easy and this was it.  I did take the advice to boil for 2 minutes, everything else I followed to a T; the consistency and set time were perfect.  For those with a big time sweet tooth – this is a cookie for you!  Thank you, Robin, for a great recipe and to all those who submitted their tips!

I just made these cookies and so far they are not hardening. I'm soooo dissapointed. I can never get these to set. I started the timer at two minutes when it started boiling hard.. then took it off at the two minutes. But now, I realize that I didn't actually start the timer when it was boiling at it's most bubbly stage. Next time I will not start the timer until it is almost boiling over the side, then I will time it at that point for 3 minutes.

What is with all of the 5 stars? Yes on simplicity of recipe ... but these are not cookies. They are like eating peanut butter cup candy, dry and pasty. Too sweet and I reduced the sugar. Texture of oatmeal and peanut butter. gritty. I'd rather spend the time and make real cookies ... no thank you on these!

I have had so many recipes for this snack and so far this is the best.  I have yet to make it where it did not turn out.  When I made a double batch, I let it boil for one and a half minutes because of the amount.  They were great!

This recipe was good, but I made an other batch with my own variations. Instead of 2 cups of white sugar I used 1 and 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.I used half and half instead of milk. I also added 1 cup of chocolate chips. All these subtitudes and add ins made a richer more flavorfull cookie! Either way i liked them!

These are by far the best no bake cookies I have ever had.  I followed the recipe exactly and they came out better than perfect.  I highly recommend these.  My husband ate them up.

I remember loving this cookies as a child and now they are my children's favorite cookies.  I've already made two batches within the past few weeks and plan to make more soon.  The only problem I noticed was that they were a little too soft.  I added more oatmeal and they held together great!

This is the very first time I ever made these cookies and they were simply wonderful - thanks not only to this great recipe but also to some of the wonderful tips found among the reviews.  For me some key things were to be sure to have everything prepared peanut butter, oats and vanilla so they are ready to add at the right time and also have ready the 'wax' paper.  I actually didn't have any wax paper so I used, successfully, both plastic coated freezer and the new Reynolds Wrap Release (non stick)aluminum foil.  I tried both just in case one didn't work but they both worked great.  Thanks to all!

This is the ABSOLUTE BEST No-Bake recipe out there.  My neighbors ask me to make them on a regular basis.  I took them to a New Year's Eve party recently and was asked for the recipe by many people.  EVERYBODY loves them!

These were very hard to work with, I couldn't get them on to the waxed paper quickly enough before the mixture began to harden. I also found them to be quite dry looking. I think I might have to add a little extra milk if I make these again. Everyone liked the taste of them though.

I think all of the boiling controversy got in my head. These turned out to be a big slimy gooey nasty. But I know that their awesome cookies, so I will persevere until I get it right.

These are some of my favorite cookies, and they never last long in my home.  I like to keep them in an airtight container in the refrigerator.  I think it makes them extra good.  Also, watch your time very closely.  It's easy to udnercook these so that they don't set right or overcook them so that they are a bit "dry".

I gave this recipe 5 stars for a few reasons. One, it was very easy. Two, I had all the ingredients on hand. Three, I didn't have to heat up my house! And finally, one I wasn't expecting, taste! I figured this would be easy, but didn't get my hopes up for taste. I don't think I've ever had a no bake cookie before, and what a place to start! Thanks for the great recipe, Robin!

This was a good recipe. My mom always makes these and she wasn't home so I decided to follow a recipe from here. I only used 1 cup of sugar and thought they were PERFECT. Although, I did not like the texture of these as much as the ones my mom makes with normal oats (not the quick cooking ones).

These were okay, I keep them in the freezer so if I have a chocolate craving at least there is something REALLY sweet (too sweet) on hand. I only had regular oats so they were very runny, I added a ton more oats just to thicken. My advice: Use the quick cook oats! I won't make these again though.

Easy to make, although mine never did fully "set", even after refrigerating overnight. After reading the reviews, I'd boil the mixture a bit longer than 1 minute.  Not a bad cookie, but not great.

I thought these cookies were OK, but my kids thought that they were terrific.  I used regular oats becasue that was all I had, maybe they will be better with the quick cooking as the recipe calls for.  I will try these again.

If you like peanut butter and chocolate and oats all in one, these are the ones to make. I use to make these a few years back but had lost the recipe. The only difference was I added 1/3 cup more of cocoa. I've also made these in a bar type.  The only problem with these is that they do not last long enough. Double the batch works most of the time.

Our family has been making this for years with the addition of 1/2 cup marshmallow creme, 1/2 cup coconut, and up to 1 cup extra oats--usually add till mixture is stiff.  It's a family favorite.

These are wonderful. Very easy and yummy. They keep thier shape at room temperature so they are great for tucking into a gift basket or setting out on a party buffet. We renamed them "Hockey Pucks" because they resemble pucks and we love hockey! TRY THESE!!!!

This recipe was close to another recipe that my family has loved for years. I tried this one for something different and loved the peanut butter touch.
They were quick, cheap to make and easy. They turned out better than the other ones I've made over the years. Definitly a new family favorite!

THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for this recipe! JUST like my great grandmother and aunts used to make. This is the ONLY cookie I have ever successfully made. I do recommend boiling the cocoa mixture 2-3 minutes to ensure they sit well, but don't over do it! AGAIN! THANK YOU SO MUCH!

This has always been my ALL TIME FAVORITE cookie!!!  I've eaten enough to know!!  The most difficult thing about making these cookies is timing the boil just right.  If you boil too long, the dough will turn to crumbs.  If you don't boil long enough, the dough will not harden.  Either way, the dough still tastes great, though!! :)  ENJOY!!!

Fantastic, I burned myself twice because I couldn't wait for them to cool.  I used instant oatmeal instead of rolled oats and one tbsp of cocoa instead of three. Just as good.  Next bake sale, these are going in.

Just like my Mom used to make!  I've asked my mom for her recipe for this cookie and she didn't even remember making it.  These were easy and turned out perfectly for me.  My only changes were that I used real butter and let it boil for about 3 minutes.

Just like I remember as a kid!!  They were so easy to make, too.  I have made this recipe two times, and the second time I poured the hot mixture into the oatmeal mixture, and the oatmeal turned out softer when the cookies were set up.

Yummy! Hardened up perfectly for me the first time. I doubled the amount of cocoa 'cause I like them chocolaty. Also, I used real butter. MMMM.

These are one of my favorites- very addicting! I use a little less milk than called for, and boil about five minutes. Ive wasted alot of ingredients -but theyre well worth it once you get it right.

My two-year-old nephew helped my make these and I never caught myself becoming frustrated with him; that in itself makes these cookies worth trying!

Gives the impression of eating chocolate and healthful roughage as well.  One doesn't feel guilty, at all.  Probably should, but doesn't.

I also learned to make these as a kid, in the 3rd grade, and have been making them ever since. For people who are having trouble with the cookies setting - make sure you use whole milk, that makes a big difference.

These didn't set up as well as I would have liked.  Maybe too hot of a day?  But even gooey, they were very yummy.
