I gave this only 4 stars simply due to the double deep-frying, which is how I used to make them (like most restaurants do).  Then I discovered simply par-boiling my cut fries, for about 2 minutes, draining them, and then wrapping them in clean dish towels to cool.. the towels absorb all moisture from the potatoes.  Another good tip is, for crispier fries, drain your fried fries in brown paper bags; paper towels tend to soften them, plus it's easier to shake them up with salt in the brown paper bag.

Quick, easy and delicious. Try par-boiling and chilling before the first fry to make them really fluffy on the inside.

Darling husband bought a french fry cutter at the flea market and was dying to make his own hand cut fries.  This recipe was a great guideline for making crispy fries.  Thanks!

they are good tasting but  3* because 1. what human wants to wait 1 hr for fries? not this one. 2. only good if you like them crunchy. 3. just use peanut oil and fries and all foods taste good regardless. i chopped my potato put in 375*  fried for 10 minutes came out almost identical close enough to not waste the 50 min lol. i did side by side comparison and the difference was the dbl fried had more potato flavor where as my single fried was more greasy. if you dislike grease perhaps frying is not for you.  i like my fries soft like the chip wagons. canadian here tho we are different! poutines don't come with crunchy fries . also this method makes them extremely brown meh aesthetically not appealing.  we are all different to each his\her own

Double-frying makes all the difference!  I took advice from other recipes on this site and added sugar to the water for extra crispyness.  Also, I use peanut oil - it's more expensive but tastes much better (in my opinion).  I will definitely use this method again.

I am quite the newbie at fried foods. I REALLY like to stick to the baked version, but baked just isn't the same sometimes. This is a GREAT recipe- but I seemed to have a bit of difficulty with it...maybe it was just me?? Soaking the spuds before frying is a MUST! Takes most of the starch out & allows for the taters to seep up the oil (which is unhealthy, but yummy)! Double frying seems to be the key- wonderful the first round on a lower temp, but I ran into problems on the phase 2 of frying on 350 degree is... the alloted time noted by the chef was 5-6 min. on 350 degrees. I had mine in there at that temp for only 3-4 minutes and they were already turniing crispy & VERY brown (maybe I cut too thin since we like shoestring fires?). I was looking for fried you'd see more at one of the deep fried fast food resteraunts- so if you are looking for that, I suggesst more of a frying time on the 1st round, less on the second & keeping an eye on it to make sure it isn't turnng CRISPY/BROWN deep brown. 
All recipes can be "perfect" by trial & error. this one, needs more time on the phase 1 of frying and less time on the phase 2 at a higher temp, keeping a close eye. But, thank you, Chef John! Great one to start (and maybe my deep fryer is different than what was suggested??) Just TRY it! Doesn't hurt to try- trial & error makes perfection. :)

My mother (and me) was born in Belgium.  She always made her French fries like this. I'm 68 and I'm still making my fries this way - nothing better than the old "tried and true" recipes, for sure!

These were perfect and easy to make! Just make completely sure you pat the fries dry before deep frying them! I made that mistake one time and they came out very soggy. As long as you follow the directions and make sure you pat them dry of the water and let them cool before deep frying them again they will turn out perfectly crispy and better than any restaurant fries!

These were fabulous.  I made extras to see if they would freeze well.  I placed them on a cookie sheet after the first frying and froze them.  Cooked them about a week later and they were perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made these fries for my husband's birthday dinner to go with steaks. I put a bit a sugar in the water while the potatoes were soaking like other reviewers suggested. They were perfect; crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside. Thank you Chef John.

I learned this method watching Julia Child on PBS back in the 70's - perfect fries!  First cooking at the lower temp is just to cook the potato, then you MUST let cool a bit, then do the second round at the higher temp to actually "fry" them - perfect crispness on the outside, with perfect soft potato inside.

Wow!  What a difference just a technique change can make.  These fries are exactly what I was looking for in texture and flavor...and leave the skins on!  I would compare them to a 5 Guys burger and fries quality.  The only complaint I have is that my fryer is too small to make enough at one time and keeping them warm between batches would require me to heat up the oven or toaster oven on a keep warm setting.  There has got to be affordable bigger home fry machines out there.      Thanks so much for posting this, you've solved my 30 min. one way trips for my fry cravings!

I followed the instructions, down to using my thermometer to check the oil temp. They came out weird. The inside was nice and fluffy, and tasted right, but the outside was not at all crisp, even though they were nicely brown. Overall good taste, but totally soggy. A whole lot of work for subpar results.

Followed exactly and the fries were great.  I used my electric frying pan  to make adjusting the temps easy. It wasn't messy, really no splatter.  I strained the oil  to reuse. Thanks for the recipe!

I've been using this method for years. But I slice mine as thin rounds and add Old Bay seasoning once they're done. Twice-fried is the best way to go!!

I will definitely be making these again! I put two layers fries between paper towel after the first frying (didn't make the fries soggy at all). The fries were deliciously crunchy yet soft in the middle. My husband said these were better than most restaurants. I seasoned with sea salt, garlic powder and grated Parmesan. Yum!

Super Duper.

The second frying, watch your color - not the time. Delicious with some sea salt and ketchup or mayo.

Don't know how they will freeze after the first frying, but am going to find out.

These are as good as I have ever had!

Awesome and simple, I often make this along with Chef John's chicken finger recipe. It's my kids' favorite lunch. While this may not pass the healthy food test, it's definitely better than buying it at the fast food places where you can't really tell what's in it. Here you are sure it is 100% from potato because... Well, you've made it.

This recipe is great as is, howsomever, we usually do up a big batch on first frying and freeze some for later use, and the votes are split on which way is best regarding the taste. Adding some beef tallow to the oil also helps with crispness and flavor. Have tried par boiling potatoes in lieu of first frying, but still like double frying best, although they'll soak up less oil if you're using the par boiled method. If you are using peanut oil in 2nd frying, you can increase the temperature to 365 and shorten the fry time to 3.5 minutes. Always use 350 degrees if you're doing frozen ones. Lastly, check your oil temp with a good thermometer, as 350 on most electric friers is not the actual temperature.

Married 44 years and counting... Gotta let the hubby have his fried foods and desserts.  :D  These fries are the best!  I am not a huge potato fan, but even I can't resist these.  As always, another winner from Chef John.

I received a deep fryer as a gift and searched the internet for a French-fry recipe, supposedly crispy fries.  They tasted OK but were as limp as a wet noodle.  The next day I found Chef John's recipe and what a difference.  They tasted better than any other French-fry I've ever had (including from a restaurant), and were crispy too.  In my opinion this is the BEST French-fry recipe in every way.

I've been trying to make great fries forever and the double frying was what I was missing, can't thank this guy enough the fries were crispy and so dang good some of the best fries the Wife and I have ever had. Don't listen to the egotistical reviews the narcissists always half to one up or be better. If your too impatient to wait the time it takes then go buy them.

This was perfect!!  So here goes ... I was a little short on time so rather than 30min water soak I washed the cut potatoes very well in cooolllddd water.  We like thicker fries so used a little more time on the first fry. I cooled in between by placing in frezzer. Then on second fry again took some more time. Finally placed them on a baking rack in warm oven until we were completely ready for burger and fries night. Total hit for the pickie family

Rinsed and drained the potatoes 3 times during their soaking stage.. using a deep fryer, the first fry was done at 320 for 5-6 kind till slightly golden and   I let them cool completely....second fry done at 375 for 6 mins and they were perfectly crispy pub fries!

I soaked the fries for 15mins in water. Then got new water and put in 1/3 cup white sugar, then soaked the fries for another 15mins. Afterwards I followed Chef John's recipe exactly. Turned out spectacular. I will cook them this way every time from now on.

This is the best recipe for fries I've ever made. I usually just put the cut up potatoes in the oven without soaking them...and they never turned out as good as these. They are perfectly soft on the inside, and tastefully crunchy on the outside.  If someone has a problem with the time it takes, then start them earlier. I will always use this recipe. Thank you! :)

These were the best fries ever....worth the time :-) Double deep-frying is the key. I also added sugar to the water (reccommended by some reviewers).

This is probably the best French fry recipe I have cooked to date. I like fries with a lot of different dishes.  It's important to keep all the fries cut the same size and don't skip any of the steps. Be sure the potatoes are fully cooled off before second cook.

Start this whole process early. Begin soaking cut potatoes in sugar in the morning or right after lunch.  Fry the fries for the first time in the afternoon and degrease on newspaper so the are cool and ready to fry a second time for supper.  The kids say these are the best fries ever!

Absolutely fab.  We don't want french fried potatoes often, but when we do, this is the go to recipe.  Yes, it takes extra time, but great fries are worth the effort.  How fortunate that we have "Chef" willing to share some secrets.  I'm working through many of his recipes.  Thanks for sharing.

Followed this “recipe” (One russet potato to one QUART of oil??) and got some overcooked, horrible result. Does NOT need to be cooked more than once. Mistake.

I’m at visually a couple of times every week. My husband and son both love them! Frying them twice is definitely the secret to success here. I can’t believe I never knew the secret until recently! My only advice would be to leave the fries in to cook Longer than you think you need to so they crisp up. Yummy!

The little bit of extra effort is worth it. My wife loves steak fries. I cut wedges and followed the recipe. They turned out fantastic. She said they were better than any restaurant. Double frying is the key!  Thanks for the recipe Chef John!

These were actually best when I froze the leftover fries that had been fried once. When I got them out  of the freezer and gave them their second frying they turned out even better.  Fluffy on the inside and crisp on the outside.

This worked perfectly for me! My potatoes were unpeeled and cut into medium size rectangles. I cooked them for 5 minutes the first time, and didn’t really have a set time the second but it was somewhere between 4.5 and 6 minutes. Make sure you cook small batches; use too many potatoes and they’ll stick together and won’t cook evenly. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did :)

Thank you for sharing this recipe. I’ve just been cutting up potatoes and throwing them in the fryer. They turned out soggy and greasy. I followed this recipe and the potatoes were soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. They weren’t greasy at all. Allrecipes is a great help to home cooks like me who don’t have a clue how to cook.

These were worth the extra work of peeling and cutting your own potatoes. I’ve made fries at home before, but they didn’t turn out as good as these. I’ll definitely be making them again!

If I am going to double cook them, why not boil them first? Just make sure they are dry and cooled before you get them up. So yummy and worth the extra step.

I think I should have fried longer each time.  Set a timer for 5 minutes both times.  Still, very good fries.  I used a little sugar in the water.

The place I am housesitting at has a deep fryer, so I decided to try making some of my favorite deep-fried items. French fries are definitely my favorite way to enjoy potatoes, and I have tried countless versions. To be fair, I have never deep-fried or fresh cut potatoes before, so I can’t actually compare this to other recipes. I can however provide an informed opinion on the end result, and these are fantastic!! 

I used some fresh vegetable oil, but most of it was previously used peanut oil. (After researching, I learned that many chefs use a mixture of old and new oils to get the best flavor). Make sure it isn’t rancid or super darkened if you use it though. I followed the directions exactly, and seasoned them with garlic salt and a little parsley. They needed a little longer in the dryer because they were a bit thick, but the turned out perfectly. They were to die for! 

I look forward to making them again and topping with truffle oil, Parmesan, and garlic. (Not necessarily at the same time).

Thank you Chef John!

Double frying is the key.  I tasted the fries after the 1st frying and sure enough, the insides were soft and fluffy. The 2nd frying made them crisp on the outside and perfect. 
They did not last long on my table. 
We will make these again and again.

I used to cut up some potatoes, drop them in oil, and take out when brown with mixed results. I had no idea what I was missing. These fries are incredibly crisp on the outside. Absolutely the best fries I have ever had.

I made this recipe by using sweet and russet potatoes. It worked out perfectly crispy. I have a deep frier and cooked fries at 320F, first,  then I turned up the temperature to 375F for the second fry. I cooked and cooked the fries to room temp. before frying the second time.  I pre-soaked the fries in 1/4 cup sugar and warm water,  adding the fries after icing the water to get it cold, as directed in Chef John's recipe. The sweetened water creates a crisper exterior on the frittes,  but isn't a critical step.

Pretty good stuff! A really good starting point to further tweak the cook times and temps. For instance, I kept them in longer on the second fry and got them way crispy the second times which was dope.

This is by far the best french fries I have ever made and believe it or not easier than you think.
  I used Canola Oil and my first fry was stove top, then while they chilled, I put that oil in the deep fryer, heated it up to the noted temperature. When done and oil drained from my fry's I gently tossed with cracked pepper and season all. YUMMM... Chef John THANK YOU for sharing your great idea. 
Joanna Guido :-)

Works perfectly for me, with the tiny exception that after the first frying, the potatoes tend to stick to the paper towels we use to dry them. That ain't no problem if the results are as crispy and nicely done as these.
Cooking some tonight with fried shrimp.
Bon Appetit.

Thanks again, Chef John, for yet another awesome recipe! I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect! I tried making fries a few times with other recipes and they just weren't getting crispy and were such sad and soggy fries. Not these though! Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The kids and I made a few different batches, one with regular salt, one with seasoned salt, and a third with Old Bay and regular salt. It was fun to experiment with different flavors.

I used frozen Oreida Fries and found that they work perfectly IF you do the first fry at 350 deg.  The frozen fries cause the oil temp to drop initially to down about 270.  After removing the fries and letting the oil come back up to 350, you're ready for the second fry.  Frozen fries are relatively cheap, convenient and eliminate the washing,  peeling, cutting and drying steps.

I love homemade fries - but I don't have a deep fryer and feel this was a waste of oil.  It was also a lot of steps for what basically turned out to be my grandmother's recipe for homemade fries which uses way less oil and doesn't involve double frying (but twice fried are great).  Either way - it was worth the experience to try it this way.

These turned out great .Better than most restaurants I've been . After my First deep fry I put in refrigerator to cool. This gave me plenty of time to get other things ready.

There is a lot of love (work) that goes into these fries, given the two part cooking process but they are well worth it!  I made them as the recipe is written.

my fries turned to mush after initial 4 1/2 mins of frying at 250 degrees. The final product tasted ok but they were small bits and pieces of fries due to them coming apart after initial frying.

I made this the other day. It was so good, I made a lot. Everyone at our house ate them all and asked for more. Double frying these fries made it crispy. I won't go back to baking and buying store fries. Thank you Chef John.

Cut potatoes into 1/2 inch using FF cutter. Sous vide , single layer, in salt water packet until they begin to soften. Drop sous vide packet into ultrasonic cleaning machine at 170 degrees until outside of fries get a bit damaged and fuzzy looking. Drain packet and put fries into chamber vacuum on paper towel to vacuum dry them. Then double fry as described. Yes, I do this at home. I can do everything in advance.

I will try this again.  I followed the recipe to the letter but my potatoes, on the 2nd frying at the higher temperature did not come out as crisp as I expected.  Next time I will extend the 2nd cooking time.

I had always wondered why my home made fries came out lumpy and unsatisfactory. This simple recipe fixed all that!  Just make sure you start soaking them plenty ahead of time.

Going to look for other recipes that may be able top keep the fries from soaking up so much oil. However, I put them in for 6 min 30 seconds on the lower temp. That could be why they were slightly soggy. Overall a great recipe and extremely simple.

These were excellent!  I've always wanted to try twice-fried fries, but I'm a very bad fry person.   After I got a Nuwave cooktop and an instant read thermometer, I was set.  This recipe was perfect, and I made the most amazing steak fries that I've eaten outside of a restaurant.  I will never make frozen fries again.  I can abstain as long as I can so that I can just make these homemade, they're that good.

My husband and I made these french fries tonight and they were out of this world.  Just fries with a light dusting of kosher salt.  We followed the directions to the tee.  The only thing different is that I don't have a dutch oven so I used my cast iron chicken fryer.  I was only frying 3 potatoes cut rather thick.  The outside was so nice and crisp and the inside was like biting into a baked potato.

Fantastic! Double frying really made a difference, used golden potatoes (what I had) and the flavor was great :-)

Perfect!This is the first time I tried this and they were delicious! Some people say "all fries are the same." No way! I'm a french fry nut and eat them all the time, and these turned out perfect!

This is the way to cook french fries but.. I use peanut oil and they come out better! If you like them seasoned... You can add crushed garlic and toss before the second fry and a little seasoning salt when done. Perfect!

These turned out very good.  My family loved them.  The second fry was only a few minutes for me and they started turning brown fast. I don't fry food very often but will use this recipe when I make homemade fries.

These wee absolutely spectacular.  Glad I made more than I needed because everyone wanted seconds.  I am a believer in twice fried from now on.

These fries turn out perfect for me every time. But I have a little secret. Don't use fresh oil. The fries about 3 sets in are the best so far!! So keep the oil every time. I'm sure there's a limit on this, so be careful!!
