3.29.18  In college, we used to throw into the blender a can each of frozen lemonade concentrate, whiskey, and water.  This is the first time I've made one from scratch.  It's been many years since I've had a whiskey sour, but for my taste, I did add more booze and lemon juice.  Good, enjoyed it!

Perfect light  drink. I added more cherries and a bit of the juice.

As written, it was way too sweet and didn't have enough whiskey (yet I am not a fan of very strong drinks).  I doubled the lemon and the whiskey and kept the simple syrup the same and it was pretty darn good.  Giving it 4 stars though because it is easy to change it to suit your taste, as Hot Mama states.

I am giving this a five star rating based on the mix of the lemon juice/simple syrup.   I doubled the whiskey (Jack Daniel's) but still had to add more.  Maybe I just prefer a strong drink, but I don't think this drink should be downgraded starwise because of that!  I would definitely make this again with a triple dose of whiskey!  Thanks, HotMama!
