This was by far the best seafood pasta meal I have ever been able to prepare at home!  A bit of bread crumbs on the top add a bit of great crunchy texture.

This recipe was wonderful!  I especially liked how creamy the sauce was.  I substituted white cooking wine for the sherry, omitted the mushrooms, and added a 1/4 tsp. of lemon-pepper seasoning.   Even my husband who usually doesn't like the "shrimpy" taste loved it.

This recipe is great.  It is very easily doubled or quadrupled (which I did for New Year's Day). It is rich and creamy, so it goes a long way!  The only additions I made were fresh chopped parsley (for a little color) and freshly grated black pepper.  I have made it three times now and was suprised to see that no one else had rated it.

It was too bland, even with the addition of garlic and lots of cracked pepper.  My husband put Chinese chili sauce on it so he could eat it...not a good sign.

Was going to make shrimp scampi, a family favorite, but decided to make this instead.  This was very good, but I made a few changes: added olive oil and butter to the pan, sauteed the onions for about 7-8 minutes, then added fresh sliced garlic, sauteed it for another 5-6 minutes, added the mushrooms and continued cooking the mix until the mushroom were golden brown using low heat,  then threw in shrimp and scallops until done.  Made the sauce but used white wine,  1 cup of heavy cream and 1 cup of milk with the remaining ingredients, added the shrimp/scallop/mushroom mixture back into the sauce and finished it with fresh parsley and tarragon.  Instead of finishing it in the oven, I tossed in the pasta and served it.  Turned out great.

I highly recommend doubling the shrimp and parmesan cheese and adding some minced garlic to the recipe. I used whole wheat pasta. If you use cooking sherry ("if you can't drink it, don't cook with it"), omit the extra salt.

I thought this recipe was very good.  We are a big fan of shrimp scampi, but wanted to try something new.  We enjoyed it very much.  I did however add a touch of cayenne pepper to the shrimp while it was cooking.  Be careful however not to add extra pasta than the recipe calls for without compensating with extra sauce or you end up with a very sticky pasta dish.

After reading reviews I decided to make this recipe.  We all liked it.  I would have liked to give it 4 1/2 stars but that is not an option.  My husband was a little weirded out by the mayo and sherry mix, but in the end liked it.  I did make some changes:  more shrimp and garlic.  Next time I will add more salt, it seemed bland.

I really liked this recipe! It was easy with simple ingredients. Even a poor, starving college kid could afford it! Thank you for a great meal inspiration. Leftovers are great, too!

I agree, very good recipe and next time I make it, I will definitely add more shrimp as well as garlic.  I used Penne instead of spaghetti and also put some butter on the top of the pan before baking, as well sprinkled some bread crumbs on top.

Wow! Really fantastic. I too doubled the shrimp and I cooked the veg and shrimp on Med not Med/Low. The first recipe I've tried off this site and I'm really impressed.

Fabulous.  I substituted salmon filets for the shrimp, baked them right on top and it was wonderful.  Left out the salt for health reasons, didn't miss it at all.  Added frozen peas when making the sauce. Might try it with broccoli next time.  It's a keeper!

i would not make this again. It came out so greasy because of the mayo- it was too greasy.. I didn't try it, but my husband had it and he was okay with it, but couldn't eat to much of it because he felt sick because it was so greasy.

Yipes, was this heavy!  The sauce was a little on the bland side, so I followed others advise and added some garlic and Old Bay.  My husband, who is a big eater, even said he'll be digesting this all night.  Even with the added garlic and spice, it just wasn't that flavorful.

I didn't like this recipe at all. The sauce in my opinion was way to bland. I even added garlic and a little lemon pepper and it still tasted like flour. I will not be making this again!

This is delicious. I took the suggestions of some other people and added ceyanne pepper, garlic and doubled the shrimp. I also substituted coconut milk for the sherry. If you like coconut shrimp you will like this variation.

This was really good, but I think next time I'd add a bit more flavor too it.  It was kind of bland.  Next time I'll add some garlic when cooking the onion mixture, and I'll probably stir some more Parmesan cheese right into the pasta before it cooks.  I'll definitely be making it again, though.  It made a very nice dinner.

I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe. . .  really wasn't sure about the mayo, but it turned out quite good! Added garlic and fresh parsley, added the parmesan to the sauce and sprinkled some more on top before baking. I like a lot of sauce so in my kitchen this would be a meal for 3 at the most, instead of 4, using less pasta.  I've also made it using scallops and I like it even better than with shrimps!   If you don't have sherry white wine is okay to use in this recipe.

this was incredibly delicious. LOVED the creamy sauce. I didnt have any sherry so I improvised with an 8th of a cup of grape juice and a tad of apple cider vinager. Definetly going into the rotation.

I usually make chicken tetrazzini, so I thought I would try something new and use shrimp. This recipe was great! It was actually better than my normal chicken tetrazzini recipe. I think the mayo made it much more creamy and I like the sherry. My husband and 4 year old son loved it!

The ingredients blended together well but the overall effect didn't "wow" the family.  Maybe it was the whole wheat pasta I used?  I served it with potato leek cheddar soup (from allrecipes) which did get rave reviews.

This was very tasty - but as my husband says - nothing is worth a five star unless you want to keep eating it even when you are full....
I wish it had a bit more flavor.  I added fresh garlic, black pepper and a bit of cayenne.  I even added more sherry to get that yummy "wine" taste.  I will make again - and of course this would be good with chicken or turkey too.

Great shrimp and pasta dish - did add more shrimp and mushrooms - also added some chopped garlic and red pepper flakes while cooking the shrimp mixture.  I didn't have enough milk so added some half and half and really had a great flavor and texture.  Will make this again and again.

This is the first time I've rated a recipe! So delicious!  Take advice from other reviews about adding garlic, Old Bay, cream cheese, and doubling the amount of shrimp.  I used ritz cracker as topping.  It's a party for your tastebuds!

this was the best recipe I've gotten off this site. however,i did change some things. I used linguine instead of spaghetti. for the shrimp, I sprinkled with olive oil, salt, pepper, fresh lemon zest and freshly grated garlic. then roasted in 400 oven for 6 minutes.since my son hates mushrooms I roasted them along with the shrimp with the same seasonings as shrimp so that whoever wanted them could add to their plate. the sherry is such an important ingredient in this dish, it adds a lot of flavor!Didn't bake mine at all, just added pasta to the sauce, put on plate and sprinkled Parmesan cheese and fresh squeezed lemon. Delicious!

This was a hit!  My husband raved over it, and it was easy to make.  I did add a little more salt and crushed pepper and a dash of red pepper, since we like a little zing in our food!  I didn't have any sherry, so I substituted white wine.  I will definately cook this again.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was pretty good. I used olive oil instead of butter to make it slightly more healthy. I might add more cheese next time to increase the flavor.

This is a great starter recipe!  I did a lot of substituting for it.    I reconstituted dried shiitake mushrooms, added the water from the mushrooms and the tails of the shrimp to the pasta water (remove tails prior to adding pasta!)  I dind't have sherry so I used mirin.  Will remember to use much LESS mirin next time.    I was quite miffed when I realized I didn't have any milk but it gave me the chance to experiment and use unsweetened almond milk instead.  I used a hand mixer to blend in 2 TBS of 0% fat Greek yogurt to give it the milky flavor with much success.    I also ended up putting the cheese in the sauce directly as I didn't plan on baking it.  I then used the hand mixer on the sauce prior to putting it on the shrimp and pasta.    As for the pasta itself I used spinach and chive pasta (courtesy of Trader Joes)

Fabulous! Fabulous!  Definitely double the shrimp and add garlic (2 cloves).  My entire family (husband, 10 year old and 22 month old) loved it.  We didn't have any leftovers.  Went great with caesar salad and garlic bread.

Very good recipe.  I was backwards this time, in that I read the reviews after I made it, but my minor changes made this excellent.  I used a 16oz bag of frozen, deveined shrimp, which I had "marinated" in Dale seasoning (you can find in the same aisle as A-1, etc.)and some Old Bay.  I had a medium vadalia onion, which I chopped and sauted in margerine as directed.  Because I'm a garlic lover, I minced about 3 cloves and sauted along with the oninons.   I then added my marinated shrimp, to include the brime (be careful because the Dale seasoning is salty in nature, so you wouldn't want to be heavy handed with salt).   I had shredded Kraft Parmesan/Ramano cheese, which I mixed approximately 1/2 - 1 cup in with the finished mixture, to include the spaghetti.  I then topped the dish with shredded parmesan cheese and sprinkled some mild cheddar cheese just to add some color.  Wonderful!  I will make again.  Oh yeah, I have tendencies to be lactose intolerent, so I substituted water for about 1/2 cup of the milk.  Also, I did not have mayonaise, so I used the Miricle Whip that was in the fridge.  

Yummy!

I did not care for this recipe!  The sauce tasted like pure flour.  I made it exactly as the directions followed.  Then I tried all that I could do to "save" it and nothing I added made it any better.  We are NOT picky eaters....and we do not expect 5 star meals everynight....this one was just one of those zero star recipes.  Check my feedback, I usually love everything that I make.  Sorry

I couldn't understand all the reviews that said the dish was bland; the ingredients look right, and seemed like it would be fine. Well, it is bland. It's the sauce- the only "flavor" is salt and sherry. Although I sauteed the shrimp with mushrooms, onion and garlic, (and cayanne and black pepper) it is not enough to help the sauce, which I made exactly as directed. I've never had tetrazzini before though; maybe it is supposed to taste like this. Either way, I will not make this again without serious modifications to the sauce.

I thought this was a little bland.  I added Old Bay Seasoning to the sauce and it helped quite a bit.  I also used cream cheese instead of mayo per another reviewer.  I also mixed the Parmesan cheese in, instead of putting on top.  I find when you put it on top sometimes it burns.  Worked well to mix it in.

I made this sans sherry. Definitely needs garlic, pepper (black and red), and a dash or two of Old Bay and a splash of lemon juice for acidity. pretty bland, but not terrible.

This is a very easy dish to make. My husbund, who totally prefers red meat, loved it. I added garlic to the onion and used canned mushrooms because that was what I had on hand. I will definatly go for the fresh ones next time.

I have been using my own Chicken Tetrazzni recipe for years but it's always been so time consuming that I thought I would search for something quicker. This was definately faster to prepare. The mayonaise threw me off at first but it turned out to be OK.  I enjoyed the texture and flavor. I rarely cook any Italian dish without garlic so I did add that in as well as some fresh ground pepper. I wouldn't use shrimp again though. It tasted too Tuna Casserole-ish to me so I'll stick with chicken. Overall a good recipe if you're short on time.

Wasn't a big fan of the sherry, but we're gonna try it again without or with less. We'll see if we can doctor it up a little bit to our taste buds. The shrimp were pretty good though.

Everyone in the family loved this. Next time I won't cook the shrimp as long on the stove, I thought they were slightly overcooked. I also agreed with the over reviewers that this needs some extra spices.

We made this during our seaside vacation with FRESH shrimp - it was wonderful!  I added garlic, 1/4 tsp. ground black pepper, a few dashes cayenne pepper, and 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes to give it a bit more flavor.  I also used 1 cup half-and-half and 1 cup water to cut down on the lactose.  The leftovers were great the next day.  It was a hit with young and old alike.

This is a good basic recipe that leaves plenty of room to experiment. If you want it to have a little zip add the garlic and some spices. If you want mild, try adding a little nutmeg. I've tried it both ways and enjoyed it each time.

This was really good. I didn't add Sherry to the mixture, but before putting it in the oven, I added mozz. cheese all over the top. I also threw in some chopped garlic and parsley with the onions for more flavor. I would definitely make this again!

This was such a crowd pleaser.  I did add garlic along with the onion just because I like it but didn't change anything else.  Really fantastic.  Thinking about trying it with chicken also.  Yummy.

I loved this!  Perfect tetrazzini sauce.  My husband didn't love it - said it was bland.  I think he doesn't realize that tetrazzini isn't supposed to be spicy/bold.  Will make again and again, I'll also try to sub with chicken.

This was pretty amazing.  I don't like shrimp, so I substituted with tuna and it turned out great! I bet it would be equally good with chicken too

This was an okay recipe. It was lacking in flavour even after adding fresh parsley as recommended by others. The dish had a good texture and was definitely creamy but I would spice it up even more maybe adding red pepper flakes if I were to make it again.

Very good. I was scared to add all the mushrooms because it looked like so many,I just started acquiring the taste of mushrooms, didn't want to overdo the mushrooms but I gave in and oh was I happy I did. This recipe is great. My husband liked it and so did I. I'll make this again.

I used this recipe during lent, made it for my co-workers and kept it in a crockpot.  If you plan on keeping it warm for some time like I did, cook the pasta until it is almost done, but not quite al dente.

This was pretty good. Nothing spectacular, but easy to make and adapt to your liking. I added red pepper flakes and used cream instead of milk. Made it richer and more fattening! I agree with others that you need to saute garlic with the onion and double the shrimp. A good family night recipe. I made garlic cheese biscuits to really make the meal and give us really bad breath.

Very good, first time for us to try shrimp in this manner of cooking. We changed a few things, made a double batch. Used two bags of frozen shrimp, pulled off tails set aside, used 1/2 stick of butter, extra onions,  plus added three crushed garlic cloves to the butter mix, sauted' until onions were clear-- set aside off burner --- in the sauce portion, added two tsp of concentrated lemon juice, half brick cream cheese, one tbsp Mrs. Dash Original spice, 1/2 tsp lemon pepper, 1/2 cup lite mayo,+ 1/2 cup of flour, three cups of skim milk,should have used four- came out a little pasty --- put 1/2 cup parm in with sauce mixture, left out the sherry, cooked until creamy, added the  mushrooms, onion, butter, and shrimp mixture to the spaghtti, mixed it altogether with the sauce, put in lg corning dish, sprinkled top with parm cheese, then covered top with oyster crackers, then we had a pak of sharp chedder cheese, and that went on top of crackers, baked @ 350 degrees for 50 min. I defy anyone to say that this is a bland recipe. If you want to spice it up a little bit more, add extra Mrs. Dash. Should  be good with a diced chicken, turkey, potatos, vegies mix, too. Will try that next time. Our thanks to Christy J.    mudbug

kind of on the bland side... I used whole wheat flour & noodles since that was what I had, but I felt like the sauce could have used more flavor.

This was okay, more like between a 3 and a 4 star rating.  I used thawed cooked shrimp, but left the dish in the oven for 20 minutes only and that was enough time.  What I can't figure out is that I changed the recipe to serve two people, but somehow ended up getting enough to serve 4 to 6 people! I added red pepper flakes at the end which my husband didn't particularly like--he suggested to keep those in the recipe but to use fewer next time.  Yet another good "comfort food" type meal for the winter, but I wasn't terribly impressed.  I had meant to put in parsley for color and flavor, but forgot--this might have made a positive difference.

Easy, creamy, and delicious.  Almost comfort food.  Only addition was lots of freshly ground pepper.  Served with steamed sugar snap peas with lemon juice.  Will make again.

I made exactly as directed and added the cracked pepper.  I'm rating it with 5 stars, since my boyfriend said it was the best seafood pasta he's ever had.  It was definitely good.  I sprinkled garlic powder on a few bites out of curiosity and that wasn't bad either.  Maybe next time I'll crush a clove in with the onions.

This dish was one of the best made so far. We had friends over which one is generally very picky and he ate more that anyone. I also added a little craked peppercorn and a little more parm.cheese. I can't wait to make it with chicken.

This could really use some garlic and maybe a pinch of cayenne for a bit more flavor.  I cooked all on the stove top because I was concerned about over cooking the shrimp with time in the oven.

This was amazing and worth every dirty dish. Very rich and flavorful,  a nice twist on traditional chicken tetrazini.

This is very tasty recipe! I modified it as follows.
I added a 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese to the sauce.
Some of the reviewers said that the recipe is too bland, 
so I also added a 1/2 teaspoon of hot chili oil, a
teaspoon of sambal oelek, and a teaspoon of chopped 
garlic. I used a mixture of 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese 
and 1/2 cup of Italian bread crumbs for the topping.

I made it exactly like the recipe but added a little garlic.  My husband really really liked this.  This sauce I have never made or had before.  The key is not eating it too hot so the creamy simple sauce can be truly tasted.  I am really glad I made this.

It was good, bus could have had more sauce. It seemed to be missing something. It does look better than the picture.

I'm not huge on parmesean, so next time I'll take the advice of one of the other reviewers and use breadcrumbs, or some other topping.  Also, I did use a couple of other suggestions listed here, such as adding cream cheese to the sauce, and the addition of parsley and cracked black pepper. I think had I not used them, it wouldn't have affected anything too much, just a tad extra flavor and color.  This was a great recipe, overall. Not difficult to make, and doesn't require too many ingredients (in fact, you may have most of these ingredients lying around your kitchen). Five stars!

So good! Very easy to make and really yummy. I didn't have milk so I put some heavy cream instead, and I added an egg yolk just before putting the dish in the oven. I'll definitely do it again.

This was awesome!  Followed suggestions from other reviewers and added garlic (one clove minced to shrimp mixture and another to the sauce)as well as pepper.  I only had canned mushrooms, next time I will use fresh and I think it will make it even better.  Enjoy!

I am giving it a 3.5. It was a simple and good meal but I agree that you need to add a couple of things. I used wheat pasta, some parsely, lemon juice and garlic. I also cooked the onions and shrimp with some red pepper flakes. I would definatly make it again.

I knew my family was going to like this one, but they flipped over it. The only suggestion they made was to make it with penne pasta next time. That's just to make eating it easier.

This was a simple and delicious recipe.
I did make a couple small changes...
I left out the mushrooms and sherry (because I didn't have either).
I used a frozen onion and pepper veggie mix (because I didn't have fresh onions).
I also mixed the parmesan cheese in with the shrimp/pasta mixture, along with sprinkling it on top.

This recipe is GREAT!!! I didnt have mushrooms, so I used tomatoes instead, and it was amazing.  The color comes out beautiful too.

I like to add parsley and maybe a little garlic pepper to the cream sauce when Im cooking it to spice it up.

This recipe was excellent!  I used 16 oz. of shrimp instead of the 8 oz. recommended and I used more pasta.  Even so, there was enough sauce.  I also sprinkled buttered bread crumbs on the top before putting it in the oven, as another reviewer suggested and it added a nice crunchy contrast.

This recipe was not great and I even added cayenne pepper and pepper. with out that would have been EXTREMELY bland. I would not really recommend this recipe at all, there are MUCH better shrimp recipes out there. If you are in the mood for tetrazzini stick with chicken..

This was good, but I agree that it needs some spicing up.  I think I will try adding some of the things others' suggested and see if that helps.  It reminds me a little of an "alfredo" dish because it is so creamy, but a little of that taste can go a long way.  Overall I thought it was worth making again.

Sure, you may want to dial some flavor up but this is a great recipe, and I do it in one pot (plus casserole). Definitely double the shrimp. We also pat the shrimp dry and dust with Tony Cacherie's, which adds lots of pop. Then I even personally add Tobasco to my bowl, because I like it spicier than the rest of my krewe. But overall this is a simple, great recipe we love and have made dozens of times.

I made it almost as written, but didn't have mushrooms.  I substituted baby spinach so we'd have a bit of green in there.  My 13 year old liked it, and she's very picky.  I did add 2 cloves of garlic and some Old Bay as per other reviews, and used white wine instead of sherry.  I also added some grated parmesan into the sauce, and sprinkled some on top.  The shrimp may have been a bit overdone (not horrible, but they were right on the edge of getting rubbery) so next time I think I would saute shorter.

I would probably skip the last step as it came out a bit dry by baking in the oven - next time I would just toss the pasta in with the sauce and shrimp mixture and add the cheese at that point - I doubled the recipe and it was completely finished between 5 people, everyone enjoyed it!

The sherry and mayonaise were not enough to correct the fact that flour + milk = gravy. Very bland.

I added shredded cheese to the dish and some the top and my family absolutely loved it. Also, when mixing the milk/mayo  mixture, i added some seasonings to taste of my own.  It was great......

Made this for Christmas. Was great! Even my brother who hated shrimp loved the noodles. I doubled the recipie and substituted on a 1:1 ratio of vinegar and sugar. Took out the mushrooms and substituted rotini for the pasta.

I felt like this dish was lacking in flavor. I added more salt throughout the process, but when the dish was finished, it was just.... meh.  I've tried other tetrazzini recipes and will use those instead.

This was pretty good I think I would have liked it better with more sauce once I baked it, all of the sauce dried right up. All in all it was okay, my boyfriend liked it so...

My daughter and I both give it a 4, but I have to say it is true that you need to add just a bit more seasoning.  I did add some garlic salt and blk pepper but everything else was done the same as recipe.  Very tasty and creamy.  I loved the taste of the sherry that was in it.  Next time I might double the shrimp and add some minced garlic to the mushroom mix and some blk pepper again.  I know a lot of people talked about added red pepper flakes or old bay but we both think it might take away from the nice sherry taste, so we won't do that.   I will make it again!

Our family loved this - just the way it is. I did add some garlic and pepper. I didn't have time to bake it, so we just used it as a sauce over the pasta and it was delicious.

Oh My gosh!!!!!!!!
This is the best recipe ever. Made a double batch for the family, there was absolutely NO leftovers. The only addition I made was the black pepper also. Other than that this recipe is PERFECT!!!
