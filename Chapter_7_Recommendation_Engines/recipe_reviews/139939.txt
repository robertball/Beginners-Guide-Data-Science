Great recipe with lots of flavor! I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil since its better for you. I think I would cut back on the onion just a little if you don't like having that onion taste in your mouth an hour later. I did not have time to put my dressing in the refrigerator for an hour so I blended it with my hand held blender. This gave it a smooth frothy look and might explain why mine tasted so oniony. Anyway great recipe!

I didn't want pieces of the onion in my dressing, so I pulsed everything EXCEPT the oil in the blender.  After it was smooth, I streamed in the oil through the top with the blender running.  I did adjust the flavor by adding a bit more ketchup and worcestershire to suit our tastes.   Perfect consistency for a salad dressing.

I think the recipe is great as it is however just to let you know that I made the following changes because I had to and it still turned out great. I used brown sugar instead of white and it worked well with the apple cider vinegar. I didn't have an onion so I had to omit it but it was still good. I used a combination of mostly olive oil some vegetable oil and a dash of roasted garlic oil. This is a very versatile recipe. Thanks for sharing.

Just finished it. It was super quick and easy. I omitted the onion and increased the Worcestershire because I like a little twang. I'll be doing this again!

I made it as the recipe stated but I used coconut oil because I was out of olive oil. My husband loved it! I felt it was alittle to sweet but that is just personal preference.

This dressing is fabulous! Super easy to make and full of flavor it's healthier than store bought dressing. I used olive oil and only 1/2 cup onion because I am not a big onion fan. My family loves it!

Delicious! My husband and I loved this! I followed the suggestion in one review to blend all ingredients except the oil until smooth and then add the oil and blend lightly to combine. Kept all ingredients as written. We'll keep using this - thank you!

I love the taste but I feel it has too much onion. Next time I make this I am cutting back on the onion and puree it more so there are no onion pieces in the dressing.

I make this dressing for my Asian chicken salad. I use brown sugar instead of white and red wine vinegar instead of Apple cider vinegar. Salad with teriyaki grilled chicken iceberg lettuce finely chopped purple onion dry ramen noodle (finely broken up) and sunflower seeds.

After using the original recipe I ended up using 1 1/2 Tablespoons of Worchestershire sauce and no onions because my husband doesn't like onions but he loved this dressing!

This was delicious! I read through reviews before I made it. I used brown sugar as someone else had suggested. I added a bit of garlic and S&P. Ran the whole thing through the food processor to pulverize the onion.
