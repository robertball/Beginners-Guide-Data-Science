This was a hit in our house! I did the same as the other reviewer - substituted cream of mushroom soup (had on hand), plus added sauteed mushrooms.  Also used whole wheat spiral pasta instead of white.  It turned out great.  Hubby had 3 servings!

This is a good 'foundation' recipe, easy and delicious.  I substituted cream of mushroom soup for asparagus and added some lightly sauteed fresh mushrooms to add taste and interest.  Top with chopped browned almonds or crushed potato chips if you want to be really retro.

I halved the recipe, I used only one can of Mushroom soup and a 10 0z can of chicken, I added some mushroom with the asparagus and sautéed instead of cooking in water, we liked it and will make again

Had both cream of mushroom/chicken but no asparagus soup so added one of each.  I felt three cans was unnecessary.   Added sauteed  mushrooms.  Shredded cheddar on top and excellent!

This was delicious!  The recipe calls for three cans of soup, but it is very good and not so soupy with two.  Also, shredded Parmesan cheese can be substituted for the cheddar/jack.  Everyone loved it.

This was very good!  The whole family liked it.  I would make this again.  I know some were concerned about the casserole being too "soupy", but I used three cans of soup anyway. Mine did not turn out "soupy", but creamy.  I used a cookie sheet under the 9x13 dish in case of overflow since my dish was very full, but I wouldn't have needed to do that.  Thank you for a great recipe!

I followed the recipe as close as I could. my grocery store didn't have cream of asparagus so I used a cream of chicken and a cream of mushroom as suggested by a reviewer. I also sautéed my asparagus with salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder. I  had to keep hubby from snagging pieces while I prepped the rest! I added some salt to the water boiling with the pasta as well since I noticed there was no seasonings listed.  It was good, not amazing or anything. Still a little bland. Ok for a Monday night but probably won't make again unless hubby requests. (He put some croutons on top of his)

It was good, but bland.  The ingredient list doesn't call for any seasonings at all, so you know up front you need to add stuff.  I used mushrooms, garlic, onions, a little red bell pepper, salt and pepper.  It still wasn't enough.  If I make it again, I'll know to include even more of these ingredients.  Also, after breaking off the hard bottoms of the asparagus, there really wasn't enough of it left.  I will use 2 lbs next time.

This is such a quick and easy meal to make!! My boyfriend and I were in love! I made a few changes though :) I added 1 can of cream of chicken, then 1 can of cream of asparagus! I also added crushed LAYS potato chips ontop of the cheese for a little added crunch and flavor!! Again, this dish was awesome!

I didn't have any cream of asparagus soup so I used a can of cheddar soup and cream of broccoli soup. I also added some chopped up tomatoes! I also didn't have enough farfalle pasta so I used rotini.

Every one loved it, I put one can of cream of potatoes to substitute for one of the asparagus cans,  husband said this is something you would find at a restaurant.
