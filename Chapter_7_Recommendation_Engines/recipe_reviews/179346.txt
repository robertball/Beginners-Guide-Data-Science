Absolutely delicious!!! They melt in your mouth. Better than Red Lobster! Changes that I made: Add extra cheese, 1/3 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 C. chopped white onions and a dash of Old Bay Seasoning (found near seafood- not in spice isle) in with the batter. Double the recipe for 4 people. Use a little garlic powder and minced garlic w/butter. I can't wait to make it again!

This is a really fast and easy recipe.   These are the changes I made:  I increased the amount of cheese to 1 cup, and put the garlic powder in the batter.  For the topping I used equal amounts of real butter and margarine, 1/4 tsp. parsley, and about 1/8 tsp of garlic salt.  Also, my family really likes the garlic flavor so I added one clove of fresh minced garlic to the mix (I use a garlic press).  Also, instead of brushing the butter mixture on at the end I decided to do it while they were cooking to get better flavor... I brushed once after cooking for about 5 minutes and then again when they were almost done. It gave them a nice golden color and the flavor was amazing.  If you are looking for something close to Red Lobster this is definitely the way to go.

This is a good building block recipe. I was looking for a tasty biscuit recipe using Bisquick. Unfortunately, I had run out of cheese and had about 1 pat of butter left. So, scouring my cupboards, I found a packet of chicken flavor ramen seasoning. I added that packet to the biscuit mixture, baked as directed. When out of the oven, I put slivers of butter on top to melt (omitting the garlic powder). Really quite good. I did not miss the cheese at all. I will experiment with this recipe.

These are very close in taste to the Red Lobster biscuits but I wonder how Red Lobster keeps them from drying out.  These are definitely only good right out of the oven.  They do not taste good reheated.

This recipe is so easy to make. THe biscuits come out so delicious.  I added a spoonful of honey and that gave the biscuits such a nice sweetness.

Enjoyed them as was written but will agree with other reviewers,will try adding garlic powder to the batter and more cheese. Will make again with a few additions, I liked the suggestion of adding Old Bay Seasoning.

These were really delicious.  I did as suggested by other reviewers and added more cheese.  I did find that I had to cook them considerably longer than the recipe suggested (by about 5 minutes) but no big deal.  Could have been my oven

Very bland as written.  Not enough flavor and they were pretty dry.  Definitely add more garlic and potentially more spices.  And add butter to the mix before baking.  The biscuits looked pretty,  but were not really worth eating 2. Kinda use to push food in spoon and bite.  They were easy to make. I wouldn't make them again as written.  Missing a lot.

I made it exactly according to the recipe...did not deviate at all!  These were super easy and tasty.  I personally couldn't taste the cheese in them but my picky toddler ate them so these are a total win to me!  :)

i made a huge batch of these for a party that i served pasta at and they were a hit! the only thing i added was some garlic powder to the batter and did half and half garlic powder and garlic salt to the melted butter portion. they were very easy to make and taste way better than Red Lobster's rolls.

If you use club soda instead of milk for these biscuits it makes them lighter.  Also, a few dried parsley flakes sprinkled over the garlic butter doesn't affect the flavor and will help to eliminate "garlic breath."

I use granulated garlic (added directly into the raw dough) and a sharp cheddar cheese. I also like to add dill weed to the mix, either fresh or dried. If I have buttermilk on hand I will substitute some or all of the milk for extra tang.

These biscuits were not up to Onion John standards! According to Onion John, these biscuits do not have the required ingredients of 4 tablespoons of butter and 1/2 a teaspoon of garlic powder. I am very disappointed of whoever wrote this article. Onion John would be disappointed!

Just came across this recipe this morning as a tag to an email.  Such an easy recipe.  Halved the biscuit mix and used a Mexican style blend cheese since I didn't have Cheddar alone.  Made 5 large and 1 med. biscuits.  Made the full amount of butter/garlic topping and used all of it on the 6 biscuits.  Tasted great and took about five minutes to put together.
