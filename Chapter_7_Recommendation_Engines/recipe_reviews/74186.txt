I made this dip for a party and was a bit unsure aobut the soy sauce. I did it using some frozen shredded zucchini and followed the directions exactly.  Boy was it good.  It really seasons up with a few hours in the fridge and everyone asked what kind it was.  I left my zucchini with the peel on (it was shredded) and the color added to the spice!
Definately a winner! Thank you for the reciepe.

Four stars for a great idea!  I loved it with some modifications.  I made it like I make my artichoke dip.  First, I like the zucchini peeled for a nicer color/appearance.  Second, sugar and soy sauce sounded bad, and I left those out.  Then I added lots more garlic, a lot of finely-grated Asiago cheese, and a little S&P.  The dried oregano is a good addition.  Awesomely delicious this way!  Yum.  Good with vegies or on Italian bread.

Very good recipe for dipping bread. Goes well with stew. Family said this dip "rocks". I used minced garlic in place of fresh garlic chopped. Worked just as well. This recipe has a sweet taste which complements bread and meat dishes.

OMG! so good!  We followed the recipe except for we doubled the zucchini (had a lot to get rid off) and added extra garlic for extra zing.  This stuff goes wonderfully with pita chips!  Made for our 4th of july party tonight and I cant stop eating it!  Do not be afraid of the soy sauce and sugar...this recipe is great as is.  I would probably say if you like the garlic taste, definitely add a lot more as it really makes this dip taste great.

This was very good dip! I made zucchini Fritters from this site and used this dip to dip them in. It was also good with our chicken tenders.

I've brought this dip to quite a few parties and everyone loves it.  It's a very mild flavored dip and although I thought the ingredients would be strange together, they work great.  Thanks for the recipe!

I did not find this recipe that great. It was a bit too sweet and seemed to lack a bit of zest. I threw mine away.

Wow, this dip is superb!  I wasn't sure how we would like the recipe so I halved it.  No worries there - I'm having a hard time waiting for it to finish chilling in the fridge!  I used a little more garlic and a little less mayo than the recipe called for and also used honey in place of the sugar (personal preference).  Thanks for a great recipe, Betty.

This is a family favorite now! This is REALLY good.. I made it with Zucchini the first time and we loved it and then I made it with Summer squash the second time. Both were great!

I think it was the mayo and oregano that spoiled it for me. I had to doctor it up with sour cream, more garlic, onion powder and a touch of hot sauce and it was still so-so. Had lots of left-overs and it went in the trash. I won't be making this one again.

I thought this dip was very, very sweet and didn't like it at all.  I added about 1/4 cup lemon juice to tone down the sweetness.  I might try it again and use 1 cup of sour cream and once cup of salad dressing just because I am desperate to use up zucchini!

I can't believe what a great combination these flavors are!  I did need to drain off the excess liquid after I processed the main ingredients before adding the mayo.  It was my Monday Night Football success story for 2010.  Oh, and I did  triple everything EXCEPT the mayo (because I have 20-25 people at MNG) I used 2 1/2 to 3 cups of Mayo total. I'll be taking this on our houseboat and NASCAR trips.  Thank you SO much BettyBillings, where ever you are........

Absolutely Outstanding!  My whole family loved it!  Side note.   I ran out of Zucchini and made it with Cucumbers, and it was still amazing.    Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

Not sure what I did, but I wasn't happy with this.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Smelled and tasted strongly of the soy sauce and the mayo.

This is very, very good.  Reminds me of taziki sauce.  Excellent dip.  Thickens as it rests.  Do not hesitate with the fresh Gaelic.

I made this recipe.  It tastes great.  I made it with fresh oregano from my garden.  However,  It is very runny and I am not sure how to thicken it up.  I tried adding more zucchini but that did not work.  I chilled it over night in the fridge.  Any suggestions?

I certainly suggest using more seasoining and fresh spices rather than dried.
