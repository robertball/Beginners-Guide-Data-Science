We've been making this for years, and love this recipe! We leave off the butter, and it does not affect the taste. I also add 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder and 1/2 of onion powder. The recipe doesn't specify this, but the sour cream should be 8 oz.

A store-bought rotisserie chicken works wonderfully well in this recipe too.  GREAT flavor & saves time.

This dish always turns out wonderful! We like to add frozen vegatables to the mix. Just enough so that the sauce still covers everything when you put it in the pan. Smells so good--my husband loves this one!

Definately a keeper!  It almost tasted like pot pie.  I used fat free sour cream and added frozen broccoli, garlic powder, and a little pepper.  Also, I just boiled the chicken.  Thanks!

I changed this quite a bit because I wasn't sure how it would taste without adding a little more flavor.  I added some milk and wine to the sauce... sauteed the chicken breasts with onions, celery, garlic, and mushrooms (then added them to the sauce)...added some salt and pepper...used garlic ritz crackers, etc.  All in all, it was pretty good, and easy....after all, it is canned soup. :)  Thanks.

This is a favorite in our family.  I have made it numerous times, always with superb results.  The crunchy poppy seeds and the cracker topping make this a real winner.  So easy and so good!

The calories are from the soup... but you can get 98% Fat Free cream of whatever soups, and that really helps to cut down the cals... :)  

Very yummy!

This is really good and easy.  My husband & daughter request it quite often.  I follow the recipe exactly.  I do season the chicken with salt & pepper.

Although this recipe was alright, it really wasn't very good... it could have used HALF the crackers on top. They overpowered everything else, and it ended up being really dry tasting. I use to have the best poppy seed chicken recipe, but I don't know what I did with it! Guess I'll just keep looking :)

YUM! The only thing i really changed was adding the poppyseeds to the chicken mixture and i used a roaster chicken instead so i didnt cook the meat in a skillet. I like to freeze it then without the crumbs and just add them when im ready to put it in the oven and bake..:)

I've been making this recipe for years...it's a family favorite.  The only thing that I do different is use only cream of chicken soup.  I'll have to try it with the combination of chicken and mushroom soups.  In order to make it healthier, I only use 98% fat free soup, light sour cream, and I always serve it over rice mixed with broccoli or spinach.

This is a family favorite.  It is NOT bland and you have to use real butter for the crackers to give it a rich flavor.  You should NEVER put it on broccoli, YUCK! The best way to serve this is mix it with 1 box of bowtie pasta boiled in the chicken broth left over from cooking the chicken.  Adding some extra chicken broth and it will make it even creamier.  This is not a recipe for people counting calories, so don't substitute the real thing for a low calorie version or it will taste bad.

I've been making this for several years now, and we love it. The only problem is, it's a lot of high-fat ingredients without a lot of substance! Inside it's basically just chicken and sauce. I tried adding mixed veggies, and wasn't a big fan of that. Another reviewer mentioned adding broccoli - perfect!! I will definitely be trying it. I've also added crackers inside the casserole as well, which helps thicken it up some. And I usually use chicken from a roaster that I've cooked in the crock pot - so little work, and I can get two or three meals out of it!

I also have made this for years. You can make it lower in fat by cooking chicken in boiling water for 2 minutes to take the pink out, using low fat soup-I use only chicken soup, and light sour cream,and decreasing the butter by half. It still comes out perfect every time.  The real secret of this recipe is to use steamed sticky rice or called sushi rice.

This is one of my kids favorite chicken casserole.  It's easy to put together especially if you keep frozen chopped chicken around.  To lower the fat content, use low fat sour cream and soup.

I love this casserole! It's one of my favorites, and it's very kid friendly as well. I often omit the poppy seeds and it's just as good.

Love the topping, found the sauce to be bland the way the typical canned soup sauces tend to be.  Next time I will increase the sauce by 50% and add sliced fresh mushrooms, diced celery, some sherry or Worcestershire sauce and some diced pimentos for a little color.

I've been making poppy seed chicken for years, and guests and family always love it. I do boil the chicken, with garlic cloves, and add minced garlic to the sauce for extra flavor; and I put the poppy seeds in the sauce rather than the cracker topping. My favorite comment came from a young 20-something man who worked for us one summer. Eating his first helping, he said, "I can't wait for seconds!"

I make a dish similar to this, but I put the poppy seeds in with the chicken mixture and only use a can of cream of chicken soup with the sour cream.  I always use bone in chicken breasts because they have more flavor, boil them then dice the chicken.  If taken to a potluck I double it and put in a 9x13 and always come home with an empty dish.

A sweet lady from Georgia made this for me and my son about 10 years ago. It is still one of his favorites! We all love it. We boil our chicken breast but that is all we do differently. It's still good without the poppy seeds, but pretty with them.

My husband has requested this for both Father's Day and his Birthday dinners. I rarely have leftovers and it's only two of us eating! I did change the Cream of Mushroom to Cream of Broccoli only because I didn't have the mushroom.  Also added cheese under the cracker layer.  Hubby loves cheese!

This recipie was so well received.  The chicken turned out moist and the topping browned to perfection.  The addition of poppy seeds made it interesting.  Really great with a side of green veggies and brown rice.

I really liked this dish. It was simple and delicious. I didn't have chicken breasts, so I used thighs. I didn't have cream of chicken (thought I bought it but it was cream of celery instead) and it still tasted great. Thanks for this recipe!

I made this same recipe with left over baked chicken, just lower the oven temp. I also crumble the crackers over the top and drizzle with the butter (please do not use margarine, its always better with butter). If you don't have mushroom soup, just double the chicken soup. Delicious!

Recipe was wonderful... my only issue was, in the version I recorded, it's called a "one-dish" meal... but there was a skillet, baking dish, and microwave bowl...

This is an awesome and easy recipe that I have made many times for different people and everyone always enjoys it.  To save on prep time, I sometimes use a store-bought rotisserie chicken and I put the casserole together ahead of time, adding the crackers right before baking.  Delicious!

I really liked it! Added garlic salt, salt, pepper, and put way more poppy seeds than called for and it was really tasty. Think it would be bland without the added spices.

I have made this over the years but have never used the cream of mushroom soup. I have used canned chicken though. Using light sour cream does not affect the taste. My son does not like casserole type dishes but loves this dish!

My husband and I really loved this recipe. I used only cream of chicken soup because my husband doesn't like mushrooms. I used country crock margarine/butter and it did fine. Also used reduced fat sour cream. The Ritz crackers made a nice crunchiness.  Will make again and soon!

My family loves this dish. I boil the chicken for a slightly healthier version but it still has a wonderful flavor. I also add 1 tsp poppy seeds to the chicken mixture. Wonderful!

this recipe was good.I used about a pound of chicken breast tenders,cut the chicken into bite size pieces and then cooked with cooking spray instead of oil.I used only one can of cream of chicken and added 1/2 cup of skim milk instead of sour cream.I also added a tsp of black pepper and a couple of tbsp of dried minced onion.I put the crushed cracker crumbs on top then sprinkled seeds on top and drizzled butter.It was a hit!

This was really good and easy. I used the garlic cream of mushroom soup for the regular and added some chopped onions to the soup mixture. Since it is hard to get the boys in my house to eat vegetables, I add them to casseroles.  So I added fresh broccolli to the bottom of my dish and then poured eveything on top. I also used garlic flavored Ritz crackers. My guys ate the whole thing and asked me to make it again.

This is the first recipe for allrecipes.com that we have not liked.  It is soooo bland.  Wish I had read more of the reviews before I served this to my family.  How can people like this?  It certainly needs onion, celery, garlic, wine, and some color, probably from a vegetable.

This is a good base recipe and after making it this way I added 1 tsp Garlic, Frozen Corn, and Green Beans (1/2 bag each) to the mix and I then laid the mix on a bed of cooked Basmati Rice. The base recipe is good and with a few twists is even better! Make your own recipes, the kind I like!

Great comfort food on a cold, rainy day!  I used cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic, added some onion powder and I halved the amount of butter mixed with the crushed crackers.  I served this with egg noodles and my kids scarfed it right up.

This is one of family favorites as well.  I recently experimented and made Rice-a-Roni (chicken) and layered that on the bottom, then did the rest of the recipe.  With a salad, it was a meal.

We really liked this.  I changed it just a bit.  I used cream of celery insead of cream of mushroom.  I boiled chicken, deboned, cooked rice (1 cup) in the stock and then mixed all ingredients together.  I also added some salt, garlic salt, and onion powder (it may have been a little bland without). I just kept tasting it until it was right.  My husband liked it very much.  It's nice because I doubled the recipe and froze one for later.

This might sound like the strangest 5 star review. My husband doesn’t like half the ingredients. Which means more for me! I love it. This is such a tasty recipe. Wouldn’t change a thing in it. Shared some with two other family members who couldn’t get enough of it. Gave them the recipe. Yummmm!

I made this for the first time and I love it! Some changes I made: 2 lbs of chicken seasoned with garlic powder and seasoned salt. Also used Kraft's "Oven Fry Seasoned Coating Mix, Extra Crispy Chicken" instead of recommended crumbs. Next time I'll experiment with the soup to sour cream ratio.. I might also copy my favorite take-out and add cooked rice as the first layer.

I have been making this dish for years.  This one was a little different and WOW what a difference.  I loved it!  This one has shredded cheddar and one less can of condensed soup than what I'm used to.  This is my new go-to favorite Poppyseed Chicken recipe.  My only changes were minor.......I cooked my chicken in butter and used Cream of Celery soup.  I served it over wild rice and drizzled a little Crystal hot sauce on top.  Yummy :)

Made as written.  It was rather bland but a decent start.  I will try it again but tweak it quite a bit next time.

Love it! So filling!  I didn't have chicken breasts on hand so I used canned chicken instead.  Even better the next day!  Thanks for sharing!

Everyone loved this recipe, I may have to try it again to see if cream of celery makes it even better.  Thanks for the recipe!
