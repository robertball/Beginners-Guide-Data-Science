So, so freaking awesome.   Why didn't I ever do this before?
Made it the first time as written...yum.
Made it again with raspberries... super yum.
Oops, I did it again, but with blueberries  and  lemon cream cheese sauce...OMG.  So. Good.
Food of gods.

Excellent. The cream cheese adds the extra touch to make it excellent. I lined a cast iron pan with foil and put a lid on it. I cooked on the upper she'll of the cool side of the grill and it was perfect.

Excellent recipe, curious as to whether or not it can be cooked in the oven and if so would that also be about 15 min at 350 degrees??
