I chose this recipe to add more green food to my diet. I was not sure about this soup, while I was making it I realized it may seem plain with flavor. However, when I ate it, it was so good! This also makes for a huge serving, so I can eat it for a couple of days.  I ran out of the vegetable broth and had to use two cups beef broth and added a little bit of salt. Wondering if I even needed to now. It was also fun learning to cook with the vegetables that I had cooked with before.

It did not taste good. I found that it lacked flavor and could’ve used some salt. I had to put it on rice because I had to eat it, even thought I didn’t like it. It needs more seasoning because it just tastes like vegetable flavored water.
