This recipes is totally yummy! The flavor of the herbs in this dish is spot on. Made for a great, late night fast dish when you have the munchies. And trust, it was totally filling.

Hillshire Red Beans & Rice Haiku: "It's quick and easy, but the taste was just alright. Glad to have tried it!" Unlike some sponsored recipes where I use different brands here or there, I did have Hillshire smoked sausage (which I do like), and w/o it, this recipe would've been really /yawn. I browned the sausage longer than 5-6 min (b4 adding the other veggies) b/c we like it brown and crispy. We definitely had to add more hot sauce when I served it, along w/ salt too, b/c it wasn't all that flavorful. I would've added at least 1 tsp. of Cajun seasoning while it was "thickening" (which incidentally, it never did - it remained watery, but at least the rice we poured it over absorbed all the liquid) had I thought that it wouldn't be great as-is.

This was good but needed a great deal more pizzazz for us.

It was very good - added Old Bay seasoning and tomato paste then added the cooked rice to the whole thing in a big bowl so people could scoop it  out.  Made this the side dish to jerk chicken - lots of spice and hot sauce.  Leftovers made with  the jerk chicken mixed in with it and a side salad.

This was delicious!  I used local kielbasa and added much more spice (We like it zippy!)  Added 1/2 can of fire roasted tomatoes and a bit of cumin plus extra garlic.  I let it simmer a bit to thicken up and served over garlic rice!  Super easy and quick meal for the weeknight!

Tried it with pinto beans. I needed to soak them longer. Otherwise it had a lot of flavor. I’m definitely making it again.

It wasn’t favorable enough for us so I added a can of puréed Rotel tomatoes with green chilis - Will definitely make again with this addition.  Also recommend garlic salt.

I made as directed but rounded the tsp of each spice and added 3/4 tsp cumin and a tsp of cajun seasoning because we like our food to bite back. It thickened up, but that's because I let it simmer with the lid off for longer than the recipe called for. It doesn't hurt the ingredients to do so and gives the seasonings time to blend. I had 1 can of kidney beans so I substituted in 1 can of black beans, and also used 1/2 pound of sausage for personal preference, cutting each slice in half. It was delicious!

I had to make a couple substitutions because I didn't have a green pepper or an onion, but I did have a frozen bag of sliced green peppers, red peppers and onion( I threw them in a colander and rain some water over them to quickly defrost) I also didn't have hot sauce but I had read another review and they used Cajun seasoning! I put in a half a teaspoon.  This was very yummy and I will definitely make it again! Husband loved it too! Also the sauce never thickened for me but it was over rice so it was fine! ( when I reheated leftovers I just added more chicken broth-my husband likes stuff saucey so this worked out well!!)

The only changes I made was one can of pinto beans , because I had only one can of red beans.  The other change was one teaspoon of cajun seasoning in lieu of the seasoning called for.  It was a good, quick meal.  I will definitely make again.  Thank You Hillshire.

The only changes I made was to add more celery since we like it and use yellow pepper since it is mild.

This one is a keeper! Followed the recipe almost exactly. I have a small garden out back and only had one small Bell pepper, so I added a Sandia and Havasu pepper with the Bell. I also make my own homemade hot sauce (from one of the recipes on this site), and that's what I used for the hot pepper sauce. The wife loved it and I loved it! Will be making it again soon.

Big hit at our house! Left out the thyme and parsley, but we didn't miss it! Very filling.

It was just ok. It never thickened, so it was runny. My family doesn't want me to make it again.
