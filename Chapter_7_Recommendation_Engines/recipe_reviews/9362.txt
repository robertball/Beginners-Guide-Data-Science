I have an 1100 watt microwave and following Linda's recipe my brittle burned after adding the nuts.   I tried it again lowering the time and this is what worked for me.     2 1/2 minutes for the sugar and corn syrup, add the nuts and cook for 2 more minutes, add the vanilla and butter and 1 1/2 minutes more.    I only did the 1 1/2 at the end for my husband because he likes it almost brown.   I prefer it at 1 minute instead and it is gold like the photo on the original.  I liked the hint posted about spraying the pouring edge of the pyrex bowl and also the wooden spoon with Pam and I used parchment paper to line the cookie sheet.   You can re-use that several times and the brittle is not greasy. I also only put in 1 cup of nuts instead of 1 1/2.

My wife and I have made two batches of this, and they both came out perfect! Guess what everyone's getting a tin of this Christmas? : ) Oh, one more thing. We've been making it in one of those glass 4-cup measuring cups. You know, the clear ones with a handle. They work great for handling it and pouring the mixture on the cookie sheet. You can get them at Wal-Mart for about 4 bucks. Oh well, that's all for now. Thanks a bunch for the recipe!

This recipe was great.  Like others, I was grateful not to have to be stirring and stirring this on the stove!!!  I had to try this a few times before it turned out.  The first time it burned a little.  Wanted to pass along what I did just in case it helps others.  I live in Colorado - so high altitude might have affected this a little.  I also have a 900 watt microwave.  I cooked the sugar and syrup for 6 minutes.  Then added the peanuts, salt, butter and vanilla.  Cooked for 2 1/2 more minutes.  Then added the soda.  For those of you who like thinner brittle, here is a tip.  Put your cookie sheet (sprayed with Pam) in the oven at 200 degrees for a few minutes while the brittle is cooking.  Then remove the cookie sheet when the brittle is done.  With the warm pan, it allows you more time to spread it out - as thick or thin as you like.

I have made (no exaggerating) dozens of batches-it makes a great gift! I use a 9.5 oz can of Planters lightly salted cashews.  Here's what I have found to be helpful: I reduced the baking soda to 1/2-3/4t. baking soda (I could taste the soda-yuck), and I add the nuts after the mixture starts to turn slightly brown (about 4 min. in my microwave).  The mixture stiffens up some, but will then soften when you cook it again-that way, the nuts don't burn at all. Keep adjusting the times for your microwave-it's worth it! Add Tip:  to thin/spread out the brittle, try using forks to "pull out" the candy along w/ heating your cookie sheet.

This was GREAT! 
Tips: For some reason, the batch always turned out better when I lined the cookie sheet with aluminum foil - chemical reaction w/the baking soda maybe? 
Also, plan to waste at least one batch, because there is one unknown in this recipe: your microwave. I had to tinker until I got the timing of everything right. Once I did it was like clockwork! I made 6 batches of this in 2 and a half hours! Not bad, considering I didn't have to break an arm stirring the whole time! And it really does taste *exactly* the same as the stuff done the hard way!
After the first 2 batches, I just started leaving out the vanilla. You can't really taste it and it's not worth the extra cost IMO. Overall an incredibly easy, fast, fun recipe!

This recipe is good! It's way better than average, but in nmy opinion, needs more salt. Here are some tips for the people who keep burning the recipe, who can't get their mixture to firm up, or for those who, for the life of them, can't find corn syrup. 
A) If you are having trouble with BURNING or you keep getting a BURNT taste, make sure that you're using RAW nuts, and not roasted ones. Mix everything together before putting it into the microwave. Also, keep a close eye on the mixture. Don't go away from your microwave. a) If you have ROASTED NUTS, try putting them in when add the butter instead of putting them in at first. This will reduce flavor transfer, but at least you won't have "burnt nut" aftertaste as your flavor!
B) If you HAVE NO CORN SYRUP, use .75 honey and .25 water. This gives a different flavor, too, some might say it tastes a bit more "old-fashioned". (? You decide!) 
C) Finally, if you are having trouble getting your recipe to harden: 
1) Make sure you microwave the mixture on HIGH with a MICROWAVE. When you add the butter and vanilla, check for soft-ball stage...after waving your "spatula" in the air for 2 secs, you should have a firm "glob" that kind-of holds it shape sitting on your utensil. 
2) Use the right amount of butter 
3) Don't keep taking the mixture of the microwave to "check it." It has to stay hot to cook!

I have been using this recipe for many years and it always comes out perfectly.  The glass 4 cup measuring cup is a real key for ease in making this recipe.  The original recipe I use calls for a can of cashew pieces and this makes a fantastic brittle!  Everyone I give it to wants the recipe.  I also experimented this year with topping the brittle with a thin layer of chocolate.  Yum!  Let the brittle firm up a bit, but while it is still very warm sprinkle some semi-sweet or milk chocolate morsels on top and the chocolate will start melting almost immediately.  Just spread with a knife or utility spatula and let cool.  I usually do half of my batch with chocolate and half without.  This recipe is a winner for gifts for friends and neighbors, and it is extremely quick and easy.

I used a microwave peanut brittle recipe for years, then lost it. This seemed like the closest to my old recipe and luckily it turned out just as good. I've made numerous batches this last week. I find it works fine using salted nuts. In fact, I buy the large container of fancy nuts from Costco and it makes wonderful brittle. My absolutely favorite thing to add is the shaved coconut strips which you can find at places like Trader Joe's, and some of the catalog companies. (Regular flake coconut will burn too easily.) Last night I made a coconut and almond combination which was out of this world. My microwave oven is 1000 watts, instead of the 700 watts this recipe is written for. So I use 5 min. for the first cooking, and 1 min 45 sec for the second cooking. For those who complain that it comes out chewey rather than brittle, it's because it hasn't been cooked enough. This recipe is so quick and easy.

This is the only Peanut Brittle recipe I'll use. =) Always turns out good - to avoid the chewies, just keep a glass of cold water on hand - don't add the baking soda untill a little bit of the brittle-part makes a hard ball and cracks in the water. Then you won't be foiled by different microwave powers, and'll have a better idea of how long to zap it next time.

The perfect brittle recipe.  I made 10 batches last night to give as gifts.  Try with cashews, very delicious, but the cashews brown faster. 

Helpful hint: boil water while cooking the brittle.  Pour the boiling water into the empty bowl as soon as you are done with it and cleanup is easy!

I have been making a similar recipe for years.  I make a ten minute (or so) brittle putting the nuts in at the five minute point, then add the butter, vanilla, and soda at the end.  I followed this recipe putting the butter and vanilla in at the earlier interval and was not so happy with the results.  I think I will stick with my recipe.  I also put in more baking soda which all of my elderly relatives prefer as they say it makes the candy easier on their teeth!  I out in 1 1/2 t of baking soda and it makes the candy really airy...also I live at 5500 feet which may also have something to do with it... ;-)

I made this into cashew brittle. EXCELLENT! Perfect flavor and "brittleness." Now for the big substitution I made - I was all ready to make this today and found, much to my annoyance, I had no corn syrup in the pantry. Fortunately, it was just a tiny bump in the candy-making road. In a small saucepan, I combined 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup water. Brought it to a boil (without stirring) and boiled it 3 minutes. This is a good trick to remember anytime you need corn syrup - this is way cheaper and works identically in any recipe.  Also good for when someone in the family has a corn allergy. I did cut back the soda to 1/2 tsp and I could still just barely taste it - certainly not enough to ruin it. My palate works on overdrive. I nuked the syrup/sugar mixture 5-1/2 minutes, added the cashews, butter and vanilla for another 2 minutes (since cashews are more delicate than peanuts and therefore burn far more easily,)  removed and stirred in the soda,mixed it well, and presto! It could not have possibly turned out better had I toiled over a hot stove for a half hour. I would have never believed you could make such great brittle in a microwave. (Don't you wonder how anyone figured that fact out?! I mean, really. Did she/he just wake up one morning and say, "I'm going to try to make brittle in the microwave instead of on the stove"??) As a professional chef, I tend to be a purist about cooking methods, and even so, this made a believer out of even skeptical me! Phenomenal recipe - thank y

God Bless you for this recipe!  I started making brittle last year around the holidays with a Martha Stewart recipe.  It was great when it turned out, but that was only about 50% of the time.  Still no clue what the magic catalyst was but thankfully will not have to worry about it anymore.  Just finished making my first batch and although it's not done setting it looks perfect.  I found this recipe in desperation after my big mouth volunteered to make brittle to sell at my daughter's school's fall fundraiser.  You have seriously saved my sanity!  My few tips - I have a 1000 W microwave and I did 6 minutes then 2 minutes.  I also used a large Pyrex measuring bowl for pouring ease.  I sprayed Pam on wooden spoons and lined a baking sheet with aluminum fool, sprayed it with Pam and kept it warm in the oven at 200 degrees until it was time to pour the brittle.  Pull the aluminum foil off the baking sheet after about 5 minutes.  The heat from the baking sheet will slow down the hardening process.  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!

here's my rough calculation: 700W - 10 minutes total cook time ~ 800W - 9min ~ 900W - 8min ~ 1000W - 7min ~ 1100W - 6min ~ just adjust the steps accordingly, it's really that simple.  the only change I made was used 1c peanuts, don't know how more would have worked because mine was plenty peanut-y.  I have to use a nonstick-sprayed spatula to spread the mixture quick before it cooled.  I dump it onto a piece of parchment paper that I just lay straight on the counter so I didn't even have to pull out a cookie sheet.  so easy!

i LOVE this recipe!!! This was my first time attempting to make any kind of candy and it turned out great (my friends couldn't believe I made it)! I found that reading the reviews really helped. I used mixed nuts instead of peanuts (which worked great) and for my 850 Watt microwave oven, I heated the corn syrup & sugar mixture for 2 and a half minutes, then added the nuts and heated for 3 min and 15 seconds (total of 5 min and 45 seconds). I then added the butter & vanilla mixture and heated for 2 and a half minutes. After taking this out of the microwave, I immediately added 3/4 tsp of baking soda (I did not add the full tsp by recommendation of other reviewers and I found this worked out fine) and poured onto a well buttered sheet of aluminum foil (for a more buttery taste), placed on my cookie sheet.

I took the advice of one of the reviewers and placed my greased cookie sheet into my preheated oven at 200 degrees while going through the above process - this definitely helped me be able to spread my candy more thinly (tip the cookie sheet from side to side instead of trying to spread with a spatula).

Make sure you have all the ingredients measured out ahead of time because this process goes by quickly!

After recently moving, I thought I'd lost my copy of this recipe that I'd faithfully posted on my refrigerator.  Thank goodness I remembered I'd originally gotten it here!  First things first, I used macadamia nuts, as opposed to peanuts, almonds or cashews (though I have made it with the last two nuts, and have loved it!).  They were regular salted, dry roasted macadamia nuts that I broke up a bit by putting them into a heavy duty zip-top bag, and tapping with a meat mallet.  I added them right into the sugar/corn syrup mixture in the beginning to make sure they'd get nice and toasted, and did they ever!  Delicious!  Second thing to note, I have a 1300 watt microwave.  To offset the discrepancy in wattage, I microwaved it in my large Pyrex bowl for 4 minutes instead of 6, and then the second round went for 2 minutes, and came out perfectly.  Third thing to note, you don't have to get anything fancy to pour this stuff out onto.  I've always used Reynolds Release foil (the non-stick stuff), and it comes off like a dream.  Just chuck the foil in the recycling bin at the end, and cleanup is finished.

Excellent taste and texture!  I have a 1200 watt oven so I shortened the cooking time to six minutes for the first cooking part and after adding the butter and vanilla I microwaved the brittle for 2 minutes and 30 seconds.  No problems with burning and the brittle was brittle like it is supposed to be.  Way too easy!

Outstanding!!  So easy I couldn't believe it!!  You do need to play with the cooking times a bit, I think it was based on a 700 watt mic, and mine is 1000, I shortened it  a bit much the first time and got the "chewy" brittle others had complained about..I ended up cooking it for 6 min 30 sec, and 2 min 40 sec and it is PERFECT everytime!!  Who knew peanut brittle was so easy to make???

I have a 1000 W microwave and found that 6 1/2 minutes on the first cycle and 2 1/2 minutes on the second is perfect.  I add the nuts at the beginning like the recipe says and have had perfect results....no burning.   I use a Silpat mat and put my pan in a warm oven while cooking.  I also use a silicone hot dish pad so that I can use the force of my hand to flatten out the brittle even more after spreading it out initially.

Let me just say this candy brittle is off the chart.It was so good .I actually made this brittle about 6 times.The first time i tried this recipe .The brittle where kinda chewy but it was still good.And i think the reason it came out chewy was because i used a small pan and i didn't let it cook long enough.The second time i used a longer pan,and let me just say that it was phonemonal so delicious.And every other time i made this is was delicious.Now my co workers and my family is requesting some.Thanks a million.I even used pecan and cashew in this in a layer of coconut OMG you just can't eat one

NEVER, EVER WILL I STIR AGAIN!!  This recipe was oh-so-easy!  Never again will I use the stove-top recipe I have & stir by hand for hours!  This was sooo easy!  My only tip, use a glass bowl (easier clean up), use cooking spray and douse your cookie sheet, and use a heat resistant spatula to scoop out (I grabbed the wrong spat & melted it in two!).  Thanks for the recipe!

Very easy and quick.  I would stay by the microwave and watch it so it doesn't burn.  Also, someone else mentioned that a good way to get the brittle to spread is to heat the oven to 250 and heat the pan first.  Or the brittle doesn't spread well and turns out thicker.

This has got to be one of the BEST recipes out there considering the time & effort it takes & it tastes just like the stovetop version!  I followed MARIEZEE's times & it worked on the first try!  Here's what I did-  First I put a (non sprayed) parchment lined cookie sheet in a 170 degree oven.  I used an 8c Pyrex measuring bowl (with handle) & sprayed it with Pam.  I put the corn syrup FIRST, then the sugar on top & micro 2 1/2 min., stirred, then added the nuts stirred & micro 2 min., added vanilla & butter, stirred & micro 1 min., added the soda, stirred & spread on warm sheet.  I used Planter's Mixed Nuts (salted) so left out the pinch of salt.  Excellent & so easy.  Do not double & make sure & cool @room temp (NOT in fridge) -for some reason it changes the texture from brittle to chewy.  So glad I discovered this before Christmas!

Well, I have to admit that I was suspicious that something so good, could be so easy...but it was! My Husband is a diabetic, so I replaced the sugar in the recipe with "Splenda Granular" and I used the salted and roasted peanuts that you can buy at Costco and omitted the salt in the recipe. I spread it out on a silipat covered baking sheet which worked great and I also used a glass measuring cup like many people recommended. My Husband happened to buy me some peanut brittle for Christmas and when we did a comparison, this one was by far, the better of the two. The peanut to brittle ratio is much better and it tastes more like peanuts...the store bought is much sweeter tasting. And I just let all of the dishes soak in hot soapy water and clean up was a breeze!

Fabulous and EASY...how can you beat that?  I followed the directions to a "T" and it turned out wonderful.  It was my first time making candy of any sort and I could not believe how easy it was!  I do recommend using a glass batter bowl (one with a handle) to help pour the  candy out of the bowl once finished.  I also lined my baking sheet with foil and lightly sprayed with butter flavored Pam, made clean up a breeze.  This is so simple, I'll be making it as christmas treats for friends and neighbors!

I did not have much faith in this recipe.  I don't typically use my microwave at all, and I didn't really think this was going to turn out but I trusted all of the other five star ratings and gave it a shot.  It was fanastic!  I had a whole batch of peanut brittle in ten minutes, and it's even better than the candy thermometer method.  I made the recipe exactly as written, and even though I have a very powerful microwave I still heated for the full 7-3 minutes.  My suggestions for a first-time baker of this recipe would be to work quickly once removed from the microwave, and make sure your spatula/spoon is heat-proof.  Do not pause the microwave to stir, and do not try to double the recipe (it only takes ten minutes after all!). I didn't grease a cookie sheet, just placed a large sheet of parchment on the counter and poured the mixture directly on it.  It's wonderful, but kind of thick with the amount of peanuts, so since I grew up with a thinner peanut brittle I'll probably reduce the peanuts to one cup next time.

This was my first time making peanut brittle and thanks to this recipe and some great tips from past reviews, I whipped up 3 easy, delicious batches in no time!  I used cocktail peanuts, omitted the salt, microwaved in my 1000 watt oven 6 min. then 2 min., used FRESH baking soda and poured it out onto a SILPAT on a cookie sheet.  Immediately ran the sticky bowl & utensils under hot water and they were spotless by the time the brittle hardened!  Put my confection into holiday ziploc containers and they're ready for the neighbors...cheap, easy and delicious!  I'll be making these every year!

My grandmother made microwave peanut brittle for years. This was my first time making it and it turned out great. I watched each batch carefully to make sure it didn't burn. Like other reviewers, I added the peanuts (I also made cashew brittle!) after about 4 minutes. Then added the butter and vanilla. Since microwaves do vary so much, my suggestion is to watch it carefully. Once it starts to get golden, then add the nuts, etc. My husband liked it so much that I ended up having to give smaller portions out to my neighbors. Next time I'll make more or hide it!

This recipe is fantastic, esp. with all the helpful reviews - add roasted nuts after 3 minutes of cooking, spread on warm pan, etc.  One more tip - I used an instant-read thermometor which i bought for making bread, and make sure to cook until its 300 degrees.  A candy thermometor is too slow - by the time the reading is correct, the candy has started to cool.

As with any recipe, depending on your appliances and your altitude you might need to adjust the recipe (mostly the timing) a bit. I have a 1100 watt microwave so to say that following the directions burnt my first batch would be an understatement. I failed twice--but my third batch was incredible. On my third batch I added a bit more salt, a couple more pinches. With a 1100 watt microwave I had to decrease the cooking time to 4 min and 45 seconds. I quickly learned to add the dry roasted peanuts with the butter instead of in the beginning as this gives it a less burnt taste--if you use raw nuts add them in at first. After adding the butter, vanilla and nuts I then cooked it for only 1 min and 45 seconds longer. When you first pull it out and start to stir in the baking soda it looks way too light for brittle, however, if you stir it for a tiny bit it will turn golden. Immediately to the pan and sets up in about 5 minutes. Beautiful! Hope this helps for people with a higher powered microwave, all my batches since have been amazing!

Very good and very easy! I can't imagine going back to stovetop. My suggestion is to use a bowl with a handle (like a large pyrex measuring cup) because the bowl gets very hot and is hard to hold while pouring into the pan.

I have never made candy before, but this was way too easy! After the first batch was done, I couldn't beleive how fast and simple this was, so made two more batches! This is classic nut brittle...great taste, nice and crispy crunchy and light. I added a few more nuts, and went half and half peanuts and cashews. Delicious! Everybody is getting a bag of this for Christmas! Thanks Linda!!!

HOLY COW! IT WORKED!  I have made peanut brittle at Christmas for years...sticky messes, a candy thermometer, stirring forever.  This recipe was so EASY and the brittle is DELICIOUS! (I followed the cooking times in the recipe but cooked at a 80% power level on my 850 watt oven.) Thank you Linda!

After reading some of the trouble people had with this recipe I was a bit nervous to try it. Microwave time is critical. Read the reviews and go with the suggested time for your microwave power. Mine is 1200 watts and I cooked the sugar & corn syrup mixture for 5 minutes and then added the peanuts, butter & vanilla. Cooked it for 2 minutes more before adding the baking soda.  Useful Advice from this site... -Use a glass 8 cup measuring cup with a handle. -Sprayed cooking spray on the back of the cookie sheet & had it pre heated in a 200 degree oven. -Used cooking spray on the lip of the bowl and on a silicone spatula for spreading the mixture on the cookie sheet. -I had everything ready & pre measured -Just soak the bowl in hot water overnight & clean easily in the morning.  I used a silicone oven mitt and didn't have trouble with the extremely hot bowl but I wouldn't advise trying this without a good set of oven mitts.  Only trouble was not eating it all in one sitting.

Omgosh Peanut Brittle deliciousness!!! First batch did not set...AT ALL! Second batch set but was chewy and pulled like taffy. Third batch delicious brittle perfection! Turns out that I was not cooking it long enough (thanks to some reviews) I was scared that it would burn. Six minutes worked well for me and then 1.5 min more. Don’t be afraid to let that sugar cook and if you don’t see a deep tan-like color you need to zap it a little longer. Your brittle should not be very light in color or clear-like. You should stand by it you'd be able to smell it if it were burning, don't let it go more than 7-8 min the 1st time. You'll eventually get your desired results as I did. Now I'm going to try different nuts! Yum~O!!!

Just finished making this a couple of hours ago.  It was perfect! Easy! I had read some of the reviews before attempting this and found someone had said that it burned everything ... you have to check the Wattage on your Microwave Oven!!! Mine is 1200, the recipe calls for 700 watts.  I put my power on 80% used exact time and it got dark but not burned.  It looks more like what you would buy and tastes better!

I’ve been making this WONDERFUL recipe for about 5 years now (Thanks, Linda C!) and I’ve learned a few things along the way. Here are a few tips:
This timing is based on using a 900W microwave. Times will vary with other wattages.
• Microwave the sugar and corn syrup mixture on HIGH for exactly 6 minutes. Working quickly, stir in butter, nuts and vanilla, in that order. Return the bowl to the microwave and micro on HIGH for 2 ½ minutes longer.
• Pre-heat the greased baking sheet in a 200 degree oven until the last minute. Then, place it on a damp tea towel so it won’t slide around as you work.
• Use all white corn syrup OR half and half white and golden. Using all golden syrup can result in the mixture cooking too quickly.
• Don’t try it with maple syrup. Mine ended up scorched with a strange, sugary texture.  
• I have had success with almonds, peanuts, Spanish peanuts with skins, mixed nuts, skinned hazelnuts and cashews but no luck with walnuts.
• Timing can be altered if you're using roasted nuts vs. raw nuts.
• Grease all utensils (wooden spoons and spatulas) well with butter and PAM prior to starting.
• Have everything pre-measured and handy so that you can work VERY quickly.
• Keep a bowl of ice water handy in case you’re unlucky enough to get any of the hot syrup on your skin!!!  :-0
• It will keep well at room temperature. However, if the finished brittle is exposed to humidity it will become sticky and inedible.

I have a 1500-watt microwave. Here is how I made the recipe. Microwave Sugar, Salt, Corn syrup, 1 cup of raw peanuts 4:00 minutes at 60% power in a 4-cup pyrex measuring cup. Stir well, microwave additional 4:00 minutes at 60% power. Add 1 tsp butter and vanilla extract and microwave 90 seconds at 60% power. Add baking soda, stir well, spread on greased cookie sheet to cool. Wash 4-cup measuring cup in hot soapy water at once to reduce sticking. Soaking for a while will remove stuck on sugar. This recipe is great!

I have made this very same recipe for years.  Only one difference-use dark corn syrup!  Also my family prefers pecans instead of peanuts.  This is excellent I can never make enough for everyone!

This was the easiest and best tasting brittle I have ever had. I don't really like big pieces of nuts so I chopped them in my chopper the secon batch and everyone liked that one better. It seemed to really bring out the peanut flavor.

I made peanut brittle for the first time today in chemistry class and my shoulder hurts from constantly stirring and using a bunsen burner was very hot and unpleasant. Lol. This recipe has the same exact ingredients as the one I made today and well I haven't made this one yet but the steps are basically the same just using different appliences. I gave this recipe a five because this is utterly GENIUS!!! So fast and simple compared to the amount of time it took to make it the usual way (I was late for my next class) Thank you sooo much Linda C. !!!
Some tips from me: This tastes great with macadamia nuts or almonds. Very delicious. Since I am allergic to peanuts I omitted them and it still tasted delicious and buttery OMG SOOO GOOD!!!

This recipe is awesome. I have a 1300 watt microwave and took the advice of another reviewer on cook times. I cooked the sugar and syrup for 2 1/2 minutes, added the nuts (I used cashews) and cooked for another 2 minutes, added the vanilla and butter and cooked for 1 additional minute. Finally I used 1/2 tsp of baking soda and poured the mixture onto a heated cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. It was a little difficult to spread but it set up gorgeously. And it tastes wonderful! I did try coating the spoon and bowl with cooking spray, but it didn't seem to accomplish anything. Just soak the spoon and bowl in hot soapy water for awhile and it cleans up easily. Great recipe!

Just made it, thinking I followed recipe to the tee but I added the soda along with the butter and vanilla, and it came out FAB! Husband loved it as it wasn't tooth-breakingly hard! No hard clean-up!  It's only sugar, so hot water makes for easy clean-up! Thx for the recipe!

This is the same recipe that my Grandfather found in our local newspaper many years ago.  It is so special to our family becuase each year at Christmas we knew he would make a special batch for each of his grandkids.  After his passing, my grandmother gave the recipe to each of us. Each microwave varies on cook times, so it's always the second and sometimes third batch that comes out perfect.  According my my microwave; the first cooking time is 7 minutes and 40 seconds and the second cooking time is 2 minutes.  Thanks for posting!!!

My mom makes peanut brittle in the microwave so I was hoping this was her recipe but unfortunately, this one was not as good, so I have to pester her for it. But anyway, when I made this I cooked it in a measuring bowl that I first sprayed with nonstick cooking spray. It poured out easily and I only had one dish to clean, and clean up was a snap. Keep your eye on this, mine almost boiled over numerous times. Just stop the micro for a second or 2, but don't open the door. Also, when it's done, be ready to pour right away, you don't have much time!

I've been making this recipe for years and everyone always raves about it!  It's a common Christmas gift from me.  I've also experimented with walnuts, almonds, and pecans and they have all turned out fabulous - each has a unique taste of its own.  If you spray the spatula with Pam and use parchment paper on the cookie sheet, cleanup is much easier.

My mom always made her peanut brittle in the microwave with some recipe that came in with her 1st (and only!) microwave.  I found this and decided to give it a try.   The result were acceptable with the times written and near perfect I'm sure if it wasn't 97% humidity here yesterday!  It is simple and easy and very very tasty! Update: 12.07.07 - the trick to getting any microwave brittle to cook correctly according to the directions is to know the wattage of your microwave.  Mine is 1000-watt (I had to go look up the model online because I couldn't find it anywhere ON the microwave!) and proceed from there.  So, for this recipe I cook at 70% power for the times listed and it is fabulous every time!

Awesome.  If I could give it more stars, I would.  I read and followed most of the suggestions and the results were simply perfection.  
1. Use the 4 Cup Pyrex Glass Measuring cup -- the 8 cup was too heavy -- hard on my wrists.  Heavily coat the glass measuring cup inside/spout and outer rim with Pam before starting.
2. Boil 2 pots of water on your stove before starting -- use this water to clean the Pyrex Glass Measuring Cup -- this really does work - it melts the sugar.  Clean up was not a problem.
3.  Use wooden utensils for mixing/blending/spreading.  I used both wooden and metal utensils.  The wooden ones came clean faster than the metal.
3.  Really mix the sugar and light corn syrup well before nuking in microwave.  This makes a huge difference.
4. Cover your cookie sheet with aluminum foil/put in oven at 200 degrees.  Take it out when you start your second part of the recipe (the butter/vanilla) and coat the foil with butter.
4.  If using roasted peanuts, put peanuts in on the 2nd part of recipe with the butter/vanilla.
5. Use the baking soda -- no one will break a tooth!
6.  For my 900 Watt microwave the time = 7 minutes on the first part, 3 minutes on the last part.

Fabulous peanut brittle - the best ever! (though this is the first time I've ever made any myself).  Since our microwave has 1200 watts, I cooked it first at 70% for 6 minutes (adding the peanuts after 2 minutes), then added the butter and vanilla and cooked another 2 1/2 minutes before taking it out and adding the baking soda.  Turned out just perfect and delectible!

I buy either the 4 pound can of peanuts or the 2 pound can of cashews over at Menards (yes, they sell more then hardware and lumber) mainly for this recipe. Either of them work well and as a bonus, they are inexpensive. This is truly a very good recipe that I have used for at least a couple of years. I'm going right out to buy a clear glass 4-cup measuring cup with a handle especially for making this brittle as some others have suggested. I believe that it will make an easy recipe even easier

I agree with others..you have to get the timing just perfect for your microwave!  But this is amazing brittle. Easiest thing I've ever made!   For easy peel-off, I dump the hot mixture onto an upside down baking sheet.  Comes off and breaks up nicely!

This peanut brittle was so easy to make and a big hit with my whole family! I have a 1250 watt oven, so I used 60% power. I did everything else the same except I added the peanuts with the butter like other reviewers suggested.My dad thought that it could have had a stronger butter flavor, but I think it's great.

Good and tasty, but I think I would like it a bit thinner so it wouldn't stick to my teeth as much!
My tip to everyone is to use parchment paper on the cookie sheet instead of greasing one.  No mess, no fuss, and the brittle peels right off!!

Unbelievably easy and delicious.  Made this for my husband's staff party and people were literally fighting over the last piece!  I live in a high humidity area (Florida)and it still set beautifully.  For those folks who find it chewy, make sure you use real butter.  No substitutions.  Margarine will give you goo.

I love this recipe, it's absolutely bulletproof.  I've been making it for years and everyone raves about how good it is.  I've also used cashews and pistachios as well and they were awesome.  I use a 2 qt. Pyrex measuring cup to cook it in and I use good silicone spatulas and spread it on parchment paper when it's done.  I have a double set of utensils so that I can make multiple batches quickly.  It's well worth a try!

Perfect every time!  (unless you try to double the recipe...that doesn't work so well)
I've made this recipe countless times and as long as I've got peanuts or almonds in my cupboard, it's super quick and easy.  If you've got a sweet tooth and can't find something sweet in the house...this is perfect because of how fast it is made.  It's awesome

After reading all the reviews, I decided this is what I would do.  Micro is 1000 watts so the time went this way. 6 min. then 2 min.  I used a 4 qt. corning ware bowl.  Using RAW whole peanuts...I shook them to make them half themselves. One (1) cup was enough, infact I may even lessen that just a little next time.   This is a work fast recipe.  Let me not forget to mention...EXTREMELY HOT!!! when you take it out the first time, PLEASE(!) WEAR A OVEN GLOVE!!  Suggestion:  Layer exactly as the recipes calls for, peanuts on the bottom (to prevent burning). I also placed this on foil & cooled in the fridge.  A very easy recipe to make.  Tasty & will become a favorite.

I have an 1100 watt microwave so kept close watch while making this.....I cooked 6 minutes, then 2 minutes for the final round.....I think any longer and it would have tasted burnt.  Brought it to work and it was a HUGE HIT!  HINT***  For a more buttery flavor, coat the cookie sheet with butter - THICK - delicious!  I will be making this again!!

I have used this same recipe for years with a couple of exceptions...Not in the ingredients...but in the way it is handled AFTER it is cooked. DO NOT just pour out in pan and let harden,but pour onto TWO cookie sheets that have been covered with buttered heavy duty foil...Then as it cools,work quickly and pull from outer edges to stretch it thinner. Melt in your mouth YUMMY! Julia aka GRANNY Wood.

This is a great recipe, if you know how to adjust it according to how many watts your microwave is.  Thank you to the reviewer who has an 1100 watt microwave - that helped alot because that is the same as mine.  It definitely makes a huge difference in the outcome.  Thanks for the recipe - so quick and easy!

This is so good; and easy too.  I have made it several times and we always love it. Stores great in zip-lock baggies.   I have done it with almonds, and also cashews.  Also I have thrown in chocolate pieces on top after pouring it out while still warm.  YUMMY

I love the flavor of this. I did play with it a bit after reading the reviews. I had to as I have a 1000 watt microwave. My total cooking time on 80% power was around 7-8 minutes. I nuked the sugar mixture for 2 minutes before adding the nuts, then watched until it was bubbly and the nuts browned, added the butter and vanilla, and cooked 2 minutes longer before adding the baking soda. It set up beautifully, but looks very airy (full of tiny holes) when it's broken up. This is definitely worth making again!

OUTSTANDING...!!!!  I was so afraid to try this recipe, but am so happy I did.  My first ever attempt at Peanut Brittle and it was a raving success.   Can't thank you enough, Linda, for an easy and quick way to make one of my favorite candies.  This is my boss' all-time favorite as well, and I attempted this recipe mainly to make a gift for him for Christmas.  I have a 1000 watt oven, nuked the sugar and syrup for 5 minutes, then added the peanuts, salt, butter and vanilla and nuked it another 2-1/2 minutes.  I followed the advise of others and used parchment paper, warmed the tray, and sprayed the spatula with PAM.  Clean up was a cinch.  This is a definite re-do many times over for me.  Thank you again.

After reading many reviews, I thought I'd offer my two cents!  Fabulous peanut brittle and yes, it's that easy!  I agree with a previous reviewer that 1 cup of peanuts is plenty, especially if you like more of the candy!   Also, the suggestion to line the pan with waxed paper was a BAD IDEA!  I thought it would save me some steps, but the paper adhered to the cooled brittle and I spent more time trying to peel it off as I broke up the brittle.  My suggestion?  Spray cooking spray on the waxed paper first!  I didn't need the pan--I put the waxed paper on my granite counter top and it worked fine (except that I should have greased the paper first).    Thanks!  I'm going to make cashew brittle with the same recipe!

This is the best recipe I have ever gotten from this site!!  I make this twice weekly and people rave about my brittle.  You have to play with the times to see what works in your microwave.  Here's what works perfectly for me in my 1000 watt microwave: 1-I cook sugar and corn syrup for 5 minutes 45 seconds. Any longer and it burns and any less and it's not done. 2-I add the dry roasted peanuts with the butter and vanilla.  Since they are already roasted, the peanuts don't need to cook the entire time.  I use salted peanuts so I do not add the additional salt. Then I cook an additional 2 minutes. I grease my pan with butter and keep it in a warm oven until ready to spread.  It does harden quickly  but the warm pan helps to spread.  The spreading is the hardest part of the recipe.  I do recommend using a 4 cup bowl with a handle to cook in.  The  bowl comes out very hot and is much easier to pour in the pan with a handle.  I have also made this using roasted cashews and it turns out wonderfully.  If you like brittle, do try this recipe.

I have an 1100 watt microwave and following Linda's recipe my brittle burned after adding the nuts. I tried it again lowering the time and this is what worked for me. 2 1/2 minutes for the sugar and corn syrup, add the nuts and cook for 2 more minutes, add the vanilla and butter and 1 1/2 minutes more. I only did the 1 1/2 at the end for my husband because he likes it almost brown. I prefer it at 1 minute instead and it is gold like the photo on the original. I liked the hint posted about spraying the pouring edge of the pyrex bowl and also the wooden spoon with Pam and I used parchment paper to line the cookie sheet. You can re-use that several times and the brittle is

Good recipe, however you have to make a few batches to get the temp just right as some microwaves have different levels of cooking. The first batch I made had good flavor, but was WAY too chewy, the second I added time in the cooking process and it came out perfect.

I've been perfecting my microwave brittle recipe for a year and last night I couldn't find my recipe.  I made this recipe and it was the best one yet.  I've been heating the sugar, syrup and peanuts from the start and this recipe adds the peanuts later.  It makes a huge difference.  Thanks so much.

This recipe is amazing! Once you figure out the right timing for your microwave, it's easy to make over and over again. For the calorie conscious, I tried it with half sugar and half granulated splenda after I had my heart set on making another batch and discovered that I only had 1/2 c sugar in the house. It works well and I couldn't taste a difference!

This has been my recipe for a while now.  I use regular roasted peanuts though, and I double the peanuts total 3 cups.
 The trick with this recipe is getting the timing of your microwave right.  I have messed some batches by either burning the nuts or it coming out too soft but it is an individuals microwave that decides the timing. 
 I always pour the batch onto Parchment paper in a cookie sheet and just break into pieces.  
  I laugh every time I see a small handful of peanut brittle @ the store for an outrageous price knowing this recipe gives me a bigger batch with much better quality.
  This recipe is a Peanut Brittle Lovers Delight you just need to get the proper timing.  
  You will also have to soak your utensils and bowls in water for a while before they will come clean as the sugar solution needs to dissolve.

Great recipe!  I used the glass measuring bowl with the handle. I used the rubber scraper that was good for high heat.  I then used the silicone cookie sheet liner to pour it onto.  WOW!  It was a snap to pull off and break.  (I remember my mother using aluminum foil and having to pick pieces of it out of the brittle.)
My microwave is 1100 watt.  I went with 6 min then 2 mins without problems.

This was tasty. It took me a little longer to get the brittle to darken down a bit, but it is sure worth it! I remember some recipe that was similar, only cooked in the microwave...

This recipe is very good.  The first time I made it, everything went perfectly the 2nd time I doubled it and it did'nt harden all the way. more like taffy. I didn't read the DO NOT DOUBLE review till after I made the 3rd batch. so we will see what happens this time.
To those of you who burn it, Maybe you have a microwave with high wattage? Some go way over 1000, so if you are cooking it the full amount of time, it may be the trouble. It is 6 to 7  minutes in a 700 watt oven.

I made this in two batches yesterday.  One batch was a pale color and not as crispy as the second.  I made one the the morning and one in the afternoon.  I think humidity was a factor, but both batches tasted great.  I lowered the cooking time to 4 minutes plus 3 minutes for 1100 watt oven.  Also since my peanuts were already roasted, I did not add them till halfway through cooking.

I have made this recipe many times and people constantly ask me for the recipe.  I followed the other reviewers advise on things.  It is really important to have all your ingredients ready prior to starting.  I use a glass 4 cup measuring cup and put the ingredients in the one bowl and it is such an easy clean up.  Definately use Reyonlds Non-Stick it works like a charm.  I have made it with both the dry roasted peanuts and the salted peanuts and people seem to prefer the salted peanuts.  Do not add salt if using the salted peanuts.  I have a newer microwave, so I only microwaved for 6 minutes then put the vanilla and butter for 2 minutes.  This is so easy and tasty.  Thanks for the great recipe

Exceptionally easy and exceptionally good, and I don't even like peanuts.
Three pieces of advice:  (1) Use a big bowl.  This can really foam up.  (2) Don't be tempted to interrupt the microwave early to stir.  (3) Once you add the baking soda, just stir rapidly and pour right away.  This can harden quickly.

I am going to try cashews next.  This is a very easy and tasty recipe.

I never made peanut brittle before so this is my first!  What a great and very quick recipe!  I did have to experiment w/ this for my 1200 watt oven.  I cooked the sugar and corn syrup for 4 mins.  Then added dry roasted peanuts and cooked for 1 1/2 mins.  Added the butter and vanilla and cooked for a minute more.  It turned out perfect!!!  Thanks Linda C.!!!

EZ!!  Had an airiness due to the baking soda which was great...NOT like eating pieces of a brick.  Everyone loved it...would make great gifts.

UPDATE:  Now 2017 and I'm STILL making this...great tool in my toolbox for emergency gifts and goodies.

I have a newer GE Advantium microwave and added the peanuts in after the first 2 min. total cooking time for the first go around was 6 mins. Second go around was 2 mins. I did take the advice of others here and kept a glass of cold water ready to teste for the hard crack stage and it worked like a charm! Also I used the Reynolds quick release foil..WOW! This stuff is amazing. I diddnt have to spray and wasnt left with a sticky mess. The Peanut Brittle was a hit! Everyone loved it! EDIT:12/12/10: Made the mistake of using roasted peanuts in my new micro. It may be the times need to be re adjusted but it burned bad. So I am going to use raw peanuts next time
and hopefully won't get the burned taste. Still a 5 star recipe!

The first time I made this recipe, I was not sure how many watts my microwave was, so I cooked it as another reviewer suggested, 5 minutes then 1 min and 45 seconds for the second cooking.  The recipe did not properly cook and was chewy.  I tried the recipe again, this time following the recipe exactly, and it came out perfect.  The only change I made was I used a mixture of salted peanuts and cashews--YUM.  I incorporated the brittle with cookie plates that were given out as gifts--beautiful display.  Next year I will make the peanut brittle as gifts!!  If your recipe comes out chewy the first time, please try it again, you will NOT be sorry!  Thanks for a great recipe Linda!!!

This recipe was easy and terrific.  And I found a way to keep it from sticking to the pan after hardening. Cover pan with tin foil and rub crisco on.  The brittle will peel right off after 20 minutes.

WoW!  This recipie is fantastic!!!  I have never made peanut brittle before as I don't like the hassle of making candy, but this was a breeze!  I cooked in a 1,100 watt microwave for the 6 + 2 minutes.  Absolutely perfect...crunchy, tender, penutty, and easy to chew.  Not sticky or so hard you can't bite it.  The best peanut brittle I have ever tasted!  For those who have had less-than-satisfactory results, I would try again, and adjust your cooking time.  I wouldn't double this recipe as it is easy enough to make twice and have great results.

Absolutely disgusting! I the sugar and peanuts in the microwave for 6 minutes and it burned. My house smells like a camp fire, the peanuts are black, and the dish they were in is almost impossible to clean. Peanut brittle made on the stovetop allows for more control and is just as easy. Try this one if you want to waste almost two cups of peanuts and sugar.

This was my first attempt at making peanut brittle, and I have to confess the first batch looked and tasted like charcoal because I discovered too late that my microwave is 1,500 watts! After a few more attempts, I finally found the correct time/power level and the result has been a huge hit. One tip for  cooks who live outside the U.S. and cannot find corn syrup, or for those who are allergic to corn products: substitute simple syrup made of 1 cup sugar, 1/4 cup water brought to a boil and then cooled slightly. While I can't compare against the original recipe, I know mine turned out terrific.

Read reviews and decided to try it. It was super easy, and followed to the "T", however, it Did Not Set up. It is more like caramel-peanut-chewy something. Will try again one day. Just not around a holiday. Disappointed.

Absolutley wonderful! My family can't get enough of it! I did change 2 small things about the recipe, I doubled the butter and the vanilla from 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon to 2 for more of a buttery toffee taste. My microwave is 1650 watt so my cooking times were 7 mins. at 70% power and 3 mins. at 70% power. The brittle came out perfect every time. Thank you Linda for a great recipe!

This was my first time making peanut brittle and I'll definitely be making more. 
I added 6 slices of crumpled bacon and a pinch of cayenne pepper with the butter & vanilla to jazz it up a bit and the taste was phenomenal! 
Cleanup wasn't too bad once I added hot water to the glass bowl and microwaved it for 7-8 minutes.

I have made more batches than I can even begin to count as Chrismas presents over the years.  Everyone thinks you have gone to a lot of work when really it couldn't be simpler.  If you are making mulitple batches of this it is VERY important to let the bowl cool a bit between times, my aunt once exploded a bowl in her sink, rinsing it after the third or fourth batch.

Excellent recipe & super easy.  I did use Mariezee's suggestions since I also have a stronger microwave.  I tried one batch on waxed paper, and the paper stuck to the candy.  It probably needed to be sprayed. A sprayed cookie sheet worked great.

I don't like peanut brittle but this was actually pretty good.  I made it for my parents because they do like it and besides being really easy they said it was delicious and asked for the recipe.

I loved this recipe so much, I had refused for awhile to make any kind of brittle during the holidays because of the lengthy process of stirring to hardcrack stage(what with all the other baking to be done) but this was soooo easy.  I loved it so much that I did one with macadamia adding toasted coconut at the halfway mark and then dried tropical fruit at same time as butter and vanilla, all the flavors permeated the brittle and it was awesome.

I have been using this recipe for 2 years now and always get asked for the recipe.  My microwave is 1800 watts and I cook for the full 7 minutes, but reduce the power to 70%, then another 3 minutes at 70% and it always comes out perfectly!

the flavor was awesome.  But I was hoping for something w/ crunch to it.  This came out EXTREMELY chewy.

Wow, I'm so excited about finding this recipe! Tastes the same and is so much easier than my granny's method of making peanut brittle...not that I would ever tell her that! I took the most popular reviewers advice to cook 2.5 minutes then add peanuts and cook 2.5 minutes more then add butter and vanilla and cook 1.5 minutes. Perfect! Not a bad batch yet :) Make sure to grease the pan very well and also grease the sides of the bowl and spoon before pouring it out!

I was a skeptic of this recipe, just because I have tried microwave peanut brittle before and it didn't harden.  So I decided to try it again.  This time making sure I paid attention to my wattage and the brittle as it was cooking.  I have a 1000 watt microwave...I microwaved first for 3 1/2 minutes, then added the butter and vanilla and then microwaved about another 4 1/2 minutes, stopping a couple times to stir and check the nuts.  It turned out pretty good hardened very well but I had burned the nuts just a little..but still very tasty.  I would recomend maybe 3 1/2 minutes on the second go round.

I tried a traditional, old-fashioned recipe (one in which you use a candy thermometer and stir on the stove), and this one two days apart.  From a taste test, I really couldn't say the old-fashioned recipe tasted any better.  This recipe is so fast and so much easier.  I have an 1100 watt microwave  and ended up adding the peanuts after miking 2 minutes, cooked 4 minutes more, added the butter, cooked 4 1/2 minutes more, added the soda and vanilla, and poured out to cool on warmed cookie sheets, which had been buttered and lightly sprinkled with salt, as suggested by another reviewer.  This is just a great method, and a wonderful way to make lots for gifts or just for the fun of it.

So easy and very very good.  I love it with cashews!  We have a 1200 watt microwave and cooked the sugar and corn syrup 2.5 min, added nuts and salt for 2 min, added vanilla and butter for 1.5 min, the stirred in baking soda.  Poured on was paper lined baking sheet.  Let set 15 mintues.  Wax paper was slightly stuck, so held over saucepan of boiling water until easy to peel back.  Be sure all ingredients are ready to go.  Using 4 cup pyrex measuring cup worked fabulous as well as spraying spoon with Pam between stirring and rinsing it under hot water between uses to keep it clean.
Will make again and again.

10 STAR RECIPE!!!  That's what this one deserves!  This is THE best peanut brittle - you'll be proud to say, "I made it!"  I grease the sheet pan with butter (gives that salty taste) and it's really good.  I cooked for 6 mins., added the other ingredients and finished like recipe says.  No problems with texture, burning, clean-up, nada!  It's absolutely the best.  Try to have an extra pair of hands around to pour out while you scrape.  If you're going to stretch it out with "two forks", go ahead, but realize, this stuff hardens very, VERY quickly - so work fast - there's no time for dawdling with this one.  Don't be too quick to soak the bowl, because what's left in the bowl is your immediate reward!!  Store it AIRTIGHT, after it's cooled.  Try it, you'll love it, I promise.  Those who had problems with texture, didn't come up to temperature properly.  Burnt?  Your oven must be too powerful.  Definitely use the dry-roasted nuts and try the butter to grease the pan.

I have used a similar recipe for probably 10 years.  It is the simplest in the world.  Try using butter sprinkled with a little salt to grease your cookie sheet.  That's the way my Mom and Grandma always did theirs so guess that's why I do.

This is hard for me to rate, because I realized I'm just not sure I like peanut brittle.  This was super easy to make and set well, but it tastes so sugary sweet to me....I haven't had peanut brittle since I was a kid, so I'm not sure if that's the way it's supposed to taste or not?  Mine was also very oily/greasy on the bottom-possible I over-greased the sheet?  The peautty flavor is excellent though and you really can't beat the ease of the recipe for a peanut brittle fan.  I'll update when I see how others react!

UPDATE:  Others have raved about this peanut brittle, but I'm still concerned w/the greasiness.

The flavor of the peanut brittle is very good but I don't know if my oven was not hot enough because I followed the directions exactly and the brittle did not break into pieces. It was more like hard taffy.

Just like the recipe my Mom used to make...I'm SO glad to have found it here! Be sure not to overstir for crispier-fluffy brittle. Also, check your microwave wattage for proper cooking times...(I found the reviews to be very helpful) 4min followed by 2min worked perfectly for my 1000W micro with RAW peanuts.  Have made 6 batches already.  This recipe is well liked by everyone who tries it and couldn't be easier to make!

Deeeeelicious!  First times was a charm!  I wanted to make it for a party in a few days so I did a "trial run".  6 minutes on the first cook time and 2.5 on the second cook time with a 900 watt microwave.  I was torn on the reviews as to how many peanuts to use so I compromised and did 1 1/4 cups.  I'm going to have to go with the people who use only 1 cup.  Other than that...  Thanks for the fastest, easiest and most delicious recipe for Peanut Brittle!

absolutely perfect! i used roasted peanuts, adding them after the first 3 or 4 minutes of microwaving, and had absolutely no burnt taste. following other reviews, i used 1/2 tsp baking soda (great texture and no aftertaste) and tested the candy mixture by dropping a small amount in water to make sure it was at the hard crack stage before adding the soda. i tested it three times, each time just sure it was ready, but it wasn't yet, so it would've been ruined without testing!

Ohhh! This is soooo good, and soooo easy! The first time I made this I tested the timing by stirring every 2 minutes for the first 6...then after adding the vanilla (Sometimes I use maple flavoring if I'm using pecans) and butter I checked every 2 minutes, drizzling a small stream of the syrup into a glass of ice water. When it is ready the thread will crack  when you touch it and will be crunchy when you bite it. (Hard crack stage) If your test thread is chewy nuke it another minute or two then test again. In my 12 year old 700 watt microwave it takes 6 and 4.5 - 5 minutes. I have found that this doesnt turn out as well on rainy or very humid days (fudge doesnt either). I never dreamed peanut brittle could be this quick and easy! I use cocktail peanuts and omit the salt.

This is a great recipe.  I noticed that several others had problems with the brittle being too chewy.  I had the same problem this afternoon (3rd batch) when I tried to do a double batch.  The brittle came out too chewy and won’t separate.  I tried freezing but that helped with separating.  However, it still has the chewy problem.  

I believe the problem stems from low temperature.  When I re-did the batch (single), the temperature came out between 280 – 290 degrees after the first 6 minutes.  If you don’t have an instant read thermostat, you can watch the bubbling.  It should start with 3 – 3.5 minutes left.  After the last 2 minutes, the temperature should be around 320+.  

I hope this helps.

Third times a charm definitely fits with this recipe. The first time I made it I burned it, the second time, came out pretty good, and by the third time, I had the time adjusted enough to make it perfect. The ingredients make a perfect peanut brittle, but watch the microwave times, they didn't work for me. Once you get them right, its a wonderful recipe.

Best and fastest brittle we have ever had.  Made 15 batches since Christmas-sometimes twice a day.  I have a 1000 watt microwave oven so, I cooked for 6 minutes the first time and 2 minutes the second time.  Turned out perfect everytime I made it.

I have never made peanut brittle before.  I have always been too intimidated.  This is so easy, so inexpensive and sooo good.  Once you determine which bowl size works the best (this mixture does swell up and bubble) and how long to cook in your particular microwave.. you will make batch after batch..it is addicting.

I have tried to make this twice and it has come out chewy both times. I even lenghtened the cooking time and it didn't help. What am I doing wrong? The chewiness didn't stop anyone in the house from eating it as the taste is excellent. I just wish the brittle was a brittle.

First time making peanut brittle, and BAM! it worked perfectly!  I followed others suggestions to not put peanuts in until about 3-4 mins cooking time.  I also used foil, but next time will try the wax paper to line the tray.  I poured it out onto a cookie sheet and it filled up about 3/4 of the pan.  My husband pretty much munched on it the entire night.  He loved it! This is a completely easy and fast recipe!

I love it.  Better than See's Candys. 
In a 1100 watt microwave I reduce the power to 7 an cook mixture 4 1/2 minutes. After I mix in the vanila, butter and 1/4 tsp butter flavor I microwave on full power for 2 minutes.

This is wonderful. I am actually kind of annoyed by how good it is. I am sort of an "old school" snob when it comes to cooking and went quite a long time without a microwave at all. I make traditional, stove-top brittle. I didn't even know this could be done in a microwave until recently. I saw this recipe and figured I would give it a try. It really came out nice! The color is beautiful and it is super airy. It's just really a nice candy. I omitted the salt and used salted butter. Reduced the peanuts by 1/2 cup. My microwave is 700 watts. I cooked peanuts, sugar, and corn syrup 6 minutes; added vanilla extract and butter and cooked 3 minutes; stirred in baking soda and poured onto a lightly greased baking sheet. Just perfect!! Thanks for the recipe!! : )

So super easy!  Works like a dream, without the fuss of the candy thermometer. (I'm a novice in that department, so I usually klutz it up)
Made two batches last night with freshly roasted Virginia peanuts and ORGANIC corn syrup.  Yes Virginia, it exists!  Skip the Karo HFCS!  Tastes yummy!

Very easy and delicious peanut brittle. I use 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar because that's what we prefer for taste. Make sure you adjust your time for a powerful microwave or it will burn.

This is a foolproof and perfect recipe for peanut brittle. The first batch was intended for the Christmas treat tray but it didn't make it because we ate it all. Had to buy more peanuts and start over. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Taste great, and the hardest part about making it is the cleanup. 
1. Cut the peanuts back to 1 cup or there is too much nut and not enough brittle. 
2. I usually taste soda in recipes if too much is used, and I used 1 tspn as the recipe says and could not taste it in the finished product.
3. There are a lot of comments about this receipe getting "burnt", so I reduced the cooking time on the first batch and ended up with some delicious peanut chew. Maybe using roasted peanuts those need to be added lated, but the sugar mixture still needed to cook at least 8 minutes. For a light brown but not chewy candy, my cooking times were:
  - Sugar, Syrup and salt for 4 minutes
  - Add 1 cup peanuts and cook 2 more minutes
  - Add butter and vanilla and cook 2 more minutes

I poured it onto parchment paper and stacked in layers in the fridge to cool.

Wicked easy . . .  I don’t think I’d ever bother making peanut brittle on the stovetop again. To make this recipe even easier, I used parchment paper.    My microwave oven is 1000 watts, instead of the 700 watts as indicated in this recipe.  I chose 6 minutes for the first cooking, and 2 minutes for the second cooking which turned out perfect.  I used unsalted nuts so I wish I had added a little extra salt to the recipe but it was still very good.

This recipe is super easy - and the brittle is delicious!  I will never go back to the stove top - softball candy stage method.  Must keep and try!
12/22/2018 - Nut free party option. Tried it with 1-1.5 cups unsweetened coconut and it turned out pretty good. Coconut toasted in the microwave. Needed to do the low end of the times.

The one I have done for years is the sugar and syrup are cooked for 4 min. and then the nuts added cooked for 1-2 more min. then the butter and vanilla added and cooked one more min.  Tne baking soda added at the end stired and brittle put in pan while the mixture is foamy.  The best thing is for years I have substituted cashews for the peanuts.  The taste is so great everyone gets addicted.

My husband loves peanut brittle, but I don't love the tedious task of boiling it on the stove.  Even though I have a family recipe that I always make, I decided to try this and make it easier on myself this year.  He did still like this, but it came out a little chewier and not as crisp as the brittle that I make on the stove.  I am going to try it again and play around with the timing.  I have a 1500 watt microwave, so I had to adjust the cooking times, and I may just need to up the cooking time to get the texture I am looking for.  Overall, this recipe is awesome for saving some arm work and time standing over a hot stove.

Tastes great, easy, and my gf loved it because there was hardly anything to clean up. Followed as written, being conservative on the cooking times, and turned out perfect.  My only suggestion is to double the recipe, because this didn't last very long in my house!

I have been making this for years and years...you do have to watch it to prevent burning because all microwaves are different.  I have used many different types of nuts in this recipe; mixed, macadamias, cashews, etc.

I have to say I didn't think these were going to turn out, but it's the best peanut brittle I've ever had!  It has a sort of sponge toffee texture to it, but it just makes it better for me!!  Thank you very much for this recipe!

This recipe is super easy.  I followed MARIEZEE's timing instructions for a 1100 watt oven and the brittle came out PERFECT!  For clean up you have to use boiling water to loosen the residue on the bowl.

I have made this recipe twice this week for cookie platter gifts. The recipe is very easy to make and tastes great. I spray the microwave bowl & spatula with PAM and it doesn't stick at all. Otherwise you will have a sticky mess to clean up. I will definately make this recipe again. *NOTE: I tried to double this recipe and it didn't turn out!

My first batch didn't brittle. It was more of a gooey, chewy peanut tofee. I didn't want to waste it, so I reaheated the whole thing and poured it over popcorn to make popcorn balls. It was the perfect consistency to make them stick.

Wow.  What else is there to say??? It's so great to be able to use ingredients I already have! The first time I made it, I cooked it a bit too long, and it made the toffee more like the inside of a Crunchie bar, which was also great!

After a couple tries I figured out how to adjust cooking time for my 1100 watt oven.   5 Minutes with corn syrup,salt & sugar. Added the peanuts (not raw) vanilla & butter and  put it back in for 2.5 minutes.  I used a 4 cup Pyrex measuring cup and sprayed the rim with butter flavored Pam. I also sprayed the wooden spoon.  I just poured it into a 13x9 baking pan that was also sprayed and warmed in the oven.

I will never make Peanut Brittle again using a traditional recipe.  I hate to tell recipients how easy it is to make.  I pour the mixture into 2 greased pie pans to make "rounds" that are attractive for gift giving.  I have used Cashews as well and am planning on trying sprinkling on chocolate chips and spreading as suggested by another reviewer.  Thanks for this recipe!

This is a wonderful recipe! This was my first time making candy and was very nervous at first. I was so impressed by the end result. I decided to only mix the sugars in the bowl first and then microwave for 6 minutes. I took it out and then added the peanuts, butter and vanilla. I also decided to lay out parchment paper on the cookie sheet and spray that with cooking spray. It turned out so good! I'm giving some away for christmas!

turns out great. I followed other people's instructions as I have a 1200 watt microwave and so I did it for 2 min, and then another 2 min, and it was softer than taffy, so I did the original times and it came out perfect. Made some for my neighbor and she said it was the best home made peanut brittle and couldn't believe it was made in the microwave in such little time.

Turned out great. Read some reviews first and used some hints. I have a new microwave so started @ 3 and 1/2 Min. Added butter and Vanilla - stirred a little. (Note:All of my sugar had not melted yet.) Returend to microwave and cooked for 3 minutes more. removed and added Baking soda....foamed right up. Stirred a few seconds to get it all combinded then spread onto baking sheet that I sprayed with PAM before hand.  Good luck! I think it's great and easy!

This recipe rocks!!  Having never made brittle before, or any candy for that matter, I didn't want to have to going out and buying a candy thermometer or worry about things like "hard ball".  I'm not even sure if 700 watt microwaves are even made anymore, but mine is a 1500, which was made in 05.  I followed Mariezee's time exactly and everthing turned out just awesome.  I followed the original recipe exactly as well.  I made 5 batches today and each one turned out perfect.  I have a lot of reicpes on this site saved, but this is one of the best ones I've made in a while.

Great recipe! My microwave cooks a little weird. I can't tell what wattage it is because it is all in korean, but I think I got the time figured out now. First, I use a glass bowl with a handle on it (that makes it much easier to get out of microwave). I do the sugar, syrup, and nuts for 4 min 30 sec. I adjusted to time because it didn't look like all the sugar would melt. Then I add the butter and the vanilla, and cook another 2 min 30 sec. 
The only problem I am having is that sometimes the brittle is a little chewy. I have figured out that if I let it sit overnight, it tastes great the next day. Anyway, still love the recipe.

I used an adjusted cooking time for my microwave and it set up perfect. I think mine could have turned out a bit more light and crispy, but I hesitated pouring the mixture due to not having oven gloves ready and my bowl was a bit cumbersome (and hot!). My only complaint about the recipe as written is that 1.5 cups of nuts was bit too much for my taste. Next time I will only use 1 cup.

*Anyone* can make this (I promise!).  I love this simple, yummy recipe.  I added a few dashes of cinnamon this time and it added a little something.  I line a jelly-roll pan with foil and spray with cooking spray and it comes right up -- easy cleanup.  I do the whole recipe in a 4C pyrex glass measuring cup and it fits perfectly (room to bubble up).  Enjoy!

I made this recipe last night when my girlfriend and I had our christmas "bake off".  I followed the directions exactly and I dont know what happened, because it would not harden.  I ended up putting in the freezer for about 30 min and finally got it hard enough to break. Still a little chewy, but good.

Once I got the amount of time adjusted for my 1200 watt microwave (4 1/2 minutes on high, then 2 1/2 minutes after adding the butter and vanilla), it now makes perfect peanut brittle every time - great and easy recipe!

Way too easy. And so very good. I would never figure out they were made in the microwave if I hadn't cooked them. And didn't have to mess with thermometers or "ball stage" stuff.

This was a disaster for me. Burned up candy, a ruined glass bowl, and wasted ingredients. I thought it sounded too good to be true, and I guess it just isn't for me, I'm better the old fashioned way, stovetop with a candy thermometer. Thanks anyway, but I'm not even going to give this one another try.

I didn't think this was possible, but here it is! This was a very good and super easy for Peanut Brittle. I think the only thing I did wrong was grease the cookie sheet too much. I thought it would need it, because of all the sugar and corn syrup, but it doesn't. I won't use as much the next time around. I had to wipe off the brittle once it hardened. An unecessary step.

Amazing and couldn't be easier!  I have a 1000 watt microwave, so I cooked the sugar and corn syrup for 4 minutes, added the butter, vanilla and peanuts and cooked for 2 minutes, then added the baking soda.  I can't wait to make this again!

I have been making this since 1984, right out of book that came with my microwave at that time. Someone was selling at work and said did in microwave.My thought he can,I can.I just made 3 batches Friday night and they were in the mail Saturday. Three batches today for work. I do a little different. Sugar & syrup for 4 minutes, then stir in peanuts and do 3-5 minutes, then add a TSP NOT TBS of butter and vanilla for 2 mins, then the baking soda.  And like the other review after first time I made I went and got a 8 cup pyrex measuring cup with handle to do this recipe. This tastes better than commercial and is simple.  I call it my "12 minute brittle".  I change nuts and extract for change of pace.

I think I need to try this a third time. The first time I followed the exact recipe-watching it carefully for fear of it burning as some people mentioned (maybe due to higher wattage microwaves or differences in altitude.)It was already too burnt before the 6 minutes. Since sugar continues to cook even after its removed from heat, I figured I'd try a 2nd time with seriously reduced cooking times (4 min, 45 sec the first round and 30 seconds the second round). It was still too burnt tasting. Does anyone know if it has to do with me not including peanuts in the brittle? I won't knock the recipe til I've tried it a 3rd time cuz who wants to make it on the stovetop?

This has to be one of the easiest peanut brittle recipes I have ever seen.  I cooked it in an 8 cup pyrex measuring cup to accodate the bubbling of the mixture while it cooked.  I poured the brittle on to a large cookie sheet that had sides and sprayed it first with butter flavored cooking spray.  I also sprayed my nylon spatula with the cooking spray as well.  This helped the mixed slide right off my utensils without sticking.  I was using a 1000w microwave and cooked it for 7 minutes the first time and then 2 more minutes after adding the butter and vanilla.  The peanut brittle came out perfectly.  I think I will be making batches of this and giving it as gifts this year!  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

I didn't have corn syrup on hand so used maple syrup instead, added some cinnamon, and used almonds instead of peanuts. I quartered the recipe and all still came out deliciously well. Now how to keep my hubby away from it so I can enjoy it all?! ;)

I made this brittle but i burnt it (completely my own fault) .  however, i tasted the bit that dried on my spoon from the mixing i'd done halfway thru the process and it tasted delicious, just what i was looking for in a candy apple recipe.  i repeated the recipe, leaving out the nuts, and dipped some green apples in after. it was great!

This is an amazing recipe! I got it on my first try. I have a 900W microwave though, so I just stayed on the low side of the microwave times (6 mins for the first go, 2 mins for the second). Thanks for the great recipe!

The quickest dessert I've ever made. And my other half's mother brought a friend of hers and didn't tell me he was a chef.... He loved it! Ofcourse he had to put up a fight to get any as my boyfriend wouldn't let go of the bowl... This recipe is guaranteed to leave no leftovers. L.O.V.E. I.T. !!!!!!! Thankyou!!!!!! xxxxxxxxxxxxx

This is so good!  I've never been a big brittle fan but this recipe has made me a convert.  With my 1000 watt MW oven, 5 1/2 + 2 minute times work well.  My brittle is fairly light, a sandy toffee color, not orange, but it breaks easily and is not chewy.  In fact, it's perfect.  Thank you so much for this recipe.  I really appreciate it.  (Everyone needs to work out the right timing for themselves as all microwaves can vary.  This should not affect how you rate the recipe as the writer states her own oven wattage so you will know to adjust accordingly.)

This recipe is ridiculously easy.  Shuffle1's suggestion of making this in the 4 cup measuring cup is perfect, and I poured it onto Release aluminum foil without grease - it came right off!  The brittle is light and even I love it, and I never liked brittle before this.  I tried to drop the brittle on the counter top to shatter it, but it turned out to be really easy to break by hand.  I will stick to 6 minutes instead of 7 next time on the first bake, because the peanuts get too roasted; we would have rathered them unbrowned.  I will also buy unroasted, raw peanuts next time; all I had on hand was the roasted kind.  Oh, and wash out whatever you cook the brittle in while it's still warm and soft!

This recipe impressed me!  I have always made peanut brittle on the stovetop and wasn't sure about 'cheating' in the microwave, but this turned out wonderful!  I made 4 batches in less than an hour!  I have a 1600 watt microwave and cooked it for 5.5 minutes then 3 minutes, and it turned out perfect, set up right away.  Thank you!

Easy, quick and delicious.  With a 1250 watt microwave I reduced the time to 4 minutes, then to two minutes after adding other ingredients.

OMG this was so easy! I can't believe it. I've tried making nut brittle in the past using traditional stovetop recipes and it always came out burnt tasting and greasy. This recipe was quick, super easy and it's perfect - tastes just like expensive gourmet brittle from the store. I used pistachios rather than peanuts, but otherwise followed recipe exactly. Thanks, this is definitely a keeper!

Loved this recipe but learned a few lessons making it.  1. You can't substitute Splenda for the sugar - not even 1/2 and 1/2.  It makes for a gooey caramel instead.  And 2.  If you get gooey caramel, it isn't the end of the world.  I rolled it up in balls then wrapped in candy wrappers and got huge raves and requests for my recipe for "nut caramels."  This one is well worth the time to make.

I just made the Peanut Brittle but changed it after the first try.  I made it with Splenda Brown sugar mix, added dark molasses with the light and it was great.  I am diabetic and will make this for years to come.  Thank you.

I've made this recipe several times now and it's AMAZING.  My mom's been making brittle the old fashioned way for a long time, but this is SOOOOO much easier.  I LOVE IT!  I like to use any other nuts but peanuts because they give my brother-in-law migranes.  All nuts work with this recipe.  Thank you Linda C.

This took 4 batches to be perfect, but it was fun to make and worth the effort. I'm sending a few batches to my husband in a care package, so we'll see how well it ships!

I have never made peanut brittle, I just went to the store and bought a candy thermometer, unfortunately it was before I read this very easy recipe.   After reading all of the reviews this is what i did.  I have a 900W micro, i cooked sugar & syrup for 4 min then added 1 cup dry roasted peanuts cooked another 2 min. then added the butter and vanilla cooked another 2.5 min. First tested in cold water - it was ready - then added the soda.  PERFECT!!

Made two batches for church bake sale.  Love this recipe - fast and easy and it tastes great. I use raw peanuts though so that I get better flavor transfer with no 'burnt' taste.  Highly recommend.

EXCELLENT!  EASY!  EXACTLY what I was looking for!  Even though the peanuts hadn't "browned" after the first 6 minutes I went ahead and stirred in the butter and vanilla & cooked 3 more minutes...added the soda and poured on the sheet.  It came out a perfect caramel color and was perfectly hard-crack!  Thanks for a great recipe I will make again and again!  :o)

Absolutely fabulous.  A winner everytime I've made it.  I just followed the time even though I have a 1000W micro - I do like the darker colour.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe - the grandchildren think I am a legend

This past Christmas, I put together a couple "food baskets" for some relatives as gifts.  After making soups-in-a-jar, brownies/cookies-in-a-jar, fresh fruit and so on, I thought this would be a nice addition.  I WAS SOOOO PLEASED with the results.  I myself am not a fan of peanut brittle but even I snatched a couple peices when this had cooled.  I did follow the advice of a few others and used less peanuts.

This recipe was really well received. I made this for my husbands job and it turned out great. I did take the advice of another reviewer and added the peanuts when the butter and vanilla was added in. And I had to adjust the cooking time. AWESOME RECIPE!!!!

I'm no huge fan of peanuts or connoiseur of brittle but I really liked this recipe! I misread the directions and only put 1/2 tsp of baking soda and it was fine. The second batch I trimed the peanuts down to 1 heaping cup and put the whole tsp and it tasted just like the first! (only less chunky) Very good! I greased a piece of foil on a cookie sheet and it made clean up a cinch. To clean the bowls I just ran hot water over them a while and it wasn't a problem. I've never made traditional brittle but this has got to be easier!! For my 1000 watt microwave I used the 6, 2 min combo. ***I just made a third batch that did not turn out well, not sure why! It was whitish instead of orange and chewy instead of crisp. I did everything exactly the same as before! Cooler weather? I don't know.

This is an amazing recipe.  Everyone that tried it loved it.  I did not know the watts of my microwave(but its fairly new) so I did 6 1/2 mins the first time and 2 minutes the following.  I will make for years to come.  Oh and be sure to soak your bowl right away or its a buger to clean

I made 2 batches of this wonderful peanut brittle this morning - 2 more to go for the 20 Christmas "goody" bags I am making for my husband's co-workers.  As other reviewers have commented, it is SO easy.  One mistake that I made that I would like to pass along - do not use a rubber spatula when mixing!!!  I just tossed out my treasured, heavy duty Pampered Chef spatula because the end melted.  A large wooden spoon worked out great for the 2nd batch.

This is awesome!! I made cashew brittle for the local sweets and treats booth and almost ate it all myself! Used 2 cups cashews. Micro for 3.5 min then stir very well. Cook another 3 min. Add butter and vanilla and do another 1.5 min. Perfect!!

The first time around, the peanut brittle caught fire in my microwave, set off the smoke alarm and made my apartment smell like burning hair after 4 minutes in the microwave. I had to halve the ingredients the second try and reduce the time in the microwave to 2 minutes. They taste great at first, but get chewy in the refrigerator. I'd suggest storing the leftovers in the freezer!

I just tried this recipe and think it would be great if I could find out how to adjust the cooking times.  My microwave is 1300 watts.  I was afraid of burning it but don't think I cooked it enough because it came of chewy.  Any suggestions for adjusting to a 1300 watt microwave?

With all the great reviews how could I go so wrong??? Used the 4 cup measurer suggestion but the syrup boiled over the top (and all over the bottom of my microwave!)  and after 5 minutes some of the sugar still hadn't dissolved in the bottom. Are you supposed to stir during cooking? It didn't get as brown as I thought it should but I had a heck of a time pouring it onto the tin foil and it just clumped onto my spoon. It also didn't foam after the soda. Now that it has cooled it's not real crispy and I'm not wild about the taste of the dry roasted peanuts. Cleaning the bowl is another story but the boiling water suggestion helped. I may try it again in a bigger bowl for a bit longer cooking time since so many have had success.

I've made this for the past 2 years and always get rave reviews and recipe requests. When I tell people how easy it is, they don't believe me. Here's a quick tip - I always mix single batches in a 4 cup glass measuring cup so that it's much easier to pour out when it's done.UPDATE: OK, I've now been making this for 7 years, and still get RAVES every time. People still don't believe me that is is super easy, so I'm considering just telling them it is really complicated and they shouldn't try it. See, I give it out at Christmas time to neighbors and friends, and then they'll think I worked really hard. In the end, everybody's happy!

I have been making these brittles for 4 years now
and I've never had a bad batch. 
I don't think it's possible to rate this recipe lower then 5 stars.  If you follow all the instructions it will never fail you.
Thanks Linda for this fantastic recipe. :)

I have a 1000 whatt microwave. I used the 7th power. Which is 70 percent. I cooked for 6 min with roasted nuts, then I cooked the mixture for 2 to 3 min and added the soda. I watched the mixture very close and when it started to darken and the nuts were also turning brown I added the butter and vanilla. Then cooked a little longer. The first time I tried peanut brittle I went through 6 batches, keep trying, once you get it right it will be worth it.

YAY for peanut brittle that tastes just like the kind you slave over on the stove all day but cooks in one bowl in the microwave with almost no stirring!  One note - watch you ratio of peanuts and be sure not to add any more corn syrup than called for or it will stay a little sticky when it hardens.

Don't quite know what went wrong.  Followed directions, but these came out VERY CHEWY, and not like peanut brittle at all.  Hate wasting food, so while prying the gooey mess off of the prepared baking sheet, was thinking of what I could do with it.  
Took both sides of the concoction and rolled them in toward the center.  Cut it in half, and forcefully pulled the mixture off pan.
Cut them in bite size pieces, then tried one.  Didn't taste horrid.  It was more like chewy nougat.  It turned out the hubby liked them.  Bought some semi-sweet chocolate chunks, melted them, and dipped the nougat to make miniature candy bars.  Very interesting way to make your own Baby Ruth bars.
Could it have been the weather??? It was a very humid day.

This recipe tastes very good. Only problem is that it turned out to be a lot more chewy than brittle, even after a few days.

Very good.  Followed the recipe exactly and everything turned out just fine.  Could use a little more "nutty" flavor but otherwise it is a very good recipe.

I've tried brittle recipes in the past and always ended up with a chewy mess.  I just about gave up making it but had a strong hankering for it last night.  I tried this recipe and it turned out great!  I'm glad for the other reviewers' comments as I found them very helpful (I covered my cookie sheet in foil and buttered it...also found that we liked the thinner pieces over the thicker ones.  Next time I do this I will spread it as thin as I possibly can!)

First time candy maker - impressed with how easy and delicious this recipe is.  I made six batches as Christmas gifts.  Some helpful tips I had read in other reviews:  Butter your baking sheet heavily; work quickly when pouring onto sheet; tip the sheet side to side to spread.

Yipeee!!!  What a fantastic recipe.  I'm not one for making my own confectionery, but this has me coming back for more,more,more.  Have even managed to give bags of it away as Christmas gifts for my son's Joey Scout leaders.  Thank you so much Linda.

Super recipe!  It went together quickly, and it was nice not having to even turn on the oven.  I made this for Christmas gifts this year instead of cookies--so much easier and a little different. One really nice thing about this brittle is that it is easy to eat, not too sticky or hard. I've gotten very good feedback, and we've eaten a bunch here too.

Here are a few things I can share about the recipe:

1.  I used honey roasted peanuts that were kind of sugary/salty to begin with.  I thought that they helped give it a stronger flavor throughout.  I'm sure regular cocktail peanuts work great too.

2.  I also had problems getting it to spread out as nicely as I would like.  After a few batches, I tried to thin it ith some water to see if it would help.  Did it work?  No! Don't alter the proportions...the batches that I added water to did thin out, but the consistency was too sticky/chewy later on.  The water seems to make it lose its texture.

3. Watch your microwave and adjust your times if necessary.  For some reason that I still can't figure, a few batches got a burned flavor from over nuking, even though I used the same timing with other batches with good results.

I am eating this wonderful candy as I write!!!  I made this for my mother because I don't like peanut brittle myself, but as I took a taste to see how it came out, I couldn't stop eating it!  It's so easy and wonderful.  However, if you're a novess at making this...really listen to the part where it says "GLASS" bowl.  I blew it off and wound up with the first batch eating through my favorite plastic mixing bowl and onto the counter top.

This is hands down the best recipe for peanut brittle! I had to adjust the time a bit because my microwave was higher wattage...but omg...WAY better than standing at the stove all day with a candy thermometer! This could be a bad thing...lol start to finish, eating in about 15 minutes!  I have a 1200 watt, so cooked on high for only 5 mins to start, added butter and vanilla, on high again for 2 mins 40 seconds, add b soda, pour, and bam! Done to perfection!

This is a great recipe.  Quick and simple.  I have a 1580W microwave, so I made some adjustments to the recipe...and it came out perfect!  Stir together and cook the sugar, corn syrup and pinch of salt for 2.5 minutes, stir in the peanuts (I only use 1c) and cook for 2.5 minutes, stir in the butter & vanilla and cook for 1.5 minutes, add the baking soda (I use 3/4t)and stir till frothy, then pour on parchment paper.  Let cook and break into pieces.  It is absolutely perfect and totally yummy!

Cook sugar and syrup for 6 mins in microwave and then add peanuts, butter, salt and vanilla and cook for 2-2.5 minutes more.  Warm pan in oven before spreading and spray Pam on pan so it's easier to spread.

Oh, gosh, this stuff is dangerous! I have a 1000 watt microwave, so I fiddled around with the time the first time I made this, and I didn't think there was a lot of taste to it, but I had to try it again. The second time, I followed MARIEZEE's review hints, plus added a bit more salt, and it is perfect and just too delicious! It is in the pantry calling my name right now! Can't believe it was so easy. Thanks, Linda C for the recipe, and MARIEZEE for the tips on how to make it with my microwave power.

OMG!!!  This is SOOOOOO good!!!  My very first brittle I've made.  I used the non-stick aluminum foil instead of greasing a baking/cookie sheet.  Once I spread the mixture on the foil, I put it in the refrig since I just couldn't wait long.  It turned out very good!

We also make numerous batches of this every year during the holidays.  Not sure where our recipe came from originally, but it has us stir after 4 minutes, cook 3 more minutes, then 2 minutes more after adding butter & vanilla.  Comes out perfect every time, no one can believe it was made in a microwave!

this recipe makes a delicious brittle and it was fairly easy. the hardest part was stirring the corn syrup, dash of salt, and the sugar together in the beginning :) I used my glass batter bowl and it was perfect - one 4 cups or larger is best. Here is the timing that worked in my 950watt microwave: heat just the combined corn syrup and sugar alone for 5 minutes, then add the butter, vanilla and peanuts (I used lightly salted, dry roasted) and then heat for another 3 minutes or a bit longer - you're going for a color similar to a brown paper bag. Stir in the baking soda and immediately pour onto a warmed (I kept mine in a heated oven while I microwaved), parchment-lined (buttered foil works, too) cookie sheet. Spreading the mixture can be a little tricky because the batter is kind of foamy and weird, but not very much spreading should be necessary if the cooking time is right and if your cookie sheet is heated, the brittle will spread into any little gaps that might happen when you spread. I put the cookie sheet on a cooling rack and then transferred the parchment with the brittle on it, directly to the rack after a few minutes to cool further.

This is a great alternative to the precision needed for stove top peanut brittle. Just make sure you watch your mixture closely as it cooks since microwaves are all a little different.

This is AMAZING!! My husband loves peanut brittle and has been wanting me to make some for years, but I had always heard it was very difficult. He loves this and says it tastes just like his mom makes (and she makes hers on the stove!)

Help! I have been making this for years but this year mine keeps turning out crunchy but slightly chewy - and sticks to the teeth!! Yikes! I've had to trash some batches, such a waste but can't risk my friend's fillings!
Thanks for any help!

I highly suggest you only make one batch at a time until you get the timing down for this recipe.  I came out with brittle that was more like taffy.  It taste good, but I really didn't want peanut taffy.

So glad I found this recipe. My friend has been making this  for years. It's so good, she had people fighting over the last bite.

It turned out a little bit burnt so I would decrease the cook time, other than that it was a little bit bland but overall a great recipe!

This recipe, AS WRITTEN, is not to my liking. I followed it to a T, and the brittle burned before it had been in the microwave for 3 minutes (I used my 700 W microwave on high). It mentions nothing about periodicly stirring the mixture while it is in the microwave. I would highly recommend reading through some of these reviews for suggestions and/or choosing another recipe altogether.

This is simply the best brittle I've ever tasted! Super easy & mess free. I followed Ateya from Youtube's cooking instructions: microwave peanuts [I used mixed nuts, a little over a cup], sugar, salt & syrup for 6 minutes. Add butter & vanilla, then microwave for 2 minutes. Finally add baking soda, mix well & pour onto pan. Enjoy!!!

This was so fast, easy and delicious...I'll definitely make this again. Made it in a 4-cup glass measuring cup. Omitted salt since I used 1-3/4 cups of salted cashews. For my 900 watt oven, I cooked 7 minutes on the first round, 3 on the second. Came out perfect. Thanks for a great, easy recipe.

excellent.  Cooking times are dependent upon your microwave oven wattage. Peruse other peoples' reviews for ideas on cooking times.

I was so disappointed after trying to make peanut brittle.  I can only guess that mine did not work because I did not cook it long enough in the microwave. My microwave says it is 1.65KW so I cut the time down to 4 minutes for the first round and 2 minutes for the 2nd round.  It was very chewy and didn't even come out brown colored like it's suppose to.  I absolutely love peanut brittle so I hated that it didn't work right. I will try it again and cook it at least 6 minutes.

I just made two batches with this recipe and they both turned out great!  I was worried since it was my first time making peanut brittle, but this recipe was pretty easy to follow.  It was kinda messy and hard to clean, but they're definitely worth it!

Tastes as good or better than "traditional"!  I also tweaked things a bit based on other's reviews, and mine turned out perfect the very first time.  I have an 1100W microwave and cooked as follows:  Sugar + Corn Syrup nuke 2.5 mins; then add nute and nuke another 2 mins; then add butter + vanilla and nuke another 1.5 mins.  Total cook time = 6 mins.

Love it! So easy & quick. I had to do 4 batches before getting it right. I did a few things differently...I found my perfect time in my 1100 watt microwave was 5 mins 45 seconds for the sugar and corn syrup, then added the butter, vanilla and 1 cup nuts and cooked for 3 minutes 30 seconds. I used butter to grease the pan. (At first I tried Pam and it was all I could taste, yuck!) I did heat the cookie sheet in the oven for a few minutes, and then spread  butter on it. I also used Pam to grease a spatula to help spread the brittle. This is a wonderful recipe and I will be making lots of it for Christmas! Thank you!!

Perfect!  I bake all the time.  This was my first attempt at Peanut Brittle.  It was so easy. I made NO changes to the recipe.  No watching the temp, no excessive stirring-  EASY!  My only issue was that when I poured it out onto my parchment paper- it was a little too thick, I couldn't spread it very well.  So, I put another piece of parchment paper on top and rolled it out.  This has been added into my favorite holiday recipes- I will be making it for many years to come.

yummy and easy. I used the tips for 1100 watt and it turned out great. One batch stayed chewy but I think it was due to not cooking long enough. :)

Just made this for Dad for Father's Day and he loved it! I followed Mariezee's tips for using a 1100 watt microwave and it came out beautifully. For those in Australia who, like me, cant find corn syrup, I used glucose syrup, which worked fine.

This is an excellent recipe for brittle. Makes clean up a breeze. I like to try it with different types of nuts. Have been using it for a long time. Tastes just as good as the stove top kind but takes half the time. Thanks for sharing it.

I will never use a different recipe again. I made two batches & they both came out great! I don't know what watt my microwave is, so I followed the directions & as long as you have that crack, it will harden. (Basically, if it is at a full bubbling stage, it is hot enough.) I put the dry roasted peanuts (not very salty, so I put more salt in to begin with) in with the butter & vanilla. The one thing I did find out is that you need an oven mitt or two, I burnt my finger spooning it out! Well worth it though! This is the bomb!

Mine didn't turn out, but I know it was because of my microwave and the humid day.  I can see why these are a hit if they do turn out - they are simple and quick.  But, it was disappointing to have to throw a batch away.

I've tried many, and this is exellent!  Microwaving makes it easier, and being able to use dry roast peanuts rather than the raw ones means I always have what I need on hand.  Thanks! (and my dad the peanut brittle fanatic thanks you!)  Tasted some Amish peanut brittle and it can't hold a candle to this.  I guess they are missing out not having microwaves and allrecipes.com!  :-)

This is a great recipe! And very easy!  I had to adjust the cooking time a little and I used mixed nuts rather than peanuts.  I'll definitely make this again!

This was SOOOO easy to make!! I love peanut brittle but never make it because it can be time consuming.  In about 10 minutes I had it cooling. It was fantastic!!

Most Excellent!!!  I made this and gave it out as Christmas presents for my family.  Its way better than store bought Peanut Brittle and very easy to make.  When it comes out of the microwave and you find out after trying to pour it on to a baking sheet that its too soft, just put it back into the microwave and cook it a little longer.

I'll NEVER make peanut brittle on the stove again!!  I LOVE this recipe!  I have an older microwave, so had to do the full 7 minutes, and it turned out perfect every time.  I made 5 batches over Christmas.

I cannot stop eating this! I used pecans because my daughter has a peanut allergy. I am sure it would be that much more fabulous with peanuts! I found this to be very simple to make! I will probably slightly adjust the cooking time next time, because I have a very slight burnt taste to my pecans. I actually don't mind it though!  This is delicious!  I wish I tried this one before Christmas!!!

Terrific!  I also have a powerful micro, so I did the 2.5 min, added the nuts, 2.5 min, and then another 1.5...perfect!  I couldn't believe how easy it was.  I did get scared of how rock hard the candy was getting on my bowl and utensils, but followed the advice of another reviewer:  boiled water and soaked everything for a few minutes and TA-DA! CLEAN!  Made a peanut batch and a cashew batch..half the company said the peanuts were best, half said the cashews were best...but EVERYONE said it was totally addictive.  Once you start, you have a hard time stopping!

I needed two attempts to make this--the first time I did not cook the cornstarch mixture long enough. The second attempt turned out well, but it was not the best tasting brittle I've had.

I am sad to say that I really struggled with this recipe and here is why - first, the glass bowl gets so hot in the microwave, you can hardly touch it when you take it out, much less quickly stir in the butter and pick it up to pour onto a cookie sheet. Yes, I used two oven mitts, but if both of your hands are holding the bowl, the candy is quickly hardening so you can't pour, and you have no hands to spoon the mixture out onto the cookie sheet. By the time you get a few scoops out onto the cookie sheet, the rest is hardened and unusable in the bowl. Second, I followed the recipe exactly, and my peanuts burned. It did turn out nice and brittle but when I took a bite, there was definitely a burnt taste. Considering the great reviews for this recipe, I truly do not know where I went wrong.

This i good an very easy, i made it cuz i did not have a thermometer, i have a 1500 watt microwave but i still had too cook it for as long as the recipe stated, and i got no burning.  I should have cooked it longer as it did not have that deep rich amber color.  Very good but i dont think ill make again.

Turned out fantastic. Just be careful to check the power of your microwave. If its stronger than 700W be sure to lessen the time the recipe calls for.

This is my type of recipe.  Quick, easy and tastey!  It worked out perfectly both times I made this (within three days. I used an 8 cup pyrex measuring cup as suggested and it worked just fine.

I bought a square of "Butter Peanut Crunch" and wanted to try a recipe to make the same. When I tried this recipe, the first time was an awful failure due to a 1300 watt microwave. I tried lowering the mic. time to 5:30 and lowered the power to 70% but it still came out dark and tasted burnt. I gave it another try the traditional way - on the stove and it turned out PERFECT! Better than the stuff I bought! It's so easy to use the stovetop instead, just start off mixing SUGAR AND CORN SYRUP ONLY and heating it until it bubbles slowly and when you dip a knife into it and let it drip into a bowl of cold water, the sugary dip can crack and can be chewed (crunchy) WITHOUT sticking to your teeth. At that point I mixed in the vanilla and butter. Once the butter melted I QUICKLY added the peanuts (otherwise they'll burn), stirred to incorporate, added the baking soda, stirred thoroughly and quickly and spread it out on the pan. It was a nice, light tan and it was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! You just HAVE to try this!!!

What a quick and unique recipe!  I make this just to have at home, but have also made it several times when I needed a quick thing to bring to a party or a homemade gift.  Everyone who has tried it has loved it, and they can't believe I make it in the microwave!  One thing I have found to be very helpful is to work VERY quickly when spreading the hot candy onto the cookie sheet, and to spread it as thinly as possible - if there are some "holes" or gaps in the candy, it doesn't matter!

The first time I made this I used an 8 cup measuring bowl and pretty much followed the directions.  Was great-crunchy, good flavor, etc.  The next time I tried the 4 cup measuring bowl as suggested by a reviewer, and I could NOT get it to turn brown or turn golden and it kept boiling over. The brittle was  a little sticky and the peanuts didn't taste as good.  So for me, the bigger glass cooking bowl was the key. I have an 1100 watt microwave. Those of you that had trouble with the 4 cup - try again with the 8 cup.  It is really good when it turns out right!

I used almond and it worked just as nice! This is easy and a great idea for gifts for teachers, co-workers and family. My sons like to break up the brittle after it's cooled and put it in tins for gifts for their teachers, I think they like sampling while they are packing them in the tins!

This is a great, fast and easy peanut brittle recipe.  I’ve been making it for a few years now, and it has come out perfectly every time.  I use the dry roasted peanuts from Trader Joes, but will experiment with different types of nuts and give it out for Christmas this year.

The best I evered tasted, you have to play with your microwave a few times to see how fast it cooks. It took me at least 3 times before I didn't burn the candy.

Easy and delicious! I took the advice of other reviewers and added the (dry roasted) peanuts after the first round in the microwave. Also took a minute or so off the cook time to compensate for my higher wattage microwave.

This rocked! Delicious and super easy! I was making a bunch of candy at the same time on Christmas Eve, and got a bit confused and thought I was supposed to put wax paper on the cookie tin where the brittle was to set. Bad idea. It totally stuck to the paper, so I had to throw the whole batch out. No problem though. It's so quick to make and has so few ingredients it was easy to whip up another batch. Second batch turned out perfectly. Decided to experiment a bit, so used the exact same recipe except omitted the peanuts and used almonds. Divine! Then tried w/ cashews- also very good. Then tried almond brittle again, but this time melted some choc chips in the microwave and spread the mixture on top for chocolate covered almond brittle. Also delicious. However, next time I will melt the choc chips on the stove rather than in the micro, because the consistency of the chocolate was a bit off and I wasn't personally impressed with the taste, but everyone else loved it. By far, the peanut brittle and the almond brittle were my personal favorites. Insanely tasty and unbelievably easy to make. Cleaning the glass measuring cup was a bit of a pain, but nothing to complain about. Great recipe!

This is AWESOME!!  I have been given cashew brittle for xmas as a gift but NEVER imagined how easy it is to make.  This recipe is great!!  The first time through was a good practice and I perfected it by try #2.  I have made this maybe 6 times in 2 days.  This is FANTASTIC!!!  PERFECT results!!  I have a powerful microwave and cooked it for 6 minutes---stirred and added ingredients and then cooked for 2 min 10 seconds more.  PERFECT!!  WORK QUICKLY after second heating as it cools and hardens amazingly quickly.  THANKS for the recipe!!

I made this with raw cashews, and it was positively heavenly! Use one of the silicone pan liners for incredibly easy clean-up! I used a large pyrex measuring cup with the handle, and it cleaned up beautifully with hot water!! Thanks for a great recipe!!

I was a little leary of making peanut brittle in the microwave but thought I would try it due to the large amount of others who did and gave it 5 stars.  It turned out abbsolutley wonderful !!!

This turned out perfectly, but I feel it should come with some warning labels. First, I'd definitely agree with the reviewer who said that this is too hot for children to work with. Even I burned myself when pouring the mixture out into the cookie sheet, which was difficult. However, once it had cooled and I'd broken it up, the finished product was heavily lauded. A great replacement for the store-bought peanut brittle we usually buy this time of year. I used the least amount of time possible (6 and 2 minutes) with my 700W microwave, and it was plenty. Also, I didn't have a big enough glass bowl, so I used a ceramic one. This is TOO HOT for plastic bowls. They will MELT. Was heavily raved about.

Unbelievable how easy this is! I trim 1 minute from each cycle, as I use roasted peanuts when making mine. Any longer and they burn. Also, if I want it a bit harder, I cut the baking soda back to 1/2 tsp. It's more difficult to spread, but I like the texture better.

Good quick recipe, but i think i like my old "over the stove" recipe a little better.  I was afraid about the baking times because i have a 1100 watt microwave, but went 6 1/2 min, then 2 min, and it turned out well.  Stuck to the pan a little, i would suggest greasing the pan very well, you can always wipe up excess grease after set.  Overall, a keeper when i want brittle fast.

This is the best recipe.  I started making it with crushed pecans and that will be the only way I make it from now on.  It is awesome and so easy.  I can kick those batches out in no time.

It took me a couple of tries but I finally succeeded.  It has a great flavor.  I didn't read many reviews before I made it and someone suggested heating up the cookiesheet to let the brittle spread thinner and I will definately try that the next time I make this.

I made four batches of this for holiday gifts for friends and clients and everyone is asking me for the recipe. It seriously took no time at all to whip up four batches. This is the easiest, yummiest treat ever. Tastes just as good, if not better, than anything you could buy from the store.

I love making this as part of my homemade Christmas "food basket" to my in-laws who happen to love peanut brittle. They have commented on how much better this is over the store bought brittle.  This recipe is so fast and easy and turns out every time once you get the time down for your particular microwave. I messed up on a few batches before I got it right. If it turns out like taffy, you need to cook longer. I use raw peanuts and microwave for 8 minutes, then 3 minutes. Turns out great!

This is the easiest and best brittle recipe ever!  Thank you.  I does get a little messy but the results are great.  I make it with a lot more peanuts so it really depends on how sweet/nutty you want.

This was so easy and so yummy. The kids (my taste testers) LOVED it. The only problem I had was that it was a little chewy. My mom thinks it is because I made them on a rainy day?!? Does that affect it any or did I do something wrong?!? Anyway, it tasted so yummy and after putting in the freezer to harden, it wasn't quite as chewy and I was able to break it up better. Thanks for such an easy and delicious recipe!! Definitely a keeper!!

My son and I made this and it was super easy and tasted great. My microwave is 1600 watts so we halved the time and it turned out perfect. Didn't have any light syrup so used dark. Couldn't tell any difference.

What can I say, other than WOW! So easy and so good!! I can't even begin to express how much I love this recipe! I had alot of unsalted peanuts ( bought on accident) and they worked out perfect. I also discovered with my second batch which didnt turn out quite as golden as I wanted that even if it's begun to get fairly hard you can pop it back in the microwave for a few minutes to brown it up, be careful though if you've already added the baking soda, you've got to watch it!!

After a couple of minutes in the microwave smoke started billowing out of the back.  I even had to throw away the container I put the ingredients in.  When I took the bowl out of the microwave it looked like a heap of bubbling tar!  Right after the microwave disaster I made the recipe via stovetop and it came out perfectly delicious.  I wouldn't recommend this recipe.

I've made this recipe several times, followed it exactly and I've made a great batch of peanut brittle everytime.  Once it's made no one can stop eating it!!  I even made it and gave it as a gift and received rave reviews.  Who knew peanut brittle could be so easy.  I love this recipe and the final result.  If only I could control myself once it's made so that I could make it more often!

This is so easy.  I didn't have peanuts, so I used slivered almonds.  So yummy.  A lot of the sugar mix did stick to the bowl and I couldn't get it out, so some went to waste, hence 4 stars.  I have now made this with peanuts many times, I up the peanuts to 2 cups and it's wonderful.  Very easy.

Great! Easy! Fast!
I ran out of corn syrup, and was short about 1/8 of a cup.  Substituted real maple syrup, and it worked beautifully!
Will make again and again.

I have to be honest and say that I was VERY leery about trying this recipe.  But I shouldn't have been! It was SO easy, took almost NO effort, and turned out wonderfully. I made two changes: I use golden corn syrup instead of light and blanched, salted peanuts instead of dry roasted. And it was amazing! I think next time I will try it with different nuts, maybe pecans.

I'm new to candy making of any kind, so this recipe was perfect for me.  I made it with regular peanuts (roasted with oil & salt) and it came out just fine.  After I ran out of peanuts I made it with pecans and walnuts, both of which tasted great.  Then I ran out of light corn syrup, so my last batch was with dark corn syrup and whole almonds, and this, too, was great. It's a wonderful recipe!

Easy and hard to mess up!  Make sure you scoop it out of the bowl as quickly as you can after adding baking soda, in order to make the most of your brittle.  My recipe is torn up because we've made this so many times.  It's a keeper for sure!!!

this is very easy.  I hadn't made peanut brittle before so I didn't know what it should look like right after being cooked.  I undercooked first batch( really chewy), I burned second batch (stinky!!).  After that each batch was perfect.  My microwave is 1000W it worked best to cook 5 min then 2 min after adding vanilla and butter.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Hokey smokes this was easy!  I used pine nuts instead of peanuts and got nothing but positive reviews from all tasters.  My only suggestion is WORK FAST because it gets sticky real quick.

This is so quick and easy.  I don't know why anyone would make it the old fashion way!  I was making it with peanuts but ran out and started using cashews and that was a huge hit!  I think I'll only make cashew brittle from now on.

Easy, fast, and delicious!  I made this recipe twice.  The first time I paused the microwave once curing cooking to stir it.  This batch turned out lighter in color and slightly chewy.    The second time it was darker (color of peanut butter) and more brittle.  I preferred the second batch.

Shazaammm!  Worked the first time!  After reading the other reviews, I waited to add the nuts (whole almonds) following 3 minutes of cooking on high.  Reduced soda to scant 3/4 tsp.  Also used the cold water test mentioned to confirm we had reached the hard ball stage.  Looking forward to trying other nut combinations, and perhaps a layer of chocolate!

Wonderful flavor and wonderfully easy!!!
Everyone that's tasted this absolutely loved it, and those who have asked for the recipe are in awe at the ease of making it.  Thanks for another keeper
BTW---I have an 1100 watt microwave oven, and I had to make a couple of batches to adjust the time, mine came out perfect at 4 minutes for the first cooking time, and then another 1 1/2 minutes after you add the butter and vanilla.  The brittle is also easiser to chew if you let it set for a long time.  I make it at night, then eat it the next day.

I am not a peanut brittle fan and have never made it before, but my husband was requesting it and we had the ingredients so I thought, why not? This was super easy to make and looked like peanut brittle to me, my husband liked it and ate it all, but he did say, isn't peanut brittle supposed to be orange?  Hmmmm, not sure on that one. Overall this is an easy fun recipe I would recommend.

Very good, fast, easy, mess free (mostly) recipe! The brittle didnt turn out as dark as when i make it using the old fashioned way, boiling it for hours on a stove, but it tasted nearly as good. Getting the bowl clean of the brittle mixture tho... ouch. Had to soak that puppy for hours, just like the pot when you do it the old fashioned way.

Could not be any easier!  Love this recipe (a person who tried it said they loved how it didn't taste "burned" like some brittles do).  I have an 1100 W microwave, but followed directions others suggested: first round 6 minutes, second round 1 minute.  I used salted peanuts and left out the salt in the recipe.  Perfect fit to be cooked in my 4 cup measuring cup, and I poured the brittle onto my Silpat (silicon baking sheet) rather then buttered cookie sheet.  Popped off easy as pie!  Only problem is that it's eaten so quickly, I keep having to make more! (I don't tell anyone it's microwave, let them think I sweated over a candy thermometer)

I tried this recipe twice - maybe its me, but I could not get it right and did not want to waste any more ingredients trying again.  The first time I cooked it 6 minutes and then the 3 minutes.  It did not quite get hard enough - chewy and sticks to your teeth.  The second time I cooked it 7 minutes and then the 3 minutes and it almost burned.  I will look for another microwave peanut brittle recipe.  Thanks anyway.

This was good for a microwave recipe. It wasn't as buttery rich as I was hoping for but it has a good taste. I tried to be smart about it and line my tray with greased wax paper before pouring the mixture to cool. Don't do this! The candy fused them together like you wouldn't believe and is now an extra serving of roughage for my husband.

Quick and easy!  It took me a couple of times to get the time on my microwave right.  A similar recipe from a friend breaks the microwave times up and that works better.

This is by far the easiest candy recipe I have ever made.  The ease of preparation makes it a "fun" recipe to make.  I do not have small children anymore in the house but my first thought was how dangerously hot the mixture gets and how a person should be very careful.   I liked the texture and taste of this candy.

This is the best brittle my husband and I have ever eaten.  I did change the recipe a bit though. Instead of peanuts I use salted mixed nuts, and add them in along with the butter and vanilla.  I have all my family, friends, and coworkers asking for my mixed nut brittle.

Linda C.  This recipe is marvelous.  I don't have a candy thermometer and have, therefore, not have a whole lot of success "just winging it".  This is such an easy and delicious recipe.  I made three batches in an evening and will be giving it for Christmas.  Plan on making MORE!! Thanks!

I'll never use the traditional pan method again!  This recipe works perfectly with the microwave.  It's comes out identical to the traditional version and is so much faster.  My only advise is to be very careful pouring the boiling candy onto a cookie sheet, and allow the empty bowl to soak for a while.  The hardest part of the recipe is cleaning up the empty bowl.  This a wonderful recipe!

I was a little afraid to try this one as I have been making peanut brittle for Christmas for the 
pasted 20 years on top of the stove which takes around a hour or so and after making around
20 batches over 3 days I only make it at Christmas.  I tried one batch and couldn't belive how
fast and easy it was.  It turned out great, I'll never make it the old way again.  I did double the

This was a wonderfully easy and delicious recipe.  Make sure to work quickly when pouring out your candy, and get your bowl into hot soapy water ASAP.  This is a great recipe to have kids help with.  They can easily perform each step, but be sure an adult does the pouring.  The candy is VERY hot!

Delicious. I have had no problems with burning. This recipe is very easy and reveals a delicious candy! Be careful of the candy when it comes out of microwave it's extremely hot and sticky and can cause burns easily.  I use a buttered rubber spatula to spread it on aluminum foil buttered cookie sheet.  I've also made this with cashews which is my favorite way.  Thanks for this great recipe. My husband is a big fan and also thanks you!!

Wow! First time making it & my boyfriend loves it! I ate about 4 pieces and I'm not even a huge sweets person. I have a 900 watt microwave so I lowered the power to 7 (I think it's 70%) and zapped it for 6 min for the first part and 2 mins for the second part just to be safe and not burn it. After about 30 mins of cooling off it was hard enough to break easily. The  brittle was not rock hard like normal brittle but it was hard enough and a little chewy but we liked it like that. Next time I'll experiment with cooking to max time to see if I can  get  that classic super hard brittle so I can make some as gifts.  Great easy recipe so glad I don't have to make it the old fashioned way anymore! Worth a try.

So easy - I highly recommend this method, just for how simple it is. My microwave is 1000 watts, and I cooked on 70% power for exactly 8 minutes, took it out, added the butter and vanilla and then continued  to cook for another 3 minutes at 100% power before adding the baking soda. I lined my baking sheet with Reynolds® Non-Stick foil, and it worked perfect. After dumping the mixture onto the non-stick foil, I held the sheet up and tilted it one way, to s-t-r-e-t-c-h the mixture, and then tilted it the other way to s-t-r-e-t-c-h it the other way. Worked great! Will make this one again and again. Oh, and I also used oiled salted peanuts that I picked up at the farmer's market (in bulk area), so I did not add the optional salt. ;)

This has been my go to recipe for brittle for a few years now and always happy with the results. I do make this a few different ways, but my most common change is 2 tsp vanilla bean paste, I use a pinch OK I use about a 1/8 tsp kosher salt and 1 Tbsp. + 2 tsp. butter.  I also cook it 6 min then 3 mins... 
I have also toasted the peanuts then added them to the mix for the last 3 mins. still works out great and the flavor is more enhanced.

I'm wasn't going to rate it, the error is probably mine. I followed the directions on the the video and the only thing I did different was to use pecans. But for some reason it's not getting hard, it's the consistency of taffee . 1st time I have ever tried to make it in the microwave. Will have to try again, maybe needs to cook more. I had read the other reviews and was afraid it would burn in my 900W oven. I should have done what I thought and used my candy thermometer to be sure it had reached 250' next time I know better.

Made this microwave Peanut Brittle today using Spanish Peanuts. Read all the reviews first so I would know all the tips an tricks.  Much better then store bought an this was my first time making this candy. Love it so much I have to stop going in my kitchen for more!  Will be making at Christmas time for gifts. Mine did not burn but I did keep a close eye on the candy while it was cooking. My microwave is 1000Watts, cook time used 3:30, 2:30 and 1:30 mins.
Will recommend and make at Christmas. Thank You for submitting Linda C.

While the candy itself tasted delicious, it never hardened. It became impossible to get out of the cookie shee. I've made candy for years and decided to try this alternative method, but I had no luck. I might try reading through all of the reviews to pick up some tips and tricks from others to give it another shot. Hopefully it will turn into real, hard brittle next time.

This was the best and easy peanut brittle recipe.  My husband and I did add a little more corn syrup. Just make sure once you add the baking soda stir quickly and pour it's sets up super fast. We have ours as gifts for christmas.

Very good brittle! I used dark corn syrup instead of light (because thats all I had) and it worked fine. I microwaved the sugar and syrup 3 min, the peanuts for 3 min, then the butter and vanilla for 1 min. No salt. Turned out great tasting and brittle, as expected.

Tried the traditional method..  eek. This method, Perfect!! Followed the advise a few comments below for a 900 watt microwave and it was a success! I also sprayed the upper half of the Pyrex glass with cooking spray just before pouring as others suggested and it came right out no problem!

Delicious and quick, I love that its a microwave recipe instead of making on stovetop, However it may be trial and error choosing the right amount of minutes to cook brittle depending on your microwave power. The suggested time was too long for the powerof my microwave so my brittle was a little donner than I would have preferred still tasted good, so this time I cooked for less time, turned out perfect!

just made this and it came out perfectly. I took some of the suggestions: I cooked it for 4 minutes without the nuts because I was using roasted, then 1.5 minutes with the nuts then 1 more minute with the butter and vanilla. The only suggestion I wouldn't use again is to warm up the pan before spreading, I thought I ruined the batch when it seem to keep cooking on the warm pan. I also used a silpat sheet and then put the whole pan out in the snow to cool it down and it was ready to eat in 10 minutes.

The ingredients are the same as the old microwave brittle recipe I'd lost.  I'm glad I found it again!  One big caveat, though--if you put the peanuts in at the beginning, you will very likely burn the nuts.  I (and others, too, I see) recommend cooking the sugar/syrup/salt mixture for about five minutes before adding the peanuts.  Let the whole thing cook about another 3-5 minutes before putting in the vanilla and butter.  Also, I like to use sea salt or, at the least, kosher salt.  Other than that, I think this is an excellent recipe.

I burned the first batch. I have a 950 watt micro, so I changed the cooking times to: 4 minutes for the syrup & sugar. Added the peanuts, cooked for about 1 minute 20 seconds. Added butter & vanilla, cooked for 1 1/2 minutes, then added the soda. I also stirred it about 3 times during the first 4 minutes. Turned out perfect! will make this again.

My aunt had a microwave recipe with much more "handling," pulling it out of the microwave multiple times. This was 2 times and DONE. Super EASY, very fast. I didn't grease my Wilton baking sheet. It wasn't necessary. Also used a wooden spoon. Don't use plastic utensils. Used my OV-GLOVES and no problems! VERY tasty! Nice light & fluffy/brittle consistency! YUM.

I couldn't believe how easy this recipe was. Excellent texture and taste. I make chocolates a couple of times a year and sell them to some of my clubs, getting rave reviews.  I'm always looking for new candy recipes.  You can bet this peanut brittle will be one of my new specialties.

I think this is a lovely, easy recipe. My sugar didn't melt all the way, but I don't think it matters. What does matter: I can't stop eating it. Thanks!!!!

This is a great recipe! I made it for my second grade class' Chrsitmas party. I got lots of requests for the     recipe from the moms. I doubled the baking soda so that it wouldn't stick to the kids' teeth. Loved it!

I make more than a dozen batches of this every year during the holidays. We've moved and have a different microwave this time, but one batch was all it took to tweak the times so it turned out right. This is a fast, easy recipe and a HUGE hit a cookie exchange parties!

GREAT recipe, I burned the fist batch so lowered the cooking time for the second batch, reduced the amount of baking soda and put the peanuts in with the vanilla and butter.  Also added another TBSP of butter.

The first batch I made according to the instructions also came out chewy instead of like hard candy.  The second batch I made, I used my candy thermometer between each 3-5 minute time-frames.  Stirring it each time and checking it out.  I cooked it to a hard ball stage 260 degrees and it worked much better.  I aso added 2 teaspoons of butter instead of one.

I wish I had this recipe years ago!  It is so simple and sooooo yummy! Just like what I have made in the past by stirring and stirring, but with almost no effort!  I did take the idea of lining the pan with foil, and it was a charm!  And I also doubled the recipe and put it in a bigger glass bowl.  I will be making THIS alot! Thanks for sharing!

I used coarsely chopped cashews instead of peanuts and it was incredible.  I suggest watching this very carefully since every microwave is different.  This will be my go-to recipe for brittle.

I made this for my daughter's wedding.  I made so many batches I feel like an expert.  Here is what I found.  Follow the recipe.  I tried pecans which are too moist a nut and the recipe turned out mushy.  I tried cashews with a 50/50 result.  Some cashews were dry enough others were too moist.  Peanuts always worked.  I definately purchased a handled mixing bowl at a super store...This is a must!  Take the minute to check your microwave power adjusting the cooking time might be necessary.  Good luck and be safe.

I can't believe I actually made my own peanut brittle and it turned out AMAZING, lol!!!!! I followed the recipe to a T with the exception of omitting the optional salt. For my microwave I cooked it for 6 minutes and then 2-1/2 minutes and that worked perfectly. I made 2 batches and I'm glad I did cause we can not stop eating it! I will be making this tons for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)

This brittle turned out great! I didn't have any peanuts so I used macadamia nuts instead, and it turned out just as good! A perfect time for me was first 3 minutes with the sugar and syrup. Then I added the nuts, and microwaved it for 2 minutes. I added the butter and vanilla extracts, then cooked that for 1 minute. Finally, I added baking soda and gently stirred it and poured it on a baking sheet. Also, a good tip is everything you add new ingredients, make sure to stir around before putting it back in the microwave.   Thanks for this great recipe! Very easy and delicious!

This peanut brittle is amazing.  Every time I make it (which is fairly often) people go absolutely crazy for it, and everyone assumes that I must be some sort of candy pro.  One thing to watch out for is that every batch cooks up slightly differently - I pay close attention to the smell of it to stop it cooking before it gets too dark.  Recently I started using macadamia nuts instead of peanuts for special events, and they work just as well, and definitely have a "wow" factor for people eating it.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yum! This was a big hit during the holidays. Made a Cashew Coconut and it was a favorite. Beware: you will need to experiment with a few batches for cooking time. My Microwave was pretty in line with directions and it is 1000 watts, not 700. IMO adding the nuts in the beginning works best if you are using raw.

Here's what worked with our 850 watt microwave: 7.5 minutes on high for 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup corn syrup; add 1.5 cups roasted salted peanuts, 1 tsp butter, 1 tsp vanilla and microwave 1.5 minutes.  Add the 1 tsp baking soda, stir it in, then as fast as you can pour it out (with the help of a buttered spatula) onto a tin-foil lined pan.  We did a second batch in which we then tossed a bunch of chocolate chips on top, put the tray in the oven to warm up the chocolate for a few seconds, and then spread out the melted chips into a layer of chocolate on top.  Both batches are great. This is an easy, not expensive way to make a gift.  We didn't have any candy making experience and would definitely try again after this success.  Also, if the mixture is stuck to your bowl, just let it soak and the sugar will dissolve or break right off later.  Buttering the bowl and utensils before making the recipe did help with removal.

I used to make this in college YEARS ago!  So glad to have found the recipe again!  Thanks to those who included the following tips in their ratings:  Spray the bowl and spatula with non-stick spray.   Warm the cookie sheet in the oven on a low heat (200).  This allows you to spread the mixture out a litte more for a thinner brittle.    Awesome recipe and hints.  Great gift!  Blessings to all!

Such an easy recipe! Next time I think I'll just use 1 cup peanuts rather than the 1 1/2, but that's just personal preference. Turned out great!

This is a very easy recipe to make.  Keep your eye on the brittle as it can burn very easily if you leave it in too long.

I'm just rating the microwave method since I used cajun seasoned pumpkin seeds instead of peanuts- it came out sweet and spicy and SO good!!!  I will definitely do again with peanuts!  I've had mixed results with candy making, but this is fool proof!  Just have to adjust time to your micro wattage, and keep an eye on it THE WHOLE TIME.  I did the whole thing in my big pyrex measuring cup, easy to measure and micro in one container, it's easy to watch since it's clear, plus the handle doesn't get hot.  My microwave is 1600w... full power, I did sugar + syrup for 3.5 mins, stirred in pumpkin seeds and micro 2.5 mins more, added butter and vanilla micro 2.5 mins, then removed and stirred in baking soda.  Took the advice to spread out onto the back side of a buttered cookie sheet and this worked great!  Let sit 5 mins, then in frige for 5 more and broke it up.  The hardest part about this recipe is not eating it all in one sitting!

This came out a lot darker than the picture but that's probably because I threw everything in all at once except for the baking soda.  Opps.  Also, didn't have nuts so used a half cup of peanut butter.  Tastes good though and my dog likes it too.

1st time ever making peanut brittle! it was easy and kind of fun! I TRIED to balance out the amount of sugar by also using soy beans and edamame beans with the peanuts. It was multi-colored: light brown, toasted brown, green and toasty and it was delicious!

This is the best! So yummy. There is a significant "fear factor" with this one because I was always trying not to burn myself and not break my glass, but all turned out nicely, and I didn't burn myself. Not having to use a candy thermometer was a bonus!

Once you figure out the right amount of cooking time for your particular microwave this recipe is the easiest thing you will ever make. A few suggestions to help make it easier: use a glass measuring cup with a handle, a silicone spatula, have everything ready. That means all ingredients measured, surface ready to pour it on and hot water to put your equipment in when your done.

I can't believe all the rave reviews about this recipe. I was suspicious that the microwave cooking would make the mass unmanageable, but I underestimated what would happen.  Using the words "stir" and "pour" in the directions is a great joke - there is nothing that will move or control this epoxy - I think all the kitchen tools I used will have to be thrown away.  Surely someone else has had a disasterous experience with this recipe.  I am known as a really good cook and I have done some really difficult things, but this is more like an insider joke than a real recipe.

The best! My husband has a much more time consuming family recipe that he has made for years. He didn't even want to try this quickie version. He reluctantly did and it came out perfect. Good bye family recipe, hello brittle in minutes! Perfect for gift giving. At the holidays, friends actually request it ~ usually with the nut of their choice... LOL!

This was so awesome and so incredibly easy! To experiment I did a half batch in my 2 cup glass measuring cup.  (3 mins & 2 mins in the microwave) My grandmother slaved over the stove for years making peanut brittle for Christmas.  I just kept thinking "poor Grandma, if only you'd known how easy it could've been..." :)

This is so quick and easy to make! You do need to experiment with the times for your microwave first.  I kept a cup of ice water ready and made sure it hardened too the hard ball/crack stage before adding the baking soda

I made this today for the first time.  Couldn't believe how easy it was.  I followed the recipe exactly (using 6 minutes for the initial cooking, then 3 minutes for the second "nuking") and was very happy with the finished brittle.  Very crunchy and no burnt taste! 

Although it does make a small batch, there is practically no effort involved it's that easy.  Followed some of the recommendations from previous reviewers: a Pyrex measuring glass bowl (mine was 8-cup), preheating the greased baking sheet to make the spreading easier, and using unsalted dry peanuts.

It'll be great for gifts this Christmas.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the best recipe for peanut brittle that I have ever made! I made a few lbs. of it and brought it to work and everyone loved it so now I make it and sell it! I have made and sold over 70 Lbs. so far and it's only been 2 months! I also make it with almonds and cashews!

Very easy and delicious.  Added extra baking soda, an extra teaspoon, to make it more brittle than chewy.  Also tried using Virginia Peanuts, turned out great too.  Had a much highter wattage microwave to work with so cut back times, per other reviews.  Husband grew up with lots of homemade candy at Christmas, nice compromise for a non-seasoned candymaker--more of a baker.  Live in Wisconsin, stores beautifully in garage with other Christmas goodies throughout the holiday season.

Very good and easy. Not my favorite peanut brittle recipe but the easiest and tastiest for the effort put in. If you want peanut brittle with out all the time over the stove this is the recipe.

I've made this recipe twice the first time using mixed nuts and the second time using peanuts and honey instead of corn syrup. I Used tips from other reviewers, adding the nuts with butter and vanilla and it turned out perfect both times.  My family loved it!

This was my first attempt at making peanut brittle.  As suggested by others I used a 4-cup glass measuring cup which made making this even easier.  Turned out very good.  I will be making this again.

Love it!! Quick and easy turned out perfectly. I did substitute Honey Roasted peanuts instead of dry roasted and added about 1/8tsp of salt to offset the additional sweetness.

This was great!  The suggestion to cook it in a huge measuring cup was very helpful.  I tried doubling once and it ending up burning terribly, I'm not sure why.  I stopped using the butter on the fourth batch and it tastes just as good!

This is a wonderful recipe! I had to reduce the time in the microwave to 5 minutes and then 1 additional minute after adding the butter & vanilla. I guess my microwave was too hot; but once I made that adjustment, this is a simple, delicious recipe for peanut brittle. Even finicky peanut-brittle lovers love this! Thanks for the recipe.

All I can say is "WOW"!  This is an amazing recipe - the peanut brittle turned out perfectly.  I cooked the sugar and corn syrup (with pinch of salt) for 6 minutes; added the peanuts with the vanilla and butter, and cooked for 2 minutes.  I quickly added the baking soda - and placed on pam-sprayed parchment paper on my cookie sheet.  This will be a new Christmas tradition.  Thanks for sharing Linda.

I couldn't believe peanut brittle was so easy to make!  My microwave is 1200w, so I used 60% power and poured the cooked mixture onto parchment paper instead of greasing a pan.  Have already made 3 batches as part of my holiday baking(recipe doesn't really make much).

This recipe has earned a rightful place on my Coolest Things Ever list.

I tried this on a whim last night when I was looking for something quick and easy but still tasty with a "wow" factor to give to some coworkers as a Christmas gift, and this certainly fit the bill. Who knew making a nut brittle could be so easy? I made a couple of adjustments: 1)I'm allergic to peanuts and can't handle them, so I used sliced almonds instead and added them after the initial 6 minutes of cooking time; 2)I didn't have corn syrup (thought I did when I decided to make this recipe) so using someone else's suggestion I used a 75/25% ration of honey to water, but used equal parts honey and maple syrup instead of all honey - made the finished product taste very natural and not overly sweet; 3)Again, following someone else's suggestion I heated up my parchment-paper-lined baking sheet in the oven for a few minutes while the brittle was in the nuker to make ti easier to spread. It still came out a bit thick in the middle but I think using the sliced almonds contributed to that - next time I'll use slivered or whole, or just use less almonds. Seriously though, GREAT recipe, and I will definitely be making and experimenting with this in the future (especially since my bf nearly cried when I told him I was giving most of it away as gifts! Gotta make another batch this weekend!)

Easy, but did not get harden like it should have.  I used another reviewers advice and put tinfoil on cookie sheet and sprayed with cooking spray.  Bad idea.  Now a couple of days later the brittle has been in the fridge and is chewy.  It has good flavor but not hard and crunchy like should be.

Very easy to make and it turned out great. I even did it on my lunch hour when I went home!  After reading the reviews, I waited to add the peanuts in with the butter and vanilla.  A lot of reviews said the peanuts tasted a little scorched.  I had a glass bowl with a handle to it was easy to lift and pour.

Easy to make and very tasty. I used a Pyrex   bowl and microwaved the mixture to a hard ball stage. ( 7 min ) Stirred in the butter and vanilla, then cooked for 2 more minutes. Added the baking soda. Dumped the mixture onto a buttered cookie sheet. I let it cool 20 minutes and then broke it up into pieces. Freezes well.

I actually made this last week when I found this recipe posted on another site.  It is GREAT!  So easy and comes out perfect!  My boyfriend didn't believe that I made it; thought it was store bought.  I will make this again and use the suggestion below to add a layer of chocolate.  YUM!  Highly recommend...

I can't believe how good and easy this recipe was! I didn't think that it could turn out so crunchy since it was microwaved, but it's fantastic. I can't wait to try it with different nuts. With my 750W microwave I cooked it for 6 minutes the first time and 2:15 the second time. I also took the advice of other reviewers and used the 4 cup pyrex measuring cup - it made it super easy!

This is the SECOND time I have tries this recipe, seeing as how so many people have given it 5 stars... the first time I couldn't get it out of the cookie sheet, which I did grease beforehand, so I tried a different sheet... I was able to get it out this time, but only to find it soggy and chewy.  It's called peanut BRITTLE... SHOULDN'T IT BE BRITTLE?!  I've been cooking for years and know that I followed the recipe exactly, both times... I won't waste any more energy (or ingredients) on a third attempt.  DOUBLE BOO!!! ;(

I found this receipe here a couple of years ago and have been making it ever since.  Makes a lovely gift in a Christmas tin - and people love it!  Took some time to get the microwave "times" right in my machine, but well worth the effort.

I wasn't sure about this recipe since it used dry roasted nuts instead of the raw, spanish type.
I added a little more vanilla than it called for to make it more like my Mom's, but that was the only change.  It turned out fantastic. Super easy and so yummy.  It's on my official list of Holiday recipes!

Made a batch last nite used raw peanuts instead of dry roasted and salted.  It came out great.  I will make it to give as gifts this year.  Gonna try to make some with almonds and cashews too.

I made two batches of this tonight. My first time ever making peanut brittle and I followed the recipe exactly but did do 2 tablespoons of butter as suggested by another. My microwave is 1000 watts so I put it on 70% power for 7 minutes then 3 minutes and it came out good but the taste was missing something. The second batch I did the same but added the salt along with the vanilla and upped the butter to 3 tablespoons. I did up the cooking time the first go around to 8 minutes and did pull it out with about 3 left to stir. Cooked the last part the same, 3 minutes and this batch turned out SO much better tasting than the first. Very easy and will make a regular in my holiday cooking!

I've been making this delicious recipe for years - many batches at Christmas time.  I usually use 1 cup of raw spanish peanuts, though, and add 1/4 teaspoon salt.  It's very easy but definitely have the pan and all of the ingredients ready before you start.

After reading some of the other comments, I replaced the almond extract with another teaspoon of vanilla. It's fabulous. I have committed this one to memory.

Wow! This is the best peanut brittle that I have ever had! I was skeptical at first about making it in the microwave but I followed the recipe almost exactly (I added two tablespoons of butter for more buttery flavor)and cooled it on parchement paper for easy cleanup.  From start to finish, it took only minutes to make and my family devoured it! I did take it out of the microwave once during cooking to stir so that the sugar melted evenly. This recipe is a keeper...I'm planning on making more to give as Christmas gifts!

This recipe was extremely easy and the texture was perfect. The brittle lacked the depth of flavor of traditional peanut brittle. It is good but not "just as good" as the author claims.

Very good and easy to make.  My husband has eaten almost the entire batch!  I used parchment paper on my baking sheet and it made for an easy release and clean up.  I will definitely make this again.

Very easy to make and the results are wonderful.  I have used dry panuts, honey roasted, cashews, almonds and hazlenuts and they all come out fine.

O MY GOD YUM!
This actually turned out more like peanuts with chewy caramel, not hard at all unless it has just come out of the fridge. But that was fine by me!
I offered this to everyone, family, friends, colleagues. They all looked at it and said "oh no i can't..." a little persuasion and then i couldn't keep them away. They all came back for seconds and thirds and.... you get the drift! 
I dont actually remember the cooking times that i used, i do know it was much less than that described. (I do have a 1200W microwave!) 
Thanks for the fantastic recipe:)

I did this with cashews for fathers day-it took a while to master the time on my microwave (3 attempts) and I used honey instead of corn syrup--very good.

This is incredibly easy to make and a real crowd-pleaser.  People who don't really like peanut brittle love this peanut brittle (myself included).  I use mixed nuts instead of just using peanuts.

This was so easy to make and it tasted wonderful.  I couldn't find corn syrup here in the UK (though I'm sure there is something similar) but was able to buy some from Ebay.  The first batch was made according to the directions.  The second batch was changed up a bit.  I put 1 cup of peanuts and 1/2 cup of rough chopped pecans.  I also added just shy of 1/4 tsp almond extract and just shy of 1 tsp vanilla extract.  My husband loved it and I'm sure there will be any left to share with friends :)!

FANTASTIC!!!! I can't believe how easy it was. I read some reviews before and they were helpful to remind to look at your microwaves wattage. I am on my second batch ( and gonna keep going until I run out of ingredients). I didn't even burn my first batch. I have never made peanut brittle before, I always thought it would be too hard to make. This is great and I will definately give this recipe out. Thanks for posting it, it is wonderful!

So simple to make, but you need to check the wattage on your microwave and adjust your timing accordingly.  Took me 3 tries to get it right.  My microwave is 1100 watts and I cooked for 4 mins (instead of 6-7), then 1 1/2 mins(instead of 2-3).  Thanks - this is a keeper.

Delicious....and SO EASY.  I don't have a candy thermometer...and wanted to make this.  So glad that I found this recipe on here.  I tried another microwave peanut brittle recipe from this site....but I like this one better.  The measurements are just a little different....and it is just too easy.  Definately going to use this recipe again.  Thanks for the post.

I made this peanut brittle for my family and everyone loved it! My husband said I'm not allowed to make it again because he can't stop eating it and he's afraid of getting fat. It was so easy! I was a little afraid that the Pyrex bowl I cooked it in would never come clean, but I just soaked it in hot water for a few minutes and it all came right off. I will definitely make this again and again.

Pay attention to instructions! I managed to put a hole in my mom's hand-me-down 30-year-old Tupperware, but I wanted new stuff anyway :-)  I did get one good batch that tastes great, like it was bought from a candy store. I can't wait to see my family ask for the recipe and surprise my grandfather for father's day.  Peanut brittle is one of his favorites.

The first time I tried to make this I didn't cook it long enough.  I was afraid I would burn it and it turned out very chewy.  I didn't give up and tried a 2nd time and cooked it for 6 minutes and then 2 minutes and it worked perfect.  My friend loved it and he's quite the brittle critic.   It's so easy.  Great Recipie

THIS RECIPE IS THE BEST THING THAT HAS EVER BEEN DISCOVERED. I MADE IT FOR THANKSGIVING AND NOW PEOPLE WANT TO BUY IT BY THE POUND FROM ME. IT'S THE EASIEST THING AND TASTES ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. I USED ALMOND EXTRACT INSTEAD OF VANILLA AND IT ADDS AND EXTRA TOUCH. I HOPE YOU ENJOY THIS ONE!

EXPERIMENTAL FUN!! The first two times I made this it wasn't much chop. I burnt it. Then forgot the soda. It was so much fun, tho. I felt like a child making candy and just having a blast in the kitchen. Considering this is the first time I've ever tried to make Peanut Brittle, a few failures were a certainty. The trick with my microwave is because it's 1000W is to put it on Medium High. Third time's the charm. And, it tastes lovely. I didn't use the baking sheet as the first two times the brittle stuck to it even tho I had sprayed it with light cooking oil. A plain tray sprayed with oil works fine and I followed another reviewers advice and used 3/4 honey 1/4 water as a substitute for the corn syrup. I'm gonna have funnnn making this one all the time. Thanks Linda!!

I had never made peanut brittle before but really wanted some.  I read over some of the reviews and was motivated to make it.  I could not believe how easy it was.  I thought it tasted great.  Thanks, I will be sure to pass this one along to friends and family.

My father-in-law is a peanut brittle fan.  I made 2 of these this for his father's day present.  1 using peanuts, 1 using cashews.  Put it in an enourmous jar and it looked (not to mention tasted) amazing.  What a great gift, thanks for such a great recipe!

Wow!! So easy, yet so good!  I made this and put it in pretty decorative tins for Christmas gifts for my husbands many relatives.  Everyone went on and on about how good it was.  To keep it from sticking I lined the pan with Reynolds non-stick foil, and the brittle came right off.

This candy is excellent!  I made it for all the candy baskets I handed out as Christmas gifts this year and everyone loved it.  I've never made candy before because I've always been intimidated but this is so quick and easy.  A must-try for anyone!

I rated this recipe back in 2002 with 5 stars. I have since bought a new microwave, have made this with cashews, pistachios, etc. and this is still the best recipe I have ever used. I use the lowest times on the recipe and it never fails. I also live in Texas which is very humid (today we had dense fog) and it is never mushy. Thanks so much for years of a great recipe.

The taste was O.K. but, the texture was chewy.  If yours comes out this way too, its because the mixture never got to a high enough temperature during the cooking process.  I had to throw my batch out! I think I'll stick with the good old candy thermometer method.

Good recipe and very quick and easy to make.  For some reason (even after adjusting the time and type of peanut) it still tasted slightly burnt(a bit of a burnt aftertaste).  I did make sure the peanuts didn't turn brown and I used 7% power (I have a mega watt microwave).  Even after 3 batches, it still tasted a bit burnt.  I may try this recipe one more time.

This couldn't be easier. I was all set to follow my peanut brittle recipe out of my cookbook--but it takes an hour! Who has time for that? I'm so glad I tried this. My microwave is 1100W. I cooked for 5 1/2 minutes, then 2 mintues. Delicious, and oh so simple. Thanks!

Wow!  Way too easy.  I made 4 batches in about 1/2 hour, put them in tins and brought them over to relatives as early Xmas presents.  I kept getting: It's so good! Where do you find the time?  My little secret.  Great recipe!!

I have a Panasonic 1300 watt microwave and every time I have made this, the times listed in the recipe were right on!  It has come out perfect for me every time.  This candy is wonderful!  I pour mine out onto a cookie sheet covered with that new "Release" non-stick foil and I don't even have to clean that pan.  Everyone at work loved it and they all wanted the recipe!

THIS RECIPE WAS VERY QUICK AND EASY.  IT COOKED  HARDENED PROPERLY AND HAD A GOOD FLAVOR, BUT I DID NOT LIKE THAT IT DIDN'T STAY CRUNCHY ONCE YOU GET IT IN YOUR MOUTH, IT GETS SOFT AND STICKS TO YOUR TEETH.,

Wow did this turn out well! I didn't want to do a stovetop recipe cause Ididn't have a candy thermometer, so I was skeptical, but this turned out way better than I could've asked for!

I followed this recipe exactly, except for using lightly salted peanuts.  Turned out wonderful - and I have never made Peanut Brittle before.  A definite keeper.

This one will cost you way more than its worth! I tried this 4 times and no matter how I adjusted the times for my microwave, it always came up too soft and chewy! Hey after you spend all that money you could have bought some gourmet brittle! Dont waste your time and especially your money on this one!

This microwave peanut brittle was the best recipe I have ever found.  As with alot of things it took two tries but the problem was timing.  The time you cook the peanut brittle all depends on your microwave.

this was so easy and tastes just like the old fashioned kind. I used mixed nuts rather than peanuts. I gave bags out as gifts and have people begging for me to make more now!

I made two batches of this recipe and they were tedious to make and quite mediocre in texture and taste. More important, it was definitely not easier to make than stovetop. I'm going to stick with the Joy of Cooking recipe (1951 ed.), which is quicker, easier, and tastier than this one.

Yuck.  Mine didn't turn out like I'd hoped.  It was chewy instead of crunchy and it stuck to our teeth very badly.  Maybe I need to experiment with the timing but I think I'd rather go back to the regular way that always turns out light and crunchy.  Thanks anyway.

I made this to give to friends and family for the holidays and EVERYONE says it's the BEST peanut brittle they've ever had!!!  Everyone has asked for the recipe and have made a couple batches for themselves already! I love it!!
I did use 2 cups of peanuts. Also, the first batch came out a little burned - but once I adjusted the time and wattage for my microwave - it comes out perfectly every time! I've made about 6 batches in 2 weeks!
Thanks for a great and EASY recipe!

All I can say is thanks for an easy candy recipe!!  I made my first batch and it turned out perfect.  The only modification that I made was that I used raw peanuts.  I used an 8 cup glass measuring cup with a handle to make and it was plenty large enough to allow the mixture to bubble without spilling over.  The handle also made it easy to pour onto the cookie sheet.

I did not know that peanut brittle could be so easy to make.  I have always wanted to make it for the holidays but never found a recipe easy enough.  THIS IS IT!!! I have made it 3 times this week!  I would not change one thing-well maybe cashews!

Makes a delicious peanut brittle.  This was my first attempt at making candy, and was really easy.  Just watch it as it can burn if time is not right.  Works great with pecans also.

I discovered that this really needs to cook a little longer in the microwave (at least on mine).  I have a 1,000 watt microwave oven and my first batch turned out chewey.  After I found out that cooking it for more like 8 minutes was the trick, this recipe was perfect.  Everyone loved it! It is truly addictive!

This is a fantastic recipe! My first batch turned out great, so I tried to double the recipe second time around. I guess I didn't adjust the cooking time adequately, and the second batch ended up chewy. The third time, I went back to the original recipe, and it worked like a charm. My family can't keep their hands out of the bag!

I recently made a stovetop brittle which flopped in a big way.  THIS recipe made perfect brittle the first time!  One tip--use a really big cookie sheet and tip it side to side after pouring the mixture on it.  This is easier than trying to spread it and results in a thin, crisp candy.

Tastes just like my Mom's that she made in a cast iron skillet on the stove many years ago.  I didn't add the vanilla, because I don't remember it being in my Mom's recipe.  Very good and easy!  I plan to make a few more batches tomorrow!

I made a tripple batch of this recipe as a holiday gift for my friends and it came out great! I did find that it took much longer for the peanuts to turn brown then I the recipe called for (I think it was due to my tiny microwave). It seems like something that must have taken me all day to make, but really didn't.

Really easy and it turned out great.  I'm used to making Peanut Brittle on the stove, so I approached this recipe cautiously.  Turns out that you can't taste a difference between the two methods.  From here on,  I'm going for quick and easy -- put your cooking pans up and get out your microwave bowls.  This is great!

Awesome. Exactly the way I like my peanut brittle. Once you're ready to pour this on the baking sheet, it cools and starts to harden very quickly. Thought I was never going to be able to clean it off my girlfriend's glass bowl, but after soaking in hot water for a little while it came out ok. Followed the recipe exactly.

I make this recipe over and over for gifts and parties. It’s the easiest candy recipe ever! Just follow instructions to a T, but do adjust your cooking time according to your microwave’s power. In my 1100 watt micro, I cook it for 4, stir and add butter and vanilla, and cook it for about 2-3 watching very carefully. It will brown in the middle faster, so be vigilant! If I let it get golden brown then stir, that seems perfect. It seems to cook a little more even after removed from the micro. Be sure to add and stir in the baking soda IMMEDIATELY and spread immediately. I like to stir it with a wooden spoon while cooking, but use a silicone spatula to scrape and pour it out of the cooking vessel. I also have found that a tapered or narrower glass cooking vessel is best. A wider bottom seems to cook unevenly. Love this recipe and will be making it for many years to come!

I have made this many times since finding this recipe.  It's super easy,  I have used raw peanuts too.  The only problem is that one batch never is enough.  Everyone raves about it!

Since my microwave power is 1480 W I followed this recipe by setting the power level to medium (5) and it turned out fine. I found using parchment paper for the baking sheet super easy!

I made 3 batches in the last week and all of it was gobbled up!! Several friends requested the recipe and my hubby feels the flavor rivals Sees Peanut Brittle. I followed the recipe exactly the first 2 times and added almonds on the 3 batch. All were delicious! Super fast & easy to make!

So easy! I've made it twice for Christmas and will take it to a New Year's party. My microwave is a few years old, so I followed my mother-in-law's old recipe that called for stirring the mixture every couple of minutes. I found 6 minutes to be sufficient initially, then 1 1/2 minutes. Otherwise, the result was too brown.

Fantastic recipe, I am so impressed with how easy these were to make! Followed someone’s recommendation for cashew brittle and also used about 2/3 teaspoon baking soda.  All I can say is WOW and thanks so much for this awesome recipe!  Will be making these many times!

Love the 4 cup measure tip to make this. My microwave took 6 mn for the sugar/syrup/salt then 3 mn with the vanilla/butter and deluxe/no peanut mixed nuts. About 1 1/4 baking soda was my choice given we are all getting a little long in the tooth.   I like the heated sheet pan with parchment paper on top then slid off the paper onto a cool pan to stick in the fridge while making the next batch.   Great to be able to make three batches so quickly.  Thanks .

This is an awesome recipe!  Thank you.  I've made it several times.  A 4 cup glass measuring cup works perfectly for this, making it easy to mix with a table knife and pour out of.  Like others, I  found warming my cookie sheet a bit before pouring out the mixture helped it spread better.  I also have learned to have some very hot tap water ready for cleanup as soon as I pour the brittle out.  That stuff hardens like concrete in a quick hurry, so get your mixing container in hot water fast.

So much easier than on the stove! Hints... use Reynolds Non-stick Grill Foil instead of oiling the pan, and buy a bag of Spanish Raw Peanuts then you won't have burnt nuts. Adjust time depending on how brown you want you brittle and oven wattage.

Excellent! Super easy and quick. Just watch out for the timing. The recipe is given for a 700W microwave. Mine is much higher wattage so took a lot less time, but I burned the first batch by cooking it too long

Have 1100 watt MW so cooked sugar and syrup 3 1/2 min. Added butter , planters salted peanuts and vanilla.  Cooked 2  1/2 minutes more, added baking soda and spread mixture on warm sprayed cookie sheet and turned out perfect.  Better than Sam’s ??

I made the recipe as instructed but, instead of using a baking sheet I used a 24 ct mini muffin metal pan. Mixture was about half a cup over the amount I needed. Other than that, it seems to be delicious.

I’ve made a lot of toffee and brittles on the stove, but like everyone else, I loved the idea of not standing over a flame stirring the candy. I don’t know if I did something(s) wrong, but I stuck to this recipe exactly, and even added some extra time in the microwave. It is floppy, gritty, and too sweet. I guess I’ll stick to the stove top

Sorry, not a fan of this recipe.  I felt like something sweet so I gave this recipe a try.  Followed the directions to a tee but the end result was not traditional peanut brittle.  I'll stick to my tried and true stove top method.  It is a bit more time consuming to make but it's worth it!

I followed the recipe exactly and when I took the bowl out of the microwave the 1st time, I found some pockets of granulated sugar that did not melt. Also I figured afterward that my microwave might have a higher powder..  ! The brittle was pretty dark in color and had an after taste of burned caramel.
The brittle still tasted good and I plan to make again following the recommendations of reviewer  MARIEZEE.

This was an easy and excellent-tasting recipe. I have a 1500 watt microwave and I followed some of the modifications suggested. First, I used a 4 cup Pampered Chef glass measuring bowl with handle. I sprayed the interior and exterior with cooking spray. I combined sugar, corn syrup, salt and micro-ed for 3 minutes. Then I added cocktail peanuts, stirred and micro-ed 2 minutes. Then vanilla, butter, stirred, micro-ed 3 minutes. Added baking soda and spread on a cooking sheet that I sprayed and topped with parchment paper which I also sprayed. Spray, spray, spray! Then bathe utensils in super hot water.

Excellent!! Followed the instructions exactly. I have been making peanut brittle for years using another recipe given to me by my Aunt. Peanut brittle is tricky to make in the microwave, not cooked enough it gets tacky and sticky, over cooked it turns dark brown. In the other recipe the peanuts are added later as well as the butter and baking soda.  This recipe was better as I’m always wondering if the peanuts are cooked enough. I have thrown out Numerous batches of peanut brittle before and finally found a recipe that has the timing correct!  I made both batches today (same ingredients in both different instructions on adding them) and both are good. I preferred the texture & color of this better. Definitely making this again!!

I made adjustments based on Mariezee's review and the results were DELICIOUS.  I have an 1000 watt microwave so lowered the cooking time:   2 1/2 minutes for the sugar and corn syrup, add the nuts and cook for 2 more minutes, add the vanilla and butter and cook 1 minutes more.   I used 3/4 t of baking soda.

Once you figure out the timing on your microwave this is SUPER easy.  I will admit that I didn't use this with peanuts.  I had mistakenly bought a few pounds of raw pepitas (pumpkin seeds) instead of the roasted/salted ones.  I needed a way to use them up and this worked wonderfully.  If you use raw ones you can stir them in at the beginning just like the recipe calls.  If yours are already roasted they may become bitter almost burned so add them in when you add the baking soda.  This was great for little treats for co-workers and friends at Xmas!

**WARNING** I actually love this recipe, but needed to post my mistake so no one else suffers the same injuries.  I have made this recipe several times with excellent results, but this time I was using a different microwave, so I misjudged the minutes required for it to reach the "hard crack" stage and undercooked it.  I decided to try and salvage the batch  by re-boiling it for a few more minutes.  DO NOT TRY THIS!  If it doesn't set up,  throw it out.  After you add the baking soda, an attempt to reheat can result in a dangerous and unstable molten goo- mine erupted all over my hand and fingers when i picked up the bowl. Thankfully I used a pyrex with a handle. so only my left hand was injured.  I'm typing this one handed with 2nd degree burns all over my hand and fingers.  Not the recipe's fault, of course, but I thought this was important to share.  WARNING: DO NOT TRY TO RE-COOK AFTER ADDING BAKING SODA!

I'm sorry but I didn't like this method. I made it exactly by the recipe. I didn't change anything. I love making (and eating, of course) peanut brittle. It was really messy! I just made another batch using my stove top. It may be more time consuming but it wasn't nearly as messy. I have a candy thermometer so I'll just stick to what I know.

I did microwave it for 2 minute intervals. I used a candy thermometer and got the heat to a hardball stage. I put it on the cookie sheet then into a 200 degree oven for about 15 minutes  til it was spread smooth and bubbly. Watch close.

PERFECT THE FIRST TIME!!!  This was so good and so easy.  My husband commented that he really liked it because it wasn't soooo hard like some we have had but definitely hard enough.  I premeasured all of my ingredients so I could work quickly since this is imperative when making brittle.  I used RAW PEANUTS instead of the dry roasted and cooked them from the beginning with the sugar and corn starch as per directions.  Since they were raw and not the dry roasted, I didn't have any problem with them being too brown or burnt as some others have mentioned.  My microwave is 1000 watt and I cooked 6 minutes at 70% power setting for first portion and then cooked 2 minutes at 100% power setting for the last part.  I warmed my buttered foil lined pan as others had suggested and tilted the pan back and forth from one side to the other and let it run rather than trying to spread it.  Perfect the first time!

Nice and easy, thank you!  I will reiterate what others have said in that the first step, cooking for 6 minutes was too long and it has a mild overcooked taste. I'm making it for christmas gifts for neighbors, so tonight's batch was a trial... my husband and I will enjoy this batch to ourselves and the next one I'll cook for less time.

Great, easy recipe! Do be sure to have all of your ingredients measured and ready. I found that microwaving in an 8-cup glass measuring cup makes it easier.

Watch closely! Didn't add salt. Cooked for 3 minutes then put in butter and vanilla. Cooked another 3 minutes then poured on to parchment paper and in the freezer it went for abut 20 minutes. Really good for first try!

Put baking sheet with release foil in oven for little while.  Spray everything.  Use 6 or 8 cup Pyrex with spout.  4 cup overflowed.  Add sugars, peanuts, salt and stir and zap for 4 minutes.  Add butter and vanilla and zap for 2 minutes.  Add baking soda and pour immediately.

No karo syrup.  In saucepan use 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup water and bring to boil without stirring.  Boil for 3 minutes.  This was a suggestion from a review.

I, too, have a higher power microwave so I did the first cook for 5 minutes.  Added the butter & vanilla and did it for 3 more minutes.  Added the baking soda and poured it out on a parchment lined sheet pan.  Perfect consistency, crunchy and delicious!  Thanks for this recipe, it's easy and tasty, can't beat that combo!

I added almonds instead of peanuts.  When I make it again I will add more baking soda to see if it will create more foam and crumble easier when cooled.

I have a 1000 watt microwave.  Cooked first mixture 4 1/2 min. and after adding the butter and vanilla cooked it 1 1/2 min.  It turned out perfectly.  Will definitely make again!

So, I made this recipe twice in 3 days (once for work and once for home), and it is good! Both batches came out different, but that's because my microwave is wonky. Both batches are still really good :)

I've never made peanut brittle so this was a new adventure. I have a higher watt micro so I didn't leave it in as long ( 5 minutes & 2 minutes) but it came out perfect. Tasty & easy, I will make again!

Delicious and so simple. Tastes just like what my grandma used to slave over the stove making! I have a 1000 watt microwave and cooked it for 5:30 and 1:30 and it was just right.

Love this recipe! To make it easier to get corn syrup out of measuring cup- spray on cooking spray. I also used a glass Pyrex mixing bowl sprayed with cooking spray. Candy releases easier after first step.

Ok, I'm not a good cook when it comes to the kitchen, I can do wonders on a outdoor grill. I tried this recipe and was pleased with the instructions, ingredients list, etc. I went by the directions pretty much and the brittle looked exactly as it was supposed to but it was a bit on the chewy side. I read all the comments and guessed that maybe I didn't cook it long enough, my microwave was 1200 watts so I didn't cook it but about 2.5 to 3 minutes on first stage with corn syrup and sugar, mixed it all up real good quickly and then added the next ingredients as per the instructions, cooked it for another 3 minutes. I then added the nuts and strirred it all up quickly and heated it for 1.5 to 2 more minutes. looked right smelled right, but was chewy after it cooled and hardened for about 30 minutes or an hour. I prefer really crunchy peanut brittle, so I wonder what I did wrong. I guess I will have to try it again. I'm sure its just length of cooking time or something simple that I didn't do quite right. Happy I found this recipe though, just gotta get my kinks worked out.

Added this to my list of Christmas candy.  So fast and easy to make! I added my raw Spanish peanuts upfront and they cooked just right in this recipe.  I may try a posters suggestion to add 1/2 tsp more baking soda to make it extra airy.  I have to make more for the holiday-my "test batch" is nearly gone:)

I will never make Peanut Brittle any other way! This was done in less than 10 minutes (minus the cooling) following Mariezee's tips for a higher wattage microwave. Absolutely delicious, and we no longer need to buy it at $6 a pop at our local farmer's market! Linda C., you are a genius and I love you.

No changes to the recipie and this is fantastic!  I line the cookie sheet with parchment paper, and it works perfectly when removing the brittle. Great last minute gift if someone stops by with cookies at Christmas!

I think I would add a little less peanuts and more of the "candy," but that is just my personal preference.  Very tasty though! :)

Recipe tasted great. I used suggestions to cut back on time and put in peanuts after cooking the sugar and corn syrup for 2 minutes. Next time I would cut back on the peanuts a bit. The only problem I really had was the parchment paper stuck to the brittle and it was hard to remove. I don't know, maybe wax paper or foil next time?

Wow, I haven't made peanut brittle in years and this turned out GREAT! My microwave is more than 700W so I just used the lower cook times and followed steps and ingredients exactly and had no problems with burning like a few others had.  Getting ready to make more as the first batch didn't last long in my house!!  Thanks for sharing!

It tasted great and was easy to make, but it turned out more like taffy than brittle. My husband really enjoyed it though and he was the reason I was making it.

My first try at making this.  I took some hints from the other reviews, high wattage microwave, parchment paper, glass measuring cup.  Mine turned out great.  Thanks to Linda C for the recipe and all the reviews that made mine turn out so well.

I dont think I let it heat long enough, the mix never set, it stayed a gooey mess.  A very tasty gooey mess, but not quite brittle.

Following the suggestion of others, I used 4 TBSP of cornstarch as well. It was great!

I have always been intimidated by the thought of making peanut brittle...did a search for an easy recipe and came across this one.  Thank you to whoever posted it, it was easy and great!  I've already made 4 batches.  I have a 1100 watt microwave so I did as suggested by a poster and did my first round for 6 min and the second for 2 1/2 min.  LOVE IT.  I poured mine on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper...worked great!

I stopped the cooking about 3 times and stirred it each time when I made it. And just watched for some browning. Its not very dark when its ready to pour so I wouldn't keep cooking till you get a nice brown. I took mine out when it was very very lightly browned, then stirred in the vanilla and butter. It was perfect. And I forgot the baking soda! But it was still very good and yummy!

My fiance loves peanut brittle and having never made it before, I wanted to find the most fool-proof way to do it.  Well....I used another microwave brittle recipe that I found on a cooking blog which turned out not so good - not because it was a bad recipe, the cooking times were off for MY microwave.  Then I found this one, read a lot of the reviews and gave it a try.  I ended up using some tips from other reviewers, as I am not sure of my microwave's wattage (it was made in 2002) so I put the sugar and corn syrup in first for 6 1/2 minutes, took it out and stirred in the nuts, butter, and vanilla and put it back in for another 3 minutes.  I then took it out and quickly added the baking soda, stirred, and poured it out onto a warmed cookie sheet covered in parchment paper (another reviewer tip).  At 15 minutes the brittle broke up really well, had a beautiful amber color, and tasted delicious.  I even took my previous brittle that was grainy and not cooked enough and melted it down again for 4 minutes in the microwave and recooked it.  It now is amber colored as well, and I am waiting to see if it will set up and I can actually save it!   Thanks for this easy recipe for candy beginners like me.  It looks wonderful and tastes fantastic!

This is unbelievably easy!  At least - once I sorted out the time on my microwave.  I have a 1200 watt microwave and my first batch I tried one posters idea of time reduction (5 minutes and then 1.5) and it was burnt badly.  The next batch I followed another posters idea and set my microwave at 70%, for 5 minutes, then 2 minutes. Other then that I followed the recipe.  It's wonderfully brittle and tastes like the real deal! I will be making this OFTEN!

This is the easiest recipe I've made.  Microwave for 6 minutes, add butter, microwave for 2 more minutes. Add Baking Soda, stir in, pour onto a cookie sheet covered in parchment.  Spread quickly - thinner than you think you want.  Leave it for 15 minutes - I lifted out the parchment paper and placed it on a cold pack.  Broke it into pieces and, viola, easy peasy Peanut Brittle.  I only used a cup of salted roasted peanuts, and a 1/2 - 1/3 tsp of Baking Soda.

This is the first time I've made peanut brittle and it was wonderful.  I didn't have any of the troubles, like a burnt taste, that other posters mentioned.  I followed the recipe exactly and am thrilled with the end product.

How do I avoid the 'chewy-ness' of it? I preferred it to 'crackle'. It sticks to my teeth. Did it not cook long enough? I have a very  powerful microwave and cooked according to directions. Suggestions?

100% surprised with this one! Oh my goodness, so yummy and soooo easy! I followed the directions exactly. I erred on the side of caution and stuck with the lower end the time ranges. I took two suggestions from other viewers. 1. Add peanuts after 5 minutes of cooking. and 2. line pan with aluminum foil. I don't know if the aluminum foil did anything, but I can tell you I will be making this recipe over and over again. Thanks for a great one!

Best peanut brittle I've ever had!  I only had 3/4 cup of peanuts, so I halved everything in the recipe.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly, cutting the microwaving times in half also.  No burnt taste at all, just sweet enough but not too sweet.  Will definitely make again!

I made this recipe for the first time this afternoon. It was easy enough, but I used my nose and my eyes because my microwave is 1000W instead of 700W as in the recipe. I'm going to separate the peanuts out until the sugar and corn syrup melt down next time. But it was very tasty and just that simple! Great recipe!

After failing twice with a stove top method I decided to try the microwave recipe. Now I'm old school and I only use my microwave to heat up leftover and for popcorn so this was new to me. I LOVED IT! Easy, simple and most important taste excellent. Wish I could give this 10 stars, thanks for making my holiday a bit more easier.

Absolutely amazing. I have made this 8 times in the last 2 months (due to the holidays) and it comes out perfect each time. I still use raw peanuts instead of roasted and it turns out fine. Also, using my 4 cup glass measuring cup to cook this in is perfect and SOOO easy!

Made this for Christmas last year and can't wait to make it again this year. People didn't believe me when I told them it was made with the microwave so I gave them the recipe and they tried it out for themselves and were amazed!

SUPER easy.  Don't forgo the glass bowl mentioned above.  I used a plastic one the second time I made these and ruined the brittle and the bowl.  Can also use a ceramic bowl which is what I used.

I will never make peanut brittle any other way again.  This recipe came out perfect the very first time.  I read the other reviews and knowing that I had a newer microwave I used the cook time (5min then 2min).  

Start cleaning the glass bowl with hot water immediately after use and cleanup will be much easier.

LOVE THIS! I have followed it exactly to the directions and had good luck with it. However, I decided to decrease the amount of baking soda to a half teaspoon and I like the results better. The best time for me has been 6 minutes and then 2 minutes on high. If you decide to cut back on the amount of nuts to save money, know that you'll need to decrease your cooking time. I scorched a batch that I only used a 3/4 cup of macadamias in it. :(

Never made peanut brittle before until last year. I received this recipe from my in-law.  After the 2nd batch, I found the right times for our microwave.  Love this recipe.  So easy to make and addicting!

This is just too easy and VERY delicious!  I've made it twice now.  The first time came out chewy but it still disappeared in no time.  I can't wait to try it again with cashews!

This recipe worked great in my microwave as written and the flavor is great! I used 1 cup of peanuts only, but that is my preference. Thank you for this recipe I had lost mine and this is almost exactly as I used to make it.

Out standing recipe!  The only change I made was to use whole roasted salted cashews which I coarsely chopped instead of dry roasted nuts.  The amount of nuts specified in the recipe is perfect.  Total cook time in my microwave oven which is 800 watts is 6 minutes.

this was awesome. taste great and easy to make. i poured mines on parchment paper and quickly had to spread it but others suggested heating the baking sheet so that it'll be easier to spread. i will do that next time. also i added my peanuts the same time i added my butter to avoid burning. clean up was a bit scary but elbow grease and hot water did the trick. will keep this recipe!

I had to teach a class for a project on colonial times and chose this recipe for my peanut brittle. I followed the recipe using the lowest times and it came out perfect. Everyone in the class ate it up very quickly and asked for seconds. I highly recommend this for anyone who doesn't have the time to do a full fledged recipe (and even if you do have the time!) but is still looking for something tasty.

We had a problem.  Didn't have parchment paper as suggested, so used waxed paper.  DO NOT USE WAXED PAPER.  Paper stuck to bottom.  Brittle was chewy so we threw out the batch.  I'm not sure if we'll try again... what with being chewy, was not as sweet as I remembered purchased brittle to taste like.

Just made this last night, used mixed nuts rather than just peanuts, and since I have a higher power microwave I didn't cook it as long. It took about 5 minutes for the candy mixture to change to a nice brown, not including the times I stopped to stir the mixture, and after adding the butter and vanilla I only went about a minute more as I didn't want it to overbrown. Next time I will probably go to a bit less than a tsp of soda, but I really like the brittle I got. Crisp, delicious, nutty! Wow! Thanks for this excellent recipe; can't wait to make some more!

This is absolutely my favorite peanut brittle.  I will never make stovetop brittle again.  This brittle stays crunchy and does not get sticky like others I've tried.  Thanks for making my life easier.

Excellent and so easy!  I'd always been intimidated by making candy, but this was doable and I got it right the first time!  Due to another reviewer's suggestion, I added the peanuts after the first 6 minutes, since my peanuts had already been roasted.

So easy and Delicious! I've never made peanut brittle before and this is such a great recipe to start with. On the suggestions of other reviewers, I started with only the sugar and syrup and microwaved for only 4 minutes(I have a 1200 watt microwave). I then added the nuts(salted), vanilla and butter. I omitted the salt since I used salted nuts, microwaved for 2 more minutes and then added the baking soda. It came out perfect!! Thanks so much for this very simple recipe.

Wow!I just made this & adjusted the times because my micro is more powerful & it is already stting up nicely.The key is to be prepared-I had the hot water ready to pour into the bowl (8 cups)as soon as I had the brittle poured out & used Pam on the knife, spoon & baking pan. I can't wait to try it w/other nuts as I have almonds & pecans.  part of this is a gift for my MIL,as she loves brittle. I LOVE this site!

The taste was good.  I don't know what I did wrong though, it never hardened up. It was more like taffy. I had to put it in the freezer to set it and be able to break it. Even after that the texture wasn't what it should be.

VERY VERY GOOD, and FAST!! I tried it for the first time today, just about burned my fingers tipping the bowl to pour out the contents but it was worth it =)

I used roasted salted peanuts and added them in with the vanilla and butter so that they would not burn. Thank you so much for the great recipe, will definitely be making again and again and again ...

Great brittle recipe!  I have made several variations with nuts and it always is delicious (I have also added coconut and dried cranberries, super good!).  Fast, easy, but very hot so watch your hands.  I did have to make time adjustments because of a higher power micro but it is simply divine and a keeper!

This is awesome!  Mine didn't set up properly, but it was still delicious, fun to make, and fun to eat.  It was like peanut toffee!  I will definitely be making this again.  Even though it didn't set, there was still a huge 'wow factor' and it was so easy to make!

As easy as it gets!  I made several batches, some with cashews, others with pistachios, lots with salted or Spanish peanuts.  I gave lots away and got raves.  You can't make a faster home-made gift.

So easy and delicious!  It might take a couple tries to get it exactly right.  ITs very easy to burn.

I cannot get over how EASY this recipe is to make.  I must have made over a dozen batches of it during the holidays for gifts and bake sales.  Everyone carried on about how wonderful it was.  The beauty of it is that it only takes about ten minutes of your time!

For peanut brittle it was an easy and good recipe.  I still had tons left over after Christmas...maybe we just aren't big fans.  Some batches turned out chewy...you need to make sure that the sugar mixture reaches the right temperature.

I made two batches and both turned out like taffy instead of brittle. Also, it kept boiling over constantly in my microwave, it was super messy. Towards the end of microwaving I had to open the microwave door every 10 seconds or so to stop the boiling over. I still give it a four, because I'm sure if I could tweek the cooking time a bit, it would be really good and easy.

I can't really rate this b/c I never got to try it!  I made the mistake of using a plastic mixing bowl the first time and learned the hard way that you should definitely use glass as per the instructions.  It was stuck to the bowl and I had to scrap that batch and try again.  The second time I didn't cook it long enough and it never set (even after I put it in the fridge for a few hours).  So I scrapped it as well.  It looked good though!

So good!  I used a large 4 cup measuring cup and 2 cups peanuts (I don't think they were dry roasted though). Very good, but you need to work quickly once you mix to spread onto the greased pan! Oh and make sure to soak your bowl in soapy hot water immediately!

Ok, here's the deal with this. I just made three batches of this stuff and all three didn't turn out. But, because I see how well this is rated, I'm assuming it was me. Batch one, was actually given to co-workers and it really has a wonderful taste, but it was chewy. And I'm sure it must be that it didn't reach the right temp in the microwave. The other two batches never even set up, and went right into the garbage. I really think it was my microwave, so give it a try, it doesn't cost very much to make, and it makes quite a bit!

I took the suggestion of a previous reviewer and used a large mixing bowl.  DO NOT USE PLASTIC - IT JUST BURNED A WHOLE THRU WHEN I PULLED IT OUT OF THE MICROWAVE.  TOTALLY MY FAULT!  TRYING AGAIN!

Thanks for the great recipe. I can't believe people actually buy this in the stores when it is so simple to make. Very easy to follow and perfect everytime (I put the roasted nuts in with the butter and vanilla). Happy Holidays!!!

I made this for the first time and I gave some for my boyfriend to take to work and he said ALL the guys up there LOVED it. They said," It is perfect...not too sweet, and just the right amount of peanuts."  Also, I did not add the salt in.

:::sigh:::this stuff was great the first night I made it, (the night before Thanksgiving) but the next day it was all stuck together and to the plate it was on and I had to throw the plate and all away lol. There was lots of pictures taken of the plate being held upside down with the brittle stuck to it. I think it was the extreme humidity here that caused this to happen. its a great recipes now i know i have to eat it all fast!

My 84 year old mother wanted some Peanut Brittle so I tried this recipe knowing that I candy making ability is not that great & she liked it so well she ask me to make 4 more batches so she could share with friends.  which was not a problem because not only did it turn out wonderful, it took less than 15 min to make. Thanks for sharing, Linda C.

I just got done making this peanut brittle.  I have had a recipe for years and thought it was the best.  I had to cook it on the stove and stir and wait for it to get the right stage.  This is too easy.  My microwave oven is 750  watts and I followed the directions exactly as the recipe calls for.  This is definitely a keeper !!!  Try it !!  You will be glad your did.

I've made peanut brittle from several recipes over the years.I was skeptical about this because it just seemed too easy.  After making it this way, I will never do the candy thermometer again! This was so simple, little mess to clean and the brittle turned out perfectly. It wasn't "break your teeth" hard like some, and it was crunchy and delicious.

so i just made a batch and it came out amazing...it was easier for me to buy fresh, raw peanuts.  to get the skin off i soaked it in hot water and then peeled off the skin. i thought the damp peanuts wouldn't work out, but rather they roasted just right in the microwave and came out crunchy w/ the rest of the brittle.  in fact, the extra moisture kept most of them from burning.

Wow!  I couldn't believe how easy this recipe was - and the brittle was perfect first time out.  I did follow some of the other suggestions:  I didn't put the (already roasted) peanuts in until the last couple of minutes, and I greased the cookie sheet with butter and a little salt.  My husband couldn't believe that I'd made it - said it tasted like the best gourmet peanut brittle.  Thanks for a terrific keeper!

This was the easiest and the absolute BEST tasting brittle I have ever had.  I look forward to receiving brittle every christmas from a good friend of mine.  I have never had much luck when it comes to a candy thermometer so have not tried to make my own for yrs.  I tried this recipe just for giggles and I was blown away!  This treat was to go on trays for my neighbors if it turned out, but instead I have horded the entire batch for myself!  Thank you for this wonderful addition to our holidays!!!!

I made this last Christmas and added to our gift bags of goodies that we give to our friends. I forgot all about it this year until someone just asked me if I would be making this again.  Everyone loved it.  It was really easy to make and taste really good.

I just made this brittle for work collegues to rave reviews.  One big fan said it was the best he's ever tasted (and he'd tasted a few!).

In Australia we can't get corn syrup, so I substituted liquid glucose and it worked fine.  The consistency was a little thick which made it hard to spread, but taste was delicious.

BEST AND EASIEST PEANUT BRITTLE RECIPE EVER!  I will use this recipe every year from now on.  It worked BEAUTIFULLY.  I followed the directions exactly.  It was so easy I nearly passed out.  It was that seriously EASY!  And it broke up wonderfully and it tasted like I slaved over the stove making it the "old fashioned" way.  Thanks for an AWESOME recipe!!

Decreased power level on my microwave to accommodate for the wattage difference. Still turned out chewy.

My very picky husband loved this recipe!!  My name describes my cooking ability and this was no problemo at all.  Made it while cooking pumpkin bread IV!  Killed two birds with one stone in one afternoon!

This was sooooooooo easy and very tasty.
I used salted and blanched peanuts and they worked just as well. I took them to work and the pickiest eater was raving over them and wanting the recipe.

What a wonderful recipe! We had never eaten brittle before, so what a surprise. I didn't have light colored syrup, so we used a dark kind. I made half the recipe, just in case we wouldn't like it. But we did! So I ended up making another batch...and another batch...and another batch.... My daughters want to take some to school, but I ran out of peanuts. Guess what they said??? Yes, you guessed it right: we had some other nuts!!! So I have to run and make some more!
Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Awesome.  Used the tip from "TININI" to substitute honey for the corn syrup and it worked out well, except it gets melty in a couple days (this brittle shouldn't even last that long, though!)

This is a very quick and simple recipe.  The tricky part is the timing in the microwave as well as getting it spread onto the sheet.  I used the aluminum foil idea.  It was a favorite at Christmas this year!

Oh my gosh...perfect! I will never stand over a boiling pot again to make brittle.  We were craving a little something sweet and whipped this up so quickly & easily. Tastes Great...so glad we found this version for peanut brittle!!  

(doesn't make a large amount so if your making to give away you may want to double it)

this recipe is genius.  i never thought brittle could be so simple.  i used cashews instead of peanuts.  and i increased nuts to 2 cups because i wanted a higher nuts-to-brittle ratio.  perfect!

Great recipe! Who knew peanut brittle could be so easy to make? I love that there's no candy thermometer involved. I brought this to two family gatherings and had requests for the recipe. I also got requests for a repeat performance at the next gathering. This recipe is a keeper!

This turned out pretty well.  I have a 900watt oven.  I cooked it for 5 minutes, then two more minutes after adding the vanilla and butter.  I think it could have cooked just a hair longer, and would have been a little crispier.  I'm going to make another batch tomorrow, and try the longer time.  Still quite tasty either way.  Much easier than cooking on the stove.

First time was a charm, unbelievable how easy it was. Followed instructions except used regular salted peanuts and came out perfect! Very good, will try with other nuts. Perfect for tray of Christmas goodies! And clean up was a breeze using hot water and dish soap!

Excellent results following the exact ingredients; I have a 1300w oven and I tweaked the times a bit (3 1/2 mins to start, then 2 mins after the butter & vanilla are added). It is an absolutely delicious recipe (I am a first time brittle maker), and this compelled me to make 5 batches in 2 days. I'm giving this away to everyone for gifts. My 6 year old can't get enough of it, and my 3 year old wants it for lunch!

I have been making this recipe to give as teacher gifts for the last 3 years and I actually have been asked by several people for the recipe.  My Geek-on-Call guy told me that it is the best brittle he has ever had.

I can't believe how good and easy this was.  I made it this weekend to give as a Christmas gift.  You can't tell the difference between this and the peanut brittle that you cook over the stove.  The only thing that I did differently was I added the vanilla just before I added the baking soda and because I used salted peanuts, I didn't add the salt.

This was good.  I used cashews instead of traditional peanuts and it turned out very well.

Best recipe ever. We made it for 300 people for wedding favors. Easiest item we made, cheap, came out consistently. Thank you. We used almonds and peanuts (seperately), both are good.

I only read a few of the reviews/suggestions before diving in to this recipe and I had NO problems. My peanuts didn't really "brown," per se but the flavor was great and it cooled perfectly. I used probably 1.5 c of peanuts, and I think I would do it the same way next time. It doesn't spread as thinly to cool, but it has a great flavor- not too crazy sweet.

I had a hard time getting the right cook time on this recipe but that's user-error (and the user's microwave) rather than the recipe.  I love the idea of making brittle in the microwave but I think I'll stick to the traditional cook-top way of making peanut brittle.

I tried this recipe and it was the easiest one to make.  The original recipe calls for too little peanuts. I used one cup and next time I will use more.  It was a good easy recipe.

Though I like my brittle just a little thinner than what this turned out...the taste was excellent...So super quick and easy! 10 minutes and you have a homemade treat that everyone loves! I am thinking about making this for Christmas gifts for my children's teachers this year!

This is so AWESOME!!!! I love that it was so easy to make and even yummier to eat, I cannot stop eating it! I did use buttered wax paper on the cookie sheet so that it would be easier to break up. WONDERFUL STUFF! Thanks for sharing.

I can not believe how easy this was to make.  This was 10x better than any store bought Peanut Brittle.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I microwaved it for 6 minutes at first and then 2 minutes after that.  PERFECT! My kids couldn't believe I made it.  I put it in bags for their teachers for school.

Very tasty.  My mom had a similar recipe that I've always used but I decided to try this one.  I ruined the first batch because the brittle never set and was very chewy.  I tried it a gain and cooked it a little longer and it turned out awesome!!!  My microwave is 10 years old and is 1540 Watts...I cooked the brittle for 5 minutes, then 3 minutes and it turned out perfectly.  This recipe is easier than my mom's and I think I'll be using this one from now on!!!!  Everybody is going to be oh-so-happy at Christmas when they see all the homemade peanut brittle!!

This comes out great in my 750 watt microwave.  I used cashews instead of peanuts and a 6-cup capacity glass bowl.  When it was mostly hardened, but still somewhat soft, I used a knife to cut it into uniform pieces.

Let me start off by saying I have NEVER EVER been able to make candy before.  I am the type that bakes and bakes and yets buys all of the peanut brittle at the bake sales.  Try it people...just excellent and so easy.  I could make batches and batches over and over with no effort.  15 stars!!!

I'm made this with peanuts and cashews for our apartment communities Christmas party.

I have made 4 batches of this brittle and it is so easy!  A great gift idea.  My microwave is 950 watts, so I cooked the mixture for 4 minutes rather than 6 to 7 and for an additional 2 minutes after adding the butter and vanilla.  You definitely must work quickly but it is worth it and you are done in a flash.

This is delicious.  My first batch turned out wonderful.  The second batch, I tried doubling the recipe and it did not harden.  I am not sure if I did not cook it long enough or if I shouldn't have doubled the baking soda at the end because it foamed a lot more than the first time.  It turned out chewy but still good, so I dipped it in chocolate...scrumptious.  Gotta love that you can turn a mistake into something still wonderful :o)

Great recipe!  I've made this recipe several times now and it's very easy to make.  You do have to be careful not to overcook it so watch how strong your microwave is.  I'm a big brittle lover, and this one is on the top of my list.

I received rave reviews with this brittle. It sets quick so be speedy about mixing in the soda and getting it into a pan to set.

Good recipe and I loved the ease of the microwave...although I ruined the first batch.  Make sure that you are aware of the wattage for your microwave.  Mine is fairly new and under 8 months old.  My microwave created a hot spot and it burned.  What a waste of peanuts, but I gave it another try and it turned out tons better the second time around.  I just didn't cook it as long as the recipe suggested.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a very good, easy recipe. I made 2 batches today. I will give this out to my neighbors along with other christmas goodies. The first batch I made with the 1 1/2 cups of nuts and the 2nd batch I made with just a little over 1 cup and they both were great.

Very easy and very good!  I only had cashews and it still tasted great.  My hubby LOVED it and he isn't easy to please.  Will be great to make and put in a Christmas tin for a nice gift!

I have been using this recipe for the past three years and it works every time I make it. I make a lot! We included it in our gift tins.  Much easier and less time consuming than the traditional method which I used before coming across this recipe. The only change I made was to add 1 tablespoon water with first 4 ingredients.

Fabulous! It never last long enough for me to give away though. I have made it with cashews, too, and it is really good that way as well.

I just made this ... yum!  I didn't have peanuts, so i substituted cashews.  It turned out fantastic.  If you are going to try cashews though, it cooks one minute less both times.  Thank you for an awesome recipe!

********** 10 Stars! I have never been able to make peanut brittle until now! This is delicious and easy! It broke apart beautifully. I poured the mixture onto Reynolds release foil which I had sprayed with Butter Pam. I think the Butter Pam was overkill. I have a new 120v GE Profile Advantium Microwave Oven and I did 5 minutes followed by 2 minutes and it did beautifully. Skeptical hubby is now eating crow and this stuff up!

I think the cooking time is way off in this recipe.  I made a double recipe and cooked over 25 minutes.  I did as another suggested and put (cashews in my case) the nuts in after cooking for 5 minutes.  I kept testing a dab of the mixture to see if it would harden.  If not, I continued cooking.  If you do not cook the mixture to a hard crack stage, you will get more like carmel.  That is what is happening to other folks.  Don't pour it out until you are sure it has cooked enough.  I also put no salt and more vanilla.  I would have given it 5 stars if the cooking time was right.

I make all of my candy the long, old-fashioned way; so I was really skeptical.  But I made this recipe twice in one day (it doesn't make very much) and it came out perfect both times!  I recommend 1 c. peanuts, however.  I used the salted peanuts and didn't add any extra salt, as others have suggested.  Also, I cooked it for 7.5 minutes the first time and 2.5 minutes the second time.  Thanks Linda C. for a keeper!!!

I had problems with this.  i made it, it wouldnt harden enoug.  was elastic.  so i folded it all up, put it back in the glass bowl, microwaved it for 5more minutes, stirred it, and microwaved it for another 3-5 minutes.  It's alot harder, but some parts could have hardened more than what they did.  I won't be giving up on it though.  will try again.

Easy, fast and extremely great quality!  I love the one bowl idea, and the bowl came clean after soaking for just a little while in hot water.  My peanut brittle popped right off the cookie sheet and broke up easily.  I will always make my peanut brittle this way.

I never have had a recipe that I was famous for, but now I do!  This really is the best, and everyone thinks you've spent ages at the stove (of course you let them believe it too).  Thankyou so much Linda C for sharing, but I think I will hold this recipe close to my chest for just a while and keep them all guessing.

I make this for my stepfather, as peanut brittle is his favorite candy.  He says it's the best he's ever had and believe me, he's eaten a lot.  It is super easy to make.  One bowl, one pan.  Clean up is a snap as well, as long as you soak the bowl a bit in hot water.

Tastes good, easy to make, never hardened for me.  I don't know why mine didn't turn out, but it never set.  I am still giving this recipe 3 stars because my fiance can't keep his hands out of my peanut goo and says I should box and sell it.  this was my 2nd try with this recipe, and it didn't work out, so I won't be making it again.  For those that have the patience, I highly recommend it because it is very tasty.

I was looking for a delicious brittle recipe which would be easier to prepare than my old stovetop method.  This recipe was the answer. The use of dry-roasted peanuts allows those with raw peanut allergies to still enjoy eating peanut brittle.  I used the 4-cup measuring cup and the preparations worked great.  Hot water in the measuring cup made clean-up a breeze.  Thanks for sharing a true winning recipe, Linda.

This made the perfect peanut brittle!  I found that using roasted peanuts made the peanuts too dark and over-cooked for my taste so I tried it with raw peanuts and they turned out just right - golden brown, not too dark.  I also used my VisionWare glass cooking pot for easier handling - it's much better than using a bowl.  And yes, you do have to work fast when pouring the brittle onto a cookie sheet.  One more thing, since it's winter time, I put the brittle outside on my porch to cool it quickly (it was a clear day, no flurries!).

This is the best! I tried it with both salted and unsalted dry nuts. Both were exceptional. I've been making batches since before Christmas.

This brittle tastes just as good as other brittles.  I had to change the recipe a bit because I didn't have and ingredient, but it still tasted the same.  The consistency was good, too.  Above all, it was so easy.

Thank you for the great recipe. Everyone who tasted this loves it. Even me and I usually don't eat peanut brittle too often. I didn't have any peanuts so I used almonds, WOW that is sooo good!!
This is really fast too. Everyone is getting some for Christmas. So thanks again. Jesus loves you!!!

I have made peanut brittle in the past, but I had not made any in quite some time.  It always takes so much time.  I could not believe how easy this recipe was!  I made several batches for my children to take to school and give to their teachers.

All I can say is WOW!!!! Quick, easy and absolutely delicious. I did have to increase cooking time, as I have a lower wattage microwave, but the instructions told me what to look for and it worked perfectly. Made 2 batches to give as gifts, and everyone loved it Thanks, will use this again and again.Brynda

It took much longer than was listed to get to the stage where it can set and crack.  I had to microwave it several time.

I cannot say enough good about this recipe, sooo easy and soooo wonderful. My kid's really enjoyed the adding the baking soda at the end and wathing it "grow"! I made two batches (peanut and almond), which was great, in less than 20 min.

Good, easy, and quick recipe.  Nice brittle texture and not overly sweet.  I might have liked more butter flavor, but I don't know how increasing the butter might affect the texture.

This is truly amazing! I've made it with peanuts, cashews, almonds and pecans. One of the best recipes I've ever gotten from this site and so easy it defies logic!

This was a huge hit in our house!  My husband is a big fan of peanut brittle, so I tested this recipe as a surprise--he could hardly believe I made it.  Delicious, easy, and inexpensive--who could ask for anything more.  Thanks!

This recipe is awesome!  It is so buttery and light textured.  I made it for the holidays and it was a smashing success.  Make this and you'll never want to use the stovetop method again.

My students had a great time making (and eating) this peanut brittle on our "no-bake baking" day for Christmas.  Fun and easy -- and REALLY good.

I loved this recipe!  I just made 4 batches in a little over an hour.  I also substituted cashews for the peanuts in 2 of the batches and the cashew lovers in my family love it.  The only problem I ran into was that the brittle started to harden really quickly so it was a bit difficult to spread in the pan.  But all in in, a fantastic, quick, easy, great tasting recipe!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I made it for my husband as a surprise.  I don't like peanut brittle but this recipe has changed my mind.  It took only eight minutes on a 1000 watt microwave.  Six minutes for the first part and two minutes for the second part.  It was very easy to break apart and not too hard on the teeth.

I loved everything about this recipe.! I wasnt sure what type of peanuts to use so i bought a bag of blanched ones. They worked great! This tastes very good:)
