Excellent salad; my husband and I really liked it. It was a bit sweet for my taste but my husband liked it. I added extra vinegar to suit my taste. It tasted even better the next day, but the ramen noodles were a little soft. You might want to try making this early in the day to marinate and then add the noodles just before serving.

Excellent for a quick salad to take to pot lucks or parties.  I have tried a few and this has been a hit everytime.  I would recommend this recipe to anyone of my friends or family.

I really enjoyed this today for lunch. I omitted the sugar and added a few splashes of soy sauce. Cabbage is now considered one of the top ten healthiest foods, so I was very pleased that I could incorporate this into my diet so deliciously. Thanks!

Very good, quick recipe. First time I shredded, now I use a bag of cole slaw mix, it already has some carrots in it,I add some if time. I Just cut back on the oil a little and my 5 year old ate it up. Thanks for the recipe. Ive made it 3x already it satisfies the munchies and has the crunch I like.

I make this salad for potlucks or family functions.  It's great! Everyone loves it :) However, it must be eaten the first day because like any salad, it gets soggy.

This is a staple at all family gatherings, only we use coleslaw mix in place of the carrots & cabbage, and cashews or sunflower nuts in place of the sesame seeds.  We actually like it better the next day even though the noodles get soft.

v. good!  my husband won't try it though, b/c he says it smells too vinegary.  me, i can sip vinegar, so this was really up my alley.  perfect for a summer sunday like today.  (a few hours later)  i decided this salad was a little sweet!  ended up adding more vinegar, and will possibly go back and add some green onions.

I loved this recipe.  It has a delicious taste.  I bought already shredded Broccoli instead of the cabbage and added alittle more rice vinegar for a sweeter taste. I also added sunflower seeds.

We all loved this recipe, even both kids ages 9 and 13 who often complain. I did make a few changes, I doubled the noodles, I added mandarine oranges, and didn't use the seeds or nuts and served it with chicken skewers. Will make it often, even for friends.

Per other reviewers I cut back on sugar because we don't like sweet salads.  I followed the rest of the recipe and it was really bland.  I added 3 more tablespoons of rice vinegar, more pepper, and 1 T. of garlic powder.  Mixed again and was vastly improved...but still lacks something.

Very good and very easy. I followed the recipe just as instructed and as other reviewers did I also added green onions, chicken and some tosted almonds. My wife and I loved it. As my wife took her first she said, "Oh I love it" Needless to say we will have this again real soon. One  additional note: Make sure that you make the dressing at least one hour before and stirring several times making sure that the dressing is well blended before adding to the salad.

Very, very good!  I changed nothing in the recipe. Since the recipe did not designate a particular flavor of ramen noodles and because I like spicy food, I used a chicken picante flavor.  I hoped there would be a hot element to the dish, but there wasn't.  However, it was good and I wouldn't change a thing.  I didn't use all the toasted sesame seeds but someone else might.  I ate 1/3 of the bowl by myself because it was so crunchy and good.  I will make it again for sure. Thanks for such a good recipe!!

I've made this 5 times this summer, so easy & so good! I use a bag of shredded coleslaw mix to be quicker. Everyone loves it & it's not as salty or high in sugar as several other recipes for this salad. Cheaper too w/o the cashews. I bought the sesame oil, pre-toasted sesame seeds & rice vinegar for 1/2 of the cost of my grocery store, by going to a local asian market.

I made this following the recipe and it was really bland compared to other similar salads.  I made it a day ahead to let the flavors meld a little bit, but wound up adding extra vinegar and some soy sauce to give it flavor.

I have made this recipe several times and it is always a hit.

I use less margarine to brown the noodles and then I drain them on a few paper towels.  That process absorbs quite a bit of the fat and also makes for crispier noodles. I've also used plain white vinegar if that's all I have and the dressing still taste great.

Like some other reviewers, I keep the dressing, noodle mix and cabbage separate until ready to serve.

My family loves this salad! We use the coleslaw mix with carrots, green onions and we double the amounts for the dressing, with the exception of the sugar (we generally use 3 tbls instead of 4 tbls). It seems perfect with double dressing!

Very good and REALLY quick.  I also used the packaged 'slaw' (2 bags to double) and it took me approx 10 minutes.  I doubled the recipe and took it to a picnic.  The noodles stayed crunchy for about 4 hours.  It was perfect!

I didn't find it too appetizing. Sure, it was easy to make though. A little on the sweet side, I'd say. I had cooked broccoli and didn't know what to do with it, so I searched for a sesame dressing to eat it with. However, after making this dressing and trying it, I realised that I'd much rather have my brocolli in a vinaigrette - 2 tbsp olive oil, 1 to 1.5 tbsp balsamic vinegar, 1 to 1.5 tsp soy sauce.

This was good, I made it to accompany some Terriyaki Chicken and some steamed rice. I think next time I will use coleslaw mix and let the veggies marinate for a little while.

Chinese Cabbage Salad Haiku: "What flavor ramen?? Wouldn't that affect the taste? Also, it's too sweet." Recipe doesn't indicate what flavor ramen to use so w/ my pantry choices of Oriental (tried and true packet of blue, college memories of Veg-all cans mixing w/ you) or Chicken (ahh, good ol' orange's always good, for cheap college late-night food), I went w/ Oriental, and that seasoning seemed to jive well w/ this recipe. Also made this even easier by using a bag of coleslaw mix, but OHNO, this was cloyingly sweet w/ 2 TB sugar and we had a tough time eating it, and even more disappointing to throw so many leftovers away. If I made this again, I would drop the sugar entirely!

I have been making this salad for a couple of years. We love it. I toast the ramen noodles also. Sometimes I add toasted almonds to it when I toss it for extera crunch.

Halved the sugar in this recipe to make sure I wasn't over doing it and sure enough it came out just fine. In addition since I did not have top ramen packet (can we say all salt and MSG?) I substituted my all purposes seasoning (eyeballed it) and omitted the noodles (raw noodles in a salad?????). Other than that a better dinner worthy recipe.

Great salad! I added green onions and toasted slivered almonds. Nice additional crunch. The flavor develops even more the 2nd day.

I have tasted so many variations of this popular salad.  I had very high hopes for this one, but I was unable to get the sesame oil (the kicker ingredient!)  I threw in a little bottled sesame salad dressing and it turned out okay.  Not fabulous.  I will try again with the sesame oil and hope it turns out better.

Just okay for me.  The dressing was sort of bland.  I added cooked shrimp and served it as a main dish.  I like sweet and crunchy salad from this site much better.

This salad is addicting!  The toasted sesame seeds really make it.  Next time though I will make a smaller batch because it was not as tasty the next day.  Makes a great lunch!

I actually had red & Napa cabbage in the fridge, so I shredded the red cabbage and carrot, then towel dried them slightly to get rid of some moisture. Then chopped the Napa cabbage finely. I also used a flavored garlic rice vinegar instead of just regular. LOVED IT! Thanks!!

Made today.  I used hot chili sesame oil which gave it a nice kick; otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  Tasted great.  Then I added shredded chicken breast , coated with some of the extra dressing, to make it a lunch salad. YUM!
Update - I had the leftovers of this salad for lunch the next day and it was dry.  Ramen noodles absorbed all of the dressing.  So eat this the day you make it or be prepared to add more dressing.

Toast the crushed noodles with the sesame seeds and they stay crunchy a bit longer.  I make a batch of this and then eat it for lunch with diced leftover chicken or port for a real meal.  I don't mind that the noodles soften. It still tastes great 2 days later.

I agree with MommyBennett.  It's the rice Vinegar and the sesame oil that give it the authentic Chinese flavor.  I just looked at my bottle of sesame oil and it is made in Tokyo, Japan. (Who knew?).  I live alone and can nosh on this recipe for several days.  I really don't mind when the ramen noodles get soft.  They just soak up the flavors.  The toasted sesame seeds make it special.

Hi, I make this salad but my recipe is for a large group of people. It calls for a head of cabbage. It also has toasted slivered almonds. I make ahead but add the almonds, sesame seeds, and ramien noodles just before serving. You are rignt, everyone loves it and asks for the recipe.

This recipe is very simple and tastes great.  I was looking for a quick cabbage side dish, and this worked! I didn't have carrots, and substituted white vinegar and reg. vegetable oil. I also mixed some canned tuna into my portion to make a healthy salad, and it was delicious.

2.2.20   I thought the dressing was a little weak in flavor, so I did add a bit more sesame oil, rice vinegar, and a splash of soy sauce.  We’re not into too much sweetness these days, so I cut the sugar back a bit, and then the dressing was just about perfect for our taste.  I used black sesame seeds to give this a little more eye appeal, and you really could see them.  I will use one tablespoon of sesame seeds next time instead of two, but this was a very nice side dish to sous vide teriyaki london broil and chili-glazed grilled fresh pineapple.

This is so good. I only used 1.5 TB of sugar and added an extra TB of seasoned rice vinegar. I also added two cut up green onions to the mix and used match stick carrots I had on hand. I omitted the almonds and kept the ramen on the side and tossed it in when serving. 

It was absolutely delicious and I will definitely make it again.

Recipe is good as is and is also perfect for all kinds of mods.  add some chili oil for more "snap"  red cabbage for color,  dig around the pantry - that tad of chow mien noodles you've been saving - very good match

I made this to the recipe except for subbing a bit of soy sauce for the ramen seasoning packet. I think it used way too much sesame oil, which really overpowered any of the other flavors. Probably needs only half what was called for.

Very strong sesame taste. I was ok with the flavor but would add less as you can not eat too much of this as it is.. My husband would not eat it as he thought the flavors were too strong and it was bitter.

I used to make this salad when I worked at the Cub foods deli. It was always my favorite. I was so happy to find it here. 

To those trying to get rid of the sugar, it's supposed to be sweet. A little sugar will not hurt you. This is also a side item not a main dish.

I'm going to use it to use up extra cabbage after making corned beef and cabbage.

I read all of the reviews ahead, so I left out the sugar, added soy sauce, sriracha sauce and cayenne pepper to the dressing.  I toasted the noodles & seeds in my toaster oven & used 2 bags of the tri-color shredded cabbage & 1 bag of shredded broccoli mix.  It turned out fabulous!

I did marinate the dressing with the cabbage and carrots for 6-8 hours.  It was somewhat soggy.  I then added sunflower seeds in place of sesame seeds and crushed ramen noodles. I also cut down on the sugar due to other reviews .  The sogginess improved but I considered it only OK

I reduced the sugar from 2 to 1 tbsp and it was just right for me. I've had this salad at potlucks and loved it so it was awesome finding the recipe on Allrecipes.

Ramen noodles can be bought plain (without seasoning), so if ramen packet seasoning is in the recipe....it should be on the ingredient list.

Since neither my DH nor DD would touch this, I had a few days to devour this myself. Using canola oil and subbing toasted almond slices for the sesame seeds, I found the dressing needed MUCH more rice wine vinegar to suit my tastes.  An easy fix, however. I also didn't notice any flavor from the ramen seasoning packet in the dressing (I used the oriental flavor) and was a tad disappointed by that. I toasted the ramen noodles along with the sliced almonds, which was a nice suggestion by another reviewer. All in all, I will definitely make this again (for myself) and tweak it slightly to please my palate.

Great recipe I back off too much sugar, the cabbage makes it pretty sweet enough.

I looked up this recipe after having something similar (exact same?) at a potluck. It is delicious. Now it is a weekly staple. Sometimes I add marinated tofu for extra heartiness.

This was a perfect side dish to our pot stickers last night. I love the asian flavors (I used the shrimp flavored Ramen Noodles/spice packet). I did need to add a bit more rice vinegar and I used 1 tsp of sesame oil, to have enough dressing to coat the amount of cabbage that I had (I didn't really measure my cabbage though, just used 1/2 of a small head that I had in my frig to use up). I also added a few green onions cut on the diagonal, just for an added touch of color). Will make again.

Loved it!!!!!!  I added a tablespoon or so of Laura Scudder crunch peanut butter and some cumin which gave it more depth.  I'm making it tomorrow for work.

Was even better the next day? Was skeptical about not cooking the cabbage, but it turned out great!!
