A good recipe, but this can serve a lot more than 4. This recipe could serve 8.

Excellent taste combinations, but way more orange juice than necessary.  Two cups max.

I served this at a dinner party and got plenty of oohs and ahs, despite how easy it was to make. We used gingersnaps as the cookie, which was GOOD. The store was out of amaretto, so I just used Grand Marnier, and it was still yummy. I don't think that amount of OJ was really necessary, and it did make a little more than expected as someone else had mentioned. Overall a very good dessert! :)

This was a nice and refreshing dessert.  I cut the recipe down to 1/8 because it was just for me, and I used only 1/4 cup of orange juice based on what other reviewers said about the amount of orange juice.  I wish I would have added cinnamon sugar rather than just cinnamon so that I could caramelize the apples just slightly.  If the apples were already to go, this would make a very nice dessert for company.  Thanks for the recipe, TIME2SING!
