As it stands, it's pretty bland.  I ommitted two cups of flour and added 1 box of Jiffy corn bread mix and 1/2 cup corn meal.  I used one egg, 3/4 lb of shrimp, and a bunch of chopped green onions.  Then it was truly magnificent.  It tasted like shrimp hushpuppies.  Don't worry about looking for the kucai, any chives will do and add water as needed to make a thick sticky  paste consistency.  make these changes and yu've got a 5 star.

As it stands, pretty bland.  Throwing in lots more shrimp or cut the flour would greatly improve this recipe.  Not a bad idea for quick snacky thing.
