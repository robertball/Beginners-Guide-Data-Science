This is a really easy snack/dessert, and very addicting!  I improved it by spreading vanilla frosting on a tortilla, then adding the sugar/cinnamon mix.  My roommate and I make these in our quesadilla maker with the frosting on one side and a little butter on the other- very good!

I used whole wheat tortillas and thought they were good.  However they would be great drizzled with honey or chocolate syrup!

It doesn't get much easier than this! Perfect for when you're craving something sweet. It goes great with fresh apple slices.

I made these as a 12 year-old kid. They're addictive. I still make them some 20 years later. A fun varation is to "fry" the tortilla coated with butter in a pan and THEN sprinkle cinnamon and sugar on your cinnamon tostada. Gracias!

Easy, yummy. Remind anyone else of junior high? Good tip: use those raw tortillas from Tortilla Land, you get them at Costco.  I've also seen some at Walmart. After cooking one side, flip it and spread on the butter, cinn/sugar. It just melts in as the other side cooks  -world of difference!

These are not only great to use up old tortillas, but it's a quick snack for the kids. I serve it up with sliced apples and a marshmellow/yogurt dip. My kids flip for it.

Because I don't like the soft microwave texture, I baked mine. i used a pizza cutter and sliced them into 1 inch(width)strips and then sliced them again, so they were about 4 inches long. Placed them on a baking sheet, put spray butter on them and then sprinkled cinnamon sugar on them. Set the oven to 400 degrees and bake them for 6-8 minutes. Yummy! crispy and tasty. low calorie yummy snack.

In Texas we fry the tortilla, use a paper towel to soak up the grease and coat it with the sugar/cinnamon mixture. And we call it a bunuello!  Kids seem to like the crunchy version better than the soft.  It should work with the raw tortilla dough as well.  But you can cook them on a griddle or frying pan(cast iron works best) without any oil.  They are not as crisp and they taste great with nothing but butter, too.

I make these for my kids and sometimes even for me!  I love them "baked" or "fried" as well, nice and toasted and crunchy.

This was fantastic.  We made at least ten over the weekend.  You can add lowfat butter and low carb tortillas to make this a little bit healthier.  You don't even need to measure the ingredients.

I accidently bought a 10-pack of tortillas when I only needed 8.  It was a good way to use up the other two and give us a dessert for the enchilladas I made.   Butter and cinnamon sugar...YUM!

These ARE great!  I make these by putting two slices in a muffin pan the larger ends first and letting the 'pointed' over lap pan.  This make a great cup for you favorite filling.  I like marshmallow cream and cream cheese (blended together) with cinnamon dusted on top.

I grew up eating this.  Using a butter 'spread' made it taste a little like plastic.  The way we do it is to heat a pan on low, and place the tortilla in the pan.  When the tortilla is warm take a stick of butter and rub it across the tortilla - just enough to make it so the cinnamon sugar mix will stick.  Then, roll it up like a burrito and enjoy!  I like mine with the outside just a little crispy, but my husband likes his warmed.

Very good.  If you spread the tortilla with "Nutella", a hazelnut/cocoa delight, it is super good as a variation.  Also, the spread is low fat

Holy #$@*! I just let my boss carry on a one-sided conversation for an entire phone call because I couldn't stop eating this. I used the same ingredients (real butter, though) and prepared it a little differently based on ideas from other reviewers. I fried the tortilla in butter and sprinkled the cinnamon sugar on after flipping and served it open face. My husband said it was delicious and that's practically effusive from a man who doesn't share my enthusiasm for food.

So quick and easy! I placed the tortilla rolls on a cookie sheet and into the oven at 350 for about 5 minutes. They were lightly crisped and delicious! I also made them as tortilla chips by cutting the tortillas into triangles with a pizza cutter. Also good - but I liked the roll ups better. This is a real quick fix when you are looking for something sweet and low fat to snack on.

Very good and sweet. We spread cream cheese on one tortilla and butter on the other to see which tasted better. They were both equally good but the butter does tend to leak out.

I did make adjustments - I very lightly spread each tortilla with margarine (less than 1/2 tsp on each one), sprinkled it with cinnamon sugar, cut each one in 8 triangles and baked them at 375 degrees for 6 to 8 minutes, delicious with a blueberry salsa!

I give this simple snack 4 stars as is, but 4 someone like me it was missing the Umph in it. I replace the butter with cream cheese & hit the bulls eye. reminds me of a cinnabon! So then I decided to take it another notch and added fresh ripe Strawberries(sliced)upon rolling. OMG! Absolute Best! I used the oven for mine at a set temp of 350 heat 4 less than a minute your tortilla should still be soft & heat just enough 2 break down the cream cheese and C&S mixture. thanks for the recipe.

Made this receipe tonight after I told my 11 year old twins about it, who by the way both love cinnamon and sugar. We made a taste test out of it. Made the receipe but browned the tortillas instead of microwaving. Then I browned the tortillas until they were golden brown and less pliable, sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar, cut them with a pizza cutter and topped with whip cream. This was a total BIG HIT!!! YUM!!! however when the tortillas plump up you have to put a slit in them to let out the air so be careful.

Great recipe!  I used it with home-made tortillas, and did it right as they came off the skillet. Added peanut-butter swirl ice cream inside after the first few, and the combination of hot and cold was amazing!

I make this a lot, mostly in place of toast after breakfast.  I do it a little differently though.  I "try" to eat low carb, so I use Mission brand low carb tortillas.  Also, I found that putting the butter on before putting it into the microwave causes it to melt all over the place.  So what I do is put the tortilla on a paper towel in the microwave and heat it for 10 seconds, and then, having everything else out and waiting already, quickly spread enough butter over all the tortilla to moisten it all, even to the edges, then sprinkle on the cinnamon. At this point I fold it over in different directions enough times to moisten all the cinnamon (dry cinnamon isn't very pleasing!) then I use a packet of Splenda all over it and roll it up and enjoy!  Very tasting snack.

I have always loved Sopapillas for dessert in Mexican restaurants, so I was thrilled to find this simple recipe.  I have a Quesadilla maker, so I spread soft butter from a tub on a flour tortilla, put another tortilla on top, and "smushed" them together to make sure the butter got spread around on both.  Then I separated them, sprinkled a generous amount of  cinnamon sugar on one, put the other one back on top, and baked my snack  in the Quesadilla maker until it was crispy and browned.   Then I cut it into six wedges and dipped them in honey.   DELICIOUS!

Delicious way to use up an old tortilla but as we have only butter in the house - not exactly what I would call a low fat snack.

This is quick and easy, just what I was looking for, but I didn't want to use that much butter. So I cut it down to 1 tsp of 75% fat free Elle & Vire extra lite butter. Since I didn't have cinnamon sugar, I made my own using 1 tsp cinnamon and 3 tsp muscovado sugar. I mixed the butter, sugar and cinnamon together before spreading them onto three whole wheat tortillas. All in all, this guilt-free but tasty snack comes down to just 280 calories.

I made this today for an afternoon snack for my 3 boys and my nephew and they were a hit!  Instead of putting them in the micro, I just popped into the toaster oven for 5 mins to make them a bit more crispy!  Super yummy, will make these more often for sure.  Used whole wheat tortillas and served with some sliced apples to round out the nutritional value :)

I was up late studying and had a craving for something sweet. I came across this recipe and it was PERFECT! Took care of my sweet tooth and was super easy. I used a mixture of brown sugar (all i had) and cinnamon - it was perfect!

Uh oh!  Now were making Mexican Lefse....we Norwegian Americans make a tortilla like bread every year at Christmas, thinner than tortillas and made with potatoes.  We serve it with butter and sugar, sometimes adding cinnamon to the sugar...

It tastes even better with cream cheese intstead of butter!!!! The cream cheese melts and gets super sweet mixed with the cinnamon sugar. I would only put it in the microwave for about 10 seconds though. DELICIOUS!

A very delicious dessert in under 5 minutes - how can you go wrong?  Instead of microwaving these, I rolled mine (being sure to tuck in the ends) and fried in a bit of butter.  Apart from the rolls unfolding a little when I turned them (I had to use a toothpick in each to keep them together), they turned out perfectly.  Crispy and sweet, super yummy and very fast...we will definitely make these again.

I'd give this four stars for the recipe as written, but add in a handful or so of semi-sweet chocolate chips before microwaving it, and it's worthy of 10 stars! Definately my new favorite evening dessert. I can't wait to introduce my roommate to this!

I like the idea and taste of this recipe. Unfortunately, I found the texture a bit "gummy" done this way (microwaving). I think I will try baking in the toaster oven briefly instead of using the microwave. Thanks for sharing!

I thought these were good.  Quick and easy!   I think next time I'll try adding vanilla frosting, then the cinnamon sugar as another reviewer suggested.  I'd also like to try these fried.

For a little extra treat to this recipe - put in chocolate chips.  Make the recipe just like it says but add chocolate chips and then put in the microwave for about 15-20 seconds.  It will really hit the spot for you chocolate lovers out there.  UMMMMM good...

I made these as a snack for my son after school. He didn't care about them at all, he asked me to make one with peanut butter instead and I added some fine little pieces of apple. That's his new thing now.

This is a great snack and easy to make! I decided that it could use something else so I took some strawberries and 2 tbs of sugar, smashed it and mixed it, then put it in the fridge and it made it taste a lot more better.

Changed it up a little  and LOVED it - 

Took a stick of butter and just rubbed it lightly over one side of the tortilla, then put it in the skillet with heat a little above low. Waited about 20 seconds, then rubbed butter on the up-facing side and coated with cinnamon sugar. Then removed from the skillet and put two thin apple slices next to each other and rolled it up around them. SO good!

I thought this was amazing. I used whole wheat tortillas and I added a vanilla glaze to it. Very yummy.

Haven't tried this one, but it sounds identical to the lefsa we ate growing up. Without the potatoes of course.

I was making these 35+ years ago for my kids.  We all loved them.  At that time I didn't have a microwave so heated the torilla in a pan just to get it warm enough for the butter to melt.

I've been making the flat/toaster version of this.  Spread the butter and sprinkle cinnamon sugar, slide it in the flat toaster oven without rolling up(not regular toaster!) Toast it until sugar starts to bubble and edges are light brown. I love the combination of crispy edges and soft inside.

This is VERY good! I added red frosting from a tube because I was bored and absolutely LOVED it! Very easy to make. For fun you could add sprinkles.

I tweaked this recipe a little bit and use mascarpone cheese as the spread, popped it into a 350 degree preheated oven for 2 minutes, then drizzled honey over it after it was done. My 17 month old and I loved it! The microwave isn't a terrible idea, but I had just cooked supper and the oven was still hot. Also, I know how slow my son eats and if I would have put the tortilla in the microwave then by the time he would have been halfway thru it, the tortillas would have gotten hard.

I did a variation on a variation-cooked each side in butter, adding sugar and cinnamon after flipping them over. It got a bit too burned, but was still good.

I had just ran out of butter when i read this.  I substituted marscarpone cheese that had a little maple syrup in it and followed the recipe as it is.  Nice substitute for pastry dough.  My grandson loved it!

Great idea.  I never thought of putting cinnamon on a tortilla, but after seeing this, I tried it for breakfast.  (I know, real nutritious.)  I had actually made my own tortillas for the first time the day before, so mine were particularly awesome--even though they were more amoeba-shaped than round.  I reheated mine on a skillet, then spread on real butter before sprinkling with sugar and cinnamon.  Addicting.

Our Great Gram taught us to make cinnamon & sugar toast as pre-teens and we are now in our late 30s. We toasted our bread, spread with oleo and sprinkled with cinnamon & sugar. Great !  This recipe was a reminder of how we made the toast.  Thanks

this is a recipe that my son brought home from summer camp, many years ago. The kids got to choose the ingredients, like peanut butter,chocolate/hazelnut spread, brown sugar, cinnamon, apples etc and they would cook them in a cast iron frying pan over the wood fire. No wonder they loved camp so much!

This is the coolest sweet snack. After the kids went to bed my husband and I had a craving during a movie. We did not have much in the cupboard. I remembered the recipe and looked it up. It was a hit. We stuffed ourselves silly. I made it the next day for my 7 year old. He loved it. GREAT SNACK!

Pretty blah, I wouldn't make again.  But then again, I didn't expect much from such a simple and, ahem, healthy alternative to my cinnamon-sugary things cravings!
