Awesome Cake, made it for a family get together and everyone loved it. The only thing i changed was substituting pecans for the walnuts. And I will probably only bake it 30 minutes the next time i make it so it will have more of a cake like texture. But loved the taste YUM....

These really should be called mississippi mud brownies.  They are so dense and thick - just like the perfect brownie.  My boyfriend and I absolutely LOVED this recipe.  I may use the base "cake" part as my regular brownie recipe.  Thank you so much!  Fabulous dessert!

This is really more like a brownie than a cake. It is pretty dense, really chewy... and really fabulous! I'd definitely make it again. I made this recipe exactly as noted, except I also ground up some Oreos and added on top the icing, to give the "mud" cake a "dirt" topping. I also added some gummy worms on top just for fun.

4.5 stars! But three things: 1) I forgot the nuts; 2) I made it the night before and served it cold -- which I loved; and 3) I was appalled by the amount of sugar in this recipe and had to reduce it somehow.  I ended up cutting back the amount of powdered sugar in the recipe by a full cup (down to 2c), and it was perfect. I loved the ooey-gooeyness (sp?) of it.

Made this recipe exactly as stated, so good and easy!  If I don't have nuts on had, I just substitute coconut.  I think it's a little bit better with coconut :)

I love this cake.  It seemed a little more like a brownie.  It didn't rise very high but gosh it is a great sweet.  I might bake it a less then the 35 minutes.  I left out the nuts because some people just don't like nuts and it is wonderful without them.

Great recipe.  I made this the first time last May for my son's teachers.  I didn't try it since it was a gift but they loved it.  However, the icing seemed thin with lumps of butter.  Apparently I didn't mix it long enough.  So when I made it again I let it mix for about 2-3 minutes on medium speed and it turned out perfect.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is not really cake but rather a brownie with a sweet frosting.  I have a true sweet tooth and this was too sweet for me.

This cake was very good. I made it for my sister's birthday. My three year old daughter helped. We had a lot of fun and the cake tasted great. It is a very sweet cake.

Cake was excellent, really dense and moist, but I wasnt finding  the mississippi mud aspect of it.  I melted some peanut butter and added it in too.. sooo good.

I have been looking for this recipe for ages!  I made a similar cake 'back in the day' for church potlucks.  It was always a big hit and goes far as it is very rich.  I can't wait to make it again.

This is by far the best dessert Ive made in a long time. We used to have Mississippi Mud Cake growing up and this taste just like the one mom made.

This cake is a sugar overload, but very addictive!  You think you've had too much, but then you want more.  The second time around, we put a layer of cookie dough on the bottom, then made the rest of the cake on top of that.  AMAZING!  You will need to adjust the cooking time, but it's out of this world good!

SOOOOO GOOD!  I don't like nuts so I didn't add any and I didn't have marshmallow creme so I melted some marshmallows with peanut butter and used that.  Great recipe!

This one was just okay for me. VERY rich, so if that's what you're looking for, it would be worth trying. It was just a little over the top for me. The cake, as others have said, was more like a brownie. I think I would have liked the topping better on more traditional chocolate cake. My kids loved it.

My fiance said this was great.  I couldn't finish the piece I cut for myself.  It was just a bit much for my sweet tooth. Probably won't make it again, unless he requests it for his birthday.

i think an empty disk tells you how good the recipe is.  i don't like marshmallows but i got rave reviews.  it is very important to add the fluff and icing while the cake is hot.  a must try!

This was really good once I cut the sugar content in HALF, from 2 cups to 1 cup.  Way too sweet the first time.  I gave it four stars, but it's not cake, it's a brownie recipe.

My family loves it! One of my grandsons requested I make it for his birthday cake and now I’m out visiting my daughter and her family and she brought this very cake up today. She asked me if I made it anymore. I will be making it for her family while I’m here. I frequently make this. It’s very easy to make and so good!

Love this cake.  Reminds me of Texas sheet cake but even better with the marsh mellow cream.  Perfect for parties or family dinner.  I used Pecans instead of Walnuts.

This is similar to the recipe I used to have but not quite. I found it was way under done at 35 minutes.. Not quite done at 45. There's also too much milk in the buttercream icing. It was way too thin to form a thin crust when mixed w the marshmallow cream.

I made this recipe as it is written and it was way too sweet for both my husband and I.  The children ate it the first night but didn't ask for anymore.

Dense, rich, and chocolaty!  I especially love the fudge-y icing.  I baked for 30 minutes and added marshmallows to the batter.

This is a wonderful rich cake.  I noticed the boys and men in the family especially liked this cake.  We have skipped a couple of years making this, but everyone is wanting it again.

I won second place in a front porch decorating contest at The Deli Man and the Cake Lady here in Chattanooga.  I looked up this recipe, gave it to the baker, she baked it and WOW!! is it delicious!!  Almost decadent.  I felt like Emeril when I first tasted this cake.  I'll continue to look for more recipes on this web sight.

Loved it! First time making this type of cake. I did something wrong though and the icing was too crunchy, so next time Ill just use hot fudge instead. Great with whipped cream on top too!

Absolutley love Mississippi Mud. I've been eating this cake since I was a kid.  I had to leave out the nuts since my son doesn't like them and added some large marshmallows the edge of the pan since my cream didn't quite cover it all.  So yummy!
