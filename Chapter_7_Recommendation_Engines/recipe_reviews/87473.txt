Hi my name is Othasha  and I came up with this recipe and i have been reading the reviews & would just like to say that the mustard is not so much for a strong mustard flavor but more so to make the chicken tender and juicy.You still get a hint of the mustard flavor but its not going to taste like your eating mustard on a hotdog & also if you are having problems with the batter not sticking you must not be doing something right because i deep fry every single time and it comes out crispy and juicy with all the crispy skin still on the chicken. . As far as the seasoning goes i just season to taste because everyone is different & some people like less rather than more like me so with all that said i hope this helps with the recipe and to all of you that loved it i really appreciate you taking the time to write a review. On last note i also add different spices to get different flavors so to all of you who do that keep on because its fun trying new recipes on chicken i do it every time i fry it. I ALSO SEASON MY FLOUR TO GIVE A  BIT MORE FLAVOR TO CHICKEN

Very good. I skipped the MSG and added dry mustard and cayenne to the flour mixture. Turned out great, thanks!

This is a keeper. I followed the recipe but added A LOT more seasoning before putting in the flour. I put all the wings in a tray and smothered with various seasonings, including garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, pepper and adobo. I also used a spanish seasoning called sazon goya (about 3 packets) and made 15 large wings. This recipe is incredible. I added some adobo to the flour and used spicy brown mustard. YUMMY. I do not fry often but I can see making this once a month as a fried treat!

I've been frying my chicken like this forever. Family recipe. To add a little twist & make it a little bit healthier (if that's possible with fried chicken), omit the MSG(taste good but DEADLY for you), and use WHOLE wheat flour (not wheat flour). It has 3grams of fiber & whole grains, but tastes no different!  We all need more fiber in our diet. Enjoy.

Delicious!  I thought I had yellow mustard in the fridge, but I didn't, so instead I had to use spicy brown.  I found it easier to coat the chicken in mustard first, then seasoning.  As seasoning first and brushing on the mustard just causes the seasoning to clump up and rub off.  Will definitely make again, it's the best fried chicken that's ever come out of my kitchen.

This was great.  I did make a few changes to the recipe... I added some cayenne pepper to the spices, and for the mustard I used hot mustard with horseradish.  I also added a small amount of hot pepper sauce to the mustard.  I got tons of compliments and everybody ate it up!

Very good! I followed this recipe to the letter, with the exception of some red pepper for zing and it was delicious. The whole family loved it.

I didn't exactly follow the directions to the recipe nor do I use all the same ingredients but the recipe did provide a wonderful basis for the delicious fried chicken I just made.
I used chicken breast instead of wings, and seasoned the flour with garlic salt, onion powder, oregano, coriander, and a dash or two of adobo. I coated the chicken breast with store dijon mustard and fried the chicken in olive oil.

Honestly, it was the best fried chicken I've had so far in life.
 
It was savory and salty and just all around amazing. The spices really complimented the dijon mustard and the crust was too, well-- crusty!

I can't wait to make this recipe again. :-)

I love mustard chicken so I'm really glad I found this recipe! I never would have thought to make mustard fried chicken so thank you for introducing it to me and everyone else. Also, I've seen a few comments talking about the flour not sticking. Try adding a couple of beaten eggs to the chicken wings before you flour them. That should help. :)
As for the people complaining about the MSG....this isn't rocket science. If you don't like it, don't use it! Sheesh!

Delish!!!!!! The mustard makes the chicken very juicy on the inside and so crispy on the outside. My hubby hates mustard but he didn't even taste it! LOL I'll make this again with boneless/skinless breast next time.

Great recipe. I'm only giving 4 stars because I amended the recipe by adding chicken seasoning and season salt to the flour mixture. Also, I added 2 tbsp of honey to the mustard mixture and used dijon mustard, instead of regular mustard. I fried the chicken briefly to get a nice golden brown crust (15 minute), put the chicken in a baking pan and drizzled it with honey mustard dipping sauce found on this site and baked it for and additional 15-20 minutes. Wonderful, Wonderful fried chicken!!!... rich in flavor and very moist.

I am always searching for new things, that my picky son will eat.  He loves mustard, so I used a bit more, but he loved it.  It is a big hit here.

I finally tried this after sitting in my recipe box for over a year.  It was wonderful!  I added dry mustard to enhance the mustard flavor but other than that i prepared recipe as is and I've added it to our regular rotation.

I have made this recipe over and over again! I absolutely love it! The only difference in mine is I just omit the MSG. These wings always come out crispy and delicious and my family raves over it! Recently I got a deep fryer and I cooked the wings in that instead of a skillet and it came out even better. I top mine off with a wing sauce I made that is awesome! It is a mix of hot sauce, teriyaki sauce and butter. It is amazing! Thank you so much for this yummy recipe! I love it!!

I love this recipe.  I mixed all the ingredients with the mustard and let it sit for a couple of hours in the ref before deep frying them.  Great taste and you didn't even taste the mustard.

this is great, i just have a tip, to help keep the flour on the chicken before frying try using a paper bag. The flour sticks to plastic.

While I liked the idea of the flavors in this recipe, I had a terrible time with the recipe as it was written. When I read this, in the back of my mind I thought "what's there to hold the coating on in the fryer" trusting, I followed the recipe and wound up with a big batch of NAKED FRIED CHICKEN And a fryer FULL OF MUSTARD CHICKEN FRITTERS! If I were to try this again, I would add some mustard powder to egg for the base coating. If you follow this recipe you will understand. That's why it gets two stars.

MUSTARD HAS LONG BEEN A FAVORITE OF MY FAMILY TO SEASON FRIED CHICKEN.
ALTHOUGH MY SISTER AND GREAT AUNT LIKE TO USE YELLOW MUSTARD IN THERE CHICKEN I LIKE TO USE SPICY BROWN.
FOR ALL WHO'S HAVING TROUBLE WITH THE CRUST, TRY USING A LITTLE LESS MUSTARD OR TRY PUTTING THE FLOUR AND CHICKEN IN A ZIP LOCK BAG AND LEAVING THE CHICKEN IN FOR AN HOUR BEFORE YOU FRY!

The recipe has to much sodium. Make these changes and you will find a great meal.1. omit salt,garlic powder,onion powder and msg. add two garlic cloves,minced, one-third cup finely chopped onion use 3tbs dejon mustard(not Yellow) two-thirds cup mrs dash garlic-lime marinade. Combine all ingredients in a plastic bag or bowl coat all chicken place chicken on a non stick pan , bake 45 min @ 425 degrees. These changes will make the chicken tastier, moist, and above all 400mg less sodium. What people fail to know is all foods have some sodium in them that is natural. Now I would rate this @ 4+ stars.. Try it you will also. give it a higher rating.

okay...Not what I had hoped for...I tried it a couple of different ways, one with honey mustard, one with traditional mustard (both in the same batch) and was very disappointed.  Not much flavor and now, I have to clean out my deep fryer because most of the batter fell off.  They were nice and crispy out of the fryer, but softened quite a bit as they cooled...I will not be making this version again...

This recipe is smokin'! I was skeptical at first with adding the mustard, but found it enhanced the flavor of my chicken. Normally I use hot sauce with my seasonings to marinate for an hour or so before frying. Next time I will use both mustard and hot sauce plus seasonings.

I liked this recipe! I recently did a variation -- I left out the flour, used fresh garlic (pounded to a fine paste), fried it, and added a little water to make sauce. Yum!

I made this as a week day dinner. I seasoned the chicken they day before using my regular spices then basted with mustard.  I let the chicken sit overnight and continued with the recipe the following afternoon. My husband said the chicken was moist and flavorful.  My chicken was crispy on th outside, and moist on the inside, just like I like it!

Great recipe. I did't pre-season the chicken. I dipped the chicken in mustard and then into a flour, salt and pepper mix. Turned out prefect!

I added about two dashes of cayenne pepper, dried mustard and refrigerated the chicken once fully coated with seasoning, mustard and flour for 90 minutes in the fridge (this made it extra crispy) and the wings were absolutely delicious, moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. I made the mistake of letting my friend try one before I completely finished cooking dinner and it was very hard to make him wait until I was finished the main dish!

Finally a fried chicken recipe with TASTE....Salt and Pepper is a base, not Actual seasoning. I normally fry my chicken with multiple seasonings, but it’s nice to find a recipe that may have a different seasonings than I use.??

God bless you Othasha!!! I lost my old mustard fried chicken recipe and was happy to find this one. I generously coat my chicken with mustard and set aside.  I  put the seasonings and flour together  in a plastic grocery bag. You can add as much or as little of the seasonings as you want, according to your taste. Put the mustard covered chicken in the bag of flour and seasonings and shake to completely coat. Then fry. Yummy.

This is a new favorite for myself and family!  I followed the recipe exactly except I did not add MSG.  I made these in my deep fryer and had no issues with the flour mixture coming off.  These were so flavorful, perfectly crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  I have one child who detests mustard, but she loved these!  Super easy and fast to make.  With football season in swing, this is going to be a go to on Sundays when we are hosting.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was a major hit!! All my fried chicken recipes will be made this way from now on (my boyfriend said he won't eat them if not).  the only thing I did different was add the mustard on first then sprinkle the seasonings all over each chicken and then followed the rest of the recipe (it seems like too much seasoning, but use it all, trust me. I didn't use it all the first time, but it was still the bomb!)

Used boneless skinless breasts, cut in medium pieces.  Sprinkled seasonings on chicken, sprinkled with Tabasco, spread with spicy mustard and regular, then dredged with flour.  Quite tasty.

This was very good and chicken was moist.  For those that don't like "spicy", this might be the one for you.  I did add some Cajun shake to the chicken before I breaded it.  Just add it to taste but it was also very good without it.

Please note that this recipe is not for deep frying, this one is for pan fried chicken (the best kind IMHO). This is not a batter. it is a coating, and will fall off in a deep fryer. That being said, I love it but will be adding more spices next time.

Oh my!  This was amazing!  I wouldn't recommend having it every day, mind you (or even every week), but as a treat, it was really good.  I ommitted the MSG and used far less pepper (cooking for kids), and used half dijon and half regular mustard.  I'll use the recipe again, but bake it on a broiler pan or cookie sheet to reduce the fat.

I tried this recipe and it was definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing. My 11 y/o is a chicken wing King and he asked could he have these for breakfast.  As far as the reviewer who commented on the MSG...I appreciated the comment. Most people know that MSG is not the best thing for us, but some don't and yes we all do need more fiber..so I don't understand the snide response it illicited so just so you know I didn't take your comment the wrong way, just helpful tips.

Very very good. We never do fried wings in this house without making them "Buffalo". However, these were very tasty and easy to make. Next time I may substitute dijon for the yellow mustard, or partially perhaps. Nobody else in the house had a problem with the way they are, but I'm not a huge yellow mustard fan, and I could easily taste it coming through. That said, it did indeed make for a tangy marinade that held the flour very well when deep fried. Thanks for a great recipe!

I'd like to say good job to Aarianah for conjuring up this recipe. Although it was a bold move it actually tasted O.K.! 
Sometimes fried chicken becomes "Oh So boring" however different strokes for different folks! I enjoyed it! Therefore it is now in my recipe box!

Giirrlll you said the key secret ingredient: ACCENT!!!! Now for all of the food cautious people out there you can add or remove whatever seasoning to your taste. but let me tell you. when it comes to accent. unless you're like me and wants the extra seasoning for extra extra flavor. that Accent will bring out ANY spice you put on!! Now I don't use Accent everyday. but when I do. oh baby!

And this recipe was amazing. and I'm not even a mustard lover like that. but I love some fried chicken and was looking for something different to try. Thanks for sharing. it was awesome!!!

It was good. I had honey mustard Pringles, so I crunched them up and replaced 1 cup flour with the Pringles, because I could.  
(I know some people are review snobs & believe you can't rate a recipe if you make any alterations. I disagree. Simple changes based on personal preference is not a new recipe, it's a personal twist.)
Anyway, I loved the mustard wash instead of egg.  Nice twist to a classic. Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe...I have made this before. Chose to use organic drumsticks. Soaked in vinegar for  5 minutes (for cutting the game taste)before rinsing drumsticks off and cleaning them.  Love using tumeric with my chicken, in addition to other suggested spices. I always season to my cultural taste preferences. Also I pepper the flour, not the chicken directly.  Had baked zucchini, which was breaded with italian style breadcrumbs (after seasoning and an egg bath). Very lovely.

A little salty but aside from that it was great! I put all the spices and chicken into a bag and shook it up rather than laying it all out on the bag.

I tried the recipe,except I used white and dark meat, the parts that were cooked enough taste great..I did not let the chicken fry long enough..I don't think the mustard is there for the taste,it somehow makes the chicken crispy and juicy.. My b-il is a professional chef and he coats his turkey wings with mustard,deep fries them,they are crispy,juicy and tender with no mustard taste..

My aunt has been frying her chicken like this  for the last thirty years but with out the msg. she adds some hot sauce(Texas Pete)  to the yellow  mustard before the chicken is rolled in the mustard, this gives it a little spicy flavor .  then she dips it in  seasoned flour then she deep fries the chicken.

Pretty Good Recipe. I skipped the msg but other than that i followed the recipe exactly and it was pretty good. Not a strong mustard taste which is what i was hoping for. i fried them a bit longer than the recipe says, i like my chicken extra crispy. good recipe over all though!

Ive been. Making fried chicken for years and decided to make this recipe and man it was so good with the mustard , I notice it was juicy and soft. Even my daughter that never finishes her chicken down to the bone did so this time. This is an awesome recipe.

This is not a recipe I would use again. We found no difference in taste, the flour wouldn't stay on & the mustard tinged the oil yellow.

Just made this recipe tonight. My 12 yr old daughter asked for seconds. I enjoyed the twist of basting with mustard but couldn't really taste the mustard on the chicken. That was a downer for me but a huge plus for my daughter as she's not a fan of mustard. I do believe the addition of cayenne or something to give the recipe a "kick" is needed. Will definitely make again!!

excellent chicken everyone in the family loved it and we have 6 kids. I loved the fact that you take the skin off the chicken but no one noticed.
