This was so easy! I have made it two times now! The 2nd time I made it I made a few changes to the recipe. I used 2-28 oz. cans of italian style diced tomatoes instead of 2-16oz cans. When I previously made the recipe with 2- 16oz. cans and it wasn't saucy enough, plus I didn't drain the tomatoes so it was really watery. I also added Mrs. Dash Table Blend, Parsley, Oregano, Basil, Garlic Powder, Pepper, and Onion Flakes to season the chicken and I added a little bit more to the dish before serving. The additional seasoning made it have more flavor, which was way better then the original recipe.

This was as stated, quick and easy and very good.  My changes; used whole olives sliced in half length wise, sprinkled chicken generously with garlic powder and italian seasoning (didn't have garlic herb seasoning), used thin spagetti, and used only one can of diced tomatoes (would have been better with two, didn't have).  I also seasoned to taste with salt and pepper.  It's lighter than your normal pasta with sauce, and surprisingly flavorful with the little amount of seasoning.  Next time I will toss in some fresh garlic and maybe even substitute canned mushrooms and tomatoes with fresh.  As is, it is very tasty and quick when your in a crunch.  I served with bruschetta and green salad. Thanks for sharing Tiffany.

I've done a bunch of recipes from allrecipes over several years, this one is hands down the best.  My wife said it was like a pro dish from Macaroni's Grill.  The only thing I did different was adding a bit of onion powder to the chicken, and then adding a 4 oz of tomato sauce to the chicken mixture as it simmered.  Thanks for a great dish, Tiffany!

This is a good recipe but it definitely needs more flavor and more tomatoes! Added an extra can of tomatoes and some garlic and Italian seasoning DELICIOUS!

You can't give this recipe less than 5 stars! I can't believe it turned out this good. I changed the quantities a bit just based on what I needed and  added oregano, wine and garlic. I did not even need the parmesan. This one is a keeper.

Yum!! This really IS quick and easy, and a fun recipe to modify to your liking. For starters, have fun with the seasoning--I added garlic and just seasoned the chicken with salt & pepper. Next time I'm going to omit the canned mushrooms and use shrimp. This recipe is forgiving with substitutions, and it's nice to have a hearty, home-cooked meal ready in no time on a busy weeknight.

Really tasty and really easy.  Surprisingly good!  This is a good recipe to keep handy since you don't need any fresh ingredients - just freeze the chicken and keep the rest of the cans in the pantry.

This is a great addition to my family's dinner menu.  It is easy enough for me to fix after work, light and husband and both kids like it.  I do use fresh mushrooms.

My family loves this, I didn't change it to much, but instead of angel hair pasta I usually use the pene or the minestrone noodles...and to make a thicker sauce i use a small can of tomato sauce and a can of tomato paste, I season the chicken when its browning but I also season it after I have everything in it, the Italian seasons work nice with it

My husband cooked this recipe so that shows how easy it really is.  Tasted beautiful but maybe could have done with a few more tomatoes.

I used one package of angel hair pasta, with a 10oz can of chicken, bell peppers, and 1 jar of your favorite pasta sauce.  Very easy to make and very cheap!

I tweaked this a little I had only one can of diced tomato so I added  Barilla marinara sauce. I also used Wheat Penne pasta. We loved it! This would be good as a Seafood pasta as well...just replace the chicken with shrimp, Clams, and/or scallops

A very fresh tasting pasta, great for summer! I added fresh zucchini, fresh mushrooms, fresh garlic, fresh shredded basil and parsley, plus chopped red pepper and carrots. Draining the tomatoes as another reviewer suggested would be helpful, but altogether a very delicious and simple meal.

I was looking for a quick recipe to make with the ingredients I had on hand and this was excellent!!  It was very fast and forgiving of any substitutions you make.  I'd definitely recommend the fresh mushrooms, very tasty!  I also used Rotelle pasta instead of spaghetti, just because it is easier for my 3 yr old to eat!!  Everyone loved this dish!!

I don't boil angel hair pasta for 8-10 minutes-- 4 minutes max! It is pretty bland unless you do some extras to liven it up...peppers/onions/fresh garlic/fennel/pepper flakes.

Tasty, hearty, and easy! I made a vegan version with seitan instead of chicken. Could barely tell the difference. I also added a splash of wine and some more tomatoes as per others' suggestions.

I made this today for dinner and it turned out great for my taste. I skip the black olives and used fresh mushrooms and tomatoes. I also used a can of cream of chicken and mushroom and a little bit of white wine and butter. I seasoned the chicken with oregano, garlic powder and seasoned salt and sautéd it with fresh garlic. Sprinkled it with fresh chopped parsley.Very easy to make. My daughter loved it.

As written, this is a bit bland and boring. A few tweaks make all the difference. First, you will get the most flavor by using real garlic (I used three cloves and minced them) and real mushrooms. I also used basil as the herb for this dish which is a must. Additionally, I sliced up an onion and browned it along with the chicken, garlic and mushrooms in a little bit of olive oil. The black olives are optional in this dish. I love them, but my family doesn't so I left them out. Once I made these changes, this dish, still simple and quick, was quite tasty and a family favorite. Also please note that you can use any pasta your family enjoys. I love angel hair pasta, but my hubby loves a heartier pasta, so I often make this with penne. Just go with what you and your family enjoy!

I'll try again and add my favorite ingredients. It would be easy to turn this into a hot and spicy dish or really flavorful. Oregano, basil, and parsley are some spices that would go well with this.

Super easy - turned out great. Makes a LOT ... it's just me & my husband, so I'm going to freeze half for later. Followed recipe pretty closely, but added 2 small cans of tomato sauce, chopped garlic, and a 16-oz package of rotini pasta instead of angel hair. Will definitely make again.

Had no plan for dinner but happened to have these ingredients! Only had jalapeño diced tomatoes, and it added a nice kick. Added garlic and more seasoning and Walla!

I didn't have mushrooms. I added an onion, basil, oregano and thyme. I ran out of pepper so use tabasco sauce. It was really flavorful and spicy.

I wasn't sure I'd like this and based on the basic recipe I'd probably give it a 4 star but I made some changes.  Not a lot and not really significant but here's what I did.  I added 1/2 chopped onion to the chicken/olive/mushroom saute.  I used 3 cloves of garlic put through the garlic press.  I didn't have the garlic herb blend seasoning so I used some Italian seasoning and threw in a bay leaf.  Lastly, I added about 1/2 C white wine to the saute when I added the tomatoes.  Served it with Linguini and lots of shredded Parmesan cheese.  We loved it.

I made the recipe as directed and although it was fast, it was not very tasty, sort of bland, sorry, but will not be making this again.

This was O.K. but a good base to begin with. Thought the seasonings were lacking. Didn't add the broccoli.

It was ok.  The brocoli did lose its pretty color, it shouldn't be added until clser to the end.  I will probably not make this again.
