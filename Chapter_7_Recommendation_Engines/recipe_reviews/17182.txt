I made this twice for family events.  Everyone liked it both times but being from Texas, everyone said it needed to be spicier the first time so here's what I did.  I switched the regular corn to Mexi corn (has red and green bell peppers in it).  I used the hot green chili peppers instead of the mild.  I added a teaspoon of cumin to the ranch salad dressing.  We all liked it even better the second time (with the extra spice).  
Next time I make it I'm going to use pico de gallo (chunky salsa) instead of just straight tomatoes.

EXCELLENT! Serves 12 easily.  I prefer making the ranch dressing from the package as the dressing is very important to the salad.  I used 1 package Ranch dressing, 1 cup mayo and 1 cup sour cream. Also added a bit of cumin,oregano and chili powder. Try different cheeses...Monteray Jack and mild cheddar are nice.  I prefer making this the day before as all the flavors blend. You'll get raves from this easy, colorful and scrumptious
salad.  A big winner in my book!!!!!

Great recipe!  Very different.  It tastes better if you make it a day ahead.  Also, the recipe says it's for 6 servings but it's more like for 12-15. Unless you are feeding a big crowd, I would cut this back by at least half.

I found a similar recipe to this in Southern Living magazine last summer.  I added teh chiles TO the corn bread mix along w/ a little taco seasoning to make a mexican corn bread.  I also used 1 can black beans instead of pinto, layered w/ romaine lettuce, real bacon instead of the bits and use Montery Jack cheese instead of plain cheddar.

Overall this is a great salad that you can adjust to your own liking!  It does make a huge bowl, so make sure you've got plenty to eat it!!!

Gosh...What can I say about a recipe that has had everyone that I have EVER served it too flippin' out? Not enough, apparently. This salad is FANTASTIC and I have made it over 6 times for different occasions.  I HIGHLY reccommend that you try this and have some fun with it. Some substitutions I have made are using differnet Ranch dressings  (a spicy Texas ranch was a HUGE hit) plus I've changed the beans from pinto to black beans, I've changed the cheese. It's very flexible, so have fun! Really, though...it's FABULOUS! make it, make it, make it!!! Oh yeah, also I make/serve it on a really big colorful platter, and garnish it with a red or green jalapeno pepper.ENJOY!!!

This was a hit at our Labor Day BBQ. I added layers of sliced black olives and used the Sour Cream Dressing recipe on this site in place of the bottled dressing. It looks beautiful and festive in a trifle bowl and is definitely not your ordinary salad. Awesome recipe, Jose! Thx.

This was a hit at a recent get-together!  I used Kraft Cilantro Pepper flavored Ranch dressing that I think made it even better.  The bacon bits aren't really necessary for this dish to work!  Try this recipe...it's easy and delicious!

I have taken this to several potlucks and it is always a hit.  I agree that it makes a bunch, so I just make half the recipe for small gatherings (15 people or less) and I just use a box of Jiffy cornbread.  To make it quick, I use canned, diced tomatoes w/ roasted garlic.

It's a great salad to make ahead! It holds well for several days in the refrigerator. Also, a great way to use up any leftover cornbread!

Loved it!  I only wish that I would have used cornbread mix that didn't have sugar in it.  Sweet cornbread just didn't go well.  I added a Mexican flavor to the corn by stirring in 1 tsp. cumin, 1/2 tsp. chili powder, and 1/4 tsp. ground oregano before adding to the layers.  Loved the flavor!  Now for the dressing - it calls for 1 - 8 oz. bottle.  8 oz. = 1 cup, so when the recipe says to add 1 cup dressing, there isn't any leftover for the second layer!  Be sure and buy 2 - 8 oz. bottles (or 1 - 16 oz. bottle).  I agree with the other reviewers to be sure and add lots of dressing, or it will be too dry.  Thanks for the recipe!

I just made this for the 4th holiday and it was fantastic! I too was hesitant due to the combination of ingredients, but I felt adventuresome. And it paid off! I cut the recipe in half since there's only two of us, and there's still plenty leftover. (Which we will certainly enjoy today!) I used black beans instead of pinto. I also used the little grape tomatoes, red and green pepper, and sharp cheddar cheese. I will definetly make this the next time I need to take a dish somewhere. A++++++

This was a bit of work and was not all that popular with my co-workers at our summer potluck.  It was very pretty to look at it, and one or two enjoyed it, but it made a lot and I threw almost half of it away.  I will not make again.

Very good, but mine was a little dry.  Next time, I am going to add a little mayonnaise to the ranch dressing and put it on top of the crumbled cornbread before I add the other ingredients.

Who would of thought that these ingredients mixed together would be so good, and looks pretty as well!  I halfed the recipe, but used all the cornbread.  I also added a little milk to the dressing to make it easier to spread.

I have made this twice.  It has gone over well each time.  I cut the peppers, onions & tomatoes the day before.  I also open all the canned veggies, drain & refrigerate to facilitate assemblying the following day.  I have added 1/8 teaspoon each of ground cumin & dry oregano to the cornbread before baking.

This recipe is easy, quick, attractive and delicious!  I would have to say that, unless you like leftovers (which WERE equally good), this serves about 12 rather than 6.  I will certainly make this again, but probably only half a recipe.

This was an excellent summer salad.  Adults and kids both gobbled down second servings of this.  Makes enough servings for a family to enjoy for several days or to bring to a potluck.

I gave this recipe 4 stars because I think that the original would be a tad too bland.  I made some improvements per others' suggestions, and I was very pleased!  I added a jalapeno to the cornbread, used spicy ranch dressing, and substituted a taco cheese blend for regular cheddar.  Even after these changes plus adding some cumin and chile powder between the layers, I found it could be a little spicier.  I will definitely make this again, but I will be more generous with my spices.  Everyone raved about this at a friend's dinner, and the hostess told me this recipe was a keeper!

Huge Hit!Served a party of 15-20 easily. I did make a few changes after reading reviews: used Salsa instead of tomatos. For the dressing I did One packet Ranch mix, 1 cup mayo, 1 cup sour cream with the added spices as listed in other reviews and added 1/2 tbsp taco seasoning to the dressing and corn bread. I did make it in a huge bowl but next time I will use a glass bowl to show off the colorful layers! 5 stars all the way!!!

Good tasting. Makes many more that 6 servings. I was considerering doubling the recipe as I was expecting many people, but glad I didn't. It made a huge bowl that yielded at least 15 servings.

I usually make this to take to cookouts.  It has been a big hit everytime.  I always get asked for the recipe.  I use a 16 oz. bottle of Ranch Dressing instead of 8 oz.

This recipe creates a beautiful and delicious salad.  The only thing that I will do differently next time, is add more ranch dressing.  Good recipe.

Everyone is impressed when they see the various colorful layers and even more so when they taste it.  Carry the recipe with you at potlucks, everyone will want it.  Spice it up with a fresh (or commercial) salsa layered with or instead of tomatoes!

This is really different, we liked it very much and I will make it again. It is a very forgiving recipe, add more of this or less of that and it will be fine. I like those recipes! I would recommend that you use a good ranch dressing though because that is important.

I switched the ranch dressing for a salsa vinagrette (make your own with salsa, red wine vinager, honey.)
I also liked switching black beans in for pinto beans.
What a hit! This is a nice change from typical summer salads with pasta.

This is a delicious, flexible, yummy recipe!  I used a Jiffy corn bread mix with about 3/4 of a 7 oz can of diced green chilies and an additional 1/2 tsp cumin.  I used black beans and real bacon.  My dressing was Marie's Creamy Ranch Dressing, and the corn was Trader Joe's fire roasted frozen corn.  A half a batch was perfect for eight people with lots of other food available, and we all had a little leftover for tomorrow.  This is exactly the type of recipe I love because it lends itself so well to variations of all sorts.  It was very yummy, and I recommend it without reservations!

Crazy yummy!!  I used Marie's Chipolte Ranch dressing and used cubanel peppers instead of bell peppers.  It makes a  beautiful presentation, too.

This is amazing!! I made modifications but still give it 5 stars. I used spicy ranch drsg, hearts of romaine (I don't like green pepper), omitted bacon bits and used 1/2 purple onion instead of green onion. I actually made 2 batches.. just one layer of each of everything in a 9x13 pan. One with black beans and dusted it with cumin, garlic powder and chili powder halfway through layering. The other was with pinto beans and I also spread it with my homemade salsa. Took them both to work and they demolished the whole pan with the salsa in it and half of the other! The next shift took care of the other half. Have had numerous requests for the recipe after just making it once. Thank you for this awesome recipe!!

This is one of my standby summer recipes.  It always gets rave reviews.  Don't be fooled by the number of servings though - this will feed a crowd.  The only alteration I would suggest is instead of 2 cans of pinto beans, I use 1 can of pinto and 1 can of black beans - I mix all the beans together during rinsing.

I had leftover cornbread from Easter, so this was perfect! I did use the advice given by other users and double my ranch dressing. I added the cumin , a little salt/pepper,garlic powder and about 1/4 cup of milk to make the consistency easier to moisten the cornbread. I had leftover chicken so I put it in my dicer and added a layer of this before the bacon.
We love lettuce so I did chop some and put in under the corn layer. It was ***** stars all the way!
My better half tried it (not to his will) and absolutely loved it!

This was a good recipe, a nice change from the usual summer salads.  I had to use a lot more salad dressing than recommended, and it was still a bit dry.  This makes a huge bowl; I had 12 people over for lunch, everyone enjoyed it, but I still had leftovers.

We tried this for my son's "Mexican Fiesta" birthday party and it was a big hit!  Even with 20 people, there were still leftovers, though.  Maybe I'll cut it in half next time -- but there WILL be a next time!

Very disappointed. This looks so pretty. Served it at a birthday party. Out of 10 adults only 1 said it was just okay.I guess it depends on personal taste.

Our family loved it! Great meal on 100 degree days! I used jalepeno ranch dressing and chunky salsa (medium hotness). I make my own cornbread so did not use the package. The cornbread can be made evening before, and throw salad together the next morning. Saved me time! Next time I will use shredded cold chicken instead of the bacon. Like the flexibility of adding avocado, jalepenos, or sour cream if individuals want to their own plates, but we thought it was filling enough without it. Made enough for left-overs the next night. Thanks for sharing! This is going in my favorite recipe box and I have shared with two people so far.

This is an awesome recipe for family BBQ's, picnics or backyard parties.  I have only made it once for a party and at least 10 people asked me for the recipe.  I added taco seasoning and fresh jalapenos to the corn bread, added cumin and oregano to the corn and subbed red pepper for the green.  I followed the recipe and it made a LOT of salad. Perfect for a party.

This is very good. Only changes i made was to use real cooked bacon instead of the bits and used 3 green onions.  The corn adds just the right touch of sweet with the other vegetables. This does make a huge salad. If it's not for a large gathering i would highly recommend halving it.

this salad was SO good! i accidentally left out the green onions and bacon bits, but it still tasted wonderful! i might use some black beans next time too. i think they would add a fun flavor to it. a few of my friends read the recipe and were skeptical, but they loved the salad after they tasted it. i cant wait to make it again!

I made my own cornbread from a recipe on here (which ended up being way to bread-like but mixed with everything in the salad wasn't too bad). I would definitely NOT use so much Ranch dressing next time. I'd cut it down to a third of the amount listed. It was just WAY too much and overpowering. I was surprised that even the next day the cornbread wasn't soggy. That was a nice surprise. Also, this makes A LOT.

I was sick of bringing the same old side dishes to pot lucks.  This was the perfect cure.  It was delicious!  Many of those who tried it loved it.  Lots of people were hesitant, because they just didn't know what it was.  It does make A LOT.  I brought it to a pot luck BBQ with over 20 people and half of the recipe would have sufficed.

When I came across this recipe and saw the ingredients list, then saw the outstanding reviews, I couldn't understand what could be so good about this dish. I also knew that I needed to try it, since I had everything I needed to make it in my pantry. Well, it's FANTASTIC! Such a nice mix of flavors and textures. The only thing I left out was the bacon, and I subbed diced red bell pepper for the green. It really is a 5-star recipe, and one that I'll make again and again.

I brought this to a potluck and everyone raved about it!  I altered the recipe slightly, using black beans instead of pinto, Hidden Valley spicy ranch dressing, "mexican blend" shredded cheese, and real bacon in my recipe.  It was easy to make, looked beautiful and tasted fantastic.  I will definitely make it again!

This was really delish. I did use taco seasoning in the cornbread and I also used 1/2 c. pepper jack cheese and 1 c. mexican cheese blend. Also, after the tomato layer I put a layer of picante sauce and a layer of a mexican cilli sauce. Without it I think it wouldn't have been nearly as good, but it turned out wonderfully.

I made this for a birthday party and everyone raved about it. It was so good! I substituted sliced black olives instead of the bacon bits because I don't care for bacon. Everyone asked for the recipe for this delicious salad and I was happy to share it.

This is a really good recipe.  The variety of ingredients makes it interesting and unique.  I made my own cornbread - personal preference.  I also used black beans instead of pinto beans - another personal preference. I believe those changes were positive for our tastes. In my opinion this is a very versatile recipe.  For those who want more of a spicy Mexican taste (including me) that is easy to accomplish.  You could mix in Salsa of any kind and/or seasonings of your choice to the bean layer, for example.  You can add much more spice to the cornbread.  You can use corn with peppers and you could mix Ro-tel in with the tomato layer.  Of course, you could use a chipotle or other spicy dressing in place of the ranch or even substitute salsa. in the future, I'll try a variety of those to determine what we might like best.  As is, though, the recipe is good - and probably sufficiently spicy if you have sensitive eaters or simply are serving to people who might not care for 'spice'.  It tastes better the 2nd day after the flavors blend, and the corn bread holds its own against the moisture of the other ingredients.  After you make the cornbread, the rest of it goes together in a flash.  A solid recipe - thanks for sharing it!

This was delicious!! To make this a little lighter,  I made my own dressing w/the ranch packet,  greek yogurt and 1% milk. I cut the cheese down to just sprinkling it on top and didn't use the bacon.  I did use the corn with the red and green pepper in it too.  It was so moist and full of flavor! A definite keeper...

Great recipe, never fails to impress.  I make my own cornbread and use bottled Kraft Peppercorn Ranch dresing, sometimes shredded chicken instead of bacon.  Easily becomes no meat version for vegetarians and if you check for a cornbread recipe with corn meal only...it is a great salad for celiacs or those who prefer a diet that is gluten free.

I hosted a dinner party of 9 and made a big pot of tortilla soup for the main course.  I thought this salad would go nicely with it because of the title "Mexican".  It was tasty but I was disappointed that it did not even remotely taste Mexican. I could not even taste the green chiles that were baked in the cornbread. I upped the green onions to 4 and used 1 can of black beans instead of pinto.  If I make it again I will spice up the ranch dressing with chile powder and perhaps use a chunky salsa in place of the tomatoes.  Might even sub taco meat for the bacon. With these changes this salad would live up to it's name. Made as is it's just Cornbread Salad IMO.

This was good.  Instead of the ranch dressing, I used a ranch salsa mix, and only sprinkled some of it on it, and served the rest on the side.  I also used fresh corn on the cob.  It was very good.

Made this over the weekend.  It was a big hit.  Because I was serving it as an appetizer and the main dish was chili, I did substitute the kidney beans for black beans.  I also used real bacon.  Other than that, I kept everything the same and it was fantastic.  Everyone loved it!

Everyone loved this salad- even my husband who is never a fan of things like this. I made the mistake of blending it all together right before we served it. It probably would have "Looked" better had I left it in the layers in the bowl. But it was still very yummy! I used the Spicy Ranch and added Cilantro, too.

Served for a luncheon and everyone absolutely loved it and asked for the recipe.  Used black beans instead of pinto and 16 oz. bottle of ranch dressing.  Be aware that this is WAY more than 6 servings--fills a very large party bowl and can easily serve 12-15, if not more.  I would also try and make the cornbread a bit more moist next time, maybe by adding some creamed corn and/or extra milk when baking.

I took this salad to a Fourth of July cookout. Everyone loved it! Passed out the recipe as soon as I could get it written down! I did make 2 easy, but delicious changes, as suggested previously: black beans instead of pinto, and a 16oz. bottle of Spicey Ranch dressing. Just the kick it needed!!

This was different and we enjoyed it.  I will make again but not something I would make often.  I do believe real bacon crumbled is the best way to go but of course we love bacon.

A keeper! Everyone was skeptical when I told them we were having cornbread salad but now they all want the recipe. I only omitted green chilies because not everyone likes them. I'm gluten free so I used Krusteaz box gluten free honey cornbread and it was great. I can see options to make variations of this recipe but definitely a hit as it is

I felt this recipe was good, but it was a little bland. If I made it again I would add some hot sauce and some seasonings to the ranch. I also felt it could use more crunch. Perhaps use a regular onion instead of a green onion and throw some tortilla chips in the layers.

Made this for the first time last weekend, for a fundraiser at our local community center.  It was a big hit.  Brought some home to snack on the next day, and let the Hubby try it. And he loved it.  Making a bowl up for us to have this weekend.  It's awesome.  The only thing I did different was make my ranch from scratch.

this is a very tasty recipe, there is an error in the amounts though, just want to clarify it for others: you need a 16oz bottle of ranch dressing, as according to the recipe you need 2 cups of dressing. Definitely add the cumin, and I added sliced olives as a layer too.

Delicious!  I will make this time and again!  As others have said, this makes way more than 6 servings and I only made one layer of each ingrediant!  The only thing I would change is instead of tomatoes, I might try salsa to add a little more kick.  Otherwise perfect!

I would have given this recipe 5 stars but, we  do not care for ranch dressing.  Instead, I used my version of  a mexican dressing (this is great on taco salad).  One third each of water, EEVO, & apple cider vinegar, along w/one packet of taco seasoning.

Great salad!  Makes a beautiful presentation layered in a clear glass bowl.  Would be a wonderful salad for potluck event.   Will keep this recipe handy.  I cut down on the corn and beans.  Used only one can of each and had plenty.  I used regular ranch for the dressing but might try a chipotle ranch next for more of a tex-mex spin.

Interesting twist for a new salad - took to a staff meeting and we ate the whole 9x13 pan.  Made as directed.

When I found this recipe I didn't even think twice about making it.  I knew I would love it.  I love everything in it, it was rated well, so why wouldn't I like it, right?  Well, I didn't.  It was just weird for me.  I even tasted it the next day since it has been said that it tastes better the next day.  Nope.  It sounds weird, but it had a mustard like taste after sitting overnight.  I made it for a group and did get compliments.  One guy loved it so much that I gave most of it to take home.  Needless to say, I was very disappointed after having such high hopes for the recipe.

First, let me just say that I never thought of anything so simple as adding a can of diced chilies to cornbread mixture - I'll be doing that from now on!  Yum!  We found this recipe to be OK.  I subbed black beans for the pintos and used a can of diced tomatoes with chilies since I was pressed for time.  Hubby liked everything BUT the cornbread part, I liked the cornbread part the best.  (?)  Hopefully we'll find a way to customize this so it pleases both of us.  I was happy that I could make this the night before and it didn't get terribly soggy.  I am still eating it for lunch the rest of this week.  We're going to keep tinkering with this one...

I ate all of it (work lunches mostly), but won't make it again. If I'd made my own cornbread and fried my own bacon for bacon bits, maybe I would've liked it, but, as is, found it disappointing. Didn't use bottled dressing, as I'm sure that would've made it ever worse. Sorry...

This salad is amazing!  I make it when we have a BBQ, but it's good summer or winter.  The only thing I do to add more flavor is to use jalapeos in place of green chilies and add 1/4 cup of salsa to the Ranch Dressing.  It is sooo good.  You can change it up any way you want.  It's very versatile.

I’ve made this twice so far.  The first time I followed 100% and was very good. The second time I decided to make a few changes.  I fried up a pound of bacon instead of using bacon bits.  I used black beans instead of pinto and used BOTH ranch dressing and ranch season packet with 1.5 cups of sour cream to make the dressing.  With the little changes it went from very good to GREAT!!

I read all of the reviews and couldn't wait to try it.  I had a small dinner party and served this dish.  Everyone liked it.  I did add a layer of romaine lettuce and substituted salsa for the tomatoes.  I will definitely make this again!  I will however, not add the romaine.  It gets soggy and doesn't add anything to the dish after the first serving.

I made this with leftover cornbread and used ingredients I had on hand.  I decreased the calories by using Hidden Valley yogurt ranch dressing, canned mexican style diced tomatoes, drained, soy bacon bits made it vegetarian and low in fat, and frozen, thawed whole corn. It was fantastic.  The only drawback was it needed to be a bit spicier.  Next time I will add some chili powder to the dressing.  Great recipe.

I could eat the whole batch myself. It's that good. It's been a while since I've made it, but I think I double the amount of corn bread that is listed. I also used a bacon ranch dressing. Deeee-lish!

I halved the recipe and used homemade ranch dressing and real bacon (bacon bits eww).  I think overall the salad was good but needed something, maybe taco seasoning mixed into the dressing.  I was hesitant about it because I'm not a mushy bread fan but the texture of the cornbread didn't bother me.  I'll probably make it again.

Very good. Makes ALOT! Would be perfect for a large gathering. Only things I did different was to use black beans(like them better) used a spicy ranch dressing,  salsa in place of tomatoes and omitted bacon bits (did not have any). Would make again!

Amazing!  I put this in a trifle dish, big hit NO left overs and I've had requests for the recipe!  Only thing I did differently was instead of using bacon bits I just used bacon ranch dressing.  I don't think I used as much dressing either.  I will be making this again for a pot luck this weekend.

I dig on this salad!! It's one of my favorites!! I add jalapeños to the corn bread and I don't always have the right ingredients. That's what rocks about this one. Layer with what's in the fridge or pantry and have a blast with it!! Love it Jose!! Thanks for the great idea and a tasty salad!!

I made this for a recent neighborhood get together.  When I first tried it I wasn't all that crazy about it but the leftovers (2-3 days later) are so so good. I used black beans, salsa instead of tomatoes, mexicorn and a spicy ranch dressing.  I didn't use the entire bottle as I think that would have made it too soggy. My vegetarian daughter (I didn't use any bacon) went crazy over it as did my granddaughter. It makes a TON so unless you're feeding a crowd or will eat the leftovers (I highly recommend that), you'll need to only make 1/2 the recipe.

I cooked up some crispt bacon instead of using bacon bits and it was fantastic.  This is the third recipe for Cornbreat Salad that I've made and it is now THE recipe that I will use.  Thank you!

This was a fun dish to take to a potluck. It looked awesome layered in my trifle bowl! I cubed my cornbread rather than crumbling. It made for nice presentation. I used a homemade ranch dressing that was yogurt based to save on calories and fat. Next time, I'll use more dressing. It needed a bit more than 16 oz.

Delicious - a great way to use leftover cornbread!
