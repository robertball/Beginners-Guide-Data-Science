I made these cookies first using coconut oil in place of butter; next following recipe exactly, using butter.  They are both good.  But if you are looking for a shortbread type cookie don't change a thing!  They are quick, easy and hit the spot when you are craving something crispy and sweet without much guilt!  (The cookie with the coconut oil is actually slightly higher in calories.  Another reason not to change a thing!!)

Wow! Didn't crumble and fall apart like a lot of gluten free baking does. Very subtle flavor but I really liked these cookies. I used vanilla instead of coconut flavoring. Can't wait to try them with the coconut flavoring or a little lemon zest. Also used raw sugar instead of refined. And I used a small melon scooper to drop, which worked great. Will definitely make again. And will double the recipe. This recipe only makes about 12 small cookies. They were good enough to want more.

I made these following the recipe exactly. I used Sprouts brand organic coconut flour and Bob's Red Mill all purpose flour (made with garbanzo and fava flours). They came out quite tasty, and not as sweet as expected. They could use a little vanilla extract or almond extract for a bit more flavor.

I made another batch with the same coconut flour and Bob's Redmill All Purpose Baking Flour (blue and white bag). I added 1 1/2 Tsp of cocoa powder and used 1/4 cup of lightly packed dark brown sugar. I may have also used a bit more than 1/4 cup of butter since I estimated and didn't measure exactly. I also added a tiny bit of fresh orange zest to the tops of each cookie before baking. The dough was delicious so I imagine the finished product will be quite tasty. Because of my oven, I have had to bake them 12-15 minutes.

Just tried the chocolate cookies and they are better than the plain ones. Definitely an improvement to use brown sugar, cocoa powder and orange zest.

Very tasty! I added a dash of vanilla, and I used coconut sugar instead of regular sugar. Delicious, easy and gluten free!

I wasn't sure how these would turn out.  Pulling a all-nighter doing class work and the infamous sweet tooth kicked in. I used almond flour in place of gluten-free flour.  I put a tbsp of unsweetened cocoa powder and unsweetened vanilla almond milk.  I added pecan pieces and unsweetened coconut. I used pure stevia in place of sugar.  Meant to add some chia seeds but I forgot. Will make it a point to add them next round.  These are delish!!  They didn't fall apart like a lot of gluten-free cookies. So glad I found this easy recipe!

Followed directions with the exception of using almond flour instead of gluten-free flour. Pressed half the cookies with a fork and made thumbprint cookies with blueberry jam with the other half. I also added the additional coconut extract. These cookies were yummy!  Light and crumbly. The coconut flavor overpowered the blueberry preserves but I was craving coconut anyway. The preserves would definitely stand out without the addition of extract though. Will make again!

Making these cookies was simple and fast!  I didn‘t have coconut flavor, so I used almond flavor.  Delicious!

This recipe is definitely a keeper.   Like several other cooks, I added vanilla rather than coconut extract (1/2 tsp), substituted coconut sugar for the white sugar,  and used coconut oil rather than butter.  I also sprinkled the tops with a little extra sea salt which was delicious.

The texture is perfect.  Make sure you really get the cookies about 1/4 thick--if you try to bake them like round drop cookies, then it won't work.  I cooked mine on convection 375 degrees for 9 minutes and they came out great.

Super easy and quick.  I made it with coconut flour and regular flour and it was great.  I also added a little vanilla extract.  My 3 year-old and I did it together.  This will definitely become a regular recipe for me.

Great taste. I substituted the butter for organic vegetable shortening, which did make them thinner and flatter, with a nice crispy edge. Next time I’ll use the earth balance ‘butter’ instead.

Our church has members who have celiac disease.  When we have coffee hour after services, it's rare for a homemade gluten-free treat to be served.  Determined to remedy this, I went to AllRecipes, which is my favorite place to find new ideas.  This recipe was super easy and delicious too!  I didn't do the optional added coconut flavor but the cookies had a nice subtle taste of coconut from the flour.  Coffee hour was a hit with the cookies and I expect to try more experimentation with gluten-free baking.

I used regular flour instead of gluten free. They are perfect and taste like macaroons. Double the recipe. This only makes 6 cookies.

Loved this recipe! I liked it so much I made a second batch right away. Super fast and easy. I used almond flour and coconut flour. Also added vanilla extract. Not a very sweet cookie but very tasty.

Will definitely make these again. I doubled the recipe, and I used vanilla for flavoring as I didn’t have coconut oil. There is still a very subtle coconut flavor. Also used regular flour instead of gluten free, as I didn’t have that either. I used a scoop to drop the dough and didn’t flatten. 
These are really good

Pretty good for gluten free, just be sure not to over cook them. I read the reviews about them not being very sweet so I added coconut and chocolate chips, and used coconut sugar and vanilla. Next time I'll add nuts or flaxseed.

Yummy cookies.  Mine weren't crisp though.  Any suggestions?  I will make them again.
