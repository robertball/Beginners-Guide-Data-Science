I followed the directions but baked my dough in a bread pan. It was great having it as sliced bread, I've made it twice, it's my go to bread recipe now.

Great recipe! To make this recipe vegan I used an avocado/coconut oil blend instead of butter and a flax egg in the dough. I brushed oil over the top and garnished with chia seeds. Instead of 16 hand rolls I made 8 sandwich size rolls for vegan cheesesteaks. Thank you so much!!

I had to substitute some ingridients because I am vegan, so 
instead  cow milk I  used almond milk;  eggs I used flaxseed; butter I used coconut oil; honey I used Agave.
If  the  vegan recipe got so delicious  I can imagine  those buns made with the traditionsl recipe. 
I think you should  to try. :)

Doubled the recipe and did everything in the recipe except that I added about 2 cups of wholewheat bread flour instead of using 100% white flour . Turned out to be soft and moist.

This is my first time making bread! The video was easy to follow. I actually made 1 whole loaf instead of buns and baked it for about 35 minutes, and it worked perfectly considering it was my first try. I only used 3 cups of flour and even had to add more water, though. Loved this recipe and will be making it again :)

I followed the instructions exactly and did not change a thing. The video was extremely helpful, they turned out beautiful! With my dough, it only needed about 2 and 3/4 cups flour to reach the desired consistency. Also, they baked for about 10-11 minutes and they were done. The only reason I'm giving this a 4 star is because I felt it needed more sweetness (maybe my potatoes weren't sweet enough) so I'll be adding more sugar or honey next time.

Excellent, I was very impressed with how well they turned out and tasted.  The video on how to need the buns into balls was very helpful as well.

Used leftover sweet potato chunks which had been roasted with fresh rosemary and olive oil.  Reduced the amount of butter (because of the oil) and I did not have a mixer with a dough attachment so I blended everything with a wooden spoon until it became the consistency I could knead it by hand.  The rolls turned out great and I received lots of compliments on them.

Excellent!! Instead of cutting rectangles and shaping the dough, I used an empty 28oz can to cut perfect circles!

These buns bake up to a beautiful color inside and out, are soft and fluffy, exquisite taste, and were the perfect choice for some Asian Turkey Burgers.  I did flatten each bun as I placed it on the baking sheet, but next time I will flatten a bit more, as they had more of a dome than I would have liked.  Beautiful dough, easy to work with, and definitely worth the effort to make.

Great recipe & especially the demo video. Bread can be tricky, but you make it look easy with good explanations of how to work the dough & adding flour correctly.. Thanks Chef John!

Easy to follow the recipe. I cut the rectangle into 5 pieces for mini loaves and swapped out everything bagel seasoning for the sesame seeds. So delicious!  These will be a favorite in our house. I'll have to swap some gluten-free flour in a batch for my step-father, a Celiac's guy.

I made it with potatoes instead of sweet potatoes as that was what I had. They turned out great! Lovely crust, moist and airy inside, even after freezing. Next time I will add a little more salt and honey or sugar to the mixture as they were a bit bland for me.
I gave it 4 stars as they were not ideal as burger buns - not soft enough and the sizing needs adjustment, as I got 15 smallish buns out of this recipe.

Came out perfectly.  I over-rose the dough - twice - and guests still raved.  made with leftover mashed sweet potatoes from Thanksgiving dinner.

I eat predominantly gluten free. I made these buns using gluten free flour and they came out great. I changed nothing other than the flour. Will make them again.

These are amazing. Perfect texture and flavor. I made 12 buns medium sized. I used half whole wheat flour and it was great. We ate them with bbq chicken and mango coleslaw
