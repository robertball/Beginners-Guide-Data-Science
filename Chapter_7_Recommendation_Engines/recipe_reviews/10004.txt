Though Pavlova is not meant to be individual sizes, my son (he's a chef) used this recipe at Thanksgiving and made individual sizes with whipped cream, fresh blueberries, blackberries and raspberries and a dash of raspberry sauce drizzled on top (wish I had a picture to share).  Huge hit and so light after such a big meal.  By the way, New Zealand is the real originator of this dessert, no matter what the other countries claim! : )

This is delicious! I did have to try 3 times to make it work.  I finally figured out what I was doing wrong.  First make sure to let the eggs come to room temp. after separating the yolks.  Second do not use a plastic mixing bowl, the plastic is oily and it causes issues with the eggs. Thanks for the great recipe!

Our pavlova needed to quickly replace a Christmas day pavlova that was accidentally destroyed. We hopped online to find directions that used only ingredients we had around the house. This one fit the bill.
Our first attempt at the humble pavlova (a New Zealand tradition), it turned out really well and was delicious. 
With helpful suggestions from friends, the key to the pavlova is adding the sugar in bit by bit, not disturbing it once it is in the oven and of course decorating it later with fresh whipped cream, strawberries and kiwifruit.
Thanks for saving Christmas!

I'm not sure if I made this dessert correctly, but never having it before I found it delicious and fascinating. I was a little scared of the multiple textures at first, but was able to salvage a good half of my creation to serve. I made it without super fine sugar because I didn't have any, which may have contributed to it being ultra-sweet. I'd love to try this made by someone who does it all the time.

I thought the meringue would be crispy but it had the texture of a marshmallow on the inside. I followed directions exactly. It cracked around th edges and didnt look so nice, but the guests liked it.
To make superfine sugar - put regular white sugar in your food processor or blender for 1 - 2 minutes.

As a kiwi-phile just back from New Zealand I would say that this recipe is excellent. You can grind normal white sugar in a coffee grinder, set at espresso (fine) to produce the fine castor sugar for the recipe. I make mine in a pie plate covered in parchment paper. The consistency is somewhere between angel food cake and cotton candy. I use fat free cool whip on top with fruit. A beautiful dessert!

I used an extra egg white and did not add the water.  To add to the directions:  separate eggs carefully and let whites sit about 1/2 hour to come to room temp.  Beat them until foamy soft peaks appear, then very very slowly add the sugar.  Use superfine sugar, or put regular sugar in food processor first.  I like 1/4 cup sugar per egg white.  You can lower oven temp to 250 and bake an hour, then turn off oven and let it sit until you're ready for it.  The parchment paper just peeled right off.  The center will probably fall...it's OK.  Cover with whipped cream.  I don't put sugar in the cream, just vanilla.  The meringue is sweet enough.  Also don't care for canned whipped cream or whipped toppings on this:  too sweet.  It is easier to eat if the fruit is cut up into bite sized pieces.  You can whip the cream in advance and refrigerate.  Just assemble quickly before serving.

This meringue was perfection! It got rave reviews from all our dinner party guests. It will be my "go to" recipe from now on. I baked it before I left for work this morning and then left it in the oven cooling all day and it held up beautifully. This pavlova is such a lovely and easy summer dessert!

Made this today for the first time and followed all the instructions and also took note of some tips in here from other reviews like: "don't use a plastic bowl" and " let the eggs come to room temperature before messing with them. It came out perfect! I have to make 2 more tomorrow. This one was a tester.

I usually find pavlovas to be too sweet, so I cut back a little on the sugar.  Also,I didn't have super fine sugar so I used regular sugar and made them in individual sizes.  They had a nice crunch on the exterior with a beautifully soft interior.  I use a flavored Greek yogurt instead of whipped cream on my pavlovas and topped with fruit.  It makes a fabulous dessert.

I liked the crispness of this shell. I'd decrease sugar next time to 3/4 C. was too sweet for my liking.

I often find with pavlova there is a gap between the crust and the marshmallow part. This is fixed by banging the tray with the pav on it on the counter a few times so that the air bubbles escape. Delish!
