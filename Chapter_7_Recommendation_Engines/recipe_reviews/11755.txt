This was absolutly amazing.  Everyone needs to try this delicious recipe.  I did doctor it up some by adding chopped green onions, extra garlic, chopped celery, and about a teaspoon of crushed red pepper.  When the dish was done I threw the pasta right into the anchovy skillet along with a chopped tomato, two more chopped green onion, and a handful of chopped parsley--WOW!!!  I'm sure without the additions it's still good, but I recommend adding your own personal touch.

I'm am anchovy fan and this is THE way to do anchovies. I'm not a fan of linguini, though, so I normally make this with spaghetti. A few tips: I don't add any water. I use more olive oil, though. You don't really need to simmer anchovies, just heat them through. Don't let them fall apart completely, you want some fillet pieces in there. This recipe relies on quality ingredients, so get the GOOD anchovies and oil. ALWAYS Use fresh parsley. I add it when I toss the pasta with the sauce, I don't cook it. I also add a lot of fresh black pepper. There's also no need for parmesan, it would just make this too salty.

This is a christmas eve dish in our familty. It is a part of the feast of seven fishes.  We let the oil cook for hours with the anchovies and garlic in it.  It gives it great flavor. When we do the anchovies they are chopped up very small and then they boil down in the oil so that those who are not fond of looking at the anchovies don't see them.  Very good recipe..and the longer it simmers the better it is!!!!

A nice, tasty dish that is easy to throw together with things already in your cupboard. I added four cloves of minced garlic as well as some mushrooms for some extra punch. Although this strays far from the original recipe, I steamed up some spinach and mushrooms and mixed it in as well to add some vitamins and minerals. Served with some garlic bread, this was delicious! If you don't have canned anchovies on hand, you can substitute anchovy paste (1/2 teaspoon per anchovy fillet) -- I used two tablespoonsful and it turned out very nicely.

Great recipe for a fast and satisfying meal.  I used chicken broth instead of water which provided an extra layer of flavour.  Yum. Would make it again for a quick and hearty week night dinner.

So good! When I make this, I double the garlic (7 or 8 cloves) and just use one can of anchovies. I also add red pepper flakes. Its an awesome dish, but pretty rich. I usually serve it with a salad or as a side dish to chicken.

Very good recipe!  If you enjoy traditional, authentic Italian cuisine, you will enjoy this recipe.  The only modification I made to the recipe is as follows:  - I substituted 3 (2.0 oz.) cans of Anchovy Filets for 1 (2.0 oz.) can Anchovy Filets, chopped.  The reason for the substitution: My husband is Italian and the recipe matches the same method utilized by his Mother (from Italy), with the exception of the quantity of anchovies.  In her preperation, she uses one can of anchovy filets in olive oil and it has always produced a mild fish flavor as opposed to the overpowering anchovy flavor, by using three.  Top with freshly grated Italian cheese (of your choice) and enjoy! =)

This did not taste like I expected it to.  I thought it would be salty but it wasn't.  My husband and daughter loved it.  I added tomatoes, mushrooms, green pepper, and garlic powder.  This was so easy to make but next time I will use can clams instead of anchovies.

My fiance and I estimated that you would likely pay $16-20 for a plate like this in a restaurant in town!!  And it was soooooo easy!  Really delicious with some chopped tomatoes and brocoli in it and feta cheese on top.  Thanks for the truly amazing recipe! Next time, I think I'll add shrimp or mussels to it and make a $25 recipe, or more!

I made this for the first time last night.  I added 2 extra cloves of sliced garlic, and a hefty tablespoon of capers...  It was fantastic!  Fast, easy, and oh so tasty!

Wow. Very tasty. Had some leftovers anchovies from making Caesar salad the night before and this was a great way to use them up. I topped it off with Parmesan cheese.

I grew up with a similar recipe, no meat on Fridays back then, so my Mom was always busy making the meatless meals for Fridays.  So I went ahead to make this recipe.  It turned out great, I used a bit more garlic, also sauteed fresh mushroom (I had them in the refrig) with the garlic, a bit of clam juice instead of water, lots of fresh parsley, about 2 T fresh lemon juice and also some zest from the lemon.  It was so good, I served with a fresh tomato salad and hot Italian bread.  Make this and add what you like or make the changes you think would be best for you and your family.  This is a great recipe to play with for your own flavor choices. Enjoy

Let me say that this is an excellant classic sauce.  It can hold as much garlic as you can, I also add red pepper flake which is more traditional.  On a low carb diet?  Try it out on butterflied grilled chicken breasts or fish.  Insanely good and you come off looking like a gourmet

Used 1 can of anchovies, 3 large cloves thinly sliced garlic and 1/2 onion thinly sliced.  Did not use all the water - only a splash or two and 1/2 # angle hair.  I loved it - hubby said it was interesting.  My aunt used to make this when I was a little girl and I loved it - thanks, Dennis, for the recipe.  I'll be making this again and again!!

I actually was about to post this same recipe as it was passed down from my Italian grandmother. Fabulous recipe. I have gotten friends to fall in love with it when they didn't even LIKE anchovies! it is on the salty side (which I feel is offset a little by the garlic).   If re-heating, drizzle a little water over the pasta because this is a dry sauce.

After years of going out on Christmas Eve, my sister and I decided to try to recreate the dinner our Italian family had on Christmas Eve when we were kids.  I remember anchovy pasta being one of my favorites but neither of us remembered how to make it.  I decided to try this recipe and it was a hit!  I made a couple of minor changes:  did not mince the garlic - just smashed & left it whole, used basil instead of parsley and added a couple of shakes of red pepper flakes.  My son, nephew and brother-in-law loved this so much I only got a small serving because they devoured the rest.  I will definitely come back to this recipe next year!  Thanks for giving me a chance to recreate one of my favorite childhood memories of Christmas Eve.

Awesome!  Cheap, easy, delicious!  Not too salty and mixed with a little grated parmesan or romano cheese gives it a little heft too.  Will be making this over and over1

Classic flavor, simple, and cheap! I was looking for a recipe so I could finally use some cans of anchovies and get them out of my way...but this tastes so good (eating it now) I think I will put anchovies on my next grocery list! Next time I plan on trying it out with less water.

This is a good recipe.  I added the green onions as recommended by another reviewer.  I also added a can of diced tomatoes with the liquid, skipping the water.  Next time, I will reduce the amount of olive oil by two tablespoons.  Overall, this is a keeper!

This is amazing!  I've been looking for a recipe to replicate a dish my Italian aunt makes at Christmas Eve and this was just as good.  After I tossed through the anchovy sauce I also added some lightly toasted panko breadcrumbs and some extra chopped parsley.  It was divine, even my 3 y.o. enjoyed it and my husband who doesn't like anchovy cleaned his plate.

This is dish is not only very inexpensive, but is DELISH, and oh so easy to tune to your own taste.  Add broccoli, crushed red pepper, more garlic...  Sometimes, instead of using grated parmesan cheese, I toast some Italian flavored bread crumbs in butter and use it instead, OMG-one word-Fantastic! My family loves it!

What a great recipe. Easy...Fast...Delicious. The only thing added was some red pepper flakes and a little more garlic. Next time, after plating, I may sprinkle some dice tomato on top drizzled with some good olive oil.

Lovely recipe as is, and ridiculously easy. However, the second time I made it, I threw in some dry white wine, chili flakes, and fresh sliced basil (at the very end or as a garnish, so the flavor is vibrant). I served the pasta alongside steamed kale... YUM!!

Easy to make - however, we thought this was just ok.  I added a small onion, chopped and about 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes per the suggestion of other reviews. I omitted the parsley since I didn't have fresh.  I like ceasar salad dressing with real anchovies, however this just wasn't what I expected.  My son ended up adding salt to the dish and thought that made it better.  Will not make again.  Hoping left overs will taste better.

I didn't love this recipe.  I try not to change things until I've made it at least once following the recipe exactly, but I only had one 2-oz can of anchovies, and I was out of fresh parsley, so to this recipes credit, maybe it didn't have a fair chance.  Even taking that into consideration, I thought this recipe was bland and I don't know that another 1/2 tin of anchovies would have made the difference to bring it up to a 4 or 5 star recipe.  Maybe something in place of the water?  My boys did like it though, so I will be trying it again when I have all of the exact ingredients.  Thanks for a great idea using anchovies!

The best pasta recipe I've made! Mmmmm sooo yummy. The anchovy-garlic oil is a perfect flavour base I'm going to use often now. I changed this recipe by adding some shrimps, chunks of halibut and some frozen peas for color. I had no persil so only added a pinch of dried persil. I also added some cooking cream, since I prefer my pastas in a creamy sauce. The result was to die for and looked gorgeous, with the pink shrimp and green peas on the creamy white pasta. My 2 year old ate a big bowl too :)

Fantastic!  I used more olive oil, and added some hand crushed tomatos and spinach at the end for a few minutes

My boyfriend is a seafood lover and greatly enjoyed this recipe. I am not a huge fan of fishy tasting seafood, and this was definantly more fishy than I expected. I think for how few ingredients and how simple it is to prepare, it is a fabulous recipe. A big A+ from my other half, but if you are not a big fan of seafood, this might not be the pasta for you.

I love anchovies, but had them only on salads & pizza. When I found this recipe, I just had to try it. It was, and is what "what you talking about good," and simple. Added greens for the vitamins.

My husband loves anchovies so I prepared this especially for him.  He gave it a "so-so" rating.  He said it was a good starting point to dress more to his tastes.  Thanks.

This was my first time cooking anchovies...and I must say, this recipe was not bad, though not entirely to my taste.  For one thing, were the anchovies supposd to completely liquify and turn into part of the sauce?  Because that's what happened to mine, and I followed the recipe exactly!  Oh well, maybe I didn't do something right.  However, the taste over-all was still pretty good.  Thanks for the recipe.

YUMMY!  If you like anchovies, this is a treat.  So simple and I made it even simpler by using minced garlic from a jar.  Also added a couple squirts of fresh lemon.  Just excellent.

I'll admit, I was skeptical from the first readig of the recipe to the tasting of the sauce. But once I mixed it with the pasta, it tasted EXACTLY like a clam sauce you'd find in a restaurant. Not over-salty, delicate, silky, just perfect. I used 1 can of anchovies, 2 garlic, and half a box of pasta. I also added white wine, a pinch of basil and a pinch of oregano. But really, it's the FRESH parsley that makes it. I also added parmesan cheese and butter to finish it off and make the sauce rich and slightly creamy. Perfection!

This is a simple, quick recipe with just a few ingredients, but the taste is really good. I thought the anchovies would be too salty, but they actually add a great umami flavor to the pasta. Using broth instead of water, as suggested by another reviewer, does add a certain something that was lacking the first time I made this. I like to add freshly-grated Parmesan on top.

This is such an easy recipe and tastes absolutely amazing. I added more fresh parsley, like lot more. If you're scared it's going to be too salty, it is NOT at all. The extra parsley may also calm down that flavor. I also added a bit of fresh ground pepper. Just perfect flavors, garlic, anchovy, and parsley can all be tasted. Even the 2 year old I nannied liked it!

This was so yummy, fast, and easy! I made this for Ash Wednesday, and my family loved it. I can see having it as is, or adding capers, shrimp, clams, mussels, etc. to jazz it up. Thanks for the great recipe!
