This is a fun way to make eggs differently. Some people think this may be a lot of work for just eggs, but it’s fairly simple! The great thing about this recipe is you can substitute many options in the egg whites. Fold in bacon crumbles, tomatoes, shredded cheese, etc for different combination flavors.

These are so unique and have such a beautiful appearance and taste.  One note of caution---the egg whites can easily over cook so I would stick to three minutes of baking the egg whites first even if they are not lightly brown yet, then add the egg yolks.  The egg yolks will  be slightly runny so if you are concerned about salmonella I would use pasteurized eggs.  For the life of me I don't know why they don't just pasteurize all eggs to prevent problems as many people also like runny sunny side up eggs.

After fluffing the egg whites I folded in some shredded cheddar cheese and bacon pieces.  I made a piece of toast for each egg and placed the completed egg cloud on the toast. It was really good and pretty easy to make. I usually avoid breakfast recipes but this one is pretty good.

It wasnt as easy as it made it sound. The egg whites wouldn't fluff very well because of the salt, pepper, and Parmesan cheese. It took longer than 15 mins. In the end I might have well just made normal fried eggs instead.

We didn’t like these. Maybe it was the texture? Won’t be making again.
