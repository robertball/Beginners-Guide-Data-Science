I cut the butter in half, and omitted the oil.  Instead of ap flour, I used whole wheat, and instead of whole milk, I used soy milk.  This was an easy soup to make, and has a comfort factor to it!  I put the soup in the blender so that the small pieces of ginger would be very tiny when eaten instead of straining the bits out.  This is great any time of year!
