I need a dessert for a July 4th campout and experminted with this recipe.  Instead of using all rainbow colors, I used red, white and blue. Some color did run into the layer beneath but could still tell each color. I put white icing on top and red, white and blue sprinkles on top.  They really came out nice.  Thanks for a wonderful idea!

very fun, colorful cupcakes that the kids enjoyed making, but they ended up being very dry and crumbly.  not sure what they would need to be more moist, but it could use something.

Great recipe! I did make a few tweaks. I always bake with corn oil instead of vegetable oil and use a lower temperature and have never had an issue cakes being dry. I also used a touch more vanilla and less flour. I didn't have red food dye, so I threw in pinch of cherry jello mix. They looked and tasted great! Definitely will make again!

This was fun to make and it looked really cool. The only down side was that is did not taste amazing. The kids I made it for liked it but for me I think it could have been a little bit tastier.

I made these but didnt dye the batter I made them for fathers day and dyed food doesn't appeal to my hubby but I needed a white cake mix so used this. Its VERY delicious much more moist than I would of guessed considering how thick the batter was. I pairs it with the rum icing from this site (altered) and they were great and easy to make!

The first time i did a these cupcakes they were okay but VERY dry. I then gave them another dry but changed it up a little. Since i dont have any eggs at room temperature i put some eggs in a glass full of warm water, i then softened the butter for about 10 sec. and i Folded in 1/2 cup sour cream to the prepared batter they turned out great, they were deffinetly not dry anymore.

I just made these cupcakes and they turned out a little dry and the taste wasnt quite what i was expecting. I followed the recipe exactly and I did use food coloring and layered the different colors and they look great! I would use the layering method again, but might have to change the recipe next time for a tastier and more moist cupcake.

For bakers who end up with dry baked goods as some state has happened with these cupcakes, the issue most likely is how you measure your flour. Digging the flour out with you cup, may add as much as a quarter cup more flour to the mix. If you stir the flour, then spoon lightly into your measuring cup, filling above the top and scraping off the extra, then the dry crumblies may be gone forever!

Instead of using vegtable oil use applesauce. It makes it a lot moister. No dry and crumbly cupcakes for any one else!!!

I made these cupcakes with my Girl Scout troop as part of their cooking badge. The colors turned out cool.  The girls really liked that part.  However, the cupcakes themselves were very dry.  If I were to make these again I would add more oil or maybe applesauce.

Okay so first of all our batter looked a little weird, but we used all the appropriate ingredients, and they turned out tasting like...cornbread. Also, we split the batter into 6 bowls and added in the orange and purple and the colors turned out very nicely but the taste was just cornbread.

This is not a recipe for cupcakes. This is a recipe for corn muffins. Do not be fooled. "Cookiemonster" will delete this comment because she is unwilling to accept that her recipe is not up to par with what is promised in the title. DO NOT BE FOOLED. LOOK ELSEWHERE IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GOOD RECIPE CREATED BY SOMEBODY WHO CAN TAKE THE CRITICISM BECAUSE COOKIEMONSTER OBVIOUSLY CANNOT.

I thought this recipe turned out great! I made these for a baby shower and they were devored in minutes! I loved the colors and the recipe was easy to follow. I added my own home made frosting which has concentrated sugar, 2 cups of butter, and milk. Overall the whole thing came out beautifully and i definitely will be making this again for whatever occasion comes up!

This recipe is ok. But me and my niece were looking forward to making amazing cupcakes for her sleepover. So we tried this awesome rainbow cupcakes, Unfortunately they were not as awesome as we thought. They were very dry and crumbly. I think they look better on the computer than actually making them. My niece was very upset. So we just bought the package of cupcake mix and died it different colors. At least, it tasted better than this recipe.

The 1st time I made these it was for my daughter's 8th birthday in July and I actually made 60+ cupcakes!!!!! Each batch was its own unique pattern. I enjoyed experimenting and  making them. They turned out quite well- pretty & tasty.  The kids thought they were so cool and the parents complimented me a lot.  I have made these cupcakes a few more times since just because...and my friends and kids enjoys them every time! They really are a hit!!!

These were not bad for a basic recipe.  Next time I would replace the milk with sour cream or yogurt, the oil with applesauce, and reduce the baking powder by 1/2 tsp. to improve the texture.  Some cinnamon or cardamom wouldn't hurt either.  I don't care for the taste of the food coloring; maybe gel colors would be better.  Note: The three reviews below referring to cornbread are really good examples of why we now need a "report abuse" option on this site.

Made these for my boyfriend's daughter's 8th birthday party. I figured these would be a good counterpart to the completely chocolate cupcakes she wanted. She helped, so instead of layered colors they were swirled colors, which the colors looked nice like that. They were enjoyed and went better than the chocolate, but I did follow the advice of another review and put less flour and more milk into the mixture.

I made these cupcakes for a family cook-out.  After reading all the reviews and seeing the complaints about them being dry, I simply used a white box cake mix and tinted them per this recipe.  No problem with dryness and everyone (especially the kids) loved the different colors.

After following a reviewers suggestion to substitute applesauce for butter, that is the only change I made. The batter was more dense than a box version but I’m guessing that’s because the colored layers need to hold up. After baking them and letting them cool, the  cupcake was more solid than light,  like I’m use to eating. The flavor was good but not worth the effort unfortunately. The presentation was beautiful spin cutting, thanks.

Turned out wonderfully. Not too sweet. Very moist. Not at ALL dry and crumbly. Don't over mix the batter, and they should turn out beautifully. Thanks for this recipe. :D (I used cream cheese frosting.) So delicious, they were gone in two days. I didn't eat them all by myself. Don't worry ;)

I made this for a bake sale and they were all sold. Instead for the food colouring I used a dark blue light blue and light green and they turned out really good. The only think that I thought was a little upsetting was how it was very elasticity.

Sift your flour! After reading so many reviews mentioning these were dry, I guessed that people were putting in too much flour. Scoop and level compacts the flour and you can get too much. We sifted ours, spooned into the cup, then leveled. Cakes in particular are very sensitive to the right amount of flour. Ours turned out tender and moist. The colors were beautiful (we used paste colors, which are more vibrant than liquid). Perfect for my daughter's painting themed birthday party!

It was really pretty, and I loved how it looked, but it  tastes like cornbread. However, adding chocolate icing saved it.

I had a week's notice to make these for an activity on the following weekend and so I did a "test run" of this recipe every day.  Each day I modified something.  What I found is that on batch #1, adding 1/2 cup sour cream creates a more moist cupcake; however, it's a little more "dense."  For batch #2, I didn't put any sour cream, but instead put 1/2 cup applesauce. This gave a more "fluffy" texture.  Finally, for batch #3, I made no modifications, immediately covered the cupcakes with cling wrap and let them sit for one day. This too moistened them. Ultimately, I chose the applesauce method and combined it with the "sit for one day" method.  It was what my particular gang preferred; however, I can see why other people would prefer the moistness offered by the sour cream method.

an important part of the recipe is that you use SOFTENED BUTTER instead of melted butter. it creates that lighter color mentioned in the directions and when it comes out of the oven it makes the cake softer. i have made this twice both ways and when i made this with melted butter the cake was dry and crumbly so i switched to softened butter and it was so much better.

I loved them! They were big and dense, but it could use a lot more moisture. Otherwise, when you add a thick layer of buttercream frosting, they taste delicious! :)

I made this for my class and everybody loved it! People started asking if i used a box because of how good it was! I didn't have time to do rainbow but i did use blue food coloring. I would suggest  this to everyone! I baked the cupcakes for a total of 19minutes! Defiantly will do this recipe again!

I used this recipe to make a cake and cupcakes for a birthday party.  The flavor was great, but next time I will remember that the flour must be sifted as the cake was VERY dense.  Will be using again! Kids loved it.

This recipe was fun and challenging to make, but there were a few problems. The cake was really dry and bland, and the dyed batter blended together, so it seemed more like a polka-dotted muffin. I would maybe try doing more simple cupcakes, and maybe moisten it and add more flavor.

The cupcakes turned out beautifully, however I didn't care for the taste.  They were too sweet and dry.

I made these cupcakes and they looked amazing but the fast wasn't quite right, I think that the dough when they were cooked wasn't very "fluffy". They were EXTREMELY fun to make, even alone. The cupcakes took me TWO HOURS to make by myself and that is far from 35 minutes.

My cupcakes turned out dry and crumbly. I even substituted applesauce for  vegetable oil like others suggested. Also, my colors didn't turn out like in the picture.  When I peeled back the wrapper, you couldn't see the different colors, but you could when you bit into it.   I hope with the  buttercream icing (Allrecipes)by Sharon Gerstman my guests like it for today's celebration.

However the work that goes into these cupcakes, made me think these would be out of this world!! Urgh, YUCK! My 3 year old that will eat anything that contains sugar told me they tasted like bread. It was almost like a banana bread batter taste minue the bananas in them. Bummer, love the concept and teaching my children yummy things can be made from ingredients in our closet, not just from 1 cardboard box.

I think this recipe turned out ok. They were light and fluffy and tasty, due to me adding extra vanilla. But I did notice the next day, they tasted to me a bit dry but not as much. So the 2nd time I made them, I didn't mix as long. So they came out just right.Recipe is a keeper!

The first time I made these, they were as hard as a rock. But then I made them a second time to see if I could do better. When I bit into them a second time, let's just say they were better than the cupcakes made from a box, or the kind you buy in a store, in my opinion. They were so fluffy, and really tasty! I love these! I'll make these all the time now! Thanks for the recipe!

I have used many different cake/cupcake recipes, at first I was concerned with the amount of egg in the recipe but the cupcakes turned out amazing! I took them to another level by stuffing a Girl Guide cookie in the Middle. I recommend this recipe 100%

Just mixed all the ingredients (except the coloring) in a bowl and they were wonderful!
I think I've found my go-to cupcake recipe :)

I made these for my son's class on his birthday.  They were a big hit.  I did find the batter very thick after adding the food colouring.  It was difficult to spoon into the cups so I ended up piping it and then had to smooth it out each layer with a wet spoon.  This recipe is time consuming but the effect is great.  I was able to squeeze 26 cupcakes out of the batter.  I would suggest using paste type colouring as the liquid stuff does not give the brightest colours.

These turned out so delicious! But instead of food coloring, I used icing coloring, which should turn out the same! I made them for Christmas and my family loved them!:)

I had to modify this recipe A LOT. 1/2 a cup is not nearly enough of milk. I also used turbinado sugar rather than white sugar, just because.You have to play around with it a little, but it's still yummy and lots of fun to eat.

I made these for my sisters class tomorrow and they turned out great.I haven't actually tried them yet, but they cooked, look, and smell amazing! I didn't color them, i was only looking for a vanilla cupcake recipe. People were saying that they were dry, so I only did 2 1/4 cup flour. I also added 2 tsp. vanilla and did half whole wheat flour. I also cooked at 325 degrees and baked them for about 22 minutes. Definitely a keeper. Thanks :) (Though i did only get 21 cupcakes from them, but that's okay because she only needed 19.)

These are great!  My kids (four and two) and I have a 'kid kitchen' session at least once a week and made these together.  They had a blast mixing up the different colors and then layering them into the muffin tin.  I was amazed at how vibrant the colors were after cooking and how pretty they were when you cut into them.  We frosted them with rainbow hip icing which tasted great with the cupcakes.  We will definitely be making these again.
