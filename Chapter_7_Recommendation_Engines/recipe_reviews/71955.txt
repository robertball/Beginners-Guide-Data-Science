Delicious!  I love the combination of strawberries and blueberries.  I used fat free vanilla yogurt,  cut the sugar in half as well as the amount of ice.  I garnished it with a couple of frozen blueberries and a little whipped cream on top.

I've made this recipe three or four times in the last two weeks.  It is so good I can't get enough!
If you have some left over, put it in the freezer. Then thaw it out for an hour or so and put it back in the blender when you want a quick treat.  It's just as good left over!

This was good but too thick for my tastes.  I think that can be remedied by leaving out the ice cubes since the fruit is frozen.  Also the title made me expect a more "creamy" taste than there was.  Maybe the next batch I'll try with milk instead of juice.

This was a nice smoothie. I used frozen mixed berries as that's all I had on hand but I think just blueberries & strawberries as written would be much nicer. The mixed berries were too gritty my taste. Thanks for sharing!

This was wonderful!  Instead of pineapple juice I used Dole's "Paradise Blend" and regular orange juice together.

I had some orange/tangerine Juicy Juice that my
family wasn't drinking so I hid it in this and
added a banana (which they also won't eat).  Great way to sneak in some nutrition!

Average.  Perhaps a little cinnamon mixed in would help bring it up a notch?

Very good, very cold and VERY thick.  Hubs enjoyed it - he said it was pleasantly tart (I forgot the sugar...) but thought that perhaps it might be better without the ice cubes, which he believed diluted the flavor a little.  Once I realized I had forgotten the sugar I asked him if he wanted me to add some and he didn't, so apparently the sugar isn't really necessary for this to taste good.  It looks really cool when you pour it into the glass because it's so thick it kind of piles on the top, like a thick malt!  Pineapple-orange juice was not on hand,  but orange juice was, so that's what I used.  This is an excellent way to get your calcium (and the active cultures) and vitamins - when I make these for Hubs I feel like I've done something good and healthy for him for breakfast that he probably woudn't do on his own.

It's good but need to use less orange/pineapple juice.  Just made it and I taste mostly the citrus juices and not the berries at all.

Let me start by saying I didn't think I would like this very much because blueberries are not my favorite. But, I was looking for a healthy smoothie to make for breakfast and strawberries and blue berries were all I had on hand. I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I used regular orange juice, strawberry yogurt, no ice, and I replaced the sugar with honey. SO good!! I was seriously tempted to make another! It was nice and thick, but not as thick as some reviews said theirs were. Probably because I didn't use ice. Nothing was overpowering. Perfect amount of everything. SO SO good and so healthy!! Easy and quick for breakfast. This is my new breakfast smoothie! 
UPDATE:
I have made this a few more times now. I was in the middle of making it once, and I realized someone drank all the orange juice I had, and soi used milk instead, and I didn't like it as much. It probably would've been better if I added more fruit. The milk was overpowering to me. I've also used a cup of frozen mixed berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries) and followed the rest of the recipe exactly, and it was very good as well, but the original recipe is the best!

Very nice. I like the strawberry/blueberry combination. Both flavors stood out well. It was too thick though, so I would recommend leaving out the ice cubes. They are not necessary as you're using frozen fruit anyway. Ice also tends to dilute a smoothie. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Great smoothie! I used organic fat free plain yogurt, omitted the sugar and added 1/2 scoop of protein supplement.

My husband and I LOVE this recipe.  When I make it I don't usually add the two teaspoons of sugar- I think it's sweet enough without.  Also, I usually don't add a full cup of the orange juice and it turns out pretty creamy.

One of the things I love about smoothies is the way you can slightly alter the ingredients to use what you have on hand. Instead of all vanilla yogurt, I used 1/2 vanilla and 1/2 strawberry (what was left from another smoothie) and all orange juice instead of the oj/pineapple blend. I omitted the sugar because it was plenty sweet for me. This has a beautiful color and tastes delicious!

My kids thought this was great. I had a frozen banana so instead of ice, I used that. I used Nancy's organic vanilla nonfat yogurt.

I made this recipe and everyone LOVED it! From my meat and potatoes hubby all the way down 4 children to my 17 mos. old. I did add a little milk so that we could easily drink it from a straw.

yummy. I'd make it again. I used an actual smoothie maker, used plain yogurt and added vanilla, because that's what I had, and mixed oj and pineapple juice from a can of pineapples, again it was on hand. I wonder if I had the true ingredients it could have gotten a 5 star...?

We really liked this one! Followed exactly but used a Mango/OJ blend from Simply Orange which is some of the best OJ out there. Also used Greek Vanilla Fat-free yogurt. This smoothie tastes like one you would pay $5 for -- terrific flavor, color too.

As far as those who complained about "grit" from the berries, that's part of the homemade freshness (and charm) and my 5 and 2 year olds who are as picky as anyone loved it. This is a winner. Thanks GOLDILOCKS!

I made this for myself and my three year old after we decided it was too hot for a real supper while Daddy was away.  I did have to change it a little bit.  I left out the yogurt and added a small can of pineapple tidbits with the juice instead of the juice.  It came out great!  We both loved it.  We will definetly make this again!

Loved this! I used a frozen berry mix  since that was what was available at my grocery store and Treetop Pineapple Orange juice. Based on other reviews I left the sugar out and did half the ice. The juice was enough that I didn't miss the sugar. 

It was thick, delicious, and easy to make. I also put some spinach in a few times and that worked well too.

I didn't have yogurt or the juice blend so I substituted 1 cup milk for the yogurt and 1 cup Mango Punch Tampico juice for the pineapple and orange juice. I also added two heaping tablespoons chocolate powder like Nesquik and it came out really good.

Awesome recipe! I made it along with an Italian meal for my mom's birthday and we all loved it. Thanks!
