Well with A LOT of doctoring this recipe turned out great! First I made a much yummier sauce then this recipe called for. I used Sun Dried Tomatoe sauce and garlic tomatoe paste a little brown sugar some hot sauce lots of garlic ect. I didn't mix all the cheeses/sour cream in to the meat mixture because that sounded a little yucky to me. Instead I assembled it like you would lasagna with a layer of the cheese mixture all on it's own. So for that I didn't actually measure the cheeses or sour cream. Just threw what I thought would be good in a bowl and stired it up. I also added half each of a yellow and red pepper and about 1 cup of grated aged cheddar cheese. I then in a greased casserole dish put half the noodles all the cheese mixture half the meat sauce remaining noodles remaining meat suuce and finally topped it all off with some more grated cheddar and a sprinkle of parm. Yumm!!! Loved this at least the way I made it. It's a great idea just play with it to make it the likes of your family. Thanx for this great idea though!:)

Speaking as Dad who picks-up the kids and makes dinner for Mom when she gets home this was an easy meal to make. It even passed the finicky 5 year-old test. You may want to add some spices to give it flavor all that cream cheese cottage cheese and sour cream can be bland for some tastes.

This was very easy but quite bland. I substituted picante sauce for tomato sauce. It needs to be covered in the oven to keep noodles from becoming dry. Needs some spices and maybe some cheese on top.

This recipe was so easy you don't even have to drain the ground beef after you brown it just add everything together and bake!! This is one of the few recipes I trust my fourteen year old to make and I know it will turn out. It's hard to mess this one up! Also use a 9x13 instead of a 2qt. it makes alot.

Too easy to taste this good! I can have this dish on the table in about 45 minutes. It is also great using diced chicken. If you like italian based dishes and are time poor you have to try this recipe. I do add 1/2 teaspoon of basil and oregano for a more italian taste and top with grated cheese before baking and substitue tomato sauce for tomato soup. Serve with garden salad ranch dressing and garlic bread - excellent!!!!

I added a few spices to the sauce (onion powder garlic powder italian seasoning fresh ground pepper) but other than that I kept to the recipe. The little kids liked it okay my husband and I weren't real big fans. I think this would have been better had it included some shredded cheese and cut back on the sour cream a touch.

A few days ago I had some dairy products that I wanted to use up so after doing an ingredient search I decided to give this one a try. I thought it would go over well with my toddler but unfortunately I've still got leftovers. In hindsight I should of used the Parmesan as suggested as a topping or come up with something else because it seemed to be lacking something. Sorry.

I had high hopes for this dish - it has some of my favorite ingredients. However it was just okay - too bland for my taste. I even added garlic and mushrooms to the beef when browing it and used herb tomato sauce. My husband liked it but I probably will no make again.

Simple and quick dinner to prepare. I divided this casserole into three small dishes. One to be eaten and the other two to freeze. Because the sour cream cottage cheese and cream cheese are mixed with other ingredients it froze well and baked up beautifully. I baked the frozen one in the toaster oven for 1 hour at 350. This would also be very good made with sausage rather than hamburger. This recipe has been "faceless" since at least September 2000. Glad to finally add a picture.

This was ok for something quick. A glorified hamburger helper. Pretty bland even after I added some garlic and seasoned salt. Would also make it a little more liquidy. Was kind of dry. Kids would probably like this.

It was okay... kind of bland-tasting and was too sour cream-y. Needs less sour cream and more spices. I don't think I'll make it again. It was fun to make though:)

My 14 yr old daughter found this recipe on here and made it for us for dinner a few nights ago... we took the advice of other reviews and used salsa sauce instead of tomato sauce and added 1 cup shredded cheese in mix and on top! Very filling meal even the picky younger two ate this! Will make this one again!

This was a good recipe. I changed some things that other members had suggested. I used crushed tomatoes with garlic and basil. I also skipped the cottage cheese because my husband doesn't like it and substitued with mozzarella and parmesan shredded cheeses reserving some to place on top of the cassarole. I also used onion powder about 1 Tbsp since I didn't have any onions on hand. I didn't add salt when I was cooking because I wasn't sure how salty the cheeses would make the cassarole but it definately needed it.

This turned out pretty good. I only had penne pasta but I think it might have been better if I used the egg noodles. The penne was a little too dense. The only other thing I did based on feedback from other reviewers that it was too bland was that I added about 1/2 tsp of Italian seasoning to the sauce. Also next time I will scaled down the sour cream as it's flavor was too dominant against the cream cheese and cottage cheese.

Definitely not a favorite of ours. It tasted very similar to Hamburger Helper and I am not a big fan of that. It was very easy to make but needed more spice. Probably won't make again.

Rave reviews from my family! I first made this exactly how the recipe reads and it turned out well however we do lots of leftovers for lunches and the noodles were really mushy the next day. The second time I made it I subbed the noodles for steamed shredded cabbage it was a big hit again.

My mom used to make something similar to this, so it was nice to have the measurements and not have to guess.  I did change a few things, I used spaghettie sacue instead of tomato sauce and 1/2 Italian sausage and 1/2 ground meat, although in the past I have made it with all hamburger and its great that way as well, just that this time I had 1/2 oound of hamburger leftover from another recipe, so added the sauasge.  I cooked the sauce and meat while the water came to boil and then coontinued to cook the sauce while I cooked the noodles, just a preference.  Then I made 2 other changes that I remember my mom doing, I put a laot of pepper in the cream cheese/sour cream/cottage cheese mixture and I layerd 1/2 th noodle mixture in a 12x9 pan, then 1/2 the  sauce, then the other 1/2s and then a generous sprinkiling of shredded Italian cheese mix.  My mom used to call this poor mans  lasagna and so the Italain cheese addition plus using saghettii sauce vs tomato reinforces this.  Brings back good memories, thanks for the recipe!

I made this for the first time ever tonight.  It was really great!  My husband and I loved it!  Very minor changes-didn't have enough egg noodles so added about a cup of farfalle pasta to the mix.  Also, added about a half tsp. each of oregano and basil to the meat mixture.  Had a half green pepper so added that in with the onion.  And, sprinkled top of casserole with some sharp cheddar cheese.  It was so good and I will make this again, for sure!

It's a good recipe and although it doesn't LOOK too appetizing it tastes pretty good.
