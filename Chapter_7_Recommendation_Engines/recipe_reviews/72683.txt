My mom and I spent HOURS in the kitchen preparing this recipe that she thought would be fantastic (based on such good reviews).  Guess what?  No better than any old store-bought jar of salsa, and if you don't think your salsa should have a sweet taste, it's not even as good.  I'll stick to fresh tomatoes, garlic, onions, jalapenos, lime juice and cilantro.  It's never failed me, and all my guests love it.

Excellent recipe! Just like mom makes haha!! Fantastic taste and nice chunky texture. Way better than store bought. I love how easy it is to accomodate everyone's taste; you can make it hotter or milder just by varying the types and amount of peppers used. The jars store well and last a very long time. I make this recipe all the time. It is a healthy low fat condiment that goes well on everything from scrambled eggs to hot dogs. Well done KB CountryGirl!!   ;-)

Very good salsa, but VERY important note: let the salsa sit in the jars for several days before opening. I opened a jar the day after canning and my first impression was "ok". I opened another jar 5 days later, and let me tell you, the flavors really came out. I don't know if waiting longer than 5 days helps, I ate it all within a week!

Excellent! I only make 3 pints at a time as to change it up a bit. Sometimes I add lime,only add jalapenos or eliminate this or that. The vinegar and italian seasonings are the key. I always use fresh tomatoes, never canned.

This was so easy to make(time consuming, but easy).  I doubled the recipe, and added 3 TBSP. dried cilanto, 2 cloves of garlic, and I used whatever hot peppers, sweet peppers and onions I had in my garden.  So good, and doubling the recipe gave me 11 quarts of salsa.  I might drain the tomatoes even more than I did next time, because it was a bit watery, but I don't mind it that way. I used my pressure canner and canned it at 10 pounds for 30 minutes.

This was very good! We cut the recipe in half. I would add one or two more jalapenos next time because it wasn't hot enough for us. Couldn't find banana peppers so I substituted with tomatillos and added a few garlic cloves and cilantro. I Forgot to mix the corn starch w/H2O before adding, so we had some corn starch flavor crystals occasionally. Also, we thought it was a tad sweet so we will omit the brown sugar the next time we make this. Bueno salsa!
Thanks for sharing!

Ok, so I think I ate about half a jar while making this! I will never buy store bought salsa again.  I halved the recipe, it made 4 mason jars full. I used the called for amount of jalapenos, plus threw in some seeds. Also used a serrano pepper with some seeds, just the right amount of spice. I found I did need the cornstarch to thicken things up at the end. I also added 1/2 cup fresh cilantro towards the end, what can I say, I love cilantro. I will make this again and again. Thank you for the recipe!

Taste wise it's pretty good, ours is fairly hot after one day. The consistency reminds me of a Pace picante sauce I think, I tend to like my salsas a little more chunky/fresh. Next time we won't drain the tomatoes and may do even more fresh tomatoes to see if that doesn't come to a middle ground. Might even remove the tomatoe sauce all together from the recipe. It was easy to make, the longest part was just waiting for it to simmer down.

Every fall I make this salsa and beause our tastes are turning to 'hotter' foods, I have increased the peppers to include Habanjero peppers as well as Tai peppers to increase the heat.  Also, I increase the number of jalepeno peppers.  This works well.

This salsa was the first I've made and I was disappointed that it wasn't very spicy.  I suggest adding more garlic and peppers.  I used cilantro because my family loves it.

This is the best salsa recipe yet.  It is better than any store bought.  I have been using it for 2 years now.  I have altered a little adding a little garlic, some hotter peppers, and crushed canned tomatos instead of diced to give it a finer texture.  It's the best.  I especially like it with a good omelet, but great for just dipping chips or on a taco.

I will probably make this again, but use less sugar next time as it turned out a bit sweet for my taste. I will also definately include the seeds of the chilli peppers next time as it was not as spicy as I would have liked it when I left them out. I only simmered it for one half hour as I like my salsa more pico de gallo style.

Great salsa recipe and a good way to use all of the stuff out of your garden, but I like a little more spice to mine so here are my alterations: 5 jalapenos instead of 3, hot hungarian wax peppers instead of banana peppers, no brown sugar, and two cloves of garlic. Remember, make sure to wear plastic gloves when chopping the peppers. Even with my alterations, I would classify the salsa as 'medium.' Next time I will add more jalapenos but these alterations gave me a great salsa to can that everyone will love!

I'm so glad I found this recipe.  I've been wanting to make my own salsa for some time; and with the garden providing lots of produce, I used this recipe today.  I am thrilled with the results.  The flavor and texture are perfect.  Just what I was looking for.  I will be making this often.  A definite keeper!!

Not bad, but it just didn't have enough "kick" for our tastes.  Next time I'll reduce (or omit) the brown sugar and mix up the peppers a bit. Maybe add a bit more salt and garlic. Banana peppers were nearly impossible to come by, so I think I'll take some pepper tips from other reviews.

Wow!  We have tried to find the perfect salsa recipe and this is it for us.  The only change (very minor) would be to use half the chili powder.

I've finally found an excellent salsa recipe!  This salsa has such great flavor and texture.  I cannot stop eating it!  
I'm a big fan of garlic, so I added one whole clove to the salsa, then I pureed the whole mixture...(the husband doesn't like chunky salsa), and it was just fantastic.
Thank you for posting this scrumptuous recipe!

this recipe is GREAT, just as long as you don't cook it too long. I simmered mine a bit too long and it ended up tasting like chili by the time it was done! It was excellent as we were taste testing it earlier!

I roasted the onion and peppers in a 400 degree oven for 15 minutes, also omitted the banana pepper, and added 1/4 cup chopped cilantro.  It was delicious and everyone raved about it-also did not need to thicken it with the cornstarch, had to thin it with a little water.

The BEST!! Thanks for sharing this recipe! Made a batch Sunday and everyone loved it. I added cilantro & garlic. Halfed the sugar. I used a salsa seasoning mix from penzy's spices vs the italian seasoning as it was what I had on hand. Took it to work today and the ladies LOVED it! Better than store bought. Everyone was happy with this first attempt at making salsa!! THANK YOU - THANK YOU for sharing your recipe!! YUMMY!!

This recipe is excellent.  I used three green peppers instead of two green and one red.  I also used a can of mild green chilis instead of the Anaheim chili peppers.  It turned out great, but be prepared to share if you aren't canning, it makes a lot of salsa!

Loved this recipe.  I added garlic and cut the sugar in half since we prefer our salsa less sweet.  I will make this every year, and I will double the batch, since it only lasts about a week in our home. :)

What a great recipe!  This salsa recipe lends itself to adaptation quite readily, so please do not be afraid to experiment with different types and amounts of peppers.  I happened to have several home grown anaheim chili peppers and a couple of serrano, so I used those in this recipe.  I did not have tomato paste or tomato sauce on hand, and since I wanted to make just enough for use the same day, i substituted a little bit more fresh tomato and a small amount of water so that things wouldn't dry out.

I was really pleased with the flavor.  The sweetness that others mentioned in their reviews was there, but it really seemed to come from the anaheim and bell peppers themselves, complimented by the brown sugar.

I would definitely kick the spice up a notch with some more serrano or other hot peppers next time, but I really enjoyed the flavor and texture of this salsa.

Don't forget that if you add cilantro, you'll want to do so near the end of the cooking process.  Simmering cilantro will dissipate most of the flavor that it adds.

This is a great recipe! It's exactly what I was looking for! I chopped my veggies very very tiny and almost pureed my tomatoes. I like my salsy very smooth! I also upped the brown sugar to 3T to make it al ittle sweeter! The only thing I would do differently next time is add an extra jalapeno!

Very good recipe!!!  I did add a few cloves of chopped garlic.  I found that I didn't need to add the cornstarch mixture to thicken it was perfect as is for us.  

It does make quite a bit of salsa, but I froze most of it in small quantities for later use.

Thanks!

This is the only recipe I follow (mostly) to make salsa, only change I have made is the type of peppers I add, depends on what is growing in the garden, and no matter what type of peppers I use, the salsa always tastes fantastic, haven't bought salsa for years, and always get compliments on my homemade salsa

This is a great salsa.  Has bit of a smoky flavor due to the chili powder.  I did leave out the tomato sauce and tomato paste and replaced the can of tomatoes with a can of crushed tomatoes.  I also could not find the Anaheim peppers and replaced it was a can of roasted chili peppers. I also left out the water and cornstarch!
