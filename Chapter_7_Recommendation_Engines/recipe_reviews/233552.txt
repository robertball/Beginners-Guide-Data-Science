A perfect blend of ingredients. I made this ahead to allow the flavors to blend. My wife who eats salads daily also gave this 5 stars.

While the herbs in this dressing were not my fav, I still liked that feature of the dressing well enough.  The apple cider vinegar, on the other hand, I didnâ€™t tolerate nearly as well as I found it too harsh.  Given the boldness of the herbs, a more subtle acid like lemon juice or white wine vinegar would have been better suited here.  Also, I found this on the oily side - I still prefer the 3:1 ratio of oil and vinegar.

I only gave it 3 out of 5 because I felt it was missing something.  I added Italian seasoning and more vinegar, it helped brightened it up. A nice base dressing, thanks for sharing.

i just made this...and i only used 3/4 c oil and that's all i can taste.
i will let this sit overnight and edit again if i change my mind on it.  as written right now, too oily for me.  **edit; added some more vinegar; used for orzo salad and works very well in that.**
