I loved this recipe! it is very versatile, and you can use any jam/jelly or curd for the filling as long as you're sure that you don't over-fill them! I did, and made a huge mess on the sheet pan. the dough has a very flaky, puff-pastry-like quality to it! instead of rolling it into squares, etc. I rolled each half into a rectangle (about 1/2 inch thick), spread on the filling, and rolled it up! be sure to grease the pan, for they stick easily! this is a fantastic recipe, and i highly recommend it! thanks for sharing! :D

The dough needs a good amount of flour added to it after it chills in order to work with it more easily.

It is much easier to use jelly or jam rather than cooking dried fruit, etc. Also, the picture and the directions do NOT go together. If you cut the corner and fold in as instructed, you get a pinwheel cookies, not a round cookie with a layer of fruit. The cookies are very good, fancy looking, and worth the extra preparation time.

The directions are a bit misleading (they don't match the picture associated with this cookie, so could be confusing for beginner bakers), but the recipe itself is quite good. I use apricot (or other flavor) jam or preserves for my filling because it is way easier and just as tasty. And while I did try her dough recipe, any good pie dough recipe will work here. I make mine in the food processor and it goes together super fast.
