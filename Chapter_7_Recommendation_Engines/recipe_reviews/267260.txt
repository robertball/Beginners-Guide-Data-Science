I'm rather impressed with having a frozen ham into a cooked ham in a short amount of time. I had pineapple rings on hand which worked just perfect. I would recommend more cornstarch for a thicker sauce, but that's a preference thing. Would make again and could fit an even bigger ham if needed.

So thankful to find this excellent recipe for a frozen ham.  I didn’t have pineapple so I added 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar and 1/2 cup water.  I also used honey instead of maple syrup.  The ham was very tender and delicious.  It took about 30 minutes for a natural release but I’m sure this time varies according to the ingredients used.
