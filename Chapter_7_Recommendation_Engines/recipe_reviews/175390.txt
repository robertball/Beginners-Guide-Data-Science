Nice flavour, I used fresh dill since I had a HUGE bunch of it in the fridge :-) I didn't serve it totally chilled though, it was still a bit warm when I added the dressing. Wow, those potatoes were like flavour sponges for the dressing, lol. I think serving it warm, reminded me slightly of German potato salad. I would make again, with possibly trying different veggies, or accents in the dressing. Great base, ty for posting. ****Also, for people new to posting reviews, details are appreciated and very helpful to the rest of us who feed(pun intended) our foodie addictions here daily :-)

I absolutely love potato salad made with vinaigrette, and the roasted potatoes are a nice twist.  I don't like celery, so I omitted that.  I also added freshly ground black pepper to the salad.  I like the crunch of raw veggies against the soft potatoes, so I left the peppers and onions raw.  I like this served warm or at room temp best.

turned out ok. Liked spices before vinegar.

Delicious, and if you have a plain taste loving family who just wanted some good roasted potatoes use the first 4 ingredients and the first 2 steps in the directions and VOILA perfect roasted potatoes. Huge hit with the family, guests and I both ways.
