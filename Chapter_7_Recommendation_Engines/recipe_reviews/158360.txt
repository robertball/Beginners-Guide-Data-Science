This is a great recipe.  I use to get something similar at a nearby pizza place when I was in college.  I add green onions to mine for extra zing.

OMG!  My friend made this last night (we did appetizers for the game) and it was awesome.  Everyone loved it and so easy to make!  As we watched her make it (thinking she was insane) the only suggestion she had, was to buy the pizza dough from the pizzeria, as it taste better then store bought.  She even makes this as a regular dinner, as her husband and kids (6 & 4) love it!  And I can see why!

It was ok but not great.  I was hoping it would have tasted like the Pierogi Pizza I used to get at home but it was lacking something.  I added browned onions  on top but still needed something.  I will try again after I get a recipe for the filling for Pierogies.

I expected to love this, but really didn't.  I expected to need a bit more seasoning than I would usually put in mashed potatoes, and added it.  But the taste was still somehow way too bland for us.  I tried adding some corn & spinach to the second batch (like I said, we had expected to love it), but it didn't help either.  I think I would have to put on some type of savory white sauce under the potato layer, or pour something over the top to give it some kind of spark.

I make this but I use Ragu parmesan & mozzerella sauce before putting the potatoes on the crust. 
It is good, the kids love it.

I used to make a similar one for son when he was smaller. I have used sweet potato too and added crumbled sausage to it. Yummy!

this was good. definitely not something to die for. maybe a white sauce wouldve added more flavor like some people are saying.

I needed a last minute snack for a card party one night and this couldn't have been easier or tastier!  I used a prepared pizza crust, a pack of 4-cheese instant mashed potatoes, a pack of crumbled bacon, and some shredded cheese.  I whipped it together in about as much time as it took to prepare the instant mashed potatoes.  It was a hit at the card party and even more so with my husband.

I used a Boboli crust, brushed it with olive oil and spinkled a little garlic powder on it.  I topped this with regular mashed potatoes.  Sauted some onion and added that with the bacon.  I used Monteray Jack cheese on top.  I used a pizza stone that had already heated and broiled it for about 7 minutes.  I thought it was okay, but my SO loved it.  Next time I would not use the olive oil - it made the potatoes hard to spread over the crust.  Also, I'd use a little more cheese.  Will probably make again at my SO's request.

This pizza is a veritable "starch-a-palooza!" I didn't use all the potato called for (about half), and just had to have my tomato sauce (I choose a sweeter variety with red pepper and mushroom). I mixed it into the potatoes and it did look a little funny (like Playdough), but tasted great once I added the toppings. Used Jalapeno Monterey Jack cheese and skipped the bacon, opting for chopped olives, peppers, mushroom and red onion toppings instead. Next time I'll skip the tomato (maybe use it sundried, as a topping, however), and mix some creamed spinach into the potatoes. Our neighborhood Bertucci's pizza place sells their dough but it doesn't come out quite the same. That probably has to do with the heat capabilities of my oven vs. a commercial, wood fired one. I cut a nice, gluteney sourdough bouille in half, trimmed the bottom to make the sides flat, and brushed the top and bottom with olive oil and broiled lightly in the oven; just until slightly browned; then added the toppings as directed and reheated until cheese was melty.

This was sooooo good!!!  I used the Quick and Easy Pizza Crust recipe from this site and cooked the pizza on our grill outside rather than in the oven.  My family loved it!

This is delicious!  I used refrigerated pizza dough, precooked crumbled bacon, a shredded cheese blend and leftover garlic mashed potatoes.  Only thing I didn't use was the sour cream and that's because I don't like it.  This would be a great breakfast/brunch dish!

The first time it was too bland so the second time I made it my way.
I used a store bought pre-baked crust, and layered in this order; mashed potatoes, bacon, sausage, caramelized onions, honey BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese and French fried onions. Perfect for us.

Bought a crust from wegmans pizza shop, sauced it up moderately with honey bbq sauce, whipped up mashed potatoes (used butter potatoes and added a good amount of garlic salt for extra zing), shredded some cheddar, fried the bacon and chopped up a whole sprig of green onion.  Holy smokes....  this was delicious! Would have been bland without the bbq sauce. Will try a hot sauce like Frank's red hot next time and see how that tastes.  A fun summer meal for my 4 teenagers who don't mind carb-loading ~

Excellent, easy and economical!  I added green onions like others suggested and a few jalapenos on one side for my spice loving husband.  My husband and son were not terribly enthused when I brought it to the table, but once they tasted it (the maple bacon bits helped) they thought it was great.

Thanks so much for the good recipe!

This is going to be a new favorite in my house.  The only change is that it needs more cheese.

As my boyfriend doesn't care too much for sour cream, I used normal pizza toppings. It came out very good and I was very pleased.

Made this for the Superbowl.  Everyone loved it.  THe only change I would make is to either use flavored mashed potatoes next time.  Definately had to add salt.
