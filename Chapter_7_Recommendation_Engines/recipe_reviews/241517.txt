Loved it!  So soft, airy and light!  I used only 1 cup of sugar.   I put 1/4 cup in the egg white just before it reached stiff peaks. The other 3/4  in the flour.

Followed many recipes and this was the best!!  Used 1 cup sugar and doubled the salt, topped with chopped macadamia nuts and dark chocolate, made them into cupcakes.  Looking forward to making this again
