My husband didn't even notice it had halloumi untill I pointed it out. I couldn't find its taste from the mix either. For that I think this is just wasting halloumi and we love halloumi too much to waste it.

We loved it! Not fond of mint or tomatoes so I used two tomatoes instead of 4. Instead of mint I used favorite spices. Substituted two cheeses for Colby and Motzerralla that I had on hand.
