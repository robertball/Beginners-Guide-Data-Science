I loved this recipe.  I substituted lemon pepper for the spices and roasted it on a bed of chopped carrots, celery and onion to help add flavor to the  gravy. Awesome!

An fantastic alternative to cooking a whole turkey for Thanksgiving!  Since my family all loves breast meat, I fixed two of these for a family dinner.  Instead of oil, I used butter because it not only gives the meat great flavor but gives the skin that wonderful golden color.  I added chopped onions, carrots, celery, rosemary, sage and garlic cloves to the roasting pan to flavor the juices.  I basted the breasts every 20-30 minutes with the pan juices.  Some of the most tender, best tasting white meat I ever had.  Several people said it had to be dark meat it was so tender and juicy.

My whole family gave this two thumbs up. With a picky husband, a three year old and a one year old, this is no small feat.  I used a foil tent over the turkey for the first 1 1/2, then cooked for an additional hour without (my breast was only six pounds).  Thanks so much!

Delicious, simple and aromatic while cooking! I  used a smaller breast of turkey - it only took about an hour to bake. Then I drizzled some of the drippings over our potatoes and veggies during the last ten minutes of roasting.  Wonderful recipe! My guys love it!!  We'll definately have this dish again!!

This was the most AWESOME turkey we have ever had! It was soooo tender and moist. The seasonings and lemon juice are a great combination! Followed the recipe to the letter except for the most important part...We didn't baste. Instead we cooked it in a roasting bag. WOW! How flavorful even without the basting process! Many thanks to Taste of Home for our new favorite recipe.

We thought this was delicious!  The only thing that I changed was that I cooked it in a bag for 1 1/2-2 hours and didn't baste.  Will definitely make again!

Couldn't be any easier unless you ordered out!  The flavor was good and the meat was moist.  We enjoyed this very much.

AWESOME TURKEY!! My family just loved this turkey. I don't normally make turkey because I don't really care for it, but I thought I'd try a different recipe this time. I was so glad I did. It was so moist, my husband must have told me how moist it was a half a dozen times. My little girl just devoured hers. I couldn't bring myself to "discard skin" as that's my favorite part of turkey, it was yummy. Yes, I know it's fattening as all get out, but it was gooood!!!! Loved this turkey!

With this recipe we had the juiciest white meat ever!  I followed the recipe exactly, although left the bird to sit tented under foil for an hour (not intentionally, just bad timing!:) - and it was wonderful!

This recipe is the best.  I've made it twice now and we love it.  I even put it in the oven and then left for the afternoon so did not baste it at all.  It was tender and wonderful still!  Also, the herbs and garlic in the rub make for a very tasty gravy.  My son said it was the best gravy he has ever had.  Must try.  Definate keeper.  It's the only way I'll prepare a turkey breast now.

I used this basic recipe to grill my bone-in turkey breast.  First I soaked it overnight in a salt+water+sugar brine, then only substituted lemon pepper seasoning for the lemon peel.  I grilled it over indirect heat on my gas grill (with some apple wood chips thrown on occasionally for a little bit of a smoked taste)for about 3 1/2 hours at 350* and it came out PERFECT.  And no heating up my kitchen.  Try it, I promise you won't be disappointed!  Wonderful taste and VERY juicey!

I ditto all the other rave reviews for this recipe.  I made it for Christmas dinner and took it out a bit too early, even after cutting into it and realizing it needed to cook a bit more, with an additional 20 mins cooking time, it was still very moist.  My guests all hovered around my husband as he carved the breast snitching samples and begging me tell them how I got it to be so moist!  This is a tried and true recipe, put this one in your recipe file, it's a keeper!!

Ok.  The overpowering lemon juice flavor ruined it.  I liked the idea of using an herb marinade so if we make it again I'd use less lemon juice & maybe more of the garlic, thyme & sage.

My boyfriend & I cooked this for Thanksgiving yesterday and it was amazing...we thought there wasn't enough juices to baste the bird in, so we poured a can of chicken broth over the bird about 30 minutes into cooking. Yummy and moist and delicious!

Very good.  I have used this recipe before with chicken only difference is the chicken recipe also calls for rosemary.  I think this recipe would have been better with rosemary also.  But all in all a good recipe for turkey.

I liked this recipe but like others have mentioned, It had a large amount of lemon flavor.  Next time, I would use half the amount.  I felt it overpowered the turkey.

This is an excellent recipe.  I made this for my boyfriend and me for Christmas Eve.  The only change I made was to use a turkey breast that was about 2 and a half pounds rather than the monster the recipe calls for.  This is a really great recipe.

The flavor of the spice rub was delicious. I covered mine with a foil tent and did not baste it!  Mine, unlike so many others before me, came out really dry.  I will try this again on Thanksgiving with a bigger turkey.  I had only a single Breast on the bone.  Perhaps that is why it was so dry??  I am all for the flavor of the spices though.  Really great!!!

This was very good. I liked the lemon taste with the turkey. My turkey breast came out undercooked but it could be my old oven.

My poultry usually turns out dry, not this one!  It was juicy and wonderful.  I used the pan drippings to make gravy and it was a huge hit.  My turkey was 5 1/2 lb. and 3 adults only ate half of it.  I plan to make Turkey Pot Pie with the leftovers.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent resume.  The herbs gave the turkey great flavor. I used a cooking bag and it turned out perfectly.

I was looking for something different, so I tried this recipe. It was okay, but the flavor of the garlic, lemon & herbs didn't penetrate the breast & I was left with plain turkey that was a little dry and gravy that tasted like lemon. Sorry, but I think I'll stick with my usual recipe.

This is an excellent turkey breast recipe. I used a boneless breast (3 lb) and it was so tasty. The lemon gives it such a unique flavor and the results are juicy!

I made a sixteen pound "blackened turkey" this weekend and decided to add more flavor by using this recipe. We thought it was lovely and roasted our turkey, breast side down. All of the wonderful juices, which were heading in a southerly direction just ended up enhancing the flavors and actually cutting and mellowing the lemon zest. Super!

Excellent and VERY moist!  My 9 yr old even asked for seconds!  I cut back a bit on the lemon and added a bit more of the herbs and garlic....I will definately use this recipe again...am going to try it using a whole turkey also.

I thought it would be hard to get the seasoning under the skin but this was a very easy recipe! The skin held the moistness and seasoning in but not the extra calories.

Nice selection of seasonings for the turkey....smells great cooking and tastes great too. Omitted the zest (used just the lemon juice) because the kids don't like strong lemon. Will use this for stuffed chicken as well.

I served this on Christmas eve, and it was well received!  The lemon flavor added a nice twist.  The roast was moist and well seasoned.  Thanks for a successful meal!  Sure beats cooking the whole turkey.

I was so excited about this, I'm sorry to say it didn't turn out well.  I used fresh lemon juice and omitted the zest, according to other reviews.  It didn't seem that the herbs or lemon penetrated the meat, and it was a bit dry and tough.  Maybe that was my fault, I'm not sure.  It looked beautiful, was just a shame it didn't turn out well.

I followed this recipe exactly as written with the exeption of brining it in a salt and sugar solution overnite to insure the juiceness.  It was done at two hours with a 5 1/2 pound fresh breast, as that is when the pop up timer told me, and the turkey turned out moist and juicy.  I strained off the fat and used the aus jus on the turkey meat.  The flavor was different and tasty, light and flavorful, but I can't say it is the best I have ever had.

Excellent!  I used 6 fresh sage leaves instead of the dried sage.  I also only used 1 tbls of Olive oil and lemon juice (I omitted the lemon peel).  I mixed it all together and coated the turkey breast in it before cooking in a slow cooker.  It came out great!

The flavors of the lemon combination were very tasty, but the turkey was dry. Maybe I overcooked it. My husband enjoyed it, so that's a plus

I rarely measure, unless I'm baking.  Just add an ingredient in until it looks like a teaspoon, for example.  So I'm not really sure how much lemon peel I added, but it was too much...I used the peel from an entire medium lemon, so next time I'll use about half that.  Regardless, this was so yummy, and it was really pretty easy.  I had gotten a 3 lb., no bone breast; just what I came across.  I used the temperature called for on the turkey packaging, but used the ingredients called for here.  The presentation was lovely, as well.  Nice brown skin, very juicy.  Thanks for the recipe.

MY HUSBAND IS NOT A COOK, BUT --- HE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING NICE FOR ME.  I AM A VERY BUSY WOMEN WITH 7 RETAIL STORES AND HE DECIDED TO CREATE A MEAL TO HELP ME.  WHEN I CALLED HOME TO CHECK IN AT 6PM, HE INFORMED ME THAT HE WAS COOKING THE TURKEY BREAST.  HE TOLD ME THAT HE WAS "FOLLOWING THE RECIPE".  I SAID, "OH, NO, THAT WORRIES ME!!  HE IS VERY PROFICIENT AT THE COMPUTER SO HE WENT ON LINE TO FIND THE PERFECT RECIPE.  I HAVE ALWAYS RELIED ON MY 30 YR OLD BETTY CROCKER FOR THESE THINGS.  WHEN I GOT HOME HE WAS BASTING AND PREPPING THE MEAL.  THANK YOU FOR THE INTERNET POSSIBILITIES.  WE ARE EMPTY NESTERS AND HE HAS LEARNED TO BE A PARTNER IN OUR RELATIONSHIP.

excellent! I omitted sage and lemon zest, but added some chicken broth. It was great! Set aside some chicken broth for basting when the sauce drys. My 5.3 pounds turkey breat takes 2 hours to cook and we did it without a thermometer!
Thanks for the fantastic recipe.

This was one of the best oven-roasted turkeys I've ever had!  I didn't measure the ingredients, and I used poultry seasoning in place of the herbs.  It was delicious, moist, and tasty.  I suppose it was a bit lemony, but we enjoyed it!  Thanks!

We did this for Easter in our convection oven and it turned out fantastic!!  This was my first turkey breast ever, and it made me look like a pro.  We will make again and again.

This is the best turkey that I have had, ever.  I have never looked forward to leftovers so much.  It was very tender and flavorful.  We added some lemon wedges to the bottom of the roasting pan.  Instantly has become a family favorite.

I was looking for a new combination of seasons to cook my turkey with and this worked GREAT. I loved it, although I did have trouble with loosening the skin....anyone have any hints?

Was absolutely delicous!  My boyfriend said it was the best he ever had.  It was also the juiciest turkey breast either of us have had!

This recipe had alot of good reviews so I thought I'd try it but I was disappointed.The sage and thyme together just aren't good at all!!!!! The turkey was juicy but the seasoning was too harsh.I have to say I will not try this one again.

My husband never liked turkey until he tried this recipe!  So simple and delicious - we also use this recipe as a basis for roasting whole chickens.  Use turkey the next day for the Leftover Thanksgiving Casserole!
