This is a great basic one to start with when you don't have a lot on hand, I doctored it up with stuff I scrounged up  in cabinets: started with 2 huge and frozen solid out of freezer bone in pork chops, coated each with onion soup mix, got can of sauerkraut, added a little mustard, threw on some caraway seeds, and put over pork chops.  cut up a couple of apples and put on top, poured bottle of beer over it all and put on low for 8 hours, came out so tender and really yummy, we all loved it.  Probably could have used just a littel more juice but no complaints.  I find a lot of items are so tender but overcooked really in the slow cooker so I am away 10 hours or more.  So find using frozen meats elimiated need to thaw and prevents the complete disintegration of the meat when you cut it.  Was still extremely tender and bone just fell out - will definately make again!!

I really enjoyed this recipe; however I did add quite a few other ingredients. The extra ingredients are many of the flavors in a Polish stew recipe that uses sauerkraut and pork (Bigos Stew). I first seasoned the pork chops with seasoned salt and garlic powder. Then I browned the pork chops for approx. 2-3 min. on each side. The additional ingredients added to the crock pot were diced tomatoes, onion, 4 cloves of roasted garlic, 2 slices of chopped bacon, 1 tsp of marjoram and caraway seeds, and a tablespoon of brown sugar.

I took some of the suggestions given in the reviews.  I haven’t tried the original recipe posted, but because of the result, I’m giving 5 stars.  I browned and seasoned the chops with a homemade seasoning given to me by my uncle and I also added chicken broth, a sliced onion, and added 2 sliced and peeled apples that I had on hand.  I also sprinkled some brown sugar on top….It was amazing! My husband often teases me that I over cook pork chops and he just raved and raved about how good this dinner was.  It made my day, especially since my husband is often right (I do tend to over cook pork chops)!  This recipe and the feedback regarding the recipe were very helpful.   The meat was so tender and the taste was fantastic.  My girls don’t tend to like sauerkraut – but even though it was main part of the recipe they even gave it 5 stars!  I cooked this on high for 4 hours and low for 2 hours.  Thanks! Mari Beth

This recipe has good bones, however, it's also crying out for a little help. I seasoned my chops and seared them before placing them in the cooker. As I would whenever I make sauerkraut, I fried up some bacon until crisp, added chopped onion and a sweet apple. A tablespoon of caraway seeds was also added to help make what turned out to be a really good dish. Thanks for a good start Kathy!

Very good, very easy, and very tasty!  The pork chops were falling off the bone when I pulled them out of the cooker - very tender!  The only addition I made was about 1/4 cup of brown sugar, and it tasted great!  I never would have believed you could cook pork chops in a slow cooker, let alone have them turn out so good!  -Allison

I used 1/2 cup of apple cider, 3/4 cup of thinly sliced onions, two cloves of garlic and 1 tsp pepper.  I cooked on high for 4 hours and on low for two hours.  I served with apple sauce, mashed patotes, and corn bread.  This is by far the BEST meal that I have made to date! Keep in mind that I'm a rookie cook but I REALLY REALLY did enjoy this easy meal and will make many more times. My wife thought it was really good as well.

I seasoned the pork chops with salt and pepper and then browned them before putting them in the crockpot. I made red potatoes with this, it was delicious! Thanks for posting this easy recipe.

Tried this today and it came out great. Added apple, and brown sugar as per the other reviews - the apple flavors blended nicely with sauerkraut. Cooked on high for 4 and a half hours. Will definitely make again. A keeper.

Here I am rating my own recipe.  That's because I wanted to be sure that anyone using it knows that it works perfectly well for pork ROAST as well as chops.  It's just a yummy and easy way to do pork.  A little mashed potatoes on the side and you have dinner - especially for lucky New Year's Day!  (add some black-eyed peas if you live in the south).

Since others gave this good reviews, I can only assume I did something wrong (hard though when there's only 2 ingredients) because mine were horrible. I started with 4 semi-frozen chops since someone mentioned the frozen ones end up more tender, and the kraut. It didn't seem like there was enough liquid, so I added less than 1/2 cup apple juice. Sprinkled caraway seeds over top. Set the cooker to low (8hrs). I could tell that after FOUR hours, it was done, but it was only 2pm and we don't have dinner until 6. I put the cooker on WARM setting and let it sit. I ended up with chops that were SO dry that we couldn't eat them. My husband couldn't stand the smell when he got home that he refused to even try a bite. I tried it, but like I said, it was SO dry. Probably won't try this one again.

I wasn't expecting too much from this recipe.  I was afraid the kraut would over power it.  I like kraut, but hubby doesn't not share my enthusiasm.  But hubby loved it so much he had third helpings!  I also sauted some onions and added it to it, but only because I was afraid it wasn't going to be very good.  The onions were a nice bonus, but defintely not essential.  I will definitely make this again, it was so easy!!  I served it with Dilled Creamy Potatoes (also from this site), and it was a great compliment to the pork.

UPDATE:  I made this again, and as others have mentioned, it turned out very dry.  I think you need to be wary on the cut of chop you get, something too lean will dry out.

Yum! I did a little bit of doctoring, but this is a solid base. Seasoned the chops with salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder. Seared them and then threw in the slow cooker. Added a bit of caraway seed and brown sugar over top of the sauerkraut and poured in about 1/2 cup of light beer. Yummy served with mashed potatoes and green veggies. Thanks :)

i read the reviews and took what i thought to be the best from them and doctored my recipe up a little.  
3 cups chicken broth 
1/4 cup brown sugar 
1 cup diced bell pepper 
1 bag of frozen pearl onions 
3 granny smith apples cored & sliced 
4 bone in center loin chops (browned) 
32 oz sauerkraut with the juice.    

Put it all in the pot... (onions on top)and cooked on high for 4 1/2 hours, low for 2... and the meat just fell apart.  My man LOVED it and went back for seconds.  He's not a leftovers guy and he MADE me keep this for later :)

Great recipe. I was so easy I almost felt guilty. I browned my chops before I put them in the crock and added more sauerkraut because I have two teenage boys with big appetites. Because this recipe was so easy I had time to throw together before I left for work in the morning and had a great meal ready and waiting when everyone got home from school and work.

Excellent! Delicious and juicy with tang and pizzazz. I absolutely loved this. But here's what i added: one appled cored and sliced and about 1/3 C of brown sugar. Wonderful recipe! With 2 pork chops it only took 3 hours to slow cook on high.

This resipe came out wonderfully. I read through the reviews and pulled together different parts with the ingredients I had. I didn't use 16 oz of sauerkraut because I didn't have it. I used a much smaller portion. I used regular onions instead of pearl. I used only one apple to line the bottom of the slow cooker, among other things. My husband said they were the tenderest pork chops he'd ever had. They were really good.

This was so easy and delicious. My family had it all gone as soon as it was ready to eat. I did add a little brown sugar to make it less sour, but other than that I stuck to this recipe, and loved it!

I followed other reviewer's advice and added brown sugar, salt and pepper, chicken broth, and some minced garlic.  My chops were frozen when I put them in.  I cooked on low for about 6 hours.  I also used boneless pork chops.  This turned out good!  Served it over mashed potatoes.  I may have to try it sometime just as the recipe states.  I was nervous because of all the bad reviews.  We were happy with the results!

After reading the reviews, I also added an apple, brown sugar and an onion. Since I was using leftover sauerkraut there wasn't that enough sauerkraut juice so I added beer. It worked out very well. I may add some carraway seeds next time.

Easy, but oh so much better when you sprinkle the pork chops with some fresh garlic and salt and pepper and then brown in olive oil first. Also, if you put the pork chops on top of the saurkraut they don't get drowned in all that juice and their flavor goes through the saurkraut.

I used 6 boneless chops, sprinkled with smoked salt and browned in butter before putting in crockpot.  Poured the sauerkraut over them and quartered some new potatoes and added.  Poured one bottle of beer over everything... turned out awesome and tender.  The kraut mellows out in taste, will make this again.

This was amazingly good for how simple the recipe is.  I was skeptical about not adding any additional seasonings, but I stuck with the recipe (mostly because I didn't have anything else like apples or caraway seeds that other recipes call for) and I was pleasantly surprised! The pork chops were tender and flavorful, and the sauerkraut was somewhat mellowed, but savory, complex, and tasty.  The only thing I did differently was to brown the pork chops before adding them to the slow cooker, but that was mostly for looks.  Great recipe and so easy!

Who'd think something this simple would be so good?  I put 4 boneless pork shoulder chops in the slow cooker with a can of sauerkraut, sprinkled with some pepper and let it go 8 hrs.  The meat was so tender and flavorful, both my husband and I enjoyed it very much and I will make it again!

Yikes, I was surprised how badly this turned out after reading the reviews.  Definately one of the worst recipes I have made from this site and I have made a lot!  Very bland and 9 hours on low was way too long, chops were very dry.

This was so easy and so yummy!  I used 6 boneless chops & 2 large cans of sauerkraut.  I cooked it for about 9 hours on low and it literally fell apart.  Awesome!  Thanks, Kathy!

Love this recipe...so easy and so flexible. I was searching for a slow cooker pork recipe that wasn't centered around over-saucing & over-seasoning with BBQ sauce or Mexi flavor. This is it!
We cooked 2 chops for 4 hours with the kraut, mustard seeds, chopped onion, garlic, and peppercorns.
My husbad is the cook of the house, but I try to take my turn...this was a pick that seemed easy to me. He was skeptical as to how good it would be.
When we were ready to eat, the chops were deliciously fall-off-the bone good.
Next time I would do at least 4 chops...we were each left wanting more. Neither of us loved the kraut as a side. I think I will throw in some carrots half-way through next time.
Also, all garlic fans should half a handful of cloves and toss them in this pot. They end up very delicious.

Thanks for the idea!

I also seasoned and browned my chops first, then I layered sliced potatoes and the onions at the bottom of the crockpot, added the chops and a 32 oz. jar of a good quality Bavrian sauerkraut. I poured the chicken broth over all, and after 8 hours on low setting, we had the besr, most tender pork chops ever!I did add the bacon at the end but no caraway seeds or apple.I found I had to stir once in awhile, as the sauerkraut on top was getting a bit dry. We will absolutely be keeping this recipe, and thanks, Erika.

A recipe doesn't get any simpler.  Amazing what the sauerkraut juice can do the the flavor of pork.  My kids said" Mommy, this meat is really good."  My husband, who likes German food, flipped over the fact that I served sauerkraut.  Everyone was happy, especially me when I found that cleaning the slow cooker was a snap.

Been doing this for years.  It's a very easy recipe and you can add multiple ingredients for additional flavors.  I've always used a bone-in pork roast instead of chops.  Make sure you trim the excess fat.

My family loved this recipe, even though they are picky eaters.  I wasn't sure about this recipe but, I followed the suggestions of others and added a little extra and loved it!!!  I added onion, beef bullion, worshire sauce, apples, beer, a small can of tomato sauce, and caraway seed (a little bit).  I started with 10 frozen, boneless pork chops and it was wonderful

This was great - so easy and homey.  My husband went crazy for it!  I think I added a little extra brown sugar, just for good measure : >  I also used frozen pork chops to help with the moisture - cooked them for close to 10-11 hours.

This is my new favorite way to cook pork chops (as long as I have the time). I season the chops with salt, pepper and garlic powder. I'm rather fond of sauerkraut, so I use two 14.5 oz cans. After 8 hours on low in my slow cooker, the chops are 'fall apart tender'. I like to serve this with the Ultra Creamy Mashed Potatoes recipe also from this site.

Good basic ingredients.  I have a large slow cooker and we like to get more than one meal from a recipe.  So I used 8 pork chops, a large (64 ounce) jar of sauerkraut from Costco, one onion(thinly sliced), and one Granny Smith apple, chopped.  I seasoned and browned the pork chops first, then layered 4 chops, half the kraut, remaining four chops, then remaining kraut.  Next time I will add caraway seeds to each sauerkraut layer as I do think that's a great addition.

Excellent recipe - I have noticed however if I use the pork chops with the bones it does seem to come out a little more tender than the boneless.  I added salt, pepper & garlic as suggested by other readers. A keeper in my favorites!

Thank You Kathy for this recipe. It was exactly what I wanted - just a basic slow cooker recipe.
I also appreciate all of the other reviewers with their suggestions. THANKS ALL!

I cannot rate because I didn't make it, but I think it would help to also include what size slow cooker to use. I read the reviews and no one said what size they used. I think the size of the slow cooker is the most important part of the ingredients. I think I will surely use this recipe, sounds good and easy.

1. browned chops and de-glazed with beer.  2. seasoned with salt and pepper 3. added one medium sized onion (sliced) 4. added 8 oz sliced mushrooms 5. added remaining beer (used New Castle dark beer)  review: my husband said it was the best pork recipe we have cooked to date. He was ready to eat it all! The pork came out very tender and juicy. As for me, I don't like sauerkraut nor the smell of it - it definitely smelled like it throughout the house. I did taste the pork and it was good.  We will be making this again, for him.

I browned the chops on the bbq for a few minutes before adding to the slow cooker.  I also added 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  The chops were very tender and tasty.  Definitely a keeper.

I tried the basic recipe, and it came out really well, everyone liked it. I will try other user-suggested additions later, but the base recipe is a really nice, simple way to cook pork chops.

I added Apples, Apple Joice, and onions and used boneless pork chops.  It was okay - but a little too sweet.  Next time, maybe I'll skip apple juice and use beer.

I thought I would really like this, but it made the house smell bad for several days, and I found it only edible.  I couldn't have done anything wrong with two ingredients!  Too bad, I love two to three ingredient recipes.

Simple and flavorful. My husband rated a 10 The next time I make these, I will use thinner pork chop so that they are really tender. Thanks for a wonderful dish that is perfect just as stated.

I give this a 3, my husband gives it a 5 which is funny since he usually doesn't care for sauerkraut.  I happen to love sauerkraut and I was disappointed that it's flavor mellowed so much in this recipe.  The meat was super super tender.  If I make it again I would NOT use bone in chops again because we kept find small pieces of bone.

I didn't believe it would be so good -- just chops and kraut?  I am a believer now -- will become a stacked up-backed-up Friday nite fave at our house.  My husband added some paprika just before it was done.  I suggested a couple of minced garlic cloves.  Other than that, "wicked good, " just the way it is!

My father was a child during the depression.  This was something his mother made for her boys.  Just as is - no tweaking.  No apples, caraway seed, onions, bacon or tomatoes.  He wouldn't eat it if it wasn't the way his mother made it.  His palate couldn't or wouldn't adapt.  She did have baking powder dumplings simmering on the top.  It was served to him over boiled potatoes, peeled and cut into bite-size pieces.  I could enjoy any of the other versions but this is the one I grew up with and it will always have a special place in my heart.  Good food doesn't have to get complicated.  It reminds me of my dad.

I have been naking this for years with a few little additions-as all say this is a great basic recipe-I brown my BONELESS pork chops-this way you don't have pesky pieces of bones in it-with flour, s&p first. Then I layer with sauerkraut, applesauce, pork chops, garlic minced and caraway seeds-God Bless my deceased mother in law from years ago-she made this when crock pots were a glimmer in scientists eyes-Thanks Dot!

i typically don't give such a low star score but this recipe was nothing special- or good for that matter, whatsoever. Maybe I am giving it 2 stars because i eat sauerkraut often in various dishes so for someone who has had many amazing dishes with sauerkraut, this is super bland. i actually threw out the entire meal, im really surprised because it received such a great rating so i was excited to try it.

Good easy recipe. After reading the reviews, I decided to add an apple and a slice onion to it. I added brown sugar. My husband loved it, but my son didn't care for it. I thought it was pretty good and I'm not a fan of sauerkraut.

So easy for when you need to put dinner on in the morning before a busy day.  I add sliced bell peppers and onions sometimes as well.  Tender chops every time.

It's fair to say that I've never made an easier recipe, but that's the best part of this. Otherwise, it's a little lackluster. Pair with mashed potatoes or veggies for a good meal!

Okay, maybe sauerkraut just doesn't work for me.  On the plus side, it was easy, the chops were moist (not dried out) - but I ended up scrapping the kraut off and making a baked potato which I chopped up the meat and put it in with the potato, it worked.  However, I won't be making this meal again.

Delicious.  I modified the recipe per some of the other comments adding onions, brown sugar and spices.  Cooked frozen chops on high for 4 hours and low for 2.  These turned out juicy and wonderful.  Will definitely make again.

Simple and great! I used pork steaks and lay them on their sides. I also added large apple pieces, a little apple juice and dried mustard. They were delicious and a big hit.

This recipe is super simple. I usually bake my Pork chops and sauerkraut but wanted to try it in the slow cooker. Worked perfectly. I layered sauerkraut, chops, sauerkraut, chops so that the would get plenty of flavor. Will make again. Thanks.

Sadly, I must say this is the worst recipe I've tried from this site. (And I LOVE this site!!) I needed to use up a big bag of sauerkraut, so I followed others' suggestions (added some cubed potatoes, chopped onions and seasoned/browned the 4 thick, boneless chops before adding to the crock pot), but the end result was VERY bland. :( Hopefully, I can make some sort of soup from the leftovers tomorrow. This is the first "clanker" I've encountered on this site, but I'll never make this recipe again. :(

This recipe is even better when you add a sliced onion and 3 or 4 peeled and chopped apples to the bottom of the cooker.

This was phenomenal and fantastically simple.  Only change I made was to add a can of chicken broth and small amount of real bacon bits on top while it cooked after flavoring the chops first.  Cooked 3 nice sized chops on high for 3 & 1/2 hours.  The meat fell off the bones.  Delicious!

Amazing meal!  I also added some chicken broth, brown sugar, and garlic and it turned out wonderful.  Cooked on low for 8 hours and the pork just fell apart.

OK.  Potatoes & onions in the bottom of the crock was a good idea.  I added vegetable stock, because the kraut didn't have much liquid.  I also added a chopped Granny Smith apple, that my DH didn't care for at all.  The kraut lost it's flavor.  Chops were tender.

As written, this recipe is a good starting point.  I spiced it up by following other reviewers suggestions.  Sprinkled chops with salt, pepper, and garlic powder and seared for 2 minute per side in a hot skillet.  Transferred chops to the slow cooker, poured 32 oz of sauerkraut (the hubs has a big appetite) on top, and sprinkled with 1/4 cup brown sugar and caraway seeds.  The end result was absolutely delicious and it is such a simple recipe.  Definitely a keeper!

Tried this today.  Put it on before church and was perfect when we got home.  It was wonderful and will diffiently cook again.  We seared the pork chops, and used pork loin chops (thick cut)and poured a beer in.  The chops were tender, falling apart, but very juicy.  Will make a larger recipe next time though.  Not much left.  Thanks for sharing.

I give it five stars for simplicity. To make it even more delicious, mix 6 slices cooked, crumpled bacon and 2 tablespoons brown sugar to the saurkraut at end of cooking. Then it's a five star in taste too. Yum!

I was amazed at how delicious this turned out, for it to be so simple.  My husband refused to eat it so I took the leftovers and added mushrooms and pork gravy and it was so yummy for my lunch at work.  Cheap meal too!

The only reason this is not 5 stars is the potatoes, for some reason even though I cooked an extra hour they did not cook fully and even those that did were kind of blah.  I modified slightly as we all do for tastes since we like a little more tang.  I used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup and added a little oregano and basil with a dash of hot paprika.  Chops were seasoned slightly with cajun spice on one side.   When all was done the kids were dipping bread into the gravy and eating it.  This is definitely an awesome dinner to come home too.  Mr. Mom for 3 weeks makes me a slow-cooking dynamo, so trust me on this.

This recipe was ok. I took others' suggestions and salt and peppered the pork chops, browned them, added apples, onions and brown sugar. It was ok and I may possibly make this again but def not one of my weekly meals.

My pork chops turned out very dry.  Due to my work schedule they were in the cooker 10 hours, which may have been the problem, but I typically don't have dry meat with other recipes I've tried.  The dish wasn't very appealing to the family.

I have made this a few times when I'm feeling lazy, and do not want to go grocery shopping. It's good, but not something I would crave or serve to someone I was trying to impress. I usually just add some peppercorns to it.

Just the right amount of hot. I did sub bbq sauce for the ketchup (hubby and I are not ketchup fans), only used 1/4 cup packed brown sugar, used red wine vinegar and added 1 tsp of jarred minced garlic. Thanks for the recipe Suzanne!

Wow. Easy and tasty. I added an apple, quartered, and half a green pepper as well as about a cup of chicken broth because my can of kraut didn't look very 'juicy'. Like another reviewer, I am not a saurkraut fan, but my husband is. HE LOVED IT and I will definitely make it again. For saurkraut, this is the best ever!!! Thanks for sharing.

I followed the recipe exactly.  This is probably the simplest recipe on earth, but I feel it is probably lacking some ingredients.  If I make this again I will definately follow some of the other suggestions to maybe give it some more flavour.  I used boneless pork chops.  Next time I will use bone-in pork chops I think.

Easy, convenient and the pork chops are so tender they just fall off the bone. We loved it!

I layered the bottom of this dish with sliced potatoes and onions before adding the pork chops and sauerkraut.  I even added chicken broth to cover the meat.  After cooking on low heat for approx. 7 hours the potatoes were still not cooked and the meat was extremely dry.  I begged my husband to just stop eating it.  We ended up with a very delicious PB&J instead.  Please don't waste your time or money on this one.

I used one 32 oz jar of Vlasic Brand sauerkraut and 5 bone-in pork loin chops. This turned out wonderfully! There was more than enough juice in the jar to cover the chops completely and the result was moist,tender pork chops and steamy sauerkraut. I will absolutely be making this again! thanks for an easy, delicious recipe.

Sorry but this was a very bad recipe.  My husband said it was very dry and tasteles (and he loves sauerkraut which is why I chose to try this). Either the cooking time is too long and/or there is not enough liquid in the recipe. I don't understand how it could have rated so many stars?

Really good idea, but a little bland. I tried it with both pork chops and chicken and I think the chicken is a better match.

This recipe is awesome.  I always keep a can of sauerkraut in the cabinet because I can throw this together on a day when I don't feel like doing much.  Very good taste and the chops come out tender.  EXCELLENT!

Thanks!

This was the easiest thing ever!  I used pork loin with no bone, cooked it for 8 hours in my crockpot.  It dried around the edge of the pot only. The food was great, the pork was tender, and the saurkraut had all of its wonderful flavor!

I was really pleased with this recipe. I made a couple changes. I seared the chops on both sides before putting them in the crock pot. And I threw in some chopped celery and onions. It turned out great. I'm giving this 5 stars because my boyfriend, whose mother has been making pork and sauerkraut for him his whole life, thought this was fantastic. Thanks for the recipe!

Really, for the ease involved in making this, and the sensational taste, this meal has earned all five stars.  I cooked on high for 4 hours; this was a bit too long, and although the flavor was great, the texture was a bit too "canned meat".  I will make again and either cook on low for 4 hours or on high for only 2.5 - 3 hours.

This was great.  We added a can of diced tomatoes, 3 tsps of minced garlic, a pinch of onion powder, and 1/3 cup balsamic vinegar.  Cooked on low for 8 hours and it was very tender and had a great flavor.

This was easy to do but very, very bland.  I had spiced it up by adding Old Bay to the flour dredge, a pound of fresh mushrooms and a lot of garlic and it still came out flavorless.  The meat was fall off the bone tender, though.  I don't think I would make it again without nearly rewriting the recipe from scratch.  My son liked it over egg noodles but he would eat nearly anything over egg noodles.

Not bad. I added an apple to it and it cut down on the sharpness of the sauerkraut.  Very easy to make and tasty.

This is a hard one to rate. I would've just given it 2.5 if I could but the site doesn't let you. First problem was, sauerkraut is sour. Period. Sauerkraut has been a staple in my life since I started eating solid food...lol...so I knew throwing plain sauerkraut in the crock would not go well. Called mom...told me to add a little less than 2 Tablespoons sugar and mix in a bit of caraway. It didn't look like enough liquid but my mom assured me the sauerkraut would eek out liquid as it cooked. Done. I read all the reviews and decided to follow the advise of adding in potatoes (I added a small--two bite--variety called "Honey Gold") and bacon. I put in my pork chops, sauerkraut mixed with potatoes, and layered bacon over the top. After cooking for close to the recommended time, I discarded the bacon (way overcooked to serve with the recipe), and tested doneness of everything. (My mom was right on the sauerkraut adding enough juice to the recipe.) The potatoes were perfect, as was the sauerkraut...SO yummy! When I tried pulling out a chunk of pork to test though...it just fell apart. I could hardly get any substantial pieces out and what I did was SO INCREDIBLY DRY,The pork tasted *ok* I guess...but it was a complete disaster bc it was over-cooked. We didn't want to waste it. However, we obviously didn't want to eat the pork, and it was almost impossible to scoop out spoonfuls without shreds of the pork with it. Next time this will be with a roast.

I make slow-cooker pork chops and sauerkraut fairly frequently, and my recipe is like Kathy's original except with the addition of a little beef broth. After reading some of the other reviews, I added a few things to last night's version: dusted the chops on both sides with hubby's "magic dust" for grilled steaks, sprinkled the sauerkraut with a little brown sugar and added two Macoun apples, cored and sliced but not peeled. I came in from raking leaves and it smelled as much like autumn inside as it did outside. Delish.

THis was really good!  The only thing I did differently from the recipe was to sprinkle the pork chops with garlic salt and black pepper.  Otherwise, I followed it.  It cooked for 11.5 hours.  It was wonderful.  Thanks!

I followed a couple of the user suggestions and threw in some apples and bacon.  I also tossed in a couple bay leaves and some allspice.  On the whole it was pretty good, but it doesn't really stand alone.

I have made this for years but I use thick pork ribs or a roast, I add potato's and onions. I season the ribs with garlic powder, salt and pepper and brown them before I put them in the slow cooker with the potato's onion and kraut. My x mother in law used to rinse the kraut but I like the flavor better unrinsed. I make macaroni and put everything on top and mix. GREAT STUFF

A good beginning but a chopped apple, thinly sliced onion and some caraway seeds really add to it. The apple and onion help make it easier on the tummy (less gas). Also, I use a pork roast and I brown it first. Serve with mashed potatoes and pumpernickle bread. Even better reheated the next day.

Amazingly easy!!  The chops were so tender it was hard getting them out of the pot.  I was skeptical because I don't like sauerkraut much but I ate every bit of it.

I am a fan of sauerkraut but this recipe just didn't do it for me.  Everything crumbled together and stuck to the sides.  The kraut overpowered our very dry chops. Overall a 2 for ease of preparing this meal.  We will not be making this in our home anytime soon.

FABULOUS!  It is as easy as it sounds.  Since the meat becomes so tender, I recommendation using boneless chops.  Otherwise, you end up with a nasty looking serving plate of bones sitting on the table.

Easy and delicious! I usually sear boneless pork chops first.   I prefer a less sour sauerkraut so I like to rinse the sauerkraut then add 1/4 c (or so) of water with TBS (or so) of brown sugar, and some caraway seeds.  The slow cooking really makes the pork, as well as the sauerkraut,  so tender.  A few slces of crumbled up cooked bacon also adds to the flavor (in case you have any leftover from breakfast )

this is the base of a recipe my polish landlady makes for me from time to time. she usually uses kielbasa type sausage rather than pork chops. I like the idea of the pork chops as it reduces the salt. here is how I revised this dish. I added half a cup of water, half a cup of low-sodium broth, cook bacon pieces with onion. I used a small pork loin, combine the sauerkraut bacon and onion water and broth over the roast and slow cooked in my hot pot. I did braised the roast on all sides in the bacon and onion drippings. turned out perfect and not too salty. Thanks for sharing.

I made this as written and it was very good!  My only problem was my crock pot.  It overcooks everything, so even though I lessened the cook time, my pork chops came out a bit dry.

I'll definitely make it again!

I wonder sometimes about the level of some recipe owners’ palates. I made this & naively thought that somehow the pork would deliver the flavor to this dish. All I got was a briny sauerkraut and yucky porky pig flavor. I hated it. I have a 
Lot leftover & am wondering if I added some caraway seeds and perhaps added some crunchy bread & butter pickles to it maybe it would improve.  But I’m not optimistic. Hmmm :/

It's a basic recipe that my grandmother taught me growing up. I added La Flor Adobo Con Sazon, and 2-3 Tbsp of Kikkoman Teriyaki/Marinade Sauce to give it a kick of flavor. I also added 3 Tbsp of water so that it wouldn't dry out. I used the low setting for 6 hours and it was falling apart. If you want variety, you can add green peppers and/or onions. This recipe is great if you don't have a lot of ingredients on hand.

This was amazing! My husband said it was by far the best thing I've made. I did sear the chops 5 min on each side and seasoned them with garlic salt, dried onion, and black pepper. Then I added 1/4 cup brown sugar to the sauerkraut along with a little more water. My chops were thin so I only had to cook them on low for around 4 hours.  Thank you for sharing this recipe! Will definitely make this again!!

This recipe sounded good and smelled good cooking. Came out awful. Pork was dry and sauerkraut was no longer sauerkraut. Tasted like old soggy cabbage. Had to get take-out!

This Recipe was easy. I sliced several onions and stack them on top of iand beneath the pork chops. This gave another dimension of flavor. I also drained the sauerkraut very well as this recipe becomes very watery, very quickly.

This recipe is awesome!! I looked at the reviews and tweeked it a little bit. I seasoned the pork chops with onion powder, garlic, pepper and soul seasoning. I seared them in one tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil in a skillet on top of the stove before putting them in the crock pot. Next, I layered sliced onion and sliced apple. I put the sauerkraut in a bowl and stirred in 1/4 cup of light brown sugar and 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar for the last layer. I cooked it on high for 4 hours. The chops were so tender that they fell off of the bone and the sauerkraut was to die for! Mashed potatoes and green beans for sides. It was a big hit with my bunch and I will definitely be making this again!

This is a great starter recipe. Pork comes out very tender. Recipe as is turns out very bland. I added shredded carrots, thinly sliced onion, a handful of thinly sliced mushroom, mustard powder, celery seed, black pepper and brown sugar. Served with homemade potato dumplings. Delish!

Loved it!  I started with four frozen pork cutlets, poured a 25 ounce jar of Bubbies brand sauerkraut on top.  Set the cooker on low and went to work.  I didn't get home as soon as I thought I would that day so after 9 hours the cutlets were a little more on the dry side then I would have liked but what can I say.  This is an excellent filler-upper.  No extra salt, seasoning or searing needed for me.

You can also adapt this to using with a pork butt.  Cut roast into large chunks and add additional sauerkraut as per size of roast.  This is a very good recipe

Very good and easy dish. I added marjoram and carraway seed.  The pork could have more flavor but goes so well with sauerkraut. I added carrots and Red new potatoes which made it a well rounded meal!

I really liked this recipe.  It seemed a little odd at first but so easy I just had to try it.  I may have cooked it to long so the chops were a little dry but really not so bad.  Next time for sure I will add apples and maybe a little brown suger.  I am from Milwaukee and it sure was a little tast of home.
