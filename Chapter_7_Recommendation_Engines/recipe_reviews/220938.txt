This cake was originally introduced by the DH company when they came out with the lemon cake mix.   My mother was working in a grocery store at the time and the rep was handing out recipes.   We tried them all, but THIS ONE was the keeper!!

We make it in a bundt pan.   Add the eggs one at a time, beating for 2 minutes after each egg. (adds more air for a fluffier cake)  .  Bake for about 1 hr.  check frequently....cool for 10 min, then plate it out...poke holes in cake top and sides, using a skewer.   Mix 1 cup sifted confectioners sugar with enough lemon juice to make it a VERY thin glaze.  Pour over warm cake and cover.    great the next day.....This cake is very moist and I think, my favorite cake of all time.....so easy and so impressive looking.   You can't see the glaze, but it has soaked into EVERY morsel of the cake.  Great!!

My Mom made this recipe for years, but she baked her cake in a Bundt pan. It's easy to make and very moist and delicious. I've been wanting to make it for a long time, but can't find the apricot nectar Mom used. It was in a small can (DelMonte?), and very thick. I found another brand in the Spanish foods section, but it's not quite like the one Mom used. The cake was still good, though.

Thanks, crimsontide, for posting this one. It brings back many happy memories.

An old friend made this cake for me years ago. I had planned a "theme"dinner. I enjoyed gourmet cooking and had planned an elegant dessert. My friend insisted on bringing dessert. I didn't want to hurt her feelings so I scraped my dessert plan. When her family arrived she handed me a plain yellow cake in a 9X13 in. pan. She assured me that in spite of the fact it was plain it was very good. I served it and was astounded at at the flavor. My friend has passed away and my family has talked about her cake for years. I followed this recipe using 1/2 cup oil. While it was very close to my friends recipe and it was very good, but it was a little dryer. I easily identified the difference, it was the oil. I am making it again today. I may try 2/3 cup oil. Hoping for a 5 star result. I learned a lot from my friend. She was a wonderful cook. This would have been a 5 star recipe except I was comparing it to what we call "Evelyn's Cake's."

It was moist and fluffy, but the taste was not to my taste. Way to lemon-y for me, I could not really taste the apricot. I would also skip the icing, which was overpowering.
