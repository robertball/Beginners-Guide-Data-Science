I have been making these for years. I've done alot of catering in the past. An easy trick for these potatoes is to cut in half raw. Scoop out the potato. Salt water and boil the skins. Red potatos are very easy to scoop out raw. Cook the scooped out potato as you would mashed potates. and proceed with receipe. saves time and aggrevation of skins breaking.

I cooked my potatoes in the micowave for abcou 5 minues. Cut the edges, so they could stand on their own without rolling. I used a paring knife to cut out the middle since I don't have a melon ball scoop. I used my processor to mix butter, cream cheese, salt, pepper, onion powder, & parsley to my taste. I coated the skins with olive oil to get them crisp and baked for 15 minutes. They were spectacular! Thanks for the idea

I tasted the filling before stuffing the little potatoes and thought it needed something so I added some garlic powder and melted butter.  I thought it was better with these additions, more calories, but I never skimp on calories when I am feeding guests.

I made these for the Super Bowl and they were absolutely wonderful!!  Apparently our small red potatoes were larger than Maddiecat's as it only took 10 to make 1 1/2 lbs.  I just boiled them for about 16 minutes until firm but tender.  I also didn't have chives so I grated in about 1 tsp of onion.  The result was outstanding.  I do think they are too rich to be used as a side dish as recommended by the first review, but they are a real winner as an appetizer.

I make a similar recipe and it says to place potatoes in a small bowl and drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil.  You can sprinkle with 1 Tablespoon kosher salt.  Toss to coat and place on a baking sheet.  Bake at 350 degrees for 40-45 minutes or until tender.  Remove from oven and let cool 15 minutes.  Cut each potato in half lengthwise.  Scoop out potatoes with a 1/4 teaspoon measuring spoon leaving shells intact.  Place back on baking sheet and bake 10 more minutes.  Let cool and fill with filling. The 1/4 teaspoon measuring spoon works really well.

These potatoes are so wonderful.  They are great as a main dish potato with steak instead of a baked potato.  What a great change.  Use different types of cheese for a change of pace.  Great recipe

Although these are basically the same as any "Twice baked potato", they're absolutely adorable and are a perfect little appetizer for any party. Guys love spuds, so give it a try when the "muscles" come walking in. (We gals loved 'em too) Thanks Maddie!

I first made these for a friends baby shower and they were a big hit!!!! I'm in the process of making them for our Christmas Day luncheon. Every recipe should be taken as a base to be adjusted by you... I slice the potatoes, place in salted boiling water turn the heat off after 5 mins and let potates sit in the water until tender yet firm. Drain the water w/o removing the potatoes from the pot; run cold water in the pot to speed the cooling. Drizzle with olive oil and sea salt before using a melon baller. I added lots of garlic, butter and use Sharp Cheddar. Oh my they are GREAT!!!

These are pretty labor intensive for a side dish.  If I want a twice baked red potato, I'll just make a big one.  However, I do see value in these as a passed party appy, served chilled!  I will make them for parties, but won't put all the "work" into making mini (basically) twice bakeds.  I tried to pipe the filling w/a pastry bag, but the potatoes were too chunky to fit through the tip.  I cut the bottom off as well so they "set" better on the plates.

I have been making these for a long time. I cut the small red bliss potatoes in half and scoop out the center with the small size melon baller while the potato is still raw. Place the potatoes in a steamer basket and steam them in a pot of water til cooked through. Let cool and fill with your cheese mixture and bake when read to serve....the skins do not break if you scoop the potato raw. Also, I use Asiago cheese...good luck.

Very tasty, but super tedious and time consuming.  Wouldn't attempt without a mellon baller, it came in super handy.  Added some cream cheese to the mix.

The hit of the potluck!  As suggested by anther user, I used a whole bag of pre-cooked bacon crumbles.  A great recipe.

This recipe is not as good as twice-baked potatoes and requires more work. The red potatoes are difficult to scoop out without breaking skin. Probably will not make again.

I was planning on making these for a party.  I have made twice baked potatoes before, and these were so hard to scoop out!  The skin kept falling off.  These may be good, but I won't make them again because nothing tastes good enough for the frustration that I experienced.

I had a hecka time trying to get the potato out of the inside.  They were flimsy and kept falling apart.  I ended up mashing the whole things, adding butter along with all the other ingredients and baking it.

One easy trick I'd like to share for making these is to cut a small slice off the bottom off two ends of the potao before havling them so the round has a little "flat" on the bottom to keep the potato from rolling around.  Very good recipe.  Great for rounding out party sized "bites" menu.  Great for BBQs or a Super Bowl party too. The recipe could use a little more onion flavor in the form of garlic, green onion or a lot more chives.   Still pretty tasty as written.

Brought to pot luck last night.  Came back with empty plate.  Cooked in oven more like 30 min to brown the cheese  and make sure potato was cooked thoroughly. Other than that no deviation from recipe.

I have been meaning to rate this recipe for a while.  OMG!  So very good.  This is the kind of appetizer that literally makes my mouth water in anticipation!  I make them just as the recipe describes, but one can experiment and have fun with variations on the theme.

These were a nice change from  the usual potato dishes I make. I boiled the potatoes for about 15-18 minutes, scooped out the middle with a spoon (I had to remind myself to be gentle so that the potatoes stayed in tact). I seasoned my mixture with garlic powder, onion powder and a small amount of salt. I omitted the chives bc I didn't have any. I will definitely make these again!

Really good and easy. I used gourmet klondike red potatoes. They are really tiny so you can imagine how cute these looked. Before you fill the red potatoes taste the filling to make sure it has enough salt and it has the consistency you like. I added a bit of butter and used a hand held mixer to whip the potatoes. Add a tiny dollop of sour cream on top and some chopped up chives and MMM!

This recipe was a hit at my house.  My husband would have eaten all that I made if we did not have dinner guests over.  He is not an onion or chive fan, so I left that off the recipe and it still turned out incredible.

My kids liked them but I thought they were rather  bland even after increasing the seasoning and spices. They either need more salt, more bacon or more cheese. It takes a lot longer than 10 minutes to cook the potatoes and they are not worth the trouble. There are a lot tastier appetizers recipes  out there that take less time and aggravation.

I read the reviews and carved my potatoes raw.  I only did this to 3 potatoes so my portions were smaller and I didn't find that this was hard or time consuming.  However, I thought it was pretty bland.  I should have followed another review that said they added garlic and butter.  I will make this again, but I want to change the mashed potato recipe a bit.. maybe add cheese in the potato mixture instead of just on top.  Thanks.

I followed the recipe but added 1/4 cup of light margarine to the mix.  Then over stuffed the taters after I salted them.  Baked them for about 20 minutes and they were perfect.  Just like a stuffed baked potato but these were easy to hold for a quick appetizer.

As suggested below, use a melon baller to scoop it out while raw and then boil it.  Worked BEAUTIFULLY!  Very easy too.  I only gave it 4 stars because I used a lot more seasoning, bacon, and cheese than it called for--but the ingredients that it calls for are perfect.  I will only give 5s to the recipes that don't need as much tweaking  2 suggestions: use a bit of milk to make it creamy and use 1/3 fat sour cream (didn't alter the flavor at all)

These were time consuming but worth it! I added 1 Tbsp of seasoning salt and 1 tsp garlic powder.  As other reviewers have said, there was something lacking.  The extra seasoning made up for that.  Everyone at our party loved them and they didn't stay on the plate long! Thanks for the recipe.

Used tiny red potatoes.  My preference would be to use less sour cream and more cheese.  Next time I'll mix some extra cheese into the potato filling and top with the rest.  I cut the potatoes in half before cooking and a small slice off the bottom of each half so they wouldn't roll around.  Had no trouble scooping out the potatoes with a melon baller when they were cooked.  The skins don't rip if the potatoes are still firm (not overcooked).

Great Idea for when you want a bite sized snack or app to serve at a party. Adults and kids alike devoured these bite sized potato goodies, at a recent 50th birthday bash.
 Kept the recipe the same, and will keep on making these.

2 words: time consuming!  I brought these to a get-together.  Everyone brought a heavy appetizer.  There were tasty and were eaten quickly.  I just thought I would never be ready in time b/c I spent so much prep time on the food.

Hit of the party!  Only reason not 5 stars is the amount of putzy time required to put it all together and keep the skins on the potatoes while handling.  Also cut the tip off the bottom of each to keep them from tipping.  Brushed the skins with olive oil and sprinkled with sea salt to keep skins crispy.  Skipped the bacon and season salt.  Substituted parmesan for cheddar cheese.  Substituted fresh rosemary for chives.  Reduced sour cream by half and added 2 oz of cream cheese and 1 oz cream.  These kept well in the oven when guests arrived late.  They also reheated well as leftovers.  Next time I will make extra to freeze for future use.

The time cooking potatoes was off.  Even after 20 minutes the potatoes were still hard.  It was difficult to scope out the insides without breaking the skin.  I can see this being good, but we just didn't have any luck with it.

Have made these many times according to the recipe. That said, pre-cooked bacon is tasteless here. it doesn't have nearly the flavor of freshly cooked bacon. Sometimes I throw in extra, as well. You must ice down the potatoes to keep the skins nice and stop the cooking. I've had many requests for this recipe. Thanks for it!

I really like making these for appetizers.  I try to find really small red potatoes.
I took the advice of others - cut and scoop out before cooking.
I also rub the potato shells with olive oil and pre- bake them.  
I then fill them and heat them through.

I cooked the potatoes in the microwave and they worked perfectly.  The skins didn't fall off at all. I did use regular-sized red potatoes though. Very good!

Absolutely 5 stars!  These are so easy and so delicious, full of flavor :)  The only thing I did differently is omit the chives because I did not have any and added sliced green onions.  I will be making these again.

These are good and not hard at all. Just don't get the real tiny potatoes. The skins tend to be to soft and break. I just made a circle with a spoon and scoped the potato out. I think next time I will sprinkle a little salt on the potato before I put the filling in.

Very good, very easy.  This recipe will be in my "party rotation" now.  I'm not exact with the measurements because I just use what I have on hand, and that is the beauty of it - it lends itself to substitutions.  Anyway, the only change that I suggest (just for ease) is that I use the bagged "real bacon pieces" that you find on the salad dressing isle.  It just saves time and mess and tastes just as good.

There is one key ingredient to add to this recipe: horseradish.  Trust me.  Add a dollop to taste and it will be delish.  I do not have the patience to scoop and refill.   I added butter and horseradish to the ingredient list, heated it in a 375 oven for 20 minutes. Then I topped with cheese and put it back in the oven for 5 minutes.  Try it!

YUMMY!  I can't see making this without the aid of a melonballer.  As long as you don't cook these too long, they come out perfectly and don't rip through the skins.  Made this at my holiday party this past weekend and they gobbled them up as soon as I put them out.  Great cuz they are bite sized, making them not as filling as regular potato skins.  And the red potatos are a better flavor!

A really great recipe that looked good as well as tasted good! My potatoes were a little hard so I put the potato centers into a food processor with the sour cream to soften them.
End product was really delicious!

Very delicious! Next time, I will boil them a little longer. At 10 minutes, they were not soft enough to mash the insides. And my husband loves bacon so I added more bacon. Other than that, they're prefect!

I don't eat meat, so I left out the bacon.  I did add a little cream style horseradish.  If you want to try this just add a a teaspoon then taste before you add more to be sure you have it to your likeing.  I suggest the small red potatos to keep them bite size.  I fixed these for a brunch for a women's book club here at my condo.  Really yummy.  I took the advice of another reviewer and sliced a bit off the bottom of each half before boiling to make them sit flat on the serving plate.  They looked great.  Everyone liked them.

These were great side dish to our Christmas dinner.  My family loved the presentation and flavor of these.  I was not crazy about the texture as the directions instructed so I would suggest cooking the potatoes a little longer.  I started with a spoon to scoop the insides but quickly pulled out my mellon baller, it made the job a little easier.  I didn't have chives but used green onion (scallions) and they were a welcome substitution.   Will definitely make again with the changes I made.

These are great!! I make them all the time! They are time consuming, but its worth it, and they also reheat very well! You have to boil them for more than 10 minutes in order to get the middle out, and I add quite a bit more butter and cheese than the recipe calls for!

This is an almost duplicate recipe from Cooking Light. Potatoes do take longer to cook. I used smallest I could find and 15 minutes boiling was not enough. I agree, these take more work than they are worth.

Very good. Everybody liked them a lot. I put extra cheese in and food processed my filling so it was very creamy. I used those baby red potatos, so scooping them out was a bit tedious but they were great b/c they were so bite size,perfect for passing around at a party.Will definitely make again.

These seemed a bit like twice-baked potatoes, although I thought they were a bit dry and boring.  I made them as is except the chives were jarred and not fresh.  I think it would be easier to bake the potatoes first --  I think baking would help make the scooping easier without skins slipping off.  I also think I would've liked them better with the bacon sprinkled on top.  But I think they were just a bit of a hassle to re-make them with these changes.

These were fantastic - the hit of the Christmas Day potluck. I used regular-sized red potatoes that I had on hand [rather than the teeny ones], increased to 2c sour cream and 1/2lb. bacon and baked for 20 minutes at 375. I will be making these again, and soon!

great recipe. I made these and they were a big hit. My only suggestion is to use a melon baller or a rounded measuring spoon to scoop out the centers so you don't break the skins. They are like a cross between potato skins and twice baked potatoes.

I just did the seasonings to taste, and didn't use chives(forgot 'em)..they still were a hit. A little time consuming to make- hollowing out the potato halves takes awhile, especially if you are trying to get maximum space for filling without butchering the potatoes through the skin (careful!).  There wasn't a single one left. Great sports party food.

Labor intensive but delicious!!  Made it for Grey Cup party and everyone loved it.  I too mixed the cheddar cheese into the stuffing mixture and sprinkled a few bits of bacon on top as well.  Used green onion instead of shallot and added the garlic powder as suggested by another reviewer.
They looked just like Maddiecat's picture!

I made these today, I read the reviews and tried different ways to hallow out the potato. I tried cutting in half and boiling, peels cam off while scooping out the potato. Next I tried microwaving halved potatoes, they came out like rubber. What worked the best for me was cutting them while they were raw, I used a metal 1/4 tsp. to scoop out the raw potato. I boiled the potato skins and potato together for about 15 min. I separated the peels for the potato mush, and whipped the potatoes like I would to make mashed potatoes. I added butter, sour cream, Hormel real bacon bits, and my chives. Filled the Skins with my mixture and baked at 375 for about 15 min. I then put my cheddar on top and baked for 5 more min. They did come out pretty good.  My 13 year old loved them. Prep time was about 40 min for me. Lots of work .

OMG...nom, nom, nom. I was looking for an appetizer to make for tailgating and went to Allrecipes on my phone while in the grocery store. This recipe came up and sounded like  what I was looking for. I fixed them last night and finished baking them this morning. I always read the reviews, because lets face it, you guys are great cooks. But, I also believe in following the original recipe.  I did opt to bake the potatoes rather than boil them because I was doing these while I was fixing dinner and that was just better time management. I baked them for about 40 minutes at 350 degrees. I then cut them in half and used a ¼ tsp metal measuring spoon to scoop out the potato.  After following the recipe, I tasted the potato mixture and added some garlic powder, a little more pepper and salt and 3-4 TBS of melted butter. I then used a small ice cream scoop to fill the potato skins. I refrigerated them overnight and topped them with cheese this morning and baked them. They were a HUGE hit at the tailgate today. I only wished I had doubled the recipe. This will be a definite keeper!!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.
FYI: I did not have any of the other readers issues with them falling apart. Just make sure you leave a "shell", don't scoop to the skin. Also, I did not find the time to make these unreasonable. If you are looking for a quick fix then go to the freezer section at the grocery and grab a shake and bake option. If you find time in the kitchen therapeutic, and you e

These were ok but I would not serve them for company because of the way they would not sit flat on the plate so didn't make a nice presentation. It could be because I used the small red potatoes. I did like the process a reviewer posted to cook the skins separate for the potato--hollow out the potato, which worked well with the small potato--just didn't like how they looked on the plate.

Giving this 4 stars because I made some changes.  I microwaved potatoes on baked potato setting until tender, then let cool 10 minutes before slicing and scooping.  I had no problems with skin tearing this way.  After I scooped out the pulp with a melon baller, sprinkled the shells with fine sea salt to add more flavor to the potato.  Added chive and onion cream cheese, sour cream, Oscar Mayer Real Bacon Bits, margarine, Lawry's, pepper to the potatoes and then using a cookie scoop, scooped the mixture into the shells.  I prepared these the day before the party and put them into a 9x13.  Day of the party I will just reheat until warm and maybe garnish with more cheese and either parsley or chives.  The sample I had was pretty good, hope the guests like too.

I did the recipe exactly and the potatos didn't cook all of the way through. I considered the amount of time and i used small potatos and they were rock solid. I baked for another 20 minutes before i put the filling in and they turned out mildly okay. Will not be using again.

My youngest son who is very picky asked me to make this dish again. Tasted good to me. I just have to find an easier way to scoop the potatoes out without destroying them.

These were good. I'm not sure if I liked the texture. I would suggest boiling them longer. I don't think I will make again. They look better than they taste and all the work.

I made these a couple weeks ago and I'm making them again tonight.My whole family loved them  even my very picky husband who said at first he didn't want any because he don't care for potatoes.....so of course he changed his mind and I got less...lol...oh well thats love. I followed the directions but didn't measure anything just added to our liking.

These were okay they were missing something to me. Maybe because they are so small you can't really taste the filling, I don't know but everyone I ate I tried to figure out what it was missing but never could figure it out. I followed the recipe, but I'm not sure how long I boiled the potatoes for but I do know it was longer than 10 minutes. My little brother said liked them but he only ate 2 of them so not sure how much he really liked them. They did look cute, except for the few that the skins did break.

These were really really tasty.  You can really add  anything you want to these.  I made them with the little gourmet potatoes.  It was a job getting the potato out because they were so small but it was worth it.  They were so dainty!  I mashed the potatoes and they were really smooth.  Added more chesse.  Lish

Absoluteley awesome.  Perfect as an appetizer or with a steak dinner.  I don't use parsley however, but dill weed is a must. Adjust cooking time for size of potatoes, but otherwise perfect just as it is.

These turned out great!  It was a little bit of a pain scooping out the insides, but once I did a few I got the hang of it. I used pre-cooked bacon bits rather than cooking bacon.  I boiled the potatos longer than ten minutes, maybe more like 14 minutes, but they still could've gone a bit longer.  I made about 20 of them and baked half on new year's eve, and put the rest in the fridge to bake the next day.  They came out yummy both times.

These were really good!  I recommend microwaving the potatoes and using Oscar Meyer real bacon pieces as it is much, much faster! I also mixed most of the cheddar cheese in with the potato filling and then topped with the remaining cheese.

Great for when company comes over and you want to fancy them.  These are not very hard to make but they taste like they are.  This one is a keeper.

Cute idea, but nothing special taste-wise.  Plus, they need to boil longer than 10 minutes, or you won't be able to spoon out the potato very easily.

Thank you for such a wonderful recipe, it was pretty good! My husband loved them, but my tween didn't! However, next time (an indication that we'll make them again)I'll microwave the potato before boiling them. Perhaps it was the size of them that made it longer to cook than suggested.

I took these to my sister's last night as a side dish to the surf and turf meal she had planned and everyone loved them.  My potatoes were probably a little larger because I did end up boiling them for 20 minutes.  I followed the recipe but added a little milk, parmesan cheese and some garlic then topped them with sharp cheddar.  Yum!

these little potato bites were really tasty and easy to make and were a big hit at Christmas dinner.  The red skin of the potato and the green chives made them look very festive!

These were wonderful!  Perfect little bites that we had as a side dish.  I too added shredded cheese, butter and a few different spices to the mixture for a little extra flavor booth.  Will make again...thanks for the recipe!

These were great! I used baby red potatoes (larger ones would have required longer boiling time), and added some cream cheese and parmesan cheese. I used bacon bits, which really cut down on preparation time. Thanks!

I cooked mine twice and long, and they still needed to be cooked longer.  I added cheese to the potato mix, next time I will make them with a little milk and some more seasoning.  I won't be making these again.

These were delicious and the biggest hit among all the food brought to a recent party.  I used pre-cooked bacon bits (the real thing, not a soy product), which was a great time (and clean-up) saver.  I found it was easiest to keep the potato half on my work surface while carefully scooping with a melon baller,  A few skins did split,but who cares?  They made a very appealing presentation and were even better to eat!

This was great with some cream cheese added for a little extra flavor. I also added shredded cheese into the potatoe mixture. The only reason this didn't get a five star was due to the time it took. I will make again when I have time to spare.

This was a good side dish.  I used garlic ranch dressing and added chives.  Next time I make this I will cook the potatoes in the oven longer to get a little crisp and then add cheese and chives at the end.

I didn't have much success with these and ended up adding heavy cream to make mashed potatoes. May try again.
