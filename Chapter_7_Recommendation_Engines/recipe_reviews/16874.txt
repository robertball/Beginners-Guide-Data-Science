This smoothie has a very mild flavor, almost bland for my taste. The ginger flavor is very subtle. Since the consistency is not that of a smoothie, you must add 2-3 ice cubes to thicken it up.

This was okay.  I used orange juice because the orange made it way too pulpy and thick.  The ginger makes it interesting.  I think I'll stick to fruit and juice smoothies.

I was very intrigued by this recipe since I really like Orange and Ginger. But, I just couldn't bring myself to put "powdered" ginger in it. So, I steeped 1 Tablespoon of grated ginger in 1 cup of Lactose Free milk for about 5 minutes, cooled and strained out th ginger.  I added that to 1 cup vanilla yogurt. I also added 2 bananas and 6 ice cubes as suggested by another reviewer. I really like it. My husband said it was "o.k." I give it a 5 my way.

I like ginger and I like banana orange smoothies. I guess I just don't like them all together. This also needs to have something frozen added to it to make it refreshingly cold. I don't normally like ice in a smoothie, preferring to use frozen fruit instead, but I blended some in to this smoothie after the fact, just to see if it would make a difference. It did make it more refreshing, but the ginger is overpowering and I just couldn't get past that.

I doubled this recipe. My bananas were frozen and because I didn't have soy milk, I used lowfat milk and a half teaspoon of vanilla. I threw in a quarter cup of wheat germ. A doubled recipe was more than enough for my two boys and I.

Tasted just okay as the recipe is written.  I added banana flavored milk the second time.  That made it a lot better!

This was good but the flavor just didn't have enough to it.  I added crushed ice which was better to keep it frosty and cold.

I  used almond milk and skipped the ginger and it taste really good. The pulp makes the consistency of the smoothie more interesting??

8.6.16    I used a frozen banana, but it still didn't have what I consider to be a smoothie consistency, just a liquid breakfast drink.  I ended up adding crushed ice which somewhat diluted the mild flavor even more.  If I make this again, I'd freeze all of the fruit and add 2 oranges, instead of one.  Interesting combo of ingredients, the flavor was  just a bit on the weak side, and the texture just wasn't quite right (at least for me).

Accidentally added more ginger than I should have, so it was a little overwhelming, but a good drink.  Fruits really add to make it a bit creamy.
