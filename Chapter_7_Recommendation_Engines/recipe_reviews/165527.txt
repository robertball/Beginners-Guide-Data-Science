Loved this meal. It was delicious. I put it in the crock pot, porkchops uncooked, cilantro on top, salsa, black beans. Cooked on high for 3 hours. Pork chops falling apart,so tender, so good.

We prepared this dish as in the recipe, but with boneless butterfly porkchops.  It was very quick, simple and tasty!  Along with some yellow rice, the whole meal cost no more than $7 to feed four!  Next time, I think we will probably add some spices to the pork chop such as cumin and chili powder to enhance the flavor of the pork chop and tie it into the flavor of the sauce.

This was FAN-TASTIC!!! And it's ridiculous how simple it was to make! I made the recipe as is, only adding a squeeze of fresh lime to enhance the salsa flavor. Wonderful! We also used thick cut (easily 1 1/2 wide) pork chops that we got from Costco and they only took 35 minutes to cook all the way through. We served the whole dish over a bed of rice ... My husband is already asking to make it again! Thanks for the great recipe!!

I was nervous about making this because my husband is really picky and sure enough, he didn't like the combination of the chops and beans. I, on the other hand, LOVED it! It reminded me of my dad's authentic Mexican Charro beans. I'll be making this again whether my husband likes it or not :)

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe. Very simple, economical, tender and delicious. I've already made this a couple times. I actually followed the recipe closely (which is unlike me), except for sprinkling the chops with a shake of adobo seasoning before browning. Definitely use the BONE-IN chops. I always use boneless and was reluctant, but so glad I used the bone-in. They seem to be so much more flavorful and definitely less expensive. And my daughter (who is usu. pretending she is a  of wolf or some type of cat) loved gnawing on the bones! I served with extra chopped cilantro on the side and yellow Goya rice. My husband said the flavor was very Cuban, and the combo of the pork juices, salsa and black beans is unbelievably flavorful. Since I had so much leftover cilantro, I chopped it all up, wrapped it well and froze it for next time. Since you're using the cilantro for cooking, the flavor is the same, even if the appearance isn't. Saved me from buying another bunch of cilantro and throwing most of it out.

Plate licking good! I seasoned my pork with some chili powder, garlic, season salt, and onion powder. I also served mine over rice. I will definitely make this again!

I loved this! I made mine with low fat mushroom soup, added some frozen green peppers, used Medium Chunky Salsa, stirred and served over rice with shredded cheddar on top! IT was fabulous! It had a mild zing, tasted great and my fiance who isn't a huge Tex-mex fan gave it 9.5 out of 10 stars! I used 4 pork chops and increased the salsa.

I seasoned my pork chops with chipotle pepper, salt, and black pepper before browning them.  Leftover homemade salsa and the black beans were stirred together and poured over the pork chops in the slow cooker and cooked on high for three hours.  Seasoned with fresh cilantro as the recipe directed, we all loved this simple yet delectable meal.  For those tempted to use boneless pork chops, pork cooked with the bone stays moister and the meat around the bone is a real prize.

Wonderful recipe!  I followed the advice of another reviewer and cooked mine in the crock pot and also used chili powder, cumin, seasoning salt, garlic powder,  and onion powder.

OMG these Black Beans and Pork Chops are so good!  I seasoned the pork chops with salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika, and cayenne powder before browning.  I also put 2 cans of black beans and 1 can of drained corn.  I didn't have any cilantro and don't think it was missed.  Pork chops were falling apart and the sauce the dish makes is killer!  Serve this over white rice.  YUM!  Thanks lovebeingamom!

I admit I freely seasoned while browning with cumin, salt, garlic and onion. I omitted cilantro because my husband dislikes it. This was surprisingly good.  A big hit.   Soo easy, thank you.

I don't know why this recipe is so delicious, but it works! It is alomost impossible to mess up. You can add all kinds of things (garlic, onions, red pepper flakes, lime, etc.) but there really isn't a need. I will be making this again for sure.  p.s. instead of regular pork chops I used pork shoulder blades. It was fabulous.

This tasted good, but I thought the other flavors over-powered the taste of the pork.  But it's quick, simple and full of protein.  I rinsed off the beans, then added a bit of water to the pan in an effort to reduce the overall sodium content.

Very good recipe for how easy it is. The only reason I gave it 4 is because of the amount of sodium in a can of black beans. I rubbed some minced fresh ginger, salt, pepper and cumin on the pork chops before cooking. Great served over brown rice. The sauce is better the next day!

I tried this in the skillet a few times but thought the pork chops turned out too tough. So a few nights ago I threw it all in a baking dish, covered it with foil and slow-cooked it in the oven at 275 degrees for 3 hours. Heavenly! I used fresh salsa from the deli, and served it with yellow rice and sour cream.

This is a fantastic and very easy recipe. The pork chops come out nice and juicy and the flavor is wonderful. Incredibly easy to put together. Hardly any prep work involved.

This is so easy and delicious! My changes- I use 2 cans of beans(rinsed), about 1.5 cups sala. I also add shredded cheese over the top of the chops right before their done. I made these last night, probably for the tenth time. It's one of my favorite go to recipies

This was great!  I can't believe how easy it was to make something so yummy!  I threw everything in the crockpot without browning the meat first, and I still think it was delicious, and saved me some time.

I wasn't that impressed with this meal.  Yes, it was easy and economical, but the taste didn't wow me.  If I were to make this again, I would probably add some corn, and maybe some cheese.

This was quite tasty. I just want to let you know that the salsa cooks down and becomes much hotter than what you start with. I could barely eat it because my Medium salsa turned Hot on me! The flavor was great. Though, I might season the meat a bit more next time.

This is a very good, very simple dish. The only thing I would change for next time is to dice the pork chops before letting the dish simmer for 30 minutes. I doubt it would even need that long and the beans and salsa wouldn't stick to the bottom of the pan as much.

This was delicious!  A little salty because of the canned beans, but easy to remedy.  Like one other reviewer I seasoned and browned the chops before putting them in the crock pot for 6 hours.  The pork was so tender it fell apart.  I served the beans over rice. A little squeeze of fresh lime and some avocado slices round it out for a quick healthy meal.

I'll be making this again! I used the method of this recipe but had to change some of the ingredients because of what I had on hand. I used light red kidney beans instead of black beans and a can of Rotel instead of salsa. Like many people, I also sprinkled the chops with some spices in addition to black pepper--onion powder, chili powder and cumin. Mine took 35 min to cook. DH loved them and has requested I make them again. I served with rice and my recipe for Mexican corn. I will try the black beans and salsa next time. :)

I made this as directed and it turned out well. It's a quick and easy meal and a great way to keep pork chops moist. I recommend using at least a medium salsa to give it some heat, and a black bean and corn salsa would work perfectly in this. You could also add peppers, corn or other vegetables to your taste to make it a 1-dish complete meal. Also, even though I love salt, I found there is no need to add salt at any point since it's all in the black bean liquid.

Excellent! Great quick meal that everyone loved. Only slight changes were I dredged the chops in flour before adding to the pan which helped to thicken the sauce. Drained and rinsed the beans so added about 1/4 cup water to the pan to make up for the missing juice. Added some garlic as my salsa had none. Would make again!

so easy!  I used loin chops (leaner) and didn't have cilantro - no problem!  My Salsa was too HOT so I added a pinch of brown sugar, cinnamon, tumeric, cumin.  It smelled amazing.  I served over basmati rice & green beans on the side.

I have made it twice, the second time with boneless chicken.  Family preference was chicken.  Used fresh salsa both times.  So good we had it two nights in a row!

I made this in the Crock-pot today for my hubby (I don't eat meat.)  He really enjoyed this meal!  I used basil leaves instead of cilantro because I didn't have cilantro.  I looked up substitutes and basil leaves were listed.  The ratio is 1:1.  I also used a salsa that had black beans in it, but I still used a can of black beans as well.  I layered frozen uncooked pork chops, basil leaves, salsa, black beans w/ liquid, and pepper.  I cooked this on high for about an hour then turned it to low for about three more hours.  I served it over a bed of brown rice.  The next time I make this I may try adding taco seasoning to the pork chops as another reviewer commented.

I really liked this dish and I gave it the full rating because I thought it was one of the more original dishes I've tried on AllRecipes.  I only used two (large) pork chops but kept everything else the same. I used some of the fresh salsa that our "Cosco" type store has in the refrigerated section, it's the best.  I also added some granulated garlic and cumin, since I had no cilantro.  I browned the chops, added all the ingredients and baked it at 250 degrees in one of my enameled cast iron pots, slow cooked for 2 to 2 1/2 hours.  Both my husband and I liked this spicy dish, it seems the older we get the spicier we like our food!
A keeper dish for sure.

Not to our taste.  I cooked on very low, and the pork chops were so dry.  Won't make again.

Very good and easy.  Only difference I made was to use boneless chopes.  Also used a Spike's black bean salsa which went well with the black beans.

Great recipe! Probably would have been great as is, but my husband ad I wanted to add veggies and more spice. I seasoned the pork (I used Pork Loin, bone in) with Adobo w/ Sazon seasoning, pepper, garlic, and dried onion flakes.I also added the following (in addition to the beans and salsa) to pork chops after browned: more seasoning/onions, can of diced tomatoes (slightly drained), and chopped jalapeno and red peppers. Served with rice, sour cream and a lime. I nixed the cilantro just because I didn't have it and it was still good; next time I will use cilantro.

Since I didn't have pork chops, I made this with chicken.  It came out too soupy for me and, maybe because I used a mild salsa, I tasted mostly black beans.  I also very lightly seasoned the chicken with pepper, garlic powder, garlic salt, chili and cumin.  Nonetheless, this was okay.  Next time I will drain some of the liquid from the black beans and use pork chops.

This was delicious, I used boneless chops because we dont care for the bone-in, other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. Even my 1 year old son ate a bunch of it. Pork chops were tender. I served it over white rice and would recommend this to everyone.

I made this tonight and it's a winner! Made a fresh HOT salsa with my new Ninja and I think it made a world of difference! Followed the recipe to the letter but only used two thick chops. Also used low sodium organic black beans. I cooked the chops for 5-6 minutes per side with the lid on; and then finished with the rest of the recipe. The chops were so tender and delicious. I would totally make this for company, and for sure - use homemade salsa! Excellent recipe.

O-m-g this dish surprised the heck out of me. I gave it four stars only because I did tweak it. Salt and pepper alone is too bland for my taste buds. I seasoned pork chops with salt, pepper, cumin, allspice, garlic and onion powder, chili power, and just a touch of ground clove. While it was simmering, I periodically added homemade vegetable stock just to keep it from drying out. Yum yum yum!

I tried this recipe on Tuesday. It was simple and delicious! I pan-seared the chops then added the salsa, cilantro, and black beans. Let them cook, and in a half hour they were done! My boyfriend loved them, another man-pleasing recipe to add to my collection!

My DH and thought this was just ok.  It was easy to prepare.  I always try the recipe as written when rating, as I did this time. If I try this again I will add some jalepenos and some cumin.  We like our dishes on the spicy side, and this was lacking.

I added a can of cream of chicken soup, as I like a lot of gravy, and probably about 1 1/2 cups salsa. The flavors were there, but it still lacked something. Unsure if I'll make this again.

I thought this meal was delicious!  I make something very similar with chicken thighs in the slow cooker, but it never dawned on me to use it with pork!  For everyone who is concerned about the sodium content, they do sell low-sodium beans (which I used) or you can cook your own in the slow cooker.  Also, be sure to cut the cooking time if you are using boneless chops, or they will come out quite dry.  I served this with Spanish Yellow Rice and my pops thought he was in heaven.

So easy and delicious.  My husband and I both loved it!  We are looking forward to trying it again with different types of salsa, especially a mango salsa!  Endless possibilities for add-ins, and I think I'd like to try it with chicken, too.  Thank you so much for sharing this simple, satisfying dish :)

This was GREAT!  It was easy, low maintenance, and cheap!  The leftover sauce/beans is great for rice for lunch too!  :)  My husband loved the pork.

Very delicious!  I rubbed the chops with an organic rotisserie rub.  It was excellent even without the cilantro.

I liked the overall concept of this dish. It's hard to find porkchop recipes that aren't breaded or swimming in fat, but this recipe just lacked something. The texture of the beans didn't add to the dish, and all I could taste was spice from the salsa. I might take this technique and play with the ingredients a bit.

The black bean/salsa mix in this recipe is fantastic.  It would be great with chicken, in a burrito, or in a casserole.

Very easy and super tasty!  I added a half can of corn (drained) and split the salsa to 1/2 cup regular salsa and 1/2 cup salsa verde, which gave it a little kick!  I served it over quinoa and my husband loved it.

WOWZA!  This was absolutely fantastic! I made this nearly exactly as written - left out the cilantro as I don't care for it, but the rest produced a delicious dinner! For the salsa, I used 1/2 medium and 1/2 hot - perfect. Served over white rice. Will definitely keep this in a regular rotation. Thanks so much!

SO easy!!!!! I too put in crock pot-low for 5 hours. My only addition was to sprinkle chops with cumin and garlic and brown before putting in crock pot.

This was easy and good. Will make again. I only browned the meat for about 1 minute on each side, and even then it still didn't take nearly 25-30 minutes to get to 145 degrees.

Chops were nice and tender but it needed more spices.  I sauteed onions and garlic before browning the meat and added that but fajita or other seasonings would have added to the flavor.

I cooked according original instructions.  I did not need to change anything.  I am trying to get my husband to eat more beans so, I thought I would try this recipe.  I am glad I did!!!!  Not only did my husband eat his entire plate, he wanted more.  I will be making this dish again.  Next time, I will double the portion sizes.

This was very easy and very flavorful. I used 2 types of salsa (mellow black bean and corn/zesty cilantro). I'm no professional cook or anything, but this was a hit! I brought some for lunch and all the seasonings had settled and it was even better than the night before!! I will definitely try this again!! LDW

This dinner was perfect! I took one of the other user suggestions to cook it in a crockpot and I must say i wouldn't do it any other way. I did season my pork chops with a little Greek seasoning and a dash of Creole seasoning. I cooked 10 pork chops so I used two cans of Bush black beans and 2 cans of salsa and a teaspoon of dried cilantro. I also threw in some rice and added lime juice to bring out all of the flavors.

This was great...super moist and flavorful chops. Seasoned them with Adobo on both sides before frying. I used fresh, medium salsa (every major grocer has their own version) and low sodium beans. Paired it with brown rice, spooned the beans and sauce over both. A sprinkle  of Mexican shredded cheese on top and a fresh green salad on the sidr and there you have it...a quick and flavorful dinner.

This recipe was delicious!  Even my hubby who doesn't care for pork chops said it was good.   I didn't have cilantro but I added a few drops of lemon juice like another reviewer had and it really enhanced the flavors.  I also didn't have a cover large enough for my skillet but the chops didn't dry out.  Definitely adding this to my favorites!

Absolutely delicious!!!! I didn't have any fresh cilantro (kind of made at the last minute) but I had some dried cilantro and used that. This dish is amazing, the flavors blend together so nicely and make such a nice sauce and the pork chops come out super tender! Must make rice to go with this, is perfect with the sauce.  Will most definitely be making this one often.  Is also super easy and fast for a busy weeknight meal!!

Amazing flavors.   I made my own salsa to my liking (spicy,  lots of garlic,  a can of diced tomatoes with green chilis,  and a small can of diced jalapeños +garlic and onion of course),  added lime juice and cumin as recommended and served with Spanish rice from the packet.  Only used 2 medium chops though and found that that to be plenty.  The sauce was a little soupy when served which got messy when I tried to cut it with a steak knife but so worth it.   Next time I will remove the chops from the sauce and slice up on a cutting board and return to the sauce to make it easier to eat. I did then with my son's and it worked great.   I also served with tortilla chips which was brilliant because I was able to scoop up salsa and beans at the end.   Very filling,  A+ in my book. PS no fresh cilantro at the store so had to use dried cilantro.   Would have been better with fresh I'm sure. PS only cost $12 bucks to make including the tortilla chips and rice.   I did have onion and spices on hand though.

We loved this dish! Such a simple dish with no muss, no fuss. Add the ingredients just like it says especially when making the first time. The next time you could experiment by varying salsas. The proportions are perfect and written as is, definitely worth a try! Thanks for sharing!!

I made this in the crockpot and we enjoyed the meal. When making in the crockpot I would use boneless pork chops.

This was a delicious, super easy recipe. I followed some advice from other reviewers and seasons the pork chops with not only black pepper, but garlic salt, cumin, and chili powder. Followed everything else exactly. Will definitely keep this in the rotation.

I made this last night for dinner.  We loved it.  Fast and easy. I used boneless pork chops and cut down the cooking time.  Great meal that I will make again.

I needed to not have to stand and cook this, so I put it all in the slow cooker. I did season the pork shops with garlic salt and a light sprinkle of cumin. Not outstanding, but good and tender.

Changing to a 10 ? rating on 2/14/17.
Had already started frying the chops when I realized I didn't have blackbeans. A jar of Trader Joe's Cowboy Caviar was sitting there - blackbeans, corn, salsa - so I dumped that in with an additional cup of salsa. Fantastic! Next time I'm going to try making my own Cowboy Caviar because the Trader Joe's is too expensive for routine use. Anyway, no rice. Cutting carbs. But green beans, tomato-avocado salad and a perfect dinner. Had to control myself to save some for lunch leftovers.
 
Really enjoyed this!  Used what I had - boneless chops, no cilantro.  Seasoned chops with garlic powder, cumin, fresh ground black pepper, chili powder.  Cooked as noted in recipe.  At the very end, removed pork chops from skillet and slightly thickened sauce with a little cornstarch and water and served over steamed rice.
This would be good with chicken, too.  Frankly, just the sauce served over rice would make a great meal for me.

Great recipe. Family loved it. Made as is except used fairly thick boneless pork chops and tripled the fresh cilantro. We are big cilantro fans here. We will make it again.

This was a quick and tasty meal.  I used a potato instead of rice, but will use rice as the side dish next time as that would be a better combination with the black bean "sauce"...a spanish rice that is :o)  I used aprox 1/2"thick chops.

I was happy to be able to use some leftover salsa (all the chips were eaten with more sour cream than salsa so the salsa was just hangin out in the fridge waitin for something else to do. I know, I know, I should weigh like a bajillion lbs..) and I had about a 1/4 cup of extra onion that needed to be used so I added that in as well. The cilantro made this dish and I would use just a tad bit more next time around. 

Delicious.  Thank you lovebeingamom!

I've made this a few times using fresh pico de gallo instead of salsa since it has the cilantro in it already. I also add frozen corn. It's a complete meal and turns out great! This last time I didn't have the Pico so I substituted a can of Rotel and seasoned with Adobo still adding the corn. I served with Adobo seasoned Angel Hair noodles.  Came out very good too. Every time I've made this, the pork chops come out SO tender. You know they like it when the table goes silent while everyone's eating.

I made it with thick pork chops and simmered the beans with home made pico de gallo for about 20 minutes on low heat and poured the mix over the pork chops and rice.
IT was great !!!!

Simple and tasty.  I used a cilantro salsa which was perfect, as I had no fresh cilantro on hand.  Also I dumped the puddle off the top of the can of beans and then added about 1/4 cup of water.

This was simple and tasty. We seasoned the pork chops with chipotle pepper, a little cumin, and pepper. I drained my can of beans because I don't like eating the heavy-sodium/preservatives sauce, so I just added 1/2 cup water to the mix. I cooked them for about 20 minutes, flipping once and mixing everything in. I served with/on top of brown rice. Good flavors!

I cooked this for my boyfriend's parents for dinner and it turned out AWESOME. Due to food allergies, had to change it up a teeny bit. Used 2 cans of Mild Rotel (instead of salsa), It added a nice kick to the flavoring. I marinated the pork chops with "Dale's" Steak Marinade and "Veggie Grill" spices for 3 hours. I cooked wild rice and baked vegetables (zucchini, squash and carrots) seasoned with veg. oil, black pepper, and sea salt.

So easy and delish!  I just tossed everything into the slow cooker for 4 hours on high...didn't even cook the pork chops first.  I'll drain some of the liquid off the beans next time.

Okay, I have, have ,have to give this 5 stars simply for the ease of preparation and the FLAVOR!. I did shred some cheddar cheese and melted throughout the last 10 minutes. And I probably doubled the cilantro. I did not serve with rice, I had some left over pull apart garlic bread that I served to soak up the juices. So Yummy. I also served corn on the cob. There are no left overs. This will be added to my regular menu. YUmmY!

This was wonderful!!! Even my 4 year old had seconds...and that doesn't happen often!  I did tweak it a little, I added some cayenne pepper and garlic to the porkchops while they cooked and we had Spanish Rice with it. Oh, and a sprinkle of parm. cheese on top. Excellent and easy dinner!!

Well - I loved it because it was different to do with pork. I didn't have Cilantro, so I used a salsa that had it in it. My better half informed me too late that he didn't like black beans but finished his plate. My 16 y/o refused to touch it because it looked too different to what she's use to.

Oh my gosh!  Like everyone said before me, so simple and so delicious!  I lightly sprinkled chili powder, cumin and black pepper before browning the pork chops.  I mixed the beans, salsa, cilantro together with a large clove garlic (pressed) and warmed it before pouring over the chops. WONDERFUL!  Hubby said I should do it again and that is high praise!

I have made this several times, i love it! the best part is how simple and time saving it is! the only thing i did different was added some water in the skillet while browning the pork chop to keep it tender, drain then add the other ingredients to simmer. also, buy your favorite salsa, if you get the cheap stuff it will make a difference!

Excellent and so easy!!! I added a can of corn because I like the combination of black beans, salsa, and corn, and let it simmer about 40 minutes until the pork was nice and tender. I'm a plain salt & pepper cook who would rather eat out because it's quick and easy. With recipes like this, there's no need to eat out anymore.

I was hesitant to try this since there's not many ingredients, I thought it would be bland.   The changes I made are that I used boneless pork chops, a whole lot more cilantro and I poured half of the bean liquid out and replaced with water to reduce the sodium.  I served it over rice. My two young children hate salsa and tomatoes, but they both gobbled up everything on their plate and raved about it.  My husband also thought it was great, and I liked it too and it was simple to make.   The leftovers the next day were good too! This will go into my box!

This was good, but having looked forward to it all day, it didn't quite live up to expectations.  I seasoned it a little bit more with Beau Monde, coriander seeds in addition to the cilantro, cumin, garlic and onions.  Otherwise I followed the recipe as written.  I can't say I was disappointed with it, but I had hoped for a meal that would really "pop."

This was very good- I have actually made it twice and my husband loves it with just a side of regular rice.  I recommend a dollop of sour cream on top just to make it that much better.

Awesome recipe. Wanted a quick and easy recipe for chops and this fit the bill. We decided we'll try it with a pork butt in the slow-cooker next month! Great flavor, quick meal. Definitely a keeper! Served with brown rice

I love one-skillet dishes like this! I used thin-cut, lean pork chops, and it came out great. My boyfriend inhaled everything on his plate! There was a little too much sauce that I ended having to toss after a few days in the fridge, so I'll cut back on that next time.

I don't really know what to do with pork chops so this recipe came in handy since I had all the ingredients. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, a little bland but good. Even the Mrs. liked it so we will be eating this again.

I  made this last night for my husband, and it was so easy and delicious!  After reading a few of the reviews, I added chili powder, garlic powder and salt in addition to the pepper to season the pork chops.  (I used two boneless chops because we prefer them.)  I also used a can of garlic and onion-flavored black beans that I had on hand.  I didn't want the pork to be tough so I cooked it on very low heat for about twenty minutes.  I served it over Spanish rice.

Allrecipes is a great source that I regularly use. I typically find a recipe that fits my menu for the day, then always read the reviews for further options and suggestions. Like others, I cooked this in a slow cooker, used thick chops on the bone. I also used a slight amount of beer to provide moisture, some cumin and chili powder and cilantro. My wife loved the black beans and salsa. Great recipe!  Definitely saved!!

This is a very good meal!  I was really skeptical but from the reviews and posts, I decided to give it a try.  I used thick pork chops and made the dish as written with one change, I added some Cayenne Pepper on top of everything.  Just some sprinkles and it just really hit my taste buds!  Going in our favorites.

Turned out excellent. I did add chili spice to the pork chops. Also with the rice mixture I made it on the side. So I had rice the black beans and then I added some diced tomatoes, a can of green chilies, a can of corn, and the salsa. I also added dried cilantro to the mixture. I doubled the recipe, put it in a deep 9 x 13 pan and then added cheddar cheese to the top. Put it in the oven to melt the cheese. Excellent! It hasn’t been 12 hours since I made it and there’s only one square of it left.

Super easy and pretty yummy! I seasoned the pork chops and also added onions when I tossed all the beans/salsa in the pan. Next time I'll drain the beans a little bit since I got a pretty runny salsa but it was still great. Husband loves it and requested it again next week!

It’s easy and good for a week night meal. I dumped in 6 boneless chops and seasoned them with garlic salt, cumin, chili powder, onion powder, and black pepper. Then I dumped in the black beans and salsa. Cooked in my slow cooker while I was at work.

Very tasty recipe though I added a few additional things such as corn and sweet peppers, lightly sprinkled some cumin on the (boneless) pork chops then garnished with some sliced avocado. I also opted to cook it in the Instant Pot. So very tender!

I can't even believe how good this was. I seasoned two chops with salt and pepper, and browned them in the cast iron. I turned down the heat, drained the beans & poured them over the chops, covered the beans with salsa, put a lid on it, and let it simmer for 20 minutes. Then I took the lid off to let the liquid steam out while steaming veggies. Maybe I'll use cilantro next time, maybe I won't. YUM!

I was so skeptical about this recipe that I had a backup plan on standby.  However since I found similar 4-5 star reviews with the same reservations, I went ahead.  VERY glad that I did.  My husband and I enjoyed this so much we're adding it to the regular meal rotation.  I did season the chops with cumin and garlic as others suggested.  The reason it's not a 5 is the chops were a little tough- could be my fault for using boneless since that's what we had on hand.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

This was so good! I used Crenshaw’s C6 Mango Habanero salsa( available only in Texas at HEB) and put some habanero jack cheese on top, with brown rice. It was so easy and so delicious!

Surprisingly easy and good! Served over yellow rice. The black bean/salsa makes a gravy to die for over the rice. I seasoned with Goya before pan-frying. I ended up putting it in the oven at 350 for an hour instead of leaving it on the stove.

I made it exactly as written. My bone in pork chops werent thick so it didnt take long after browning it to cook. I still let the beans, salsa and cilantro simmer the full 20 min and then served it all over white rice. Im also surprised something so simple tasted so good. This is a keeper and will add to our meal rotation.

We like spicy food, so I used pepper, taco seasoning and onion powder on the chops. Had some fresh tomatillos that I added with the beans and salsa. I often serve it with quinoa rather than rice.

So good! We loved this recipe. I followed the suggestion about a crock pot cook & put it in on high for 3 hrs. They were slightly frozen but came out perfect. We also added two tablespoons of Sofrito, green olives, some Adobe and kielbasa sausage cut up. We made it with white rice. It was amazing! Next time I will double the beans because we loved the black beans.

This is a very hearty meal. I made it pretty much exactly as directed. I used this on some very thick  bone-in pork chops and felt like they would have been better suited for the grill.  I will use this menu again, but next time I'll use it with more pedestrian pork chops that can use some dressing up.

Simple and fast to prepare.  Per some suggestions I added some spices and crushed garlic to the chops before searing them.  Served with multi-grain Tortilla scoops to have something to gather up the sauce & veggies with.  Everyone enjoyed it.

This has all my family's favorites:  Pork, Black Beans and Salsa.  Made according to the recipe but added some garlic and chopped up onions to the beans/salsa for added flavor.  Easy and so very flavorful, served over white rice.  None left at the end of the night!

We had an extra cooked porch chop. Sliced them very thin combined it with leftover bean/salsa to make a lovely bean soup. Added sour cream & crush tortilla chips. Delicious!

Keep a close eye on the meat thermometer. The chops went overcooked in just a few minutes. I think this would be much better in an oven.

Added a can of HEB cream of poblano to help balance the heavy salsa taste suggested by others.  Substituted plain black beans with HEB lime and jalapeño black beans.   And it was AMAZING!  (Only mentioned HEB, because I haven’t seen these ingredients at other stores). Anyway, such few ingredients and so easy and quick to make.  5 stars!

Simple and tasty, but next time i’ll dial down the salsa maybe use a milder one. With that being a dominant ingredient like it is, the stuff we usually use is a little intense. Served it up with some Spanish style rice.  Might try it with a bit of sour cream next time too.

I nicknamed this "southwest chops." Go easy on the salt/seasonings. The black beans and salsa have plenty of flavor, so if you're used to seasoning your pork chops, dial it back a bit. I made this one night when I was running out of groceries. I happened to have everything needed, except cilantro, and it turned out much better than I anticipated! It's an easy go-to that I come back to when it's crunch time and everyone is hungry.

Loved this simple recipe. I had extra thick boneless chops which I salted and peppered and the seared quickly. Sautéed over a very low heat for 25 minutes. Perfect

I tried it in the slow cooker and it came out tender and perfect.  I made 6 chops and added 1 can  and a more then a cup of salsa.  At the end before serving I added a second can because the first almost melted away and I added more cilantro at the end.  Its super easy to make and you can't make a mistake.  I served it over jasmin rice.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I think it might be better with chicken.  That I will do next.

Absolutely loved this meal. I made it according to the directions with one change, boneless pork hops (it's what I had on hand). Usually my husband adds hot sauce to everything but he likes this better without hot sauce. It kind of reminded us of rice and beans. A keeper for sure.

Mixed reviews - 1 star from me and son, 3 from wife, 4 from daughter.  Cooked in slow cooker.  Pork chops themselves were pretty good but mild salsa and beans over rice was pretty tasteless.

VERY VERY good! I seasoned the pork chops with seasoned salt, pepper, garlic powder and a dash of nutmeg and served on basmati rice. Next time I will add 2 cans of black beans just to give more sauce for the rice. I will definitely make this one again! YUMMMM!!!!

Easy, quick and delicious. My step-dad loved it and he doesn't even like black beans but he enjoyed this. I used chives in place of cilantro and that worked just fine. I've thought about adding tequila or white wine next time. Makes a great family dinner it

It is a go-to staple in my quick easy dishes. The 5 stars are for as is, but it is a brilliant little dish to change to your own tastes.
Thanks for uploading it. It's delicious!

It turned out super bland for me. I used a cockpot like one of the other reviewers did. It could be I used pork loin instead. Was not a fan of this meal even though it was super easy to make.

Love this. Added cumin, garlic powder and onion powder with seasoning salt and yum! So good. Cooked in slow cooker on high for 3 hours. So tender.

It’s so good. Another user suggested putting all ingredients in a crockpot for 3 hours on high or 6 hours on low (what I did). I used medium salsa, which added some extra flavor. I did not put the oil in the crockpot. The pork chops were falling apart after 6 hours in the crockpot. So good!

We made it as is and loved it.  It’s a regular in our home now.  I’ve added rice and chicken stock as well and prepared it in the oven as a full meal.  Thanks for the recipe.

When I read the recipe I was skeptical (pork chops and salsa?), but after I read the other reviews decided to give it a try.  Pretty darn good.  After I browned the chops I took them out, sautéed some onion and garlic before adding back the chops, salsa and black beans.  I'll make this again.

LOVE! This is so delicious! My husband requested I make it a second time. I doubled the recipe this time because the leftovers are fantastic on a tortilla. It is in the oven right mow and I am so ready to eat!

One of my favorites, but the salsa is the key. Costco used to have a pico de gallo salsa that was perfect for this; they no longer have it. Still good just not obsessed...trying to find a comparable one.

I used dried cilantro, 1/2 T.  I halved the recipe, except all of the oil.  I used sweet onion flavored salsa.  I cooked it 20 minutes.  I thought it was good, my husband thought it was great!  Served with white Minute Rice.

I did not really care for the way the flavors of the beans and salsa mixed with the pork chop flavor.   Personal preference only.

We used boneless thinly sliced pork chops, added a can of corn (drained) and seasoned the meat with taco seasoning. Served over a bed of rice. It was very delicious! Pork chops were easily shredded and cooked perfectly. We cooked for 3 hours on high in the crock pot.

Simple and so much more delicious than I was expecting! I didn't have salsa on hand so I tossed some tomatoes, garlic, onion and lime juice in the blender - I think it actually worked better than one from the bar. I cooked the meat for probably 45 mins on low flame and it was sooo tender. I used boneless because that's what I had.

I made this as directed using the bone in chops, which are more flavorful. The salsa and beans are a favorite combo around here in Miami and this was a delicious meal.  My husband especially enjoyed it.  I will be making this again

With the exception of sprinkling some adobo on the thick cut chops along with pepper, I made this exactly as listed. It was fantastic, and I'm one that never gets pork chops right. I usually either undercooked them or they end up like shoe leather. With this recipe they were perfectly cooked. The flavor was so good that I strained the leftover liquids and saved them as a base for dirty rice. So yummy!

Simply AMAZING . INCREDIBLE flavor. I used Trader Joe's Canned Cuban black beans (with 1/2 of the juice in can), Aldi brand fresh medium salsa (1/2 cp) and 1/2 cup jarred salsa (medium heat), cilantro. I didn't make it with rice. I used a small tortilla to soak up the beans & salsa. FAST, EASY,  HEALTHY, FULL FLAVOR!

I was so happy to find this recipe! Completely satisfying flavor from 6 ingredients or less (I didn't have cilantro on hand). AND, it's ridiculously EASY! From now on I'll make sure there's always a can of black beans & a jar of salsa in the pantry.

Good recipe, loved the flavor.  I used thin sliced chops as that's what I had on hand and they were a bit dry.  Will definitely use thicker chops next time as suggested in other reviews.

Surprisingly delicious and oh so easy. I added a cup of chicken broth directly to the skillet with the chops, salsa and beans, then a cup of instant brown rice and simmered until all was done. Served with tortilla chips. Will add this one to my go-to list of quick dinners.

have made this three times in last month. gave recipe to daughter and daughter in law. it is a HUGE hit in all our households. no changes seemed necessary, but may use some tips of other reviewers in the future. husband usually doesn't care for spicy foods so I use mild salsa, I just added my favorite hot sauce at table, along with cheese and sour cream. served over brown rice. big hit with all 9 of my family members.

I added a few things to make it a one pot meal..... some taco seasoning, a bit of dried jalapeño pepper, frozen corn, and an 8oz can of tomato sauce.  Topped with sour cream and cheese - new favorite!

I also make this with chicken, great both ways.  I use two cans of black beans, one not drained and one drained and rinsed.

All I can say is OMG!!! This is incredible. My wife ate 3/4 of what I made and she doesn't even like pork chops. Thank you for the recipe. BTW , I am allergic to Cilantro so I just left it out, it was still "the bomb"

I thought the pork chops would be tough but not at all and I did not put in cilantro for I don't like spices but it probably would have made it even better!

Loved this one pan meal! It's tasty and fast for a weekday dinner. I toss in a can of drained corn too with the beans and salsa. I have used chicken breast instead of pork chops and it works well too. I serve this over brown or white rice.

This was an easy, flavorful recipe even though I omitted the cilantro. I used seasoned black beans, homemade salsa and a package of 6 thin pork chops. My husband and 16 month old ate it right up!! Will definitely be making this again. I'd love to try this with chicken or beef.

I used 6 medium-sized pork loin cutlets, seared in an iron skillet with onion. Then added black beans and corn with liquid. Also 1/2 cup mango salsa and chopped cilantro. Set on low for 12 min., and served over brown rice. Delicious and only took 30 min..

Made is with boneless thick cut pork chops.  They were excellent and got rave reviews from the family.  Only had dried cilantro which seemed to work fine.  Also did not have enough  salsa so I used RoTel diced tomatoes and green chilis with a few table spoons of the salsa.  The pork chops were so tender and the whole dish was fantastic.  Served with yellow rice.  Highly recommended as yummy and easy!

This was great!  My husband who doesn't like pork even liked it. I took another reviewers advice and rubbed down the chops with spices other than pepper, I used a personal favorite called Chili 3000. I only had mild salsa on hand so I also tossed in a small can of green chilis to kick the heat up a notch. I will definitely make this again.

I've made this recipe twice now and I love the simplicity. The last time I added minced fresh garlic and cooked it with the chicken before adding the beans and salsa and it was even more delicious. It's a great weeknight recipe.

This was delicious!  Made a few changes as we like a lot of spice.  Sprinkled the chops with Adobo before browning, and also added a few red pepper flakes to the oil.  After browning, took the chops out of the skillet and sauted 1/2 chopped onion, 1/2 chopped green pepper, 1/2 jar mushrooms and 1/2 chopped jalapeno in the pan juices.  Added 2 cans black beans (drained), 2 cups salsa and the chops back to the skillet and simmered for 20 minutes.  Delicious served over rice, and a one-skillet meal as a bonus!

Added juice from one lime, a little chili powder, and a little smoked paprika and cayenne pepper.  Really liked this over rice because of all the sauce.  Quick and easy.  My chops were thin cut, so it only needed about 10 minutes after assembling everything and bringing to a boil.  Even the thick ones on second time took only 20 minutes.  Added cut up carrots second time to up the veggies with this one pot meal.  Also, brined the pork chops before cooking to help tenderize them.  I think this really made a difference.

I took this recipe and twisted it up a bit. I sautéed some onions, bell peppers and mushrooms with garlic before adding the chops. I also used chili Verde in place of salsa and served over Spanish rice...huge hit.

Delicious! I was looking for a quick weeknight dinner and to use up some pork chops I had, and this was perfect. I made some substitutions based on what I had available; no cilantro and boneless pork chops. I seasoned the chops with some cumin, garlic powder and lots of pepper. I also tossed a drained can of corn in with it. It cooked in about 20 minutes, since the chops were pretty thin and I served it over some brown rice. I adored it, and my husband thought it pretty good. Easy to make, and I'm sure it will make great leftovers!

So easy to make. This was delicious! I only had two large bone-in pork chops but used the same amount of ingredients and it turned out perfectly!

This was very good and very easy. My kids loved it. Even my son, who's not a big fan of beans, ate all of what was on his plate. This is also ridiculously easy!

this turned out much better than I thought it would. After reading through the other reviews I decided to follow one or two suggestions. I dredged the chips in flour, rubbed them with S&P, cumin and garlic powder then fried them for a few minutes on each side. I put them in a casserole dish, covered them in black beans, a can of mexicorn, sliced onion and salsa, covered with foil then baked for 30 min at 400. It was juicy and so flavorful!!

I made this recipe as written however I did tweak it a little for our taste. The nice thing about cooking with salsa is a person can make a dish as spicy hot or mild as they choose depending on the salsa bought. I made this dish for two servings. The only tweaks I did was use a whole can of black beans instead of half a can and dry cilantro instead of fresh. The meal was easy to make and very tasty. Both my wife and I enjoyed this and I will definitely make it again.

This had great flavor!  I used boneless pork chops because they were on sale.   Cooking them only about half of the recommended time in this recipe, they were good.  I added garlic powder to the pan as they cooked and extra cilantro before serving them.  I will definitely make this again.

This is an exceptional recipe. It was easy to fix, and the combination of flavors and textures make it stand out from a sea of often boring recipes. In addition, I didn't have to modify the recipe in any way: it was already glutin free!

I have made this dish several times its delicious an so very easy to make. I am not a fan of cilantro so I just skip that. My kids like it a little spicy so I had a little pepper to spice it up. Also added a little roasted corn to the pot.

Great, easy recipe! I used turkey chops and seasoned them with a Cajun blend beforehand and dropped in some garlic. I also threw in a can of Rotel instead of salsa. It's a new family favorite!

I loved this. The only changes I made was I seasoned the pork with some white pepper as well, and when I added the salsa and beans, I also added some onions and jalepenos. I like my foods a bit more spicy, but this was absolutely delicious. I am 100% making this again.

I only had a 2.5 lb pork loin so I cut it into 4 thick pork chops. I used a medium hot salsa and spiced up the black beans slightly  with cumin, chili powder and dried cilantro. I served this on top of brown rice and it was fantastic!

I made this using the exact recipe, doubled (for 8 total thick pork chops), and it came out perfect!! The entire family enjoyed them! I also served over quinoa instead of rice to make it healthier. I think the quinoa absorbs a lot of the salsa-bean mixture.

I made this just like the recipe called for and it lacked any real flavor. I served it with spanish rice and the beans/salsa/rice mix was good but the pork chops were just blah. It needs some spice.

After browning the pork chops and adding the salsa and beans, I only had to let it simmer for about 5-10 minutes. I love this recipe, will probably use it again in the near future.

The only thing I did differently was use 8 thin, boneless pork chops. They were buy one get one free, and I couldn't pass up that deal. Also, we love cilantro, so I used extra - about 1/4 cup. Otherwise followed the instructions exactly. My husband had been hinting that he wanted pork chops (which I never make), and he really enjoyed this recipe.

I cooked this in a crockpot. My chops were frozen so I cooked on high for about 3 hours then turned to low for over an hour (just to keep it warm). I used a quart of homemade salsa and I rinsed a can of black beans. I made a box of Rice-a-roni Spanish using 1cup of water and 2 cups of the salsa mix from the pot. I can't believe my husband ate this, and really liked it too!

This was great. I put in crock pot on low for 5 hours. Meat was falling a part. I also added a can of drained corn. Next time I'll double the beans but only the juice from one can is needed. It made a lot of juice  I seasoned meat with chili garlic cumin and onion powder.

Delicious! I followed the recipe pretty closely, the only thing I added was corn. I pan-seared the pork chops (seasoned with Tony's, garlic salt, and pepper), then put it all together and baked it in the oven at 250 for 2 hours. Turned out perfect!

I really liked this recipe for it's flavor, simplicity of ingredients and versitility to be able to add or take away ingredients, too. I've made this 3 times and followed the recipe exactly the first time...turned out really good. The 2nd time I added tomato paste, cummin and oregano, to taste, to the beans and salsa (for the salsa I used Rotel's canned tomatoes every time), and I used boneless chops the 2nd time,  because  that's what was on sale, instead of bone in like I used the first time. The 3rd time I added some canned diced green chiles to it and used boneless chops again, because,  you guessed it, that's what was on sale. The 2nd and 3rd times we doubled the beans and salsa, simply because we like more beans to go with it. I loved it all three times and I'm making it again in 2 days. It just throws together quick and easy and everyone I've made it for, likes it. 

Oh,  and  we had white rice, tortillas and garden salads to go with this dish, all 3 times. Mmmm good...haha!

This recipe is very flavorful as written.  TIP: I found the sauce to be too strong, so I removed the chops, "diluted" the sauce & beans with rice (to taste) and placed the chops back on top.
Very good!

This was wonderful, & very easy & quick.  I used boneless pork chops because I had them on hand.  I will definitely make this dish again because my family devoured it!

This was very flavorful. I used boneless pork loin chops cut an inch thick. I actually served it over the spaghetti squash sauté recipe from this site. Yum!

Surprisingly good!  It's one of those recipes that going into it you really wonder if it is going to be all that great...but this one did not disappoint.  With the exception of topping with parm. cheese I made this to recipe.  Would like in the future to try some of the other reviewers suggestions, not that I think it would make it taste any better but might give it a little different flavor.

I made this last night for our family dinner and it was amazing! I went by the recipe although I did take someone else's suggestion in one of the other reviews and I added cumin and a bit of chili powder. Boy, did that create some wonderful flavor! I also added dried cilantro because I didn't happen to have any fresh on hand that time. Great meal, I'm definitely making it again!

What a wonderful and easy recipe! What I did different was added spices like cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, Sazon (Goya product sold in the ethnic isle), and salt while I cooked the chops. I also added fresh chopped onions to compliment the beans. I didn't have fresh cilantro but I had some dried cilantro which I added at the end. The smell alone was making my mouth water & my fiancé loved it. Thanks for sharing this great dinner recipe/idea. I'll definitely be making it again.

This is amazing! So easy. I did exactly what the recipe said except I placed it all in the crockpot and I seasoned the chops with salt, pepper and cumin. I used 2 inch thick chops. They were to die for after 6 hours on high. The only think I am changing is to add some salt. We practically licked our plates clean. 
You can't get any easier than this. Thanks for a fantastic recipe.

If you want to try something new besides just the old fried pork chops this is a great way to go, and so simple anybody could make it. Cheap also to feed a big family or friends coming over.

I seasoned the pork chops with smoked paprika, black pepper and garlic salt.  The smoked paprika added a wonderful smokiness that complimented the black beans very well.  At the 15 min mark, I added a small handful of finely shredded cheddar cheese and covered the pan for the last 5 min or so. I served it over parboiled rice with a side of pickled jalapenos.  Next time I will make sure I have a ripe avocado to eat along side this dish.  The cool creaminess of avocado would have gone perfectly.  My daughter asked for sour cream, another good idea!

UPDATE:  Made this dish again but this time added the juice of half a lime and two teaspoons of habanero hot sauce from Trader Joe's. Wow, it was even better. Served with sliced avocado and sour cream.  The pan was licked clean.  LOL.

I have made this a lot.  Sometimes I use cilantro, but if I don't have it it still tastes great.  I bake mine most of the time and it comes out nice and juicy.  Something that my husband always enjoys!

This was pretty good. Everyone cleared their plates. I always season my meat first with more than just pepper. I also added corn in the skillet. Will cook again! Thanks for the idea.

Followed the recipe for the most part, but added garlic and onion flakes to the chops before browning.   Then I added corn with the black beans.  This was a home run with my family!

Wanted to do something different with pork chops.  I had all the ingredients on hand, so gave this a try.  It was really good and very quick and easy.  My chops were very tender.  I served over rice.

This recipe was delicious! I will definitely be telling others. My 4 year old is a picky eater and after tasting my plate, he ask for his own. I did season my chops with Saazon all purpose season, cumin, and a lil Cajun seasoning for added spice along with black pepper and then followed instruction as listed. Serve with white rice.

SIMPLE, quick and delicious.  Followed recipe exactly and following other viewers suggestions I spiced up the chops a bit by rubbing in some Goya Seasoning with pepper and some chili powder on them.  Also, added a small can of corn at the end of cooking.  Served with Spanish Rice.  I used thin pork chops since that was all I had and I would reduce the cooking time to 20 min. the next time if the chops were thin.  Squeezing some lime juice on the dish when plated was a nice touch.  Thanks submitter.

We loved this delicious and easy recipe. I cooked it in a skillet on the stovetop, 25-30 minutes.  Served it over rice with shredded cheddar cheese on top. Yummy!!!!

Followed recipe as is other than the pork chop seasoning, I used garlic salt and pepper.  This was easy and delicious.  I was concerned my husband wouldn't like it because he hates meat cooked in sauce (aka...any crock pot meal grrr) but he loved this!  So tender and simple.   I served with rice, yum!

We loved this just as it was. We did decide, that we could even add a second can of the beans and leave out the porchops for a great meatless dish. We did serve it over brown rice. I packed the leftovers for lunch and can't wait to have it a second time.

To lower the salt content, I drained and rinsed the black beans, replacing the liquid with tomato juice.

This was delicious, fast, and super easy!  I followed the recipe as written but used thin boneless pork chops, 1 can Goya low-sodium black beans, and  a little more than 1 cup of Mrs. Renford's peach salsa and added cilantro.   I topped it with shredded Monterey Jack and my son and husband both loved it too.

I'm a 30 year old man.  This is possibly the first real entre I've done without help.  It went great.  Just followed the recipe and everyone agreed that it was hearty and delicious.  Didn't have any cilantro, but it still tasted good.  Thanks AllRecipes.com!

Deeeelish! I used boneless chops and I probably didn't need to cook the entire 25 minutes because boneless take less time. Next time I will cook them about 15 minutes. I used a black bean salsa with corn as the salsa. Definitely use this type of salsa if you can. I also used taco seasoning in place of cilantro and it was perfect. Then I topped it off with grated cheese and sour cream. It was a bit liquidy so I am going to chop up the leftover chops and it will become Mexican chili.

Loved this recipe, I did add chili powder and a little bit of garlic powder and onion powder and I used boneless thin pork chops. I think since I used the thinner chops It didn't need to cook as long so they were pretty tough. The flavor was awesome though. I also served it with homemade Mexican rice. My hubby like it also which is a plus since he doesn't usually like the way I cook pork chops. Next time I think I'm going to try what others have said and try it in the crockpot.  Very good!

Very nice dish! My wife and I both really enjoyed this recipe. I added a few things as usual. I didn't have fresh cilantro so used dried instead. I used canned (chip) salsa, which I was really hesitant about doing, but it sure made preparation super easy and it tasted great. I also added some liquid smoke and a third of a habanero pepper for some additional heat. I'll definitely be making this dish again.

Really easy to make. Definitely have to be in the mood for a mexidish. We made it with basmati and sprinkled a little cheese on it. Definitely use salsa to taste and add fresh veggies. I also used black beans with chili spices and lime juice. Will make it again!

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great! Chops were very moist and tender. Served over my Uncle Ben's rice. Will serve  with fresh lime next time.

My husband LOVED this dish!  I only had spiced black bean & thick cut port chops; but, they worked perfectly.  Hubby won't eat cilantro - so no cilantro.  Most definitely over rice.

Really liked this recipe. I made it as the recipe said but put it in my slow cooker after browning pork chops. Served with mashed potatoes with the sauce as gravy and some grated cheese on top. Cooked on high about 3 hours.

Made this last night for my husband and I.  We only used 2 pork chops, but otherwise, I did everything else as per instructions.    I served it over rice and added some red pepper flakes while it was cooking.  SO YUMMY!!  I will admit, I was a bit skeptical, but it was great!!  My husband really liked it too!  This one is going into our rotation of favorite meals! Yummy!!

Made this tonight and would give it a 6 for ease! The taste was pretty good for something a little different. Next time I will follow the advice of others and add some other seasoning to the pork before I brown it. I served it over rice, which was great with the beans and to soak up the remaining "sauce." (it is a little watery) This is so easy, I am sure I will be making it again! Thanks!

My fiancé has become super picky lately but he just loved this. The only thing I did different was extra cilantro and only one can of beans. Excellent!

I doubled the pork.  I added the following:
one can of white beans drained, 
one green pepper chopped,
four small colored peppers chopped,
One onion chopped,
One can mushrooms drained,
Doubled the salsa,
One can stewed tomatoes,
One can tomatoe sauce,
A teaspoon of dried chillies,
A teaspoon chili seasoning,
A teaspoon of ground red chipotle,
Two tablespoons brown sugar,
One package of taco seasoning.

Browned the pork, put it in the slow cooker, added the above ingredients, and set on medium high (4).

This was an unusual recipe for me and my family I never would have thought to add the ingredients together the way I did but it turned out GREAT I used all of the ingredients except the cilantro and it was served over white rice. I will definitely keep this in my cook book.

I make this every week for my husband who is on a low-carb diet. I double the amount of beans and salsa and he eats it throughout the week.

I season the chops with s&p as well as onion powder. I also add about a t of onion powder to the salsa/beans.
It's really delicious and inexpensive. Works with chicken and stew meat,too!

This has quickly become a family favorite and we make it once a week.  Very simple.  We season the pork with salt, pepper, cumin, onion and garlic powder.  The beans are delicious and one can isn't enough.

Wow!  I was looking for a new way to enjoy pork chops and this is exactly what I was looking for.  So simple, soooo yummy!  I didn't have cilantro, but it did have Victoria cilantro medium salsa.  Mixed that with a can of kidney beans and it was delicious!  Will definitely make again and again.  Next time I will season the pork chops before I brown them and it is not necessary to cook for 20 to 35 minutes unless you like yours dried out.  I browned them quickly on high and simmered, covered for 10 minutes.

This was almost too easy.  I didn't have any salsa so threw in a diced tomato and added a few dashes of hot sauce.  My pork chops were only about 2/3 of an inch thick so they cooked through in about 10 minutes.  Very quick and easy!  Will make this again.

Having read the reviews I was looking forward to making this last night.  I shopped in the morning and then something came up that would make it easier to crockpot the meal.  It really took no time at all to season and brown chops.  I had already made my own chipotle salsa so it was in the pot in 15 minutes tops.  Cooked 3hrs on low and these chops were about an inch thick.  Just great served over yellow rice.  Thanks for this delicious easy dinner!

This recipe is quick, easy and tasty. Good week night meal bc it uses ingredients that I always have in my pantry. I used thin boneless chops bc that is what I had. As per other reviewers I will season the chops with cumin next time I make this

Great recipe! I seasoned the pork chops with cumin and black pepper and added fresh garlic and onions while I was browning the pork. The one think I would do differently is drain a little of the water out of the can of beans, as it was a little runny and we did not accompany it with rice.  But overall a delicious recipe I will make again!

This dish is simple, quick and absolutely delicious. I only used two pork chops and regular parsley instead of cilantro.  And after reading other reviews I did add a bit of seasoning to the chops (cumin and chili powder).  The chops were good but the beans (paired with rice) was phenomenal!!!

My daughter and I were split here, her a 4 and me a 5.  She said she loved it but only a 4 because there are other ways she likes it better.  Yes, there are other ways that are great but this is an excellent recipe when you're wanting the chops a different way.  Plus, the reason I picked this one was because I was making Sweet Jalapeno Cornbread and thought this would match up good.  Yes, it did, great match-up.  I didn't put this over rice though since I had the cornbread.  So I give it a 5 for it being perfect for what I needed and it tasted great also!

Amazingly simple using basic ingredients I never thought to combine. I'm on the Virgin diet and was looking for new ways to combine the staples I've been eating regularly. This was perfect! My changes: boneless pastured-fed pork loin,  added garlic and basil (frozen cubes from Trader Joe's) while the oil is heating, 1/4 diced Serrano pepper, thick sliced red onion, and frozen kale added at the same time as the salsa and black beans. One of my favorites and keeps well if you make it the night before for lunch the next day. Super cheap and easy to customize. I prefer cooking the way it's listed,  but it works surprisingly well in the crock pot.

I tried this for dinner tonight.  OMG it was so good.  My husband also loved it.  It is a keeper.
I used fresh salsa that I had made the day before.  Used bone in pork chops, I like them  better then boneless.
It was very fast and easy to make.  Would not change a thing, other then seasoning the chops with garlic salt, and cummon.  I am going to try this next time using chicken.  Thank you for the recipe.

Wow! Yummy! The chops turned out much more tender than they usually do for me. This recipe was easy to make and really delicious! I used thin cut chops, seasoned them first with pepper, cumin, onion and garlic powder, and Mrs Dash Fiesta Lime. I prepared my own salsa (search Fresh Tomato Salsa on this site) and added a little bit of El Pato sauce for some heat.  Served it with mexican style rice.

I did make a few changes.  I seasoned my pork chops with chile powder, onion and garlic powder and black pepper. Used crock pot put pork in uncooked.  My pork chops were about 1 inch thick bone in for extra flavor. I also used Bush's Black Bean fiesta and served over rice.  Yummy!

I knew when I read over the ingredients and preparation this would be a fantastic, quick, healthy meal and boy did it live up to my expectations. Flawless. I have a favorite brand of grocery salsa but I am really, really going to try and make this only when I have homemade salsa on hand. I make several salsa recipes but my staple is Sarah's Salsa on this site. Simple recipes like this are best with high-quality ingredients, in my opinion. I made exactly as directed but with chicken instead of pork just because I had it thawed. I now have this saved in my "add-a-protein" folder because I think it could be good with any meat, even cooked leftovers (especially grilled!). Thank you so much for sharing!!!

It was okay, nothing special. Probably not something I will make again. Sadly, I even seasoned the pork very generously to ensure a bit more flavor and it was just blah.

I make this multiple times a week, no joke. It's cheap and quick which is perfect for a college student. Made it for one of my picky eater roommates annnd it made him like pork enough to where he's going to try and make it for himself and his boyfriend now. Only change I make is to season my pork with some cumin and I sometimes use canola oil but that's it. Turns out great every time.

Wow!  I was so scared that this would turn out bland and it didn't!  It probably matters the kind of salsa you use and I had the good stuff on hand. My skillet is big so I used 3T of Olive Oil, then I was scared it would be oily, but it wasn't.  Also, I only had dried cilantro...it probably would have been zestier with fresh...next time!  But it was so good this time, I can't wait to try fresh!  OH, I did salt the pork chops as well as pepper and could taste it in the final product and was glad I did...I would definitely recommend it.

It was yummy but I added adobo seasoning and cumin along with pepper to my pork chops before browning. I added some chopped garlic to the bean salsa mixture and simmered for an hour so the meat was fork tender. Lastly I added corn right before taking off the heat. The combo of the smoky and sweet with the cilantro definitely took it up a notch!

This was great a one skillet dinner,if you try this one think about adding a half cup of black and green olives chopped,red and green bell peppers for color and flavor,heaping teaspoon minced garlic and chopped onion and lets not forget half teaspoon of crushed red pepper and ground cumin. I cut the pork into one inch pieces scooped over brown rice served with sliced cuban bread. i tripled the recipe and had almost no left overs it was so good the kiddo's ate it up

Had a good taste, but my chops came out dry.  Next time I think I'll use country style ribs and throw them in the slow cooker.  I seasoned my chops with salt, pepper, garlic powder, cumin and chili powder.  Used diced tomatoes with chilies instead of salsa.  Will try this one again.

Delicious, easy and quick. Love this treatment for pork chops, never one of my favorite meats, but this is oh, so good! Make sure to season the chops prior to cooking, then it all comes together quick and filling.

Soooo good. I threw it all in the crock pot (on high for 3 hours) and served it over spanish rice. Next time I'll add two cans of beans, because they were a huge hit!

My family and I love this recipe, it is simple and flavorful. I've made it without the cilantro and still has a wonderful flavor. I highly recommend serving it over rice as shown in the picture.

This was an easy, really tasty meal. I was surprised at how all the flavors melded together, and best of all, it took all of 10 minutes to prepare. Delicious. I will try with chicken next time.

Definately a DO AGAIN!  I seasoned my chops with cilantro and cumin & salt and pepper first then threw in the beans and salsa... Ohh and I seasoned it with Mrs. Dash Southwest Chipotle seasoning.. was soooo great! - Served it with basic white rice and brocolli on the side.

Easy and tasty. Like other readers, I rinsed the black beans before using to reduce sodium. I also added a bit of diced pineapple to sweeten the dish and served it with Johnny cakes instead of rice. Yum.

This was so easy and very tasty.  I seasoned the pork with a bit of Cajun seasoning, garlic powder and some pepper.  The pork was a little flavorless if eaten without the bean mix.  We may try cutting the meat up before cooking it just to help the flavors mingle more.  We also didn't have any cilantro and found it tasted just fine without.

This was absolutely delicious!  Such a nice southwest twist to pork chops.  I used the boneless pork chops and medium heat salsa.  The medium added just enough spice and my daughter was still able to eat it.  I cut up the pork chops and mixed it all with some brown rice, which was AMAZING!

Very tasty. I did make a few changes though. I sprinkled the uncooked pork with taco seasoning. I also drained the beans and reduced the salas a bit since it was going it the slow cooker. It wasn't very runny and tasted great over rice.

I searched for a dish with pork chops & black beans & this is the only recipe that came up.  It was fabulous, so easy too!  The flavor was great & the pork chops were so tender.  I will use this again!  I also served it over rice & we had a salad, yummy!

This was GREAT!  I was searching for recipes to use cilantro from our garden, and this fit the bill. The only change I made was I seasoned the pork with taco seasoning (taco seasoning 1 from this site), served with white rice.  The cilantro makes this dish!

Very Nice! Easy to prepare - pork chops came out super tender. I used boneless butterfly pork chops and they were fine. Served with rice made it vaguely reminiscent of beans and rice.
