SERVING SIZE NOTED IS INCORRECT. This recipe makes 12 - 1/2 cup ramekin servings. I will again see if I can get A.R. to change. My apology.

This is a delicious dessert!  Such a nice, subtle maple flavor - not too sweet.  I did add one step to it, though.  After it had chilled and just before serving, I sprinkled turbinado sugar on top of each custard and used my kitchen torch to melt and brown for a crispy, sweet topping.  Perfection!

I changed the serving size to 4 servings but used three eggs versus 2 3/4 no further changes were made in the ingredients.  However, I baked in Pyrex custard cups versus ramekins for 55 minutes.  For decorative purposes only, I melted about 1/4 cup of chocolate morsels and made little heart designs on parchment paper, allowed them to harden and then lifted off and placed on top of the cool custard. This is a really simple and easy custard - not too sweet but with the subtle taste of maple syrup. Definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing Linda (LMT)! By the way, this was the Buzz AR Recipe Group selection for week of April 20, 2013.

Wonderful and soooo easy. Just be sure and bake in shallow dishes, otherwise it does not set.

This is a very nice, simple recipe.  I am trying to watch my diet but I still like treats sometimes, so I changed this by using a good quality sugar free syrup and skim milk.  Those changes gave a nice product with half the calories of the original version, per serving (about 105 calories / 1/6 of the recipe).  Thanks for this easy recipe!

Recipe Group selection 4/20/13.  Super easy to make and very satisfying.  I do suggest using real maple syrup to get the best result.  I got four 3/4 cup servings from half a recipe.  Thanks for sharing, Linda.

Delicious and velvety.
I pre-boil the water before adding to the baking dish and custards are perfectly set at 35 min.
Avoid using B or no.2 Grade maple syrup in this dish or the maple flavour will be overpowering

I thought it was a 4-star recipe, but my wife declared it awesome, so I'm awarding five stars.

I halved the recipe and, as others have reported, this yielded four 3/4 cup servings.

I had to leave the custard in the oven for about 60 minutes before it had set up sufficiently.

For my tastes, the recipe would benefit from a higher percentage of maple syrup, but my opinion seems to be in the minority in this regard.

Many thanks to Linda/LMT for posting this recipe!

Recipe Group Selection:  20, April 2013 ~ Nice, delicious, simple dessert.  We loved the mild taste from the pure maple syrup.  I cut the recipe down to a forth batch and baked in a toaster oven.  It was so nice and creamy and definitely “company worthy”.  Thanks Linda, for sharing your yummy dessert with all of us.

Perfect for my Mom who fighting brain cancer.  Often this is the only thing she can eat.  I change the amount of maple syrup to 1/4 cup to keep the sugar level low and increase the number of eggs to 6 for extra protein.

There is something  very wrong with this recipe. I cooked it for a good hour and it never set up as it should have.  Very disappointed - it remained watery.   The flavor was OK, but the texture was nothing I would serve to guests.  The cook's notes and directions conflict regarding the size  of the ramekins. 3 cups of milk mixture certainly cannot be contained in six 1/4  cup ramekins. Nor can 3 cups of milk fill six 1 cup containers or 12 half cup containers.

I altered the recipe to add more protein. I used 6 eggs and 2 1/2 cups milk, one tsp vanilla extract and topped with freshly ground nutmeg!!  I really like using healthy maple syrup instead of sugar!!
