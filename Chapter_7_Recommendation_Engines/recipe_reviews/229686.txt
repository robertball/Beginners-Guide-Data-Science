It was great, we upped the peppers but we like it spicy. We also cooked it all in one step, on low for 6 hours and it turned out great. Viva Peru!

Most of my family loved it. The heat was beautiful. My daughter didn't care for it but she's a spice wuss, so don't put to much stock in that. After tasting it, I decided to throw some sour cream in, to soften the heat. It worked but I'm sure it's no longer Adobo Arequipeno.

I didn't have the red peppers, but I used pickled peppers instead. The meat was fork tender, not too spicy, served over tomato rice with a dollop of sour cream- this is a keeper!
