Just served to 30-40 at office party and it's all gone.  Already had 3 requests for the recipe.  Thanks Judith wherever you are!  There were a lot of lackluster recipes out there and this one had more to it!

My guests really liked this, but... too sweet. My good hubby, who volunteered to mix it, thought he was halving the sugar, but thank goodness he only put the proper amount! Good recipe; just needs less sugar. (UPDATE! GREAT IDEA!! We had quite a bit of leftover punch, which I froze--hate to waste anything--and the kids took it out and scooped it for dessert. Wow!!!  I am going to try this on purpose, still with less sugar, because it was almost syrupy. Like a granita. I will stir a bit while freezing, and this time LEAVE more SPACE in freezer container for expansion!) Also, for double punch recipe I used 1/4 less sherbet and it was fine.

We couldn't get enough of this at my daughter's baptism.  Awesome!  We didn't make any substitutions.

I make this using Crystal Light - thereby eliminating the sugar and I make an ice ring in my jelly mold with sugar free soda (regular won't freeze solid & it won't dilute the punch like regular ice) you can put fruit into the jelly mold also and it looks even prettier.

I have made this a couple of times now and love the flavor.  Lime and pineapple together are very refreshing.  As written, I give this 4 stars because the sugar is way too much.  This time I made a double batch and only used 3 cups total.  This was perfect for us.  So give this one a try but add your sugar to taste not as the recipe states.  Also, when I made it this time I could not find any unsweetened drink mix that was just lime so I used lemon-lime and it was still great.

Made this for a baby shower and everyone loved it! Tried to make it blue by using blue lemonade Kool-Aid for the drink mix, but it turned the most beautiful shade of green.  Think I'll have to make this again for a St. Patrick's party!

This punch is super yummy and so easy to make!  I have made it for work and home parties.  We made it for halloween and added a frozen hand (made out of a non-powdered latex glove!).

Excellent. halved the recipe and cut down on the sugar a little. Also added a few drops of green food coloring to accentuate the color.

This worked great!  I served it at my son's 3rd birthday party.  The Monster Truck "Gravedigger" was the theme, so this was his Gravedigger Juice.  Not only did it look AMAZING and matched perfectly, it tasted AMAZING too!!

Super sweet but still good. I think I would use less or even no sugar next time. I served it at my St. P's play date. I only put 1 liter of the carbonated beverage and let moms choose to either top their punch off with champagne or more soda.

This was a fun drink to make for St Patrick's Day. I had a gathering for some friends that work in the evening so I wanted something different and non alcoholic for them.  It was really great.   I did follow the advice of some other reviews and I did not add as much sugar to the mix. I also added some green food coloring to make it a little deeper green.  Fun Drink thanks for the idea.  For my drink mix I used one pouch of the Crystal Light to go drink mixes and I think it was wonderful.  My guests really enjoyed the festive drink!

I loved the taste and appearance of this punch. I gave a "Mexican" style bridal shower and served this punch for the first time. It was a hugh hit and blended in so well with the theme.

Tasty, very sweet. I like the previous reviewer's idea of freezing leftover punch to use as dessert.

This is a great recipe although it is too sweet. I only used half the sugar the second time I made it and it came out perfect kids as well as adults really enjoyed it
