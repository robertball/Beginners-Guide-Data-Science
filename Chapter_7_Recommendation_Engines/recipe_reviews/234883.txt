My entire family loved this soup. Super healthy and simple to make. I added a couple stalks of celery just because it was on hand. I think next time i will add a few more cups of Kale. Great way to get the youngens to eat it :) My teen loved it

Delicious and so good for you. I used only 1 can of tomatoes as I ran out of room in the pot and I think it's fabulous. Also, not sure it needs the beans...they're not bad but I don't know that I will add them again. All in all this is fabulous, reasonably easy to make and healthy!

Used curry powder.  Couldnâ€™t find paste.  A little more shrimp and added a couple stalks celery just because.  Big hit

This was great! Lots of flavor and texture!  Super healthy...I used only one can of diced tomatoes and I cut up 3 fresh ones to add instead of a second can.   This helps reduce the overall sodium. Will definitely make again!

Loved this recipe. Didn't have beans on hand, so I crumbled up some tortilla chips to add a little thickness. Absolutely lovely flavor.
