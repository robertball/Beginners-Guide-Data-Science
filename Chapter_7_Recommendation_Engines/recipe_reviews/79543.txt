really easy and yummy!
IMPORTANT NOTE: if you want it to taste like true restaurant style, you need to put the rice only in a pot over high heat and stir it around for about 5 minutes or so before cooking. it helps the grains of rice to stay separate (more like restaurant style) and less sticky. i also used frozen peas/carrots from a bag..worked great!

This is a great recipe! The only thing I want to add is that to get that authentic "taste" of restaurant fried rice, you should add about half a bottle of Oyster Sauce. Easily found in the asian section at the grocery store. Back off on that much if it tastes too strong, but after years of living in Japan and trying many versions of fried rice recipes, oyster sauce is the ticket!

I found this quite tasty after a few adjustments.  I cooked it in beef broth instead of the water and added a little minced garlic, grated ginger, sesame oil and green onions!  Just like the restaurant!!  Yum!

I like the ingredients, and the finished dish is fine with some cooking method changes.  Start with your rice cooked and COLD.  Not necessary to cook the peas at all.  Don't scramble the eggs with the vegetables -cook them separately in a small saute pan like a crepe.  Once cooled, roll the thin egg pancake up like a cigar, then cut it into shreds, chiffonade-style. I also added some chopped green onion and small, cooked shrimp.  Small but important preparation changes result in a better, 4-star outcome.

I truly liked this recipe, but I found that it is 100% necessary to prepare the rice a day ahead of time.  That extra day is everything to this recipe, in my opinion.

My first attempt ever at fried rice and it was really good. I took the advice of others and used frozen pea's and carrots, I heated the wok and used olive oil sauteed 1/2 onion then added veggies then rice, to be exact I used 1/3 c. soy sauce, and it was plenty for our taste. My husband really liked it and ate nearly half of what I made. Thanks for a great recipe, will make again.

I have learned that I must double or even triple this recipe because everyone who tries it...can't get enough of it! It is better than any restaurant I've ever been to! The only change I have made is to boil the rice in Chicken or Beef broth, it really brings out the flavor! I only use frozen mixed veggies too. Last night I even added a can of Tiny Shrimp. Absolutely Delicious! This is an amazing recipes! Thanx Jostrander!

I was in a hurry the first time I made this, so I didn't check the reviews like I usually do before I try something new. I have to admit when following the instructions as written, I really wasn't impressed.  Frying the rice after cooking it made it very glutanous and the soy to taste left me feeling like I was guessing.  Today I went back read the reviews and tried again and this time I loved it.  1.) Mixed 1/3 c. lite soy, several drops of sesame oil (or oyster sauce), and 3 2/3c. chicken broth in a large measuring cup and set aside.  2.) Rinsed the rice in a colander under cold running water for two minutes to wash off some of the gluten.  3.)  Heat 1/4c. canola oil in a heavy bottomed pan over med. high heat and add rinsed rice.  Stir constantly until golden.  4.) Add the soy/broth mixture, cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes.  5.) In a separate pan, fry the eggs, heat the peas and carrots and any other add ins. Set aside.  6.) Add the egg mixture to the rice when the rice is done.  For us, frying the rice before adding the liquids really does make all the difference.

This is my default fried rice recipe as I like the carrot/pea combo, but any meat/veggie can be added to make it a meal in itself.  Usually I use leftover rice, shred the carrots and leave the peas frozen as they thaw rather quickly.  For the eggs, I don't scramble them; instead I mix the eggs with a bit of water/pepper/soy then leave them to cook flat in the pan.  When cooked through, I roll the circle o' egg up and cut chiffonade-style, adding the shreds to the pan after seasoning the rice and veggies with soy sauce.  Any way it's made, it's all good... thanks!

This rice recipe is indeed 'restaurant' style.  The sesame oil should be made mandatory rather than being optional.  It really gives the impression that you're tasting Chinese fried rice.  I will definitely do this recipe again.  I may just include chopped mushrooms the next time I'll prepare this dish.

My family loves this recipe, the only thing I do differently is to cook the rice a day ahead and put it in the fridge until ready to use.  This makes the rice less sticky and more "restaurant style"!

I read other reviews & was hesitant to make this. I did make some modifications. I cooked some fresh chopped shrimp & garlic in the oil before adding the peas & carrots. I also cooked my rice (brown rice) with some beef boullion as someone else had suggested. This was great! I will make this often.

I made some minor changes based on the reviews and it turned out fabulous!  I made the rice ahead of time and allowed it to chill in the refrigerator.  I used frozen mixed vegetables. I did not boil these but simply rinsed under cold water, drained and then stir fried them with about 3 cloves of minced garlic and about a teaspoon of minced ginger before adding in the rice. I beat the eggs slightly and then in a separate fry pan cooked them without scrambling. When finished I put them on a cutting board and sliced into strips.  I really hate recipes that say add to taste. What the heck does that mean anyway?  So I added about 1/3 cup of soy sauce, 2 teaspoons of sesame oil and 2 teaspoons of  oyster sauce.  My hubby went back for seconds raving about how good this was and then ate the leftovers for lunch the next day raving again  about how terrific this fried rice was.  This is now on my regular rotation for Meatless Mondays and side dishes.  Thanks for posting a really great recipe.

the KEY to fried rice is using leftover, COLD, cooked rice. This is the only way....

My son loved this rice but I made a few changes as well. I added some leftover rotisserie chicken (so it could be a complete meal), a small can of mixed peas & carrots, onion, and a dash of red pepper and 1 1/2 tbsps of soy sauce. 

*Now here's the fun part....before serving it to my 6 year old son, I put his portion in a large funnel, then flipped it out onto his plate to make a "volcano". You can use shreaded carrots, duck sauce, or a bit of tomato sauce to put near the top of the cone to appear as lava!!! This is one of his absolute favorites!!!

I rate this recipe 2 out of 5 stars, for the following reason:  This recipe calls for too much water to cook the rice.  For traditional fried rice, you need to use equal amounts of water and rice - for 2 cups, you should also add 1 tsp of sea salt to the water.  By having a "drier" rice, it will absorb even more of the oil and flavorings and have the texture of true fried rice from a restaurant.  Also, where are the bean sprouts?!   The addition of sprouts adds a very pleasant crunch and additional texture.  Please share this with your readers.  Bon appetit!

Two problems with this recipe:
Water needs to be reduced to 3 cups.  Using a ratio of 1-1/2 water to 1 rice will help keep the rice grains separate.
Secondly, rinse the excess starch off of the rice.  Put the rice in your pot, fill with cold water and stir.  Drain the rice.  Repeat at least once.  The excess starch acts like glue when cooked making the rice clump up more.

A good basic recipe on which to build.  I do think one should also add onion and/or scallion, always. I like using dark soy sauce when available. I also add ground ginger, a bit of minced garlic, ground white pepper, and a soupcon of oyster sauce, and when available, a bit of fermented black bean paste.  I like using basmati rice, prepared the day before, and allowed to cool overnight in the refrigerator. In preparing the basmati, brown the uncooked rice very lightly in oil before adding the water to prepare it. As to the oil used, peanut is the most authentic, though canola or (for health-conscious folks) grapeseed oil (available in the Kosher foods section at WalMart, for example).  Other oils-- including corn and even soybean, as well as olive-- are too strongly (or inauthentically) flavored. The sesame oil should be the dark variety, not the light, and go easily with it since it is very strongly flavored-- too much will be overwhelming to the more delicate flavors.  If one likes the dish hotter than  the white pepper will make it (and white pepper has less bite but more heat than black), one can add Szechuan pepper, if available. Or one can add hot capsicum-derived pepper.
   To do it right one really needs a gas stove, where one can get the temperature of the wok locally VERY high... in restaurants I have observed the chefs actually letting the oil flame a little, though I do not advise this at home! But the high heat, apparently, is of the essence.
    Bon appetit!

A really good base recipe! I would note that it's best to use leftover rice, or rice that has been given enough time to get COLD in the fridge to firm up - makes it come out less sticky and gooey. I would also add that Sesame Oil is a MUST, as is Oyster Sauce (enough to coat). I will use frozen peas and carrots again, but instead of boiling them, I'll just run them under cold water to allow them to thaw. Everything seemed too mushy to me. And ginger and garlic are a must, as well! A great way to keep it simple, I just wanted to kick it up a notch. Thanks for sharing! :)

I usually make my own fried rice but thought I would find a recipe and learn how to "do it the right way".  I'll go back to my old way; saute chopped onions and garlic, add left over STEAMED rice, fry with just enough soy sauce to you liking. Spread rice mixture to make a little empty spot in the center. Drop 1-2 eggs to scramble in the middle and then mix all together. That's it!

I've been making fried rice like this for years. The only thing different you need to do is either fry the uncooked rice in a little oil before adding water and bringing to a boil or use day old rice. By toasting the rice, you keep it separated more so it isn't as sticky. I typically use shredded cabbage and wedges of onion in my veggies that I add too. Sometimes I add spinach or sweet peppers. You really can add anything but carrots and peas are the standard for most restaurants. I also sometimes cook my rice in broth so it is more flavorful.

I made this for dinner tonight and we all loved it! I added oil to a  pan, added diced onion and 2 cloves of garlic. When fragrant, I scrambled two eggs and then added 1 cup of mixed veggies. When the veggies were heated through, I added the rice and cooked until warm. I added a couple of Tbsp of oyster sauce and the same of soy sauce, finishing with  drizzle of sesame oil. The end result was absolutely delicious - better than any Chinese take-out I've had!

This recipe as written isn't bad, just lacking some key things.  You need to use day-old rice for fried rice otherwise it goes to mush quickly.  I usually mix my soy sauce, sesame oil and rice wine (a must) before adding to the rice.  I add the eggs at the end after making a"well" in the rice.  I just crack them in, season them with a little salt and pepper and break them into strips after they *almost* cook through.  A pinch of sugar and thinly sliced green onions mixed into the finished rice truly completes it.  It sounds strange but a pinch of sugar rounds out the flavour... try it, you'll like it.

I love fried rice! One of the most important things for me is to make rice not sticky, falling apart. So here's my trick: just fry dry rice on a dry pan before cooking! Heat a pan over medium, pour dry rice on it, stir until you hear popping sound. Let it cool down before the actual cooking! That's it! Your rice will be still delicious but separate as a true restaurant style dish :)

So I tried this recipe at the last minute and kept my fingers crossed.  I didn't have any enriched rice and brown rice would've taken too long, so I went w/ good ol' minute rice.  Cooked the rice in chicken broth as recommended. Used a cup of frozen peas and carrots.  Also added pre-cooked non-breaded cut up chicken tenders. It was a huge hit!  I was asked to make more tomorrow night and to make double so there would be leftovers.  My boys did rock paper scissors to see who would get the bit that I left in the pan.  One of my best throw-together dinners ever!

Yummy and simple, however, fried rice is best made with cold day old rice so that it doesn't clump together. Sometimes I add leftover cooked chicken or chinese sausage. Thanks!

My first time trying this! I read all the reviews and used cold cooked rice, added chopped garlic and green onion with a bag of frozen peas & carrots to the hot oil in the wok. Added the rice and  drizzled the soy sauce over as I stirred.Made a well and scrambled the eggs in the middle of the wok. I added some cooked chopped rotisserie chicken and a small amount 1/2 C of chicken broth to keep it from getting too dry. It was great and even better the next day warmed up! I'm going to try with shrimp next.I also added 1/4 C oyster sauce as one reviewer mentioned. Additional note: As I have made this many more times, I have found that adding chopped red pepper, onion and mushrooms to the saute step is fabulous! This is better than my local Asian restaurant!

A great recipe!! Used a lot of different tips from other users, including onion and garlic, frozen carrots and peas and definitely adding oyster sauce. I've already made it a few times. Last night I tried it with brown rice...still great.

This is a very good base recipe. Like others, I also used an 8 oz. bag of frozen mixed veggies (that I had thawed). And I took Tamisa's suggestion and added Oyster Sauce (4 tbsp.) I added on an additional egg, and used 2 tbsp. of the soy sauce and 1 tbsp. of the sesame oil. Perfecto!

As others have said, the sesame oil is the key, along with making the rice beforehand and letting it cool in the fridge for several hours. I added chopped green peppers, a whole one pound bag of frozen peas & carrots, and a pound of shrimp to make it a meal. This is the best fried rice I've ever had, at home or in a restaurant!

Use butter instead of oil and it will make it so much yummier! Also, use frozen pea and carrot blend- put in collander and run under hot water to thaw. Add 1 tablespoon water to eggs and beat before adding to pan.

I've made this recipe before using pretty much the same ingredients but added mushrooms to the mix, homemade sesame oil (just put about 1/4 cup of sesame seeds in a frying pan with about 1/2 cup of vegetable oil & heat up until fragrant) and I substituted brown rice for white rice and add pepper & ground ginger.  Superb!!!!!

Yum yum, this was pretty good! Only change I made was to use rice I had made a day in advance. Whenever I have rice leftover from dinner I usually fry it up the next day for lunch. Chilled rice tends to come out less mushy when you fry it, as opposed to freshly cooked rice. Also, I used a tad too much soy sauce- My mistake! Remember a little goes a long way!

OH MY GOODNESS!!!!! This is the best recipe ever! My husband and I love fried rice and often spend great deals of money at the restaurant. I don't think we will ever buy fried rice from the a restaurant again! Even my youngest son, the pickest of eaters, said it was better than the restaurant! So this one is definitely a keeper! I cooked this with a recipe for baked teriyaki chicken. The only thing I changed was the rice. I used 2-7oz. instant bags which took 10 min off cook time. I used sesame oil instead of veg. oil per other reviewer. Although I was a little skeptical, I also added oyster sauce as noted by a prev reviewer! We had it for dinner two nights in a row! Nobody complained! It's the best!

The rice has to be made a day in advance and stored in the fridge. No soy sauce, you're not steaming the rice, you're frying it. Basically, there's nothing about this recipe I like. Sorry.

Good recipe. I like the idea of adding garlic, ginger and I would also add sliced green onions. You may want to consider adding oyster sauce at the end of the cooking process rather than soy sauce. This will give it a dryer consistency. Also, the day old rice recommended by another reviewer is an excellent idea.

This was the easiest meal I have made in a long time.  It was so tasty and it appealed to my fried rice craving.  I chopped up some sliced turkey, added the onion and garlic as others had suggested, and found that I added a lot more soy sauce than just a "shake".  I also added salt and pepper to taste.  I doubled the recipe so I had leftovers for a long time, this recipe is good leftover.  I made my rice in my rice cooker and let it cool before making this recipe.  I also just used a frozen vegetable medley which included peas, carrots, corn and green beans, worked great!  I used my large electric skillet and it worked great.  If I didn't stir it all the time, the rice and ingredients would brown a little bit, which you also find in the restaurant fried rice.  The more browning, the better, I say!  This is an excellent basic recipe, easy to make, easy to modify to your taste, an awesome recipe to keep as a basic reference in your recipe file.

Very good, used brown rice instead of white and olive oil in place of vegetable oil, sauteed a little chopped onions added the rest of the ingredients and left out the sesame oil.

Used leftover white rice from the fridge and a frozen pea/carrot mix for the veggies. This was a hit at our house. i think it's important to scramble the eggs with the other ingredients in order to get a "restaurant-style" result.

made with a bag of steam fresh rice this is super quick and simple.  I made mine by heating a tbsp oil in a small skillet; added a bit of diced onion, celery, frozen peas and carrots and 2 eggs. Stirred a little soy sauce with the veggie and egg mixture and added a few sesame seeds when stirred into the rice. very tasty lunch!

This is the second time I have made this. I never add eggs because I don't like that part, but I do sprinkle ginger powder as per someone elses advice on here and I added onions, bamboo shoots, water chesnuts, steamed broccoli, peas and carrots. I use a few tablespoons of sesame oil and about 3/4 bottle of Kikkoman soy sauce. (5 ounce bottle) I steam my jasmine rice a day prior....almost a must.

I love oriental foods, but the salt and MSG from carryout are both something I stay away from. This is a great recipe. You cannot tell the difference. I like it as I can do what I want with what I have at the time. A cup of frozen mixed vegetables and thin sliced beef, chicken or shrimp added make it a healthy one dish dinner that takes no time to make and takes no time to eat it all...so double the recipe and perhaps you will have some leftover!

This was delicious!! I used jasmine rice and a gluten free soy sauce. I also added scallions. I sautéed them with the carrots and peas. TheToasted sesame oil is a must!  It gives it the extra flavor it needs. I would add one more egg next time.  Personally as good or better than restaurant style.

Delicious.  This is really versatile--I used asparagus, snow peas and ginger in mine along with 4 eggs fried omelet style in a separate pan.  Can't go wrong with this recipe!

It was good. Nothing out of the ordinary. But a perfect way to accompany something else.

I love this Recipe, like a few others I made some modifications, about 1/3 cup of oyster sauce, I also use frozen peas and carrots, and I like to stir fry some chicken breast as well and make it a whole meal.

This was also my first attempt making fried rice and boy am I ever glad I stumbled onto this recipe. It was sooooo good! I just used what I had - onions, sugar snap (frozen) peas, and canned mushrooms. I thought this was BETTER than a restaurant's! The oyster sauce and sesame seed oil make all the difference. I'm going to double this next time for leftovers. - Jude

As a general rule, the rice should be LEFTOVER, not freshly cooked. (20 yrs experience in Jpn) Onions are good, too. I was told the secret to fried rice is to saute it double what you think is good enuf!

Easy to make.  Tasty. Substituted coconut oil and still turned out good.  Also used frozen carrots and frozen peas.  Didn't use the sesame oil because I didn't have it available.

Great base recipe. Started with 2 T. canola oil and 2 T. sesame oil, 1 clove garlic..heated up, added 1/3 c. chopped pepper, then about the same chopped cabbage, then added in chopped chicken about 1/2 cup, 5 diced mushrooms, 3 green onions sliced thin and 1 shredded carrot and 3/4 c. frozen peas .. when most of that was cooked, a few minutes with stirring, dumped in 1 and 1/2 cups rice cooked to whatever amount it makes and at the same time stirred in previously whipped 2 eggs, 2 T. soya sauce and 2 T. oyster sauce combination.  The eggs were not even noticeable when cooked.  Hubby went back for seconds, and he's not the biggest eater. I forgot to use the chicken broth when cooking the rice, and that would be great too I'm sure.  We both ended up adding more soya sauce to the cooked product, but we like salty.  I used one reviewer's advice and cooked the rice on high for 5 minutes uncovered, then shut off heat and covered for 15 min, then cooled rice in freezer... worked great. As with any wok recipe, have ingredients pre-chopped and grouped according to hardness, adding the crisp ingredients first. Add whatever vegetables/meat additions you like, just group accordingly to hardest to cook first.

I made this for dinner the other night and it was a big hit. We like Japanese Steak Houses but don't go very often so I decided to make it at home. This rice was very similar to our local Japanese Steak House. I served grilled vegetable, steak, chicken and shrimp and made my own version of Yum Yum sauce. The kids had fun, the food was good and we saved $$$.

Sorry - I don't get it.  I added green onion, regular onion, sesame oil, garlic, mushrooms - and it still was bland - did NOT taste restaurant style at all.  I won't make this one again - there has to be some other ingredient that gives it that flavor....

Very nice! In the oil, before adding the vegetables, just throw in a pressed garlic seed, let it sizzle a little then add the veges!

I've made this a few times now. As is it is wonderful. I've done a lot of the same modifications that others have (ginger, garlic, hot peppers, sesame oil, oyster sauce) all to good effect, though not necessary. I also added some Thai curry paste that added a nice zing. But the one thing I did do that is pretty unusual (definitely not a Chinese thing) but added such a great flavor was this... I buy these canned Jalapenos with carrots and use them in a lot of things. For this recipe I chopped up several of them very small and mixed them in and they add so much delicious flavor. They don't have too much heat, either.

Great basic recipe, Cooked my rice in broth, julienne cut some bacon, then sauteed my carrots in the bacon fat followed by the rice. Topped it all off with some finely diced green onion.
No Leftovers!

Hi, I think it turns out a lot better if you first pre toast the rice with a little oil until the rice turns a white colour instead of the normal transparent colour. This way it`ll make so your rice doesn`t get so mushy. cook the rice just until soft, don`t wait until it`s very soft and splitting open. I like to save a step and when the rice is half cooked I add the carrota and peas and garlic chopped fine and even onion or some other vegetable. then when the rice is cooked, heat up just a little oil in the frying pan and add all the ingreadients with the soysauce.  I like to fry the egg separetly and cut it up , then add while frying the rice. It helps to keep the rice from mushing together. also if you like you can fry chicken breasts or beef and cut up and add too when you refry the rice with the soysauce. It comes out excellent!

This recipe needs some tweeking. Make sure your rice is cold before frying.Heat your olive oil, when you think its hot enough make it hotter.In other words it has to be super hot(olive oil is one oil that wont burn). I fry my eggs separate(don't always use eggs)and add anything(veggies)in my rice before frying my rice.While frying I add my soya sauce for colouring and flavor while frying...I top it with fresh green onions....YUMMMMMMMM!

I found this very good, and my kids loved it, even one that doesn't touch white rice.  The simpleness of this recipe really appeals to kids.  I think I would have liked it better with some of the adjustments others have suggested but I won't be changing it because the family wins out.  I did however cook the rice for less time: about 12 min as I usually do when making plain white rice.

I loved it. Remember to prepare rice ahead of time and refrigerate it for a few hours : a very wise way to avoid rice becoming to soft due to wok heat. I added a few pieces of chicken Thai style. I definitely recommend this recipe.

I was disappointed.  Not near as good as restaurant.  My rice was mushy even though I followed suggestions to rinse rice first.  I also made it the day before so it would be cold.  It was still a sticky HUGE lump.  I used regular white rice.  Should I have used Basmati or Jasmine?  Would that have made a difference?  As "zobird" said I used 2C dry rice & it made a LOT. I didn't use it all and still we had a big container of fried rice left over.  I agreed with others that it didn't have much taste and I had to add a LOT of soy sauce & Sesame oil & still bland.  I love fried rice so will be willing to try this again.  So many good reviews I have to wonder if I did something wrong but don't know what??  I'll try rinsing the rice more next time & lightly browning it before adding cooking liquid.  I'll add onion & garlic with the peas & carrots.  Along with all the steps for making the Sweet n Sour Chicken it was a labor intensive meal that was just ok.

I gave this 3 stars cuz they didn't say how to do the egg properly! that's one of the most important parts in my opinion... you have to take your eggs (2 or 3), whisk them WELL with about a table spoon of water. then put them in a greased nonstick fryingpan and let them rise. The water makes the egg get poofy like in restaurant fried rice. You can add some spice to the egg too, but make it light or it'll weigh down your eggs. After the egg is cooked as a poofy egg disc, cut it up in squares and add it to your rice at the end :))

I did dress it up a bit based on personal preference (added an onion, added garlic, added oyster sauce, omitted green peas) but the base recipe here is fantastic. I am subtracting a star only because the rice NEEDS to be refrigerated a day or more before making any fried rice recipe -- that helps it get cold and dry, so it doesn't continue cooking into mush when it hits the pan. Thank you for sharing!

This was GREAT! I was being lazy and just used a bag of 'Steamfresh' white rice with carrots, peas and corn...it worked out wonderfully. Made as written except for adding some green onions. I did add the optional drizzle of sesame oil and I feel it finished the rice off perfectly! I will be using this recipe again for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)

I have made several times, using brown rice. I chop the carrots in the food processor and leave out the peas. I have substituted chopped celery in the place of peas and this is good as well. I have found it is better to have a large pan so you can scramble the eggs away from the vegetables, so you actually get pieces of egg rather than egg-coated carrots.

My rating is based on recipe before changes. I cooked the rice ahead & let cool first. Left out the carrots. I also added 1/2 cup chopped green cabbage and 1/2 lb. peeled-deveined shrimp. A local restaurant adds chopped cabbage and it's awesome! The onion and cabbage needs to saute' until tender. The Sesame Oil is a must.

When making fried rice, it's important to cook the rice ahead of time and let it cool before you use it. I used about 1/2 cup low sodium soy sauce. Good recipe for a quick, easy side dish.

This is a nice, basic fried rice recipe. I followed the recipe exactly as it is  written. The rice was a little mushy so next time I will cook the rice the day before to improve the finished product's texture. Soy sauce and sesame oil are excellent starter flavors for fried rice but adding one tablespoon of minced garlic and 2 tablespoons of oyster sauce makes this a more flavorful recipe for my family's taste buds. Thanks for sharing this recipe with our community! :)

My family loved this.  I used frozen peas and carrots.  Just boiled them for a few minutes as per package directions.  This would be great with roasted pork, shrimp or any other add ins.  Thanks!

Very yummy!  I added onin, summer squash, zuccini and chicken.  Definately use the sesame oil, it makes a difference.  My husband said it was the best I've made.  Thank you for a great recipe.

We made this tonight and followed the advice of other reviewers. I cooked the rice in chicken broth and added green onions and chopped up leftover ham. We also added some oyster sauce and used frozen peas and carrots. We will be making this again!

This and the 'sticky chicken'....after 4 years of my cooking this is the first meal my boyfriend put his fork down while eating.  I told him 'I am sorry-I'm not a fan either' and he smiled 'yeah, I wouldn't make this again'. The kids ate it, but nobody actually liked it.

There is nothing wrong w/this recipe, it is a good basic fried rice, but in my opinion the rice must be at least a day old, and it is better to saute` it in the pan before adding hot water to boil it.  I add chicken or beef broth to the rice water for flavor, and I usually add either beef or chicken to my rice.   I think the sesame oil is a must for that Chinese flavor, and I like either Hoisin sauce or Oyster sauce in mine,  I also use low salt soy sauce.  If I have them, or I am having someone for dinner, I add scallions and use the green tops at the end for color, otherwise I use some chopped onion and cook it in the sesame oil along w/a little garlic before I add other ingredients.

Amazingly tasteless. I added more soy sauce as it is marked "to taste", then it just tasted like rice soaked in soy sauce. Would never make again. For those new to making fried rice, the rice should be made the day before and refridgerated to avoid mush. When my mom makes it, she usually seasons the eggs as well.

I made this to go with our Asian Lettuce wraps last night.  Since I had cooked rice in the freezer, I went about this a little differently.  First I cooked my egg separately in an omelet pan.  When done and cooled enough to handle, I cut it in julienne strips (much prettier this way, in my opinion).  I steamed my carrots to soften them up.  I didn’t cook the peas, just thawed them.  I refrigerated all the components and just before dinner, I added the soy sauce and sesame oil to the rice and then folded in the remaining ingredients.  Microwaved for a few minutes and served!  Very good.  Nice color and good flavor!

Great recipe, i did cook my rice in half beef broth half water b/c all i had and added some minced garlic.  Love this w/ s. seed oil, but if you've never had it before i suggest adding a little at a time b/c it can be overpower if you add to much.  Thank for the great recipe.

Apparently i'm in the minority here.... I don't see anything special about this fried rice.  There aren't even spices in it, except for the soy sauce.  Also, BEWARE.... this makes MASSIVE amounts.  I could have halved this receipe and still had left over.

This turned out pretty decent. It made LOTS...we normally eat quite a bit of rice so I left the recipe as it was, but we have lots leftover. I also made the mistake of thinking that I could get it all into one pan and I was sadly mistaken. Next time I will cut the amounts in half or separate it into 2 pans to fry. No one in the house but me likes peas so I just used frozen carrots and cut them a little smaller. I also ran out of soy sauce ((as I used it in the general tsao's chicken from this site)) So I made sure to add the extra sesame oil at the end. It was a tad sticky...but that could have been from overcrowding in the pan. We will definitely use this again!! Thanks!!

I really enjoyed this dish. I paired it with Mongolian Beef (from this site). The recipe is very simple and it tastes great - who knew fried rice was so easy? The only change I made was to fry/sautee the carrots and peas for a few minutes and then added the egg and rice to the pain. Always looking for as few dishes as possible.

Good recipe, needs much more soy sauce. Make sure you use cold rice, it really doesn't work well otherwise.  Also, I added celery, carrots, frozen peas, broccoli, onions, garlic and whatever meat is available.  Any veggies you like will do.

Good basic fried-rice recipe. As is, I'd give it a 4. With a few adjustments, it's easily a 5. First, use day-old refrigerated rice --otherwise it gets clumpy/mushy. Also, as others have said, add oyster sauce and the flavor gets much more authentic. Besides that, instead of boiling, I sauteed the veggies and rice in sesame oil instead of regular vegetable oil and added onions to the mix - but that's mostly a preference thing.

It was good but missing something. Next time I'll try refrigerating the rice overnight and adding the sesame oil. I did add Oyster sauce like suggested by others and that helped the dish.

Very, very good, though I just cook the rice in a rice cooker and leave it overnight in the fridge to dry out a bit. I make this a complete meal by adding a couple handfuls of either snow peas or sugar snap peas to the vegetables, and adding 1-1/4 pounds of cooked/peeled/de-veined shrimp (or I'll cook the shrimp first in the wok and then remove to a plate until I'm ready to stir them in at the end to be heated through). I make this when I can find shrimp on sale, and it makes a healthy, cheap, and fast dinner.

To add an extra "snap" to this excellent base recipe, try adding sliced water chestnuts into the veggie mixture.

Good basic fried rice BUT I feel it is absolutely necessary that the rice be cooked ahead and chilled.   I feel it gives the finished product much better texture.    Seasame oil not necessary unless you like it.

This was my first time making fried rice and it was definitely a learning experience for me. Why would you crack and scramble the egg in with the veggies? My veggies were covered in egg-gunk. And I now know why people suggest that you don't use freshly cooked rice...it's too soft...not the texture of fried rice I'm used to. I suppose I could use day-old rice, but I don't want to be prepping this a day in advance. Oh well, I tried.

Good, basic recipe that works in a pinch. I didn't chop the carrots... chose to just use a veggie peeler and shred it and cook those with the peas. Worked like a charm! Added some fish sauce for a little more flavor. Overall, good recipe... but not a big WOW flavor.

Fried rice is even better when it's made with leftover rice.  Rice that's been cooked and chilled has a firmer texture and won't be sticky.  I like to add water chestnuts to this recipe.

This was really good- the only changes I made was- I used 2 TBSP of Oyster Sauce in the end and used BRAGG- (NATURAL soya sauce sub. found at health food store) and used only 1 egg.

Delicious! I used a bag of baby carrots/green peas and it worked pretty well. There's a lot of rice per veggi, though. The sesame oil makes it less sticky.

this was pretty good. i didn't think it sounded like it would have enough flavor so i added 1 medium onion, 3 gloves of garlic, and about 2 tbls of hoisin sauce, just cause i had it on hand. i also used frozen mixed veggies instead of the carrots and peas cause it's all i had. i topped it with chopped green onions. i ended up using about 1/2 cup of soy sauce.

Good recipe! This was my first time making fried rice, in fact, i'm not the most experienced chef, but it turned out GREAT! Actually, i modified it a bit. instead of putting frozen peas and raw carrots, i used a bag of FROZEN "stir-fry mix" which had green beans, broccoli, water chestnuts, carrots, sugar snap peas, and peppers and another FROZEN bag of peas and carrot chunks. i thawed it in warm water, and this way, i didn't have to boil the veggies before hand, i went straight to the frying part. Also, i added in minced garlic. And along side with the soy sauce and sesame oil, i put in teriyaki sauce too. And when it came to frying, i used a cast-iron skillet because i didn't have a wok; turned out just the same. It was excellent, delicious, and finished in a split second. Will definitely make again!

Great! I used peanut oil since I have a thing for Thai food. A suggestion for separating the grains is to mix a tsp or two of the oil into the cold rice with your hands and smash all of the clumps. It works like a charm.

Great way to use up some leftovers. I did as another reviewer suggested and added soy to the eggs when I added them in the middle of the wok/skillet.  I also added some teriayki just because we like the flavor.  I used leftover Far East Roasted chicken/garlic rice, broccoli, shredded carrots, green onions and peas.  Easy and Yummy!  Thank you

Great texture! I toasted the rice in a dry pan for 5 minutes, cooked then cooled on a large cookie sheet. Followed the recipe except used double the eggs and used chopped cooked pork, red pepper and green onion instead.

This was great! I left out the carrot because I hate cooked carrots. I would have like to have measurements for the soy sauce and sesame oil since this was my first time and I had no idea how much would make it taste right, but after a long time of adding a little bit at a time, it came out perfect. I would say my measurements were about 2 Tbsp of Soy Sauce and 1 Tbsp of Sesame, but I used half the amount of rice and I love the taste of Sesame oil.

We liked this recipe.  It was fast and tasty, and we can see the possibilities this dish can serve as a base-recipe for other ingredients, like shrimp and pork.  I made it with just-prepared rice, as I didn't have time to make it a day in advance, and it turned out just fine.  I will try it next time with pre-prepared rice, as other readers suggested. I didn't have sesame oil on hand, so I just used a little tahini, instead.  This dish more than adequately served the 4 of us for a total cost of just under $2.00; great to remember if shopping on a tight budget!

I made this with cold rice sauteed in a mix of olive and sesame oil that was made earlier in the day and used a cup of cooked chicken, frozen peas, water chesnuts, and corn.  At first my rice was really hard and clumped together and I was expecting the worst. As it heated up and I added about 1 TBS oyster sauce and a couple TBS soy, it seemed to come together and look the way it should. Served with a salad it made a great, inexpensive meal. My son who was complaining and didn't want to eat it, had his portion finished fast and ended up loving it. Had plenty left for the next days lunch. Editing to add: I made this recipe again with freshly cooked rice and it wasn't as good as when the rice had been in the fridge for a day.

This is really good.. I also added garlic powder and ginger powder and I agree about needing to use sesame oil. 
*TIP* make the white rice and put it the fridge to get cold then it won't clump and stick together.

A GURAAAATE recipe. Made the entire family happy and I doubled the recipe just in case, because of that factor.

We lived in Hawaii for 5 years and we miss the good asian food. This one came the closest to the asian restaurants we missed on Oahu. 

The YUM factor is definitely high. I added mini shrimp and a hint of onions, soy sauce, and splash of garlic to it. 

KUDOS!

I made this recipe tonight...overall it was good but not amazing and it didn't really remind me of the usual take-out fried rice. I made a few changes after reading the reviews. I coooked the RICE ONLY on high for 5 min before adding the 4 cups of water with 4 chicken broth bouillon cubes in it.cooking the rice for 5 minutes was supposed to make it less sticky however it was still VERY sticky.I also added garlic and onion once it was in the wok.next time i would add one or two more eggs and also some green onion.I(like many other reviewers)still felt it was missing something...so if any of you discover that secret ingredidient,post it please!

This is very good fried rice.  I used rice that I made the night before and also added some garlic, green onion, and a little bacon for more flavor.  I used beef broth in place of water as others suggested.  I made this and served it with Sweet and Sour Sauce II from this site.  VERY GOOD!

Although this recipe doesn't taste much like the fried rice that I've ever had, I make this recipe quite often.  My 2 year old son LOVES it, so I make a batch and we eat it for lunch.  The leftovers reheat well!  The only change that I made is to use a little over a cup of frozen peas and carrots.  This is a recipe that we will use often.  It is great with Teriyaki Chops, which is another recipe from this site.

Easy recipe, but there was something missing. I think that I may not have used enough soy sauce or I am missing an asian style spice. Overall I would probably tinker with the recipe a bit to see if I could get it to where my husband and I think it is perfect.

I used minute rice (it's all I had) and a pinch of garlic salt.  I cooked the egg separate from the veggies.

I just made this last night and this was better than the restaurants and probably a lot more healthy.  I am on a health kick so I used brown rice instead of white, olive oil instead of vegetable oil and egg beaters instead of eggs and I thought this was excellent!  I will definately make this again and also was quite good for you!

I made fried rice. I think I may have not precisely followed all of the directions. Because, it was NOT very good. But. Just let this be a warning to you. Make sure you follow EVERY direction, PRECISELY, because fried rice is suprisingly easy to mess up. Because. My rice, is really, really, gross. I keep trying to add things to the giant mound of rice I made, to help adjust the taste, to fix whatever is slightly wrong. Slight adjustments, like adding more salt, just a little bit of stuff to try and balance it all out. But it never works. Just makes it taste even worse. This rice sucks. I might have to throw out about two pounds of rice at this rate. I don't know if there is any tips or tricks you guys have to help me. Okay. Bye.

I substituted vegetable oil and minute rice as well as frozen peas & carrots for the listed ingredients. I used lite sodium soy sauce in recipe. Not like restaurant but still very good! I used Yum Yum sauce as a condiment.

The video is great. Watched one for this recipe and one for another fried rice, and it made making the dish so EASY. This is our family's new go-to quick meal. It's great as written, but I've scaled it up and made a few changes now, like using days-old brown rice and including green onion, cubed meat, and oyster sauce. The sesame oil makes this dish. Goes great with Frank's Red Hot.

I grew up in Vietnam and my mom made fried rice a lot when I was a kid. Fried rice is an easy breakfast dish made from leftovers for us. We used leftover rice (best when it's cold, just out of the fridge), leftover meat or ham (diced), scallions or garlic, veggies (peas and carrots work fine), eggs, and seasoned with soy, fish, or oyster sauce. This is a good recipe but you can make it even easier by cooking more rice than you need the day(s) before. I use this basic recipe to make fried rice for my kids now.

My family of 6 loves this and it's now a regular item on our menu, so I always keep the ingredients on hand.  Like others, I make the rice a day ahead and use it cold.  I throw the peas and carrots in frozen. I always add green onion toward the end. I usually add other vegetables to the Ps&Cs just to give us more veggies - bok choy (cooked ahead), chopped fresh spinach and chopped broccoli.  The sesame oil is A MUST - be generous and experiment. That's what really gives it the flavor.   Also, a good soy sauce is a must - I love Aloha brand.   I always make a huge batch because everyone loves it and wants leftovers the next day (even for breakfast).  In fact I actually made this for breakfast this morning - it's Sat and I opened the fridge and saw leftover rice and cooked up some friend rice.  The kids were so happy.

This was very good but I did make some changes that a friend told me about.  Using left-over rice is best if at all possible. The rice will be firmer. After preparing everything and when adding the soy sauce sprinkle about 2 teaspoons of sugar over it all and stir well. Depending how much you have made start with just one teaspoon and stir and taste.  Before serving sprinkle chopped green onion along with some of the green tops over it all. No need to stir it in and it is very colorful. If you like green onions you will love it on this dish. Thanks for everyone's input and the recipe!

My entire family enjoyed this recipe. The only thing i would say is that the rice was very sticky and next time i will cook the eggs separate and add them at the end.

This is a winner!  It tastes delicious and just like take out fried rice, but just as important (ok, almost as important, taste is always #1) it is quick and so very easy.  I cook my rice in the microwave.  By the time it's done, I've pretty much finished up the rest of dinner and then finish the rice. I don't even bother with the step that calls for cooking the carrots and peas separately, just throw them in my skillet (frozen, right out of the bag) a minute or so before I scramble the egg. Once, I had some extra chopped onion and added that to the skillet and it was excellent.  I do think the sesame oil is a must if you want a truly authentic flavor.  This is definitely going to become a regular in our dinner rotation!

I knew when I saw this recipe, we had to make it! We moved to a rural setting from city live and we miss our fav Chinese Restaurant. The recipe in itself is great, but like other posters, I added Sesame Oil, it does make the taste more authentic. I also added leftover  bits of cooked chicken and 2 sausage brats, that I took out of their skins and fried them like hamburger, it was deliscious!! 5 Stars all the way!!

It was mush. 
The flavor of the rice itself wasn't bad, but a very far cry from anything "restaurant style". I won't be making this ever again.

Great base recipe but cut back on the water.  I made this recipe per the instructions and it was a hot mess and lacked flavor.  Next time, I'll use day old rice to make this dish. Add chopped onion, garlic, pepper and sesame oil for added flavor.

Great. Versatile. You can add other ingredients as you see fit. I added bean sprouts and green onions. Also added some oyster sauce as per another review. That really took it over the edge.

Chinese takeout always gives us too much rice, so I use it in this recipe the next day.  It is much firmer and less sticky than home cooked.  My family enjoys it as much as the takeout.  I add chicken sometimes, but this is great on its own.

This was an excellent recipe! Very easy. I did make a few adjustments. I added some garlic powder, butter, and pepper. I also left the egg out because I don't like it. It tasted just like the fried rice at a Japanese restaurant! The sesame oil is a MUST!

Not sure if this was a three or four star. I added garlic, it needed more carrots and peas, I had no clue how much soy and sesame to add. As a beginning cook, I needed more specifics. I do feel something was missing though.

Very good as a base recipe for great fried rice. I did add Chinese sausage and green onions. Also I used cold left over rice (I've used freshly cooked rice before which didn't work as well as cold rice). I really like this recipe and will use again.

This turned out really well. Both my kids liked it. My son voted 5 stars but my daughter voted 4 so I went with the lesser to be fair to other reviewers. I used a frozen peas and carrots mix and next time I will do as another review suggested and cook the rice a day ahead.  I will make sure to make extra rice next time I cook it for a dish so that we can make it pull double duty. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This is nice recipe if you don't have a lot of ingredients on hand, but it tasted bland to me. It was semi-salvageable with some onion, but the recipe really needs to specify that the rice should be at least a day old so it won't stick together.

This recipe is good, but missing something... I think scallions (green onions).  Maybe a little ginger and a little garlic.   What I like best about this recipe is that it's a good base.  I modified it a LOT: egg whites instead of eggs (make sure the pan has enough oil and isn't too hot), a little red bell pepper (not sure I'd repeat that), some finely chopped mushrooms (good), a spoonful of sugar in with the soy sauce because I've seen that in some other recipe, a handful of sesame seeds at the end. I didn't measure anything (except for the water-to-rice proportion).  This would be good with shrimp or chicken or fried tofu or whatever.  I think for my next bowl full I'm going to add a little Thai chili sauce.

Pretty good but I think the rice cook time was way too long because the end result called for mashed rice.  It was almost like mashed potatoes.  But other than that, pretty tasty.

This was decent but was missing that "restaurant" quality I was looking for... my search continues. I added oyster sauce and that helped but still not quite there. My husband enjoyed it though.

This is a very quick and easy fried rice recipe, and I thought it tasted good. I used brown rice that I had refrigerated the day before and frozen peas and carrots for the vegetables. I will definitely make this again.

This is would be a great recipe without the peas and carrots. Instead I would add some cooked chicken, fresh shrimp, or mushrooms.

This is a GREAT starter recipe for fried rice -- you can essentially add anything to it and it'll be great. I made orange chicken with pineapple on the side and poured extra sweet sauce over the rice. It was AMAZING!

Fabulous!  I followed the recipe to a T. I did sub brown rice for the white rice, don’t eat white rice.  I just added some diced onions, salt and pepper to taste.  I served this with the “Asian Orange Chicken” recipe that is on this site, which was also delicious.

This is an awesome recipe. I made some modifications for my taste. First I used Quinoa instead of Rice, I prefer the extra whole grain and protien. I used more carrots and peas, just added per my taste. I used Olive Oil instead of veg oil. I also used seasame seeds instead of sesame oil. I used oyster sauce per another posters suggestion. Also added some salt and pepper to taste. WOW Amazing and really easy to modify for your own taste and liking.

I never knew how easy it could be to make fried rice.  We had this tonight with orange chicken (also from this site) and it was the perfect side dish.  I did use brown rice because that is what I had.  I also realized at the last minute that I had used all of my soy sauce in the orange chicken, but I did have some sesame ginger marinade sauce, so I used this instead.  I may use that every time.  The rice turned out incredible and my kids were begging me to make more tomorrow!

This was pretty good. A little mushy, but I don't know if my brown rice could have contributed to it? I didn't have white rice.

I thought this was a bit better than just ok. I feel like it needed oyster or fish sauce. Also, it would have helped to have the exact amount of soy listed versus having it "to taste".  I kept adding and tasting, adding and tasting, adding and tasting.....

This is a very tasty rice dish.  I was hoping for fried rice like I get down at the corner Chinese place, but as restaurant fried rice, this falls short and in that sense I was disappointed.  Yet as I said, as a side dish, I recommend it and will probably make it again.

Really liked this one... the only things I changed were the cooking time on the rice... doesn't need 20 min... if you cook it on medium heat rather than simmer, it gives you firmer rice. Cook until water is completely absorbed. I also added a little garlic... but reviews are right... it's just like restaurant quality.

This was so yummy!  I didn't add the carrots (simply because I didn't have any on hand) but added more peas.  I also threw in some finely chopped onion and a couple of cloves of minced garlic when i was stir frying the peas and it added some good flavor.  I got rave reviews from my Dad who asked when I would be making it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was better than our local Chinese place. I did not plan ahead, so I had to cook my rice within a few hours of dinner.  I knew I needed the rice to be cool, so I cooked with a bouillon cube (great suggestion) and I put it in the freezer to cool off. Worked great! I made the sesame pork tenderloin (allrecipes) and we had some left over.  The only thing different I did than the recipe was to sautee scallion, chopped garlic, peas and carrots in sesame oil before adding the rice.  We like food with a kick, so I added hot chili oil (yummy)-just a dash will do.  I added the rice to sauteed items, and proceeded to stir fry and add sesame seeds, soy sauce, oyster sauce, ginger, and S& P. Oyster sauce and sesame oil are a MUST! We used jasmine rice, which is great for stir fry. I will add more veggies next time.

This is my go-to fried rice recipe. Much better than the take-out place down the street. Just a drizzle of sesame oil really makes a difference. Make the rice a day in advance to avoid stickiness. Fantastic recipe; Thanks for submitting.

It was alright. Not great. I added some beef broth to the rice as it was cooking (I will, per advise, probably do more next time), and otherwise followed instructions. It is nice and easy to make, though. Good for what it is.

Edit: I added some sliced ham, green onions, garlic, and ginger. It's now very very good, and I've changed my rating to reflect that.

This is just like the resturants.  For a hint, to make it less sticky and clumpy put the cooked rice in the refrigerator and cool it befoe you stir fry it.  It turns out much better.

I was in a rush and didn’t read the suggestions. I think it would have made all the difference in the world. I added the sesame sauce and truly believe that just ruined the dish. I may make another version but not using the sesame sauce again.

So, I was really excited about this one, I had left over rice and the other ingredients in the fridge. I then proceeded to almost burn myself with the oil. After that catastrophe I switched pans and started over. It turned out alright, my boyfriend finished it but it wasn't AMAZING and definitely not restaurant style.

Terrific and quick fried rice recipe. We thought it was a great use for the left over white rice that we had from some take-out Chinese that we'd ordered a few days before. The only change that we made was to add some chopped onion, which we sauteed to the rice, carrots, and peas.

the key to un-sticky fried rice is to use cold rice (i usually make fried rice when i already have leftover rice sitting in the fridge). alternatively, if you're in the mood for fried rice and don't have hours to chill the rice or leftovers sitting in the fridge, try TONIARHODES1's suggestion to put the rice in a large pot (or wok) and stir it around for a several minutes to get some of the water (the factor behind the stickiness) out. ooor... if you have chilled rice and you like your rice semi crunchy, try this with chilled rice! finally, for you garlic lovers, starting with minced garlic (simmer in oil a few seconds before you throw in the veggies) makes this mmm delicious :9 (but less "restaurant style")

I couldn't stop eating this. Really yummy. I doubled the eggs, bit of sauteed onion and garlic but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Fantastic fried rice.

Substitute 1 or 2 of the 4 cups of water for beef broth while cooking/steaming rice. Cook rice in advance and refridgerate for at least 2 hours so the rice can separate. Cook your scrambled eggs 1st, slice them up and set aside. Then re-oil the pan, add rice, stir and cook on med-high heat for 3-4 mins, then add soy sauce. Be sure to add in the green onions and cooked egg last. AMAZING. BETTER THAN ANY RESTAURANT!

This was good.  The problems were my fault, not the recipe.  Definitely make sure you use cooked, COLD rice.  I added chicken and when reheated it was tough and dry.  No chicken and cold rice next time will be great!

Really good and easy.  I used frozen mixed veges since it was all I had and low sodium soy sauce.  It turned out great, thanks for the recipe.

This was my first time making fried rice.  I made rice in my rice maker and I also sauteed some onion and garlic in the oil.  I had a frozen bag of mixed veggies (corn, carrots, green beans, and peas) and added that to the oil, onion and garlic mixture...then I added the rice and followed the rest of the recipe.  It was really good!  I really think the onion and garlic really added to the flavor.

I used cold cooked rice I'd made a couple of hours earlier, tossed in a bit of parsley, chives, minced garlic and onion powder and used probably 2 T of soy, I really didn't measure, just added a little splash and then a drop more until it looked right. I didn't cook the peas and carrots first, I just added them right from the freezer bag, stir fried a couple of min and then let this stand while I was cooking the egg for it. Everyone enjoyed this here and it had a nice flavor. I wouldn't recommend using fresh cooked warm rice though, it just doesn't have the right texture for me when I tried it that way. I always cook mine ahead and refrigerate it first even if only a couple of hours ahead. Otherwise this recipe is great.

My family LOVED this!  I added chicken to it for a full meal.  Super easy.  I made the rice in the morning boiled in chicken broth.  Next time I will add water chestnuts.

I thought that this recipe was easy and delicious! I made some changes to it though. Instead of using water I used chicken broth. Also I added some diced chicken and more veggies. I found that using frozen veggies wasn't a problem! The fried rice turned out amazing!!

This is a good recipe but I have a some recommendations to make it better: Absolutely use day-old rice otherwise it will be a gooey mess. Oyster sauce adds some authentic flavor, just add to taste.  I sautéed the carrot with minced garlic and added chopped shrimp and pork. Just before serving I mixed in the chopped green onion. Yummy :)

Absolutely love fried rice!!!  I have found (on the advice of a Chinese friend of mine) that fresh ginger is a wonderful addition to fried rice and could easily be added to this recipe.  Also cut up cooked chicken is another tasty addition.

I wanted to have something already made in the fridge for when my husband got home tonight that would have been good hot or cold. Couple modifications. I added some minced garlic in with the sauteed veggies. I cooked the eggs seperately, so I knew they'd be right. (I am afraid that I won't cook them fully, so I always do them omelette-style in a smaller frying pan, then cut them into strips.) I had a sauce leftover from an Asian-spiced chicken that I'd made previously, so I just used that for a sauce, with additional soy sauce/sesame oil. I didn't have any peas, so I used celery. I also added some chopped orange bellpepper. Great way for me to make a quick meal and add in ingredients that I didn't want to go to waste. Thanks!

I found my rice was to moist, and it did not fry.  I would reduce the water by 1 cup and season it with bullion.  I would also suggest using at least a 1/4 cup of Soy Sauce, as the recipe gives no guidance on that.  Overall we enjoyed it and I will make it again with modifications.

Excellent, hubby quoted Larry David, saying "Pretty, pretty, pretty good!"  I wasn't sure if my kids would eat it, they're not big fans of Chinese food, but my 3 year-old slid my plate away from me and finished all the rice on my plate.  I went a little light on the soy sauce, wasn't sure how much to add without over doing it.  But it was great and will make it again.  Also, took other recommendations and prepared rice the day before and chopped a small onion and cooked up before adding carrots and peas to pan.

Very good!  I added onion and two cloves of garlic, as others suggested.  I had steamed the rice, so thought I should add some beef boullion since others had cooked their rice in broth, however I wish I had not added it.  It would have been better without it.

I thought this recipe was good, but it was missing something.  Some changes I made were to cook rice in chicken stock, I added bean sprouts, onion and garlic and I also added left over grilled pork tenderloin to make this more of a meal.

I thought this rice turned out very well.  I steamed the rice rather than boiling it for a more authentic Chinese texture.  I wish I would have thought to use chicken broth instead of water, though.  Will try that next time.  Also, I added chicken to make it more of a meal than a side dish.

I'm gonna rate this a five because my daughter couldn't stop eating it (**update, 12 years later my son is loving it).  Very easy to make..although I used a cup of frozen peas & carrots (thawed) vs. chopping the carrots and added chopped onion. As far as the egg, why not just scramble it vs. rolling it, and then slicing it? If you are quick, frying it up within the same pan and skipping those extra steps work just as great. Thanks for the easy recipe jostander!

I didn't have carrots and the peas don't need to boil first.  I just stir fried them with the rice which is plenty enough cooking time.   And I always boil rice in chicken broth never water no matter the recipe.  Makes for better flavor.  I thought this recipe was good and plenty flavorful I think people who said it isn't aren't using enough soy sauce.  I did use sesame oil and added green onion.  I think this recipe is good as written but better with a little tweaking.

This had a mild, pleasing flavor (although I added garlic, chicken broth, soy sauce, ginger & green onions in the process, as it may have been very bland as written)and my picky daughter liked it; therefore, I would make it again!  I rinsed the rice, then fried it  in a pot with 1/4 cup vegetable oil for 5 minutes.  I then added 3 2/3 cups chicken broth, 1/3 cup soy sauce, & 1 tsp sesame oil to cook the rice completely per directions.  Chopped carrots and added two diced green onions, 1.5 teaspoons minced garlic, 1 tsp grated ginger .  Cooked this veggie mix in the microwave for  3 minutes.   Added frozen peas to cooked veggie mix and stirred to warm them up.  Beat each egg separately, then cooked each in a mini skillet one at a time.  Rolled up each cooked egg and sliced thinly, then added to rice along with the veggie mix.  Added some finely chopped leftover chicken breast to the rice/veggie/egg mix and served as a one dish meal.  We enjoyed it!

Used peanut oil brown rice and ground ginger and my favorite veggies from the freezer and minced garlic also added bean sprouts.  My whole family loves it and now I keep it as a ready to go staple in my fridge for my husband and son who both love rice! I serve mine with fresh sliced avocado for a delicious and complete healthy meal!

I have made far tastier from just my inspiration on what I wanted out of a fried rice  which is really just a side dish. This was very bland, I should have realized it when it did not call for any garlic onions.

This is a pretty good recipe. I didn't follow it to a T though. 1) used cold rice prepared the night before (this is just better than fresh rice and not as sticky). 2) Didn't bother with boiling the peas and carrots before hand. 3) used a single duck egg I had from my back yard.

Also, next time I make this I'll be adding some oyster sauce for more flavor! It's a great addition. Yum!

I picked this recipe because  it calls for ingredients I have on hand. But, I didn't follow the directions. 1st of, most cooks know that to make fried rice, you need to have the rice cooked the night before or at least hours earlier.  That is necessary to keep the rice from getting mushy while "frying "it. Second, there is no need to cook the vegetables separately. Just stir fried them few minutes in the same pan before adding the rice. In my case, I also added some minced onion and garlic . And, because this was going to be our main course I chose to add some cooked shrimps at the end. 3 tablespoons of light soy sauce and 1 teaspoon sesame oil were the right amount for my taste(for half the recipe)
Made this way, with a side of steamed broccoli, this fried rice made a pretty good meal.

Good recipe but not authentic :) growing up in Beijing, I used to have fried rice for breakfast every Sunday and mom never used anything like baby carrots or peas or soy sauce or even sesame oil. Fried rice is like the bread and butter pudding (and for those of you who're scratching your heads, what I mean is that they are both tasty ways of utilising leftover food no longer in best condition). 

Simple yet delicious fried rice calls for medium or short grained rice variety for texture, and all you need to do is scramble the eggs in excessive amount of peanut oil (drain it later if you must, but definitely put in more than you need or the eggs won't puff up nicely), a little salt for seasoning, and some very finely chopped spring onions stirred through right at the end. An experienced chef here is the key, of course :)

Followed the recipe pretty close other than I had to use frozen carrots, added some onion in with the peas and carrots, I rinsed the rice in cold water to bring temp down and also get rid of some of the starch, lastly added some garlic powder to the veggies before the rice was added.  Kids really liked it too.

My family loves this recipe, even my picky eater!  First time I did it exactly as written, it was great!  The second time I took the recommendations of other reviewers and sauteed the veggies in sesame oil and added about 1/4 cup of oyster sauce after adding the rice.  It gave it more authentic flavor.  Awesome recipe!

It was excellent! I used frozen peas and fresh carrots, and instead of boiling them I stir fried them in (They cooked/defrosted just fine). I also added scallions at the end.

Great recipe but I wouldn't say restaurant style. What made it restaurant style was the addition of oyster sauce and a handful of bean sprouts.  That really took it to the next level! I also added some diced, crispy fried Spicy SPAM and made Musubi Fried Rice with it. All in all, it's a good, versatile recipe.

Simple idea for one of my favorite dishes.  I will definitely be trying this one this week.  My family has a great tradition of eating  Chinese food for new years, so this will be on the menu.  Thanks for the great ideas.

I was taught how to make restaurant style fried rice by a Chinese friend who owned his own Chinese restaurant. His rice turns out just like this rice! One thing he does, and was adamant about, chill rice 30 minutes in fridge to stop the cooking process. He says that cooked rice from the cooking pot is still cooking internally and mushes when put in wok to fry, which you do not want, The chilled rice warms up enough to absorb all the seasonings and soy sauce without cooking any or getting mushy. Another trick, making chicken fried rice, cook your chicken leg quarters in the over, 350 til done, using the juices off the chicken to moisten the rice instead of sesame oil. The sesame oil changes the taste of the rice and if you do not like that flavor, it will ruin the rice for you.

Good starting point! Simple and easy to make but not super flavorful. I add a bit more soy sauce and chopped green onions to my fried rice. Would be great with chicken.

I just finished making this. Yummy! I used brown rice that I cooked in chicken stock 2 days ago, frozen peas & carrots. I scrambled 3 eggs prior to placing them in the pan. I also added fresh shrimp. I used a small amount of soy sauce and oyster sauce. Yummy yummy yummy & super quick! Thank you

You should also add sesame seeds and a little pepper. Since I'm gluten free I used braggs liquid aminos and it works and tastes just the same! I also use frozen mix veggies. If I want to make this my main meal I add chicken or shrimp and pineapples!

Flavor was awesome but the texture turned out too soggy. Next time I will take advice from other reviewers and make the rice the day before. I also added bean sprouts and some garlic and found it to be an excellent addition.

Wonderful flavor with the addition of the suggested oyster sauce and a quarter teaspoon of sesame oil.
If you fry the rice on med low burner BEFORE proceeding with the boiling/simmering process, the grains will stay individual, rather than getting sticky and clumpy.

Although this recipe is a good starting point to make restaurant style fried rice, there are 2 things you have wrong.  first, you cook the rice in chicken stock instead of water and second, you don't scramble the eggs with anything at all.

This misses the mark on many levels.  Using 2:1 water to rice is inaccurate. Using freshly made rice makes it awfully mushy. No oyster sauce? This tastes ok, but FAR from restaurant style. Well, maybe if the restaurant is hometown buffet.

First, I started with COLD rice.  As another reviewer remarked, that's essential.  This also is pretty bland.  I added a pressed garlic clove and 1/2 cup chopped onion.  And I agree that the sesame oil is essential, and 1/8 tsp "red pepper oil" wouldn't hurt, either.

I needed to doctor this up quite a bit.  First, I added scallions.  Also, I added 1 T sesame  oil. I did this without peas because I was out, and I added 1 or 1.5 C diced Chinese-bbq rib meat (boneless) which I already had from a char siu recipe.  I added soy sauce.  However, there were NO leftovers from those improvements.  And no one complained about the rib meat being too spicy.  Great way to use unwanted ginger beef or meats.

I only followed this recipe loosely, omitting bean sprouts, regular onions, and a few other things. I basically only had diced carrots, green onions, egg, rice, soy sauce & sesame oil. I added much more soy sauce & sesame oil (equal parts) to the rice & it tasted fantastic. My friend loved this & asked me to make again with chicken in it next time & served with eggrolls. Really easy recipe & better than most Chinese restaurants for sure!

Awesome. Diced up some leftover chicken and deli ham to throw in. I substituted brown rice then added some fish sauce and Chinese spice powder at the end. Husband loved it. I think it was better than take-out!

Yummy!! We used cold, cooked rice and added the optional sesame oil (don't leave that out, it really adds a great flavor). Next time we'll probably add some chopped green onions on top after cooking, but it's a great recipe and we'll use it again soon.

Very, very yummy!  Husband said it's the best fried rice he's ever had!  The sesame oil really is necessary with this recipe--thankfully I keep it on hand when I make my Asian-inspired pork chops, which is what I served this rice with.  It adds a delicious nutty flavor you just can't beat.

This is just looks like restaurant fried rice, but not exactly the same thing. Here's some tradition Chinese fried rice recipe tips: add some salt in the egg and beat it, then fried it, when it still have less of the liquid, off fire, so when it back to pan with rice, it could stick on rice; fried the vegetables before the rice, especially carrots, to keep the most nutrition. These two tips could save your time and your dish. Last thing, season rice with salt, don't add too much soy sauce, that will let your rice lump and sticky.

I use the same base recipe but with a simple change.  Cook the rice, refrigerate it and then heat in the wok.  By starting with cooled rice it won't get sticky and gluey.  It's also good with bits of diced ham, shrimp, chicken, etc. and some diced scallions at the end.

Very simple and great flavor.  I did cook the jasmin rice a day before.  I used frozen vegetables instead, carrots, peas and corn.  I did add 2 tbs oyster sauce and 1 tbs sesame oil.  Also added slices of chinese sausage and chopped spring onions at the end.  Thanks for sharing.

Lightly brown rice in a dry pot for a few minutes before adding liquid, and add onion to the peas and carrots, then it's like what you get in the restaurants.

Excellent recipe, I added oyster sauce and it was great.  I think I added around 4 tablespoons, but add less first and taste.  I might add an extra egg and more carrots and peas next time.

What a great base recipe. As others have noted, it's important to use cold, leftover rice. I stir fried half a diced onion with the carrots and peas. I also threw in diced smoked turkey sausage because I happened to have it around. I didn't have sesame oil but I added a little oyster sauce to taste.

This is wonderful. I use a soy-free "soy sauce" to make it allergy-friendly, and it still tastes great. It's also great with any veggies you like, or - my personal favorite - some fresh pineapple and a hint of pineapple juice in the sesame oil. I also usually just cook the carrots and peas right in the wok. I cook them for a minute or two, and that lets me skip the second step. This is delicious, fast, and was a big hit at a recent dinner party.

I pre-steam some jasmime rice and let it dry out for a couple of hours before making this.  I also add some rice vinegar in the final stages.  This is SO GOOD and everyone loves it.  What I love most is you can really adapt it to your liking...  I add onions, baby corn, mushrooms, shrimp, chicken...really whatever I am in the mood for.  It has been outstanding every single time.  THANKS!

Awesome!  I cooked some garlic, onions and mushrooms in olive oil, then added in some leftover beef from the Asian Beef Skewers from this site, then added in rice I had made last night.  A bit of soy sauce and voila!  Dinner is served.  So easy and so tasty.

Loved it but added a can of bean sprouts to extend it and make it more like the fried rice we order at our favorite Chinese restaurant. Thanks for a great recipe.  I have include it in my online "recipe box."

This recipe was pretty good, but it was a little too simple for me. In order for there to be any flavor, you needed to add loads of soy sauce and vegetable broth. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, it just should be stated in the recipe that you'll need a lot of salty liquids to get the flavor just right.

This is the best fried rice recipe I have found so far. The Oyster sauce another poster mentioned really added a nice touch as well! I highly recommend using sesame oil in place of vegetable oil!

I made this when I made stir fry and it was fabulous!  I used a bag of frozen peas and carrots instead of chopping up carrots and it made it easier and faster (always a plus).  I will definitely be making this again and again.

Pros: This recipe is very easy and makes use of some common ingredients you have on hand.  It can also make use of leftover meats.  I added leftover porkchops that I sliced and used frozen peas and carrots.  Cons: There is not alot of flavor, but then again I have been known to like a stronger flavor.  I suggest adding a tsp each of garlic powder, salt, and fresh ground black pepper.  I also added a 5 spice blend I had on hand as well.  I cooked as directed other than the additions to the ingredients I made.  I will make this again, but who knows the combination I will make next time!

Only had celery and onion on hand and a can of mixed veggies, but thanks to this recipe the end product turned out much better than my previous attempts! Added sesame oil after frying with the rice for a bit then I also took one reviewer's suggestion of adding a dollop of oyster sauce right at the end. My dad likes to add chopped bacon to his rice as well, which compliments the egg nicely. The perfect fast/easy/cheap dish, and a great way to use up leftovers.

This was good.  Only problem was I had a small bottle of very strong sesame oil and I added about 2 tsp and that was way too much.  It took over the flavor.  So, it was my fault.  Be careful not to add too much Sesame oil.

I use this recipe for the basic proportions, but what I think really makes it is Oyster Sauce.  Last time I made it I added a scant one cup to the whole recipe, and next time I'm going to cut down a bit.  Oh, and a block of extra firm tofu cut small turns it into a main dish. (at least at our house)

This was okay, but not the best.  We used frozen carrots and peas.  We also added cooked pieces of pork.  The pork was really good added in.  But, the recipe was sort of plain by itself.

Good and easy.  The boiling of the carrots and peas makes them perfect for stir frying without worrying about them being too crunchy.

Made this for my kids to go with chicken so I left out the eggs this time, but I know this would be really good with eggs. This is a great simple fried rice recipe. I always cheat and use instant rice.

This was yummy!  I used a combination of leftover brown rice and freshly cooked white rice.  I also added an extra egg, as I made this for my kids for dinner, and wanted the extra protein.  I also used the sesame oil, because I love the taste of it.  This recipe is definitely going into the rotation!

This was better than the take-out we get!  My husband loved it.  The different flavors/textures was perfect.  Had grilled chicken with this, and shredded the leftover chicken to add to the rice for our lunch the next day.  So easy to make, this is definitely a keeper!  Didn't have peas, used diced up green beans; chopped a shallott very small, so this was a good base start for your recipe.  Didn't have semsame oil, used extra virgin olive oil (just a wee bit) and used chicken stock along with water to cook rice.

Altho' I have not tried this---yet---I love fried rice and this sounds like a good one.  A couple of things I might add are fresh mushrooms, a can of bean sprouts (or fresh bean sprouts), and definitely, scallions!  Yum!

Good basic recipe. I found the proportion of rice to everything else to be a bit much, but otherwise it was decent.  Will make again with tweaks. Needs some green onion.

Wonderful!! I followed the recipe as written and had great results with little effort. My hubby said it was as good as the local Japanese steakhouse's and my 2 and 4 year olds devoured it. They wanted nothing to do with their plain rice. The sesame oil adds a lot in my opinion so don't omit it.

Great recipe - and the title is 100% right on - tasted exactly likr restaurant style rice!  I went with the tips and browned the rice first with oil, used beef broth, added minced ginger and garlic, and also added white onion.  Next time I think I will cut the carrots smaller and add a 3rd egg.

This was really good and so simple.  I used chicken broth instead of water when cooking my rice because I just think it gives that extra flavor you need.   I followed the advice of a previous reviewer and heated the dry rice in the pan before adding the liquid.  I think it did help reduce the stickiness of the rice.  Will definitely be making again - yum.

Great starter recipe! I added green onions, sliced mushrooms, used frozen peas, and diced carrots. I added some diced leftover ham and made it into a one pot meal. The sesame oil is a must, but just a drizzle! A little goes a long way! YUM!

Excellent!  I used leftover white rice and didn't have any carrots but added chopped white onion and I cooked everything in bacon grease.  I added a lot more than 2 tablespoons of soy sauce.  I just kept adding until the color looked like it does in restaurants!

Super easy to make.  I usually cook the rice in beef stock and add scallions at the end before serving.  Using the sesame oil is a must!

Very easy! I used fresh ingredients and it turned out wonderful. I followed others advice and just used a dash of sesame oil. I don't have a wok, so I prepared this in a frying pan and it worked fine. My first time making fried rice and I will definetly try it again. Oh- one other note; I used a premixtre of honey and soy as my sauce that I used to coat. Easy and tasty recipe!

This was great, and easy.  I actually used frozed peas & carrots which worked out just fine.  The rice I used was a Jasmine rice which really made it taste good.  I think I may even toast some sesame seeds to put on in the future.  This has now become a staple in my house.

We liked this.  It was my first time making fried rice, so I am pretty proud of it.  My husband and son both enjoyed it also.  I would definitely go light on the sesame oil in anything you ever put it on because it is very strong.  My rice seems to turn out sticky no matter what I do, but it was still pretty good.  I think the family will ask for it again.

I made this for myself for dinner last night because I was exhausted after work but craving something "bad for me" (and I was too lazy/cheap to stop for chinese food). It was pretty good, but I put too much sesame oil and had to add more soy sauce. It's good, but other than the taste of soy/sesame, there's not a  complex flavor. I was out of peas, so I used corn, and also chopped some scallions. I used jasmine rice since I had it on hand. I can't wait to eat the leftovers.

I'm not sure why this recipe would call for white rice... it turns it gooey.  I would use brown or long grain next time.

Good recipe. Like a what another reviewer said, the key ingredient is Oyster-Flavored Sauce, available at most stores in the Asian section. There are also different kinds of fried rice with different sauce bases, i.e. Hoisin sauce (sweet) and Shoyu sauce (salty). I think it's worth experimenting with these sauces to get the flavor that you like.

This was a good recipe, but it needs a little more flavor. I added sesame and peanut oil, but still needs more flavor. I will be adding more onions, peppers, and other veggies next time.

This is a great base recipe.  I add 1 clove crushed garlic after the peas and carrots and just a pinch of sesame oil (goes a long way) I use basmati rice which is less sticky (works well hot, no need to cool) and i add bean sprouts at the end. Kids love it!

This was okay. Could do without the vegtables and I love veggies. Even my fiance who devoures peas said it wasnt right. Needs lots of soy sauce, a pinch of sesame oil, used a bit too much, and deffinatly need to use cold rice made the day prior. Makes a huge difference!! Came out very mushy, guess I had to learn the hard way. Will make again but with these changes

As is, not good.  The rice has absolutely no flavor.  You have to cook the rice in broth, or somehow add more flavor.  The rice is really sticky and I had to add a lot of soy sauce, but then it just tasted like rice with soy sauce.  Needs much more flavor.

I added 2 sliced green onions and a clove of garlic to the mix along with a pinch of 5 Spice Powder. This is also a great way to use up leftover white rice! I've added shrimp and diced cooked chicken to this as well. Also, the packaged chinese bbq pork from the supermarket is excellent diced up in this!

I *loosely* used this as my recipe as I tried a different fried rice recipe and it didn't turn out so great.  I think the key ingredient is the sesame oil, definitely added the missing flavor.  I sauteed a bunch of veggies - carrots, zucchini, snow peas - and some left over cooked chicken in the sesame oil then added cooked rice that was refrigerated, scrambled egg that I cooked in a separate pan that I had cut into strips and drizzled in soy sauce.

This was quick to put together and looked beautiful when finished but wasn't for us.  I thought it was very bland as is.  I followed the directions to a T.  This did not taste like restaurant fried rice to me.  Some of it got eaten but only because we served the Baked Teriyaki Chicken sauce over it.

I was really hesitant to try this recipe, but it turned out pretty well. I think the sesame oil is crucial! I did use a frozen mix of peas and carrots because I had it on hand. After finishing it up per the directions, I felt it was really lacking something flavor-wise. I ended up adding garlic, a little ground ginger, and a healthy dose of oyster sauce. These additions really helped the flavor. I'll make this again with those modifications, thank you.

Cooking the rice the day before would have definately helped, I also didn't have any sesame oil. I am sure that it would have make all the difference. I was just looking for a quick recipe to serve with some breaded shrimp and it did serve the purpose. I will try again next time I have leftover rice. ;o)

This was super delicious. I added some packet of fried rice seasoning I found in the Asian section and it was great. My first successful attempt at fried rice. Thanks!

This was very good and simple.  I used Birdseye Steamfresh brown rice.  I cooked it early in the day and then refrigerated it.  The grains stayed nicely separated.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I just finished enjoying this recipe, and my whole family loved it!  I just added 1/4 chopped onion, since I love onion in fried rice.  Sesame oil is a must and should NOT be optional, in my opinion.  I might also try adding chopped water chestnuts next time for added crunch.  Delicious!

This recipe really needs some sesame oil or oyster sauce. It just tastes like rice with soy sauce without.

Yum! I just tried this and it was very delicious. No more take-out Chinese for us! I used brown jasmine rice (cooked yesterday), frozen pea/carrot mix, scallions, diced shrimp and chicken. I decided to add a little extra garlic, as well as oyster sauce and a few drops of sesame oil. As a newbie to brown rice, I have to say I could hardly tell the difference with the brown jasmine.

This was delicious!  I used brown rice instead of white.  I cooked the rice the day before in chicken broth so it had more flavor.  I also added onions and some left over grilled chicken breasts that I chopped and threw in at the end.

Great recipe, I added garlic/ginger sauce to the soy sauce as well.  Definitely add the sesame oil.  I did 1 tbs vegetable oil and 1 tbs sesame seed oil to the wok.  As far as the rice goes, use day old rice (mine was 2 days old).  Also, I agree with previous reviewers- stir rice only in saucepan on high heat before doing anything else with the rice.  With the additions definitely a 5 star rating.

What a great recipe! It was so easy to make and we really enjoyed it. The only changes I made was to add chicken and scallions. It makes great leftovers too. It's a keeper.

10/8/2008 First review...This is a favorite in our house. My 14 year old son requests this often! He even takes it to school for lunch. I like to add onions and sometimes diced celery to mine. One hint, the sesame oil really does help it to taste like restaurant style fried rice. I recommended this recipe to a friend and it was a big hit at her house as well. Try it, it is great!  11/9/16...add Oyster sauce to the rice, makes it even better!

I wanted to cut some calories, so I eliminated the oil, used leftover brown rice & egg whites. Boiled carrots for a few minutes in a deep pan in veggie broth.  Scooped out carrots & used remaining broth to saute minced garlic & frozen shrimp. Scrambled egg whites in separate pan. Tossed rice, carrots, frozen peas & eggs in w/ shrimp & added soy sauce. YUM!!!

Every bit as good as restaurant fried rice!  I steamed the rice instead because I used to work at a Japanese steakhouse and that's what they did - it took longer, but it was perfect!  I'm sure it's good either way, though!

I was incredibly disappointed in this rice.  Perhaps, like others, I added too much sesame oil (amounts would be helpful).  It tasted NOTHING like restaurant fried rice.

This keeps getting better each time I make it.  I tend to fudge the recipe a little.  (Using peanut oil in place of sesame oil because that is what I have on hand.  Using whatever mixed frozen veggies I have available, adding chopped onion to the mix when it's boiling.  Using Teriyaki sauce in place of soy sauce when I was out of it, and using both when I got more soy sauce.)  I have found that this is a very flexible recipe.  The generic premise that seems to work for it is to cook some white rice.  Then when that is almost ready, put frozen (and other desired) veggies in boiling water to get tender.  Heat the skillet/wok and toss the veggies in.  Then add the other ingredients as per recipe- egg, rice, seasoning sauce.  I find that the end result tastes good both fresh out of the pan, and also as leftovers-either hot or cold.  This seems to be a great easy, adaptable recipe to make as a side dish or entree.  (I haven't tried this, but I imagine that bite-sized seasoned meat or tofu could be added to the recipe to make it more of a complete dinner as opposed to a side dish.)

Very good, a hit with 5 guys and this girl! No sesame oil (allergy), no peas (ew!) but added extra carrots, & frozen green beans, garlic, dash of hot sauce. Also since I switched to brown rice made sure to cook it w/part of a beef bullion cube.

Admittedly, the first time I made this it was a failure (I am the queen of making bad eggs--it was my fault so not the reason I just give it a 4/5) but the second time I made it and succeeded.  This recipe is excellent for vegetarians (vegans could find a substitute for the eggs), and is even better when you add more vegetables and use chicken stock. :) I give it 4 out of 5 simply because the recipe as is--sans the chicken stock and sans other veggies -- can be somewhat tasteless even with the soy sauce.

This was a good recipe, especially because I had no idea really where to start. The reviews were really helpful as well. I used steamed,cold brown rice, it was great! Next time I will try making the rice in a chicken or beef stock like others have recomended, that's a good idea!

Boil your rice one day ahead and a few hours before making this recipe uncover the rice and spread it out on a plate to let it dry a bit. This prevents the rice from lumping. I also boil the rice in any of several choices of broth for added flavor. Add the chopped up scrambled eggs separate after they are done.Add sesame oil and toss in the pan before putting on the plate.

This is SUCH an easy fried rice recipe and easily adaptable for any recipe. I made this this morning to have for dinner tonight alongside sweet n sour chicken, and man, I ate it as my lunch!! Next time I will just make a meal out of it and add some chicken or pork, maybe some shrimp. I shredded the carrots and then blanched them along with the peas. Absolutely fabulous! My husband says its better than the restaurant!! I also used instant rice, this is staying in my recipe book! Thanks!

Very good recipe, but I too tweeked it a bit, I am not a fan of soy sauce, so I used teriaki sauce instead, Since my hubby does not like peas, I used green onions,mushrooms and carrots, and I also cooked my rice with chicken stock. My ten year old could not get enough of it. I served it with teriyaki chicken,green pepper,onion kabobs, I made on the grill!
will make it again definately:)

Not bad, but it turned out a little bland. I tried adding a half onion, but the recipe still missed something.

This is by FAR the absolute BEST Fried Rice i have EVER eaten. It taste's just like the  Chinese shop's, i didn't change the recipe at all and i love love loved it! 
For other people all i can say is do not leave the sesame oil out, it is the reason it tastes so great :-)

This was pretty good.  It was very easy, which was nice.  It could have used more flavor (and my rice was cooked in chicken broth).  I added a splash of soy sauce.  It would be a great basic recipe to expand upon.  My husband made this tonight for dinner while I was frying egg rolls.

This is a solid go to recipe. Easy to make and you can use the leftover rice from the chinese restaurant for a short cut. I sweated 1/2 white onion, 2 stalks green onions and peas. Not a fan of the carrot. About 1 tbls. spoon of soy does the trick. I also added some left over chicken breast that I finely chopped. Yummy!!!

Awesome!  My family (Hubby and 2yr old) LOVED IT!  I did the brown rice and added sauted pineapple and shrimp to make a one bowl meal.  We all ate 2nds.

This is a really good recipe!  I used brown rice (wholesome carbs) and added a chicken breast in for some protein.  I didn't have any sesame oil on hand, but even without it is great!

This recipe is a good one!! The only thing I would do differently next time, is I would leave out the sesame oil. It was a little overpowering even though I didn't use that much. It takes away the taste of the rice.

My wife and I love this recipe.  I suggest getting a counter top rice cooker to prep all your rice in rather than boiling on the stove.  After the time is done, leave in the cooker on warm for another 15 to 20 minutes stirring halfway through.  This will give your rice a more sticky texture.  I also cube cooked chicken, then toss it in the wok and cook with soy and a little seasame oil before adding the rest of ingredients.  Fried chopped onion adds a good flavor as well.

This is a pretty good recipe, but definitely needed some modifications.  I added some onion, an extra egg, and garlic powder.  Also, I used brown rice, because this is all that I had, and it turned out pretty good.  I believe that it would have been even better had I used white rice.

My family and I  loved this fried rice!  I ran out of soy sauce as I was cooking.  If I'd had had more, it would have been perfect!  I can't believe it was better than our Chinese restaurant here in town.

I think  this is a good base recipe for friend rice. I'd omit the sesame oil--I use it in a lot of dishes, but here it doesn't fit the flavor people expect in fried rice. I didn't use it and really tasted like restaurant fried rice to my girls!

I too cooked the eggs like an omlette, then rolled it up and chopped it into the rice. I also added some chopped up chicken. We always have lots of leftover cooked rice (husband's Filipino-American!) so I didn't have to make rice, and I used a bag of frozen mixes veggies.

Both girls liked it, though my 12 year old wants me to add shrimp next time. And she also thought a little onion would be good too, which makes her onion loving papa proud!

This was a good recipe but it is missing something. I used leftover brown rice and added cubed chicken breast and some freshly chopped celery to it. It was a nice change from the usual fried rice I make. Will try again with some more modifications I think, just to figure out what it's missing. Thanks for the recipe.

Well i didnt have a wok, so i just used a frying pan. I doubled the recipe so i had to do it in 2 batches. It turned out a little soggy cause of the pan but it was great. I added 12oz. frozen shrimp for 2 batches. it was great.

We were hoping to find a recipe similar to what's served in better Chinese restaurants, where the fried rice itself is super tasty even without lots additional meat or shrimp. This recipe is quite bland without any additions.

This was ok.  Nothing like restaraunt.  The sesame oil (even though used sparingly) is too overpowering.  I asked our fav chinese restaraunt what oils they used for their fried rice and they said only veg oil. Skip the sesame oil and it will turn out much better!  It wasn't bad though.  My husband loved it!

This was a good recipe, but I wouldn't  say it tasted like restaurant fried rice.  Mine was a little greasy, so next time I'll have to modify the oil amounts. It's a good base to play around with.

This was the first time I have ever attempted fried rice. It came out wonderful. I did use half a can of canned peas and I boiled fresh carrots. I could not have asked for a better or easier fried rice recipe. I will definitely make this again.

A great starter fried rice recipe. Next time I will add one more egg. The hardest part is getting the rice just right. Be prepared to use a lot of soy sauce. Added some shredded chicken and bacon for taste.

Absolutely wonderful!  This was even better than the restaurant kind and very inexpensive to make.  The only thing I did differently was that I added leftover pork.  I will probably make this once a week.

We found it tasty, but creating a scrammble egg made a bit of a messy plate while cooking (it battered). It is better if you make an egg omelette and then cut it in thin slices and add it in. Try some thin ham aswell.

So fast (I cooked the rice a couple of days ago to speed along tonight's dinner prep)!  And easily adapted to what you love in your fried rice.  Next time I'll add diced ham or baby shrimp, maybe green onions, maybe more egg.  The possibilities are endless!

This is the best fried rice recipe I've ever made.  I previously used "fried rice seasoning" that came in a package.  This recipe is so much simpler and blows the package away!  I also followed the advice of one reviewer and added chopped onion to the carrots..  Thank you for a winning recipe!!

This was delicious!  I omitted the onion, added leftover pork loin and cut the sausage in half (due to the pork loin) and it was wonderful.  Thanks for a great fried rice recipe!

This is just what I was looking for.  I did not use the sesame oil, because I did not have any on hand, and when I cooked my rice, I added 2 tablespoons butter and 1/2 teaspoon salt (I always do when making rice), I also added a little chopped onion that I cooked when I cooked my carrots.  Turned out perfect.  Thanks for sharing!

I added soy-sauce soaked fried chicken bits - absolutely delicious. Very generous with coconut aminos or soy sauce and toasted sesame oil.

I will definitely make this again with a few tweaks. This was good, but seemed like it was missing something. Maybe next time I’ll add in more veggies or something. Not bad for my first attempt though.

I wavered between giving this recipe either 3 or 4 stars. I went with 4 because it’s a decent recipe with a nice flavor, but it just left me wishing for a little more flavor. I even added some ground ginger, black pepper, green onions, 1 minced garlic clove, a few shakes of onion & garlic powder, and seasoned salt. I think when I make fried rice again, I will cook the rice in chicken broth for more depth of flavor.

You may cal this fried rice but it is just a bowl of rice and stuff.  If I am following a recipe I expect it to be all I need.  Naturally any cook wants to add their own choices but this is bland and not so hot as written.  I Notice that everyone does something to it to make it palatable.  Find another recipe.

The rice was easy to make and didn't take as long as the recipe said it would. It was very good, but could've been better. We did a double recipe, and I think we should've added some more egg to it.

I had prepared following every step, however, I wanted a little more flavor so I used chicken stock in place of the water, for a little extra flavor. Came out wonderful.

Julienned fresh cut carrots into mix with Red Onions fried first in oils with the carrots  then the scrambled egg. Delicious. Can add in pineapple chunks too. And grilled chicken or add in peas pork etc.

I made this for my picky eating daughter and she LOVED it she even ate the left overs at school for lunch and came home requesting that I make it again for dinner. The only issue I really had was that there was too much water needed for this recipe which made it too watery causing my 4 stars instead of 5.
 I did make a few changes.. My daughter is all organic so my ingredients were too, I used a can of chicken soup (minus the noodles) to get both extra flavor in there & chicken. I used frozen carrots and peas, but also used onions from the chicken noodle soup. Butter instead of oil because it was what I had on hand.  It came out great! :)

Fried rice is so easy and uses the leftovers that wouldn't be enough to use on their own.  I prefer to fry the eggs first in the wok, then remove to add in last.  Also, the sesame oil makes the difference in making it taste authentic.  Feel free to add other chopped veggies and fry after the egg is removed.  I add chopped garlic and even a shake of garlic powder.  Works with  any meat: chicken, beef, pork, shrimp ... or just make it with vegetables.

I added a little chicken stock to the already cooked rice I had in the pan with peas and carrots, not a wok.  I added red onion as I didn't have green.  Next time will make the egg separately and add instead of mixing into.  Added too much sesame seed oil. Next time, only small amount.  Also added more soy sauce but that's what we like.  I will make again.

This was very good. The only change I made was I used one egg instead of two because that's all I had.

This was an easy yummy fried rice recipe. I made my rice with 2 teaspoons of chicken bouillon powder in the cooking water, which gave the rice a richer flavor to start with. Then I used about 1/3 of a bag of frozen peas and carrots versus baby carrots. As with all fried rice there is a oily consistency to this dish, but you can cut back on some of the oil, but you may give us some of the taste and the rice may not be as loose.

Fantastic! Followed previous reviews calling for sesame oil and also oyster sauce. Used a low sodium soy sauce, was careful about the amount cuz my family likes to add soy sauce on their plate.
For a crowd (maybe 10 people?) or  to have enough to freeze for a future meal:
1)  2 days b4 making stirfry: marinate 8 skinless boneless chicken breasts (used a sweet chili flavored HEB chix brst)  in a mixture of teriyaki marinade, water and vinegar (i used pickle juice). Lucky i had on hand star anise and dried chili pod to soak in marinade.
2) 1 day before:  cook entire 32 oz  bag of Jasmine rice the day before you make the fried rice recipe. Keep cold  in fridge.  *follow the rice instructions on the bag, not the recipe. Use low sodium chicken broth to boil rice. Also, add very generous spoons of minced ginger and also minced garlic (both available in jars) to the water b4 u add rice.  This makes 20 cups of white rice.
2) grill the  chicken breasts. Dont let them burn. About half way through grilling, wrap in foil and move to side of grill with no coals, just keeping warm and cooking rest of way on low heat. When chicken is done, let it cool on counter still wrapped in foil. Then move to fridge to cool with rice.
3) on day of stir fry: quadruple all ingredients in original recipe. Extra veggies used: bag of cauliflower + broccili, bag of cabbage slaw, frozen bag of fajita veggies with red and green peppers and onions,  frozen green peas, 1 entire bunch  of celery, 1 bunch of green

My husband loved this rice. I did make a few changes. First I used brown rice and when I cooked the brown rice I used unsalted chicken bone broth.  And I added a tablespoon of soy sauce and a teaspoon of sesame to the bone broth and rice. I make my rice in the microwave so I don’t have to watch it.  I cook it five minutes on high and then depending on how much rice 30 minutes on power level 3. If it’s not done in 30 mi it’s just repeat on power level 3 until liquid is absorbed.  

I left out carrots and doubled up on peas. I also added chopped and toasted cashews for a little crunch.  I toast in my toaster oven which has been preheated to 350 for about five minutes.  It’s so easy to make and really good

I made it a little differently, I pre-cooked my rice the night before & put it in the fridge over night. I also added steak to my rice. I seared the steak in the pan with a little vegetable oil & some cut up yellow onion & seasoned the steak, once almost to my liking I added half the cold rice to the pan also with soy sauce. I then started the eggs in a separate pan. Once that rice was warming up, I then added frozen peas & carrots & the remaining rice with additional soy sauce. I also am a first timer & didn't have a wok. So, I used my Paula Dean frying pan & it worked well. Once, that rice was warmed up & to my liking I then chopped the egg with my spatula & added it to the Rice, Onion, Steak, Peas & Carrots & let it all mix together & then it was ready to eat. I also made home-made yum yum sauce with it, which was wonderful.

Wow, this was as good as our fav Chinese restaurant! I did use chicken broth to cook the rice in, everything else as in the recipe. HINT: I always have a piece of ginger in the freezer and just grate off what I need. Saves running to the store for a bit of ginger and doesn’t alter the taste

Others suggested adding sesame oil for taste.  It does add flavor but too much gives it an almost burnt taste/smell.

Definitely add green onions, if for nothing more than color.  Diagonally cut to make them pretty.

No need to cook up rice the day prior as some reviewers suggested but it definitely helps to make it up ahead to provide enough time for the rice to cool.

Soooooo good. Probably can cut the recipe in half unless you need a bunch of it (enough to feed an army my mom said). I love it even by itself. Tastes good with stuff on top too. Instead of using uncook carrots and frozen peas, I made it with a cup of frozen mixed veggies (carrots, peas, corn, and green beans). In the past, I took the corn and green beans out, but this time, I didn't want to take the time. It didn't seem to make any difference I didn't. I also added a bunch of little green onions. I made two batches, one I added butter to give it even more flavor and another I really fattened it up and added bacon grease and butter. That was the best tasting one (I know so bad for you). It may be good to add pieces of bacon to the recipe too. I think next time I'll also add fresh garlic.

I used this recipe for steak fried rice. I also added broccoli and beansprouts. Rice is better when prepared ahead of the time and cooled before stir frying.
Definitely a keeper.

I used a carrot, green peas and corn frozen vegetable mix (common in Australia, not so much here)  I also cooked my eggs with a little bit of the sesame oil, and added a touch of mirin at the end, which adds a bit of a lovely Asian sweetness.  I loved this dish. Took the advice of others and also added a small amount of Oyster sauce, which I think added an authentic and deeper flavor to the overall dish.  
As others mentioned, I chilled the rice in a covered shallow dish overnight.

Rice a Roni Spanish Rice used as base and left out baby carrots, frozen green peas, and sesame seed oil which were not on hand.  Added Morning-side Original Griller cooked for six minutes, diced and added Tsang 's Classic Stir Fry sauce at last minute to Griller for taste and served with home made orange juice based sweet and sour sauce using  from recipe on All-recipes. 
Fast, convenient and will definitely make again!

This was easy and delicious. I had some leftover fried rice from a Chinese restaurant in my fridge but not enough for everyone, so my initial plan was to make this to combine them. However, this made enough that I chose not to combine them. Afterwards I had leftovers. The next day my teenage son chose the homemade fried rice to reheat for lunch over the restaurant fried rice. He thought it tasted better.

This was a very good recipe! The only things I did differently was omit the carrots and cook the eggs separately in a frying pan with butter.  I did everything else as written. Yummy!

I made this for dinner earlier this week, following the recipe as it is (plus I added some steamed broccoli at the end). My 5 year old and 10 year old boys LOVED it, and asked for seconds/thirds! They even asked if I could make it again next week for dinner. 

Next time I'm going to add another egg, and maybe cook them separately and add them in towards the end, they just seemed to blend in with the other ingredients and it just seemed weird to me. I might also add some green onions for an extra kick. And maybe add more soy sauce or a pinch of something else (just can't put my finger on it). Otherwise it's tasty as it is! 

Thanks for this simple and delicious recipe!

I made the rice for dinner last night and it was as close to restaurant fried rice as I have tasted. I took the advice of others and used frozen peas and carrots, and cooked my eggs separately then added them just before adding the soy sauce, sesame oil mixture.  One short cut, I used two packages of Uncle Ben's precooked Jasmine Rice. I prepared the rice, then left it cool in the refrigerator. It turned out perfectly. I served it with a simple chicken stir fry and it was a wonderful made at home Chinese meal.

Superb, but needs adjustments.
This is a great basic recipe, but i succeeded only thanks to all the reviews here.
1. Precook the rice, otherwise it gets mashy
2. Cook eggs separately. Just whisk them in a bowl, heat oil in a skillet and pour them and cover. I flipped the omelete and cooked both sides. Then transfered to paper towel to get rid of excess oil. Then cut in strips.
3. Garlic and ginger fried a bit in oil, then bell pepper added and almost immediately the carrots and peas.
Turned out really great!

Great recipe!  I am an experienced cook but my son and I enjoyed the results none-the-less. I look forward to getting better at making this.

Tip: Definitely use a wok unless you are already a skilled cook.

Also, make sure the rice is well-prepared. Mine was too soggy to start with. I deviated from my normal rice cooking time by mistake.
Still tasted good. I steamed pre-cooked frozen shrimp and had it with the rice which was great.

I did not cook the rice before I steamed it. I recommend doing that as the rice was very sticky.  I also fried 2 chicken breasts I cut into cubes in sesame and olive oil til outsides are pale all around but not browned. Set to side and cover.  Add when u add rice and rest

Good easy recipe. I used 3 tbs of soy sauce and 3 tsps of sesame oil for 3 cups cooked of rice. I cook the rice the day before and refrigerated it. I fried a onion carrots and peas then pushed them aside and added two scrambled eggs. Then the rice. Once he rice was heated I added the soy sauce and sesame oil.

Simple and fast, and tasted perfectly fine with instant rice!  My only complaint is who says "soy sauce to taste"?!? A specific amount would have been helpful!  I used about 3-4T.

Altered recipe - used lower sodium soy sauce, added chopped scallions, & cooked thick sliced bacon pieces! Wow!
Have leftovers, so when I reheat it, I’ll add shrimp for another meal!

Easy to make. My family really enjoyed this meal. Since I don't routinely cook with soy sauce, I did have a little trouble determining how much to use. Otherwise the perfect recipe for fried rice.

Thank you for this recipe.
I made the eggs, and chopped them up in the pan with the spatula.  I added the peas and carrots     (used frozen & heated in a pan with a little water - drained) and added chopped green onion.  Fried a minute.  Added 1/3 cup soy sauce, 2 Tbls. oyster sauece, & 2 Tbls. sesame oil (mixed in bowl).     
Mixed in with vegs.  Added rice...stir well & Serve.

This is a really nice, easy recipe that uses stuff you often have lying around. I usually pet extra veggies that I have in so it's a good way for me to get rid of leftover vegetables.

My family devoured this! I added a whole minced onion abd chives but left out the peas. I went easy on the soy sauce but added the dark sesame oil for a unique flavor.

So I made this with a few minor alterations: Amino Acids was substituted for regular soy sauce b/c of gluten (I have Celiac's), and cooked rotisserie chicken in place of the meat, lastly, frozen mixed veggies for the fresh veg's. So the critique, hubby hated the way the Sesame oil overpowered the flavor (used about 1.5 Tbsp), and he didn't add Amino Acids after the fact so it was a little flavor light. I on the other hand did add in the extra Amino Acids,  plus garnished with Sliced Green Onion tops and fresh Cilantro. It was DELISH!! Cannot please everyone all the time.

Agree with drying the rice before cooking, and definitely agree with the oyster sauce suggestions. 

I like spicy, so there's two ways to go- use some hot oil, or throw in some fresh, diced peppers, into the pan first, before frying the rice.

I still used 3-4 TBSP of sesame oil drizzled at the end. 

4 eggs, for sure. 6 cups of rice is a lot.

Made a killer shrimp fried rice. Good recipe.

Needs a little more flavor, but a good basic recipe. Can also mix in various other veggies - we did mini-florets of broccoli and some spinach, and that was nice.

Delicious!!!! The fried rice tasted exactly like Asian rice and I loved!!!! I found the soy sauce to be full of sodium and it added a-lot of flavor to the rice. If you want flavor most definitely add a lot of soy sauce. Very good. I highly recommend.

I had leftover steamed rice. Used this as a base for a quick side dish. I grated some carrots to make them cook faster. I used teriyaki sauce rather then soy, fried it up with some frozen peas and was ready in a flash. Thanks!

This rice came out great!!!! My favorite fried rice. I didn’t chopped up my carrots. I bought shredded carrots. Instead of boiling the carrots separately, I broiled it with frozen corn and then I followed the rest of the ingredients. I didn’t have any sesame oil so I didn’t use that. I paired this rice with a caramelized salmon. My fiancé went back for seconds.

I have been trying forever to make fried rice like you get in the restaurant.  This recipe turned out perfectly.  I have made it 5 times now and every time it turns out. Thanks to the person who submitted the recipe and all those who did reviews.  I pick recipes based on reviews so thanks to everyone.

My rice turned clumpy and stuck to gather. There was no flavor just salty. Very disappointed. Wast of food.
Throwing the rest out.

Loved this recipe. I had leftover sausages that I diced along with peppers, cauliflower, onions and mushrooms (whatever I had in the fridge). Served on top of rice instead of mixed with extra soy. Will certainly make again.

My family loves this recipe!  I make the rice ahead, the more days the better. Otherwise, I think it's great as written, but you can always add veggies or cook the egg separately as other reviewers have suggested. It's flexible and easy and YUMMY!!!

I made the rice the day before.  Cooked up diced onion and garlic and added it to the frozen peas and carrots (thawed).  I added a small amount of fresh ginger root, grated.  Instead of adding the eggs to the mix while cooking I made a "crepe" of the eggs and then rolled it up and cut it into thin slices - adding it last.   Everyone said they liked it.  The consensus was that people like fried rice better when the rice is "sticky" rather than "dry."  This was sticky.

The rice needs to be made in advance and refrigerated.  I would also add some green onions. I don't think you need a full two cups of rice with the amount of vegetables, I would use maybe 1 1/2 cups.

This was a simple basic recipe and I had most of the ingredients. I cooked white rice in chicken broth, 2 teaspoons of soy sauce and grated fresh ginger. I let it cool in the fridge for a few hours. I used sesame oil and stir fried chopped red onion, 2 cloves chopped garlic and some grated carrots. I added the rice, 1/3 cup of soy sauce and a tablespoon of oyster sauce. It was awesome. I served it with the baked teriyaki chicken from this site. It was perfect.

This is a perfect base recipe to start with and make your own.  I added onion, garlic and ginger with the veggies and replaced the peas with corn but that is due to personal preference.  Delicious classic fried rice!

Simple and Delicious! The Sesame oil gives the dish the distinctive Chinese rice aroma. I will make this often along with different main dish.

Sesame oil is mandatory for a genuine Asian flavored rice.   Also, you don't need cold rice.  Just put your dry rice, I use basmati,  in your pan that you are going to cook your rice in and toast the rice until it comes out opaque.  This will convert the starch and make your rice fluffy.  Just follow the recipe from there.

This was quite quick and easy. We used a frozen vegetable mix (peas, carrots, corn) and added some extra corn. Worked out well and quite tasty.

It was an amazingly easy and quick meal to prepare. I had grilled the chicken breast ahead of time and I added about 1 inch chunks into the wok when almost ready to serve. I also cheated on the vegetables and used about 1/2 a bag of frozen stir fry vegetables I picked up at a local WalMart.  Like I said easy and quick. Every one enjoyed the meal.

I did follow some reviews and after rinsing the rice I cooked it in a pan until almost brown.  I combined rice with homemade chicken broth and let it cook.  I cooked carrots and white onion in sesame oil until tender added a bit of mushrooms and then peas.  I added the cold rice with soy sauce. I scrambled eggs with some soy sauce and seasoned salt crepe style and sliced and put on top.  So good the kids and adults both loved it!

I'm not the biggest fried rice fan, but had some smidges of veggies and leftover rice and thought I would use it all up.  It was a good recipe.  The sesame oil really does make a difference.  I used red pepper, broccoli, mushroom, grated carrot and some frozen riced veggies.  I would make it again using this recipe!

It was good but I made it with freshly made rice and as everyone said I think I should have made it with old rice. I find that it lacks a bit of a kick to make it truly delicious but I will experiment with this recipe.

Great recipe. I added celery to the veggies, and shredded chicken as well as oyster sauce at the end as suggested by another reviewer. I also made my rice last night and used it cold. It is a delicious recipe. This will be the recipe I use for fried rice from now on. Yummy ??.

It was quick and easy to make and would be great with some shrimp if not in a vegan mood. The only flaw I saw in it was that it was too sweet. The next time I'll leave out the hoisin sauce.

This is an excellent basic fried rice recipe. You can add other veggies to suit your taste. I added a little shredded cabbage and chopped onion. It does need a little more seasoning-I added black pepper and garlic salt but should've added more. You never know how salty the soy sauce will make your dish so add salt after tasting. Enjoy!

I followed the recipe as directed, and added a little Green Onions and Medium Shrimp to round out the taste. Even if i didn't add the Green Onions, this recipe is an absolute winner.  I made it in a Wok, and recommend mise en place, as the cooking process time reduces quickly in a Wok. I did add a little Sesame Oil. It adds that subtle flavor that we all love, just go easy on it.

It was just okay.  Needed something.  Did cook the rice the day before and scrambled eggs separately as some of the reviewers suggested and it turned out well.  Next time I will add green onions to see if it adds more flavor.

This was easy and came out better than from a restaurant!  I used frozen peas snd carrots (had cooked rice) so it was quickly prepared.   This is a great base fried rice recipe from which to make fried rice to your taste and specs.  My husband does not usually eat rice but he likes fried rice.

I found this recipe to be ok but next time will definitely add some green onions and maybe oyster sauce as it was a bit bland. It also needs more soy sauce than I  thought. Definitely use leftover cooked rice, cold from the fridge.. Jasmine worked fine.

I have to admit I cook my rice according to my normal method a day in advance, so my review is based on the recipe after that point. It's decent, but there aren't nearly enough vegetables.  I recommend adding at least 50% more than it calls for.  (I prefer to double the vegetables, and that still seems a little light, but I know "restaurant style" is more heavy on the rice!)

This was good according to my husband.. but not really like the restaurant kind.
I didn't bother with the first steps of cooking veggies.. I used frozen veggies and added them first with the oil took 1 min to soften up.  Added the egg, then LEFTOVER cooked white rice . It's a great way to use up leftover rice and make it different.

Only changes would be the Oyster sauce and cook all small ingredients separate, I make this for large groups and will add at least 4 cups of diced ham - 2 cups made sweet - 2 cups made HOT with da-bomb or Dave's insanity sauce (to taste), also frozen veggies and quick fry them prior to blending all ingredients together, scramble eggs, bean sprouts - cleaned, can't seem to make enough.

Added the oyster sauce someone mentioned and made sure to fry the rice first before everything to help it taste authentic and not stick. Otherwise, if you use convenient leftover rice, it will be an odd texture not really similar to takeout.

This one's a keeper... Husband and I loved it!  I used carrots and broccoli instead of peas.  I just sauteed both (no boiling) until they were bright, then followed the recipe.  I did cook the rice about an hour ahead of time and rinsed in cold water and refrigerated based on other reviews.  I used sesame oil at the end and actually fried the whole mixture in it for a few minutes.  This last step gave the rice a bit of crispiness and the sesame oil completed that restaurant flavor.

I used single serving vacuum sealed carrots and peas because that's what I had on hand. I thought it turned out really well, and will definitely make it again. Even a less experienced cook would be able to follow this recipe and have it cone out right.

Very simple to make and would do so again. I had read the comments and used cold rice as suggested there which worked well. Next time, I'll probably tweak it a little in some way (just felt like something flavor wise was missing) but it was still good despite that.

Simple and basic recipe, easy to customize!
Fried rice is a great way to use up leftovers! Beef, chicken, seafood and my favorite; Breakfast fried rice, using leftover sausage and bacon!

This is amazing as is, or you can add veggies and spices as you please.  I usually make according to the recipe and top with my spicy Chinese venison stew beef recipe.

It was very good! A tip to make it taste even better is to make the rice a couple hours before so that it’s chilled and it adds a whole new dimension to the dish!

Spread the cooked rice on paper to dry before adding other ingredients. This keeps it sticking together.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I used brown rice and it turned out great! I'm giving it 4 stars because I didn't like how the recipe doesn't specify how much soy sauce and oil to use; I had to guess. I used 2 tablespoons soy sauce and 2 tsp sesame oil. I will add more soy sauce next time. I let the brown rice cool for about 1/2 hour before I started making the recipe and the rice was perfect- not too sticky.

I always read the reviews.  Adding soy sauce to taste was way to vague. Nice other reviewers suggested 1/3 cup  so I had an idea where to start.

I had left over Vietenamise  tofu rice from last night which was pretty bland.  I stir fried matchstick carrots and frozen peas, added the eggs then dumped in my left overs (at least 2 cups rice), added the 1/3 low sodium sauce and almost a tablespoon of sesame oil.  Much better than dinner last night.. 

I will use this a lot with different ingredients like chicken, sautéed onion maybe a little garlic. Great base recipe.

I made this recipe two nights in a row.  I did add an extra egg the second time, but that is probably not necessary for people who don't like egg as much. Some of the critical comments didn't seem to apply when I made this. My rice was warm and the peas and carrots were frozen together in a steamer bag, so I just sauteed those, turned out great both times and this will be a go to recipe for us.

How yummy and quick! I made some substitutions.  I only had instant brown rice from Costco which I microwaved and promptly stored in the fridge to get the rice nice and hard.  I had a frozen 10 oz bag of carrots and peas which I decorated by frying it up in some chicken stock.  I added the rice and stirred until it softened.  Then I added the two eggs, stirring to mix well with rice and veggies.  At the end I added the soy sauce and sesame oil to taste.  The rice is a perfect complement to meat dishes and it's light and delicious.  Will definitely make again!

Pretty good recipe for a basic fried rice dish. I vary my fried rice dishes quite a bit and find this one a bit bland for me. I usually add a spoon full of chili garlic sauce to the pan when stir frying the vegetables(and sometimes a tsp. of minced ginger), shrimp, left over roast pork, cooked chicken or other  meat or substitute. I also throw in a handful of mung bean sprouts or other various vegetables(shredded Napa cabbage, baby corn, etc.). I always fry the scrambled eggs first, set aside and add them later to the mixture, at the end of cooking. A  couple tablespoons(or to taste) full of good quality Oyster sauce instead of, or in addition to some of  soy sauce is recommended. A bit of hoisin sauce and or toasted seseme oil can be nice with shrimp fried rice as well.

This recipe is about as good it is specific. One big rule of thumb when making a recipe, is NEVER say "to taste" and leave it at that. It is always "[certain amount] or to taste." 

Next, I would like to say that I made the recipe as it stated, and although it is more tasty than regular rice, it is still barely passable as "restaurant style fried rice." I would like to comment, that if a restaurant used this recipe, they would soon find that barely anyone ate their fried rice.

That out of the way, I can taste that it is missing a few major, key ingredients. Having never made fried rice myself, I can't pin down what it is, but it is missing some kind of slight, peppery taste, from something green. It may be missing something else, but that stands out to me the most. 

I hope to find a better, more specific recipe soon!

We really enjoyed this.  i will certainly make again.  I added garlic powder & ginger powder along with the soy sauce and sesame oil.  I used frozen peas and carrots.  I did not pre-cook them, but I did boil the rice first.  I used boil in bag rice. The rice was cooked a couple of hours before the stir fry.  I didn't have a wok so just used a deep saute pan.  Everything came out great.  Authentic flavor.  Thanks for the recipe.  You are my first review!

I added some chicken and about a Tbs of oyster sauce.  I'm pretty sure I overcooked the rice, so next time, I will cook it just under the suggested time.  So simple.

It was good - better than white rice with dinner, but I was hoping for more - just don't know what was missing!

Pretty bland and the rice was sticky. It was okay, considering this was a first attempt.

FYI If you're going to add sesame oil make sure you don't add too much, a little goes a long way. I added too much and it turned out horrible. Had to throw away and stick to my Mexican rice. I'll definitely try again tommorrow

This was excellent.  I made some changes used basmati rice, also as I was too lazy to cook the veggies separately.  Made the rice as directed, while it was boiling, added 1 1/2 cups of frozen cut peas & carrots, added 2 veg. bouillon  & 2 chick. bouillon both salt free.  Once the rice was done I followed the recipe as stated.  Omitted the Sesame oil all together & used light soy sauce. This dish is so versatile that you can add any veggies you have on hand like fresh broccoli cut in small florets.  I will never buy fried rice again, as non will come close to this.

Thank you for sharing your recipe with us all.

I followed the advice of other reviews and sauteed the rice in olive oil before cooking in chicken stock. While it was simmering I added the carrots and peas. Once all the liquid was absorbed I added the egg. Definitely a crowd pleaser.

Pretty good! The ingredients were similar to another rice recipie I tried but I liked this one better. The other recipie did not call for an egg, maybe that was the difference. Will make again.

Excellent, easy and simple.  The only change I made and would recommend is the key to good fried rice for consistency is to use premade cold rice. I made the rice ahead of time and spread out on a tray to cool off before making this dish.  This will become my new go to fried rice recipe.

I'm sure the rice was great as posted but I read reviews first as always :) and added some fresh ginger, oyster sauce and fresh garlic. Cooked the egg in an omelet pan  as suggested. Cooked the rice in beef broth and it was a big hit with my family. DH says it's the best fried rice he's tasted and asked if he could have seconds as well as if there was going to be  enough for lunch the next day! Thanks for sharing such a great dish!

A good starter recipe. This was my first attempt at fried rice but I used a lot of the changes from reviewers (using frozen vegetables and using cold, leftover rice). My family really enjoyed it and it was a quick dish to prepare with the changes. My younger son, who doesn't normally like Asian flavors said he was surprised at how much he liked the rice.  I will keep the modifications and make it again!

This was tasty.  I did make a few changes for,dietary reasons.  I used coconut oil and I stir fried my carrots some celery and onion.  I cooked the rice the day before as well.  One last thing...definitely add the optional sesame rice oil at the end.  That really added flavour.  Will be making again.

Super yummy! I made my rice with a rice cooker instead, cooking it in a pot/saucepan works just as well. After heating up the oil in the pan, I added bacon bits before adding a can of mixed vegetables (cooked for 3 minutes in the microwave), then adding the eggs and rice after. 

It definitely needed black pepper, decent amount of soy sauce and the sesame seed oil is a must. My fiance LOVED it.

This was ok, but nothing fantastic. I used the veggies I had on hand in addition to the peas and carrots in the recipe. I found this bland. I guess I want more than just soy sauce to flavour my fried rice. Will keep searching for a better recipe.

It tastes great but had a problem. My well seasoned cast iron skillet has rice burnt to it. Guess I'll have to strip it and re-season.

I loosely followed this recipe.  I agree that the sesame oil should not be optional.  It really makes the rice.  This is what I did:

- cooked 2 cups rice in pressure cooker with 4 cups chicken broth 
-used food processor to chop carrots and a small onion
-cooked veggies in butter in a wok. Added chopped broccoli and frozen peas. No separate boiling necessary 
-sprinkled with Badia fried rice seasoning
-added 3 eggs to wok and cooked with veggies. This is important for the eggs to absorb the flavor
-added 1 cup chopped, cooked chicken
-combined with rice, soy sauce and a generous amount of sesame oil

Not bad but a little bland and reminded me of food court Chinese food.  My recipe from my Betty Crocker cookbook turned out better and included green onions, sprouts, mushrooms, and pork, chicken, or shrimp to give it more oomph.

Good recipe.  I used leftover Jasmine rice, which is the type they use in the restaurants.  I used a cup of peas (because I like peas) and added some green onions.  It was good.  Easy to add a protein if you wanted to.  Oh - I used organic coconut oil instead of vegetable... and it gave it a little extra flavor, which was outstanding!

2* for being edible.  The recipe as written seems to be off on ingredient ration.  Wayyyyyy too much rice to veggie/egg measurements. I ended up using half the rice for the dish.  Sesame oil was a nice touch; however it was still very bland and tasted like it was missing something.  Ended up adding garlic salt, ground ginger and a bit of hot sauce at the end. Tasted a lot better!

This was very good and simple.  I used my own veggies that I had in the freezer, added mushrooms and water chestnuts.  Very versatile recipe.  I also added fish sauce with the soy sauce and made it extra yummy!

Followed the recipe exactly and mine came out soggy and didn't taste good at all.  Don't know what I did wrong? I didn't use too much soy sauce and I DEFINITELY didn't use too much sesame oil.  Whever my mom makes rice, she uses the same amout of  water as she does rice, so 4:2 ratio sounded off to me, and maybe thats why it's not right?

I loved this...I did't add the eggs, but will do that next time...I added ginger and I used fresh carrots and fresh onion.  Sauteed all of those and then used my leftover rice and soy & sesame...frozen peas went in after the rice was added....delicious!

Snap peas if they're available are wonderful in this recipe!

I add either spinach or chard/kale  strands for the nutrients,

water chestnuts or jicama for the crunch.... in addition to the carrots 

& then sprinkled slivered almonds on top before serving!

All  are nice additions as well as the ginger marinated tofu I used!

It's makes for a beautiful platter and full meal for anytime of day and it packs a big protein punch with the easy addition of green veggies!

This rice was easy but, I did tweek it a bit. I already had cooked rice on hand so to that I added onions, karo syrup for a light sweetness and stickiness, garlic powder and the rest of the ingredients. It was a total winner! I was told it had a lot of flavor. I was supposed to use the leftovers for dinner the next night and it was gone by morning! I'm just going to have to make double the recipe for next time but, I will add chicken, beef or shrimp to make a more complete meal.

I accidentally used way too much soy sauce and sesame oil despite trying to be frugal. I will probably add some oyster sauce next time, and definitely less soy sauce, and very little if any sesame oil. It's the first time I've ever used it, and it was much stronger than I expected. I might even add a pinch of brown sugar by mixing sauces before adding them.

This was so easy to do and my husband loved it! Definitely a keeper! I mixed the veggies up with what I had on hand, broccoli, peas, cabbage, bell peppers, to name a few. It still tasted great. I added some leftover grilled chicken to add a bit of protein. I will be making this again.

I like this recipe.  It makes  a lot!  I wanted it as a side dish for two people and turns out that I have enough in the fridge now, for an entire week.  I can add different proprieties each time to change things up a bit. Like, prawns, chicken, pork etc.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made the rice ahead of time -as recommended and had it chilled.  I stir fried thinly sliced pork that had been marinaded in dark soy sauce (available at Asian markets and inexpensive). I used peanut oil instead of veg oil, then added 3 fresh chopped garlic cloves, diced raw carrot, green onions, frozen peas, tsp more of dark soy sauce, then the rice, cooking and adding a bit of sesame oil and dark soy to taste - precooked sliced egg, per reviewer at the end.  YUM. It was good cold, too.  A great starting recipe if you want to get creative.  Really, very good.

Very good!  Easier and quicker to use minute rice.  I used half brown and half white.  A little butter with saute pulls it together at the end.  Also, saute onion and garlic before adding vegetables in wok, then add the egg.

I loved this recipe. I actually misread the soy sauce as teriyaki sauce and it came out just like the resteraunt's!!
Definitely recommend and not very difficult just need all cooked ingredients near by the wok.

I made this quick fried rice recipe with a few variations. I didn't boil the veggies I just sprayed a little non stick in the wok and threw in onion, corn, carrots, and broccoli small jops. Once soft I added 2 tbs oil and 3 eggs, scrambled with veggies, added 3 cups cooked rice. Poured in soy sauce and sesame seeds oil tossed with a little S&P and served. Came out excellent! Made as a late lunch for my family while they were shopping and now I'm trying to save some for them!! :)

Personally, I like to add 1 tbsp of sweet soy sauce to 2 eggs, whisk, then fry in butter in an omelet pan. When its cooked I just roughly chop it and put it in with my fried rice. It's delicious!

My husband and daughter LOVE this recipe.  Easy, fast and a great way to use leftover chicken, beef, shrimp (which I add).  I also added some celery.  The first time I made this, I followed the recipe, then I branch out and  add the protein!   A great recipe!!

Loved It!  My family said it was better than the restaurant.  I was out of carrots so just left them out but will be sure to add them next time.  I added some chopped onion, green onion, and fresh garlic just because I thought it would taste good.  It's fairly versatile with what meat and veggies you add.  Definitely making it again.

I would say it was amazing, but it was good. I usually have brown rice on hand so maybe that's why it wasn't amazing, but otherwise would make again. I topped it off with marinated pork chops to complete the meal.

Fantastically simple! I used brown rice instead of white rice and steamed a bag of frozen peas and carrots. I used sesame seeds and omitted the sesame oil and used 2 tbsp. of Canola oil. It turned out better than the take-out we get from the local Chinese restaurant joint. Will certainly make this again and experiment with seasonings and add-ins.

Made this for lunch today and it came out great.  I refrigerated my rice over night and added a diced chicken breast. Besides that I didn't change a thing.  Definitely better than take out. I'll be adding this to my make again list.

This was great and really did taste like restaurant fried rice. I followed others suggestions and made the rice the day before and used oyster sauce and  fresh ginger (about a teaspoon of fresh grated, use less if using dry, ground ginger). I started with 1/4 cup of soy sauce and added another tablespoon and used 3 tablespoons of oyster sauce. I also added sliced green onions and put those in the pan with sesame oil to start with (I only used sesame oil). I also used frozen peas and carrots and added those to the pan after the green onions. I used a large skillet instead of a wok and it browned really nicely.

My wife makes this with Teriyaki chicken and it is super yummy.  I love the sesame oil in it.  We have started using a cup of frozen mixed vegetables in it instead of just peas and carrots and absolutely love the extra veggies.  Thank you for your recipe!

Delicious but I did make some adjustments that I recommend: 
* I used leftover brown rice from  my fridge, and it worked perfectly. 
*started out sauteing garlic and green onions first
* cooked the egg beforehand (like many others have suggested).
* I used canned peas but tried not to mix too much so they wouldn't get mushy
* Lite soy sauce worked out perfectly fine

Super yummy and easy! I used brown rice instead that I previous had cooked and also sautéed white onion before I added the carrots and peas.  Instead of soy sauce I use Bragg Liquid Soy Seasoning for low sodium and gluten free.

I followed a lot of the advice on here, such as cooking the rice in chicken broth but I did one cup chicken broth, 1 1/4 cup water  and 1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce because of a salt-restriction to a diet. Rice was flavorful, I added peas and carrots(thawed from frozen)onion slices, green onion. I cooked the shrimp in veggie oil and minced garlic, then added rice, veggies, (fried two beaten eggs seperately)eggs and the star of the show, sesame oil. I've never used it before, but it sure did help this dish along! I also added a few dashes of soy at the end. Delicious! I would make again, but the way I did it off of this base recipe.

This is a solid, simple fried rice recipe that works with any veggie/meat additions. My only change is not to make the rice fresh (hence 4 stars). My ex bf is half Thai & he made fried rice often- always with leftover rice that was a few days old. It's drier than fresh rice and better soaks up the flavors of the oils & soy sauce.  I made a half batch since I only had about 2 cups cooked rice. I chopped a fresh carrot & boiled to soften. With the eggs- start with a good amount of oil in the pan & you want high heat so they cook really quickly & evenly distribute among the veggies. I cooked onion & garlic, added the carrots & some leftover cooked asparagus & ham, then cracked in the eggs. I found that 3 healthy shakes of soy sauce and a couple light dashes of sesame oil were sufficient (I find sesame oil kinda strong).

As written, it is just ok. With modicifications it's very good. I added onion, fish sauce (didn't have any oyster sauce), and also did the egg separately before mixing in. Next time I will add oyster sauce instead of the fish sauce.

Love it! Next time I will include more egg, more carrots and more soy sauce. But overall, exactly what I needed.

This was my first attempt at cooking Chinese style fried rice. I found that next time I will lessen the amount of soy sauce and add a touch more sesame oil for a nuttier flavor, I may add an extra egg or 2 as well! All in all it was delicious!  I look forward to making this dish again as it was a hit for everyone else who ate it too. It would come out much better cooked in a wok, however,  I didn't have access to one.  Next time will be a 5-star rating :-)

I love it! My suggestion for the making it is to put one more egg in and not a lot of sesame oil.

was awesome after I added/changed a few things. I followed a few things mentioned in other reviews. I first heated the rice for a few minutes before cooking and then steamed the rice in beef broth, sesame oil is a must, shouldn't be optional, and oyster sauce is the key to the restaurant flavor. my husband is very picky about Chinese food and he loved my rice.

This is the first time I have been really happy with my fried rice.  The sesame oil was the ingredient I had been missing every other time!  Everyone in the house loved it, and there were absolutely no leftovers!

This is pretty good. The first time I made it, I followed reviews and used day-old rice but forgot to double it (since 2 cups raw rice = 4 cups cooked, more or less). I thought the veggie/egg to rice ratio was perfect that way, so now I use 4 cups cooked rice and double everything else except the vegetable oil.

Didn't taste exactly like Chinese fried rice, but still very good. I used frozen vegetables and I used toasted sesame seeds along with olive oil. Turned out well.

Loved how it was easy to prepare.  I used Chicken Broth in place of water.  We left out carrots and peas. We added Shrimp and mushrooms.  Felt it was a little bland, but we realize we didn't put enough soy sauce in it.  We also add sesame oil as well.  We added a can of shrimp in the last minute before serving.--Marie

Added BBQ pork, onions, and oyster sauce. My girls really liked it, but I didn't add enough soy sauce. Would have been 5 stars from them, otherwise.

Other recipes instruct to stir fry the rice--I did not do it with this recipe. That said, because I happened to have leftover rice in the freezer along with a half package of tiny peas and baby carrots in the crisper, I thought I'd give it a try. It was good, but not outstanding.

This was very easy but didn't seem to have a lot of zest or authenticity to it.  I will make fried rice again with some alterations to spice it up and add color.

My kids loved this! I've made many chicken fried rice recipes over the years and this one is by far the best. I added chopped, cooked chicken and used 2 cups of frozen mixed vegetables...so easy. My kids actually thanked me and said it tasted just like the restaurant kind.

This was really good and easy to make.  I followed the recipe to the letter, except I added shrimp to make one of my all time favorite meals, shrimp fried rice.  I just sauteed the shrimp in the oil for a few minutes before adding the vegetables and eggs.  It turned out great and infinitely better than take out from the little Chinese place down the street I used to get.  The leftovers made for a tasty lunch the next day.

I've used this recipe for years with whatever I had on hand - shrimp, leftover chicken, pork and if the cupboard is bare just frozen peas and carrots or mixed veggies.  I too do the eggs on their own and mix them in. Sesame oil is important as is soy - and it won't look anything like the picture if you add enough soy.

Sesame oil and cooking the rice a day in advance are a must. I use most any vegetable in the kitchen ( red peppers, green peppers, broccoli, zucchini).To serve as a main dish, I have also added the flake imitation crab meat from the seafood section of the grocery. Bits of real bacon also provide a great taste.

This is so easy and tastes great. As others have stated cook the rice and put it in the fridge before using it. The first time I made it it came out a bit mushy. Second time I put it outside to cool off (it was about 5 degrees out) and it was wonderful. Making it again tonight to go with a chicken stir-fry.

The recipe is pretty authentic except the rice needs to be COLD.  The secret to Asian fried rice is cold at least a day old rice where a lot of moisture has been released.  Some dark soy sauce is also good.

Loved this recipe!  I made a coup,e of modifications.  i used chicken bullion powder so the rice stayed white. Used frozen veggies so there was still a little crunch in them and made the rice earlier in the morning so it was chilled (i heard it gets mushy if its warm rice). I added shrimp as well just to make it a main dish.

Perfect with leftover rice. Very easy! Added cooked chicken for a main dish. Served with "Restaurant Style Egg Drop Soup" on this site.

The only thing wrong with this recipe is that your rice should always be cooked a day ahead, or at the very least be cold, before you fry it.  This will prevent the rice from sticking.  One other thing I would add is finely chopped green onions near the very end of your cooking time.

This is a wonderful recipe, quick to come together and easy. I did cook my brown rice in broth and it gave good flavor. I think I would like some onion in it next time. The only problem I have with the recipe was that I wasn't sure if I needed two cups of cooked rice, or two cups dry. I cooked two cups dry, which seemed like a little too much, but two cups cooked was definitely too little. No big deal - I just saved the extra for another meal! Thanks for a great recipe!

Update: I added oyster sauce as another review suggested and it was great!

This is a great recipe that my kids love.  Other homemade chines food I make they refuse to eat.  So now I make this for the kids since it's good, fast and easy and something more spicy for the adults:)

A keeper recipe!  Fried rice is so easy and versatile, you can add or delete ingredients as needed to suit your taste.  I added a bit of oyster sauce one time and hoisin the other, both really richen the flavor and provide variety.  It is very important, though, to use day or two old rice when making fried rice.

I'm making it again for the 2nd time in two weeks tonight!  I used Trader Joe's Pre-cooked brown rice brought to room temperature for an easy meal.  Also cooked some diced onion with the carrots for extra veggies for my picky 7 yr old who doesn't notice them in rice :)

Thanks for the great, simple recipe.  I made it just now with Trader Joe's Frozen Rice Medley, which has brown rice, red rice and black barley, and then added some green onions for a little more flavor.  So yummy and healthy!!

This was really delicious fried rice.  However, I used olive oil to replace the vegetable oil, and I added 1 small shallot while the dish fried.  My husband and I enjoyed this rice with Ginger Chicken.

This is a very nice basic recipe. You can spice it up the way you want. And I also added some onions and fresh garlic to it. I think the sesame oil was a nice touch as well. I took the rice to a potluck bible study tonight and it was very much loved!

I made this and it turned out okay, not bad. I wish there were a little more direction on the amount of soy and sesame oil. I am not one of those people who can judge this by themselves very well. And we are the type who go for these simple kinds of recipes. I did add onion and fresh garlic to the wok before anything else. I also had some left over pork that went in. I think without those it would have just been bland.

Yum!  This has been a big hit at my house.  Adding a bit of fish sauce made all the difference in making this taste just like Fried Rice from a restaurant.  Frozen peas/carrots mix make the whole thing a lot easier too!  Also try varying the vegetables, adding scallions right at the end is a great addition.

I Love it! Its Just like the restaurants! I followed the advice of the other reviewers and cooked the rice ahead of time so it could Cool in the frig & then used it later in the day for dinner. The cold rice makes all the difference in getting the proper taste/texture. I will been making this again soon!

Very, very good, although it makes a ton (we may halve the recipe next time)!  We did use the sesame oil, and 1/2 beef broth/1/2 water and are glad that we did for taste.  The one thing that I want to work on for next time, is to make sure the rice isn't mushy after simmering.  The taste was amazing though, and we will definitely make this again!

I use this recipe all the time!  Sometimes I make the rice just to have the rice!  I add oyster sauce to it to add some flavour and usually use whatever vegetables I have on hand

Just ate this delicious meal.  I added more veggies, like orange pepper slices, onion strips and shrimp.  I also took someone else's suggestion and added minced garlic.  My husband is loving it and presently cleaning up his plate.  Thank you.

The sesame oil made it taste restaurant styled. Overall good recipe. Next time I may add more salt and soy sauce just for more taste. Thanks for the recipe.

This was good. The only change I made was letting the rice cool over night. I've been using another recipe on here (Chinese chicken Fried Rice II) but thought I'd make this as a "side" dish. The rice just didn't turn out well for me. I think I'll just stick with my other recipe.

I have never made fried rice before and this was a really easy and tasty beginner recipe. I feel like this recipe could be jazzed up a little and be even more fantastic. I used brown rice instead of white because I was out of white rice and I also cooked this rice in my rice cooker and then transported it into my wok. It turned out great. I will be using this recipe a lot!

so yummie! I've had it the original way, but now I use brown whole grain rice and I only use one full egg and one egg white and no vegetable oil, which I think it equally good!

This fried rice was excellent!  I bought frozen peas and carrots already mixed together to cut back on prep time.  I also sauteed an onion in the oil before adding the other veggies.  I didn't have sesame oil, but I did add sesame seeds at the end.  It was very good and quite fast and simple.

First thing you need to know is to make the rice a day ahead and use it from the refrigerator.  It makes all the difference in the world.  If you make it as written you will end up with way too soft rice and too wet dish.  From there on you can cook it with beef, chicken, pork to make a more satisfying dish.   I stir fry it and once its done, add the rice with the soy and a couple of turns of sesame oil until it has the right color.  Delish!

I think it works best if rice is room temp before cooking.  I like to cut up Costco's shrimp scampi in the oil before adding rice, and I like to add the eggs to coat the rice and veggies.  Sesame oi is a must, but I dont always use soy.

It's delicious ! I add chopped green onion stalks (and sometimes cilantro = fresh coriander) just before serving, it makes it even more restaurant style.

I love the chinese fried rice, and this is so similar...I added boneless country pork ribs (lean meat only) that had cooked in my crock pot for 5 hrs, shredded it with a fork, and wala!  A complete meal in a snap! The only things I changed, was that I added salt & black pepper, a little ginger & garlic powder to the meat!

It's easy to make and tastes really good. Not exactly like the Chinese restaurants here, but close enough for home made, plus much healthier. I tried it with brown rice and it came out great. Left out the peas. Added spring onions and lettuce. Didn't have sesame seed oil so I added some sesame seeds to the vegetable oil at the beginning with the carrots. Thank you for the recipe, will be doing it again and again.

This was very good.  I added a small chopped onion to the mix.  In my opinion, the sesame oil is key.  Otherwise, it'll just taste like soy sauce.  We had this with teriyaki chicken.  Delicious!

Great simple recipe.  I was lazy and didn't boil the carrots and tried to instead leave them on the stove for longer, but they were still quite hard.  I also used green peppers instead of peas and also added shrimp.  I cooked the eggs before hand by slightly beating with a little water, soy, salt and pepper and then frying into a thin layer and chopping into strips.  Sesame oil is sooo good!!

So easy! We left out the carrots because we didn't have any, and added green onion. We cooked the rice in our rice cooker and added the peas in partway through. It tasted great and will become a regular in our house! Can't believe I've never made it before!

I just got my appendix out a couple of days ago and wanted to make something quick and easy, so I went ahead and made this super simple by using minute rice cooked in chicken broth, and I used canned carrots and peas. It was still very good. I also added some minced onion, garlic powder, and just a sprinkle of celery seed. Next time I think I'll use frozen peas and carrots and I'll use brown rice. But, like I said, very good. The whole family enjoyed it :)

My first try at fried rice and it was a hit! I took it to a BBQ and couldn't believe that there were no leftovers. Added some baby corn and green onions. Delicious! Will make as a main dish with shrimp next time. Thank you!

This was amazing!  My husband is obsessed with fried rice but it always makes him sick- we did this version with chicken and cut up chunks of ham and a bag of frozen corn/peas/green beans and it was great!    As suggested, I cooked the egg separately and then mixed it in, but I'll probably try scrambling it right in next time.  I also steamed the rice in the AM and stuck it in the fridge until lunchtime when I made this.    Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious! My husband swears this is the best fried rice he's ever had. I followed the easy instructions except I don't add sesame oil, just soy sauce and I add garlic salt. So good!

I enjoyed this recipe, but did cut a few corners and make some additions.  I used instant rice (cooked in chicken stock) and frozen mixed veggies.  Added some minced garlic to the pan with the veggies and also sprinkled in some ground ginger.  I'll certainly make this again, and might try adding in some garlic powder instead of more minced garlic to give it some more flavor (I was afraid of burning the minced with the stir fry).  The sesame oil is a great addition - don't leave it out!  All in all this was a fast, easy and tasty recipe!

This is the best recipe for fried rice I have found.  We love fried rice and I have added different meats and vegetables everytime I make it.  Great basic fried rice and everytime I make it it disappears at one meal.  Even the picky eaters in the family enjoy this dish and ask me to make it often.  Thanks for sharing this with us.

I made this tonight at the last minute to go with my pork chow mein I made...very quick and easy.  My family doesn't care for peas so I finely minced up a few baby carrotts and about a 1/4 cup of red onion and added it to the hot oil...no need to boil the carrots that way....and I added a little of the ground pork I saved from my pork chow mein, it was just as good as any fried rice we have had at any restaurant...will make again for sure

I cooked some chicken adobe with this recipe and then added the soy sauce/vinegar sauce from the chicken to the rice. It turned out great! I also used frozen peas, corn and carrots to save time. Nice quick recipe.

I always add green onion and whatever else we have on hand (chopped ham, edamame, thinly sliced cabbage, etc). My mother is from Hawaii and I lived there as a child -- we like Hawaiian style fried rice, which, like sushi rice, is slightly sweet. Heat a few TBS sugar in about 1/3 cup soy sauce (microwave), stir to dissolve. Add soy mixture to the rice. I also like to add several drops of Asian garlic chili sauce to the soy, when I'm in the mood for something spicy.

This recipe is great.  I started by chopping up onions and fine diciing the carrots.  Then I seared them on high.  I also added some ginger and garlic.  My rice was alittle starchy.  I need to work on that.  I think it was the type of rice I used.

Realized part way through making that my sesame oil had gone bad so improvised and fried up a couple pieces of bacon, used the drippings and then broke the bacon up into bits into the rice.  Delish! Thank you for a great recipe :)

This was pretty good. I made it last night to give it a try & it wasn't bad but still not quite as good as the restuant. I have another recipe that I used, this one was a little better but its still not perfect. I'll have to mess with it a bit to see if I can make it a little better.  Good base recipe though.

Had to bring fried rice to a potluck at work, friend suggested that I just make  the rice a roni cuz it's "so good."   When I looked at the box, and saw no peas and carrots, I decided to try making my own.  This recipe was just what I was looking for and really good! Made to recipe using the frozen peas and carrots-so easy that way. My friend said it was better than rice a roni :)

As good as you can get. Make the rice ahead of time and refridgerate until ready to use. I used real butter vs. oil. Saute onion in butter first with a little garlic. And the reviewer that mentioned using oyster sauce - thank you - makes a huge difference - I just added to taste. Great recipe!

It was good just not mine or my families favorite. Not sure what it was, was a little plain to us. I made fried rice the week before and gotthe recipe on this site and I think we thought it was the same one so when we had it and it tasted different maybe that was the disappointment.

Simple, quick and very good.  I used about 1 1/2 cup frozen peas and carrot mix.  Did not have a problem with sticky rice.  I cooked the rice and then let it cool on an oil cookie sheet.  Came out very good.  Think I will add green onions and ginger next time though!

I cooked my rice in a rice cooker in the morning, let cool. I also used frozen peas and carrots so I cooked them with a little veggie oil, before doing anything else. Adter "frying my p&cs" I added the eggs after eggs were cooked I added my rice which was one big circle but it broke up perfect. I think the key is to cook the rice until some of it browns.

This was very good. I followed the directions with the exception of adding beef broth to the rice instaed of water as one of the other reviewers suggested, and it gave it a wonderful flavor. My only problem was it seemed a little dry.

This was our first time making fried rice.  It was very easy and yummy.  I gave it four stars because one of the kids thought it was just okay.

I have made this several times and just can't get it just like the resturant makes but, it's close.  We have this a lot and really like it.

This is a great base recipe to work with. I do recommend using day-old rice because it is a little dryer and not sticky, thus being easier to fry. I used garlic, onions, leeks, red pepper, yellow pepper, green pepper, water chestnuts, chipotle sauce, a little chicken stock, pepper, chili flakes and sausage. I didn't use peas or carrots nor the sesame oil, and instead used of vegetable oil used some left oil from some bacon and breakfast sausage I fried earlier today for extra "yum". The final product turned out a little "wetter" than I'm used to, but still very tasty with a kick. Great way to use up leftover rice, plain or flavoured.

NOTE regarding FRYING the dry rice (as per someone else's suggestion)... I always use brown rice, and when I went to pre-fry my dry brown rice on high, it began to burn almost immediately. I left out the vegetables, added chopped green onion to the eggs.  Delicious!

Pretty good. Easy, quick stir fry.  I added pork--cooked in soy sauce for a few minutes before adding the veggies and then the rice.  I used cut up baby carrots, as directed, but I didn't have frozen peas--just frozen mixed veggies, so I used that.  I also used brown rice in this.  Thanks for the recipe!

I left out the sesame and soy sauces and added salt and pepper instead. Very good. I also like more eggs in mine so I added more of those as well.

I just made this and it is pretty good. It was not as oily as some restaurant ones. I would still have to play around with it to make it my own but overall pretty good. I believe that if one was to add some sort of meat it would be delicious as a one dish meal. Great job!

Very good - this makes the perfect fried rice.  I do recommend the following: cook the rice in beef broth.  I also added green onion and some minced garlic.  It was fabulous!

I rate this recipe 5 stars with Tamisa's help.  Thanks for that great suggestions to add oyster sauce.  I have made fried rice many times, but, it never quite tasted like the real thing until I added oyster sauce.Now it taste authenic just like the restaurants....sometimes better than some chineses restaurants. Oyster sauce blends and enriches the flavors...you only need a little, 1 or 2 stirred in at the end of the cooking. Costs about $2 a bottle.  Well worth it.  My grandaughter and I made it together and for a kid who only eats a limited selection of food, she kept coming back for more. I also use Jasmine rice and cook the cold rice in sasame oi; and then I add baby peas, sliced mushrooms and ofcourse bean sprouts.  Thanks Tamisa

Made this last night and it was delicious my husband loved it and so did the kids. I also added extra veggies (carrots, onions, and diced zuccini) to the dish and used brown rice instead of white, which was leftover from the night before! Oh and added cooked pork too. Didn't use a wok and it still turned out great!

Very tasty recipe.  I didn't have carrots on hand so I just used peas.  I also added some garlic and chicken to make it more of a main dish.  Very good.  May have been a little better with some chicken stock added in for flavor.

I have been reluctant to make fried rice and i just go to the chinese restaurants instead.  however this recipe was really good i added the oyster sauce like recommended by another reader.  the more sesame oil you use the more stir-fried it tastes. overall this was a great recipe

Very easy recipe and the kids loved it. I used leftover peas and shredded my carrots, just heated those up in the oil before adding my cold rice. I don't have a wok but it worked just fine in a skillet!

Very simple and tasty. Be careful with the sesame oil though- I went a little overboard with it and it really took over. However, I will definitely make this again- it would work with all kinds of leftovers. Thanks for the recipe!

This is the first time ever that I got any kind of stirfry to come out right. Every time I try to stirfry it comes out sticky and it's not good to eat.  What I did this time is use white rice as the recipe calls for and cooked 6 hours before I made the fried rice. I put the hot rice without a lid in the freezer for two hours. Then I put in the fridge until I cooked.  I made the Yummy Honey Chicken Kabobs from this site and put all of that on top of the rice....it was VERY VERY GOOD!!!!  I will make again

As a college student new to apartment life and low on cash, this recipe is ideal. Quick and easy, and you can really substitute whatever vegetables you have/like. I omitted the peas, boiled some broccoli with the carrots, and added two cloves of garlic, a chopped onion, and some chopped green onions right after the egg. Turned out great, even though I didn't have sesame oil

I have made this a few times, it is an excellent starting point but I have made a few changes that make it better I think. Cook the rice with beef broth instead of water, use frozen peas and carrots eliminate the boiling veggies step and scramble the egg separately.

This was good, not restaurant good though. I used instant rice and refrigerated during prep.I did make a sauce of soy sauce, chinese 5 spice, garlic and Hoisen. Stirred some into the eggs while cooking too. Also added some little sesame oil to the mix. I would call this a good "base" recipe but it needs some added ingredients. My 6 yr old had 2 servings and my husband gave the thumbs up! Thats always a good thing. Will make again and play around with the sauce a bit.

As always this recipe was tried because my boyfriend and I were cooking dinner together.  This popped up and we were super excited to make it.  We did add some green onions finely chopped, minced fresh ginger, and toasted sesame seeds to this.  It was absolutely fantastic!  We also followed the advice of some other reviewers and used a little oyster sauce in the cooking and used chicken broth to cook the rice in.  This was super fast and so wonderful.  I see no need to buy fried rice any more from the local chinese resturant when I can cook this at home.

I agree that you need to pre-cook and cool the rice ahead of time.  I added bean sprouts and green onion to make it more like what I am used to getting in the restaurant, but there was still something missing.  Maybe it was the oyster sauce as another reviewer suggested.

I'm still working on working this recipe to be "just right" but it's a good starting point. 2 cups water for 1 cups rice is too much though, I use a little bit over 1-3/4 cup water per cup of rice. Some sort of sauce in place of, or in addition to, the soy sauce is a must. I've been working with Oyster Sauce and it's getting close but still not quite right. It's good (I have to bring out my biggest metal mixing bowl usually reserved for feeding hoards of kids popcorn), but I want perfect.

This was OK. It tasted like restaurant style if you're at the mall but it didn't match the kind we had when we went to the hibachi grill and saw the guy make it right in front of us. I was hoping to match that freshness. I did use instant rice though (accident) so that might have been the difference. I'll try it again with normal rice.

I was surprised at how easy it was to make this and how good it was.  I added more veggies and I also added beef.  My husband said he loved it so I will be making this again.

My rating is not based on taste alone but also the ease with which an excellent  dish can be prepared.  This is great and super easy.  5 Stars for sure.  You can  even buy sweet peas and carrots mix  frozen, or, God forbid, in a can.  This  is very good, and I suspect that any  complaints come from operator error.   I served this w/Sweet and Sour Pork III  (this site) and am still taking bows.  Try them both, if not together then  separately.  They will not let you down. Thank you, jostrander.

This truly is a fab recipe for fried rice!  Be sure to definitely add the sesame oil, though!  That makes all the difference.  it doesn't take much, though.  I love how easy it is to make this!

This isn't the best fried rice but it is definitely the easiest to throw together and is good enough to satisfy everyone's craving. We cook it with cut up pork chop for a quick meal.

The key to avoiding soggy rice is to cook the rice with a little less water, say 3.5 cups water to 2 cups rice (don't ever lift the lid when rice is cooking like my husband like too) :). I cooled the rice in the fridge for an hour prior to mixing. PERFECTO!

Very good stuff.  The oyster sauce is a must!  I did 1 part oyster sauce to two parts soy sauce.  the sesame sauce is super strong so I would rather use sesame seeds next time instead of the sauce.  This is the closest to restaurant style we have ever had.  Thank you!!!

I thought this recipe was good, but I don't think that it is restaurant-style.  I am still looking for a fried rice recipe that tastes similar to what I would buy from an asian restaurant.

This is a great recipe.  I made it on Tuesday and proceeded to eat it all.....by myself and then made half a recipe last night!  I did change it up a bit.  I threw in shredded carrots, bean sprouts, broccoli, pea pods and thinly slices chicken breast.  It was fantastic!  I do, however recommend using the sesame oil, it totally makes it.  I also recommed like other reviewers to cook the rice a day before.  If you want to make it Thai style, I topped it with fresh cilantro, crushed peanuts and hot chili oil. This recipe is a keeper!!

This was verry good and will be making it again very soon. Top with Srirachas HOT chili sauce to serve. yummm.  I changed two things: I used one cup (uncooked measurment)rice but the correct amounts of everything else because I wanted more substance since I was only having the rice and a cucumber salad. I also used brown rice. I then put on Sriracha HOT chili Sauce (the red sauce found in chinese restaurants. you can buy it in the asian section of most grocery stores).

I thought this was good recipe.  Next time I plan on using the suggestion for making it less mushy/stuck together.  I replaced the peas with diced water chestnuts.  I also used onion powder and minced garlic to add some flavor.  I also boiled the rice in chicken broth.

I used brown rice and added snow peas (added wonderful, natural sweetness), bean sprouts and cilantro.  It was tasty and easy to make!  I would recommend this to any beginner cook - it would be very hard to mess up this recipe!  :)

As my first time making fried rice, I was quite impressed with this recipe and the results we achieved. :)  Quick, easy and tasty.  I agree that the sesame oil should've made the ingredient list.  It really made it something special.  I also added celery to the carrots and peas.  I used the tip of lightly toasting the rice for about 5 minutes before adding it to the water and also had it finished and cold before I added it to the veggies.  Next time I will add the eggs to the middle of the wok like other reviews suggested.  Overall this dish passed the husband test with flying colors.

This was great!  I've never made fried rice at home before, but I had all the ingredients on hand and it turned out perfectly.  I cooked my rice in broth for extra flavor.  It's addictive and EASY!

This dish was excellent. I used leftover rice so it wasn't exactly restaurant style, meaning it was a bit sticky, but it was still tasty. Next time I'll definitely add garlic and mushrooms.

This is a five star recipe after a few modifications. By far the very best fried rice ever. We just ate this for dinner with nothing added. The nice thing is that fried rice is an everything but the kitchen sink recipe. If you have veggie left overs or some chunks of meat chop it up small and throw it in. I had some leftover broccoli and ham along with the peas. I also added probably about 2-3 tablespoons oyster sauce which seemed to do the trick and I added the soy sauce to taste. One correction I personally would make it to fry up the egg first and then add it to the rice, otherwise the egg acts like a binder and you don't get the small bits of egg, just a lot of very sticky tasty rice. Again oyster sauce really brought out the flavor mix and match the veggies and meat.

I have always avoided fried rice because I didn't know what was in it.  I was happy to make this at home.  I changed things a little bit.  I used broccoli instead of peas. I made bourbon chicken to go with it and I used the sauce from that instead of more soy sauce.  2 cups of rice was WAY too much, I used about 1 cup.  My rice was very sticky.  I followed the recipe, I guess it was the type of rice I used.  I will definitely make this again!

I cannot type the word "yum" enough.  I ended up cooking this recipe in a different order because I added chicken but it was the same idea and I used the same ingredients otherwise.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

I chopped half a small onion and sauteed it along with the raw carrots in vegetable oil until tender.  I added 1 teaspoon fresh minced garlic, 1 teaspoon fresh ginger, and the frozen peas and sauteed everything for another two minutes.  I added 1/3 cup soy sauce and 2 tablespoons sesame oil.  I replaced the rice with 2 cups grated raw cauliflower and added it at the end with 1 cup fresh bean sprouts, stir frying everything for about 2 minutes.  Replacing the rice with raw cauliflower makes this a low carb/low calorie food.

Excellent and easy. This was my first time making fried rice. I added chopped onions and freshly minced garlic. I was glad that I waited until I purchased sesame oil before making the dish. Other reviewers are correct -- don't omit the sesame oil as it really does make the dish.

SOOO GOOD!! The sesame oil is what makes this sooo delish! :) I made my brown rice early and refrigerated it like some suggested.  Thanks for the keeper!

I just made this. It was easy and pretty good, not the same as take out but if your watching your pennies and want a good chinese fried rice this is it. I fried up some thin beef slices and set it aside. Added peas and carrots that where frozen and thawed them under cold running water. Heated the oil up and then cooked the veggies and added some onion. I also prepared the rice a day a head of time so it wouldn't be sticky or smooshy. Whipped up the egg, whould use just one next time. Then added the rice and tossed. I used a big wide pot to cook in since I didn't have a wok. It probably would have tasted even better if I had one.

This was really good.  I followed the directions exactly, except I halved the recipe.  Other reviewers were right about the sesame oil.  It made the rice have that restaurant flavor.  My family loved it.

Mmmm!  I made it with boil-in-a-bag brown rice and there was no need to refrigerate rice as suggested by other reviewers.  The ground ginger and sesame oil is a must.  I also took out the peas and carrots because of personal preference and added edamame and bell pepper.  Delicious!  However, I did try to remake this with white rice and I had a slimy clump of rice that was inedible.  Go with the brown rice!

Great! And all the comments were good too...I used leftover rice, and the only veggies I had were peas and cauliflower...stirfried them with some garlic, added eggs with soy sauce, pepper, and a bit of hoisin sauce mixed in, cooked with the veggies and added the rice. It's simple and versatile and yummy...and a one wok dish! Thanks!

I liked how easy this was to prepare, I've always been a bit afraid to make fried rice. I left out the carrots and just dropped the peas into a bowl of boling water before adding to the pan. I was very liberal with the soy sauce. My husband thought this was better than what we get from our local takeout. Many Thanks.

I made this and it was a bit soggy and sticky when I followed the recipe.  So I stuck it back in the pan with a little oil and stir-fried it for about 10 mins, which helped a lot.  I used frozen mixed veggies and cooked the rice in chicken stock instead of water.  I think next time I am going to make the rice a day before as others have mentioned, and invest in some oyster sauce before I try again.

This was my first try with fried rice and it turned out well.  I do not have a wok so I fried in a large frying pan.  I made the mistake of getting the oil too hot...flying grease and a few peas!  I've never scared myself like that in the kitchen.  I started with new oil at lower temperature and it turned out great...surprisingly after my oops.  I followed previous reviews to boil rice on high 5 minutes, no eggs used due to allergies, added garlic powder and ginger.

I usually stink at making any kind of rice, but this still turned out really good! My husband worked as a waiter at a Chinese restaurant for years and he thought it was somewhat comparible. If I make it again,I will try the oyster sauce and update my review from there. Thanks!

This is a good starter fried rice recipe. I like the suggestions of the others as well and will have to try the oyster sauce sometime. I always add garlic and ginger to my fried rice- just a personal preference and ginger adds a nice kick.

This recipe was really good. I was a little perplexed as to what to do with the sesame oil but I just poured some on top and then mixed it in. Not sure if it made a difference in the taste or not. Nonetheless, my family really enjoyed this and I will definatley make it again.

Very good.  I actually used the minute rice, and I think it might have been even better if I had used the long-cooking rice.  I will make it again.

Made this for a party and everyone raved about it. I made the rice a day in advance which was a suggestion from another recipe and that worked well. Also, I used fresh peapods instead of frozen peas and they were delicious.

Made this exactly as stated in the recipe and it was good, but not quite as good as the fried rice I'm used to at Chinese restaurants.  Overall, I think this recipe has a chance for improvement if I incorporate some of the suggestions others made, including adding beef broth to the rice.  As it was the rice made a good side dish, but is not something I would rave over.  We'll see how it goes with some adjustments.

DELICIOUS! Better than restaurant fried rice! I used Boil-in-a-bag brown rice, which was quick and easy. I also used carrots and celery, as that is what I had on hand. Excellent recipe, I recommend it!

This was the best fried recipe to use.  I did tweak it just a bit by using chicken broth, 1 glove of garlic, and 2 chopped green onions.  I have never made fried rice before but will definitely be making this again.  My family loved it.

Very good!  I used a blend of brown, wild and mahogany rice (very pretty and different textures). I cut up a sirloin steak marinated in a little teriyaki, then stir fried. I, also, put a little sugar in my egg  and cooked flat, then chopped it up and added. Of course garlic, onions, peas and carrots. YUM!

Just made this as part of our dinner tonight and it was good! Very simple to make. I used the suggestions of others: used frozen mix of peas and carrots (thawed out a bit), sesame oil is definite must. I added green onion which made it taste even better. I fried the egg with some green onion before anything else and then removed it. Threw the veggies in tossed the egg back in then added some soy sauce to that. After cooking that for about 3 minutes, I added the rice and some more soy sauce. The sesame oil was added after a few stirs. Yummers!

This gets big points for simplicity, and goes great with my favorite sesame chicken recipe.  Would also be fantastic with pork or shrimp mixed in.  However, it doesn't taste quite like the fried rice I've had in restaurants.  Can't quite put my finger on what it's missing.  I agree with those who said that it's better the next day.  I recommend sauteeing some onions in the pan until they are tender before you add the other ingredients.  It really enhances the flavor.  I also prefer a little more egg in mine, and will use low sodium soy sauce next time to cut down on the salt.

This was pretty good for non-authentic "fried rice." I don't think it is as good as in a chinese restaurant but for making at home quickly it isn't bad.  My fiance really likes it and gave it 5 stars. It's good but not THAT good.

Quick and easy! I used left over white rice.  I did not use the cooked carrots. I will use them next time. I used olive oil as it was the only one I had on hand. Whole family liked the rice.

Had leftover pork loin from Christmas dinner so I decided to try fried rice for the first time~Only difference was I used a bag of frozen oriental veggies and processed them in the food processor after they were warmed.  Made as directed and added some chopped pork loin.  My Chinese food loving daughter LOVED this!!  Really an excellent combination and very tasty...a keeper

Let me start out by saying my family eats a lot of chinese food! We love it! This was NOT like the resturants! The recipe seemed bland so i took the advice of others and added oyster sauce, green onions and a splash of sesame seed oil. Those gave it a nice taste but still wasn't close to the resturants. My family didn't even finish what was on their plates and i had leftovers. My hubby took sanwiches for lunch the next day for work instead of the rice. Wont make this again.

How simple was this??????? Of course, I didn't have everything on the list - used a handful of mixed frozen veggies instead of what's listed on the recipe, but it still worked wonderfully. Used the suggestion to add some oyster sauce - yum!

Excellent.  I put a little too much soy sauce on mine which made it a bit too salty, but now I know what to do next time.  I used frozen peas and carrots.

This is a great basic recipe for fried rice. I followed a lot of the other reviewers suggestions and cooked the rice ahead of time in chicken broth and refrigerated it. You really only have to do so for about 2 hours and it will be fine to make. I used Minute Rice, half brown rice and half white. I used the frozen peas and carrots and added mushrooms but I cooked them in wok oil instead of vegetable oil which gave them a much better flavor. The amount of soy sauce and sesame seed oil that you use is really based on preference. Just add a little as you go and keep trying it until it's how you want it. I also added 3T. of oyster sauce based on another reviewer's suggestion and it was great! I made this with the Kung Pao Chicken recipe from this site, with some changes I made to that also and it all turned out wonderful!

Though I forgot to add the eggs, this still turned out well. One reviewer suggested adding oyster sauce, which was an awesome idea. I added around 1/2 bottle and that was a little too much, but still good. I will decrease it a bit next time. Soy sauce? Yes. And I used the frozen pea/carrot mixture from the store, which unfreezes quickly when added. For a final touch, I added some leftover minced steak. I remember loving the steak bits that Chu's--a long closed, but great Omaha Chinese restaurant--used in their fried rice. I served this with sweet and sour pork.

Love this recipe! I've made it a lot - it's so quick and easy! I kind of wing-it now, and don't follow the recipe exactly, but this recipe is what got me started!

Oh and it's great with diced mushrooms!

Maybe it's because I used brown rice, but this recipe was really bland to my boyfriend and I, and we had to improvise a lot to get it to taste okay.  We added a lot of duck sauce and black bean sauce, and I don't know, it was just disappointing.  It's probably my fault for using brown rice (which I don't really like; it was the boyfriend's choice).

This is something I make again and again at home.  I always use leftover white rice from a lunch I have catered every week.  Most of the time, it comes with all the veggies chopped up in it.  So all I do is heat up the oil, scramble a few eggs, throw in the cold rice, add sesame oil and soy sauce.  I even have served this for company as a side dish and it goes over great every time.  Thanks so much for this recipe - It's definitely a keeper!!

This was so delicious!  I took the advice of another reviewer and heated the rice prior to cooking.  I made it for myself, so I cooked all the rice, but only "stir-fryed" about half of it.  didn't measure the soy sauce or oil, but used approx 1/3 c. soy sauce and 1/4 c. oil.  I also used crinkle-cut carrots instead of baby carrots.  It was VERY good and reheated nicely as well!

Delicious and incredibly simple to make.  The prep and cook times listed are serious over-estimates -- I found this came together much faster than that.  It has already become a regular dish in our house, served with teryaki chicken.

We (my boyfriend and I) really liked this recipe!!! However, the sesame is optional for a reason, because you DONT need it!! And the secret for this recipe to turn out the best is to cook the rice a day in advance, and there you have it!!

This was nice, but nothing special. I used frozen carrots and broccoli (I've never been a fan of peas) and sauteed them with some garlic for about ten minutes before adding the rice (which I had cooked in chicken broth) and eggs.

This was tasty and good! The sesame oil is the key! Next time I will fry the rice a little before cooking it. It was pretty sticky...but still delicious!

This is the fried rice I have been looking for! I also added chicken pieces and a table spoon of thick oyster sauce. Since I am not a fan of veggies, I only added slices of carrot (for taste only). I discarded the carrot before serving. hehehe. Overall its DELICIOUS!

It is best to let the cooked rice sit overnight (in the fridge). The rice would have hardened and they will not stick together.

AMAZING! This tasted just like the rice you get at chinese take out places (and I didn't even use the sesame oil)! It wasn't even hard to make. I took someone's suggestion and put the rice only in a pot over high heat for about 5 minutes. Will DEFINETLY make this again! Thankyou.

This was pretty good, but I feel like it was missing something.  I kept adding soy sauce to it after it was prepared.  I had a skillet rather than wok, and it was a little too small so that might have been the reason it didn't come out its best; I'm willing to try it again, of course!

I actually made this and threw in some fried tofu.  I suggest trying that if you're a tofu fan.

Great recipe!  I am rating a 4 star as written - as I use chicken broth instead of water for extra flavor, and that bumps it up to a five star (in my opinion, of course!)

I just finished making this dish and all I have to say is WOW!!! I can't wait till dinner time! I changed it up a bit by adding strips of beef and shrimp along with a can of water chestnuts, white onion, & thin sliced green onions.  This really is a great jump off recipe.  Will definitely be making this again!

This is a great recipe.  We made it to go with the Asian Grilled Chicken (from this site) for a family reunion camping trip.  We made everything ahead of time and froze it in a vacuum sealed bag.  When we arrived at the trip we pulled it out, let it thaw and heated it up on a skillet over the camp stove while we grilled the chicken.  YUM!!!  We now make it at home all the time.  It is fabulous!  I used a bag of frozen peas and carrots and it worked just fine.

This is good.  Makes a huge amount.  I only used 1 c.of rice & 2 c. water.  I used the same amount of everything else.  I also cooked the rice earlier so it did not get mushy.  I did not have a wok, so I used a skillet.

This was pretty good - maybe 5 stars is in order, but I'm not a huge fan of fried rice. I cooked brown rice in chicken broth, and that was tasty. I also added an onion before I stir-fried the veggies. Used peanut oil instead of veg oil. I wonder if I can freeze this - there is a lot! I'm not a huge fan of eggy fried rice - and this was just right. I think I'd add more peas next time.

This was a really good base recipe. I added celery and used frozen mixed veggies for more veggies. I also used half a packet of ramen noodle seasoning (chicken flavor) and it gave it a nice kick.

Yummy! I did the recipe just as listed but made a few substitutions. I used olive oil instead of vegatable oil and I used egg substitute. The second time I made it I marinated chicken in soy sauce and garlic, cooked it, and added it right at the end. Way better then take-out!

Good recipe but like a few other reviewers I thought it was missing something... I added garlic, an extra egg, pepper, salt, and I threw in some fresh spinach as I had to use it up. I'll keep trying different variations of this until I figure out what the missing magic ingredient is : )

This was pretty good.  I didn't have any carrots so I used 3 cloves of pressed garlic instead and I added about 1 tsp of chicken boulion.  I thought it was the best part of the meal. :)

Fantastic recipe!  I made exactly as directed and it turned out prefectly. (Except the regular white rice turned out a bit sticky but it didn't matter at all once the soy sauce & sesame oil went in.)  Next time I will definately add some chopped sauteed onions.  Great recipe to use as a main dish, just add veggies, shrimp, chicken, etc.

Excellent!!  You can also cook the rice in chicken broth or add vegetable boullon too the water.  It adds extra flavor to the rice!  Definately going into the recipe box!!

Good recipe!  It's so easy to make.  My husband liked it very much and when my boys came over to visit they polished it off.  It's a keeper!  My husband and I don't care too much for sesame oil but next time I make this rice I'll add a little and "ride the wild side".  Thanks again.

We liked this fried rice, my roomate who is from hong kong helped me make it.  He thought it was be yucky the whole time but after he tried he thought it was good.  At the end I added steamed broccoli, kale, zuchini, bell pepper and green onion. yum! also added chicken and 2 extra eggs and pre-refridgerated brown rice that I made earlier in the day. very easy too. i think i might go get myself another helping.

I just made this as a side dish to go with Kung Poa chicken. My husband LOVED IT. I thought it was a little bland but it complemented the chicken very well. I will make this again. Probably soon:)

This is a great basic recipe.  I was "starving" when I decided to make it so I changed it a little.  I stir-fried some steak and garlic and left out the peas and carrots.  I also added some sliced scallions at the last moment.  All in all a great recipe that I'll be using very often...

It didn't turn out that great, too much water made the rice very mushy.  I'll have to adjust that next time.  It also didn't taste like restaurant style rice.

Very good rice.  Of course it did not taste just like the resturants fried rice but it was just as good.  The only thing I did different was that I used mixed frozen vegetables, canned mushrooms and 1 clove of garlic.  It came out good.

Great recipe, my husband said it's the *closest* to chinese restauant rice he's had (though he picked out all the peas). Very easy, only change I made was I added 1 tsp minced garlic.

I think this recipe is a bit off when it asks you to use four cups of water and only two cups of rice!  It makes the rice too wet for this recipe.  I did it by the directions first and it ended up mushy!  Then I redid it and cooked the rice according to the box directions and then followed the rest of the recipe and it was way, way better.  I dont want my rice mushy I want it a little drier!  Not a bad recipe but it did not taste like restraunt style rice...I will probably make it again with some adjustments...thanks

Pretty good, and sure easy - but not quite like our local restaurant.  Something's not totally right (and I did include the sesame oil).  I'll try again - and it was good, worth a try

I made this using leftover rice and it was very tasty.  I will definitely make it again when I have leftovers.  The only other change I made was that I didn't have peas so I made it with corn and it was still really good.

This was excellent.  The only change I made was to add 6 cloves of finely chopped garlic to the eggs while I was cooking them.  It seems like a lot of garlic, but it was a nice flavor combo with the soy sauce.  YUM!!!!!

This was ok but lacked a little zing.  I used brown rice and made my rice in the morning and refrigerated it for the day so that it would make a better fried rice.  I would possibly make again but trying add something "extra."

It was easy, but perhaps too easy.  My rice turned out "too sticky" (my opinion), and "too eggy" (my husband's opinion".  The seasoning wasn't that great either, and I guess it was partially my fault, but suggestions or proportions for the soy sauce and sesame oil might have been nice.  I wouldn't make it again.  It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't that great.

This is an excellent recipe and very intuitive. I only has sushi rice so I used that and I used frozen carrots and peas for the vegetables. I'll be making it again soon.

very easy and very good!  Used a bag of frozen veggies with corn, peas and carrots in it.  Could add a bouillon cube to the rice for more flavor.  Turned out great!

Great, easy recipe. Used left-over white rice from another meal and it turned out great.

Great stuff.  This could almost be its own meal, it was that good and filling.  I have a feeling that this will become a new house standard.

I was very disappointed - this didn't have much flavor and certainly didn't taste like fried rice in a restaurant!  Thanks anyway!

This is really good.  Everyone loved it and wanted seconds.  I changed it up a bit and had the rice already pre-cooked.  I also added in shrimp, chicken and beef which I fried individually in the sesame oil.  After browning the meats I added the salt to taste in each.  I did not boil the carrots but stir fried them in the sesame oil then added 1/4 can of baby peas.  It had really good flavor and I will definitely be making this again.  It did not look like your traditional fried rice but it was still good.  Thanks for the great recipe.

It didn't taste as good as I thought it would. I might have added too much sesame oil seeing as how the recipe didnt have a precise measurement as to how much to use. I also thought it would have more flavor.

Very good fried rice.  The recipe was very quick and easy to prepare.  I'm going to cut the recipe in half next time because there was way too much for my family of 5.  Thank you for the recipe.

This is as outstanding in taste as it is in ease! I am super impressed! It really helps if you can prepare the white rice a day ahead and then start step 2 on the day of serving. Do saute chopped onions in the vegetable oil before adding the eggs. I served this with Teriyaki Marinated Chicken for dinner tonight and it was delicious! Thanks jostrander for the post :-)

This one is very good. You can add several things to this rice. Sausage or cubed ham is also good. I'd add a third egg for the amount of rice this makes. Don't leave out the sesame oil. This really makes the difference.

This is really good and really simple to make.  I used 1/2 of a 16oz bag of frozen carrots and peas (I just boiled them as per the peas), a T of Hoisin sauce, a few green onions and 1 extra egg.  The sesame oil was a great touch. Very good!
