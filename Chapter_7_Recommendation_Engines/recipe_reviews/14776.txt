It definitely is a sweet main dish, so don't forget to make some sides to even it out.  Uncle Ben's long grain and wild rice went very well.  I made a few teeny changes, no mace, cranberries, or apple juice... so I used cardamom, dried dates and apple cider.  For a prettier presentation, slice the squash into french fry shapes, and leave the apples in wedge shapes.  All the cubing is ugly and a lot more work...

I love this dish. It has all the wonderful flavors of fall. The butternut squash takes on a wonderful sweet taste due to the brown sugar and spices. I used apple cider the last time I made it as that is what I had on hand and it made the flavor even more intense.

Wonderful holiday dish! I'm not usually one for pork, but... WOW! For the sake of presentation, I kept the pork tenderlion whole (instead of cubing it as the recipe suggests). I cooked it in the oven for between 1-2 hours (you need to monitor it since ovens differ). I also couldn't find any butternut squash so I omitted that completely. Finally, since I didn't want to go out and buy cloves and mace just for this recipe I used Allspice instead. It was fantastic! I'll definately be making this one again!

My guests were impressed by this dish and it was very tasty.  It was also a lot of work!  I liked making something out-of-the-ordinary, but I will not go through the effort of preparing this dish on a regular basis - special occasions only.  Glad to add it to my recipe box though!

Great recipe for a fall day. I only made two small changes; I omitted the salt and pepper and added them later and instead of apple juice I used apple spiced wine. This one is a keeper! Excellent leftovers as well if there is any left!

No apple juice used apple cider vinegar.  Turned out very well will all spice instead of mace and cloves.  Next time I am gong to throw a can of pineapple chuncks in at the end.  Just long enough to heat up.

This sounded so good, and what few reviews it had gotten were all good. I didn't like it much at all. I love squash and pork, but their flavor was completely overwhelmed by the spices. It was like having potpourri for dinner. Might have made a good salsa, omitting the squash, for a whole pork tenderloin.

Great recipe!  It was delicious and tender.  I had fresh cranberries (yay fall!) so used those, reduced the apple, subbed cranberry juice and maple syrup and served with egg noodles and steamed greens and it was outstandingly scrumptious.

FANTASTIC recipe!  I did not use mace and used pears instead of apples. My husband absolutely loved it. I'll definitely make it again. Great dish for company.

I was so disappointed  in this recipe!  The tenderloin turned out fine but following the directions for the butternut squash and other vegetables proved to be the downfall of this dish!  Per instructions, I cubed the squash and boiled for the amount of  stated.  When combining with other ingredients, they turned to mush and the whole dish was a big mess. I am a caterer so I do know how to cook! The picture and instructions are not the same!  I would not recommend this recipe!

This is a great looking meal for a small price with a great taste.  I didn't have pears and pear juice so I used apples and orange juice.  I also substituted acorn squash but prepared the squash separately.  I'll use it sometime when entertaining guests.

This is an excellent one pot meal.  It is pretty sweet, so I may cut the brown sugar back by half next time.   We swapped raisins in for the cranberries due to allergy issues, but I imagine cranberries would be excellent, adding a bit of tart into the sweet.

This was great! I substituted sweet potato for the butternut squash and, like others, used allspice instead of mace. It was pretty and delicious! Definitely will make this again.

This took longer than the recipe calls for because there is a lot of prep work in chopping the squash, onions and apples.  I tripled the recipe due to my large family.  My boys loved it, I felt it was a little too sweet, but will make again as it was a hit with my three teenage sons.

I left out the brown sugar and then forgot the walnuts - still delicious!  I love the combination of spices, butternut squash and apples.   Thanks!

It smelled so amazing while cooking! It tasted just as good! I substituted 1/2 cup raw cranberries for the full cup of dried, to reduce the sugar - and I used cranberry juice instead of apple juice. Wonderful! Thank you!

My family loved this recipe!  My daughter is learning to cook this summer and she said that it smelled like Christmas in a pan!  Yum!
