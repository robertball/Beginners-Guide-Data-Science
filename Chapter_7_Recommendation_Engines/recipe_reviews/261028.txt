Excellent! My only complaint is that you can only do two at a time with one wooden spoon. There is only enough room to drape 2 shells over the handle. Easy solution to that is to use two spoons. I have an even better solution to that. All of my wooden spoons have a round handle which worked fine but for the last two I used a wood ruler covered in foil which resulted in  stand up taco shells. How perfect is that? I was skeptical that 1/2 cup of cheese wasn't enough for 1 shell but it is actually perfect. One other recommendation I have is to blot your shell with a paper towel to remove excess grease prior to shaping it over your spoon/ruler. This was tasty and fun!

My husband and I are in keto taco heaven.  These cheese shells were terrific.  It's funny how giddy one can get finding a keto alternative for old favorites.   Only tiny tweak I made was to sprinkle cracked black pepper on the cheese circles before baking.  It also helped to dab excess grease off of baked taco shells with paper towels.  They stayed fairly pliable, and quite honestly held a lot of "taco stuffings" together better than most corn or flour shells.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I will make this again. I used my rolling pin wrapped in tin foil to form the cheese shells. This time I made chicken tacos next time I will make taco meat using old El Paso low sodium seasoning or Louise kemp’s seafood mix.

SO fantastic!  I made these with goat cheese (easier to digest) and they were great!  They were way more pliable and less brittle than expected.  They did not break at all.  I only cooked them for 6 mins; I might try cooking them for 8 mins next time so they're not quite as chewy.  Very rich.  You don't need to add cheese!  Will use this recipe from now on for tacos!

Cook no more than 6 min! Any longer and they get too crisp and taste burnt. At 6 min they are flexible after cooling. Watch for seeping oil draining off them while they cool. I cut the parchment paper into 4 pieces after cooking and picked up the shell with the parchment paper, hanging them both (keeping parchment paper under the cooked shell) over the side of a lipped cookie sheet. They did not stay firm, but were flexible and soft like a flour tortilla. I dabbed them with a paper towel to remove the excess oil and make it more pleasant to eat holding in the hand. Refrigerated well and warmed up in microwave. Just do not fold over to warm up---it will stick together. Very light and tasty.

Fantastic. Lower quality cheese leaves the fingers just slightly greasy, a higher quality (non-store brand) should be a bit better!

We really loved them. You can’t eat to many but delish. Make sure you cook full time for best results.

Delicious!  A meal where the kids could eat regular taco shells while we ate the cheese shells.  My husband and I loved them!  Great idea!

Oh my goodness. A healthy alternative for taco night! I had no problem making these and allowed my imagination to take over when arranging these to cool. HA!
