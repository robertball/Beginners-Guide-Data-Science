Good recipe as is.

If I'm going to make several of these, I will make a simple syrup (1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup water, simmered for a few minutes and cooled) and use a few tablespoons of that instead of the sugar.  This helps to ensure that the sugar is fully dissolved into the drink.  Adds another step, but worth it for company.

This recipe is almost the same as the one we use at my bar. We use simple syrup (equal parts sugar in the raw and water, boiled down) instead of granulated sugar because it mixes with more ease. We also just muddle one half of a lime with the mint (exactly 11 leaves), add ice, measure your rum (we use 2 ounces) and simple syrup, then shake that bad boy to death. Pour into a glass, and top with a splash of soda water. These are crazy popular at my bar. We also garnish these with a stick of sugar cane, but that is strictly for aesthetics. Annoying to make, but so good.

I took advice of others here and made the syrup from 1 part sugar 1 part water but threw about 10 mint leaves and half a lime into the pot and let it simmer for about 20 minutes.  I now have a fantastic mojito syrup.  I made enough to can a batch for future use. My Cuban husband loves to serve Cuban food to our guests and now I can make the mood complete with mojitos.

I've been making this recipe for a while now, but have found a low-carb version for all my "atkins-type" friends. I simply substitute splenda and diet sprite for the sugar and soda--not sure if you can make simple syrup w/splenda, but I don't see why not...

I think the recipe is great but keep in mind that not all varieties of mint work well.  The original recipe (that is, the one served in CUBA) calls for Yerba Buena, which is completely different from other species.

This is my favorite cocktail ever!! I tend to use more mint-and lime- alot more-- also we like turbinado sugar (Sugar in the Raw)instead of white- it has a bit of a brown sugar edge to it that mixes great with the lime. Thanks so much for this recipe.

This is a real mojito drink like at the bar.Making the simple syrup is a must don't subsitute any of the ingredients. I made this for some people who don't drink mixed drinks and know they always request this when we have a gathering.

Picked some mint from my neighbors yard and mashed it in a bowl with an ice cream scoop.  Used the simple syrup technique.  The only problem was I didn't make enough (and I increased the recipe to 6 servings!)

Good guidelines, but this tastes better with a few changes. I used simple syrup and added mint and lime to taste (a little extra). Also, a little more run and less soda ;)Overall, a good recipe.

The great thing about this aptly named recipe is that it is so authentic.  It tastes as it should--not too sweet, with some granulated sugar left at the end.  Almost all the reviews that call for substituting this or that or making symple syrup may suit the  American palate that has been weaned on industrialized food and gulps it down as fast as you can make it, but they will never be more than a faux-jito!

This is very good, but I think the perfect mojito needs a mint syrup (1:1 ratio of sugar or splenda to water, boil together for ~3mins, add fresh mint leaves to taste and allow to cool together before straining). I played all weekend and the mint flavor just translated better when I used the syrup. I muddled a few mint leaves with 1 lime wedge in the glass for effect, then added to taste the syrup, rum, and lime juice; ice cubes; and topped with club soda. This also cut down on the "dirty fish tank" effect of the drink, which never bothered me much but my husband complained about. Fun to make and very refreshing, thanks so much for sharing.

Pretty much the same as my recipe, although I make them a bit differently. I muddle the lime, mint and 3 tsp simple syrup in a cocktail shaker, then pour over ice and add a shot glass of Myers rum and fill with club soda. Perfect every time.

Trust me, you don't need to screw around with a good thing like some people suggesting here - using simple sirup, (2 cups of sugar to 1 cup of water, 2:1), unless you do this for a living and need to cut corners in order to be more productive. 
When it comes to making one for yourself or you friends, just use the real granulated sugar or sugar cube. Remember; muddling the ingredients together and especially the lime and mint leaves, require a good friction, grinding motion which you won't get from simple sirup!Whenever you'd be muddling sugar with citrus zests, granulated sugar is the "secret", it just requires a little extra effort which I think is well worth it especially when you perform in front of your buddies. Also don't worry about needing the "real" Cuban mint....any fresh bunch from your local store or your own yard will do. For a nice change you can even substitute fresh mint with fresh basil. Try it and let me know what you think.

Very good. Made just as recipe says except... My mint leaves were large so I didn't put as many thinking it would be enough, nope the more the better.  OKAY, I did change it up after having a few...so "my" recipe is made in a 16 oz Tevis glass (ha ha) 10 mint leaves,  Kellie & Joes Key Lime Juice, 1 tbl splenda, (muddle) Add ice, 1 1/2 fluid ozs of Parrot Bay-Key Lime,  then fill with club soda.

DELICIOUS! Light, refreshing and a perfect blend of tart and sweet. After reading a considerable amount of reviews and the suggestions given in another review by the author, Brandy, I believe the key to getting this drink perfect is to be sure to use SUPERFINE SUGAR. I was going to try both simple syrup and the sugar to see which one worked best, but I decided at the store while picking up the mint leaves to check and see if they had the superfine sugar. They did and I bought it.  This is definitely the key to adding the sugar easily. I used a mortar and pestle to muddle the ingredients and the superfine sugar just melted into the lime juice beautifully and completely with zero effort. The full dissolving of the sugar meant that it was going to mix into the drink evenly and give the proper amount of sweetness in every sip. I'll continue to use the superfine sugar because it's so easy and quick.
I also splurged on a beautiful bottle of white rum called Oronoco
and I believe that also made a big difference. My finished drink was smooth, perfectly sweet and tart and beautiful to look at. And I'm sure it's easy to overdo it - this cocktail went down way too easily!I used a swizzle stick and stirred it every now and then to keep mixing the flavors as I sipped it. I felt like I was on vacation. This is going to be my new special summer drink and I'm going to make another one this afternoon since it's so hot outside! Thank you, Brandy!

The ingredients are the same that I use and make the best authentic mojito. As mentioned though, I make a simple syyrup with equal parts sugar and water and I add a bunch of mint to the simple syrup, while on the stove, let simmer for about 20 minutes to infuse the mint flavor, then discard mint, add the lime juice and lightly muddle some mint leaves, for added flavor and effect. It make a mighty minty mojito, but that's how I like it.

Great refreshing drink. I made simple syrup like suggested. I put everything in my shaker (except the club soda) and shook and shook. Then strained into a glass and poured the club soda on top. Then you can throw in some whole mint leaves to make this drink look super pretty. It took me three drinks to get this right! Not complaining. lol

This is the best recipe!  Here is a bit of advice though:
Plan to make 2 or more pitchers if you have more than a couple of friends. These Mojitos go down easily and are gone in a flash!

Hubby and I had these years ago down in Key West where Hemingway was said to have consumed these in mass quantities.  I like to put a bit of sugar in the glass (tall pint type) with the mint leaves as it helps to pull the oil out of the mint when muddling.  I then add mint simple syrup to taste.  (easy to make, just add mint to the syrup at the end of your cooking time and let steep for 15 minutes) Also you can use plain water or seltzer or sprite or whatever tickles your palate.  These are dangerous and super yum!

The perfect summer beverage!  So refreshing & not too sweet. I followed this basic recipe but used Molle888's variation and I couldn't make these fast enough! Do yourself a favor and just make these by the pitcher. Yes, they are a little more work, but your guests will really appreciate the effort....Enjoy!!!

These mojitos rock. I like 10-15 leaves per glass, depending on size. I also use simple syrup and everyone loves these. Careful to not mix the lime too much or it will be ruin it because of being too sour. Thanks for a refreshing summer cocktail.

I saved this recipe a long time ago, but only tried it today for the first time.  I bought a plant with fresh mint leaves growing.  I made 2, both for my husband.  He gave it 5 stars, said it was the best.  He drank first one in 20 seconds.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is the closest I've found to a real Mojito like your favorite bartender will mix for you.  It's essential that you use fresh spearmint and lime.  If you don't like the flavor of club soda with the added sugar, replace the soda and sugar with 4oz of your favorite lemon/lime drink.

We made this last night, but we used Tonic Water instead of club soda (because it's not as bitter), & I'm so glad we did - it tasted soooooooo awesome!!!

YUMMY!  The only change I made was to use simple syrup instead of the sugar.

Really good recipe.  Nice and clean.  I think I will reverse a step and muddle the mint with the sugar first.  Then muddle the limes in there.  The muddling the mint with the sugar should really get out a lot of the mint oil.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I've had mojito's before but never have I tried making them myself. We really enjoyed this recipe, made as written. Very refreshing. I would though, recommend making the simple syrup as suggested by other reviewers. Also, use "ice for cocktails" from this site which really does make a difference.

Really good! Don't use spiced rum- it has to be white! I use natural sugar, which doesn't dissolve well. I now use sweetened lemon-lime or citrus sodas instead of the club soda & sugar. I also add extra fresh squeezed lime and get rave reviews!

Awesome recipe! Made for 20 using conversion with great results but a few logistic changes as couldn't muddle in each glass per original recipe. First, with all the cleaning, separating and muddling of the mint, it takes about an hour of hard work so start early! First, I combined most of sugar with rum and club soda in jug then used remaining sugar to separately muddle mint leaves in about 5 stages (~20 leaves at a time) with lime juice. The sugar and lime really helped with the muddling. Also, I used a juice squeezer rather than muddling for several lime because it just got to be too much work to muddle that many! I finished it about 30 minutes prior to serving and it still looked great. On serving, I added to a glass on ice and added leftover mint pieces for garnish. I got lots of positive feedback on this one. Yummy!

Great Mojito recipe!  I used maybe a 1/2 T. of sugar (to help with emulsifying the mint & lime), and then used a simple syrup to sweeten the rest of it.  This was our favorite drink this summer, and everyone loved them.  Very refreshing!

Excellent mojito. Recommend using Cruzan rum to any others. It's smoother and cheaper! If you don't believe me all you have to do is compare it side by side to bacardi or malibu. The others smell like gasoline compared to Cruzan. Doing your homework on liqour makes all the difference in the taste of a good cocktail~ YUM!

Pretty good. DEFINITELY needs all the sugar, plus a little more for my taste. These are a good base, with a little tweaking I think they can be perfect. Until them, I'll stick with the strawberry mojito mix from a local store.

Being the lush chef that I am, I recommend a 2:1 soda to rum ratio. Also use a quality rum like cruzan triple distilled light, not lighter fluid bacardi. This drink is intended to respect a high class rum.  Stuck at work....wish I could pour one right now: )

Very refreshing!  The amount of rum was just right.  Like many other reviewers, I used simple syrup instead of granulated sugar.  I'm going to try making the simple syrup with turbinado sugar next time around.  This drink is perfect by the pool on a hot summer day.  Added: I just made this again with ultrafine sugar and it is heavenly.  Two tablespoons of sugar may be too much for some, but it's just right for me.  Adjust the amounts of sugar, lime, and mint according to taste.  The second time around, I added extra lime and muddled the sugar, lime and mint with the back of an ice cream scoop.

Thank you ! This recipe is perfect.  My husband had the exact recipe (I tried it) we both loved it.  I made mine substituting agave nectar for the sugar( I'm type 1 diabetic) it was excellent as well ( i would use less agave nectar next time) I wouldn't change anything about this recipe!

Good, but a few tweaks make a better mojito. First, stay away from the simple sugar as the most helpful comment suggests.  I have tried it and liken it to lemonade made in the same manner(I hate it!).  I like having some undissolved sugar in my drink.  I use a citrus reamer to juice half a lime and crush it into the the mint leaves.  If I'm being lazy I use enough bottled Key West lime juice to dampen the 2TBS sugar.  Also try using SPRITE (or even ginger ale) instead of club soda.  MOST IMPORTANTLY MIX EVERYTHING BEFORE ADDING THE CLUB SODA/SPRITE.  Then add your carbonation and give the drink a quick swirl or two.  Unless you must know exactly how much alcohol you are consuming dont bother measuring out the rum.  After filling my glass near to the top with ice, I simply pour the glass about 2/3-3/4 of the way full of rum.

I muddled the mint leaves with the sugar with a motar /pedstal and then added the lime as suggested and it turned out great no need to use simple syrup when you do this.  I used 7 up instead of soda water and they were perfect! I also used crushed ice instead of cubes for a different flare!

seriously delicious! My boyfriend loves mojitos and we have a gazillion places in NY that have really great ones and he says this is pretty much the best he's had. I don't get this whole "syrup" talk - it's perfect the way it is. I just should have used more ice =P.. AND I used tonic water, because I wasn't able to find club soda for my life haha.. and it wasn't bitter at all - the sugar killed the bitterness. This is one perfect drink :)

I love mojitos, and they really don't sell them in bars here in Ohio..., only in restaurants. So I wanted to try to make my own, taste just as good as anywhere I've tried them! I tried the club soda, and I used sprite. I liked the sprite better, that's just me though. Thank you for the recipe, yummmm!

Great recipe!  I used agave nectar instead of sugar, and, although I didn't measure, I think a tiny bit more rum than 1.5 oz.  Also used an ice-cream scoop since I don't own a muddler.  Turned out DELICIOUS!

This has been my official summer drink for several years and a tried and true authentic recipe.  The only other ingredient I add is 3 to 4 few drops of Angostura bitters; it does make a difference.  For those looking to cut calories and/or corners substituting Sprite Zero for the sugar and club soda works very well.

This recipe is closest to my favorite mojito during a trip to Puerto Rico. The granular sugar is essential. Substituting simple syrup as some other reviewers suggested saves little time and detracts from the drink. The granular sugar, with the muddled lime and mint, adds to the sweet and complex texture. Serve with one of those wide straws and you'll want to drink these faster on a hot summer day than you can make them (which are still good without the rum, by the way).

Excellent flavor! I have been making these for a while now, and waited until I had fresh cut mint to use (instead of extracts, packaged leaves, etc) in order to give it a proper review. As with a lot of recipes, fresh ingredients make all the difference, and in this case take the drink from good to great! The only thing I insisted on doing different was to use simple syrup instead of sugar, to make sure it dissolved/blended well. Proper muddling is also key to bringing out the oils of the mint leaves (found that one out the hard way). Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

Had my first Mohito. Made the mint simple syrup as someone suggested. Used lemon lime sparkling water for this one. For my 2nd I will use club soda to see which I prefer.
Having my 2nd one now. I prefer the club soda. I also used the spiced white rum, careful now, it'll sneak up on you. I don't own a muddler so I used a wooden tart form, works pretty well!

Made 6x serving for a 4th of july party. Took a while to make but the results were amazing. I also made the sugar into syrup, as some suggested. Friends said it was better than what they served at their bar.

Good recipe, but replace the white sugar with a simple syrup flavored with mint.  (It's easy enough to make.)  Also, be sure to have a muddler on hand.  We used 3/4 of a lime, 3 oz. of rum, and more like 15 mint leaves per glass -- less than that was wimpy.

Very nice, I added an extra splash of lime juice. I also used Splenda instead of regular sugar. Makes it low cal and dissolves easier as well.

As is, yum!  However, next time I will take the simple syrup advice as the sugar does not dissolve before the mojito is gone.  Granted, that doesn't take much time...

Very simple yet tasty recipe. We use agave nectar instead of the sugar. For a little spice, try muddling some crushed red pepper and cayenne pepper in with the lime.

I definitely recommend making a simple syrup as others have recommended. It was not nearly sweet enough, because all of the sugar sank to the bottom and did not dissolve. I would add the sugar slowly to taste, as some may like it sweeter than others. I also used sweetened lime juice instead of plain lime juice which gave it a really good flavor.

When I say mojito, THIS is what I am talking about!  Perfect in every way, this is an authentic version of a refreshing summertime drink.   As an added bonus, muddling the mint and lime is a much better way to build up arm muscles than lifting weights!

Next time I will use this recipe but reduce the sugar. It was way too sweet (which is an unusual thing for me to say!). I made a simple sugar syrup in the microwave first-- it's the only way to get the sugar to dissolve.

To truly make it a five star, use Agave nectar instead of sugar or simple syrup. A local bartender gave me that tip and all of his drinks have been awesome so that's how I made mine. 
Also...because I was making mojitos in bulk for a large party, I squeezed the lime juice ahead of time, no muddling, and used a blender for the mint mixed with some of the juice and rum. Let the mix set for several minutes and the mint "extract" will come out just as well as if I'd muddled the mint. 
About 1.5 gallons of mojitos lasted around 30 minutes...people loved them!!!

Made batches and batches of these for poker night. Everyone loved them. They were super simple and absolutely delicious. I did make a simple syrup (equal parts sugar and water) and just measured out the liquid in the same measurements as called for in the recipe for sugar. Worked like a dream!

I made this with Perrier and fresh mint that was in plastic from the supermaeket. I used Splenda instead of sugar and muddled it with a wooden spoon. It was fantastic !!!!!! I accidentally put in 8 ounces of Perrier instead of 4 ounces but still it was delicious!

Excellent...no need to fool around with the recipe.  I made this with exactly the ingredients and methods described.  I didn't have a muddler...so I used the fat round end of a rolling pin.  It was surprisingly delicious.  I had never had one before.  Forget about the fancy stuff about simple syrup.  Its not necessary.  I found the drink easy and fast to make.  There is something special about how the mint and lime combine.  What a treat.  I really enjoyed myself...so much that I had to take a nap afterward!

I made this drink following the recipe and I wasn't crazy about it. I've made it a couple of times using simple syrup and it tastes delicious! The sugar just doesn't dissolve and it leaves the drunk tasting really strong and the alcohol overpowers the drink. I made the simple syrup using one cup water and one cup sugar. I also add mango or strawberry.

SO good!!!  Easy to make and my first use of my mint in my garden!  Be careful because these don't taste like alcohol at all so it will sneak up on you ;)

Thanks A LOT; I make these and now no place I go out to makes a Mojito that even COMPARES! Guess I need to cook at home more now and whip up one of these to go along with the meal! Only thing to keep in mind is the size of your mint leaves;some can be gigantor-so adjust amount accordingly-or go with the extra-minty version you'll have!

Simple sugar tip:  make ahead & make extra.  Store in glass jar or Tupperware in fridge.  Keeps for a week or so.  Use in margaritas, iced tea, iced coffee etc.  Perfect mojito recipe.

I made this cocktail two years ago, but I've just realized I didn't reviewed it. I must say I am not a Mojito lover, I prefer fruity Mojito, but this recipe is a real deal. Better than any bars can do. I didn't change a thing.

What a refreashing summer drink.  I like this drink because it isn't so acidic and it really cools
you down on a hot night.

When making this I use one packet of Splenda for each drink.  I also grow my own mint in my backyard.  I've been making this drink for about 2 yrs.  It's funny tho, not many places in my town can make them to correct way.  I first drank one in another city and was determined to learn how to make them.  I pretty much do it the way this recipe says.

I've used this recipe several times - it makes a really great mojito! The last time, I used the servings calculator to make 6 servings, and mixed everything in a gallon-sized pitcher. It turned out really, really good - may have been easier to mix with a simple syrup rather than just the sugar, but it worked fine for my purposes.

Ive made these three times quadrupling the recipe. Each time for the sugar I have used 1/2 real sugar and 1/2 splenda and the amount the recipe calls for is too sweet for my liking and not heavy enough on the rum. I have found they tast better using a third less sugar and a couple more ounces of rum.

Refreshing. It's important to muddle, because muddling releases the oils from the mint & the lime peel. Using sugar instead of a simple syrup is also important, because the crystals' grit releases even more of the flavorful oils. I only had lemon-lime soda & no club soda, so I did reduce the sugar. After making & tasting it with the recipe's proportions, I did add a little more lime, mint & rum (personal preference).

OMG! Yum!!! I used 1/2 lime, sliced fairly thin. 1/2 part Simple syrup (1 cup sugar & 1 cup water - warmed enough to help the sugar melt) 8 or so mint leaves; muddled together; then 1 part rum, 3 parts club soda. Then ice to fill the glass. These babies don't taste strong but watch out!

I think that the proportions are a bit off in this recipe -- my guests added quite a bit more limes and sugar to make the pitu palatable. A tip we discovered: if you're getting lazy crushing limes (and who doesn't after drinking a few?), add a tablespoon of lime juice and save some time.

I love it. But if you want a low-carb version that tastes great, skip the simple syrup and soda and use cold Fresca instead. Delish! Pop in a half a hot chile (don't muddle much!) for a little kick.

This sounds delicious and I think just like what I had at a Bunko party years ago.  I look forward to trying it come summertime.  Only one question, if someone could answer?  What kind of Mint to use?  I am a complete duntz when it comes to knowing things like that.

This is a very simple, and very good, recipe.  So tasty! I had to really mix in the sugar with some liquid first, because the first time I tried it, at least a tablespoon of it settled in a blob at the bottom of the glass. For myself, this is fine. If I make this for guests, I'll use simple syrup instead of sugar.

OMG we had this drink last night. It was so refreshing so good and just plain perfect.  If you are on a diet get diet club soda and since it is a cold drink you could use "Splenda".  Gotta make this again for the gang!

Quick and easy recipe that's quite tasty. I made some modifications because I had to improvise. I only used one tablespoon of sugar and that was still a tad too sweet for my taste buds, but still good. I didn't have any club soda so I used lime tonic. It was a tasty treat for a Thursday evening. :)

I really enjoyed this.  Since I'm not a Mojito connoisseur I hope you won't hate on me but I used pure organic lime juice instead of fresh limes. And since I don't do sugar, or sugar substitutes like Splenda, I used a dash (bigger dash than I meant to) of coconut nectar.  I muddled it with my potato masher in a bowl.  Anyway, I really enjoyed it.  I don't know if others would like it the way I made it, but I liked it better than the few I've had in bars.  Thanks!!

I made this recipe the other night. Delicious!! On the second one I only used 1 tablespoon of sugar. @ was a little to sweet for me. Just a tip for you Mojito lovers out there. I went to amazon.com and bought stainless steel mesh tea balls.(about $3.00 a piece) After I muttled the mint I put them in the mesh ball. The mesh ball comes with a chain and a hook. Just put in the glass put the hook on the rim and mint leaves don't float in you glass. I make  big batch of these for our summer party and these keep the nozzle on our container from clogging up.

excellent !!! very refreshing 
I used lemons instead of limes because that is what I had 
I also used Sierra Mist instead of club soda and did not add any sugar
not sweet - but not bitter

This recipe gets a 4/4 for proportions and taste, but 2/4 for method. 

I find that muddle-ice-rum-soda does not infuse the whole drink with the minty, limey deliciousness that I want in a mojito.
I HIGHLY recommend using this recipe's directions, but muddling your mint and limes (first mint and 1 lime, then 2 more limes) in a cocktail shaker, then adding sugar, rum, and ice and shaking until your hands freeze!
Pour it ALL into a glass, fill up with more ice, and top with club soda. The result is frosty and flavorful.

Seriously though, as far as ingredients and proportions, this is now my only mojito recipe. Perfect!!!

Very good recipe after reading many bad ones. I approached only slightly differently by making it the way a bartender would make it. I simply muddled the ingredients in a shaker, added ice, then poured the rum over it. I shook the drink, poured it straight into the glas then added a bit more ice and topped with club soda. There was no sense of granular sugar in it. I used all 4 limes in the muddling, but I rimmed the lime along the glass edge. I also added just a touch of roses lime. I think if you were making quantities, simple syrup would make it easier but it's not required for a couple of drinks if you shake it well. The only downside is that you do get a fair amount of floating mint, but I think that adds to it both in aroma and flavor.

Awesome recipe! THanks for sharing, Brandy! We were sure to use simple syrup and it was perfect. The key is to be sure to muddle very well to get all the flavors released. Just like what I order at a bar!

Great mojito! I used diet seven up instead of  club soda and 1 equal packet instead of the sugar. My husband loved it and said it tasted better than the $7 mojito he paid for at a restaurant the other day.

SOOOOOOOO YUMMY & REFRESHING! Second batch we added a little more lime & sugar. Next time I'll go ahead and make the simple syrup with mint...just so I can make them faster! :) The only danger with these is that they are so easy to keep drinking!

I used simple sugar instead of table sugar because I was worried about it dissolving.  Even using an equal amount of simple sugar it was a bit sweet, but still very good.

Wow. Best mojito ever! I followed the advice of a previous reviewer and made my own mint-infused simple syrup (so easy...just add 10 leaves of mint to the syrup and let it simmer for 10-20 minutes before cooling).  I don't have a mortar, so used big spoon to mash lime wedges and mint leaves.  I substituted syrup for sugar, adding more to taste. Fantastic!

Made this for a group tonight and it was very good. I multiplied all the ingredients to make one large batch instead of individual drinks. Used powdered sugar, and only put in half the amount called for by the recipe. Muddled the mint, but did not bother to muddle the limes - just squeezed in the juice and then threw in the wedges. Turned out great.

This recipe is so AWESOME!!!  I made it exactly as is and it was so good.  I made a second cup and used Fresca instead of club soda and it was equally good but you could add more liquor to it this way without it being overpowering.  I could probably drink 10 cups but I won't.

Love these things!   Sugar syrup is a great idea, and you can make it a good while ahead since sugar is a natural preservative. The idea of less soda and more rum is one fine idea ;)  @nance m - Splenda has the sweetness of sugar, but it doesn't have the physical characteristics of sugar, so you can't make a simple syrup using it. I know, I tried that making homemade liqueurs with Splenda, and it just doesn't do.

I've made good mojitos before, but this one isn't it.  However, I think it could be improved.   It's just way too sweet!  I haven't modified it yet, but I'm guessing that about half the amount of sugar would be more realistic for this recipe.

This is the perfect mojito. My friend does something similar, except he uses a simple syrup. I think I prefer this method, it's much simpler and you can really control the sweetness. I'll definitely never use a mix for a mojito. This recipe is crisp, clean and simple.

If you prefer simple syrup like I do, try adding some mint to the pan when making the simple syrup and steep.  Makes the simple syrup minty!

awesome!  tastes just like the restaurant/bar if you substitute simple sugar for the white sugar suggested here - I made it with the same amount run and simple sugar then followed the recipe exactly.  YUM!!!

Great recipe. I let the lime, sugar and rum sit for a good hour before finishing the drink.  I think that was part of the trick.  Also, I used Bacardi  light rum.

We just got back from Mexico, and were craving this delicious drink!  This recipe was even BETTER than theirs!  Absolutely make the simple sugar (1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup water in a saucepan.  Heat very slowly, stirring constantly, until the liquid is clear).  We used pint glasses, so 2 large spoons of it was plenty.  I followed the recipe step by step, and we all really enjoyed them!

Almost as good as what we had in San Juan.  Goes down quickly on a hot day, used simple syrup, may have to buy some lime juice to make in bulk next time.

Great starting point! As other reviewers I made a simple syrup instead of just the sugar. I also just made a huge pitcher used more rum and less soda. Delicious on a hot day.

YUM YUM. The only thing I did different was to use honey because I can't have disaccharides. If you don't have rum, you can use vodka!!!

Right on. I have mint growing wild in my yard so it's always available. I like how this recipe calls for sugar that you mix in when preparing the drink. I know some will argue simple sugar is a better way to go, but I thought the results were identical. When I made this, I didn't have club soda so I used carbonated spring water and it was a little less tart. I'm going to keep making it with carbonated water.

UMMM! So good- gave 4 stars but would be 5 with my revisions.  I took other suggestions and simmered equal amts of sugar and water and used that in place of the sugar.  I probably didnt use the full amt of club soda- just topped it off.  Very refreshing and yummy.  Add more sugar to taste- I like mine sweet...

This recipe is very close to the mojitos we had in Cuba a few weeks ago. I never really follow recipes exactly, but the proportions on this one are right, and that's what I was looking for. Recommended!

Absolutely delicious! I made this exactly as written for my husband and we both loved it. I've also made this using various white rums; whipped rum, pure white rum & coconut --all are delicious my favorite being the whipped rum. I've even tried it with out sugar and 1 T both are pretty good to if your watching calories.

This is my go-to summer drink. I have an entire garden of 3 types of mint (some generic type from the grocery store, spearmint, and peppermint) that is basically devoted to making mojitos. Sometimes I jazz it up and muddle blackberries, blueberries, or a strawberry in with the lime and mint, but it's exceptional as-is.

Thank you for the recipe nits a refreshing hot summer cocktail. I did however adjust to our taste preference. I muddled the 1 like wedge then added simple syrup and two more lime wedges and muddled again. I then poured that into a tall glass with ice. I used 2 ounces of white rum with 1 squished lime wedge and stirred. I added a little bit more ice then the club soda. For mine I used dried stevia leaves from my garden instead of simple syrup and it didn't change the taste at all. Then again I'm used to stevia. A solid drink for sure.

Very Good! Mint and lime make for a perfect summer cocktail. If you are looking for a slightly sweeter/simpler version forgo the sugar v simple syrup debate and substitute Sprite/7up or other lemon-lime soda for the club soda and sugar. Also another *hint* can put together rum lime and mint earlier in the day and then strain for a flavor boost using fresh mint for garnish.

I tried this recipe several times and was disappointed; then I varied it by first muddling the mint leaves (increased to 12), then squeezing the lime juice in, not crushing it. Now I can taste the mint without the lime overpowering it. And I used 2 T simple syrup which avoids sugar granules raining at the bottom of the glass.

Great recipe!  Blows mojitos made at the bars out of the water!  Make sure to stir well to get a consistent taste all the way through.  Also, If you don't have a muddle, use the back of a spoon - Works just the same.  Enjoy!

Love a great mojito! I agree with others that simple sugar is a far better bet than plain white sugar. I made my own with one part sugar, one part water, and used the same amount as called for. Just like Cuba!

Best mojito I've ever had.  Best if made in a pitcher, stirred very well incorporating ingredients that settle on the bottom, and then pouring into glasses.  A winner!

After muddling the mint and the lime the drink is full of tiny lime and mint parts. You kinda have to strain it unless you want to drink with "pulp".

Delicious! I dont measure the amount of club soda used but I think it is probably just under 1/2 cup. Otherwise  I follow the recipe exactly. These are delicious. I made this recipe 3-4 times and the last time I wanted mojitos, I spent a good 5 min searching the internet for this recipe - It can't be beat!

As much as my wife didn't want it...you really need to put in the full amount of sugar.  Once you do, you'll have a great drink!  Better than then the one I bought for $7 last weekend.

I thought this was refreshing and delicious. I could totally see being tempted to drink a whole pitcher. The only modification I made was reducing the sugar to 1 TBS. I would use even less next time.

YUM!!!  Try some mango flavored rum....amazing!!  I muddle the lime, sugar, mint...then add the booze.  Add ice...shake, shake, shake in a shaker then add the club soda.  I agree with making a simple syrup.  The best summer time drink.

I've had mojitos at several restaurants/bars and some places make them better than others.  This recipe was right on with the times that i've loved my mojitos.  I love them on the sweeter side.  i added half a teaspoon more sugar than the recipe called for, but making it with what it calls for is excellent also.  I would not go through the trouble of making a simple syrup as when you muddle the leaves with sugar and lime it really does start to incorporate the sugar.  Even when i've gotten this drink when we go out, you still have to stir as you continue to enjoy your drink....our new summer drink for 2012!!!

I make this regularly in the summer. It's a great hit with friends. Very simple to make. Only a few ingredients so make sure you use good rum, fresh mint and ripe limes. Simple syrup works better than sugar. Overall, great mojito recipe.

Good recipe, but I take it a step further.  No mint? No problem, try using basil leaves.  Want to bring down the calories?  Try agave syrup.  I use a shaker for this so the agave syrup mixes in. I personally prefer to use a shaker anyway. I put about 4-6 large whole basil leaves and juice of one lime  in a shaker and muddle.  Then added agave syrup to taste and vodka, along with ice.  Shake well.  Strain into tall glasses filled with ice. I add a splash of mineral water and garnish with a basil leaf.

Basically the same as how I make mine except that I use about 1 1/2 teaspoon white sugar and I use 7UP instead of club soda.   I like the idea of using simple syrup... I think I might try that next time!

YUMMY! I've also made this with Agave syrup instead of the sugar and also with vodka instead of the rum. It's great as written or with any of these substitutions. I LOVE my mint plant!

I think this recipe is better with 2 oz of rum.  :)  Also, I use my homemade simple syrup.

Pretty good.... a little too sweet for my taste, but tone the sugar down a little and after a couple you'll never know the difference. :)

I changed it just a bit to make strawberry mojito's and they were excellent!  I used simple syrup instead of sugar and only used 1/4 of a lime and substituted a strawberry for the other 1/4.  I also used Bacardi Dragon Bery rum instead of white rum and used 2 oz.  My beer drinking husband always asks me to make these now!

Best mojito recipe! Thank you so much for sharing! My husband made it according to the directions and it tasted so good! I will try the simple syrup version if I ever have the time to plan it ahead. :) I like the idea of the syrup and I think I'll enjoy the drink even more with slightly less amount of sugar.

Really excellent recipe, everyone loved it!  I did use natural sugar instead of white, but that's just because it was what I had on hand.  Great stuff, and so much better than any other Mojito I've ever had!

I followed the instructions to the letter and it was perfect for my taste.  Delicious and refreshing, with the just the right combination of mint and lime.  I'm cool as a cucumber as I write this on a searingly hot day thanks to that mojito.

Two Tablespoons was WAY too much sugar.  I made these a second time with 2 tsp of powdered sugar and squeezed 1/2 of a lime into the glass, rather than muddling the lime wedge.  In the future I may also try simple syrup.

I am enjoying one right now and so glad that I tried this recipe....it is delicious and refreshing...I love fresh mint and lime. I did as some others and made a simple syrup instead of the straight sugar. Glad I did because it was smooth and not gritty. Thanks for this yummy and refreshing drink! Will definately be making again during the summer.

This is so good and really easy!  We have spearmint, the best mint, and peppermint in our herb garden, so I used all of them!  It came out really good, but my leaves were small so I added more than 10!

Awesome Mojito.  It's really easy to adjust to make pitchers - I made it for a party of about forty people and I was making pitcher after pitcher.  I followed the recipe exactly and everyone seemed to like it.

I thought this was just okay. It needed WAY more mint leaves than the recipe called for.  We added about 30 leaves all-told, and it was just about right, even with bruising them before adding. Not a bad "base" recipe, but I'll need to tweak it a bit so it suits my taste.

This is a "real" mojito. Very, very good and easy. Mint is very easy to grow in your own garden, so you can have fresh leaves whenever needed.

We used vodka, which was really good - it's probably great with rum too.  I strained ours though, because I don't like pulp.

i thought this was excellent. i added 2 oz of rum per drink because i like them stronger. i used a wooden spoon to muddle and it worked great. i will definitely be making these again.

If this post doesn't make sense it's because i just made mojitos and they were amazing!!!!!!! I recommend using a muddler so you don't squirt lime juice into your eye like I did. Ouch!

I was looking to make a good mojito recipe and found it here. I gave up real sugar so I substituted it with 2 tbsp of powdered Splenda that I use once in a while in a pinch or also you can you Swerve sweetener for those doing low carb or keto. Very easy to make and tastes great! I’m at a party right now and already on my second drink! It tastes so good!

Turned out great. Personally I went with only 1 tablespoon of sugar and I thought that was the perfect median between too sweet and bitter, also used tried and true bacaradi rum.

My husband is a mojito aficionado, and he loves this recipe! He likes his somewhat tart, so I cut down a little on the sugar for him. He likes his with sugar in the raw. I also squeezed the lime juice before muddling to make it a little easier. This gets an A+ in my book!

I made this twice. First time exactly as written. Second time I made a simple syrup instead of putting sugar directly into the glass. Simply syrup is much better. Sugar didn’t dissolve as well when stirred into beverage, obviously.

Great simple mojito recipe!  Turned out like ones I’ve had at restaurants/bars.  I made them as the recipe called, just slightly less sugar.  Don’t bother with making the simple syrup others have recommended.  The granulated sugar helps grind up the mint.  This is going to be a summer staple!

The key to using sugar vs simple syrup, is to use Caster Sugar or Baking Sugar, it is finer and dissolves much faster!  Easy to make, just put 1 cup of regular sugar in food processor for 1 minute...  If you are putting fresh lime wedges in, you need the grit of the sugar to assist the muddler to get the oils out of the limes!!  Makes the drink even fresher...  2 Tablespoons of sugar is excessive, should be 2 full spoons using proper cocktail mixing spoon...

I made this recipe and I absolutely love it! We did this over the christmas holiday which is the Christmas Eve Christmas Day and the day after and I may have put a little bit more rum or what I said extra holiday cheer! But I really enjoyed making this recipe! It's a little hard at 1st and I can be a little time consuming. Then as if you want the right amount of mint oil to give it that perfect flavor. This year in July I was in kabo Mexico and we had mojitos and this recipe is the next best thing to how they make it in Mexico. This is now my go to drink for all parties!!!!!

if you made the recipe just as its listed, you will have a very sweet drink that feels fresh, albeit very high in calories. so dont try to say its healthier than beer or wine. it's still a favorite drink of mine despite all that. 

the only change you should make is to make the presentation prettier. If you pour it from the serving glass to a mixer and back in, the mint leaves should be evenly dispersed throughout the glass. only worth it for guests,  otherwise it doesn't affect the taste at all.

This was sooo good!  I was never that big a fan of mojitos but the farmer's market had some mint and my daughter talked me into buying some.  I followed the directions exactly - using superfine sugar.  I will definitely make this again!

Thank you!!  And using granulated sugar is best because it pulls out the mint flavor from the leaves!  This is the real way to make a Mohito for sure! Delish!!

This is a great recipe for Mojitos! I recommend using fresh mint (I have a mint plant) and using a simple syrup instead of granulated sugar.  Other than that I followed it exactly and they were GREAT!

Hands down the best recipe and preparation method for the mojito. I personally use brown sugar instead of white sugar or simple syrup, I feel it gives it a much richer flavor. Also it's just the superior sugar to use in almost every single case. I also add a few dashes of angostura for flavor and color.

Simple and delicious. Made it exactly as instructed and it came out perfectly. I noticed some reviews mentioned using simple syrup instead of the sugar so that it would dissolve. I had some extra fine sugar in my cabinet, so I used that instead and it worked wonderfully. No need to spend any extra time making simple syrup.

I am sure this is perfect the way instructed, but as I am not a fan of undissolved sugar, I used one tablespoon sugar and 3/4 oz simple syrup (I like it sweet). I also added 2 oz run because that's how in remember my grandma making it. It is so yummy I'm trying not to down the glass like its plain limeade.

I don't generally like mojitos, but I suspected that it might just have just been that I had never had a good one.  This no longer the case... this mojito is really good!  I used fresh mint from my garden, fresh limes, and followed the directions.  The only change I made was that I used spiced run, which is all I have on hand at the moment.  Next time I will make this with white rum, since I don't think the spiced rum 'helped' the flavor.

Why did I take so long to make this?  It's fabulous.  So I made it first with chocolate mint then with spearmint.  I'm a mint lover but the chocolate mint was definitely better.  And I used simple syrup as well  My new Favorite drink to be sure!

This makes a great mojito!  My only change is to make a simple syrup instead of the sugar.

This really is the best Mojito recipe I've found.  We just came back from Cuba again and my family thinks these are even better than those made there.  Of course, I use Cuban rum.  Yummy!

I followed on of the reviews and made a simple syrup to add instead of sugar, and found it perfect. Before I made this recipe, I had also done some research on Mojito´s and found one great tip online, saying not to add lime wedges since the bitter flavor from the shell would come into the drink, so I juiced the lime instead. I made this in a mason jar, so I doubled the recipe, and because I juiced the lime, I used the juice from 1.5 lime, 3 tbs simple syrup and then followed the recipe for the mint, ice, rum and club soda. 
The mojito turned out a little to strong for my liking, so after drinking a little bit, I then added a little bit more club soda and then it was perfect for me. 
I would probably add 1 ounce of rum next time (in my case 2 ounces since I double it) so it wont become to strong.

I love mojitos but also love caipirinhas, so what I did is mix the two. I followed the same recipe but used Brazilian rum instead. Brazilian rum (cachaça) is made from sugar cane so it's slightly sweeter. This came out great!!

Phenomenal. Better than I have had in any bar. Can't recommend highly enough.

I changed the recipe slightly to let the min leaves soak in pure rum for awhile.

This was so good!  I used sugar cubes, because it was the only sugar I had in the bar, and had them mostly melt in the bottom of the glass (because sugar cubes are pretty hard).  It was a great way to control the sweetness.  I just lifted or lowered my straw a little.  Since you can't really drink to the bottom anyway without sucking up mashed up mint and lime wedges, this worked perfectly for me.  I used 4 sugar cubes, muddling 3 with the mint and lime.  Perfect.

Didn't have anything carbonated besides Sprite on hand for this but reduce the number of limes by one because the Sprite brings it all together and it was still amazing. Even adding two shots versus one shot of rum didn't bring out a strong rum taste and it was still enjoyable. Will make this again!

I love me a good mojito. Mirrors taste great and are so refreshing. 

I did like this recipe, but had to make quite a few tweaks to be up to my preference. First, I did make a simple syrup. 1 cup sugar to 1 cup water. If you make a big pitcher, you will need a lot of simple syrup. Second, I added more rum than mentioned. Third, I strained some of the pulp from the lime. 

Instead of the sugar, put some simple syrup and muddle the lime and mint. This makes it a bit tastier. 

Serve over ice, with lime and mint as a garnish.

Maybe it's because I used sugar in the raw... but this was waaay too sweet. In the name of science, I made a second using 1/2 the sugar. Still a bit too sweet. on my third (again, science) I used 3/4 teaspoon of sugar in the raw, which did the trick. I have mint growing in my garden, so I'm going to whip up a batch of simple syrup (equal parts water and sugar- heat, chill, sore in an airtight container)

The Real Mojito is REAL good!  Exactly as written.  I make one change in the process.  I make a simple syrup instead of straight up sugar.  Ensures that the sugar is dissolved.

Delicious!  Fresh and yummy.  I only added 1.5 tbsp sugar, and could have added a bit less.

Simple great recipe.  No changes to the recipe, but check your inventory of rum (only had enough for two....drats).

I love Mojito's and was anxious to try this recipe on Memorial Day Weekend.  The first one I made I skimped on the sugar for caloric reasons.  It was good but the second one I made with all the sugar and 2oz rum and it was fantastic!!  So excited to have a drink I love that I can make at home.

I followed this recipe exactly as is, used bicardi white rum. I just doubled everything to fit in my 24 oz tumbler. I don't see the extra step to make the sugar into syrup unless that's your preference because if you follow the directions and muddle using the lime  and mixing the suger  it comes out perfect.  Great refreshing drink on this hot Florida beach day.

I haven't made this recipe, but I have a super short cut for those who don't have the time or inclination to source the exact right kind of mint. It's called New Age. You can find it already chilled at grocery stores, liquor stores, and not chilled at stores once known to be plus cost. get a lime wedge and ice, and go!

Turned out perfect! It is fun to change up the rum to give the flavor a little tweak. Like I made mine tonight with dragon berry Bacardi rum and my husband used Bacardi torched cherry and I muddled some maraschino cherries in with the mint, lime and sugar.

I made it EXACTLY  as it said and it turned out amazing.  I also added a few fresh cranberries on my second one.. and loved it!  And, you don't need a sugar substitute when you mix with limes and mint first as directed.  It mixes up perfectly.  I will share and make for family and friends.

Very close to the recipe that I got from one of the local famous rum maker factories while on vacation.  A simple sugar recipe is the way to go to ensure the sugar dissolves properly.

I have been making subpar mojitos for a while and this recipes helped me out of that!  The key is more lime and mint than you would think necessary.  I agree with other reviewers in using simple syrup instead of sugar granules, and shaking the drink helps blend the flavours much better as well.

Definitely delicious and dangerous when you make a pitcher! I like to use Cuban rum.  Lime or lemon Perrier water is a good substitute if you run out of club soda.

4 1/2 stars.  I made the simple syrup that other suggested, so I varied from the recipe a bit.  After having 3 strong mojitos...I'm writing this review.  Maybe it's the drink talking, but I liked it!  :0)

I was given fresh mint at our local growers market (score!) and needed something to do with it. Although without the muddler tool itself, I was able to muddle the mint in a glass with a rolling pin and then just squeeze the lime in with a small juicer. I also also used a whole lime instead of half and it tasted great to me. Excellent quick and tasty recipe that is easy to adjust.

I tried this recipe and not having a mortar and pestle I used my ice cream scoop.  It worked great.  I thought 2 tablespoons of sugar was too much.  I ended up having to crush the 4th lime wedge, add a squirt of lime juice (the plastic one), add more seltzer water and a trickle more rum.  In other words a taller drink to cut the sweetness.  I bought my own mint plant today just to make Mojitos.  I think tomorrow I am going to go buy another one - this time the variety with the fuzzy leaves.  I think it will be better.

I  make these often but replace the rum with vodka as rum doesn't agree with me. Every time I serve them I get the same response. "so refreshing!"

The ingredients are good but you'll really need to use a simple syrup.

Definitely a good place to start. Once you're ready to step it up , replace the sugar with one ounce of simple syrup (heat 1 cup water & 1 cup sugar I'm saucepan and let cool) and use 2 ounces of rum.

This drink came out perfect. Followed the recipe exactly. Made 6 batches with 3 limes and two packs of mint. Very tasty. It is on the sweet side so if you are not into sweet, don't add as much sugar.

Thanks for the recipe.  I liked it a lot.  It was fine to me with just the granulated sugar but it did not dissolve like I would have liked, even shaking it like crazy. (if you are going to shake it, don't shake it with the club soda, add the club soda after shaking).  Next time I will try to use the simple syrup like others suggested.

I usually hate Mojito's but recently had a really good one at a local spot, so I decided that I would try making it myself. This is a really good recipe exactly how it is written! I will try the simple syrup trick next time and will update.

Mojitos are my favorite! I sometimes use icing sugar instead of simple syrup as it dissolves easily (1tbsp). Another favorite is to use a tbsp of real maple syrup!

Excellent recipe as is. I didn't bother with the simple syrup - why make it harder on yourself when regular sugar works perfectly?? I just wanted a quick and easy recipe, and this was exactly that, plus it's delicious! It's just like any mojito I've had in bars, so I'm going to stick with this recipe (with the granulated sugar). One evening, I had Malibu coconut rum in the house, so I used that - serendipity! SOOO yummy.

This is a pretty good recipe for a single drink but if I were going to make a full pitcher of mojitos, I'd make a mint-infused simple syrup instead of using granulated sugar.  Granulated sugar just doesn't dissolve very well.  I have plenty of spearmint in my back yard and this is a perfect treat after an afternoon of working on the pool and in the back yard.  Thumbs up!

Not bad, but I would start with half the sugar or even less and then add more to taste.  I like to be able to taste the alcohol and fresh mint!

the "simple sugar syrup" must be made from brown sugar... a bit richer flavor. Go this route and you are on your way to perfection. 4 stars.

I have a fan favourite that is just a little different, 12 mint leaves along with 1/2 a lime cubed, approx. 1 1/2 tsp. sugar and 1.5 oz of white rum all added to a cocktail mixer and muddled, add 3 or 4 ice cubes to a glass, mix a little over a can of club soda with your drink mixture and pour over ice, pour a little extra soda into cocktail shaker to rinse out any remaining ingredients, this will top up your glass, add a straw and enjoy.

Excellent!!! I don't have a muddler so I used the flat end of a wooden meat pounder. For round two, I took out the ice and left the other remnants in the bottom of the glass then repeated the recipe.  Was even better than round one!

Excellent recipe for a very refreshing mojito. Instead of sugar, I used simple syrup. Initially I made the simple syrup, but it kept recrystallizing, so I finally just purchased some (sooooo easy!). Also, my lime tree is not mature yet, and I had some key lime juice on hand from a pie that I made, so I used that. Delicious! Now I need to buy more club soda because I finished the whole bottle. Love to have these while floating in the pool!

Try using Malibu coconut rum instead of the traditional Bacardi! My brother in law is a bartender and he made one for me with Malibu and I have never gone back! I also made a simple syrup to use instead of the sugar, which is how they make it at his bar. Simple syrup is 1 cup sugar and 1 cup water. Let the syrup dissolve in the water over low heat and then allow to cool. These are so refreshing on a hot day!

This is exactly the way I make Mojitos except I use Mango Rum which gives it (I think) a better taste.

This mojito takes some extra work compared to the other better versions I've tried. There isn't really a big significance ofquartering the time and adding it to the glass to muddle. It takes up too much room in the glass that you cannot blend the ingredients together and doesn't add any extra flavor.

Nuff said- in Sacramento the summer gets to over 105- this is the perfect solution. Perfect while BBQ ing make in pitchers for crowds.
