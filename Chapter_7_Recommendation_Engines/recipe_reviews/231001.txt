Superb!  Recipe is wonderful and is easily modified for many tastes.  I usually use the fingerling red, white and purple potatoes for color, and 1/2 cup of white wine and 1/2 cup of chicken or vegetable stock for more complexity in the overall flavor.  To amp of the level of sophistication add 4 ounces of gorgonzola cheese to the mix.  It makes the most creamy sauce imaginable.  NOTE:  to keep your garlic from drying out, brush the top with olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper and cover with a very thin slice of butter prior to baking!  Your taste buds will thank you!  Enjoy!!!

I meant to take a picture, but these smelled so wonderful cooking that we dove in as soon as they were out of the oven. I used dried rosemary because that's what I had on hand, and I halved the recipe since there were just two of us. I regret not making the full recipe because they were that good. I would recommend tossing the potatoes in the olive oil prior to dotting with butter and drizzling with white wine. That way you don't have any potatoes get dried out while roasting.

Very easy recipe. I used russet potatoes because that's what I had on hand and I also cut the recipe in half, as I was only cooking for four people.  I did not have any fresh rosemary so I did a quick online search to find the dried equivalent. The site I found said 1/2 tsp was equivalent to one sprig of rosemary. I was also cooking this along side a roasted chicken (each in their own roasting pan) so I cooked them at the temp and time for the chicken (350 degrees for 1 hr 15 mins)and they were cooked perfectly.  I found the potatoes needed just a little more flavour, but these were a VERY god roasted potato with our roast chicken and steamed asparagus.

Oh goodness!  What is not to like?  The flavors are perfect.  Mine did take about an hour to roast to perfection.  Lovely!

This was amazing! My family loved it- there were no leftovers. I've been looking for a good rosemary potato recipe and this is it! However, it took more like an hour and fifteen minutes for it to reach the level of done ness we like.

Use half red and half white potatoes - some fresh and sprinkle of dried rosemary, added a little bit of chopped onion and followed rest of directions.  This smells fantastic while it cooks and serves up beautifully!  Cooked in the oven as the weather is "iffy" today.  Squeezed and mixed in the roasted garlic.  Keeping warm while I roast the chicken for dinner!  Yum!

I wanted to like this recipe, but it wasn't anything special.  It took a lot longer to cook than 45 minutes, but I lost track of how long I ended up leaving them in the oven (maybe a total of 2 hours?).  There wasn't much in the way of taste in the potatoes, and I'm not too sure what, if anything, the white wine did for them.  Since the garlic did cook perfectly, I went ahead and squeezed it into the potatoes and mixed it all in.  The end result was ok.  I paired this with he "Quick Chicken Marsala" recipe here on the site, which was perfection!  Photos added.

I love this recipe!!! Made just as written. I am thinking of making these for our Easter dinner instead of the standard holiday mashed potatos. I'm making them for the second time tonight but I'm going to add more garlic, that way I have some to put on the potatos and some roasted garlic to spread on buttered french bread. great way to roast some garlic while you are cooking.

Wonderful Potatoes!  We like them with steaks for a change form Baked Potatoes.  They are good with anything. If you like more garlic, by all means add garlic, but we like garlic and this was great as written.

I followed the recipe and there is way too much oil/butter for me.  All I could taste was oil in the potatoes.

Very Good. Cook a little longer than suggested though they were a little hard yet. I might have left then too large.

Will make again!

Awesome!  Although, mine took about an hour and still could have used a little more time to fully roast up crispy, but delicious.  The garlic gets nice and smooth and sweet.  I halved this recipe for two of us and it was still more than enough.  For easy cleanup, I would recommend using a disposable foil pan.

You just canâ€™t go wrong with roasted red potatoes in my mind, and this had the extra pizzazz of roasted garlic.  Yum.  I like them darkly roasted so I used my cast iron skillet.

I made this recipe years ago, but lost it.  I was so happy to find it to be able to make it again.   I used red potatoes, rather than new potatoes. Delicious!

I took one reviewer's advice and used 1/2 white wine and 1/2 chicken broth and added Gorgonzola cheese as well. I was pleased with the overall dish, but it wasn't as savory as I had hoped. Next time I will double the amount of rosemary and try adding a tsp of salt to the broth/wine mixture and see if that gives it a little better seasoning. The garlic bulbs turned out perfectly (with the sliver of butter on top to prevent drying) and we smeared them on bruschetta slices on the side. A keeper I think with a bit of tweaking!

Absolutely amazing!! The roasted garlic smoothed over warm baguette, marvelous!!
I did however not use 4 pounds of potatoes; only about half.  Also I added squash that needed to be cooked. It was also yummy.

Thought I was making too much for two people to eat but they were so good we ate all 4 pounds of potatoes! I do wish I had found larger heads of garlic, the small grocery store kind that comes bagged wasn't big enough.

These were so good! Did up the baking time as mentioned in many reviews. Otherwise no need to change a thing. So much better than just a plain seasoned roasted potato!

Really tasty and very simple to make. Mine did take a bit longer than 45 minutes but my roasting pan wasn't very big so that was probably the issue. I added some crushed red pepper for a little bit of spice the second time I made them.

This is an exceptional dish!  I followed the recipe exactly, except for increasing the baking time to one hour.  The potatoes were crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside with incredible flavor!  They were enjoyed by everyone at dinner last night.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe, Dotty Snyder Grohman!
