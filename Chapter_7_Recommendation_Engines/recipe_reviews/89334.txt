Absolutely delicious! I've made this several times now (I can't seem to get enough of it!!) I double the garlic, cut the butter in half, and only use 1 3/4 c milk to avoid the sauce getting too runny. I've made it with and without soy sauce and it's good either way. My favorite modification has been a few red pepper flakes for an added kick.  So good!!! I will definitely be making this again and again :)

WOW!  This was fantastic and my husband said it's now one of his all time favorite meals.  I did tweek it, however. I cooked the mushrooms in the butter and oil (and cooked them until they were completely soft...about 8 minutes).  I added 4 cloves of garlic and used 1 cup of heavy whipping cream and 1 cup of 1% milk (because that's what I had).  Lastly, I squeezed the water out of the spinach and chopped it finely. I was reluctant to use the soy sauce because it seemed like a strange combo.  DON'T leave it out!  It gives the dish it's wonderful and different flavor.

I definitely changed a couple of things, because I used what I had in the fridge!  I cut back on the soy sauce, added more pasta & mushroom, added parm. cheese and used broccoli instead of spinach.  This is a great hardy meal and the left overs are even better.

After reading all of the reviews on AR, I decided to do the following: Sautee the mushrooms till tender; let weep and throw out the extra liquid... I'll keep it in next time; with the added cheese it could have been a tad 'wetter.' Triple the garlic... absolutely! It would have been so much less without the extra garlic! Add Parm (1/4 cup) and Monterey Jack (a handful shredded) to the sauce. Add Sun-Dried Tomatoes (maybe 6 or 7, sliced)... we loved this... also great with the addition of roasted red peppers. Add black pepper... will add some cayenne next time. Top with additional Mozz AND Parm.  I've made this three times already and my entire family went nuts over it... even the so-called mushroom-hating and spinach-hating members.  This is one heck of a recipe and I wouldn't hesitate to serve it to company. Many thanks, chmadden!

Very yummy.  I was a little leery of the soy sauce, but it ended up being delicious!  Not at all overpowering, but just another interesting dimension to the dish.  The recipe doesn't state, but I did wring the excess water from the spinach.  My sauce was still just the right consistency...I think it would have been too runny if I hadn't done that.  I used part-skim mozzarella and 1% milk and it turned out fine.  Only substitution I made was parsley for basil since I'm not a basil fan.  Thanks!

Made as written, I give this 3.5 stars - I didn't think it was nearly cheesy, and the sauce was pretty thin and watery. However, I added more cheese - a combination of mozzerella, Swiss and extra-sharp Cheddar - and also a splash of heavy cream which REALLY improved it. I also used fresh spinach instead of frozen. This ended up being one of the best things I have made in a while. Thanks!

I swear this is the same recipe i get at my favorite itailian resturant, just with spinach. 
I disagree with some reviews that it could do without the soy sauce. The soy sauce IS the recipe. Without it, it is just a regular cream sauce.
But I agree that you do have to wring the spinach out which the recipe does not mention.
I followed the recipe except that I added a little more flour to make sure the sauce was thick enough and I mixed all the cheese in instead of putting it ontop.
When I make it agian I will make it with less spinach.
Just a heads up though- becuse of the soy and the spinach it is not that great to look at. But it sure tastes good.

5 stars for something different and interesting that my boyfriend will eat!  I used low fat mozzerella and it was delicious.  I am going to double the spinach next time too.  Instead of dried basil I used pesto.  Mmmm!

Excellent dish! My boyfriend said he could eat it every day and not get tired of it. I made a few minor changes - used some random pasta I had (not penne), replaced the soy sauce with some salt and added a extra cup of water to the sauce because it was too thick. It is very important to simmer the flour for a few minutes (stirring) before pouring the liquid in - that will give it more thickness. I'll certainly make it again!

Oh so good. I didn't have frozen spinach so used a 10 oz. bag of fresh spinach. Just sauteed the mushroom, onions, in the oil and then added in the spinach until wilted (yes I added onions)...drain off any juice. I used butter not margarine, added in some grated Parmesan cheese with the mozzarella (eyeballed and more than likely more than 2 cups). I accidentally forgot to put in the soy sauce, and it was good without it, but will make it again and put in the soy (it did seem to need some salt). I topped with fresh slices of tomato and that was a very nice addition. One thing I just noticed is that I used the whole 16oz. box of Penne not realizing this called for only 8oz. But it filled a 9X13 pan perfectly. So wonder about only 8oz. of noodles. Very creamy but not too rich, this is a real keeper in our household. Do put in a bit more Italian spices with the veggies if you like seasoning.
Update: I had a half casserole dish leftover and after 24 hours in the fridge the noodles really soaked up the creamy sauce. I knew it would be dry when re-heating, so I made up some tomato sauce with Italian herbs and poured that over it. It was really fantastic with the added tomato sauce.

Very good and very rich even with low-fat options.   *Used low-fat Smart Balance butter, skim milk, and 2% mozarella cheese to make a little healthier. *Added sun dried tomatoes and parmesan cheese which was a GREAT addition. *Definitely sauteed the mushrooms for more than 1 min though, more like 10-15 and also baked for more like 30 mins. ***Tip: use your egg slicer to cut up all the mushrooms to save time chopping***

A rare occasion that this gal will rave over a pasta dish as I'm not a huge fan, however, this one deserves a big round of applause! Followed the recipe for the most part with just a few minor changes. Love garlic, so I increased that to four cloves, had fat free half and half in the fridge that I wanted to get rid of, added black pepper and a bit of cayenne into the sauce and used half mozarella and half parm cheese for both the sauce and the topping. Our cooking forum chose this recipe for our Community Cook Along and so far, everyone is loving this dish! Thank you so much!!

Along with my friends Linda Mclean and Koalagirl, I made this as part of our forum's community cook along for September and I'm with them!  It's wonderful.  I've made it twice actually in the past two weeks for dinner with the kids.  Everyone loved it, even my youngest daughter who is not a mushroom fan.  I used 5 or 6 cloves of garlic and the second time I added diced green onion.  You can play with this recipe in so many ways.  Very delish and versatile. Thanks so much for sharing.

This recipe is excellent. The soy sauce definitely makes a big difference.  I used fresh spinach and fresh basil, just cooking the spinach down in the minimum of water and then draining it well.  I used the reserved spinach water to cook the penne in as it is full of spinach minerals.  Instead of portobello mushrooms I used an "exotic" mushroom mix - shiitake, oyster, etc., etc., and it was wonderful.   I used mozzarella in the sauce, but scattered crumbled feta over the top before putting it into the oven.   I can wholeheartedly recommend this dish and will certainly be making it again.

I really liked this. If you don't like spinach and mushrooms, you may not care for it. I used a combination of evaporated and skim milk and it turned out creamy and delicious. I used whole wheat pasta (which I'm not a huge fan of) and it still tasted great. Like some other reviewers, I wasn't sure about the soy sauce but I really think it brings out the meatiness of the mushrooms - don't leave it out. Delicious!

This recipe is very versatile. It makes wonderful leftovers to take to work. The flavor improves and intensifies with time in the fridge. This is an easy and very healthy recipe to make (I have made it twice in the first week). This recipe is a nice blueprint for future variations. I plan to experiment by changing the cheese type, substituting soy for worchester, or by changing the vegetables.

This dish was okay, not quite 5-star worthy. The soy sauce seems not to work with the dish. I may have to make it again without that to see if I like it better.

This recipe is absolutely incredible!  I had 14 oz. of whole wheat penne pasta instead of 8 oz. so I upped the sauce ingredients to match the amount of pasta.  I am also a member of the Cooking Forum that Linda McLean mentioned so I took some of my friends' advice and used extra garlic, added black pepper to the sauce and parmesan cheese to the mozzarella cheese in the sauce.  So far, around 5 people from our forum have made this as our September Community Cook-Along recipe and it has been getting 5+ stars from everyone.

I made this as the Vegetarian option for Christmas dinner. It was very good, and I'll make it again with a few changes. The minor problem I had was that I made the sauce too thick. Once I added the cheese, it was so thick it was difficult to mix in the pasta, mushrooms and spinach. Next time I won't thicken the sauce for quite so long. I also had to bake it for at least 10 minutes longer to get it bubbly and brown--probably due to the thickness of the mixture.

ALTERATIONS I MADE: I used 1/4 c. butter instead of 1/2 c. margarine and used reduced sodium soy sauce. I also sauteed the mushrooms longer and added a little of the garlic to the olive oil.

CHANGES I'LL MAKE NEXT TIME:  I'll increase the amount of mushrooms and reduce the penne to compensate. I'll also reduce the amount of cheese or use of mixture of cheeses instead of just mozzarella, which is a little bland. And I definitely won't thicken the sauce for quite so long. I may also throw in some sun dried tomatoes to add a little dimension to the flavor.

This was fantastic!  I veganized, using soy milk and cheese and bragg's instead of soy sauce.  I ended up using all the cheese in the sauce and sprinkling some diced tomatoes on top.  The cheese sauce is great, but I will experiment next time with different spices and possibly wine for some added depth.

Good dish!  It needed something though.  I should have added sun dried tomatoes like others suggested but I didn't have any on hand.  The substitutions I made were half a bag of fresh spinach, used half the amount of butter (always use equal parts butter and flour), and used fat free half and half for the milk (needed to use it up).  We liked it with the soy sauce just fine. I had no problems with it thickening up.  If it's too thin just give it time and it will thicken eventually.  I always cook the flour and butter mixture a few minutes before adding the milk to cook the flour taste out of it.  Will make again.

Made this for dinner tonight. I thought it was pretty good,not great. Theres something about the soy sauce in the casserole that was a lil odd. I think i would have preferred it to have more of an alfredo type of taste. My sis liked it and asked for the recipe.Next time i think i will add chicken slices in it and work with the sauce a lil. 
*TIP* After sauteing the mushrooms, let it sit in a strainer for a few mins..it releases alot of liquid.Also dont forget to squeeze the water out of you spinach.

This was really good. The only things I changed were butter instead of margarine because I didn't have it and a teaspoon of jarred minced garlic because I always have it on hand.

i needed to do something with my mushrooms, spinach, lasagna noodles and this was perfect! I added in more stuff that was in my fridge: I added an egg to the flour-margarine mixture; I added mild cheddar and parmesan cheese to the sauce.

Yummy! I can take or leave mushrooms and spinach but spinach is so good for you I've been looking for recipes that use it. This tastes just like a cheesy spinach dip with pasta mixed in. It wasn't heavy on the mushroom taste either. Just a trace. I did squeeze excess water from the spinach before adding and it wasn't runny at all. If you like spinach dip, you'll probably like this.

It was a HIT in our home! Everyone loved it. I did it twice and in the 2nd time I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp thyme, and i added about 1/4c extra milk bcoz my suace turned out really thick. I used mozzarella and emmental cheese (it gave a sharp taste to the sauce), yummmm yummm!! If i'll cook this again, I'll add chicken to it!!

Overall, this was pretty bland. It's basically a fresher version of pouring cream of mushroom soup over noodles. I even tried sprucing it up with fresh spinach, buttermilk, and more garlic. I won't be making it again.

This definitely has potential. I used a low sodium soy sauce to cut back on the saltiness. My husband and I found this dish to be lacking something..I think it was because mozzarella isn't a very strong flavored cheese. Next time I may add in smoked gouda or something with a sharp flavor.

This was really good, especially the next day.  I made it on Saturday night, we had some for supper and brought the other half to church potluck.  I had several people ask me for the recipe.  I did cut down on the soy sauce, used more pasta, and drained my thawed spinach.  It was delicious!

Very good.  However, true confession, I'm not a huge spinach lover, so I would add half the amount the recipe calls for.  Also, needs more garlic.

I've made this dish several times, and every time I get rave reviews! It's my go-to dish for potlucks, so I usually double everything in the recipe except for the milk and the spinach. I've found that doubling the milk makes the sauce too runny. Doubling the spinach is just a matter of personal preference - I like spinach but I think even with the recipe doubled, the 10 oz package works out just fine! Sometimes I throw in an extra garlic clove or two as well. So good! My vegetarian and pasta-loving friends rave about it!

Good, but it needs less soy sauce, less butter, and something else to add another element of flavor.  Will try adding tomatoes, onions, more garlic, or red pepper flakes next time.

This is the worse recipe I've made from this site. What a waste of portabello mushrooms and a package of organic farfalle pasta. The sauce was super gooey, like paste, and extremely difficult to spread/mix with the pasta in the baking dish. I think it's best to just add the cheese during the final step of transfering to the baking dish. However even if the sauce was the right consistency, the result was still VERY bland. Can't taste anything but mushrooms. And I love mushrooms but the orange I had while waiting for this to bake tasted 20 times better than this casserole. Another reviewer (Kristal) hit it on the head when she said this tasted like you just poured a can of condensed cream of mushroom soup over pasta.

This was the BOMB!  My 7 year old ate this and also loved it.  I used less Soy Sauce though.  It just seemed too much and I'm not a big fan of it, but that's just my preference.  Great recipe!

This was so good and SO easy! I had to make a few alterations based on what I had on hand (don't we all?) and completely omitted the spinach (though next time I make it, I'll be sure to throw it in!). I also didn't have a lot of milk (only about half a cup left...ah, the life of a college student on a meager budget...) so I added a can of cream of chicken and mushroom soup that I had. I used an Italian cheese blend of parm, fontina, asiago, etc and doubled the garilc. Turned out fantastic! I'm definitely making this again!

My family loved this!  I reduced the margarine by half (and used butter) and the sauce still came out beautifully.  I might try a different mix of cheeses next time.  I reduced the soy sauce too, since I was a little uncertain about that addition.  My family thought it was great as it came out, though if I do the same next time I will add a dash of salt.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great! It was a little thin compared to the picture but I certainly didn't mind. I will definitely make again. The only thing I would change is to cut back on the soy sauce as it turned out a bit too salty but was still delicious.

Easy and delicious. Why use margarine when you can use butter? But cut it down to 1/4 cup; no more is needed. I doubled the garlic for extra flavor. An excellent one-dish dinner.

Fantastic! I used fresh spinach instead of frozen.  The sauce was thick and perfect, and was a hit with my fiancee. I think I might try this again with a light breadcrumb crust and broil it for a minute, just to make it feel like more of a casserole and not just a super charged mac and cheese.

YUMMY!  This was great!  As other posters suggested, I mixed most of the cheese into the sauce, I used mozz, parmesan, romano and I added a tiny bit of red pepper for a little kick!  I also cooked the mushrooms until they were tender, about 5 min. and I used broccoli instead of spinach, just because I'm not a fan of spinach. My husband loved it!

I made the recipe in half and it had way too much cheese. Will make it again for sure, but add less cheese to make the sauce a little more saucy. Might add a few red pepper flakes too.

Tastes good,easy to make, but---it is as compact as a brick wall.  If I make it again, I'll cut way down on the butter and make the sauce much lighter w/some canned tomatoes.

Added cooked onion, did not add the soy sauce.  I loved this dish, and I thought it tasted like restaurant food.  The portobello mushrooms added a nice texture and taste to fancy up what is essentially mac & cheese.  Best of all everyone in my very picky family ate it and asked for seconds.  I had no leftovers!

This is such a tasty dish and everyone in my family (all extremely picky eaters) loved it.  My husband's taste buds are esp. hard to please and he kept saying how good it was.  The soy sauce, which I was afraid to add, tastes great in it. I made only one change and that was to add extra cheese and mixed cheeses. My shredded cheese was from a bag of the blended cheeses.  I think it includes mozarella, cheddar, colby, and I added parmesan.I blended 2 cups into the sauce and sprinkled one cup on top. It was fabulous.  I'll make it again for sure.

AWESOME!  Have been thinking of going Vegetarian so was doing a bit of recipe research and decided to try this one on my "meat & potatoes" guys.  They LOVED it!  Little guy didn't even mind that there were mushroom.  Husband said "That's a keeper!"  And he actually hates spinach... this one is going into the regular rotation!  I followed the recipe to the letter and made no alterations.

DELICIOUS AS IS!!!  You won't be disappointed that's for sure!  The portobello mushrooms have a very distinct flavor making it a gormet tasting dish.  Try it, you'll love it.  I'm going to add some grilled chicken cut into bite size pieces next time for a complete one dish meal.  Thanks for a great recipe!

As written this recipe is very good. Definitely do not leave out the soy sauce. I think next time, in addition to mozarella, I will add different cheeses to give it a more complex flavor.

This is a great dish, but I did make a few minor changes. I sauteed my garlic with the olive oil used for the mushrooms until golden in color. I added 1 chopped medium yellow pepper and sauteed that for a couple minutes prior to adding the mushrooms to the pan for 1 minute. I cut the butter down to 1/4 cup and allowed the flour to simmer before adding the milk. I also let excess water run off my spinach, but I did not squeeze or drain to remove all moisture. My sauce was quite thick and the remaining water in the spinach brought it to a perfect consistency. With the changes this was a huge success. It wasn't watery at all and it tasted fantastic.

I added some chopped asparagus and didn't add so much butter. Also I substituted cottage cheese for the mozz and in the final baking minutes sprinkled parmasan on top. Both my boyfriend and I really enjoyed it. I only thought it needed a little salt and pepper, but my boyfriend thought it was perfect as is. Thanks for this recipe.

I LOVED THIS RECIPE!  I WAS KIND OF SCARED OF THE SOY SAUCE IN PASTA BUT, IT WAS GREAT!  I EVEN WENT THE HEALTHY ROUTE BY USING WHEAT PENNE PASTA AND 1% MILK.  HOWEVER, I WOULD ADVISE TO HAVE THE INGREDIENTS READY TO GO ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ARE MAKING THE CHEESE SAUCE B/C IT ACTUALLY COOKS VERY FAST:)

I was going to grill our portobellos and have them on rolls, but then I realized I forgot to buy the rolls. So, I was very pleased to find this recipe. We happened to have all the ingredients on hand but was a little short of the 1/4 cup of soy sauce. It turned out wonderful anyhow. A very earthy dish. Would definately make this one again.

I had a hard time getting the sauce to thicken, I had to add extra flour.  I also found it a bit bland, needs more spices.  I would probably make it again but add much more garlic and other spices

Sorry about the score, but my husband did not even want it to rate this high.  My husband, who usually loves spinach, felt that this had too much spinach.  Also, the dish lacked flavor.  I had to add extra seasoning after it was served.  I did enjoy the alfredo sauce and felt that it had a good consistency.  I will probably not make this dish again.

I made and served this casserole to for a pot luck and people raved about it. It was creamy and delicious! Because I have vegetarian friends, I used soy milk instead of milk, which made it extra rich and creamy.

I definitely liked this recipe but next time I make the dish I will reduce the amount of soy sauce.  It was good with the dish, but a bit overpowering in such a quantity.  This one made excellent leftovers too!!

I used more minced garlic (maybe 1 1/2-2 Tbsp) and some garlic salt - otherwise I made this recipe as stated. It was very good, the portobello mushrooms give it a nice, almost smokey flavor. My meat eating husband had seconds. I will definitely make this again.

This was so good and easy! I did make a few small changes: I halved the recipe to fit in a 8x8 casserole dish. Sautéed the mushrooms with fresh spinach instead of frozen. Used half and half instead of milk. Used double the garlic, added parmesan cheese to the sauce as other users suggested. I let the garlic simmer in the butter for a few minutes before adding the flour to bring out the flavor. Let the flour cook for about 3 minutes before adding everything else. I ended up with a wonderfully cheesy, thick sauce that coated the pasta perfectly. Will make again and again!

Easy and very good.  If you want it to be hot while eating it I highly suggest you add at least 10 additional minutes to oven time.  Even more time if you add more penna noodles.

This is an awesome recipe! I made it along side Italian sausage. The only changes I made were to use salt instead of soy sauce, and parsley instead of basil. Make sure you dry the spinach well so it doesn't get soggy.

The only thing I did different is eliminate the last part where it dirties another dish and becomes a casserole. Instead, I just used a large skillet in place of sauce pan and added and heated everything through in a skillet at the end. I didn't care about missing out on baking the cheese on top.
This is a GREAT recipe THANKS
PS I also used some heavy cream in place of some of the milk .

This was very good! Sauce was not thin at all as some mentioned.  I used same ingredients except used butter and made a few changes. I used fresh chopped spinach.  When sauteeing the mushrooms, I added the garlic and the fresh spinach and cooked on medium heat for about 5 minutes til all soft and removed from pan. I then made the sauce with the butter, flour and milk and stirred occassionally over medium heat until thick and added cheese and all other ingredients per the recipe. I baked in a 9x9 pan and this was perfect. It seemed a 9x13 pan would have been too large. You must use the soy sauce otherwise it would be very bland.  We loved it and will make again. Thank you for sharing!

This recipe needs to be "cleaned up". Between the 1/2 cp margarine, the 2 cps Mozzarella, and the soy soy sauce, it is a sodium and fat catastrophe. Made with more olive oil (no margarine),  half the cheese, and no soy sauce, it was tasty with less guilt.

Wow, the soy sauce was surprising, but delicious! I didn't change a single seasoning, and went back for seconds! I usually find myself adding some more garlic or salt, but this recipe was perfect as is. I did make it with whole wheat pasta, which made me feel less guilt. It was still delicious!

I made this according to the recipe and liked it , but next time I will try adding some Chicken . I think by adding a meat like Chicken , it will make it taste even better and make it more of a meal rather than a side dish .

My daughter is vegetarian and she loved it, actually requested me to make it every day for her.  Substituted kale and green beens for the spinach, tasted great, I think any veggie will do.

Notes: Sauteed the mushrooms with some marsala and white wine and garlic.  Used a can of white sauce and milk for the sauce base.  Added shredded parmesan to the cheese mix.  And used whole wheat penne pasta.  In oven now.  Review and rating update to come.
Update: YUM!

Not so appealing to look at but sure did taste good. Easy to put together for Meatless Monday so keeping on my repeat list.  Didn't change anything, made exactly as directed.

Phenomenal. I used margarine and it turned out delicious (almost substituted butter but I had more margarine and needed to use it).  I used one bag of fresh spinach, boiled in 1" boiling water with lid on for one minute.  Mixed it all together, divided between two 8x8 glass pans (one for now, one for later..) and baked at 350 for 15 min, sprinkled a minute of breadcrumbs and Parmesan cheese on top and baked for another 5-10 min. Delicious!!  The baby asked for seconds!!

I loved loved this recipe.  I omitted the soy sauce but not by choice, i just forgot to add it.  I also used fresh spinach and substituted the flour with corn starch.  This is a dish I will definitely do again and again!

I remember making something extremely similar to it, but forgot. So this reminded me of it and it isn't that fatty. (you don't need to use all that oil and butter the recipe calls for) the taste was great but you can replace the flour and butter and just let the cheese and milk cook a little longer. It reduced the fat by a lot. Also, you can pick any green you want and have the same great taste. (Kale, arugula etc.)

We really enjoyed this dish. I made a couple of changes to make the dish a little healthier. I cut the butter in half, used 1 3/4 cup of milk, used 1 tsp. of coconut oil to sauté the veggies, and did not use the soy sauce (due to the high sodium content). I doubled the garlic, added an onion, and I used a bag of penne pasta (16 oz.). I sauté the mushrooms and onion for 5-6 min. and then added the spinach. I cooked the flour and butter a couple of minutes before adding the milk to remove the flour taste. I added salt, pepper, Italian seasonings, and red pepper flakes to the sauce. I also used only 1 1/2 of cheese. Overall, a great dish!

Oh my gosh!  This was an absolutely amazing recipe.  I prepared it on a Sunday and warmed it up on a Tuesday (easy for a full-time, working mom).  It was just so good.  I followed the recipe, but I used canned spinach (drained).  It was excellent!

This was DELICIOUS!  The only reason for the 4 stars is because I think it was just a little too salty.  I listened to one of the other reviewers and used a mix of cheddar and mozzarella (and this may have added to the saltiness).  Maybe next time I'll use low sodium soy sauce, or re-think my cheese selection.

I loved it! Probably one of the best pasta's I've made. I followed the recipe with few small changes that I believe added that extra flavor. When mixing the margarine and flour in the pan - add a splash of "Masala" wine - it truly enhances the aroma and taste. Also, I used water instead of milk, and did not include spinach since I didn't have any. I will definitely make this again!

We all loved this dish. I doubled the recipe and it was perfect in a 9x13 pan.  I added chicken from a rotisserie chicken I bought, I drained the spinach and squeezed as much liquid out as I could, I added extra garlic, and I accidently forgot to double the amount of milk but it turned out wonderful. Very good!

I thought this was a nice change from your regular cream sauce on pasta.  If you skip the soy sauce you are totally missing out on the point of this recipe!  It reminded me very much of a pasta dish I had at a restaurant in the Outer Banks.  I sauteed my mushrooms and fresh spinach together ahead of time and mixed in with the pasta before I dumped the sauce on.  Yum!

So good! I used corkscrew pasta because that is what I had and it made it a little difficult to mix in the sauce but still came out great. I also used fresh spinach and cooked it down in the pan before I cooked the mushrooms. I made half of the recipe because I cook for just two right now but my husband said he wishes I had made the whole thing so he can eat it again tomorrow. Delish!

Followed directions exactly.  Husband really liked it.  I thought it was okay.  It seemed like it was missing something.  The amount of soy sauce seemed to overpower the dish.  I will try again, but reduce the soy sauce and add red pepper flakes.

My boyfriend is a mushroom fanatic so I try and find recipes that contain fresh mushrooms. We both enjoyed this dish, him more than me but I think next time I will use marinara sauce instead of the soy sauce.

This was delicious. I used some water and worchestershire sauce in place of the soy sauce because we were out and it was delicious. Also added extra spinach. I think it would be good with some chopped tomatoes added in as it is quite rich, but definitely a good recipe!

I really, really liked this recipe - it was a good hearty casserole.  I've made it twice in the last two weeks :) Based on what others suggested, as well as my experience making it the first time, I did make some changes - like others I added 3 more cloves of garlic & nearly doubled the mushrooms in the recipe.  I also made some changes to make it a little healthier: I used almond milk, which worked great & I cut the cheese nearly in half & it was still great! I'll make it again for sure!

Wife loved it. I liked it very much.  Little bit on the rich/salty side for me - I think it was a bit too much margarine.  Next time I make this I'll cut the margarine in half and add a few tbsp of oil to make up the rest, or try substituting the margarine for unsalted butter.  Might also cut out half of the soy sauce (I'll taste as I go to make sure the sauce isn't bland with the reduced soy sauce).

Great recipe overall. I substituted fresh basil and fresh spinach instead of dried/frozen.  I was also light on the mushrooms - only 1/3 lb.

Will see if I can improve it for my tastes next time. Great starting point.

This was really, really good! The only changes I made were to mix Portobella mushrooms and regular because it's what I had on hand. Also did a 1:1 ratio of flour and butter because that's what I have always done with cream sauces (so 2 tblsp butter, 2 tblsp flour). I also added about 1/2 cup additional milk (to my halved version of the recipe) to make more of a sauce. I made more pasta, because half a box didn't seem to make sense for an 8 serving recipe, 4 oz of pasta certainly wouldn't serve 4 people. 
I will definitely make this as written again, but I also can't wait to try out other cheeses (feta and smoked provolone come to mind) as well as different pastas. If you are even thinking about making this - DO IT! You won't be sorry.

Pretty good.  I used fresh spinach like others and just stirred into hot hot sauce.  I felt the sauce was a little on the bland side, so prior to baking I added a little garlic salt, pepper and some Parmesan.  I had some as leftovers and felt it was even better the second time.  Really like this and will probably make again.

Like some of the other reviewers I cut the butter in half for the sauce and that worked perfectly.  I used half the amount of soy sauce in the recipe and still felt that the flavor was too strong.  The next time I make it I may decrease the soy sauce to 1/2 - 1 tablespoon.  I think this recipe may be in regular rotation in my house!

My husband and I loved this. I used a carton of baby portobello and threw in a couple of button mushrooms because we had them. Then I used 4 ounces of fresh spinach. With 3 pats of butter I sweated this mixture for 20 minutes, added fresh garlic (3 big pods) added pepper and some soy sauce,  sweated again. Once done, I reduced the liquid left in the pan, added 1/2 cup of milk, 1/2 stick of butter and flour adding 1 cup of cheese and a little more soy. put it together and baked.

Awesome!  I used rice milk, but otherwise followed the recipe.  This is a VERY cheesy dish!  All of the flavors went great together.  It's very easy to make.

Use less soy sauce and fresh spinach.  Frozen spinach is just to bitter, and the soy sauce was a little overpowering.

This is fantastic! I tried it for my family first and my husband said 'it's a keeper'!  (rare) I then baked it for our holiday book club and they loved it. It is very rich so I served it with a green salad and chocolate covered almonds. A heavy dessert would be too much. I did substitute butter for the margarine and Braggs liquid Aminos for the soy sauce. Next time I will add chicken and I expect it will work out great.

Delicious! I used only 2 tbs margarine and 1 tbs flour flour. I also used fresh spinach that I cooked down myself. The soy sauce adds another dimension of flavour. I wouldn't leave it out.

Okay I made a few changes based on what I had but this was wonderful.  I had pasta last night so I made this with saffron rice.  Also I sauted a vadalia onion with the mushrooms.  I used fresh spinach and cooked it with a couple of tablespoons of lemon juice and used one cup milk and a half of cup of heavy cream.  This was DEVINE.

Made this with Tex-Mex shredded cheese instead of all mozzarella to give it more flavour. Cut the portobellos into small chunks instead of thin slices. The casserrole was delicious, but somewhat too rich. Next time I will halve the amount of fat in the roux. Don't forget to let your roux cook for about 2 minutes so there is no floury taste in the sauce. Thanks!

Very good meal.  I would definetly use fresh spinach and red pepper flakes (a few tsps) are a must.  I thought that using butter and a little heavy cream would make this a little richer and I was right, too rich!  I won't use them next time.  The soy sauce is a must but I would recomend cutting it back a little.  Also a good idea to double or triple the garlic.  I used a bagged 6 italian cheese mix that really helped the flavor and I used 3 cups of cheese rather than 2 because more cheese is always better.  Good stuff!

This was super-tasty! My hubby doesn't like spinach, but did enjoy this. We tried using havarti slices for melting on top and it was good as well. The spinach was a bit strong though, so I gave it a 4 rather than a 5.

This recipe was amazing after a few alterations.  I cut the butter in half. I sauteed the garlic in the butter prior to adding the flour and basil.  Only used 1 1/2 cups milk and used pizza cheese rather than mozzarella for a different flavor.  I then cut the soy sauce in half and topped the dish with an aged shredded provolone.  Delicious!

Decreased servings and still came out fantastic!  I was only cooking this for 3 and didn't see the need for such a large amount, so I halved the recipe and baked in an 8 x 8 inch pan at 350, keeping all other elements of the directions the same.  Loved this!  Might make the larger version next time to see how well the leftovers freeze?

This was great!  Very easy, quick to make and very, very tasty.  The only thing I did differently was use fresh spinach.  And don't leave out the soy sauce!  The dish would be relatively bland without it.

I was looking for a recipe to use some of the basil which I had grown, although; this recipe called for dried basil, I used fresh and lots of it since I like basil. I thought it turned out fantastic.  Since I was cooking with wine and the recipe didn't call for any.  I stirred all of the cheese in and forgot to reserve 1/2 to put on top and it was fine.  I also added some rotisserie chicken to make it a one dish meal. Served it with a salad, some crusty buttered bread, and the rest of the wine. Mmmm, Thanks for a great recipe.

Good recipe, and the soy sauce gives it great flavor, but low-salt soy sauce would be much better. It was way too salty with the normal soy sauce in it.

This was pretty good -- next time I'll go slightly lighter on the soy sauce, but it does make an interesting flavor!  Might be interesting with artichokes as well.

The more I think about this recipe, the more I dislike it. I'm not sure what I missed, everyone else on the site seemed to love this, but I just couldn't get into it. I would change a lot if I were to make this again, so much so that it wouldn't even be close to the original recipe. But I did eat it.

Very flavorful.  I made some substitutions as I ran out or did not have some ingredients.  1/2 skim milk and 1/2 chicken broth, low fat mozarella and unfortunatley for my low cholesteral diet, regular butter in place of margerine.  Oh and 1 heaping tablespoon of minced garlic instead of 1 clove.  I also forgot to add the soy sauce until we had already eaten some of it.  I went back and added it after and it made a big difference.  Excellent for a meatless dish.  Will also try with chicken.

While we at first thought the soy sauce was an odd addition when we read the recipe, we thought this was absolutely delicious and so did our one year old!!  We only made two minor changes, both of which we'll do again: doubled the garlic and added crushed red pepper flakes, to taste.  I also like to use baby bells, instead of cutting up large portobellos.  Excellent reheated the next day also (which I do not say often).

This was really good, and easy to make.  I also mixed in 1/4 C chopped sundried tomatoes, topped with an additional 1/2 C parmesan, and broiled for 5 minutes at the end to crisp up the cheese.  The BF loved it, even though he was reluctant to eat a meal without meat.  We will be making this again!  Thanks!

DELICIOUS!  I made this for a dinner party and it was a HUGE hit.  I browned some strips of boneless skinless chicken thighs and added them with the mushrooms, and they went very well with this dish!

Not bad.  Did not really care for the soy flavor.  Next time will use balsamic vinegar instead, add roasted red peppers, a little pepper jack,  and maybe some Italian sausage.  I think the sauce needs to simmer longer in order to meld the flavors.  I'd have a bite with a strong soy taste, then one with flour, then one with cheese.

I didn’t really care for this. I followed the instructions exactly except I added extra milk to the sauce because it was extremely gooey and looked more like dough than pasta sauce. I think the soy sauce is what really threw me off, it overpowered most of the other flavors. If I ever make this again I’m going to use more mushrooms, add some diced onions and only use a dash of soy sauce or no soy sauce at all.

Wow!  This is delicious.  I just made it for the second time and made a couple of changes.  I'm allergic to soy so I leave out the soy sauce and used a little veggie broth.  I also used some asiago cheese along with the mozzarella.  The first time I made it I felt it needed more moisture so the added veggie broth made a nice addition.  My husband and I couldn't get enough of this one.  I had leftovers for breakfast....I couldn't wait for dinner!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I followed the recipe but feel that it was lacking something? Onions or shallots might have helped. It also had a strange gluey texture, not creamy. It was decent but not was I hoping for.

OMG!!! This was a great dish. It was very quick and easy to make. My husband and I loved it. It will definitely be a staple. We paired this with a greek salad, crusty bread and white wine.

This is very Earthy. I liked it, but I wasn't in love. However, my boyfriend really liked it, so I will probably make it again. I may add some sort of tomato or something next time.

My husband, my 16 yr old daughter and I loved this recipe.  One of the best I've had. We used fresh spinach and next time will use whole wheat pasta.

This pasta is a great option for those vegetarian dinner guests.  I served it as a side dish with sliced beef and glazed baby carrots.  I used low-sodium soy sauce for fear of it being too salty; however I would recommend using regular soy sauce or adding some garlic salt for some kick.

I was excited to try this recipe because it sounded interesting and got so many good reviews, but while it might have been edible, it was not enjoyable. 

The amount of margarine (I substituted butter) that it called for was unbelievable, but I stuck to half a cup as directed in the recipe, which made the pasta incredibly GREASY (you're already using two cups of cheese for this, you do not need a whole stick of butter as well). 

The soy sauce also gave it a very odd taste that was completely out of place and  did not compliment the other flavors. Sadly, this dish turned out to be a waste of my time and ingredients.

We thought this recipe was excellent.  The only change I made was I used half of the amount of spinach.  I was afraid the spinach taste would be too strong.  It was excellent.

this recipe is great. i made a few modifications. i omitted the milk sauce and instead just sauteed some garlic, the mushrooms, added fresh spinach and soy sauce, and tossed it with cheese in the baking dish. i baked for 15 minutes and put it in the broiler for 2. it was a hit with the family.

This was exceptionally good, and believe me I am a picky, picky eater! The sauce was wonderful. I've never liked spinach but in this recipe it barely noticable. Also, it makes for an attractive dish that I would be proud to serve to company.

I thought it was edible, but I LOVE soy sauce. I didn't keep the leftovers. Everything would have been great if I'd left the soy sauce out. It was the only thing you could taste.

I had to tweak this recipe a little. We had no spinach and one of my roommates is allergic to milk. I put in green bell pepper, onions, and broccoli instead of the spinach. I also used soy milk and fake cheese for substitutes. Despite all this it came out very good. My roommates are both picky and they loved it. Personally I loved the soy sauce in it. About the only down side to this recipe is that so much "cheese" makes it very rich, also there is the danger of stuffing one's self to the point that they can't move. :P

This recipe was easy and delicious, my husband absolutely loved it.  My husband is a MEAT lover...so I sauteed two cubed chicken breasts, and then added the fresh mushrooms to them when they were almost through cooking.  I then mixed the sauteed chicken and mushrooms into the pasta as the recipe says to.  The soy sauce just added slight salty flavor, wasn't a problem at all.  With some garlic bread on the side...a 5 star recipe!

I made this last night for dinner and thought it tasted really great!  I didn't used the 1/2 cup of margarine.  It didn't need it at all to make the white sauce.  I also added 3 garlic cloves instead of one.  I think next time I make it - I may add some pine nuts and mix in a little asiago cheese.

I really enjoy this dish and I have made it several times. The soy sauce is where its unique and wonderful flavor comes from, so try it at least once. I have tried different amounts of soy sauce and have discovered that my preference is to use 1/8 cup or just a touch more.

As is this recipe is pretty good, I use less milk and add more veggies (tomoatos, artichokes, onion), less soy and butter, more garlic and some crushed red pepper. LOVELY! Very filling :)

This is delicious!! I am a Realtor In Miami Florida and I prepare this for my Broker open houses and it is always a HUGE hit. The other Realtors always ask me who my caterer is and I tell them I made it and I think they think I'm lying. Don't change a thing...trust this recipe and it will be a hit.

I made it exactly to the directions and it was excellent!  The only thing I might do would be to add a little hot pepper because we like things spicy.
Definately will make again.

This was fantastic!  I didn't have any problems with the texture nor did I have problems thickening it.  When I added the flour to the butter and garlic, I used a whisk to cook it a little before adding the milk.  Maybe that helped.  I followed the directions exactly with the exceptions that I added 3 cloves of garlic instead of 1, and I added a little more than 1/2 tsp of basil instead of just 1/2.  It's rich, but not too rich, the mushrooms give it a wonderful flavor, and the soy sauce (of which I used all 1/4 c) really brings a nice touch to the dish.  Maybe we are just piggy, but this only made 6 servings for us.  I will definitely be making this again.

This is pretty good, but I agree with the comments on the soy sauce. When I make this again I will probably only use a splash, if any. Also, my grocery store was out of a lot of things (I could only get 6oz of mushrooms and I had to get frozen leaf spinach instead of chopped) but it still turned out pretty well.

This is definitely a keeper - I'm not a huge mushroom fan and I loved it - although I used regular mushrooms instead of the portobello.  I also cut the spinach and soy sauce in half.  It was a delicious.

My husband thought this was a 3, I thought more like a 4 or 5 so we'll give it a 4.  A very interesting rich flavor to it, I also was leery about the soy sauce but went for it anyway...it just gives it a darker more robust flavor to the meal so it's not just like an alfredo sauce.  Next time I think I will use regular mushrooms, the portobello shrooms were a little too much.  I will also use more than 8 oz of pasta.  Thanks for a tasty change!

This is a nice recipe but a little bland.  I added dried tomatoes, extra garlic and Parmesan cheese but it needed more seasoning for my taste.  I liked the portobello mushrooms in the dish.

My entire family loved it, even the mushroom haters. I added parmesan cheese in with mozzarella. That's the only change I made. I'm adding this to my saved recipes. Delicious!

So creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Not healthy, but it's comfort food as a main dish or a side dish to take to a group dinner.

This is a tasty dish.  It is easy to make and just right for a chilly winter evening.  Add a little freshly sliced tomato on the side and it's delicious.

This is one of my go to meals when I don't have any meat thawed. Great flavor, I just add a little salt and pepper while making the sauce. Great for vegetarians that will do dairy.

I made this from a 2016 AllRecipes magazine version that did NOT include soy sauce in the recipe, and it was clearly missing something.  I added some cream and other cheeses as suggested by another viewer and that helped.  I also added some cardamon because I was out of nutmeg and I thought it might enhance the spinach and cream mixture.  It did help, but I can see that a healthy dose of umami would have made a big difference.
I did shorten the cooking process and reduced one step.  I used 10oz of fresh baby spinach and added it to the skillet after the mushrooms had started to cook down a bit.  Once the spinach was wilted, I continued to cook another couple of minutes to allow the moisture from the spinach to steam away.  Worked great!
I'll make this again but add more garlic and the soy sauce or perhaps some seaweed, and mix up the cheeses on top.  Served it with roasted grape toms.  Yummy.

Awesome recipe, everyone loved it; only thing I added was a chicken breast seared and cut up into small pieces. Also used 2x amount of spinach it called for because I bought a larger bag. Was delicious and will make again soon!

Also for those who are saying it is too watery simply did not let the milk thicken long enough!

Gooey, melty, cheesy, and creamy. Everyone who ate it gave it a 5. It is a 4 for me because it needed some acid. With tomatoes or a little vinegar, it would have been a 5. I didn't use evaporated milk. I used 3/4 cup whole milk  and 3 tablespoons flour to compensate for not having evaporated milk. I also used 16 oz of spinach instead of 10 oz. I did not wring it out, as some reviews suggested doing. My casserole was the perfect thick consistency. It was not runny at all. I sautéed the mushrooms on low heat (2 on a gas stove) for more than a few minutes. They were perfectly semi firm and meaty the way I like them. I also did not use butter. I used oil for the flour mixture because I was out of butter. I didn't add anything as other reviews suggested, but I agree with other reviews that parmesan, red pepper flakes, or some roasted red peppers would all go very well with this dish.

No changes made. My husband and I are trying to eat a few more vegetarian dishes, we are not giving up meat, but want to add different foods to our diet a couple of days a week, besides the vegetables we grew up on. This was our first dish and loved it! The combinations were really good. Will definitely make it again, and add to our file.

This recipe is TOTALLY 5 stars!!!! Wow!!!! And the secret to bringing all the flavors together really is the last ingredient: soy sauce! I doubled my recipe, and instead of using  just milk, I used half milk and half heavy cream. I took it to my book club (we’d read a book on Italy during WWII), and all members present wanted this recipe! It was the best of all the Italian dishes brought!

Great recipe. I did make some changes though, after reading a few reviews. Used less butter, and only 1 3/4 Cup milk.. I cooked the mushrooms  completely, so no liquid left. Instead of spinach I used broccoli , and added 1/2 cup grated Parmesan to the mozzarella. I was also scepticall about the soy sauce, but it is a definite must, really adds flavour along with a bit of freshly ground pepper. Recipe is a keeper!

The recipe should call for 16 oz of pasta. I added ground sausage, 3 large cloves of garlic, onion, extra cheese & used butter rather than margarine. Even with the additions the taste of the flour was prominent. So, it was just ok. I definitely wouldn't consider this a casserole.

I used butter instead of margarine, and 2% milk. Used  8 oz of penne as called for but the entire mixture only filled up my 9 x 13 pan halfway or less so I cooked and added the rest of the 16 oz box. This is so delicious, would love to find a way to make it lower in calories.

Maybe tomorrow the flavour will mingle together a bit more. We liked it but did seem it was missing something. Next time I’ll sauté onions with the mushrooms but I still recommend.

This is absolutely spectacular.  I made this for a church dinner for those who do not eat meat.  I  will add shrimp or chicken next time for me.

This turned out really well. I added chicken to the recipe along with increasing the quantity of some ingredients as I made a larger dish.

Good morning.  Just finished making this, and it tastes really good.  The only thing I changed, added 1/2 onion in with the mushrooms and a little cream after the milk. Going into the oven uncovered I thought it would dry out, no way. It's a Beautiful thing.  Thank you. Now I wait for my critic's to eat.
Bubba, I am in Canada. Good recipes AR, thank you.

Wow! I was very surprised at the delicious flavor. Ok, I too changed a lot. I had to use what I had. I did 1.5c cream and .5c milk, I used closer to 12oz of mushrooms because I had a little less spinach and I just used .5c butter. I cooked the mushrooms in the butter, then removed them before adding everything else for the sauce. Next time I may do a little less soy sauce but that’s just my taste. My whole family loved this.

Fantastic!  IMy changes:  I used 12 oz of cooked pasta.  I substituted olive oil for the margarine and sauted fresh spinach leaves (instead of using a frozen box) along with the mushrooms.  I used about 3 tsp of crushed garlic, since my family loves garlic.  Finally, I used a blend of Mexican shredded cheeses instead of mozzarella, mixed all the cheese in at once, and put bread crumbs on top.  Dish was awesome!

This was very good! I not follow the steps precisely, as I cooked ingredients in different orders. I will be tweaking the recipe next time though. I will use parmesan cheese in the mix instead of mozzerella, and also tosding in some pulled roasted chicken.

I made this and it looks good and all but the taste was not good. The soy sauce was a lil much. I don’t think I did anything wrong but simply did not like the flavor at all.

Great dish. I used 3/4 of a stick of butter rather than vegetable oil and one and three-quarter cups milk instead of 2 cups. Didn’t use quite the full amount of mozzarella. It was delicious and my family loved it. I did wring out the frozen spinach before adding it to the casserole.

I wish I'd read the reviews 1st.  A little bland....  Next time less milk, more garlic, add red pepper flakes, maybe Italian sausage or use white cheddar or swiss for 1/2 of the cheese....  Good recipe but needs tweaking based on individual palettes.

This was great!  Forgot to put in spinach though (had fresh, so made strawberry spinach salads for a side).  I used slightly less milk & half and half for some of it.  Sauce was nice and thick.  Will prob use full 2 cups next time and still use some creamer mixed w/ the milk.  I also sprinkled some random cheddar and asiago cheese I had around on the top.  I went heavy on the garlic too.  Whole fam liked this!

My family likes pasta in general, but everyone (even my two kids under 10 years old) had seconds!  It was easy, and it was super delicious!  Great recipe, the only thing I changed was to add another clove of garlic.

I made this for my vegetarian daughter for dinner and used it as a side dish for the rest of us.  Everyone loved it.  I followed the directions the first time but I found it a bit too thick  so I ended up adding more milk.  I also added a teaspoon of salt as it was a little flat the second time around.  Easy and delicious.

This is really good but I think there's too much sauce for the pasta. Next time I'll cook 12 ounces. However the sauce would make a great chip dip so I'm saving the extra for that. You could make the sauce and skip the pasta and it's similar to spinach artichoke dip.

Made this as shown. The only minor change I made was to add more garlic, but that's pretty typical for us, we like garlic! Everyone loved it including my two small kids. Will definitely be a regular in our  dinner rotation.

I always think of a recipe more as a "guideline," and this one was just the ticket! I added frozen broccoli, sun-dried tomatoes which we think it really needed! Then, topped it off with parmesan cheese which browned nicely and gave the casserole a nice look and crunch!

It was amazing! My girlfriend said it was restaurant quality. Having read the reviews, I made some modifications right from the start, though. These are the only changes I made:
Sautéed the mushrooms (two large) for about a 1/2 hour.
Used fresh basil (about two tablespoons).
Used 1-cup of heavy whipping cream instead of two-cups of milk.
Used salted butter instead of margarine.
Used two large cloves of garlic.
Added one roughly chopped medium onion to the butter/garlic/basil and sautéd for about 20 minutes before adding the flour.
Used 1-Tablespoon of soy sauce, not 1/4 cup because that scared me.
Cooked it for  1/2 hour.
It was perfect just like that; but we think next time we might replace the minced garlic with a head of roasted garlic (pop out the cloves and stir them in just before putting it in the casserole dish); we also might try adding artichoke hearts for fun. :-P

I think this is 4 stars as written, but just a few changes takes it to 5 stars. I subbed olive oil for veg oil, replaced half the milk with heavy cream, and used 4 garlic cloves. The soy sauce seems to add a meaty taste, so don't leave it out. Even my picky 3 yr old granddaughter gobbled it up.

Quick & delicious!  I used 4 garlic cloves instead of 1 and followed the rest of the recipe exactly as it is - it took approximately 45min altogether (prepping, cooking and baking). My very young children loved this dish as much as Mom and Dad.

SO good! I didn't change a thing! Next time I want to add a little parmesan just because I love the flavor not because the recipe needs any tweaking at all. My MEAT EATING husband and my 12-year-old daughter devoured their plates. Husband went back for seconds and we have plenty left over for tomorrow nights dinner!

I will definitely make this again! My family enjoyed it too. I added a few red pepper flakes and some roasted chicken to the recipe for added texture for the man of the house lol. I would have liked a bit more sauce, so next time I’m going to add anvout another half cup of milk.

Great –! I doubled the spinach and the mushrooms because  they are two of my favorites, I also added sun-dried tomatoes.   I actually tripled the soy sauce, I didn’t find it flavorful enough and the soy sauce gives it such a great taste but what the recipe called for just wasn’t enough for my taste buds. ??

I made this the other night and I will DEFINITELY make it again.  I did vary the ingredients... extra garlic, added onion.  The soy sauce threw me but you CAN’T leave it out. The sauce was bland at first so I was worried.  The soy sauce added so much flavour, and didn’t tast like soy sauce.  So hard to explain but so delicious!!!  This will be a weekly meal in our household!!

This needs some work. I made this more about the veggies than the pasta. I amped up the mushrooms (baby bells) and greens. That part worked out well. I also added 1 c sour cream + the 1 c milk. Made it much creamier. Also: 4 cloves garlic, 1 t basil (next time more) and ample soy sauce. At someone's suggestion, red pepper flakes. Still, pretty bland. Might be better today...

I always make cheese sauces too dry, (too much pasta in ratio to sauce). That being said, it was delicious and even better as leftovers. I did increase the amount of mushrooms to 3/4 lb and I sauteed them until they gave up their juices most of the way.  I used fresh spinach which I steamed first, otherwise all as in the recipe.

really good! I did cut down on the soy sauce because I was nervous about that ingredient, but I probably didn't need to because I needed to add more salt then. Very good dinner that can be reheated for an easy week!

I made this as a vegetarian option for a holiday meal.  Everyone who ate it enjoyed it.  (I’m dairy-intolerant so didn’t try it - next time I’ll tweak the recipe and make it dairy-free.)    I followed the recipe other than using 3 T. fresh basil instead of less dried basil plus I added a pinch of red pepper flakes and about 6 chopped green onons.

I didn't like it. I made it exactly as listed. It was way too cheesy and salty, but bland. I should have used fresh spinach like others used instead of the frozen chopped spinach. I'm not a picky person so I am shocked that so many people loved this recipe. I can definitely see using the recipe as a foundation for creating a different tasty dish though.

Sooooo good!! I accidentally bought frozen chopped collard greens instead of spinach. I decided to proceed with the recipe anyway and it was DELICIOUS!  You could add chopped onions, chicken, and many other variants and this would be really great.

Made this recipe for some friends  who were running a big race the next day, and it was a hit. Everyone took seconds. I made a few slight modifications: Used a bit more garlic (2 cloves) and mushrooms than called for, and accidentally used gluten free pasta (which tasted generally fine, but was texturally different). I thought the dish had a mild, creamy flavor that allowed the mushrooms to shine.

This recipe was great as it's written. I really enjoyed it and have made it a few times now. The only criticism I may have is that this does dry out a bit after being put in the fridge, it's much better fresh. I'd pick this for a family meal over something like planned leftovers.

I followed the recipe exactly   It's not difficult but it does take some time.  I do have one tip.  When it instructs to remove the mushrooms from heat and set aside,  they mean to remove the mushrooms.  I just put the pasta in the baking dish and the mushrooms.  Once the sauce was cooked I put the pasta and mushroom back in as it states and then poured everything back in the baking dish.  I think a thinly sliced chicken breast  pieces would go nicely on top.   I will definitely be making this again.

Wow!  I can’ believe how many people love this dish!  I made it tonight and thought it was terrible. I followed the directions exactly, except I put in a few more mushrooms and used fresh spinach. It was too high in fat for me and totally bland. A bit runny and not enough flavour. I have been a vegetarian for 26 years and am always looking for new recipes. This was a waste of ingredients and I will not be making it again.

Couldn't eat it because of too much soy sauce. That's all I can taste. Also, 8 oz of pasta is way too little. Proportions seem altogether off on this, and now must start over with guests coming tonight.

This is really good! Only changes I made was to cook mushrooms a lot longer w onions and some garlic and thyme. Definitely add a lot more garlic. Also some red pepper flakes and additional s & p for extra kick. Delicious..

Delicious, easy recipe. You must add the soy sauce, it totally changes the flavor. I added chicken and used fresh spinach since it was for company. Used fresh white mushrooms because they were on sale. A keeper.

This was bland and starchy.  I tried to up the flavor profile, but little helped. Would not make it again.

This recipe was delicious.  I made a full pound of pasta and increased the other ingredients to 1 1/2 times the original recipe.  However, I only used one 10 oz. package of frozen chopped spinach.  It was plenty for that much pasta.  The dish was creamy and rich.  I can't understand how others who made the recipe got watery sauce!  I'm thinking they did't follow the instructions about mixing the flour and then slowly adding the milk.  I did cook the mushrooms until softened, removed from the pan, sauteed the garlic till softened then added the flour to make a roux before adding the milk.  I also added cayenne, a dash of nutmeg and white pepper to the sauce.  That combination makes a more complex white sauce.  Yummy!  Will make it again.

This was a delicious pasta casserole. But, I didn't like the frozen chopped spinach in it. The look of the stringy pieces throughout the dish wasn't appetizing, especially to the children. I would use fresh spinach next time or at least the frozen whole spinach leaves. Also, unless you use low fat dairy , this dish has a high fat content ! Last, I would recommand a smaller baking pan, because in the 9x13 pan the casserole was kind of thin, just about half the hight of the pan.

Delicious! I used 2% milk and heavy cream, and an Italian style 6 cheese blend, I also used fresh spinach. This was so quick and is wonderful. Not too watery, it was thick and cheesy.

I've made this recipe a couple times now and it does  not disappoint.  I substituted half of the milk for almond milk and used fresh spinach rather than frozen (thawed) spinach.  The soy sauce gives this such a distinct flavour.

I made this recipe as is except I used butter instead of margarine. It was delicious! 

I had no problems with a watery sauce. I actually let it sit for a few minutes while the pasta finished cooking and it thickened up really well. We will make this again in the future!

A few changes: added about 1/2lb Italian sausage, used fresh spinach, cooked the mushrooms, garlic and sausage together. I made the sauce exactly as listed and it was perfect. We loved it, but warning---it is very rich and filling.

I made this last night and followed the recipe exactly, except to add 2 large cloves of garlic instead of just 1.
The consistency turned out good and not at all runny as other reviewers mentioned.
I'm giving this recipe only 3 stars because unfortunately, there was very little flavor and therefore, I'll not be making it again.

I did use fresh spinach that I sauteed with the shrooms. I also used a cheese blend of mozzarella and provolone. Also always extra fresh garlic! Still was very bland and super gluey texture... tasted like raw flour.  Will not make this again.  Sorry....

This recipe was amazing.  I made per the recipe instructions.  I even used whole wheat pasta and it was fabulous!  Would be great as a side dish for steak.  Or add small chicken strips to the recipe itself, would also be a great option.

The only change I made was to use fresh spinach.  Made it twice already, once for me and my husband and again for a pot luck. There was one person who went back three times for more.  Will definitely be making it again. Loved it.

Reduced the margarine (I used butter) to 1 Tablespoon + 2 Tablespoons of olive oil.  It was very yummy but way less fat and more good-type fat.

It was lovely and cheesy  but next time I would use a whole box of pasta. I cooked the mushrooms down, and used the juice in the sauce for added flavor.

This is an amazing recipe! Followed exactly, except used fresh spinach, as that is what I had on hand. Sauted the spinach with the mushrooms, and added chicken breasts that I also had on hand. The sauce was not at all runny as in other reviews. Definitely will make again!

My husband and I enjoyed this dish. I added julienned strips of sun dried tomatoes and a little paprika to enhance the flavor and color. I will definitely make this dish again and possibly add strips of chicken breast meat to make this an all inclusive casserole dish which can be had for lunch or dinner. Thanks for the recipe.

Outstanding! I used 1lb mostacciolli noodles, 1lb Portobello mushrooms, 2 cloves garlic. Sprinkled fresh ground pepper onto the mushrooms as I cooked them.  When I added the shredded mozzarella to the flour mixture I also added some grated romano & parmesan cheeses. Mixed everything together with the noodles, placed in 9x13 pan.  Generously placed shredded mozzarella over the top and baked 1/2 hr. then browned under broiler.

Me, Cooking This Dish: A Reenactment 

“Soy sauce, huh? Really? That doesn’t sound right, but okay.”
*taste before putting in oven*
“See, I knew I was right. Soy sauce is weird in there. This isn’t going to be very good.”
*plate and serve, take first bite*
“Yeah. Soy sauce didn’t belong in here.”
*take second bite*
“Actually, though, it’s okay. It’s kind of an interesting flavor combination.”
*take third bite*
“Wait, no, really, WOW. This is so good. What was I thinking? The soy sauce MAKES this dish.”
*the rest of the meal is a blur of yummy noises and devouring*

I was really surprised at how delicious this was! I modified the recipe only by adding more garlic (because - garlic!!) and it turned out wonderfully. I think I'd use low sodium soy in the future but otherwise not change a thing! Quick, easy, delicious for everyone!

This was good, but certainly lacked the wow factor! I had to add some cream to the mixture as it was too thick before going in the oven. I was expecting  this recipe to have more flavor..for that reason I won't be making this again.

Will definitely make again. Very tasty. I did 1/2 the pasta and kept everything else the same as written. Made a wonderfully cheesy mushroomie casserole. Don't forget the soy sauce--adds a lot to the taste.

Great recipe. I pretty much stuck to the recipe, plus a few minor adjustments suggested by other reviewers. I used actual butter instead of margarine, since that's what I had on hand. I cut back the milk to 1 3/4 cup. I also used fresh spinach, (about eight ounces), which I wilted in the pan after I cooked the mushrooms, just to cut back on liquid. I used 2% milk and reduced fat mozzarella in an attempt to lighten it a little and it still tasted great. Next time I might try high fiber pasta as well. Delicious, hearty meal! 

Oh, and this said an 8 ounce pack of penne, but mine was 16. I used the whole thing and it was perfect.

Made this last night and it was so good...wow.  Didn't change a thing and why would you? My wife is taking it for lunch (loved it!) and says people are going to ask where we went for dinner last night. I don't give 5 stars but  this was close.

Very good. The soy sauce flavor  was a little strange. So I will use less soy sauce next time, and it would be better with fresh spinach.

I followed other reviewers advice and only used 1 and 2/3 cup of milk. I also used fresh spinach instead of frozen, adding it to the sauce mixture to cook at the end. Additionally, I added 3/4 lb of cubed chicken that I sautéed to n the same skillet before cooking the mushrooms. Cheesy goodness!!!

This is a Very good recipe with just a couple minor changes - a bit more garlic (I used 3 cloves) and fresh Spinach. It's hard to equate an equivalent amount of fresh spinach to 10 oz frozen spinach but my guess worked out well. The Soy Sauce ( I used low sodium variety) adds quite a bit while dulling the color and, consequently, the visual appeal, but is necessary for a great flavor. This recipe has a "timing" aspect  that requires the measured and chopped components to be done ahead of time.
I WILL be making this again.

Wow. So good. A few modifications, but nothing major. Extra garlic, extra mushrooms, less butter,  milk, and soy sauce; I also added parmesan AND mozarella. I believe soy sauce is mandatory. I tried it before and after I added it and wow...it elevated the dish and gave it 'umami'.  I'll be making this again.

I read the comments and decided to add the dried tomatoes; 1 cup of  heavy whipped cream and 4 cloves of garlic!  Where did I go wrong.  I made this for my 93 year old mother-in-law.  She said it was fair!  She rated it higher than I would....I got a ton of it left over and shared some with the dogs...and although they ate what I gave them, they didn't look too excited.

Generates quite a few pots and pans, but my family loves the dish so it is worth it. I add a cup of finely chopped onion in with the garlic for additional flavor and texture.

This is an excellent recipe. This is my first review. Definitely use the portobello mushrooms and soy sauce. I also used a combination of cheeses of mozzarella and asiago. I increased the garlic as well but halved the margarine to equal the flour ratio. This recipe has a restaurant quality taste.

Really good! Would go good with chicken (be full longer)

Followed receipt exactly and turned out great. The whole family like it and it reheated well.

I tried this for a change from our usual pasta with red sauce.  I used butter instead of margarine, 3 cloves of garlic and whole grain pssta.   All else according to recipe.  Delicious and hubby said this recipe is a keeper.

I liked that it had spinach and my kids ate it but I felt it tasted bland... maybe if I used a stronger tasting cheese as I used marble cheese (what was on hand).

The only change I made was to use more mushrooms than called for. The dish was really delicious- gooey and made good leftovers, which I heated with a vegetarian chili. Got more vegetables in one dish!

I followed advice from some of the other reviewers. I cut the amount of butter in half, used a mixture of mozzarella and pepper jack cheese and added red pepper flakes.  The soy sauce did not offer the "punch" noted in the description and I reverted to salt and pepper.  However, it was also a bit bland for my taste so I added cajun seasoning which really made a difference.  I also found that it tastes better the day after it has been cooked.  
With the additions/modifications, however, it is actually very good.  I would also suggest varying the kind of penne.  I used the vegetable , but intend to try it again with spelt penne.

Only had fresh spinach which I steamed.  I also followed advice to use 1/4 C. butter and 1 & 3/4C. milk and upped the garlic to 3 big cloves.   I would prefer fewer red pepper flakes but my husband loved the bite.   Just had a bite of the cold leftovers and, if you like cold pasta dishes, you'll like it that way too.

The recipe instructions weren't so good, but I ended up just dumping the remainder of the ingredients in at the end.  It did not require a 9x13 dish, I downsized to a 9x11.  

This was okay, but not  a show stopper.   I made it for my vegetarian daughter, as I'm always looking for good meals for her that we'll enjoy too.

I used fresh spinach and fresh broccoli chopped small. Added them to the cheese sauce and simmered it for five minutes. 
Really special and loved the dish.

Loved this recipe. Fast and easy to make.  My husband loved it and I will make this again.  I agree that the soy sauce really adds to the flavor and did add more garlic.   I used fresh spinach (didn't have frozen).  The second time I made it I added some left over chicken, and asparagus which I had in refrigerator.  Delicious!!

I accidently  melted the butter and put the mushrooms into the butter to cook rather than oil, so there was a little extra butter than the recipe called for.  However, my family raved and loved it as a meatless meal and then had the left overs the next night as a side dish.  Yummy!

Loved it and my whole family did too. I accidently added a lot of grated cheese besides the mozzarella which meant adding a little more milk and it was just delicious and will make it many times.

I did not have penne pasta , so I used ragatoni pasta which is a bit bigger . I had on hand frozen leaf spinach, chopped would of been better, and i used white mushrooms. Next time I will get all the ingredients it calls for. I think I will try using alfredo sauce too. It was good, a little dry though. I will make again.

I used butter and olive oil as I never have margarine and vegetable oil around the house and it came out delicious.
I would never think to add soy sauce to a milk and cheese dish but the soy sauce gave it just the right amount of salt to have this dish really stand out.  I will make it again.

It seemed a little bland.  The soy sauce didn't seem to make much difference.  Maybe a more flavorful addition such as broccoli or bacon would help....

An ok dish, but probably wouldn't make it again. The flavor certainly wasn't worth the number of calories it has.

Excellent recipe.  I used four cloves of garlic, fresh baby spinach, blanched, chopped and well-drained instead of frozen, fresh basil and added 3/4 of the cheese to the sauce, reserving just 1/4 for the top.  I also sprinkled a little grated Parmesan on top.  Thanks to other reviewers I used the stated amount of soy sauce (low sodium) and it is definitely the right amount - don't reduce it.  Tried it out on my husband first and he designated it a "keeper" and couldn't believe it was meatless.  Served it for a luncheon and everyone loved it.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I used a left-over white pasta sauce instead of the flour and milk. Also used shredded swiss instead of mozzarella. Very tasty regardless.

This casserole had many of my favorite ingredients, but I found it to be a tad bland.  Maybe I will spice it up next time!  I served it as a main dish with salad and bread, but could also be a side with a meat main course.  My family all liked it, even my meat-and-potatoes eating husband.  Thank you!

I made this just like the recipe but I couldn't imagine not having onions so I sauteed 1 chopped onion with the mushrooms.  While this was good and worth making again, it was still missing something for me.  The next time I make it I will add some precooked Jimmy Dean sausage in it. Might even be good with Swiss cheese in it instead  and a bit more garlic, but all in all, it was a pretty good meal.

I made this for the first time with some minor modifications and it came out great!  I used more pasta and more mushrooms.  Next time, I'll definitely follow the suggestion to add some sun-dried tomatoes and possibly some roasted red peppers.  The soy sauce definitely does lend some interesting taste without being overbearing - nice!  My vegetarian husband was pleased and I will make again.

I made mine with broccoli because my husband can't have spinach due to kidney stones. I also used almond milk since I am lactose intolerant. I increased the garlic a bit and that was all. Very good. Would be good made as shown but I have to improvise.

This was wonderful . I did make a few changes to the original recipe. I sautéd fresh spinach along with the mushrooms and garlic and added hot pepper flakes. Oh, I used 3/4 cup heavy cream and 3/4 cup milk in the sauce. We will definitely be making this again.

This is very good.  It's a keeper!  I think I'll double the roux next time to make it a bit moister.  Because I love portobellos I added all of the mushroom liquid.  After reading reviews, I used 12 ounces of penne, almost 2 boxes of spinach, 2 cups of half and half and tripled the garlic.  I am looking forward to making this again very soon!

Too rich, too much butter, cheese.  Was hoping the spinach would help.  My wife and I had a small portion and we threw the rest out.  Not horrible, just not something we would never make again or ever serve to guests.

I made few modifications based on other reviews.  I added more garlic and used 1cup heavy cream and 1cup milk.  I didn't find the sauce runny at all, but I also made sure that I cooked it slow for it to thicken.  Next time I think I may add cooked chicken.

Made it as written except added a little more garlic and cheese. Delicious! My husband and I thought the amount of soy sauce was going to be over the top, but he now thinks we should add a little more next time.

My husband licked his plate!  This was delicious.  I have two comments: 1 Be careful not to add your salt until you have added your soy sauce which is salty and 2 I would add more mushrooms.  I did the 8 oz. which is 3 large portobellos, I would do 5 next time.  The flavour was excellent.

This is fabulous!  I doubled the mushrooms and the spinach, and tripled the garlic and the dried basil.  I used whole wheat penne pasta instead of white (I prefer the flavor, and it holds up better if you freeze the leftovers).  I added the soy sauce, and there was no conflict in flavor.   I served this casserole as a side dish, but it will absolutely have no problem holding its' own as a main course along side a green salad and a veggie (I recommend roasted butternut squash as the veggie -- it was soooo good!!!).

Very good!  The soy sauce was odd but we liked it.  I followed the recipe but added Parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes for a kick!  I also drained my spinach.

This was excellent and I am sure, after the flavors meld, the leftovers will be even better! I tripled the garlic because I love garlic and because the cloves were a bit smaller than normal.  I also used a heaping teaspoon of basil. I love big and bold flavors! No, the basil didn't overpower the dish. The sauce came out perfect. If yours is too runny, add a bit more flour. Also, if you saute the mushrooms, you will produce a lot more liquid that will make it runny if you don't drain it off.  Just sweat them for a minute or two like the recipe says. You only want to stimulate the flavors, not cook them off.

This was pretty good.  8 oz of pasta to that much sauce is the right ratio otherwise it would be too dry.  I cooked the pasta (then drained and ran under under cold water).    Then I sauteed the mushrooms, onion and garlic (3 cloves) for a few mins in olive oil and butter.  I defrosted 1/2 box of frozen spinach and wrung out the water.  Then I made the sauce ... I seasoned it with salt, pepper and onion powder.  I was skeptical of the soy sauce (not only for saltiness but also color) so I only added half, turns out I probably could have used the entire amount and salted less (color was not unappealing with only half the amount).   To the sauce I added mozzerella, then mixed in the vegetables and the pasta, and put that in a small greased casserole dish.  Then I melted a little bit of butter in a small bowl and added some seasoned bread crumbs to it .  I sprinkled that mixture on top of the pasta with some 6 blend Italian cheeses and some pecorino romano and baked for 8-10 mins at 400 degrees just enough to melt the cheese and slightly brown the bread crumbs.  (Do not bake or it  will just dry up your sauce into the pasta).

I used a heaping tbsp of pesto instead of the dried basil as someone had suggested and a heaping tbsp if minced garlic because that's what we had. I also added about 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper. Used an entire pound box of penne, a 2 cup mixed Italian cheese blend because that's what we had and geez, it was wow!  I'm sure it would've been wow without the changes too.

I adore portobellos!  Great flavor, but instead of frozen chopped spinach, next time I will add either whole leaf frozen spinach or will wilt fresh spinach.  I will also add more portabellos.  I did add a bit of crushed red pepper and parmesan.  Excellent recipe, my husband loved it!

I made this with rice pasta, 12oz spinach, and 4 cloves of garlic. It's amazing. This is the second time I've made it and it's a hit at our house.

This recipe is awesome and you can substitute!  Use coconut oil, rice flower, goat cheese, gluten free pasta, and coconut milk [almond would work as well].  My family loved this!

It was going great, tasted very good until I added the soya sauce.  It changed the taste all together and it certainly didn't look very appetizing. If it isn't appealing to the eye, it's pretty hard to enjoy.

This is a yummy recipe!  Will definitely make again.  To keep it pretty, remove the  dark ribs of your mushroom caps before slicing.  I used a bit less butter to make my rue.  I used mozzarella and pecorino cheeses.  I added cubed, cooked chicken, and fresh baby spinach.  I also, used some reserved pasta water to loosen the mixture and to help wilt the spinach.  Really, really good!

I made this last night. Both my husband and I thought it was way too cheesy. He didn't mind the flavor, but I didn't like the soy sauce in it.  I think this would be better with Swiss cheese and a little more garlic.

This was great.    I should  have added more mushrooms (I love them) and I used fresh spinach that I steamed to soften.   I also added some cream as part of the milk addition.   My family loves pasta and this was very satisfying.    Good recipe!!

A very good casserole for "meatless Monday" served with a tossed salad.  My husband liked this and said "be sure to keep this recipe".  I gave this 4 stars only because the recipe called for 1/2 cup of butter which I think is a lot. When I reduce the butter the next time I fix this I hope it doesn't change the over all good taste. And I definitely like the addition of the soy sauce.

Delicious -- will definitely make again!!!! One of our new favorites.  The only changes I made were -- based on another reviewer -- I only used 1.5 cups of milk.  I used skim milk -- still creamy and delicious.  Added just a bit more pasta but otherwise all ingredients and measurements the same.  What a great fall meal!!!!

Love this! After reading other reviews, I used almost a whole container of fresh spinach, twice as much garlic, 3 cups of cheese, homemade pesto as well as basil , and added more mushrooms. I also saved pasta water for added moisture for leftover reheating the next day.  I will use less salt next time as the soy sauce adds quite a bit, even with low sodium choice. And I agree that the soy adds a delicious taste as well as a bit of a kick to this recipe. 
I will be making it over and over. For meat lovers, I would add a hearty grilled and cut up sausage or two. Great  to make the day before. So easy, soooo good.

Only changes were extra garlic, some onion and less butter. Very good, but takes a lot of different pans to assemble, as well as being time consuming.  Probably will not make again.

my husband made this and it came out delicious. the sauce was a bit thin but it was still good. next time we will try broccoli instead of spinach. definitely felt like it was missing something tho...we decided next time we will try adding chicken, that should pull it all together.

This recipe seemed so promising with my favorite  ingredients spinach and mushrooms but the taste was so terrible....  I would omit the soy sauce that may save any problems passing this off as good.

This is restaurant quality, the flavors blend together so well, no one ingredient stands out.  Very rich and satisfying.  I did cook the mushrooms about 3 minutes but made no other changes. Had no problems with the sauce being  thin. I followed the instructions, cooked it down a little then melted in the cheese, it was fine. Definitely will make again. Thanks!

I added some sautéed onions along with a portabello mushroom. Then when dished out it was pretty solid and tasted bland and gritty. Not appealing in the least.

This was almost unreasonably good - in part because of the amazing taste and in part because it was so easy. I didn't use quite as much cheese as called for but otherwise followed the recipe exactly (and yes, you should wring out the spinach!). Next time I will try decreasing the butter and adding sundried tomatoes or roasted red peppers just to see what happens (but not because this needs improvement). Some others have commented that you should saute the mushrooms for longer, but I found them to be perfectly cooked at just over a minute in the pan and 20 min in the oven (but then...I really like portabellos). Delicious!! Thanks!

Five stars, but not as written. I used butter, made a thick roux, and added a Tbsp of homemade Basil Pesto to it. I would add more mushrooms next time. I used fresh spinach, chopped and lightly sauted.  I did not add the soy, but then found it needed salt and pepper.  Good cheesy sauce makes this an excellent comfort food for a cold rainy night.

This was delicious. We had it for dinner yesterday, and leftovers for lunch today, and loved it both times. I used regular white mushrooms because I had no Portobellos. Otherwise I followed the recipe as written. This will be a regular non-meat meal in our house, especially on cold winter nights - comfort food at its best!

Loved it.  I was definitely in the mood for a meatless meal last night, and I had all of the ingredients for this, so it fit the bill.  I did use raw spinach, about 1/2 a bag (childhood memories of frozen are not so good) and used a tablespoon of fresh basil, the last from the garden this year.  Threw  some buttered bread crumbs on top just for looks and some crunch.  Meant to take a picture, but I forgot - the hubs was hungry! Easy and good!  I will definitely make this again, and it will become part of my regular meals.

I added fresh spinach in place of the frozen.
I followed the recipe and found it to be extremely bland--no taste whatsoever.  My husband and I ate it for one meal, but I washed 2/3 down the disposal.

I Prefer fresh spinach but have used frozen and it was still great. When I have Gruyere cheese, I like to half it with the mozzarella and a bit of fresh parmigiano reggiano.  Also find using about 1/4 C less milk keeps it creamier. I always double the garlic too. My family absolutely loves this dish, as do I.  It's definitely a keeper.

This was a great recipe and one we will do quite often with some minor additions. First, we used both portabello and shitake mushrooms, and fresh spinach instead of the frozen; and we doubled the garlic. We also added about 2/3 cup of ricotta cheese for an added creaminess to the dish, and sprinkled about 1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese over the top under the last cup of mozzarella before putting it in the oven. Absolutely exceptional!

This was really good!  I used fresh spinach instead of frozen because I just like it better.  We thought it was really good but since my guys consider themselves "meatatarians", I may try throwing in a little Italian sausage or steak strips next time just to add some meat to it for them.  But, it's delicious just as it is (especially for me because I'm obsessed with mushrooms!)

Great and easy! Made mine with 1 can evaporated milk topped off with whole milk to=2 cups. Used 8 oz. Italian 5 cheese blend which I added the whole bag to the rue. Cut soy sauce in half and only 1 large clove garlic. Also added some Vidalia onion.Topped it off with 8 oz.of mozzarella.Will mix it up next time with maybe some BACON!

This was the most amazingly delicious pasta I've ever had! The savory Portobello mushrooms were key. I added some chopped cooked chicken to make it a full entree. Definitely making it again soon.

Excellent! Really enjoyed this pasta dish, but changed a few things based on our preferences. I doubled the cheese and also added parmesan cheese. I used parsley instead of basil as we don't care for it. I could not bring myself to add the soy sauce. When I mentioned it as an ingredient to my husband, he did not want me to add it. I think next time I make this I will test it separately with a small amount of sauce rather than add it to the entire dish. That way I'll know for sure. I also tripled the garlic because we love garlic. Next time I will also add more mushrooms. Otherwise this dish was absolutely fantastic!

Delicious! I made recipe as stated and I thought it was delicious, so did my family.  If you wanted it more hearty I could see adding ground beef, sausage or even chicken. For a topping French fried onions too! I will be making again for sure.

So good! I made it with Sargento reduced fat mozerella and unsweetened almond milk . Since I'm single, I let it cool and sliced it into 8 servings wrapped individually and froze. I figure each serving is under 250 calories!

Like so many people on here I was skeptical of the soy sauce but I took their advice and kept it in the recipe. It's awesome. I was surprised how good this tastes, however remember that since you add soy sauce you really don't need to add salt. Otherwise this could become really salty easily. I only had a 12oz frozen spinach bag so I used that and it worked just fine. I did find the sauce a little runny for my tastes though, so I might add a bit of cornstarch to it next time. Also I added some red pepper flakes, a dash of oregano and a dash of italian seasoning because I thought they would taste good with this combination. All and all it's an awesome hearty vegetarian meal. I might cut back on the butter next time though to make it slightly healthier.

I followed recipe to a T..  With exception of only using half of the spinach (which I squeezed out excess water prior to adding to recipe) it turned out perfect.  I served it along with an assortment of appetizers for a cocktail party.. It was a hit. All 30 guest loved it.  1 was even a chef and food blogger!!   I tried this recipe for the first time and received so many compliments.  This was a last minute add on to my menu because I learned a few of my guest do not eat meat.  This was perfect to add variety.  I kept it warm all night with my casserole dish that sits over tea candles.  It was pretty and delicious.  Used small plates and it went well with my other dips and finger foods..

Excellent!  But I made alterations:  1 tsp salt; 1/2 tsp black pepper & 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper.  I cut the butter in half and only 1 tblsp flour; 1 1/2 cups milk.    No soy sauce - my husband doesn't like it, but I'll fry the mushrooms with wostershire next time.

Delicious and easy! I used tri colored fusilli as that's all I had, and added an onion and extra garlic and some black pepper. Also added half fresh grated parmesan as didn't have enough mozzarella. Definitely use the soy sauce as it adds another dimension of flavor and without it, its just another white sauce. I would add dried chili flakes next time for extra zip. It was not watery it was perfect. You need to always squeeze out the water from spinach if you are using it in any recipe---unless you are making soup!!

I made exactly as written (as you should if you are reviewing), except I doubled the recipe and used fresh spinach instead of frozen.   Recommended dish.

My bf who hates mushrooms LOVED this!  I used fresh spinach. Sauce was a little runny-made me wish I had some thick garlic bread- so next time I might drain the mushrooms or reduce the milk.

This was sooo decadent and delicious!  I made it for our meatless Monday meal, and it will definitely be going into regular rotation!  The only thing different I did was to squeeze all the excess moisture out of the spinach and saute it with the butter and garlic for a few minutes before adding the flour.  I also added a little grated Parmesan to the Mozzarella on top before putting it in the oven for a little extra flavor.  I used skim milk and this still turned out EXCELLENT!  Thanks so much!

Maybe this is a personal preference thing but I found the proportions of ingredients totally out of whack. I followed the recipe exactly and found there was not enough sauce overall and the soya sauce overpowered everything else.

Wow. This came out better than I expected. Start with great ingredients - portable mushrooms, spinach, good cheese, basil from the garden. I only made small modifications, and my husband called it "light" (ha ha!)  and "authentic italian"- I think using 2% low moisture mozarella meant it was not greasy, and low-fat milk with just a 1/4 cup of cream made it lighter. Basil flavor was really not there. Mostly we tasted the cheese, mushrooms, and spinach - and the soy brought out the flavors. Will definitely make this again.

This was very good and looked beautiful. However, despite the addition of the soy sauce, I thought it could have used more flavor.

Love this recipe! Added Italian sausage to my Hubby's bowl, since he's not vegetarian. He loved it as well. Next time, I might try chicken for him. The casserole on it's own is to die for!

Changed cheese to White cheddar, margarine to butter, pasta to whole wheat 1 full box, used oregano, and fresh baby spinach.  Used what was in the fridge and pantry. Italianed it up!!
Might add more garlic next time.

This was good but too heavy for us.  My young children did not like it and hubby prefers tomato based sauce. I was excited for a new dish for pasta night and enjoyed it but probably will not make again.

Really good.  I did make some modifications though.  I hate frozen spinach so I used fresh (and thus doubled the amount), added an extra clove of garlic, Italian seasoning instead of just basil, dash of red pepper flakes, and about 1/2 cup of sun dried tomatoes, and used a mix of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.

I followed this recipe exactly and it is fantastic.  It's delicious and filling, and looks like something I would order at a restaurant.  As a recent (and, I admit, wavering) convert to vegetarianism, I have to say this casserole made me forget about meat.  My boyfriend loved it, and it reheated well.  This will definitely make the rotation at our house!

This was really tasty.  We added sundried tomato thanks to another reviewer's tip and a little cognac to the sauce because we didn't have any cooking wine and I love the flavor w/ mushrooms.  We also used whole wheat noodles and used unsweetened soy milk because it is my preference.  Easy recipe that the whole family liked.  Next time I will reduce the cheese or use part skim or even soy or vegan cheese.  Seems like a solid recipe that can handle different adjustments.  Thanks !

Used 1/2 the amt of butter and milk in recipe, three garlic cloves, no soy sauce (didn't have any), and mixed Italian cheese.  Probably spice it up a bit next time.

I used pasta made from mushrooms and skipped the extra mushrooms.  So good! For those who don't mind the taste of mushrooms but don't like the texture--it was the perfect solution.  I also used a bag of fresh spinach instead of frozen.  Just let it steam above the mixture.

Love Love Love! We use this recipe often since everyone in my family LOVES this! I use olive oil instead of vegetable and vegetable oil instead of margarine. I cut back by 1-2 Tablespoons of the soy sauce to reduce the sodium. YUM!

I thought it was great, I did about 1/2 the soy it called for. I could have used what the recipe called for. 

Fresh spinach with a mixture of cheeses I had on hand. Wonderful dish, it leaves me wondering though what it needs...it needs one more ingred.

Will make again for sure. The two of us ate it up in two days

Made this tonight. The soy sauce was overpowering and didnt work well with the spinach. This combination almost tasted like sushi (which i do not like). The amount of spinach the recipe called for was way too much for our tastes. Overall did not like this and will not make again.

I cooked half of a red onion; then I added swiss chard  ( didn't have any spinach) and the mushroom; then the garlic and basil. It was awesome!! I think it would have been great even without the cheese mix :)

I used slightly more pasta (10-12 ounces). Also I accidentally put more basil in when the cap came loose but I think the extra basil is good. The soy blended in with other ingredients, so I don't understand reviewers who say "all I can taste is soy- ewww!" They probably forgot an ingredient or measured wrong.  I'm giving this 4 stars because my family rated it 4- I think it is a 3. Also I can't see how this serves 8 people; more like 5 or 6

I will definitely make again - maybe next week! I sauteed onion, then added the portobellos, but added a bit more time for browning. I cut margarine in half, and used more garlic. I only had non-fat milk and skim mozzarella, so used those. The resulting white sauce wasn't smooth and rich (obviously) so I tossed in ~ 1/2 c. of parmesan, kept stirring and it turned out great tasting and creamy. I used fresh spinach, stirred it into pasta and sauce, then added the rest of the ingredients along with sun-dried tomatoes. I forgot the soy sauce, so who knows how good it will be if I choose to make it correctly! Everyone at home said mmm good.

I did my best to make this lower in calories and use healthier ingredients. I used whole wheat penne rigate and 1 tablespoon each of butter and EVOO with 2 tablespoons flour instead of the 1/2 cup of butter/1/4 cup of flour to make the roux. I also used 1 can fat free evaporated milk and made up the rest up to two cups with nonfat milk. I sauteed the mushrooms and the added half large onion and 4 cloves garlic in another tablespoon each of butter and EVOO before adding the roux ingredients. It was plenty thick the way I made it, especially after adding the cheese. I used fresh spinach that I tossed with the pasta and sauce after I'd removed them from the heat and I only used 1 tablespoon of worchestershire sauce (I'm out of soy at the moment--there's actually a little soy in worchestershire sauce) just to cut down on the salt. I think I did pretty well with my healthier substitutions. The kids and husband thought it was pretty good. I think I might omit the worchestershire/soy sauce next time and go with another flavor. I think it needs something but the soy/worchestershire isn't it. Maybe more mushrooms? I served this with Chicken Breasts with Balsamic and Garlic.

Loved it! I served it at a BBQ for 20 people and everyone - children included - raved about it and there wasn't a bit left. I made it as is. Those who feel it's runny probably aren't making the white sauce properly: remember slow, low temperature, stiring lots, have patience for it to really thicken.

I had some extra portobello's in the fridge I needed to use up before they turned, and I am VERY happy I chose this recipe. I didn't have any soy sauce so I omitted that, but it was still delicious. I feel like it could have used a little more pop somewhere, maybe more basil or garlic? However, I also like my food very seasoned, so it could be personal preference. Delicious recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly, except I used white mushrooms instead of portobello, which I didn't have, and doubled the garlic. I thought this was quite good. The soy sauce gives it a nice touch. Nice, thick consistency. The only problem was I thought it lacked a deep, rich flavour. Maybe I shouldn't have substituted the mushrooms? I will make again, but will tweak the flavours a bit. Note: for those of you who like to eat pasta cold, this dish does NOT taste very good cold. Much better heated.

I loved it, but somehow my husband did not... :(   I doubled the garlic, substituted the mozarella with slices of light provolone (that's what i had in the fridge) layered at the bottom and on top, and used 1% milk and did everything else according to recipe, and it came out wonderful.  Even better for leftover the next day!  I don't know why people's sauce are not thickening; mine came out really nice and thick even though i used low fat milk!

I used this recipe as a jumping off point.  I cooked the mushrooms with a cup of chopped onions and 2 cloves of minced garlic, then used 4 tablespoons butter, 6 tablespoons flour, and 3 cups of milk to make the sauce.  I accidentally used a teaspoon and a half of basil instead of half a teaspoon, but it was good anyway.  Because I increased the milk, I used 5 tablespoons of soy sauce.  Upon tasting it, I decided to add 3 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar because I didn't really like that you could identify the soy sauce flavor and one of our favorite sauces for sauteed or roasted veggies is browned butter, soy sauce and balsamic vinegar.  I was a little worried about the sauce separating, but it was fine thankfully.  You couldn't really identify the flavors as being soy sauce and balsamic vinegar, it was just good.  Oh and I used 13 oz broccoli instead of spinach and left out the cheese.  So my version was kind of different from the written recipe, but such is the joy of manipulating recipes to what you want!  All in all, we quite enjoyed this casserole and I plan to make it again.  Next time I'm going to add 2 chopped, cooked chicken breasts (which I forgot to add this time around, I increased the sauce because of the chicken and extra broccoli!) and sprinkle swiss cheese in the middle and on top.  I think adding a can of rinsed Great Northern beans for the protein would be good too if you want to keep it vegetarian.

I cut down the margarine based on the comments of other reviewers.  Also lessened the spinach and added some broccoli.  Great dish, though it could use some more spices!

Edit: I played around with this recipe again tonight and loved the end result!  I added about half of a medium onion in with the mushrooms.  Then used 1/2 the margarine, fresh basil, salt, pepper and a bit of cayenne.  I also increased the amount of garlic.  This gave me the spice I was looking for.  I really enjoyed it!

Love this recipe!!!  Make it all the time.  I use a whole pound box of pasta and add two baked chicken breasts cut into bite size pieces.  I also split into two 8x8 baking dishes and freeze one before baking for another dinner.

I made this for dinner a couple of days ago; my fiance absolutely DEVOURED it! I used tamari sauce in place of soy sauce and added about 1-2 tbsps of grated parmesan-romano cheese. 2 thumbs up! :)

This was pretty good.  i added the entire 2 cups of milk.  you just have to do it gradually.  add some milk let it thicken back up and add more.  I accidently added too much garlic for my taste.  Otherwise good find.

Fabulous! This reminds me of my favorite dish at Casa's, a local Italian restaurant. It was easy to make and delicious. I did use extra penne (just used all that was in the box) and extra spinach (again, just used the whole box), reduced the butter by about 2 Tbs., used 2 good sized garlic cloves, cut the milk to 1 3/4 c. as per other's suggestions, and squeezed the spinach to rid it of excess water. It was not at all runny, and I think the 2 cups of milk would have been okay-you just have to be patient and wait for the sauce to thicken before mixing it all in, or I can see how it would be runny. The soy sauce was an excellent addition! Served with potato rosemary bread from the bakery section of the supermarket and romaine lettuce mixed with Cesar dressing. Great vegetarian meal! Will make this again.

This recipe was great but I agree with other reviewers that the soy sauce needs to be cut back or entirely omitted.  Adding red pepper flakes gave it a great kick.

This really is a five star recipe. I used half the butter, half the soy, 1 1/2c milk and two garlic cloves - and it turned out just right. It surely won't serve 8 as indicated... maybe 4.

Very good! I used a multi-grain penne and it was yummy. Next time I might add chicken or broccoli in place of spinach would also be good. I will also add some more basil. I cooked a bag of fresh spinach in place of the frozen and doubled the mushrooms. I love this recipe because can make it really healthy without sacrificing flavor!

Absolutely delicious!  I actually made the mistake of using a 16oz bag of pasta for that amount of sauce--and it was still absolutely delicious!  I sprinkled the dish with bread crumbs and the bf and I couldn't have had a more satisfying meal last night!   Thanks!

This is one of my favorite dishes!  It's a regular in our home.  I do double the pasta, and the soy sauce as well add an extra cup of cheese, and substitute broccoli for spinach.  It's a wonderful dish!  My husband the meat eater loves this!! Thanks for the great recipe!

WAY too salty for us. I would cut back a little on the soy sauce because it was just too much. Other than that the flavor was great.

This was a really great dish, though I added more flour and might just use less milk and butter next time.  I added onions and throwing in some cooked chicken would be a great addition as well.

I liked the idea of this casserole a lot. But i found it to be fairly bland. In the end I added onion, more garlic, parmesean cheese, a little balsamic vinegar, some rosemary and way more basil. With the leftovers I ended up adding a tin of tuna and it did make for a great no condensed soup tuna casserole. I wanted to love it, but it just didn't have enough flavor for me.

Very interesting and different recipe. I love pasta, so I thought it was worth a shot. I halved the butter, used whole wheat penne, skim milk and olive oil instead of vegetable....just to make it a little healthier. I also added a can of tomatoes because I wanted more veg. I was skeptical of the soy sauce, but it made the dish. The only thing was it was a little bland. I think next time I will spice up the sauce a little with some crushed red pepper and maybe even garlic salt. Thanks for a recipe I can build on.

The dish lookd great while cooking and my husband and I thought it would taste as good, but the soy sauce really turned us off. I think I would make again without the soy sauce, it just overpowered the whole dish.

This is the best recipe I've ever cooked!  I made just a few changes.  I used thyme instead of basil because this is all I had. I doubled the mozzarella cheese. I was hesitant to put the soy sauce in the end, however it made the recipe!  This was something comparable to the olive garden! I will definitely make this again. Everyone that tasted this, said three words...oh my god!

Terrific recipe!  After reading other reviews, made some changes:  used a 14oz box of whole grain pasta, fresh spinach, low-fat mozzarella & 2% milk, cut butter back to 1/4 cup, doubled garlic, added an onion, red pepper flakes & pepper plus mixed most of the cheese in with the milk & only saved around a 1/3 cup to sprinkle on top.  Not sure why others thought it was bland at all.  Will definitely make again.

I followed the recipe exactly, (perhaps just less spinach), and WOO-HOO was it good!  I don't normally cook with butter or milk, (we're kind of health nuts), but we were having company so I thought I'd spare them from our typical ways.  LOVED IT!  Some people said it looks gross, but when you bake the cheese on top, I think it really looks great!  I sprinkled parm on top at the end for presentation as well.

My family really didn't care for this dish all that much, although we love most of the ingredients that go into it.  It was just OK.  With as much fat as it calls for,probably will not make this again, not worth the splurge.

I dont think I got this right because it was kind of boring and bland to me.  But the base concept is good and healthy (I used wheat penne) so I will just do some tweeking.  maybe some parmesan and onion?

Excellent base but it was a bit bland. I added in extra garlic, black pepper, salt, & parmesan & it still tastes like it's missing something. I'll keep tweaking til I figure it out because it IS really good!

Very good.  This tastes like something you would get at macaroni grill.  Next time I will probably add some grilled chicken, use fresh spinach and increase the garlic.

Very good and easy to make.  Firstly, I must make an official statement on soy sauce.  Soy sauce is the beautiful elixir of life.  I add soy sauce to almost everything.  Spaghetti sauce, gravy, steaks, pizza, eggs, ham, etc.  But then again, I'm Asian. In Japan, you don't see salt and pepper on the table; they give you soy sauce in lieu of salt.  Soy sauce is a better version of salt, and can be added to almost anything, so DON'T KNOCK THE SOY SAUCE!!  I made some changes to this.  I increased the garlic, because that is my SOP Standard Operating Procedure.  I added rosemary, pepper,  and a tiny bit of nutmeg.  I also sauteed the shrooms with some balsalmic vinegar.  I also added some parmsan cheese to the top of the casserole.  Very tasty indeed.

Great casserole though I had to adapt it so it was Gluten-free for some celiac persons in my family.  I used G.F. penne, used G.F. cornstarch not flour, substituted 1 tsp. G.F. tamari for the 1/4 c. soy sauce and for taste sake, substituted a small bunch of fresh spinach, lightly steamed for the frozen spinach which I find too full of stems to be palatable.  Still easy to make in its Gluten-free metamorphosis and even easier to eat - it's delicious and I know I'll make it often.  Thank you for the fine recipe!!

Oh this was so good! And easy enough for someone who's still learning her way around her new kitchen. I think I too might cut back on the soy sauce, though, because while it added flavor, it wasn't exactly the flavor that I was crazy about. I tasted the sauce before I added the soy sauce and thought it was perfect. This will definitely be placed in the "When company comes over/in-laws are visiting" shelf to be made again.

Really good!  I hate messing with frozen spinach - so next time will use the fresh - or  broccoli :) I used the new 4 cheese italian blend light shredded cheese which I think really added to it and definitely the light soy sauce! I did add pepper and might even add a little more spice next time - rich but yummy :)

This dish was very appealing and we did enjoy it but next time, I'll leave out the soy sauce.  Only used two TBS but still thought it was too much.  I put a little fresh basil instead of dry, which can also be overpowering. Also, used minced roasted garlic from a jar instead of fresh...will use a little more next time.  I served some breaded chicken cutlets alongside...This would be a good dinner party dish.  Good Cook Glo

Really enjoyed this meatless pasta dish.  I followed the recipe almost to the letter (just substituted 1 cp water and 1 cp half and half for 2 cps milk).  It was very easy and quick to make, and my wife and I really loved all the flavors.  I will definitely make this again.

I substituted the recipe by using a sliced mushrooms of a different variety, using wheat flour and soy milk. It turned out pretty good. I also, used a little less milk than what the reciped called for.

Pretty good. I added diced chicken to mine. I forgot to add the soy sauce and it tasted just fine. I used Sargento Bistro Blends Italian Pasta Cheese. It added really great flavor. I think it might have been a bit bland otherwise. (I also did an Italian seasoning on the chicken: Penzey's Tuscan Sunset).

so delicious! i sub'd butter for marg and cut the amount back to 5 T. I also added a .5 t of cornstarch. I think I'd add less milk next time. I also added the red pepper flakes like other reviews suggested and upped the amount of garlic. Husband suggested adding chicken next time. I couldn't stop eating it!

This was okay. I thought it was a little bland, needed more salt/pepper. I will make it again but spice it up a littler more next time.

This looked and smelt delish, until I put in the soya sauce... I have to say that, event though some people swear by the soya sauce... for me, it's a definite NO. I think it's an acquired taste. I substituted the spinach for broccoli and also cut the milk down to 1 1/4 cup and added 3/4 cup of cream of mushroom soup. A little salt and pepper to taste. 1 cup of mozzerella and 1 cup of cheddar, and I also sprinkled the top with some parmesan. Without the soya, I would have given this 5 stars.... but alas, the look and taste with the soya, was a no go, for me. I can't even bring myself to eat the leftovers. That's a big N0-NO for me. So, needless to say, I was somewhat disappointed.

This was the first recipe i had tried from this site and it was in a word... AMAZING! My family loved it especially the portobello mushrooms!! I used fresh spinach and added more than what the recipe suggested (about an addition half of what was suggested). The soya sauce is a must be brave and try it it makes all the difference. My family loved it and with three grown men to feed it went a long way!!! Two thumbs up.

Fantastic recipe.  Used the soy sauce and not sure on that flavor yet..I plan to try recipe without soy sauce and see what it tastes like. I was generous with the fresh garlic and added more spinach as veggies are zero points for me and extend the serving size to get a satiated feeling.  Recipe as I used it was only 5 points for those watching their diets and following a specific plan.  I can see using this recipe with shrimp adjusting the points count added for a different flavor.  I will add this recipe to my low point stash of recipes

Holy creaminess!!  I eyeballed everything for this recipe, but did not stray from the listed ingredients.  I used 16 oz mushrooms and about half of the butter and flour.  I also use fresh spinach and used about 4 big handfuls, which I am guessing was about -8 cups (before it was cooked)...  I agree that *something* might be missing, so I wil def play with this one to figure it out. Maybe I will start with pepper flakes as others have suggested...  thanks for the different recipe!

This one is definitely a keeper.  I had some fresh kale on hand, so substituted that, and I am a serious garlic fan so I made it downright offensive.  ;-)  Omitted the soy sauce -- I can see where that would taste awesome but I have to watch the sodium.  Really, really, really good.  Thanks so much for sharing this!

Husband usually doesn't like casseroles since they can be "bland," but this one was very tasty. I used chopped fresh red chard (steamed prior to mixing with the other ingredients) instead of spinach since that's what I had, and substituted about 1 cup parmesan for the mozzarella.

My husband and I loved this! I added some sun dried tomatoes and meatballs that really made the dish. Without the sun dried tomatoes, it just tasted good but with them, the dish is outstanding. I will be making this many, many more times to come.

I've made this several times and the whole family loves it.  It's a great way to get my 3 yr old eating spinach!  I always use skim milk (it's all I have in the fridge) and part skim mozzarella, and it turns out great.  I've done it both with and without soy sauce and although I like it both ways, the soy sauce does add an extra zing.

More like 4 and a half stars - delish!  I cut the mushrooms into 1/2 inch chunks, used rigatoni pasta, skipped the basil and added a can of garlic and onion diced tomatoes, drained.  So good and pretty healthful if you use 1% milk and part-skim mozzarella.  Thanks for the post!

This wasn't bad.  I used fresh baby spinach instead of frozen spinach but I think I should have chopped it up - it was pretty stringy in the end.  If I make this again I will use less cheese.  It also needs a little more zip but I'm not sure what to do about that.

I was really looking forward to this dish but it didn't turn out as good as I was hoping. The only change I made was to add 2 cloves of garlic instead of one. I don't think it was saucey enough so if I ever make it again, I will probably up the milk and see what happens.

We loved this right out of the oven - but the bit of leftovers we had didn't taste as great the second time around (I think mushrooms and spinach aren't always the best things to have reheated), so I would suggest keeping that in mind if you are serving less people the first go around than it serves.  I think that the step of squeezing out all of the water from the thawed spinach was probably accidentally left out of this recipe, so make sure to do that (whenever using frozen spinach - in any recipe!).  We also added a little chopped red bell pepper when cooking the mushrooms and it added a nice splash of color.  Good recipe!

I was skeptical of the soy sauce, but it really made the flavor pop.  Very good, it makes a boatload so be prepared for leftovers.  For the leftovers, I added some chopped kielbasa to this and was very good.

This was ok, not great, not bad. Unfortunately my kids would not eat it, husband didn't comment on it, so it's not a keeper. For some reason it tasted a bit floury, and I'm not really sure why. Think I'll be the only one eating the left overs.

My husband loved this dish so much he keeps asking when I will be making more. The only thing I changed was I used less soy sauce other then that I followed the recipe to the letter. Great for company too that really like the taste of mushrooms because that is a dominant flavor in this dish. A+

This recipe was absolutely fantastic! It was super east to put together but tasted like I'd slaved away for hours.   My mom even said that it tasted like something we'd order from Le Sole Mio, our favorite gourment Italian restaurant.

I must have done something wrong. I did use butter instead of margarine, and I did use salt instead of soy sauce, so that may be it. I found it to be overly rich and bland-tasting. Maybe it needs a stronger-flavored cheese, like parmesan. I will try that next time, and also use less spinach, as the spinach was overpowering.

My husband and I both really enjoyed this recipe. I substituted fresh spinach for the frozen because that's what I had on hand and it worked great. Used about 3/4 of a 10oz bag, didn't cook it first, just threw it in the sauce. Great meatless dish although I could see where adding cooked cubed chicken would be good also.

I really liked this recipe.  I am allergic to gluten so I used gluten free penne.  Instead of the 1/4 cup all-purpose flour, I used 1 Tbsp soy flour, 1 Tbsp tapioca flour, and 2 Tbsp brown rice flour.  I also added 1 Tbsp corn starch to the milk.  I doubled the garlic and instead of the soy sauce, I used 1 Tbsp. salt.  OK, so I didn't exactly make this recipe as/is, but this version came out really, really good.  Next time, I am going to try the soy sauce.  I am very curious...  Thanks for the recipe!

Yum! I absolutely loved this recipe.  I used mini penne and also fresh baby spinach instead of frozen because I had it on hand.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  I thought the soy sauce was different but really tasty.  I will definitely make this again and again.  Tasted very rich for less than 400 calories per serving!

This is a great tasting dish, I have served it a couple of times in the last month and everyone that has tried it has to get the recipe from me.  I think the next time I make it I am going to put some chicken breast in it.

Good dish, but needs just a slight change.  Made it tonight for my husband and I.  The aroma is excellent, but the flavor is lacking something else.  We both agreed that adding chopped roasted red pepper with the mushrooms might be just what it needs.  We'll try again--Thanks for a tasty dish we can make our own.

I thought this recipe was really good! My family loved it and said it was a definite keeper. We all loved the soy sauce in it. I didn't do it this time, but next time I'm going to make it earlier in the day and just stick it in the oven at mealtime.

I have made this many many times now, it's one of my favorites.  I double the amount of pasta and garlic and use fresh spinach instead of frozen.  Such a perfect dinner, and it reheats well the next day too.

Good recipe. I made it for some family and friends. Only thing is that I ended up having to turn the oven off and leave the pasta in for about ten minutes because my guests were running late. That really dried the recipe out so make sure that you are ready to take it to the table straight from the oven. Otherwise, it has good taste.

This was awesome!!!  I did add two extra cloves of garlic and used 2 tablespoons of my 1/2 cup of butter to sautee the mushrooms in instead of using oil. This is one I'll make again and again!

I had a dinner party with a vegetarian attending so decided to try this. I didn't like it at all. Everyone said it was okay. Some red pepper flakes on top helped a bit. I should have made stuffed shells or cheese lasagna instead!

I made a few changes to this: added green bell peppers and more fresh garlic. Also my 3 year old wanted elbow noodles so I obliged. My husband, son and neighbor loved it! My husband said it was like 'souped up' macaroni and cheese only way better. I am eager to try this again with the penne noodles to see how it changes, but I do suggest elbow noodles to make it more kid friendly.

This went over very well! Very easy to make ahead of time and refrigerate until ready to pop in the oven. I have to admit, while putting all the ingredients together I was a little turned off..especially with the soy sauce..but, was pleasantly suprised at the outcome!

This recipe would've been better without the soy sauce. I guess if you really love soy sauce this recipe is great...but it kind of overpowered the meal, and made it hard to eat a lot of it. Overall I did enjoy it.

i made this on two different occasions and we just didn't like it.  to me the tastes don't blend well, with all the mozzarella it's too gooey and i don't like the sauce because even with seasoning it lacks flavor.  i probably won't make this again.

It didn't float my boat, to be honest. Something gave it a very odd texture, and the flavour, while interesting, wasn't one I'd say I liked. Don't think I'll make again.

I reduced the amount of soy sauce to 1/8 of a cup.  The dish was delicious.

Very good recipe.  I did half the butter and it was still great.  I made it for a friend who had a new baby and her entire family raved over it!!

A new favorite in our home. I used only half the cheese and used a lowfat milk to cut some calories and it was delicious.

I was worried about this one.  It turned out good though!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because all 3 of my kids hated it.  My husband and I enjoyed it enough to keep the leftovers.  I made the recipe exactly as written.

Not sure what to say about the recipe. I made it exactly to the recipe. It was a rich, hearty meal but I was left wanting just a bit more from it in terms of taste. I would make it again, maybe fudge the recipe a bit and play around with it.

It was really good to me, but my family thought it had too much spinach.  Next time I make it I will use half of recommended spinach.

This was good, but would have been much better with half (or less) the soy sauce.  Next time I make it I'm just going to use a few tablespoons.
