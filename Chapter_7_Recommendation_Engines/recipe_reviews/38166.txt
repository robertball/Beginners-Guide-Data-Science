Well, I had everything on hand, so decided to make this MOST delicious dish, let me say, it was awesome!!!! Husband is picky, and he LOVED it too! I used skirt steak, also used the marinade in the sauce, and subbed broccoli for the shrooms as my husband dosen't like shrooms! I had angel hair, x-tra cheese is a must always, but we will definetly be amking this wonderful dish again & again!!!! Thanks to whomever submitted it!!!!!!!!!!

Simply amazing. This was much better than I envisioned .. usually pasta dishes have a creamy sauce .. this was delightful. I scaled it down to 2 .. still found I only needed 1/4 lb flank versus the 3/4 lb it scaled down to. I had no idea how many portobello mushrooms were required for 1 cup so I just used 2. I wish I had added 1 whole tomato (as instructed) instead of half - will do that next time. And there WILL BE a next time!! Yum!

The recipe tasted great, smelled great and me look like the chef I never tried to be, To add a personal flare and taste to the beef I tried a flavored liqour such as Barcardi O (citris rum) to give it a slight twang instead of the dry white wine.

I thought this recipe was very easy and flavorful.  I was afraid of the recipe list because I thought it would be a budget buster, but it turned out to be not so bad.  I added some balsamic vinegar when I added mushrooms, which I think improves the flavor.  I would definitely try to thicken the sauce next time though, perhaps with some cornstarch.  I used strip steaks, I would double the amount of meat called for if you're feeding a family, but the marinade was great and the meat was tender.  The whole dish was very unique and certainly worth my while.

I used this recipe as a base for a pasta dish. Instead of the flank steak, I cooked sweet sausage in olive oil, then tossed in mushrooms, onions, garlic then followed along. It came out great!

Edible, but won't make again. Followed the recipe almost exactly (omitted the tomatoes, added a shallot and a few more spices at the end). Very one-dimensional in flavor. The wine is overpowering in the meat; perhaps rubbing it with a mixture of the mustard, W. sauce, Italian seasoning, and lemon juice would have been better as a marinade. I found myself scrambling at the end to add some seasonings to save the dish from complete boredom. Luckily, the Asiago helped a lot, but the recipe shouldn't have relied on the cheese to "make" it.

I've been making this recipe for about five years now- it's one of our favorites.  The sauce is thin- and is absorbed wonderfully into fresh pasta.  It's a light dish, so if you're looking for a heavy, saucy pasta dish this isn't what you're looking for!  The flavors are so complimentary - it's just delicious!  I always use button mushrooms (cheaper) and have used both red and white wine- both are marvelous.  Always add garlic, however!

I thought this was O.K. The redeeming part was the asiago cheese at the end. Too watery. Just not all that fabulous though my husband loved the flavor. Won't make again.

This recipe turned out extremely soupy.  It tasted okay, but the sauce was like water.  We tried adding flour, but it didn't help.  Reheating the recipe the next day just made is even more runny.

This was very tasty, but the sauce was so thin, it was like a broth.  I would have prefered it to have a thicker consistency.

I am surprised I haven't rated this yet, as I've been making this dish for a year or two now. I always enjoy it, and have only had to make a few minor changes. First, I use just regular button mushrooms. I also add about a tablespoon of dijon mustard and a dash of worcestershire to the main sauce part just to give it a little more zing. I usually omit the tomatoes. I like my tomatoes raw or fully cooked, but not warmed. :) Other than that, this is a wonderfully light and flavorful dish. The meat is always very tender. Keep in mind that the sauce is going to be thin. You can thicken it with a little corn starch if you wish, but some of it is going to be absorbed when you add the pasta anyway. Great with a salad and some soft honey wheat rolls for sopping up the broth. Thank you very much!

Looking at the list of ingredients, this recipe sounded wonderful.  Unfortunately, it didn't come together too well.  It was very bland considering all the mouth-watering ingredients.  The grated cheese was the only good thing.  It was also very runny, and that's even after I didn't use the cup of white wine at the end in an effort to make it less runny after hearing this complaint in other reviews.

I served this over brown rice without cheese (or tomatoes).  I also made a few adjustments for thicker sauce by halfing the beef stock and adding about some cornstarch.  I added 1 tbsp each of dijon and worcestershire with the stock as well for the extra flavor, as suggested by another member.  Turned out excellent!!  My boyfriend loved it and it was quite flavorful.

My version of this recipe tasted pretty good, the only reason its not a 5* is because I changed quite a few things in it. First I used red wine instead of white and only used half the amount.  I also added more worcestershire sauce and omitted the tomatoes.  I chopped the meat into cubes rather than strips and I used button mushrooms instead of the other ones.  With all these changes it was a pretty good recipe which I'll willingly make again.

Excellent dish! My girlfriend and I loved the intense flavors and were suprised how light this meal is. Instead of white wine, I used red wine to bring out the flavors of the steak. Also I added corn starch to thicken up the sauce and added more tomatos in the sauce. Serve this dish with the same red wine for marinating the steaks. Will make again!

My family and I liked this recipe, although I altered it a little. I had burgandy wine on hand, so I used it instead of the white. I also thickened the sauce using a mixture of cornstarch and water. (just making it a little thinner than pancake batter) I added the cornstarch mixture to the rapidly boiling sauce, constantly stirring.I let it cook until it was thickened, and then added the tomatoes for just a few min. Pretty good. I will make it again.

I enjoyed this recipe very much.  I did add a tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken the sauce, as others have mentioned, and despite it not doing much to effect the thickness, I don't think that it was necessary.  The sauce was thin, but it's a Northern Italian recipe and there is so much else going on in it that it doesn't detract from the flavor.  I suggest serving it in one bowl, so the noodles can absorb some of the sauce before serving.

This was a tasty dish that my husband and I enjoyed.  We loved the mushroom flavor.  The kids didn't like it as much, though, but that's kids!  The sauce was a little too thin so maybe next time I'll try to thicken it.  It'll be worth making it a seconed time! Enjoy!

Excellent!!  A great new texture and flavor to add to my pasta dishes.  Regarding the many negative comments on this dish.  There are some basic tecniques that will likely help tremendously.  First, always taste your food before serving and Doctor as necessary, especially with salt and pepper.  If you like a hotter dish, some red pepper flakes would have gone well.  Second, I and many of us may be serving pasta wrong.  The technique I have picked up is to put the al dente pasta in a serving dish and the mix the hot sauce in well before serving to give it time to absorb the thin sauce.  There was very little sauce at the bottom of the platter when I served it this way.  Do not thicken!!!  The Asiago over the top certainly makes the dish but that isn't a complaint, that's the dish!!  One other thing, I sautéed the sliced beef after cooking the mushroom till brown and garlic.  Then removed the beef once just browned and added and cooked the liquids down to about 2 cups.  Otherwise you are boiling the steak and that's just weird.  Then the beef goes back in to heat up just before pouring over and tossing with, the pasta.  The old picture we have all seen of tomato sauce sitting on top of cooked pasta is completely wrong!  It must always be mixed in to absorb into the pasta before serving.  Ciao!

Don't be fooled by the 4out of 5 stars....It is indeed very bland and the sauce is way too thin to stick to noodles...which makes it even more bland. Also adding the meat to the sauce (boiling it) makes it rubbery.  Don't waste your flank on this :)

I thought this was very good. My hubby loved it. I made a few changes. I used 1/2c white wine, 1/2c red wine vinegar in the marinade. Along with Garlic. When cooking the meat, I added 1/2c white wine, and 1/2c of the marinade. I think that helped with the flavor. I also added a little thickening. I topped with a Italian cheese blend and mozzarella. Will do again.

I disagree with others that this recipe is bland -- I thought the flavor was delicious. I used sirloin instead of flank steak as it's what I had in the freezer. I didn't stray from the recipe except that I used a bit more worchestershire sauce (eyeballed it) and attempted to thicken the sauce with cornstarch. It wouldn't thicken!! I think this recipe would be far more enjoyable if the sauce weren't so...runny and soupy. I probably won't make it again.

I prepared this dish on the eve of the opening of the Olympics from Torino.  Everyone really liked this dish, but next time I would broil the meat a bit first, due to cutting down on fat.

It was fine, however I felt it was too liquidy and lacked a bit in flavor.  My husband and brother in-law liked it.

Great dish! A little bland. But I agree red wine instead of white would help with the flavor.

Thought this would be much better than it turned out to be.  Lots of great ingrediants, not much flavor.  Won't make again.

This recipe was great. I took the leftovers to work and everyone wanted me to print out the recipe. It was great flavor without a lot of difficulty to prepare. Helpful hint- Shredded Asiago cheese made by DiGiorno can be found next to refrigerated pasta at the grocery store.
