This is really good!  It kind of reminds us of mexican monkey bread.  Very easy, and the kids just gobbled it up.  I didn't have salsa, so I used a can of Rotel (liquid drained) and a can of green chilies instead.  The aroma while it was baking was wonderful and I can't help thinking this would  be an interesting alternative to cornbread.  Will definitely make again. Update: made again, but used muffin tins instead of the large baking dish and it was even better! It gave the bread more of a cheese crust.  Anyways I continue to use the Rotel/green chilies instead of the salsa.  I like the flavor better.

I made this exactly as written.  It was ok...but seemed to be lacking in flavor.  I can't put my finger on what is missing but I don't think I will make it again.

What a surprise this was! I really liked it, my DH and son not so much.  I halved the recipe as this was a snack for watching football.  I sprinkled some garlic powder, onion powder and chili powder in a couple of tablespoons melted butter, and  poured that over the top before adding the cheese.  I would like to try this same idea and make pizza bread next time.  Thank you SSTACI!!

We loved this! I only used 1 can of biscuits, so I adjusted the other ingredients accordingly, but other than that, I made this exactly as written. We thought this had wonderful flavor and it was so simple to prepare. I will definately be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Yummy! I made sort-of a half recipe of this only using one canister of whomp biscuits in a 8x8 square pan. I used my own homemade salsa and a cup and a half of pepper-jack cheese. I think using homemade salsa and a peppier cheese helped this recipe quite a bit. I think this would be even better if I had stirred in a little homemade taco seasoning into the salsa before I spread it on the dough pieces. GREAT cheap and quick "side" on a very low-cook feelin' kind of day plus I always coupon whomp biscuits for next to nothing so this was a new way to use them. This would make a fun white trash party app!

Not bad, but I think I would prefer a different bread in this.  I think it needs something a little more flavorful--the biscuit is good where it comes in contact with what is added, but it sort of dry and boring without it.  I used minced garlic instead of onions--we're not huge onion fans, and the salsa I used had onions anyway.  I prefer it that way.  Very good with our chicken and green bean dinner a few nights ago.  thanks for the recipe!

Extremely Blande, adding salsa makes it hard to cook all the way through. Was hoping for a Mexican monkey bread, got garbage disposal fodder.
