This was very good and the best part is it didn't take long which was good because I didn't plan my marinade much in advance. Good for a thrown together steak dinner.

Avery good marinade I did substitute lime for the lemon though any citrus fruit slices would be a welcomed variance. I also let stand in the mairnade for 30 minutes before refridgerating it seemed to help tenderize the meat. Thanks for the recipe..

I let the beef marinade for 4 hours - everybody really liked it. I didn't have a lemon so I used about 1 tsp lemon juice instead. Will definitely use again!

This marinade was spectacular!!!! Although I can't bring myself to marnade my steak for only one hour so I left out the lemon slices to cut down on acidity and marinaded the meat for 24 hours. The wine flovour really came through.

Good recipe! I used a cheap piece of beef and did it at the last minute. Turned out nice.

Marinated for about an hour in glass pyrex and then grilled the petite steaks. Definitely made the steaks very tender, but did not impart alot of flavor other than the red wine. I would suggest using fresh garlic, increasing the soy and allowing it to marinate longer. Or, if you like the flavor of just red wine, skip the other steps and just use the wine!

As with other comments created a very tender steak but lacked flavor other than the wine (which was very nice!) I agree - more soy sauce is probably a good idea. I also like the fact that it is quick - I don't always plan ahead well enough to wait 24 hours for my main course!

I tried this tonight and the steak was still a little chewy (I used flank steak and only marinated about an hour) but the flavor was wonderful. I will definitely use again. Thanks for the great recipe.

Nothing at all what I anticipated from all the great reviews. Found it average...
