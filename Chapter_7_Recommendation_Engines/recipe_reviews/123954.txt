Quite easy. Not really brownies, more like a Crazy Cake or Texas Sheet Cake. This did need to be baked longer than 20 minutes. It was almost 30 minutes before it was cooked through. I didn't add nuts because my husband asked me not to. I think it would be better with. I also would like to add more cocoa next time. The frosting for this cake is MONEY. I bet this cake would be even better the next day. NOTE: Don't freak out when the frosting seperates when you spread it on a hot cake. It's supposed to do that. It'll all come out in the wash.
And yes, this cake really is better the next day. The icing really makes this cake shine.

I have this same recipe but my frosting is a little different.  I use 4 T butter, 1/4 C cocoa, 1/4 C buttermilk (combine is a saucepan, bring to a boil, remove from heat and add:) 1 t vanilla, 2 1/4 C powdered sugar.  Spread over warm brownies.

I have this SAME recipe-I received it from a friend who has been making it for years.  These Brownies are melt-in-your mouth fabulous!!  Not cakey and not fudgy either. Just by looking at them in the pan you know they are going to be delicious.  I'm sure this frosting is very good on many different desserts.

I did a few things differently because I prefer a less sweet more chocolaty taste: I used 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar instead. Also I increased the cocoa to 1/3 cup. I took shortcuts with the batter as I was short on time so I melted the butter, cocoa and water in the microwave. The batter was thin and runny so I was worried it wouldn't work but it turned out just fine.  With the frosting I prefer a more fudgey bitter tasting topping, so I replaced the confectioner's sugar witih just 1/2 a cup of white sugar. Again I melted this in the microwave rather than the stovetop.  This was beautiful and spread well!  The brownie was very rich, dense, moist and yet still had a fudgy cake-like texture - a combination of the best brownie and cake characteristics. I quite liked my modifications as it was not too sweet with a distinct chocolate taste. A small piece is very filling so the cake will last a long time for me!

Moist, soft, and delicious but not "brownies" in my view.  Very similar to Texas Sheet Cake II from this site.  Be sure to use the right sized pan (10 x 15 jelly roll pan).  An easy dessert that is sure to please!

Texture is moist and fluffy, not at all dense as a true brownie would be, and taste is wonderful.  Icing is delicious but very sweet and that is rare for me.  Baking with buttermilk always gives such a moist, wonderful texture.
Will definitely make it again. My husband and son could not get enough of it.
Simple to make with ingredients readily available at home and for once, I followed the instructions as given.   I did baked it in a 9x13inch pan as I did not have a 15x10 in, and for 23min and it was perfect
To me this is definitely a cake though and not a brownie and that's fine with us, so thank you for what will be a regular cake desert in my home.
It can be easily rated as a five star.

This recipe reminded us of the the TV dinner brownie.  I truly feel this is more of a cake than a brownie.  It tastes good but if you're expecting a dense brownie this is nothing like that.  It's fluffy like a cake

Not sure why this is called a brownie.  It's a cake but it's a good one.   Easy to make and kid friendly.

I couldn't find my recipe for "Texas Sheet Cake" so I went to allrecipes to find one.  My friend calls her sheetcake buttermilk brownies which led me to this recipe.  It turned out great.  I have never used buttermilk in the frosting but this was really good!

Yes--more like a sheet cake, but ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!  By the way, I made these with "gourmet" buttermilk once, and they were not as good as when I used regular buttermilk.

These were good.  I did not have eggs so used coconut oil.  They would have been better had I used less coconut oil and added some applesauce.  Other than that, pretty good.

These brownies are delightful. I made for my daughter for her birthday and they were a hit. These brownies are a little more cake like and the frosting is very light. This is deffinately a keeper!

These were good.  More cake like than dense brownie.  I did not make the frosting, as I couldn't get past the amount of butter and powdered sugar involved, but the brownies have a good, but different flavor regardless.  I would make these again.  Oh, I added chocolate chips, which sort of gave it a layer of chips on the bottom, as the batter is thinner than regular brownies, so the chips sank.

I had extra Buttermilk I needed to use so I thought this would calm my chocolate cravings while using up my Buttermilk.  I do agree with others that it turns out more like a cake than a brownie, but it was still so delicious!  I didn't use nearly the amount of confectioners sugar for the icing (I don't like mine super-sweet).  Very yummy!

Though the recipe was tasty and moist...I agree with the other reviews, it is not a brownie, but a cake.  More like a sheet cake.  I spread peanut butter frosting on it (also from this website).

My family loved these!!! They are that perfect after dinner sweet or the late night with milk treat.  Perfect flavor and texture!!  I topped with pecans instead of walnuts and they were bliss!  Thanks for the great recipe.
