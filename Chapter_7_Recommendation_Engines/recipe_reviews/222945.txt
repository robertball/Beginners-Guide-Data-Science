Delicious looking presentation! The dressing is fabulous!!  I never thought of layering fruit salad; always just mixed everything up in a large bowl.  But this is worth the trouble!

Wow, did I get the ooh's and ahh's with this dish.  It is absolutely beautiful.  I served the dessert about 2 hours after I had prepared it.  I changed a few of the fruits, depending what was available at the store.  The only changes I would make to this fruit salad, is reduce the honey dressing by half.  It was just too much and very watery on the bottom.  Also, the amount of fruit in this recipe is overkill.  The amount of fruit listed above makes 2 trifle bowls worth of salad.  I'll be eating leftover fruit for a few days.

This may be better if it is served right away. I made it the night before and the bowl was half full of liquid from the fruit when I served it the next morning. You couldn't even tell what it was for all the liquid in the bowl. The colorful layered presentation is very pretty but I brought 3/4 's of it home. I definitely will not make this one again.

Delicious! I would agree with one of the other reviewers that it is definitely time consuming and makes a ton, so plan accordingly. We really enjoyed it for a different type fruit salad!

I am making this for the second time because the first time it was really good! The only problem is the extended time it takes to wash, peel, and chop the 7 different fruits involved. It took me an hour and a half of steady work. However, my result looks just like the picture and it will be well received at the neighborhood party this evening.

So sweet and fresh! This is one of those recipes you can easily change up  as you need or want to.  I wanted a smaller size so I skipped the cantaloupe and I didn't measure the other fruits.  I omitted the nutmeg...the hint of cinnamon was just right, the dressing is soooo amazing!  I did not halve the grapes or dice the kiwi...they are both so beautiful as they are with delightful mouth feel! Red grapes not available, used green. Used frozen strawberries as I could not find ripe fresh and I used a full 2 Tbls of  confection sugar in the cream cheese. Served the whipped topping on the side so guests could add as desired... skipped the nuts. I served this with the 'Yogurt Cake' recipe found on this site which is lemon flavored. OMG! My brother had 2 servings and also finished the rest off later. I can't wait to make this again!!!
