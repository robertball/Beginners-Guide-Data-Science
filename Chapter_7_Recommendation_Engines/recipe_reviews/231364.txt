Great recipe, easy to use summer veggies. I used white potatoes instead of sweet, doesn't change the recipe. Very tasty.

Yep! This recipe gives new meaning to the word "stew", which would ordinarily be met with disappointment in my house. This has tons of variety and flavor and is quick to make. I did heed another reviewer's advice and was quite cautious with the cayenne (I used only 1/4 teaspoon and thought it was plenty). I added baby mustard greens from my garden and some avocado cubes. I believe this would pass the Paleo diet test, although I am not an expert on that. Yum, yum--I will definitely be adding this to the rotation!!

This was very good. Family loved it. We like spicy foods and I even added a bit more cayenne than the recipe called for. I followed the recipe as written with the substitution of white potatoes in lieu of sweet potatoes (didn't have any on hand). Hubby thought sauce was a little thin so he made a pot of rice and we served it over rice. Sorta has a gumbo feel with a different flavor. Great recipe......it's a keeper! Thanks for sharing.

I have made this a couple times and I always enjoy it. I will reduce the cayenne pepper next time to about a teaspoon to see whether I can get the kids to eat it.

I made the recipe exactly as written. It would actually be much better with a lot less cayenne pepper. It was almost too spicy to eat. We served it over rice.

I made this recipe for 14 people.  I doubled the recipe with a few exceptions.  I added chicken and cut back on the cayenne pepper.  We had younger children and did not want to make it to hot for them .  The andouille sausage has a nice kick to it.  The sweet potatoes were a surprise hit.  This dish has a lot of flavor and was enjoyed by all.  I have shared this recipe with many people.  I highly recommend it.  I did serve it over white rice and had coleslaw as a side.

This recipe came out great! As others have said, I switched out the sweet potato for a regular one. Fair warning, I love spicy food, but my roommate doesn’t, so if you’re cooking for someone less apt to the heat make sure you double back on the amount of cayenne (like, a lot).

For such a simple dish this turned out remarkably good! I love spicy but the cayenne kind of scared me. So I substituted 1 1/2 teaspoons of Allrecipes Simple Cajun Seasoning I keep on hand for jambalaya. I  like using sweet potato over white potato. A little touch of sweet to a smoky spicy stew.

Quick and easy. Tasted awesome and I served immediately as recommended. Used 1/2 cayenne called for in the recipe. Had the perfect kick. This is a definite keeper!

Next time I will only use about 1/2 tsp of cayenne and add brown rice. Then it should be great!
