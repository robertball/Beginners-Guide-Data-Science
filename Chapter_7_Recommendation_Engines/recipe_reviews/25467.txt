these were great!!   I made them when we were camping -- I used fresh pinapple, and since I forgot vinegar, I used some of the pinapple juice instead.  I also used Dijon mustard, instead of plain mustard. My kids LOVED it, even my 6yr old picky eater.
THey were also very easy to make -- a plus when camping.  DOn"t forget to soak your skewer sticks if you are using wood ones, so they don't burn on the grill.

Awesome recipe. I used a turkey ham chunk cut up into pieces since we do not eat pork very often. I also marinated cut up green peppers and mushrooms in another bowl and added to skewers. I served these over the coconut rice recipe on this site with some of the saved marinade from the veggies and wow! I have made these twice now and they will become a regular part of our meal plan. Thank you for something different for dinner!

I added 2 tablespoons soy sauce for a bit of kick and to help lessen the sweetness. We loved it. I may add a clove of crushed garlic next time. I would suggest brushing the sauce on in the last minute of grilling...with all the sugar it burns quickly. My children ate their kabobs raw...I used precooked ham...and loved the sauce. This is definately a repeater!!

This recipe was very good and REALLY easy.  I used fresh pineapple and added a cap full of soy sauce to the glaze for a little more zing.  You really can get this to the table start to finish in less than 30.

Very good!  I brushed on the sauce at the end to keep it from burning.  Pineapple on the grill, yummmmm! This one is a keeper too!

Great ham sauce, I did not have pineapple so I used peachers.  This could also be used in the oven.  Thanks

This tastes great however I would prepare it much differently.  I don't think the kabob adds much and it is rather messy getting the marinated ham on the skewers.  Instead I marinate nice thick slices of ham (not cubed) and grill the ham with large fresh slices of pineapple.  It tastes just as good without the mess and shorter prep time.  I also now marinate the ham overnight.  This is a favorite at our house.

This was absolutely DELICIOUS! Everything about it was good. the coating mixture sound odd and a little bit gross but if you add everything to it it turns out delicious! I even like to double up on it and just cook the kabobs for longer in order to get more of the sweet glaze on there. I will make this again and again. I made it for a party once and they were the first platter gone. Also if you are wondering how to find good ham chunks, I found that "Jennie-O Lean Turkey Ham" is full of flavor and easy to cut into cubes.

Lovely! I was too lazy to use skewers, and it was too cold to go outside, so instead I placed the ham and pineapple in a casserole dish (after marinating overnight), then tucked it into the oven. Baked at 400-F for about 15 minutes, then broiled until the tops were carmelized. I also added cubed cooked sweet potatoes, and served with steamed white rice and soy sauce. Will definitely go into the rotation!

I've made this twice.  The first time it was pretty good but the second time was amazing!  I tripled the sauce and marinated the ham over night. Then while my husband grilled it I heated up the sauce to pour on top.  Next time I'll just double the sauce.  We served it over white rice.  Made excellent leftovers too.

YUM!  We really enjoyed this recipe.  I had left-over ham in the freezer and this made a nice addition to our usual recipes.  I used a fresh pineapple in place of canned.  The sauce was very tasty but there was not enough to richly glaze.  While grilling I had to run back in the house and make more.  I suggest you double the sauce.  I will be making this again and adding it to my "ham" folder in my recipe box.  This was very quick and easy to make.  I served it with white rice and stewed tomatoes.  Thank you Lindsay Perejma for sharing!

I make this a few times a year, and it is always a hit. I usually double or triple the sauce, and baste with it. I can't say strongly enough to only grill this. Don't try it in the oven or any other way. Grill only. If you cannot grill it, try another recipe. But, try this one!  We love it! Usually serve with coconut rice.

To us, this was just ok.  We followed the recipe to a tee except that I added a dash of soy sauce.  It hardly makes any basting glaze at all so that's a problem.  It's not a bad recipe, but not one that I would repeat either.  If you like the taste of ham & pineapple, then you'll probably like this but don't expect much more...

This was a great addition to my daughter's luau. The sauce is sweet and compliments the ham and pineapple well. We even added marischino cherries to the kabobs. But it was pouring rain the day of our luau, so I had to broil the kabobs in the oven instead. I would suggest marinating at least the ham in the brown sugar sauce before grilling so that the flavor gloms on.

These were a huge hit at my Hawaiian themed party this weekend. I used fresh cut pineapple, Black Forest ham and used whole grain mustard in the sauce. They were best when hot and fresh off the grill.  Mahalo for a great recipe!

Made just as is, with the Island Fried Rice from this website; what a great combination! The glaze was the perfect mixture of tangy and sweet and complimented both the ham and the fruit beautifully! Only difference was using chunked fresh pineapple. Delicious. Can't wait to use this glaze on pork chops, perhaps with grilled pineapple on the side!

These were pretty good.  I doubled the sauce and added soy sauce and minced garlic as others suggested.  Sauce was wonderful.  I marinated the ham in the sauce for a couple hours.  The longer the better.  I also added green pepper and marachino cherries for color to the kabobs.

My daughter picked this recipe for a school project. We omitted the mustard and used two tablespoons of rasperry preserves in our mixture for basting while grilling over a low heat. We added cubed onion and green and red peppers to our kabobs. We served it with rice and glazed carrotts as our side dish. They were very tasty. Will make again.

These were really good. I added some chives, crushed red pepper, soy sauce, and garlic to the sauce. I also saved the sauce until near the end of cooking time as recommended. I served these with onion rice. I will make these again for company but next time I will double the sauce and heat it on the side burner of my grill to spoon over white rice. I will also add green peppers and onions to the skewers. A wonderful way to use up leftover pineapple and frozen ham in the summer.

I got this recipe in my email, and decided to forward it to my mom to try since she had left-over ham that she could use. She said it was fabulous and she cannot wait to try the sauce over chicken also. I, unfortunately, did not get a chance to try it, as it was gobbled up right away and I wasn't there!

Our friend gave us a Hawaiian pineapple and I thought I'd try this recipe. It was delicious and even our youngest picky eater enjoyed it! I doubled the sauce and used Jalapeno mustard for a little zip. Served with rice it was a nice light dinner and something new. I will make it again. Fresh pineapple (if you can get it) is the best!

I love this recipe!  I agree with others that it is kid-friendly.  You don't really taste the mustard or vinegar.  I served with coconut rice, which complemented it really well.

I did mine a little different and was a hit for Easter.  I did the ham and pineapple, with bbq sauce, however, I would spray the burner grids with a spray next time.  Everyone seems to love them and I am now looking for something to add to them as a 3rd item.  I like the rice idea listed here on the board..

delicious! I used Jennie-O's lean turkey ham, it was easy to cut up into chunks. I also had a fresh MAUI pineapple that I used as well. I made the sauce as is only I doubled it. very sweet and tasty with a slight teeny tang. I actually marinated the ham, cut into 1 inch cubes, in the sauce all day. I then soaked the skewers before putting on the ham and pineapple chunks. I made this with rice and potato salad. I drizzled some sauce over the kabobs as well as the rice for gravy. The kabobs went so fast! The fresh super sweet juicy pineapples also helped to make this kabobs as well. I served this with rice and, "Herbed Corn," also from this website. This is worth making again!

So simple and good.  Great first kabob for kids.  We used canned pineapple and the glaze from the Kielbasa Apple Kabobs recipe on this site (as we made both).  Excellent!

Cooked it on the grill and used fresh pineapple and I thought it was fabulous.  Something diffent for a change.  I also did not put on the glaze until the last few minutes due to the warnings of others.

This was a hit with my family (and boyfriend)! I found the ham to be a bit dry - my mom suggested soaking it in ginger ale the night before to make it moister. I am thinking about making extra glaze next time to put on the rice because it was so good!

No one (me, husband and kids-17 and 9) liked this recipe much, but we ate it.  I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was too sweet.  So, I added some soy sauce (a reviewer suggestion) to the white rice I had served with it and the combination was not good.  Won't make this one again.

This was DELICIOUS & sooo simple!!!  I doubled the sauce & added soy sauce & 1 minced garlic clove.  After cubing the ham I marinated it for 30".  I kept basting it after turning the skewers. The family loved it!!!  You know how it takes to time to thread skewers & you only get tidbits of ham & pineapple; I would love to throw a whole ham & pineapple on the grill with the sauce & chow down!!! :)  THANKS LINDSAY!!!

When I don't have time to put on the sticks and watch it on the grill, or just don't feel like taking the time, I fry up the ham and add the pineapple and all other items in a large pan, while making the rice. When ready, I put the rice on the bottom and top it with the ham/pineapple mix. Taste just the same and less time. I still like to put it on the stick when we are having company. Makes it look good.

This was simple, and really good; everyone in the family actually liked it!  I used turkey ham (since we don't eat ham) and I added some colored peppers to the kabobs.  It went perfect with rice and a Chinese veggie stir fry.  I feel like the next time I make it I might add something else to the sauce (which I doubled)--something to thicken it up just a little bit, maybe?  I'd like more of a 'glaze'.  Also, I ended up having to put them in the oven--400, for fifteen minutes on each side, was perfect--I added sauce at the first flip, and then right before I pulled them out.

Excellent!!  Definitely worth a five star rating!  Made as directed but doubled everything except the pineapple. These cooked up perfectly on the grill.  Used Kentucky Legend ham which was just delicious.  The ham and pineapple caramelized suprisingly well.  A hot grill is a must!  Will make these again and again. Thanks for the recipe!

Everyone in my family loved it, even the 2 yr. old! I would, however, say, grilling it on high heat makes the sauce burn on the meat. I think if I did it again I would grill it on a lower heat, so that the sauce caramelizes more. I also think that you could easily add some bell peppers to this, too.

We really enjoyed these...I did add a little soy sauce to the marinade and brushed the kabobs the last few minutes to avoid burning.  Adding chunks of red onion and bell pepper to the kabob adds taste and crunchiness.  Don't forget to soak wooden skewers!

The timing of this recipe in the daily email was great. Whole, fresh pineapples were $3 off at Kroger--just $.99! I made this and it was easy and likable.  I read comments, added a dash of soy sauce.  While certainly likable, it was one-note.  I think the basting sauce needs some fresh chili pepper, ginger, or citrus to give it depth.  I think this would be a great recipe for picky kids as is.  Of note, I served with a kale salad and Minute Rice brand multi-grain medley to give it a nutritional boost.

Excellent! We used fresh pineapple and added onions and bell peppers, served over couscous. Next time we'll marinate in the sauce for a couple hours so flavors blend more, but it was really good as it was.

Super awesome and super simple (I bought a "chunk" of John Martin ham and cubed it in advance & bought pre-cubed pineapple from the produce section in out grocery store because I hate cutting pineapple.  And I'm lazy.)!  I realized as I was prepping food/the grill for Mr. LTH to arrive/grill we were out of skewers, so mr. LTH grilled these in a grill basket instead.  Mr. LTH was a bit lax on the basting, but they were still outstanding.  Mr. LTH isn't a big fan of vinegar, so I was worried he wouldn't be a fan, but he never even noticed it was there!  This will be a "repeater" in the LTH house.  THANKS for the recipe, Lindsay Perejma!

I didn't actually use the glaze in the recipe because I was in a major time pinch.  I had some teriyaki glaze in the fridge and used that and it turned out great.  I intend on using the full recipe at a later date, but I know it will be just as good if not better.  Super easy to throw together.  I let the kids, even the very young ones, help make dinner and they loved eating the kabobs.  We ran out in no time, next time I will make twice as many.

This was easy.  It was a rainy today so took the suggestion of putting it under the broiler. Will use the grill next time and double the sauce.

These were good!  I thought the glaze would have a little more taste to it but it really wasn't bad at all!  I think I'll add a little more brown sugar next time.  I will be making again.

This is a VERY good recipe! It's best served with long grain white basmati rice covered in butter. At first I was a little worried about the glaze but it is really good and I actually double the glazing now for more flavor! Very yummy and easy to grill! I have found by making this several times that grilling them on high for a shorter amount of time renders less savory flavor than on a lower temperature for a longer amount of time does so i would suggest grilling on a lower temperature for a longer time. it's definitely worth it!

Everyone loved this recipe.  I did make some changes.  I cubed some pork and let it marinade over night in the sauce. I did not marinade the pineapple, but I did bast it while it was cooking just like the recipes says.  This recipe is a keeper!!  Thanks!!

I altered this a little, so I don't know how helpful this review will be.  I did not grill the kabobs, pan fried them instead.  I used the honey ham glaze from this site.  The kids liked them, thank you for a great idea.

This was a great recipe to use with leftover Sunday dinner ham.  It was raining so I actually put them under the broiler.  The flavor was good - but, I definitely think it would be better grilled as the recipe states.  Next time I will marinate them before grilling instead of just basting them to get a stronger flavor.

This was awesome! I added about a teaspoon of ground cloves, and marinated ham and pineapple over night. Tasted just like baked ham, but the flavor was all the way through not just on the top.
Used the Forman grill, was fast and didn't heat up the kitchen WOO HOO baked ham in the summertime!

I made this for Easter dinner (wanted ham but don't really care for the traditional way) and it was a big hit!  I doubled the recipe and marinaded the ham in the mixture for about 4 hours ahead of time.  Served over brown rice and it was a great light meal.  thanks!!

The only thing I should have changed about this recipe is the serving size....I should have made A LOT more!!!  Wow!  This is wonderful!!!  My picky 5 year old thought putting together his own skewer was lots of fun and even ate two skewers!!  I think we'll be making and eating these often!

This was really delicious! I doubled the sauce and used marachino cherries and a bit of pineapple juice and let it marinate. I used thick cut ham steaks from Sam's Club and cut them in cubes, not salty at all. Get a good quality ham to use. We really liked this! Thanks!

Extremely kid friendly!  Something about pieces of meat on a stick that make kids want to sit down to dinner. I used John Morrell ham chuncks and left off the pineapple,they were gone in seconds.  For dh, I left off the brown sugar for his low carb and he enjoyed as well!  I will be making this again!  Its wonderful for a quick dinner!  Gotta love those indoor grills.

I made this for tailgating at a football game and it turned out to be a big hit.  All that I made dissappeared quickly, I didn’t make enough.  it’s very easy to make and the sauce adds a great flavor to it.  Highly recommend this!

Mixed reviews from my family.....  All kids happily ate it, including the son who usually rejects any type of cooked pineapple.  But the hubby didn't like it, and the marinade wasn't  what I expected given the positive reviews.  Oh well.

I made it, whole family ate it, will make again.  I didn't measure out ingredients for glaze, and I used balsamic vinegar and olive oil instead of white and vegetable. I also cooked on George Foreman Grill because that's all I have.  But they were delicious and simple to make.

Two thumbs up! My kids and neighbor kids loved these "ham sticks"! I will double the sauce next time. I broiled them in the oven and served it with stuffing for extra flavor on the plate. We'll definitely be having these again!

Fabulous!  Easy and delicious.  I used the glaze on a full round and did it in the oven, and it was very tasty!

Yes, I would make it again.  I added soy sauce and used Dijon as some had suggested.  I also broiled instead of grilling since I didn't have big chunks of ham and didn't want to mess around with skewers.  I would have wanted more glaze for basting  since the recipe didn't make a lot.  Had it with brown rice.  Yum

These kabobs were really good. I also added a little sweet onion and, to give it colour, I added yellow and red sweet peppers to the kabobs as well. Served them over rice and they were well received by my guest.

I had ham I needed to use and a fresh pineapple, but it wasn't a good day to fire up the grill. I mixed everything up and let it soak for a bit Then drained the ham and pineapple but saved the sauce. I grilled in small batches that I had on a hot dry grill to get the crispy brown. It totally worked., and was delicious on a bed of rice with the extra sauce poured over.  My husband doesn't even like ham and he enjoyed this. :)

Delicious even my non-pineapple Kiddo's had seconds. The grill wouldn't fire up so we cooked these in the oven on a high broil and they came out beautifully. I used fresh pineapple and tripled the sauce. Awesome thank you for sharing!

Awesome.  Didn't change a thing.  I did marinate sliced pineapple in the mixture for a day before Thanksgiving last year.  Grilled it on Thanksgiving and served along side our ham.

Simple to make, but, oh so delicious!  I found a package of ham in the freezer and had just bought a fresh pineapple.  I made this as written, with the exception of the fresh, rather than canned pineapple.  Along with the kabobs, I made a few skewers with onions and peppers to go with this and used the marinade on those, too.  We really enjoyed this, and I know it is a meal I will be preparing again.  Served it alongside 'Toss-Together Broccoli Salad' from AR.

DELICIOUS!!!!! I marinated the left over ham we had from Easter lunch and put it on skewers with fresh pineapple chunks and also some mushrooms that needed to be used up. I had tripled the recipe, went easy on brown sugar though to not make it to sweet, also added soy sauce as one reviewer mentioned to do. I used double the recipe for marinating and the last third I kept in fridge for hubby to brush on in the last 5 minutes on the grill. We couldn't get enough of this!!! It is worth 10 stars!!!! Definitely a keeper!!!!!! I will try this next time on those ham steaks as other reviewers have recommended!

yummmm. grey poupon mustard ended up being a suprisingly good twist for the taste, but probably isnt necessary. And i went a bit lighter on the vinegar, a bit more on the brown sugar. was great!

Not a hit. The ham was dry, and we really couldn't taste the glaze at all. This would need a lot of tweaking to make it work for us.

Good! I added halved strawberries to the kabobs and a cinnamon chipolte seasoning to spice things up a bit. Next time I'll make extra sauce and drizzle it over the kabobs and rice.

Very yummy and super easy to make.  We've made them 4 or 5 times now and love them on the barbecue or cooked stovetop (when weather not conducive to outdoor grilling). Thanks for a great keeper!

This marinade gives the ham a smoky rich flavor that's wonderful.  These are so easy to prepare using canned or fresh pineapple.  They also cook easily on the grill, and you don't have to worry about the meat not cooking all of the way.  My family and friends loved the bits of ham that got a little well-done yummy.

These are wonderful over the camp fire. I also add green pepper chunks and canned potatoes. Recently it rained on the evening I had planned these on the fire so I bake them at 350 for 1 hour in a casserole, thickened the sauce and served over rice with green beans. Excellant! Kids love this!

These were really good, and easy to make.  I'll definitely serve them again but might experiment some more, maybe marinating it first or doubling the sauce to thicken and mix with the rice.

I sliced the ham and grilled it that way, instead of making kabobs.  My husband loves it!  Says he could eat ham every day if we grilled it like this and used the sweet and sour sauce.  He wants to put the whole Easter ham on the grill next year!

This marinade was so simple and so delicious.  I will probably try this sauce on some pork chops.  I feed this to my family and my grandparents and they all thought it was very good.  I used leftover ham and cut it up.  I wanted to try ham in a different way.

I was somewhat hesitant to put the glaze on but i generously dosed it on and boy was it good! it tastes exactly like the honey glaze on honey baked hams believe it or not. However, the food itself was somewhat plain- like it needed something more on the kabob to make it finished- it just didn't seem like it was finished. Good served with seasoned wild rice.

This was OK... doubt I would fix it again on the grill, maybe bake it in the sauce to see if it held more of the flavor.

Made this for about 10 people while camping.  I made a much bigger batch than the recipe calls for, and they all got eaten, though by the end people were starting to slow down a little.  At first though, people couldn't get enough of them!  

I marinated the ham and pineapple pieces all day, and then put the kabobs together right before grilling.

I also added just a bit of worcestershire suace and maybe half a clove of garlic finely minced.  I also substituted cranberry mustard for some of the regular.  

Yummy!

These are AWESOME!!! I marinate mine for a couple hours first and it makes a lot of difference. Use good ham - tried once with so-so ham and wasn't nearly as tasty! Thanks for the recipe!!!

It was OK, but not as impressive as the other recipes I've tried lately.
