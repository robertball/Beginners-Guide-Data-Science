BIG hit with everyone.  Here's how I made them.  First of all, that 'S' shape looked like a pain to make, so I took a melon ball/ice cream scoop, a very small one and using a level scoop, plopped them on the baking pans.  Then, using the bottom of a glass, dusted in a little powdered sugar, squashed them flat, to about 1/4".  When they were baking, I melted white chocolate and kept it warm.  When the cookies were room temp, after baking, I spread the bottoms with white chocolate and put two halves together (like an Oreo).
Then dusted the final cookies with the powdered sugar by sifting it with a fine mesh strainer.  I know this is a far cry from any Greek type cookie, but these were really delicious, my husband's new favorites.  Oh and I made them later using raspberry seedless jam on one side, and white chocolate on the other half, then put the two halves together, those are his new favorites.  I used good chocolate, Lindt.  Excellent recipe.  I double the amount of vanilla and almond extract that the original recipe calls for by the way.

This is one of the best cookies I have ever made.  The dough could not have been simpler to make.  I made 4 different variations with the finished dough: a traditional round rolled in powdered sugar, a crescent shape with half dipped in chocolate,rounds sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar and little 'log' shaped dipped in chocolate then rolled in crushed walnuts.  They were all fantastic!

Overall I was very pleased with this recipe which I took to an Olympic Greek party.  However, quite a lot of my cookies burnt on the bottom.  I would probably add a tiny bit more almond extract next time as that gave a lovely flavour to the cookies.  I found the most effective way to roll the dough in to "s" shapes was to dust my hands with confectioners' sugar so it didn't stick to my fingers.

I helped my 12 year old son make these for a school project.  The flavor was good, but not sweet.  I really liked them, but my son didn't.  However, when he took them to school, all of his classmates loved them.  I think a really good, easy recipe.  They are a little difficult to shape before baking.  Otherwise excellent.

Easy, quick and oh-so-delicious!  Everyone loved these.  To make them a little more tender, I only used 2 1/4 cups of flour.

Enjoy!

This recipe has been in my family for many years! We're not Greek and we had no idea this was a Greek recipe. We chill the dough in balls and roll it out thin, then cut it into shapes with cookie cutters and decorate with Christmas decorations. The best sugar cookies ever.

YUMMY!!!! "Take 'em out to share with the neighbors" good. I've had cookies like this recipe that involve stuffing the cookies with pitted dates; looking for that recipe was what brought me to this one. I didn't wait for my cookies to cool completely before rolling them in the powdered sugar, no harm done. Those little cookies positively melt in your mouth when they're still hot from the oven.:)

I made these just to try and see if they were like some Greek Wedding Cookies I had at a restaurant and they were just as good, if not better. I did an experiment though. I made three kinds, one exactly as the recipe said, one with chopped walnuts incorporated throughout the mix, and one batch just rolled in walnuts with the powdered sugar on top. The best ones had walnuts. The others tasted just ok. ENJOY!

They are not so bad. Very similar to other short bread cookies. very light on the sugar, which I like! I think next time, I will add a bit more almond extract for more flavor.

Let me preface this by writing that making these cookies was also the first time that I had ever eaten a Greek Butter Cookie.  On that note, I am only going on what tasted good to me, not how this recipe compares with other Greek Butter cookie recipes.  At first I thought that the cookies had too strong of an Almond flavor.  They also came out rather soft.  After a couple of days, they dried out and had a crispier taste.  In the past five days, I have eaten about TWO dozen of these cookies.  Do make sure that you properly cream the butter and sugar.  Use your mixer at medium-high and cream the butter and sugar together until it lightens almost until a vanilla color.  The mixture should develop ridges from the mixer and form into peaks.  Stop at this time and Don't over beat.  Continue and enjoy!

I just finished a batch and I can't stop eating them, I made some tea to have with them, but ate 3 before the water boiled.  I added a little more almond essence because mine was really old.  The prep time is much longer than 10min because of the S shapes, which weren't as hard as many suggested, just have to work fast and would help if these were made on a cooler day with cool hands. In saying so I have hot hands all the time and they still turned out awesome.  Cook time is definitely 10 min per tray, I ended up with 3 = 30min all together.  Used a non-stick cookie pan and didn't grease it, looked like there was enough butter in the recipe and they didn't stick. Used baking paper on a normal cookie sheet and they were fine too.  They have a great light crisp texture for me, will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing.

Good recipe. It is very simple, doesn't need a lot of ingredients. I definitely wouldn't bake it on 400 degrees again - the bottom of the cookies were too brown and the cookies were too dry. Try 350, for probably 13-14 minutes. Otherwise, the cookies are tasty, if simple - they actually taste better a day or two later.

These cookies are one of my favorite cookies in the world. It is very simple to make and it is fun to twist the dough in many different shapes to match the occasion. I was looking for something for my roman banquet in school so we baked over 200 of these cookies and there were only about 50 left that were then shared with my class that i kept seeing going up to get more. I love this cookie because it is not dry at all and it contains a simple cookie flavor that you can top with almost about everything. I just now became a member to let everyone know how good these cookies are. PLEASE SAVE THIS RECIPEEEEEEE!!

Great, simple recipe!  I listened to other reviewers and doubled the almond extract and my cookies turned out flavorful without being overpowering.  I did the "s" shape, and while it was easy to do I'll just use a cookie scoop next time and stamp them to make a pretty design.  My batch "spread" more than the cookies in the photos, so I think I skimped on the flour, but they weren't totally flat and they still tasted wonderful!  I loved the buttery taste and the slightly crisp edges.  I will definitely make these again!

This is an extremely easy cookie to make! Crunchy like a shortbread, yet when you eat it melts in your mouth. I agree with the others when you should double the vanilla and almond flavors. When rolling out the dough, I suggest 'flouring' hands with the confectioners sugar after making every "S" cookie. this makes it super easy to roll. I was surpised how easy it was to make the S shape.  I got 23 cookies out of this batch since I made them a bit bigger. Excellent recipe, will definately use again!

Just like Yaiya used to make!!  Soft and tender with a delicate buttery taste.  I also reduced oven temp to 350 for 11min.  I didn't have almond extract, so doubled up on the vanilla.  I plan on dipping in melted choc and chopped almonds (as another user posted) - if there are any left!  (I keep eating them!!).  Great recipe and easy with ingredients on hand.

Awesome cookies! I'm taking to my Greek friend's Christmas party today and I'm SO proud!! I used a cookie press to make snowflakes and Christmas tree shapes and it was SO easy. While still warm, I dipped the tops in a cinnamon and sugar mix and they looked like they came from a bakery. Taste great, super easy...will make great gifts wrapped in pretty Christmas bags! Thanks so much!!!

Scrumptious!  One of the best butter cookies, the almond flavor is not overpowering and the recipe is as basic and easy as can be.  Don't change a thing.  They are fabulous exactly as posted.

Very easy to make, exceptional flavor, fun! I made these for a cookie exchange because I was looking for something different, and homey- I was not disappointed. I rolled out my dough into little snakes and then twisted them together and formed into crescents before baking- sprinkled with powdered sugar they were beautiful! I also experimented with doing "thumbprint" cookies and then sprinkling those with white sugar and bruleeing the top. Very tasty, although slightly less pretty.

I made these for my boyfriend's best friend for his birthday. The "S" shape was surprisingly easy to make. When I made them I dipped them in white chocolate and sprinkled coconut on them. They were amazing.

Perfect!  Only upset I didn't triple the batter and will have to remake it again so sooner than later.  I added a little more almond extract only bc it ran over the measuring spoon, but I also saw that as a few recommendations.  Perfect!  I made mine in TBSP size balls and they were fabulous!

These were actually pretty disappointing. I am not sure where I went wrong. I followed the recipe precisely, but they just spread out all over the cookie pan when they baked. Didn't hold shape. And really, for all that, didn't taste much different to me than many other cmas cookies. I can't give them less than a 3 stars because it's probably my fault they didn't turn out.

Very good tea cookie. The trick is to keep them small. Larger balls (bigger than 3/4" diameter) tended to spread out into a lumpy odd shaped cookie. Still tasty, just odd looking. I added an extra 1/8 tsp. of almond flavour an extra 3 tbsp of flour and chilled the dough for 2 hours. They came out very tasty. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

I just made these and I'm really impressed with it. It kind of reminds me of the Dutch boterkoek recipe in my family, so it was easy to follow along.  took the advice of the other reviews and put 1 teaspoon instead of half a teaspoon of almond extract. later on they had cooled a bit I melted some seieet ocolachips in a small sauce pan and dipped one end of the cookies into it, then i added sixcubs o white choolate to  uncleaned cclate pan to make a lighter chocolate drizzl, aitle coffeee cream to make the chocolate thinner, then i drizzled stripes over the dipped cookies, they taste very yummy.

I've made this recipe numerous times since finding it in Dec. 2008. It's really great.  The ONLY thing I do differently is to triple the almond. The S shape is not difficult to make and really creates a delicate and lovely cookie. Friends are wowed over them and my husband and kids ask for it all the time.  (Our 9 and 7 year old kids make them into the lovely S shape!)

These came out delicious. I doubled the amount of almond and vanilla extract after reading others' reviews. The "S" shapes were easy to make but most of them did not bake with the design clearly visible. If the dough gets sticky while you are rolling it with your hands, just wash or wipe off your hands and you're good for another 15 or so cookies.

I found this dough too sticky and soft to work with, even after refrigerating. Also, at 400 degrees, the first batch was scorched! These came out nice in the end, but not spectacular.

We have baked these cookies for years.  We call then "Pecan Dreams" because chopeed pecans are put in the dough and then we roll them in tsp. fulls and stick a half pecan in middle and roll it into the cookie.  We put them in the powdered sugar right ways.  Wonderful!

The cookie was pretty good. I didn't have almond extract on hand so I used Anise extract instead. Probably I will put a full Teaspoon though just for some more flavor. Also I read that a few reviews said that the dough was sticky and hard to shape. I suggest putting the dough in the freezer a few minutes to chill it. Another review suggested dipping half the cookie in melted chocolate, YUM!

These were very good.  I used half the dough and shaped them into S's.  This was a little bit difficult, but they turned out OK. I then sprinkled them with crushed candy canes.  The other half, I made into raspberry thumbprint cookies - rolled into balls, made an indentation with the tip of a wooden spoon, filled with just a dab of raspberry jam.  Very versatile and easy to immediately after preparing the dough.  They would be nice with hershey kisses, dipped in chocolate, sprinkles... the possibilities are endless.

These cookies are the kind you can't stop eating. I froze mine as soon as they cooled so there would be some left for Christmas. The dough is sticky so make sure you put alot of Confectionery sugar on your hands when working with it. I put 1 tsp. of Almond extract and baked them at 375 degrees for 13 min. I sprinkled them, when still warm, with red and green sugar for the holidays and also mixed sugar and cinnamon together and sprinkled that on some. I am definitely making another batch before Christmas. I only made the ball cookies because the dough is hard to work with. I did try dipping some in chocolate but thought it took away from the flavor of the cookie. Thanks for a great recipe. 12/7/09 Just made them for this year, I was able to make the S shape this year(don't know why I couldn't do it last year) anyway, I made the S shapes put them on the cookie sheet and sprinkled some with green and red sugar before baking, I left some plain, baked and when cooled sprinkled with confectionery sugar. The rest I made into ball and rolled in a cinnamon/sugar mixture before baking. Love these cookies.

Awesome!  I made them into the 'S' shapes - how fun!  I didn't have any vanilla on hand, so I used all almond extract (1 tsp) plus another 1/2 tsp (which is all that was left in the bottle).  Very easy and quick and very yummy!  Mine baked up perfect at 10 minutes on my insulated sheet.

Very good cookie- almost like a Sweedish Melting Moment or Heirloom Cookie.  Definately needs more almond extract like other reviewers said.  I dropped the oven temp because my oven cooks hot in the first place, but I went to 350 and still a 10 minute cook time- the cookies do not need to be browned to be cooked through.  Over all though, a great cookie- you could really do anythign with them- frost, glaze, sugar sprinkles, etc.

I made these cookies for my 3rd Grade son to bring to school for an International Fair.  They got rave reviews from everyone who tried them.  My family now loves them, and even though we are not Greek, they have now become a favorite dessert in our family.

These cookies taste great and are EXTREMELY easy to make using ingredients you probably already have.  I brought them to a Greek Christmas party.  Would be great dipped in chocolate as the previous reviewer suggested.  The perfect "plain cookie" that can be dressed up any way you like.  Warning:  Not low-fat! :)

this is an excellent recipe. These cookies are really good. the only thing i would add is that you have to becareful of how much egg and butter you use or you have to use alot of flour to get it to a good consistency for kneading. Also too i flattened mine with a fork for a neat little design. These cookies are a hit with my family. Thanks for sharing.

These were terrific.  I followed the recipe and they came out perfectly.  The entire family loved them.  The only thing I did was flatten them down a bit on the cookie pan before I baked them.  I also bought some sprinkles and red sugar crystals and my 4 year old had a blast decorating them.

Thanks so much for this recipe!  When I offered them up at Christmas/Hannukah, someone in my family asked me, "What does a Jewish girl know about making Greek butter cookies?"  Well, thanks to you, I now know a lot!

Yummy cookie.  Only problem I had was that the cookies spread when they baked.  I did increase the extracts to 2 teaspoons each.  I will be making again but adjusting the recipe a little.  Stay tuned.

Followed the recipe to what it said. Was not a fan.  If I did make these again I would add more flour and almond  extract.  I like butter cookies but these were way to bland.

Good flavor. I think I may have baked them a tad too long because they were a bit harder than I would have liked. When I bake them again I will shorten the time in the oven.

The cookies were so good and so easy to make.  Though my first batch of cookies came out so dark in the bottom almost burnt. Second batch came out just fine.  I know better so I just lowered my oven temp to 300 F.  Will be making it again. Thanks.

Not sure what about this was Greek other than the shape they suggested which is one of the ways Greeks shape their cookies. I am 100% Greek and thought I give this a try, seeing as it was different then any other Greek recipe I have made before.  With that said, this cookie was delicious.  Quick and easy.  Borders somewhere between a sugar cookie and a shortbread cookie.  A simple homemade cookie to make in a snap. Cookie hardens a bit as it cools and turned harder when totally cooled off. I can see dipping this into chocolate or putting nuts on it, really the possibilities are endless  I had a difficult time making this into shapes and scooped up some into a ball and slightly flattened it out. I'm going to cut the flour down a bit my next try but I see myself adding this to my regular cookie holiday baking and one recipe I will use in between to just have for those who stops over for coffee.

These cookies aren't to be sweet. They're a mild tasting cookie, not to be iced.  I've made them throughout the year,especially for Easter. Some recipes vary and add a bit of orange zest. Delicious.

I followed the recipe as written and agree that they are a bit bland. I tasted the dough (fortunately) and it was very very bland so added about 1/2 tsp salt and that made it better.  These are good, basic and the dough was easy to work with and actually was easier to work with at room temp. I refrigerated it first and found it easier to work with once it was at room temp. I'd double the vanilla and almond but very good basic cookie. 400 degrees for 9 minutes was good in my oven on silpat lined sheets.

Very, very plain and I added the zest of a lemon to the batter because I had it around. Also they spread and so didn't look very good either. Dough was very difficult to work with. I am going to go with a butter cookie that has a little more flavor and some baking powder next time!

Yum! These are great, not too sweet, and they have a great flavor. I'm having them with my breakfast tea.   The S shape is easy to do, and kinda fun too. We've already made 2 batches, I hope there are some left over to give out for the holidays...

The only change I made was adding an additional 1/2 tsp. of almond extract.  The dough was easy to work with and I made them into an "S" shape.  I baked them about 12 minutes and after they cooled I sifted powdered sugar on them.  They are delicious  --  very delicate flavor.  Thank you for this recipe.

We didn't alter a thing.  This recipe is simple, quick AND delicious. My Canadian Greek friend, Maria, will be upset because these cookies taste exactly like hers.  I made them for the neighborhood kids and then taught them how to make their own. They were highly impressed with this recipe and the fact that they too could make it.  Thank you!

These were so yummy. I upped the almond extract to a teaspoon and I think they were perfect. Crisp and sweet and so good with the powdered sugar- and hot tea. These were a hit at my husband's work cookie swap.

These are so easy and so tasty!  When I made these a second time I piped a line of melted chocolate down the middle of each cookie stick and sprinkled the chocolate with crushed hazelnuts - GREAT.  My next plan is to use white chocolate and crushed pistachios.

These are very good.  I made them for a cookie swap and everyone loved them.  The leftovers at my house will not last long for sure!  I did take other reviewers advice and increased the almond and vanilla extracts to 1 tsp each.  I think the almond extract really makes the cookie taste great.  Will definitely keep this one!

Super easy, great flavor.  I'm only giving it 4 stars because it was impossible to shape them, and I really wanted a cute shaped cookie, but the dough was impossibly sticky to shape into the "s", so I ended up rolling the dough into small balls and pressing them with a cup, like sugar cookies.  I dusted them with cocoa and powdered sugar and the flavor - esp the hint of almond - is delish :) I only baked them for 5 mins, though, and the bottoms were beginning to brown, so definitely keep an eye on these while they bake.  Next time, I'll try a honey glaze on top!

These cookies are amazing! I also added more almond extract as well as a bit more flour to make the dough more manageable to work with. I made the "S" shapes with no problem at all and they came out adorable. After the ccokies cooled, I just simply sprinkled on powdered sugar. They taste even better the next day. Really easy and delicious- can't wait to share them at Christmas!

I made these a few weeks ago with my daughter to see if this would be a good recipe for an upcoming school project. The only thing we didn't have, was almond extract. I didn't care for the cookies, but my daughter did so we decided to keep this recipe when it came time.
The cultural fair is tomorrow and we baked about 60 of these, this time using the almond extract. Oh my gosh what a difference. We all loved them (the family). It was really hard not eating the ones for tomorrow lol. I'm not sure what they'll think of them tomorrow, but we really liked them! Oh...it was impossible to make the "S" shape for the dough was way to sticky. We just put small teaspoonfulls on the cookie sheets, and they came out great. Thank you!

these are refreshingly good after so much chocolate chip cookies.  i was expecting a "melt in your mouth" like someone stated, but i guess she wasn't being literal.  i took them out at 10 minutes and the center looked a little unbaked so, i baked them for a couple more minutes and they were just right.  also, the batch gave me a little less than 6 dozens.

Yum~!~!~!
I made these about 4 months ago for my daughter’s class during a Greek festival she had - They were a HIT!!  Then I made a second batch the following day for our family to enjoy.  
My kids are STILL asking me to make these for them. They are simple AND delicious!

I had no idea what to expect from this cookie, but the reviews here convinced me to try it.  Definitely a wonderful butter cookie with a delicate taste.  The dough held its shape beautifully.  I did shape it into "S" by using a small backin "ice cream scoop" usually used to make melon balls.  But this allowed me to get a consistent amount of dough for each cookie.  Then I simply rubbed the ball between my palms into about a 3" rope then shaped into an S on the cookie sheet.  I didn't grease my cookie sheets, but I did use parchmant paper.  A much easier clean up!  I think at Christmas I'll put red or green food coloring into the dough.  You know-- S for Santa!  I think they'd look pretty with the powdered sugar sprinkled over them.  A nice addition to the Christmas cookie tray.

My best friend growing up was Greek and her mom made these all the time.  Ive ten said id like to try to make them so finally decided to search for recipes.  My friend hasn't ever actually made them!  I tried this and made in traditions twisted 's' shape as her mom did.  They ended up being just like hers and served them to other friends who've also had hers.  Got good reviews. Wish id tried to make sooner.  king another batch today as they're all gone!  love with a cup of tea.

These cookies are delicious. I did make a change. I used 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of cake batter extract instead of almond extract and baked them at 325 degrees.  I made them for a school project but will definitely make them again for my family.

I do think I will make it again. I made them for a school project and they were really easy to make. I do think that it needs a bit more flavor.

Delicious! I used a couple of suggestions, such as use powdered sugar to coat your hands to roll dough. PERFECT rolling! I also added a smidge more of both almond and vanilla extracts and YUMMMM! They were simple to make and quick to pull together. I usually refrigerate cookie dough when I bake, but this worked perfectly without that step. Thank you SO much for the recipe! I made it in honor of the play Mamma Mia for their opening night party tonight!

I made this cookies and followed the recipe, but added 1/8 tsp. additional almond extract.  I rolled into small logs and baked on parchment paper, 14 minutes at 350 degrees.  The cookies were perfectly baked and did spread a bit to make a nice bite size cookie.  I wanted a softer cookie, not crispy, so that's why I reduced the oven temperature.  Cooled for  few hours and dusted with powdered sugar - delicious!  Making these for a Girl Scout  event about Greece- they will surely be a hit!

Oh. My. Stars. This is my new favorite cookie. I followed the recipe word for word. I was worried for little bit because my dough wouldn't hold together well. But after kneading it with my hands for a minute it was perfect! The "s" shape was super easy. If you made a snake out of playdough when you were a kid you can do this. I even like them without the powder sugar but it does make it look so very pretty. 10/5 stars

Something was missing... As having Greek heritage they didn’t taste like they should. I found a much better recipe that called for orange juice.

These are really crunchy. Great for afternoon tea. 
I made them round, and for the kids I dipped them half in melted chocolate and added some sprinkles. It was a hit. I am making them again only two days later

I was given this recipe from a friend who asked that I bake them for him. This recipe is very similar to a russian tea cake cookie recipe. I did not shape these cookies into an "S" but rather used my 1 tbsp cookie scoop and rolled the cookies into a ball. Immediately upon removing these cookies from the oven, I rolled the cookies in powdered sugar and I will roll them again, once cooled, before storing in an airtight tin with wax paper (the best way I know to store a cookie and have it last for months at room temperature). I did toast and crush 1 cup of almonds and added it to the batter at the very end.  From start to finish, I used my stand mixer for this recipe. I did beat the butter alone first to get it to a nice smooth consistency and then added the granulated sugar and then the egg. I mixed this at least 8 minutes before adding the flour. I removed the cookies promptly at 10 minutes and while they seemed too soft, they firmed up as they cooled. I'm not sure if this is going to meet with my friends approval but I sure do like them! Thank you for a cookie recipe that, based on some of the reviews, is quite versatile.

These cookies tasted great and was easy to make. I made the recipe exactly as it was written. The key to making the dough easy to work with is chill it prior to making shapes.

Baked at 375 for 10 min bkz I was nervous about burning them. I switched one egg for 2 egg yolks because that's what my Greek cookbook listed. These made about 3 doz in a crescent shape or 45 if you shape them into little balls.  If you decide to double, make each batch separately because it would be too hard to mix all the flour in one bowl. Putting the powdered sugar liberally over everything at the end, then each in a cupcake liner makes a beautiful presentation.

This cookie has become a holiday tradition at my house.  I made it using red food coloring on half the dough, twisted red and regular dough together to make Christmas candy cane cookies.  They are very popular.  This is the best cookie recipe in my collection.

These were AMAZING  and super easy to make. I couldn't  make the S shape, so I put the  dough in a freezer bag and cut a hole in one end. So, the cookies ended up being perfectly round and yummy.

They are easy to make and very, very tasty. I added 1/2 tsp of cocunut oil and it has only a little hint of coconut flavor. Definitely make it again. Thanks for sharing.

Good cookie, not too sweet.  These would do well with some of the "dunking" (chocolate, white chocolate, etc) done by others.  I made them to go with our Greek gyro meal. Looking forward to having a couple with coffee in the morning.  My 1 year old loves them.

These are fantastic! I followed the recipe almost exactly (only thing I did differently was add a bit more almond extract because I love the almond flavor) and they are melt in the mouth amazing!
Tip- if yours are burning on the bottom, try using parchment paper instead of greasing the pan.
Thank you for the amazing recipe!

Oh My Lord! These were so delicious! These cookies were so good. I made these on a rainy to cheer everyone up in the house and everyone was very impressed. Though I did tweak a few things to fit my needs I didn't have butter so I used Crisco and I added more almond extract than needed and they came out beautifully. I do wonder how they made their cookies into that beautiful swirl because mine were more of a ball shape. Anyways it didn't made how it looked I loved these cookies so much!

I helped my daughter make these for a school project. They were easy, required few ingredients, and turned out perfect. Crisp, buttery, and delicious! We will definitely be making them again.

Had to make a dish/ dessert for a school project that originated from Europe. Made these for my class two or three years ago and they were a hide hit! My sister is now in my class and begged me to find this recipe again! Definitely five stars!

Really delicious, quick, and simple! The only change I made was to substitute orange extract for the almond, just my personal preference, I'm sure they would be good either way. I also made them round instead of the s shape, then dipped half of each cookie in melted chocolate and sprinkles. Very delicious that way, but they are also really good just plain if you're looking for something less sweet. I will definitely be making these again!

Love the cookies except next time I am going to use more almond extract and reduce the vanilla. The powdered sugar is a must to bring just right kind of sweetness it needs.

The cookies were really good, but a little bland. My first batch also burnt on the bottom. I cooked my second batch at 350 degrees for 15 minutes and they turned out fine. I found a nice way to increase the buttery flavor is to brush them with melted butter halfway through the cooking process.

Very simple and yummy! I used 1.5 tsp of vanilla and .5 of almond, but next time I think I will use less almond extract. I piped the dough through a sandwich bag and made simple fingers.

Super fab just out of the oven- I did balls using a tablespoon b/c I don't have cookie cutter (will invest!). 

They are OK left over- got pretty hard. Thus, why I can see why people rave about using these for xmas- or other hard/decorated cookies. Great for that, for sure!

These cookies were very good, and my whole family enjoyed them! I didn't love how doughy they were, but the rest of my family did. I also made a little change- instead of rolling them in confectioner's suger, I rolled them in a blend of cinnamon and suger. Also, I doubled the vanilla extract and left the almond extract in the cupboard. Over all, wonderful cookies.

This is my idea of the perfect cookie. They are sweet but not too sweet. The recipe yields a lot of cookies but they will go quickly.

i LOVE these cookies, though i did read the reviews and added the mace, and white pepper, the first time i made them i left out the cardamom. After making another batch, i must say that i prefer them without it.  Also, you might have to adjust the flour to 3 cups.  I have made these quite a few times, it is the easiest cookie recipe to make. Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

I made these cookies today...they tasted totally delicious and may be the best butter cookie I've tasted yet.  Although, I made minor changes to this recipe, I still gave it 5 stars because of the taste - they taste delicious (as my 3 year old son put it).  After reading through some of the other comments & suggestions for this recipe, I added an additional 1 1/2 tablespoons each of vanilla & almond extract, and added ground pecans (as much or as little as you prefer).  With that said this is a staple in my kitchen.    One thing I must mention is that even with refrigerating the dough for 1 hour; the dough was still too soft to form the S.  I then put the dough in my cookie press and they came out wonderful w/ lowering the oven temperature to 350 @ 8 mins.  Godgifu - thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

So easy & now a family favorite ! I rolle in a ball &"patted" them down a bit instead of making an "S". I also used the recipe & added finely chopped pecans & omitted the confectioners' sugar for another type of cookie...also made cinnamon cookies using cinnamon extract instead of the vanilla & almond...great any way you fix them!!

This recipe was great. I did however add a bit more of the almond.... like other readers said it gave more flavor. And Greek food is all about good flavor.

4 stars for taste. The dough is so sticky it was hard to make shapes. I made a few S's and J's for my name and my husband and son's names. Those were hard enough. I made the rest into ball shapes. I even tried the powdered sugar on my hands trick that others mentioned, but that really didn't help much. It's just a very sticky dough. I might try a cake decorating tool next time.

I thought these were fabulous. I followed others' suggestions and doubled the vanilla and almond extracts. I got about 30 cookies in all; could have made maybe a few more but I was out of cookie sheets. I did 10 rolled in powdered sugar, 10 I flattened and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar before baking, and 10 I flattened and dipped in dark chocolate once cool. The powdered sugar ones were the household favorite. The cinnamon-sugar ones were basically snickerdoodles, and the ones with the chocolate I felt overwhelmed the subtle flavor of the cookies themselves. I think this is a really easy, delicious, and versatile recipe.

Dough is VERY sticky...even after using confec. sugar. Instead, I just made little balls. Still good though!

OMGoodness. These were so good. Not too sweet or plain. It is a bit time consuming to make the "S" shape but I'm more than positive that the more I make them, the faster it will be. Also, my 4 year old had tons of fun making letters with the dough since "Mommy was making S's. LOL. Her letter cookies burnt though because she made strands to make the letter. So funny.

My roommates grandmother sent us some of these cookies, but I didn't have the recipe.  These taste just as delicious and they're easy to make.

We made this for my son's class last week and everyone went crazy! They were gone in about 2.5 seconds and my son was the hit of the Greek party! Thanks!
