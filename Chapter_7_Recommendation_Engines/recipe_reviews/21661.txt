Simply delicious! I LOVE scrambled eggs for breakfast especially on a Sunday! It's a great way to start the day and when you add in some sausage and cheese....well it's downright tasty. I usually use milk or a bit of half and half to achieve fluffy scrambled eggs, but this was recipe called for a bit too much. I used a bit less than 1/2 cup vs. 3/4 cup. I also like to add just pinch of onion and garlic powders plus a little salt and pepper. I used Cheddar cheese and served it with whole grain toast and "Home-Fried Potatoes" from this site. Next time, I might place every thing inside a warrm tortilla for a great breakfast wrap!

This recipe was DELICIOUS!! instead of using links pork sausages i used a Gourmet Mitchell's Foods Cheddar Cheese Smoked Sausage and it was great! i also used some leftover potatoes that i had made the night before with some tartar sauce and it was a yummy addition, and since i'm not good at making scrambled eggs, they always turn out burnt, i made an omelette out of it.... still really good!!!!

I like to add some seasonings...salt and pepper.  This is an easy basic recipe and it is great for SUnday mornings.  I used the sausage patties instead of links....easier to chop up that way for me.  Also reduced the amount of milk to 1/2 cup.  Thanks for the post.

This was good and filling.  I used bacon instead of sausage.  My only gripe would be that there was too much milk in the eggs.  I had to actually drain out some of the liquid after the eggs set(I cannot eat slimey eggs)  Other than that, thought this was great!

I sub any type of meat for the sausage links (ham or bacon or crumbled sausage patties). I add salt, pepper and somtimes sesoning salt. I like to also sautee onions with this. I usually use 1/2 cup of milk. This is wonderful!

I grew up on this. I thought my grandma made this up. We also make it with bacon or polish sausage. One time my grandma made it with bolonga. I didn't care much for it. My favorite is when it is made with polish sausage.

My daughter had off yesterday from school and I thought this would be a great way to start the day!! I only used 1/2c milk and used a seperate pan to scramble the eggs.  I also added some chopped green onion. Although this is a "basic knowledge recipe" - it was great!

Got home from a long day at work CRAVING breakfast, and stumbled upon this quick recipe which suited me!  I actually used spicy sausage links, some baked potatoes left over from last night (excellent addition) and some bacon bits along with the cheese.  Served up with two buttered pieces of toast and a tall glass of OJ.  Yummy!  Thanks for bringing simplicity into my day!!!!

Yumm! Great basic recipe. You can add whatever you like to jazz it up a bit! I had 1lb sage sausage to use up, so I used it with 12 eggs. Even with this many eggs, the milk was too much. Next time I'll use somewhere between 1/4c-1/2c depending on how many eggs I'm cooking.

This was quick and basic. I didn't have any, but my boyfriend liked it. I think I would scale the milk down a little bit though.

Great comfort food recipe -- as kids, my cousin "taught" me to crumble up my sausage into my cheese eggs :-)I've made a version of this for a long time.

I used 1/4 cup of heavy whipping cream and 1/4 cup of milk. This held the eggs together nicely. The original recipe of 3/4 cup milk is too much liquid.

This was ok.  I increased the number of eggs to 12 and used a lb. of bulk sausage.  The cheese in the egg mixture changed the texture of the eggs. I think I will just melt the cheese on top next time.  If I did that I think I could give it 4 stars.

As a vegetarian, these aren't great for me... for my family however, they're in love!!! I   think I spent a month where this is all my family would eat for breakfast. So yes, I made these several times and will likely make them again.

I made this for my husband. He loves eggs any way he can get them.. This was a perfect recipe for him. Just the right  things in the recipe.. Make it just like the recipe says.. But my Husband always puts to much salt, so I don't put much salt and pepper when I cook.. It was very good...

This was good but I think the eggs would have been better if using a little water instead of milk...or even even just a lot less milk.

Simple and easy dish. As recommended, I used only 1/2 cup of milk and shredded a leftover baked potato in it to give it more texture and filling. Delicious!

I've been doing something like this for years. I go a little further, I brown chopped tatters along with onion, bell pepper and mushrooms then add the eggs and last cheese. I cook this in a cast iron skillet on top of the stove over low heat covered for something like 7 minutes then shut off the heat and let it set for something like 5 minutes, cools it and it pulls away from the side of the skillet.

If you add sweet red or yellow bell peppers (saute in a little olive oil first) plus a few dashes of powdered mustard, it kicks it up a notch!  To make it travel, you can wrap in tortillas, stuff in pitas, etc.  Yum and thx for posting!

Very easy to make and flexible.   I added onion,  tomatoes,  and topped with almond slivers.  Added nice crunch.  you can add whatever you like to have with your scrambled eggs.

So tasty! I made this with what I had on hand. After I cooked the sausage I took it out and added cut up red potatoes to sausage grease and cooked those up. I cut up the sausage into pieces in the meantime. When the potatoes were all cooked I added eggs to them then the sausage pieces. Topped with colby jack cheese. Yummy!!!!

This is a breakfast comfort food staple that can be left as is or add mushrooms, green peppers, etc. Usually, in the same cast iron skillet that the sausage is browning, I am also frying some country fries or hash browns. In a sauce pan I have some country pepper gravy or some sausage gravy cooking to spoon over the taters. The full breakfast then completes with the addition of a slice of lightly buttered (real butter) whole wheat toast and a cup of my favorite custom dark blend coffee. Ahhh heaven at the breakfast table!!!

Classic recipe and just how my mom used to make it.  Always looking for low carb/low sugar and had some leftover Mables BBQ (Cleveland, OH) from the night before so I decided to jazz things up this morning.eggs (coconut milk, minced onion, garlic powder, salt, pepper), kielbasa, brisket, rib meat, collard greens and havarti cheese...  Awesome!

We call this a "Breakfast Mess".  I always have leftover home fries or hash brown potatoes. Even flavored rice. Those go in, and sometimes mushrooms, and chopped bacon instead of sausage.  And chopped green onions as a garnish.
But I cook the meat and potatoes first, and then scramble the eggs into it. Then top with cheese and garnish. I add salsa.

I've been making a version of this for years. When I'm browning the sausage, I include about a quarter cup of chopped onion. I serve the eggs in a warmed pocket bread and we call it Breakfast pitas.

Great inspiration for a "Fridge clean-up" scrambled egg recipe! 1. Slice up (half-inch pieces) bacon and sausage and fry until done. 2. Add minced onions and garlic, then fry. 3. Add  diced left-overs ( potatoes, carrots, veggies) plus eggs, grated cheese, salt and pepper. 4. Cook and serve. Never mind if some items are missing. Yum! And a different flavor with every cooking. This will be a weekly breakfast ritual!

I've been making this basic recipe for years with a couple of variations. I use patties instead of links and I put the sausage back into the pan first. Then add the egg mixture seasoned with salt and pepper, then the cheese. Then I use a spatula to mix it all together.

Great tasting and easy to make.  I would agree with other reviewers though, reduce milk to 1/2 cup.  I didn't read those until I already made the egg/milk mixture, so I think reducing the milk would have made them better and easier.  I also used bulk sausage instead of links and it tasted great!

This is a good starting point. I use much less than 3/4 cup of milk for 6 eggs, and I also season with s&p. Sausage links are good, but kielbasa also works. Thanks!

This tasted better than it looks. Added salt pepper and onion, reduced the amount of milk, used bulk sausage and mild shredded cheese.
