This is a great base recipe.  It was a little bland for my taste so I added my favorite seasonings (garlic seasoning, seasoned salt, more pepper, etc.).  I used leftover dark meat and added mushrooms.  There was not enough liquid to cover everything so I threw in a beer and a little water.  The stew turned out fantastic.  This is a great way to use up that leftover turkey.  Mmmmmmmm.

This was gold!  I used up my leftover Christmas turkey, and I threw in a few more potatoes than called for because I had less bird than I thought.  I upped the amount of stock a little for the potatoes to soak up.  Also omitted the green pepper which I didn't have.  Other than that, did as I was told with great, stick-to-your-ribs results!  This is a keeper.  Might even cheat and try it with chicken.  This turned out exactly as I hoped in my head... I love it when that happens!

One of my favorite all-time recipes. Be sure to use fresh uncooked turkey to get the melt in your mouth texture. We also sub red bell pepper, for green, since we prefer it.

I have made this a few times now and my family loves it!  It is also a winner with me because it is so easy to make.  I have made it with both turkey and chicken, and have to admit the turkey is a little better.  But I love being able to just drop the raw meat into the stew, no other prep.  I also may try adding some peas.  i have a large family, so I double this a use a few extra potatoes.  It is still quick, easy and a healthy dinner to put on the table.  I like how it gives you that wonderful feeling of a filling stew on a cold night, but it is also low fat and healthy.

I made this in my crockpot, left it on low all day and mmmm, the smell as I came in the door was amazing. I added chili powder, garlic and basil to mine. Served it with homemade muffins. Delicious dinner for a cold winter evening.

I used my left overs from the Rosemary Roasted Turkey that I made for Thanksgiving. The additional flavor of the rosemary and basil gave this stew an amazing flavor. This is one of the best stews I've had in years.

I made this stew last year for Boxing Day with leftover turkey from the Rosemary Turkey recipe on this site. It was good but, it was a bit bland. This year, I made the Michiganer's Turkey from this site and used left over white and dark meat from it. I also made quite a few substitutions and additions: Veggies - 3 red potatoes, frozen corn, frozen peas and frozen baby carrots. Spices - In addition to the 1/4 tsp. marjoram, I used 1/2 tsp. poultry seasoning, 1 tsp. dried basil, 1 tsp. onion powder (because i didn't have any onions!), 1 tsp fresh parsley, 1 clove of fresh garlic,1 bay leaf and fresh ground pepper to taste. The flavour was excellent and exactly what I had hoped for. This recipe is good made as is but, it's better as a base recipe to add your own personal flavourings to. With additions a 5/5, without additions a 4/5. Serve with fluffy biscuits recipe from this site - the perfect accompaniment!

This is a great tasting, filling stew.  I used chicken breast instead of turkey, since I couldn't find turkey breast at the grocery store.  I used 4 split, boneless skinless chicken breasts, chopped up.  The stew was a little on the bland side, so I added garlic, sage leaves, more marjoram and some crushed red pepper for heat. I also used two tablespoons of olive oil on medium heat instead of butter.  I recommend adding in extra carrots, peppers and celery, if you like vegetables. We served this with warm bread and it was a perfect, satisfying and healthy winter dinner.

I liked this, but hubby wasn't too much of a fan.  I used leftover turkey breast from the rosemary turkey recipe from this site.  Instead of chicken broth, I made turkey broth from the carcass, peppercorn, carrots, celery, fresh thyme, and fresh rosemary.

What a great tasting stew!!!!!  It was a little watery so I added cornstarch to thicken it up and I served it over rice!  I cut back on the green pepper since I'm not a big fan of peppers, but it did add a nice flavor.  I also added fresh mushrooms and used chicken instead of turkey.  I served it to 3 teenagers and they loved it!!!!  It has a nice flavor and would be great on cold wintry days.  Very filling!  Thanks for sharing

This was pretty good.  My leftover turkey was tough, but that was probably my fault.  I think next time I might use fresh rather than left over.  But the over all taste was yummy.  Like someone else mentioned, I added oregano along with the marjoram and I liked that flavor.  Definitely a recipe you can play around with.

This is my all-time favorite soup!! I left the green bell out the first time I made it, simply because I didn't have it on hand. I think it is much better without!

I made this basically according to the recipe, with just a few changes: Added an extra carrot and two extra potatoes Used some minced garlic (about a tbsp), some basil (about 1 tsp) and a sprinkle of crushed red chilies Substituted leftover roast turkey for raw turkey breast (I think the trick to not having it taste dried out is to use thick pieces of white meat, and to also use some dark meat). The stew turned out wonderfully, everyone who tried it said it was the best turkey stew they'd ever had.  Even my picky 4 year old daughter and 1 year old son ate it up!  I will definitely make this again and again with our leftover turkey.

This was an excellent use for left over holiday turkey!  This stew hit the spot during our rare very cold weather spurt here in New Orleans. I made it my own by using: 1 onion, 1/2 of a large bell pepper and a teaspoon of chopped garlic.  My family loved it.  This will be my go to left over meal.

This was absolutely delicious. I can't believe more people haven't tried this! I used 2 turkey breast cutlets, added a clove of garlic, omitted the onion, and added about a half a pound of mushrooms (sliced). I did have to use about 4 1/2 cups of chicken stock to cover everything. The marjoram gave it the most amazing flavor. Served with warm, crusty french bread for a delicious meal on a cold night. Thank you SO much!

This turned out exactly how I thought it would.  Great recipe for leftover turkey.  I used leftover Christmas turkey, added 4 T flour, 4 C broth (made from the turkey), only 1 onion, 1/2 tsp of poultry seasoning, 1 tsp. of basil and pepper to taste.  I did not use the majoram.  Next time I will thicken just slightly more b/c we like a thicker stew.  Very delicious!  Thanks for sharing....

So good! I used one onion, two celery stalks, leftover baby carrots and one Russet potato. I threw in some fresh tarragon and left out the bell pepper. I finished it with dumplings, following the recipe from Easy Chicken and Dumplings. Thanks for this great recipe!

very good soup i added a table spoon of garlic cuz i like garlic and added one sweet potato and one regular one. I never used marjoram before. was yummy. will do again. i made with cooked turkey which i think the recipe should be made with uncooked because the turkey did not absorb the flavor of this yummy soup.

Needs salt and pepper. Also, 2 onions to small amounts of the other vegetables is too much. After cutting up one onion, I knew I needed more of the other vegetables. I more that doubled all others and added some frozen peas at the very end, since our household doesn't like bell peppers. Good, but nothing to write home about.

This was very good.  I used split chicken breasts to make stock, then shredded the meat for the stew.  I also added some fresh thyme I had on hand, which went well with everything.  Left out bell pepper since the hubby dislikes it.

I received a dutch oven for Christmas and this was the recipe I decided to make. The only changes I made was substituting red peppers for the green and  oregano for the marjoram. I posted a photo felt it would help others try this great meal. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent . The only thing I would do differently is add the carrots in a little later so that they maintain their flavor. This is an amazing recipe that can easily changed to suit your liking ( thickness, more veggies, seasoning. Also Instead of chicken stock I used water and bunions

Loved it. I used chicken instead of turkey. I was expecting a salty flavor similar to other stews that I have made, and this one had more of a sweet flavor - which I LOVED! Tasted even better the second day after the vegetables absorbed the seasoning.

This is SO yummy! The chicken bouillon that I used might be partly to blame (Knorr extra large cubes). I was a little skeptical of the green pepper, but it is was a wise choice. I used the dark meat left over from the Thanksgiving turkey. I am having a terrible day...no week, but this is making me happy right now!

I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand but still was able to throw this together with very little fuss.  I had some frozen chicken tenderloins, which I used in place of the turkey, and how I ended up without any chicken broth in the cupboard I don't know but I used water and white wine instead and it tasted delicious.

This is a wonderful recipe.  Only alterations made were to omit the bell pepper, used leftover Thanksgiving turkey, and I only used one onion as two seemed like a lot.  Thought this made a delicious meal.

This stew was okay.  My husband loved it, but my daughter and I both thought it was a little bland.  The "idea" of this stew is good, but it definitely needs additional seasoning.  I will use this recipe again - as a building block.

This turned out even better than I expected. I made a double batch. I used the left over Turkey carcas from Christmas. I simmered it for 2 hours. Let cool and removed the turkey from the bones and used this turkey in the stew and the juices for my stock. I added 1 tps. "Better Than Boullon Turkey Base." 
I used red potatoes and did not peel them, just cut into cubes. It added a nice color.  Yummy!

Yummy in my tummy! This is what I did. In large pot, Sautéed carrots, celery, onion, and garlic in butter until soft. Transferred vegetables to another dish. In same pot, put in tablespoon of olive oil and added raw diced turkey (organic) until cooked. Then added 32 oz carton chicken stock and seasoning. Then added the potatoes. Brought soup to a boil and then simmered on low for a few hours. Omitted flour as didn't think it was necessary. Also seasoned the turkey with s&p before adding to pot. Really good!

My grocery store didn't have boneless turkey breast, so bought boneless skinless chicken, and just pretty much doubled everything! The only thing I did do different was to omit the green pepper - I just thought it was an odd ingredient to throw in! I might add that I put much more marjoram in the stew than it called for - 1/4 tsp based on the stew's original proportions sounded way too little - glad I decided to follow my instincts -  It was absolutely delicious!!! 

I will look forward to try this with leftover turkey after Thanksgiving!!

This is a really good recipe as it is, very dependable results. I have a few suggestions after making it numerous times: I use red pepper instead of green (much prettier), I add a pinch of rosemary with the marjoram, and in the summer when small zucchinis are plentiful, I cut two baby ones into large-ish chunks and add at the same time as the pepper. Excellent! The most important adjustment of all, though, is: 2 small or one medium sweet potato, chopped very small. Add when the regular potatoes go in. The sweet potato will break down and become part of the gravy... a rich gravy that clings to the morsels when you eat it with a fork. I get fantastic reviews when I make it this way, plus it ups the nutritional value! (Incidentally, I do not like sweet potatoes by themselves... but in this they just taste like gravy.)

This was a little bit of awesomeness in a bowl. I made it almost as is with a couple of changes - 1 jalepeño for the bell pepper, turkey stock instead of chicken (post Thanksgiving leftovers) and a mix of leftover turkey for the breasts. Also, I'm a pressure cooker lover, I made it in the pressure cooker and let it cook for 25 minutes on high pressure.   Like I said, pure awesomeness.

This was very delicious.  I did make a few adjustments:  no celery, I added peas (this was more in the theme of Thanksgiving anyways,) added 1 Tbs. celery salt, 1 Tbs. fresh thyme, 1 Tbs. salt, increased broth to 4 c. and used 4 potatoes.  The flavor was delicious.  I served it alongside a batch of buttermilk biscuits.  This one is definitely going in the recipe box and will be used with leftover Thanksgiving turkey in the future!

I made this with no changes other than 3x the amounts and using broth instead of stock. It was the BEST stew/soup I have ever made/eaten!! All of my nine kids ate multiple bowls and my husband and I loved it. Such great flavor and so filling!

This stew is good.  I used leftover Rosemary Roasted Turkey from thanksgiving.  I added an extra cup of chicken stock and used a red bell pepper instead of green.  I agree that it is missing something, so I added 1 tsp. poultry seasoning, and that helped.  I would recommend even more seasoning - just add what you like!

This is the perfect meal to serve on a cold winter night. It was so easy to make. I forgot to pick up a green bell pepper so I added a can of corn instead. It turned out great! This is a recipe that I will be making many times (I've already made it twice in 3 weeks!) It's a great tasting hardy stew.

I was looking for a recipe to use up all the veggies I had at home, and I found this.  The result was great, very nice and chunky, with thick consistency, exactly what I had in mind.  I didn't have any marjoram, so I had to improvise with thyme and basil, but the flavour was bland, so I added some garlic and cheyenne pepper to add more flavour.  With those adjustments, this recipe will become our family's staple!

I used chicken because I couldn't find turkey. This was ok. It's pretty bland. If I make it again, a lot of garlic and other herbs would need to be added.

Easy and really good! I had a whole turkey breast that I didn't end up cooking on Thanskgiving, so I put it in the crockpot for 6 hours on high with onion, celery and 1.5 cups of chicken broth. After it was cooked, we shredded it and used the shredded meat to make the stew. I forgot to add the green pepper, but I will try that next time. We also added basil, oregano and parsley. We will definitely make this again.

I took out the marjoram, pepper and celery and substitute the turkey for chicken. Doubled the recipe and added rosemary, garlic, nutmeg and cinnamon. It turned out perfectly! My friend says it took him back to his childhood. Sort of tasted like gravy. Will absolutely make this again.

This recipe needed a lot of help flavor wise. I ended up adding a lot of different spices like garlic salt, thyme, rosemary, etc. Also added two chicken bouillon cubes and finally got the flavor I was looking for. We aren't really pepper eaters so maybe that makes all the difference? Not really sure, I guess just added spices to your liking!

I used chicken bouillon instead of chicken stock 2 cubes/cup of water and I used oregano instead of marjoram.  I also added some sausage to the stew and it was a hit for dinner!  Definitely adding to my recipe box!

I've made this gem of a recipe a handful of times since discovering it and I must confess....I've always made this with chicken! No matter, as it's a fabulous recipe, which holds up well to changes. I generally add another cup or two of chicken stock (my favorite is the Better Than Boullion) and omit the marjoram (never have any on hand), but I do add a few shakes of dried parsley to the pot. My family likes garlic, so I generally add either fresh, minced garlic or garlic powder to taste. I leave out the bell pepper as well....I love them, but somehow it doesn't seem like it fits in this recipe. However, per another reviewer's suggestion, perhaps I'll try the red pepper the next time. Also, I throw my cubed chicken in raw and only simmer 15-20 minutes, tops. 30 minutes would turn the chicken to rubber and the potatoes to mush! I really love the simplicity of this recipe. It's my "go-to" when someone in my family is sick....quite the comfort food. I promise I'll try the turkey eventually - it's just so good with the chicken! Thanks for this delicious and healthy submission.

This was a very nice stew.  The bell pepper adds a very nice flavor.  My toddlers gobbled it up.

I make a huge turkey just so I can make this after thanksgiving!  I also like to use of my left over gravy on this recipe by adding it to the cold broth before heating.  Adds some good flavor.

This is delicious!!  I doubled the recipe to feed my family, and I used leftover Thanksgiving turkey.  I used basil instead of marjoram because I didn't have any, and green beans instead of peppers.  I also let this simmer several hours. It was excellent and my whole family loved it...a nice change from regular old turkey soup.  Also, I can't have gluten so I used rice flour and it worked great.  I'll be making this again for sure!

I scaled this one for 12.  I started with 10 cups of water and 10 chicken bouillien cubes dumped the carrots into this to cook. When the carrots was done I peeled and cubed the potatos and dumped a half cup of flour ito the broth and carrots and potatoes. I didnt have any marjoram but used basil and red pepper flakes. Delicious !! Teenage son said it was awesome. Served it up with fresh hot bisquits.

very good. I added 1tsp celery salt, more flour for a thicker stew and some peas, corn and green beans the last 10 minutes of cooking. I don't like bell peppers, so I omitted them. This makes a hearty stew perfect for leftover Thanksgiving turkey!

This soup was really good.  I used left over turkey from Thanksgiving.  I added some vegetables that I had on hand, broccoli & cabbage.  Also 1 tbsp. poultry seasoning, garlic, salt, pepper & 1 tsp. basil.  Quick and easy, all you need is cornbread or spicy crackers.

Nice alternative to the usual beef stew.  Perfect for this time of year.  Would be a great way to use up leftover turkey.  I followed the recipe, but added a little corn and cooked this in my slow cooker on low for about  hours.  This was a tasty, healthy, hearty dinner.

I have used this recipe countless times and it works out every time! I have tried it with chicken and it doesn't have the same flavour so since then, I've only used turkey. I've used both leftover turkey and fresh turkey breast and again, both work. I leave out the green pepper as I find it's flavour overpowers the others. It's so quick and easy to make - great as an evening meal and leftover! Thank you!

Made this today.  Hubby likes hearty soups so had to adjust some by adding more tators &  turkey plus salt & pepper. I left the bell pepper out.   It was bland but good for a change & a nice change from turkey sandwiches.  (My neighbor really liked it.)  Didn't knock any socks off but everyone ate it.  After we ate the first batch I added some cooked frozen peas to it & a little left over giblet gravy & served over mashed potatoes & with garlic toast to change up the leftovers & man oh man was that good!

It's fresh, flavorful and delicious. This stew tastes like something you've been simmering all day, but you can actually make after a full day at work. My family was quite pleased with this!

This was a very good recipe for using leftover Thanksgiving turkey.  I left out the bell pepper and the marjoram since I didn't have any.  I added black pepper, garlic powder, poultry seasoning and sage.

Me and my family really enjoyed this recipe.  I added 1/4 tsp ground thyme, 1/4 tsp sage, and 1/2 tsp basil to the recipe as well.  We put the stew over rice or stuffing.

I'm new to cooking, so when looking for a Turkey Stew recipie for my Xmas turkey leftovers, I was really worried about finding things that were too complicated. This recipie was just the opposite, it was so simple and came out brilliantly! I didn't use the pepper and I also added pearl barley, but it was so delicious, my partner couldn't believe I cooked it. Will definitely use this again!

I just made this with my leftover turkey from thanksgiving and it was great!!  I cooked rice on the side, then stirred it in when the pot of stew was done, and I think it added a lot to the stew, although I am sure it would have been good without the rice too.  While it was cooking my husband said it smelled like it was missing something so I added salt and pepper and that seemed to make it better.  It was very filling and we both loved it.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This is a family fave... I do add more veggies (corn and green beans as I have an abundance) and use raw wild turkey breast. I also use chicken broth and more than required as it does thicken up the next day. Also skip the green pepper and add more season, garlic and rosemary. It’s fantastic! Make this multiple times a year

This is a great base recipe. I cook a turkey breast in the oven using a cooking bag, then I double the recipe. I also increased the vegetables and added Brussel sprouts. I also removed the marjoram and added salt, pepper and fresh garlic.  Plus I dice up a jalapeno and added that to the onion and celery. Adds just a little bit of heat. Tasty!

I tweaked this recipe a little. I added more seasonings and made my roux thicker and added some cream of mushroom and half and half to make it a little heartier. I also opted for canned carrots, green beans, and sweet peas. I still used the fresh onion, pepper, celery, rosemary, and thyme. I diced some red potatoes (left the peel on) and threw them in towards the end of cooking time. Family LOVED it.

I used 4 cups of my own homemade turkey stock (3 cups of liquid didn't seem enough). On it's own I found this needed flavor boosting so I added several spices; a scant more marjoram, garlic powder, tarragon, poultry seasoning and sea salt.  Also didn't add the pepper (I was out). This was a tasty stew and I would make it again.

Very good turkey stew. Very hearty yet basic. I had never used majorum before so that was a treat. I also added garlic salt, pepper and seasoning salt. Overall great recipe for a turkey soup.

Wow!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!  We love it but with more herbs & spice than included in the recipe.  I do dislike it when folks rate a recipe they've changed but it does need more flavoring as some other reviewers had said.  We enjoyed it so much that it is on our keeper list to enjoy over and over again!  I used chicken rather than turkey as the turkey breast I had on hand would have been too much for the recipe and I also did bring the cubed raw chicken to a boil in a separate pot first as I don't like the white frothy gunky stuff when you boil chicken so I removed the lightly boiled chicken with a slotted spoon to the veggie pot & the chicken was nice and tender in this dish.  Spices I used and found to be just the perfect flavoring were: rounded 1/4 tsp. marjoram,  1/4 to 1/2 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. black pepper,  rounded 1/2 tsp. celery seed,  1 bay leaf.  The fragrance and flavor was amazing!   I increased the chicken stock to 4 cups and I also used slender carrots for nice sized slices and I used 3  carrots  and  2 stalks of celery and then added a cup of frozen green peas in the last ten minutes of cooking as I omitted the green pepper.  Green pepper would over power the rest of this dish.  We like the veggies in it!  Served lightly seasoned in the bowl with fresh ground sea salt & pepper to taste. The finished dish reminded me very much of a delicious chicken pot pie without the crust!  I will make this recipe soon again and many times after!   A really lovely chi

My family loved this recipe! I would definitely make it again. I left out the bell pepper because I did not have one, but next time I may add it in. I made cornbread muffins to go with it and it was the perfect dinner.

This was just the recipe I was looking for. I had been making "Dad's Turkey Stew" from another site - but it wasn't just right. This recipe calls for items I have on hand and offer a tasty way to use up some leftovers from turkey dinner.

As is, the recipe is very bland. A good base recipe, though!

I added basil, rosemary, garlic powder, and quite a few pinches of black pepper. Even after that, the recipe still could have used some more taste. I used leftover turkey instead of freshly purchased. Overall, add your own spices to make this dish your own.

As it is written I give 3 stars- but only because it needed more flavor. I added salt, pepper, garlic powder, sage and Rosemary and it came out pretty good.

I love this recipe! Every time I make a turkey, this recipe comes out to use leftovers. My husband is a big fan! Like others, I found it a bit bland tho so I add extra spices besides marjoram- sage, bay leaves, extra pepper and sometimes parsley or oregano. I also don't use green peppers but instead add frozen peas near the end. Delish!!!!

This was just okay. I was looking for a recipe for a turkey breast...so I tried it. But it didn't have a lot of flavor. I ended up doubling the vegetables and adding minced garlic, oregano, parsley, basil, salt, pepper, and a bay leaf. It wasn't anything special.

Pretty tasty way to use leftover turkey!  Like some other reviewers, I added garlic (with the onions), and oregeno for extra flavor.  I served it over rice.  Very hearty comfort food!

Yum!!  Great way to use Thanksgiving leftovers!  I changed it up a bit---added extra potatoes and broth, Provencal salt, cracked pepper.  Threw in some sprigs of rosemary, sage and basil.  I also put in the remaining wild rice stuffing and a little leftover gravy.   I was using leftover turkey, so I put it in the last ten minutes, just enough to heat it through.  DELISH!!!!!!  Thanks for posting!

I added: 6 cloves of garlic to saute with the onions and carrots; ground sage, black pepper and bay leaves instead of marjoram.
I didn't add: green peppers or celery. 
It was delicious! Hearty soup served with cornbread for a winter night's treat!

This was really, really tasty.  The only deviation from the recipe was that I slightly cooked the raw turkey breast with the vegetables prior to adding the broth and I didn't have green peppers, so added peas.  We didn't expect this to taste so delicious because it's so simple - but, it was exceptionally good.

Excellent!  Turned out perfect.  I did use basil and rosemary as another reviewer did, since I didn't have marjoram.

This was so awesome tasting and even better the next day. I did leave out the bell pepper, we're not really big pepper eaters and we thought that it would be an odd flavor. What a great way to use a lot of left over turkey. Thank you for a great recipe!

I needed to find something quick to make with leftover turkey from Thanksgiving and saw this recipe.  I changed it up a bit, used olive oil instead of butter, no celery, and added Adobo (Spanish seasoning) to give it more flavor.  I also added oregano like another reviewer.  Mine was dry at first so I added some water.

Works like a charm every time. Soups are always a little bit of work, but this one was minimal and using raw turkey really makes it fabulous. A winter staple.

Very tasty. Only thing I substituted was cumin instead of marjoram since I didn't have it.  I also added corn starch to thicken.  And since it just didn't look like stew to me I took the potato masher to it a bit after it was all cooked. I think that added to the taste.  I'd make it again.

Very nice.  Bf and I both really like it.  I had to make a few subs, bc I just didn't have the ingredients and I didn't want to go back to the store.  I eliminated the carrots entirely, subbed oregano and some thyme for the marjoram, and green beans for the pepper.  We had leftover dark meat turkey, so I used that instead of turkey legs.  I didn't peel the potatoes--one of my habits, due to pure laziness and interest in keeping the soup just a little bit more nutritious.  I did add some salt and pepper--just seemed to need a bit more seasoning to me.  Very nice meal for a cold winter's day. Thanks for the recipe!

I did not add the green peppers and it was still outstanding!

Made this recipe with chicken rather than turkey and it was very good.  I did feel that the seasoning lacked a little something. Couldn't quite tell what though.  I'll try adding some different herbs and spices next time (oregano, basil, maybe rosemary??) and see how it turns out.  Overall though, a good solid recipe!

This was easy to make and very tasty.  I couldn't find the turkey breasts so I had my deli guy cut three thick slices of of a whole turkey breast and then I cut it into chunks.  I also omitted the bell pepper and celery because I don't like them.  Good for a cold fall night.  Thanks.

Very Good. But, used a can of mixed veggies, instead of the carrots and potatoes listed.

Very good stew and an excellent way to use up leftovers.  I upped the amount of chicken stock a bit and it turned out great.

Delicious!  First turkey soup I've ever made and this turned out great.  The flavors of the spices were perfect.  I ended up making 5 qts and froze some.  My husband loved it and so did I.

I have made this stew several times and we love it - with a few modifications.  I substitute vegetable oil for the butter, butternut squash for the potatoes, 1 tsp. each of basil and parsley instead of marjorim, and use 4 cups of chicken broth instead of 2.  I also add 1 cup chopped swiss chard (or escarole) at the end instead of the green pepper. Yummy !

This was a great recipe for left-over thanksgiving turkey.  I used approx. amounts of turkey substitution for the turkey breasts.  I also added dried dill weed and salt and peppered to taste.  I cooked it as directed and let it sit in the fridgerator for a couple hours to soak up flavor and then reheated.  It was great!!
