I Have been making this recipe for years,yet much easier to buy frozen glazed meatballs (NOT ITALIAN) I believe its a 3 lb bag. Put into a crockpot add 1 jar Smucker concord grape jelly and 1 bottle Bennets chili sauce. You dont have to thaw the meat balls. The brand of Jelly is important. Have tried other brands and it makes a big Difference.cook on low about 4-5 hours. To speed it up you can also use alarge pan to get them heated faster then into a crock pot. We call them purple meatballs. I have yet to find anyone who does not like them , and there is never one meatball left. Give them a try...Enjoy!

When I made the sauce, I sauteed a sliced onion and a little fresh minced garlic in a little butter/evoo mix before adding the grape jelly and chili sauce. I swear, I can try different sauces for meatballs and I always come back to this one. It's a classic and a winner because it's GOOD. Simple as that. Best with mashed potatoes.

I needed a simple recipe to bring to a work party, and this is it!  I used a jar of Smuckers grape jelly, and substituted the sweet chili sauce you find in the asian food section or chinese grocery store to make the sauce spicy.  I heated the sauces on the stove first and poured the mixture over the frozen premade meatballs in the crock pot.  I left them in the slow cooker on low for about 6-7 hours and the sauce was perfect.  These got rave reviews at the party, everyone loved them!  NOTE:  I used italian style meatballs because that's what I had on hand, and I thought the recipe worked out great, I'm not sure why other reviewers were against it.

Yum!  Got rave reviews.  I used 2 1/2 lbs of meat and doubled the rest of the recipe (1 medium onion chopped fine).  Left out the milk and baked them (so no crisco needed)  I used 1 large jar of Smuckers Jelly and 2 bottles Heinz chili sauce.  Heated the sauce on the stove for a few minutes to melt the jelly and then threw it in the crockpot on high for 1 hour.  Then I let is sit for another 3 1/2 hours before the party.  I had lots of chicken left, but no meatballs.  I was really looking forward to leftovers, oh well guess everyone liked them.  :-)

I've made these meatballs twice and they are a HUGE hit.  I use frozen meatballs - Italian style works fine - along with a jar of grape jelly and a jar of Bennets chili sauce.  I usually add a tbsp or so of yellow mustard to the sauce mixture when I'm heating it on the stove.  Delicious.  I already have these items on hand so I can bring them to the next potluck!

These are delicious - my family has used this sauce for eons.  Try using just the sauce in a crock-pot and toss in some Lil' Smokies or chunks of sausage... yummmy!

My grandmother made these years ago and I was looking for a similar recipe. HERE IT IS!  Thank you.  I skip a step when feeling lazy. I buy the pre-made meatballs from the food service store by me. Voila! done in 20 minutes or so!

I make this every year around Christmas to take to all the holiday gatherings.  It is always a hit!  I have made the meatballs, but the frozen ones are very good, just keep them in the crock pot on low several hours before you will eat them.  I agree with another reviewer that you need to melt the jelly and mix the chili sauce in before you add it to the meatballs.

These are addictive! I made it as stated, but maybe used a tiny little bit less jelly so they wouldn't taste overpowered and I think I made the right decision for my taste. These will definitely be a huge hit if you make them - they were when I made them, and I finished the left overs (I had 6 people and 5lbs of meatballs...lol... by design, so I could eat the rest! lol!) the next day with the family. Great and really quick recipe!

These were delicious! I made some changes but I'm sure they would be delicious as is. For the meatballs, I used 1/3 ground beef, 1/3 ground lamb, and 1/3 ground pork. I used crushed Ritz crackers in place of the bread crumbs, and instead of browning them in oil on the stove, I baked them for 25 minutes in a 400 degree oven. I didn't have any grape jelly so I used homemade blackberry jam. I also put about 1 Tbsp. of stone ground mustard in the sauce. I would definitely make this again and I would like to try the sauce with other flavors of jelly. If you use something other than grape jelly just be sure that it is seedless. The blackberry seeds in my sauce were a bit unpleasant.

I love these!  I bake the meatballs instead of cooking them on the stove.  I melt the grape jelly and chili mixture before dumping the meatballs in - delish!

These were delicious. I did however find that the smell in my crockpot when it first started cooking was unpleasant and I was afraid to try them but the smell improves as it cooks. The reason I give only 4 stars is because I think they have too much bread crumbs. Next time I will cut back on the bread crumbs.

I made these meatballs last night and they were a big hit! I changed the sauce up a little bit by adding a teaspoon of honey and agave sweetener and only 1/2 cup of the chili sauce and it came out great. Will be making these again!

Meh. I could only find southwestern chili sauce at the grocery store, so I used that with the Smucker's Concord Jelly. I don't know if regular chili sauce would have been better, but I wasn't in love with the flavor. When I had them in the crockpot, it was a really thin liquidy sauce. Once I put the leftovers in the fridge, a hard layer of orange fat hardened on the top. When I skimmed that thick layer off and reheated them, the sauce was a little bit better (not so runny anymore), but I still didn't love the flavor.

These were allright. I've had a many cocktail meatballs (at parties and ones I've made myself) and these were not the best of them. My hubby and I didn't dislike these.... We just didn't feel they were as good as ones we've had before. For a fun twist, I served our MB's over a mound of mashed potatoes with a side of vegetables and pasta in a garlic butter sauce (purchased from my grocer's frozen foods section) and garlic butter crescent rolls. Because I served these as a main entree, I used reduced-sugar jelly to cut come of the sweetness. My chili sauce of choice was Heinz (the rest on the shelf were no name brands I'd never heard of) and of course, my jelly choice was Smucker's. :) Maybe these will be your thing, but they weren't ours. I'll stick with my tried and true recipe. Thanks anyways!

OMG tons of flavor!!!  The meatballs on there own were amazing, I think mainly from the onion flakes and you wouldn't believe how great the glaze is!  I served these as a meal with brown rice and a side of roasted zucchini and tomatoes.  Can't wait to make as an appetizer!  These wouldn't make it long!

Addictive. These are great served as an appetizer and if you like, they are great on a toasted sub roll with provolone cheese.

Amazingly Yummy! Just made these for Halloween as appetizers, and they were a huge hit!! No one knew that there was jelly in there! lol I also used the frozen meatballs, along with smokies, and some sliced kilbasa.. I did have to add an extra 12 oz of jelly to tame the chili sauce, but that was just to my taste..I also added a few extra shakes of worcestershire.. But all together, this is my new favorite recipe. I'll bemaking these every Holiday! Thanks!

I can't believe it took me this long to make this recipe.  It's been around for years and years.  I used party-size precooked meatballs from Trader Joe's.  Then I combined the chili sauce and grape jelly in a crockpot, added the meatballs, and left it on high until the meatballs were heated through (about 2-3 hours).  It was a great appetizer for the Superbowl.  I'm going to try this with 'lil smokies too.  Delicious!

This is one of the VERY few "party" meatball recipes I enjoy.  So simple and delicious.  I take short cuts where I can get it, frozen meatballs and crock pot.  Great with Lil Smokies too.

4 stars because I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I used italian bread crumbs, baked the meatballs, and venison instead of beef.  Very yummy.  Made these for our Christmas party tomorrow.

This is a wonderful recipe. It's great as an hors d oeuvre and I am using the basic meatball recipe for my spaghetti sauces! YUM!

This is a favorite at parties - my go to at pot lucks. I use IKEA frozen meatballs, instead if grape jelly I use a can of whole cranberry sauce, and it add 2 tbsp of Sambal sauce for a kick.

I also used purchased mini meatballs and just made the sauce to go on top.  Added some spicy red pepper.  Overall I liked the sauce but it was quite sweet.

Great!  I used frozen meatballs (npt italian) because I was in a hurry. They turned out great. I mixed the jelly and chili sauce on the stove and then added it to the frozen meatballs in the crockpot. I could have made twice as many and probably still would have ran out.
