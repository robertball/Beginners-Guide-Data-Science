Very good!  I made the dressing a few hours ahead and marinated the dried cranberries in it to plump them.  I skipped adding pecans in favor of more fruit - dried cranberries, halved red grapes, and sliced Braeburn apple.

This salad is DELICIOUS!! I left out the sour cream because DH is lactose intolerant. I also added 1 Fuji apple chopped into bite-sized pieces for some extra crunch. DH doesn't like green vegetables, but loved this! Thanks!

This is a great easy salad to make.  The dressing is good, but a little too sweet for me.  I adjusted some of the ingredients to my taste.  The pecans, I toasted without butter or salt.  I used Butter spray.  I have family members on restricted diets.  Still delicious.  Thank you!

I've tasted so many spinach salads at AR, they are starting to taste alike. This one, like the others is good. I made the dressing without sour cream because my husband is lactose intolerant. Other fruit (like cranraisins or mandarin oranges) and other nuts (like almond or walnut) or mushrooms to spinach and you have a great salad.

Very nice flavor. I have made it with both the red wine and the balsamic vinegar. I like it much better with the balsamic vinegar. I always add mandarin oranges to the salad. You can also add green seedless grapes.

This is my go to salad recipe. When I make meals for people who have just had baby's or are ill, I always take this salad. It is easy to make and taste's great. One little change I make is to use honey roasted pecans available in the produce section. I will be making this for Thanksgiving again this year.

I love this salad! You could almost 1/2 the dressing amount.  I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone raved about it.  Toasting the pecans made it great too.

Sooooo good!! ADD GOAT CHEESE for a perfect salad!!! got this recipe from a friend (she didn't mention where she got it) anyway was gonna share it on here but found this one and it's exactlly the same... when I make it.  i add 3/4 cup of goat cheese and i use candied pecans...it's ALWAYS a crowd pleaser... For a summer salad use golden raisins instead of cranberries...

Wonderful salad, very simple yet really good. I added a braeburn apple and some crumbled wensleydale cheese with cranberries, and for the dressing I only used 1 Tbsp of brown sugar (was still a bit too sweet so next time I'll use even less), left out the sour cream and added some poppy seeds. So delicious! Maybe next time I'll try it with pears.. Thanks for the great recipe!

This salad was delicious - very fresh tasting. I only used 2 tablespoons of sugar to make the dressing and still found it to be quite sweet (perfect for my taste though), so I would suggest adding the sugar to taste.

Very sweet dressing but also very good.  Could probably cut the sugar in half and still be very sweet.

I'd give this 10 stars if I could.  This was delicious!!  The only thing I changed was to use Splenda instead of sugar. New cooks; don't take shortcuts - make sure you toast the pecans!!!

My family thought this was just OK.  I used EVOO and red wine vinegar but the dressing was laking something.  It tasted like a weak honey mustard.

This has become my family's favorite spinach salad recipe (even if they don't like spinach).  They always ask for it and although I make a double batch, there is never anything left over.  Dressing is superb. An added touch is toasting the pecans - just put in dry saute pan for a couple of minutes.  Really adds to the flavor.

Fantastic recipe!  I have used walnuts in place of the pecans and they taste just as good.  I use a little more spinach than what is called for because this makes a lot of dressing.  Great taste!  Thanks for the recipe!

This salad was sooo yummy.  I used pecan pie glazed pecans rather than plain toasted pecans.  I took it to my Bunco group and it was gone in a flash with rave reviews.  Thanks for sharing!

I thought this was excellent. I was skeptical at first but it was very tasty. The tastes of each ingredient compliment one another very well. Sometime I will try adding diced apples to it. Dressing is excellent for lots of other salads too.

Great salad..I had it for company and they wanted the recipe!  I used low-fat yogurt instead of sour cream and used just 2 Tbsp. of sugar.  It's a standby now and I'm serving tomorrow for our family Easter dinner...thanks for the recipe.

I really liked this salad...I would use less dressing next time, it is a little strong. I think this dressing could also be substituted with any oil and vinegar type dressing that you enjoy. Delicious though, and fresh.

This was a big hit when I served it - I made one small change, I used craisins instead of dried cranberries.  I'll continue to use this recipe over and over.

Very enjoyable recipe.  I made as directed.  Used about half of the dressing, which seemed to agree with everyone's taste preference.  This was served as part of our Christmas dinner, as a side to prime rib.  Yummy!  Thank you!
