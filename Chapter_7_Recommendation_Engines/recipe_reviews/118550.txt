this is the best sauce ever!!!!!!!!
something i did though is add more vegetables, like zucchini and red and green bell peppers. I also used tomato paste and petite diced tomatoes instead of crushed and pureed tomatoes. after using my variations it makes a superb pasta sauce, but either way it is still EXCELLENT!!!!!

We had a lot of Tomatoes in our garden so we dropped them in boiling water removing the skins, the mashed them up with the food processor, cooked them down for 2 hours, then doubled all the spices from this receipe, added tomatoe soup, then added cornstarch to thicken, then canned this awesome pizza sauce.

Def a great recipe using your tomatoes thru the winter :) Even in pizza Sauce !!!

Great recipe, but I used fresh romas  as well as fresh basil and parsley from my garden. Then I canned the pizza sauce. I was spending a lot of money on canned pizza sauce. Thanks for the recipe.

UPDATE: This sauce ROCKS! I fixed this with crushed tomatoes and subbed tomato paste and water for the puree I didn't have. This is one of the best sauce recipes I've tried from here.  ORIGINAL:Really good sauce. I didn't have crushed tomatoes or puree so I used a small can of diced tomatoes that I mashed up with a fork and 2 cans of tomato paste plus two cans of water per can of paste. This made enough for 2 pizzas tonight plus some dipping sauce and I froze another 6 pizzas worth. Thanks, this was great and I'll probably use this one again.

So good and easy!  I used diced Italian tomatoes and tomato paste as thats all I had, so cut back on the brown sugar.  Bumped up the red pepper flake and also sauteed a little minced onion with the garlic too.  Used Easy pizza sauce/dough recipe from this site for my crusts.  Best pizza we've had in a long time!

The older child and I usually make dinner together on Sunday nights, and he wanted pizza. We usually buy a crust from Papa Murphy's and add our own toppings...but I thought it would be a good idea for my son to learn how to make pizza sauce.

This was simple enough for him to grasp with my help and much better than the canned pizza that you buy premade. We didn't change the recipe at all. It seems a little sweet for my tastes and that it's missing something that I just can't put my finger on. Worchestershire?
A little tomato paste?

This made a lot, so I froze the remaining sauce in 1 c. portions and labeled it so for later use.

Someone commented that we shouldn't rate the recipe then suggest changes...personally I find the comments others make on how they changed the recipe to be just fine.  Helps me make decisions on how to cook or even if I want to try the recipe (I don't bother to look at the number of stars given anyway).  Thanks, everyone!

This was the first time I have made pizza sauce from scratch.  Made the first pizza with it and thought it a bit mild, tho the kids loved it.  Added extra chili peppers to the sauce and made the second pizza, I thought it was much better. It didn't make it to hot, but had more flavor.

I tried this recipe because I had to make pizza for a children's party and I didn't have time to go to the grocers. The only thing I had in my house was tomato puree and all the other ingrediets except the crushed red pepper flakes so I used fresh peppers which I diced up really fine. In my rush I accidentally used 1 tbsp basil instead of 1 tsp. I put it on a thin crust dough, added cheese, mushrooms, sweet corn, crushed pineapple and sliced hot dog sausages. It tasted really good and the children loved it.

Excellent! A nice, basic sauce with lots of flavor.  I didn't have the crushed tomatoes, so I subbed with a large can of tomato sauce and cooked it down a bit more.  I used a Tuscan seasoning blend (only because I had 1 Tbsp. left to use and wanted to get rid of it) and a little more basil.  I think next time I'll add a bit of oregano, too, but still, this is a really fast, easy and good sauce as stated.

Great recipe!  Sauce is the best I have tasted.  Makes large batch so I froze the rest and it was still great after thawing.

I didn't want to buy pizza sauce again and we had a bunch of tomatoes from our veggie garden and so I thought 'hey, why don't I make pizza sauce with the tomatoes!' so I found online how to make tomato puree and crushed tomatoes (and believe me, it's more than just blending for a puree and smashing tomatoes), well anyway, I used this recipe for the sauce and my oh my, it is FABULOUS!!! I wanna just eat it by itself! It's sooooo yummy! Followed the recipe to a T, which meant lots of weighing and measuring for the homemade stuff :)

Tasty!! I did not want any actual chucks of tomato in the sauce so I omitted the crushed tomatoes, but otherwise followed this recipe. The family was very pleased with my first ever homemade pizza. Thanks!

I used this recipe as a base, so I didn't follow it exactly. But it worked out well, and is probably the best pizza/pasta sauce I've ever made. I used fresh tomatoes from our garden (six medium-sized tomatoes) and instead of crushed red pepper I used a jalapeno, also from our garden. I boiled tomatoes and pepper for a few minutes and slipped off the skin. I also used basil from our garden, and balsamic vinegar instead of brown sugar. Added a heaping tbsp of tomato paste, as well. I let is simmer for an hour, then used the immersion blender and came up with a wonderful, thick sauce.

Very tasty sauce. It would be good over pasta or in chicken parm or foods like that. Its got just the right amount of spice in it to make it right. This makes an excellent everyday pasta sauce as well.

This is a pretty good basic sauce, but I'm still searching for one to measure up to our favorite local pizza shop. I may have to make a trip there soon to do ANOTHER taste test!  This sauce has a little too much italian seasoning for me, but that's just a personal preference.

This was perfect for the pizza I was making.  It tasted as fresh and full of spice as the zucchini and grilled chicken I used for the pizza.  Having the small tomato chunks was a great change and my little kids didn't notice.  The leftovers were even great- and I don't usually eat pizza leftovers.

Fantastic sauce! I used up 3 cups of frozen tomato sauce and added in a couple 14.5oz cans of Italian diced tomatoes. It was the perfect balance of sweet and savory, and if you like more savory to sweet just lessen the amount of brown sugar you use. My go to scratch tomato sauce from now on!

Great pizza sauce.  I made exactly as directed.  Just a note that this does make quite a bit of sauce, so I freeze in individual servings.  Thanks for sharing!!

Awesome! My family loved this; they say it's better than any take-out! Had to downsize the recipe. Too much for a family of three. No other changes, perfect just the way it is.

I chose this sauce because i had everything on hand. I was pleased with the taste and consistancy. I did however double the amount of sugar and Italian seasoning. I like more of a sweeter taste. I will explore other recipes but will definitely keep this one on hand.

This was a great recipe!  I left out the brown sugar and couldn't even tell a difference.  I also added some extra red pepper flakes which made it spicy and delicious.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was an excellent and easy basic pizza sauce, and will likely be my family's go-to sauce! This could easily be a 5-star by adding some fresh ingredients to it-- chopped tomatoes, onions, and fresh basil-- if you have time and have them on hand. Otherwise, it's delicious as is.

This sauce is the perfect mix of sweet from the brown sugar and a good spice taste from all the italian spices. We also used fresh on-the-vine tomatoes and pureed them in the food processor. This makes almost enough for 2 pizzas, we froze the second portion and was easy to thaw and use a second time.

Thought this was just ok.  A little sweet for my taste, not enough zest.   Tried adding more pepper flakes, but still kept feeling like something was missing?

Very good! Added a little more garlic, onion powder and red pepper and used lots of fresh basil instead of dried. Also pureed it in the blender and put it on homemade whole wheat honey pizza dough (recipe is also on this site).

Very tasty sauce and straightforward recipe.  Just follow the directions, and you will have a sauce that is good enough to eat with just a spoon.  If you like a saucy pizza, don't hesitate to load it up with this one.  My friend couldn't get over how good the sauce tasted.  If you are cooking with chicken, ladle a cup or two of sauce in the pan to cook with the chicken because the flavor is much stronger.  I will be making this sauce again.

I was a little disappointed in the flavor of the sauce. I added about 1 T. dried onion and 1 T. dried oregano.  That helped.  Seemed a little bland.

This sauce made enough for about 8 regular 12 inch pizzas.  The tomato flavor was robust without overpowering the rest of the pizza, the sauteed garlic gave it a kick, not just taste-wise, but aroma-wise, the brown sugar mellowed the red pepper beautifully.  I made this according to the recipe, and while I may tweak some things in the future, straight from the recipe was utterly fantastic.  We used it to make 6 different types of pizza and it worked well with each one.  Scrumptious!

Halfway through this recipe I kinda forgot that I meant to halve it so I accidentally doubled the sugar and seasoning. The sauce is a tiny bit overpowering but still DELICIOUS. I can only imagine how tasty it'll be next time when I use the right amount of spices.

I usually make this pizza sauce and it's great.  I do adjust it to make half of the recipe.  I also use less then 1/2 Tbsp of Italian seasoning, since I don't like to have that overpowering the sauce.  Other then that I cut everything in half and use just the crushed tomatoes.  My husband really like this sauce when I make homemade pizza dough.

Default # servings (11) makes a LOT of sauce.  Enough for at least 4 large pizzas.  So if making for single meal, tone down the servings unless you want extra to save for future.  Makes a nice, sweet sauce.  May taste better with extra garlic and red pepper to add some kick.

Very tasty sauce!  I thought the brown sugar might make it too sweet, but it was just right.

This was my first homemade pizza sauce attempt. I was a little nervous in regard to adding the brown sugar, but the combination of sweet and spicy was wonderful! I added a bit more crushed red pepper(since my house likes a little more spice), and I do believe that this recipe has a great flavor combination for pizza!

Made this exacly as written. Was actually a very good sauce! I have been stuck on the Contadina Pizza Sauce, havent been able to find anything close. But I had a 28oz can of tomato puree in the house that I needed to use up, so figured I'd give this a try. It made enough for 4 pizzas for me, so for the price difference, the taste is just as good. This cost roughly $2.20 for me to make 4 pizzas worth, the Contadina would cost me $5.96 to make that much. WIll definelty make again. Thanks for the great, money saving, recipe!

I love the richness of this recipe. I used a can of tomato sauce in place of the crushed tomatoes and paste as it's all I had on hand. I think it would be better as the original recipe states. I only cooked my sauce on min. for about 15 minutes. I used this with Calzones and it was great.

I liked it and I will use it again. I changed it only because I only had one can of whole tomatoes in the pantry. What I did was to put them in the blender and made puree, then since I didn't have the other can of crushed tomatoes on hand I just reduced slightly the herb and spices as stated. Came out great.

Amazing sauce that is very versatile. Use for spaghetti or any other time a red sauce is needed. I've even added meatballs or Italian sausage to it and it tastes amazing. A family favorite!

This was incredibly easy, and very good in taste, color, and consistency. I substituted agave syrup for the brown sugar, but otherwise made it just as directed.

Had to tweak to use what I had available in a pinch, but turned out awesome!

I didn't have any garlic cloves, so I used the refrigerated jarred kind (3 tsp.). I also didn't have any "tomato puree" so I used one can (15 oz) of tomato sauce and one can (12 oz) of tomato paste along with the 29 oz can of crushed tomatoes. I did end up using 3 tbsp. brown sugar to take away the bitterness caused by the tomato paste, also. I did NOT add any oil to the recipe either. 

Turned out great and I made two pizzas with it and have LOTS left over for probably four more pizzas.

This was a very easy to prepare pizza sauce - and very good!  I cooked it down too far so I added 1/2 can of tomato sauce.  It covered 2 large pizza crusts perfectly.  I might cut the brown sugar to only 1 TBL next time, but I'll definitely use this as my "go to" pizza sauce recipe.

This was really good, added additional garlic (jar garlic) and froze the remaining sauce.   I used the additional freezer sauce much later and it froze well.

perfecto!  I was craving pizza bagels and didn't have any pizza sauce, but I did have a can of crushed tomatoes.  I will NEVER use the store bought pizza sauce again.  Also a tip, I didn't use the can of tomato paste and it was still delicious.

So I tried this sauce and absolutely love it! The only changes I made were about 2 tbs of fresh basil and added fresh parsley. I did use a bit more garlic (I love garlic). I was only able to make 16oz (5 tomatoes) of crushed tomatoes. I used roma tomatoes and I used sea salt.

I made this EXACTLY as stated and it was delish.  However, my Haitian husband likes spicy food so I added oregano, cooked hot italian sausage to the sauce, and increased the red pepper then allowed it to simmer on the stove while I prepared my pizza dough.  I added crush herbs to the dough as well.

This is great!  I didn't have tomato puree, so I used my cuisinart to puree two cans of diced tomatoes.  I also didn't have any crushed tomatoes, so I used the cuisinart again to chop another two cans of diced tomatoes to a desirable consistency.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a T and it was great!  I did have to cook it longer than a half hour to cook down the juices.  This would also be great on pasta.  Yum!  (*Note: this is a mild sauce and some may prefer to up the seasonings).

This is my staple pizza sauce and I absolutely love it.  It makes a lot, so I use the leftovers on pasta as well.  The only thing I do is add more red pepper flakes and basil.  I also like to add oregano, I usually just add all this to-taste.  I have not made any other pizza sauce since.

Made this sauce twice and love it ! I find it much more flavorful if you allow it to marinate a day or 2. Last time I made it I used tomato paste instead of puree and it made a nice thick sauce.

Very tasty and very easy. The next time, I make it (which I will), using less pizza sauce would help bake the center more.

this sauce is super easy to make and it tastes goodtoo :) although i wouldn't say it is THE best pizza sauce i've ever tasted. i used tomato paste + water instead of puree because i didn't have any puree. it worked great!

Made homemade pizza for the first time using this recipe for the sauce. It was too sweet for pizza sauce and tasted funny. maybe ok for chicken cacciatore or something, but not for pizza.

Scaled down to 3 servings to equal 8 oz. Too many spices for my taste but I'm sure if I increased the tomatoes, this would make a great breadstick sauce. Used this sauce to make Pizza on the Grill I off AR.

Absolutely, positively delish!!!!  I did make it a little sweeter by adding more brown sugar.  Husband (who is very picky) absolutely loved it!  Used fresh tomatoes from our garden and topped with yellow pepper and red onion (from our garden) and ground pork less 33% fat (that I got free with a coupon).  So good, he wants it again tomorrow night, lol.  I cut the recipe down to 5 servings and I have enough for probably 1.5+ pizzas.... This is a keeper!!!!

5 Stars, delicious and easy to make.  Great flavor.  Very satisfied with this sauce.   There is maybe 4 cups left over.  Just refrigerate and use again for more pizza or over pasta.

Really good sauce. Will need to add some tomato paste to thicken it up a little. I added a little extra red pepper, too much for the kids, but with the added tomato paste next time, won't matter. Will do again!

I used garlic flavored paste and crushed tomatoes.  I also put 3 whole fresh basil leaves in the pan while the sauce simmerred and removed them after cooking.  Cooked it for my Italian boyfriend and it passed the test!

Yummy!  But, for the tomato puree, I used half tomato sauce and half ketchup ... it gave it a sweetness that my S.O. likes a lot ... really good ... thanks!

Holy Cow this was good stuff.
My Boyfriend says this is the best pizza sauce ever. I substituted a can of tomato paste for the tomato puree.

Good pizza sauce will definitely make again. I also had enough so I added it to the classic lasagna sauce which gave it a little more flavor.

My husband loved this sauce.  He had been after me to make homemade pizza but does not like a sauce with alot of oregano and this was it.  Even the kids really liked it.  We froze the extra and cant wait to use it again.  I did leave out the brown sugar since he does not like a sweet sauce and it was still excellant.
