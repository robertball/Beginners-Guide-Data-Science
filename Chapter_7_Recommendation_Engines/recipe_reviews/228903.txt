This was really great! The kids and the hubby all liked it. I didn't have any crescent rolls on hand so I used Flat Out Lavash bread that's in a big rectangle and it worked pretty well as a quick substitute. I bet the crescent rolls would be even better.

Added ground beef with taco seasoning, and it was okay but needed a little extra "kick"- will make again but will add some peppers or spices.

Yum, this is what I do when I have leftover taco meat from taco night.  Adding the meat is the only difference.

I don't like beans but this was excellent.  Hubby liked it too.  We love cheese though so added a lot more.

I used large burrito tortillas, but it was great.  Easy & so quick.  I used leftover taco beef from yesterday, and it was such a convenient way to make the most of leftovers.

It is so easy and quick. A family favorite. I added chopped black olives and sometimes sliced avocados at the end if i have them.

I used a can of hot enchilada sauce kind of by accident. I didn't have regular in the house. Oops. I realized it and thought my two kids would think everything was too spicy and so I reduced the amount of sauce by about half. I spread just enough to look kind of red on the beans. I also added taco meat. It was very easy to assemble. I do think it was a bit heavy on the bean flavor. My family thought it was decent and they didn't use sour cream or salsa on it like I did. I ate the leftovers cold and really liked that. My biggest complaint was that the pizza crust tasted "biscuit" like. I will try another brand next time or make my own pizza dough.
