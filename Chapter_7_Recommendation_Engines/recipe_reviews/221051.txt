Other than adding a little salt/pepper, I made no changes. I really enjoyed these--this was great for me because I'm eating low carb. Horseradish adds great flavor with NO carbs. I have to admit I ate all four "horsey eggs" myself. This one's a keeper for me.

Made the Horseradish Sauce from AR for this recipe.  I did add some salt & white pepper, and was satisfied with the way these deviled eggs turned out.

I've also made this simple deviled egg recipe (with 30 eggs!) for years using fresh mayo & horseradish. The recipe earned me the nickname "queen of the deviled eggs". I usually top them with green dill weed but for Christmas, I sprinkle them with the green dill weed & smoked red paprika which makes them very festive and delicious! Always a hit and not an egg left over...

A few changes: added some mayo, a little yellow mustard, salt & pepper, a pinch of the Horseradish. Came out wonderful! Topped it with paprika for a little color.

I made it using homemade creamy horseradish sauce (recipe found right here on All Recipes) rather than the store bought kind. The deviled eggs had a hearty taste to it, but I felt like there was something missing. I just wish I could even begin to grasp what this "something" could be. I could then suggest a little add-on for improving the recipe, so that it is as close to perfection as possible.
