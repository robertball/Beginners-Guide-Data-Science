Excellent as is - without the icing. These bake up with a soft inside. I included the chopped pecans, but sans the raisins. They were a big hit.

Disappointing. The cookies turned out dry and tough and bland; I couldn't taste the spice, even though I added an extra tablespoon halfway through, and the flour overwhelmed the trace sweetness. I did substitute yoghurt for the buttermilk, but I don't think that this is the problem. :(

These turned out well! Soft and tasty. You jsut have to make sure they don't bake too long. I added some extra spices - maybe twice as much cinnamon (and I didn't have cloves so I did nutmeg instead). I'd like to try them frosted - maybe with a flavored frosting, because they do have a fairly mild taste.
