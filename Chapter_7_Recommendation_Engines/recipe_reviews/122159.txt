I made this for dinner tonight and my husband LOVED it! The patties were moist and flavorful. He said you can't even tell that it's oven baked. I didn't have cornflakes so I used Rice Krispie cereal instead and it worked out fine. This recipe is a definite keeper! Thanks!

Very delicious!  They tasted similar to my favorite meatloaf, only a lot more moist and a lot less time to make.  :)

So delicious for something so simple! I used Head Country barbecue sauce and a little more than called for since the bottle only had a spoonful or two left anyway. Very moist patties, very nice flavor. My husband commented on how good this was. Thanks!

The patties came out very moist. I used saltines instead of corn flakes (maybe fewer than called for) and added a couple handfuls of shredded cheese. Delicious!

This was a great and simple recipe for burgers! I accidentally added in the whole 1/2 cup of bbq sauce while mixing the ground beef, and topped the patties with a light coating and they tasted delicious! I also added in minced onion and topped with shredded cheese. The burgers were moist and tasted better than done on the grill! Will def make again!

These were pretty tasty for a quick meal - I followed the directions exactly except that I also added 1c of shredded cheddar cheese to the meat mixture and formed the mixture into 16 meatballs instead of 4 patties.

These are good for a weeknight dinner.  Not quite as good as my favorite meatloaf (I prefer ketchup and brown sugar over BBQ sauce.)  I also think these would benefit from a little bit of onion.  I too used saltines in place of cereal.

The flavor and ease of this recipe is great. However they fell apart on the bbq. Looking at the picture now I didn't make balls of meat I flattend them into patties.

Nice and easy meal to prepare.  The flavor was good, not great.  I used cracker crumbs in place of the corn flakes.

Very tender. I think these were better in the oven than on the grill. Only suggestion, cut back on the bbq sauce. Quite powerful.
