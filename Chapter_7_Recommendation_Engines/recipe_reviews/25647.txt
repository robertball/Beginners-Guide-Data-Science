Everyone loved these, they were easy to make, and really good. The only thing is that I'm Canadian, and I don't know the conversions too well, so I put a little much of the condensed milk, I'd suggest to pour a little, then mix, and keep pouring until desired consistancy. Happy eating...mmmmm...

I have a recipe very similar to this and I thought I could add a few suggestions based on other readers comments.  Instead of rolling in additional coconut, roll in powdered sugar - works great and costs less!  Also, you can leave these out overnight covered with a tea towel to "dry out" and they won't be mushy as they are when you first roll them.  One more thing...I think these are sweet enough without brown sugar.  Great recipe -  I was surprised but happy to find a version on this site for comparison!

I made these with chopped pecans and very little brown sugar. In fact, I think the sugar can be omitted entirely! I froze them overnight before serving -- they're fine right out of the freezer or thawed.

Taste-wise, these are great.  But they are very messy to make. I needed far more coconut than the recipe called for; I ran out and had to throw away about 1/3 of the apricot mix.  Perhaps less condensed milk would make these easier.

This is a wonderfully different candy treat. If you're tired of serving the same old Christmas confections, try this! My first batch was really good. The second time, I experimented: for some texture I added 1/3 cup of toasted finely chopped pecans in with the apricot/milk mixture, then rolled them in toasted coconut. Yummy both ways!

The canned milk made this recipe runny. I think the next time I make this recipe will use only half of the canned milk. and cut the brown sugar in half. It is quite sweet.

After reading the reviews, I added less condensed milk; deleted sugar;  rolled balls in crushed VANILLA WAFERS.  This is a healthy treat.

This is a delicious recipe and is soooo easy and quick to make. But I agree with the other reviews - watch the amount of condensed milk - add it gradually until you have the right consistency.
These were a hit at my house!

A tip to make these much easier to roll is to dip your fingertips in a little bit of water as needed and you will be able to roll really easily!! To sweet, use less sugar! but very good.

Apart from taking quite a few hours to get firm in the fridge, they are very sweet and tasty, although the mixture is very gooey when "shaping" into balls and I found that I used quite a bit more shredded (or flaked) coconut to roll them in. Also, just in case there's any confusion (as I found it confusing with conversions!) the 395ml can of condensed milk, halved, is more than enough!

Very yummy and easy! I chopped apricots,  california figs, and sliced almonds in a blender, and mixed it all with some of the coconut and just enough condensed milk to make it stick. Then I rolled it in chopped almonds/coconut for a slightly crunchy exterior - they're super sweet so I didn't add any sugar. And they definitely taste better cold :)

So easy and a welcomed addition to my annual array of Christmas goodies!  I made the recipe exactly as shown, but added some graham cracker crumbs (about 1/4 cup) to the mixture to make it a bit more workable, and I have to say it was delicious cut the sweetness a bit.  I rolled them very small (1/3 inch)and then rolled half in coconut, and the other half in graham cracker crumbs to add a bit of variety.

These were delicious!! i was a bit unsure about the amount of condensed milk, so just added a bit at a time until the mixture seemed right - i'm so glad i didn't pour the whole can in!!
otherwise fantastic.

Very quick and easy to make.  My 5 boys ALWAYS want dessert or at least something sweet to eat so I need quick and easy and this is a perfect after dinner treat.  In my Cuisinart I started with all the dried apricots I had on hand (about 1 1/2C) as thse were processing I added my coconut, some almonds and then poured in the SC milk until I had the right consistency.  I omitted the sugar all together but rolled them in sprinkles and coconut.  This would work well with dates, too.

Great recipe.  I don't like pecans (as someone else had used) so I added about half a cup chopped almonds.  This is a bit messy to make but delicious and a fantastic find for when it's too hot to use my oven.

Delicious. BUT! These are a sticky, gooey mess that's impossible to roll into balls if the recipe is followed. I wish I had read the reviews, but I printed the recipe years ago and was working from it. Entirely too much condensed milk! I had to double the coconut, and still had to refrigerate before making into very soft balls. I am disappointed in this recipe for these reasons, but the flavor is great. I added 1/4 tsp almond extract to enhance the apricot flavor. This is not enough liquid to make these as gooey as they are. Just add 1/2 the amount of condensed milk then add the rest only as needed.
