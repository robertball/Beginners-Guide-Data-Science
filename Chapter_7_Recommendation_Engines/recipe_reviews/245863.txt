I made this as is and it was awesome. I also made another batch and added fresh cilantro, chopped poblano, shredded cheddar and garlic. It was so tasty and delicious! And so quick and easy. I used the leftover stuffing to make quesadillas, with more cheese added of course.

The taste of the chicken avocado mixture baked was fantastic! Two problems I encountered: 1. This might fit into 8 avocado halves, but it is not 8 servings!  My family of 5 was still hungry after finishing this off!  This recipe might feed 3 people well. 2. The avocado shells had an odd smell after being baked in the oven. This recipe might have been better with the chicken avocado mixture baked in a baking dish instead.

EASY and TASTY! Husband loved it! I did as was suggested and put the overflow of chicken mixture into a carved out tomato, and both the tomato and avocado were fantastic. I also used mozzarella cheese instead of parmesan because that's what I had on hand. I would have preferred to heated it longer in the oven ... but it still tasted great. We will repeat this fast and easy dish for sure.

To make on a cookie sheet, simply slice a half dollar sized circle on the bottom of the avocado skin on the bottom to keep them in place!

My family really enjoyed this meal. I made some omission/substitutions. My ingredient list:
1 precooked rotisserie chicken (skin removed & deboned). 1 can no salt added diced tomatoes, drained (that’s what I had on hand). 4oz cream cheese. Colby jack cheese (that’s what I had on hand). I omitted ALL seasonings for dietary reasons. I completely shelled the avacodos & used the skins as bowls. 

Like others, i added cheese AFTER baking stuffed avacodos for 10mins. Then topped with cheese & broiled for 5mins. 

There was still ALOT of mixture left & will probably use in red bell peppers tomorrow.

I had eaten baked avocados at a local Mexican restaurant and fell in love with them.  I came across this recipe and hoped it would compare.  RICH, CREAMY, SATISFYING dish.  I did bake them in the avocado shell with the shells nestled in muffin tray.  The next day I had some left over and they looked a little dry so I spread a dollop of french onion dip.  Oh my, this really kicked it up a notch!  I think next time I make these I will add some of the french onion dip and cilantro as well. 
Finally, this fits into a low carb/keto diet with fat 25.2, protein 20.1, and carbs at 9.4.
Great recipe!

These were great! I made as written and they came out perfectly. I was very much impressed with how green the avocado stayed even after baking. You could put any type of chicken mixture you wanted in these to suit your taste.  Great recipe!

This is great way to use leftover chicken, wonderful flavor.  Next time I’m going to mix the parmesan cheese in with the other ingredients.   Just topping with the cheese it forms a delightful crunchy topping, but it gets eaten in one bite!

I loved it!!! I added some garlic powder, about half a teaspoon, and it really enhanced the flavor of the avocado.

Great recipe, easy to make. Would definitely recommend it. It's also great for a make ahead meal, but you should either take out of the fridge early or bake it a little longer to get it hot after it's been in the fridge a while.

AMAZINGLY GOOD!!!! I was worried that I could not keep my hands off of it even before adding the chicken.  SO good. I told my sister at one point it tasted like lasagna...I seasoned my chicken with other spices than the ones listed. This was the absolute best dish I have gotten from this site. EVER!!!

We love avocados and chicken so this recipe was perfect for picky eaters. It was very easy to make and tasted pretty good (a little bland).  Some changes I made were: rotisserie chicken, canned diced tomatoes with green peppers and onions, and Colby Jack cheese. Definitely going to try again and maybe add some recommended spices.

I’m sure the original recipee is great as it, however we scooped out all the avocado, put the grated Parmesan cheese into the mixture and added garlic and green onion. After cooking for 10 minutes we put grated mozzarella on top and cooked them an additional 5 minutes.  We stuffed several red pepper halves with the extra mixture and they were the most popular. Great recipee!

Made this several times now as I love avocados and always looking for fun ways to use them.  First as written.  Excellent! Next I used less cheese and added in a bunch of garlic and lots of fresh chopped cilantro and a squeeze of lime.  Now I did take the avocados out of the shell before baking and set in a lightly oiled glass baking dish.

Nope, nope and noper. Cream cheese is a little weird and it's a total waste of avocados.

We loved it!  The only thing I did differently was bake it longer, about 20 minutes total.  This warmed the chicken and avocado.

This recipe is definitely worth trying. I added cheese on top of mine, I enjoyed them. They were not great as leftovers though. I wouldn’t make more than I needed at one time.

I made the recipe as written the first time and it was a success but not a rave hit. Still kids ate it and they are pretty picky. Second time added cilantro, jalapenos ( just a little) and chopped onions on top. used pepperjack cheese and topped with crumbs  toasted.  Now it got raves

Its tough to find a recipe that is easy, affordable and healthy. This hits the mark and is delicious too! I used 6 avocados, 1.5 lbs chicken thighs to save $, 6 oz cream cheese, 1/3 cup diced tomatoes. YUM!

I made this with crab and followed the recipe except no tomato (because my husband doesn't like).  We found that the cream cheese seemed to overpower the delicate crab flavor.  We think it is a good "base" and I will make it again and try some different ingredients - maybe mayo instead of cream cheese, ad sauteed onion, celery, maybe some Old Bay...

Couldn't be easier to make and the filling is just delicious.  I did find however, that eating them after they are baked was not my favorite way to enjoy an avocado.  GREAT for the first few bites, but super rich and filling -- it was like too much of a good thing.   I think such a rich filling needs to be in a something lighter, like maybe tartlets?    Or...the filling (unbaked) would be nice on thin bread slices as an appetizer.

I was excited to make this, especially with all the positive reviews. Unfortunately, the family did not enjoy it. I thought it was just 'ok'. Overall, the flavor is very bland. Adding extra seasoning helped some, but we were still not thrilled. Maybe some variation of this would be a good side dish.

I loved it so much i took pictures and put on FB. Everyone wanted the recipe.  The only thing i did different was i couldn't figure out how to fit an avocado half in my muffin cup?? I simply made boats out of foil and that worked perfectly. My cheese melted but didn't brown so i turned on the broiler for just a minute with the door open and they browned nicely. I'll be making them again and again!

I made the original recipe mixture and felt there was ZERO flavor, unless plain chicken flavor is your thing. That's where the 2 star rating comes in.  So I immediately went into modification mode. I added extra salt, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, a full limes worth of juice, and a 1/8 tsp of habanero pepper to the mix. I then topped it with pepper jack cheese in the last 5 min. of cooking. Turned out awesome. The whole family loved them.

I added minced garlic, cilantro and cobly jack cheese, it was delicious. I made some with chicken and some with Beef Chorizo. This is a great low carb recipe, I just had to share it with my friends.

I followed the recipe exactly. I found it to include too much cream cheese, and I personally feel the chicken should cubed and not shredded. Shredding is fine for tacos, but not for something you eat with a fork. I also believe the recipe shouldn't call for leaving some of the meat in the avocado shell, it should all be included in the mixture. There are other personal changes I'm going to make the next time I make it that don't apply to my opinion of the recipe as written. For one thing I'm going to try it with cheddar and Monterey jack cheese instead of Parmesan, much less cream cheese, and I'm going to top it with some bread crumbs.

I made exactly as written and it was really very good and pretty to easy to make.  My husband loved it too.  I did what another reviewer recommended and I just sliced a little off the bottom of each avocado and they sat nice and flat in my baking pan. The only thing I would change is I would increase the cooking time to 20 minutes and hold off topping with the Parmesan cheese until it has cooked for 10 min or so. Otherwise, this is a definite keeper!

Wonderful flavor and so easy/fast to make if you are using left over chicken.
Next time I will go heavier on the chicken though as it was just a touch too creamy.

Mm-mmmm! 3 out of 4 picky family members liked these. I used salsa for the tomatoes and we like spice so I added some chopped jalapeño, cumin, and chipotle hot sauce. Also used cheddar instead of Parmesan. No matter, you can play with the flavors, but I think these would be yummy any way you like!

The first time I made it I followed the recipe.  To us it was bland.  The next time I added dry Taco seasoning to the chicken, cream cheese and tomatoes.  I also added garlic and onion powder and some worcestershire sauce.  Mixed all together, topped with Mexican Blend cheese.  These were great.  I love the idea of the stuffed and baked avocado.  Preparation is quick.

One of the best recipes from this site so far. First time I am reviewing. Easy recipe and very flavorful. It is rich so I filled up quickly. Made it as written, one very small change added a small amount of grated Parmesan in the mix and used shredded for the top. Big hit.

I followed one of the suggestions and added garlic and Parmesan cheese in mixture.  I made it in a glass baking dish and added cheddar cheese in top (per a suggestion).

These are excellent. I made it pretty much according to the directions and only added some smoked paprika on top just before baking. 
I can't wait to make the seafood version.

Delish !   Edit a few tablespoons of mayonnaise to the cream cheese mixture and seasoned it with about a quarter teaspoon of dill mix and Mrs. Dash chicken salt free seasoning. Just sprayed muffin cups and added  Scoops of  chicken mixture Dash cook for 10 minutes in oven and serve on a bed of chopped lettuce and cabbage.

This was pretty good but I did add some cumin, garlic and cilantro.  I don't use salt much and rely other herbs and spices for my food.  Served it with a 3 grain rice pilaf to which I added carrots, onions and celery.

Took a while for the parmesan cheese to melt so next time I will just mix it into the mixture.  Also, used a few spoonfuls of Rotel rather than a tomato.  Added extra flavor and spice.

I wasn’t crazy about it, but my company loved it!  Might make it again but I would try to find a substitute for the cream cheese

Not too bad.  i had green onions to use before they got bad so in they went.  this would make a great dip if you didn't feel like stuffing the avocados. home grown toms. would certainly up the flavor.

The first time Imade this, I made it exactly according to directions. It was really delicious, but it had a little bit of a bitter taste. The next time I made it, I added a little extra cheese and garlic powder, and I didn't stuff the avocado shells. I just put the stuffing in a casserole dish. It was amazing! I bet it would be really good as a tomato or pepper stuffing, too. Definitely a keeper!

I wanted to love this...I really did.  I followed the exact recipe.  It’s bland, needed more salt and texture.  It is easy to make. That being said, the stuffing would make a great dip with some salty chips, salsa and topped with fresh avocado slices   That’s how I’ll use it going forward.

Super delicious! I added onions, a large tablespoon of jalapeño artichoke dip, and topped with a soft white garlic cheese! It is rich and delicious and will definitely make again using a few other tweaks depending on how I cook the chicken.

Actually made this last night as I am working on helping my wife transition into a Keto lifestyle. 
Made a few tweaks and made it with SHRIMP! 
So to the basic recipe I added:
1. 1/4 cup Radish chopped small
2. 1/4 cup Zucchini chopped small
3. 1 Tbs of Apple Cider vinegar

The radish and zucchini add a crunchy texture since they don't cook as much and the vinegar just a hint of tartness for the seafood.
The Shrimp were chopped in a rough chop, chunky but not whole shrimp so that every bite had some shrimp.
My wife loves Lobster Thermidor and she just devoured these. I think I have a convert!
It was pretty cool to bake the avocados, never had done it before and the texture is creamy and warm, nice.
Hope you enjoy my tweaks.
JC

I thought this was tasty if a little bland. I think I'd add more spices next time, and maybe some kind of crunch element. The servings size is definitely a bit small for my liking. It's also less calories than what is estimated here (the only difference is I may have had smaller avocados). I ate double the serving for 414 calories.

OK -- I am not a terrific cook and this recipe is easy and fantastic.  The big change is that I used ( sorry real cooks) - light chive cream cheese and it melted just fine.  And - I have made it with the chicken, but also made it other times and substituted the chicken with tuna (took out the salt) and veggie burger crumble - fabulous! 
Only obvious warning - the avocados do have to be soft - the short oven time is not enough to soften them...

I put the mixture on slices of French bread instead of the avocado shells. Petty good for a Sunday lunch. I’d add more spice or fresh herbs, maybe some capers.

Great brunch item.  Did it without cayenne as I didn't have any.  Probably could have used Tabasco or similar.  Filling and tasty.  Interesting texture.  Used a lemon-pepper rotisserie chicken.  Will make again. Thx for this recipe!

It was a lot of work with some great ingredients for such mediocre results. My whole family was disappointed, and they all love chicken and avocados. Not going to make this again.

It was okay - made as directed - but found it a little bland. Will try again and add onions, reduce the cream cheese, and try some cilantro

I used very good ripe tiny Roma tomatoes and they added a lot of flavour

Oh... Yum!!! Made this for the first time and it got rave reviews from everyone! Plus there is filling left over for quesadillas. I used salsa instead of chopped tomatoes, and pepper jack instead of Parmesan. Bought cilantro but forgot to add it. It would be good either way! This will be a regular at our house!

I changed one thing. I used a roaster chicken rather than pre-cut breasts. It was easy to put together and was SPECTACULAR. My family loved it, I loved it and it is now in the rotation. Thank you!

We   liked this.  A couple kids wouldn't eat it though. They liked the filling so  maybe make extra and cook on a small baker separate from the avocados.

I made as written and it was very good. Something different to do with avocados, however it was very rich.  Maybe next time I’ll use sour cream instead of cream cheese.

I made the recipe as is, with a few exceptions. I cooked the mixture in a shallow baking dish and topped it with ½ Parmesan and ½ mozzarella. I ran out of parm and had some mozzarella. I also baked some corn tortilla bowls separately, the. scooped the mixture into the bowls. This is a very good recipe.

These are fabulous. I switch up a few things.  I uses the chicken broth from chicken and square colored peppers, green onions,tomatoes. Added a little extra cayenne pepper. I also mixed a little Monterey Jack cheese with the cream cheese. I would definitely make again.

Don't make more than you will eat that evening as these as any avocado dish does not keep long in the fridge. Fresher was definitely better.

LOVED this. Baking chicken ahead makes it quick to throw together at dinner time. I seasoned the chicken (when baking) and chicken mixture with a Trader Joe’s everyday seasoning, which has salt, pepper, and chili pepper, as well as garlic, onion, and coriander. Goes really well with the flavors. I also added cayenne as written and accidentally over “dashed”. Turned out spicier than I planned, but was delicious! Ate with tortilla chips. I put the excess filling in a side dish and baked alongside the rest for my 2yo. She loved it, even with the extra cayenne!

Very good! Used canned chicken and fresh mozzarella (tiny cubes) in place of cream cheese  since that's what I had on hand.  Wonderful taste and will make again.

I wish I had taken a picture - it was pretty!  I had two lemon chicken thighs left over from dinner the night before and a big avocado, so it was a great way to use them for lunch the next day.  Very tasty!  All Recipes.com makes it easy to adjust the recipe for 2 servings. I put them both in an oval ramekin to bake.

Destiny0173,  I enjoyed your recipe very much, I changed a few things to accommodate my own taste, I used Cream Cheese with Chiives and green onions and minced garlic., just tasting the left over filling prior to placing in the oven...Wow! "party in my mouth" Thank you, so much I also think as oven temperature vary the next time I think I will increase oven temperature until I find what works. Amazing recipe.

Way better than expected. This is like a millennial's version of a baked potato ?? Everything came out super tasty. Two things to know, the size of the avocado might make using a muffin tray hard so either get big avocados or just toss some tinfoil over the tray. Let the avocado rest in the covered muffin holes where the tinfoil sags on the tray and you are all set. And the second is that these have a short life after cooking so if you have leftovers I recommend using them up fast.

I added lime juice and fresh cilantro and a Mexican blend cheese. My husband absolutely loved it. He puts ketchup on everything but didn’t on this. Shocker! I thought it needed additional spices which I will try next time. A definite keeper.

This was good if you follow the recipe exactly.  My wife loved it, but my daughter did not.  Next time I will probably remove all of the avocado to  mix with the other ingredients.  Also want to spice it up a bit.

Delicious, took about 25 minutes at 400 degrees because I prepped the night before and had everything in the fridge. I loved it. My guests however weren’t impressed for some reason but I really don’t know why because this was so good

This is a great recipe. I made only one change. Instead of a pinch of cayenne, I used a good sprinkle of chipotle which added a little kick. Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing. There are only two of us, so I cut the recipe in half, as well, but I will be making this for our ladies monthly dinner. I know it will be a hit because we all love avocados.

Yum!  I did a half-recipe for 2 people and had one left over since we had plenty of sides. I used cheddar cheese... some mixed in, but mostly on top. Then, I topped generously with Parmesan/Romano. Delicious!

Great recipe! We will definitely make this again in our house hold. However, I do think it takes longer than 18 minutes for it to be completed. Shredding the chicken takes a long time to me. Also, I would buy 8 avocados next time since it seemed to make two batches, but I had large chicken breasts.

I must have had especially large chicken breasts because I only used 1 (half)  from a package of 2.  Otherwise I made no changes.  I would make it again.  My husband and I liked it very much and found it unusual in a of pasta and cheese.

Delicious! I mashed the avocado coarsely, and added more seasonings because that's my preference, but otherwise made as directed. I agree with reviewers who said the serving numbers are off, unless it's being used as an appetizer or salad course. If a main course, probably serves half the number specified. But it's a keeper of a recipe!

I did make a couple of changes (sorry).  Added 1/2 tsp garlic powder; used mostly mozzarella with some Romano.  Scooped all avocado out and mixed all together (cheese too, which was a mistake, but turned out fantastic)!  Served to company and all of us gave it high reviews! Oh did leave in oven for close to 20 minutes to heat through, and it browned some too!

I made it by the recipe. I doubled it and used canned diced tomatoes and a few shakes of garlic powder. It was delicious.  No leftovers!!!!  We will be adding this to our meal rotation.

Great recipe! Made it with both Parmesan cheese and some with Monterey Jack cheese. Looking forward to trying it with crab instead of chicken.

This was good!  I used a pre-cooked, mesquite-grilled breast fillet and a shade more chipotle chile powder than I intended, and it was very flavorful.  My husband and I had a half avocado to start with, and we both ended up eating the other half because it was so good.

Loved it!!! My husband and I each had 2 halves  since they  were small avocados. But there is plenty of filling leftover. Will try it in quesadillas. Add some garlic powder and it will be perfect! Thanks for sharing!

I made it, I added a couple tablespoons for salsa, some cilantro and jalapenos.  It was awesome.  I would use monteray jack on top instead of parm, the parmesan gets hard and difficult to cut through

Was a hit. Had some bruschetta allready made up so used that and used the meat off chicken wings from the night before. Put in a little blender diced them up with cream cheese and topped with cheddar till it melted. Quick easy filling.

Excellent! Instead of cream cheese, I substituted Kite Hill almond ricotta cheese. Also, made it with crab instead of chicken--added green onions and tomatoes. Perfect!!!!

I use to get something like this at a Mexican Restaurant and loved it.  They closed the restaurant because the rent went up too high.  I really missed these.  BUT...now I can make them at home!  I used extra chicken and replaced the parmesan  cheese with shredded Mexican 3 cheeses instead.  My entire family loved them.  I will definitely be making these a lot.  Thanks for sharing.

I served this at Super Bowl last night.  I ate one, was very unimpressed, so didn’t recommend it.  No taste, like eating mashed avocado.  Needs spicing up.

I would definitely make this again with just a little less cream cheese. I had to broil it for 2 minutes after baking to get the Parmesan cheese to fully melt. But....it was really good!!!!

I had left over chicken curry so I mixed that with avocado, topped it with cheese and baked it.  Easy, fast and satisfying recipe.  Will make it again.

Yes ma'am! I used Rotel tomatoes with chilies and sprinkled a little mozzarella on the tip with the parmesan. It took about fourteen minutes instead of the recommended time. Don't use the small hass avocados if you don't have to.

Oh my word! I made this today, without the tomatoes and subbed in canned chicken. I added a little bit of shredded cheddar to the mixture. It was so delicious!!!! My husband really liked it, and he is quite picky. I will definitely add this to weekly meal plan. Thank you so much!

Easy and flavorful! Grilled the chicken breasts with a jalapeño olive oil and used a bit of cumin in the "stuffing". Everyone loved it and prep time was pretty minimal for a meal with such a fun presentation. I can see this becoming a staple.

I did not make any changes to the recipe, I thought it was very delicious the only reason I gave it a 3-star is because it needs something crunchy in it to separate the mushy. I added a side of cold snap peas

Loved it! But would add more seasoning and more tomato next time. The tomato is needed to break up the creamy, heaviness of the avocado. Also, rotisserie chicken is great to use!

Sub'd crab and added mushroom and onions. I sauteed mushrooms and onion before adding to other ingredients in bowl.
I liked and my husband loved.
I'll probably stir in some Parmesan to the ingredients in addition to placing on top of the boats. 
I used crinkled foil instead of muffin tins which is always a great substitute to stabilize rounded objects.

I too cut up the avocado, mixed it with the chicken and baked it in casserole dish for 25 mins.  This dish needs CRUNCH! Next time I will top with slivered almonds.

This recipe is a good basic recipe and easy to adjust for your family's taste. Perfect for Keto eaters. I think to remove the "bland" taste some reviewers noted, you have to use a good flavored chicken. We grilled chicken with a lime chili rub. I chopped one fresh tomato into it. Basing it off of previous reviews, I added garlic powder.  Even before I added the chicken (waiting for it to come off the grill), I tossed the ingredients in Dinah (my kitchenaid mixer) and let her mix it slowly. I taste-tested (because I hadn't measured anything) and that mix was delicious! I did not have leftover mix...perhaps I piled it higher than other reviewers or maybe it was because I didn't measure and just dumped or perhaps because I ate it while waiting for the chicken to arrive! I baked for 10 minutes, took it out and then added the parmesan and baked for 10 minutes more, then broiled for a couple to create a better cheesy crust. My husband, who was very hesitant about having baked avocado, loved it. Next time, I will add red onion and perhaps a grilled chili to the mix. Thanks for sharing.

Loved.. but is it because of changes? Only used two avocados because picky family.  Added garlic powder and since no green onion added onion powder.-about 1/2 t cayenne and a bit more salt then called for. Blended a little extra sharp cheddar in mixture and topped with thin slice of extra sharp. No Parmesan. I would have loved more avocado but family loved with less. Hey if they will eat avocado this way- has to be a winner. Tomatoes- family not a big fan but next time will add a few more- but have to be quality tomatoes. Thank you for a great base recipe that has lots of options to change this up the way you like it. I loved it cold before cooking too...

These were SO SIMPLE to make and tasted great!!  My BF said he wasn't overly hungry and was only going to eat 1/2 of an avocado - until he got a bite in his mouth... when he finished that first half, he went right in and grabbed the second half.  This will definitely become a "go-to" meal for us!!

I didn't make this exactly as described. I thought I had chicken breasts in the freezer, but learned when I got home that I did not. So I used some pork shoulder I had left over from a couple of days earlier. I also estimated the quantities of ingredients - I halved the recipe and have a pretty good eye for measurement.  I also made a mistake and put Parmesan cheese in the avocado mixture...so I went with it and put some on top too. These turned out fantastic! I cannot imagine that my pork substitution and cheese oops dramatically changed the taste. As a single guy, I have a hard time finding good meals I can cook for 1 or 2 people, but this certainly met that criteria and was absolutely amazing. I will definitely have it again! Next time I may add bacon to the mixture and I'll only put the Parmesan on top. There could be a number of variations for this dish to keep it 'new' and yet still so easy. So not only is this easy, versatile and delicious...it's pretty hard to mess up!

This was very easy to make and very quick. I liked it, but made a couple changes due to what I had on hand and likes. I added chili powder vs pepper and cottage cheese vs cream cheese for a less dense texture. I also added garlic powder and chopped onion because I like them and can chicken vs fresh. I also baked it a couple minutes longer because it wasn't done in my oven using their time, (I baked 12 min). It would have been better with fresh chicken, but still very good and fast to make.

Can’t imagine all the good reviews.  I thought this was terrible.  Watered down quacamole with crime cheese. 
Parmesan cheese has a great flavor but it is not a melting cheese.  Sorry.  Won’t make this one again.

I used shredded mozzarella instead of the Parmesan and it was fantastic. Will definitely make this again.

Very satisfying and tasty.  My guy and I (he is a meat and potatoes guy generally) both found it a great little meal.  Just filling enough.  I added a few extra spices, like garlic and paprika and topped each one with chioro Mexican sausage crumbles.  Trying to stay close to Keto diet and this played very nicely into it.  Thanks.

I never thought I would like warm avocado, but this is delicious. And one whole avocado is really a meal.

I substitute one blackened Anaheim or Hatch chile for the tomatoes and cayenne pepper and Pecorino Romano for the Parmesan, doubling the amount and mixing half of it into the mixture.

You will likely have extra filling.  Simply put it into a ramekin and back along with your stuffed avocados.

I didn’t make changes yet, but I thought of some more items to add and it would be a good mixture to add to deviled eggs.

This is tasty! However, it doesn't make great leftovers, as the avocados quickly brown. It still tastes okay to me, but it's definitely better fresh. I used 5 small avocados and I think I would've been better off with 4 large avocados. I had extra chicken mixture left over that I just stuck in its own muffin cup and distributed over the avocados when serving.

This was very new to me and the avocado gives a different flavor I’m not used to, but I love it! I used plain Greek yogurt instead of cream cheese and it gave a sweeter taste, but it’s not overpowering. Love it!!

This was so easy and delicious! I didn’t haven enough Parmesan so I used Monterrey jack on a couple instead and actually ended up liking that better than the ones with Parmesan.

I modified the recipe (see below) to meet the ingredients I had on hand and to make it a little quicker to prepare.  It was amazing and a new favorite!!

*substitute cayenne pepper with Southwest Chipotle seasoning to taste

*substitute Tyson pulled chicken (found in the freezer section of the store; thawed in fridge prior to prepping)

*used Roma tomatoes 

*no salt added

We liked it. I'll make it again but maybe add a touch more salt or some other seasoning. Will also probably make it in a dish instead of the avocado shells.

Delicious. I used fresh crab and it was great. I also used the leftover mix to stuff a tomato and topped it with cheddar(also delish). I think the avocado could be completely removed from the skin depending on how you want to plate the dish. You have so much mix to use I can't see why you would prefer the visual effect of leaving some fruit in the skin vs overstuffing the shell to use up as much mix as possible.

This is such a delicious and versatile recipe. Only used 3 avocado since it was all I had.  Used shrimp sprinkled with garlic salt:cumin (2:1) that I sautéed in a skillet then browned a few green onions once I removed the shrimp from the pan which I minced before adding to the mixture.  No doubt chicken will be amazing too. I put foil in the muffin pan to simplify clean up. Great recipe that I look forward to using chicken in!!

Super easy and really tasty! My husband can be really picky when he wants and he absolutely LOVED them! Typical of anything with fresh avocado though they aren't designed for more than a round maybe two of leftovers.

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, and it is perfect, but I can think of lots of variations I would like to try. Perfect for lunch if you have some leftover chicken to use. I will definitely make this again.

Pretty good if you like avocado. How you prepare the chicken will affect the dish, so choose a style you like.

I wasn't as impressed with this recipe as I thought I'd be based on other reviews. The flavor isn't bad but isn't great either. Maybe using canned chicken or pieces of a rotisserie chicken would be better; this took a while to prepare for something mediocre. There was something about the parmesan cheese I didn't like either; maybe Feta would have been a better choice for me. I like that this is a pretty healthy recipe though, so I gave it a four-star rating. I think I may give it another shot but use rotisserie chicken and different cheese. :)

I would have cooked it a 5-10 minutes without cheese then add the cheese because it wasn't to warm. Also, I like a little extra kick so I added some pepper jack cheese! Yummy

Made this with turkey instead of chicken because I had that on hand. I served it as an appy to my neighbours and they loved it!

I will definitely make it again... and the only change I made was using sour cream instead of cream cheese because it's what I had!
