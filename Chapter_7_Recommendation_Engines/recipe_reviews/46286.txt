This is way too salty.  I would cut the salt by a lot.  And add a rinse of the brine.  My Grandmother's recipe is very similar but it calls for a rinse of the brine after the soak and an additional two hour soak in cold water - rinsing again and then combining the dry ingredients - then wet - pouring over cukes and bringing to a boil.

After you cook in the brine, drain and rinse, rinse, rinse.  I am hoping that the word rinse was left out accidentally in the directions.  If you rinse, this recipe has a really good flavor.  I used white vinegar and it worked great.

Way too salty, and the use of apple cider vinegar and pearl onions made it much more expensive to make than my usual recipe (which uses diced onions and white vinegar).  Perhaps it would improve it to cut the salt back a bit or to rinse the veggies off after they've been soaked.

Wish I had read the reviews first. Needs rinsed or less salt. I wasted time, money and good produce! :(

I agree that this recipe needs rinsing however I did not find the pickles to be inedible. I believe this would be a five star recipe if careful rinsing was included in the directions.

So disappointing.  I read the reviews so I rinsed and rinsed and rinsed some more but still it was too salty.

Wow, I really wished I had read the reviews before making. WAY,WAY,WAY,WAY TOOOOOOOOOOOOOO SALLLLLLTTTTTYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!! We are going to give this batch to  my inlaws (LOL). The mustard sauce tastes great, reminds me of my aunts. We will make again, but will not use nearly as much salt.I will rate next recipe to let everyone know.

This recipe is very similar to MY grandmother's recipe. Instead of all white sugar, she used 1/2 white and 1/2 golden brown sugar. There is also one ingredient missing from this recipe that my grandmother ALWAYS added - her secret ingredient was black pepper seeds. Not many, mind you but a small handful goes a long way in great taste! Loved them!!
