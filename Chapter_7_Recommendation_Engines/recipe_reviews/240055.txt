Glad to find a trifle recipe that doesn’t require whipped topping. I use chocolate instant pudding mix and substitute whole milk for the half and half. Crushed cookies (thin mint or Oreo) work well on top (I don’t use the candy pieces called for). I like this recipe so well that I finally bought a trifle bowl.

Very rich but super delicious! I made it for my sons first communion and it was a huge hit! Even though it was really rich it was easy to keep going back for more!
