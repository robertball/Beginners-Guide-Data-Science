Boy am I glad I tried this recipe despite my initial doubts.  I made my own pizza dough and used halved topping to make a 12" pizza, baked at 400F for 15 minutes and it was perfect.  The avocado and cheese blended really nicely and the cherry tomatos are little pockets of flavor to bite in to.  Will be making this many more times.

The only thing I'd do differently (since I'm using raw pizza dough) is to slightly undercook the chicken first and let it fully cook with the rest of the pizza in the oven, otherwise it's a bit dry.

This was very very good.  I did make a few changes.  I added a small clove of garlic to the advocado mixture.  I also had some bacon bits on hand, so I put them on the pizza.  I also chopped up some roasted red pepper to add.  I think without the pepper, it might not have been as flavorful, thus the 4 stars I gave it.  I also used a full pizza crust (whole wheat) and cooked it in the oven instead of the broiler.  It was awesome.  Thanks for the idea.  Really, you've inspired me, I am going to try a lot of new pizza ideas this way.  Thanks!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!  I have made it a few times and it is always a hit with my family.  I like to mix a little garlic powder in with the avocado mixture.  I also sprinkle dried basil and oregeno on the top of the pizza with the cayenne pepper and I use mozarella cheese.  This ends up looking and tasting like a high-end bistro pizza!  My coworkers couldn't believe I made it and just HAD to have the recipe.  It's just as good the next day as leftovers.  Yum!

My husband and I really enjoyed this pizza, what a great twist! We crushed garlic into the avocado and cilantro mixture instead of rubbing it on the pizza crust. We also waited until the pizza was done cooking and sliced the tomatoes and put them on top. JUST EXCELLENT!

This was great and did make for a light meal. We paired it with a nice light salad of romaine lettuce, the rest of the cherry tomatoes, some cucumber, and ranch dressing. The pizza looked beautiful and smelled delicious. The only thing is that I felt like it was missing some flavor, and I wanted to add something to give it a little more pizzaz but couldn't put my finger on what was "missing". Next time, I think I will try adding ground cumin or extra cilantro to the avocado mixture. I am also wondering if about half an onion chopped and pureed into the sauce would add some good flavor. I did find the pizza to be more flavorful the next day after the flavors had time to set. I also took advice from other reviewers and used uncooked, readymade dough for the crust. Added the ingredients to the uncooked crust and baked in oven for about 20 minutes at 400 degrees. Came out beautifully. Will definitely make again, just adding some extra flavors. Thanks for the recipe! My girlfriend loved it and was impressed :)

DELISH! I expanded on the recipe just a teensy bit. First, i cooked the chicken with a rub using cayenne powder, garlic salt, and sugar (pretty much whatever i had in my spice cabinet!), let it cool, and then shredded it with my hands. I used two 8-9 inch pizza crusts, that were actually cornmeal based. My avocados were a little hard, so i added olive oil and mashed them by hand. It was a bit "chunkier"  -- but i liked it that way! i also added green onions, which i would say is an essential addition! I baked for 7 minutes and then broiled for 3 and voila! This was truely a yummy, unique dish that was easy to make. will DEFINITELY make it again!

My husband and I love this recipe.  My kids, even though they love avacado, didn't like the "sauce."  If I made it for my kids again I would add a little less lime and cilantro, but I love it as is.  We couldn't taste any garlic.  I would either leave it out or add it into the sauce.  I didn't add cayenne because of the kids, but can't wait to try it.

I love avocados. But as a whole this pizza needed more flavor and was a little dry. I wished I had some ranch to dip it in.

My husband is very very picky and so I was surprised when he absolutely loved this pizza!  I brought a piece to a co-worker today and she immediately asked for the recipe.  It was delicious!  My son thought it was just okay, but I think he would have loved it too if I had put the cayenne on it, which I left off.  I used an already roasted chicken bought at the store (they're so cheap!) and next time I'll use a little more cilantro.  I also used half Monterey Jack and half Mozzarella cheese, using about twice what the recipe called for.  An amazingly easy recipe!  Oh, and I only oiled one side of the pizza.  Oiling both sides sounded messy.

This was just okay...I didn't really like it, and now I realize why I like my guacamole chunky...because pureed I feel like I am eating baby food.  Since there was so much of the avacado "sauce" globbed on, it was totally unappetizing to me.  I even tried scraping it off the crust as I was eating it.  The combination of ingredients sounds pretty good...and if you generally like baby food-consistency guacamole, then you'll probably like this recipe. I just didn't.

I left out the cilantro. Mozzarella cheese can be use too. And i sprinkled dried oregano on top and leave out the cayenne if kids are involved :) Absolutely AWESOME pizza. It tastes like it cost a lot of money at the gourmet pizza shop down the street.

I loved this pizza. I followed the directions exactly, except that I used my own pizza dough so I only put oil on the top side of the dough, and baked it for longer. It was fantastic though, and I will def. make again!

This recipe is delicious as written! It will also be fun to play with the ingredients as well. FYI - Webster's definition of pizza: a dish made typically of flattened bread dough spread with a savory mixture usually including tomatoes and cheese and often other toppings and baked. This recipe is certainly a pizza!

Very quick and tasty! I quartered the recipe to serve just myself. And, because I know how bland avocado can be without some help, I added a dash of cumin and a dash of garlic powder in addition to the salt, pepper, cilantro, and lime. I also substituted Roma tomatoes because I think they have a better texture for a use like this. Will definitely make this one again!

This was very good!  I used plum tomatoes instead of cherry just because it's what I had on hand.  Also, I omitted the cayenne pepper.  I found that I needed to use about one or two tablespoons more lime juice than the recipe called for.  Also, I added some bacon to the recipe.  It was sooooo good!

I was unsure whether or not to use fresh pizza dough or prepared. I used freshed and rolled it out. Next time I will use pre cooked. Other than that I found this to be a delicious pizza even though I had some problems. I didn't roll out the dough thin enough so it turned into a deep dish version. But the ingredients where fine. I didn't miss the tomato sauce at all. Avocado worked very well. Tasted great.

I made this pretty much as directed and it was good.  Only changes were to use chicken substitute (I'm a vegetarian) and lemon juice since I didn't have lime juice.  Only issue was that I have never had warm avocado before and found it kind of strange.  I would make this again but maybe keep the avocado spread as a side to spread/dip the pizza in after broiling.

Awesome recipe!!! I am a huge fan of guacamole, so this really hit the spot for my family! The only addition I made to the recipe was adding some fresh sliced red onions, just for personal preference!!! Amazing flavor! I actually was able to taste each ingredient in each bite! New staple for my house.

This was just okay for me and my husband.  A very different taste that we really couldn't decide if we liked or not.  As other reviewers mentioned, it felt like it was missing something.  
My husband said he would be willing to try it again and maybe add onions and garlic on top.  I don't know if I'd try it again, just didn't do a whole lot for me and was quite a bit of work.

I made the recipe as-is and it was good, but seemed like it was missing something, so we sprinkled chili powder (in addition to the cayenne pepper) on top and it was AMAZING! I think you could easily add chopped red onion to the avocado, too. Maybe I will try that next time!

WOW!  I never in a million years would have put these toppings on a pizza but I will definitely be doing it again soon!  I didn't find it dry at all.  I followed the recipe almost exactly minus the cilantro (and quartered it to just feed me)...so, so good!

Needs a little more seasoning with the avo, but otherwise we loved this. My husband said it was his favorite pizza ever and that he would rather eat this over pepperoni anyday. I was shocked.

My husband and i really liked this recipe. We used mozzarella cheese instead of jack and we wished that we would have put more on. We also used a garlic herb dough which may have masked the flavor of the recipe, but it was still excellent. We will definitely try this again!

Our family loved this!  I didn't have Monterey Jack cheese, so I substituted Mozzarella and it turned out fine. I added roasted red pepper and a sprinkling of feta cheese for a little more kick.

Delicious!!  I make my own dough, so I put olive oil and chopped garilc on the dough before putting on the avacado mixture.  Also added garlic to the avacado mixture.  The rest of the recipe I left as written.  Once again YUMMY!!

I followed the directions for the most part but used 2 store bought rolls of crescent roll dough as the crust over a large rectangle baking sheet. I had to add an extra avocado to make the "sauce" spread across it. It was so good but I was thinking while eating it - this would be so yummy as a french bread pizza too! Sort of like a bruchetta! That's what I'm doing next time because the avocado confused me at first, I thought I hadn't baked the crust long enough and maybe a bit doughy but as I looked it was the mushy texture of the avocados. So choose a strong dough or crust when making this to even out the textures.

Sooo good! I like to add jalapeno to the avocado mixture, and use pepper jack cheese on top. Always a huge hit in my house!

As stated = boring!  I had to add garlic salt, onion powder and dried basil afterward to give it a little more dimension.  Still not great.  I'm keeping it as a reference for another meal with which to use leftover chicken, but next time I'm going to find a way to add some real flavor (onions, salsa, cumin or something).  I also think this would work best with a really thin crust.  I used a thick one and it really took away from any flavor the toppings may have provided.  Maybe I'll try tortillas as a crust next time.

WARNING!  DO NOT USE PIZZA STONE UNDER BROILER OR PREHEAT PIZZA STONE AND ADD COOL ITEMS TO IT!  PIZZA STONE WILL EXPLODE LIKE MINE DID!  Other than that, this recipe is wonderful.  If you want a lot of flavour like other reviewers stated, you might want to find another recipe.  This one is light and mild.  All pizzas (we doubled) were eaten.  This recipe has been added to my binder.

This was a great change from a traditional pizza.  Hubby thought it was pretty good as well.  I did add a chopped clove of garlic to the avocado mix.  You can never have too much garlic.

Technically, I didn't follow the recipe terribly well.  I made my standard guacamole recipe for the sauce--avocados, red onion, jalapenos, lime, cilantro, tomatoes.  Then I put chicken, more tomatoes, and cheese on top.  I used Jay's Signature pizza crust from this site.  It tasted great.  I think an avocado pizza is a very good idea.  Thanks for putting this idea in my head!

We loved this!!  I made my own dough also -- this made one pizza.  The only other thing I did differently was dip the garlic clove in the oil to rub it on the dough.  It was the only way I could get it to work.

This just was not to my liking. I love avocados and chicken but not on a pizza. The avocado was just blah and this had no taste. I would have rather had the chicken and the avocado separate and made a nice salad with it or something. Avocados hot is not pleasant.

Seemed very bland to me.  I was very excited to make it, but it was not that good.  Maybe I should have mixed pesto into the avocado like someone else mentioned.  I don't think I will make this again.

Great pizza!! I used a whole wheat crust, sauteed the chicken myself before adding to pizza. I had marinated the chicken in an Italian dressing and added red pepper to it before I marinated. Also added red onion to the pizza and it was fantastic!! Gonna grill the pizza next time for a bit different flavor...

I made this in our camper last weekend and it was a BIG hit! I didn't have a ready made pizza crust so used crescent roll dough instead and for the chicken, I had a couple of pieces left over from a store-roasted chicken. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

Really GREAT pizza recipe. We had our little variations, like everyone else... 1) We made ours on a single 12" crust, and the rest of the ingredients still seemed enough; 2) We cut out one step and used garlic olive oil on the crust; 3) No cilantro; 4) Added a bit more chicken.

The not so minor variation was that we made it on our grill, because it was so hot today we didn't want to put the oven on. The crust came out nice and crisp, which we like, but might not be everyone's "cup of tea".

Variations aside, this is a great pizza, 5 stars, definitely a keeper for us.

Time to go to the store because THIS is what's for dinner tonight!  Haven't tried it yet but am so looking forward to trying it. Not a fan of cilantro so won't use that; however, I do have some celery that has some leaves that I'll instead.

Made for dinner last night and loved it.  I made the avacado mix and added extra cilantro; extra fresh lime juice and garlic.  I chopped the chicken then diced the tomatoes and used the Spicy Monterey Jack Cheese.  I also purchased a premade thin pizza pie crust.  Husband loved it too.  Next time I will use more tomatoes.  Will make again!!!!  Very fast to make especially if you have leftover chicken.  - Thanks.

This was very tasty.  I added onion to the spread for more flavor and texture.  This made a lot of avocado spread.  I had leftovers, and the second time I ate it I topped it with salsa, which I would highly recommend.

Thank you for this wonderfully unique recipe! The flavors were SPOT ON! I was a little confused when it called for 4 small pizza crusts? I used one Pilsbury refrigerated dough and my oven at 400, not the broiler. I cooked the crust til it was puffy...maybe around 7 minutes. Then I added the toppings and cooked for about 15 more minutes, til the cheese was turning golden brown. I also added some bacon. Next time I would put the cheese on  before the toppings, and maybe add a fresh jalopeno to the avocado mix. We love spicy so I piled on the cayenne and crushed red pepper. Oh and I topped it off with some ranch too. Delicious!

This is a WONDERFUL recipe. I make it almost on a weekly basis. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly. It was awesome! Now, when I make it, I have tweaked it a little bit, and to me, it is 5 stars. Here's what I do: I make a whole wheat crust (Amazing Whole Wheat Pizza Crust from this site) I take the garlic with a pinch of salt and paste it, adding it to the avocado/cilantro/lime. I use 1/2 mozzarella, 1/2 salsa jack. I top with slivered red onion, red bell pepper, and mushrooms. I omit the tomatoes and instead chunk the chicken and coat it in BBQ sauce before putting it on the pizza. My husband can't get enough of it. I have even had friends that don't like avocado taste it, and end up eating it because they like it. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe. It's one of our family's favorites!!

Just got a new pizza stone for Christmas and have been trying all sorts of new concoctions - loved this one! I spiced up the avocado with a little more cilantro and lime and added onion - plus did not use the chicken. I was so excited to try it I burned my mouth!

Loved this!! I made more of a guac instead of just the plain avocado then added chicken, tomatoes, basil, cheese. Make sure you only make this when you have people to eat it because the avocado will start to go brown after an hour or two. This is a must try!!

This was good! I added minced garlic to the guacamole instead of rubbing it on the crust. I was kind of disappointed because the cheese was almost burned and the crust was undercooked. I was thinking next time I would just bake at 425 for about 8-10 minutes. Also, I thought a little minced or thinly sliced red onion would be a nice addition.

This pizza was AMAZING.  This is my first review, although, I have made several recipes from this site.  I followed it exactly except I added mushrooms.  I used two bigger pre-made crusts as well.  It will become a regular in my house.

Ok I seriously goofed this up (grocery store had no cilantro so had to omit that, forgot to rub crust w oil or garlic, forgot salt in sauce) but it was still tasty & I would love ti have it prepared right!!  I added bacon like another suggested and used store bought brust.  very good for our family because my husband hates tomato sauce and I love guacamole..lol!!  THANKS!!

Added two cloves of garlic to the avocado mix as well as 2tblsp olive oil.  Also added a layer of fresh basil between the tomato & cheese layer.  Used white Italian cheese blend rather than Monterey Jack.  This was absolutely delicious.  Boyfriend was grabbing bites between records while making a mix.  Probably got oil on some records, but he said for this pizza it was worth it.

Veganized this recipe by swapping in Morningstar soy chicken strips for the chicken, and shredding a block of vegan Monterey Jack soy cheese.  Also subbed in a teaspoon of dried cilantro for the fresh.  Turned out wonderfully, and would easily have them again.  Pretty easy prep, and quick as well.  Maybe a touch too much lime as directed, but still very good.

This turned out fantastic! We had left overs and they were fantastic the next day too! Did not make any changes this time around, however next time I think I will add some fresh sliced onions on top. Again, absolutely wonderful.

Absolutely delicious!!! Somehow my cherry tomatoes didn't make it home from the grocery store- so I just sprinkled about 1/2 to 1 cup of marinara sauce on top of the chicken. I think it added a ton of flavor! Definitely a permanent substitution in my house!!!

This pizza was very good and I made it as part of an avocado fest party that we had. The avocado mixture is very thick, but lends an interesting taste to the rest of the pizza. I used more chicken than what it called for and I grilled the chicken on the bbq first to give it more flavor. I don't give it a five because some of my guests thought it was a little bland. Next time I'm going to add more green onion and maybe some black olives to jazz it up.

This was great pizza!  I added a couple cloves of garlic to the sauce.  There wasn't enough chicken for me personally - I think each crust could use an entire breast.  A fun, different meal!

*****!  "One of the best pizzas you have ever made."  (Direct quote from my DH.  And I've made my share of pizzas over the years!)  I mashed the avocado, lime juice, minced garlic, and S&P in a bowl.  (Left out the cilantro - not a fan at all).  Everything else was just as the recipe was written.  Please add the pinch of cayenne pepper - - you need the little spice.  Absolutely fantastic!  I've already shared it with my friends on my food forum.  This recipe is worth trying, people!

Healthy pizza! And yummy. I added an extra avocado because the quantity provided seemed too small. I used the Pizza Dough I recipe instead of store-bought crusts. I would definately recommend doing this. Also - I didn't use the broiler. I just put it in the oven at 400 degrees for about 25 minutes. Came out perfect.

Wonderful.  We made this in our wood fired oven for a mothers day gathering.  This was really delicious and well received by everyone.
A great fresh taste. I gently sprinkled on the cayenne pepper, as I didn't want to make it too hot for my elderly mum.  Will try a bit more next time for the big kids.  Will definately be making this again.  A great pizza.
Please take a look at my photo's for this recipe.

This was tasty and made a beautiful presentation. I thought it was almost too rich with that much avocado.  I might spread it on thinner next time or plan on eating smaller portions -   this would be a great appetizer cut into small squares.

I was looking for a different way to use up a couple of Avocados and this was it!  My husband was sceptical, but loved it!  I used extra celantro as the reviews suggested and probably more chees too.  I forgot the cayane pepper and just used pepper flakes when serving.  This is a keeper.

This was a fun pizza alternative.  Like others, I made this with fresh dough and then just added the toppings at the end.  I did like spicing it up though.  I really couldn't taste much cilantro flavor.  I added some chili powder and seasoning salt to it.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was super easy to make, and delicious.  I made my own dough, so I made sure to undercook the chicken slightly.  Nice and moist in the end!  wonderful.  I added some italian allspice and shrimp to the mix.... great combo! As for the sauce--I added some garlic powder, paprika and pepper in addition to the lemon juice. I used mozzarella, as I didn't have any monteray, and found it to be a great mix--the mild cheese, allowed the spicy guacomole and cherry tomatoes to really stand out....

I really like this variation of a pizza.  My husband enjoyed it too.  We used a garlic and cilantro naan bread for the crust and a mix of Monterey Jack cheese and pizza cheese.  If I made it again I would add more lime juice and salt to give the sauce more zing.

I was a little hesitant about this, but my sister coaxed me to try it, and it was GOOD.  I added black olives.  Other than that I didn't change anything, except I made my own pizza crust and baked as usual instead of broiling.

Pretty good recipe.  I added some bocconcini balls too.  I only made the avocado mixture with half the avocados and chopped the rest, so I could spread them out on top. Then I lightly drizzled some franks hot sauce and ranch dressing on top.
Oh and I made my own dough, cooked it at 400 for 20 minutes.  I'll make this again when I have left over chicken! It was good!

We used guacamole instead of avocado slices and we loved it! I added BBQ sauce to my side of the pie and that put it over the top for me.

Will make again just because it is different than the regular chicken pizza. We used a Pillsbury thin crust refrigerated dough, baked about 3/4 of the time pkg said. We then rubbed the garlic on per directions of this recipe. I will smashed garlic next time & spread over for more flavor. We used roma tomato because that is what we had & it didn't make the dough soggy. We added bacon that we fried & some mozz cheese also. I think some time we'll try with fresh mushrooms, spinach as others have suggested & feta cheese maybe.  Hubby thought it could've used more cilantro, but that I thought it was fine. Some reviews had said hot avocado was bad tasting, but I didn't mind at all & I'd never had it hot before that I can think of. % stars from me, but hubs said 4.

Made my own dough for crusts.  I don't like cilantro so I didn't use it.  I left out the cayenne since we were sharing with my son, but I think it could have used it.  My son wouldn't eat it (likely because of the green colour)  but my husband and I thought it was okay.

I love this pizza! I have made this numerous times and it always turns out great. I use a whole wheat crust and the only difference I made when making this pizza is with the chicken - while frying the chicken up I use fajita seasoning to give it extra flavour. Otherwise I find the pizza to be good but missing that extra flair and spice. The fajita seasoning on the chicken really helps. Awesome!

I think these are very easy and absolutely delicious, however, my 3 and 5 year old barely touched them, and my husband didn't care for the avacado sauce. I used grands biscuits rolled flat for my crust. Made the perfect size personal crust.

Loved this recipe.  Made 2 8inch pizza at first.  A little bland, like something was missing. Then made 2 more 8 inch pizzas, added mushrooms, some rred onion and a little fresh cilantro..then BAM!!  The avocado spread instead of the "traditional' red was quite refreshing.  The pizza hold up well when wrapped in wax paper and ziploc bag for later eating.  the flavor was fresh 3 days later.  next time I will do my chicken a bit spicier also.  Overall, this is a great pizza!!  i will make more in the near future!

This was a pretty good pizza!  Next time I think I might make it more of a mexican chicken pizza by adding corn and black beans.  It was a nice change from a tomato sauce pizza though. Definitely worth a try!

I think that this pizza is good. It seems to be missing something. Of course you can add heat (crushed red pepper or more cayenne) to give it a kick but that is not the missing ingredient. Maybe change it to a more flavorful cheese. I definitely think this recipe is workable.

I really liked this pizza, however, my husband and I thought it would have been better served as an appetizer rather than a main dish because the avocado taste was very overwhelming after a piece or two.  Next time I don't think I'll spread the avocado mixture "thickly" as the recipe suggests because for me, it was too much.  I did add some bacon and roasted red peppers as another reviewer suggested.

This was very good! My boyfriend LOVED it! I used a pre-made crust in a tube and cooked it on the grill. Yum! I skipped the food processor (don't have one) and just mashed everything with a fork. My boyfriend loves garlic, so we didn't mind the bigger pieces. Also, I skipped the rubbing garlic on the crust step and just used a garlic infused olive oil. Can't wait to make it again!

Excellent change from traditional pizza.  I was rushed so I used prepared chicken from the grocery store.  I found the avocado spread extremely tasty.  The cilantro is a must so don't omit.

Made this recipe just as described, and like another reviewer I thought it a bit bland.  I think its a great starting point though and the avocado mixture is what I'll start tinkering with first.  Maybe adding some diced red onion or jalapeno to give the overall pizza a little more flavor.

I didn't think this had much flavor. Needs more garlic, lime, and cilantro IMO. I probably won't make it again, but I am glad I tried it!

This turned out delicious, but I did some tweaking.  I crushed two cloves of garlic and mixed it in with the avocado, sprinkled some taco seasoning on top, and added some mushrooms.  Any veggies could be used for this.  I slow cooked and pulled the chicken before putting it on the pizza to keep it from drying out.  I will definitely make this again!

I too was skeptical about making this but after reading the reviews I had to make it. It was wonderful! So easy, so quick, and delicious. I made the recipe exact and I did not feel the need to make any changes. Thanks for the great recipe!

I used a Pillsbury pizza crust. Cooked until lightly brown and then added ingredients. This was even better when it cooled.  We loved it and I have passed it on to friends.

WOW!  I had a bit of a problem because my avocados weren't quite ripe so they wouldn't blend right....I solved that by adding some olive oil to the blender and it smoothed right out.  I also added garlic salt.  The final pizza was delicious.  I'll be making this again...using ripe avocados of course!!!

Perfect. Not a fan of the chucks of tomato so I just did 1/8 inch slices of plum tomoatoes and put them on top of the avocado sauce.  Fantastic.

Was a nice twist to traditional pizza. We added a generous amount of black to give it a lil something.

Great pizza.  Diced 3 cloves of garlic into the sauce, and used a pizza crust with cheese and herbs already in dough.  Fantastic.

Super quick and easy!  Very tasty too.  I also added garlic powder and paprika to the sauce.  A nice break from the original type pizzas.  I followed the recipe for the sauce and just used one 12 inch crust.  Turned out great.
