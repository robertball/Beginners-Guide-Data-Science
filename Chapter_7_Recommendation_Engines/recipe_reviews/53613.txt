I really anticipated a change from the typical tomato based sloppy joe.  This recipe was absolutely the most horrible tasting, bland smelling tasteless "mystery meat" meal you can imagine.

Many agree that this recipe is merely "Hamburger Gravy".

We made this and after omitting the liquid smoke, enjoyed on top of grilled buns open-faced. We had alongside of fries, beans and green salad. Very good. Excellent way to make a simple meal. Will make again, the whole family really enjoyed.

It's nothing more than hamburger gravy (without the mashed potatoes). Wasn't a favorite when I was a kid, still isn't. My son said it was "okay" so I might make it again for him sometime. I'll pass.

I tried this recipe as it is written and found it to be like bland hamburger gravy which my family did not like at all. After careful thought, I decided to try it again and kicked it up a notch adding sauteed onions, celery, green and red peppers for more body and flavor. It was much tastier with more color and appealing to the eye as well as the tummy. My advice is to ad what ever you like to suit your families tastes.

But I LOVE hamburger gravy!!!! :0) (To those who acted like that was a bad thing...shame on you!  JK!  This was kind of more like a hamburger stroganoff (which I like), I added more garlic and it tasted pretty darn good.

This turned out very good.  I seasoned the hamburger first and added some sliced mushrooms. I forgot to add the liquid smoke and will try that next time. The family loved it and I will make it again when I need something easy and a little different.

I tried this since it got some good reviews and I thought it would be a good, quick dinner.  The smoke flavor was overwhelming.  Not a repeater in our house.  The kids thought it looked like dog food and refused to touch it.

These were a nice twist to an old favorite.  Kinda reminded me of stroganoff without the noodles.  My whole family gobbled them up!

I had some spreadable cheese triangles lying in the fridge and added that to the mix for extra creaminess. We ate them on ciabatta-style buns with fries and salad. I didn't use the hickory however, but let my guests  add tabasco or bbq sauce to their taste. It was simple, but lacked in flavour. I probably wouldn't make it again unless I was cooking for a picky eater though.

Husband and I both liked this a lot.  Not too salty for us.  We put pepper jack cheese on the sandwiches and it was really tasty.  So easy - I loved that the most.

Nice change of pace. I made it all "white" by using ground turkey instead of beef.  Left out the "smoke" (personal dislike), added a little parsley, basil and a pinch cayenne.

Husband doesn't like tomato-based Sloppy Joes, so I thought I'd give this a try.  Not for company, but for a quick & easy dinner, it was good.  We both liked the liquid smoke.  I added some chili powder and Worcestershire to zip it up a little bit and served with a green salad.  Especially nice is that husband liked it.  Thanks for the recipe!

Fast and easy dish.  I thought the consistency was spot on like a sloppy joe and not that of gravy as mentioned above.  My kids loved it on a toasted bun.

I make a hamburger stroganoff very much like this, but without the liquid smoke.  I do add onions, garlic powder, and paprika, too, so perhaps those additions might make it less bland for those who are iffy with the recipe as is.  Thanks for tonight's supper idea!  I've been struggling all day!

This was delicious! I would have never dreamed of putting liquid smoke with these ingredients.  Fabulous alternative to the same ol' sloppy joe.  The whole family enjoyed this one.

I made this for my family tonight. I am a vegetarian so I can not vouche for the results myself but my husband and children enjoyed it. I added some chopped onion. I did not have mushroom soup or liquid smoke so I used a can of cream of chicken soup and some Bragg's liquid Amminos instead. My husband said it was like a stroganoff sandwich and my picky son ate two!

My aunt use to make this when we were going up with 8 kids. The only thing she did (and I now do) is the 1 pd of ground beef and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, simmer 5 min. This is so easy and the kids love it. I don't even like mushrooms, but I love this.

Very delicious--I had never had a sandwich like it!  I used recipe crumbles (fake ground beef) instead of meat, and it worked great!

Based on the other reviews, I was really expecting a plain hamburger gravy taste.  My husband and I not only thought it was bland, it just seemed off.  The flavors didn't blend well, and adding it to garlic toast didn't seem to help either.  I really think this is a recipe you have to have an acquired taste for.  If you are looking for a 'sloppy joe' taste, this might not be what you are looking for.

I made this today (102017) and used 2 lbs of hamburger; 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of cream of onion soup.  I also added 1/2 tsp of garlic with some shredded mozzarella cheese to taste. No liquid smoke.  It was a hit.  Even had my brother in law say, “this is a recipe that will be on my list to have again”

Nice alternative to a reg. sloppy joe. Teenagers were happy to have the leftovers the next day. Taste was delicious.

I don't like mushrooms and so made it with cream of onion soup.  It is very, very good.  I make it for my mom who suffers from Crohn's Disease (intestinal disorder) and she seems to tolerate it very well...and she loves it!

Ever served in the military or know someone who has? This recipe is exactly like SOS-- S* on a Shingle-- that they serve in canteens. It's hamburger gravy, something to fill the belly, but not very tasty. Unappealing to look at as well-- gray and glue-y. I gave it two stars because picky husbands and kids seem to like it.  Sorry dude. :/

Like the other members said bland. Tasted like gravy for biscuits and gravy. I added an onion to the ground beef. I prefer regular sloppy joes.

Sorry!

I tried these as an alternative to regular sloppy joes, since my husband doesn't care for those, but these, in my opinion, were even worse.  Neither of us enjoyed this meal at all and I would never make it again.

If you've ever had creamed beef, this is exactly the same thing only with a smoky flavor.  I thought it was a little to thick.  My 5 year old daughter wouldn't eat it, and I didn't care for it much either.  My husband ate just about all of it so I'll give it 3 stars.  I won't make this again.
