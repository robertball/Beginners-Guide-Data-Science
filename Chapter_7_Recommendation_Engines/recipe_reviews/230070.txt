Hubs got home from work after I had made the cake and informed me he had to head out of town for a meeting in the morning.  I told him had I known that I wouldn’t have made the cake.  He enthusiastically said he’d take it on the plane with him to his meeting!  “Nah,” I said.  “It’s just a cake mix. I don’t want you to give that to them.”  So Hubs isn’t here, and I tried that cake.  I cut a slice, intending to just try a bite,  but I ended up finishing it off.  In other words, I needn’t have been concerned about it being good enough.  He should have taken it to the meeting and everyone would have enjoyed it.  I did have to put this cake together with things I had on hand or wanted to make use of.  I used the butter pecan cake mix, but since I had no toffee bits I substituted miniature chocolate chips.  I only had one banana, but a half cup of applesauce worked like a charm for that second banana.  I used buttermilk rather than water and, in deference to Hubs’ sensitive innards, I omitted the pecans from the batter, sprinkling them on top of the cake instead.  The cake is moist and flavorful - and incredibly, no cake mix taste!  Since I had already introduced chocolate into the cake, I glazed it with “Satiny Chocolate Glaze,” also from this site.  I am so pleased with this cake and have no doubt it would be perfect as is, without my modifications. My only criticism is with the baking time – I found it took closer to 50 minutes to bake thoroughly.

This was a delicious and mosit cake.  The frosting makes the cake. I put pecan halves around the top of the cake.   I did add a small amount more of the bananas, pecans and toffee baking bits. It freezes very well

I made this in a bunt pan, I did put cream cheese frosting on it (my family loves that frosting) and added the sauteed pecans to this.  Everyone loved it!

I tasted the batter before baking the cake and I thought it would be  sweet enough without the frosting. I was right, it did not need the frosting as the cake is plenty sweet without it. Maybe it was because my bananas were overly ripe or because I used butterscotch chips (that's what I had) instead of toffee bits. Either way, I did not frost it. Good recipe considering it comes from a box mix.

Great flavor, but mine fell apart at the slightest touch.  Not sure what happened.....could be my high altitude?  Probably wont try again.
