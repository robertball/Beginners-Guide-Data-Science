I thought this recipe was very good.  I strongly disagree with anyone giving a recipe a bad review (like the reviewer before me) just because its not a healthy recipe.  Everyone is entitled to splurge every so often.  If you're looking for a healthy recipe, just keep looking and don't unfairly review a recipe.

I would give it a 5 for it being so easy.
It was def a different recipe, but good.
I didnt have apple pie filling so i made my own, still very good. Almost rich.
Make sure you drain teh sausage very well. I will also wait to put the cheese on until the last 10-15 minutes of cooking.
I will DEF be making this again.

WOW!! This is such a great meal... and easy, too!!  It's in my husband's top five (and that's saying a lot)!  
The first time I made this I bought canned apples by mistake, but saved myself by adding 3/4 cup sugar, 3 Tbsp. of flour, about 9 shakes of cinnamon and 3 shakes of nutmeg.  Next time I make it, which will be soon, I'm going to try fresh apples with this sauce.

I used hot sausage and it complemented the sweetness of the apples very well.  Cooking meat with fruit is not done often in our culture, but it's very common in other parts of the world and in other time periods.  I served this for lunch and my husband loved it.  I would make it for breakfast or brunch, too.

My mom has made this for years and it's one of my family's favorites. She adds a streusal topping to it, which is delicious with the sausage.

This was a very good combination.  Actually, since I was a kid, we have eaten lunchmeat with coffee cake.  The salty with the sweet.  U-m-m-m.  Try it, you'll like it!

This was good, but it couldn't decide if it was dinner or desert.  Also, a little to much sasuage flavor.

Very good, my husband and son loved it. The flavor was delicious. Just a little greasy. I made it witha top crust as recommended by another user, I don't I will do it next time because I think that the cheese needed to be browned. Be sure to drain the sausage as much as you can after cooking. I will make this again, the taste of the sharp cheddar, apple and sausage was perfect. Be sure to cover crust after 15 minutes and cook at least 35 minutes or longer so bottom crust cooks.

This is a great-tasting recipe that is really very simple to make.  The combination of pork sausage and apples is classic, and the cheddar cheese just makes it better.  Be sure to use sharp cheddar... the flavor blends better than mild. I WILL be making this again.  Thanks for the wonderful meal!

I've made this before I saw this recipe. I use 3 fresh apples per lb of italian sausage with about a 1/4 C brown sugar, molassas, and spices like cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg. I also add 1-2 eggs to help bind everything together and sometimes a little bit of apple sauce to help make it saucy. I stir the cheese (only about 1 cup) into the filling as well. I hope this helps to inspire others to make this delicious fall recipe.

I use one pound finely chopped pork sausage, one can of comstock special apple pie filling, one cup sharp cheddar cheese, and 1 cup of "light brown sugar"......goes in like this..bottom crust, apples, sausage, light brown sugar sprinkled across, cheddar cheese...lay on top crust then give it 5 slits to breathe.....the BROWN SUGAR is the key...sets the rest off. Anyway...this is a Great Holiday Breakfast(or Blinner/Blupper etc) Cheers!!!!

I'm sure the quality of the finished product on this recipe is dependent on the quality of your crust, your pie filling, and the sausage you use. Having said that, use the best you have, and you will love this recipe. The pie is both savory and sweet. Everybody in my family loved it, and I will make it again and again. 

We made it with homemade breakfast sausage (recipe on this site), a homemade apple pie filling, and the French Pastry Pie Crust (also from this site). The only thing I will change next time is to blend the cheese into the pie and meat filling--the cheddar on my first effort tended to stick to the top crust, so if I didn't get a perfectly balanced forkful, I didn't get cheddar in every bite. Blending the cheese would handily take care of that problem. Also, the bake time needs to be adjusted to your crust recipe. I needed to go for a full 45 minutes (and switched from 350 to 375 midway through) to get my crust golden.

This is super yummy! Made it for some friends and they loved it. Even asked for seconds! Its an easy recipe and one that you would never expect to be so tasty. Warning: If you dont like a sort of sweet dinner, then maybe this is not for you.

Tried this out at a pot luck dinner last night, and it got great reviews!  I liked it, too...wasn't sure at first how those ingredients would go together, but I do know that I like apple and pork dishes, so I thought I'd give it a whirl.  Glad I did!  This time I used pre-cooked sausage crumbles, next time I'll fry up my own ground sausage and maybe bake it a few minutes longer (30 minutes was not enough time for the heavy stoneware pie plate I used).

I have been using a similar recipe for years. I got it out of a cookbook called "Best recipies off the backs of boxes" or something like that.  The book was printed back in the mid 60's. It used split sausage links arranged in spoke form around the pie under the crust. Th only change i made was to slice the sausage into nickel sized pieces and layer the top under the crust. Sometimes I mix sharp grated chedder into the apple filling.

This tasted great - I was pretty sure it would. It sure isn't healthy, though - if I hadn't looked at the fat and calorie numbers, I would've eaten the whole thing in one go. As it was, I made it last me for three days. I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be an entree, a breakfast or brunch item, or what; I had it for dinner and two lunches. I made it pretty much exactly as written. I could only find a larger (20 oz.) can of apple pie filling, so I measured out 15.3 oz. on my digital scale. I used shredded mild cheddar, but perhaps sharp cheddar would've tasted even better. I baked it for 28 minutes and it looked done to me. I'd make this again, but only for a rare treat. I'll give it a high rating because it tasted so great, and because it's so easy to make and made with just four ingredients.

i tried this recipe with apple maple chicken sausage rather than pork. Incredible. being from wisconsin, we're used to putting cheddar cheese on top of apple pie, so I wonder how this recipe would taste with her apple & gouda chicken sausage. Either way, better nutritionals than with pork - and my daughter's alergic to pork anyway. The brand of chicken sausages we used have lamb casings - no pork anywhere.

I've been making this for years and just love it.  I do make sure to cook the sausage until it's well browned, and drain it well.  I use SHARP cheddar, and add it for the last 15 minutes and it turns out wonderful.  

When I first read the recipe, it sounded so unusual.  I knew I would like it, but wondered what others would think.  So far, it's a hit with everyone who I've served it to.

This is an excellent recipe.  My kids aren't big sausage fans, but even they said it was good.  I personally thought it was better than good.  I like spicy foods and since the kids (at the age where they don't like much) only thought it was " ok", next time I will make it with a good hot sausage.

This is a very unique dish and I love the way it combines the sweet and savoury flavours together. For those of you who think that the combination of sausage and apple sounds unappealing, don't forget that many people love apple sauce with their pork or cranberry sauce with their turkey. This recipe might not be for everyone but I liked it and so did my b/f. I only made a couple of small changes to the recipe. One was that I made my own apple pie filling, and the other one was that I used extra pork sausage to make this into a larger pie. Not sure how much cheese I used, although it's quite possible I may have used more than what is called for here because I didn't measure it - I just covered the pie with what I thought was a good amount of cheese. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Amy!

Made this for a church brunch, but with homemade pie filling and sweet Italian sausage.  The folks raved about it - even my kids who were saying "Ewww!" the whole time I was putting the pie together. ;o)  It's getting 4 stars, though, b/c I felt the flavor was lacking...something.  It was extremely good, just not *fabulous*.  I will certainly keep this on file to make again!

2 stars because of the ease, but my family hated this. The textures did not mesh well and the taste was not one we care to repeat.

I have a similar recipe that I got from the cookbook Best Recipes from the Backs of Boxes, Bottles, Cans and Jars. Breakfast Sausage Apple Pie. The original recipe calls for 1# of Oscar Mayer Pork Sausage Links. I perfer Bob Evans Hot ground sausage. I mix all the ingredients together and pour into pie crust and bake. I serve it for a Sunday morning brunch or an evening dinner. Yummo.

Thought this sounded too weird to be so good but boy was I WRONG!  So easy to throw together, it took longer to make my pie crust.  I also cut back on the cheese a bit, I think next time I will try a struesel topping and there is definetly going to be a next time.  Leftovers are excellent too.  Thanks so much for posting.

My family loved this pie!  My two kids normally do not eat Italian sausage but they ate it this time.  It was soooo easy.  I would definitely make it again.

The recipe intrigued me even though I don't like cinnamon with meat or cheese on my apple pie.  It was easy to make and it was fantastic.  For me food is about flavor and not calories, I'll be making this again and again.

I used a can of apple filling. I found it to be too sweet, to be honest. I used ground breakfast sausage, it was tasty, and I topped it off with shredded Colby cheese. Again, tasty, but I felt there wasn't enough holding the pie together. If I do this again, I will make my own pie filling, and make it less sweet. I also feel it needs more of a binding agent, perhaps a crust on top and/or maybe cheese mixed in rather than put on as a top layer.

Definitely a quick, easy to make recipe and people love it. I used chopped breakfast sausages (regular and maple mixed, from the deli, not frozen) and added a bacon crumble to the top.

I didn't have apple pie filling, so I substituted fresh apples with sugar and spices and added it to the sausage while it sauteed. Also, I didn't have regular sausage so I used turkey sausage.  The filling seemed a bit dry so I made a cheese sauce and added that.  It was delicious and my boyfriend's son ate half the pie with the request that I make this again.  Next time I'll make sure I have the apple pie filing and try it that way.

Sounded interesting so I made two, one for dinner and one to take to work.  I did not care for this.  Needs a lot less apple pie filling and I'm not sure that would save it.  The second pie did not go to work, I made something else. I really wanted to like this.

My aunt makes this every year for Christmas Brunch. It is a family favourite! She uses breakfast sauage links cut up into bite size pieces and it is pretty good. I think it would also be suitiable for vegetarians in the family if we make one with vegetarian sausage links, it would be just as tasty as the real thing!
