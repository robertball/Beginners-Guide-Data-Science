I used spinach instead of kale, added a tablespoon of chia seeds, and combined peaches alongside the berries.  I had a lot of energy the who day!

I didn't use almonds or orange juice, and I also changed the yogurt to 1/2 cup Greek vanilla, but recipe variation that I used made one of the best homemade smoothies I have ever had (and I have made my fair share homemade smoothies). I plan on making this again and again and eventually trying the original recipe.

If I don't have any orange juice on hand I'll substitute it with Almond Milk.  I've introduced this smoothie to my parents and now they drink one everyday before work!

I increased the blueberries (frozen) to 1 c.  Used 1 c spinach rather than kale.  Used 1/2 c coconut water to replace reg. water.  Did not include yogurt.

Delicious!!  Not too thick.  Beautiful purple color!

I make this, or something similar, almost every day for me and my partner. I don't use almonds because neither one of us likes crunchy bits in a smooth drink. I use a mixture of spinach and kale, frozen mixed berries and a frozen tropical fruit mix. The fruit might vary depending on my mood that day, lol. I have some probiotic protein powder that I will sometimes add. I also use either vanilla soy milk or almond milk instead of water. Awesome kick-start to the day!

I like my smoothies thicker, so next time I will try ice instead of water...or just eliminate the water altogether.  But the flavors were good!  This was my first time putting greens in my smoothies...if I didn't make it myself, I wouldn't even know the kale was in there!

Best breakfast smoothie I’ve had in a while, I had lots of energy, and it was oh so yummy! I made some for my kids and now they love it, they don’t even know it has kale and spinach in it!

Very refreshing! Kale was on sale, I've never tried it before, so I made an impulse buy to my benefit. I don't eat enough green veggies but this'll fix that. For the berries, I used half strawberries and half raspberries. Delish.

I used a little less Kale and no banana, and it was delicious. I'm going to start drinking this every morning.

I used frozen strawberries and blueberries. I also added a tsp of granulated Splenda.
