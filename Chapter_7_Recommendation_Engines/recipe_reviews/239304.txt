This recipe is fantastic!! Found that there was lots of extra stuffing. The only other change I made was that I wrapped my pork loin in bacon, it kept the loin very moist instead of it drying out.

Okay, using the original recipe amount, I had plenty of stuffing for my *4.5lb* pork loin roast.  The only other change I made was to use apple cider instead of chicken stock.  The stuffing was tasty and the pork was good, but could use a little more flavor to the meat.

why too much seasoning salt, otherwise not too bad, maybe marinate the pork in apple cider or juice
