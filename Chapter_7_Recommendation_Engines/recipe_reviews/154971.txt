They were pretty good! I probably would have marinated the steaks a little longer-even overnight-so the flavor runs through the entire steak.  But the marinade is delicious! Thank you!

My family loves this one... and that is 6 people ages 3 to 40. That's a thumbs up here. I do agree, the longer you marinate it the more flavor that comes out. I have to admit we didn't have any coconut rum in the house so we used regular rum and some pina colada mixer and it worked well. I also used lime juice not lemon because we love lime in this house. Thanks so much for sharing this.

I doubled the recipe of marinade for 2 1/2 hours and it was fantastic, I also used the rum I had on hand, but added 2 tsp. of coconut milk I had frozen in the freezer from another recipe!  Delicious!

I tried this recipe, without the coconut-flavored rum. I did not add the ingredients exactly as mentioned, I was a bit liberal with it, since my steak was a bit thicker and bigger. And the result was fantastic, the steak came out really good. And this was my first attempts at cooking beef steak. And was really yummy!, my wife really loved it, excellent recipe.

Excellent!  I marinated the steak about 2 hours and grilled it rather than pan frying it.

some thing different? definitely! for everyone? Probably not, but I loved this recipe, and my wife was head over heels for it. I used spiced rum instead of coconut rum, and it turned out wonderfully!

I didn't have any rum so I tried using a little coconut flavoring with a little water to add liquid to the mixture.  This just wasn't a flavor that my southern family liked.  We'll save the coconut for the cakes!  :)

Tried this one tonight grilled it. Thought it would be something different, and was right. Definitely not something I'd try again. However, the recipe itself was very easy and is what most people have on hand.

It was alright, my wife loved it. It was easy and fast to prepare. I personally didn't care for the coconut.

Definitely needed to cook a lot longer than 3 minutes each side. Should've tried the grill. Not a fan of the pan fry.

I had family over this weekend and wanted to make something restaurant quality.  This recipe gave me a good starting point.  I used all the recommended ingredients, but used my own quantities.  The Beef Steak Loins were from Sam's Club and they were about 2" thick.  I also opted to fire up the grill rather than pan fry.  

full 50 ml mini bottle of coconut rum
3 cloves garlic
1 teaspoon of cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon Sage
Split full lemon in 1/4's and squeezed all of it fresh
1 cup olive oil
1/2 cup water
I left the other ingredients as the recipe called for
Marinated for 2 hours
Seared at 500 30 seconds each side then dropped tempt to 400 for 4 min each side making sure to position each cut so it leaves diamond grate markings for presentation.

Overall, everyone was thrilled and I'll be adding this to my favorites!  Thanks for sharing
