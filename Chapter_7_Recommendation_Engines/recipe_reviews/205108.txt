I had a block of FF cream cheese and I had no idea what to do with, so I was very happy when I stumbled across this recipe. It does live up to it's name, very creamy, perfectly chocolaty but not decadently so - which is fine because you still feel like you are indulging. I made this using a springform pan because I made my own cookie crust and it came out looking beautiful. The batter had me worried for a while because it seemed so runny but it set up perfectly! I didn't even need to thaw it before cutting. I didn't use the sucralose sweetener (cause I had none) and used all sugar to replace it.  Great recipe for something fat-free. Thanks.

This was surprisingly good!  I would never confuse it with a standard high-fat cheesecake but for a healthier alternative, you can't beat it. One thing I discovered though, if you use all sugar in place of the sucralose, you may want to increase it a little. Artificial sweeteners have a more concentrated sweetness than regular sugar. All in all a great recipe!

This was super yummy and I am a huge chocolate eater! I used Weight Watchers fat free cream cheese so it even added some good for you fiber. I brought it to a friend's house and she and I loved it as did the three kids. I would have to say though even though it is "light" there it is still an indulgence. It satisfied my sweet tooth though :)

I was satisfied with the way this turned out. It did remind me of chocolate cheesecake. When I went shopping for the ingredients, I had to buy what the grocery store had. I used regular half and half and reduced fat cream cheese instead of fat free. They also only had light Karo syrup and not lite. I had never heard or used sucralose so I subbed that sugar with 1 packet of Stevia raw. I put the ingredients in my Vitamix mixer for 2 minutes on medium. I stirred in the mostly frozen whipped topping and blended another 45 seconds on medium and about 15 seconds on high. I can't say I have ever made a pie this quick! I froze it over night and it set up nicely.

I was surprised to how good it was. I didn't have half an half instead used heavy cream and still turned out yummy. Will be making this again soon.

I was suprised at how good this pie was.  I used Penzies high processed dutch cocoa and used a Cracker crumb base as I did'nt have the chocolate available.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I really did feed my chocolate cheesecake craving!
