As the first reviewer, I'm sorry to give this such a low rating, but the end result was inedible.  I liked all of the ingredients, but they just didn't come together.  I think there was too much nutmeg and the rum extract tasted out of place.  I tried this once the day I made it and once the following day, thinking it might taste better after giving the flavors a chance to come together, but there was no improvement.

This turned out very good. I ate some warm after a light dinner this evening. I'm looking forward to eating some for breakfast. It seems to me more of a breakfast rice than a dessert. The maple syrup is very tasty in it. I left out the rum extract and cut down on the nutmeg. I used a quick cook brown rice, so I followed the package directions to cook the rice and then followed the recipe from once the rice was cooked.
