This bread smells like Heaven, and tastes even better!!!  My mouth was watering the whole time it was baking!  I substitued basalmic vinegar, because I was out of white, and it was delicious!  My 7-year old didn't like it due to the cayenne pepper, but we 8 grown ups were happy to eat her share!  We dipped it in fresh olive oil...oh WOW!

Wonderful bread recipe! The loaf was dense and high. Very flavorful. The cayenne is just enough to add a tingle to the inside of the mouth. The combination of onion, garlic and oregano is very tasty. I left in the bread machine thru the 2nd rise, then formed it into a loaf and bake in a 9X5 bread pan at 400 degrees for 30 minutes. Perfect bread, Tom! Thanks.

Although this is a bread machine recipe, I used my Kitchenaid with the dough hook.  I substituted Argentine Aji Molino chiles for the cayenne (they have a very smoky, earthy flavor).  I actually made this bread into buns and baked at 350 for 20 minutes and allowed the buns to cool in the oven (to assure they got baked all the way through).  I sereved them with BBQ pulled pork.  What a sandwich!

I think this ia a very good recipe, although for me, it smelled great (I mean really, really great!) but the taste just didn't live up to it.  I made the dough exactly as written except I, like another reviewer, substitued garlic powder for the minced garlic and I don't recommend that. I think this bread needs all the kick it can get, so don't be lazy like me :-), the fresh garlic probably needs to be there.  I felt the Oregano was overpowering and I will subtract at least a tbsp next time. I also think I might like to add just a bit more cayenne pepper.  I used my bread machine to make the dough and then with well oiled hands I shaped the dough into small balls in a 9x9 pan to create dinner rolls, allowing them to rise an additional 30 minutes. I baked them for approx 35 minutes at 350. These rose well, the texture was great, they make a fabulous crusty dinner roll to serve with salads or soup, and again, the smell was fantastic.  The taste though just wasn't what I was expecting. It simply tasted like a fresh homemade french bread roll, with a tiny bit of spiciness. Now you must know that I made these for my Argentine husband, who is standing behind me as I type this, insisting that I tell you HE loved them and wants me to make them again. He says, and I quote; "they're delicious".  He's the best husband in the whole world, so of course I will make them for him again :-)  Thank you for the recipe Tom, and Diego Thanks you too!

An excellent base recipe that I'll use again.  It wasn't nearly as spicy as some of the reviews led me to expect and I used 4 cloves through the press. Maybe my spices are too old.  Sliced nicely, low crumb, still a good loaf after a few days.  I used flax instead of wheat bran and didn't notice any ill effects on the bread.

I did enjoy this bread.  I thought it lacked a little in cayenne, and the oregano was somewhat overpowering, but that may be my personal taste.  I would guess it goes really well with beef, though as a vegetarian I was stuck with eating it with baked beans.  Decent stuff, and good toasted, just go easy on the herbs.

I honestly can't IMAGINE that anyone could be disappointed in this bread, it is truly phenomenal!!  I add extra garlic (4 cloves total) but otherwise stick to the recipe exactly.  YUM!  Everyone in my family looks forward to 'leftovers night' ever since I started baking this bread to accompany it.  I let my bread machine do all the work (kneading & both rises) & then transfer to a bread pan to bake in the oven (30 minutes at 400 degrees)--I just prefer the shape of oven-baked bread.  Any doubts, ignore them!  You won't be sorry.

My family loves this bread!  I make fresh bread almost daily, but this is the first time I made a new recipe twice in one day.  The first loaf was intended for my son to take to his Spanish class, but my family ate it with dinner because they couldn't resist, so I made another one for him to take.  Made in the bread machine on dough cycle, shaped the loaf and baked in my oven at 350 for 30 min.  Followed the recipe as written, except subbed red wine vinegar for the white, wheat germ for the wheat bran, and used all-purpose flour as that was what I had on hand.  The dough is sticky, but is easily worked with a small amount of flour.  The finished loaf is light and full of flavor.  It also fills the kitchen and the house the best aroma as it mixes and bakes.    Mmmmm!!!!

Good and spicy!  I baked this hearty dense loaf with whole wheat flour instead of bread flour and honey instead of sugar at 375 for 35 minutes.  I'll be making this again!

A definite 5 star bread.  I'm still getting the hang of making bread (either by hand or with a bread machine), but this came out perfect.  The blend of spices was just right. I found the amount of cayenne perfect, but if you do enjoy spicy foods I think adding more cayenne would work well.  It was even better the next day toasted with butter.

This is a crusty and flavorful bread, great for sandwiches that contain only vegetables!  The moisture in flour varies, so I begin with only 3/4 cup of water and add more by the teaspoon if it's needed to form a good-looking smooth ball of dough.  I used cider vinegar and nobody arrested me :)

I had to add another cup of flour to this very wet sticky dough. Final product was gummy and not worth keeping the recipe. And, yes I know how to bake bread.

This was a very nice bread.  I did use fresh herbs rather than dried and I think that next time I will increase the herbs.  I did use the original amount of cayenne and garlic and thought that these would need to be increased also.  We did enjoy though.  Thanks so much for posting the recipe.

Very nice.  Flavorful, that's for certain, and I didn't think it was too spicy.  I thought it was rather easy too, and don't be afraid of all of the ingredients--if you cook a lot, you should have most everything.  I baked in the oven at 375 for 40 minutes and it was perfect.  Thanks for the recipe.

Wow, I was surprised at how lite this bread turned out.  Sometimes my homemade breads are to dense for my taste.  Everyone including my 2 year old loved this bread, very good with roast beef!  I added 2 more cloves of garlic as some users suggested and since I didn't have wheat bran I used wheat germ.  A little more salt, like 1/4 tsp. helps the flavor.  Also, I think the bread flour is very important, don't substitute.  I used the bread machine for the 1st rise and sometime during the second rise I transferred to a bread pan.  Then I set my oven on proof and placed the bread in with a sauce pan of very hot water.  It rose very fast!!  I left the bread in while the oven was preheating to 350 and then baked for 20 minutes.  Will make again, for sure!

This is an excellent recipe! It has quite a kick. I upped the cayenne by just a bit and I mixed fresh and dried oregano together. I also upped the garlic by adding another small clove. I used the dough setting on my machine, then took it out and shaped the dough into four small individual-sized loaves. I let it rise for another hour then baked it in my oven at 350* for about 40 minutes. The crust and texture were perfect! My Argentinian friend said it was most excellent!

The first time I made this I stuck everything in the bread machine because I was leaving for work and didn't have time to make it by hand. When I pulled the loaf out of the machine it had fallen and had a funny texture. I made it again by hand and left out the vinegar, baked it in a 9x5 pan at 400 and it came out perfect. I doubled the cayenne and still couldn't taste it, and upped the herbs and spices by maybe half. The flavor was good, but it tasted just a lot like any regular herb bread.

This bread turned out great, and I was a little bit worried because I didn't have the 3 tbsp of wheat bran, so I substituted 3 tbsp oat bran but turned out no problem.  I used the bread maker on dough/pasta cycle and then just took the dough out, divided it and made 1 dozen medium sized dinner rolls which I baked for 20 minutes at 350, great recipe worth trying.

This bread tasted nothing like I thought it would.  But let me tell you, I was not disappointed in the least!  The spices marry wonderfully for a very unique taste.  I used my bread machine to mix the dough, then baked in a 9X5 pan at 400 degrees for 30 minutes like another review had suggested.  When first pulled from the oven, the outside of the bread was very hard.  However, after cooling for 10 minutes, it became softer and very easy to slice.  The consistency of the inside of the bread was soft and moist. This bread was a wonderful compliment to our pork and sauerkraut dinner.  The next day, I used the left-overs to make sandwiches and the bread was still soft fresh tasting. I highly recommend this bread.  Please give it a try.  You won't be disappointed!

I am very gluten intolerant, so I made this bread using Red Fife Flour, a wheat that is much more digestible for me since it has different levels of gluten compared to modern wheat.  It is roughly 1/3 gliadin and 2/3 glutenin.   I get the Red Fife from a local Mennonite farmer in Ontario.
Since the gluten is different, it takes longer to rise, and you need to adjust the water levels compared to the standard recipe.  
I used about 1/3 cup kefir for some of the liquid, so it will help it to rise too.   I used the remaining ingredients as directed on the recipe.
I placed it near my hot oven to rise, and once it finally rose, then it baked up really well and smelled so good.
I will try this again with my spelt flour, another cousin of wheat, and again, I might have to adjust the liquid, and give it the right amount of time to rise.  
Overall, this was a very good bread, this kind of flour tends to be a little more dense than the regular flour, so slice it up thinner if you want.  
It was not even spicy to me at all, and I doubled the garlic.    I'll try more herbs and spices next time.
I don't even buy gluten free breads because so far I don't like the taste much.  I make Rye bread (low gluten) too, which is very slow to rise, so in comparison, this bread was still a good bread to make with Red Fife.

I don't have a bread maker so I proofed the yeast in the water and honey, I subbed honey for the sugar, and then put everything in my kitchen aide. Nice flavour, reminded me of focaccia. Thanks for sharing.

Made it exactly as written the first time. That is how all ratings should be based. Dense, and flavorful. Excellent toasted then melted cheese on top. This bread makes a bowl of soup a hearty meal.  

Over the past 6 months I continued to tweak to my own liking... This recipe is a great jumping off place. In slow increments, I eventually doubled all the spices and chopped onion to 1/2 onion and now use whole wheat flour and balsamic vinegar. This is my favorite treat just for me. Thanks Tom for sharing.

This dough was way too wet. I added 2 tbsp of flour during the first knead cycle to get the dough to form a ball.  However, the moisture from the veggies and herbs caused my loaf to collapse after rising. Flavor is great though. I'll slice and dice this loaf to make stuffing. If I make it again with more flour, I can't wait to make grilled cheese with it.

Delicious bread!  I put the ingredients in the bread machine for the dough cycle and then transferred it to a 9x5 pan.  After the bread rose I put it in the oven for 25 minutes at 400 degrees.

This bread smells wonderful. Y made it without a bread machine. You can feel almost every ingredient in this flavor. I like chimichurri sauce and I like this bread now.

I took this to a supper club.  I followed the directions except I replaced the wheat germ with Quinoa (I could't find wheat germ).  I then used the dough cycle on my bread machine and then made 24 rolls.  I let them rise for an hour and they didn't move!  I cooked them anyway as others suggested.  I was very disappointed in my hockey pucks.  I hope it was just my yeast?  Was it the Quinoa?  However, lots seemed to enjoy the flavor of my hocky pucks!

I found this bread easy to make,
delicious. I changed the flour to
whole wheat, added 2 tbsp.of bran
flakes, and instead of minced garlic,
I used 2 tbsp of garlic powder. It
seemed to distribute the taste better
throughout the bread.
