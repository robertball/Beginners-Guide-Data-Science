I made these for a baby shower and they were excellent.  I made them as mini-muffins and added a splash of worchestershire sauce.  Everyone was talking about how good they were.  I made them the night before and stored them in the fridge.  We warmed them in a warming oven for about 20 minutes the next day and they were perfect.

Great Recipe!
When mixing it up, the seemed a bit dry, so I added some sour cream and an egg or two.  They turned out amazing!!

These were made for a baby shower.  I made in mini muffin tins and had some left over so I made into standard size muffins.  I REALLY prefer them in the bite size mini version.  The big ones were just too doughy.  I did get asked for the recipe and they would be good to make ahead, freeze & reheat when needed either for a party or a quick breakfast on the go.

Great recipe... simple and delicious. Great for breakfast on the go... great for company... easy serving. Only change I would make to the recipe... add a little more shredded cheese next time around. Make these muffins... you'll be glad you did!

Very good and easy to make.  I used about a cup and a half of cheese and this recipe made 12 regular sized muffins and 24 mini-muffins.  I froze most of them and then warmed them up for a quick breakfast in the microwave on low power and they still tasted great.

Yummy! I've done these twice now - once as written and once I added a can of chopped green chilies (sp?). My guys love them and I know they'll be great for them to keep in the freezer at the hunting camp.

This recipe was fantastic. I made them for my bf and he loved them. There are only two of us so that was a lot for 2 people. I made the full recipe, we ate what we wanted and I froze the rest. We had them as a quick and convenient breakfast for the next week or two. The only thing I changed was I added a little more cheese because my bf loves cheese. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe.

These were easy to make and pretty darn tasty!   I made them last night for a road trip today, I had one at room temp this morning and it still tasted great. But definitely best warm.  I made some minor changes to the recipe. first off they didn't have any plain cheese soup left at the store, only broccoli & cheese, I definitely would try it this way as the broccoli adds another layer of flavor and a little more texture. Also the sausage I used was Parsley & Cheese flavored, again awesome choice as it added some flavor. I also sprinkled just a little adobo on the sausage as it was cooking. I'm sure the recipe is good as is but trust me there is definitely room to add some flavor in which ever way you'd like. Oh yeah almost forgot, as another reviewer mentioned, the batter is a little dry so I added two eggs to the mixture.   I made mine in regular size muffin trays, they don't rise very much so don't be afraid to fill each cup to the top.   My picky son ate one and asked for another so you better believe I'll be making these again!!

I just made these to serve for breakfast tomorrow morning. The only change I made in ingredients was to use turkey sausage, since my family prefers it. I did also use mini-muffin pans rather than larger muffin tins. I sprayed my pans with Pam and did not use papers. I'm not noticing that these are greasy, as another reviewer stated, in fact they are really beautiful little biscuits. The one I tested was really good, but I do think they could use just a little more flavor (could be the turkey sausage), so the next time I make them (and I definitely will) I'll add a little seasoning and maybe some onion to the sausage when I brown it. Excellent and easy! Thank you.

These sounded better than they actually were. The cheese made them really oily/greasy and you could see it on the paper liners, feel it on your fingers, and on your tongue. That was a negative. On the plus side these were very generous with the sausage/batter ratio and were moist and nicely flavored with the sausage. I thought they were lacking something though, I don't know what. My husband thought they needed a bowl of milk/cream gravy to go with them. Thanks, this will be a nice change for my family's grab and go weekday breakfasts.

Super easy and yummy. I used sage sausage and added 1 egg and a tad bit more shredded cheese. I took the suggestion to make them into mini muffins. It made 40. I'm going to put them into the freezer and thaw as needed. They'll be the perfect size for my 18 month old for breakfast.

These are WAY better than the usual sausage balls!! Much lighter, tastier and easier!! I also like how you don't have to mess with trying to mix raw sausage like you do with the others--yuck!
I will be making these instead of sausage balls. Thanks for posting!!

these were great.  i used broccoli cheese soup - would certainly do that again.  going to try regular cheese soup tonight & punch up the flavor somehow.  These make a great lunch alternative to a sandwich.

We absolutely love this recipe.  I make a batch on Sundays.  That way we can grab one as we're running out to work during the week.  I'm thinking of experimenting by substituting broccoli for the sausage for a completely different taste.

Made these for 25 Navy guys who came for a soup kitchen garden work day. I think they disappeared in about 45 seconds. Will make a double batch next time. These are really more like biscuits than muffins so will make them as drop biscuits next time. It was challenging getting them out of the muffin tins (didn't use papers). Only addition...added 1/4 tsp of chipotle chili sauce.

DELICIOUS!!!  This recipe makes exactly twenty-four muffins.  Don't use the cupcake liners - they'll stick to the paper.  Instead, use two greased cupcake/muffin pans.  I double the shredded cheddar cheese to two cups, making these muffins incredibly moist.

Fantastic recipe!  I had a pound of pork sausage I thawed by accident, so was looking for a different recipe, when I came across this one.  The family LOVED it!  I used my mini-muffin pan and baked for 20 minutes.  I've made the recipe 3 times in the last week ~ sharing at work and at a friends breakfast.

These were good, but not great. I had a recipe years ago that did not use the condensed cheese soup and it was much better. These muffins were a little too moist, they did not have the right muffin consistency. With a little tweaking these would be good.
