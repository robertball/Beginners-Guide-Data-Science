This lasagna is so easy that we make it at least twice a month.  My kids love it and don't even notice the difference between the ingredients!

Light - yes, very light on flavour.  Delicious - NOT.  Ground turkey does not have a good flavour.  Tomato sauce lacking in flavour.

This was so tasty! I didn't have oregano, so I left it out. I did use regular Parmesan cheese and mozerella. The flavor is quite good, and I feel like it's still healthy, even with the regular cheese...Would make again! Gave a piece to my mother and she really liked it too (very picky!)

Great recipe! Did not follow it to a tee since I didn't have everything on hand, but substituted for what I did have. I used broccoli and roasted red peppers instead of zucchini. I used 1 container of cottage cheese (2 cups/500ml) which I put all on the same layer, thus the upper layer of cheese was simply mozz and some parmesan. I used a large can of tomato sauce (680ml) rather than paste and only had 1 can of diced tomatoes on hand. I used a frozen block of spinach (thawed from the night before). I put an extra layer of noodles on top with some sauce and parm. cheese on them to help avoid from hardening too much...all in all it tasted great!

I made a Gluten free version by using rice lasagna noodles. I cooked the noodles half the time specified on the box and that was about right. My family raved about this recipe. It was very tasty and a real treat for my gluten free hubby.

I've made this twice now - using summer squash instead of zukes and chard instead of spinach and just as delicious as with the intended ingredients. Fantastic recipe! I love to make it and then have it to eat for lunch at work for the rest of the week. Thank you for posting!

Very delicious, though I left out the pasta and just put layers of zucchini. Made it once, and making it again and again.

Love this - used strips zucchini to replace the noodles.  Accidently used diced tomatoes w/ green chilies (got most of the chilies out but it worked because it added a kick).   Probably would drain tomatoes because it was really watery since I did not use the no boil noodles.
