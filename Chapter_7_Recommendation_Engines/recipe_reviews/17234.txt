Really great cake!  This can also be made in a 9x13 pan if you don't want to do layers and it tastes better the longer it sits in the fridge.

I won't be making this very often as it is waaaay too good.  Can hardly stop with just one piece.  My family all loved it.  Will save it for special occasions like Thanksgiving or Christmas.  It was moist, delicious and so easy to make.  I agree that it probably wouldn't trvel well, but I made it in a 9x13 pan, which would travel easier than a layer cake.

In South Carolina we definitely call this Pig Pickin' Cake. The pig is cooked outdoors, usually on large gas cookers. The cooked meat is chopped & sauce added. Then everyone "picks" their BBQ from the pig. It's a southern thing like boiled peanuts. This cake is delicious and is often served at a pig pickin', but it's great anytime.

I made mine in a 9x13 pan.  The consistency of the cake was great - very moist, but it lacked enough flavor for me to rate it 5 stars.  I recommend making a trial run at this recipe before planning to serve for an event/special occasion.  I think it is an acquired taste.

My mom made this for all sorts of pot-lucks when I was growing up.  The only difference was that she didn't stop at adding the cool-whip mixture between the cakes, she then "iced" the whole thing with it....yummy!  I think it's even better the 2nd day.

Although, I have always heard it called pea pickin cake. I always assumed it came from Tennessee Ernie Ford's old addage for Martha White cornmeal. "It's pea-picking good!!"

This cake/dessert is fabulous!  It also works well in a 9x13" pan for simplicity.  It is also wonderful with a cou of choppe walnuts sprinkled over the top.

This is one of my favorite cakes.  I had lost my aunts recipe. I was so glad to find it here.  One note, my daddy liked it best when I added a glaze made with Morgans Spiced Rum to the layers prior to frosting/layering.

Odd name but delicious.  I made this as a single layer cake in a rectangle pan.  The only thing I added was about a 1/2 cup of toasted coconut to the top of the cake.  This is more like a pie than a cake.  Everyone loved it.  This was great on a very hot July 4th week.  I will make again.

A family favorite for years but we have always called it Pig Lickin' Cake. I usually make it in a 9x13" pan (for about 35 minutes) and leave out the nuts and coconut.

This was a easy,fun cake to make. I did add in and make changes, but I am sure it would still be a 4 to 5 star cake regardless. I used a lemon cake mix. The lemon with the coconut, pineapple, and mandarian oranges works very well. I made the filling with extra roasted coconut. I had to use walnuts, didn't have pecans. I roasted the chopped walnuts too. The biggy was the lemon pie filling in the second layer. I had 2 fillings! I used a canned lemon pie filling, for extra goo. Next time I think I will move the crushed pineapple into the lemon filling, then use extra coconut to beef up the whipped cream filling/icing. It was a pretty cake. I sprinkled toasted coconut and dotted a few whole walnuts on top. I make a sheet cake, cut it in half and created 2 layers.

Would add cream cheese and confectioner's sugar to the frosting to make it richer. It's a very good, moist cake.

This cake was SOOOO delicious!  I made it for a pot luck at the office and it was devoured in minutes!  I used a lemon cake mix instead.  Everyone loved and want me to make it all of the time now.  Luckily, it is really simple. Thanks for making me look good!  ;)

This is one of my absolute favorite cakes. My mom has made it for years. This was my second time making it and it came out great. The only change I made was in apprearance. I frosted the entire cake and put coconut on top as well. I served it for my boyfriends birthday and he just loved it.

This cake was delicious and certainly made an impression on my guests.  I used sugar free pudding and cool whip free.  No one noticed.  I figured the pecans added enough calories!  Everyone asked for the recipe.

This is a GREAT cake. My family just loves it! It is especially good in the spring and summertime as it is light and fruity. But one thing to remember...it really doesn't travel well....so it's best to make it where you're going to serve it.

There aren’t any 18.25 oz cake mixes in any of the stores I shop at.  They are all 15.25.  Has anyone reformulated this to take that into account?  My results are less than stellar.

Great recipe. I substituted minced peaches with lemon and lime juice for the crushed pineapple with juice filling due to my daughters allergy. I would highly recommend this cake for a picnic or social luncheon due to its lightness on the stomach.

Cake was very dry. I made it in a 9x13 pan. I hope it may moisten up after it refrigerates a day or two.  I had to add confectioners sugar to topping for extra sweetness.

I did it in a 9 x 13 glass pan at 350 for about 30 minutes. Check it at 25 minutes to be sure it doesn't get too done.

Made this for my husband's 60th birthday. He LOVES nuts and coconut, so I toasted the pecans and put 1/2 cup of them in the cake mix, along with a 1/2 cup of coconut. Then also put the same amount in the filling. I toasted 1/4 cup of coconut for the top of the cake, and reserved 5 orange slices for the top as well. He said it is the best birthday cake he has had in all of his 60 years! Very moist, light, sweet but not rich. It's really delicious!

I make this cake for family gatherings in a 9x13 pan - makes it easier to serve.  I use butter instead of margarine and a larger can of oranges in the batter for more flavor.  I arrange mandarin orange sections and pecan halves on top of the frosting to pretty it up.  Make a day ahead and store in the fridge - it tastes better.

I made this for a Mardi Gras themed dinner party. It was a huge hit! Everyone just laughed at the name and kept asking why is it called that. The only adjustments I made was to toast both the coconut and pecans. It looks and tastes great when toasted!

I made mine in a 9 x 13 pan. It was better than fantastic! My hubby is a chocolate cake fanatic, but he ate a very large piece of this and asked for more!! I will make this often.

Delicious. I only cook with butter (not margarine), but didn't change anything else.

Everyone loved it. I prefer not to use frozen whipped topping so substituted ricotta cheese,powdered sugar, and vanilla extract in the food processor til smooth. It worked great, by the time you stir in the pineapple and pudding mix you never miss the cool whip. Just be sure to process a long time til it's super smooth. I think cream cheese and a little milk would work as well. I've tried yogurt in the past as a cool whip replacement but it's tough to disguise the sour yogurt-y taste.
