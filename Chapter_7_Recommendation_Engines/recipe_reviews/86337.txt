I think this could be really good, but with changes. The strawberry/wine/orange combination is excellent, but the marinated strawberries are far too acidic and strong. I'd also like it if the marinade was thicker and more like a sauce. I might try something like this again, but definately not this exactly. It tastes like sangria mixed with ice cream.

Delicious!! We tried this with friends after a BBQ the other night...it was sophisticated and decadent. I recommend using good quality vanilla iced cream like Haagen Daz or Breyers.
