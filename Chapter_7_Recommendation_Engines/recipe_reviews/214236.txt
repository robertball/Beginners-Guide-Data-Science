This was quick and easy enough to make on a busy day and it was delicious. The only change I made was to use half fresh and half frozen raspberries (defrosted in the microwave and drained-they're cheaper than fresh and worked well). My whole family loved it. I will be making this cake again for company. Great dessert for a summer BBQ.

made this cake today for a co workers birthday.   I got rave reviews and many requests for the recipe.  I used blackberries instead of raspberries and raspberry jello.  I will be making this cake again.  I probably will use blueberries or strawberries next time.

This was exactly what I was looking for-a light dessert after a heavy meal.  Very good flavor and easy to make. I did not frost with cool whip, I put it to the side for others to frost themselves, some just ate the cake without it.

Just made this today.....what a wonderful dessert.  Served it without the Cool Whip & my family all agreed...the Cool Whip would have made it too sweet. (for our liking)   Will DEFINITELY be making this one again. :-)    Thanks for sharing.  :-D

I thought that this was an extremely easy recipe.  I was able to make it inbetween children's activities and housework!  It has a light flavor and was a huge hit at work!  I am definitely making this again as soon as possible.  I used half fresh raspberries and half frozen that I let defrost on my counter (covered) and then used Raspberry jello instead of strawberry.  I probably used more marshmallows too but that was because I love marshmallows!  Fantastic dessert!

This was really tasty, but I didn't think it was very good leftovers.. if you don't eat all that day it kind of goes soggy. But it was still really good though, and i made home-made whipped cream instead.
