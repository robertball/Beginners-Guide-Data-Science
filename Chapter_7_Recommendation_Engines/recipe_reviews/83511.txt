I've been making this recipe for years. Only I use garlic salt and pepper to season the ribs. Then I brown them and leave them at the bottom of the pan and put the sauerkraut on top. The garlic salt really adds some zip to the meat. I serve it with mashed potatoes and my husband is in heaven.

Das ist gut!!  Just like Mama used to make. :)  I used boneless country ribs and they came out nice and tender.  I used garlic powder, onion salt and pepper over the ribs before the first bake.  I used a can of sauerkraut, (forgot to check how much they called for here before fixing) but next time I'd use two cans, it went quickly!  I increased the cooking time to ensure the ribs would be tender. :)  This is a keeper!

I doubled the time for the ribs and the kraut.  The ribs were cooked ok, but not falling off the bone tender. Agree with an earlier reviewer, an hour for the ribs and three hours for everything combined.

Also, I added 1/4 of a chopped onion to the sauerkraut.  It was too crunchy and prominent at the end.  Pre-cooking is needed.

Nice basic recipe. browned the ribs in the oven, drained off the fat, then put them in a slow cooker. To the kraut I drained only half the liquid, shredded a small apple, and medium potato. I tossed this together with a tablespoon of caraway seeds, and placed this mixture in and around the ribs, cooked them on low for six hrs. The end result, was a falling off the bone, flavorful meal. I served these with twice backed potatoes.

I TRIED THIS RECIPE AND EVEN TWEAKING IT, IT CAME OUT BAD. IF YOU TRY THIS, I WOULD SUGGEST INTERMINGLING THE SAUERKRAUT ALL OVER THE RIBS TO GIVE A BETTER TASTE AND ELIMINATE THE PEPPER AND SALT AND ADD GALIC AND ONION POWDER. WE HAD TO COOK OURS WAY LONGER, AND IT CAME OUT TOUGH, FAR FROM WHAT WE EXPECTED. NOT A WAY TO START OUT THE NEW YEAR.

Most excellent! I've made this recipe twice in the past two weeks...once with bone-in and once with boneless ribs and it turned out fabulous on each occasion. I also used "plain" sauerkraut once and kraut with caraway seeds once...each magnificent! One caveat: if you read the recipe and follow the part about 30 mins at 350 degrees....trichinosis is likely to ensue and the potatoes will be as hard as quantum mechanics. A solid hour in the oven,at a minimum, and the tenderness of the ribs will bring tears to your eyes.

Its a good basic recipes that can take tweaking.  I sprinkled the ribs with some ground sage as well as the salt and pepper.  Also added a bay leaf to the sauerkraut.  I also baked the ribs at 350 for 1 hour before adding the vegetables and then left it at that temp for another hour.  The ribs literally fell off the bones! My husband just loved it and it's now a part of our permanent recipe collection.

I LOVE country ribs and sauerkraut!!! I always come to this site to double check, to seeif what I'm thinking of making is here. I have made this on my own without a recipe. I thought I'd just check to see if maybe there were some other ideas. I always brown my ribs in a frying pan 1st. Don't need to add oil. The ribs have MORE than enough grease to cook with. That grease gets tossed out. I season with salt (not much, as the sauerkraut has plenty) pepper, granulated garlic and Johnnys Seasoning. I then place the ribs in my crock pot, with the sauerkraut. Put the lid on, place the crock pot on high, and go about my way. About an hour before we eat, I make mashed potatoes. MY personal little trick with my mashed potatoes is, instead of using milk with a little bit of butter with pepper, is to use a little bit of canned milk. To my family and myself, it makes the mashed potatoes not quite so thin. Then we can make a little well in the center of the potatoes and put sauerkraut and juice over the top. This is my little kingdom of heaven. Thank you for putting this recipe up!!! It's wonderful.

Update to my previous rating.  I used 'sliced spareribs' (not country style), sorry for the error.

This has been an all time favorite in my family. I did make a few changes. Boil bone in ribs to get the grease out. Use only B&G brand canned saurkraut,(makes a big difference in flavor) place ribs and saurkraut in baking dish add 1/2 cup of water. Place in oven at 400 degrees for 45 mins to an hour. Baste twice and the saurkraut is tangy and sweet and the ribs melt in your mouth! Very good recipe!

I made this recipe on my slow cooker instead of the oven. I layered the sauerkraut, ribs and potatoes and cooked as other spare rib recipes for the slowcooker recoment. I also aded some mustard to my rib seasoning and apple juice for liquid. I will definately make this recipe again!!!!

They were tasty, I would make them again. But you really DO have to drain ALL of the grease before covering and baking second time around. I DID and they were still a bit greasy. But I will make them again.

I gave this one four stars only because I did some tweaking. I took the advice of some reviewers, and browned ribs in a pan, baked ribs for one hour at 400 (covered), added the kraut and baked for three and a half hours at 300 (covered with foil), added a little water, brown sugar and shredded apple to the kraut before baking.  My gosh, these were so good!  Just like my mom made.  No need for a fork because the meat was so tender.  Served with rye bread and mashed potatoes.  I absolutely will make these again.  Thanks so much for sharing.

Good basic recipe.  I seared boneless county ribs, on the grill.  Seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder.  Used 2 cans of kraut,  shredded an apple into it too.  layered crock pot with kraut on bottom, then the ribs on top and surrounded that with potatoes.  cooked on low for 6-8 hours, came out tasty, good and tender.  Family loved it.

I grill the ribs first, searing them at high heat then cooking them indirectly for an hour or so at medium heat.  I seanson the ribs with coarse pepper, sea salt, and garlic powder before grilling, then add them to the kraut mixture, cover and cook in a preheated 300 degree oven for a couple of hours.  Excellent with rye bread and boiled new potatoes with butter and parsley.

Classic German. Just like I had growing up. I did increase cooking time about 20 min. Beef ribs can be used too. Probably the best way to cook beef ribs.

We enjoyed it. After cooking at 450 for 25 minutes, I cooked it at 325 for an hour and it could have cooked longer to make the meat more tender, but it was tender enough. The kraut keeps the meat juicy. I included some of the kraut juice otherwise I thought it would be too dry and it was just right.

Very bland.  Needed more seasoning.  Also needed to cook an extra 1/2 hour since potatoes were undercooked by that amount of time.  Could have used a 2nd package of sauerkraut too.
