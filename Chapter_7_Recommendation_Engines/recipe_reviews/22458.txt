I think many people misunderstand what a muffin is...the Otis Spunkmeyer muffins, for instance, are little more than cake disguised in a breakfast-friendly package. These Oatmeal muffins are more like what muffins started out to be. Simple (albeit somewhat bland) additions to a meal. I find that they are perfect in their simplicity, a wonderful base to a dollup of jam. The original recipe I had called for 1/4 to 1/2 cup of honey or molasses instead of sugar and was a nice 'non-jolting' way to begin the day. They are a good base to add fruit or nuts. I like banana with pecans; chopped apple and cinnamon; dates with extra molasses. Tailor them to your tastebuds, but don't mistake them for a cake-like muffin. These are much more substantial, and you won't be hungry in an hour.

I altered most of the ingredients for a healthier alternative, and they always turn out great!  I use soy milk instead of regular milk (I use chocolate or vanilla flavoured, then I leave out the sugar in the recipe).  I use applesauce instead of vegetable oil.  Whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose. And if I use plain soy milk, I use honey instead of the white sugar.  Basically this adds soy protein and fiber, while cutting down on calories and fat.  A delicious alternative to a store bought granola bar.

I've made this recipe many times now and tried lots of additions - one mashed banana w/ pecans, blueberry and grated lemon peel, grated apple and cinnamon... etc... all have been good.  I've also increased the sugar to 1/3c (and sometimes use brown) and substituted buttermilk for the sweet milk - this recipe is incredibly easy and versatile and has become my new base muffin recipe!  Thanks, Tony!

I love this recipe.  It's very flexible and forgiving.  I use applesauce instead of oil, and brown sugar in place of the white.  Sometimes I add some snipped fruit (apricots, prunes) or finely chopped apple. I love the texture and they're not too sweet.  Great with a cup o' tea in the morning.  (they freeze well)

This was a great recipe! I agree with the other reviews - it is kind of simple, it would be great with fruit added. I added cinnamon, nutmeg and chopped nuts. I also replaced the vegetable oil with applesauce, to reduce the fat and calories, and used brown sugar instead of white. They still turned out great. The batter seemed a little runny, but the muffins turned out great. Much lighter than my usual bran muffin recipes.

I liked this recipe. I have made it twice now. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and had very nice muffins, but I agree with some other reviewers that it was a little bland. The second time I altered the recipe beyond recognition, still with good results. I wanted a morning glory style muffin using what I had on hand so here is what I did. For the oats and flour I used 1/2 c corn meal, 1/2 c wheat flour, 1/2 c wheat germ, and 1/2 c all purpose flour. Instead of just milk I used 1/2 c pumpkin , 1/2 c milk, and finally instead of sugar I used pure honey. The result was a golden, yummy healthy muffin, not too sweet but full of flavor. This recipe is wonderful as a starting point.

What a great muffin recipe! Nice because it is low fat....I added apple sauce in place of the oil. If you do this, you may want to spray your muffin cups with a little cooking spray so the papers don't stick to the muffins. I also added some cinnamon and raisins. I also decreased the baking time by 5 minutes, as recommended by another user. The texture and taste are great!
Thanks for offering this recipe:)

These were excellent! I make a lot of muffins and I am always looking for new recipes. I used the old-fashioned oats and added some craisins to the batter. These had a moist texture. LOts of "add-in" possibilities. Today I'm making them with salted peanuts.

Yumyum!

I simply loved this recipe! I doubled it and made 8 huge muffins! Ths recipe is sooo easy and healthy alternative to the butter-sugar bombs out there. This one gives you muffins soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. And it keeps you full for quite some time! Loved it, thank you!

Hubby loves these! I did add some cinnamon and used 1/2 brown sugar. I made 6 muffins and baked as usual but with the rest of the batter, I added a little milk and made waffles out of it! EXELLANT and so healthy!

I doubled the recipe and added 2-3 tsp vanilla, 2-3 tsp cinnamon and 2 chopped up apples.  I used brown sugar instead of white sugar.  I'm not sure my kids will eat them becaue they are so bland.  I will not make these again.

Let's face it, today's so-called "Muffins" are merely cupcakes without frosting!  
I have to agree with "Steen71688", below.  These are what are truly considered to be "Muffins"!
I agree that the recipe is a bit bland but sometimes that's exactly what I'm looking for rather than a dessert.
I tried adding 1/2 t. maple flavored extract but I can't really taste it.  Next time I may try adding cinnamon.

These muffins are really good.  I doubled the recipe and made 18 large muffins.  I also did what others suggested and increased the sugar a little (2/3 cup instead of 1/2 for the double recipe) and added cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla and about 1/4 cup raisins to half the batter.  (I don't like raisins in muffins)  I did find that the muffins were not as sweet as they could be, but were absolutely decadent when I drizzled a little bit of sweetened condensed milk on them.  The raisins helped sweeten them a lot.

This recipe is certainly a keeper.

These were quite tasty.  Even with the oats, they turned out light and chewy. I love this recipe because it's so adaptable. Remember DON'T OVERMIX.  That makes tough muffins.  You should still see streaks of flour.  Muffins are so forgiving to everything but overmixing. I changed the recipe according to my tastes.  I wanted orange-y muffins with nuts.  I doubled the recipe. I used rolled oats because I like their flavor better. They soak up more liquid so I added a bit more in other places. I used buttermilk and a 6oz container of vanilla yogurt instead of milk and brown sugar.  I mixed that together with the zest of two oranges and 1/4 cup of OJ and let it sit.  I subbed half the flour with wheat flour, added 1.5 tsp each cinnamon and vanilla, some nutmeg, and a dash of allspice.  I added 1/4 cup of applesauce and 1/3c oil.  I added 1c nuts and mixed everything together.  Then I divided the batter into two and added blueberries to one bowl and bittersweet chocolate chips to the other.  I topped them with turbinado sugar.  It doesn't melt and makes them look professional and pretty.  I love the crunch!

These were very good and easy! Definately did not need to leave these in the oven for 20-25 min!! They took about 15 and I started to smell a slight burn so I took them out just in time. Not too sweet and, even better, contain oatmeal! I may go out on a limb next time and add some strawberries to the batter. I also used brown sugar instead of white and some vanilla and cinnamon.

Add 1/2 to 1 tsp of nutmeg and lightly toast the oats before you mix them in, it really brings out the flavor of the oats.

I love this recipe.  For a variation, I used 3 instant oatmeal packets because I was out of regular oatmeal.  It is wonderful with fruit and cream varieties or just the flavored ones.  You can make any flavor this way really fast.  I now keep lots of different kinds of instant flavors because this is requested so often by my kids also.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

These are my new favourite muffins. Great plain of fill muffin tins half-full, add 1 tablespoon of apricot fruit spread, then top with rest of batter. Nice for breakfast with hot tea.

I agree with steen71688- these are good substantial muffins! I add different things to mine each time I make them- raisins, bananas, walnuts- whatever I have on hand. The kids love them & with my son starting school tomorrow, I'm making a batch of these right now for snack time!*i forgot to add that I have used Soy milk when we ran out of reg.milk, and King Arthur's whole-wheat-white flour, with great results!

The muffins were very good, however I found them to be pretty small. I would double the recipe in the future. 

I added half a banana, some walnuts and a bit of brown sugar to half the recipe, and added a bit of blueberry jam in the center of the other 6 muffins. Very good and moist!

These muffins are delicious, actually I made them in a 9 inch round because I was in a hurry and was baking biscotti at the same time and needed the oven.   I added one teaspoon of uns. cocoa to the mix.....we all loved the muffin cake...will def. make it again.

I'm glad I added blueberries, otherwise these muffins would have not been sweet enough for my taste. I used half white and half whole wheat flour,honey because I didn't have any sugar and finally apple sauce instead of oil. A very easy recipe to make all those substitutions, my favourite part was the texture of the muffins.

made a double batch and increased sugar to 1 cup. the result after 3 batches was 21 muffins each time. Also used white sugar, then 1/2 c white and 1/2 brown sugar, and then dark brown sugar. Prefer the 1/2 & 1/2 mixture.

This muffin recipe is a good starting point, but it needs something.  I added 1 cup chopped pecans, 1 medium diced granny smith apple, 1.5 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp grated nutmeg.   The apple made the muffins very moist and light, but they still lacked something.  Next time I make them, I will add another .5 tsp of cinnamon and maybe a tsp or so of apple pie spice. As well, the apple is a nice idea, but next time I will use a sweeter apple (both DH and I found the muffins lacked sweetness).  The only other point to mention is that I reduced the heat to 350 and cooked the muffins for 25 minutes.

These are great because they're light, not too sweet, and simple to make!
I'll often replace half or more of the oil with applesauce though. I also add a touch of vanilla and cinnamon for added sweetness. =)

I found these turned out small, so I added 3/4 cup of chocolate chips and made 10 instead of 12. They were really good and my 3-year-old loved them.

These muffins turned out light, fluffy, and delicious for me, despite the fact that I put 2tsp of baking SODA in instead!

this recipe worked so well for me today!  i added a medium apple cut in chunks, cinnamon, and some mini chocolate chips.  i then baked them in a popsicle pan, inserted popsicle sticks when they were cooled, and dipped the ends in chocolate.  they looked like fudge pops and they were delicious!  big hit with the kids. thanks!

This translates nicely into a loaf by simply doubling the recipies.  I like simplicity so I just tossed some cinnamon in the batter and the result was a mildly flavorful bread.  Great warm in the morning and it keeps your full.

Very good basic oatmeal muffin. I use these with my own additions and they turn out well every time. I add cocoa or berries and sometimes coconut and nuts, depending on the preferred taste that day and all turn out well. I did change the bak time to 15 minutes as they don't take any longer. I honestly don't know how you can go wrong with this recipe.

This is a pretty good recipe, and definitely simple and easy.  But don't cook them as long as it says!  Probably 15-18 minutes would be better.  I cooked them for 20 minutes, and figured I would for sure be safe with the minimum amount of time. But when I took them out of the oven they were way over cooked, on the verge of burnt, and burnt on some of the bottoms.  That was pretty disappointing. Though they were still not too bad with some margarine and jam (a bit dry though). I will make these muffins again, but I would definitely never cook them that long again.

This is a great base for muffins like so many other reviewers have noted.  To add a little spunk, i added a mashed banana, 1/3 cup raisins, a little cinnamon, nutmeg, and a pinch of allspice. I also subsituted whole wheat flour and added 1/3 cup flax seeds to make them a little healthier.  They are delicious.  The only muffin pan i had was for miniatures, so i decreased the bake time to 15 minutes at 425.  they turned out sooo good.

I made these muffins twice today. I had planned to use some of the other reviewers suggestions the first time around, but I was visiting with my daughter and I completely forgot to make the changes.  They were very bland made as directe; I threw them away. The second time I equal parts brown sugar, white sugar, regular milk and butter milk and quick cooking oats and old fashioned oats. I also added vanilla, cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice. I divided the batter and Added choc. chips to some, dried cranberries to some and left some plain. Thanks everyone for your great ideas they are wonderful! I had to threaten my family to stay out of them as they are for Christmas morning breakfast tomorrow!

Good, simple muffin recipe. I added 1/2 tsp. vanilla, a little extra sugar, and a dash of cinnamon (because I just couldn't help myself), but they were excellent. I would also like to try apple, raisins, or coconut in the future. Perfect with a cup of coffee, butter and homemade jam for breakfast, or with vegetable soup for lunch.

These muffins were delicious!  I've made several batches now and every time they come out moist inside and slightly crunchy on the top.  I've added several different things for flavor (candied ginger, lemon, banana, nuts...) and I've also just made them plain.  Every time they've been gobbled up.  If you want something sweet, I suggest increasing the sugar, but I think they're great as is.

I like!  I'm pregnant and was looking for a quick, easy, wholesome breakfast.  Found the recipe yesterday and made them last night.  I added some butterscotch morsels as well.  Considering the household ingredients and ease of making, they are quite good, moist.  I recommend!

We're snowed in here and I havn't been to the grocery store in a few days, and I desperately needed something for breakfast.  Found this recipe and had all the ingredients, so I thought I'd give it a try. It is indeed easy, but I found them to be too salty.  The next time I make these I'll only use a pinch of salt as opposed to 1/2 tsp. I also added 1/3 cup of packed brown sugar instead of 1/4 c of white sugar.  I also added raisins, allspice and cinnamon. When I mixed the wet and dry ingredients together the mixture was too dry and not like a muffin batter, so I added a 1/2 c more milk. AFTER all these changes I had a muffin that looks good , but the flavour still needs to be "kicked up a few notches".I'll keep experimenting with this one.

I love how quick and easy this recipe is! It turned out moist and just perfect for breakfast. I have already made these three times and it's great  everytime. I made these simple changes, however -- I used two eggs instead of one, brown sugar instead of white, butter instead of vegetable oil, and I added a dash of vanilla. I also soaked the oats in buttermilk. I used a tbsp of vinegar mixed with enough milk to make it a cup, then I let it stand for 5 minutes before soaking in the oats. I haven't tried sprinkling sugar on top yet, to give it a bit of crunch, as some suggested. I will try that next time. Yum!

This is a great recipe! After reading that some people found these muffins to be too bland, I added 1/4 c of brown sugar, and a little cinnamon, ground cloves, and vanilla extract.  I also added a brown sugar glaze to the top, but the muffins turned out to be delicious even without it!

great basic muffin recipe! as others mentioned, i doubled the sugar, using 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of white. instead of milk, i used "buttermilk" (1 tbsp of lemon juice mixed with 2%milk, and allowed to sit for at least 5 minutes). i added about a 1/3 cup raisins and 1/3 cup chopped walnuts. still not super sweet, but very tasty out of the oven w/o butter or jam. my 3 year old loved it! will definitely be making this again, and will probably add more raisins or try other dried fruit like apricots or craisins.

Made these with dextrose instead of regular sugar for my son who has food intolerances. They are a good, basic muffin with a nice hearty texture. Great with a piece of cheddar, or with a fruit smoothie for a healthy, filling meal. Thanks!

Not too bad actually. I added some cinnamon for personal taste, along with some peanut butter, that could of been left out, and used mostly apple sauce in place of the oil for less fat. They are indeed Easy Oatmeal Muffins. Will probbaly use this recipe as a base next time I am doing oatmeal muffins.

These were really good.  I upped the sugar to 1/3 cup as we like sweeter muffins and added 1/2 cup blueberries to 1/2 the batter and 1/2 cup chocolate chips to the other half.  Also added a streusal topping.  Very good.

Loved these. NOT a recipe for those wanting a super sweet dessert. They are great for breakfast or afternoon tea. I added 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and used brown sugar instead of white. And barely dabbed them with butter on top when they came out of the oven. Thanks!

Made with the recipe as posted, these were flavorless. This makes a great base recipe, however. I added 1 tsp pure vanilla extract, 1/2 tsp cinnamon (I prefer just a hint of cinnamon; add more for stronger flavor), replaced sugar with dark agave syrup and omitted oil because agave syrup gives enough moisture. Next time I'll replace half the milk with applesauce or overripe, mashed bananas and see how that goes.

Lovely base.  Make healthier w/ applesauce instead of oil, whole wheat flour instead of white, brown sugar or molasses instead of white sugar.  I added 1/4 cup sunflower seeds and 1/2 cup dried berries.  Will definately try some of the other combos suggested in comments.

Great base recipe.  Like everyone else, I made modifications.  I added 2 1/2 tbsp of brown sugar, cinnamon, fresh nutmeg to the dry ingredients.  I added 1/4 tsp of vanilla to the wet mixture.  I also added raisins to the final mixture.  Turned out great!

These were great!  I made these with my 7 year old daughter who is wanting to learn how to cook and they lived up to their "easy" name.  We upped the sugar to 1/2 cup. We also added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips, a dash of nutmeg and some crushed wal-nuts.  We also used half whole wheat flour and substituted (cinnamon) applesauce for the oil.  Can't wait to try this with some berries! UPDATE:  We still love this recipe!  It is so super fast and flexible, we have used every combination of fruits, nuts, and goodies you can imagine and they're always delicious.

Great starter recipe for me. I add bananas and choc. chips. I usually leave out the oil and it doesn't really need a substitute. I find that where I live (Carribean) the recepy needs an extra 1/2 tsp baking powder. I also poured the batter in a 8x8 inch pan and left it in the oven 5 extra minutes and it made a great cake! Thanks a billion for this recipe!!

MAKE IT CANADIAN!
This is a nice basic & healthy muffin but it is even better with a few little tweeks. I uped the HEALTHY factor by using only whole wheat flour & adding a 1/4 cup of ground flax seed & used olive/canola oil instead & added some dried cranberries and 1 tsp.of maple extract and replaced the white sugar with a 1/4 cup of Canadian maple syrup. Yum yum.

Great basic recipe. I've made them a couple times; the first time I followed the recipe except for substituting whole wheat flour for white, regular rolled oats for quick-cooking, and brown sugar for white. Great color and texture. Today I made them again, adding three very ripe, pureed bananas. Delicious! I cut down on the sugar, but I could have left it out entirely. This is definitely a flexible recipe - the best kind!

Delicious. A great base recipe for an easy breakfast. I used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour & 1/2 white. 1 cup of raisins and a little cinnamon.  Great, but the raisins made them a little too sweet for my taste - I'll use less sugar next time.

After reading through the other reviews, I made some changes.  I added one mashed banana, 1/4 cup brown sugar (in addition to the white sugar), 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla.  I lowered the temperature to 350.  I also used regular oats(because that's all I had) and just let them soak a few minutes longer.  These are tasty, but still could use a little pizazz (not sure what though).  My little boy loves these.  I'll probably make them again.

These came out light and fluffy. I used regular oatmeal and just let it soak a while longer.  I took the suggestions of others and added cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla extract, and  turned down the oven temp for baking.  I like these muffins because they're not too sweet, but next time I think I'll try adding shredded apple or carrots.  Overall a pretty good muffin.  Thanks!

I thought these were great for me because I am not a breakfast eater and these fit the bill.  I also replaced the oil with applesauce and added cinnamon, walnuts and raisins.

I made these muffins and they were delightful.  I added 1 teaspoon of cinammon to add a little more flavor and they were great.  I will certainly be making them again.

I was traveling to Toronto summer of 2001 and stop at Tim Horton's and tried a Oatmeal muffin. Unfortunately, the Tim Horton's in Michigan do not sell Oatmeal muffins. I was extremely please when I discovered this recipe. It was okay, but it was not as good as Tim Horton's version. I will keep looking.

I loved this!  I sweetened it up by adding butterscotch chips and a streusel topping.  Oatmeach Scotchies in muffin form.  Yum!  The chips melted a lot, I may freeze them ahead next time to make them firmer.

425 degrees is WAY too high. I followed the recipe to a T and my muffins started burning even before the 20 minute mark.  I would definitely only set my oven at 350 or at the MOST 375.

These muffins were great! I've made them twice this week! The first time I made them I was about a fourth cup of milk short, but I added a half and egg extra (I only had medium eggs verses the large I usually use), and I didn't have any veg. oil, so I used melted margarine instead. They still came out great. The second time I was a little short on the oil, and the only oil I had was a combo of soybean and olive oil. I couldn't use margarine this time to compensate because I was out of that! So, using medium eggs again, I added an extra whole egg this time. I had all else needed. They still came out great. Both times I added honey to the oat/milk mixture, and a rounded tsp. cinnamon to the flour mix. I also sprinkled light brown sugar on the tops before putting in the oven. I also baked on 375 degrees. The whole family loved them. VERY moist! Will probably be making again and again!

These are plain, but are a good basic recipe! I used half whole wheat, half white flour. I replaced the sugar with brown sugar (increased to 1/3 c.)  and also added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg. Next time I might add a mashed banana. Also note: the muffins took 15 minutes, not 25 to bake.

Just made these muffins, and they turned out perfect. I substituted the sugar for molasses and used non-fat milk instead of regular. The taste of molasses is quite strong and takes away the oatmeal taste, but I still enjoy it! I also added 3/4 cup of frozen berries. Next time I want to try substituting the oil for apple sauce. Overall, awesome recipe though. Simple, interchangeable and super moist and fluffy :)

My husband made too much oatmeal and I was looking for a way to use it up, so I tried this recipe. Instead of the milk and uncooked oats I added a cup of already made (leftover) oatmeal and followed the rest of the directions. I also added raisins and about a  tsp. of cinnamon. Because of my substitution I also added between 1/4 to 1/3 cup milk to make sure they wouldn't be dry. Before baking I sprinkled just a little brown sugar over the top of each. They turned out pretty moist and tasty. I will probably use again the next time I end up with extra oatmeal.

The oven temp is too high! Set at 400 degrees and bake 17 - 20 minutes.
Also, try adding a low sugar vanilla or strawberry yogurt for some extra kick.

I really appreciate base recipes like this. This recipe gives you the perfect starting point to get what you want out of a muffin. We chose to add berries and banana, use honey instead of sugar, and use applesauce instead of oil. They are perfect healthy breakfast muffins and we are excited to try lots of new variations!

Made these today for the first time.  Great!  I added some orange zest and orange flavored dried cranberries.  I love their texture; lots of body. I ate one warm, but they were so much better after they had cooled and sat a while, but that's probably just me.  Will definitely make them again and try other variations.

Great muffin!  This is the perfect base recipe to play with, or just leave as is.  I also found the cooking time to be too long and took them out of the oven at 15 minutes and they were perfect - nice and moist.  I also added cinnamon and vanilla as another reviewer did, and also used brown sugar and 1/2 whole wheat flour.  I decided to add mini chocolate chips to the second batch and they are YUMMY.  The plain ones will be great with coffee for breakfast, and the chocolate ones as an afternoon treat.  This one's a keeper for me!

5 stars with a few simple changes. 1 tsp each cinnamon and vanilla. I topped the batter in the cups with brown sugar, and when they came out of the oven, put butter on top. Delicious!!!!!

I think some people are confusing muffins with cupcakes.  This is a great basic recipe--moist, fluffy, with just enough sweetness!  I followed the recipe exactly and baked for 20 minutes and they turned out perfectly.  I also made a second batch using brown sugar and whole wheat pastry flour instead of white sugar and all-purpose flour, adding pecans and mashed bananas.    It's a great recipe for additions.

I made 1 batch as written and 1 with chopped dates, chopped toasted pecans, vanilla, and a pinch of cinnamon. Both were absolutely delicious! Thank you for posting this recipe Whatcity and I'm sorry some bad cooks are putting it down due to their own lack of skill.

I have been looking for a basic oatmeal muffin recipe for a while and have finally found it! These muffins aren't sweet, which is exactly what I was looking for. I modified this recipe slightly- using unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil and honey in place of the sugar. They turned out great! I also threw in some spices - cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg, and a diced pear. You could put anything in - fruit, nuts, etc to suit it to your tastes. Every weekend I make a batch of muffins for the freezer, to eat for breakfasts on the run all week - I'll be using this recipe from now on!

These muffins turned out pretty good, very moist and fluffy. They are fairly bland in taste though, so making additions that will sweeten them up some helps. I added blueberries to mine and they were really good. I also substituted applesauce for oil and used skim milk. I only baked them for 15 minutes. Any longer and they would have been WAY over done. Also, make sure you spray the cupcake papers with some non stick spray, otherwise the muffins stick.

This was a disappointment to me. It was easy enough to make, but the end result was not so good.  The muffins reminded more of tea biscuits than muffins.

Great basic recipe - finally a muffin that isn't a cake!!!  I didn't even use oil, subbed some unsweetened applesauce instead, and they came out moist and delicious.

A great base recipe. I made these using whole wheat flour, flax seed, cinnamon and applesauce. But didn't use an egg since I was out. They turned out yummy with some jam. This is def a keeper.

These are a terrific change from overly-sweet muffins. They're not "too" sweet, and that makes them a perfect foil for sweet spreads such as Cinnamon Honey Butter from this site, or your favorite jam or jelly.  I added a little wheat germ and flax seed, as well as a shake of cinnamon.

These muffins were pretty good, but they were not the most flavorful muffins I've eaten! I liked the texture from the oats, but I've had better oatmeal muffins. I made them just as written, and thought they could use a "boost" of some sort...maybe fruit? Anyways, this is a very easy and quick recipe to make when you are pressed for time, and the muffins are pretty tasty!

if you are a muffin purist, you will love these muffins!  i made these as written -- no subs or changes.  they turned out perfectly!  i like them plain with a cup of coffee or tea.  my kids love them with a little butter or jam, or honey. be sure not to overcook.

I just made these muffins in my NuWave Oven, with Apple Cinnamon Instant Oatmeal, in a miniature muffin tray. Done in 10 minutes they were done, I was a bit afraid since I had never made muffins or baked in the NuWave, but this recipe was so simple it worked out great. I plan on doing this again with all the left-over oatmeal packet flavors no one at home likes... (used for this recipe and these muffin were gone in a flash!!

This lives up to the "easy" in it's title. A very basic and tasty recipe. 

I added few handfuls of chocolate chips which was very tasty (then again I believe chocolate can make almost anything tastier) and I look forward to trying this again just by recipe, and by adding random ingrediants!

Love this recipe as a base.  I doubled the recipe, used honey instead of sugar, 1/2 banana, 2 apples, no oil, whole wheat flour instead of white flour and 1/2 cup coconut.  I also used 2 tsp baking powder (as regular recipe calls for), but added 1 tsp baking soda.  They rose perfectly, are perfectly moist and so delicious for breakfast of an afternoon snack.  YUM!

I made them with applesauce instead of the oil.  They stuck to my muffin papers I think due to the substitution.  They still tasted great with butter and jam.  Not to sweet, which was nice.

This made good mini muffins. I substituted applesauce for half the oil, and whole wheat flour for half the flour. For the mini muffins, I baked them for about 10-12 minutes...otherwise they would burn.

Sometimes the simple pleasures are best!  This is a wonderful "starter" muffin recipe or you can enjoy as is.  I fiddled with the ingredients (can't help myself) to skinny it down and these muffins were absolutely as wonderful as the full-fat version.  I really appreciate that these muffins aren't the cakey kind you can buy anywhere.  Thanks for an excellent recipe!

I used this recipe to stimulate my imagination and try different ingredients. I warmed the milk before adding the oats to it, I substituted the white sugar with golden honey, I also added a few things of my own. I used 1/4 cup of raw carob powder, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, and of course, because of the oats, 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I took the advice of others and reduced the cooking temp to 350. I also mixed wet and dry separately and ALWAYS ADD WET TO DRY!!

This recipe is pretty bland by itself but it is a good base for adding your favorites.  I followed others suggestion and substituted apple sauce for the oil along with adding apples, cinnamon and brown sugar.  It was moist and very tasty for a healthy morning muffin.

This recipe was so easy. I used brown sugar instead of white and used applesauce instead of oil. Also added apples, orange peel, almond extract, cinnamon, and chia seed. It had just the right amount of sweetness for me and is perfect with a cup of coffee.

We LOVE these muffins.  Rather than buy junk food snacks at the store, I've started making these to have for afternoon snacks.  They're cheaper and healthier than any of those other pre-made snacks at the store (fruit snacks, fruit & grain bars, etc)  I love how versatile this recipe is.  If the plain muffins are a little too bland for you, you could try adding a tiny bit of butter and little sprinkles of sugar in the raw (or just white sugar) to the tops of them, and it will totally change the flavor.

I've made these muffins three different times:

1) First time it was made exactly like the recipe for the first batch (ie. plain).  The second batch I replaced white sugar for brown, added some cinnamon, and added a powder sugar, water, and vanilla gaze to the top (after they baked).  Both batches were moist.

2) The second time I made a batch of plain and a batch of blueberry.  I added vanilla, and to the the blueberry muffins, before putting them into the oven, I sprayed a little spray butter and sprinkled a little sugar in the raw on the top of them.  For some reason they were a little dry though.

3) The third time (just now) I made blueberry again, the same way as I did the second time.  However, since they were so dry the second time I decided to add just a little more milk to the oatmeal (maybe 1 tablespoon).  That may have been just a wee bit too much milk, but they sure are moist and DELICIOUS.

This is a lovely muffin!  I was a little worried by comments about a bland muffin, but it's really a nice basic, muffin.  I followed the recipe as written (processing old fashioned oats to make quick oats); the muffins turned out light and lovely.  Although this is a basic muffin, the oats give it a rich flavor, and there is a bit of sweetness to it.  It tastes good as is, but lends itself to additions other reviewers have mentioned adding.  I made these to trial wheat as a new food for our toddler, and he will certainly prefer these to the dry, oat-only muffins he's had until now :)  I will definitely be making these again for my family.

I liked how simple and versatile it was. I used the prepackaged raspberry-cheesecake instant oatmeal, and almond milk. When it came out of the oven I made a slit in the muffins and put a little bit of strawberry preserves in it, then drizzled a little icing on top for presentation.

I am looking to try low-sugar snacks, but when I saw these muffins were simple to bake & low-sugar I had a huge smile! 

The recipe states 1/4 cup of sugar which I added; the reviews state the 'bland' taste was compensated by adding more sugar (brown sugar too!), so I added 1/4 cup of molasses. The molasses worked for a maple-flavored taste, it sweetened the muffins spice-less look!

Yum!

These are so quick and easy.  Did use old fashioned oats instead of quick.  Also added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon.  Will add raisins the next time.

These came out very moist but I must agree that the flavor is VERY BLAND. I made a 2nd batch since they're so quick to make and added cinnamon and raisins to enhance the flavor. Next time I will add brown sugar and vanilla. 

Overall a good basic recipe that you can make your own.

These are pretty good, kind of bland. Very easy to make though. If I make them again I think I would add some cinnamon for a little extra flavor.

This is a good base recipe, but as posted it is a little bland and dry. I substituted 1/2 c brown sugar for white. I also added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and (just to make  it more moist) 1/2 c applesauce. 12 muffins just took 20 min at 425 degrees.

I just tried this recipe, I don't know what I did wrong. The cup cakes were very dry and only yielded 6 cup cakes,  the cakes were very crumbly. This did not turn out to my liking.  I was very surprised because everyone gave it such a good rating.  I followed the recipe to the letter. Very unhappy.

I thought these were pretty good.  The texture is a bit weird, but not unappetizing.  I substituted applesauce for the oil, but still did a "once-around-the-mixing-bowl" with the olive oil just to be on the safe side.  I used all whole-wheat flour and threw in a few tablespoons of ground flaxseed.  I used light blue agave instead of sugar, and it gave it a really nice flavor.  On the agave bottle, it states that it's 25% sweeter than sugar and to use less, but I still used almost 1/4 cup.  I could stand for them to be a little sweeter, so next time I will probably go with a full 1/4 cup of agave and also throw in a little vanilla for added flavor.  I used some frozen blueberries that I picked last summer.  I will make these again, assuming my kids will eat them!

Easy and delicious! I threw in some crushed almonds, cinnamon, and vanilla to give more crunch, scent, and sweetness.  Next time I might experiment with brown sugar or honey, and will probably have to use soy milk (that is what I usually have on hand, although today I had skim) but the original recipe is definitely tasty without playing with it - it might even become a breakfast staple for me.

Exactly what I was looking for! Just a nice, plain, and easy muffin recipe with a very slightly dense, tender, and fluffy texture and slightly sweet. I used maple and brown sugar instant oatmeal since I had it on hand, and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. The instant oatmeal probably made them a little sweeter than the plain oatmeal would have, but they are perfect for my husband to grab as quick breakfast on his way out the door in the mornings. He is used to store bought muffins so expects them to be a bit on the sweet side. These are good warm out of the oven, but the texture is much better when completely cooled.

Wow- these were amazing!  I used honey instead of sugar, and reduced the milk but they were still a little too soft when fresh out of the oven.  I don't know if they will firm up some as they cool, because the kids didn't let them cool long enough to find out.

I added blueberries, cinnamon and nutmeg.

I will reduce the honey to 1/8th a cup instead of 1/6th- we found them a little too sweet.

Easy simple recipe.  If you are expecting a sweet commercial type of muffin you may not like this..

This is a nice, hearty muffin.  I used honey instead of sugar and it came out great.  Tastes amazing with a little honey or jam.  And I will use this as a base for future variations!

I've made this a number of times. I've made it as is, and with fruit and spices added like blueberries or apple with cinnamon. I use substitutions to make it healthier: liquid egg whites instead of the egg, and applesauce instead of the oil. It comes out fantastic every time. This is my go-to oatmeal muffin recipe. I love it!

Used old fashioned oats for quick cooking, unsweetened applesauce for all oil, 1/2 c each white and whole wheat flour, brown sugar for white.  Added: 1/4 c chopped walnuts, almost one whole medium sized apple (braeburn--all I had), 1 tsp cinnamon. Sprinkled brown sugar on tops. Baked for 17 min. Very tasty muffins.  Glad I sprinkled with sugar bc they're not overly sweet--but this is how they're intended to be.  Could have added more cinnamon, should have also added a lil nutmeg.  I'm excited to have a fast breakfast for the week!

These were just the recipe I have been searching for to satisfy my muffin craving, but stay in my healthy eating habits. I substituted the white flour with whole wheat flour and used maple syrup instant oatmeal, as it was all I had. I also used egg whites instead of the whole egg. They turned out wonderful. The recipe was easy and I will definitely make it again.

Love these muffins! I made them with apple sauce instead of oil and I did a quarter cup white sugar and a quarter cup brown sugar. They turned out great! I would have added some fruit or nuts if I had any, but even without they're perfect! Just what I was looking for. Such a simple and easy recipe and very tasty! Not overly sweet like a a lot of muffins, but a great healthy snack! Everyone loved them, including my 14-month-old. My mom even said they were muffins you could sell! Thanks for this recipe!

These muffins are great! I made three simple changes just for fun... I added a tsp of Vanilla Extract, I used light brown sugar in place of the white sugar and put colored sprinkles on the top to make them look more like a treat!! They turned out great and we ate them with raspberry jam!

I followed other reviewers suggestions and added cinnamon, vanilla extract and cooked for only 16 minutes. I substituted the oil for sour cream (only because I didn't have mayo or apple sauce).  I added 1 mashed apple and 2 mashed bananas. Delicious muffin result.

Made with applesauce.  Tasted bland and overdone but gave it 4 stars since I didn't follow the recipe.  I added some raisins and walnuts which added enough sweetness and texture but will need to add some fat in the future.  Maybe 2 tablespoon of butter and applesauce.  Maybe I should also add 1 banana for more flavor.  It's a good starting base but I will look for another recipe.  I  also want to use whole wheat flour and/or oat bran to make it even healthier.

I made these jam-filled walnut muffins with no white flour, white sugar, or oil. They were absolutely amazing, and clocked in under 100 calories a piece using sparkpeople's calculator.    I upped the recipe to 18 servings, and got 12 good sized muffins. I 1/3 filled my tins, added a generous tsp of strawberry Polaner All Fruit, then filled them another 1/3 of the way. Added chopped walnuts to the top, and they came out looking and tasting shop worthy. I held off on eating all 12 right in a row.    For the recipe I subbed:    Water for milk, with 2 Amaretto flavored coffee creamers added.    Whole wheat flour for AP flour.    Omitted all the oil and the extra half egg the 18 serving version called for, subbed 1/2 c unsweetened applesauce.    Added a tsp-ish of vanilla and about 1/3 c chopped walnuts.    Omitted the sugar, added about a T of lite pancake syrup.      Truly truly amazing! My boyfriend was very impressed, and I really want to serve these to more people now! Or maybe I'll eat them all myself. ;)

Even though I let them get a little browner than I like, they were still delicious.  I made them to go with some chili, because I was out of cornmeal.  I actually thought these went better with the chili. I will definitely make these again.  Thank you!

This was a great recipe that can easily be altered to make what ever muffin you feel like.  I added wild Blueberries and put a brown sugar and butter topping on top before cooking.  These were delicious! Mmmmm.  I also added banana and nut to a batch that turned out great also.   Thanks!

Other than food processing whole rolled oats and throwing in handful of raisins, did not change recipe. Came out great. Perfect for my family because we do not like overly sweet treats.

I made these muffins this past weekend for breakfast and they turned out great. Not too sweet and not too bland. I followed the recipe for the most part, and added chopped almonds, strawberry yogurt (instead of the oil) and a teaspoon of cinnamon. Next time, I'll add some fresh chopped strawberries and an additional teaspoon of cinnamon. Great recipe overall and quite filling.

Great Recipe for a good, filling, treat. We eat them for breakfast on the go. I added 1 cup of shredded carrot, 1/2 cup of raisins to the mix for that extra boost. I also used 1/2 white and 1/2 wheat flour. For a treat I will sometimes just add blueberries and that is really yummy. We triple the recipe most of the time and freeze them, then pop in the microwave as needed.

Wonderful recipe. I substituted sugar with 4 tbsp honey, I added 2 tablespoons bran and 1 teaspoon molasses to add a bit of color. I baked for 20 min and they came out perfect! It's a very flexible and easy recipe, and the way I made it made it possible to combine them with sweet or salty accesories (cheese and ham and/or jelly and preserves). Thanks for sharing it!!!

Excellent muffin.  I made only slight changes to the base recipe by adding a little more sugar (preference) and 1 tsp. vanilla extract.  This recipe is very versatile so I suggest making your own variations so you fall in love with it too!  I can't wait try chopped dried or fresh fruits, chocolate chips with or without nuts or to spread butter and preserves on the muffins as is!  Thanks for the posting!  Update: I baked at 375 for only 17 mins. which was perfect in my oven.  Very tender muffins.

Healthy and nutritious! I use this plain oatmeal muffin as a good standby for breakfast whenever I run out of bread for toast. An excellent base recipe to add to. I sometimes add chocolate chips and pecans to some of the muffins (making those more tasty but less healthy).

Deeelicious these were. I didn't have any milk, so I used a half cup water and half cup orange juice.  Next time I'll use apple sauce instead of oil, and honey instead of sugar.  I've had bad luck with muffins in the past, but these were a breeze.

I like these muffins. You can do a lot with this basic recipe and they are really hard to mess up! The taste is a little bland, true, but they are perfect for doctoring. Banana nut, cinnamon spice, raisins, apples...pretty much anything can go in these!

GREAT Recipe!!!! Everyone has loved them and have even had them go "missing"! I added some fresh cut apple and raisins with a touch of cinnamon to them! and minused the oil due to a medical diet I am on! But they were still super delicious! Thanks!!

The muffins turned out well, though a little bland for some people's liking. I added some cinnamon to half of my batter and much preferred the muffins with the cinnamon. It adds a little extra flavor.

These are definitely good! I added about 1/4 of an apple- chopped, and cinnamon. I also used brown sugar instead of white. They were great. I can't wait to try some blueberries or raisin/cinnamon. Thanks!

I used 1/2 c. white and 1/2 c. wheat flour.  I added dried cranberries and some honey.  I used 1/2 c. brown and white sugar.  I used rolled oats instead of quick cooking.  I grounded up half of the rolled oats; it gives the muffins a bit of a crunch.  I added chocolate chips and cranberries.  They turned out great.  very tasty!!!

I replaced milk with vanilla soy milk,and replaced the sugar with honey as suggested by another review.  As well, I added 2 overly ripe banana's mashed with about one teaspoon of cinnamon.

Well, these were definitely as the name suggests, easy!  I made the following changes:
Kept the amount of sugar, but used half white and half brown.  I also made my own applesauce (boiled down apples with a bit of water and added vanilla & cinnamon) and used it in equal amount to replace the oil completely.  I added coconut (didn't measure, maybe 1/4 cup) to the mixture. When I got it all mixed up, I  took half and added some milk chocolate chips. The other half had dried cranberries added to it and a few dashes of nutmeg.

Overall, I think it could use more sugar. I think they'd be rather bland without my addition of sweetened coconut and chocolate chips. They're pretty good for oatmeal though.

Also, I didn't find that mine made 12 decent sized muffins. I'm not sure why as with the fruit/chocolate/coconut additions I had more volume there...Anyways, I'd say it would make 6-8 large muffins. I made 12, but they barely puffed up.

These were really good. I added some cinnamon and half a cup of raisins. I love the fact that they aren't overly sweet. Mine were done in 15 minutes though. Excellent muffin. I've been eating them all week for breakfast now. A new favorite.

This really is an easy, healthy muffin recipe.  I used whole wheat flour instead of regular, brown sugar instead of white.  I added cinnamon, and I experimented with different extract flavors to give it a different taste.  An days when I want muffins, and am short on time, I'll use this recipe!

I liked the recipe and te consistency of the muffins.  I think like other said it is a great starter muffin, would be good with nuts, bananas, raisons, ect.  I did sub the oil for applesauce- turned out fine.  Also cooked about 19 minutes in a stone muffin pan.  I think they would be perfect with some good jam, just didnt have any...kids ate them which is what I was going for.. thanks!

Sorry, not very impressed. It was ok. The muffin lacked flavor, even though I added some vanilla extract and 2 bananas. I wouldn't call having to sift dry ingredients and waiting 15 minutes for the oatmeal to sit steps in an "easy" muffin mix. If it were a "healthy" recipe it would be different. Thank you.

Great recipe.  I added cinnamon, vanilla, and raisins for extra flavor.  They're easy to eat on the go in the morning.  I also made a batch of mini-muffins (baked about 8 minutes) to put in my daughter's lunch.  She loves them.

As suggested by others, I substituted half whole weat flour.  I also added a half cup of wheat bran and used brown sugar instead of white.  Mine cooked in only 15 minutes, but that could be my oven.  THey are delicious with tea and honey!

I gave 3 out of 5 for now. They are good starter, but definitely need cinnamon, apple raisons. Something else.  With some additions I bet they'd be great.

A perfect base to delicious muffins. I added 2tbs of ground flax, one apple and 2 tsp of cinnamon. I also used 2 egg whites instead of a whole egg.

Excellent recipe!  I agree with other reviewers that this is a more authentic muffin recipe instead of the "cake for breakfast" kind that is more common.  These muffins are delicious on their own or provide a great base for adding other flavours and ingredients.

Yum! I followed many other's advice for putting in brown sugar and cinnamon, lowering the temp and cook times and they were delightful. I used rice milk for my lactose intolerant and you couldn't tell it wasn't regular milk. Also, I accidentally put in 1/2 c sugar (instead of 1/4) so I only put in 2 T of brown sugar and it was still good. Oh - and I did sprinkle cinnamon sugar on the tops - that was good too! I think this is one of those recipes that you can't really go wrong with and that's just the recipe for me! Thanks Tony!

I added cinnamon to the batter and the result was a very nice, moist oatmeal muffin. Nothing exciting, fruity or overly sweet, just a simple, warm breakfast treat that is fairly healthy.

Sorry, I thought that these were very tasteless, unless you added in the choc. chips.  I made two separate batches, based on other reviews, one with the chips and one with apple and cinnamon.  I added about 3 tsp of cinnamon and a finely chpd apple and I couldn't taste it.  They were heavy and didn't make very much.  I was able to make 6 mini's and 3 jumbo of each.  I won't try this one again.

This is a wonderful basic recipe with ingredients you always have on hand. I like that I can add whatever I have to make really fast muffins. (today I added an additional 1/4 c. brown sugar, 1 t. cinnamon and a chopped apple) The only problem is the timing should be more like 15-20 minutes not 20-25 or you will have very dark muffins!

This recipe is going to be very versatile.  The first batch I made I followed the directions and then added 2 tsp. of cinnamon and 1 cup of brown sugar.   I then set my kitchen timer for 20 minutes.  I almost burned all of them, thankfully, I caught them in time.  Only two burned. Even though I added the cinn. and the brown sugar,  they were pretty bland for my taste. 
Next time I plan on reducing the oven heat to 350 and baking them for about 15-18 minutes.  I will also omit the oil in exchange for applesauce. This will reduce the fat content and make them even more moist.  I am thinking about adding some vanilla next time too.  More cinn. and brown sugar, dry cranberries and pecans or walnuts  would really boost the taste too.  
I think the recipe is a good base to start with,  but you may want to add things that cater to your taste before making your first batch. 
I haven't given up on this recipe,  but I will definatly make adjustments to enhance the flavor.

Really oaty and delicious!  I added a couple of teaspoons of packed brown sugar because I'm a firm believer that whenever oats are present, brown sugar cannot be far behind.  But aside from that, I didn't change a thing.  I will definitely put this in my rotating muffin roster!

Good texture, though definitely needs spices.  I used whole wheat flour, and added cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla.  My daughter liked them that way.

These were wonderful!  I increased the amount of sugar to a half cup, and also added some cinnamon to my liking.  The muffins will be a welcome change to cereal in the morning.

Pretty good!  I gave this recipe four stars only because it lends itself so readily to additional ingredients, but it's easy to make with things on hand and no special trips to the market.  By itself, it's great for butter and jam, but with the addition of vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg and a little extra sugar, they're REALLY fabulous and can be eaten alone.  Take the advice of the bazillion people who have added these things to the recipe, then taste it before it goes into the oven to make sure the spices are to your liking.

Great recipe. The muffins were really yummy. I added a little extra sugar, some cinnamon, and some cranberries and they were good. Definitely one for the recipe box. :)

Not bad for an easy muffin! Actually, these are really good. I made mini muffins, and they puffed up well. I can taste the oatmeal, which is nice. Next time, though, I'll add a touch of cinnamon and nutmeg.

This recipe is easy and tastes great.  The only change I made was to increase sugar to 1/3 cup to make them a bit sweeter.  I also add applesauce in place of the oil to make them non-fat.

I have too much of a sweet tooth for these.  I added cinnamon, nutmeg and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on the top but didn't have positive results for me.  They seemed like they were missing something.  If you get tired of things being too sweet, they may be perfect for you.

As simple as they sound, these are quite nice with margarine or jam.  The key is they take NO time to make (all be it dirtying three bowls in the process).  I over-soaked the oats, and it turned out fine.  Perfect for what they are - however, plain oats isn't 5 stars imho.

These muffins were really good. I added about a cup of raisins (you can add less if you don't really like raisins like I do)and a few drops of vanilla and they were delicious! I reccomend them because they are so easy!

A very good basic muffin recipe. I’m looking forward to trying some variations with fruit, nuts and spices! I made this dairy free by substituting water and a tsp of vegan margarine for the milk.

I've been wanting something sweet, but not like a cupcake or cookie. What better than a muffin recipe? I'm very picky when it comes to my muffins. I like a hardy and semi-healthy breakfast item that gives me energy to go in the morning. I already thoroughly enjoy oatmeal cookies, so I thought that this would be a good alternative. I looked at the comments and followed other people's changes in the recipes. Instead of oil i used applesauce, and instead of white sugar, I used brown sugar; 2/3 to be exact. I've got a but of a sweet tooth, and i saw that this recipe could be a little bland if you don't add any fruits or other flavorings. Along with those changes, I added a couple dashes of cinnamon,  a generous pinch of nutmeg, and I wanted to add vanilla, but I forgot at the end. It's a small batch; I had just enough for 6 large muffins. It's such an easy recipe that I could whip it up again any time. I added raisins to 2 of them, finely chopped apples mixed with brown sugar to the next 2, and left the last 2 plain. I'd cook it for less than I did because they were a little tough, but that could also be because I over mixed it. Be very careful with that. After they were done, I dusted powdered sugar over them for a pretty finishing touch. The apple muffins were fantastic, and so were the raisin. The plain ones were no match to the others. The recipe is not bad if you touch it up yourself and add a little bit of your magic to it. Would recommend.

Great basic recipe, but I think it would be boring without adding something. I added Craisins, pecans, cinnamon,  & nutmeg. I also think berries, apples, or bananas would be good. I also used 1/3 cup sugar instead of 1/4, & they were just the right sweetness.

I made them Gluten Free for my child with Celiac. I used 1/8 cup of coconut oil instead of 1/4 veg oil, 2 eggs instead of one, rolled oats not quick oats, 1/2 tsp of Cinnamon and 1/8 cup of honey instead of sugar and Pamelas  all purpose GF flour blend (blue bag). Good solid muffin my son likes to eat with homemade black jam because "if you give a moose a muffin..."

Made these with my 10 year old daughter. We were lazy and threw all the ingredients into one bowl, giving it a little stir. We didn't let the oats soak either.  We also added cinnamon, vanilla extract, and chocolate chips. Loved them. The texture was perfect, despite not following the recipe exactly. We will make these again.

Excellent! Worth ten stars if you make additions and a couple substitutions.  I now make these all the time.  I use whole wheat flour and rolled oats but otherwise make the batter as written (except that I use 1/4 cup honey or maple syrup, so they are probably a tad sweeter). 

The muffins themselves have a very mild flavor.  I always end up adding something just for fun. I love cocoa powder and frozen mixed berries, or banana chunks and mini chocolate chips. For a great twist, try frozen cranberries  and mandarin oranges (with orange juice instead of milk).  I always add chopped nuts and sometimes cinnamon and/or an extract.

I baked at 350F. I mixed all the dry ingredients together, added a mix of the wet ones, and baked without letting it sit.I added 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/4 tsp cloves, 1/4 tsp allspice and 1/2 tsp vanilla. It worked out great!

Added mini chocolate chips, substituted coconut oil, brown sugar (and used less), whole wheat flour, added vanilla and cinnamon per others recommendation and its a nice, simple and relatively healthy muffin recipe that our whole family appreciates. Good for breakfast or afternoon snacks.

Easy oatmeal muffin, as promised! These are wonderful when made using this recipe. I made no change to the ingredients-- only thing I did differently was after taking them out of the muffin tins, I smeared on just a little butter, them put them super close to my countertop oven on the BROIL setting.  Watch carefully, and just give these little beauties some crispy brown on the top.  I have some homemade jam and these were perfect. Toasty, hint of crispness from the browning, and allowed my jam to shine. (Whoa! I forgot! -- I used melted butter and not vegetable/canola oil -- that stuff is just horrid -- use butter or maybe light olive oil, or melted coconut oil)

Such an easy and resilient baking recipe! I've made tons of substitutions and it turns out great anyway, and from the comments on the page, other people had the same experience. I added a cup of grated carrots, a tablespoon of grated fresh ginger, a teaspoon of cinnamon, and a 1/4 cup of raisins. Also bumped up the sugar a tad and replaced the vegetable oil with butter, and it turned out great even with all of those changes!

I feel badly to rate this so low. I followed the recipe exactly as listed.  I checked them several minutes before the time was up. They were done, so I took them out to cool and poured them onto a cooling rack. They unfortunately were dry and also a bit hard. My oven is accurate, so I am wondering if the cooking time needed to be even less.

Love this as a base for other muffins, but only needed 20 minutes at 400 degrees.  And, I did one and a half times the recipe requirements to make bigger muffins!
Substitute canned coconut milk, substitute brown sugar, and used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. 
Then I do one of two things:
Add 2 tsp vanilla, 1c fresh blue berries.  Yum!
Or...
2 tsp cinnamon, 2 ripe bananas mashed up, 1/2c crushed walnuts,  1/2c chocolate chips.  
For the second I needed to add a splash of milk to thin out the batter a little.
Finding myself making some variation of these every week!

I love this recipe. It's so easy and you can switch it up and it always results in delicious muffins. I have used stevia Instead of sugar, added 2 bananas and a cup of blueberries. A muffin only had 140 cal which is a great healthy snack. Thank you for the great recipe.

I did not make any changes except for baking them 15-17 minutes. By that time, they were already browned on top. If I had let them bake longer, they would have burned. I really enjoyed this recipe "as is." I didn't add anything to, or take anything from, the original recipe. I read others' reviews mentioning that they weren't as sweet as expected, but I don't like muffins that taste incredibly sweet or almost like a cupcake. If I make these again, I would probably add some boiled raisins, cinnamon, and a bit of vanilla extract. This recipe was super simple, and the resulting muffins were gone quickly.

I made a lot of substitutions, sorry! But the proportions are all the same. These were my attempt to get my picky eaters to try something new that is a little healthy.
So I:
Subbed coconut milk for the cow milk.
Subbed half coconut oil, half unsweetened apple sauce for the veg oil.
Subbed approx 2 tbs of cocoa powder for some of the flour.
Mixed about a tsp of molasses into the sugar, and used maybe a tsp less sugar overall.
Added approx 1/2 tsp vanilla.

These I baked in a mini muffin tin for about 10 minutes. My kids both loved the result: a mildly sweet, mildly chocolate muffin. Will definitely make again. Thanks!

Super easy with few steps, though it does makes a lot of dirty dishes. I added cinnamon to one batch and blueberries to another. I meant to add cinnamon sugar on top for both batches but forgot. Both were fantastic. These are a perfect muffin! I can't wait to have these with hard boiled eggs for this week's breakfast. I can't wait to try a peanut butter, banana, chocolate chip version. I never get a dozen though, only 8 small ones, which is fine since it's just me.

This recipe is good. But it needs to be doubled to get muffins that are a decent size. The first time I made this, the muffins were really small. Also, I ended up adding vanilla extract to give them a bit more flavor. Almond extract works well. Or adding in a teaspoon of cinnamon is also another way to add some flavor. If you want a less coarse muffin texture, heating up the milk before adding it to the oats helps. The oats seem to soak up the milk better. Then let it sit for the 15 minutes as directed.

I have made this several times and it is agreat base recipe that handles substitutions well!  Made as is - it's a great base muffin to add jam with. 

I do several variations - banana chocolate ship, fresh fruit, peanut butter etc.

These are an simple, plain, but rich tasting muffin.  They are great with jam, which normally accompanies muffins (along with grated cheese).
I added 1/2 tsp. vanilla, but could have gone to 1 tsp.  I also substituted melted butter for the oil.  I try to avoid refined oils, plus butter gave them a richer flavor. Those who commented on their bland taste, may want to try using butter.

We make these all the time but like most people I change it up. I double the recipe and make them large or mini. I like to use almond milk.   I use half almond flour half white. I use brown sugar instead of white. Coconut oil instead of vegetable.  I also add cinnamon and vanilla. My husband loves them. We don't like overly sweet so these are perfect.

This recipe is very close to a lovely oatmeal muffin my sister used to make when we were growing up, so I am really pleased to find it! I used soy milk instead of dairy and added a little vanilla and orange essence to create more flavour.  Overall I am happy with this recipe and like to eat these muffins with  honey

I appreciate this recipe because it's so easy to change it up to suit your preference. It's not a sweet dessert style muffin, but they are nutritious and filling. I added a bunch of cinnamon and walnuts. My muffins were done in 15 minutes.

Hi all!
I made these muffins for breakfast and they were a knockout for the family's taste! I loved how the oats expanded in the muffin giving it a more fluffy taste and I would suggest to add some vanilla and put some extra oats on top. Farm girl style muffins and perfect texture. I hope this review was helpful. Happy Baking!

Bland the way written. Changed it up a little the second time. Used buttermilk and 1/2 cup applesauce in the oats. Also added cinnamon and used brown sugar instead of white. Put this in a 8x9 pan instead of muffins and topped with with 1/2 cup granola before baking.

I loved this recipe and will definitely bake them again! I just substituted white sugar for brown sugar to make it healthier plus I figured it would be a better combination with the oatmeal. I topped them with a little bit more oats and brown sugar right before baking and it helped form a great crust. A lot of the other reviews say they are too bland but if you use brown sugar that is certainly not the case! I made these for my friend and I and we both loved them. Please try!

I made these muffins today and they were amazing. To make the recipe healthier I substituted the milk for water and I didn't put in the egg. To add flavour I added one teaspoon of vanilla and a half a teaspoon of cinnamon. :)

Not at all what I would call a muffin. Almost like a biscuit. Not my cup of tea at all. And I put cinnamon and vanilla. I will try another recipe next time.

I followed the recipe ingredients to the letter.  I baked them for 17 minutes instead of the 20 minute recommendation and used muffin liners.  The bottom of the muffin stuck to the liner and I found it a little overcooked.  Would turn down heat or cook less next time.  We sprinkled cinnamon sugar on the top and it really jazzed them up.

I have made these muffins many times and my kids LOVE them.  They are a very dense muffin, not a cakey muffin that many kids are used to.  They are filling and keep my kids going all morning long!  We do substitute vanilla coconut milk for the milk and applesauce for the oil.  We sometimes add chocolate chips or blueberries.  My kids swim competitively and these muffins are a must on swim meet mornings.

Well I made these for the first time but I made them gluten free. I used rice flour, potato starch, tapioca starch, x-gum in place of the regular flour. I also used coconut milk instead of regular milk. I use vanilla and brown sugar plus blueberries. They where awesome! My family loved them. This is a keeper!

They are very tasty and healthy but I would increase the amount of sugar next time to about 1/2 a cup since they were not sweet enough and I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon.

Great easy recipe. I added golden raisins, otherwise followed recipe exactly. It is simple, I wouldn't say bland like others stated. My opinion its a good muffin, if I wanted a sweet cupcake I would have made those.

These were so fast! I make muffins all the time but these were faster. I did them exactly as the recipe said. 425 but mine were done in 15 minutes. I didn't have quick oats so I made my own by blending up old fashioned oats.  These were exactly what I wanted! Thanks!

I added molasses and vanilla and cinnamon as I thought it was very bland and the oven temp was too high and was burning my muffins so I just lowered the temp

So easy and delicious! I wanted a simple oatmeal muffin that I could grab and go out the door, and this is absolutely perfect. Just slightly sweet, so moist, and the ingredients are all on hand. I made it exactly as stated the first time, but I will definitely experiment with throwing in raisins, chocolate chips, or chopped fruit in the future. I actually like how bland it is since I don't have an appetite normally in the morning. Be sure not to overmix! Never beat the batter, just gently stir with a spoon or fork.

Easy, flexible muffin recipe.  I added a chopped fresh apple, some cinnamon, and a dash of nutmeg.  I made mini muffins and got 18 with this recipe.  Will definitely keep this recipe and try it again a few other ways.

Wonderful recipe! I added lots of cinnamon and vanilla. I think I'll throw in some raisins next time. These are so versatile, you can spice them up however you like! Plus, my toddler loves them.

I just finished making this recipe and am amazed by the results! I followed the recipe exactly except for adding an extra egg. I made chococate chunk ones, apricot, almond, apricot almond and chocolate almond and they each came out delicious, even mom loved them lol! I also made extra batter and made a small loaf (chocolate almond) and came out perfect. The title says it all- EASY oatmeal muffins and come out delicious! Perfect for beginners.

It came out great, except that the recipe was supposed to yield 12 and I could only get out 11 muffins! I added a handful of raisons and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.

I LOVE these, so do the kids! Much better, and healthier than store bought! Used Vanilla Almond Milk instead of reg milk, EVOL instead of vegetable oil, & brown sugar instead of white (just my personal preference's). Made a double batch then split. 1 got mini choc chips and the other got diced apples & spices. Ooooo so good!!!! Will be making these often! Thank you for a great simple recipe =]

425 for 20 min made the bottoms burn. i used a mini muffin pan, so the smaller muffin amounts may have made a difference. next time i will try it at a different temp and even in a bigger muffin bin.  now for the muffin itself: at this time i dont want to rate it, for i feel it would not be fair to the recipe,becuase i was expecting it to be something different than what it is. i think i might appreciate it more if i make them in a diff muffin pan and also knowing ahead the kind of muffin.  well, it wont let me post the comment with out rating it, so ... 3 stars.  but i will be back after trying it again.

This is a wonderfully simple muffin!  I added 1 tsp vanilla extract and topped with cinnamon and sugar.  I wanted something quick and not too sweet, and this was perfect.  I halved the recipe to make 6, and mine baked in only 18 minutes.

Great basic oatmeal muffin recipe, but I was looking for a healthier sweet snack for my toddler, so I doubled the recipe, used brown sugar instead of white & increased brown sugar to 2/3 cup. I added 2 tsp of cinnamon and 3 tsp of vanilla. I also added 1 cup each of chocolate chips and dried cranberries. The doubled recipe made 12 regular-sized muffins and 24 mini muffins. Do not overcook! It only took 15 min for regular muffins and 11 min for mini mufins to bake. The result is beautiful, golden brown, peaked muffins that are not too sweet but have a nice punch of sweetness from the chocolate chips and tartness from the cranberries. Excellent! This will become my standard oatmeal muffin recipe.

I'm giving this four stars because the recipe, as it reads, is very basic and produces a nice, plain breakfast muffin. That said, after mastering the basic recipe, the sky is the limit with these babies. I now make these all the time for my husband, who has decided he ONLY wants to eat these muffins for breakfast. I add dried fruit, mashed bananas, nuts, peanut butter, chia seeds... whatever I have on hand. I substitute apple sauce for oil, raw sugar for white refined... sometimes I use brown sugar... you get the gist. This is very forgiving recipe, and can be whipped up in no time.

Great base recipe, with some tweaks. I followed the low fat version from one reviewer and used apple sauce instead of oil. I only had old fashioned oats, not quick cooking, and it turned out great. I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon, and used a combination of honey and pure maple syrup instead of the white sugar. I added about 3/4 cup of raisins. We can't use milk bc of a milk protein allergy, so I used unsweetened coconut milk instead. In the end, they were wonderful, not too sweet, but very flavorful. I'll definitely use this again. Maybe w dried cherries and orange zest, next time!

I only rated this 4 stars because I'm not the biggest oatmeal fan but am trying to lose weight. It's pretty good for being healthy. I added applesauce like another reviewer said. I made them with bananas last week and this week, I'm trying apples and walnuts. I added vanilla extract this time.

I love these muffins. Five stars for the recipe the way it is written!! I have also played with it - tried using spelt flour, added diced apple, raisins, or snippets of figs. I always use Splenda, as I can't tolerate sugar, and it turns out just fine! I also use applesauce in place of the oil. Okay, off to make another batch!

I honestly don't know why I keep coming back to this website, the majority of the recipes I have tried from here rarely turn out for me. This muffin recipe is the last straw, never again will I try anything from this website....these muffins were horrible!  I  would give zero stars if I could

Not a bad base -- not too sweet, but a bit dry and bland. I added 1/3 c raisins, 1/3 c walnuts, 1/2 tsp cinnamon,  1/4 tsp nutmeg. 425 for 17 minutes, and it might have been best to go a minute or so less.

I made this recipe for a last minute breakfast.  I hadn't been grocery shopping so it was perfect because they were all staple ingredients that I had on hand.  I added a handful of chocolate chips to make them a little more "kid friendly".  If it weren't for the chocolate chips...they wouldn't have gotten eaten.  And only 3 out of the 6 kids would eat them.  I tried one and didn't care for them at all.  Had a bit of an aftertaste too.

I baked these using olive oil and added 1/8 tsp of cinnamon and vanilla.  They tasted like a basic muffin, not too sweet.  Perfect if you plan on eating with jam or butter.  I will keep looking for that perfect eat plain oatmeal muffin, though.

This recipe is so simple, and very delicious. Yes they are a little bland, but you can do so many things with this recipe. I follow the recipe, and add 1 tsp. of cinnamon, and they are delicious! Very satisfying in the morning with your coffee, and you don't have to feel too guilty. My 4yr old LOVES these, and I feel they are healthy enough for her to have one every morning. Good way to get oatmeal in her!

I must have done something wrong, although I followed the recipe carefully. The result wasn't bad, but it was a cross between a muffin and a soft oatmeal cookie. I took the muffin tins out of the oven at 15 minutes, if I'd waited any longer they would have been overcooked.

These muffins were pretty good.  They are definitely a bit plain and not super sweet, but that was what I was looking for!  They are very moist and fairly healthy, and have a good texture.  I ended up adding some flax seed meal to the batter, and they were great!  I ate them warm from the oven with some butter and honey on top.  Delicious!

This is such an amazing recipe for simple breakfast muffins!  I use it all the time now for either  simple oatmeal muffins or the base for blueberry or cranberry muffins.

anyone who wants to make these muffins should definitely use coconut oil instead of vegetable oil it makes a HUGE difference, i made a couple muffins with vegetable oil and some with  coconut oil and the ones with veg oil tasted sooo bland and really gross but the ones with the coconut oil tasted like totally different muffins, they where so yummy and coconut oil makes you lose weigh very well and it is much healthier than vegetable oil. i rate 4 stars because it is a good recipe....well.... only with coconut oil

wonderfully easy! i have four kids, one very picky eater and i can use this recipe to hide all kids of healthy things. apples are a favorite! i just throw on in the food processor (cored) and add it to the oatmeal mixture before adding the flour. great texture.

My son loves muffins but refused to eat a healthy breakfast so I am always trying to find healthy alternatives to some of the ingredients. I tripled the recipe and substituted 1 cup of flour for soy flour and replaced the oil with unsweetened applesauce and left the remaining ingredients the same. They are definitely not the "muffin" you would get at Tim Hortons, I find them very bland and a bit on the chewy side. My son won't eat them.

Even with adding spices to the mixture to give this more flavor, the texture was dry. The baking time needs to be reduced or maybe the temperature. My oven is spot-on and usually bakes things perfectly. By following the suggested cooking time on these, they were over-baked, not quite burned, but very dark brown. I won't make them again.

Mmmm! Baked these muffins last night, they're really delicious, nice and dense but still moist and fluffy on the inside.  Added 1 tsp. of raspberry extract and some chocolate chips, and can honestly say I jumped out of bed this morning to eat one for breakfast. Mmm!  Will probably try these with whole wheat flour next time.

Excellent oatmeal muffins!  The recipe is great alone or with additions such as raisins, dried cranberries, or dried blueberries!  I use olive oil.  Very easy to make and taste great!

I love the simplicity of this recipe. It is a great base to be creative with flavors and additions. I kept everything as is except for adding blueberries and vanilla. The taste and texture are perfect. I'll probably always add additions, but I'm sure they'd be good plain with jam or butter. It's good to know the recipe works with applesauce instead of oil to make them even healthier!

So I took a different twist over the above readers and made it less healthy by using butter instead of oil and I was out of eggs so I used apple cider vinegar. I also splashed in a little vanilla and topped it with crushed walnuts and honey with extra honey for serving – the result was addicting to say the least!

Nice, moist, hearty muffins! I used self rising flour: omitted the salt and baking powder, added 1 Tbl. honey, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp. vanilla and some raisins. DELICIOUS! They were done after 20 minutes, perfect! My family loved them! Thanks for such an easy, failproof recipe!

I'm loving this recipe. I only didn't give it 5 stars because it's not "to die for" but it is a great basic muffin recipe. I changed the white sugar to brown sugar and I always add cinnamon, sometimes I add shredded apple. I just read a review about using Honey instead of sugar and I will be trying that too. Thanks so much for this recipe!

WOW!! Perfect texture, rose beautifully, satisfying and reasonably healthy! Heeding advice from earlier reviews I did add a mashed banana and lots of cinammon to give them a flavour. Went down a treat with my Mom who microwaves one at work for a mid-morning treat with tea. I think next time I'll make them with lots of instant coffee. Thank you Tony!

Very good.  I also made some additions. Substituted whole wheat pastry flour, brown sugar, regular cooking oats and skim milk.  Added 1/2 cup of dried cranberries.  Also sprinkled about 1 tablespoon of demerara sugar over the entire batch.  Very tasty and nice crumb.

i added a little extra sugar and a tiny bit of honey for flavor and they were exceptional. As a vegan i also used soy milk instead of regular milk... and 4 tablespoons potato flour rather than eggs. they turned out beautifully. nice rounded tops and soft true muffin texture.

wonderful!

I love this muffins! The ingredients are simple and easily on hand. Not too sweet! When I added dried cranberries in it, there's a punch of sweetness. I also added traces of cinnamon powder and instant coffee in it. They taste very good!

This is a very good BASE recipe.  As is it is bland.. IMO.  I added some maple syrup and a little bit more sugar and also some vanilla.  I would have added some cinnamon but dont have any.  I think with some carrot or apple this would be fantastic.  The muffins came out moist on the inside but nice and crisp on the outside.  very easy to make.. thanks for sharing.

A good base recipe.  I substituted brown sugar for white, applesauce for oil.  Also added a little maple syrup and almond extract, and tossed in some dark chocolate chips in half the batch.  Good stuff!

My 3 1/2 year old nephew asked me upon taking his first bite of the muffin, "What did you put in these muffins to make them so delicious?"  Very good with 1 tsp of cinnamon.

Great basic recipe! I make it even more tasty by adding in blueberries to the mix (a cup or two) and last night I added some dark chocolate chips just for fun - DELICIOUS! :)

I like these muffins made as the recipe is written, and I also like them when I make them healthier by using whole wheat four and substituting applesauce for oil.

Good recipe. I made them low fat by replacing the milk with water and using just the whites of the egg, rather than the whole egg. I also added fresh blueberries for a little flavor, since I took most of the fat out.

These muffins are okay, a pretty basic recipe but are very BLAND!  These would be very good with butter and honey on them though.  I used brown sugar and made them with vanilla soy milk (I didn't have regular milk).  I also added vanilla and cinnamon.  I will try them again and maybe add more sugar and maybe some berries or something.

I always hesitate to rate a recipe that I've changed quite a bit but here goes...I think it's a solid recipe from which to start.  I took other reviewers' advice and doubled the sugar and added vanilla and cinnamon which gave these muffins a lovely yet still subtle flavor.  I'll definitely make them again but not will not follow the original recipe as it must be pretty bland when the changes I made still kept the flavor subtle.

Not bad! I took other reviewers advice and added cinnamon and vanilla to kick up the flavor. I think I will add applesauce next time instead of oil but had none on hand. I will make this again.

My two middle children like these but eldest ds and dh both ended up tossing theirs.  I did add cinnamon to the batter and sprinkled some cinnamon sugar on top before baking.  Not a bad recipe but we probably won't be making it again.

First time I made this recipe. Not bad. A nice basic flavour that allows for personal modifications; however, the muffin stuck to the paper and I found they had a slightly bizaare texture. I will likely try another recipe before I return to this one.

These sounded reasonably healthy so I decided to give them a try.  I used applesauce in place of the oil.  I also added some vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and raisins.  The taste was fine with all those additions.  The texture was so weird and I used paper baking cups that were almost impossible to remove - I don't know why that happened.  This recipe wasn't a dumper but I definitely don't want these again.

These are so good !! We love them!! I did add about 1 teas of cinnamon to the mixture, and used brown sugar instead of white sugar. Instead of 1 whole cup of white flour, I added 1/2 cup of white flour and 1/2 cup of wheat flour.  This recipe is great tasting, and it truly is the best recipe that I found for oatmeal muffins. Thanks so much for it !!

This is a very easy, fast & healthy muffin recipe.  It made 12 small to med. size muffins.  I added vanilla, raisins, cinnamon, dried apples, & dried cranberries. I substituted 1/3 c. of whole wheat flour for the all purpose; substituted 1/2 the sugar w/ brown; substituted 1/2 the oil with applesauce.  Great breakfast on the run for the whole family.

We have fallen in love with this recipe- so simple to make and it freezes wonderfully- we make a triple batch and pull out a ziploc bag of 4 for each morning (that's 1 per person, not 4 per person, hehe!).  They're delicious and not too sweet!  I add cinnamon and dust the tops with cinnamon and sugar before baking.

These were pretty good, once you  spread some butter on em.  LOL.  I used buttermilk and added ground flax seed, some honey, and cinnamon.  Next time I'll add some vanilla.  Overall, not bad.

Not bad! I fixed these for my husband to take on his commute to work. Although I added 1/4 cup of brown sugar, and a cup of raisins. Mine didn't need 20 minutes to cook, and I think I would lower the oven temp. But only because my oven cooks hotter. Pretty tasty though! I would say add some fruit to them, just to jazz them up, otherwise they are kind of plain.

so good! I didn't change much because I wanted  a simple, sweet (but somewhat nutrient!) muffin to go with my stew. I ground the oats for a smoother texture, added ground flax seed, and cinnamon.  Easy, fast, and VERY yummy...doesn't need anything else!

Despite the fact I made a "cake" shaped giant muffin, it turned out good.  I used brown sugar instead of white, along with some cinnamon and ginger.  I think next time I'll add some walnuts or apples to make it perfect.

This muffin was definitely quick and easy.  The muffins were bland.  I used the 12 muffin scale came up short in the end.  Muffins didn't rise much and finished cooking less then the 20 minutes stated.  They almost burned.
So, I didn't waste them.  I broke them up and made bread pudding.  Turned out good too.

These were not bad. I found that they need more than 1/4 cup of sugar. I added one apple some cinnamon and brown sugar, next time I would add more brown sugar. They are good as a breakfast muffin with coffee or tea

This recipe turned out great!! It was so simple, i threw in a cup of chocolate chips before mixing the wet ingredients in with the dry ingredients.  Also, instead of making the 12 muffins , i jusmade 7 large muffins and lowered the oven temp to  375 for about 20 mins, not only were they tasty but they were beautiful looking too!! Next im going to try Banana Coconut! these would also be great with peanut butter and banana or coconut and pineapple

Pretty good.  I substituted !/3 c. of brown sugar instead of white sugar.  I added 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ground cloves, and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg.  I also cut up an apple and added that.  Next time I'm going to reduce the salt and add more brown sugar.  They were not very sweet.  These muffins would make a good breakfast muffin as they are heavy and fill you up.  I only got 10 muffins from the mix.  Overall, I like them and I will be making them again soon.

Very easy and very good.  Following some of the suggestions, I replaced the oil with unsweetened applesauce, increased the sugar to 1/3 cup, and used 3/4 cup whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup bread flour.  I have already made several batches and will make these again and again.

Truly sceptical to try, due to my previous attempts at oatmeal muffins, but after due consideration to the suggestions here, (thanks all) they turned out soooo good; light, not too sweet, easy to make and tasty too. Added mini white choc chips, used brown sugar and got 24 mini muffins and 1 mini loaf (reduced time and temp); rest as is per recipe, mmmmm. Will try other tips next time. Good one.

These were good, but not geat.  The 1st batch I made were kind of bland, so I added raisens and cinnimon to the next batch.  The 2nd batch was much better.  I will probably make again because there are so few carbs. and they are so easy to make.

Really good, esp warm with a little bit of butter.  These are not very sweet which I like a lot.  They are very easy to make too!
