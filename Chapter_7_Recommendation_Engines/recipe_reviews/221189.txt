This is one of my favorite recipes to make for family gatherings (potlucks, reunions, holidays). I like to add one large sliced onion and a teaspoon or so of chili powder for a little kick. I use LTH's Meatball Nirvana recipe (which is also from this site) in this dish. You're best off doubling it because this never fails to go fast. If I'm making this for dinner, I like to serve it with mashed potatoes or buttered rice to soak up all that yummy sauce.

This is a great recipe, but I took it one step further. Instead of the Taco sauce, I used thick salsa & BBQ sauce with the grape Jelly.....totally awesome. Just a little bit of the Salsa goes a long way. 1/4 C of Salsa & 2 C. of BBQ sauce & 1/2 C. grape jelly.Per 15-18 meatballs. It's just me and my husband here.
