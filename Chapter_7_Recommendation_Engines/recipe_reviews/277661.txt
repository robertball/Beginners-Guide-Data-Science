These muffins remind me of a really good carrot cake that just happens to be made with better-for-you ingredients. They are delicious, and surprisingly light for being made with whole wheat flour. I ended up having about 2 1/3 cups grated carrot from shredding 3 large carrots--so I reduced the oil to 1/4 cup to make up for the extra moisture from that. I also really went pretty heavy on the spices (just a personal preference) and would do so again. I baked these in jumbo muffin liners, so I only got 14, but they're pretty good sized. I baked them at 375 so they wouldn't brown too quickly,  and they were perfect in about 23-25 minutes. I also forgot to put the turbinado sugar on top, and I don't think they needed it! They're perfectly sweet for us as-is. Thank you for the recipe!
