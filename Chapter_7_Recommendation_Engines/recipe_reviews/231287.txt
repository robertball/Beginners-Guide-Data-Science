As written, this recipe lacks flavor.   To make it 5 stars,  I made the following changes, which really bumped up the flavor and we enjoy it much more--  when the italian sausage is just browned, add in 1 diced onion, and about a minute later, 3 cloves of minced garlic.  Cook until the onion is translucent and the garlic is fragrant.  Then add in the stock and spices and potatoes.  Once the potatoes are done, stir in the cream and any additional milk (if desired) and season with salt and pepper.  I used 1 cup of heavy cream rather than 2 cups of half-and-half, and omitted most of the milk, using 4 cups of chicken stock.  These minor changes make it much more flavorful and reminiscent of our favorite Italian restaurant's version!

I subbed hot turkey Italian sausage, omitted the pepper flakes, and used Yukon gold potatoes.  These were my only alterations from the recipe.  As far as the directions go, my potatoes were done in 15 minutes, and I did not add any milk or half and half until the end of the cooking, when I allowed them to heat through, but not boil.  This has an amazing aroma as it cooks, and it is a hearty, satisfying soup.  Do not be concerned by the lack of added salt, because the broth and sausage are salty enough to flavor the whole batch.  DH and DS approved!

We are on a low carb diet, but I love potato soup. I researched a replacement for the potato, where I still might have the richness of a potato soup in winter. Radishes!!!  I know, I was weirded out too. But the bite cooks out of them and they have a very similar consistency of potato. We just scrubbed them and left the skins on. The soup doesn't turn out quite a thick, but the taste is satisfying and wonderful without all of the carbs! Per 100 grams, radishes have 3.4 carbs compared to 17 carbs in the potato. Try it!!

I have made this soup but not from this EXACT recipe.  It's pretty much the same, except I added a lot more kale.  Like the other reviewer, I wouldn't add the milk/half & half til after the potatoes and kale have cooked.  It would curdle and I'm always a clutz on the stove top with boiling (I have a 2 yo, that helps distract me :)  Love that I'm getting all the vitamins and yumminess in one bowl!  Hubby could have done without the kale, but he also would eat bacon by the pound if he could!

This was fantastic!  I followed the recipe and it was great.  So far I've made it three times since.  Once I used those round red potatoes.  It was delicious.  Another time, I only had 2% milk and regular chicken broth.  Still delicious.  Last month, I stuffed as much kale as my Dutch oven could handle...still wonderful.  This is my absolute favorite recipe.  You can add little things or leave as-is and you create a wonderfully, comfort soup.  Next time I'll add a picture.  Thanks for sharing!

Great, hearty soup! I made a few revisions though. I sauteed a whole, chopped onion and some garlic in the pot, then added broth, potatoes, and chopped celery.  I let the potatoes cook while I cooked spicy italian sausage on the side. I skipped the red pepper flakes because the sausage was spicy enough for my taste. After about 15 minutes, I added the sausage and tons of kale to the pot. I seasoned with salt, pepper, oregano, and a little garlic powder (what can I say? I really like garlic!). I also added about 2 cups of whole milk and let the whole pot simmer until the kale was tender.  Awesome!  I will be making this again!

I have had this soup a handful of times, made by a friend of mine, and it's one of my favorites. This is the first time I made this on my own. I did change a few things but in my opinion it turned out better than when my friend made it. 

I cooked the hot italian sausage until mostly browned, added the onion and seasoned with garlic powder (didnt have minced) and alittle onion powder. turned the heat up and added 1/2 cup white wine and cooked until evaporated, added two 14oz cans of chicken broth 100% natural (the non low sodium), then added the potatoes which I used double the amount in the recipe. Once potatoes were tender I added double the amount of kale as well. Seasoned with oregano, parsley, basil, pepper, alittle salt, and red pepper flakes, let cook for another 10 minutes then added 2 cups of whole milk and 2 cups of heavy cream. Let cook another 5 minutes and served it up. My fiance and I loved it. My best friend went for seconds, I can't wait to get home from work today to have more!

This was great.  I did make a couple of changes but mostly to the amounts of liquid, we like a thicker soup. 
I used 1 box chicken broth = 4 cups. Omitted the milk and only used 1 cup half&half at the end.  I used 4 cups of golden potatoes, skin on & doubled the kale plus added garlic powder & Italian seasoning. Removed and mashed some of the potato to thicken a bit. Will make again soon using spicy sausage. Delish.

I am not a vegan, but live with one. I made this vegan style a few times using: a very rich homemade veggie broth, vegan style sausage ( I liked the patties that I crumbled the best, I'm not sure if I can use brand names), and  at the end a dash of whatever protein beverage we had around e.g. soy, almond, coconut, rice, etc. type milk's. 
As I said I am not a vegan, but thoroughly enjoyed it vegan style.

This soup is great and I've been making this for twenty five years.  I don't use ground sausage, but use Kielbasa Sausage and use more kale than indicated.  My family loves this!

Good flavor soup.  Similar to a real New England Clam chowder in style.  I make a few changes this time that make it better.  Also, I made mine in the slow cooker and added everything but the half of the 1/2 and 1/2 and potatoes until an hour before done.

My changes this time:
Saut√© onions, 2 carrots dices, one stalk of celery.  Add pepper and oregano.  Deglaze pan with 1/2c Marsala wine but, any wine would do.  Cook until evaporated. Add to slow cooker.  And I diced the kale to sneak it in for the kids.  Don't forget the salt. Not in the recipe.  I season as I go.  Add the potato and rest of the half and half 45min to an hour before ready.  Cooked mine on slow for 6 hours.
Future changes:
Increase sausage to 1 1/2 pounds
Increase Kale to 3 cups.

I liked the basis of this recipe, but the flavor was not there. I added fresh chopped basil, paprika and most of all...SALT!

As written, 4 stars.  With a few minor changes---5 stars.  Changes:  sautee the onion with about 2 tsps minced garlic in with the sausage.  Add broth and potatoes and cook until potatoes are fork tender.  Then add kale (I added as much as I could cram into the pot)!  Once kale is tender (15 mins max), add the half and half and small amount of milk.  Also,  add SALT!  I probably added 1 Tbsp---add according to your taste.  VERY GOOD recipe---will make this again!

I made this soup today and it was fabulous. I didn't have half and half so I substituted heavy whipping cream and more chicken broth than milk.  I also used Swiss Chard instead of Kale.  It was delicious!

I just fixed this and it is sooooo YUMMO!!! I did take the advice in other reviews and add the dairy and the kale in the last few mins. Oh and I did saut√© the onions as well as some mushrooms in with the sausage a few mins before I added the chicken broth and potatoes!!! Can go wrong with this soup!!!

Oh how I love a good soup! And this one is no exception. The only change I made was that I used skim milk because that's all I had and if it made any huge difference, it didn't seem to matter. I did saute my onion in with the sausage, but that was mostly because I didn't really read the instructions. Oh and I used collard greens instead of kale. So I guess I actually made several changes. Anyhoo, it was great. Next time, I'll add more greens, whatever kind I'm using, because there's plenty of room for it and they're so good for you. But there will be lots of next times for this soup as it is now in my permanent "keep" file.

I just made this for the first time, and love it! I switched the quantities of half and half (2 cups) and chicken broth (4 cups) to cut down on calories and fat, used frozen cubed hash brown potatoes to save on chopping time, and doubled the Kale.  It was a hit! Easy and delicious.  I will definitely be making this again.

Excellent recipe.  The half and half  can be reduced without giving up flavor.  Be sure to add some freshly shaved Parmesan when serving.  This would also be great with ham or bacon if you don‚Äôt have Italian sausage.  A can of white beans wouldn‚Äôt hurt either.

Love this soup! I've made it once before. This is a great, better recipe. I use red potatoes, and depending on who I'm making it for, I'll use whole milk & half & half, or heavy cream. I have made it with spicy turkey Italian sausage (my preference) & it is delicious. I've also made it wth spicy Italian pork sausage, and both are awesome. This soup is delicious with warm breadsticks & a salad. I've added carrots before & it was awesome. Be sure to add the kale last as it doesn't need to cook very long. This soup is also great with swiss chard, but kale is my favorite. It's hearty & very filling.

My family really likes this soup. We use the hot Italian sausage, so we omit the red pepper flakes. I also add a drained can of whole corn kernels, a pinch of thyme, and about 1.5 tsp of dehydrated garlic. I probably use more potatoes, so I use 4 C broth and instead of the milk and cream I use about 1.5 C coconut milk...the thick canned kind is creamier than boxed. Anyway, its hearty & flavorful, and gets ya eating Kale! This is a great base recipe to make or tweek if you want to!

Absolutely wonderful soup.  Made substitutions based on what was on hand.  Used more Kale and less Italian sausage; substituted 1/2 and 1/2 and whipping cream, and milk used was 2%.  Used chicken broth and no water.

This soup was a hit. I made it one night for a first date type of thing. It was the first time I had ever cooked for this man. After being very skeptical of the kale, he absolutely loved it so much he went back for seconds!

Good flavor.  Substituted chicken sausage, 2% milk and fat free half and half, only 2 cups.  Very thin, so next time will use the full fat half and half and more chicken sausage.  Followed suggestion of others to add milk products at end and heat thru.

I did make quite a few changes so maybe it's not fair to rate... but I found it to be lacking flavor. I used hot Italian sausage and left out the crushed red pepper. I used 4 cups of homemade vegetable broth to simmer the potatoes, then added 1.5 cups of heavy cream with the kale and black pepper. I thought there was too much broth and not much flavor other than the spice of the sausage. I'll eat the rest but probably won't make again

I changed the recipe a bit. i didnt have a pot big enough, so i used my crockpot. it took about 3 to 3.5 hours to cook the potatos. i added garlic cloves to the stock and minced garlic to the browning sausage. i doubled the amount of spices in the recipe. i subbed 2 cups of heavy cream instead of half-n-half and milk. i wish i would have had a cup or 2 more in the soup. i added bacon pieces as well. i used yukon potatos and a yellow onion. PLUS, my friend‚Äôs man gave me a bunch of deer meat, so i used deer sausage. very good. i love gamey meat and it does not taste gamey in this soup. i also added parmesean as well. i will make this again for sure!!

Quick and easy and very yummy!  I made some small changes to make it quicker and easier.  I used all milk and added chicken bouillon (no 1/2 and 1/2 and no chicken stock).  I also cut the potato cubes very small so it would cook super fast, and it did!

My families new favorite soup!   Full of flavor, easy to make, everyone loves it.  I slightly rinse the cooked sausage as another had suggested, (just to keep the soup from becoming orange) but not too much.   No need to make changes to this recipe, it's wonderful as is!

So easy that even i can make it! I try to stay lower carb, so i used radishes at the suggestion of another reviewer. Also, i'm lactose intolerant, so i subbed almond milk for whole milk and that coconut milk that comes in a can for half and half. I used 2 cans.  I used one whole bunch of kale, and half a bunch of spinach. I also put in a red bell pepper because it was just sitting there, and i didn't want it to go bad. When i make it again, i'll probably use more sausage.  But yeah, totally easy, and totally delicious.

An excellent soup for a cold winter's day. I used the same amount of liquid but divided it differently than in the recipe - 4 cups no salt chicken broth, 2 cups cream and 2 cups milk. A little 'less rich' option of the original recipe.

For a healthier version, I reduced the half and half to 2 cups and increased the chicken broth to 4 cups.  I also used skim milk rather than whole milk.  While I'm sure the creamier version was excellent, we were very satisfied with the lower fat version and it was very easy to make.  Will definitely make it again.  Delicious!

Super easy to make (mostly because hubby did most of the prep work!)! Will make again. I did use baby tri-color potatoes just for fun and tasted amazing! Also added garlic.  Makes a huge batch-can easily halve the recipe or feeeze the left overs!

I boiled the potatoes ahead of  time and boiled the kale with the cooked sausage and broth ahead of time.  I did not want to boil the milk and half and half so added them at the end.  My husband loved this soup.  I used turkey sausage to get rid of most of the fat. I also used fat-free evaporated milk instead of half and half and low fat milk rather than whole milk.  My husband swears he can tell if something is low fat, but the flavor was so good he didn't know.

I made a few modifications suggested by other reviews.  I sauteed 1 tbsp minced garlic with the sausage and then added another TBSP with the broth.  I omitted the milk completely and I waited to add the half and half until the end of cooking. I added 1/2 cups of red wine with the chicken broth.  I used 5 cans of chicken broth and 9 medium Yukon gold potatoes (it was what I had in the house so it probably was a bit more than called for in the recipe.)  I started with 4 cans of broth but let the soup simmer for several hours to let some of the potatoes cook down to thicken so I ended up adding the last can before adding the kale.  I then added a full pound of chopped kale and let that all cook down.  Then I added 4 cups of Fat free half and half.  Maybe my sausage was spicier because I did not miss the red pepper flakes that I omitted.  I tend to not like really spicy food.

Maybe because I had to use gluten free sausage but I found it needed more spice.  We added salt which helped (and I never salt anything!).  Next time I will use a spicy Italian sausage.

Just made this soup last night. Absolutely delicious.  You dont need the crushed red peppers. The sausage makes the soup spicy enough. I only bought a pint of half and half. So I only used 1 1/2 cups of milk. I took the other reviewers advice and put the dairy and kale at the end. I also used red potatoes with the skin on.

I used recipe as a base. Basically, combing potatoes, sausage, and kale will not lead you wrong. I used andouille and thyme because that is what I had. Bon Appetite!

First time trying with the milk.  I used turkey Italian sausage added some sea salt and used 2% milk instead of whole, whole cream instead of half and half but used less than recipe suggested and added more broth and finally, I used Purple potatoes instead. It was awesome!!!

This hearty soup can be a side dish or even the main part of the meal. You can be flexible to some extent with your ingredients. If you don't have kale, use spinach. Any sausage will do, I have used pork sausage, italian sausage, and smoked sausage. I often use left over mashed potatoes in place of the potatoes in the recipe. You can use half/half, milk, or cream. So easy!

Everyone loved it. A little modification: I added salt as well as pepper to taste while it simmered and used spicy Italian sausage. That gave it a little kick that folks loved.

Instead of Half and half, all I had was a cup of cream. I made the rest up of whole milk but I added it according to the recipe without any of the curdling concerns mentioned in some other reviews. I also added half again the oregano and red pepper because I usually enjoy more flavor.

It's good, BUT only if you disregard the absolutely insane recipe. FOUR cups of half-and-half AND two cups of whole milk?!?!! If you use like a quarter of that, it'll taste good. Otherwise you'll just be drinking warm half-and-half with meat in it.

I absolutely loved this, it curbed my craving for an expensive trip to olive garden, and I could fully enjoy that second bowl.  My daughter could even help me, and we had a great time.  It was easy enough for us both.

I made it, it disappeared!  I didn't get to taste it but I heard it was good. I'm making it again, right now!  Nobody will get any until I get my fill. Smells heavenly.....
So, I‚Äôm making this soup for the 3rd time. I saut√©ed onions and garlic after the sausage was done. I also used more heavy cream and no milk. I added a small of cumin to the other seasonings. Delicious!!!!

Delicious! and I have made this several times. I always add extra kale. My only recommendation is to closely watch the soup while it simmers. If it gets to hot the cream will separate. If this happens there is no way to correct it. It still tastes amazing, just doesn't look nice.

I took the advise of some other reviews and omitted the milk and increased broth to 4 cups instead. I added 1/2 tsp white pepper with the black pepper, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1 Tbsp fresh parsley, and then 2 cups of a shredded Italian cheese blend immediately after turning off the heat, because I enjoy cheese in potato soups. I also substituted the sausage with 4 polish sausages cut into half moons (regular polish in one pot and vegetarian in another), vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, and 3 Tbsp dried chopped onion since I forgot to buy regular onions. We really enjoyed it, although I would double both the potatoes and kale next time to make it a little heartier. With the changes, this recipe is a keeper!

Loved how this soup turned out! I substituted the half and half and whole milk for 1 cup of heavy cream, and added it towards the end when adding the kale. I also used about 4 cups of the lower sodium chicken broth. I probably tripled the amount of kale in the recipe, and I added about 4 cloves of minced garlic and more oregano to the recipe for more flavor. Just little tweaks here and there but it turned out great!

We love this soup! I add in chopped link sausage as well. I brown the bulk sausage first, then put it on a plate and drain off the grease. Then brown the chopped link sausage in the same pan. I cook the chopped bacon last, and after removing the meat from the pan, I saut√© the onion in the bacon grease. When onions are soft, I drain any remaining grease.

This is terrific, but after reading the reviews I decided to do things a bit differently, as suggested.  Browned the Italian sausage (hot) and added onion and lots of garlic.  Added basil and parsley to the spices, and used more 1 1/2 times more kale and potatoes.  Used 4 cups of chicken broth.  Milk and half and half went in for final 5 minutes -- 1 cup milk and 2 cups half and half.  Next time I may not add the same amount of red pepper, if I use the HOT Italian sausage.  However, if you like really spicy, then that is the way to go!

Super good! Subbed a few things. Ham instead of bacon, heavy cream instead of half and half and some extra broth. Added fresh rosemary. If you add your cheese rinds, turns out super yummy! Definitely recommend.

I made it as written with these 2 exceptions: sweet Italian sausage, sweet vidalia onions, and more kale.  It was a crowd pleaser and even better the second day.  A very satisfying soup!

It is difficult to rate the recipe because I really just used it as a jumping off point to make it mine and just because I didn‚Äôt use dairy in it at all, doesn‚Äôt mean this recipe isn‚Äôt good. I rated a 4 giving it the benefit of the doubt. I made mine in an Insta Pot 6 qt Ultra set to soup/stew. I added diced  onion after browning the sausage, then added diced celery, carrot and red bell pepper, that I needed to use up. My co-op had an abundance of kale so I doubled the amount.  I used salt, pepper, garlic powder and oregano. I added 2 cans of cannelloni beans instead of potatoes to reduce the glycemic index a bit. I read one reviewer who suggested radishes to replace potatoes, which I found quite intriguing, so I plan to do that next time.

I used bratwurst because that's what I had, and so I doubled the red pepper flakes and oregano to make up for the blander-tasting sausage.  It turned out really tasty.  I'll make it again.

I made changes based on what I had on hand.  I had a similar soup at Olive Garden, I think it was.  I used spicy breakfast sausage, and (to my shock) did not have any chicken broth in my house, so I used a can of condensed cream of chicken soup.    I played around with the cream and milk a little because of the cream of chicken.  I also browned my onion with the sausage.  I used a little more potato and a little more kale to it.  I saw no need for salt in this recipe.  This was very good and will make it again soon.

Only big change I made was making it KETO friendly, by using a full head of cauliflower,  chopped coarse, instead of potatoes. It doesn‚Äôt take that long to boil. I also add 6 ounces of crumbled bacon, with the kale. So delicious!

Only gave it 4 stars because I changed it, but definitely will make again! I used hot Italian sausage and added 2 stalks diced celery, a large sliced carrot, and 2 tsp minced garlic  plus about 1 Tbsp fresh thyme. Didn't have half & half, so I used milk and added about 1/2 c. mascarpone cheese  to thicken it, as hubby likes his soup more like a stew. We loved it!  The pepper at the end really finishes this soup.

My wife makes this quite often and it has become one of my favorites. This soup is in our rotation now. We put mushrooms in ours (morels)but other than that that is the only real deviation. Five stars and a Hip Hip Hurray!

This is so delicious, there is never any left at the end of a meal. The only thing I changed was to use real bacon bits in a bag instead of frying the bacon and just saute the onions in sausage drippings,

I precooked the sausage and onions in a frying pan drained and put in a slow cooker added all ingredients except the Kale. Cooked on low and added kale just before eating. Besides that I stuck to the recipe. Turned out awesome. Next time I might add a carrot or two.

I loved this. I saut√©ed the onion with the sausage and added a minced garlic clove. Like some other reviews said, I didn‚Äôt add the milk and cream until the end. I also added more chicken broth and less half and half. Delicious.

I‚Äôve made a similar version of this many times.i sweat onions garlic and carrots then add 6-8 cups chicken broth and omit the milk and half and half as these forms of dairy will curdle if boiled. I add about a half to a cup of cream at the end of cooking as it is the only dairy that will not curdle when boiled or frozen and thawed.this version freezes very well.i also slice my potatoes and add extra kale or you can use spinach instead.very tasty

This soup was delicious! I only had 2% milk and it did need salt like others said. I will definitely make this again! Reminded me of the soup at Olive Garden. I will cut back on the red pepper flakes next time. Little too spicy.

This soup is a bit more fattening than the ‚Äúhack‚Äù of Olive Garden‚Äôs ‚ÄúTuscan Soup‚Äù, BUT...is richer and more delicious than the former, so guess which recipe I‚Äôm putting in my hip pocket for future meals...?

I used about a quart and a half of chicken stock and maybe 2 cups half and half.   DO NOT add any salt until it is done and you taste it!! The hot sausage and chicken broth made it salty enough for me, and I am a salt lover.  It was wonderful!!!

I followed the recipe and it tastes good but it curdled! What did I do wrong? I have been cooking for 65 years and do not remember having this happen before. I hope someone can explain.

My husband and I loved it for dipping hot, crunchy French bread into.  It lacked a little flavor and the consistency was too thin.  Next time I will use some of the suggestions noted by other cooks; definitely needs less half and half.  I'll make it again!

I was short 2 cups of 1/2 & 1/2 and used reduced fat milk. Still turned out great as the 3rd degree burns on my tongue will tell you. I would definitely make again, considering I have a huge bag of kale left over.

I'm weary of making dishes I find online but I do not regret this. It was absolutely de-lic-ious!! 

I made some adjustments to the recipe...used 3 cups of chicken broth, added 3 cloves of garlic with the onion. Did not add milk. Added 2 cans of cannellini beans (rinsed), also added more potatoes and kale. This made a lot and I'm only 1 person but I'm happy to have leftovers.

This turned out amazing. I used sweet potatoes and purple sweet potatoes to give it color and a bit of sweetness to cut the richness from the cream. Also, I used a cup of heavy cream and 3 cups of half and half. I added 2 cloves of fresh garlic and used fresh oregano instead of dried oregano. I used a bit of onion powder, garlic powder and pink Himalayan salt.

Great recipe, but I added garlic (because I always add garlic to soup).  We loved the flavor from red pepper  and kale.  Next time I will double the kale and thicken up the soup by mashing some of the potatoes.

This recipe is very much like the copycat recipes for Olive Garden's Zuppa Tuscana.  I have a very similar recipe which calls it "Zuppa Tuscana."  We love it.

This is called Zuppa Toscana (sp?), otherwise known as the Olive Garden soup.  I have made it many, many times.  I use heavy whipping cream and I leave the peel on the potatoes, it is always DELICIOUS!!

I absolutely loved this soup. It came out great. I made it during  one of several rainy and cold days here in L.A. recently. Perfect hearty soup to enjoy while curled on the couch with a blanket. Will definitely make again.

Great Flavor, and a great recipe for kale.
I used turkey kielbasa instead of the sausage. I thought the quantity of the half-and-half was a bit much and suggest adding the milk products at the end to keep them from breaking and getting grainy.
Will definitely make it again!

I think I prefer my own recipe that I use...the difference is cooking 3 strips of bacon first, then cooking chopped onion in the bacon fat , adding then adding the onion to the potatoes on the stove being boiled in a mixture of chicken broth and water. Once the potatoes are mostly cooked, then you add the cream, kale, red pepper flakes and salt and pepper letting it simmer for another few minutes until soup is hot. My favorite soup on a cold day!

This recipe is 5 stars as is.  When I want a lower calorie/lower fat version I use turkey Italian sausage  (hot or sweet depending on my mood) which I remove from the casing.  Evaporated milk and cauliflower florets (chopped the same size as you would the potatoes)  and it is still excellent.   If you can splurge for real parmigiannio regianno to sprinkle on the top, it really takes the soup to the next level

I added some salt and garlic powder, used baby red potatoes and used baby spinach instead of kale. It was delicious!! It‚Äôs a lot, so I froze it and it kept well in the freezer!

Yes made changes.  Used a pound of ground chicken breakfast sausage (mild), sauteed in olive oil (chicken is dry), toward end added 1/2 cup chopped brown onion.  did not have kale, so used organic fresh spinach (not from a box, but purchased as a "bunch" - about 3 cups.  baby size leaves, so used cooking scissors to cut it up a bit as it wilted.   Used 3 cups of chicken broth, two medium potatoes cubed to sugar cube size, as it cooked, I added 2 cups half and half (so it would absorb the spices, which it wont as much when added at the end.  Added 2 teaspoons smoked paprika, a teaspoon of dried parsley, freshly ground pepper and no salt (the chicken broth is already salty, did not have low sodium).  also added 3 stalks of chopped celery, 1/2 chopped green pepper while the onions cooked.   I did not add the garlic.  I tasted the ground chicken after it had cooked completely before I added any other spices, and it had a garlic fragrance already.   I will definitely make this again! Oh, and I omitted the milk, just the 1 and 1/2 of half and half.

I forgot to post.  Made this late last year.  It was an awesome soup and tasted just like the large chain restaurant which I won't name.  Hubby thoroughly enjoyed it, though my mother thought it was too spicy.  I used a hot ndouille sausage.  Will make this again.

I loved it! I didn‚Äôt do exact spice/seasoning measurements, but otherwise followed the recipe. I might make adjustments to try to thicken it up a little in the future; but overall, taste and consistency were great!

A cool/cold weather favorite in our house.  First had this soup at Olive Garden, and looked all over for a recipe.  Absolutely love it!  This recipe needs no tweaking.

One of my favorite soups in one of my favorite restaurants so I thought I would try a recipe out myself. I saut√©ed the sausage onions and 2cloves garlic in my instant pot and then removed when done. I then added chicken broth potatoes oregano and cooked on soup setting for 20 minutes. I quick release the pressure and added onion and garlic mixture back in as well as 1.5 cups half and half and 2cups chopped baby kale. 
It was super fast and easy to make. 
I do not know why you would want more liquid as even this is very soupy. I‚Äôm guessing that is why some reviews comment the soup being so bland. 
I will definitely be making this again!

This recipe was simple and delicious! Personally it called for way too much half and half/milk, so I just used less and more chicken broth. Added sun-dried tomatoes and used fresh herbs (rosemary/thyme/oregano). Two thumbs up!

Very good and easy to make. I did add a clove of garlic and some salt since I use my own homemade chicken stock (unsalted.) I used more kale since we like that.

I made it with Italian turkey meatballs (recipe from All Recipes) in place of the sausage. 
I also used replaced most of the milk with chicken broth, and only added 3/4 cup of heavy cream. 
I will make this again, and decrease the oregano to 1/4 tsp. I really liked the base recipe!

I've been making this soup for years.  It is a family, friends & neighborhood favorite.  We like it so much that it's made 30-40 quarts at a time and shared. It is an extremely forgiving recipe. 
When I make it I use Sweet Italian and Hot Italian sausage in equal parts.  Then there's no need for the red pepper flakes, etc.  Cream adds a better flavor than regular milk and should be added at the end.  And, for some reason, it doesn't matter how much kale you add, it's not enough (lol).  Just stuff as much kale in as the pot will take.  
Thank you for posting the recipe.  When friends ask I've never been able to figure out the small amounts for a "normal" pot of soup.  Now I can send them to this recipe.

This recipe uses WAY too much cream and milk. I had to alter it so much to eat it. It tasted like i was drinking straight milk. Ive made this soup before, this recipe is by far the worst I've used.

This was really good. I used 1% milk instead of whole (because it's what I keep in the house), and it was still rich and creamy, so no need to worry about sticking to whole milk for this recipe.

Thought this was great! Even my husband, who rarely is a fan of soup and definitely not a fan of kale, liked it. I browned the sausage with onion and garlic. Saut√©ed the spices for a few minutes and then put in 4 cups of broth with the potatoes. When the potatoes were cooked, I threw in two chopped zucchini and the kale and simmered until fork tender. And finished it with about a cup of heavy cream. Delish!

It is a pretty good recipe but I would highly suggest substituting the whole milk for more chicken broth because otherwise it turns out waaaaaay too creamy, and I am a creamy soup fan for sure

I made this for a Christmas Potluck. Just a few changes, I used bacon in place of sausage, I used red potatoes. I also used 5 cups of kale and added 1 cup of heavy cream. My husband cant have red pepper flakes so I did without, he wont even go near kale and he ate 2 bowls of this. I cooked the soup on low for 3 hours before adding the milk, I left it on low for another hour.  I doubled the recipe hoping for leftovers... no such luck it was the first thing that was gone....This will be a regular recipe in my home .

Delicious!! I was prompted to try this because it reminded me of the sausage soup from  Olive Garden which I love. Not only was it tasty,  but also easy to make. This is a keeper!

I made this and added a bit more pepper flakes as i like things a bit spicy and additionally garlic salt as this can be a bit bland if you do not add some salt or spice. This was delicious and very similar to a soup I‚Äôve had out at a famous restaurant. This soup does not fail to warm you on a cold day!

We did not use the milk or half and half so it was a rich broth only. This means fewer calories and those with milk allergies can enjoy this great soup. Substitute vegetable juice for dairy liquid. Another option is to use low fat sour cream or plain yogurt in lieu of half and half. Try different options for those lower calorie needs.

This is my second time making this. I remember it being excellent last time but I did a few little things different. Double the oregano, double the Kale, 5 cups Yukon potatoes, no chili peppers, spicy hot Italian sausage, browned onions in a little sausage grease and a little butter, cooked potatoes, sausage, onion, in 3 cups chicken broth until tender. Then add Kale  and milk and half and half. warm until kale is done.

I made the recipe as written except the pepper flakes.  The next time I make this I will cut the recipe in half.  It is good warmed up but the kale isn't as crisp.

Careful with the hot pepper flakes! Especially if your sausage is already spicy. I also added twice the kale called for.

this was a great use for kale, and the soup was divine.  i don't know about bumping up the flavor.  i always use homemade chicken broth, so get lots of flavor out of that and i reckon potato soup always gets  a taste jolt from a shot or two of texas peter extra hot.

It was so delicious! My husband and sister-in-law (who is hard to please), loved it!! I left out the milk....my goodness, 4 cups (32 ounce carton) of half and half is enough dairy already!  I just upped the broth to 4 cups instead of 2....I added more kale than called for and WAITED until the last 5 minutes to add the H&H....so delicious...
Next time I am making a plant-based version...as suggested by another user...vegetable broth....almond milk..."Beyond Meat" crumbles....VERY meat-like, but made from PEAS!! Awesome meat substitute. I found the "Beyond Meat" at Whole Foods (learned about it on Dr. Oz)...they make incredible "meatlike" burgers that my meat loving husband really likes...in fact, we are having those tonight. Anyway, next time, I am doing a whole plant-based version and will add to the review when I do.

I  make this about every week.  It's absolutely addictive.   The first time I made it I followed the recipe.   Now I just use whatever milk products I have on hand.  Once I used almond milk to cut the calories a bit, but the family didn't like the taste.  Cooking it again today and I ran to the store and got the half and half along with whole milk.  I literally crave this soup.  Thank you for your recipe.

Great recipe but I did make some changes. I actually use this recipe to make just sausage & potato soup. I leave out the kale because hubby. I use 1 cup or so of heavy whipping cream instead of half & half and the milk, only because I never have that much milk in fridge. I use 8 cups of homemade chicken stock. I put in 7 or 8 cups of potatoes skin on & wait until potatoes are done to add cream. Add onion while sausage is cooking & some garlic. I know some people say not to alter recipes, but I'm an on the fly chef & can deal with changes & I feel confident doing that so there! plus changes are fun and can suit peoples needs.

Had to substitute evaporated milk for half and half (used 2 cans) and added garlic salt to cut the taste of the  evap. milk, plus some dried onion flakes.  Everybody loved it...hurray!  So I will make it again!

I added carrots & celery but would give it 5stars regardless as without this recipe, would not have enjoyed/made this great soup. I think anybody rating a recipe should bear in mind, would you have made it in the first place without submitters recipe? That, in my mind, is how to rate a recipe & not based on any changes you made, which after all, is a matter of personal preference

Love this! Next time I will add lots more kale.  Also very good with chunks of stale bread added at serving, for texture.

I made this soup as followed, or so I thought...the flavor is delicious but it curdled...what could I have done wrong. Taste good just not appetizing to look at. Will try again.

Sorry but I really thought the sausage was too overpowering of a flavor for this soup.  I won't make it again.  Maybe with a different meat it might be good, as it has potential, but not as written.  I used mild Italian sausage.

A really good belly warming soup. I added the half-and-half at the end, used more broth and eliminated the milk like others I reviewed did. It needed more potatoes than the recipe asked for and I added chopped celery, more kale and a few carrots. Didn't add the red pepper since the sausage was spicy enough. The basics of this recipe gave me ideas  to try all kinds of variations in the future using whatever I have on hand.

Next time I will use skin-on Yukon gold potatoes and cook for 10 minutes before adding to milk.  I will also use small white pearl onions if I can find them, a few cloves of garlic, 6 cups 1/2 & 1/2, 2-3 cups chicken stock, extra kale, and add one can of cannellini  beans.  Smoked sausage would also be a good substitute for the Italian. 

I think the secret to this recipe is this:  It calls for potatoes - use your favorite; it calls for onions - use your favorite; it calls for sausage - use your favorite; it calls for greens - use your favorite, and in the amount you prefer; it calls for a white base - use your favorite.  I like a rich creamy white base, so I add Cannellini  beans to balance it out the cream and make it healthier.  The result is Heaven!

Made this as is and it needed more flavor.  Cook sausage and drain.  Add 1 can drained kidney beans, garlic and chopped carrots.  Also, cooked some cheese tortellini and put into bowls.  Serve hot soup over tortellini and serve with crusty bread.  Delicious.

This was a huge hit.  I followed the recipe and the only change I made was almond milk because that is what we drink.  My son, 9 year old, asked me to make it again.  Definitely a reoccurring soup in our house!!

I subbed cauliflower for the potatoes to lower the carbs. Going to sub almond milk for whole  milk next time to lower them further, and add fresh thyme. Delicious!

Soup had too much milk, not enough flavor. If I try again, I will add less milk, more broth, maybe chicken buillion.  Very bland.

This  was spectacular as recipe reads. Fragrant, delicious and filling.Next time I'll use less half&half and add the sausage last 15 min of cooking time and lots of kale last 5mins.  Good soup!

I'll definitely make it again - my guests loved it.  I reduced the half and half to 2 cups, increased the milk by one c.  Also, I cooked some of the potato ahead of time, in chicken broth, and pureed this - it thickens the soup, making it seem richer and creamier without adding calories.  I doubled the kale.  Didn't add the half and half until the end, just heating up to serving temp.

I used coconut milk instead of the whole milk and 1/2 n 1/2, and it was delicious!! I also used purple fingerling potatoes for a little added nutrition along with some chopped napa cabbage. Using the purple potatoes darkened up the soup broth without changing the great flavor of the soup. I will definitely be making this soup again!!

I will definitely make it again! We used a local sausage called Mabelle which is a southern specialty as well as using pre-cooked bacon in place of pancetta. My husband ate two bowls and he hates greens!

A really good soup.  Very different from others I make.  I let out the potatoes, simply because i didn't have any, and we totally enjoyed it.

I couldn't fine hot Italian sausage so used hot links and cut  them in pieces.  It was very good!  Everyone liked it! Even my husband who really doesn't like kale! I will make it again.

My husband and I really enjoyed it- he got extra helpings. It was a little too spicy for my youngest, though. Next time I'll reduce or eliminate the red pepper flakes.

For some reason when I added the half & half to the hot pan as per the recipe, it started curling, don't know why...Should the pan had been cold, it doesn't say that....Then it wouldn't thicken.   Maybe I dd something wrong, but I followed the recipe.  Maybe down the line I will try again.

So good! I doubled this recipe & used regular  milk to cut fat from half & half. Used only I teaspoon of red pepper flakes. It ended up being to spicy for the kids. Next time less spicy. I just added sour cream to kids bowl to cut the heat. Otherwise kids raved about it.

This recipe was delicious! I paired it with a salad and bread sticks. My husband was sweating with the amount of crushed red peppers I used (I like heat), but he said to add to our recipe box! The heavy cream was indeed "heavy", I will use half and half next time.

This soup receipe well received by my picky family....I think the smells wafting through the backyard while the soup cooked got them to try it and then ultimately say "can we have more?" With some garlic bread it was our Sunday meal. I did cut the potatoes in smaller pieces and did add a carrot....btw... I did hear the neighbor say... what smells so good?.... Oh, it's Hans cooking again!!!...ha!

This one of the best soups I have ever made! The only thing I changed is substitute potatoes for sweet potatoes and if you don't have fresh kale, I used packaged baby kale. I double the amount of each serving if you have a big family!

We loved it, I had to make a few changes due to ingredients  on hand.  I used apple chicken sausage for sausage, added chicken and used 4 cups of kale.  I will try to follow recipe next time but loved it with a little change due to ingredients
on hand.

I made the following modifications:
1/16 ts cayenne instead of Red Pepper flakes ---
1/2 ts   Italian Seasoning instead of Oregano---
4 C        torn Kale instead of 2 C---
4 C        Golden Potatoes instead of 3 C---
4 C        Chicken Broth instead of 2 C Milk + 2 C chicken Broth---
1 C         fat-free Half-and-Half---
4             Grilled Italian sausages thinly sliced, instead of Bulk---
Added 1/4 ts  Garlic Powder---
Added 1 ts       Cornstarch + 1 T water

This makes a wonderful soup meal..  Thank you for your recipe.

I like my soups a little thick so the only modification I made was add a little cornstarch. Very rich though is my only complaint.

My husband thought it was the best soup I ever made. I'm sure it would be excellent the way it is, but i did make some changes to accommodate what I had on hand..so i call my version "MustGo Potato Sausage, Kale" Soup.Only had half the amount of sausage so I added bacon, power greens instead of kale

I followed the suggestions of adding the milk and 1/2 & 1/2 at the end. Used skim milk rather than whole and doubled the kale. Very good flavor

My family loved it!! I did add extra kale and potatoes to make it more hearty. I added extra red peppers too and seasoning salt. I added a little extra everything. Just seasoned to taste. This is so good!! Great cold weather food!! Definitely will make again and again! :-)

Great hearty soup!!!!  Totally enjoyed it!  Changes that I made include using sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes, added about 4 cups of kale instead of the 2 cups called for in the recipe, and instead of 4 cups of half and half, I used 1/2 cup of cream and then added 1/2 of an envelope of instant mashed potatoes to thicken it up.

I've made a similar receive for several years. It's based on a soup from a well known Italian restaurant.  My only change is bacon. I fry up  4 to 5 slices , remove to cool and crumble into the soup while it simmers. Most important, I Sautee the onions in the bacon grease. This is such a wonderful soup, we love it.

I used hot italian sausage and reserved some of the oil to saute the vegetables in the pot.  That was the key to good flavor in this soup.  The rest of the ingredients are so simple and mellow that using a good sausage is the most important component.  I always saute vegetables to bring out the flavor before adding the stock.  I added more oregano (about 2 teaspoons) and some salt for flavor, and it turned out delicious!  It was simple and quick to make, which is always a winner for me!

Wow, what a great soup. I added some garlic to the sausage and fried the onions with it, then used more chicken stalk and less whole milk. It turned out so great. We are going to make it again! Thanks!

This is a great recipe!  It's almost hard to go wrong with it - I only had 1/2 # sausage, so used that, and felt it was plenty meaty.  After browning the sausage, I saut√©ed the onion and 4 cloves minced garlic, then added the chicken broth and potatoes, along with all other ingredients except kale, and milk/cream.  I also added chopped parsley and chopped basil.  When the potatoes were almost done, I added the kale, 1 C whipping cream and 2 C non-fat milk, because that's all I had on hand.  We loved it!  I plan to try it substituting low-fat cream cheese for the cream, just to cut down on fat.  Thanks for this tasty, easy recipe!

Wonderful taste.  Will make again for guests.  Nice cold weather treat.  Next time will sub cream for milk.  I prefer the richness.  Also added a pinch of nutmeg for fun.  I used yukon gold potatoes.  I followed suggestions to add milk and cream last.  I browned sausage in skillet before adding to soup pot.  I put some fresh chopped mushrooms for an earthy touch.  Kale adds interesting contrast.  The sweet onion I used gives soup a very slightly sweet hint which works nicely with the nutmeg.

This is nearly like the soup at Olive Garden.  I do add some celery to mine.  We all enjoy it as a cold weather soup.
Sometimes I use spinach instead of kale..  serve with fresh baked corn bread.  Mmm good!

I layered taters, raw chicken sausage, kale and collard greens, garlic and onions in my crock pot. I used water and onion soup mix and added cream cheese since I did not have the half and half or milk. I cooked it on high for 3 hours and let it simmer for another hour. Outstanding!

I left out the red pepper flakes, used Italian Chicken sausage. Instead of oregano, I used 1 1/2 teaspoons of Italian seasoning. Yukon gold potatoes and a whole vadalia/sweet onion, chopped. 1 lb chopped kale.  Delish!

I have made this several times. It is remarkably similar to Olive Garden's Zuppa Toscano which was why I made it originally. I precook the potatoes then cube them. The kale isn't added until the end to keep it from getting soggy. Otherwise the recipe I used was very much like this one. To those who expected the flavor to grab them by the tongue... this is a cream soup, It might be peppery if you add enough but that is not the aim. Otherwise it is a fusion of the ingredients. GREAT SOUP!

My grandmother had a simple four ingredient soup, similar to this. Chourico, potatoes, kale, and cabbage. Boil it all together, and you have a base for authentic Portuguese soup. 
Grandpa would add beef short ribs, and kidney beans.

This is a variation on a soup I make and my kids LOVE. It's basically, the Zuppa Toscana from Olive Garden. Only thing I change from this recipe is to fry up some bacon until crispy and set aside. I drain the grease, but leave the bacon remnants and cook the sausage and onion here.  Then I add the rest with the goal of cooking everything in one pot. I slice my potatoes with the skin on; the larger pieces hold up better and make less mush. Also, I probably double the kale or as much as the liquid will tolerate--it's a hardy soup! The half and half goes in at the very end, to avoid the curdle factor.  Garnish with shredded Parmesan cheese and crumbled bacon just before serving.

I made this late night and here are some tips I'd like to share: (1) If you're soup tastes bland or like milk and cream, I suggest adding fennel seeds and powdered mustard. (2) Add salt as late as  you can since the chicken stock and sausage can augment the saltiness.

Hearty soup! Omitted the red pepper flakes and added the dairy at the end (following the suggestion of many reviewers). I doubled the amount of kale, probably close to tripled it - I couldn't imagine what the soup would have been like otherwise. I added a touch of salt to make up for the extra kale Also, I used low fat half and half and 2% milk. Still delicious - although much thinner than using full fat. Definitely will make this again.

A very hearty soup.  I left the skins on red potatoes and coarsely chopped them. I also added crumbled cooked bacon because I didn't have any sausage and it was delicious! Add more spices to your taste, if you like.

The soup tastes good, but I thought the busy-ness of the ingredients took away from the potato flavor. As to the posts that suggested that some sort of salt should be added, since I began cutting salt out of my diet years ago I didn't notice any deficit in flavor. My problem with the soup is that the potato flavor is mild compared to what the Italian sausage brought to the dish; but then it was the inclusion of the sausage that attracted me to the recipe in the first place. I'm going to try a ham and potato recipe next time. I'm going back for seconds now!

This recipe needs two things changed, I followed the rest of the directions and my soup was the best!   I feel strongly that we should use  Heavy Cream instead, that is what makes it taste like you ordered it at a wonderful restaurant!  Also, NEVER EVER boil milk products you use in your soups and cassarole's, this upsets the texture, thickness and the flavor of Cream, Half-n- Half or Milk. 
 Just boil what needs to boiled in the broth then, at the end when it is still very hot but no longer boiling,  add your  Dairy-of-Choice.  Serve warm as usual!  It eill be creamier and tastier.
Just my opinion and I thought I'd share.

I've made this soup several times now. Absolutely delicious! However, I add a  bay leaf and about a tablespoon worth of fresh minced garlic. And add the milk and cream with the kale towards the end.  I've seen a lot of reviews saying it lacks flavor and this way makes it perfect.

I have made this a few times and it's great! Agree that Yukon Gold potatoes are perfect. We also use other sausage, like chicken and apple. I've also substituted half of the half in half with nonfat milk and it's been fine. Definitely recommend smaller piece is kale. Red pepper flakes definitely give a kick, but not too much. Yummy yummy!

Followed this recipe almost exactly and found it to be a bit bland - it needed a little something extra. It was almost as if the flavor was buried in there somewhere and we just couldn't quite get it out there. My husband had the idea to add a little sriracha sauce (which is was super skeptical about because I didn't think it would go with the recipe) and turns out, he's a genius. I just added enough to make it have some flavor (not too spicy) and it made all the difference. It enhanced the flavor so much and after that small addition, we both thought it was delicious!!! If you decide to do this, I would recommend adding it sparingly until it tastes how you like it!

Yum!!  I will definitely be making this many times over.  Couple changes:  hot Italian sausage for me!  It also adds a great flavor to the soup that the oregano and red pepper can't do all on their own, just be ready for some spicy.  The only other changes I made were, yellow potatoes, more kale, more potatoes, and heavy cream thinned with more broth (I didn't have enough half and half).  But to me these last changes are simply what you like.  I like a hearty soup with 'more' in it than some.  Either way I think the hot Italian sausage was the key to more flavor.

I have used this recipe several times. It is a huge hit with my family and with coworkers when I have brought it in. I typically make it as directed accept I use sausage from wild game instead of domestic meat. It is an excellent soup for a cloudy fall day.

This was sooooo good! My husband said it was delicious. I added a few more potatoes, some corn and baby carrots. I also didn't have oregano but used basil instead and it was still spectacular. Will definitely make it again. Lastly I used both hot sausages and sweet sausages. Thanks for the recipe!

I used soy milk and added cream which had been frozen at the end in fear of curdling. It tasted delicious even before I added it. Used mild Italian sausage. Added some zucchini. My toddler said it was too spicy (wasn't at all spicy to me), so I added nutritional yeast and yogurt which he said made it "not spicy," but he still didn't eat much. Yummy with bread. Hubby loved it.

This soup was a great way to use the abundant  kale from the farmer's market. I made the mistake of using Hot sausage,  and next time would dial it back to medium, or as the recipe stated, mild. I only used 2 cups of half-n-half, and the broth was still rich and tasty. Definitely a keeper!

Delicious. And I am no soup fan by any means.
I used Italian sausage and extra kale. I added my kale and milks at the end as suggested.
Next time I will try a healthier alternate to sausage. I made the recipe as is. And 3 people ate it all in a matter of two days

I followed the recipe except added extra kale.  it was very delicious.  next time I will substitute one cup of half and half for extra chicken broth as it was very rich.  All in all, loved it and we didn't have to go to the Olive Garden!!

I made this a few nights ago and it's a keeper. One major modification - I did NOT use the half and half and it turned our fine. I added a little more broth and used 2 percent milk and it was plenty creamy. With half and half, especially the amount called for in the recipe this would be a very heavy soup. Would also be off the charts for fat and calories. Try it with just the broth and milk, you won't be sorry. Next time I'll try it with turkey Italian sausage for a lighter meal.

Tonight I made this soup. What I changed was using white potatoes instead of russet; I used 3 hot and 3 sweet Italian sausages;  omitted the red pepper flakes;  and used a 12 oz bag of frozen kale. In an ode to Julia Child I added 1/4 cup of dry white wine with the broth.  Other than this, I followed the recipe exactly as directed, and it came out great!  The milk didn't scald, and the hot sausages added a nice kick.  I made sure to drain them very well, and blotted all the grease from my pot.  Next time I will use the fresh kale, as I think the texture will be heartier than the frozen kale.  But all the flavors are pure and amazing together. I can't wait to taste it tomorrow! Easy and straightforward soup... try it!

This soup was good, but I had to change a few things about it based on the other reviews. I boiled the potatoes first in a separate vat of water (boiling in milk will only cause the milk to curdle). Then, while that was happening, I sauteed the onion and added a clove of garlic for extra flavour. Then, in a separate pot, I boiled four cups of chicken broth, added the potatoes, garlic, onions and sausage, and set to a medium-heat. I slowly added four cups of skim milk (I replaced the four cups of half-and-half with two cups of milk and two cups of chicken broth) while stirring. I set that aside to slowly heat up. While that was happening, I made a roux out of 1/4 cup of milk, 1 tbsp of butter and 1 tbsp flour to add some thickness to the soup. Once that was done, I slowly added it to the main soup while constantly stirring until the entire mixture was thick. I finally added the oregano, pepper and a bit of salt to taste before adding the kale and simmering for an extra 10 minutes. Once it was done, I took it off the heat and added a few squirts of Sriracha for a spicy kick. It tasted a bit like sausage gumbo afterwards. A pretty good recipe once you make the appropriate changes!

Followed recipe as written, but used Kielbasa sausage instead of Italian. It was good, but think it would have been better if the soup was thicker. It reminded us of a watery clam chowder.

It was not bad, just very bland and heavy due to all of the half and half and milk. It needs something else included to add flavor.  This probably isn't a good recipe for those who are counting calories for obvious reasons. All in all - it was okay - would not make again.

Easy to make and very delicious, but next time I will put in 3 cups of kale rather than two.  Adding a topping of  shredded sharp cheddar cheese gave it the amount of saltiness it needed.  Really hit the spot.

Such a flavorful soup!  I prefer using ground pork sausage rather than the one in the casing.

Great, though I used a little more chicken broth and lot less cream and milk.  Used spinach instead of kale which I stirred in at the very end.

This was great,  except I added some carrots,  minced mushrooms and pimientos, cilantro,  salt, and garlic powder for extra flavor.  I found the soup to be too watery,  so I also added a little flour to thicken it up.  My daughter is a picky eater and she had every drop.  I would definitely make this again!

Best to add more kale - an entire bag of pre-washed kale . Not  baby kale, it's got to hold up. 

I made a non-meat version with vegetable broth, adding cayenne pepper to make up for the loss of the sausage.

I used Hot Turkey Italian Sausage, 3 cups of 2% milk and 2 cups of half and half and 3 cups of chicken broth.  Sauteed onions, garlic and sausage.  Added kale and broth and simmered 30 mins.  I added the dairy last as suggested and add seasoned to taste!  I had leftover cooked potatoes and added those last and simmered about 10 mins more. This was my first time making this soup and it turned out great!   I will definitely make again and again.  I'm hooked!

I didn,t have half n half, so I added 2tbs flour to sausage mix. Great combo of ingredients and good way to use kale, which frankly I don't, .uch care for, but it works beautifully in soup.

This soup had a very good flavor.  I might have preferred some salt and maybe garlic to give a little extra something, but overall the recipe was delicious.  I followed the advice of other reviewers: added extra kale and one pint of half & half and two cups 1% milk (all I had in the fridge) only at the end,  in the last ten minutes of cooking to heat through.  I might add a few more potatoes for a heartier soup next time, but I will definitely be making this soup again.

Used sweet Turkey sausage, half spit lengthwise and browned with extra red pepper flakes and ground black pepper.  Reduced half&half to 3 cups; used 3 cups of 2% milk (for a lower cal lower fat version), and full teaspoon crushed red pepper.  Full teaspoon of oregano and a sprinkling of Italian spice.  Used Yukon gold potatoes and fresh Kale from the garden 3 cups- might have used more Kale still.  I was very pleased with the result.  Still a rich soup but not overly so with a nice level of spice, a gentle warming heat while eating.  Pairs well with Chardonnay lightly chilled.

I thought it was a but too creamy for this kind of soup. I would have liked it to be more of a broth soup than a cream soup. I also thought it was pretty bland and ended up adding salt. It would have been good with some garlic. Overall it was ok but I have had better.

This was a bit too runny for my taste, it was like a kale cereal.  I added 5 cans of cream of mushroom soup to thicken enough to my satisfaction.

I made the soup with no changes.  Very delicious.  I will be making it again  since cold weather will be here soon.  My grandson loved it.  It is spicy so if you don't like heat you might want to cut down on the amount of red pepper flakes the recipe calls for.

Very flavorful. My family loved it. The only changes I would make is adding more potato and kale. I did increase the pepper flakes to 3/4 tsp as we do enjoy spice. Perfect fall soup!

Made this the other night and it was a hit. Needs a little more salt and pepper in my opinion. But you should definitely season it to your own taste.

This soup is REALLY good! I used hot Italian sausage because we like spicy food and it was amazing! I followed the recipe exactly and my only comment would be to maybe use a regular chicken broth next time instead of the low sodium because it did need a little salt. Other than that, perfect! I will definitely make this again!

Tasted great, but you may want to eliminate the red pepper flakes. That much makes it almost inedible.

I bought the hot sausage and it was very, very spicy! But other than that soup was delicious,  although it was spicy. Next time I am making sure that I buy the medium sausage so my kids can have some too! !!

This was great, pretty easy to make, too. I made adjustments based on what I had on hand, such as vegetarian Italian sausage, nf milk and canned coconut milk, fresh oregano. I added a little bit of carrots for more color and minced garlic. This dish had plenty of flavor.

Sauteed a carrot, onion and celery with a half pound of sausage. Added 4 cups of water and 2 tsp better than bullion cx. Added potatoes (~5 med) diced with skins to soup and let them get soft. Then added a bunch of kale, 1.5 cups frozen white beans and a cup of whole milk. Season with salt & pep. Delish.

This was an easy recipe and it was delicious!  I substituted siracha for the red pepper and added mushrooms  along with the kale.

Great flavor!  I add a bit more stock and then only 2-3 cups of half-n-half (no whole milk) plus one leek.  I brown the sausage and then put everything in the crock pot for 6 hours.  My family loves it!!

I make this in the crock pot.  I fry the sausage and simply add everything (including the kale) in the crock pot and put it on low for six to eight hours.  I love coming home to the aroma!

I  changed the sausage to  veggie sausage and added one cup nutritional yeast. This is the best soup ever. Easy to make and the picture is perfect.

This was a hit at our house!  My dh and my 23 month daughter loved it! She ate everything in the soup and usually she ignores the meat and greens but she ate the whole bowl by herself.  I added carrots, celery and garlic and used 2% milk.  I saut√©ed onion, carrots, celery, potato and garlic before adding in the broth.  I also added half and half and milk at the end.  I definitely making this again.  Thanks for the recipe.
