It's a really fast & easy soup.  Great.  I used marinara instead of tomato soup.

This recipe tasted find and had a nice touch with the chicken and the spaghetti.  I was torn about the broth and to me that made the soup kind of average.  I did not leave the table thinking that I needed to make it again.

I tried this recipe using canned spaghetti instead of the tomato soup and uncooked spaghetti.  I used frozen mixed vegetables to make it easier.  The kids loved it.

I make a soup very similar to this, however, I make mine with a beef base.  Instead of chicken & chicken broth, I use hamburger and beef broth.  I add potato, onion, celery & corn.  For seasoning, I add worchestershire sauce, salt, pepper, cajun seasoning & chopped garlic.  I use either tomato soup or V8 juice as the tomato base.  The spaghetti is a fun touch to the soup.  Simmer until the vegetables are tender and enjoy.

Hubby loved this soup, I thought it was very salty.  I used already cooked chicken so I cut down on half the oil.  Veggie soup has to have tomatoes so I used Rotel tomatoes with green chilies (undrained) and a can of tomato sauce for the tomato soup.  Very salty so next time I will use reduced salt products.  Be sure to break your spaghetti noodles small or you will slurp sauce all over your face. Will make again with maybe elbow noodles.

This was delish! It was like Mr. Campbell was in my kitchen! I used meatballs instead of chicken, and I added an extra can of tomato soup because I only made 4 servings. Great recipe!!

Tastes like canned vegetable soup. It takes a lot of prep time to prepare it. I'm sure it's healthy though and that's worth three stars.

This is pretty good, but not sure that the tomato soup is necessary.  Hubs said he would prefer it without the tomato soup, and I kind of agree.  I used tomato paste instead, but either way, we didn't think it needed it.  This used up some chicken I had in the fridge and was very quick and easy--exactly what I was looking for since hubs was hungry and I hadn't started dinner.  As other reviewers have mentioned, it's best to break up the spaghetti very small otherwise you'll end up with long spaghetti pieces to slurp.  Thanks for the recipe!

Since I cook all gluten free and organic.  I used the roasted tomato soup recipe to make the tomato part of this recipe. I also used gluten free pasta and it was awesome.  My entire family loved it. I will definetly make it again.  Of course I had left over tomato soup that we ate for another meal.  Goes great with grilled cheese!

I threw in a lot of extra pepper, Italian seasonings and sage.  I also added a little extra spaghetti sauce I had on hand and used orchetti pasta instead of spaghetti.  The family all liked it!

This was good, but it needed more flavor to make it great. I added two heaping teaspoons of an Italian spice mix I have. I also added more cerely and some corn.

I don't usually write reviews unless I think it's fabulous. My boyfriend said it deserved all five stars. It was delicious. I did not have all the garlic that it called for so I used a few dashes of garlic salt. It was just enough to make it yummy. I also added two extra cups of broth instead of the water.
