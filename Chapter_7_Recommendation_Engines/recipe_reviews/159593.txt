This is an AAWESOME recipe - so quick and easy to make and yet absolutely gourmet in taste!! I made two small changes to the recipe, out of necessity: had no capers on hand so substituted small quartered olives (rinsed and patted dry) and broiled the tuna rather than barbecuing it.

The flavour was absolutely delicious - the fresh parsley/grapes was so fresh tasting.

The olives worked really well as a substitute (although I am looking forward to trying it again with the capers).

(One word of caution - be careful not to overcook the tuna as it dries out)

Thanks Drew for a wonderful recipe!!

Delicious summer recipe. The salsa is fantastic with the lightly marinated tuna steak done medium or medium rare. Highly recommended with steamed veggies and a chilled glass of riesling.

Excellent! - surprising and unique flavor combo.  Even 2-3 minutes per side was a bit too much if you want it medium rare - depends on how thick your fish is.  Thanks for submitting this creative recipe.

I really loved this combination of grapes and capers. It was the first time I prepared tuna steaks and I was afraid of undercooking. I will follow recipe /cooking time exactly next time. They were still delicious. My husband and son liked the meal, not as much as I did but they are hard to please so I considered this a success. We will have this again. I will also use the caper/grape combination on salmon which I prepare often.

Must admit that I was a little concerned about the combination of grapes and capers.  However, we were very pleasantly surprised.  The sweet and briny flavors come together very nicely.  The only thing I would do different is quarter the grapes instead of halving them next time.

What a fantastic summer dish. I really liked the combo of the grapes, shallots and capers: alternatively sweet, salty and sharp. This recipe is really about the salsa, because it could be just as easily used on salmon, swordfish, chicken, maybe even pork. I look forward to introducing this simple recipe to friends and family.

Yum Yum! This is the first time I've worked with tuna steaks and like others I overcooked em a bit but this was still really good. I loved the salsa, I kept eating it by itself. I served it alongside some grilled cheesy polenta, the combo was awesome!

Wonderful! The only thing I would change is to quarter the grapes instead of halving and maybe a few less capers. Very interesting and nice flavor combo esp on a hot night in FL. (I don't have a grill so I seared the tuna med rare in a hot pan with some olive oil. Used a pinch of smoked salt on the tuna to compensate.)

wow! this is a keeper.  I followed the recipe faithfully and I'm glad I did.  Important to half the grapes, otherwise kinda hard to eat whole grapes using fork.  I grilled our tuna, but I can see using any kind of white fish, either grilled or pan fried.  EXCELLENT!!!!

I only checked this recipe originally due to the strange sounding ingredients, but the reviews convinced me to try it.  I subbed green grapes for red, and a little onion/garlic for the shallot.  I pan seared the tuna and served with quinoa.  Yummy

I wasn't a big fan on the tuna, but the salsa was better than I expected.  Maybe the tuna I had wasn't a good enough quality? Just was kind of blah for me.

What a great recipe! I was a little nervous about the salsa just because I thought it was an odd combination, but it was delicious! Thank you so much!

This is a very simple and tasty recipe. My husband, who thinks fruit is only for dessert, liked it a lot and requested again. It is very light and will become a regular recipe in our house.

I gave this one 4-stars because I adapted it slightly. I used 1 green onion (green & white part) in lieu of the shallot and instead of olive oil I used about 2 T (maybe less) of RF sour cream to bind it. I made sure to make it ahead of time to allow the flavors to set. I served it over grilled chicken and it was absolutely delicious!!

I was VERY pleased with this recipe.  It was flavorful, quick, and easy.  I even had to cook my steaks on the stove top because we were out of propane and they were still fabulous.

Excellent!  I couldn't find tuna steaks, so against my better judgement, I used frozen cod.  Believe it or not, it was just as excellent!  So worried about the combination of grapes and capers, but it really works!  Will make again.

I used finally diced green onion instead of the scallion. Everyone looked at me like I was crazy but they scrapped the bottom of the bowl. The flavors went very well together. I would make this again

Edit: I served it with Salmon a couple of days ago. Just as good but better with the Tuna.

DELICIOUS!!!  Only suggestion is to quarter the grapes rather than halve.  They are still a bit large when only halved.

I made this for dinner tonight and my husband and I both loved it.  The grape and caper salsa was fantastic.  Very fresh, unique, and pretty.  An adventure for the taste buds. I highly recommend this recipe!

This recipe was SO EASY.  It was also really yummy.  I broiled the tuna steaks---careful not to overcook them.  The next time I make the recipe (i will definitely make this again), I will make the salsa and let it sit for a little while so all the flavors can mix.  This is a great come home from work tired meal.  YUM.

Great if having people over.  Simple and tasty.  I added some lemon juice in there, as well as a bit of honey if the raisins aren't sweet enough.

This was fantastic. I had to make a couple of substitutions with the salsa. Didn't have fresh parsley, so I used fresh celery leaf mixed with dried parsley, also didn't have a shallot, so used a Texas Sweet  onion. I did not rinse the capers, loved that extra little salt, and added a dash of apple balsamic vinegar. 

Really complemented the Tuna steaks well!

I did not have capers or parsley, so I used stuffed Manzanilla olives and thinly sliced celery that was then chopped.  Fantastic flavor as the olives offered a similar flavor to the capers, while the celery was the ideal fresh counterpart to the parsley.

Incredible dish that is so easy to make. I accidentally bought green grapes and the salsa still came out very aromatic. If you prefer more rare variety of tuna, keep the steaks on the grill or stove to 1 1/2 minute or less on each side. Thanks for the great recipe!

It was a new taste for me.  I loved the sweet from the grapes and the salty from the capers.  Have shared this one with friends.

Very good!  I had to cook slightly longer because i didn't have high grade tuna, but still turned out tasty!

The grapes I had were fairly acidic so I brushed the tuna with white wine instead, and sprinkled with salt and pepper. I did not add salt to the grape salsa since the capers are salty, even when rinsed. Came out really yummy and flavorful!!

It was tasty but was looking for a tangier flavor. I used green seedless grapes so that may have been the issue. I will make it again but cut the grapes even smaller- I quartered based on previous reviews.
