I made this for Easter.  It disappeared faster than any trifle I've ever made.  I used sliced almonds in place of pecans (allergies) and sweetened, whipped cream in place of frozen whipped topping (personal preference) and three-fourths of the yellow cake instead of half (it needed more substance for all the fluff).  It was delicious!!

This is very good.  Made it for work and everyone really liked it.  I only changed one thing.  I added the whole 8 oz of cool whip to the pudding mix instead of just 4 oz.  It will cut down on the sweetness.  This is really good.  Thank you for the recipe.

This was a very good dessert.  My family loved it.  It is very rich and I think it could do without all the hot fudge.  It seemed to over power the whole dish.  I would cut it in half next time or maybe only put it on top

REALLY good!! Made this for a party I hosted, and the ladies loved it!(most of us had seconds - some took bowls home for their husbands.) I used 1 1/2 pkgs of pudding (hence, increased the amt of milk, crm cheese and whipped topping,) and also added carmel topping along with the fudge - I was surprised how much I loved it, since it didn't call for chocolate cake - that might have actually been too much chocolate(if there is such a thing!)

Delicious!!  Excellent dessert - very much like a banana split in a trifle bowl, and easy to prepare.  Could only find white choc. sugar free/fat free pudding - may want to substitute vanilla or banana - but very beautiful dessert, and everyone will be impressed!!  Excellent!

What a mess!  It looked like a 5 year old had thrown every single sweet thing they could find in a bowl.  It was too sweet.

I made this for a family gathering.  It was like a big mess in a bowl and is REALLY rich (and I have a big sweet tooth).  My brother-in-law was the only one who wanted to take it home.  I don't think I'd make it again...

This was so easy to throw together and good to eat as well. I used a little more then half the cake but this was a crowd pleaser. None was left at the end of the party.

Awesome trifle!!  Makes a ton, so make sure you use a big bowl!  Different from all the chocolate trifles I have, and yet has enough chocolate to not leave you missing it!  Yummy...family loved it!

This was great. It tastes like a banana split.  The only thing I did different was use a can of strawberry pie filling instead of cherry.  Really good.

So good!  I attempted to whittle away some fat and calories by subbing oil for applesauce in the cake, ff Cool Whip, low fat cream cheese, and no sugar added cherry pie filling.  It turned out wonderfully!
