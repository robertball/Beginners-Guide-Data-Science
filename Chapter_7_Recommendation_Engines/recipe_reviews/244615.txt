This Cole slaw is going to be one I make again and again!  I used an 8 oz. can of crushed pineapple,  because I wanted to try a smaller amount of pineapple in case we didn't like it,  but other than that it was exact.  Very good!  We ate it immediately and loved it,  but I imagine it will taste even better tomorrow,  if possible!  Thanks for a great recipe!

The dressing on this is excellent.  However the amount of cabbage is off.  I used a 10 ounce package of cole slaw and that could easily be doubled.  I couldn't find a 15 oz can of crushed pineapple so I used part of a 20 oz can.  Great flavor, but plan on using a lot more cabbage next time.  Thanks for a delightful recipe.

Having been raised in Hawaii it was always a given that pineapple went into the Cole slaw, either crushed or tidbits, I use tidbits. Slaw without pine apple always seems like its missing something.

the pineapple and stopped when I got to half because it looked right. I also added only half the dressing. It was really delicious! I put it on top of my Kalua Pig in a Slow Cooker pork sandwich. Definitely a delicious coleslaw!

Loved it!  I was looking for something different and this was the perfect recipe.   Never ever thought about putting pineapple in coleslaw but it really worked.   Thank you so much for this unique dish!

I used a 14-oz bag of coleslaw--I have never seen an 8.5-oz bag in the stores here in the Twin Cities.  I can't recall now (I made it a few days ago) if I then doubled all the other ingredients (since the amount of coleslaw was nearly double).  I didn't have cilantro so used dried parsley.  Taste was pretty good.  I would likely make this again.

Excellent coleslaw! Just the right amount of tangy and savory. I didn't have apple cider vinegar so I just used regular white vinegar--still excellent!

I doubled the dressing and added lemon juice. I used red onion. I also used fresh cilantro instead of dried. I will definitely be making this for bbq parties this summer. It adds something light and refreshing to all the heavy meats at a bbq.
PS...I never liked cole slaw until now.

I've made this a few times now, both with and without the pineapple, and each time it was excellent. I used a 16-oz bag of coleslaw mix because after it sits for a few hours it can get a little soupy when you only use 8-oz. I also omitted the onion (I don't like raw onion) and it still came out great. My favorite way to serve it is piled on top of a pulled pork taco. Delicious and easy! This is definitely a recipe I'll keep around.

An interesting slaw recipe indeed! It is tangy and acidic while having a backnote of pineapple sweetness. I admittedly only used half the pineapple and thought that was an appropriate amount. My only issue was that I poured the liquid onto the slaw without realizing it was too much. So be careful to not use all the sauce unless you like it soupy.

I didn't like it.  It wasn't sweet enough for me.  Perhaps if I would have bought the pineapple in heavy syrup it would have been better.  I also thought there was too much onion.  I made the recipe exactly as written.  It has lots of great reviews,  I just didn't care for it.

Wonderful coleslaw!  All I did different was use the 10 oz bag of coleslaw mix, the higher ratio worked out perfect with the sauce.

This is probably the only recipe from the site that I made exactly as listed.  I actually had all the ingredients!  It was super easy and really good.  I think I will use this when I need a potluck dish.

I would rate 3.5 stars.  The ratios seem a bit skewed. Used the 1 pound bag of chopped cabbage. Seemed like a high pineapple to cabbage ratio.  The dressing part easily covered the cabbage mixture despite using the 1 pound bag of chopped cabbage. Followed the rest of the recipe.  I think the flavors would really pop if you used fresh cilantro instead of dried.  But all in all, it is a good recipe that worked really well with baby back ribs and a Riesling.

I added some modifications
1 tsp finely chopped dill and Chives
used fresh cilantro
thinly sliced sweet onion
used cane sugar instead of brown
1/2 avacado blended with the mayo 
used the inside of celery with the leaves.

It turned out really good..  Great combination.

Good enough to serve to guests. I thought the marinade was not quite enough. Perhaps doubling the dressing would be a good idea.

Shredded my own cabbage and added shredded carrots, rather than using the the cole slaw mix, as that is what I had on hand.  Very good!  Will definitely make this again!

I used crushed pineapple, which has the consistency of applesauce. No flavor or texture. Also added a bit of garlic powder. Take heed of other comments, all true.

The flavor of this is amazing! My daughter and I do not like slaw but the rest of my family does so I decided to give this a try. She and I both ended up loving it! We didn’t want too much pineapple or dressing so used a 14 ounce bag of slaw mix and we used pineapples in heavy syrup.  (I appreciate the suggestions from other reviews!) She suggested using curry and cumin in place of the oregano and it worked well. Next time we will use oregano because I have to try this again!

Made this with two heads of cabbage. One white and one red. Didn't have the pineapple chunks, but successfully added craisins. This was so delicious. The family loved it. Gave some to new friends and they were also delighted. Great recipe.

I made this recipe for a Luau party I was having. We served it to go with Kalua Pork sliders on sweet rolls.  It was quite tasty.  Just make sure to not have too much dressing on it or it gets soggy.  I also put a little less pineapple in it than it called for.

This was delicious! I followed the recipe completely. Only dropping off onions because I cannot stand raw onions!  Other than that delete this is super good. Can't wait to share at the picnic!

This was really tasty. I like the pineapple in it a lot.  The only change I will do next time is add less liquid. It was a little soggy for the hubbys taste??
Thank you??

I followed the dressing exactly, but we're snowed in so the fresh veggies were subbed with what's on hand. Shredded cabbage, pineapple tidbits cut in half, red onions and a little green pepper was called into play. I've never had pineapple in cole slaw before, but it's wonderful. Thank you so much for sharing the love.

Light and refreshing. Easy to make. I used fresh pineapple instead of canned and simply eliminated the cilantro as I did not have it on hand. I think it may have added another dimension to the recipe, though. I also found that we need to add an extra 2 heaping tablespoons to the mix as the 1/2 cup did not seem to coat the coleslaw enough. I would make again this time with the cilantro.

2 of us liked it.  I didn't.  It was too tangy and too oniony.  The pineapple wasn't very noticeable.  I won't be making this again.

Made it but they only had a 14 oz bag of slaw mix. So I added small can of can milk to make more juice. My Mom always put can milk and sugar in her slaw so it was great!

I served this with the slow cooker Kalua pork from this site. I've made it twice already, nice complement. It's important to drain the pineapple well, or it will be too "wet". Next time I will use an 8 oz can of tidbits, rather than crushed.

My family loved this!  I wasn't sure about the pineapple but it was great, makes this a unique and delicious cole slaw. It will be the only recipe I use from now on. I didn't add the cilantro as I didn't have any on hand but I don't think it's really needed.

Ridiculously simple and awesome. My wife hates cole slaw and she even liked it. I made a double batch and they ate it all!

Not bad! A little vinegary for me but still pretty darn good with BBQ.

This recipe was good...just too much onion for our taste. The pineapple gave it a nice flavor.

This was a very simple and tasty slaw. The only changes I made: I used a 10oz package of coleslaw mix and parsley instead of cilantro (didn't have any and don't care for it). My can of crushed pineapple was 20oz so I did not use all of it, next time I definitely will. I may even switch to tidbits instead of crushed. The pineapple flavor was very subtle. But, very simple ingredients and a great side dish with our pulled pork and homemade mac and cheese ( used Chef John's recipe on this site). I disagree with other reviews that they did not think it was enough marinade/sauce. I thought it was plenty and may even do a touch less next time. I prefer more cabbage than sauce with my coleslaw.

I added a 1/4 tsp of mustard,used red onion, omitted cilantro,  since I didn't have dried, and used a 16 oz. bag of slaw .
Wonderful, and plenty of dressing for my need.

Wanted a slaw that would go well with seared Ahi.  A perfect match.

I had to use a 10 once bag because that's the only bag the stores carry.  Nothing else was changed, and I will definitely make this again for my work snack day.  Brought to a graduation party and someone brought rice with burnt green peppers and I use the slaw dressing to cover up the nasty taste.

I used fresh pineapple and half green onion, half red onion, to use what I had on hand. I followed the recipe otherwise. Delicious!

Yummy! :) I love the idea of adding pineapple to boring ol' coleslaw. It is tangy and sweet and fruity! I am going to make some steaks on the grill, and a baked potato, and BAM dinner is served. Thanks for a great accompaniment. I will try this recipe on my inlaws when they come over. :)

Love Love Loved it!  My supermarket does not carry 150z cans of pineapple so I purchased the 20oz and just added more cole slaw mix and served it with pulled pork sandwiches, absolutely delicious. Will certainly be making again. Thanks for recipe!!
