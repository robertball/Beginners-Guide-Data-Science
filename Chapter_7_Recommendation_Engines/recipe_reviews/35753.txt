(Original review, Jan, 2006)My review is 5 stars for the sauce, which I made exactly as written minus the liquid smoke, which I didn't have and generally don't like.  I used Jameson's Irish Whiskey.  This sauce is awesome! We'll use it again and again.  I used the sauce on the ribs I cooked following the Prize Winning Baby Back ribs recipe on this site.  I followed those cooking instructions and used the dry rub from that recipe, as well. I used this sauce at the end where it calls for using your "favorite bbq sauce."  Hands-down, this is our favorite sauce recipe.  Can't wait to try it on my husband's grilled whole chicken breasts!
Update 2/4/07 *Superbowl*  This is *still* our favorite sauce. I always double the recipe. One new tip: I use a mini food processor to mince the onions, but you still get small pieces in the sauce. It's great that way, but this time, after fully cooking the sauce, I let it cool and blended it in a regular blender.  Awesome smooth texture, terrific flavor! Now we have two options for this wonderful recipe!

THESE WERE AMAZING!!!! I goofed up.. I didn't have any whisky so I just omitted that, I found out at the last min that I didn't have any tomato paste so I used ketchup instead.. since ketchup is not as thick as tomato paste I used less water, 1 cup. I also used a real onion, 2 garlic cloves & chili powder instead of chile pepper since I always have that on hand. Other than that everything else I did exactly to the recipe. I also had to cook the sauce alittle longer since it started out watery but I'm telling you it turned out PERFECT! I was surprised at how easy these were to make, the prep was not that hard or that long, than I just let everything cook for 2 hours while I cleaned. When ready I gave everything to hubby to grill. He just had to grill the ribs for about 10 mins, he used half the sauce for coating the ribs while grilling & when they were done cooking he used the rest of the sauce to put on the ribs so they are very sticky & dripping w/ sauce. This was the first time I've ever made ribs and they were INCREDIBLE! ****UPDATE**** I make this every few weeks now. I use boneless pork ribs b/c you get more meat, I double the recipe for extra sauce & I did try to make it exactly how it's written & it's also incredible that way but since I don't normally have whisky or tomato paste I stick to the way I made it the first time. I show off & make this for company & so far EVERYONE is Blown away by these ribs. I've given out this recipe a number of times! Thanks Scott!

Finger-linkin' delicious. I cut back on the red chile peppers since I'm a wimp and it was still pretty spicy. I substituted real onions and garlic instead of the powder and used kosher salt instead of table salt. I also doubled the recipe but next time I will use less water so it doesn't take so long to reduce. Instead of grilling, I added sauce to ribs after 2 hours and backed in oven for another half hour. My husband said this recipe beat all others hands down...and he's the chef in the family

This is one of the best sauces I have ever made.  To anyone who knows ribs, this is one of the best barbeque recipes you can get, hands down.

Sure this recipe takes a while, but it is perfect for a Saturday afternoon cooking while being outside in my garden.  The sauce is excellent and I did use 1/4cup of Whisky and added 10 cloves of crushed garlic, we love garlic!  We have used this on chicken and pork also, remember this sauce freezes well.  Very impressive recipe.

These were the BEST ribs I have ever made.  The sauce was very tasty, although it took much longer than 1 1/4 hours to reduce.  Great recipe, and one that I will make again.

The zippy taste was refreshingly different than that overly sweet and sticky chain restaurant taste everyone assumes baby back ribs should be! Rib meat fell off the bone with every bite. A big hit at the Labor Day BBQ!

Outstanding!  This was my first attempt at making both ribs and barbecue sauce.  They were both terrific.  I cut the liquid smoke down to 1/4 tsp.  The amount called for did seem like way too much.  I will use this sauce (maybe a little less sweet) on other grilled meats.  Thank you, Scott, for an easy and spectacular recipe.

These were great. I didn't put in any liquid smoke because I didn't have any on hand. Next time I make these I'll add it to see how great the difference is.

This recipe is amazing! We had some ribs to use up and I almost just used store-bought BBQ sauce because I didn't think I could beat it, but BOY was I wrong. Hands down the best BBQ sauce I've ever tasted. I will used this sauce for chicken, beef, pork - whatever! The meat just fell of the bone. It's winter in Iowa, so I just baked in the oven instead of grilling for the last part of it, at 400 degrees for 15 minutes, uncovered. Delish!

After reading your recipe, and the comments of others,  being a professional chef I just had to try this out myself.  Scott Hibb  it was made to the letter as per your instruction.  I used everything on your list.    Very happy with the outcome you impressed me, congrats.  Just a note to all +++++++++++  No matter what meat you place in an oven at 300F for 2 hrs or 3 hrs the meat will fall off the bone.  It may be cut using two spoons thats how tender your meat will be.  Well done Scott.,.,.,Bravo from a professional chef serving in one of Montreal's largest hotels.

Very tasty BBQ sauce!  I tried something different with the ribs...  After an hour and a half I took the ribs out of the oven and let them cool for 5 min.  I then smeared about a tsp of honey on each half rack.  Then I returned them to the oven for the last hour in a baking pan filled half way with warm apple juice (a couple cups), and covered with aluminum foil.  This made the ribs so tender and moist!  (I still grilled them after taking them out of the oven.)

Artificially flavoring with liquid smoke is never a good idea.  I won't make these again.

Holy Cow these were amazingly good! My wife saw the recipe and requested I go half on the ground red chili pepper and it's a good thing too because it was still quite spicy. Is cayenne the same as ground red? That may be where the problem was, I'm not sure. Also on the rub before baking instead of more pepper, black and red I used Snider's Barb-B-Que spice to make the wife happy. We got a large pack of back ribs from Costco and even without the sauce, just the Snider's they were unbelievable but the sauce is the bomb. After applying on the grill at the end and dipping directly while eating the sauce didn't seem as spicy so everything worked out perfectly. I made a triple batch of the sauce since we had 7 lbs. of ribs instead of 2 and actually a single batch would have been enough even for 7 lbs, maybe a double for those who like to dip more while eating. I've been looking for a good sauce I can call my own for a long time and this is it. I can't wait to try it on some pulled pork shoulder. So my only advise is watch the red pepper, you can always add more while it's reducing. Allow more time also. The triple batch was simmering for 3 hours to get get it the right thickness. These were easily better than any ribs I have ever had, including the famous restaurants known for ribs.

Made this recipe for the Superbowl and was very impressed with it. Used apple cider vinager instead of white vinager. Don't have a grill so we opened the foil and cooked for 30 minutes longer basting three times. Then broiled for 5 minutes to give it a nice caramelization and it added a nice sticky glaze to the ribs.

to the person who asked how long the sauce will keep in the fridge...I make a double batch and freeze the rest.  I use a mason jar with plastic wrap and a rubber band (to allow for expansion).  When the sauce is frozen, replace the plastic with the metal jar lid.  To use it, take it out of the freezer and leave it in the 'fridge over night, or microwave for 2 minutes at at time (stirring between each nuke) till warm. I even use it and refreeze it several times. HTH

Ok, this recipe has alot of ingredients. BUT they work, and work well. As Guy Fieri would say, "this stuff is money". It is that good. It's also all the stuff you already have in your kitchen. One word of caution..you cannot walk away from this and let it simmer on the stove for an hour plus. It will burn. I had to stir constantly. Well, like every 15 mins. Everybody cooks their ribs differently. That I find, is a personal thing. However you make your ribs (and this works) the sauce is fabulous. Better than Famous Dave's. p.s. I went VERY light on the liquid smoke. (had a bad experience with that once. Not a fan of the "house on fire" smell. Update: I tripled this recipe for 20 lbs of pork butt in the slow cooker for pulled pork. Just enough. Makes about 8 cups.

WOWZA!!!! Everyone loved it. I made this tonight for our friends, and they absolutely loved it. It was delicious, but I think next time I may cut down on the brown sugar. It's a tiny bit on the sweet side for me. Liquid smoke adds an extra dimension to the taste...Don't skip it! Only change up was that I use apple cider vinegar instead of white.  In hind sight, I'd mince up the onion even more so it will be a "smoother" sauce. All in all this is a keeper recipe. I will definitely make my ribs like this from now on. OH...I did double the recipe. I believe it's a must when you like to have extra dipping sauce.  Our guests wanted to know the recipe...I just told them they had to come back again ;o)

Made it tonight for Super Bowl..ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! Followed recipe exactly! I recommend doubling if you want extra to pour on/dip after grilling which I did. I have tried many recipes on here and have yet been impressed enough to leave a review! Hats off to You Scott..Thanks so much for sharing :)

We made these for the Super Bowl and thought they were delicious. The sauce is time consuming, but not hard to make, and it's totally worth it. The meat came out so tender and just fell off the bone. I might cut back on the red chile pepper a little bit next time, but other than that, we thought it was perfect. Thanks for the recipe. We had never made ribs before, but now we'll make them again and again. They were delicious and tender.

Update: We made the ribs again this year and left out the red chile pepper entirely - they were amazing.

These have been awesome from the first time we made them. However, this weekend, I came across a small change to the sauce that made it EVEN BETTER: if you substitute apple cider vinegar for the white vinegar in the sauce, it really makes the flavor better. The best kind of apple cider vinegar to use is the all organic kind that has "the mother" in it. Its very healthy and makes the sauce even better.

This recipe will not disappoint, I have been slow cooking my babybacks like this for years but the secret is in the sauce which was perfect. Just a note, I am not one to make changes and then knock a recipe but on this I did not have any Whisky so used Captain Morgan Rum instead still turned out great. Thank You

I guess I'll just add my five star review to the other 608.  I added more whisky than called for; just because I had a whole bottle and 2 teaspoons didn't seem like very much and my ground red pepper was rancid, so I squirted in some rooster sauce instead.  Also it turned out that we didn't have any charcoal, so I had to finish them in the oven.  I turned the oven up to 425, slathered on the sauce and cooked the ribs until the sauce turned dark and tacky.  Even with all the mishaps, these were the best ribs I've ever made.  We were using our fingers to scrape up the burnt bits of sauce on the bottom of the pan.  I made these for my husband's 51st birthday, and he wants me to never use another recipe.  Thanks so much Scott!

These were FANTASTIC. I made these for my South African boyfriend's family, and let me tell you - they KNOW their barbeque. They all RAVED about these. They are amazingly tender - they fall right off the bone. The sauce was fantastic. The only change I made was substituting chili powder for ground red chile pepper, because that's all I had on hand. These are going straight into the regular rotation. My boyfriend said he didn't know if he'd ever make ribs another way again, which speaks volumes as to just how good these were.

I made the sauce last night and plan to make the ribs today.  I simmered the sauce for HOURS to reduce.  It still seems rather thin.  What should the consistency be compared to a store-bought sauce??????

Excellent recipe!  I questioned whether it was too long to simmer the sauce, but it came out perfectly!  I did follow the recipe completely and it is a keeper.

These were delicious! The sauce made enough for 8 lbs of ribs from Costco.  I did not make any changes at all!  3 adults and 2 preteens devoured this, served with garlic bread and salad.  Thank you so much for the recipe.  I will use this sauce for chicken as well in the future.

Absolutely Perfect! This was my first time making ribs, and this recipe helped me get through the first time with confidence. I even had my cousins over for dinner, and we all loved them. We are all from Kansas City, so we are picky about our BarBQue and these definitely passed the test. Thank you so much!

I have made this recipe numerous times and LOVE it! Everyone I've served it to raves about how these are the best ribs they've ever had. We always check the meat counter for sales on pork ribs and buy them and freeze them until we are ready to make them.  I will never use another rib recipe again!!!  Sometimes I rush this a bit and cook the meat faster by increasing the temp. of the oven.  It works fine and the ribs still taste great, but the secret truely lies in SLOW COOKING TIME! the longer you can cook the meat the juicier and more tender they will be. They will fall off the bone!   If you don't have a grill or it's winter time, you can finish them off under the broiler in your oven.

Wow!  First, the sauce.  I  made it up the night before, following the recipe exactly.  To be honest, I didn't like the way it smelled at all, but figured all those 5 stars ratings couldn't be wrong.  I kept the faith.  Next, the ribs.  One tip, put something down in the bottom of your oven to catch drips.  They made a mess, even though I folded the foil and placed the ribs with the seal facing up.  Oh, well no big deal.  Then, the transfer from the oven to the grill.  This was a little tricky as the meat just kept falling off the bones!  We decided to grill them on foil, because if we hadn't, all the meat would have fallen into the fire.  We used no stick foil, but we still had some "stickage."  They were still quite juicy and generated a lot of smoke as their juices drained into the fire.  Finally, we got them on the table to eat and...WOW!  Amazing and worth every bit of the mess.  Before we tasted them my husband was pretty annoyed with the mess on the grill.  After one bite, though, he decided the mess wasn't really all that bad.  Kind of like how you forget labor pains when you first hold that precious baby!    Excellent recipe with just the right amount of "bite."  If you do not like spicy food, cut back the red pepper a little.

These were the best ribs that I have ever had!  I will not be ordering from a restaurant again.  I only used 1/2 the amount of red chile for the sauce and it still was a little too hot for the kids.

My rib meat literally fell off the bone tender, flavor was awesome! Seagrams 7 was my whiskey of choice. I did cut back on the amount of red pepper a bit, but still enough for the mouth watering kick you get with this recipe! This is awesome served with some cold brew! Thanks for sharing a recipe that totally rocks!

I can't believe that I haven't reviewed this before because cook my ribs using this method quite often.  It is foolproof as far as getting fall of the bone ribs.  It deserves a 5 for falling off the bone and the sauce is delicious.  I, like a few other reviewers, often use the rub from "Prize Winning Baby Back Ribs" on this site rather than using the red chili pepper.  Thank you submitter.

We smoked two racks of spareribs for three hours, brought them in and put in oven for an hour or so. During that time I kept basting with sauce, which I might add is out of this world.  When I read the recipe for my shopping list I thought it said to use tomato sauce instead of the paste, so when I was making it I noticed my mistake so ended up putting in one small can of sauce and some catsup..it did not hurt it at all. The old man took some to his friend and he had a fit over the sauce, wanted to know where we bought it..lol..think I might make him a jar full for Christmas.  The sauce was really good, we are funny about our sauce and this passed the test. I think it would be good on some chicken or even an old flip flop. Thanks for sharing!!

The best ribs I have ever eaten! Even the restraunt chains can't compete with this recipe! I did leave out the liquid smoke and sprinkled the ribs with Hickory Smoke Salt instead. Tender and tasty! This is it!

This is the recipe that got me hooked on allrecipes.com!  I did a web search in 2008 and found this recipe; it was soo good that I still use it regularly today.  For the ribs, I use any rub I have on hand. The BBQ sauce is heavenly!  BBQ sauce lovers such as my family, it’s amazing just how good homemade can be!  Whenever we have a big BBQ I triple the BBQ sauce recipe and let it cook for 5-6 hours. It cooks down to a gloppy paste but oh my is it good.  In the winter when ribs are on sale (like tonight,) I will cook them in the oven as stated, then peel the foil back and broil for 3-4 min, baste some BBQ sauce on and put it in for 1-2 more min. Let the meat rest and you will be in love! Only recommendation is do not cut back on the fresh onions, your sauce will become too acidic, but if you have baking soda on hand just add a teaspoon, let it bubble, stir and you’ll be fine. Enjoy!

These were wonderful! The sauce was not too sweet and the ribs were juicy and fall off the bone tender! I did only two things differently (which may not have improved the recipe but is just how I've learned to prepare ribs). First I removed the thin membrane from the inner side of the ribs, then I added about 2T of water (mixed w/xtra dry rub) to each of the foil packs before baking to be sure they stayed nice and moist. Excellent sauce prepared exactly as written. Will be making again and again! Thanks for the recipe!!

There is a reason this recipe has a 5-star rating after 600+ reviews.  The ribs are just that good!!  I made as written and won't change a thing the next time I make them.  The sauce is truly wonderful.  Thanks Scott for sharing your delicious recipe.

Fantastic! This was my third try at ribs (the other two times they weren't tender enough) and they were wonderful!  I bought regular spare ribs because they were cheaper than baby back ribs. I used tomato paste seasoned with Italian herbs since that is what I had on hand, and I slathered the ribs with a pork dry rub prior to putting the ribs in the oven.

These were absolutely wonderful. The ribs were tender and flavorful, and  sauce was delicious and worth the time and effort.  My family couldn't say enough about them, and my husband said they were as good as the ribs sold by the barbecue man who 
cooks in a huge smoker grill! This recipe is a DEFINITE keeper!!

The only change was subbing the half cup of water with whiskey and using regular, hot chili powder. Everything else was used and it cooked as per the recipe. BEST RIBS EVER. Literally falls off the bone. I did it all in the oven; for the last half hour I removed the ribs from the foil (drizzling their juices all over them) and coated them with sauce then back in the oven for the remainder of the time. The only thing that slightly disappointed me was the lack of whiskey flavour, even after using much more of it (I used Irish whiskey, Jameson to be exact). I liked the sauce, but expected a little more. Will continue to use this method with a different sauce.

I have been meaning to write this review for a while but just now getting around to it. It's AWESOME! I fixed this for my husband who never brags about anything I fix. Everything is just okay. Well about 3 weeks after I fixed this recipe, he says to me, "Ya know the best thing you have cooked lately were those ribs, they were awesome!" I couldn't believe he waited that long to say anything about it! But if he didn't absolutely love them, he would have never said anything at all! It's terrific!

I've made these a few times and they have become our favorite rib recipe. It's the sauce that makes it.

Perfection! I made these exactly as directed (except that I tend to eyeball the spices and adjust flavor to my family's taste) I will never do ribs any other way again.

WOW!  Very good. A little (not much)too sweet, next time I will reduce the brown sugar a little and add a pinch of cyane pepper.  Other than that GREAT!

I posted my scratch-made recipe almost 2 decades ago. Thank you all for your ratings and comments! Allrecipes.com deleted my account many years ago when they started trying to charge for membership, so I can’t login to update the recipe, as there are a few things I have changed with it. Oh well, but thanks again for the positive comments!

We're from Kansas City, home of the best bbq, so I feel qualified to tell you that this recipe makes great sauce and slow cooking the ribs ensures fall-off-the-bone meaty goodness!

I use this recipe for the sauce only really.  I really like Lloyd Rushing "Simple BBQ Ribs" boiling method to prep the ribs.  It adds nice flavor and can be done a day ahead.   You also don't have to pay to much attention to ribs simmering on the stove so you can do other things while they are cooking.   This is a very good sauce. I do put in the liquid smoke even though many shy away from it.  I think it adds a nice flavor touch.  Make some extra and put in a jar in the frig for a week or so, goes great with chicken too.

These baby back ribs were AMAZING! Mr. Hibb - you have changed my life. Sounds drastic, but the man I am dating was so impressed with my cooking that he is now bragging about my cooking skills everywhere he goes. Just so you know, he has since introduced me to his whole family and they can't wait to try the amazing ribs i made for their son and children. The funny thing about it is that they don't eat pork, but my boyfriend made the exception since they knew how excited I was about trying the recipe on them. Ha, Ha! Now his family wants some... Thank you!

The only thing I did differently was that rather than using salt, pepper and cayenne on the ribs while baking was to use a commercial sweet & smoky rub on them.  Everything else we did per the recipe.  I made 15 pounds worth of ribs for a family gathering and everyone raved about how good they were.

Followed another suggestion for prize winning baby backs for the seasoning rub, these were absolutely amazing! Got raves about the sauce and requests for the recipe and the meat was the most tender, fall-off-the-bone meat I've ever had! Only thing I did different was added minced garlic to the onions while they sauteed and omitted the chile pepper bcuz some of my guests cannot have spice, it ended up with the perfect balance of heat regardless. I was told these ribs were equal to, if not better than, restaurant quality ribs. Thanks Scott!

Yummy!  I have made these twice.   First time with this exact recipe and the second time I used rib rub.   I prefer the extra flavor the rib rub adds, but both are delicious!   This sauce is absolutely wonderful!!!

I used this receipe for the first time I ever cooked ribs.  For some reason I thought cooking ribs was difficult.  Not with this one.  Super easy, and the meat just falls off the bone.  The majority of the work in this receipe falls on the making of the sauce.  I did this the first time.  On the plus side the house smells wonderful while making it, but in the long run there are so many great sauces on the store shelves I just think it's easier to go that route.  BUT, I have followed the receipe exactly for the cooking and then grilling of the ribs and it is the BEST.

Great sauce! And so versatile- a little sweet for me.  I've made it a number of times and sometimes used tomato paste or kethup or tomato paste, have had added lemon juice and apple cider vinegar for some more acid, A1 when we were out of Worcestersire, tobasco instead of the chile powder, fresh garlic instead of powder.  Each time delicious!

Instead of grilling I put into a glass baking dish, pour all the sauce over and broil for about 5-7 minutes. I dont even like BBQ sauce and I love this sauce!

These were pretty good.  I decided to brown the ribs under the broiler, then put them into the crockpot with the sauce.  They came out nice and tender and the sauce was good, but a little too tomatoe-y.  I thought the sauce could have used a little kick to spice it up.

holy cow. i would give this 10 stars if i could, they were that good. i make ribs all the time but i always cheat and parboil them first to make them tender, then i brush on the sauce and broil them in the end. but i decided to take some time with these and oh my gosh, they were fall-off-the-bone out of this world! my husband and i were wide-eyed throughout the whole dinner, we just couldn't believe how yummy they were. and normally, i do not like spicy ribs but these had the perfect combination of spiciness and sweetness to them, and by the way, the liquid smoke--genius! i don't know why i hadn't heard of this stuff before, it totally made the sauce. i didn't change a thing with the recipe, which is unusual for me--i followed the sauce recipe to a T. the only thing i did differently, and this was by accident, was i sprinkled the ribs with chili powder instead of red chili pepper. thankfully, i realized my mistake before i used the chili powder in the sauce. i don't know how much difference it made but next time i'll use the red chili pepper that the recipe calls for just to see if it makes a difference. will definitely make this recipe again and again and again, THANK YOU SO MUCH SCOTT HIBBS!!!

OH MY GOSH!!! My mom and I made these for Mothers Day and they were a HUGE hit!! I'm not a person that likes to be waiting for food for HOURS!! But let me tell you, these are worth waiting for!! They are the best, most tender ribs I have ever had in my life!! You wont regret making these delicious ribs!!! One thing we did do though is doubled the sauce, it does cook down and if you are a family who likes extra sauce after the ribs are done, then you are going to want to do this!!! I'm making them tonight for dinner too!! Thanks for sharing your recipe Scott!!! I also tried this with wings, and OMG mmmmmm!!!! This is seriously the best BBQ sauce ever!!!!

I made these for my son's 9th birthday party (he requested ribs).  I've only made ribs once or twice before, but these sounded good so I gave them a try.  They were AMAZING.  The sauce was to die for and the ribs were so tender.  My entire family said they were the BEST ribs they've had EVER (and some of these people have had ribs in many places).  Some of the guests who don't normally eat ribs had to try them because everyone was going on and on..... well they loved them too.  Great flavor, awesome easy recipe - I will use this again and again.  I wouldn't change a thing, but anyone who is super-sensitive to spiciness may want to decrease the chili pepper slightly.  They really weren't too spicy, but if you are really sensitive....

We absolutely loved this recipe and feel fortunate to have found it!  The ribs turned out perfect.  We made and used the sauce that's included in this recipe and actually preferred it over Stubb's Original BBQ Sauce, which surprised us.  We can't wait to make this recipe again for friends and family to show it off.  I'm uploading a photo for everyone to see.  I can't recommend this recipe enough.

I don't know what "ground chili pepper" is, so I used chili powder, and used garlic salt instead of regular salt on the ribs.  I also figured, since it is "whiskey ribs" that 2 tsp wasn't nearly enough, so increased that to 2 tbsp.  I did the ribs in the morning, and warmed them us just before dinner (covered with foil and a bit of water in the oven at 300* for 20 min), then basted them with sauce and broiled them.  This was only because I had other things on the BBQ for a potluck and was trying to cook 3 things at once.  The ribs turned out amazing, and I will DEFINITELY do these again.  Huge hit with everyone!

I love this recipe.Not only is the sauce good on the ribs, it's good on chicken and pork too. I have to admit that I did cheat a little and I did not grill the ribs. Instead, I placed them on the broiler pan and finished them under the broiler in my oven. Still fabulous! They should be award winning!

Truly Amazing BBQ sauce! I've always known about wrapping meat in foil and putting in the oven for two hours so it comes out juicy and tender. I've baked brisket overnight at 275 degrees and it turns out "melt in your mouth" tender and juicy. 
   I was concerned about what seemed to me HOT-HOUSE flavor while simmering the sauce (almost took my breath away) which I made before preparing the ribs. For that reason, I didn't put any red pepper on the ribs before placing in the oven. I wish I had - after the ribs were done they weren't as hot as I expected, but did have zing to them. They carmelized wonderfully. Once we finish off the ribs I'm grilling chicken and using this BBQ sauce, making enough to keep in the freezer for future use. NOTE: I did leave out the whiskey as I couldn't justify buying it for the small amt needed for this recipe. I just LOVE allrecipes.com!

This sauce is terrific!  I dialed back a little on the salt and smoke, and used some garlic paste instead of garlic powder.  What I got was a sauce that is bright and tangy - the flavor really pops and you can tell immediately that you're eating something just-made instead of a sauce that had been on the shelf in the grocery store for a long time.  Be careful handling the ribs when you unwrap them - the foil will be full of hot juices, so plan ahead.  Will make this recipe again, by popular demand!

I also omitted the liquid smoke. Just not into the artificial flavoring. The ribs turned out great without it! A definite hit.

Don't waste the juices that render from the ribs!  Carefully open the foil packets and drain the juices into a measuring cup, remove most of the fat then stir the juice into the bbq sauce.  Outstanding!

Ridiculously good! Outrageous! Fan-freaking-tastic!!!! 
I can't say enough about how good this sauce is. You will NEVER find anything in a store that will even remotely compare to this sauce. You can add a little more brown sugar or honey and molasses to sweeten it up or add a little more chili pepper to give it more heat (we did both-used the fresh red chili paste in a tube you find in the refrigerated produce area @ Safeway).  Make it your own. This is simply the best! We tripled the recipe to have extra and let me tell you, it went fast! We put it on everything; burgers, chicken...you name it. Left over ribs w/this sauce are better than day one. Wow! Thank you Scott Hibbs!

OMG the barbecue sauce is to die for!!!  I just threw everything into our vita mixer and it came out silky smooth.  I have a specific way that I love to cook the ribs and they come out perfect every time but I have used a variety of homemade sauces and this one is perfect.  thanks for sharing.

This recipe helped me make some of the best Ribs I have ever tasted.......  The family loved them too.  I had lots of left over sauce and used some for marinade for chicken breast the following night.  I then roasted the chicken in the oven at 350 for 1 1/2 hours turning once.  Finished them off in the barbeque braised with the little sauce left for 8 minutes on med high heat and voilla.  Incredibly tasty chicken breasts.  I JUST HAD TO USE THE LEFT OVER SAUCE FOR SOMETHING AND WOW DID I CHOOSE RIGHT.  Thank you so much for the delicious recipe!!!

This is by far, hands down the best rib and sauce recipe!  I make this time and time again for my husband and our guests.  Everyone raves about it and can't wait until I make them again (and invite them over for it).  I don't do anything different from what the recipe calls for - if you make it as is and pay attention to everything, it will turn out amazing!

I don't even know what to say.... I had never made ribs before, and I'd never made BBQ sauce before...but I had eaten plenty of both. These were simply the absolute best I've ever had of either. The only change I made to the original recipe was to increase the amount of whiskey to just a bit more than 1/4 cup, and then I also increased the time I simmered the sauce by about 10 minutes. FYI, these ribs go incredibly well with grilled corn on the cob, baked potatoes, and beer.

I know I am not the only  one to say it, but, these are THE BEST ribs ever.  I don't even like whisky, but, there is something about the slow cooking that does wonders.

I would not make these again with the lower quality ribs. I think it works better with better quality meat.

As a personal preference, I will use Bourbon Whiskey BBQ Sauce by Kevin next time, as it really is #1 in my book.  This method is the way to go though.  I also added paprika and garlic and onion powders to the dry rub.  These were a big hit! YUM!

I followed the recipe exactly and the ribs and sauce came out perfectly.  This is as close as I have to come to "restaurant quality" ribs.

Baby Back Ribs were on sale at my local on Friday so I picked some up and then looked for a recipe here. I made this.
WOWOWOWOW !!!
Soooooo easy and delicious !!!
Made the recipe exactly as written with one exception, I didn't have honey on hand (I thought I did, but the kids must have eaten it all) so I added an extra spoonful of Molasses....
My family raved about the sauce, and the ribs were tender and flavorful !
Just a wonderful recipe, Thanks, Scott !!!!!

These were very good, however, a bit too spicy for grilled baby back ribs .. I would definitely cut WAY back ... or even cut out ENTIRELY, the ground red chile pepper. I like spicy, but I was expecting a more sweet, bbq'y sauce taste here so I was a bit disappointed.

this was my first time trying to cook ribs. i used a standard spare rib and the cooking process described worked perfectly. the sauce was just the right level of sweetness and smoke. Definitely worth a try.

Didn't have tomato paste but tomato sauce worked beautifully as well. These ribs came out much more moist then I expected. When baking them in the oven, I put them in a shallow baking pan and put the folded side of the foil down. This allowed the pan to catch the juices as well as maximize the steaming effect of the ribs, which probably helped with keeping in very moist.

I prepared exactly per the recipe.  By far the best ribs I have ever eaten!  The BBQ Sauce is AMAZING and works well with beef and chicken -- I always make a double batch, refrigerate the extras, and use it the next weekend!

This is a fantastic sauce.  I HATE jarred BBQ sauce, they have really turned me away from BBQ altogether.  With this sauce I can enjoy it again.  My family loves this sauce as well.  My husband said it would make dog poo taste good.  I have only made minor changes over the dozen+ times I've made this.  1)I add fresh minced garlic to the onions and 2) when I'm in the mood for spicy add minced habenaro.

I have made it twice (once for July 4th) and everyone raves about it. I told my husband that this is only once a year treat since it's high in calories and fat, but I think this will be part of our holiday staples. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Awesome ribs recipe. The sauce was fantastic. Made it just as the recipe directed. It did take some time for it to reduce down to the thickness I wanted but like any great sauce recipe it was worth the wait. I think that I will double or triple the sauce recipe in the future to have extra on hand for chicken and even burgers. Thank you Scott for sharing this with everyone!

I don't usually review recipes but this one was so good I have to give kudos to Scott for his amazing rib recipe.  I did everything just as the recipe called except I didn't use liquid smoke.  I couldn't fine my bottle of it but I didn't really like the flavor when I used it before so maybe I gave it away.. oh and I did cook my ribs for 3 hrs.  I will be saving this one and making them again soon!

I would have given this recipe 5 stars but I didn't use baby back ribs or the liquid smoke for the sauce and I marinated the slab of ribs for an hour in Worchester sauce, garlic and onion powder before baking.  The meat is so tender it falls right off the bones.  This is the best homemade sauce I've ever had.  I've made it twice and I've gotten great reviews from my guests.  This one is definitely a keeper!

I used the recipe for the BBQ sauce only, and prepared my ribs like I always do - slow cooked in the oven for 2-3 hours, then finished them off on the Grill, applying the BBQ sauce liberally.... YUM!!!!

Best BBQ sauce EVER!  Only thing we changed was used chipotle chili powder instead of regular chili powder.  Was too spicy for my toddlers, but was so amazing!  Our ribs slid off the bone and I couldn't gobble them down fast enough.  We have a ton of sauce left that we froze for another day, so we can't wait to use it again.  My mouth is watering just thinking about this sauce.  Scott Hibbs...you're AWESOME!

Fantastic, made with chicken breasts I had to use up. Chicken was dry, my fault but this sauce recipe was great. Family said I could have put sauce on shoe leather and it would have been great. I cant wait to try on ribs. Definite keeper, you wont be sorry. Thanks for the great recipe.

wow! I've made tons of recipes from this site but never rated any. This one lived up to all of the previous reviews before me....just amazingly, unbelievably good!! I took others advice and doubled the sauce, but I was nervous in the beginning because it never seemed to thicken to what I thought it should be. But apparently that didn't matter because they were so finger-licking good!!

These were the BEST ribs we've ever had!!  They were fall off the bone and the sauce was amazing.  The only small changes I made to this recipe was adding fresh cloves of garlic and I pureed the onion and garlic in my magic bullet before cooking them.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  I made these for Father's Day and we had 8 guests that were raving.  Thanks so much:)

I don't know who Scott Hibb is, but I want to tell him his ribs ROCK!!! They are by far, the best I've ever made.  They truly ARE amazing. Sorry to say I didn't have any whiskey and they were still outrageously good.  I used a little extra onion than called for and fresh garlic.  It took about an hour and 40 minutes to reduce the sauce to a thicker consistency and I had it boiling on medium heat the last 30 minutes.  I doubled the sauce, as per another reviewer's suggestion, but it really wasn't necessary.

Made these to specs using Jamesons Irish Whiskey and ground chipotle chile pepper and let me just say, these are eye-closing, conversation-stopping, toe-curling good!! Oh. My. Heavens. Gurgle. Scott, WOW!! Thank you SO much for sharing! These are beyond amazing!

These ribs were great!  I have made them twice now.  1st time I took advice from others and went elsewhere for a more flavorful rub- But that really wasn't necessary at all!  The sauce on this recipe is so good you do not need anything more complicted than salt & pepper.  (Sauce is definitely spicy so if serving to sensitive taste buds I would recommend cutting back on the cayenne.  Even cutting it in half I think would still give you a really nice bite & you wouldn't be scaring off too may people with the spiciness.

Wow!!! These ribs were outstanding. I tried to make the recipe as written as I had all the ingredients except the whisky (used Tequila). My sauce got really thick after about 45 minutes (high altitude I guess) and it worked very well to coat the ribs and what a great flavor.  Thanks Scott for a great recipe I will do all my ribs this way!

Wow - THE best ribs we have ever made.  Amazing.  The family devoured them all the while raving about how good they were.  A fair bit of work to make the sauce - but totally worth it.

OMG....this recipe/sauce is amazing! I have also used it on bone-in chicken and it was great too.  My only deviation from the original recipe was I used Ancho Chili Powder on the ribs since I did not have ground red chile pepper o hand and red pepper flakes in the sauce in place of the chile pepper.  Awesome recipe~Thanks Scott for sharing!

WOW!  OMG!  My husband and I thought these were the best ribs we've ever had!  The sauce is phenomenal and the ribs fell rght off the bone.  It was my first time making them but they were way better than any restaurant quality ribs I've ever had.  Follow the recipe EXACTLY.  I was hesitant about the amount of red pepper but I followed it and didn't regret it.  It's not really spicy, comes out more tangy with a hint of spice.  If I could give this recipe 10 stars, I would!  Thank you Scott Hibb!

I loved this recipe!  Definitely 5 stars!  A few ingredient changes but I cooked them exactly like the recipe said and they turned out perfect.  I only used 1/2 tsp of liquid smoke, swapped garlic powder for 4 garlic cloves and used 4 tbsps of whiskey.  So so good!

The best way to describe this is... AMAZING, WONDERFUL, DELICOUS, GREAT, AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!  I did this recipe as listed but left out the liquid smoke (not a fan of the smoke flavor) and the whisky (didn't have any) but I really don't think it mattered.  This is going in the keeper file for sure!

We made these ribs with the sauce today and it was amazingly good. My husband was eating the sauce with his finger out of a bowl! The rib meat was very soft and so juicy, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. I never actually made my own bbq sauce before so must admit I was intimidated but this is a good recipe for a beginner. Left out the liquid smoke and whiskey because I didn't have any and it still turned out fantastic. Will definitely be making these again and again! Thanks for posting the recipe!

These ribs were FANTASTIC!!!!! The sauce is the best I've ever had. Made his for family and it was a big hit. I also used the bbq sauce for some pork chops and it was great. Gonna use it on some burgers on the grill today! Thanks for the recipe

WOW! These ribs are amazing. I'm not a big fan of ribs but these were incredibly delicious.  The slow cooking is the key as the meat is so tender. I was leery about the amount of ground red chile pepper but it was perfect.  I didn't have any molasses so that was the only difference as far as following the recipe goes. I will definitely make these again.

Took these to a skeet shoot with friends and everyone loved them. I followed the recipe exactly, except left out liquid smoke. They were perfect! Already planning to make them for my college kids when they come home for break. Thank you!

Loved this! I have never done ribs before, but they turned out perfectly. Fell off the bone.  I followed another reviewers advice and used the spice rub from Prize Winning Baby Back Ribs, which is pretty much the same rub as Scott used, but had a few more spices.  The bbq sauce was fantastic. The only thing I changed was to use onion powder only, not onions and onion powder. I can't stand onions and didn't want to take the extra step to blend the chunks out.

These were absolutely fantastic.  I just wish that I had placed the foil wrapped ribs on a cookie sheet, because now I have grease all over the bottom of my oven.  The BBQ sauce was fantastic and paired very well with the ribs.  This will be our go to rib recipe.

Made this last night for a family get together and they were awesome! They were so tender they were literally falling off the bone. The sauce was also great, but I had to cut back on the red pepper a lot. I just lightly sprinkled both sides of the ribs with the cayenne pepper along with the salt and pepper before baking and I only added 1/2 tsp cayenne to the sauce. There was still plenty of kick without being too hot. Love, love, love them!

We thought these were great.  Loved the homemade BBQ sauce.  Adjusted this for 8 servings (I had 5 one pound slabs of ribs) and had plenty of sauce for grilling and serving.  Even my very picky 4 year old loved it!  Thanks!

Responses from my BBQ guests....  Guest #1: Sweet, tender, juicy, yummy goodness.  Guest #2: Yumm-dili-ocious. Guest #3: A party in my mouth and everyone is coming. Guest #4: This particular guest normally does not eat                       ribs...(sad, but true)...but stated that he could eat                     these everyday. Guest #5: This is my new favorite thing that you make!  The meat turned out to be incredibly tender...the meat fell off the bone!!! The sauce was great. I ended up adding more whiskey, honey, sugar, molasses and liquid smoke (I honestly can't tell you how much because I don't know). If you go to the store and find they have different types of liquid smoke...I recommend getting mesquite flavored. Also, I took the advise from another review and added about a tablespoon of water to each "packet" of meat while cooking it in the oven. Lastly, once the sauce cooked down to a consistency I liked I put it in the blender to smooth it out...I have to say this sauce is quite tasty!!!!  This is a super tasty recipe that all my Pride party guests enjoyed!!!!!!

Fantastic! Didn't change a thing. At first I was nervous about it being to spicy, but not at all. Once everything cooked as ordered, it all melded together just great. A must try at least once. We will do it again.

WOW!!!  This was my first time making ribs, so after MUCH research, I decided to go with this one because the reviews were so great.  We had a dinner party for 9, and mostly men, and the ribs were a hit!  You know it's good when people stop talking during the meal ;).  I did everything as it, except I reduced the water to 1 cup.  I doubled the batch, and it came out great.  It is spicy and sweet and tangy all at the same time.  The ribs fell right off the bone.  We even lost a few in the grill!  Don't skip the grill part, that was the winning move.

i made my ribs a little different so i can only comment on the sauce. (i did a rub, refrigerated them for 4 hrs in tinfoil packets, then cooked in packets at 300 for 2.5 hrs)once the ribs were cooked i slathered them with scott's sauce and finished for a few minutes on the grill for the grill flavor/marks.  getting onto the sauce it was excellent! i used 2 TBSP minced DRIED onion and skipped the veggie oil part at the begining. i cut back the cayenne to about 1/3 of what he had as i think they would have been way too hot for our family and our 5 yr old. the sauce is deep flavored and has just the right bite and finish. would be excellent on any types of ribs or even a beef brisket...thank you.

Great recipe!! Followed it exactly.  I have made these several times now and my husband (who loves ribs) always raves.  Don't let all the ingredients in the sauce scare you...it's super easy.  TIP: Double it and freeze 1/2 for next time.  Also: be sure to wrap the ribs TIGHTLY in foil and line a baking sheet w/foil to avoid accidental leaks of the grease in your oven!

This deserves 10 stars! Best ribs ever, and I've been making them a long time. My search is over for the best recipe! Followed exactly, except I cut the oven time by 30 min, so the ribs would be tender, but not fall apart. The cooking method is the best I've found, but the sauce is the key and is well worth the effort. I'll never use another recipe!Can't wait to try it on chicken. I want to try to make the sauce a little thicker next time. The flavor is to die for!

Add me to the list of hearty endorsers; this was incredibly tasty. For those who don't like whiskey or red pepper: I skipped both and this was still fantastic. After slow-baking for 2 hours in the foil, I unwrapped the ribs, coated them with sauce, and baked at 325, with the convection fan running, for the last 1/2 hour. It would have been even better finished on the grill, but if you're in a hurry, using the oven works well.

Absolutely-yes,yes,yes.Who needs to drive to Memphis? We did add a dry Memphis restaurant-purchased seasoning at the end, but used the sauce to serve them "wet and dry." They fell off the bone the way any respectable baby back should.  Even without the special seasoning, they would have been excellent-- it's an amazing sauce. If you like it spicy, just add more of the chile pepper. This recipe is like having a new toy in the kitchen toybox; we can't wait to share it with friends!

Made ribs in oven and used McCormick pork rub. Put on grill and used my wifes old family bbq recipe. These ribs turned out to be the best ribs I have ever eaten period. The oven method took all the worries of cooking away. Make sure you foolow instructions and let ribs sit before placing on grill. The ribs pulled away from the bone easily. THE BEST RIBS EVER.

MAKE THIS RECIPE!!!  DO NOT CHANGE A THING!!! I made this for my mom for Mother's Day and OMG these are the absolute best ribs you will ever taste!  I was nervous because I don't grill or even really eat pork, but this was so easy and sooooo good!  My husband was nevervous about baking them so long- he thought they would be too dry.  But when we put them on the grill, the meat was almost falling off the bones.  I bought 6 1/2 lbs. and there was still enough sauce for probably another 4 lbs.  DO NOT PASS THIS RECIPE UP- IT IS THE BEST!!!

Really good!  Based on the feedback of others, I cut back on the Liquid Smoke to 3/4 teaspoon.

Ribs were tender and tasty. I will make this recipe again.

The ribs were excellant.  I loved the method of cooking slowly in the oven, but I would proabably not make this sauce again.  Too much work, for not as much taste as desired.  Overall great recipe with some modifications needed.

I made this recipe and it is really over the top GREAT!  Great job Scott.  I did one little addition as i like it a little "less" sweet.  I added 2 shots of espresso to even it out a bit.
Love this sauce!!

There's many ways to cook ribs.  That being said, this recipe is a fail proof method to perfect ribs. You wont get that 4hour in the smoker crust but "fall-off-the-bone" "tender-as-can-be" ribs is what you'll get. I give this recipe 4 stars because im not a fan of the sauce.  It wasnt bad, just not my cup of tea.

Sensational!!! This weekend I had my first attempt at cooking baby back ribs. I found this recipe which was my lucky day. 

The ribs were falling off the bone delicious. The sauce was superb with the brown sugar with it's sweetness cut with vinegar. The minced onion was perfect giving body to the sauce. The sauce on top of the ribs the last 4 or 5 minutes on the grill provided a beautiful baby back ribs presentation. 
It was the hit of the party and so easy even a beginer can look like a pro. Thanks for a great recipe; doing again this weekend for the family gathering.

Only one word to describe the ribs: delicious or as the Dutch/Germans would say, "Like an angel pissing on your tongue."  

I pretty much followed the recipe with the following deviations mostly motivated by lacking the product required above:
1) Used hot paprika instead of chilli peppers to spice the ribs;
2) Used grade A Vermont maple syrup as I did not have any brown sugar in the same quantity;
3) Used cider vinegar rather than white vinegar in the same quantity.

As I did not start cooking early enough, I reduced the time in the oven by 30 minutes and increased the time on the grill by 10 minutes or so.  

I suspect that using ribs purchased from my local butcher rather than the supermarket variety also contributed greatly to the experience.

Made these for a friendly BBQ rib cookoff and was the first time I'd ever made ribs...took home first place!!! Will definitely make these again and again! Cooked mine on a gas grill over indirect heat at 300 for 2 1/2 hrs, they were so tender you couldn't cut them apart they just fell off the bone! Won't be using a different recipe for a while this one is a KEEPER!

This is the best BBQ sauce recipe I have ever made.  I have made this sauce at least 20 times and have added a few of my own touches that have made this sauce amazing... I still follow this base recipe almost to a t and if this is your first or fiftieth attempt at BBQ sauce, you will be amazed.  On a side note, this sauce is responsible for my winning the Guatemala BBQ challenge 2012 and I am now an award winning chef... thanks Scott Hibb for this wonderful recipe!!  My hat is off to you for sharing.

These were awesome (not to sound like a broken record as you're reading this after reading all the other reviews) but, yes, awesome!!! It was my first time making ribs and I got rave reviews! yay! Only change I made was to broil on high 3min instead of grilling at the end.

We usually smoke our ribs but decided too late to have ribs to do that. I decided on this recipe bcuz it is how I make ribs if i don't smoke them. Cook them in the oven and then grill the sauce into them until it carmelizes. I loved the rub and the sauce ingredients. They were a hit with my family as well. Thanx for sharing ur recipe Scott.

Fabulous! I tripled the sauce as we had a LOT of ribs. It took 2hrs or so to reduce then blended it once cool to chop up the onions. Also I accidentally grabbed two racks of St. Louis style ribs along with the baby backs and they worked out just fine cooking for the same amount of time. This is definitely a keeper!

Really really good sauce. Made this exactly as written, and was impressed. 
Ribs were falling off the bone, and the flavour was excellent.
I have a bunch of sauce left over and will freeze it for another day.

I made this for a pot luck serving about 80 people, and there was absolutely nothing left.  I cooked my ribs differently, but I made the sauce according to the recipe.  I had some extra suace left I put into a dish for ladeling on the ribs. The ribs and all of the sauce were gone in less than 10 minutes!
Outrageously good.

This is my 1st review but these ribs deserve it. Amazing ribs and sauce!! I used my own, more in depth rub but followed the directions/sauce to the T. Absolutely wonderful. It thickens up quite nicely if you leave it alone. Will be making again and again!!

I have been making this sauce for 2 years now and finally got around to rating this recipe. The BBQ sauce is the best, HANDS DOWN!! Thank you, Scott for sharing this awesome recipe. Everyone who has tried the sauce ends up asking for the recipe. I loved the recipe as is but it was too much heat for my 4 year old, so I cut down the Chile pepper to 1/4 tsp. STILL a 5 star recipe. I will admit it takes a long time to cook, but it is a labor of love. It is so worth the wait, and I make this recipe one a week during the summer and at least once a month during the winter. I love paring this with grilled chicken. (One lb. of chicken breast marinated in pineapple juice and brown sugar with a bit of Worcestershire for about 30 minutes then seasoned with garlic salt and cracked pepper.) Does not sound like much but it really pairs nicely. This really is a great sauce and I absolutely love it!

Just great, rave reviews at our Super Bowl party. I omitted the liquid smoke, used real garlic and rhum instead of whiskey (that's what I had at home). We have no access to our grill in the winter, so I baked with the sauce for an additional 30 minutes in the oven at 350 degrees, uncovered.

This was absolutely delicious.  It was very flavorful and even had a little tang.  I will likely add some fresh peppers to increase the spiciness, but I like HOT.  It is perfect the way it is for most folks.  Do yourself a favor and do NOT leave anything out of this recipe.

My mother-in-law told me these were the best ribs she had ever had...I thought these were in the top 3.
Make sure you wrap the ribs well in foil so bones do not break through and drain the liquid. A good seal is the key to getting good results.

Well, I went off the path here. I do slow cook my ribs in the oven but I place them in a jelly roll style sheet pan but also coat with minced onion and pineapple; then cover tightly with foil. Once the ribs completely cooled - I scrape off the onion/pineaple coating and drench with my own righteous BBQ sauce that I prefer. I utilize soaked wood chips in my gas grill to give the ribs a bit more smokey flavor and go with a low temp on the grill as well.  I don't care for "fall of the bone" ribs. They should be tender but not falling apart IMHO. I remove that icky membrane from the underside after ribs have been slow cooked and cooled. However, Scott got it right with the slow oven cooking first...then finishing on a grill. Yay! Didn't have Whiskey to incorporate but don't feel I missed anything with 2 teaspoons called for. Guess I won't ever know since I didn't use Scott's BBQ sauce. I'm sure it's good, I just go with what I have perfected for my own tastes.

All I can say is AWESOME !! Followed the recipe exactly, except had to finish the ribs in the oven as we had no gas for the grill. I unwrapped the ribs, basted with the sauce and put back in the oven for 15 min.  My husband raved about these ribs!  I used some of the left over sauce on some chicken the next day! Great!

These ribs are the bomb!  Cooked 15 lbs worth last night, and could have cooked twice as much; they were gobbled up.  EVERYONE said they were the best ribs they'd ever had!  I tripled the recipe and probably could have got by only doubling, but it's nice to have leftover in the freezer for the family.  I had to increase my simmering intensity to get it to thicken though due to the increased liquid.

Omg, I made this recipe yesterday & the ribs were absolutely the best!  The bbq sauce is very tasty & next time I will double the recipe!  The only suggestion I have is to cut the baking time down a bit because the ribs were falling off the bone(which is not a bad thing)

10 out of 5 stars. I made these for supper tonight, as well as supplementing with some pre packaged ribs from a national food store. My family licked all the sauce from these off their fingers and cleaned the rib bones till they shined. The pre packaged ones were barely touched, but all were looking for more of these.
I made according to recipe and instructions (minus liquid smoke, not a big fan) and they were awesome.  Definitely the recipe for ribs from this point on. Thanks

I followed the directions on cooking the ribs almost exactly but did not use his sauce based on the reviews that seemed to rate the sauce poorly. The only adjustment I made was letting the ribs cook for three and half hours instead of two and a half hours. The meat was literally falling off of the bone - almost too much because it was hard to get them on and off the grill without them falling apart. Next time I'll go a little less.

Absolutely outstanding!  I cut back on the chili pepper a bit and had no molasses so I added extra honey.  But I was otherwise true to this recipe.  I will be making this again - my wife insists!

THESE RIBS ARE THE VERY BEST! I WOULD GIVE THIS RECIPE 10+ STARS IF POSSIBLE! THE ONLY PROBLEM IS I PREPARE WHAT SHOULD BE MORE THAN ENOUGH, BUT THEY ARE SOOO DELISH, THAT EVERY LAST RIB ALWAYS GETS EATEN & I ALWAYS THINK I SHOULD'VE MADE MORE! SADLY WE NEVER HAVE WE BEEN LEFT WITH ANY LEFT OVERS ;)  QUESTION - DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW LONG THE REMAINING, UNTOUCHED, SAUCE CAN BE LEFT IN THE FRIDGE FOR?

So I partially made this recipe...I didn't have baby back ribs, I had side ribs, which need slower, longer cooking to break down the connective tissues. But I made this BBQ sauce and used it, without cooking it down, in the slow cooker. First I boiled the ribs in water for 15 minutes, then cooked them for 6 1/2 hours on low in the slow cooker. The sauce was AMAZING, I'm going to cook down the leftovers and keep it in the fridge to use later. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

After all these fantastic reviews I thought I had found the perfect recipe, but this was not the case. The sauce left me and my family with a bite and something to be desired, even after I added more sugar, water, and cooked it down more. I ended up using the regular BBQ sauce I had in my fridge. At least the cooking style left the ribs tender and fell off the bone. I recommend the cooking style but the sauce may not agree with all tastes.

Excellent way to prepare any ribs!  Loved the outcome.  The sauce is great.  I ended up bottling some for later use.  My son and I are avid cooks and both agreed this recipe is the way to go.

These ribs were so fall off the bone delicious!  I've made them twice now, and since it makes so much, my husband takes them to work to share with some travelers away from family.  I've gotten requests to please send the recipe with him to hand out.  The sauce is so yummy.  And these were really very easy too!!

WOW!  I can only echo what others are saying.  TRY THIS!!!  The meat was falling off the bone and this is by far the best sauce ever.  I'm not a fan at all of traditional BBQ sauces and I LOVED this. It is amazing as-is but I look forward to playing with it a bit, too.  Might try spicing it up because we like hot, but absolutely no changes needed.  I made exactly as written and it is delish!  This is my new go-to rib recipe, I've never had them turn out well until now.  Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

These were the best ribs I've ever had in my life. They were incredibly easy to make and soooo tender. The sauce is something I'll make for a lot of different meats. My husband is still talking about them.

I stayed away from making baby backs at home because it seemed like too much work. WOW! Was I wrong! These turned out fabulous, fall off the bone delicious! The sauce is amazing! I doubled it the second time & we have used it on chicken, hamburgers & other grilled meats. We are no longer going out when we want good ribs!

I've never been able to grill ribs.  I tend to burn them....so often that I'm pretty sure the grocery store would alert the fire department whenever I bought them!  I've tried so many ways to cook them but they just didn't come out tender and delicious like in a restaurant.    Well this recipe changed that!  The only thing I did differently was that I used a little less chili powder on the rub.  Double wrapped them in foil and put them on pans in the oven, since  a couple people said they had leaks.  I made the sauce exactly as written except a little more whiskey. :)  This sauce is fantastic!    These ribs were so tender and delicious I will make them these way from now on.  Thank you for the excellent recipe!

OH YEAH!  These things turned out PERFECT!  After grilling them for a few minutes on each side to get a crust on the meat, I moved them over to one side, spread the sauce on and smoked them with some hickory wood chips in foil over the flame w/ the lid closed.  HOOOOOOOOODoggie!  These things were better than any restaurant ribs and only $10 for the meat on sale.  This is the one!!!

SO GOOD! I was surprised to see a rib recipe that had such high ratings and didn't take all day to make. I gave it a shot, and I was not at all disappointed. This recipe is incredible. I didn't follow it exactly, I didn't have enough tomato paste so I substituted ketchup for the remaining volume, and I omitted the liquid smoke, but it turned out great. I used some of the leftover sauce on chicken, and it was also excellent.   This might be the best barbecue sauce I've ever had.

Yum! Was worth the 2.5 hour wait. I used olive oil instead of vegtable oil and the sauce was not as thick as it should be I had to thicken it up. Still very good :)

These were AWESOME, and totally easy to make ahead, and throw on the bbq at the last minute. I made extra, thinking I'd for sure have leftovers, but no way, not a single rib was left behind. Should note that we applied a dry rub before baking them in the oven. Fabulous!

We loved this! Even my former rib disliker has changed his mind!  The sauce was perfect the way I did it, skipping the spicy/peppery stuff. I used a jar of rib rub on the meat before baking. Covered and baked as directed, then added sauce in the last 25 minutes, uncovered. Delish!

This recipe is without a doubt the absolute best I have ever tasted for Baby Back Ribs! I am originally from the south (Atlanta) and therefore know what good ribs taste like. After relocating to the Puget Sound 10 years ago, and being very disappointed with the quality of ribs on the west coast, I decided to give this recipe a try. Rest assured, this is the THE recipe.  Be sure to purchase good quality Baby Back ribs. The ones we purchased were excellent. The meat was so tender that it was falling off the bone even as we cooked them on a couple of the half racks, but that just gave us an opportunity to sample the delight we were about to enjoy.  Pair this with a cherries jubilee and some cheesy garlic biscuits and some potato salad, and you have a great cookout holiday combination.  Of course, all is not lost here on the Puget Sound.  Fortunately, we have a huge selection of Washington State wines to choose from. We paired this dish with a delightful Hogue Cabernet (2006) and had the perfect 4th of July meal.

I thought the cooking method was going to leave the ribs a little bland since they weren't marinaded or cooked long with the sauce but boy was I wrong...these were delicious! A few things I did differently...baked for about 4 hours at 225 since we had to leave the house for a few hours. I didn't cook the sauce very long since it seemed plenty thick off the bat and I didn't have time--about 15 min. or so. Also I used spare ribs instead just b/c of cost but they were plenty tender. Great Father's Day meal!

This recipe was simple and the meat comes out very tender, falling off the bone. Barbeque sauce has the perfect blend of sweet and spice. Try it, you won't be disappointed.

I see this recipe being rated all the time.  I've looked at it and thought "a rib is a rib right?"  I made this yesterday and it really requires minimal effort.  Got the ribs going and the sauce and then forget about them giving the sauce a stir every now and then.  I'm worried because I can smell the whiskey fairly far into the sauce cooking process, but I press on.  I didn't make any changes to the ingredients or the recipe.  These are the BEST ribs I have EVER eaten including my Moms which says a lot.  I will make these again for sure.  This is now my go to recipe. YUM x 10.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This recipe is delicious! It went over really well at our mother's day BBQ. I did make a few changes. We didn't have tomato paste so like others suggested I used ketchup and cut down the water to one cup. We didn't have liquid smoke or red chile pepper either, in place of the chile pepper we used the seasoning. Since it was for a large gather, we tripled the recipe, it came out great but it took about 2 hours for the sauce to boil down. We will surely make this many times over!!! Enjoy

Scott, my sister made these ribs for her family weeks ago, and since I'm vegetarian I could only taste the sauce, which was so phenomenal I've dreamed of it ever since.  She led me to this site last night and I can't wait to make my own batch to smother every veggie protein in the house.  Thanks for a superb recipe - I'll let you know how I do!!

This sauce was AWESOME.  I had three racks to grill, so I doubled the recipe and added an extra teaspoon (5 total) of Jack Daniels.  I wasn't sure if the minced onion was supposed to be fresh or the dried kind, btu after reading that some people opted to try a fresh, I figured it was supposed to be the dry kind.  That's what I used and it came out great.  All that dry minced onion gives the sauce very slight texture and the flavor is amazing.  Friends loved it and I will make it again.

Sauce was pretty good, ribs had a slightly odd texture from the cooking process.  Next time I'll put em in the smoker and hit them with the sauce at the end.

I normally don't make any kind of food requiring bbq sauce, but decided to do so this weekend for my family for our Easter dinner. Thank goodness that I did! My family absolutely loved them! My husband was very impressed, especially since the last time I attempted to make ribs they turned out horrible! I HIGHLY recommend this recipe to everyone-Excellent recipe Scott!! And thank you for saving me from making horrible ribs!

Whooo Wheee!  This is good stuff. I didn't change a thing except to double it.   I simmered the sauce for about 2 hours on very very low heat.  I doubled it and wound up with an extra quart to put in the fridge for future use.  We used it on spare ribs that were cut St.Louis style.  I sprinkled them with salt, pepper and cayenne pepper and then baked them in a large roasting pan covered with aluminum foil.  Then, brushed on the sauce and finished on the grill.  Our friends raved over this sauce!  We think it's better than Sweet Baby Rays and that says a lot because we all love that!

Awesome recipe!!! It was my first time making ribs and I followed the recipe exactly as it is.  The ribs came out very tender and juicy, and the sauce was absolutely amazing!  I will definitely add this recipe to my repertoire, and the sauce would be great on other things (i.e. grilled chicken breast).  The sauce was pretty spicy, so if I wanted to cook for more than just my husband and I then I would cut the cayenne pepper at least in half.  However, my husband loved the spicy sauce.

This BBQ sauce was great.  I too didn't have any tomato paste on hand, so I used ketchup instead.  I didn't have any liquid smoke either, but it didn't seem to make a difference as this sauce was great.

OMG!!  This was, by far, the best rib recip and I've tried many.  I've fixed this recipe 3 times now and I've gotten rave reviews every time!  Please make sure you make the BBQ sauce in this recipe.  It is fantastic!  The only changes I made were to use only 1 cup of water and 2 TBL. of wiskey instead of just 1 TBL.  By accident, I used chili powder instead of red chili pepper for the dry rub.    Turns out....I like it better!  They taste even more terrific the next day!!

I've been looking for a good bbq rib recipe for a while and finally found it here!  My guests couldn't stop raving saying they were the best ribs they've ever eaten. I agree! Thank you. I would add one tip and that's to remove the membrane off the ribs before applying the rub.

These were excellent...every rib was gone. The sauce was wonderful as we like it spicy rather than sweet.  This is my new rib recipe, thanks for sharing.

WOW!! I made this 2 days ago and my family is still talking about them. When I took them out of the oven and unwrapped them the meat actually fell off the bone. The sauce was fantastic!!! I served them with a salad and some homemade garlic bread. I will be making these many more times in the future! Thank you for this amazing recipe!   I've used this recipe so many times that I've literally memorized it! Now I make the sauce and bottle it.It tastes even better because it has time to settle.

I hate to dissent from the crowd, but I thought this recipe was just OK.  I followed the recipe exactly - I even went out and bought whiskey and liquid smoke.  I liked the cooking method - the ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender - but the sauce was nothing special to me. It wasn't bad and my family said they liked the ribs, but I honestly think it would have been just as good with my favorite store bought BBQ sauce. I have tasted some incredible homemade sauces, but this one was just average to me.

I made these just as posted, using ground chipolte chile pepper for the red chile pepper. These are quite possibly the best ribs I've ever tasted... FANTASTIC recipe, a HUGE hit in our house, thanks so much for sharing. The sauce on these is unbelievable, it will be my new bbq sauce, period. Don't let the list of ingredients and time involved scare you off, this recipe is worth every second!

I tried to marinate the ribs in the sauce and then bake them.  My husband and I found them bland even after marinating.  Maybe the barbque would have helped, but I'm going to try another faster option before giving this recipe another try.

This is awesome!  I love the sauce more than any I have tried!  I have made this a few times and everyone loves it.  I use spare ribs.  Now I do change one thing.  I remove the "skin" on the bone side of the ribs.  I then sprinkle a good rub all over the ribs generously.  After that I put brown sugar on them and let it melt.  Then I put them in the fridge overnight.  Lastly I cook mine in pans covered in foil with a mixture of vinagar,water and liquid smoke till they are ready for the grill to be seared.  I sauce on the side.  These are awesome!  Thanks for getiing me started on ribs and sauce making Scott

Soooooo Goooood! I used cayenne pepper powder, and was apprehensive about it turning out too hot to eat, but these were wonderful! We all loved this sauce. I used hickory smoke, Jack Daniel's whiskey, and it blended so well you couldn't even taste it. I did add an extra dab of honey. Fantastic ribs! We left them in the foil and grilled them without turning as they were way too tender. We'll have these again!

Absolutely loved it.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I have had one better and this really fancy restaurant.  Now I have to say this is the best homemade one I have ever had, the only thing is that for others to try putting this Wild turkey American Honey Whiskey, oh that is the best marinade with it.

First time cooking ribs and I definetely picked the right recipe. Meat just fell off the bone! Sauce was tasty as well. One hint however, be careful when handling ribs on the grill, they'll fall apart easily if you're not careful.

This is the perfect winter rib recipe!! I found it to be simple and as others have reviewed a very deliscious choice. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of cutting back to 1 cup of water on the sauce, as I like a thick BBQ sauce. I also added one more tsp. of whiskey for good measure. My sauce cooked for 1 1/2 hrs as suggested and thicked to perfection. I was very happy with the results and the flavor balance between sweet, sour and spicey was outstanding. Very tender ribs, we finished ours using charcoal on the Webber and it ROCKED!! Thanks for a great rib recipe.

my husband made this a couple of weeks ago and we just loved them. Made the recipe exactly as printed. Actually, frozen some of the cooked ribs and just made up the sauce later, heating them up on the bbq, they were just as good as the first time.

I am a 36 year old African American.
These are the best ribs I have ever had in my life. That's saying something. The sauce is the perfect compliment - not overpowering, not understated, but just right. I used maple syrup instead of molasses - but I'm sure molasses would be just as good. I refuse to make ribs any other way now. Quick, easy, no need to pull the membrane off the back, cook them in a bbq kettle all day at 150 degrees, marinade or any of that other nonsense. Love this recipe. Thanks Scott!

Awesome, thanks for sharing Scott.  Only thing I would do next time is cut baking time bout 1/2 hour, meat was falling off the bone, making it difficult to place on grill.  Again, awesome, family loved it, thanks for sharing...P.S.  Ribs taste great grilled with mesquite wood..........

This is a great recipe!  No complaints!  The ribs are fall off the bone and the sauce rocks!  I used freshly dried red chile peppers and that gave a good punch!  I think I will reduce the dosage next time! (for other not for me as I like it HOT!)  The sauce is fabulous and easy to make!  Very aromatic!  I may try adding real maple syrup in the recipe next time!  ;)

Made these for dinner tonight.  Hubby said I out did myself!  I've tried so many rib recipes over the years and these can out awesome.  From now on this is the only way they'll be cooked.  It was too bad I only had one rack of ribs for the two of us.  Next time I know to do more.  The sauce I thought was going to be too spicy, but complemented the ribs perfectly.  I even put some BBQ sauce in my baked beans and the came out great too.  Thanks Scott for a great recipe!

Amazing!!  I have now found the ONLY rib and BBQ sauce recipe I will ever make again!!!  Wow Scott, you should bottle this commercially. It's that good! Also, it's good on chicken, shredded beef or pulled pork.  I make bite-size bacon wrapped pineapple and dunked them in this sauce--they went like hot-cakes!  Good used instead of pizza sauce and topping with ham and pineapple.

We are making these rib's tonight and have used this recipe about 8 times the past year. They are true to the name , AMAMAIZNG!   I do tend to use a bit less of the white wine vinegar, but otherwise, I stick to the plan.

I made these ribs the first time at my husband's superbowl party last year... and all I can say is EXCELLENT!  Now I make them for every party and I still hear that they are the best ribs anyone's tasted.  I spice up the ribs a bit with garlic oil, cayenne and black pepper, just for a little kick.  My husband makes sure I keep all the ingredients for the sauce on hand at all times! Awesome, can't say enough about them!

I took this to camp for our annual pork cookout.  I cold smoked 9 lb. of Saint Louis style ribs for a couple of hours and proceeded from there with the recipe.  Seven of us ate all of the ribs which shows how much we thought of them and liked them.  I now have to make copies of the recipe to hand out.

Wow Scott, this is a great sauce recipe!!  Since I have made my ribs this way for years, the sauce peaked my interest, and it was tasty.  I halved the recipe and used a shot of Jameson...no Jack in the house...I will maybe add more next time, and cut back just a bit on the sugar.  It's a keeper if the hub gave it a thumbs up.  If you don't want to use the oven, simmering the ribs works good too, fall off the bone delish.  Thanks for the great recipe Scott.

This recipe is definitely a keeper. The sauce lends a surprisingly fruity flavour to the ribs and is a really nice change to the usual rib suaces

After following the recipe exactly, I didn't find this extraordinary, which is why I would give it 4 stars.  But then I added about 2 T. pickling spice to it (in a tea ball) and simmered it for another 20 - 30 minutes, and then removed the spices and blended the sauce in my Vita-Mix, and this, folks, brought it to a 10 star BBQ sauce.  My hubby and company loved it also.

This recipe is amazing!! First time I've made ribs worth talking about. I didn't bother measuring the onion. I know it was more than called for and not minced very well. Everything else was exactly as written. Everyone loved them. The homemade sauce is over the top. I would use it all by itself.

Made this and my boyfriend, biggest critic of my cooking and often challenges me on how he could have done it better (:P), said it was so good he would literally have to quit working, scour the world of rib cook offs, train in the art of barbecuing, and would probably still not make better ribs than these. 

I didn't do the garlic and onion powder for the sauce cause I already had real onions and added pureed garlic (prob more than needed but thats how we like it). Also, since the ribs were smaller I only did about 2 - 2.25 hours in oven and 2-3 minutes grilling.

Only thing I would recommend, if you don't already, is after pre-cleaning the grill I would use these oiled grill wipes so the rib meat won't stick to the grill (not that I lost a lot of meat but it was so good you don't want to lose any). 

Was best paired with a kale caesar salad that can be made a head of time while your waiting on the ribs. I recommend at least 15 but 30 minutes before serving is better (depending on type of kale - I had lots of baby kale from the stocks I grow in my garden)

These were delicious and easy to prepare.  They were tender, and just great!  I broiled mine in oven and found that you could put sauce on ribs about 5 min. before they were done, and it wouldn't burn.

OMG these were easily the best ribs I've ever had. I followed the recipe exactly. I made them in conjunction with the BBQ spice rub from this site and they were to die for!!!  This is the only rib recipe I will use. I even bought less expensive spare ribs (half the price of baby back) and by the time they were done the bones could be pulled out easily without a fleck of meat on them. THAT'S what you call a great rib. Flavors taste great and they smell incredible. Take a while, but it's mostly just letting them cook in the oven, and these are well worth the wait. Awesome recipe, thanks so much for sharing!!

This was the first time ever making ribs and I made them for a family birthday. Everyone LOVED these and the meat was literally falling off the bone.  My husband thought they were AMAZING! The only modification I made was reducing the chili pepper simply because I had toddlers eating them too. This is definitely a recipe to keep!

This recipe is amazing!  These are unbelievably tender and juicy and full of robust flavor!  Well worth the several hours you put in on it.  I would not change a single thing in this recipe!  Just an update.  I've been making these ribs now for years and man oh man they are still my favorite.  Nothing beats them!

Awesome!  I'd never made ribs before, but gave this recipe a shot.  SO GLAD I DID!  I go very easy on the chili pepper and use Trader Joe's South African Smoke Seasoning Blend (in grinder) in lieu of the liquid smoke.  It's great on wings too!

I used this recipe for a cook-out this past summer. It did take about 3 hours to make them, but they were gone in 10 minutes! It has an excellent flavor and has taken first page status in my personal favorites recipe book. The meat fell from the bone soft and has a barbecue flavor that just can't be beat. I'd recommend this one to anyone!

I live in Argentina, in a small town so liquid smoke and molasses are not available.I just increased the brown sugar and honey a little bit to compensate. However,even without those ingredients this recipe is amazing, I will never buy barbecue sauce again! the ribs were fantastic too.

I was expecting this to be amazing with the reviews I saw, but I found the ribs were really greasy cooked this way and the sauce was not the best recipe I've tried.  I prefer the ribs slow boiled first to reduce the fat, they still end up very tender that way, but aren't so greasy.  The sauce just didn't do it for me.

Truly is amazing. Followed it exactly as is, (except we had 3.5 pounds of ribs) and there was plenty of sauce. Actually had about 2 cups leftover. Quite a kick, might reduce the chili pepper/black pepper just a tad...but then again....maybe not!  These were fantastic.

Made ribs at 325 in the egg with chef matts rub on the pizza pan with 80% apple juice 20% water. For 2 1/2 hours (put a meat thermometer on it) might have overcooked a little bit.  Made this bbq sauce, amazing!!  Put sauce on the ribs and put on the egg for about 10 minutes.  Really really good!!!

This sauce is the best.  I made a double batch and canned half of it.

This sauce is absolutely incredible.  I have made it 6 times since Memorial Day...I think my husband is addicted to it and uses it on everything.  For the rib recipe, I did double it as we like extra for dipping.  Fabulous recipe.  Highly recommend AS IS, though I've seen some custom ones I may try too.

I made these as is except I used vodka since we were out of whiskey. I also didn't put the full amount of liquid smoke in it. I wasn't sure if I would like it. They were tender and the sauce was delicious. I am using the leftover sauce tonight for bbq chicken. It takes some time to make the sauce but most things I had except for the liquid smoke. I will definitely make again only double the sauce for future use.

Oh my gosh, these are some of the best ribs I've ever had.  I grew up in KY and live in TX, so I know my ribs :) I leapt at these when I saw the recipe included bourbon (whiskey).  They are falling off the bone, flavorful...amazing! I will make this again and again.

OK. I've lived all over north America and I've had ribs just about everywhere. This recipe is the best I've ever eaten - and I made them myself! I can't believe they came out of my oven! Thank you so much for the great recipe! It'll be used again and again!

This was okay.  I was really disappointed after reading all of the positive reviews.  This sauce really doesn't have anything special to it.  I was hoping that it might be as good as Stubb's hickory bourbon sauce but it is nowhere close.  This was too sweet and really didn't have the zip that we were looking for.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I'm sorry, I know I'm in the minority but this tasted exactly like a for-the-masses sauce that you'd get at a rib joint.  I won't make it again.  The cooking instructions for the ribs were spot on.  I did take some reviewers' advice to add some water to each rib packet and was glad that I did.  Our ribs were very tender although not close to falling off of the bone.

I'm rating the cooking technique only since I have a dry rub and barbecue sauce already.  These turned out perfectly!  I highly recommend this cooking method!  The ribs were tender but stayed on the bone for easy grilling.  I brushed on the sauce, flipped the racks a few times to get the grill marks and they were done!   YUM!   Thanks Scott!  This is the only way I'll cook babyback ribs again!

All I did was marinate the ribs for about 5 hours in a store bought sauce, bake for 2 1/2 hours @ 350 degrees.  Tossed on the grill for 2 minutes each side and my husband praised me once he took a bite.  It is so rare to hear praise for my cooking from the worlds worst critic.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!   Will use again, might even try to make the sauce next time.

This sauce was ok.  I didn't feel it was worth the raves it was getting.  Way too many ingredients for a so-so sauce.  Too smokey for my taste and not enough BBQ tang to the flavor.  Now I have to figure out what to do with the whiskey I have left over....on the upside, baking the ribs first was a very good idea and made for some very nice, tender ribs.

I made the sauce and let the ribs marinate in that for 24 hours.Then we just cooked them on the grill, indirect heat for 1 hour, then brushed remaining sauce over them and moved them to direct heat.  They were very good.  Next time I will cook them in the oven as stated in the recipe then on the grill, as I think they would be a little more tender that way, but they were good this way too.

Super recipe!! Thanks. I also slow cook my ribs, without sauce, but with the seasonings for a few hours on the grill, but with indirect heat, either on the charcoal grill or the gas grill. Heat the grill ahead, then turn off one side of the grill, turn the other side to low or push all your coals to one side of the grill putting the ribs on the non-heated side, and you can cook them and flip them to your hearts content and then they get that grilled to perfection flavor! Also, spritzing them down occasionally with a bottle half-full of apple juice keeps them moist during this long grilling process. The meat will start to pull away from the bones on the ends about half an inch or so, and as you flip them, they will start to pull apart. That's your signal to start saucing! Turn up the heated side or add more charcoal to medium heat. For the last half hour of grilling, slather on the sauce, still on the indirectly heated side as you don't want your precious commodity to burn. Trust me, this extra effort of grilling on medium indirect heat will be the difference. Again, great recipe. Lip-smacker!!!

The ribs were excellent - absolutely the best way to cook them.  They fell off the bone.  The sauce was okay, but I didn't put in the liquid smoke or whiskey (didn't have either on hand).  I will try this sauce recipe again with those ingredients.  The ribs were very tender and melted in your mouth.  They were excellent.  Thanks for sharing.

THE RIBS WERE FALL OFF THE BONE TENDER.  HOWEVER, I DID NOT CARE AS MUCH FOR THE BBQ SAUCE.  WE DID HALF THIS RECIPE AND HALF A STORE BOUGHT HICKORY BRAND.  THE HICKORY WAS MUCH BETTER.  I AM SHARING  THIS RECIPE WITH EVERYONE I KNOW.  YOU GOT TO TRY IT.  ENJOY!

O-M-G!!!!!!!! This was OUT OF THIS WORLD DELICIOUS! When I took the ribs out of the oven the meat was already so tender! The sauce was more than enough and it was sooooooo yummy. Our dinner conversation totally ceased because we were all too busy eating the ribs and enjoying. This was finger lickin' good! Thank you for the post from our very full and happy family here in the Smoky Mountains :-)

This knocked our socks off! Got a new grill so I felt like pulling out all the stops and this recipe did that for me, best sauce I have ever made- will never stray. I was faithful with one exception- I didn't have liquid smoke on hand so I substituted smoked chipolte tabasco- it added another small dimension to the already pleasantly complex flavors.

Rock on. This will be recreated for the big party!

*note~ after several months a new family favorite is precooking chicken sprayed with high temp cooking oil, rubbed with lemon pepper and scant salt 1hr in 250 oven and bbq with this sauce...delicious!

Summer is finally here and the other day for convenience I purchased and heated some pre-cooked ribs from the local supermarket.  Mid chew, my young son turned and told me how gross they were and asked that next time I make ‘that other recipe’... this is that recipe and a double batch is now simmering on the stove...

Easy and delicious!  I didn't have any liquid smoke and that was okay as it's a distinct flavor not everyone may enjoy.  The sauce was delicious and the ribs tender.  I look forward to making ribs again, soon, since these were a hit with the family!

Sooooo stupid good!  Loved the flavor of this sauce.  The ribs just fell off the bones due to the low heat and long cook time.  Also, I should've miced the onion up a little more finely than I did, my error.  They were a little bigger chucks than would have been ideal, so make sure you don't make my mistake.  Still amazing overall!

Never prepared and cooked ribs before and this was so easy to do.
It was a big hit with my guests on two occasions and I have passed the recipe on to friends!
I watched a utube piece on how to remove the membrane from the ribs and that was time consuming but easy too!  
I made the sauce once with smoke and once without - both were delicious.
I prepared 4 whole racks of ribs (feeds 8-10 people) and then cooked them for 2hrs and 15 slowly as per the recipe.  I then coated them in a little of the sauce and froze them once cool.
You just defrost, and flip them on the BBQ for a few minutes each side having coated on more sauce.  They just fall off the bone and are delicicous!

Yes I have tried them and they are very good. My wife don't eat ribs but she tried them for the first time and she loved them. I did leave one ingredient the smoke flavoring because she don't care for smoke.

I have been using recipes off this site for nearly 8 years, but this is the first time I have felt strongly enough about a recipe to actually rate and review. This was my first time making ribs and they turned out perfectly, best ribs I've ever had and best sauce ever. I followed the recipe exactly, though I doubled the sauce.

Look no further for a rib and sauce recipe.  This is the best! I doubled the sauce recipe and used it on chicken the next day.  So good.  The meet is tender and falls right off the bone. Several other reviews say the sauce took longer to thicken, and I agree.  It was closer to two hours.  These ribs will be made again soon! When my guests arrived, they couldn't wait to eat because it smelled so good. Try these!!

These are the BEST ribs I have EVER had!! I found and made this recipe in 2008 for friends. We were all amazed at the brilliant flavor, especially considering I'd never made ribs before. When I picked up my first rib the bone pulled cleanly up from the plate leaving all of the super tender meat in place! I have been searching for this recipe for the last few years to share with my family. This will be a wonderful New Year's Day meal for us. Thank you Scott!!

Grrreat! Falloff the bone, finger lickin good! So simple too! Wasn't sure if chili pepper was cayenne or not so sprinkled some chili powder and cayenne on the ribs before putting in foil. It added some added flavour to the ribs that only salt and peppers would? If you use only cayenne, it could be a bit spicy for people not used to heat. I loved the sauce as is, however again, depending on some, could be a touch tangy so suggest using cider vinegar instead. This a keeper that I will make again and again and again!

What a find!!!  these were the BEST ribs I have ever cooked.  Soooo easy to prepare & cook.  Just putting them on the grill for a few minutes was great.  Used everything but the molasses because I didn't have any.  Just used a little more honey, but next time would definitely use it.    The sauce is great.  What a wonderful recipe!!!

Rib lovers, these are SPECTACULAR! I typically do not follow recipes…especially ones that contain the word, "amazing" in the title. We are a huge rib-loving family, and I tried this recipe, as it had so many very positive reviews. Well, not only is the rib baking (prior to finishing on the grill) quite efficient, but the BBQ sauce is amazing. I do not keep liquid smoke, onion powder and molasses in my kitchen, and so omitted them both times I've made this. Still, we all agree..this is the BEST rib recipe, and I will continue to make this.

These ribs were absolutely amazing! I left out the liquid smoke as some reviewers suggested. The recipe called for a lot of ingredients but other than that it was straight forward and simple. I made them for my family and we all thought they were better than most restaurant ribs. We couldn't stop eating them! Highly, highly recommended!

I made this and my husband and parents were sceptical but they love it so much so I used the left over sauce to use on another type of beef. The key really is cooking the ribs prior to putting on grill.

Thank you Scott David Hibbard!  Simple preparation and perfectly balanced BBQ sauce.  Small effort and excellent results.  I erred on the sweet side when measuring the brown sugar, molasses, and honey, and cut back on the chili powder to make a more kid-friendly version.  The slow baking gives a very tender result.  This has become one of my family's favorite recipes.

This recipe was terrific, the meat was perfectly tender, and the sauce was great.  Once finished with the sauce I separated into two containers and added crushed red pepper to one for additional heat. The kick really added something.  My young girls even enjoyed it with the sweet sauce.   Came out very nice.  I also chose not to use the liquid smoke, never had much luck with it.

Absolutely delicious!  My girlfriend and I have made these twice in a couple of weeks and we love them!  Very tender and the sauce is amazing!  This is a real crowd-pleaser.

best ribs hands down, they are incredible! I used pork side ribs instead because they are meatier (and were on sale) and I used them before as well, and they come out fall off the bone ready. The BBQ sauce...the BEST i've ever had, better then any bottled sauce ever. My dad (who calls himself the BBQ master) says these are hands down the best ribs he's ever had! I would give this recipe an A+++++++++

Holy Smokes - never have I had such compliments.  Even the next day my husband and father were talking about how good this was.  I didn't do baby backs, but did spare ribs with the exact recipe above.  That sauce... oh, that sauce.  I will never buy a bottle of bbq sauce again.

I admit I am not a good cook, so I was looking for something easy with plenty of good reviews, that hopefully I couldn't mess up.  I made these for Father's Day and I made him one happy Daddy! The sauce was EXCELLENT!!  I made a few slight changes. I left out the smoke and cut back slightly on the chili powder.  I used chopped garlic instead of garlic powder, and used a whole medium onion in EVOO instead of vegetable oil. I also only had on hand apple vinegar, so I used that.  The ribs just fell off the bone and the taste was out of this world!!!  They were so good, I'm making them again this weekend for his parents!! He never wants ribs other than this way, ever again!!! Going to make double the sauce the next time and put on chicken!!!

Just made this recipe Saturday night and it was a HUGE hit!  We got ribs in Arkansas that were supposedly the best ribs ever, but everyone said these were the best!  Fell right off the bone!  Thanks for the great recipe, Scott.  Will definitely make these again (soon)!

This recipe was very good and I will replace my previous rib recipe with this one. I cut down on the spice to suit my family's tastes and added a wee bit more whiskey.

Served these at a grill-out for about 20 people. Did these ribs and Pretty Chicken marinade(also from this site). Everything was a huge hit. Followed the recipe exactly....made double. This sauce is so easy and so delicious......everyone raved.

These ribs were fantastic. I've never made baby backs before so I didn't know what to expect from this method, baking them first, but they were very tender and practically fell off the bone.  I had about 3.3 lbs of ribs, but I made the full amount of sauce so we had extra for dipping.  Also, for the ground red chile pepper, I used dried peppers from our garden last year that we dried and crushed.  So the ribs were pleasantly spicy, not as sweet as I've had with bottled sauce.  I had a lot of sauce left over and will try using it on other meats.  It's the star of the recipe!

Only made the sauce. Out of honey so skipped. Instead of 1/2 T of cayenne I used 1.5 t of chili flakes. Was just right. I used this on country style pork ribs. Used Hog Rub and Yard Bird and let them sit overnight. Smoked in stovetop smoker. Cooled. Broiled with sauce on low.  Delish!

This is definitely 5 star!! My husband thinks these are the best ribs he ever had! My boys love them too! As another reviewer, I don't like liquid smoke so I left it out and I too used the rib rub recipe from the Prize Winning Baby Back Ribs. This recipe is a keeper!! Love it! Thanks for sharing Scott Hibbs!

These are delicious! And not hard to make at all. The only disappointment though is that they were NOT spicy enough. Other than that the flavour was delicious! my boyfriend said they were the best ribs he's ever had. As for me, a little too mild for my taste.

Truly outstanding rib recipe. The bones easily pulled away from the meat and the sauce was wonderful. Careful with the spice. I only used about half of the ground red and the sauce still had a kick.

The sauce was amazing, but was pretty intense to make. It was my first time making ribs and they turned out perfect. my only disappointment was not having more ribs to use all the extra sauce!

Falls off the bone! Wrap it in a bunch of foil so it seals in the juices. 3.5 hours in the oven plus a quick 8 minutes on the grill. Be careful when you grill them because the meat may fall off the bone into the the fire. Almost happened to me. Next time I'm trying the BBQ sauce recipe.

great recipe!! i baked the ribs for 1 1/2 hours instead of 2 1/2 as I was afraid they would get overdone and be dry. was a little bit spicey for us, so next time I will cut back on the ground red chili pepper. We had quite a bit of sauce left over, so we grilled some chicken breasts the next day and used the sauce. overall a tasty recipe-thanks! YUM!

AWESOME - These were some of the best ribs I have ever cooked. 
I only cooked one slab for two people so I cut the recipe in half. I cooked the sauce down for 45 min. since I had less of it. Everything worked out Perfect. Thank You for the recipe.

This has been my favorite ever! I used maple syrup instead of honey because I couldn't find where the kids put the honey. Used 1/3 c apple cider vinegar, no liquid smoke, and tomato sauce with less water. Baked for the 2 1/2 hours at 300 on the Traeger and then went to put on the grill and they were already falling off the bones! 
The homemade sauce- when I first got it going, I wasn't thinking I'd like it. After it sat for the hour or so- I LOVED it. I'll use the leftover on chicken tonight. Awesome recipe! So glad to have found it since baby back ribs aren't cheap!

I'm not a rib eater until I tried Delishous Heights Danish Baby Back Ribs.  Now I crave them.  I was looking for a sauce that wasn't red but a deep sweet brown with bite.  This recipe does the trick!  A few changes.  I didn't add smoke or molassas only because I didn't have any.  Instead of 1/2 c brown sugar I added 1 1/2 cups.  Instead of 1/2 tsp of red pepper, I added over 1 tsp.  I also added about 1 tsp of garlic powder.  I used tomato sauce, about a cup, instead of tomato paste (just because I didn't have any).  I'm currently cooking and I can't help eat the sauce.  It's really wonderful.  Oh, like a previous post, I put the onions in a small food procesor to get them cut up really fine and probably used a bit more that 1/2 cup.  Really, just a small onion.
I love love love this find.  Great recipe Scott and thank you for sharing.

I followed this recipe very closely and although it was good, I thought it was too tomato tasting and didn't have enough zip.  I will admit that the ribs themselves were moist and tender.

Everyone in our family enjoyed the ribs including our 2 year old son.  We made two versions...  One according to the recipe and one with just a touch of cayenne pepper.

Amazing flavor, my family LOVED it. The ribs cooked in the aluminum foil made the ribs fall off the bones. I didn't use the grill. I drained off the fat and opened up the foil and poured the sauce on them and let them bake in the oven. WOW. SOOO GOOD !!!!!!
thanks Scott for this great recipe   tgonzalez

The sauce definately took me longer than 20 minutes to prepare but sooooo worth it.  Best rib sauce ever!  We tried half the batch wrapped in foil and half without on the grill at 200 degrees.  The ribs wrapped in foil were fall off the bone delicious.  I cant say enough good things about this recipe.

I have not made BBQ sauce very often but this one is very good.  I'll be sure to make it again.  It takes a bit more time than buying it but it is well worth the trouble.  Thank you.

These were a hit!  Rather than BBQ I took the ribs out of the foil after about 1 1/2 and started basting them with the sauce in the oven.  After the full cooking time the sauce was fully incorporated into the meat and it was just falling-off-the-bone tender. oh,and I increased the amount of bourbon used to intensify the flavour.  My neighbours said I was torturing them with the smell.

This was very, very good. I only used half of the red pepper called for, as I worried that it might be too spicy for our guests. I got rave reviews on the ribs and sauce. I also used this sauce on BBQ chicken drumsticks. I doubled the sauce so we could use it on the meat once it was cooked. I might tweak this a bit to make it a little less vinegary. Overall, very tasty with a sweet-spicy blend.

Made these for memorial day!  What a hit! I made them exactly as the recipe read.  Absolutely delicious, better than any ribs I've had in a restaurant.  I'm not a big fan of smoked meat, so these were precisely to my liking.

Yummy!  This was my first attempt to make ribs and they turned out delicious!  I cooked for 2 hours in the oven and then grilled for 12 minutes.  Meat fell off the bone!  Did not make any changes to the ingredients.

OMG!  These ribs were phenomenal!  I followed the recipe to a T, didn't change a thing and wouldn't change a thing.  My husband said these were the BEST ribs he's ever had and he's from Texas!!!  Quite the compliment.  Awesome, awesome, awesome!  I will definitely make again.  Thank you Scott!

My boyfriend and I made these one Sunday. They were amazing! Probably one of the best bbq sauces I've ever had and the ribs fell off the bone.  I made a mistake and did not wrap each rack in foil, I just covered the whole pan and it was still great (and maybe a wee bit easier). Will be making again and again! :)

If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would. My fiance loves to grill out on our patio, and he always tells me to look up a new rib recipe for the weekends. I found this, and he actually made it on his day off - it was MARVELOUS! I'm generally a poultry kind of girl, but ribs are a weakness of mine - these are truly the best ribs I've ever had - I ate a full rack! (I was super hungry that day, and it proves how delicious they are!) The only thing we didn't use was the chili pepper - only because we couldn't remember what kind of pepper the recipe called for when we were standing in front of the spices in the grocery store. DELECTABLE either way!

I have cooked a lot of ribs in my life and this was the perfect blend of spice and sweet and tang.  Great recipe.  I modified a little and added more molasses, but very tasty.  Even rib haters loved it.

Had a big summer bbq and these rips were the hit of the day.  I wish I could give you more info but the ribs were gone so fast I barely had a chance to taste a small piece.  That small bit was amazing.  I reduced the heat and baked a little longer, but thats about the only change.  Good stuff.

These are the best ribs ever!  I love to make extra sauce and freeze it.  Also, I usually make the ribs a day ahead of time and then grill them to heat them up.  Yummy!!!

This recipe is awesome!  I actually doubled the honey and molasses and added corn starch after it has been simmered as a thickener.  Anyone who loves grilling should definitely experiment with this recipe.

Amazing!  I have never in my life cooked ribs and these literally fell off of the bone.  They were the best I've ever tasted.  The sauce had lots of ingredients but the prep time was short and then you just had to sit it on the stove and let it reduce so the actual time that you are hand's on is very short.  The sauce was perfect and I would put these ribs and sauce up against any veteran griller.  Ladies, if you want to impress the guys, make this receipe as is and you'll get rave reviews even if you've never attempted ribs before either!

Gotta say I have been looking a long time for a recipe that rivals my brother's who is a master bbq-er.  Has won numerous contests including American Royal!  This is IT!  The best sauce I have tasted bar none!  I followed recipe and added hot pepper flakes to the sauce to spice it up.  My hubby asked if my brother had brought the ribs over.  Now THAT'S a compliment!!  Thanks for this great recipe!

This sauce is TO DIE FOR. You have to give it a try! I seasoned my ribs with Jacks Old South seasoning instead of just salt and pepper, for a little more kick. You can read about it and see pics on my blog Bethcooks.

Scott - these are amazing. Made exactly as called for. My wife had seconds and she doesn't generally like any meats that aren't white ;-) My son is going to get to try them when he visits in a couple of weeks and I know there will be another convert. Thanks.

The ribs were SO tender it was amazing but this is because of the cooking process and length of time. The sauce however...not that great. Although it was better the second day probably because it had soaked into the the meat more. Krafts original bbq sauce is just as good so save yourself the 2 HOURS of making the sauce.

These are the best ribs I have ever made.  My wife described it as the bone falling of the meat.  Few minor modifications.  Was a hit with the kids and the adults.  I will be cooking it again this weekend.

I made these ribs for Father's Day for about 30 people, and they were a HUGE hit! I needed a great recipe, seeing that I'm a vegetarian, wasn't too sure how to pull it off. The only thing I changed, was omitting the whiskey, and used white wine vinegar instead of regular white vinegar.

Excellent end to our July 4th weekend.  We added 2 chopped fresh jalepeno peppers to the onions saute for a little kick. Also substituted extra brown sugar because we did not have molasses.

The first time I made this I followed it exact.  My grandfather does not like spicy food so the second time I made it for Father's Day I omitted the Chili Pepper and doubled the brown sugar.  It was a hit!

Awesome awesome awesome!!!  Didn't have tomato paste so used catsup, but don't think it made much difference overall.  I always used to simmer my ribs before grilling, but this is my new way.  Thanks so much for my new house special!!

Fantastic!  I made the sauce the day before (change of plans - we ended up having meatloaf instead of the ribs), so I has sampled a little bit then - only change was to sub 1 tbsp of Worcestershire with soy sauce (ran out of Worcestershire).  I sampled a little sauce on my meatloaf and it was so good!  A prefect balance of sweet, tangy with just a bit of heat.  Today I cooked the ribs and they were just phenomenal!  They disappeared as soon as I set them on the table - tender fall-off-the-bone meat, sweet and tangy sauce...everyone loved them! We'll definitely make this recipe again!

The cooking method is perfect. Don't even doubt it, just do it as written. My husband thought I had it backwards, and he was super surprised when he bit into these ribs. Actually, as soon as he saw them the first words out of his mouth were "wow, those look amazing." They tasted great and were so easy, I can't imagine spending big bucks on ribs at restaurants ever again.

Made these for a Memorial Day camping trip this year - precooked them in the oven, cooled them & put in zipper bags to put in the ice chest.  At camp I put them on the grill & basted with the sauce (didn't have the whiskey on hand so omitted it & it was still GREAT).  EVERYONE loved them!! Thanks!

The sauce is amazing.  Tastes a lot like the Jack Daniels sauce @ TGI Fridays.  The meat was perfectly tender.

I had never cooked ribs before and decided to try these based on all the reviews.  It turned out fantastic.  I had a hard time cutting them up because the meat was falling of the bone with the slightest pressure.  It started out as kind of the hidden secret on the table and ended up with everyone needing extra napkins.  I double the recipe due to the number of people and it came out great.

Oh, my goodness.  These ribs were absolutely marvelous, fall off the bone tender and the sauce brought the house down.  Of course, it didn't hurt that I used Glenfiddich and about 4 times the suggested amount.  All good, believe me!  My brother called me at 8:20 the next morning pleading for more!

The sauce was amazing, the cooking of the ribs didn't compare, however. I think the oven time is too long perhaps? I followed the recipe exactly as written and the ribs were overcooked, not burned but almost no texture.

Spectacular! Best baby backs I've made in years.  Very easy just put them in the oven for a couple of hours, then grille for a few...manged to entertain my guests all the while..everyone was raving about them as they licked their fingers.  I made eight pounds of ribs and there wasn't one left.  Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper.

I made these ribs tonight and they were delicious!  They were incredibly tender and the sauce was amazing.  I didn't have tomato paste so I used canned tomatoes and just let it cook down a bit longer.  I will definitely make them again!

Wow!  Excellent, falling off the bone ribs.  I'll cut back on the ground red pepper next time.

I made this exactly as the recipe called for with exception to the ribs. I used boneless pork spareribs and they were so tender, they were falling apart on the grill. I made this for ten people and everybody came back for seconds and they all wanted the recipe. I still have some of the sauce and have paired it with Turkey Burgers and Tri-tip, awesome!  I think I will try it on ice cream next..... just kidding!! Thanks Scott!!!

I put the ribs in a crock pot on low for 9.5 hours then let them sit for 10 minutes before putting them on the grill. I substituted items for the sauce that I didn't have. Ketchup for tomato paste. Red Wine vinegar for white vinegar. I also thickened it with 1 T. corn starch and 1/4 cup of cold water to eliminate the 1 1/4 hour simmer time. It was fantastic!! Thank You, Scott Hibb's! Until now I have never been successful making Baby Back Ribs. Definately a keeper and soon to be a family and company favorite!

The sauce is excellent and the cooking method is spectacular!  I left out the cayenne on 2 of the half racks and loaded it on the other 2 based on preferences.  I didn't change the sauce but inadvertently added more worcestershire thinking it was the liquid smoke.  It didn't matter, the ribs were so tender and the sauce was perfectly tangy, smokey, sweet and spicey (but not too spicey for my in-laws).  Wrapping the ribs in foil was so easy and I did other things while the ribs and sauce cooked.  Thank you Scott for sharing!!!

These are simply the best.  The second time we tried them we decided to use Baby Rays...big mistake.  The sauce is the best and the meat falls off the bone!!!

Excellent as reviewed by others.  Didn't have the liquid smoke but it worked just as well.  Put it in the broiler on high instead of the bbq and that worked too.  Will definitely be used for the next bbq pork rib recipe.  thank you!

AWESOME sauce! I have made this sauce several times with no changes and it comes out finger lickin good every time! I make my own rub for the ribs (smoked paprika, cumin, chili powder, dark brown sugar, red pepper flakes, soul seasoning) wrap in foil as recipe states and they are fall off the bone DELICIOUS!! Rave reviews from family and friends...always have to double/triple the sauce. Can never make just 2 lbs...usually have to make 6-8 slabs!!

These were the best ribs I've ever made (possibly had). Fantastic sauce.  Unfortunately, I didn't have access to a BBQ but my oven broiler worked fine.

I made this for my wife and I last night and we both agreed that they were the best ribs we have ever eaten.  She thought they were a little bit too spicy, but I thought the heat was a nice balance to the sweetness.

This review is for the sauce only.  Instead of ribs I used it on "BBQ Pork for Sandwiches" that I also found on this site.  I found the sauce to be easy to make and tasty, but not spectacular.  This being my first time making bbq sauce from scratch I'm willing to concede that the fault may lie with my ingredients and technique rather than the recipe.  Precise ingredients were: yellow onion, white wine vinegar, hickory liquid smoke, old grand dad whisky, and cayanne pepper.  I simmered the recipe for the full time indicated but it reduced to nearly a paste.  My burner has 11 settings, I began on #3 and half way through reduced to setting #2.  Despite its' thickness there was enogh sauce to throughly coat the pork so maybe the thickness was correct.  I'll give this recipe another shot, but I do wonder if the same taste couldn't be achieved with fewer than 16 ingredients.

This is our second time making this...we put it over ribs the first time and they were wonderful.  We don't keep alcohol in the house so we used maple syrup and vanilla (3:1)  it was amazing.  It is important to let it simmer down for the amazing flavors.  We liked the sauce so much we put it over a beef roast in the crockpot and make bbq beef sandwiches with it the second time. We will continue to make this over and over.

I followed the recipe exactly as written but I pulled the ribs out of the oven after 2 1/2 hours and coated them with the sauce and returned to the oven for another 45 minutes.  The meat completely fell off the bones!  It was sooo good.

extremely excellent!  Everyone licked the bones clean!  I mixed all ingredients together while ribs were cookin except for oil and onions and whisked it all together and let sit i do believe that if you do this would be advantageous if you make sauce and let sit before cookin it with oil and onions but other wise was very good sauce was excellent

I used this recipe the first time I ever made ribs and they were fantastic -- I continue to use this recipe.  I do not add liquid smoke because I don't like the flavor.  I used cayenne pepper when it calls for red chile pepper (i assume they are the same since ground cayenne is a ground red chile??) which gives the sauce a spicy zing.  Obviously, cut back on the cayenne if you don't like spicy.

I have never cared for ribs, but because my husband and family is such a fan I thought I would give them a try.  I'm a rib convert!  These are fantastic!  And the sauce might be the best part.  I now make this sauce everytime we use bbq sauce.  In the sauce, the smaller you dice the onions, the better.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

These really are AMAZING.. Just like the title says... I am extremely picky when it comes to ribs, I made these for our housewarming party and every single person there had second, and third, and even fourth helpings of these 9including myself) Everyone from my sister, to my mother in law was asking for the recipe! I will forever be known as Queen of the Ribs thanks to this recipe!

I'm just reviewing the cooking technique since I used my own sauce.  Because the of the low and slow cooking in the oven, they came out so tender and juicy it was amazing.  I also used a dry rub before cooking them and then applied the wet rub when I put them on the grill.  Also if you have a membership get your ribs from somewhere like Costco, we got three racks of ribs for $20 bucks!!

Dont be afraid of the chilly powder. I made it three times before I worked up enough courage to follow the directions and it's the best I've ever tasted. The sauce also makes a fantastic pulled pork

Lip Smackin good! I didn't have on hand or miss the Whisky or Liquid Smoke. Because I prefer onion crunchy I added it raw as it softens a bit during the thickening process anyway but still keeps the crunch I like. I also doubled the onion amount. I just cut a medium onion and when it was double the amount I decided to throw it into the sauce. It did not overpower the flavors at all. I also added a Tsp of Asian Chili Garlic sauce instead of flakes for a little extra kick. I normally would have finished off the cooking process on the barbecue  but it's pouring rain out today here in New Hampshire. I finished them off in the oven and they couldn't have been more tender! I admit I loveeeeeed the sauce so much I was a bit too liberal in applying it to the ribs. My son called me on that one and he was 100% right! I never have Whiskey in the house but I can't imagine the two tsp that are missing would make a significant improvement. Love the method of cooking and the sauce is definitely a keeper. Might throw the sauce on Chicken next time and throw it on the barbie...Scott thanks for a great recipe and don't be shy to offer up a few more of your favorites!

I was nervous about the sauce and the method of cooking but I have to admit  these ribs were fantastic.  The sauce might use a little adjustment for my taste but these were the most tender ribs I've ever made that didn't come from the crockpot.  I don't give 5 stars all that often.  These were at least 5 stars though.  AWESOME!!!

This cooking method creates perfectly tender ribs that come off the bone easily but don't fall apart during serving, and the sauce is fantastic (even if I did omit the liquid smoke). Thanks for sharing, tsgma!

I threw a huge BBQ for my daughters 25th birthday.I follwed this recipe to a tee except that after I baked the ribs, I allowed them to cool completely then before putting them on the BBQ I put them in my smoker for 1-1/2 hours over Hickory Chips.I used the exact same recipe for my chicken wings and also smoked them too. everyone raved about both. Ive already been asked to do these ribs at our next family birthday. like one reader  stated the sauce is time consuming to make, but its worth it, and once youve tried it , its hard to go back to any other.

YUM!  These were amazing!  I have never made ribs or my own BBQ sauce before, and these were definitely a hit.  I skipped the whiskey because I didn't have it, and the sauce was great anyway.  This recipe's a keeper!

Best ribs I've ever had. I used side ribs, so I cooked them in the oven a little bit longer. This sauce was so tasty. I will definitely use this recipe again.

The homemade bbq sauce for the ribs was wonderful! Everything turned out perfect. The ribs fell right off the bones and were just as good as any you get in a restaurant! Thanks for the recipe!

Wowee!  This is an awesome recipe!  Followed exactly as written except cut down quite a bit on chili powder as my family can be wimps when it comes to spicy.  The meat just fell off the bones.

Excellent for pork or chicken.  I made 2 gallons for a 20# case of pork ribs.  i simmered it down longer than what the recipe called for, chilled it for a day before i used it.  The sauce had good consistancy. It was not too thick and not too transparent, it was just sweet enough, a little tangy, and s hint of spicy.

This was such an awesome recipe!!! I've never made homemade BBQ sauce before & I was a little worried but was feeling adventurous & wanted to try it since it had soo many great reviews & just plain sounded yummy!! I made the recipe exactly as called for but I did mine in the slow cooker. I made the sauce a day before hand & then marinated the ribs in it to give it more flavor soaked into the meat & make for an easy dinner the next night. Then the next day I put it in the slow cooker on low for the day. By lunch time when I came home to check on it the meat was falling off the bone already!! It was absolutley delicious!!! Almost as good as going out to the resturant! The only advice I have for doing it next time is I think I'll bake the ribs for about 10 min or so before I put them in the slow cooker cause the BBQ sauce was a little thinner than I liked & I think it was the grease from the ribs. So next time I'll cook them a little bit to get the grease out then slow cook them, that is the way to go to get that fall off the bone taste!!!! Great recipe I'll be using this from now on!!!!!

My husband has been wanting to do ribs since we got our new grill. I am honestly not a huge fan, but wanted to please my man. We decided on this recipe and I can say that I am not a fan of Ribs. We made them exactly as stated, except leaving out the onion powder because we didn't have any! The sauce was fantastic. As said, I am not a BBQ person, and I truly loved the sauce. The ribs were falling off the bone. We doubled the sauce as recommended, and we have plenty leftover after 2 racks of ribs.  I am a fussy eater and an accomplished cook, and I recommend this recipe. It was REALLY good. Thanks!!!

These ribs ROCK! I did however use spare ribs as I was making for a crowd and it was more cost efficient. They were AWESOME!! This will be in our bbq rotation.........no doubt! Everyone loved the sauce and the ribs were sooooooooo tender!Yummy!!

Yummy!  I made the recipe as posted but changed the servings to 10.  Make sure you don't triple the sauce recipe as you will have tons left over.  The ribs were a huge hit and I will definitely make again!

THE BEST RIBS I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE! Started them the night before by peeling off the membrane, rubbing them down with 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar + 1 ts liquid smoke... This really tenderizes your rib meat. Then rubbed them down with AR's Wally's Rib Rub (with a few personal modifications), double wrapped them in foil, frige overnight. Then picked up with this recipe... The only things I changed were to use 1/4c apple cider and 1/4c white vinegar, and I upped it to 2 tb whiskey... Didn't seem enough to me. Simmered about 2 hrs... This sauce is PERFECT rib sauce- since it's tomato PASTE based (rather than a tomato sauce/ketchup based sauce) it gets thick and coats to the ribs PERFECTLY. And it caramelizes on the grill... SO GOOD! For an 'everyday' BBQ sauce, I prefer AR's Big Al's KC Sauce, but I've got to give it up to this one for grilling ribs. I've tried MANY methods and sauces for ribs, slow cooker, oven, grill, and this is THE ONE. I will NEVER cook ribs another way! Quality of meat makes a HUGE difference when it comes to ribs though, so be picky... And wear a bib =) ***UPDATE: Did the exact same method (Wally's Rub, Scott's sauce + oven/grill) on a pork loin and it was FANTASTIC! Not AS good as the ribs, but not much is! Healthier though... Gonna do it with chicken breast tonight... That makes 3 nights in a row using this method/sauce, it's that good!

These WERE amazing!!  We're novice rib cookers and they turned out great.  I also cut the water back to 1 cup and used chili powder as that's what was on hand.  Not spicy, but we loved it this way.  Thanks for a great recipe, Scott!!

Superb way to cook the ribs. I did not make the actual marinade but oven cooked ribs for 2 1/2 hours prior to grilling made the most tender ribs I have ever tasted. Everyone comments how delicious they were and asked how to get the meat to "fall of the bone. I am heavy handed with the chilli powder on ribs with salt and pepper for the oven and added Jack Daniels BBQ sauce for the grill. Have cooked them this way many times since and always perfect.

I have made these several times now.  I had never made ribs before so was thrilled when my New Years Eve crowd went nuts for them.  I baked them early in the day and refrigerated them in the foil tehn grilled them 15 minutes before guests arrived.  What a wonderful recipe.

Great cooking technique.  Used Beef Ribs and Country Pork Ribs and they were amazingly tender.  Will use again and again.  Used a different technique on the baby backs and they turned out lousy.  Should have put it all in the oven.  Thanks for the recipe.

Incredible!!!  My first attempt at BBQ ribs got rave reviews from everyone at the Memorial Day picnic! The sauce is awesome, just spicy enough. As for the ribs I confess, I combined your recipe with some others and made Emeril's Creole spice rub and marinated overnight, baked for 3+ hrs., then slathered in the yummy bbq sauce and grilled over indirect heat to finish them off...(I had to put the pan I baked them in on the grill since the ribs were so tender then fell apart when I tried to move them!) Thanks for sharing!

We loved this recipe. The flavor is great! I changed it a bit by marinading the meat in a dry rub overnight, then baked it in a pan with 1/2 cup water and covered with foil in a 325 degree oven for about 2 1/2 hours (or until tender). Then, slathered the ribs with the sause and baked another 20 minutes at 400. In addition, I added a extra tablespoon of whiskey and cut back a bit on the red pepper. YUM!!!

I had to substitute ketchup for the tomato paste and water. Flavour is great. Will definately make again. Worth the effort to make homemade bbq sauce!

Some of the best ribs I have ever had!  Without a doubt the best I have ever made.  The directions on this recipe are flawless.  These things just fall off the bone.  The sauce in delicious.  The only thing I do to change it is add a few more tablespoons of whiskey and add 3 cloves of chopped garlic to oil with the onions.

Very good sauce. But the cooking method is the real cincher. It made the ribs very tender. So basically you can use any sauce you want after cooking the ribs. I did have to add another 15-20 minutes to make sure the sauce was thick and not soupy, so it took about 2 hours to make. My fiance LOVED it. Paired with the tender ribs it was a definate hit in our house. We will be making again!!

It was not bad but didn't have enough "oomph" for me.  I followed the directions precicely.  After tasting it, I added some liquid smoke and cayenne pepper and was MUCH happier with it.

My husband's favorite recipe.  Make sure the foil is tight around the ribs.  I put them in a loose, foil bag once, and they weren't as juicy as usual.

Great recipe! I did use double the whiskey and used ground habanero pepper instead of the red chile. Was HOT but my family loved it!

Absolutely fabulous!  I served this to the in-laws and the dinner table went totally silent.  Everyone was too busy eating to talk.  And that's a first!  I used chipotle peppers in adobo sauce instead of the liquid smoke and the chili pepper for mild smokey heat.  Didn't have any whiskey so I left it out.  I had leftover sauce which I plan to use on grilled chicken tonight.  Without question, these were the best ribs I've made!  Thanks for the recipe!

Great ribs!  I used the dry rub from 'prize winning ribs' from this site and followed Scott's recipe exactly.  The method of cooking these ribs was awesome, easy and delicious.  I really liked the sauce, but it seemed that it was lacking a layer of flavor- I'm not sure what - but I'll experiment to find out.  I think that I need some more kick- my husband suggested that we used more whisky or use burbon and a little less tomato.  I think it would be good with a little more spice- maybe a few good shakes of chipolte tabsaco would be good.....In any case, thanks for a great recipe!  We loved it!  Plus, the ribs looked like they had been styled for a photo shoot- picture perfect!!!!!!

I thought about taking the easy way out with a bottled sauce but I had the time so I tried this recipe.....absolutely awesome!  The ribs fell right off the bone and the sauce had just enough kick.  I will definitely make this again very soon - great for a summer picnic.

My husband and our guests dubbed these "better than any ribs you'd get in a restaurant"!  We used one of our favorite dry rubs on the ribs and wrapped them in tin foil and let them sit in the fridge overnight.  We loved how tender they were following this cooking technique, but didn't care for the sauce recipe all that much.  I would have liked to have tasted the whiskey more and it was overall just not worth the effort. The cooking technique is amazing though...the only way we'll make ribs from now on!

These weren't the absolute best ribs I've ever had (hence, the 4 star rating) but were very good. I substituted red pepper flakes in place of the ground red chili pepper.

Oh man, these were the best ribs ever. The sauce was awesome. I didn't have whiskey and I live in a dry county so all I had was some Presedente brandy I really want to try the sauce with the whiskey now! Thank you so much for the recipe and making me a big hit in the kitchen!

On this New Years weekend I used this recipe twice. Saying my guests raved is putting it mildly. Thank you for an easy no mess very delicous recipe Scott Hibb. If you don't try any other recipe please try this one. I want to try this on chicken also.

No need to change anything!  I cooked mine in the oven and froze them since I didn't need them for a few days.  Let them sit out of the freezer for a few hours, and they were ready to go!  Great recipe!  Thanks!

I brought these to an outdoor party. I made the sauce the night before, baked them at home the day of and finished them off at the party. Word got out how good they were (I had made enough for my husband and I) and everybody wanted to taste them. I'm emailing the recipe to a few people after I write this. My husband gave me a huge kiss on the lips after he was done dinner - I think there may be something to the saying that the way to man's heart is his stomach. The only thing I may change when I make these again - and I will be making these again - is that I may decrease the chili peppers in the sauce, but that's just my preference because I found them a little spicy. My husband does not want me to change a thing.

This was my first attempt at making ribs and was I impressed with the ease and result of this recipe.  Don't let the length of the ingredient list put you off - each ingredient is worth it!  I did not change a thing and the ribs rivaled any restaurant rib! I also loved the fact that the ribs are prebaked and grilled at the end - making them perfect for entertaining!  THANKS!!!!

Wonderful results... didn't have any whiskey in the house (dry county, too!), but still came out great!  Boyfriend said he didn't know which ones he liked better... these or a dry rub version I make.

These were incredible!! I think next time I'll bake them for 2 hours, I found these burned quite quickly on the grill (without the sauce). The sauce was wonderful!! I did my big grocery shop, and forgot to buy tomato paste. I had to improvise with ketchup. Next time I'll try it the way I'm supposed to.

I also want to say that someone said that liquid smoke should not be used. I disagree. The liquid smoke enhances the flavour, it doesn't overpower it. These were excellent, I would not change one single ingredient!

I'm very much looking forward to making these again. My husband has said that I have found the perfect way to make ribs.

Best ribs I've ever made. To be honest, I used a store-bought BBQ sauce, but the cooking methodology is absolute perfection. Will never deviate from this technique.

Substituted King's Syrup for Molasses, (It's a Southern thing, you may not understand!).  Used Chipotle Chili Powder for the Red Pepper Powder.
These things were awesome!  The sauce is the perfect degree of spiciness, and the ribs DON'T FALL off the bone, they wait for you to take a bite and pull, then they SLIDE easily off the bone.  These were OUTSTANDING!

This is Great BBQ sauce. I made the ribs and they turned out great, but I use the BBQ sauce whenever I need BBQ sauce. I double the recipe every time. The only changes I make is that I use 1 Tbsp minced garlic as well as the garlic powder just cuz I can.  The secret is to let it simmer....and do not taste test this until it's thick and rich.

Best. Sauce. Ever. (Minus the liquid smoke.... Unnecessary.) Everyone says I should open a rib restaurant when I serve these ribs! Making them again tonight. I find it takes almost as long as the ribs to cook down... Convenient!!

superior to all the others online !!! ... Henry McKenna bourbon is the closest to Jameson's Irish whiskey, so if you don't have the expensive Irish go for the American McKenna !!!

My son is learning to cook and found this recipe by himself.  He's never made ribs before, and it took him 30 minutes or so to prep.  Hands down, these are the best homemade ribs we've ever made!

Changes:.  We did the sauce without the whiskey and liquid smoke (I just didn't have them on hand), and we never ended up putting the ribs on the grill (they were already done within 2 hours in the oven, and it was 97° outside!).  The ribs were really good, not falling of the bone, but loose enough to make them easy to eat.

My 13-year-old daughter thought the sauce was too spicy, but my 11 year old son loved it.  I would make the sauce again, but maybe half the recipe and take out some of the heat.  We had a lot of sauce leftover, but the ribs were almost gone!

This was absolutely delicious! Only change I made was to omit the liquid smoke after reading another review. My husband said these were the best ribs he’s ever had! The sauce takes some time to put together but well worth it! I doubled the sauce since I had almost 7 lbs of ribs. I’ll definitely be making these again!!

Really good recipe and we all enjoyed it.  Pretty rela.xed cooking with the pork loin ribs in the oven for 2.5 hours and the BBQ sauce simmering for 1.5 hours.  Will make it again.

Outstanding. I hadn’t made my own bbq sauce before and this turned out awesome. I added some Dales low sodium to override the sweetness. The oven method on the ribs was spectacular.  All my guests raved about the taste and texture of the finished ribs.

This sauce was amazing!! I’ve never made a homemade bbq sauce before so I followed all the directions. I loved that it had a combination of sweet and spicy. Everyone couldn’t stop talking about how good it was and how the meat was just falling off the bones

Tried this for the first time and like most of the comments it was awesome. Made a couple of changes and used 4 fresh garlic cloves instead of powder, used smoked paprika instead of regular to add to the smoke flavour, added some rib spice to them before the oven and put a little extra whiskey then called for. They were very tender but I think I will leave them in the oven for 3 hrs next time to see if that improved even more. Be generous with the sauce on the BBQ. My guests were still asking for more sauce, it was a big hit.

Anyone know how long you can keep this in the fridge or should it be frozen?

Finally a barbeque sauce that doesn't include ketchup!  I love that the recipe as written is delicious but also allows for modifying to your own taste, such as more or less of an ingredient.  I've made this a number of times and usually end up adding double the whiskey because my husband loves the flavour!

I followed the recipe exactly, except I only used 1/4 tsp liquid smoke. When you reduce the sauce all the flavors become much stronger, so adjust spices accordingly. Use NM or  CA chili powder only. Also don’t over-do the onion. I blended the sauce in a blender after it cooled. The key is to use a large sauce pan with more surface area to reduce, and it will thicken after an hour & half at very low heat. This makes a rich Kansas City style sauce. If you want to finish ribs in the oven, you can use the broiler. But set the ribs lower, not too close to the broiler on a baking sheet & heat each side for about 3 mins, watching so you don’t burn it. This recipe is a real gem! Delicious!

Something was off with the flavor for us. Used some cayenne since we like it spicy, but it ended up too hot. Otherwise followed as listed though with fresh garlic rather than garlic powder. Baking the ribs slowly wrapped in foil turned out well, they were very moist and tender. Likely will do that next time with a different sauce.

Followed everything except used 1/4 tsp liquid smoke instead per someone else’s comment.
Wasn’t fall off the bone for me, maybe I undercooked a few minutes? I Did do 2.5 hours @300 degrees 
But sauce was excellent as were the ribs....I will definitely try this again!

I didn't add the liquid smoke, however i rubbed the ribs with cumin as well as the salt and pepper.  So ridiculously good! And I don't eat pork!

Made this a few times now and I must admit its fabulous. I followed the recipe and everything turned out just right. The sauce is the boss on this particular rib recipe.

Anyone that takes the time to make this recipe and doesn't rate it 5-stars is either lying, don't have taste buds, or they didn't follow the instructions! I tripled the recipe and there still were no left overs! I contacted ScottHibb and he said in the past 18 he has altered the recipe slightly, sometimes he leaves out the liquid smoke and adds a few tablespoons of paprika and chili powder, and sometimes minces a few scotch bonnet peppers to give it some kick. I will be trying that next, thanks ScotHibb!

A little too spicy for the kids. Next time will add a different sauce for their rack.

AMAZING! And easy to do. Cooking method works for any ribs, and the sauce we've started adding to other items on the grill as well. Chicken, Steaks., etc.  I did remove the liquid smoke, as I don't care for it.

This is an amazing recipe. Can’t wait to make it again. Didn’t use whiskey. I wondered if the “ground red chile pepper” was really supposed to be “ground red pepper” which is the same thing as cayenne pepper. Apparently it is. I also was amazed at the long list of ingredients but slogged through it and added everything. Instead of liquid smoke I smoked the ribs for one hour before baking. The sauce is the best-tasting barbecue sauce I’ve ever had! It was a nice added touch to pour some sauce on my plate for dipping.

It turned our amazing. Our family had it over Christmas break, the sauce was the best part of this recipe. I used a charchol grill without smoke wood. It tasted great without the fake smoke or even the smoking chips.

This recipe is going to replace my go to rib recipe , they are delicious. I did not change anything but where I live it has been very cold ( -35C ) so not really barbeque weather. I baked in oven as recipe stated but finished them by putting in  a casserole dish and covering them with sauce , baked in oven for about another 30 min. at 350F. when weather warms will definitely do them on the barbeque.

These were good. I was a little alarmed when the sauce reduced to less than one cup, but it turned out to be plenty. 

I followed the instructions almost exactly, but didn't add the liquid smoke (didn't have any) and used white wine vinegar instead of distilled. I didn't add the pepper, either, since we're not thrilled about spicy foods. 

I don't love ribs, which is why I am not giving this five stars. But if I had to make BBQ sauce again, this version is really excellent.

5+ stars! These are the best ribs I ever ate, never mind made myself. I left out the liquid smoke due to personal preference and I guarantee no one would ever have missed it; also swapped out the honey for dark maple syrup and pureed everything with an immersion blender at the end (the tiny pieces of onion do cook down most of the way, but I like a smooth sauce for basting and dipping). Otherwise followed recipe as written. If making for company, make the sauce a day or two ahead. (The only down-side is you pretty much want to fast in anticipation because there will be no leftovers.) This is a real-deal rib recipe and I can't recommend it highly enough. Thank you Scott Hibbard!

The only change I made was to smoke the ribs for two hours on my pellet fuel smoker before I wrapped them in foil and put them in the oven at 285 degrees for the suggested 2 1/2 hours.
They were fall off the bone tender, and the whiskey sauce was delicious.  This was my third time, and I will definitely make them again

Fantastic recipe!  Easy way to make terrific ribs.  I was in a time crunch so I started with dried onions rather than chopping onions.

I cut the recipe in half because it was for just my husband and me. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  Both of us were impressed how tender the pork was and all those flavors blended so well together.  Very tasty.  I'll make this for guests.

These were not hard to make, although planning is needed for the 2.5 hour baking time.  I cut the sugar down and added more whiskey ( a shot glass full).  The ribs were fall off the bone good and everyone commented on the delicious flavor.  I am passing on the recipe to my guests.

I made these tonight. Let me tell you, these ribs are amazing, amd surprisingly easy. I've never made ribs before but decided to try them for my boyfriend for Father's Day. I halved the recipe, since it was just the twoof us eating them. I also didn't have paprika, so I substituted with a pinch of cayenne. I wouldn't change a thing. They fell off the bone and melted in your mouth. We were too impatient to eat, so no pictures sadly.

Better than a bottle!! This was my first time making ribs but they were seriously the best I've ever had. The only changes I made were adding fresh minced garlic to the onions, omitting the liquid smoke and adding seasoning (garlic powder, chili powder & paprika) directly to the ribs before cooking them. They were fall off the bone, finger licking good!!! I did quadruple the recipe, which allowed me to freeze some of the sauce for future use. I will never buy a bottled BBQ sauce again! Thanks for a great recipe!!

These were some outstanding ribs the whole family loved.  Great sauce (I skipped the liquid smoke and red pepper because of my 2 year old) and followed everything else.  The cooking method worked wonderfully.  Will use this as my rib go to recipe.

doubled the tomato paste , decreased the water,  so didn't require as much simmering to cook down. in fact, rolling boil for 15 or so minutes and done. of course i did my own thing with spices, like minced garlic, and lots of tobasco, but basically followed this recipe. very pleased with end result! did take the advice of putting onion in blender.  raw onion and water  in blender at beginning of recipe and never bothered with sauteing it cuz i was low on time.  ****oh, no whiskey on hand, so substituted apple cider vinegar and very pleased with result! Also, not grilling today, so put a few cups of sauce in the crockpot and added pork loin strips (  that I had already browned)  to the sauce, let it cook on low all day. made yummy bbq pulled pork sandwiches  for dinner! will freeze the rest of the sauce for another day!

Delicous, perfect on anything you may think to use it. Once you taste it, you won't be able to stay without it, ever. Since I've found this recipe, I've made the BBQ sauce many and many times. Lately I've started to prepare a lot of it everytime, like 15x to 20x servings, because anybody who taste it, wants some to bring home. I just cut down the chili pepper using very little, and halve the black pepper as here in Italy not many loves too hot souces with pepper taste (or at least that would be the result using the spices I can find here).
Thanks SOOOOO much for this must have recipe.
Oh! By the way, just to reply to whom doesn't like to use liquid smoke (which can also be natural, not necessarily artificial) I say that if you want smoked taste you can use smoked paprika, which gives a very light just perceptible taste, as also black tea made with naturally smoked black tea leafs which will add a very smooth smoked taste. If you will use the tea just remember to make the sauce a little thicker.

This is the best way to do ribs.   I only added a little paprika and cumin to the rub but used the same time and temp.  I changed nothing in the sauce and it has been consistently delicious every time.

These ribs were a hit! I followed this recipe exactly written as should be because if i made any changes to it , it would only be a knock off version of someone else"s taste. Its  impossible to give a review if the recipe was not made as written. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. This will be our family favorite for years to come.They are AMAZING!

were unbelievable! I'm ruines for restaurant ribs now. They were so tender, fall off the bone, and the sauce is delicious! It was so cold wheb I made them that my BBQ wouldn't stay hot, so I just baked them @ 450 for about 15 minutes and basted every 5 min or so. They were sticky, carmelly deliciousness!

I followed the recipe and doubled it for the extra sauce since I was making more ribs than the recipe called for.  I did not have whiskey so did not use that but we still loved it!
I also added mesguite chips to the grill for the  short grilling time .  I was worried that the liquid smoke in the sauce and chips might be overpowering but it was perfect.
My son and husband, heavily smoked BBQ lovers, loved them.  I am not a lover of heavy BBQ smoking taste.
This recipe is our perfect balance.

This recipe is absolutely AMAZING and very easy to make! I substitute tomato paste with ketchup, because I never have tomato paste in my house, and I didn't use liquid smoke, for the same reason.  This recipe is a MUST-TRY... you won't be disappointed.

I highly, highly recommend this barbecue sauce!!   It is a lot of work and time consuming, but worth every detail.  I used only half of the called for liquid smoke, but the rest I followed to the letter.  Next time I will make, at least, a double batch so I can freeze some for latter!

Had to admit, reading reviews that are this highly rated was a little suspect but we made these ribs last night and hands down, best ribs I've ever made. Fall off the bone tender, the sauce is not too sweet, but interesting enough to want to slather on all kind of foods. I didn't use liquid smoke since I didn't have any and I substituted bourbon for whiskey. I'd make it the same way next time. Soon, actually.

This has to be the best back rib recipe I have ever tried. The suggested prep for the ribs wrapping in tin foil; excellent. The ribs were perfectly prepared and ready for the grill. Now, the sauce was another story... this has to be the best rib sauce I have ever eaten. It was beautifully balanced in flavour and I wouldn't change a thing. For me the heat was right but if your not a fan of spicy simply cut back on the amount of chili flakes you add. Well done. John

Wow! My husband absolutely loved this sauce.  I thought it was a little spicy. The next time I may cut back a little on the cayenne pepper and use a full 8oz can of tomato paste instead of just 1/2 cup. This is an excellent sauce. We are never using bottled sauce again.

I did make it. The sauce was great and milder than I expected with all the spices.  I think I would slow cook the ribs a little longer in the oven for tenderness, but otherwise the end result was very good.  No complaints. Yes I will make it again.  I also used  the sauce on bbq ed hamburgers.

These were the best ribs we ever ate, and this after many years of making baby back ribs with many different recipes!  We adapted the recipe to three full-size racks (rather than two) by doubling all ingredients, which caused the cooking time to reduce the sauce to the required thickness to be considerably longer than the recommended 1.25 hours (it took about 3 hours total time on low heat to reduce).  We also compared side by side to ribs made with a leading store-bought BBQ sauce, and everyone agreed that this recipe was much better than the sauce "in a bottle" ribs.  Kudos to Scott Hibb!

Best ribs and barbecue sauce ever. Remember to line the bottom of your oven with aluminum foil before preheating so it catches the drippings.

I made this exactly per the recipe - I did double the sauce recipe - and it was delicious! - a No. 1 Hit.  I will make this again for sure.

I've made this recipe twice now and it turned out great both times. The sauce is tasty. I'm a spice lover and felt it could be a little spicier, but that's easy enough to adjust for taste.

I have been trying to find the perfect recipe for ribs and this is definitely it! I followed the recipe EXACTLY and it came of absolutely amazing. This is going to be the recipe that our family uses from here-on. This fed our family of four and my wife and I could still take some for lunch the next day.

A M A Z I N G is right. Ribs were perfect and the sauce excellent -- a new family favorite! One reviewer mentioned the ribs falling apart when moved to the grill- we did not have that problem but also did not remove any back rib(?) either...not sure if that relates to regional style of cuts. Oven time and grill time where spot on and this was a simple sauce to merely combine! Amazingly perfect. Thank you!

I am a low carber, so I left out the brown sugar, molasses and honey.  In the end, I tasted it and added a tsp. of molasses and 2 tbsp. of xylitol.  I loved these ribs!  They were fantastic!  Can't say as I knew there was whiskey in there, but not to worry.  In the end, they were fantastic so who cares?  If I were to change anything, they were pretty hot, might cut down on the pepper, but maybe I won't.  I'm making them again today.  Twice in a week!!  They were that good!!!!

Worked out great, fantastic BBQ sauce. I did however modify the rub adding celery seed, cumin, and a few other spices and basting them with yellow mustard prior to adding the rub.

I've made these ribs numerous times and have added my own spin.  I rub the ribs with a butt rub and fridge overnight wrapped in cellophane then aluminum foil.  Instead of baking in the oven, they are smoked for 2 1\2 hours with hickory.  I finish them on the grill for about 5 minutes.  The sauce is absolutely awesome.  I add more cayanne as I love the spice.  Awesome recipe even in the oven.  It's worth the wait...

Great recipe.  Tasted like restaurant ribs.  Whole family loved them.   I thought I would try this myself since my husband always raves about his own BBQ recipe and skills and I wanted to impress the family.  The sauce was fabulous and will definitely be using it again.  The ribs however were cooked a bit too long and barely stayed on the bone when grilling.  Next time will cook for 1hr 45min.  Thanks for sharing.

I hate smoke flavor, so I just left that out. I liked this sauce so much that I want to give it the credit it deserves even though I changed it to fit my personal taste. If you are like me and don't care for smoke flavor, just leave it out, this recipe is still amazing.

WOW! I'm a rib lover, and these are some of the best ribs I have ever had in my life! I was a little skeptical of the dry cooking (I have always basted them during the slow cooking process) but these turned out even better. A few tips: make sure that your aluminum foil packets are very tightly sealed so that no steam can escape. Before cooking, make sure you flip your rack of ribs over and remove the membrane along the back - it's usually tightly adhered, so you may have to cut it with a sharp knife and use a paper towel to peel it off. The sauce took about 2 1/2 hours to cook down to the correct consistency, so start making it right after you put the ribs in the oven. I didn't add any liquid smoke, and the flavor was still fantastic - although I did throw some wood chips on top of the charcoal. I didn't have any molasses, so substituted a mix of maple syrup and rum. Make sure you follow the instructions to brush on the sauce in the last few minutes of grilling, otherwise it will burn. Other than those few changes, I followed this recipe exactly. The level of spiciness was perfect and the sauce is AMAZING!

Amazing recipe. Meat was "fall of the bone" and taste was wonderful. Sauce was tasty, time consuming but worth the effort. " Best ribs ever" from my husband.  No changes at all to the recipe.

First time we've been happy with the ribs I've fixed!  :-)  The meat came off the bones with no effort -- very tender & juicy!  My daughter said that the sauce was better than the stuff we buy (she tends to be critical of my cooking, so that was an extreme compliment from her).  I started the sauce, reducing the salt to 1 tsp (we try to do lower sodium).  Let it simmer for a while, tasted, and decided to make it sweeter.  Added ~1-2 T Worcestershire sauce, ~2 T brown sugar, ~1 T honey, and ~1 tsp whiskey.  I would have liked some more heat, but husband and daughter liked it this way.  Oh -- I used ancho chile powder and smoked paprika, so I cut back on the liquid smoke.  This was not a technically difficult recipe, it was just time-consuming.  

~~~Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.  I'm so happy to have fixed ribs that are not disappointing!

This sauce is off the charts amazing!! We have faithfully used the same bbq sauce for years and I was out so I used this recipe on my ribs. No one wants anything to do with an other bbq sauce!! I used ketchup instead of paste because of availability and an entire shot of wild turkey whiskey... it was perfect!

This is our “go to” recipe for ribs on Father’s Day. Everyone LIVES it. I make it as is except sometimes I get “Southern Style Pork Ribs” and use minced garlic instead of powdered. It’s DELICIOUS!!!

Near perfection...but I found the original recipe makes the sauce a little too tangy and also a bit salty.  Here are three small but important changes:

1. I use cider vinegar instead of white
2. I use just under 1/2 cup of vinegar. Closer to 1/3 cup
3. Only 1 tsp salt

NOW it's perfect!!

Talk about fall off the bone tender! I grill them over charcoal and mesquite chips after the oven. I did use a different sauce recipe but the ribs were cooked perfectly

Delicious recipe! This was my first time making ribs and they turned out so good! They were falling off the bone after I took them out of the oven, which is exactly how I like them. The sauce is so much better than any of the store bought BBQ sauces. My husband wanted me to just use Sweet Baby Rays, but I really wanted to give this sauce a try after all the 5 star reviews and I am so happy that I did. Everyone loved the ribs! Definitely would make these again.

Probably the best ribs I have ever tasted.... The only downside is that every other rib you eat (restaurant, some one else's recipe) comes in second place!

made this for super bowl day and the ribs were fall of the bone and tasty however I don't think they are the best I ever tasted so only gave 3 stars.  I agree with other reviewers that the sauce takes longer then 1 1/2 hrs to reduce.  More like two hours.  I didn't find the sauce that spicy and unlike a lot of other reviewers I made the recipe exactly as written.  Not fair to review if you change the recipe!  Also your ribs will always be fall of the bone if you steam in low oven so it is the sauce that makes the difference and while this was ok I didn't think it was off the charts.  Would not make again as the sauce is labor intense and not worth the effort when one has another recipe with fewer ingredients and better taste.

These were absolutely delicious!!  The only changes I made was I first cooked them in the slow cooker for a few hours, so I didn't have to stick around home for the oven part. Put in a little water on the bottom for steaming purposes, and put the ribs on a rack above. Next, instead of using liquid smoke I placed some wet hickory chips wrapped in tinfoil with holes punched in it. Waited until it was hot enough to start smoking, then started cooking my ribs...YUM!

Seriously the best way to cook bone in country style ribs.  Too cold to grill, so we took care of business on the broiler.  I didn't make my own sauce this time, but honestly it is the cooking method that makes these!

This recipe was a absolute winner at our last non traditional Christmas dinner have had encore requests for this one the only change I made was basting the ribs every 20 minutes or so with bourbon to enhance the bourbon flavor a little more but still a killer good recipe if you haven't tried it and you like spirits flavored meats your missing out!

This stuff is awesome! The cooking technique gives the best ribs, juicy and fall off the bone. The sauce is now my go-to sauce that I use for everything. My husband loves his BBQ sauce and says this is his favorite. Must try!

First time I made ribs.  Followed the recipe to a "t", except I didn't have onion powder so added in dehydrated minced onions - was fantastic.

I didn't follow the recipe for the sauce. I used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce. I prepped the ribs, basted them with SBRs sauce, wrapped them in foil, placed them on a cookie sheet, and baked them at 350 for 2 1/2 hours. I do want to note that I placed a pan of water in the bottom of the oven - whether it made a difference or not, I don't know. I didn't put them on the grill either - too lazy today I guess. However, that being said,they were AWESOME! This was the 2nd time I have ever made ribs (I screwed up the first time!) and I will follow the same recipe next time. I have never had ribs this good before! I'm keeping this one in my recipe box! Thank you!

Sauce was amazing.  I got 4 thumbs up from my husband and daughter.  I did tweak it a little since I didn't have any onion powder or liquid smoke, so I added smoked paprika and a bit of celery seed.  It was great, thick, sweet and tangy.  I will make this again for sure.

This recipe truly is amazing! It is the BEST ribs recipe I have made to date. I didn't use whiskey in the sauce (as we don't drink in our house, and have no whiskey!), but the sauce still turned out amazing. I've always boiled my ribs before grilling them, but I have been converted to baking them now! I can't believe how tender and soft they were. I fed this to my in-laws (6 adults) and every one of them raved about how great these ribs were! The recipe has earned a spot in my recipe collection & will be my new go to for ribs! The barbecue sauce itself is worth the time. No more buying it for us!

I would not change a single thing about this recipe.  If you do you are missing out.  I used the extra sauce I had from making the ribs and made BBQ chicken with it this evening.  No more of the store bought stuff for me!!

These were fantastic! I am very very new to cooking and have never made anything like this before. I did however, take someone's suggestion and used the rub for the "Prize Winning Baby Back Ribs" which was an excellent idea (thank you) next time I will use less cumin but still wonderful. I didn't use the liquid smoke because I think it's gross and added 3 cloves of garlic. I will use a bit less brown sugar next time. Be sure there will be a next time. I would eat these everyday if I could

This recipe sounds great and I might try it one of these days.  I have been using short cuts and everyone enjoys my ribs.  I just boil them for one (1) hour in salted water.  Remove from water, place bone side up in a broiling pan.  Cover with a good layer of Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce and broil for seven (7) minutes then turn over, baste again with sauce and broil for a final seven (7) minutes.  They may not be as good as this recipe but I think you will be happy with such a good tasting and simple meal.

Delicious! Used chipotle pepper flakes instead of cayenne red pepper only because I didn't have any, but I used too much chipotle for my tastes (cuz I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy food) but my Dad and boyfriend loved it. Made 5 racks of ribs and there was plenty of sauce. Will definitely make again. Not too sticky or too sweet. Could've used a little more liquid smoke and less chipotle.

I tried this recipe yesterday with great success. I followed it all-the-way except I did not have any molasses and cheated a little and used 1 T (tablespoon) of Bulls-Eye original and used smoked paprika instead of regular. I also cut back a little on the red pepper (at my wife's request, LOL!). She said they were the best ribs she every had. Fantastic and very easy.

I used Country style ribs and cooked as directed.  I did not use the grill but opted for the oven this time.  I followed the sauce exactly (well...I confess to using 1/2 cup of whiskey in place of the 1/2 cup water - 2 tbsp was just not gonna work for us! LOL) and while it was good - it was just lacking a little in texture and spice for us.  I added 3 tbsp of butter and 1/2 cup of Chili garlic sauce for some heat.  I then used about 2-3 tbsp of cornstarch to thicken it all up.  It was exactly what we were looking for.  The recipe, as it stands, is quite good and easily adjusted to your preference.  Next batch I am thinking to add some chipotle....  lots of possibilities here! Really, so good....

The sauce was spectacular! I got more requests to make these ribs for the next get together. They are time consuming, but when worth it to me. The sauce is a bit spicy, so if you're not into heat, cut back on the chile pepper. We used the left over sauce on cocktail weinies for another party, and they were gone within the hour:)

I searched for a long time to find this recipe after making it at my brothers house, very glad I found it.  Instead of using liquid smoke, I used Chipotle peppers and less chili powder.  Delicious!

Actually used this recipe only for the sauce and loved it! 

Recommend only a couple of minor changes: only 1/4 cup brown sugar; 1/2 tsp pepper; 2 tsp liquid smoke; add 1 tbsp mustard and 2 tsp hot sauce (Datil Do-it Devil Drops are my fave, not too vinegary, overpowering, and pungent like Tobasco, etc).

First time I have offered my 2 cents in a review.  This sauce is really good if you are into just sweet bar-b-q.  You want a sauce with sweet and a little kick my money is on Barbequed Ribs submitted by Gail (this web site).  As for cooking- always boil ribs for 45 mins. to an hour then slather with the sauce you like best (sorry0- for me it's Gail's, wrap in foil sprayed with non-stick cooking spray and throw on the bar-b-q- at 300-325 degrees turning every 15 minutes for 1-2 hours.  Yummy!!!!

Very good recipe. Made the recipe as is. The sauce was fantastic -- just a little bit of heat, but not too much.  Will definitely be using this recipe from now on.

I made this Memorial weekend.  My 9 year old nieces were over and were amazed and felt really grown up having whiskey in their bbq sauce.  Lol.  I kept telling them it was only a teenie tiny bit. Lots of compliments.

I seared the seasoned ribs before tossing them in the oven, and added a shot of whiskey to the sauce.  They turned out great, and I enjoyed the leftovers for a picnic on the boat with reserved sauce.

Cooking method is perfect!  Fall off the bone tasty ribs!!  The sauce is very good.  Back to the cooking method, how easy.  Finishing on the grill is soooooo easy and makes the sauce turn into a scrumptious glaze!

This recipe was fabulous.  The only change I made was a substitution (I didn't have any tomato paste), I used ketchup instead of tomato paste and did not add any water which brought the reduction time way down, only 20 minutes to thicken.  Excellent sauce and the ribs were amazing!

Made these again today for the fourth time. They were every bit as luscious as I remember from the last time and THE ONLY WAY I will ever make ribs again! You can't make this without also making the sauce. Yes...it's that important. LOVE these ribs and I wouldn't change a thing.

If you prefer a sweet, slightly-hot sauce, then this one's for you.  DH and DS loved it, but I prefer a sauce that is not quite so sweet.  I did use some wood chips on the grill, and I would even like more of a smoky taste, so I would like them to stay on the grill a bit longer.  I don't think it would hurt them.  I do give 5 stars for tenderness, though.  The low and slow oven is perfectly timed for tender, fall-off-the-bone ribs.  I followed the recipe very closely, subbing only cayenne for the red chile pepper.

These were OUTSTANDING.  I've made ribs so many times and these were by far the best ribs I've ever made.  The sauce is different than traditional BBQ sauce--a little chunkier--but so good.  You really can't go wrong with these!

These ribs were the absolute best.  Made for my family and they enjoyed them very much.  Only thing I didn't use was liquid smoke as I didn't have it.  Thank's Scott, they are amazing. *****

Amazing is the CORRECT adjective when describing these ribs! The sauce is so delicious that I "taste" it several times while it is cooking down. I do reduce the amount of red chile pepper (cayenne) as I like the sauce with less heat. This is my go-to recipe for grilling for company.

I'm not a bbq fan myself, but I quite enjoy this recipe.   My husband loves it. I made it for my parents recently and they also gave it a thumbs up. I didn't have whiskey the first four or five times I made the recipe, and it tasted as good as it does with the whiskey.

I tried this recipe since it had such high reviews. I had never made ribs before so I was a little apprehensive. It came out so delicious that my teenagers had me make them again so they could invite their friends over. I saved the sauce recipe for other meats and have used it for chicken and pork as well. Love it!

Excellent, fall off the bone recipe!  My company was looking for more.  I used 4 tbsps of whiskey instead of 2, and I threw in some seasoning salt and about 1 tbsp of hot pepper flakes just to give it a bit more ooomph!  Will make these again real soon!

If I could give this recipe SIX stars...I would!!!This is the only way to cook the ribs, and the sauce is out of this world!! Sweet..salty...smokey and spicey, just enough to hit the back of your palet and enjoy all of the flavors! My husband and son sat at the table to dig in and it was like watching Fred Flintstone and Hagar the horrible eat!!!!Not ONE word until the plate was empty.  Thanks Scott, for an absolutely awesome recipe:)

I just made these for our July 4th dinner and they were so very good. The regular pork ribs were on sale so I used those and they were still fantastic. I was concerned about how much red pepper went in the recipe- but it was perfect. The meat fell off the bone!

These are truely AMAZING!!! I don't normally give 5 stars to something I've altered but Wow! Best ribs I've ever had, beats any restaurants ribs hands down! I ran out of garlic powder so I used minced garlic and tossed it in with the onion to cook, I used ketchup instead of tomato paste since I didn't have it and I didn't have worchestershire sauce so I ended up tossing in a half a jar of Holy Habanero sauce from rosecitypeppers.com gave it even more of a zing. I should have used less water with the ketchup so it would've cooked off faster, so the sauce was a bit thin but that was my own fault. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! 
EDIT: I've made this many times now and love it, I now do strictly dry ingredients and add paprika and cayenne powder to the BBQ sauce and still add a heaping spoonful of whichever rosecity pepperheads jelly I have on hand. I still use ketchup and use much less water. Even my kids love this BBQ sauce and when the smell the BBQ sauce cooking on the stove top, they excitedly ask if we're having ribs for dinner!

Did this recipe for Dad on Father's Day and he called me the next day and said he wished he would of ate more even though he was full. This is a sweet sauce and if you like it a little spicer I would load up on the pepper more or add some chipolte. Followed the recipe exactly and turned out great!

The sauce was kind of fun to make since it was my first time.  It was really good, but not Amazing.  My ribs were very good but not fall off the bone.  Maybe it was the quality of meat?  I got them in a cryovac previously frozen package.  I will keep experimenting...ribs are a summer hobby this year!

I used Simple BBQ recipe to get the fall the bone tender meat, the sauce for this I didn't put whiskey or dark molasses, didn't have any. I read where others omitted also and the result was amazing, but for me I think it neede that...and more salt.

AWESOME recipe!  My friends from TX couldn't stop talking about it.  I'm a baker not so much a chef and I found this to be so easy.  The two things I did differently were 1. I left out the chile pepper and 2. I marinated the ribs in the sauce prior to grilling them for about an hour.  Delish!!

Thanks for sharing this recipe. The sauce didn't have enough 'oompf' for me. For bottled sauce I love Sweet Baby Rays..which I would have prefered to this recipe. It is a good basic recipe but it needs some added depth for my taste. I love the idea of baking in the oven and finishing on the grill...worked great..and will make my ribs this way from now on. Thanks!

DON'T CHANGE THIS RECIPE!!!! I have tasted many ribs in my life and nothing compares to this. I made this exactly as ordered and let me tell you...my husband is out there right now doing the final steps on this recipe (the grilling) and I truly have neighbors coming over, following their noses, all inviting themselves to dinner. My entire family (including 3 picky teenage girls) have each tried a piece of the ribs as their coming off the grill and we are all dying, it is SO good!! This recipe is 100% a keeper...I'm just wishing I was the mastermind behind it. The sauce is amazing...sweet, with a subtle kick that gets you at the back of your tongue. Oh...I should mention that this is the first time I have ever cooked ribs and every little thing was beyond perfect!!!  Scott Hibbs... you're a genius!!!!!

These ribs turned out so moist. What a hit at a cookout I had. Fixed the ribs on the grill with a pan of water under the ribs to keep them moist. Grilled them at 225 and WOW were they good with the sauce. I cut back a little on the chile pepper, I am not very adventurous when it comes to too much spicy food. Boy this is yummy.

Very good Recipe. A-.  I only had time to bake my rack in the oven for 1.5 hrs and it was still very temder... I can only imagine if I had put it in for the entire 2.5 hrs as suggested, how tender the ribs would be! And the sauce is great. Very tomato taste- with the paste of course, but has a kick with the paprika and chili spice and tartness from the vinegar. More like a ketchup recipe than bbq sauce- nonetheless- a hit at my kitchen so thanks!

I did not like this at all. It was super sweet. The vegetable oil would not mix in with the rest of the ingredients and the sauce was really thick without the oil integrated into it.

The taste of vinegar was much too pungent for our taste- had to readjust the sauce adding a bit of everything else to balance it out. I also omitted the liquid smoke as I didn't have it on hand.

Another winner.  The only things changed were the addition of more smoke flavour and heat once the BBQ sauce cooled, to taste.  Also I didn't bake my ribs, I always steam them in a large steamer tilll the meat is just starting to pull away from the bone and therefore not sitting in all that extra fat.

This review is primarily for the cooking method and the sauce as I used my own preferred rub recipe. The ribs were very good and very tender and so easy to prepare. I am not generally a recipe tweaker but I did have to leave out the onions, garlic and onion powder due to an allergy of those that were coming for dinner. I thought the sauce was easy to make, mine was reduced in about an hour. Everyone thought it was delicious (it was a little bit too spicy for me but I'll just cut down on the cayenne next time). I had bought a little over 5 pounds of ribs and was worried I had way too much for 4 of us but there was only one little piece leftover. I scaled it to 6 servings which was more than enough sauce for the ribs and plenty for dipping.

Really, really good ribs.  We don't like the flavor of liquid smoke, so we omitted that, but it was the only thing we changed.  We did find these just a little too sweet and will cut back on the sugar and add a bit more worcestershire next time.  The overall flavor was really great and definitely has some spice to it.  The meat was just perfect- very tender. Thanks, Scott!

These ribs were the best ribs we have ever tasted. We made them for the Superbowl, and the meat literally fell off of the bone. The only changes we made was we put more spices on the meat before baking it in the oven. We srinkled on the salt, pepper, and red pepper, and then we also added sprinkles of garlic powder, onion powder, and cumin, just for some extra flavor. The sauce we made it exactly as is, and it really is the best barbeque sauce EVER!!! We will definitely make these ribs over and over. Thank you Scott for sharing this recipe with us!

I had really high hopes for this sauce because of all the high ratings...but it was too vinegary for me.  I followed the recipe exactly but finally had to mix in a little Famous Dave's just so it wouldn't have such a strong vinegar flavor.  Very good except for that.  Maybe cider vinegar wouldn't be as strong as white vinegar?

These ribs have become a tailgating and Christmas tradition.  The sauce is absolutely wonderful and ribs are fall off the bone yet still moist. We love this.  It is the best ever.

This was great. It did take a little longer to reduce for me, but we loved it. I made a double batch and hubby can't get enough. I followed the recipe except for the minced onions. I used chopped up red onion for even more zing.

I am from Kansas City and consider myself a conisuere of bbq sauces and I'm telling you...this was FANTASTIC!  I didn't have a grill so I cooked them in the oven for 2hrs then pulled them out, put bbq sauce on them, covered back up for 20 minutes, then back out again, placed in a 9x13 pan w/o foil and broiled them until the sauce carmelized.  Delish!

Scott, your rib recipe is perfect. We have prepared this same recipe a dozen times now and each time the ribs are just as tender as they were the first time they were served. Your BBQ sauce is just as awesome. Tangy and Sweet. I have recommended this recipe to family and friends. 1st time readers: If you are preparing this dish for the first time, don't change a thing. Make sure you keep the ribs at 300, covered in foil (double the foil if necessary) for 2 1/2 hours just like the chef recommends. As far as the sauce? You can try a good bottled version, but with all my testing...Scott's BBQ sauce compliments the ribs and is the best choice.

This sauce was delicious!! I also loved that it called to cook the ribs in the oven for 2 1/2 hrs.  It made them so tender.  As a side we made the 'Old Fashioned Onion Rings' Recipe from this website and it was perfect!  I didn't know where to find liquid smoke so I omitted that and used a little extra tomato paste since it was  a 6 oz jar.  We used Jameson whiskey and added an extra splash.     This sauce is just a great bbq suace, good on anything! chicken, steak, etc.

I over reduced the sauce on accident and it turned into a bit of a paste.  The flavor was still nice, but I would like to have a redo!  I loved the cooking method for the ribs though, as they were very tender.  I will certainly cook ribs like this again, even if I don't redo the sauce! Thanks!

Delicious ribs!  The sauce makes the moist, tender ribs just fantatsic.  I did not have any tomato paste so I used tomato sauce and it still did not require the full time of simmering.  A staple in our house now!

I was looking for a really unique recipe for rib sauce, and I will be keeping this one.  I used apple cider vinegar instead of white for more flavour, omitted the paprika and whiskey, and still got a divine sauce.  It only took about half an hour to reduce it.  I then cooked the ribs in the oven.  I would have added whiskey, but it's just not something I keep around in the house.  This one is the best!

I used one slab of ribs and followed the recipe and there was enough sauce for the one slab. The only change I made was to use cane syrup in exchange for the molasses because thats what I had. The ribs were fall off the bone fork tender and the sauce has a really nice flavor. I only gave it 4 stars because it was so very very hot/spicy. The black and red pepper almost ruined the ribs for me, I don't like my mouth on fire when I'm eatting. So I would reccomend this and will save to make again but for sure I will leave out the pepper. I would maybe try adding a little more of the Jack Daniels whiskey also next time.

I have never made baby back ribs prior to this. But I have eaten a whole lot of them prepared at various restaraunts. In my opinion is that these ribs blow them all away.

A great BBQ recipe - probably will replace my old oven recipe that my Mom & Dad used for chicken and/or ribs!!  I would agree that for enough sauce for 4 pounds of ribs you might want to make additional sauce.  If there was too much could always be used with chicken on another day.  Thanks for sharing, Scott.

This was delicious, but the amounts called for in the sauce didn't make enough for me. I didn't have enough to coat the backside of the ribs. I will double that part next time.

For the last couple of years, I thought my own baby back method was the best.  However, I decided to mix things up for a Labor Day cookout and tried a new recipe.  This one puts mine to shame!  I followed the instructions to the T (both for the meat and the sauce) and was flabbergasted at how tender and flavorful every bite was.  I prefer a stronger whiskey flavor to liquor-themed sauces and will add more Jack Daniels next time I make it, but other than that, this one is a winner!

Love this BBQ sauce...didn't have whisky but did not make a difference to me...we love it!!!  The only change I made was to bake them for an extra 30 minutes in a roasting pan basted with BBQ sauce instead of putting them on the grill....excellent!!!

All I can say is...WOW! Thanks for the recipe! The only change I made was to add Southern Comfort instead of actual whiskey, since we were out. I have been searching for a good BBQ sauce for years, and now I have found the perfect one! This is definitely a make again!! I would give it 10 stars if I could!

This rating was difficult. I have grilled ribs for 20+ years and scoffed at those who bake ribs and use sauce. My eldest daughter finally told me after 11 years that she really didn't like my ribs, so I decided to use this recipe. Everyone loved them...and the sauce is a good one. I recommend it.

Awesome sauce!  I used another rub, but this sauce is what made these ribs...fantastic! Not a lot of work at all compared to other sauces, and I cut down on the water a bit to save some time.

I made the ribs a few days ago. It was just great, I loved the sauce and the ribs turned out very tender. I end up adding a little more vinegar (ca 2tbs) and whisky (ca 2tbs). Even my husband, who is a picky eater and the cook in the family, liked the recipe a lot. The sauce tastes even better the next day, unfortunally I had no ribs left to go with it.. :((

One Million Stars !!!!!  Ok, seriously, this is by far the most delicious, most tender and easiest recipe ever.  Now, my family and I have enjoyed many ribs.  We have traveled an hour away just to have ribs at Texas Road House.  No resturant has ribs that are better than these.  Honestly, Scott Hibb has the best recipe.  We have a five and a three year old so I backed off of the ground chili.  Our five year old ate an entire half rack herself and our three old ate the other.  To say the least we were all covered in ribs and sauce and there was no conversation at dinner except for grunts and groans !!!!!!  Thanks for the recipe !!!

This recipe was awesome! We used a differnt rib rub, but followed the directions otherwise. The ribs fell right off the bone.

This recipe was easy and delicious!  The sauce is amazing, it is the perfect "sweet heat".  I followed the recipe exactly except I used smoked paprika and chipotle chili pepper, and tripled the Jack Daniels.  I also would like to try next time to use oven bags instead of foil - I thought I was very careful in wrapping them up but still they leaked on the cookie sheet. Only flaw/bonus is that the recipe made a lot of sauce...and it is so good that I am going to try it on some chicken and veggie burgers next so I can use it all up!  This recipe should be double-posted as a BBQ sauce recipe - the best I have ever had - I didn't think it was tomatoey at all actually.  Definitely will make again!

This is just for the sauce.  The sauce was very tomatoey.  It did have a zing to it.  I made it on steaks.  I will try a different BBQ sauce recipe.

I thought the ribs were good but not as impressed as others seem to be. I still prefer Big Als bbq sauce(AR) over this one. This one was just way to sweet and not tangy enough for my taste. I followed the recipe EXACTLY but found myself adding more vinegar as it simmered. I will not make this again only cause I LOVE 'Big Al's K.C. Bar-B-Q Sauce' over this one.

The sauce for these ribs is fantastic and very flavorful. I used one tsp of chipolte chilie pepper instead of the Tbsp called for and the sauce was just right. I think it would have been way too spicy for us with the full amount. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Yummy ribs....

Excellent flavor and the slow baking in oven keeps the inside very juicy. Grilling with the sauce at the end seals the deal. I used a bottle of beer (Newcastle Brown Ale) instead of whiskey.

So, my fiance always makes the ribs whenever we BBQ.  I really wanted to try this recipe, but he teased me about "leaving the ribs to the men."  Needless to say the challenge was issued and during our BBQ on the 4th (30+ people) 6 racks of ribs that I made with this recipe disappeared as soon as they came off the grill - all my man's friends wanted my recipe!  Thank you Scott for giving me the victory!  lol  (I followed the ingredient list exactly, but tripled it and marinated the ribs in it overnight.)

This recipe was a HUGE hit, even amongst the men! So tasty and flavorful. I just lightly coated the ribs when I threw them on the grill and save the rest of the sauce for dipping.

I found that the longer the ribs do the slow cook in the oven the better than are when cooked on the grill.  The sauce is soo very good that I make a double or triple batch and the freeze what is left over in ice cube trays and take out what I want when needed.

Funny...ribs being rated by a devout vegetarian!  While I did not partake in the ribs, the sauce was FABULOUS, and all my carniverous family and friends  at our party gave them an enthusiastic two (sauce-covered) thumbs up!

Sometimes I think people are just a little too picky. This was my first time making bbq sauce on my own and I loved it! It was so good. Thick and a little sweet. I used everything except the whiskey. I did not cook the ribs like the recipe called for( I just grilled them for about an hour), but I did make the sauce and I will definitely be making it again with no changes needed for it.

Our first attempt at making ribs.  I did preview some other readers suggestions and did opt to add more whisky.  These are the best!  We served them at a  house party and received RAVE reviews!  Thanks so much!

Great flavor.  The sauce is especially good.  I suggest you double the sauce recipe as I ran out.  The oven cook time for the ribs was a bit too long.  Mine dried out.  I'd try this again.

Amazing ribs!  I put them in the smoker and cooked them all night at 200.  They turned out tender and juicy, the sauce was wonderful.  I'm not a big rib-eater but my kids gave them a thumbs up!

So I used spareribs for this recipe instead of baby backs because they were on sale.  I cooked them in the oven for some time and it came out wonderful.  Everyone loved the sauce on this, I thought it was okay though.  I don't know if I would go through with the trouble of the sauce again, it was a spectacular recipe though.  *Update*: I made the recipe with baby back ribs a few days later and altered the bbq sauce with a tad more honey. YUMM! For sure the liquid smoke is definitely a must.  I used hickory liquid smoke this time around.  I've been slow cooking it at 250 degrees this whole time and and will increase the time as usual for future bbqs. Thanks for the recipe.

Yes, I agree these are THE best ribs ever.  We loved the sauce too and I'm making chicken with the leftover sauce. I do have a question though because I couldn't find a spice called Ground Red Chile Pepper so I used Chile Powder which I now see isn't the right thing.  However, if they ribs had been any better I'm not sure we could have stood it. :) If you others can't find it just sub chili powder cause my ribs received rave reviews from everyone.

Wow.  Hands down the best ribs I have ever made, and among the best I have ever had.  Made the recipe as written for a first try, and the ribs were fantastic. Bunches of compliments to the chef for the ribs from all party goers.  I'll add a little red pepper to half the sauce next time, just because I really like it that way.  You can change the sauce, but the method of cooking the ribs is the best.  2.5 hours sit for 10 then on the grill. So tender and good.  Great recipe

Excellent sauce.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect.  I made the ribs yesterday and I'm making the sauce again today to put on boneless chicken breasts on the grill!

I am not a big ribs fan, but I made this for my husband and a couple of guests for Memorial Day and it was FANTASTIC! I didn't change anything, and they said it was the best ribs they ever had. Even my 12 year old son loved them. I will definately make again!

WOW! What a hit!  I put a rub of chili pepper/cumin/paprika on the ribs before I cooked them. Then put this awesome sauce over the ribs on the grill.  My husband and I were in LOVE with these ribs.  They were so good I made them again the next night so I could have them ready for Memorial Day BBQ at my SIL's house. Great kick, sweetness, and tartness combined.  The only substitution I made the first time was I ran out of Paprika, so I used Chiptotle Pepper, I had no liquid smoke, and I used Cognac b/c I had no Whiskey.  The 2nd time, the only substitution I made was I kept the Chipotle Pepper. Will let you know what my family thinks of this recipe.

long process but did turn out great. the ribs were nice and moist but the sauce was just OK but i did leave out the liquid smoke cause i personally dont care for it. I find it makes the recipes taste fake if that makes any scense. But it did call for alot of ingredients which made the taste very yummy but I think the sauce needs some altering to give it a good kick.

We all LOVED this recipe!  I forgot to put the whiskey in but nobody noticed.  This was AMAZING!!  Even my 11 month old daughter LOVED it!  Did my best to follow recipe exactly.  As I said, I forgot the whiskey but it was really good even without it.  Only used 1 rack of baby back ribs and froze the rest of the sauce.  We are a small family.  I definitely look foward to making this again.  Don't be scared by the long list of ingredients.  It was easy and soooo worth it!

This recipe is truly flawless!!! I followed the recipe making no adjustments or substitutions because I have not ever cooked ribs before.  These were excellent and simple.  I made them for a family gathering and no one could get enough of them. I even have one family member who is gluten intolerent and she could eat these too!!! Thank you so much for an unbelievable recipe.

Truly Amazing! My boyfriend made these for me and I LOVED IT! Way better than any ribs I've had at any restaurant, and that says a lot b/c I'm from Texas and we have Steak/BBQ places everywhere.

These ribs were fantastic, I have been looking for perfect BBQ sauce for my ribs and now I have found it.  The only thing I did different was to use 1/8 cup whiskey and 1/2 cup red wine, I am not sure how it tastes the other way, but EVERYONE here loved them and devoured them quickly.

Super, fall-off-the-bone good. I accidentally used chili powder instead of the chili pepper before baking (misread the recipe), but they were excellent regardless. I'll probably make them exactly the same way next time. Thanks!!

Excellent recipe.  I added a bit of Cheyenne to both the sauce and the ribs while they were cooking for kick, and accidentally added too much liquid smoke.  The ribs turned out great regardless.

Amazing even without the whiskey.  Didn't have ground red pepper so I used 1 tsp. crushed red peppers in the sauce and none on the ribs.  Just the right combo of sweet and spicy for our taste.  I only added 1 cup of water to cut down on simmering time.

This recipe rocks! The bbq sauce is amazing.  I can't believe how easy it is to make.  I did leave out the whiskey since I didn't have on hand.  I also skipped the oven part and went straight to the grill.  Indirect heat is the best way to grill ribs! I only turned on 2 of the burners and placed the rack on the one that was off.  It took about an hour 10 mins till done.  Will definately do again!

These Baby Back Ribs ROCK! I did not have molasses and used real maple syrup. Luckily I had sauce leftover for some center cut pork chops later in week! Thanks for sharing this fantastic recipe! You made my husband a very happy man!

I don't eat pork and made ribs for some serious rib eaters. The ribs were hit but even more important they loved the sauce.  I actually used the sauce on chicken. 

I did make ome changes.  I left out the whiskey, increased the molasses to 2 1/2 tbsp and te chile pepper to 1 1/2 tbsp.  I also cut the vinegar to 1/2 cup.

Sounds fantastic - so I rated it 5 stars before I tried it. BUT I was wondering how the ribs would be if baked the day before, refrigerated overnight, and then grilled?  (since for some occasions I am usually using the oven for other dishes.)

Simply wonderful! Very tender indeed from the slow oven baking. The simmering sauce filled the whole house with a tempting scent, then proved perfectly delicious to have on the ribs.  We were having bad storms, so I had to broil instead of grill.  Still great. Will freeze left over sauce.

After trying this a couple weeks ago, a less spicy version for my sensitive fiance, I have sworn off using store bought sauce on my ribs. This recipe is fantastic!  Keep an eye on them when you put them on the grill, they like to catch fire.

Absolutely perfect!  I was a little concerned about the pre-seasoning; that it wouldn't have enough flavor, but everything turned out perfect in the end.  I did simmer the sauce on low the entire time the ribs were cooking and it thickened up quite nicely.  No changes were made at all.  Good Job!

I loved it!  The meat was so tender and fell off the bone so much I had trouble BBQing it!  I used the rub submitted by Bonnie Quinn instead of the suggested one.  The whole family loved it.  I can't wait to make them again!

This recipe is fantastic! It takes time but there is plenty of sauce left to use on another meal. I set my oven to 375 and only baked 1 hour and 30 minutes. Will definitely make this again.

The sauce is very good.  I halved the water so mine was thick enough.  It would have been very runny or needed to be cooked a long time to thicken up.  I did not have onion powder so did not use that but the rest I followed very closely.  The flavour was great but you have to watch it on the meat closely.  He says that it will burn if you put it on too early.

this is a good recipe!  It did take a little work but the result was very good.  I did make one change though.  I used some "Hugh's Dry Rub" from this site on the ribs before wrapping them them in foil.  I also omitted the Whisky because I didn't have any in hand.

WOW - These are AMAZING!  My husband offered to take care of all of my house cleaning this past weekend in appreciation for these outstanding ribs!  I thru asparagus, red potatoes, onions and peppers on the grill to accompany these and the whole meal was a major hit! Thanks!

Great recipe, this used to be the only way I'd make ribs since I now have a Webber smoker low temp smoking is the way to go. That being said this recipe still has one of the best sauces around. Sometimes I substitute the Chile pepper and liquid smoke with chipotle peppers in adobo sauce this give the sauce natural heat & smoke.

We were vacationing when I made these.  I used a store bought BBQ sause and the ribs were still amazing!!  After an hour of cooking, coat a potato in olive oil and salt and then put them in the oven with the ribs for the remainder of the cooking time (1 1/2 hours).  Everything turns out amazing!!!

Fabulous!  Made a couple modifications (didn't have some of the ingredients) - ketchup in place of tomato paste, a little more honey, molasses & whiskey as I didn't have liquid smoke, and used Creole seasoning in place of chili powder.  We'll DEFINITELY make this recipe again!!!!!

I tried this recipe last weekend and it was simply delicious!  I was out of whiskey so, I substituted it for some Jim Beam.  I also added more garlic and stirred in about 1/4 cup of bourbon into the barbecue sauce.  My husband said they were the best ribs he ever had!

Thank You, Thank You, Thank You !! After making these ribs for my husband's birthday bash, I was crowned "Best Cook in the Family", and we have a big one. Honestly, you didn't even need to own teeth to dig into these "Babys"!! They just fell off the bone. The taste was suberb! And so easy to prepare. The trick is to get that membrane removed off the back of the ribs, it makes them super tender. Oh, and seal them up real tight with foil to prevent leakage. A erfect recipe for a simply perfect day!! Try these and your family will be entering you in the next "Rib Cook-Off"!!

This was a great recipe!  Super easy and not at all messy.  The only change that I made was that I used the spice rub from the recipe on this site: Baby Loin Back Ribs.  And it's important to remove that membrane!  For a first try at ribs, this was a huge success!

Scott Hibbard is the god of BBQ in my books.  After trying numerous recipes looking for the perfect rib recipe, I've finally found it.  The only minor complaint I could make is the meat was so tender, I lost a few little bits in the BBQ process.  The sauce is fantastic.

The men loved it.  Don't cook this during the summer when it's hot out (it was over 100 today and I was sweating during the slow cooking process with the AC on).  They slow cooked about 2 hours then went onto the grill and my husband comment on how they were already falling apart.  The sauce makes tons so I froze it for the next time.  The sauce was excellent even though I didn't have molases on hand.

These are the best ribs I have ever made!  They were very tender, and fall off of the bone good.  We ran out of propane at the last minute after baking potatoes on it, so I just broiled the ribs for about 5 min. after baking and they were fabulous!  Thanks Scott~

Fabulous ribs--meat falls off the bone!  Used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce,and ribs were perfect! Make sure to remove membrane from the back of the ribs--makes it even more tender.

The ribs are fantastic!  The slow baking method makes them fall off the bone and super tender.  The sauce recipe is good, but risky.  I have made it a few times and it always tastes different...I will definately keep the baking method.

Mmmm... these are so good.  I made them for my dad for Father's Day.  I used a prepared rub before putting them in the oven to bake and I baked them for 3 hours because the ribs I bought were really big and meaty.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  Thanks for the great ribs Scott.

WOW! I made these and they were awesome! Fall off the bone and the BBQ sauce was a HUGE hit for the ones who don't eat ribs too!

Used the dry rub from the Prize Winning Baby Back ribs recipe on this site. I then followed the cooking instructions that Scott layed out in this recipe (but first removed the membrane) and then finished with our favorite BBQ sauce - Sweet Baby Rays - on the grill.  My son is pretty picky and typically wants ribs out for his birthday but with this recipe his 19th birthday was a hit!

I used this sauce on chicken and it is simply the best. Next time we'll have the ribs.

The ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender, so you'll be in great shape if you follow the rib preparation and pre-baking.  The sauce was tangy and sweet, pretty good really.  My only complaint is that the ribs were a little bland, and I think the recipe could benefit from some measurements for the spices that are applied to the ribs before baking.  Next time I will prepare the ribs the same way but try to find a good dry rub recipe on this site.

Oh yes, the phone is still ringing.  Family calling to again say how delicious the ribs were.  The sauce is out of this world!  Perfect sauce to serve with those little cocktail weiners too.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Excellent sauce-I used Tupelo honey and it deepened the flavor (alittle).  The oven method is so much better than the grill for the ribs!  I made them a second time, increase the sauce four times in order to can some for later.  I'll be looking for other recipes from Scott.  THANKS!!!

I love baby back ribs and these were some of the best I'd ever had.  They were very tender-- a real knife and fork version. It calls for a lot of ingredients, but the sauce is great!

I thought these were fabulous! I also cut down on the liquid smoke, adding about 1/2 tsp, but followed the recipe other than that. The other thing I did was pour the BBQ sauce over the ribs once they were cooked and let them sit in the sauce for about 3-4 hours before popping them on the grill for about 5 minutes per side. They didn't burn at all, but would have if I had left them much longer. I don't know if allowing the cooked meat to sit in the sauce enhanced the flavor at all, but they sure were tasty. I'm actually on this site right now because I needed to get the recipe in order to make them again, this time for Father's Day dinner!

Thank you Scott and allrecipes.com for this great recipe.  My husband said these ribs were the best ribs he could remember enjoying.  I toned down the red pepper in step 2 of the directions to suit my family's taste.  The red pepper in the sauce was plenty of spice for us!

I have been using this recipe for 3 years.  This recipe is wonderful!! I add 1/2 cup ketchup to make the sauce thicker.  I also add a few dashes of gravy master to darken the sauce.
The best ribs ever! Thanks for sharing.

Wow, this recipe deserves more than 5 stars. The only changes I made were to lessen salt to 1 tsp. and only used 3/4 tsp. liquid smoke per other reviewer's suggestions, omitted red pepper!     Thanks for sharing!

My family loved these ribs!  I went with just a little less on the Liquid Smoke.  Thought the sauce was very tasty with just the right "kick".  Will definately make again!
