This is good stuff. A lot like a clam chowder but without clams which is great because clams are the only part of chowder I don't like. Tasty. I prefer to saute the chicken until it browns so it won't disintegrate while simmering and I leave it in rather than pick it out of the celery.

I experimented with this recipe and it truned out really well. This is the first time that I had ever made a cream soup and it turned out reall great. Everyone one loved it! If you are learning how to make cream soups this would be a good one to try first.

this recipe was easily prepared and delicious.  I did not use the chicken stock from cooking the chicken but substituted commercially made stock and left over chicken....awesome!

I thought this was alright...but nothing to write home about. I pretty much followed the recipe as written except I added carrots used precooked chicken and garnished with paprika rather than nutmeg. Leftovers the next day are more like a creamy pasta dish than soup. I'm not opposed to making this again but I'm not sure that I will as it really didn't knock my socks off.

This one one is really good! Perfect for cold night. It's quick to make as well. The whole family loved it. I had to add a bit more water because alot of the liquid got soaked up while standing.

Followed recipe as written. I like the idea of chicken potatoes and pasta however I found this recipe quite bland and watered down. An increase in flavoring as well as a thickened liquid-base is needed. Thanks anyway.

7.11.16 Just a few recommendations. I had some concerns and they were voiced by previous reviewers that this soup was bland. The first thing I did was eliminate the water and substitute Kitchen Basics Chicken Stock which elevated the flavor of the broth and lowered sodium. I would take step #1 (cooking the pasta) and move it down in the recipe otherwise you ll have cooked pasta sitting there and drying out. This recipe lists making the roux at the end and then adding the lumpy butter-flour mixture directly to all of the rest of the ingredients in the soup. I held off on adding the milk and added it to the roux making sure that it was smooth which also lets you control the soup's thickness (some folks said it was too thin). Doing it this way will give you a non-lumpy and creamy soup thickened to your preference. This recipe did take some time and has a lot of ingredients but I will say that after adjusting the seasonings we ended up with a very flavorful and tasty soup. Soup a nice salad and some fresh fruit were enjoyed today even on a hot Florida day.

I omitted the parsley as I don't like it used Lawry's seasoning salt instead of poultry seasoning as that's what I had on hand. I also made the soup first thing in the morning and added the cooked pasta much later on in the day - the flavors had melded together really nicely. Thanks Corwynn for another great recipe!

This soup had good flavor but only 3 stars because I expected it to be creamy and after the 20 minutes of sitting it was still a pretty watery texture. Make sure your potatoes are diced pretty small or they won't "blend" well with the soup. And be generous with the parsley--it needs it for flavor. Other than that pretty good.
