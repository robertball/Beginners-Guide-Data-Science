I've never been able to find andouille or maybe I've never looked hard enough, so I used polska kielbasa, but kept everything as the recipe stated. We all enjoyed these, they smelled very good while they were cooking. I topped with lettuce, tomatoe, jalapeno with salsa and sour cream on the side.

Husband loves these! I usually make them with canned corn, fresh jalapenos and grated extra-sharp Cheddar since I always have them on hand. A sprinkle of fresh cilantro doesn't hurt either. These are great for when you don't have much time in the kitchen. Thanks, Stephanie!

I accidently bought Chorizo instead of Andouille, but it worked out just great anyway.  I added some minced fresh jalapeno b/c we like it hot!  I also added some scrambled eggs in b/c I made it for a brunch.  These were very yummy and a nice change of pace from our regular "brunch". Thank you!  :)

Andouille and poblano are great together.  Good recipe...I'd make it again.

These were good! I didn't have the corn on hand, so that was left out. I did add some jarred jalapeno rings for a bit of a kick and it was perfect. The bf loved it (of course, his only had jalapeno rings, lots of cheese, and andouille). I thought mine (made as is) were delicious. I served them with a side of Knorr/Lipton Fiesta Sides "Taco Rice."

I made this last night as I had bought some poblanos the other day and wanted to do something different with them. I made these exactly as the recipe indicated and they were delicious! The sour cream addition is definitely a bonus. We will be making these again and again.

I'll give it a five-star rating, but as a burrito filling, not a quesadilla.  The quesadillas were dry, even with sour cream and/or salsa.  Hubby and I had one each and wrinkled our noses.  So we took the suggestion to make a breakfast burrito, added some scrambled eggs, and rolled it up in a warm flour tortilla.  I put a little salsa verde in my burrito, hubby added cheese to his.  Outstanding!  I will be making this whenever I get poblano peppers in my Bountiful Basket.  I hold one in a pair of tongs and slowly turn it over the gas burner until the skin blisters and pops all over.  Then I wrap the pepper in a wet paper towel to steam for a few minutes while I work on other ingredients.  The roasting really added to the depth of flavor.  The corn is a wonderful addition.

Yummy and fantastic for something different. Quick, easy and and family approved.  I made a quick lunch of it the next day but rather than a tortilla, I made a zucchini bowl.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful! made exactly as instructed. we eat quesadillas often, but first time ever tried this. we loved it.... Great little hint, I use my panini griddle for all my quesadillas. don't have to worry about flipping and the mess from a skillet!

Excellent.  Made with andouille chicken sausage, subbed yellow pepper for red (that's what they had at the farmers market), shredded cheddar, and topped with plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  Lots of flavor. It was a little tough to flip the quesadilla without stuff falling out the sides, but the taste made up for it!
