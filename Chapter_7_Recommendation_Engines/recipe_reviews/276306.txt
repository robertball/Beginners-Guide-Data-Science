10.20.19  Wow, what a good cake!  And what an interesting way to make a cake.  Admittedly, I had my doubts, but it really works.  Wasn’t quite sure what the consistency was supposed to be, but it’s a tender, moist cake with a soft, creamy, fudgy bottom (guess that’s where the “pudding” comes into the title), but not like the consistency of a lava cake.  From a taste perspective, it’s reminiscent of a really rich, chocolate brownie.  Whatever, it’s very good, very easy to make, and I wouldn’t change a thing.  Thanks for sharing your recipe Melinda.

I am an experienced baker and followed this recipe exactly  and it was awful. The water never completely absorbed into the cake and the flour did not cook. I have made a similar cake which includes more milk, butter and also 2 tsps of baking powder. I think the measurements of this cake is way off.
