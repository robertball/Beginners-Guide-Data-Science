I planned to make this exactly as the recipe said, mostly because I have absolutely no culinary creativity, and also because if it's got 5 stars, who am I to try to make it better? However, in addition to lacking creativity, I lack forethought. I didn't have garlic pepper. So Google told me it has garlic, pepper, brown sugar, paprika, and a couple of other things I don't have. So I sprinkled what I had on it, and...voila! C'est magnifique! My point isn't to change the recipe. My point is, if I can't screw this up, neither can you! So try it! Hahaha!
My entire family (including my 13 and 9 year olds) loved it. I did leave the lemon off of the 9 year old's portion, and the capers off of both of them; but we all loved it. My husband & I thought the lemon and capers were very good.

This dish turned out good however needed more flavour. I had already added more garlic and also some lemon juice but could have used a stronger lemon flavour. Topped it with cayenne pepper which did add a little kick. Overall, nice easy, quick dish!

Made exactly by the recipe and it was great. I'm not a huge fan of baked fish, but this was very tasty. Will definitely make again.

I love these simple recipes!  I used crushed garlic and blended it into the melted butter and brushed it on too the fish.  I also mixed the capers, lemon with some mayonnaise for the dip.  Soo good love Basa!!
