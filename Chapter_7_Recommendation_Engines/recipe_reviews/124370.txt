YUMMY! I made this yesterday for a bunch of my in-laws...I have a habit of cooking things I've never cooked before when I'm having company...brave or crazy?...I don't know. It was DELISH!  I took the advice of a couple other posters who said to add milk and sour cream...YUM! Because I'm cooking with a 20 month old running circles around me, I forget things...I didn't drop the butter in between the layers but we didn't miss it...it was probably better that I didn't use the butter. I will definitely make this again.  THANKS!

This is a pretty good recipe.  I made it per instructions and I reduced the servings to 4 instead of 12.  I think it may need a little milk to up the creaminess factor, but that's the way we like it.

Very good. Mine came out a little greasy. I think next time I will omit the butter and try several types of cheeses.

I was really in the mood for scalloped potatoes and this really hit the spot.  I picked this recipe because I had all the ingredients in the house and what a good choice it was.  There were NO left overs.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Family liked this and commented that they would like to have it again. Followed the recipe with the exception of whisking 1 can of milk into the soup before adding to the potatoes and this worked out very well. My only complaint is there was ALOT of oil/butter pooled on the top when I took it out of the oven. So much, that I had to take several paper towels and soak it up before I could put it on the table.  I'm not sure if it was the cheese or the addition of the butter (which is not needed) or a combination of both.  I will leave out the butter next time and shred the cheese by hand (purchased pre-shredded this time).  Family enjoyed it so I will make it again. Thanks for sharing!

Very good recipe-very simple.  Simple ingredients-so it is a good recipe for a last minute choice.  I wanted it to be a main course so I added some diced left over ham in the middle of the two layers.  Turned out very well!  Next time I will probably mix the ham in with the potatoes and soup to get it through out.  I will definately use again.

This was a great side dish. I even used fat free sour cream, soups (I followed one tip and used the sour cream and cream of mushroom, cream of chicken soup) and low fat cheese. Still a great dish.

Very good...I followed others advice and used one can cr of mushroom, one can cr of chicken, and mixed a little sour cream in too (a dollup), and they were delicious. Also, left them in for about 75 to 80 minutes so the potatoes would be tender (and they weren't mushy, they were just right..they weren't the only thing in the oven, though). Everyone cleaned their plates, and some had seconds. I was skeptical about the sharp cheddar, but I went with it, and I liked it (wasn't too sharp, but not bland at all). Will make again!

In all fairness I realize my rating doesn't really apply as I've made several changes.  I read other reviewers and went with there ideas & what I had available.  I sliced 6 large potatoes, used 1 can cream of mushroom & 1 can cream of chicken soups, I added 1 cup sour cream and 1 chopped medium size onion to soups before mixing in potatoes.   I used colby/monterey jack cheese instead of sharp cheddar.  I baked potatoes for 45/50 minutes uncovered at 375.  Layered potatoes and used cheese and butter as recipe states.  I thought it was really good.  I served with seasoned pork chops.

I went into this site to find a scalloped potato recipe and found this one....read the reviews and went with the 1 can on cr. of mushroom and 1 can of cr. of chicken and the cup of sour cream.  I added about a lb.of home baked ham cut into cubes.  Had the family over and only had about 2 cups left.  All loved it!  Will certainly make this again.

Very good - I added minced onion and seasoning salt to the potato/soup mixture.  Next time will probably mix in some cheese too, in addition to sprinkling it over the layers.  Definitely use a bit more cheese than it calls for.

Great recipe... the amounts should be adjusted to taste... I like a more saucy potato bake... Almost all ratios work. This is a very versatile recipe. I'll likely always use it!

Delicious and great for a cool night. I followed advice of others, omitting butter and adding chopped ham to the potato/soup mix. As there are only 2 of us, I cut the recipe down to 2 lbs. potatoes and 1 can of soup. However, it still took the entire 2C cheddar to cover the potatoes. Using a 9x13 pan means that even if you cut this recipe down, it'll still need all 2C cheese. Next time will make in a 9x9 and see if I can halve the cheese.

It was good. I added extra cheese, and had to cook an extra 10 mins. Next time I will use 1 can mushroom soup and 1 can cheese soup for extra cheese. People seemed to like it but I thought it was a little bland.

I had high hopes for this recipe, but unfortunately it fell flat, literally. The potatoes pretty much had NO flavor - i followed the recipe exactly. they were lacking any taste. 
Next time, I would use cream of cheddar soup instead, and probably double the amount of shredded cheese. Plus the potatoes MUST be salted and seasoned in order to make this taste better!

DELICIOUS recipe!  I didn't have cream of anything soup, so I used about 1 cup of light sour cream instead.  I also added shredded Asiago cheese with the cheddar cheese layers - just wonderful!  Served with salmon and steamed asparagus.  I'll definitely make this again.

Great recipe as is, but we also enjoy it with these changes: Cut recipe in 1/2 (just 2 of us), mix 1/2 cup sour cream with the soup, add 1 thinly sliced sweet onion with each layer. I have used other cheeses too. My personal preference is a mix of whatever I have on hand. Yummy, cheesy comfort!

very good, served for Easter and was a big hit... a good recipe when you have a crowd... we have some who won't eat onion, (also some who don't like mushrooms - but with this recipe no one even knew they were there). I did add one cup of sour cream like others had suggested.

I really liked this recipe, but I did add a few extras.  I diced up a medium onion and added imitation bacon bits along with salt and pepper to taste.  I used mild cheddar, I didn't have the sharp cheddar on hand.  I could see this recipe being a bit bland without the extras.  But with the extra's, it was a hit and everyone really enjoyed it.  This recipe has a very "hearty" flavor, the cheese and the mushroom soup makes it very tasty.  I hope you enjoy, I did!!

I made this with 2 cans of cream of chicken soup, sour cream and cheese. It was to die for! Definately not good if you're on a diet, but oh so good! And easy too! Will definately be making this again! :)

My potatoes were undercooked.  I used a toaster oven so I dont know if that could have made a difference but I cooked them longer than the recipe called for.  Regardless, my husband loved the flavor!

I took the advice from another review and substituted one can of the mushroom with cream of chicken but the mushroom flavor was still too strong.

It was kind of bland, but good.  Took about an hour and a half, so make sure you have padding on your menu time.

These potatoes are easy and delicious.  I used a combination of mushroom and chicken soups, omitted the butter and baked first 30 min. covered with foil.  Will definitely make again!

Very good and easy. I used low fat cheese and added low fat sour cream as other reviewers suggested.

Delicious!  I made some suggested substitutions (sour cream, only one can of mushroom soup with one can of chicken) I didn't have any cream of chicken, so I used half chicken broth and half whole milk.  Also added some seasoned salt and pepper, and some diced onion.  Was delicious and will DEFINITELY make again!

The scallop potatoes were excellent.  I followed step by step directions, because my potatoes never turn out right.  I used extra chesse, because my son loves cheese.  I also put bacon on my layers for my husband.  BOTH OF THEM ENJOYED THE scallop potatoes and this recipe earns all 5 stars.

Excellent but we added about 1/2 cup extra cheese and 1/4 cup more milk with about a tbsp of flour and a 2 tbsp of butter mixed in about halfway through. Microwaved halfway through without a cover and then covered with saran the other half of the cooking time. And cooked about 8 mins longer.....will make again for sure

This was an excellent side dish.  I used cream of onion soup since there are some mushroom haters in the house.  I only had one can, so I supplimented with sour cream.  I added some seasoning salt to keep the sour cream from making it too bland.  I probably also added more cheese than the recipe called for.  I add those things by sight, and I'm pretty sure I added about 3 cups.  My family loved it!

This is a fine comfort food recipe, but it tastes too much like the cream of mushroom soup that it calls for. I used exact amounts as called for in recipe (unless I mis-read or something), but it was too cream of mushroom-y.

The taste was good, but I think I used too many potatoes.  It seemed actually a little dry.  I would maybe suggest using more cheese, or a mixture of cheese.

It was a little bland as written.  I added seasoned salt, ground pepper and some extra cheese.  My husband loved it.  Just okay for me.

Very nice!  A simple, tasty, crowd-pleaser.  I used a russet variety, cooked in 70 minutes, and topped with shredded parmesan that I broiled for a couple minutes to a golden brown.

this came out really well!  and it's really easy to make.  i followed the recipe exactly as listed except for the cheese - all i had on hand was kraft slices so i just tore it up into little pieces and spread it throughout the dish and it worked great.  like others mentioned before me, the butter was a bit much so next time i'll use less butter, and would also like to try incorporating a different cheeses and switching up the type of soups.
