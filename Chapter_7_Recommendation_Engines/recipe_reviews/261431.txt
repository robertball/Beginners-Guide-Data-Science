This is a fun idea. I was worried that the graham crackers would get gritty from being at the bottom of the drink so I dusted the rim of the glass with the graham cracker crumbs. I didn't have a kitchen torch so marshmallows on a kebab/bamboo skewer over the stove burner worked great to put that char on the larger marshmallows. Some time under the broiler would also work if you don't have a gas range. The large marshmallows worked better as a garnish and while the small ones in the drink added the flavor to this classic flavor combination.

The Baileys, as always, made this a great ending to the day!

This was a good throwback to childhood (minus the Baileys).  Toasting the marshmallows really added to the s’mores toasty flavor.  The Bailey’s paired well when poured in and didn’t overpower the taste.  A very good dessert anytime of year.

I wasn’t sure this was a drink or something to eat with a spoon. It was both. I can understand the vagueness of the recipe.  You are free to adjust to your own preference.  I used less marshmallows than pictured.  I will try adding the Bailey’s and chocolate after toasting next time.

3+ Unless your a big liquor drinker you might need to add milk, half and half or ice cream like we did.

Great concept but a little strong.   We would have preferred a recipe that had a little more detail.
