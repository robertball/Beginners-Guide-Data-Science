Wow! Delicious! This recipe was easy to make into a healthy recipe! I used applesause instead oil, whole wheat instead of white for 3 cups of the flour & ground flax meal for the other 1/2 cup flour. Substituted Raptura all natural cane sugar for half the sugar and added chopped raisens and dates for the other half of the sugar, plus I added 1-1/2 cups chopped walnuts and a small package of crystalized ginger/chopped. Whole, hearty, pumkiny, still moist and GOOD FOR YOU TOO!!! :) Thanks for the recipe!

I LOVE this recipe!! It has always come out perfect and my family devours it!! I bought a 3-pk of aluminum loaf pans (8" X 3 7/8") and filled them 3/4 of the way. It leaves a bit extra to make a few muffins with as well. I have tried variations also, which seem to work BEST. 2 cups wheat flour and 1 1/2 all purp. flour, 1 1/2 cups brown sugar with 1 1/2 cups white sugar, and 1 cup of Apple sauce in place of the oil. This made it a bit healthier and not as "wheaty" as if I used all whole wheat flour. Still, this recipe is always moist!! ALSO, I have tried this SAME recipe (with the variations) and replaced the pumpkin with about 5 smashed bananas (2 cups) and added nuts. IT comes out perfect as well!

This was spectacular. I am definately going to make this again & I may try some of the variations that others have suggested as well. I am especially intrigued at the thought of replacing the oil with some apple sauce. I would also like to see what it would be like with a nice mix of raisins & a few chocolate chips added in. 

This is a very moist cake & as each oven varies I reccomend that you start checking on the loaf at around 55 mins. Cover with foil after 55 mins as it can take an additional 20 mins or so & the foil will help prevent too much crisping.

This turned out really well! I made some changes as per the other reviews, however. I wanted it to be really pumpkin-y, so I didn't put vanilla in, even though I was tempted to (another reviewer said it cut the pumpkin flavor). Also, I put in two 15 oz cans of pumpkin, which equaled exactly the amount of pumpkin called for AND the amount of water called for (skipped adding water). I also replaced one cup white sugar with packed brown sugar, since I wanted that richer/deeper flavor. Once it was done I tried a piece still warm from the oven and it was great. Froze it, tried it again after it thawed, and it was better! You could taste a bit more pumpkin afterward and it was still very moist. I followed the baking time others recommended here: Checked at 50 minutes (toothpick came out goopy, but the tops were browned perfectly). Lightly covered the tops with foil and baked for another 10–15 minutes. Done! I'll definitely make this again. I'm a chocoholic and usually can't help throwing some chips in, but another reviewer said it overpowers the pumpkin. I'm glad I left them out because this is sweet and delicious as it is. But I'm sure it'd taste great with a Nutella spread!

This recipe was great. I also substituted 1c of brown sugar, added a splash of vanilla and dusted it with confectioners sugar when done baking! Only baked about 65 min and placed a cake pan 1/2 full of water on rack below bread while baking to keep outside nice and moist!

GREAT recipe!

WHOLE WHEAT IDEA - I changed the 3.5 cups flour to 3 cups of whole wheat flour and cut the cooking time to 75 minutes and it was fabulous. So rich and hearty but moist and full of flavor. The first loaf was devoured in a day and the second one is being fought over.

This recipe is FABULOUS!  I have made it multiple times and it is always a huge hit by everyone, even non-pumpkin lovers.  I just made it tonight and used 1 cup vanilla yogurt in place of 1 cup oil and it is amazing.  By using the substitue I saved over 1000 calories in the loaf.  I also added chopped walnuts for a little nutty taste and texture.  No matter how you do it this recipe is a winner. Thanks.

This is a great pumpkin bread recipe.  I made two loaves, one eaten out of the oven and the other was frozen and eaten later.  Both loaves were delicious and the loaf that had been frozen retained all of its moistness and freshness after being thawed.  As the recipe submitter stated, this recipe is great for freezing the loaves.

I love fall and this is a wonderful fall treat... I halved the batch for one loaf as I had just some left over pumpkin from making a pumpkin dip (which was also yummy). I used 1 cup reg sugar and half cup brown sugar. Rather than adding a third cup water I just added some extra pumpkin. I also added finely chopped walnuts to the top. I baked for about 70 min and i have to say it is delicious. I have literally eaten about 5 slices myself. I was willing to forgo dinner for more bread yum:) Thanks for the recipe!

I cut this recipe in half. I made two small changes; I used melted butter instead of canola oil and I cut the sugar back in half again to 3/4 of a cup. I made muffins out of this recipe. I did not get ten, I got nine that were a little on the big side. 350 for 20 minutes and they were ready to go. This turned out okay--I wish it'd had more spices. It turned out really moist, just not really pumpkin-y or flavored with enough spice. If I were to make this again, I'd add more pumpkin instead of water, double the spices and maybe add some vanilla.

Made this to use up some fresh pumpkin I roasted, pureed, and froze in the fall.  Because I wanted to use as much of the 15+ bags of pumpkin taking up my freezer space, I decided to use pumpkin for the oil and the water.  I used a total of 4 c of fresh pumpkin puree (the equivalent of 2 regular size cans).  It turned out beautifully!  I made 1 loaf, and the rest into muffins (I made 12 regular muffins, and I mixed about 1/4 chocolate chips into the remaining batter and got another 6 muffins for a total of 18).  On the plain muffins and the loaf, I sprinkled some cinnamon and sugar on the tops before baking.  Oh, I also used all whole wheat flour.  All the moisture from the pumpkin covered up the "chewiness" that can sometimes present itself in quick breads using 100% whole wheat flour.

We ate the loaf with in a couple days, and I froze the muffins to be taken out the night before.  Both were very good, and we both seem to like the "day old" better than the fresh (the frozen muffins are included in the "day old").  The cinnamon and sugar kind of melted into a nice sweet cinnamon-y moist glaze.

I think that most of the remaining pumpkin will be turned into more loaves of this!

Completely edible but also very bland. Needs more texture and spice. Also would probably be better to substitute some of the white sugar for brown as the sweetness is just too flat. Also I made this in three pans on a cookie sheet which turns out is a very good idea as this will rise 2-4 inches. If you overfill your pan you'll have a mess.

I love pumpkin  really enjoyed this bread.  I sometimes add craisins to mine...they give it a little tang.  I use light tasting olive oil. A simple recipe. I agree...these make great holiday gifts and they do freeze well.  Thanks for sharing Sue.

This is a terrific recipe! I use applesauce in place of the oil and sometimes add nuts. It makes 5 small mini-loaves and they freeze great to give as gifts for the holidays!!

Great recipe!  I modified it like one of the other reviewers.  I used whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup of milled flax seed.  I also used only 2 cups of sugar and apple sauce instead of oil.  Walnuts were added and I didn't use raisins or the like since I am not a big fan.  Very moist and all my samplers loved it.  I will definitely be making it again!

This bread is absolutely delicious!  So delicious and so moist, and the spices were perfect!  Truly unbelievable.  The only issue I had was getting it out of the pan.  Some of it stuck to the pan and fell apart when I removed it.

1st time made according to directions and baked in loaf pans. Very dense and moist, great spice flavor. for the 2nd time, I fiddled and used 1 cup sugar, 1 cup splenda and about 1/2 cup agave. I also used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce. Then cooked in muffin tins. The texture was a bit lighter, but still really good. I'm also working on adding a cheesecake factor by adding a swirl of cream cheese, egg sugar and vanilla. Still work left to do to figure out how to make that work the best.

Fantastic recipe, thank you! I've made as the recipe says, and also with added fresh cranberries. Chopped or whole, they add a tang that goes well with this moist delicious bread! Have also made into mini-cupcakes, mini-loaves, and given as gifts. Thank you Sue!

Last year I followed this recipe exactly and it got rave reviews from my family.  So, of course I made it again this year.  However, I ran out of white sugar so I used half white and half brown sugar.  Then, I only had 1/3 cup oil so I used that plus 2/3 cup butter.  I think it was actually richer. My sister-in-law that doesn't even like anything pumpkin had 2 slices.  Great recipe!!!  Thanks!

This was my first time making pumpkin bread, and usually my first time making something isn't very good, but this bread tasted absolutely wonderful! It was so easy to make, and has the best flavor of any pumpkin bread I've ever had. I made it into muffins so I would have something to grab in the mornings as I hurry out the door. I put the batter into the pan and put different things into each muffin (chocolate chips, chopped walnut, raisins, and oats on the tops of some). Walnut was my favorite with chocolate chip in a close secong. Don't put too many chocolate chips in it though, or it overpowers the pumpkin flavor. I will definitely make this bread again. Delicious!

This is the best pumpkin bread recipe!  It's very, very moist and flavourful.  I did make some changes, though.  I used 1 cup of cooked pumpkin and 1 cup of shredded zucchini.  I aslo halved the oil and substituted the remainder with low-fat yogurt.  I also used 1 cup of sugar instead of 1 1/2 cups and it was still quite sweet.  I didn't have allspice, so I used powdered ginger instead.  I guess the new name should be "Low-Fat Pumpkin Zucchini Bread"!

This is a yummy recipe that is easy to make! I agree, it is better after a few days or after being frozen. Makes great Christmas gifts.

This bread is so incredible!  Great out of the oven and still so moist after being frozen. My husband likes it heated up with butter, and my Mom likes it with a little cream cheese. I eat it plain, but none of us can get enough!

This was my first time making pumpkin bread.  I made 2 loaves and it was a success. No one could believe I made it from scratch. I didnt use an electric mixer, I used a fork to mix it and it still came out great.

Everyone loves this recipe.  Instead of the oil I either use more pumpkin or applesauce.   Every loaf turns out perfect and it's a real hit all around.  Thank you for sharing!

This recipie is to die for. The secret is NOT overbaking the bread. If you want perfection then make sure it is as moist as possible. I substituted brown sugar for white and also added raisins and walnuts. Very yummy.

This recipe was wonderful.  I gave some to my brother-in-law, which does not like pumpkin bread and he loved it.  It is by far the best pumpkin bread I have ever had.

Okay-It was good.  I use 5 mini loaves.  I thought that the allspice was too much.  I like more of the pumpkin pie or pumpkin bars seasoning.  Everyone really enjoyed it the way it is (but I did sub 1/2 applesauce for oil).  I felt like it wasn't done inside but was almost burning outside.  But it was really moist and that's what everyone really loved about it.  I made it a second time but this time omitting the allspice, doubling the cinnamon and adding 1/2 tsp ginger.  I also went all applesauce (we need to be more healthy at our house-sad hmmmm).  I did add walnuts and raisens to this batch (first were all plain).  I did add a little butter-but butter is good-I made almost a crumb topping by mixing up oats, b sugar, cinnamon and cutting in butter and then sprinkled on top.  I turned down the oven to 315-320ish and left them in for 45 min (mini loaves).  I did leave them cool in the pans for 10 min or so.  Mmmmmm.  It was almost cake like.  I think next time I would add a dash of salt to the topping and maybe try the 1/2 ap and 1/2 oil.  This is a great base to build your own custom bread.  Thank you so much for giving me something fun to play with!

This turned out very well. I did sub 1 cup brown sugar, cover with foil after 50 min to prevent overbrowning., and add a splash of vanilla. It froze beautifully.  **Update** Just made this again and took a loaf (frozen, then thawed) to work.  Comments from my co-workers emails to me included: "The pumpking bread is DIVINE!" (She asked for the recipe.) "Your pumpkin bread is amazing!" and my favorite, "That is the tastiest bread-substance I have ever had.  And I am not prone to culinary hyperbole. Thank you!"  So yeah...this is an awesome recipe!  This time around the only thing I did differently, besides subbing 1 cup of brown sugar and covering it after 50 minutes, was pureeing my own pumpkins.  Thanks again for this terrific recipe!

Absolutely delicious. The changes I made are I used half white sugar and half brown sugar. Also, instead of oil, I used 1/2 cup vanilla yogurt and 1/2 cup applesauce, and threw in dried cranberries. VERY moist and perfect right out of the oven. I will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing.

I have made this bread (with very minor variations of my own) for the past 3 years and every year my family (literally) argues over it. My brother & nephew nearly came to blows over the last slice. Terrific recipe!!  Firm, moist...all the right things.

9-5-2018 ~Over many years of baking I’ve come to know that pumpkin bread recipes are all very much alike.  Where they vary, generally, are with add-ins, which can of course be done with any pumpkin bread recipe, or with spices.  Some call for quite a lot, some not much at all.  The amount and blend of spices with this recipe was just right for me.  Warm and aromatic and just plain pleasant, this is ideally spiced.  Just for grins, I added a cup and a half of raisins.  Nice.  (Note: for simplicity’s sake, use a 15 oz. can of pumpkin rather than measuring out two cups)

This is the easiest and tastiest pumpkin bread ever!!  I however made a minor adjustment or two. I used applesauce in place of oil and added vanilla.  The bread came out really moist.

Very well received at the in-laws.  Only mistake I made was trying to slice it too soon.  After cooling overnight it was much easier to slice.

My friend told me she found her pumpkin bread recipe on this site, and her bread was delicious. She couldnt remember which one it was though. I was hoping this was it. It could have been, but they tasted different. Maybe shes just a better baker. ;) This was pretty good bread though. People seemed to like it.

This recipe is fantastic!  I followed this recipe as written except I used 6 - 8x3 loaf pans and 1 - mini loaf pan.  I filled 6 pans 2/3 of the way and used the remainder of the batter in the mini so the batter wouldn't overflow.  They all rose beautifully and looked perfect.  Nice and crisp on top as well! This definitely replaced my usual recipe.

Decided to try a new pumpkin bread recipe.  This was a super moist and flavorful bread!  I made a few substitutions.   To cut back on the sweetness, I used 1 c. white sugar, 1 c. brown sugar, and 1/2 c. sugar/splenda blend.  To me, this provided the perfect amount of sweetness.  I also used milk instead of water.  The bread rose pretty high compared to most other quick breads I have made.  Will definitely use this as my regular pumpkin bread recipe.

So moist and yummy!  I can't wait to try it out in three days.  I did change a couple of things based on other reviews.  I did one of the cups of sugar as dark brown sugar, an extra tsp of cinnamon and a splash of vanilla.  I also followed the tip of putting a cake pan with water in it underneath to keep the top moist.  Very good!

The bread was good. I think I overcooked mine a little so I wouldn't cook it the whole 90 minutes. It wasn't sweet enough I think I will use some brown suger also next time. Mine also didn't rise very well. I will try this again though with adjustments.

Awesome, but I did modify it.  I used applesauce instead of oil, used brown sugar for the white, substituted more pumpkin for the 2/3cup water and added walnuts.  It did not last long, well worth the effort.

I made this recipe with a pan that holds 8 mini loaves. Mini loaves require 25 minutes at the same temp in the normal recipe. MUCH EASIER and faster. I added two extra shakes of every spice and Orange Craisins (cranberry raisins). Recieved an outstanding number of compliments, and will make this recipe every year. What a fantastic winter treat.

This is a wonderful recipe!!  I did replace the white sugar with brown sugar and am very happy with the results.  With this recipe I baked three mini loaves and one standard loaf.

We really enjoyed this bread. I used 2 cups whole wheat flour and used 1 c. Suconat, 1 c. evaporated cane juice and 1/3 tsp pure Stevia liquid in place of the white sugar. Also used about 1/4 c. applesauce and 3/4 c. oil. Although I'm sure the original recipe would be much more moist, this wasn't too dry. Thanks!

I don't know what went wrong - but I made this recipe exactly as stated and put in 1 large loaf pan and 3 mini ones and I didn't even use all the batter and it poured out all over my oven.  And what remained sunk and tasted bland.

This is a great recipe! It made about 7 mini loaves. I used butter instead of the oil, and didnt add the cloves (I didnt have any). Will definitely make this again. Thanks!

Excellent recipe.  My husband's eyebrows even went up.  I did make some changes.  I left out the Allspice (didn't have any), used Splenda instead of reg. sugar., substituted 1/2 cup "lighter bake" in place of oil, and used 2 real eggs and 1/2 cup of egg substitute.  Very moist and yummy.  I'm making more mini loaves today to freeze for holiday gifts.

My new annual punkin bread recipe! I only made 2 small changes, I didn't use allspice (we don't like it), and I used eggbeaters instead of eggs. We made mini-loaves, which took 75 minutes to bake. This is moist and delicious. A little country crock spread over a warm slice... it's heaven!

I have not tried it yet.  Looking at review and will try this one soon.
But:::: Can I use coconut oil instead of canola oil? Do you think it wil be Ok to use pumpkin spice instead of all the other spices it calls for as a short cut? Its what i have.

I have used this recipe for years, and it is always a huge favorite. Keeps well in the freezer so I can always have one on hand for a late breakfast or afternoon tea. I add 1/2-1 cup of golden raisins and 1/2 cup of pepitos, sprinkling a couple TBS over the top of the loaf for added flavor.

I thought that the bread itself, was excellent. It was perfectly moist and a little crispy on the outside which gave it an amazing texture. The spices chosen with the type of ingredients were okay and they tasted great in the final product; I would suggest adding and tad bit more of all of them just to give it a little more flavor. I also used canned pumpkin instead of freshly picked and pureed, I'm sure it is much better with organic or fresh pumpkin but all in all its much like a spice bread or a spice cake. I will definately be making this for the holidays and maybe just for a snack. My favorite use of this is for breakfast cause its better than a donut!!

This was my first attempt at pumpkin bread and it came out divine!  I shared it with friends and they all raved about it.  The only extra thing I did was to add 1 1/2cups raisins, just because I thought it was a good idea, they tasted great in it too.  I didn't have two loaf pans so poured 1/2 of the mixture into muffin trays and cooked those for 18 minutes.  Those were perfect as well!

This is a very yummy, hearty bread!  I substituted whole wheat flour for 2 3/4 cup of the flour, splenda for 1 cup of the sugar, and homemade pumpkin puree for all of the oil and water!  Pumpkin is an excellent substitute for oil in baking, but changes the flavor to...pumpkin!  So it works well in this recipe...VERY moist, hearty and delicious!

This is a great recipe! Very easy to make. I baked for 50 min, then tented with foil and baked 10 more so the tops didn't get too dry. The result was moist and warm - delicious right out of the oven! I did add a few cups of chocolate chips, and some more allspice (for a more pumpkin spice kind of taste),  but that was a personal preference. Thank you for sharing! Will be making again for the holidays.

This recipe is absolutely amazing!  It is definitely my favorite!  I even make it gluten free and because of how moist it is, you can't even tell.  Whenever I make this, I get a ton of compliments.  Have already made it several times this season and will make it many more!  Thanks for sharing!

Didn't change any ingredients.  Only changed total baking time to 80 minutes as it did over-bake the bread a bit. A definite go-to recipe for pumpkin bread anytime during the year but ESPECIALLY during the fall.

This is a good recipe, although I think my Grandmothers is better.  The spices aren't strong enough for our liking and it's not quite as moist as we like.  I added pecans and like other reviewers, I split the sugars into half white and half brown.  If you are going to make this....make sure to watch the cooking time.  I set my timer to 60 minutes (instead of the recommended 90) and it was overcooked by about 5 minutes.

I don't think I cooked it quite as long as the recipe calls for, and I covered it with foil until the last ten minutes to keep the top from over-browning.  

It was a hit at our Halloween party!

OUTSTANDING!!!  I've made this bread quite a few times this holiday season and EVERY time I give a loaf away, the recipiant always asks for the recipe.  I've been making pumpkin bread for many, many years and have to say that I tossed my old recipe and replaced it with this one!

YUM! I wanted to use up some leftover pumpkin from Thanksgiving and came across this recipe.  I followed the advise of others: omitted the water and monitored the baking time; I also halved the recipe as that was all the leftover pumpkin I had, and slightly decreased the amount of sugar.  It was done to perfection in 70 minutes and was well received among the pickiest eaters in my household.  This will be on our table again in the future!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very Very GOod. I used pumpkin pie spice in the place of the spices because I was out of nutmeg and it turned out tasty and pretty to look at. You could give this one as a gift for the holidays. I will definately make this again.

I made a few changes to suit what I had on hand.  First, I added a tblsp of honey and a tsp of vanilla extract.  I also changed the sugar to 2 cups white, 1/2c brown.  I added about 2/3-1cup of chopped walnuts and next time I may add some raisins or pecans.  I only  have one loaf pan, so I made one loaf and a dozen muffins (there was batter left over; could've made another 6 muffins if I had enough tins!).  The muffins cooked for about 25mins, the loaf took about 50-55min.  I would definitely not recommend leaving it in for 90; start checking around 50 as mine was totally done by then.  

This was simply delicious as a brunch item on Thanksgiving day.  I was looking for a way to use leftover pumpkin after making my pies for the day, and this fit the bill easily.  The muffins were gone within minutes; the loaf stuck around until noon the day after thanksgiving.  Sublimely delicious with melted butter or cream cheese!  I've already been made to promise to make this again, and I certainly will; it's very easy since my kitchenaid did the work for me, and except for the pumpkin, it is all ingredients I normally stock.  Excellent base recipe, excellent taste!

I have made this recipe many times so far over the Thanksgiving holidays, it froze well, many people said that they didn't care for pumpkin but really liked this after they tried it. Cooked up very moist. I made 8 mini loafs from 1 recipe to give to family and friends.

Yum yum! I thought it would be too spicy, but it turned out delicous.  I used a pumpkin I was carving for halloween and put the extra chunks in a food processor to puree it. It turned out perfect.

I've made at least 6 loaves of this since discovering it earlier in the month.  It's a winner at every Harvest Festival/Halloween party we've been to.  Thank you for sharing your recipe...it's perfect as is.

Yummmmy! I swapped out brown sugar for the white and adjusted the time down to 50 minutes. (my oven runs hot) The bread was moist, dense and delicious. I'm going to do like the submitter suggested and gives these to the girls at work, this Christmas!

I'm addicted!  Made a batch twice in one week.  So easy.  Third time I replace the oil with same amount of applesauce to save calories and fat.  Denser/moister texture but also good.  Like the original best.

The recipe is excellent however the cooking time was too long and after 1 hr the bread began to burn 45-55 minutes is plenty of time to bake

Absolutely delicious!  More like cake than bread!  Not too rich and not too sweet, but an excellent breakfast bread, coffee cake or dessert.

Best pumpkin bread I've ever had! I left out the cloves per others' recommendations (plus, I didn't have any...) but followed the recipe exactly except for that. We had warm slices after dinner...what a treat! Made two loaves and two 'jars' as an experiment, using the banana bread recipe idea on this website. Really neat idea, so fun and easy.

Amazing bread! Even with some healthy tweaks (I substituted half the sugar for stevia, 1/2 the flour for whole wheat flour and all the canola oil for sugar free applesauce). This bread came out incredibly moist, full of flavor and spice. I only made one loaf in case it didn't turn out and am definately regretting it now! I'm a much better cook than baker and am still struggling with breads, but this came out perfect!

I used this a couple times now. First time I made full batch using 2 cup of mashed pumpkins that were garden grown. As far as the spices are concerned I used 1 tablespoon of pumpkin spice and 1/4 tsp. of cardemom to kick up the taste a bit. It tasted really good. I baked 9 small loaves (~30 minutes at 350F), cooled and wrapped to give out to neighbors for the holidays. Worked really well!

This met with rave reviews at DH's work. I used a little less nutmeg, just a single 15-oz can of puree (I figured if I needed an extra ounce of liquid I'd add some milk, I did NOT need it), and I added half a bag of chocolate chips (just because I like them). This made 2 generously sized loaves which took more than 55 minutes and less than 90 minutes to cook, but I don't remember exactly how long because I started checking them at 55 minutes as per another reviewer. Thanks for the recipe!

This turned out just perfectly. It was light and fluffy, moist, and flavorful. I made it before the holidays to make plates of this and cranberry nut bread. My neighbors really enjoyed it and it really added something to the holiday spirit. I find that pumpkin bread left in the fridge tastes better than that left out. And as a child I used to eat leftovers with cream cheese for breakfast.

Followed the recipe. I'm not too adventurous. I did, however, use milk instead of water. I also didn't keep it in for the full 90 minutes. More like 60. Came out very nicely. I definitely surprised myself.  I added my picture to the gallery also.

This recipe is the best pumpkin bread recipe and I've tried bunches. Everyone who tastes it raves and raves about it. I have one of those 6 loaf silicone baking "pans" and I bake many, many loaves during the Thanksgiving holiday. I freeze them after they've cooled and then they become my holiday gifts in December to all of my co-workers or hostess gifts when I attend parties. My non-baking co-workers tell me that they look forward to them every year. The only substitution that I make is that I use apple cider (or juice) in place of the water.

Loved this recipe.  Tried an earlier recipe that called for Chocolate Chips.  Toke away from the pumpkin flavor.  Found this recipe and it was exactly what I was looking for. Followed the suggestions of other reviewers and covered with aluminum foil until the last 20 minutes. Came out perfectly, moist.  I did add toasted almonds and instead of all the spices, I used 4 tablespoons of pumpkin pie spice. Was great!

This is a scrumptious pumpkin bread recipe!  The only thing I do differently is add a 1/2 cup of raisins, which I think are healthy and delicious.

I usually dont rate a recipe unless I follow it exactly, but I decided to make this bread even though the only spice I had was cinnamon (I used 3 tsp.) and I used a cup of natures balance butter instead of oil.  My two year old was helping me make this and while I had my back turned he poured 1/2 cup of sprite into the mix.  I said "Oh well!" and continued on.  I did not expect much, but this bread was delicious!

YUMMY!  I added chopped pecans, an extra 1/3 cup of pumpkin, reducing the water to 1/3 cup.  Two days later it was even better than fresh.  Definately a keeper!

This is a terrific pumpkin bread recipe, very easy to make.  I halved the recipe exactly as I am the only one that likes pumpkin bread and it came out perfect.  Whenever I bake I always set my timer for a few minutes less than the time suggested and just keep checking.  This especially does require less time, but everyone's oven is different.

Mmmmmm!  This is a wonderful, moist and flavored bread.  I did not change a thing.  This will be the only pumpkin bread I will make from now on.  The only negative comment I have is that I baked it for 80 minutes instead of 90.  The edges got a little burnt after an hour and I kept it from getting worse by covering edges with some aluminum foil.  I think it's because I'm baking with a gas stove, something I'm still getting used to after 6 months of having to use one.  
Regardless, it was wonderful!

I only gave this a 3 because it was somewhat soggy.  I halved the recipe and made muffins with the batter.  I added pecans to the mix.  The muffins were very tasty but too moist.  If that's possible.  The tops of the muffins were some what doughy.  Not sure why.  Maybe It was something I did.  I did check them with a toothpick before getting them out of the oven.

I love this recipe. It's easy and delicious. I end up making three loaves with this recipe, and freeze the extras. I forgot to add the water last time and it was still yummy. I may actually start leaving it out on purpose because it makes a little more cake-like.

This is a very tasty excellant bread! I love the smell of this bread while its baking in the oven.  I changed two things to make it a little more healthy.  Replaced 1 cup of the white flour with whole wheat. Instead of 1 cup oil used 1/2 cup and 1/2 cup of applesauce.  Tasted great. Family really enjoyed it.  Ate one loaf with dinner last night and froze the second one.

Very good and moist recipe, but I changed it up a little based on the previous reviews.  I used 2 cups Whole Wheat Flour and 1 cup white; split the sugar into 1/2 brown and 1/2 white; used 1 cup non-fat vanilla yogurt in place of the oil; increased the amount of spice; baked for 45 minutes - covered with tinfoil then baked another 20 minutes.

This was my first attempt to make homemade pumpkin bread and it was awesome!  I used half whole wheat flour and half all purpose.  I also did not have allspice or cloves so I used ginger instead.  Great recipe!

I increased the spices, added 2t vanilla and replaced the water with honey and used 1c brown sugar and 2c granulated.  Outstanding with a bite.  One batch made 1 loaf and 3 mini loaves for gift giving.  Spraying the pans works well.  Keep an eye on the time, 60 min for the reg loaf.

This was so easy to make and so yummy. Mine cooked in about an hour and 15 minutes, but I was watching so it didn't burn! My husband and kids ate one loaf before it was even cool! I will definitely make this again.

This is a terrific recipe! I didn't have allspice so I left it out, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  The batter made two large loaves plus one mini-loaf.  We ate one loaf and froze the others, and Sue Case is right - this bread is even better after being frozen!  It was delicious - moist and just the right texture.  I will definitely make this again and again!  Thanks Sue!

*note: With breads I always keep a close eye on my oven and test the bread for doneness when it looks done.  I don't think I kept this in for 90 minutes, but I view that as more of a guideline anyway, since ovens do vary so much.  Take it out when it's starting to crack on top and a toothpick comes out clean or with moist crumbs.

This bread was supper easy, very moist & flavorful, i think it actually tasted better the next day. i put tin foil on after about 40 minutes so it wasnt too dark, it came out perfect, i made a  double batch & put chocolate chips in 2nd half. Instead of using shortening to grease the pans i use margarine, it leaves a better taste on baked goods than the shortening does

I made this for a family get-together and had several requests for the recipe. Very moist and tasty. I used two 9x5 loaf pans and they were done in 75 minutes - 90 would have been too long. They were the old-style silver pans, not the dark non-stick ones.

An excellent recipe.  Turned out perfect, and was dense and moist, just the way a loaf cake should be.  Keeps well, too.  I skipped the allspice as I didn't have any, and upped the cloves to a teaspoon as I like them, and the spicing was perfect.

Excellent recipe!!! I made a few modifications: used whole wheat flour, brown sugar instead of white, and left out the cloves and all spice, and added ginger.  Best sweet bread I ever made, my hubby ate the whole loaf and wanted more.  I will make some to hand out as gifts.  thanks for sharing.

This is by far my favorite pumpkin bread recipe.  

To dress this up a little, it's fun to drizzle a little maple syrup over a thick slice, then top with a dollop of whipped cream.

Perfect for the holidays - everyone I gave it to just loved it.  I took the advice of the original & frozen several to give away.  Will do it again next year!

Delicious. Check 5x9" loaves at 65-70 mins, not 90 minutes. Makes 4 mini loaves that only take 40-45 mins to cook. Very  good and moist.

I thought this recipe was very good and easy.  I cut the recipe in half (which required only 60 minutes in the oven) and omitted the allspice because I didn't have any.  I happen to LOVE cloves so I added a pinch more.  It is not too sweet, which is good.  This would be delicious with cream cheese glaze or frosting!  My husband and I enjoyed a healthy slice of the bread with our coffee this morning.  Great recipe to make with the kids.

This recipe is just the BEST!!... Since we have all come on hard times, this pumpkin bread makes a wonderful gift anytime of the year. At Christmas I give mini loaves wrapped in colored plastic wrap. I've had no complaints yet, only requests for more through out the year.. So easy & inexpensive to make... Thank you!! * :)

I used egg beaters because I dent have eggs :-( and used one can of pumpkin.  I also put it is pie tins ( 3 total) and baked it for 20 minutes  with a crumb topping -until a tooth pick inserted came out clean.  and it was amazing!  put two in the freezer for holiday breakfasts.  YUM.  - love the added crumb topping!!

Delicious!  I added one cup of coarsely chopped pecans for a little texture.  I also followed the advice of others, using a whole 29oz can of pumpkin and omitting the water.  Using three loaf pans, my breads were done in about 60 minutes.

Made these Saturday into 24 cupcake tins sprayed with Pam.  Excellent.  Bake them about 20-30 mins. Put them into sandwich bags and into freezer for quick breakfast at school for kids or the office for mom & dad.

I cut the recipe in half and it made one large, very nice loaf.  It took exactly 90 mins to bake!  I usually make the recipe word for word, but I only had 1 egg.  So I had to use 1 egg and substituted the 2nd egg with a large heaping tablespoon of natural applesauce.  No problem - it turned out super fluffy and tasty!  I also didn't have nutmeg or ground cloves and it still was yummy. A+ WINNER!

Next time I'll make 2 loaves and freeze the other, as half of the loaf is already gone with only 3 people!

This pumpkin bread was wonderful! I made a few alterations in attempt to make them a little healthier. I used 3 cups white wheat flour and 1/2 cut ground flax seed. I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce. 1 cup white sugar; 1 cup brown sugar. I also altered the amount of spices, I used 2 tsp. Cinnamon, 2 tsps. nutmeg, the cloves and allspice I used what the recipe recommended. I also only baked mine for 60 mins. instead of 90 mins. as recipe recommended.

Made this recipe as written, it was delicious. I think it needs to sit for a day to let all the flavors meld together, I won't change anything other than to add some pecans.

Great pumpkin bread!  I used 1 1/2 c applesauce instead of canola oil and  water. and added an 8-oz package of dried cranberries, subbed in 1/4 c ground flax seed for 1/4 c flour.  DH loves this, wants more.  I didn't care for the nutmeg, but that is easily remedied.  As stated, this freezes well.

Wow! I am always trying new recipes, and never bother to review, but this time I had to! I stuck to the recipe exactly, except that I used 2.5 tbs of pumpkin pie spice instead of what was called for. This was moist and delicious, my quest for the perfect pumpkin bread is over. Planning to make a double batch later this week!

This was really good, all I changed was I also used applesauce instead of oil and used 1 TBSP of cinnamon 2 tsps of nutmeg, then whipped the eggs and sugar together intill they were white peaks mixed in the applesauce then the pumpkin and dry ingrediants, used apple juice instead of water.

This is an excellent Pumpkin Bread recipe.  I made it about a month ago and gave a loaf to my parents.  My Mother made a special request that I make it for Thanksgiving, which I did.  It is a big hit with my family.  Thank you for posting this great recipe.

I can't vouch for this bread tasting better after being frozen, because my bread never lasts long enough to get to the freezer! I am not a pumpkin pie person, but I adore this recipe. It works equally well as an alternative dessert or as breakfast the next day.

Wonderful Recipe , each batch made approx 12 mini loaves !
I did add pecans to this , and like others i tried the 2 cups white sugar and 1 cup brown . and substituted pumpkin pie spice (4 tsp) for the spices since they werent on hand .
Extremely moist , dense and very flavorful.

This was my first try at pumpkin anything! I used my own pumpkin from the garden. It was so good that it was gone before I was able to freeze any for the holidays. I didnt want to buy cloves and allspice just to try this recipe, so I just used more cinnamon and nutmeg and it was really good!

Very, Very good. I have already made it a few times. I steam the pumpkin myself, instead of buying the store-bought. It is very good after being frozen too.

I liked this recipe. Produced two full-sized loaves that were moist and flavorful. I only used 2 cups of sugar.  I didn't put in all the spices due to personal preference. I also added 2/3 cup of coconut milk instead of the 2/3 cup of water.  I will definitely make this a holiday favorite.

I made this for my husband to take with him on Thanksgiving to work. My husband and his crew are working Christmas this year also. It was such a big hit all the other firefighters requested it for their Christmas Day dinner!  Oh and I did use the entire can of pumpkin, w/ all those mouths to feed who can afford to waste it. And It did freeze very well.  Thank you for a great recipe.

After reading many of the reviews, I substituted apple sauce for the oil, used a mixture of brown and white sugar, and used 3 eggs and 1 egg white.  I also added raisins for texture and did not add any water when mixing.  The bread came out moist, dense, and wonderful.  In the future I'll cut back on the sugar by 1/2 cup to offset the sweetness of the applesauce.  However, even a little sweeter than normal this bread has been a huge hit in my house!

Very delicious. I've made this before, but forgot how so I found this, and it looks pretty close. One addition to this I would recommend is cranberries. Craisins work well. Walnuts are also good. I don't like to add both craisins and walnuts because then it gets too dense and overwhelms the delicate pumpkin flavor. I used whole wheat flour a couple of times, which added a bit of depth to the flavor and gave it a grainier texture.

I did make this several different ways, the original being the very best. I also made it with wheat flour to make it "healthy" and it was good, but did taste like health food.  That would be good for the health nut in your life.  I also made it using applesauce as a substitute for half the oil and eggbeaters.  Admitedly not as good as the original, but a great low fat alternative.  It's also good for those who like a less heavy and rich bread. It came out lighter and fluffier. I also wonder if I could use more pumpkin (like the rest of the can) in place of some of the oil.  I did use canola oil, by the way, and it was still fantastic.

This is the best recipe for Pumpkin Bread I've ever tried.  I have friends that have stomach problems and can't eat a lot of fruits or nuts.  They just loved it, also it did not bother their stomach's.  In fact they are leaving for Europe and asked if I could make them a loaf to take on their trip.

Make sure to monitor your baking time as 80 minutes was even too much in my oven (which doesn't have a history of running hot).  Bread was good, lots of spicy flavor.  I used applesauce, 2 cups whole wheat flour, 1 1/2 cup white flour, egg beaters and added walnuts.  Wish it had a tad more pumpkin flavor versus spice, however, still quite good.  Husband loved it.

This is a good basic pumpkin bread recipe, but I think it needs jazzed up a bit.  I did change it a little & substituted one cup of brown sugar for one cup of the white sugar & substituted buttermilk for the water.  Next time I will add more spices & either chocolate chips or cranberries & pumpkin seeds.  I also made 7 mini loaves instead of two big loaves. It is VERY moist & my 3 year old & 11 month old loved it. Would make nice hostess gifts for the holidays.

This was a superb recipe for pumpkin bread to which I added/channged the following:  ¼ C whole wheat flour as part of the AP white, Splenda + brown sugar for the white sugar, ½ apple sauce ½ canola oil for all oil, egg substitute for the eggs and added ¼ cup each raisins and chopped walnuts mixed into the last addition of flour. The result was awsome!  Dense, moist, flavorful.  This is definitely a keeper!  Thanks for sharing, Sue.

This was delicious!  My family loved it.  I added raisins which I think was a very nice addition.  Next I would like to experiment with other reviewers healthier modifications (whole wheat flour, applesauce, etc.) as this was definitely more of a dessert bread.

This is very tasty!  Even in 100 degree weather in August!  Only cooked this recipe for an hour and 10 minutes and it was perfect. I didn't have all the spices so I just put in 1 1/2 teaspoon of  cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg.  I also replaced 1 1/2 cups of the regular flour for whole wheat flour.

A great, basic recipe! It made 7-8 mini loaves for me, baked for about 50min. I added lots of spice (allspice, pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon), 2tsp of vanilla (cuts some of the pumpkin flavor for those who don't like pumpkin too much), and folded in 1 bag of dried cranberries.

This is fantastic!  We had a dinner party recently and even the husbands told their wives "get this recipe!"  I also agree that you should only cook it for about an hour.  This made 6 mini-loaves for me. Great recipe.......thanks Sue!

I doubled the recipe and added raisins and chopped pecans to half the batter.  The traditional and the variation both came out "Yummy!" I gave some out to a couple special neighbors but my family won't let me share any more! Thanks!

I wouldn't say this was the best pumpkin bread I've ever had.  It was o.k., but it was missing something, couldn't quite put my finger on what it was, maybe more nutmeg???  Otherwise, it was kind of bland.  I won't be making this one again.

I have used this recipe for the past two years and it has been a big hit!  It goes almost as quickly as the pie!  I will definitely be using it again!

Thanks for sharing the recipe.  I will be making it often.

very good and moist. I think it is better the next day. I added 3/4 cup each of semi-sweet chocolate and milk chocolate chips. It took only about an hour in my oven though. will make again.

I LOVE this pumpkin bread.  It has been a lot of years since I had this so I don't know if this is the pumpkin bread of my childhood or not, but don't really care.  I make it as close to the recipe as I can living  where there is no canned pumpkin and I don't remember how it was.  I don't add the water because I'm afraid it will make the batter to runny ,  though today I'm hoping it isn't to thick.  I made it at Christmas and everyone is still talking about it.  I do up the spices as a personal preference.  When  I made it to give away  to people the first time I didn't  up the spices; now I know people here like a lot of spice, so I have.

Made exactly as directed and it turned out good.  It is true that after freezing and thawing, it has even more flavor. This recipe is simple and easy to make, and for me it worked out and seemed to please the family.

Fantastic. I used self rising flour one omitted leavening and salt. I used equivalent amount of pumpkin pie spice instead of measuring assorted.  I used white and brown sugar and maple syrup. I baked for less time and used a toothpick and a thermometer to test for doneness. I didn't want it to burn. I'm very happy with the result.

Easy to make and came out perfect the first time.  The choice of pumpkin makes a huge difference.  Try a few brands and stick with the one that you like the best.

I took the suggestion of another reviewer and doubled the pumpkin, leaving out the water and vanilla. This recipe made 24 very full muffins. I added a basic streusel topping with some chopped pumpkin seeds thrown in.  Baked at 350 for about 25-30 minutes. My friend who loves pumpkin anything said these were the best pumpkin muffins she's ever had.

I put the batter into the loaf pan and put it in the oven, and left to do something else for 90 mins. Came back, and the loaf was burnt. The now "crust" was almost black, but when I cut it open, tearing away the outer layer,  it was steaming and the bread was at the perfect texture. Shoulda covered the pan in aluminum foil as the tip said. Tearing away the "crust", it still tasted delicious though.

I have made this exactly as written many times. It is good. However, I now use it as a base recipe. I add walnuts, cut the sugar to 2 cups, add vanilla, add more cinnamon, and add a teaspoon of cardamom. My rating is based on original recipe.

Delicious. But had a problem with the batter not being fully cooked at the bottom, even after 95 minutes.  It was close, but a quarter inch seemed stodgy on the bottom. Perhaps I put too many raisins in it.

I used half of he butter instead of oil, then used a half of a cup of apple sauce and apple butter mixed. Did 1/3 wheat flour. Also added one cup of chocolate chips. The recipe is very moist! Very pleased with how it turned out. Works for muffins too!

I cut recipe in half to only make 10 servings. I used only 1 cup of sugar and between 1/3 and 1/2 cup of oil. I also added 1/4 c of chopped pecans. The bread cooked for about 40 minutes and came out moist and perfect. It’s sweet but not too sweet. Just how I like it.

It looks like you didn't add all the ingredients.  Your's looks like it has maybe raisens in it, but none are added.  Are those raisens or chocolate chips?

Absolutely wonderful pumpkin bread! I did as many other reviewers and split the sugar between brown and granulated. I also decreased the sugar a bit. Added some chopped walnuts and 1/2 cup chocolate chips. One of the moistest quick breads I've ever made.

I had 3 cups of fresh pumpkin so I made one and a half of this recipe. I used part apple sauce and part oil and made 3 loafs, 6 muffins and 2 mini loafs. Turned out grand! If I don’t freeze them now they certainly won’t make it past the evening. My husband has been hovering around the kitchen sniffing the air.

Super easy to make. Took me less than 15 minutes to gather it all and get it mixed together. Also.. I used homemade pumpkin puree and so cut down the water. Will update upon tasting! ??

I have made many pumpkin breads as this was by far the tastiest I have ever tried! The inside is moist while the outside is sweet and crispy. Mine only cooked for 75 minutes and any longer would have been too long.

Delicious recipe.  A couple of changes; I didn't have canola oil so I used coconut oil.  Also didn't realize I had sweet potato puree ,so I used that and a can of pumpkin.  Mostly sweet potato.  Still and all, as a pumpkin bread, Im sure it still would have been awesome!  Hope this is helpful. Its always good to improvise too!

I enjoyed this recipe! It was a little bland, so I suggest eating this pumpkin bread with butter. I also suggest using flour to help the loaves come out of the pan after baking, instead of using aluminum foil. I used mini loaves and it worked really well! Great for fall and Halloween!

I made it with 1 cup of brown sugar and 2 cups white sugar and I used 1/2 cup of applesauce with 1/2 cup oil and it was delicious.  I'm sure the original is great but if you want to make these substitutions you should be quite happy.

I have made this recipe several times. I would recommend using 3 loaf pans and 1 mini loaf pan. 2 pans is incorrect. Also the baking time is only 60 minutes not 90 minutes. Other than that it's perfect!

My go to pumpkin bread recipe. It makes about 2.5 loaves in the pans I have so I just make an extra mini loaf and it's perfect. I've made this recipe halved too. I've also made variations with different combos of walnuts, cranberries, and semi sweet chocolate chips. A+ every time!

I made this recipe with a few of the suggested changes.  I used applesauce instead of oil, though I did add 2 TBSP OF olive oil. I added vanilla extract, valence orange peel, increased the cinnamon to 1 TBSP, and rather than do the ingredients separately,  just added everything to one large bowl and mixed. I also added about a cup of chopped pecans. It turned out amazing and made 2 loafs. Be sure to check it after an hour and then lightly cover with foil to prevent over browning.

This bread is delicious, however, I could not give it 5 stars, because  I changed it as per some reviewers ideas. I cut the sugar back to 1 c. white and 1 c. brown, doubled all of the spices (except the cloves), threw in 1/2 tsp. of powdered ginger and also 1/2 cup of fancy molasses with the wet ingredients (I like the dark rich colour). After all my tampering with this, the batter seemed very light and moist,  so didn't use all of the water suggested. I got three medium sized loaves and they only took about 50 minutes to bake. Yumm -  spicey and moist.

Made it as the recipe stated.  It was good and moist.  Not the most amazing thing ever, but certainly good and good enough to take to parties or give as gifts.  The batter was more than 2 loaves so I filled 2 mini loaves as well.

Very moist. Followed all the ingredients, but I do add a lot more cinnamon and all spice to really make it more flavorful. I feel that lots of pink in breads lack that pumpkin spiced taste .

I used fresh pumpkin and cut the liquid in half.  I am able to make two large loaves and four mini loaves with this recipe.  I also don't bake it quite as long, 45-50 minutes.  The family loves it.

Awesome, easy to follow recipe! I baked mine for one hour and that was plenty, any longer and it would burn. Used one medium loaf pan and a 8x8 square inch silicon mold. The flavor is nice! Surprisingly you can taste all the spices. I was skeptical about the spices and thought I should add more but I'm glad I didn't because it came out nicely.

The bread was extremely moist, but could be a bit sweeter with more spice. My husband loved it the way it was though. I substituted 3/8 cup Greek yogurt for half the oil (1/2 cup) to reduce the fat. Even with the substitution, the bread was really moist.

This recipe was amazing. To make it healthier, I replaced the oil with a cup of unsweetened applesauce and I used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup regular sugar instead. Moist, delicious and less fat!

I used 3 1lb tin coffee cans to bake in rather than loaf pans. Coat them just like a regular pan and fill to the 3 ring from the top or it will overflow as it bakes. When you pull the bread out it will have serving size rings baked right into the loaf!

Definitely good.  I used 1/3 splenda and 2/3 sugar to cut the sugar a tiny.  I also did not add the 2/3 cup water, and not sure if that is the reason but only had to cook for 45 minutes (half the listed time) - used same temp though.

I have made this twice and it turned out nothing like in the picture. Please tell me if it's possible for the bread to turn out as nice as it looks in the pic because both times mine collapsed in the middle after cooling off and I followed the recipe exactly as it is. Only thing I did not add cloves. It tastes great though and people want me to make it again. Thanks!

This also makes wonderful pumpkin muffins! That's a much faster way to bake this bread. I just sprayed the pans with regular baking spray. They bake up very pretty, too, with a nice rounded top. Some of mine I topped with walnut halves, which is beautiful and delicious. I think the nut is more flavorful roasted, as it is when it's on top, than it is mixed into the batter.

Tried this for the first time, was good but not great.  I cut recipe in 1/2 to have 1 loaf.  Also made couple other changes ppl suggested - substituted water for more pumpkin, substituted part brown sugar (1 c granulated, 1/2 c brown), and added 1/2 c chopped walnuts.  Only baked for 70 min but actually a little overdone.  Not sure what to change to make it perfect.

This was really good, though maybe try a lower temperature for longer- though that could just be my oven.

Great bread! I substituted the allspice for 1/2 tsp. each cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg (added to the amounts already asked for in recipe), used 2 and 1/2 cup white sugar and a half cup brown sugar, and I only had 2 eggs so for the other two I mixed together in a glass bowl 3tbl. veg. oil, 3 tbs. water, and 2 tsp. baking powder and added to sugar/egg/oil mix. One 15 oz. can of pure pumpkin was just the right amount.

This is a great recipe.   I forgot the water and it was still delicious. I made smaller loaves and adjusted the time.  I made this with gluten free all purpose flour (Jules). And it was great. Definetly one to repeat!

I love this recipe. I did do 2 small changes like other reviewer suggested. I used 1/2 apple sauce and 1/2 oil. I also used 2 cups of brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar. I also added 1 tsp of pumpkin spice. I did not add any extra water or moister. I made 72 mini muffins baked at 350 for 14 min. my kids took them to their Christmas party they were so good.

Great recipe without the changes!! However, it wasn't enough pumpkin and spice for me so I used a 29 oz can of pumpkin and doubled the spices. I also used a bundt cake pan. Because of the extra pumpkin I had to cover the bread with foil at the 45 minute mark and bake it for an extra 10-15 minutes so that the middle would cook all the way and the top wouldn't burn. It came out AMAZING(: My boyfriend isn't a huge sweets fan, but now he wants me to make pumpkin bread all the time(: I highly recommend!

I loved this pumpkin bread. I added 1 cup  chopped pecans  and left out the cloves since my husband dislikes the flavor of cloves. I will be making this recipe again.

Every where I have taken this bread it gets devoured. Then everyone asks for the recipe. It's the best ever to make ahead and freeze. My entire family can't wait for fall when I make this bread. I absolutely love this recipe and the finished product had never failed me.

This recipe was a huge hit at work & with the family...even my co-work, who thought she hated anything with pumpkins, loved it.  It was super moist and goes extremely well with a nice scoop of forzen yogurt on top.  However, if you are going to use fresh pumpkins (not from the can) you may need to add a little more flour.  On my first try, I found that the fresh pumpkins added more water.

Delicious!  I didn't end up needing the 2/3 cup water; it would have been too soggy.  Also, I don't like nutmeg, so I added another teaspoon of allspice instead.  I baked the two loaves for 85 minutes, and covered them with foil at 55 minutes as suggested in another review--I do think that helped prevent it from becoming too crispy.  I will definitely make this recipe again!

My family loves this pumpkin bread! I follow the recipe exactly as written, and it comes out perfectly every time.  It is absolutely one of my go-to recipes for any occasion - a treat for my family, holiday snack, bake sale item or when bringing a baked good to a function. Enjoy!

I followed the recipe exactly except for baking time and it was so moist and flavorful. This will definitely become a regular recipe of mine.  I knew 90min sounded way too long and read the other reviews.  I baked a total of 60 min and tented it at 50 min (I have an older electric stove).  I probably didn't need to tent but I was unsure of how long it would take to finish.  Just use the toothpick method to check when it is done.  At 50 my toothpick came out "dirty" but by 60 I could feel the bread had finished and the toothpick came out clean.  Awesome recipe!!

This recipe is very good and pretty moist. It is a great pumpkin bread. I was concerned over baking it for so long though. Based on the advice of another reviewer, I baked it for 50 minutes, then took it out, lightly foiled it and baked it another 19 minutes. I actually wish I would have baked it only 15 minutes more, tops!! I was a bit disappointed with how dark the bread turned out. I will, however, make it again, and I am hoping it tastes better tomorrow. It is very good in my opinion, but not excellent. I will give this four stars.

This is a wonderful pumpkin bread...so moist and tasty.  
I make the recipe, omit the sugar until the end, then divide the mixture in half.  Half gets splenda for my diabetic husband, the other half gets sugar.  It works out wonderfully for both of us.  We each get a loaf.

Yummy! I did make changes as per others suggestions. 1 c brwn sauger and 2c white. 1cup applesauce rather than oil and increased the cinnamon to two tsp rather than one. I also omitted the water and exchanged it for the 2/3 cup pumpkin. Lots of flavor moist and fluffy! I am adding this to my only tried and  true recipe collection.

It was amazing! Easy enough even for first time baker!
I didn't have all spice so I left it out, and it's still wonderful!
The second loaf I added some dried cranberry, and it taste even better without it. Will make this again!

Wow.. This is unbelievable good!!  I was cooking pumpkins for pies and I had some leftover pumpkin puree..  I "halved" the recipe for one loaf by changing servings from 20 to 10.  My 3 and 5 year old kids keep coming to me.. more pumpkin bread please.. Next year we will make the full recipe.. maybe even more..

I had fresh pumpkin puree, so used with McCormick's pumpkin spice. The batter tasted great and I couldn't wait for the bread to bake. Excellent! Thanks.

FANTASTIC!! I had cooked and pureed a pumpkin the other day, so I used fresh pumpkin (canned pumpkin- blech). I didn't use any of the water called for in the recipe. I didn't see the point? I doubled the recipe and since that was a LOT of eggs and oil to use I used banana and applesauce for 1/2 of it. (not a big change, just a normal ingredient substitute and you can't even tell) Everyone LOVES it & I will definitely make it again.

mini loaves- 1 hr bake time;
reg loaves - 1 1/2 hr bake time.

Just made both pumpkin and a banana bread from this recipe for my grandson. The only change I made was brown sugar instead of white. So good I have to make more for myself! Yummy. Thanks for the recipe!

very moist and delicious. People who dont normally like pumpkin loved it. I used self rising flour and homemade pumpkin puree. I also prepared this in a bread machine. I had to bake it a second bake cycle this way. It was still delicious!

I tried this recipe with fresh pumpkin puree and it was too much flour, the flavor was alright but not the moist and soft texture bread should be. I will try again with another well known recipe.

Made this yesterday before Hurricane Sandy came. I cut the recipe in half for one loaf. I used a bunt pan cooked for 45 minutes. I used 1 cup suger and no baking powder. I aslo added dry yellow cake mix on the top then saturated that with melted butter. It came out amazing and super moist! I highly recommend it. Almost forgot I didn't use cloves or allspice. Still Fab-U my husband inhaled it!

For the gluten-free folks out there-- I subbed a popular gluten-free pancake/baking mix for the flour in this recipe and kept all other ingredients the same. Worked beautifully with this recipe! Those who could eat gluten at the Pumpkin Party were pleasantly surprised at the deliciousness of gluten-free Pumpkin Bread.

This was really good. I was out of oil so I used butter instead and halved the recipe. My husband also loved it and had a hard time waiting the hour and a half for it to cook. Yum! Also great for breakfast.

Very moist and delicious.  I halved it to make only one loaf, but it disappeared so quickly that I wished I had made two loaves.  I baked it for 80 minutes and it was done.

This was a surprise, just using up left-over pumpkin from pies - but this was more popular than the pies.  Delicious, great texture and color.  Won't wait til fall to make these again!

Bread tastes delicious but the cook time for me was not right.  The first batch nearly burned at 90 minutes.  Made it 20 minutes shorter.

Good basic recipe.  I actually used butternut squash that I had cooked and pureed ahead of time and left out the water.  I also changed 1 cup brown sugar for white.  I would like to try the applesauce and I'd probably cut the sugar a bit next time, too.

Super moist and delicious, this recipe is a keeper. The only changes I made was using whole wheat flour and adding walnuts. This is definitely a fattening bread but very delicious

Very moist and delicious but the cooking time should only be 55  minutes.  I left it the entire 90 minutes the first time I made it and it was overdone and burned.

I made this recipe with King Arthur Gluten-Free Multi-Purpose Flour, and rice milk instead of dairy. (I'm nursing our 3-month-old daughter, and taking dairy out of my diet cured her colic, which probably can safely be called lactose or cow milk intolerance.) I also adjusted the spices to my personal tastes. It worked very well and got rave reviews! My personal adjustments:

1 tbsp cinnamon
1 tbsp nutmeg
1/2 tsp cloves
1/2 tsp allspice

Very moist and delicious! I will definitely make this again.  My family finished a loaf in a couple of days and we gave another to our neighbor.  I wanted to add raisins but forgot this time around, will definitely try it next time.

This is the best recipe for pumpkin bread that I have ever tasted.  I didn't add the cloves because I didn't have any, but it was so good!  It turns out so moist, I seriously could have had the whole pan!  Sinful I know!!!  :)

Verry good. It came out verry soft and moist my family loved it.
