I followed this recipe exact only omitting the cinnamon as it was optional. The nuts I used in this recipe were pecans. Instead of baking it on parchment, I just cooked them as I usually do on an ungreased, unlined baking sheet. They turned out perfect--just like the picture. Thumbs up from the whole family. They're already half gone!

In terms of ingredients, one chocolate chip cookie recipe is pretty much like the rest.  It's the subtle differences in those ingredients that, in my view, distinguish a mediocre or average chocolate chip cookie from a great one.  This one is average.  The flavor was okay, tho' I did reduce the salt by half and the cookie was just fine with that amount. But for me they're too greasy and soft. (Not cake-like at all, as some reviewers have remarked.  Not even close.)  A little more flour, perhaps a quarter cup, or equalizing the amounts of brown sugar and granulated sugar (brown sugar tends to make cookies softer) would probably take care of the problem.  But then that would be a different recipe, illustrating my point that it's the little nuances of a basic recipe that take it from good to great.

Wow, this is great! It's my new favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe. I wouldn't have thought to add cinnamon, but it gives a special something extra. The only thing I would suggest is using unsalted butter. It doesn't specify to do so in the recipe, but maybe using salted butter and the salt called for in the recipe is the reason some had less than perfect results? I'm not a pro, but my cookies turned out great, and that's what I used.

This cookie recipe is sooo yummy...I followed the recipe ingredients exactly. I just didn't put the flour, salt, etc. onto parchment paper b/c that just seemed silly, just put it in a bowl and mix. : )

this recipe is perfect except for the fact that my cookies turned out a bit too salty.... they had a distinct salty taste. otherwise they were great! slightly crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside and the taste was on point. gonna use this recipe for spirit week at school soon! thanks for sharing :D

my cookies came out perfect!! I didn't add any cinnamon or salt, and I made sure my butter was completely melted I read somewhere it makes a difference. I had to leave my cookies in for 20 - 25 minutes 10-12 wasn't enough they were still raw in the middle. I wish I could upload a picture it wont let me for some reason but thanks for the recipe

These cookies are great! My 4yo daughter helped me make them, which is usually a recipe for disaster (none of the measurements are exact because she spills a little here and there), but they turned out fine. I didn't see they called for cinnamon (optional) until we were already making them, so I used a little pumpkin pie spice, and it was a nice touch. I don't normally add spices to chocolate chip cookies, nor quite so much vanilla, but those things just might make the difference for these delicious cookies. My husband says this should be our only chocolate chip cookie recipe!

I see that some people think it's too salty. I was using salted butter, so I only used a pinch of salt, instead of a whole teaspoon. And another reviewer said they lacked flavor - I also used milk chocolate chips instead of semisweet because my husband prefers milk chocolate. The flavor in this combination was just very very good!

pretty good, but I've had better.  Needs a little more flavor for me.  Maybe more chocolate or something.

Made these today, turned out great. I used mini chocolate chips (that's what I had), and sprinkled sea salt on top before baking to bring out the flavor. This is a great recipe, will definitely make again. My husband said they were the best chocolate chip cookies he's ever had.

I'm not crazy about the slight cinnamon taste of this cookie.  I love cinnamon, but it just doesn't seem to blend right in this case.  Also, probably my fault, but the cookies were more like wafers.  I tried refrigerating the dough and changing the cooking time but nothing helped.  The only thing I can think that I might have done wrong was sifting the flour before measuring it?  So I am still searching for the best chocolate chip cookie recipe.

Very good recipe. The cookies turned out chewy and soft. I omitted the cinnamon and added 1/2 a teaspoon of baking powder. I also used 1/2 semisweet and 1/2 milk chocolate chips instead of all semisweet.  I didn't use parchment paper either. I used ungreased baking sheets and it worked just fine.

I've made this recipe many times.  So I though I should write a review.  1.  I've never really liked nuts in cookies so I never added them.  2. Never used parchment paper  3. I use a teaspoon instead of a table spoon.  4. Never used cinnamon.  Other than that, great recipe!

It was really good.  I like to eat a little bit of the dough while cooking and this stuff tasted great!  I didn't add the nuts and only about half of the cinnamon and it turned out amazingly.  Friends were over and we just couldn't  keep the snack plate full!

The cookie recipe is in the taste of the maker and eater, I love this recipe (I don't add the cinnamon or nuts and maybe cut back on the salt), but baked on a silpat or parchment they are excellent to me! This is my go to recipe, over and over again! (And they freeze very well! ) Thanks for the recipe!

I used m&m's instead if nuts but left everything else exactly the same. This ended up making about 48 cookies and even though I left the last batch in for 13 minutes some if them didn't cook all the way. Next time I'm adding less vanilla and will probably leave out cinnamon.

I thought these were alright. I didn't really think they were cakey like some mentioned. They definitely have a more homemade appearance. I did cut the cinnamon and salt, based on some of the reviews, by half. I can't see the point in wasting a sheet of parchment to mix the dry ingredients so I just used it to bake on. I made half the recipe and it made 31 cookies. I guess, my biggest issue with the recipe was that they were just a little too sugary for my personal taste.

Beautiful cookies! Stayed thick and didn't fall when cooling like my cookies normally do. Followed the advice in the reviews in regards to cutting back on the salt if using salted butter and wish that I hadn't.

I made this as directed except for the salt because I used salted butter. I only used a pinch of salt. They were pretty good but only stayed soft for a few minutes. I didn't like the cinnamon in this even though I really like cinnamon usually.

I made them twice my husband really like them.   I used white chocolate in them and didn't add the nuts.  instead I put a 1/4 of a whole walnut on top.  and when they came out of the oven I drizzle melted chocolate on top.  I Gave most of them away everyone seem to really like them.

I tried this recipe and I love it. Although I tweaked it a little but adding a tsp of white vinegar or lemon juice to keep the cookies soft. I added the cinnamon to it and it gave the cookies a lil uumph. If u are adding salt please use unsalted butter or your cookies will be salty. Enjoy

Made these for my grown son's birthday, instead of cake, & he loved them.  He likes his chocolate chip cookies pure....so I didn't use nuts.  But, I will try that with the next batch.  Easy to make.....not flat cookies.....thicker & soft inside.

I kept it all the same except I reduced the salt by half and kept the brown sugar and granulated sugar the same to make them soft. They stayed soft even a few days after being baked.

I’ve  made them twice now, used all whole wheat flour, they’re quick (don’t roll them into balls) and bake up chewy but solid... they keep disappearing, so I think my family approves.  I can’t taste the cinnamon, but included it anyway.

I seriously loved these cookies and so did my husband. I didn’t have chocolate chips on hand so I substituted them for butterscotch chips, and added a cup of shredded coconut as well. Mine had to bake for 13 minutes before they were done, but they worked out exactly as promised, moist and soft on the inside, with a little chew to the edges. Will be making again very soon!!

Didn't like these at all, but I think it's just a personal preference. The cookie was flat and ugly (possibly because of the butter?).  But they left a bad after taste in my mouth, that I can only guess is from the cinnamon.  And I love cinnamon. It's why I tried the recipe in the first place.

I followed the recipe as is except I substituted chocolate chunks for the chocolate chips. They were good except the amount of salt could have been reduced by half. I would make this again with that adjustment. They turned out just the way I like them to look at 10 min in. I also didn't bother with parchment paper.

This is the second time I have made these & they are great!  1st time with cinnamon, 2nd without.  The second time I added all ingredients to the bowl (except the chocolate chips) and used the mixer to mix everything rather than mixing in steps.  It wasn't intentional (I was distracted by my daughter making her own batch) but they turned out just fine.  I also was about 1/2 Cup short of flour.  My husband said he thought it was my best batch yet! Lol, I've only made 6 or 7 batches. Not always this recipe.  Enjoy!!!!

My daughter and I make these cookies all of the time with a few adjustments...use 1/2 bag  (6 oz.) of semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1/2 bag (6oz.) of white baking chips (I use Nestle Premier White or Ghiradelli White Baking chips) and add 1 box of French Vanilla pudding (dry). I do not add any nuts and I omit the cinnamon.  The compliments never end and I am always told these are the BEST chocolate  chip c ookies ever!

With the cinnamon these tasted nothing like traditional chocolate chip cookies. It was also a bit too cakey for my taste. Sadly, the refrigerated dough I buy at the store was better.  My husband was appreciative that I tried, but kept making faces and asking what was so wrong with them. Not exactly the reaction I'm going for.

Made these tonight. They were an okay chocolate chip cookie, much better than the last cakey type cookie recipe I tried. Still not what I was looking for. Not a sweet enough batter or something. My daughter and my boyfriend ate them, but I am looking for that cookie they rave over :)
