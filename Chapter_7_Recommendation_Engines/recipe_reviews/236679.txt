I’m in love with these burgers.  I had to use an oven so I had to set it for 325 degrees and baked them for 40 minutes to make them done.  I had  a friend over to have some and he said they’re delicious. I would not bake at a higher temperature or they might dry out.

I made these tonight, but not as burgers -- just broiled and served without the sauce (added mint jelly on the side, as I've been eating lamb since I was little).  The seasoning was very good.  It's worth mentioning though that the same temperature for ground lamb is 160 -- not 140.

I made this, and it turned out great! My lamb patties were pre-made but I seasoned them with Italian seasoning (rosemary, thyme, oregano, etc), Gaelic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. I used Roman tomatoes abs fresh spinach. The Mayo I used to make the sauce had olive oil and avocado in it. I mixed that with Dijon mustard and a little miracle whip. I also added steak sauce and ketchup. Cooked to perfection

Longtime member with a recipe or two on here myself. I had fresh thyme and fresh rosemary so I skipped usedry herbs.NOTE: If your ground lamb is good quality mixing in ground beef misses the point of eating lamb.
I followed the recipe but added one tsp of dry sherry plus one tsp of white wine vinegar. Moist,juicy and delicious.
I put these on a brioche bun with garlic butter spread on the bun then I toasted the bun on the charcoal grill above the grilling burgers. Let them set for about five minutes then built the burger with a slice of tomato,feta,dijon-mayo and field greens. WOW

I thought the recipe might have too much of the herbs, but it was so tasty - just perfect.  We don’t eat many fatty foods (seniors tummies), so my husband suggested we do half lamb half turkey next time, which I’ll try.  But if you love lamb this is a great recipe without cooking and paying for a whole leg.

Delicious! I didn’t make the mayo/mustard sauce. Burgers were great on their own.

These are fabulous.  Served without a bun but with a Greek Salad.  Fresh Rosemary, Thyme and Mint amp up the taste.

I made this tonight for dinner. It was a big hit! Flavorful, juicy and the dijon mayo went perfectly. I added raw red onion to the topping and used a Brioche Bun.

Delicious gourmet burger!

This was awesome.... I made 3 burgers out of 1 lb of meat and would adjust the recipe for that change.  Quarter-pound burgers are too tiny for most rolls.  This was a gourmet burger recipe, for sure!

All I have to say is Yum Yum.  For me Lamb is pretty tasty enough that I didn't need the other recipes (with the wines and such).
