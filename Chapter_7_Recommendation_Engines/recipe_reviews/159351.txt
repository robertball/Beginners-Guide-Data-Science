It was too thick,too sugary,and wasn't very creamy. I choose this recipe because I am lactose intolerant,but after tasting this,I think I'll take the chance with regular icing.

I doubled this recipe, used 6.5 cups of powdered sugar, subbed almond milk for the soy & added 1/2 tsp imitation butter flavoring- REALLY GOOD! Used it on cupcakes for my kids birthday & no one knew it was vegan. I'll definitely use it again!

Just bad. I ended up throwing a majority of it away then adding flour and soy milk to it. Really the confectioners sugar is too too much, it only needs about 1/4 of what the recipe calls for.

Easy to mix, but not too tasty! Both of my children would not eat this, even on top of a chocolate cupcake. The consistency was too whipped-I couldn't top my cupcakes, it kept running-I even added more sugar and tried to tweak it, but to no avail. I globbed it on the cupcake, but still did not like it! I will keep looking...

When I changed 12 to 4 servings, it was good and easy to decorate with and on the thicker side of creamy which was helpful when decorating, but it was sugary. Then when I did the full 12 servings like the original recipe called for the frosting was gooey and kept separating no matter how much more sugar I put in it. I thought that was weird. But I loved it the first time i did it.

It came out more like a glaze than a frosting, but it still tasted and looked pretty decent.

It was a great recipe I only regret not having the exact ingredients to try the taste of what it called for.  I did replace a couple of things though.  I put two percent milk and do understand what vegan means of no milk what so ever but it worked.  Next time i will have the type of milk it calls for.

This is a very good recipe...if you are going to do a gingerbread house that is not going to be eaten.  i agree with everyone, there is just to much powdered sugar.  I use this sometimes, but not on cupcakes, defiantly not.

It whipped up beautifully in the proportions listed here, with absolutely no trouble at all. I used it on the "Vegan Chocolate Cake" recipe found on allrecipes and it was a HIT-both times I made it. My vegan co-workers raved and raved about it.
