Not bad.  Something to remember:  Mahi Mahi is a very mild white fish that has almost no flavoring whatsoever (in my opinion, at least), so it's going to turn out flavorless unless there is seasoning that is strong.  I didn't think there was even close to enough lemon pepper seasoning in this recipe to help it along, so I added about a tablespoon of that and increased the lemon juice to closer to 2 lemons worth, and sprinkled Parmesan cheese on the fillets before baking.  I also marinated for about 24 hours, turning occasionally to make sure it was coated.  Something I also tend to forget when I'm making thicker fillets:  fish can cook better at higher temps, so when 350 wasn't cutting it after a half hour, I jacked up the heat to 425 for 20 minutes and it was cooked.  This turned out relatively well, but for a flavor that our household liked, it needed some zing.  If you have a household that isn't so sold on flavor (they salt things to death, use ketchup no matter what it is . . .), the original recipe will work just fine.  It just needed a bit more for us, but all in all a decent starting point.  Thanks for the recipe!

The flavor of this fish was great BUT after almost an hour per directions in foil/325 oven, the fish were still cold. We finished then on the stovetop and the result was delicious.

I like fish a lot including Mahi Mahi, but I expected a lot more from this recipe.  Will not be making this one again.

Could have used more flavor but it was very tender. I would make it again.

It wasn't bad. I've used Olive Garden Italian salad dressing. I had trouble with forming an onion ring and used part of the onion. Not a bad fan of lemons, but it came out okay. I've paired it with French fries.
