A tip: IF YOU DON'T WANT THE BANANAS TO TURN BROWN SOAK THEM IN THE PINEAPPLE JUICE AND ADD A SPLASH OF LEMON JUICE WHILE YOU PREPARE THE DISH.  I promise they will not turn brown.

Very easy. Do not make the mistake I made and try to do when frozen whipped topping is not completely thawed--it gave me awful consistency (very watery) The second time I made it, I let it completely thaw and it was perfect.

This is one of those recipes either you love it or you hate it.  I happened to like it but felt it was a little sweet.  The bananas are a must - just add them right before serving.  But even brown, they still taste good.  I agree with another poster who said 8 oz. of cool whip would be plenty.  I added chopped pecans which I felt was a worthy addition.  This makes a ton!  I doubled the recipe for a pot luck and couldn't fit it in the biggest bowl I own!  The recipe, as written, definitely serves more than indicated.

This is an excellent fruit salad.  I especially love it because it's so versatile.  I've made this several times & each time I did something different.  I'm not always in the mood for the marshmallows, & they can be left out with still wonderful results.  By using the pineapple, pudding, & whipped topping as a start you can pretty much add whatever you want (or have on hand).  Delicious!!

I made this for a luncheon, as well as for my family, and everyone LOVED it!  I added some extra pineapple and mandarin oranges.  Definitely use the juice from the fruits (try adding a little at a time) as it makes it SO creamy.  This is a keeper!

This fruit salad is awesome!  I am usually not particularly fond of fruit salads, but I was very intrigued by all the rave reviews.  So, I tried it and it is irresistible!  My husband also loved it.  In preparation, I used 8 oz. of Cool Whip instead of 12 oz., it just looked and tasted perfect with the 8 oz., so I went with it.  Also, I was gonna wait and put the bananas in right before serving it so they wouldn't turn brown or mushy, but I forgot to add them and it still turned out perfect without them!  I used 1 cup of colored marshmallows and 1 cup of white marshmallows - perfect!  Definitely a 5 star recipe!  You won't be sorry you tried this recipe....

Easy and delicious! I substituted a tropical fruit mix for the fruit cocktail and forgot to add the bananas (was waiting until right before I served it to do so and it slipped my mind). Very good.

My husband really likes this and he typically doesn't like sweets.  I would use less marshmallows and maybe more fruit and not so much cool whip--I used low fat cool whip and sugar free pistachio mix.  It was great!!

This recipe went over very well!  I made it for a potluck because I wanted something easy.  Took me less than 10 minutes to make.  And every one at work absolutely LOVED it!  I had about 5 people ask for the recipe.  The only thing I personally would do differently is maybe use the 8oz size of Cool-Whip to boost the pistachio flavor in the pudding.  Great recipe!

Absolutely love this. I make this any chance I get. Everyone comments on how good it is. Wouldnt change a thing, but sometimes I omit the bananas, it doesnt make much of a difference with or without them, just bananas get kinda mushy.

I didn't have the mandarin oranges--I just left them out. To keep the bananas from browning, I tossed them with a splash of lemon juice (Thanks, Grandma for that tip!) The fruit cocktail I used was "very cherry". We loved this salad, especially my youngest who ate two helpings. YUM.

This recipe is very tasty, and 'almost' fool-proof. :)  Consider: 1) make sure the cool whip is thawed when mixing to avoid watery consistency; 2) Go nuts with the fruit filling.  I personally didn't add the fruit cocktail, but I did add quite a few more bananas than recommended.  3) Consider adding cut up apples to give it a crunch; 4) make a SINGLE batch.... I made double for a pot-luck of 60+ people, and a single batch would have more than sufficed; 5) This recipe does not keep well for more than two days.  Enjoy!

I made this for a baby shower for a friend.  The green color matched the theme of the event!  This turned out quite good and several people commented on it.  The only thing is, I wanted to triple the recipe since we had 21 people attending, but it made way too much!  So when it says 7 servings, these are large servings.

I loved this dessert and best of all it can be made using fat free whipped topping for a healthier version!  The best thing about it was that there was no baking involved...it only took about 10 minutes to throw together!  I would recommend that for a cunchier taste crushed almonds or even additional pistachio taste great!

I really liked the flavor of this salad, I left out the pineapple, I think I'll leave it in next time. Also some nuts would be swell too.

Everyone loved this.  I used pecans and omitted the banana.  So easy and looks so pretty especially at Christmas time.  I didn't use banana, but might try next time. I made it twice during the holidays and I used 12 oz of cool whip.  Was perfect  side dish at Christmas party.

This is a very easy to make fruit salad.  I would recommend more fruit and less marshmellows.

This salad was HUGE!!  Delicious but it does not keep well after a couple of days, the fruit starts breaking down and the banannas will turn so make sure you make this for a big picnic or party if you are using the orginal measurements.

Very tasty.  However, if you are concerned about presentation, be warned that this is not a "pretty" dish.  I should have probably realized that everything would be cool-whip colored (with a hint of pistachio).  Don't worry about your bananas turning brown, you can't see the color of any of the fruits anyway.  I added fresh red grapes, fresh blueberries, pecans, apples, and toasted coconut.  It really was very good though.  I brought it to a Memorial Day Cookout and made an ingredient list to attach to the bowl for anyone who might be afraid to try something in which they couldn't tell what they were eating.

Yummy!  I cut the canned fruit amounts in half and added lots of fresh grapes, apples, blueberries, bananas.  The canned fruit is essential for the flavor but I love fresh fruit for crispness.  I also thought that there was a bit much of the pistachio whipped topping.  Next time I will add some, mix, add some more and probably won't use it all.  The pistachio mixed in was ingenious.

Everyone loves this salad!  I made a few changes.  I leave out the bananas and include a small can of chunk pineapple because they taste so good in it.  I added shelled pistachios, finely chopped, yummy! The best thing is, the recipe makes plenty for a large gathering and everyone wants to take it home so there are no leftovers!

This recipe is wonderful  The added bananas, fruit cocktail and mandarin oranges give it a wonderful change from the typical "Watergate" salad.  I have made it several times for church fellowship dinners and everyone has enjoyed the salad very much

Delicious!! The only thing that I did different was to add strawberries and leave out the fruit cocktail. I soaked the bananas in lemon juice for a few minutes and they stayed nice. Of course the salad didn't last too long, everyone loved it. Thanks for a great recipe!

Best fruit salad ever...but be sure to use the 8 oz. container of cool whip! I left out the bananas and added another small can of pineapple, some pecans and some marachino cherries!  Also, makes a very large dish! Serves more than it states. Made a delicious and pretty salad for Thanksgiving!

I like sweets, but this was way too sweet.  Next time I'd add another can on mandarin oragnes to counteract the sweetness.  I also decided to slice bananas over the top rather than mixing them in, so that if the salad wasn't all eaten at one sitting, the whole salad wouldn't be ruined the next day by bad bananas.  Still yummy overall, just too doggone sweet.

This is a wonderful recipe. We love nuts, so I added pecans and it was absolutely perfect.  Try it...you'll LOVE it!

Quick easy incredible taste.  Goes well after a meal, or just by it's self as a snack or late night treat. That being said the next time I make it and I will.  I think I would like to try some type of nut, maybe crushed walnuts with it.

I have just had my first helping of this type of pudding/fruit salad ever & I really enjoyed it. I hope everyone else likes it.....
Next time I will add less cool whip add more fruit cocktail & pineapple tidbits. As I sat here & read the reviews I added a little coconut & walnuts. 
I did not have canned mandarin oranges so I added little pieces of orange.
Will make again :)

Great recipe that my family gobbles up.  I use fat free whipped cream to make it healthier for my diabetic daughter and pineapple chunks because we love pineapple.  Thanks for the easy and tasty recipe.

Very easy recipe to make and FAST.  Used this for an outdoor family barbeque.  The banana flavor really came out in this salad.  I would make it again.

Wow, this was really really good. I've got to admit, the idea of pistachio pudding with coolwhip and fruits sounded odd at best.  But so many people love this recipe that I was intrigued. I'm so glad I put my pistachio prejudice aside and made this dish, it was A-Maz-ing! I actually didn't add the marshmallows because my kids had eaten them all before I got around to making this dish and I omitted the fruit cocktail because I didn't have any.  I did, however, at the suggestion of another reviewer add chopped pecans. I'll definitely be making this again in the future!

I made this to take to mom’s for Christmas dinner and I LOVE THIS STUFF.  I’ve made more since and find myself having a serving with every meal (breakfast, lunch & dinner)… I’m addicted!  I use the Del Monte Tropical Fruit Salad (instead of fruit cocktail) as well as an additional can of pineapple chunks.  Mmm Mmm Good!!

this is a good recipe to get started on if you've never made this before.  i have eaten several variations, and this is my husband's favorite dessert, so i wanted to make my own.  because i don't like marshmallows and also don't want brown bananas in my fluff, i changed it up a bit and my husband said it's the best he's ever had.

I add a cup of chopped walnuts, 2 cups of shredded coconut, and omit the bananas and fruit cocktail completely and it's amazing!  Let it sit overnight for the best consistency and taste

Love, love, love this recipe!The first thing I did was drain the can of fruit cocktail while I was mixing the pudding & the pineapple. I even went as far as taking a paper towel and dabbing the top of the fruit cocktail just to make sure all the moisture is gone. I did not add the bananas, but next I might. Great recipe!

This recipe is absolutely wonderful!!! I made it for a summer lunch when my parents came to visit and it was very well received!!! We all loved it. Some changes I made was to use fruit cocktail that had extra cherries (cherry fruit mix) and I waited to put the bananas in when we served. I just added a few slices to each bowl and did not put it in the main bowl. It was delicious!!!!!!!!!

Great recipe!  I served it to my Mah Jongg club and they loved it.  One member allergic to bananas so left them out and added an 8 oz can of Pineapple Tidbits and an extra can of Mandarin Oranges.  Sprinkled toasted coconut on top.  Delicious!

Made it for the first time for a family get together.. everyone loved it, and now ask for it every time we have a get together. My husband is also hooked on it, and has me make it for him quite a bit too. I used big chunks of the fruit cocktail and more bananas than it called for and it was amazing :D

We really enjoyed this recipe. It was easy enough that my 9yr old daughter made it. We did add coconut and it was amazing. Also, the recipe did not say but we drained the cans of fruit coctail and left the juice in the crushed pineapple. 2 large bananas was a little much for us but none the less this recipe rocked. Thank you for sharing it.
Many Blessings to you and yours from me and mine.

Very good!  This was a bit hit.  My mother in law also makes this salad minus the mandarin oranges and the bananas.  She even liked this version much better.  The oranges and bananas add a nice touch.  Thanks!

Delicious & easy recipe!  At first, I wasn't too keen on the pistachio pudding taste; but after giving it a try, I was hooked... as were all my family members.  They came away asking me for the recipe. 

What would I do differently the next time around?  I'd add less whipped cream - esp since the marshmallows already gave the salad a creamy/fluffy texture.  I also added crushed almond slices which gave the salad a crunchy texture.  Overall, though, the recipe is delicious as it is and super easy to make.  Highly recommend!

It's very sweet, but oh so good.  Add the juice of a lime for some extra zing that cuts the sweetness a bit. Works really well if you coat the bananas with the lime juice too.

After reading all the reviews, I expected this fruit salad to be the greatest ever. I didn't find that to be the case. I didn't change anything other than omiting the bananna and adding extra oranges. No one liked it much in my home{ I have 4 teenage sons}.
I doubt I will make this again.

This has always been a mandatory item at our Thanksgiving table, so it's nice to see others love it as well.  I've never made it with bananas, but we add a jar of marchino cherries that have been halved.

I love this recipe and would like to add more pistachios next time. I agree that 8oz. of cool whip is anough for recipe.  I also added coconut and more pineapples and banana were sliced on top at serving

This recipe was a HIT at a dinner party we went to.  I used the lesser amount of cool whip as others had recommended and it was just YUMMY.

Great recipe.  I increased the recipe to make 14 servings and it ended up making enough to serve 25 people.  When it says "generous" serving sizes it means "generous" serving sizes.

I tripled this recipe to feed 130 on a buffet line and there was just enough for me, the last in line, to have a delicious spoonful.  The only change I made to the recipe was to add coconut and left out the bananas.  It got rave reviews!

This is great and goes over well whenever I bring it to potlucks. I made a few changes according to some of the other reviews, mostly for appearance sake. Vanilla instead of pistachio pudding, no bananas (get brown and mushy), and the colored miniature marshmallows. You can add extra fruit if you want and you can also get away with the regular 8-ounce tub of Cool Whip. Definitely make the night before serving so the marshmallows can get "fluffy." Oh yeah, it serves a ton of people...it has to be at least 15 servings.

I made this as directed, except that I doubled it, and the cool-whip was overpowering. I couldn't taste anything else! I added a third package of pistachio pudding and then it tasted like I remembered my mother-in-law's tasting. I think 8 ounces of cool-whip for a single recipe would be better than 12.

This is a great summer time fruit salad. I simply LOVE it. I will be making this time and time again. I read some of the reviews before making it, blended the banana with the juice of the pineapple and splashed in some Lemmon juice TA DAAA  no brown turning bananas!!! I am not one that usually one who like canned fruit like fruit cocktail but with this recipe it's simply devine.

Such an easy fruit salad to make and serves a bunch of folks. I used only 8 oz. Cool Whip, added an extra can each of fruit cocktail and mandarin oranges, and omitted the bananas. This recipe is very forgiving, allowing you to use just about any canned fruit you have. Several reviewers complained of it being too sweet. Using canned fruit packed in its own juice instead of in heavy syrup will solve that problem.

I tried this with sugar-free lime gelatin mix instead of pistachio pudding, and used fruity colored marshmallows, and added coconut and chopped pecans.  Great this way too!

Another variation of this recipe is to mix in 1 1/2 cups cottage cheese with the pineapple and pudding.  Gives the salad a healthier aspect and is delicious.

I love fruit salads in general so it comes to no suprise that I like this one too.  sometimes I like to add more texture to them though, by adding things like pretzels, cookies, coconut, or nuts.  It is pretty good, just not the best that I have had.

This was definitely the fruit salad recipe I was searching for--just like Mom used to make!  I took the advice of a previous review and only used 8 oz. whipped topping instead of 12.  I also used the French Vanilla flavored Cool Whip instead.  It was WONDERFUL!  Thank you!

very good, my husband loved this one.  Next time I will not add bananas to mix- they were brown in the salad the next day.  Will probably just chop them and put on top of each serving.

My sister and I made this recipe and loved it.  It was so wonderful.  It makes a lot, but it also will last for awhile, especially if you don't put the bananas in until you actually serve it.  We also added a handful of sliced almonds to it.  My 2 year old son also loved it.  I already can't wait to make it again.

this tasted so yummy but too much whipped topping. I'm going to make it again with less and add pecans. Took it to a party and it was all gone!

I always get great reviews when I make this salad.  I always make it with double mandarin oranges - and no fruit cocktail.  I have made this with vanilla pudding to make it nut free - it was good - but not great.  I always use jell-o brand pudding, jet puff marshmallows, and oranges that come in a can.  I once made it with other brands and oranges from a plastic jar - and it was not good at all.

This was delicious, everyone loved it! I used 8 oz. whipped topping, colored mini-marshmallows, omitted bananas and added fresh strawberries cut to bite sized pieces. The color was fine, looked nice. Made about 8-10 servings.

This recipe is delicious and great for potlucks. But be aware that the serving sizes are extremely liberal. I adjusted this for 24 people through the allrecipe conversion and it made way way too much. I had expected 1/2 cup serving size per person, but it ended up being like 1 1/2 to 2 cups per person. I literally had to throw out 3/4 of what I made (I would have saved it, but the marshmallows melt and the texture changes.) Next time I will only double the recipe for 24 people. It would have been plenty.

Doubled this for a neighborhood party and it was a HUGE hit!  Used 2 x 8oz Lite Cool Whip for doubling recipe , using the recommendation from others.  Would definitely do this again, as it keeps the pistachio flavor 'alive'.  Both kids and adults LOVED this!

I cut the fat and calories but keep the taste by using fat free cool whip, fruit cocktail in light syrup, and cut out the marshmallows all together.  Try it, it's still really good!!

wonderful and easy!  I made this last week for the Christmas holidays and my family loved it.  My mother couldn't say enough about it.  Usually I would make my Pink Salad for the holidays but this year wanted something different.  This is definitely a keeper. I may add a few chopped walnuts next time.

This was just okay.  I tried this recipe because my mother made a variation of this, but without oranges, and instead of cool-whip, it had real whipped cream and marachino cherries.  I did enjoy the bananas in this one, but overall my mom's was better.

I have made this in the past as it was written and it was good. But recently my Bf can't have seeds so I changed it and added banana creme pudding mix instead of pistachio. And deleted the banana's, I also added extra mandarin oranges and some coconut flakes. No complaints very good recipe and can be made to what ever your preference is.

I love this so much I had to sign up so I could write a review!
I made it for Thanksgiving, Christmas and now my son wants it for his birthday.
I omit the bananas and add about 1/2-1 cup coconut, 1/4 cup sliced almonds and add in a few sliced marischino cherries.
Enjoy :)

Wonderful!  I was so surprised!  I was asked to bring "ambrosia" so of couse I came looking at All Recipes.  I normally dislike ambrosia, but this variation looked intriguing.  Everyone raved about it and wanted the recipe!  I even loved it!  The only thing I changed is I ommited bananas because I forgot to buy them, and added about a 1/2 cup sweetened shredded coconut.  Oh, and that picture is not what it lookes like.  It's a light green color.  Very pretty.

My sister in law has made this dish for years for holiday dinners. I've made it a few times myself but I omit the fruit cocktail and the mandarin oranges. I do use the pineapple along with seedless red grapes and some pecans chopped for crunch. Perfect!

I doubled the recipe and used one box of pistachio and one box of vanilla pudding. I also used one 16 oz. tub of the Cool Whip. Lastly, I didn't use bananas and it was a hit.

very very easy and very good.  even my husband liked it and he usually doesn't eat this type of dish.  it makes alot, too.  next time i would add less cool whip though...maybe start with 8 oz. and go from there.  thanks for the recipe.

Took this to a baby shower this weekend and it was a huge hit - even amongst the "healthy eaters!"  Personally, I would have prefered to add coconut for more texture and for flavor and a jar of marinated cherries to give it a punch of color!

Yummy!  I love how fluffy and creamy this salad is.  I ended up using cheesecake pudding because my boyfriend doesn't like pistachio, but I think pretty much any pudding would work (except maybe for chocolate)!  Also, whenever I make fruit salad I use the canned tropical fruit blend that has pineapple, papaya and I believe mango because I like it better and it seems more interesting.  This is my favorite fruit salad recipe, thanks!

This salad is good, but I think it needs something.  I might try adding nuts as some other reviewers have done.  It seems a little too sweet, but I left out the mandarin oranges (I don't like the flavor of canned oranges), so that could be part of the problem.  I'll definitely leave the bananas out next time, and I might use a second can of fruit cocktail since I'm leaving out the oranges as well.  I used multicolored fruit-flavored marshmallows and they added some nice color.  I also cut the cool whip to 8 ounces, which worked well.  I'll probably make this again, but I'm going to have to experiment to come up with the right ingredients to add to complete it.

I made this for Christmas dinner, and everyone raved about it!  I omitted the bananas (not appetizing when darkened) and used 8 oz. Lite Cool Whip, sugar-free fat-free pudding, and maraschino cherries. (A small jar for a double-batch.)  So easy and very good!

Very good, kind of sweet, made it with sweetened whipping cream instead of coolwhip, will not add sugar to cream next time. Substituted pineapple tidbits for crushed pineapples.  Will add an apple next time for an extra crunch as noted by a previous poster.

I really liked this stuff and ended up eating almost all of it because the kids and hubby don't like this type of dessert. I will make for a pot luck or group gathering so I don't eat it all. Next time I will add a little coconut and marischino cherries!

This was very yummy.  I love pistachio, so I especially liked it.  I am however, taking this to my Mother-in-law's for Mother's day, so we'll see how the crowd reacts, but I think it will be a hit.  I used Non-Fat whip cream and also next time will used the fat free, no sugar added pudding to reduce the calories and fat a little.

LOVED this salad!  made for Easter dinner and got great compliments, actually I think most people had seconds.  Very flavorful and easy to make.  I added a couple of cans of fruit cocktail because it just didn't seem like enough without but otherwise I followed to a T. Can't go wrong with this for any potluck or Holiday light salad.

A BIG hit in my family. My six year old says "it tastes better than it looks"; I suggest adding the bananas right before you serve it if you think you might have leftovers. Also, you save 300 calories and lose zero taste if you use the diet pudding. Enjoy!

Very easy and yummy. I eliminated the bananas, because I thought they'd get too mushy. I also used an 8 oz tub of fat free cool whip rather than 10 oz. My husband and I both enjoyed this.

This is a great summertime dessert!  It takes almost no time to throw together.  I leave out the marshmallows to make it vegetarian (can't have the gelatin) and replace them with extra bananas and mandarin oranges.

I just loved it, i tried to get this recipe from my mother in law, but she called it the green goddess and I never found the recipe. I typed in salad and bump into it by accident. My family loves it, I omitted the maderines, not a big  fan of canned maderines. Taste great!

I will double the fruit if I make it again. Maybe add coconut instead of marshmallows too much fluff.. tastes good overall.

This is something my Mom used to make me for thanksgiving, and some other holidays, as I was missing her very much this year, I decided to make it for myself.  The only change I made is not to add the nuts, as I don’t like them. First taste brought me right back to my childhood thanksgivings and most importantly to my Mom. This will now be a regular addition to my holidays.

Easy to prepare.  I doubled recipe, left out bananas and added strawberries and apples soaked in lemon juice.  I followed other reviewers and used less cool whip. Also added chopped pistachio. The boy scouts are going to love this dish!!

This recipe was awesome exactly as written, which is how I made it.  5 star.  But Next time I would replace the canned fruit though with more fresh fruit.  I would keep the crushed canned pineapple mixed with the pudding as the base recipe, and then replace the canned fruit cocktail with probably  grapes cut in half and possibly apple chunks, and more banana.  It was delicious, but a little too “fake” tasting with all the canned fruit.   I added the banana right before serving and mixed some lemon juice on it to prevent browning.

I made this without the fruit cocktail and mandarin oranges. I would have put the mandarin oranges in if I had some. My husband loved it with the bananas! I've also made it in the past with apples too and that's really good.

My family loves this.  An Easter tradition.  I vary the recipe some.  Use only 8 ounce container of Cool Whip and 1 cup of marshmallows.  Like to make it fruity but not real sweet.

Great light dessert to take to dinner party.To make it a little healthier I substituted 12 oz vanilla yogurt ( cool whip is all chemicals) and did not use canned fruit cocktail. Used blueberries, strawberries, red seedless grapes halved & organic flaked coconut, a cup of each. Tasted delicious!

So quick to make and so tasty.  I did drain all the pineapple juice over the sliced bananas with some lemon juice added, letting them soak in it until I finished putting the rest of the ingrediants together.  
After mixing in the bananas, I topped it off with slivered almonds, which gave a pretty presentation and tasty when mixed in.
Will definitely make for group gatherings.

I was the most popular Grammie at the Mother's Day gathering - both with the kids and adults !  I omitted the bananas, reduced the whipped topping by almost 1/2, cut down on the marshmallows and let it all sit overnight.  In the a.m. I added 1 fresh cut up apple, pear, and orange - Topped with walnuts to serve.  What a HIT!  Will definitely make again.  I kept hearing, "I love this stuff" !
This is a very fun recipe to adapt to your own liking.  I think it would be hard to ruin.  I might try another flavor pudding next time.

Ladies, THAW that whipped topping or your product will be watery. Recipe is good but needs to be tweeked as 1 batch seems party size!
Next time,for me, a)not more than a handful or so of mmallows .Mmallows make it way too sweet. b)use 1/2 of cool whip; c)and will drain my fruits better. I am looking for a stiffer product,this one was just too wet,creamy,loose,sweet, and it seemed the mmallow and coolwhip overwhelmed...keeping in mind that THAT could have been b/c I didnt THAW my cool whip first.

Great!  I used 8 oz whipped cream and omitted the marshmallows.  It was plenty sweet and I am not a marshmallow fan!

I love this quick and easy potluck recipe.  I added one peeled, chopped apple for a little crunch and topped it with chopped walnuts.

Delicious! I substituted whipped topping for peach yohurt, I also added some grapes and pistachios and topped this salad with whipped cream and white chocolate flakes. It's amazing. I made it for my New Year party and it was a big hit! I made two layers (salad+whipped cream) and served it in a dessert bowls. It looks fantastic and tastes even better. I'm going to make it again soon.

This fruit salad sounded like it would be amazing due to the rave reviews. When I made it, it was very very sweet, and just not very good. We left out the bananas, but decided to add pecans for crunchy-ness and 1/2 cup sour cream to lessen the sweet.This improved it. The marshmallows didn't really add to the salad, either. If you like sweet things, this is probably more for you. Maybe the bananas we left out are the secret ingredient that makes the dish. Overall a lot of tinkering had to be done and it's still somewhat lacking.

If you do not have a big sweet tooth, you might think this is too sweet. The pistachio flavor is perfect in this recipe, a very nice choice at a summer barbeque or potluck.

I needed something easy for a camping family reuinion. This was definately easy - open the cans - put them in - done! I used while chocolate pudding vs. pistachio to satisfy my sweet husband and it still turned out good. Nothing spectacular but good.

Made as directed, no changes needed! I served this at a birthday cookout and it was a big hit with the young and the old. People went back for seconds on it, so that is a good sign. Best part - so fast and simple to make, plus it is delicious!

This was THE BEST fruit salad after I added a cup of walnuts, chopped cherries, shredded coconut, and a 16-oz tub of thawed whipped cream!

This was very good.  I didn't add the mandarin oranges because I don't like them, but it didn't seem to matter, everyone loved this.

This is a good recipe. It is tasty but not so rave worthy. It is too sweet for most folks. I used the 8oz. whipped topping as suggested and still was very sweet. I even added lots of extra fruit to lighten it up but to no avail. Yummy enough but very heavy.
