So easy a child could make it
.  It was delicious, no changes needed. will try it with blueberries too.  I didn't have an 11 x 7" baking dish so I used my club aluminium frying pan, it worked swell. Thanks for the recipe.

I made it using the exact recipe. I did have to bake it longer than it said to and then the middle was still a little under baked. My husband loved it and said it was a keeper!
