Very tasty twist on standard mexi-night in our house, and a great way to take advantage of the abundance of inexpensive veggies this time of year at our farmer's market! I didn't see any need to put them in the oven though, as the bean/zucc mixture was plenty hot to melt the cheese right inside the tortilla. Didn't have red bells, so just used green, and I also added big handfuls of fresh cilantro to them. (WIN!) After grating the zucc & squash, I pressed as much liquid out of them as I could. I also used a heaping spoonful of the "Taco Seasoning I" recipe on here during the last simmer of the beans/zucc/salsa. With a plop of sour cream, the cilantro, and the additional seasoning, this was a great meal!

These made a great vegetarian meal with summer garden produce.  I grated 1 carrot instead of using summer squash.  I used 1/4 tsp cayenne since I have small children who don't eat spicy foods.  I also used about 6 oz shredded cheese total.  I put the filling in smaller tortillas, rolled them, and poured the rest of the filling over them in a baking dish.  I topped that with about 1/2 cup sour cream mixed with 1/2 cup green salsa and about 3/4 cup shredded cheese.  Then, I baked as per the directions.  They ended up more like an enchilada, but really yummy!

What a great and unique way to use the bulk zucchini from our garden!  These were a hit with everyone in our family.

OMG, this is one of my favorite recipes.  I made a few changes just for personal preference.  I used spicy pasta sauce instead of grn salsa, added some to the bottom of the pan.  I only used about 4 oz. of cheese.

Awesome!  The only thing I changed was subbing in whole grain tortillas.  My g/f HATES veggies and she cleaned her plate.

Great recipe. Shredding made a big difference to those that did not like zuccinni or squash that much. I only had taco shells so I crumbled them and added filling, taco crumbles and cheese in layers. Then baked. I also substituted Vegan Cheese to lower the cholesterol. It was a big hit.

I'm trying to cook vegetarian a few times a week, so I was happy to find this recipe. Made these last night (added a couple  fresh chopped jalepenos to the vegetables and used Trader Joes whole wheat flour tortillas). My family gobbled them up and my husband said "Definitely make these again!!" Thanks for sharing the recipe!!

Have to admit - I was a little bit hesistant to try this - but am SOOOO glad we did!! We had too much squash coming out of our garden, which is how I stumbled across this recipe.  It really was fantastic and my husband didn't even realize he was only eating veggies!!  Definitely a keeper for my house!

This was yummy! I didn't bother baking these, just microwaved the tortillas. I found it under spiced. I ended up using twice the garlic, cumin, and red pepper. Next time I'll serve with lime and sour cream too.

Great dish!  I made this for my husband and he absolutely loved it.  I didn't follow the recipe exactly but must give credit to a new staple in recipe collections.

Quick and so easy! I didn't put in the black beans (not by choice, I have picky eater) but the cumin made up for it. I added crispy tortilla strips with the cheese mix inside the burrito before putting it into the oven. Goes great with Mexican rice and corn. I added some chopped tomatoes, avocado, sour cream and cilantro on the side as well. Needless to say next time I will be making this again soon!

This was sooo good- great flavors!  I used a vegetable peeler to "shred" the zucchini and squash.  I am gluten-free so I used corn tortillas, which didn't hold up so well... so I ended up deconstructing it and eating the zucchini and cheese mixture with a spoon along with pieces of tortilla- still good!

This was wonderful.  I planned on using black beans but the black beans I had were refried so I used red pintos.  I also cut back on the cheese.  I had these the first night and they were tasty, but the leftovers are fabulous.  They really benefited from time in the fridge

These burritos are a very tasty way to use up squash and zucchini! We love this recipe! To save time, I usually skip the step of baking them in the oven. I simply put the filling, cheese and tortillas on the table and assemble them there.

VERY good and tasty!  I used half the cheese (no cheese on top) and added some canned chipotle peppers to the mix inside.  I was actually surprised at how good these were.  They were not mushy, and were very filling.  Saving this to make again and again.  Thank you!

They were very good, my vegetarian sister raved about them (but meat loving husband not so much).  Felt like it was missing something... I think I will pour an extra can of green salsa over the top of the burritos before topping with cheese next time for some extra flavor.  Will make again.

This recipe is so awesome!I did not think anything could top Sweet tater enchiladas, BUT, guess what?!, this one has to rate right up there.  And my meat eating friends, too, agreed it was really tasty.  Mark another great 'zucchini" recipe to add to my box.  Thank you.

Made a few adjustments based on other reviews... I reduced the cheese to about 6 oz total, used 6 cloves garlic, added about 1/2 tbsp Taco Seasoning I from this website and 1 grated carrot. Pressed as much liquid as I could out of grated squash. I used Mrs. Renfro's green salsa, which is nice and spicy. My husband LOVED these burritos/enchiladas and asked me to save the recipe 3x during dinner. Next time, I will probably add a full red bell pepper and some finely chopped spinach.

Thank you HSICO!! I didn't think this recipe sounded good but had zucchini and squash that I needed to use and I had most of the other ingredients so I gave it a try. I was pleasantly surprised, it was absolutely delicious!!  I think that the suggestion by other reviewers to get as much moisture out of the squash/zucchini was important to the texture of the finished dish. Thanks, I wouldn't have thought of that. I did make a few changes. I didn't have salsa on hand so I used a can of fire roasted crushed tomatoes and added a poblano pepper and cilantro. I only used a fraction of the cheese for heath reasons. In my opinion I think this recipe would be even better as written. I will certainly make it again.  I have already shared this recipe with friends and family. I bet the ones with gardens and too much zucchini will thank me.

I'll admit it:  I made this recipe with some hesitation....I don't like squash....I'm kind of so-so with zucchini.....but I was in a pinch and I needed a veggie recipe.....and it was AMAZING!  How amazing?  We fought over who was getting the leftovers and my meat and potatoes Dad had to have thirds!  This recipe is now in weekly rotation!

Really great taste, simple to make, and my family of carnivores were okay with no meat. I really, really loved this. Just delicious! Will make this again and share the recipe. 

Changes: Substituted cooked dried black beans instead of canned. As we live in an area with a lot of Mexican groceries, I picked up homemade salsa verde at the store. The salsa verde I used kicked up the fire level. Excellent.

I loved these burritos, and they were even better re-warmed the next day in the microwave (1-2 min).  One of my carnivores wasn't thrilled with them, but the others gave a thumbs up.  I used 1 tsp cumin (because I always double the cumin in recipes) and added 1/2 tsp. Mexican spice blend. I also added cilantro in with the veggies before rolling up the burritos.   My salsa was medium hot and with the cayenne and other spices, the heat/spice level was good for a family meal.    Served them with guacamole and sour cream on the side.  A fruit salad and Mexican style rice rounded out the meal.  Great recipe find!  Thank you!

Didn't have any peppers or green salsa, so improvised and used as a side dish.  Yummy
