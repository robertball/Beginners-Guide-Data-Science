Amazing! Who needs that store bought junk when you can make this? I only used 1 tbsp honey because I was worried it would be too sweet & didn't use flax or chia because I didn't have any. It was perfect!

Bought a bag of chia seeds from Costco and was looking for ways to use it. I'm eating this with Wheatables at the moment and it's very good. It's definitely got the yogurt tang (Dannon nofat vanilla Greek yogurt), but I think it's because of the brand I chose. Don't worry about the chia seeds - you won't really feel/taste them - they'll swell overnight. I don't know that I love the cinnamon in here, might try without that and none to little honey next time. But it's healthy (I think I can eat the entire thing without worrying) but I will spread it out over days, so that trumps everything. Definitely not the prettiest, it's a fairly ugly (ok, really ugly) dip, but your tummy won't care :).  The hubby didn't care for it - it's not his thing...

Delicious. I used plain Greek yogurt instead of vanilla and didn't add the chia seeds. Still plenty sweet for me.

Good recipe.  I will definitely come back to this one, as it's a grandkid-friendly food.  Did NOT add chia seeds as no one here will eat them.

Super tasty and easy! Like others said, I put less honey in as I wanted to cut down on the calories and sweetness. I’m trying to eat healthy and this was the perfect treat with apples and bananas. Tasted a little weird with oranges but that could be because my orange was kind of sour. I brought this to my friends’ house and they loved it!

I made this just out of pure boredom, it is the BEST dip I’ve ever tasted. I added 1 more tablespoon of peanut butter because it just wasn’t peanut buttery enough for me! I really suggest people make this!

Okay, this is an amazing afternoon snack especially when you are using MyFitnessPal. The only drawback to this recipe is, it is very sweet! When I made the recipe I cut the honey in half and it was still very sweet, next time I make this I am going to use one teaspoon of honey. I paired this up with Granny Smith apples and it was super satisfying! A definite do-over!

I made this exactly as the recipe specified.  Delicious!  I'm trying to eat really healthily and this brings a nice change to just plain fruit.  Will definitely be using this recipe again.
