I've made a very similar dish, using ground venison but I added a T. of olive oil as venison can be very lean.  I also eliminated the green pepper and added mushrooms instead.  Finally, if there's too much juice, simply add a bit of tapioca.  Also, I've made in a slow cooker and have had wonderful results.

I made this for DH and DS using 1 1/2 pounds of venison rather than antelope.  I followed the recipe as written and there was an awful lot of liquid/broth.  Knowing that they wanted a thicker goulash, I added additional pasta.  I know after cooling the dish and refrigerating the leftovers, it will have the consistency they were looking for.  I did use small shell pasta rather than elbow and poblano peppers instead of green to kick it up a notch.

Even with the salt pepper and garlic powder, I found this dish bland and lacking. The taste did not remind me of goulash.
