My boyfriend had his first taste of carpaccio in Rome (where we met) and has since been unable to stop himself from ordering it anytime he sees it on a menu (back here in the States). We usually eat out in New York but as we are summering in Maine there isn't anywhere around that serves it so I wanted to make it for him. However I was unable to find any butcher shop anywhere nearby that could cut the meat that thin. I ended up buying half a pound of filet mignon cut into 1/3" slices, and then I rolled it out on a cutting board with a rolling pin until it was thin enough to work for the recipe. He was pretty happy with the result! I also topped it with a tiny salad of baby arugula, with a touch of parmesan and balsamic vinegar.

Delish.  I made half a recipe of the sauce and still have more than half left so don't be afraid to scale it down. I added some shaved parm and basil.

i must admit i relied on my old standard vinegrette conncoction but THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU for introducing me to beef carpaccio!  i sliced the meat a little thicker and more rustic than called for and seared it (since i was serving to a group that includes a few ninnies) but i have to say that everyone LOVED it...even the ninnies!  LOL!  sooo much better than "cannibal sandwiches" (ground round on rye with onion and s&p) that it's not even funny!

Absolutely loved this recipe! It's become a regular in my house. Usually, I change something, make a recipe my own, but this one was perfect the way it is.  I serve it with French bread, and top it with arugula and shaved parmesan cheese to round out a meal. The sauce makes a wonderful dressing. My daughter said it reminded her of the dishes she had while in Europe.

This was good but did not make very much. I would double it for 4 people next time. The sauce was very very yummy though!
