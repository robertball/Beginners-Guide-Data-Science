I didn't really like this ice cream. To me, it was very sour and full of ice crystals. To fix this problem, I invented Granny's Ice Cream II. I used only 3 egg white instead of 4 and I used 1 cup of vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream. Thus, I omitted the vanilla. It tasted much better and tasted more like real ice cream.

Thank you so much for this recipe....I am on a sugar free diet and have not been able to enjoy ice cream in years....I used 1/4 cup of Splenda instead of sugar with one teaspoon of vanilla....This recipe is great...God bless you...:)

This recipe was amazing. I added mint extract, green food coloring and chocolate chips to make a chocolate mint ice cream and everyone loved it. I am now in the middle of making a cappucinno ice cream with instant coffee and cocoa.

I liked this a lot!  I have to admit I was skeptical--I mean, sour cream in ice cream?  No need for an ice cream maker?  But it was very easy and yummy, just as Daphna said.  The only change I would make is that I would add a little less sugar.  My personal preference is for a less sweet ice cream, but otherwise, it was great!  Thanks.  (Hubby loved it, by the way...)

You'd never guess this was made w/o an ice cream freezer. The flavor and texture are wonderful. I added candy pieces to it and also 2 Tbsp. of cocoa for chocolate ice cream. I also made it low-fat by adding fat-free sour cream and used powdereded egg whites instead of raw ones. Unbelievably creamy for low-fat! Just don't do like I did and make the mistake of not stirring it enough.

This was surprisingly good! I used half sour cream & half vanilla yogurt & added mini-chocolate chips. I made sure to stir it every 30 minutes & it came out pretty creamy. I'm going to make up another batch this weekend & make the rum raisin this time.

I made this using 3/4 c "whippin' whites" rather than regular egg whites, 1/3 c splenda for the sugar, Light Sour Cream and I added 2 tsp espresso powder. It was wonderful! My husband, who's favorite ice cream is coffee, thought it was comparable to the full fat, full sugar ones I've bought. I plan on using this recipe with peaches next. And, after that, with cocoa powder and natural peanut butter. Mmmm!

Wow, this turned out better than I thought it would! I used free range egg whites, fat free sour cream and Splenda. For mocha ice cream, I used the two teaspoons instant coffee and two tablespoons of my own homemade sugar free chocolate syrup. I had a small helping as did my kids but my husband finished off the rest. Super easy, super good. I can't wait to try more flavors.

THE BEST ICE CREAM EVER!!!! Wow-this recipes was awesome-so little ingredients!  I used vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream-worked fine.  The only thing is that i couldn't get my eggs to peak after i put the sugar in-but the ice cream still turned out fine.  I loved the fact that an ice cream machine was not needed!

FANTASTIC & very easy.  We made the coffee flavor.  Can't wait to try others, but will get some Splenda that others have suggested.  My husband thought it was very creamy & couldn't believe sour cream could be in it.  May try using powdered egg whites instead of having egg yolks left over.

Great recipe and so simple to make. It came out a little sweet though the first time so we reduced the amount of sugar and it was perrrfect. We even got creative and made different variations like the strawberry version (by adding about 6 pureed strawberries to the final mixture, yum!)
One thing that you shouldn't ignore is mixing the ice cream every 30 minutes which gives it a creamier texture. Thanks for sharing!

Recently we used this recipe to make Rose water ice cream by substituting vanilla essence and half of the sour cream with 1/4 pint of heavy cream (whipped) and 2&1/2 tsp of 100% Pure Rose Water. It came out great.

This was really easy to make. I thought it tasted a lot like powdered sugar frosting (Mmmmm)! It didn't really thicken up so it was sort of soft but that's the way I like my ice cream. Next time I'm going to try it with Oreos.

Awesome! Love it!!! It takes alot of work. I sub mostly yogurt for the sour cream. Try to whip it more than every half hour. My favourite so far is shaved rich dark chocolate and cherry chunks. Mmmmmmm. Finally a guilt-free ice cream! Thank you!!

I am amazed as to how yummy this turns out.  It's somewhat healthier version of ice cream bought in the store.  I feel much better about serving this to my kids.  Our favorite is strawberry-fresh strawberries make this oh so good!  Make sure to stir it frequently or you'll get ice milk instead of ice cream!  Thanks so much for sharing.

Maybe it's just our family, but we didn't care much for the flavor of it.  I was rather disappointed, especially after reading the other two reviews.

This was amazing! I made a triple batch using 9 eggs total (because that's what I had on hand), and 3 times 2/3 cup sour cream and it turned out great! One batch was vanilla flavored, the other was chocolate (added 2tbs cocoa), and the third was coffee flavored (added 1tsp instant coffee). It turned out great, with the coffee flavored one being by far the best for my taste :) Will be making often!

I made this ice cream last week with my husband.  It was very easy to make, but it took way more than 2 hours to freeze it.  (Could be my freezer, though.)  I put it in the freezer and stirred every 30 minutes for 4 hours and it still wasn't done.  So, we went to bed (so I didn't stir it anymore) and when we woke up it was frozen.

It was a tad crystallized because of not stirring, but it tasted pretty good.  We just did vanilla.

Super tasty! With a tangy-ness to it like those fancy froyo places that are popping up everywhere. I threw in unsweetened baking cocoa and semi-sweet chocolate chips. Made it in a metal mixing bowl and stirred about once every 20min or so. It was gone in 2 days!

I admit that I modified this slightly, but have to review it anyway - it's just that good! I had lots of egg whites left over from making custard style ice cream - did an ingredient search - and found this recipe. I had vanilla yogurt on hand, so I used that in place of the sour cream, and reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup. I added a couple of teaspoons of instant coffee powder, and about 2 T. of shaved chocolate. It is delicious, and has so much less fat than ice cream. I will absolutely be making this often, thanks so much for sharing your family recipe!

Try using half the sugar and dulce de leche to taste.  Then mix in slightly salted toasted pecans at the end, just before freezing.  Very smooth and delicious!  Next time I want to try maple syrup in place of the sugar, and add walnuts.

Freaking unbelievable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I added crushed Oreo cookies to mine so that we could have Cookies N' Cream ice cream.  I can't wait to make this 1000 different ways!  I didn't have any "ice crystals" but, I also followed the directions and stirred it every 30 minutes.  What a FANTASTIC recipe!!

It tastes like the ice cream that is leftover in a root beer float...when it has that "zing" to it. We can't wait to try variations to the recipe!

With a little tweaking this has a lot of possibilities.  Per our taste, we could taste the sour cream a little too much.  Next time I make I am going to reduce the sour cream, but other than that, my family really enjoyed.  Thanks Daphna

Excellent! Simple and tasty. I didn't even use the vanilla called for in this recipe, just fresh chopped strawberries. My kids loved it too! Very impressed by the simplicity and flavor.

This recipe does oddly make something that appears like an ice cream. It however, tastes a little more like frozen yogurt, but has the texture of frozen yogurt mixed with cool whip. It was just too tart for my taste buds. The only change I made was using non fat plain yogurt instead of the sour cream. I noticed others did that to. I tried the coffee flavor, in the footnotes, and added a spoon of mini chips. The tartness and coffee didn't go together in my opinion. I think I would have preferred chocolate or mint chocolate chip. After 1 1/2 hours of stirring, every 30 minutes, it was still soft. It takes a good 5 hours to completely freeze. One person that tried it said, ooh ice cream and then asked why it was tart and why it didn't melt to a milk on the toungue. Mine did have some ice crystals, but I didn't stir it after the 3rd time. I am not sure why, but I just got a tart frozen cool whip in a cup.

My mother who always refused to eat my ice-cream finally agreed to this! She was so worried about her cholesterol, so now thanks so much for the solution! I mixed in 1 tbs of coffee powder and 1tbs cocoa, thus created a nice mocha feeling. Will try other variety next time!

DELICIOUS! I just made this ice cream and it tasted great! I added cocoa powder to make a chocolate flavour, it didn't need to be stirred every half hour just dont leave it in the freezer too long. No ice crystals. Yum!

i literally went through every recipe on this site to try to find a homemade ice cream recipe that needed no heavy cream, or an ice cream maker, and this is one of the most low-calorie, easy, and versatile. 

1st batch i used splenda, vanilla yogurt, 1/2 c liquid egg whites from the carton. i didnt beat the eggs and splenda until stiff. i stirred it often and still got the ice crystal consistency but it tasted smooth and delicious anyway. i don't recommend using this recipe for vanilla, because it tasted exactly like frozen vanilla yogurt. 2nd batch, i used 1/2 yogurt and 1/2 sour cream and added 1/3 cup pumpkin, 2 T sugar, and pump. pie spice. i tried to beat the eggs until stiff, but it didnt make a diff. last batch, i used only sour cream, and added cinn. i would recommend this  flavor, and i couldn't taste the sour cream. I wouldn't recommend telling people there is sour cream in it, at least not until after they eat it :](learned the hard way). at first, this recipe scared me because i HATE sour cream, but i'm definitely glad i tried it as it was masked by the flavoring in both of my batches. from now on, i will try this recipe with fat-free yogurt and fat-free sour cream, and the flavors peanut butter, key lime pie, and CAKE BATTER (my favorite :]).thank you much for this recipe!!!

also, note to all, if you freeze the container you're going to make the ice cream in (i use tupperware, or old plastic containers) it does firm up faster so i would recommend doing this!

Today was a really hot day here and I wanted some icecream. I didn't have any heavy cream as most ice cream recipes call for. So this was awesome. I was really surprised at how yummy it was. And what a wonderful texture! I give this one a thumbs up! Thank you Granny!

really easy & suprisingly very ice creamy!  i used 6 oz light yogurt ilo sour cream, and added canned peaches.  stirred every 30 mins for about 2 hours & then it was frozen.  as it was freezing it tasted like cool whip and i began to get a little disappointed, but now that it's totally frozen, it really tastes like ice cream!  and pretty healthy too compared to ice cream you buy in a store.  we'll see what my friends at our july 4th cookout think...  thanks, daphna!

I wasn't sure about making this, but my granddaughter wanted to make some ice cream so we did this one. It was great, easy to make. and it tastes great. I make it with fat free sour cream and diet sugar and it still tasted great.

Very good recipe. Easy to make and uses simple ingredients. I made my first batch strawberry and substituted strawberry yogurt for the sour cream and added fresh strawberries. My only complaint was I left the strawberries cut into big chunks, when they froze it was like having ice cubes in my ice cream. Next time I will cut them smaller or puree. This ice cream has a good flavor, but is not as creamy as other ice creams made with cream. I stirred it every 30 min as the recipe suggested and it was a tad bit icy.

It’s magical to make this and suddenly have ice cream!  Fun too, and you can use up any leftover sour cream.  It’s different than regular ice cream but it’s easy, fun, and yummy.

This is a great way to make ice cream that is fun for kids and adults alike. What I did was I added some Hershey's chocolate and Reece's peanut butter cups and I used almond extract as well. It tasted amaz-balls!!

The ice cream tasted good.  The texture was off though. It looked like a million ice cream balls instead of a bowl of ice cream. I added a bit to much mint extract for my mint chocolate chip ice cream but it was still good. It did not say how much vanilla to add which was disappointing. I was out of heavy cream so I tried this recipe. Next time, I am just going to go out and buy heavy cream. I was looking for creamy ice cream but I got off texture ice cream balls. I did not do any substitutions so I don't think I did anything wrong.  Overall, I liked the taste, but the texture wasn't worth it. Next time I may try a different flavor but otherwise, I will not make this again.

I am making this right now and am really impressed. Was skeptical that you could make ice cream without any actual cream or milk. It's not quite done freezing yet, but I've tasted it and it very much reminds me of a fat free vanilla frozen yogurt. I reduced the amount of sour cream (reduced fat), to 1/2 a cup, due to reviews on here that said it tasted "sour". I also added chopped mini Reeses cups left over from Easter. So far my only complaint is it doesn't make enough. Double the recipe if you want a large batch.

Just made a batch with strawberry. I had my doubt about the sour cream, but it worked. It made an awesome ice cream. (I used splenda instead of sugar, but otherwise followed the recipe to a T).

This was absolutely delicious. My family wanted ice cream and I didn't have any of the usual ingredients. I found this recipe, whipped it up and threw it in our ice cream maker and we had yummy, homemade ice cream in less than a half hour. Thank you for posting! I am going to try different flavors and make it again soon. It was a hit with my whole family.

Very good, however, I still need to tamper with the recipe to suit my favorite texture etc. I tried putting half nonfat yogurt and half sour cream, and it didn't taste all that great...but then I tried a little more sour cream and less yogurt and it tasted much better, I also added unsweetened cocoa powder to make a nice chocolate flavor! It is true, however, that it will turn out a little icy if you aren't true to stirring constantly for two hours...I will make this again! yum!

I made this ice cream into Mint Choc Chip.  Added Mint extract in place of the vanilla.  4 Drops of green food colouring (it made it bright green, but when it came out of the freezer the colour had faded more to a very pale natural green), Chocolate crunch sprinkles and finished with chopped chocolate chips.  I followed the first step as written but then used my ice cream maker, then left overnight to firm up.  Nice ice cream will make it again, only negative for me it is very, very soft so melting by the time you scoop it out of the tub.

Love this icecream recipe. I made it to along with the Dutch Apple Pie from this site. Still in the process of freezing. So far it's so yummy I'm tempted to used it as a more whipped cream topping versus Ice cream (personal preference) Hubby wants the icecream though :)

This recipe is excellent for those of us without a fully equipped kitchen.  Even though I had to beat my eggs in a pot because I have neither metal nor glass mixing bowls, we were able to enjoy homemade low-fat cookies n' cream ice cream within a few hours.  Its not exactly like the kind you would find at a parlor, but we like it just the same.
