I think this is only a partial recipe, which may explain some of the comments about the pudding being watery.  My grandmother always made an Indian Pudding for Thanksgiving and used the same ingredients this recipe lists, but before baking the pudding she would add 2 beaten eggs, chopped walnuts and raisins, cinnamon and ginger to the cornmeal mixture.  Bake untile set.

This didn't set well. Part of it set and part was watery. I used 2% milk since the recipe didn't specify, so maybe it would work better with whole milk. It would probably also set better in small custard dishes, not a 9x9 pan like the recipe instructs. Also, the cornmeal didn't thicken the mixture; mostly it just sank to the bottom.

I liked the flavor, but the texture was difficult to master. I would bring the 4 cups of milk to a slow boil, add the cornmeal, molasses and salt; then omit the last two cups of cold milk. (I would pour the hot mixture directly into a baking dish). I ended up adding home-made applesauce to the final mixture to get the consistency I wanted.

This one is awesome original style Indian flour (Cornmeal) pudding which was adapted from British quick pudding. This is close to what I'm looking for, my great grandmothers (Whittier) recipe from the 1800's thet used pearl tapioca and not baked.
