Great recipe!  Wonderful flavor.  I had it topped with cherry tomatoes.  Next time I will add a crisp slice of bacon crumbled also.

I filled it with Barbies Tuna Salad found on this site. I think next time I will just use the tuna with oil. I like simple!

This is my new midnight snack! Sometimes I add a tad bit of mayo to the tuna though :D Also, sometimes I eat this with tortilla chips. But sometimes I just eat it as is. I really want to experiment more with this recipe by adding spices to olive oil and then mixing that in with tuna packed in water. Not a huge fan of the IDEA of packed in vegetable oil although the taste was great.

Anyway, thanks for this new idea!

edit: My new favorite way to eat this is by mixing in a *few* chipotle peppers in adobo sauce with the tuna.

Actually, I first tried this at a Chilean Restaurant as a salad years ago and then just tried replicating at home ever since. I believe they mixed chopped onions and tomatoes into the tuna with olive oil before  filling the avocado, then sprinkling with finely chopped cilantro and a small dollop of mayo. They then placed the filled avocado over a bed of lettuce with slices of firm boiled potatoes with a drop of mayo on each. Funny combination, but I got hooked! They call it "Palta Rellena".

Just had this for lunch in a bowl, and looked up on allrecipes to see if there were recipes for it.  Surprised this is the only one!  So simple and good, and no extra salt needed.  First ate something similar to this at a restaurant in Mexico City for lunch, they served the tuna in the half-shell avocado w/ a spoon.

This is astonishingly good for something so simple.  I can see where this makes an excellent backpacking food.  Also, if you wanted to dress it up, the possibilities are endless.

It was actually a little boring.  No seasonings which kinda hurt the whole thing.  Even a little vingegar, any kind would have helped.  It needs something else.

I added some diced celery, diced onion, and lemon juice to the tuna. It was surprisingly really filling!

I was pretty suspect of this recipe. I thought tuna and avocado would be weird. It wasn't. It was absolutely delicious and so simple. I love tuna and am so happy to have found a recipe that doesn't involve mayo.

So good. I tweaked my raw avocado by going with white tuna in water, tsp of wasabi, a few shakes of black pepper and just a pinch of salt as originally written. Perfect.

For all the fish that got away on our camping trips, found this to be a great "substitute" for the fresh fish.  My new love for avocado's and old love for tuna made for an easy meal when needed after a long hike. We seasoned with salt and pepper and just a small dollop of sour cream, which it didn't really need, but was in the cooler calling us to use him.  Thanks for sharing.

delicious! I LOVE avocados. I guess I never thought of mixing tuna with avocado instead of mayo. I think this would be great topped with some cheese and tomato as well, pimento, etc. :)
