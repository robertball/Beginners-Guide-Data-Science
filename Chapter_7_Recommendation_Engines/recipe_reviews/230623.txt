Thank you soo much for the recipe.This is fantastic! I was making it the way my family and friends always have, leave the cream cheese whole, mix shrimp with cocktail sauce and pour shrimp mixture over cream cheese. This is so better tasting! My family and friends love it this way too!

I have been making this exact dip for over forty years! The only thing I do different is to spread seafood chili sauce in top.  Always a hit.

This was so easy and so tasty. I made it exactly like the recipe except I added a little bit of parsley flakes and some paprika on top for color and presentation, and it was gobbled up very quickly by my family. This is going to be something I will make for any party or family dinner we have. It is great with either chips or crackers. Thanks for posting this!-sangus

This was too plain as it is instructed. Its a good base but just not enough flavor for me. I added horseradish and chili sauce. This really helped to add the zing, but that's only if you're looking for that type of flavor in your shrimp dip.

pretty big hit with the crowd I served it too.  It was preferred by most with potato chips
