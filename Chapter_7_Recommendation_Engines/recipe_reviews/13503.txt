This is good stuff! I wasn't able to find unsweetened apple juice concentrate (even at the health food store!), so I just used the kind with sugar. I was actually glad I did, because it is definitely tart! Thanks for a great recipe!

I tried this with a little different tack:  I used 7 pared and chopped apples (not peeled), and two bags of cranberries.  Then I crocked it for 12 hours.  It turned out very tart--I added about a 1/4 c. of white sugar--and not quite as 'apple saucy'-as I wanted.  I think next time I'll raise the apple-to-cranberry ratio, maybe with same # of apples but only one bag of cranberries.

This left me with 1 1/2 qt of sauce, plenty for a large dinner party.

Loved this recipe!  I like my cranberries not to sweet, still on the tart side, so the apple juice concentrate was enough sweetener (didn't add sugar).  Plus, the juice is a healthier natural sweetener instead of refined sugar.  Definitely a keeper!

This is awesome if you don't mind your cranberry sauce on the tart side.  I doubled the amount of apple concentrate and used this with 12 oz of cranberries.  This was the perfect sweetness for me.  No need for extra sugar.

This is exactly what I've been looking for, since canned cranberry sauces are too sweet. This recipe is for those who like the tartness of cranberries, but you can gradually add sugar to your liking.
