This was a great way to fix rabbit.  I have only had rabbit 'fried' in my lifetime.  Great flavor with the beer and the herbs.  I didn't know rabbit was tough.  The meat was hard to get off the bone.  I am going to fix the sauce and fry chicken next time and braise it like the rabbit.

Excellent recipe.  The rabbit was tender and full of flavor.  We both enjoyed it very much.

This is my favorite dinner recipe of all time!  I've made it so many times I've lost count.  I often get up early on Saturday to get to the farmer's market for a rabbit before they sell out - just so I can make this!  Use wild mushrooms if you can.  I especially like shiitakes with this.  Fresh herbs are NOT optional!  And the beer I use is Shiner Bock.

This was soooo good!  The gravy/sauce was delicious, too.  I will definately make this again.  I followed the recipe but left out the mushrooms and I was out of thyme and basil, so still made it without those spices and it was still fabulous.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used this recipe for my son's first rabbit.  I was so worried the meat would be chewy, but I am happy to report the rabbit meat was incredibly tender and delicious!  I substituted potatoes for mushrooms, used dried herbs, and skipped the last step.  The whole family raved about it!  I highly recommend you give it a try, you won't be disappointed.  :)

I made this with my son's first rabbit, with great anticipation. it was good, but it needed something. I will try it again, but increase the beer and decrease the broth, and experiment with the seasoning.

My boyfriend raises rabbits and we made this last year.  Sometimes we alter recipes, but we did this exactly as given and was wonderful! Savory and tender.

The recipe sounded delish but when served, it was bland and boring.  Won't make this one ever again.

Thank you! I added some carrots and red bell pepper to mine, with cremini mushrooms instead of white. Didn't have any bay leafs and used dry Rosemary instead of fresh. My family loved it and I'll definitely cook this again!

Very good basis for a flavorful rabbit stew. I added a bit more seasoning to the flour (garlic, italian seasoning, cayenne) and also added cut potatoes and carrots to the pot. It was a hit. I'll make it again.

I made this dish and added the sauce to the rabbit mushroom mix. I had it with Nan bread and couldn't go wrong. Only thing I noticed was that the flavors of thyme, rosemary, basil needed more time to simmer into the dish.

This was my first attempt at cooking rabbit, and I really enjoyed it. Once I've perfected my preparation of the rabbit it'll be easier to cook, but that is my short coming. I could have thickened up the broth a little more too. Again, my fault. This was my make or break test for whether or not I cook more rabbit, and I definitely will!

Rabbit was freshly killed, and used wild own-picked (dried) mushrooms. Added some of the mushroom water to the pot as well. The leftover sauce will be turned into a rabbit-flavour mushroom soup tomorrow :) 4/5 because the rabbit was still very tough, I'd braise for longer than 30minutes. Perhaps 45 will suffice?
