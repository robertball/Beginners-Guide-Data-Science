I am leaving a 5 star because although I didn't do buffalo sauce, I did BBQ, it was fantastic! I have never done a bread type recipe in the slow cooker, and was a little nervous, but the bread came out crusty and perfect. I used my favorite BBQ sauce, red onion and spiced it up with my favorite Italian seasoning. This will definitely be in my rotation, often. Thanks for the great, versatile recipe!

Hubs loved this.  I didn't really but we'll go by his opinion bc I'm not a fan of buffalo chicken anything, and I really made it for him.  I made the bread in the bread maker--it's what I do to multi task most of the time, and I added about a 1/2 c more flour to keep it from being too sticky.  This was really easy, until it came time to get it out of the slow cooker--the recipe submitter's slow cooker must run a bit cooler than mine, since I had crust starting to brown and sticking to the slow cooker.  So, I couldn't really flip it out without trying to cut at the crust, which made a mess.  Next time, I'll use a liner, spray more, and that should work better.  However, taste wise, it's lovely (for hubs) if you love buffalo chicken.  You can really taste it, and I used less since I had the "really hot"  Frank's RedHot. Since hubs loved it, and I like how it worked, I'll make it again, next time making one for hubs with the buffalo chicken and one for me with something else.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy - I added leftover broccoli and seasoned the crust with herbs and salt since I dont care for sweet crust.. Easy to put together and was tasty. Would be a good dish for a potluck. Leftovers are in the fridge!

Very Good. I didn't boil the milk, because I was taught to never boil it. I did get it to lukewarm on the stove and the dough turned out really good. The dough is tasty. And it was super easy and quick.

I had so many doubts about the slowcooker being able to cook the crust of this properly... I never had a more perfect crust before ever!  Going to make all my calzones this way from now on.  
And the tomato sauce with the buffalo chicken mix almost gave this a cacciatore flavor.  Sooo good!

I was amazed how good pizza can be in the crock pot! I did make some changes.  I used gluten free flour. I couldn't taste the difference.  I also used BBQ sauce because my kids don't like buffalo.  I brushed the inside of the pot with coconut oil.  It stuck in just one spot, but with a hot crock pot it was still really difficult to get it out.  Maybe I'll try a thick coat of shortening next time.  The one thing we didn't like was that the crust was too big for the pot and folded over the top of the pizza.  That was way too much crust.  I will cut back on the crust next time and make it smaller or cut off the excess.  Very good though!

This is the first time a slow cooker has ever burnt anything I placed in it. After 15 minutes of cooking, a burning smell filled the air so after an hour of cooking I decided to check on it. Needless to say it was a black pile of %#$@. I will try this again but I will make it like a standard pizza.

Zero stars only for the fact that I should have known "not" to do this in a slow cooker! UGH.

I altered this recipe in every way imaginable and it was still tasty. The dough didn't burn or stick and it was perfectly moist. I do think it is more accurate to call it "Slow Cooker Calzone" rather than pizza.

I did have a bunch of flour and fresh mozzarella. Other than that, I had to improvise:

		slow cooker (I used a rice cooker)
             cooking spray (I used butter)
		?1 cup milk (I used cream and water)
		?1 tablespoon honey (the cream was pumpkin pecan flavor so I omitted honey)
		?1 large cooked chicken breast, diced  (I used turkey from thanksgiving)
		?1 onion, diced (had some onion but also used enoki mushrooms and squash)
		?1/2 cup hot pepper sauce (substituted diced fresh jalape√±o)
		?1/2 cup tomato sauce (used ketchup and pureed vegetable soup) 
I topped the dough with cheese, and fresh diced ginger and garlic.
Wow, hard to believe it still worked. Can't wait to keep experimenting with this recipe.

Great idea!! Made a few modifications, including using spices and ranch instead of 1/2 cup hot sauce, added some spinach also! Probably will adjust the spices next time also. Still a little too spicy!

I love this recipe and it's very filling. I especially liked making the dough. I forgot the tomato sauce so I put a little in after. The bread had a few slightly burned spots, but this is my first time making it maybe it was me. Will definitely recommend and make again.
