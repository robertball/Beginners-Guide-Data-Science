I modified this recipe a bit after reading the somewhat negative comments. I also cut the serving quantities to 2 servings.  Even though I used only 1 cup of parsnips I still used the whole egg (to keep it moist and avoid the floury taste/consistency).  I also added about a teaspoon of brown sugar and a couple dashes of allspice. I kept each patty thin and small for more cripy texture.  They turned out great!  Almost like french toast meets parsnips. (sounds weird but quite yummy!) Hope this redeems this recipe for you too!

Yummers!  Why have I never discovered parsnips before?  One really important step not mentioned is that you need to squeeze the water out of the shredded parsnip or else they will be gooey and weird.  This is true of anytime your frying potatoes, hashbrowns, etc but is never mentioned in the recipes.  It's like this big secret.  If you don't know, we won't tell you.  And I added onions and a little pepper.  No need for any sauce they are so good on their own.  I'm making them again tonight.  I wish I made more.

Instead of using a griddle, I heated oil in a skillet, formed patties and fried these on both sides until golden brown.  Drained them on paper towels.  Then devoured them - yummy!

You do have to handle these very carefully, especially when flipping them, since they are rather light and fluffy. I used an ice cream scoop to drop the mixture into the pan and then the back of a spoon to pat them down a bit.

To think I used to use parsnips only as flavoring in soups!

This is a nice side dish, can replace potatoes.  I didn't use the honey.

We have an egg allergy in our house, so I substituted warmed cream cheese for egg (enough to begin to bind the uncooked mixture) , used 1/4 Bisquick instead of flour, and added about 2 Tbs of parmesean.  Fried in 1/2 olive oil, 1/2 butter. Delicious!

Theese were not a hit - dry and pasty, and pretty flavorless. The honey didn't compliment them at all, and I couldn't find any other sauce/dip that did either. Not recommended. Sorry.

yummy snack or for something to eat with salads or something. I only ate them plain but with ketchup and other condiments might be good as well.

I guess I expected these to taste like something more, but they tasted like what they are: parsnips and flour.  I substituted bisquick for flour and added brown sugar and bran, which helped a little.  Also, I used a cranberry honey mustard for a dipping sauce.  All it did was cover the flavor. I tried this as a way to get rid of the parsnips leftover from thanksgiving, I guess I'm not a parsnip fan.
