I changed a few things to better suit our preferred taste.  Use sour cream instead of mayo and cut kale instead of broccoli.  Added seasonal and a good bit of cayenne pepper in seasoning the chicken and pasta mix. Last change is a saut√© an onion and added to the mix.  All other steps and ingredients the same.  Great flexible recipe.

I didn't make any changes. Otherwise I'd post my own recipe. I've never had this before so I can't compare it to others, but I guess I can said I don't like chicken divan. it was pretty boring. At the same time it wasn't horrible.
