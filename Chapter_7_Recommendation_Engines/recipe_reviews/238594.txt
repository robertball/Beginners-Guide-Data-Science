Needed more bacon and the canned water chestnuts added a nasty flavor. I will be omitting those. Pure mayonaise is not my idea of a dressing for a salad.

Much better with a half cup "or more" of sugar (or Splenda) mixed into the mayonnaise before icing the salad with this dressing.

I have been looking for this recipe. I can remember eating this salad as a little kid in the 1970's. I will be replacing the water chestnuts with green onions and the black olives with parmesan cheese to give it some kick. Sure to be yummy!

I make this recipe but I put the tomatoes on top of the salad and cover it with Mayo. Then I add the cheese and bacon.  The mayo seal the tomatoes and helps to flavor them and it adds to the salad. Sometimes I sprinkle a little seasoned salt over the tomatoes before covering, but just a little.  This salad lasts forever in the fridge as leftovers if you don't mix it in the bowl and just cover it.

No peas so used frozen broccoli No olives so used fresh mushrooms Added minced onion and garlic powder and ground pepper to cheese and mayo Next time might do 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo to cut calories and maybe some hidden ranch seasoning
