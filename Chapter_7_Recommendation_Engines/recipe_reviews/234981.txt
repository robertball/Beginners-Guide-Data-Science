This was a very tasty, enjoyable lunch for my hubby and I.  My first time to use tofu in a recipe...it reminded us of cheese in our salad.  I have submitted a picture of this easy, healthy dish. Try it!

Very good.  There are so many variations - limited only by one's imagination.

After trying this recipe for the first time, I made it 2 more times in one week and ate it for lunch every day. That's how much I like it.  It's so simple and the marinade is made of very common ingredients. The only thing I did differently was using garlic infused olive oil which I highly recommend.

I just started clean eating. This was simple to make. I did let it marinate overnight.  Very good!

It's delicious, but would totally add more to it. The recipe as is isn't that special, but the marinated tofu idea is great so adding other ingredients and spices would take this to the next level.

This was a delicious salad. Think I should have mixed the tofu & dressing into the lettuce 5 - 10 minutes prior to serving. Got better as we ate it. Will definitely make again.
