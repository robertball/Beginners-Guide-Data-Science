Yummy!  My husband hates chard but he loved this dish.  I did not have chicken boullion granules so I used Swanson's flavor packets instead.  Definately will make this again.

Would make again, but needs more tomatoes and definitely more sausage.

Easy dish to put together and great for when you've got lots of veggies to use - I used beet greens in addition to the swiss chard, as well as substituted baby leeks for the onions.

This was excellent! We don't like feta so I used a nice dry ch√®vre goat cheese instead, and we had some excellent pork sausage crumbles. Used a generous bit of the balsamic. It was delicious! Will definitely make it again.

I used 8 oz ground hot Italian sausage and mozzarella cheese instead of feta.  It was wonderful.  Will definitely make it again.  We had enough for 3 meals, as it does make alot.  It about filled a 9"x 13" pan.  Great way to use the chard from my garden.

Am I the only one who doesn't know where to put the tomato? I didn't use it but it was surprisingly good nonetheless.  The flavors of beans and sausages and chard blend wonderfully and it is very rich. Would have been a little more generous on the red pepper flakes to add a little kick.

Delicious!  I left out the onion because we don't care for it.  Also I realized too late that I did not have a tomato and all I had was a can of tomatoes with garlic, basil, and oregano seasoning.  I drained the can of tomatoes and used the whole thing and really liked the results.  Everyone liked this meal, including my husband and my picky toddlers.

We thought this was pretty good. I made some/a lot of variations. I used a whole wheat pasta and great northern beans. Instead of the tomatoes and onions I used a can of rotel drained. I added shredded motz to the feta cheese. We liked and and decided next time we would make it into a soup with some chicken broth.

I found this dish quite delightful!  Couldn't find fusilli, so I used whole wheat rotini.  I also added beet greens because I could.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as is.  It was very good.  My Nicky liked it, too.  But I share everything (that I can) with my dog.

Great Recipe, a few changes I made. I used homemade cavelltelli's and used small red beans with navy beans. I doubled the recipe and used fresh mozerrella for the cheese. It was a hit here at home! Thank you
