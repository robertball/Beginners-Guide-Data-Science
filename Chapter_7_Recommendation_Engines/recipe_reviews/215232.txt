This was so easy to make and such a hit in my house that definitely will make it again, but Next time, i have to double the recipe since there wasn't a bean left in the pot!

Yummy!  Made this last night, was very easy to prepare and not time-consuming which I like.  A very healthy recipe even though it is incredibly filling.  Would also be good with shredded chicken.

I chose to puree the soup for a smooth consistency and we loved it. I also added a bit of spice with some chipotles in adobo.

Great recipe! I added everything to fresh beans and it turned out great. I did thicken a bit with flour and water, but all in all, I will use this recipe again.

Love this recipe - crowd favorite! I triple recipe and use canned black beans. I add onions and cilantro to the oil, wine, oregano, sazon. After letting beans cook awhile, I add cayenne pepper and smoked paprika. Then 2 long links of either pork kielbasa or turkey kielbasa (healthier option). Top with Monterey Jack or Cheddar cheese, more smoked paprika and sprig of fresh cilantro. Serve or top with spicy blue corn chips. This is a heartier version but feeds a crowd!

I used dried black beans using the quick soak method.  After draining the beans, I added a couple cups of water and followed the rest of the instructions.  I simmered (to soften the beans) and added a can of diced tomatoes with chilies. I also substituted a red onion instead of using yellow (just because I love red onions.  I loved the bean soup with the tomatoes.  I mixed some of it with rice later on for a side dish...so good!

The absolute best black bean receive anywhere. Better than Grandma's (forgive me Grandma). Very easy to make but has several steps. Don't skip any and take your time. It will turn out incredible every single time. I ONLY use this recipe and it is always a hit. Terrific in a bowl as soup or poured over plain white rice. This recipe even makes minute rice taste awesome when you pour it thick.

I made this for the first time last night and didn't really expect I would be successful, however after my family cleaned the pot out in record time I'd have to say I'm more than thrilled. This was so good, it reminded me of something my grandmother from PR used to make. I love this and I will absolutely be revisiting it regularly!

This soup was quick and easy to make yet very flavorful and delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.  Next time I am doubling the recipe because the servings were moderate for four people.  Everyone wanted seconds!
