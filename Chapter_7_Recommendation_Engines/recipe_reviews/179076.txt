This was okay, but there's definitely something missing.  I used mushroom gravy since I'm vegetarian and ate with sour cream on the side.  More seasonings would make it better.

Super Yummy! Made this with a roast beef dinner and was a huge hit! I used poutine gravy instead of the chicken gravy. Next time I want to replace the cheddar cheese with curds to make a scalloped poutine bake! I also tripled this recipe and baked it for 2 hours, and it came out perfect!

Reminded me of homemade scalloped potatoes.  Very tasty and even the pickiest eaters will enjoy this one.
