So amazing! I had never heard of Sekanjabin before, but I googled it and now I know...But anyway I was afraid to use the white balsamic vinegar, but it is SO GOOD! my 2 year old daughter loves it!  It is perfect prepared as written.  The strawberry taste is great.  The store had Pear infused white balsamic as well as Raspberry infused for the same price and I think that may taste good as well.  Thanks!

Very flavourful. I made it with the same quantities, but my kids found the ginger nad lenmon flavour too strong, so I made the same thing (but a lesser quantity) omitting the lemon and ginger, let it rest overnight with the balsamic vinegar, and added this to the first sekanjabin. The result is a fuller strawberry flavour, with the wonderful after-taste of lemony-ginger. HMM! Thank you for sharing.

This is wonderful.  I was suprised by the vinegar but it prompted me to learn more about Sekanjabin.  Thanks for a great recipe and cultural lesson.

OK, I'm biased because I wrote this one, but I have to admit it's by far my summer favorite -- and my guests, too :)

Great recipe and drink for the summer.  I had grown mint in my aero garden, so I tried this recipe.  Thanks.

I am gonna fiddle with this a bit more. It is a really good recipe. It reminds me of a mint julep. I am in need a of a version. Since a mint julep is basically bourbon well that's not all that easy.  I am going to delete the strawberries and use lime instead of lemons, and use 1/4 cup regular balsamic and the rest white, but as is the color is almost spot on. It tastes so good. This is so refreshing.

I want to know if you can take the white balsamic vinegar out as my kids don't like it because of that..

Refreshing, sweet, and flavourful. I used half the amount of ginger because I don't think my kids would like it too gingery. I tried my first glass with about 1 part syrup to 5 parts water, plus ice that slowly melted. This seems about right for my tastes.
EDIT: I  tried this with 1 part syrup to 6 parts club soda and it is the BOMB. :)

I found myself with a bunch of strawberries, and found this recipe to get rid of them before they went bad.  Loved it!  I used 2oz syrup to 6oz soda water and WOW!  Even better that it keeps indefinitely!  As for the leftover lemonpeels, etc.:  I picked out the bigger lemonpeels and strawberries to toss in superfine sugar.  The rest I froze into ice cubes to use with the drinks.  Excellent!

This is a great recipe!  I use half the sugar and store in fridge.  It's so refreshing on a hot day.

Awesome recipe. Very unique and refreshing summer beverage. Add grated cucumber or jicama for a nice cool crunch. I made a second batch with peach and ginger. Can't wait to try other flavor.

I used regular black balsamic vinegar and it worked just fine. It's a truly great drink for spring and spring is here! 

P.S more ginger is not a bad thing here, use as much as you feel. I like mine a bit sharper.

My Iranian husband loved this (I liked it, too). Made exactly as directed, except used white wine vinegar instead of white balsamic. Next time I'll use more ginger and less mint.

I'd never had this before. It was quite tasty. I thought the white balsamic vinegar taste was somewhat strong and so next time I might use less. But it was nice that it helped it stay shelf-stable for a while so I didn't need to refrigerate this.

Worth trying. I use 1-2 TB in tall glass water. All friends who have tried it wanted the recipe. The sweet and vinegar is reminescent of switchel. Switchel was an old-time drink of molasses/vinegar/water brought out to the field hands while haying. Nicknamed "the haymaker"
