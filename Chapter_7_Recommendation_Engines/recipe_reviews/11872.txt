This recipe was great! I made a few changes, but my boyfriend actually likes it better than the original! I sauteed sliced shallots and chopped garlic in olive oil for about 4 minutes. I added 1/2 cup of white wine and let that simmer and reduce - about another 5 minutes. Then I added the evaporated milk and let simmer for 12-15 minutes. In a blender I pureed the shallot/garlic/milk mixture together with the cream cheese and poured back into pan on the stove. I added nutmeg, salt and pepper to taste, 1/2 cup non-fat milk and started slowly adding the parmesan cheese, stirring frequently. I probably added closer to 3/4 cup of cheese. I didn't need to use any cornstarch as it thickened well on its own. Served with whole wheat fettuccini, grilled chicken and steamed broccoli. Very tasty and light!

Awesome...I don't like all the fat in regular alfredo, and they're too rich for me anyway...this one is perfect.  Just a note - the sauce does thicken as it stands, mine seemed a little thin at first, but I tossed it with some angel hair pasta and let it sit for 5 minutes, and it got nice and thick.

Add a little white wine (about 1/2 cup)to the evaporated milk and some chopped fresh basil and parsley and this sauce is to die for!

Great healthy version that is still very creamy!  I also added nutmeg and white wine per reviewer suggestions.  Mixed in pan-sauteed chicken strips and broccoli - so yummy!

I used laughing cow cream cheese, fat-free evaporated milk and 2% milk and no corn starch making the sauce 127 calories per serving, plus the pasta. needs more flavor, maybe some more spices. great recipe, thanks.

My husband and I loved this recipe, but it was a little sweeter than we expected. We added shrimp, but next time I'll try adding white wine as well. I submitted a photo of our final dish.

This recipe needs a little work.  First, there are WAY too many noodles for how little sauce the recipe makes.  The flavor turns out ok, but it took me a long time to get the sauce the right consistency, rather than really watery.  Once it was the right consistency, there was only about half as much as I needed for the amount of noodles I made...and I made less than the recipe called for!  Next time I will make 2x as much sauce, same amount of noodles, and add more cream cheese and corn starch.  It has a good flavor once everything matches up though...but it made for a long night of cooking..

For me, the recipe took over an hour to cook and prepare.  The time is well worth it because the sauce is so creamy and delicious.  My whole family loved it and we will cook it again.

This was all right.  I loved the idea of using non-fat evaporated milk instead of butter and cream.  I think I'll make a few changes to get just the right flavor, (I think it needs a little salt) but I'll definitely be making this again.

The dish was ok, nothing spectacular.  But considering that it's low fat, it's not bad at all.

Didn't have FF evaporated milk so used regular.  Didn't use 10 cloves garlic (used to our preference). Everything else the same.  Great, awesome flavor.

Not my kids favorite.  Too much garlic for their taste.  I, on the other hand, loved it!  Guess it will be a "Couples" Dish!

This was good, but it was pretty bland for our family, even with all the garlic.  I'll make it again, but I'll definately be adding more seasonings to it!

Decent, but not nearly enough garlic or parmesan.  It does make a rather thin sauce.

I'm not sure if others just like the overly sweet flavor that this has, but I wasn't impressed. It is creamy and it covers the pasta well (I cut back on the amount of pasta like others mentioned), but flavor wasn't what I was expecting.

This recipe is good but not great.  I like the fact that it is lower on fat and calories.  I had to add more cream cheese and other spices.  I think Alfredo sauce is Alfredo sauce - you can try to make it healthier but then it isn't Alfredo sauce.

This was just ok for us. We won't be making it again. Like other have said, the recipe doesn't make much sauce. I made the 8 serving recipe for 3 people & only had a tiny bit left over. Also, the sauce was very thin & seemed more like soup to me.

In the opinion of my family, "it tastes OK but I would not want to eat it again." First of all I tripled the recipe except for the pasta (I used 21 oz of dried cheese tortellini). I wanted plenty of sauce and we're a big family. The sauce didn't thicken as expected, until I added it to the cooked pasta and chicken (I cooked chicken early to add some protein to the dish). The problem with the taste IMHO was TOO MUCH GARLIC!!! Besides changing the pasta I followed the recipe as written and it took a great deal longer to cook than suggested in the directions. Sorry, but I'm still looking for a good low-fat Alfredo sauce:(

This was such an easy recipe!  My boyfriend is lactose intolerant, so I used evaporated goat's milk (you can buy this at grocery store in the same section as regular evaporated milk) and lactose free milk.  It turned out really well!  The flavor of the goat's milk brought an interesting taste to the dish.  If you like goat cheese, I would recommend trying this recipe with the evaporated goat's milk to change things up.  I used two teaspoons of cornstarch since one teaspoon didn't work for me. Thank you for the recipe and I will be making this again!

Delicious, and it was so nice to eat fettuccine alfredo without feeling my arteries clog up!  I used only 5 cloves of garlic but then supplemented with garlic powder afterward when I realized the taste was bland without more garlic.

Great tasting. I even made the noodles myself to go with this sauce and had some lovely chicken alfredo for family dinner. Even my pickiest eater (6 year old) loved it.

I LOVED this recipe! I do agree with everyone else that it needs to be about 20%  more saucier, though. You can add any meat to this, I made shrimp to the side (because my housemate doesn't like it) and it was awesome. I was pleasantly surprised that this tasted so professional and it being so much lighter I think I will make this about once a month. I also liked the fact that my housemate was very impressed with it because he is EXTREMLEY picky! So that is a HUGE compliment!
