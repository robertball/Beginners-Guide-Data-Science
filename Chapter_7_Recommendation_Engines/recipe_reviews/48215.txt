After reading the reviews, I modified this because my husband is a "texture" guy and I didn't think he would like chunks of oranges.  Instead of the mandarin oranges and orange juice, I added orange zest (approx. 1 tsp) and then squeezed 2/3 C juice from the oranges and added that to the sauce.  This added the perfect amount of orange flavor without the extra calories of the orange marmalade alternative.  I also cooked the chicken in olive oil and sesame oil instead of butter for a more asian flavor.  I tossed in some broccoli toward the end and let the sauce thicken.  It tastes better than takeout!  You might want to toss in the cashews right before serving (or if reheating in the microwave, add after nuking) because they lose their crunchiness if they get cooked too long or microwaved.

This is a great recipe! I cut the chicken into little strips. I also used 1 cup of orange juice and let the sauce reduce a little until it was thick and sticky. Served over rice with some chow mein noodles sprinkled over the top, this is a great weeknight meal!

My husband loved this! It was orangey without being too sweet. For homemade chinese food, it was pretty easy, too.

Great sauce!  I used only two  chicken breasts but the full recipe of sauce.  Glad I did because my husband & I couldn't get enough of it.  I added garlic powder, salt and pepper to the flour and more OJ than the recipe called for (added more as the sauce reduced).  Just the right combination of sweet and spicy.  THanks!!!

I dont have any kids, but i did, i think htis would be okay for them.  its really easy and quick, but its not the authentic chinese taste, if that's what youre looking for.  you can try putting orange zest of you dont have any mandarin oranges. its an average american version of orange chicken.

Wonderful!  When I have a craving for the deep-fried version at Chinese take-outs, I make this.  I add a little Chinese Five Spice powder to deepen the flavor.

This recipe was great, I used chicken tenders instead of breasts. If you can't find tenders cut breasts in 1 1/2 in strips.

This dish was really good. First I cut the chicken into 3-inch strips. Then, I added fresh little red peppers (about 5)and some mushrooms for color. I also used alittle bit of the orange's juice as the sauce and let it simmer for alittle bit while stirring. It came our a good consistency; kinda sticky, thick. The pepers give it a good zing.

For someone who said that it didn't taste "authentic". It's because it's not.

This was excellent and very easy!  I used chicken breast tenders and doubled the sauce.  I also left the cashews whole.  My husband and step-daughter said they will request this often!  I think this would be good with pork, or rolled up in lettuce leaves.  Thanks for a great recipe

I was disappointed after all the rave reviews. There wasn't much spice to counteract the sweetness, and the texture of the chicken was too soft from absorbing the oils over medium heat. The cashews didn't seem to go well with the orange flavor, and the oranges themselves got too mushy even after just a minute or two over the heat. If I tried it again I'd cook the sauce over low heat, add more orange juice, and add dried chilis (or use chili oil to saute the chicken) for a little heat.

Good quick recipe, but the mandrian oranges are very fragile so would recommend that they not be stirred in until just before serving.

Great!   This is the forth orange chicken recipe I've made in an attempt to get something that tastes like what you'd get at a Chinese restaurant, and this recipe is an order of magnitude better than the others.  And it's so easy too. :)

Following the suggestions of others to increase the sauce to chicken ratio, I used two chicken breasts (admittedly very large ones) (instead of the four called for in the recipe) and cubed them, and followed sauce recipe exactly.  The amount of sauce turned out well for this quantity of chicken.  Next time I might decrease the hoisin sauce a smidgen and increase the orange juice because I thought the current recipe was slightly sweeter than I'd like.  (But after five bites, I didn't notice this anymore so it really is a minor complaint.)  It's just ideas of how to try to tweak a practically perfect recipe...

We loved this!  I made this the night before I went into labor with our son (don't think it was a coincidence or anything...we'll just always remember that! :) )  My husband loved it and I've made it several times since then.  I think I also added a little soy sauce and some garlic to the recipe.  Delicious!

This is an easy and flexible recipe that is a staple at my house.  I will admit to a few minor changes that you might like to try.  My husband and I enjoy saucy dishes over rice, so I cut the chicken up into bite size pieces, then dusted with flour and pan-fried them in the oil with 1 Tsp fresh garlic.  I followed the rest of the recipe the same, save for increasing the OJ and Hoisin to 1/2 cup to make more sauce to put over the rice.  Chopped peanuts are good when you don't have cashews on hand.  I know this alters the recipe somewhat but the basic flavors are still there.  The chicken pieces comeout very tender and flavorful and the sauce is tasty without being overwhelming.  I think my husband would eat this every day if he had his way and if there are leftovers, they always disappear the next day.  Thanks for the great recipe - the best ones are flexible!

This is the greatest...I didn't have hoisin sauce so I substituted Hot Teriyaki Sauce which gave it a nice sweet/hot zip.  My husband loved it, and even had the leftovers the next night, and said it was even zippier.  This is a real keeper.

The chicken was incredibly moist from simmering in the sauce. I didn't like the cashews in this though. I think it ruined the taste.

Made this for a family of 3. It was thick and rich. Added water to thin out but was still very thick like BBQ sauce can be on meat. 2 didn't like it. and 1 loved it:)Interesting change...using chicken.

I could not believe how quickly this came together. Great for a weeknight dinner. I followed suggestions here and cut the chicken into stir fry pieces. Presented beautifully and the taste was fabulous! When I make it again, I'll probably cut down on the oil/butter for sauteeing by about half.

This is definitely a keeper!  The only thing I did differently was I cut the chicken into strips and sauteed them instead of the whole chicken breast.

I made this recipe almost exactly at stated (minus the cashews because someone had eaten them all when I went to use them grrrr!) I did double the sauce as well as add broccoli. My husband and I thought it was ok. A little on the sweet side. Seemed like it was missing something. However, my 6 and 8 year olds LOVED it. They inhaled their bowls. They wanted it for breakfast the next morning! I wouldn't let them so they had it for lunch and my son finished it off for dinner. Will definitely be making this some more!

This was excellent!  It didn't have quite enough "kick" for me at first though, so I added some ginger/garlic paste and that did it!  I served it over brown rice and it was delicious!

I've tried and rated nearly 200 recipes the last several years on the allrecipes website. Though there are many, many five star recipes, this is one of the best.  The recipe hints of exotic, Asian cuisine--rich and citrisy.  I doubled the hoisin sauce and orange juice to make sure there was plenty of sauce.  I served it with white rice and Amish Slaw, a sweet cole slaw which can also be found on the allrecipes website.  Don't even think twice about preparing this one.

Excellant Recipe.
The sauce for this recipe is sooooo  delicious, it can be used also for Pork.   It would make a great Egg Roll dip also.
Everyone who has tasted this recipe, wants the recipe.
Thank you Tammie for sharing this recipe

Excellent dish - doesn't take long to prepare.  I saved half the green onions and all the cashews and sprinkled them on top of the chicken when presenting.  Delicious!!!

This was so-so. My husband and I both think that the sauce could have used some garlic. The dish seemed to be lacking something. If I make it again I'll add a couple of cloves of minced garlic.

I also doubled the sauce and just cut the chicken into chunks. I added a little salt and pepper to the flour and some fresh minced garlic when I cooked the chicken.I forgot to buy orange juice, so I just used the juice from the mandarins. Thought I might need to thicken it with cornstarch, but it was thick enough without it. I added some fresh snow peas towards the end of cooking the whole mixture, put a lid on for a few minutes to steam the peas to crisp tender. Would also be very good with Broccoli. I added some Red Pepper flakes to give it a little zip. Served it over Jasmine rice..Very good.

My husband and I both loved this. He told me repeatedly throughout the meal how much he was enjoying it. I did cut the chicken into strips and this worked well. I only used 3 chicken cutlets and had enough sauce. If using 4 cutlets, I would make a bit more sauce as it was SO tasty. Thanks for a winner.

Such a fast and tasty recipe!  Cooked according to the recipe and really liked it.  I may add more orange juice as the sauce reduces next time, as the hoisin sauce was the predominant flavor.

This chicken was delicious!  We added orange marmalade in addition to the mandarin oranges (as others suggested) and this enhanced the thick, slightly chunky texture.  The cashews provided a perfect crunch.  We added more of everything to make more sauce - we definitely used it!

My 3 year old requested orange chicken and lemon (thyme) rice also from this site, and I was so pleased how this turned out. Great flavor even with the broccolli and red/green peppers I added.

It was good, it was a very strong orange taste so we decide to use some chicken broth to lighten it and served it over a bed of noddles since we were a little sick of rice this week. All and all it was good my kids loved it. Would make it again but would probably cut back on some of the oj.

This is an excellent recipe, the chicken remains really tender and the flavor of the sauce is great. It's not too orangy or too hot. Throw in some frozen broccoli and water chestnuts when you put in the oranges and serve over rice and it becomes a complete meal.

The recipe was great. We just had it tonight. I had chicken tenders so I chopped them into bite size pieces and omitted the flour, butter, and olive oil. I started by toasting the cashews in the cooking pan with a little bit of butter and then removed them from the pan and completed the rest of the recipe. I also added a dash of red pepper flakes. Delicious.

This was excellent. I did make a few changes to suit us. I stir fried pea pods, the whole bunch of green onions and a small box of mushrooms, then set aside. After shaking the chicken in a bag with flour I stir fried it and set it aside. After the sauce was made I then added everything back to the pan along with a can of drained, sliced water chestnuts and the cashews. Next time I will double the sauce. The great thing about stir frying is, it is so simple to adapt the recipe to your families taste with your favorite vegetables, etc. This is one of my new favorites. It is quick, delicious and great for company. Thank you so much!

My 1 1/2 year old gobbled it up. I used garlic chives instead of green onions and I used some cornstarch in the end to thicken the sauce. Oh , I used tofu instead of chicken too ;-)

OK, this was VERY good.  With a bit of tweaking I think it will be UNBELIEVABLE.  I served it over duck egg noodles--droooooool.  My husband and his co-worker (our lucky guest for dinner) both raved about this meal.  I doubled everything--you have to when feeding two big men--but used only four large chicken breasts.  There was plenty to go around and even leftovers for lunch the next day.  When the breasts were almost cooked through I used a spatula to cut them into large chunks...then continued cooking until they were nicely browned.  Added a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper.  I didn't have any orange juice so I just added the juice the mandarins were canned in.  I also didn't have any cashews so used pecans instead.  I added a can of sliced water chestnuts for some crunch...might use whole next time.  Next time I will definitely use orange juice for the added flavor.  And I think cashews (or almonds) are a must for the texture and flavour.  Toasted of course.  I will add some Chinese 5-Spice and a dash of red pepper flakes when I try this next.  With the addition of broccoli and a red pepper this would be complete.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, it's, without a doubt, going to be a regular at our house.  I'm tempted to make this again tonight but I don't have enough hoisin sauce to make a double batch...I wonder if anyone will notices if I don't share and only make enough for myself?  LOL

Family liked it. Used 1 cup OJ as some reviewers stated.  Made it very orangy. Might lower to 3/4 cup next time.  Let it reduce down to a nice sauce that covered the chicken. Didn't have any cashews or green onions but it still worked out.  Next time I'm definitely adding onions and bell peppers because I felt it was missing something.

This was pretty good. I made for a quick lunch one day and did not have the nuts so I left them out. I added in broccoli to get in a serving of veggies.

This was a fantastic chicken recipe and it turned out beautifully, despite being an easy thing to prepare.  I didn't use the cashews the recipe called for, but it tasted wonderful, all the same.  My kitchen smelled wonderful.

The first time I made this, I didn't really care for it.  (I didn't like the warm oranges.)  Well, I forgot that I had already tried it, and fixed it for dinner again!  The second time I really really liked it!  I have no idea what the difference was, but I will be fixing this again.   I served this with pecan rice from this site and green beans almondine.  Nuts in every dish--kind of fun!

We enjoyed this recipe a lot.  The only thing I did differently was add a little cornstarch to thicken up the sauce.  I also used thin cut chicken, as I usually do.  Next time I make this, I might add a little sugar or honey to the sauce.  But all in all, a good recipe to have on hand and so easy to make!

Thanks for the awesome recipe, I made some minor changes and followed some of the other suggestions. Instead of flour, I coated the chicken in about 3 tbsps of corn starch mixed with 1 tsp salt.  When the chicken was almost done I added a 1/4 yellow pepper and 1/4 red pepper that had been cut into big chunks along with 2 cloves of garlic-crushed and about 1 tsp of grated ginger.  I also increased the hoisin and oj to 1/2 cup each.  I saved the juice from the mandarin oranges and added a little of that at the end because the corn starch does thicken it up quite a bit.  My picky teenages enjoyed it as well.

I sliced the chicken into strips, I used more green onion than the recipe calls for, & also added some garlic. The sauce is fabulous! My husband is a huge chicken lover, & he thought this was a really great dish. Thanks for sharing!

Easy and delicious!  I followed another reviewers advice and used chicken tenders instead of pounding chicken breasts.  I also added garlic and sauteed it with the chicken and added extra cashews.  Absolutely wonderful!!!

I really liked this dish but my boyfriend thought it was too sweet (I rated it 4, he rated it 2). I will play around with it next time and replace the orange juice with soy to reduce the sweetness for him. Apart from that it is a great recipe!

I thought this was a great recipe both easy and delicious.  I made it for my 10yr old daughter's birthday and she told me it was so good she could "eat it everynight." Thanks Tammie!!

Great, easy sauce! I didn't have mandarin oranges so I used a fresh orange. Left out the cashews, and at serving time I added some frozen mixed stir fry veggies. Thank you Tammie Bickar!

One of the easiest and tastiest meals I've made with Chinese restaurant taste!  I used homemade hoisin sauce (with peanut butter).  Added some cornstarch to the hoisin/orange mixture to thicken the sauce since I didn't flour the chicken.

This recipe is perfect! Everyone loved it and was left begging for more. I didn't have hoisin sauce so I used a little orange marinade I had handy and added some chili oil to spice it up. Also, to those people who are complaining that the mandarins become soft, they are supposed to completely break down and form a thick sauce. If you have visible orange pieces you didnt cook it long enough.

It was a big hit with everyone and very easy to make! Good if you are in a hurry to make dinner. If you are cooking for a large crowd, could prepare chicken ahead of time and then make sauce just before needed and add chicken and heat through.
Did increase ingred. to: 1 entire large green onion (abt  3 tbsp chopped), 1 tbsp hoisin sauce, 2 small cans mandarin oranges (16 oz), 1 small pkg cashews (3.5 oz/100 g)- chopped in half, extra juice as needed to increase sauce. 
I also added to sauce abt 3 tbsp each of red & yellow pepper chopped - slightly sauteed, for added colour.
Took advice of some and added the mandarins and nuts last so they didn't get mushy or soft. 
Can see in future adding red pepper flakes to make a bit more spicey and zesty, depending on your guests tastes.

Our mall has a sweet orange chicken. If that is what you are looking for, this is not your recipe. The flavor I ended up with was a gingery, soyish, really orange sauce, which is not my preference, but I can see where it could be for others. My husband liked it.

Oh this was sooo good. As per other reviewers advice, I did double the orange juice.  I cubed the chicken and dipped in egg and then the flour and used all oil. I added 1 clove of chopped garlic and 1 tsp. fresh grated ginger to the sauce mix.  I left out the cashews because of family nut issues and the mandarin oranges did come out mushy but that might have been the brand I bought. Be generous with the green onion.  Served it over basmati rice with those super thin string beans (never remember their name).  As good, if not better than any take-out!!

This was yummy, but not orangy enough for our tastes. I found myself having to add far more cornstarch than called for, and luckily, I had some orange essence oil that I snuck in at the end to get the flavor I wanted. It was good eventually!

Nice for homemade 'takeout'.  Needs more orange juice added to sauce.  I added broccoli and i did spice up my flour before I dredged the chicken.

Great recipe! Didn't have the hoisin sauce, so I added curry powder to taste. Left out butter and didn't bother with the extra calories of the flour either. W/o the hoisin sauce it also lowered the sodium of the dish. A healthy, flavorful, quick-prepare meal that keeps well for lunch the next day. Took under 25 minutes including clean up.

I wish I could give this more stars. My husband, my friend and I LOVED this dish. I cooked it just as directed and added broccoli when I added the chicken back in. I noticed as I stirred the food around that the oranges disintegrated into just orange bits. It was perfect. I used the oranges in water and Splenda intead of in syrup since we are diabetic. Still tasted fabulous!

Made this on Saturday, it was wonderful! I didn't have orange juice on hand, so I had to substitute apple juice.  Came out great! Hubby loved and asked that it be put on regular rotation!  He also requested that oranges be added at the end, which I agree, but that's just our personal preference.

Because I changed the recipe, I only gave it 4 stars. I omitted the oranges, since my family does not like fruit cooked with meat. I added some orange zest, doubled the amount of orange juice, and slightly reduced the sauce before adding back the chicken. We also topped it all off with chow mein noodles instead of green onions or cashews since that was all I had. Delicious. Thanks.

This was pretty quick and easy. My kids liked it ok, but the hoison sauce really took over the flavor. I will be adding some orange zest or something to get a more citrus-y tangy flavor, as that is what we were looking for. I served rice and fresh green beans with this. Very tasty and filling. Thanks!

Pretty good, but not as much flavor as we expected.  Next time I will add garlic and/or more o.j.  I added the oranges, green onions and cashews as I was pulling it off the stove so the oranges kept their texture.

I only gave this 5 stars because I marinated the chicken (cut into 1" chunks) in a mixture of 3 tb. soy sauce, 1 tb. minced garlic, 4 tb. orange juice and 1 tb. lemon juice all in a ziploc bag for hours.  I added 1/2 cup of homemade orange marmalade to the sauce.  I also toasted the cashews like others suggested and didn't add the mandarin oranges until the end.

This was just okay.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The oranges just turned into a big pile of mush and the flavor of the entire dish was just kind of boring.
Pounding out the chicken breast definitely makes for an extremely tender piece of meat, but that is definitely not enough to get me to make this again.

Very good flavor! I added the mandarin oranges in last as suggested by other reviews and they still fell apart and made a funny texture. I think next time I will just leave them out and it will be perfect!

Will definitely make this again.  I served this over rice but found the mandarin oranges got mushy if I left it cook too long when I added the chicken back in.

We really liked this recipe!  Pounding the chicken (I cut it into small pieces first) made it so delicate and tender.  I added the oranges at the last minute, and did not stir, only heated them.

This was OK, my family liked it but it was just ok.NOT THAT GREAT, my children said they liked it but I think they didn't want to hurt my feelings. I tried to tell them it was okay not to like it, I have really nice children, who never want to hurt my feelings but I do believe they lied about this one. I could tell by the look on their faces and the fact that they didn't ask for more, which around here is key when something is liked.

Outstanding taste for such little effort!  My kind of dish.  I took some reviewers' suggestions and added soy sauce and water chestnuts to the dish.  I was sorry I did, because the water chestnuts overpowered the taste of the delicious mandarin oranges.  Please make this recipe exactly as written for the best flavor.  I sure will the next time I make it!  YUM!

Delicious on my first try.  A little bit of work, but not too bad.  I added half of a can of green beans during the last 5-10 min of cooking and they tasted great as well.  I plan to double the sauce next time to put on rice.

This recipe was very easy and delicious! I did chunk the chicken and will add vegetables such as broccoli or snow peas next time. I will also add the green onions and cashews on top as a garnish because the dish looks nicer that way.

This is the first Chinese type dinner I have ever
made that was not in a can.  It turned out perfect
and my husband raved and had the left overs for lunch today. I will fix this for company, it is easy and makes a beautiful presentation,but the best part is how great it tastes. For company I would double the sauce. The recipe was perfect for
two with enough left over for lunch. I served brown rice with this.

This sauce has a STRANGE flavor! I'd totally delete the hoisin sauce or at least diminish the amount by at least 1/2. I'd also add more green onions and fresh minced garlic. Had a strange smell & flavor to it. I'll continue to look for a MUCH better recipe! How did this get so many positive ratings?!!

I decided to try this recipe since it had so many positive reviews. This recipe was awful!!! The sauce needs some MAJOR reworking! Perhaps the brand of Hoisin sauce I used was inferior--there was only one to choose from at the store--SUN LUCK. It overpowered everything else and it came out tasting like a sweet/bitter orange. We scraped the sauce off of the chicken breasts in order to make it palatable. Once of the worst recipes I've tried on this site. It doesn't matter how good of a cook you are---this recipe will make you look inexperienced!

I cut the chicken as other reviewers suggested, rather than pounding.  Added garlic and onion powder to the flour, and did a full cup of orange juice and hoisin sauce.  Also added broccoli.  Very good - and even though I usually can't handle chicken breast (dry), this was very moist!  Use only 3 chicken breasts next time, as 4 makes way too much.

We loved it!  Cheated - bought fried chicken tenders.  Cut them up and added to finished dish.  I'm sure it's better when following the recipe, but this was so much easier and I really like Chinese restaurant dishes that used fried chicken in the recipe .

I followed the recipe as is, except that I forgot to pound the chicken breasts down to 1/4" thickness. I had thawed frozen chicken breasts, rolled them in the flour and added to heated butter and olive oil before I noticed the pounding part of recipe. I went ahead and cooked them for about 30 minutes total in the skillet, turning them every 10 minutes and reducing the heat a fraction each time. Turned out great. I made the sauce as instructed, but didn't add the drained mandarin oranges until finished with the sauce and cooking the rice. I made rice in microwave (it was hot outside!) On each plate, I put a layer of rice, a cooked chicken breast, spooned some of the sauce over the chicken, and then spooned some drained mandarin oranges on top. Recipe is delicious and smells heavenly while cooking.  My son wanted to eat it again the next day!

My wife thought this was great and is already asking when am I going to make it again. I used a little over a pound of chicken breast cut into thin strips. I also added salt, pepper and garlic to the flour as someone else had suggested. Also as suggested I used 1 cup of Orange juice and an entire 9.5oz jar of Hoisin sauce which I let simmer on low heat for about 15 minutes to reduce to a thick sauce. Didn't have canned Mandarin Oranges so I used 3 "Cuties" and cut all of the segments in half. My family loved this dish and can't wait until I make it again.

Loved this! I goofed and forgot to make my rice ahead of time (thought I had leftovers), so the chicken and sauce sat longer than I would have liked. The oranges disintegrated! I'm not the most advanced cook. It was still pretty amazing, and I'll make it regularly!

Family enjoyed this one.  It was easy to make.  I thought it was a bit too sweet for me but my Grandson liked it. It could have had a bit more orange flavor. I used chicken tenders instead of the breasts called for.

A very good recipe, and I did stray from the original recipe.  I first cubed the chicken breast and sautéed it without the flour coating.  I didn't want any breading.  Doubled the sauce so there would be plenty to serve over 'Asian Coconut Rice' from AR.  Once the sauce had thickened, I added a bag of frozen broccoli to make the dish a full meal.  I used Wondra® instead of the cornstarch as the thickener and it worked great.  Realized as I'm writing this review, that I forgot the cashews.  I will add them to the leftovers.  The dish has a light orange flavoring, that I will enhance with some fresh orange zest, the next time.  All-in-all a very good recipe, that I would make again.

Definitely a keeper! The family loved it. A very quick and easy recipe. I did not have mandarin oranges so I used a tangerine I had on hand. I think it definitely needs mandarins as the tangerine was slightly bitter. I also added chopped zucchini and thinly sliced green peppers that needed to be used up.  The sauce was delicious. I tripled the sauce as DH likes to have lots of sauce and I didn't think the specified amount would be enough for us. Doubling would have been fine.

This is a great recipe. I didn't measure the hoisin sauce and orange juice exactly, so it may have been slightly sweeter than I would have liked. I also wanted a little spice, so I added maybe a 1/2 teaspoon of Thai red pepper chili paste. It didn't end up making a huge difference. I added more green onions because I love them, but also to add some color at the end. Finally, I didn't want to buy cashews, so I chopped up raw almonds instead. The dish was great served over Texmati white rice.

This recipe has great potential and an impressive presentation but was much too sweet for my taste. I cubed the chicken then sauteed it and added some broccoli at the end cooking until tender crisp and set them aside. I then made the sauce but left out the mandarin oranges until just before serving and added some garlic and red pepper flakes. After the sauce melded I gave it a taste and realized that it was too sweet. I added several tablespoons of chili garlic sauce to add some heat in hopes that it would tone down the sweetness. It certainly helped and my husband and I both ate it however I don't think that this is a meal that I will make again.

This was quite tasty!  The only changes I made was that I didn't flour the chicken first and I doubled the sauce (and used some of the mandarin orange juice).  I liked the fact that the oranges broke down and blended into the sauce, it seemed to flow better.  Will definitely use again as finding recipes that all 3 kids like is never easy.  :)

This is pretty good.  We have made it twice and will probably do so every once in a while.  I would like to try adding more vegetables (broccoli, carrots, etc) and maybe some garlic next time.  I agree that the oranges, green onions and cashews should be added at the very end or sprinkled on top.

This was a great, easy orange chicken.  Next time I will add the Oranges and Green onions just before serving so they don't get warm.  I added minced garlic to the sauce for a bit more seasoning.

This was really good. Although I forgot to roll the chicken in flour before frying, it was great anyway! I really don't see a need for that step.

This was quite good.  My husband really enjoyed it, no left overs.  I did not have cashews so I used toasted pine nuts.  The cashews probably would have been better but the pine nut worked.

This was decent, but I would have liked a sweeter sauce.  The hoison is too overwhelming, and it overtakes the mandarin flavor.

This recipe needs something, although I don't know what....perhaps a good spice blend.  I was disappointed with the blandness.  Good concept, but won't make again unless I tweak it first.

I did add a clove of garlic to give it more of a kick but I would recommend it because it's just so easy to prepare and to cook.

This recipe was good...but not excellent. I liked all of the flavors together, but like some other reviewers, I didn't really care for the texture. Maybe next time I'll substiture marmalade for the oranges and add some garlic for zing.

This was okay...but if I make this recipe again, I will replace the canned mandarin oranges with orange marmalade as per a previous reviewer.  I did not like eating oranges with chicken... there really wasn't anything wrong with the taste per se, but textures seemed odd to me.  Husband didn't turn thumbs down exactly, but he and I both thought there are better ways to make chicken...

This is such an easy and wonderful recipe.  Took me less than 30 mins and everyone loved it.  I did however make one change and added about 1/3 of a cup of orange marmalade it added some thickness and texture to the sauce.  A++++++.

I thought this was a 4, but my husband rated it about a 2.  So I'm settling in the middle.  I think that he may not have liked the flavor the hoison sauce gave it.  I would say OK overall but not great.

I didn't care for this. Although the sauce wasn't too bad, I didn't like the mandarin oranges in it. It was odd to bite into the crunchy red/green peppers that I added to the dish, and then in the next bite get a mushy, soggy orange. I much prefer the "Crispy Orange Beef" recipe found on this site. Sorry. Thanks anyway.

Wow, my husband loved it.  He said it was the best meal he had all week.  I did a few minor changes per other reviewers suggestions.  I dredged the chicken in cornstarch instead of flour and added snow peas.  Next time I would just use the mandarin oranges as a garnish right before serving.  I added them too soon and they dissapated into the sauce.  Tasted great, you just couldn't see them.   I would also add a little garlic.  This is a super easy and fast recipe making it perfect for a week night. I also served over the pecan rice (recipe found here).  Super delicious.

Very good.  Both my husband and I loved it.  The only change I made was to cut up the breasts after the first saute.  I think this helped get the sauce all over the chicken better.  Yummy!

I was so excited to try this recipe as I've been looking for an asian inspired dish for some time.  Unfortunately, this just didn't do it for DH or me. We ate it, but then tossed the rest. Sorry!

Simple and tasty.  A quick dish to make during the week.  I used 2 breasts but made the sauce for 4 which was great to pour over white rice. Adding more vegetable as others suggested would be great too.  I served it with Chinese style green beans which I picked up from Chinese take out on my way home.

I fixed this dish for my family and they loved it. It is very  flavorful and easy to make. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a sweet-spicy dish. I added salt and pepper to mine and cooked my rice in chicken broth. I cut my chicken breast halves in quarters. Try it and you won't be sorry.

I thought this was amazing!  My husband couldn't get enough!  Even my 20 month old loved it!  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks Tammie!

Really good--did increase the OJ, cashews, and green onions, as well as season the flour before dredging chicken.  Would not want to increase the hoisin, though, unless you are very used to the taste.  Served over jasmine rice.  Leftovers great, too.

This was delicious and tasted as good as chicken at a chinese restaurant. My picky 5 year old son even enjoyed it. I served it over Lipton's Asian Teriyaki noodles which was a perfect side dish for this meal.  Two thumbs up!!

AWFUL recipe! I thought I'd be safe in trying this one since it had such a good rating. It's pretty bad--not at all palatable!

This was a fantastic way to use chicken. I followed quite a few suggestions. I cut chicken up into slices, added garlic while cooking chicken, doubled the amount of orange juice and hoisin sauce and added more cashews and onions. The end result was awesome. Even my husband who doesn't usually like this kind of thing had seconds. This one is a keeper.

This chicken recipe is VERY tasty and easy to make.  I was looking for a recipe for Mandarin Orange Chicken a few days ago and could not find one.  This recipe showed up in my inbox the day before yesterday, oddly strange but true!!!

This was a great recipe!  I like things spicy, so I left out the Mandarin Oranges and added a chopped chipotle pepper.  Grand!!

This recipe was very tasty and simple.  Like others I cut back on the oil/butter for stir frying, sliced the chicken breasts, reduced the OJ to 1/2 cup, increased the Hoisin to 1 small jar, added more green onions and 2 cloves pressed garlic.  Very good, will definitely make again!
