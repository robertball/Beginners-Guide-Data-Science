We liked this a lot but it makes a lot more than you would expect from the number of servings.  It isn't quite like the dressing you get at a Teppan Grill but close - very close.  Thanks!

i had trouble with this recipe bc i didn't have ginger paste and i was using fresh ginger that i grated on my microplane.. i used a little less than 1 tbsp but the dressing was way too gingery.. i tried doubling all the other ingredients and it was still super pungent.. i ended up making bf's lunch for the next couple of days.. a mix of pasta, sausage, carrots, onion, and celery and i used this as dressing/sauce for it.. it worked
