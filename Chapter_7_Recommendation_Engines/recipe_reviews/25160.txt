A very summery flavor!  We use less onion, and use a sweet variety - and the longer it refrigerates, the better it tastes.  I use this trick for cutting the corn: set a bundt or angel food pan on the counter (open side up, as if to pour batter in), then rest one end of the cob in the middle hole.  No slipping around as you cut, and the kernels fall right into the pan!!... and you feel ever so clever.

This salad is a winner -- it's refreshing, attractive, and infinitely adaptable. For example, I use more vinegar because my husband and I prefer tangy dressings. Or you can use Good Seasons Italian dressing packets, prepared the way you like it, instead of the oil, vinegar, and salt called for in the recipe. Canned corn works fine instead of fresh -- you lose a bit of flavor, but it's easier and faster. I use cherry tomatoes sliced in half instead of dicing large tomatoes -- it's easier, looks nicer, and usually tastes better, too. I prefer to use either a chopped red onion or sliced green onions instead of a white onion. Fresh basil is essential. Chopped bell peppers make a healthy, crunchy addition; I use an orange one for the color contrast. Other good additions are sliced olives, small pinto beans, sliced radishes, or diced hot peppers. I even add diced ham or salami and diced provolone sometimes. Make this at least a few hours early, cover, and place in the frig so the veggies have time to absorb all the great flavors.

This salad is very easy and very colorful.  It's good and actually pretty refreshing.  I microwaved the corn still in the husks for 2 minutes per ear (or out of the husk and wrapped in plastic wrap for 2 minutes per ear) then followed the directions from there.  It's been awhile since I made it, but I think I used a white onion (or maybe a yellow one).  It makes a pretty good amount of salad.  If you're looking for quick and easy, this is it.  It'll definitely serve a lot of people.  UPDATE: I made this for a Labor Day bbq, and instead of chopping tomatoes (they all looked terrible at the grocery) I halved a container of grape tomatoes.  They were perfect, delicious and very pretty.  I'll only do this in the future.  I also chopped a large Vidalia onion.  Yummy.  I make this all the time, and everyone always loves it.

This is a  delicious side dish and so so summery! I used a sweet red onion and chopped grape tomatoes. I also used slightly less olive oil and lots of black pepper. Great, healthy, colorful, and yummy!  For a mexican flair, cilantro can be substituted for basil and black beans can be added. Or for an asian pacific side dish with seafood, I ause rice wine vinegar and add diced pineapple.

Looks very pretty, smells good, however it doesn't have any flavor.  If you are used to eating lots of fresh vegis plain than this would be good.  Maybe a hint of lime and some more salt or garlic would be good.  I am not sure.  But I had a few bites, my husband tried it and said the same.  There is ALOT left over.  I am going to add some mexican diced tomatoes and make it into a salsa.  BUT IT LOOKS AWESOME.  However looks don't count alone in this family.

The best way to make this salad sing is to make the vinaigrette separately; whisk vinegar, basil, salt/pepper, then slowly whisk in oil, THEN pour over the salad. The dressing holds together better, and all the vinegar droplets get the benefit of the spices, making sure every bite is well seasoned. It's about the spiced vinegar being suspended in the oil. Just my 2 cents, but it makes a taste difference. I make a similar salad, but use green onions. And lemon in the vinaigrette. Otherwise, it's the same, and VERY tasty, especially if you dress it about 15 minutes before serving to let the flavors do their thing.

This salad is excellent!!  I would recommend it to anyone.  I served it along side wraps for 6 ladies for a beach side lunch.  The salad keeps really well and I liked that it was so light and refreshing without the standard mayo dressing.  I am making this again for a church picnic this weekend.  Because sweet corn is not quite in season here I had to do canned corn.  I have to tell you it worked just fine.  I used three cans of corn and the ratio for dressing was great.  I too used red wine vinegar and will use that again and changed the basil to cilantro.  I also cooked the onion for a short time and thought it was better than raw.  I think next time I will add a little feta cheese when I serve it.  Do not hesitate to serve this it is so colorful and just feels like summer!!

I made this recipie for the first time and took it to a 4th of July party.
Everyone loved it and I gave the recipie to 
quite a few.
I used frozen corn (white and yellow) to save time.
Had a little left to enjoy the  next day and it was just as good if not better!

Excellent salad....Just one thing...No need to add oil...leave it light and refreshing. I used extra fresh basil from the garden, added about 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (crushed red pepper)...I have made this with both yellow and white corn (the combination being my favorite), any type of tomato, just remember to remove the seeds. Red, white onions...or even chopped scallions work...Just remember...The basil is what gives it the flavor. A great presentation is to pile this in the middle of your serving platter and 
place sliced stuffed olives, black olives, mushrooms, hard boiled eggs, capers,chopped radishes, diced celery...well you get the idea, in  sections of each around the salad. People mix in what they want. Enjoy!! Everyone here loves this salad.  Remember NO NEED for the oil.

Lovely. I had to cut the recipe way down as I only had two ears of corn left. I used red wine vinegar as suggested as well as cilantro.

A hit at the summer barbeque.  Everyone enjoyed the robust flavors and I added red onion for sweetness and color.  A lot of cutting and chopping involved but worth all the effort.  A nice diversion from corn on the cob.

This salad was great!  Very fresh & tasty.  I made it in the morning, to make dinner time quicker.  The only time consuming part is cooking & cutting the corn.

This is delicious!  *Choose ripe, plump, healthy-looking sweet corn!*  I usually don't care, but for this, it will cut easier and look nicer. I followed the directions almost perfectly, except to cook the corn, I husked it, put it in a pot, covered it in water with 1 tbsp lemon juice and 1 tbsp sugar, brought it to a boil, let it boil for 2 minutes, then took it off the burner and let it sit in the hot water, partially covered, for 10 minutes.  Drained and cooled before cutting.  Used red onion and soaked it in cold water for 15 minutes to remove the sharp bite.  Used only 2 tbsp olive oil. Used 1 pint halved cherry tomatoes - looked pretty!  Was worried about the vinegar, but I can tell you that it will taste GREAT after it chills! So refreshing!  Edit:  LOVE the bundt pan idea for the corn kernels!  Also, I now use 8 ears corn!

Made this recipe twice so far and the first time I followed the recipe exactly and the salad was delish! The second time I changed a few things because of personal preference. I added minced garlic cause we love garlic, freshly squeezed juice from 1 lemon instead of the vinegar, 1 can of black beans, 1 can of black olives, 1 finely chopped jalapeno for a little heat and fresh chopped cilantro! It gave it a more southwestern flare and we liked it even better. I served it with tortilla chips!  Will definitely add this salad to my favorites! Thanks for the recipe!    *Note: make sure you use a good extra virgin olive oil for the best flavor.

I would suggest swapping red wine vinegar for the white, it brings out the flavors better. Decided to crumble some goat cheese on it too and it really made this recipe sing. And, as always, don't skimp on the fresh basil!

This salad was so good!!!  To save time I found some good canned corn.  You must definitely use FRESH basil.  I think roma tomatoes have a little better flavor so I used them.  Everyone loved this salad.  It's quick and easy and after refrigerated it brings out all the flavors.  I will definitely make this again!

This is my favorite summer salad.  I don't change a thing on the recipe.  Vadalia onion is the only onion to use.  It is even better the 2nd and 3rd day.

Delicious!! Used 4 ears of fresh white corn that I cooked first and then removed the kernels. I also used red onion instead of the white. 2 vine ripe tomatoes seeded and diced, and only 1 tblspn of olive oil with the 2 tblspns of white vinegar. Very nice combo of flavors and the sweetness of the white corn was excellent. Will definately make again!

Very tasty. How could you go wrong with summer corn/tomatoes and fresh basil?! Cooking tip for the corn: wrap ears of corn in damp paper towels and microwave for 6 minutes (continue at 1 minute intervals if not done after 6 minutes). Tastes the same-- maybe better-- than boiling, and it's a lot quicker!

Delicious Salad. I broiled the corn cobs(leaves on) for an hour instead of boiling and then sliced the kernels off.  Yummy salad. Thanks Eileen.

Good recipe!  I used a yellow onion--next time, I might reduce the amount of onion (just our family’s preference) or try a different variety of onion.

Loved this fresh summer salad! I halved it as just the two of us and it still made tons! I did change the ingredients to what I had on hand. I cut the sweet white corn raw off the cob. I subbed one cup grape tomatoes, purple onion and added a small sliced zuccini. I did keep the vinaigrette portions the same and it was perfect. I used four tbsp of white balsamic vinegar as it doesn't have that bite white distilled can have. Thanks for a winning recipe, Eileen!

fresh tasty summer salad ... I followed the recipe exactly. My four kids all really liked it as an alternative to our "boring" green lettuce salad.

This salad was pretty, light and tasty, but I felt that something was just a tad missing? I did make two minor changes in that I only added about half of a Vidalia onion rather than an entire onion, because it was quite large, and I used half white vinegar and half balsamic (for a little extra kick)  Overall it was good, but not outstanding.  I think next time I will try using cilantro and adding some lime to this for a more flavorful 'mexi-corn' version. :-)

This was delicious.  Fresh basil is a must, but everything else can be toyed with.  I used frozen corn, cooked and cooled, and inferior tomatoes that I had on hand.  I mixed balsamic and white vinegar.  Be sure to add salt and pepper to help bring out the taste.  I will make this again and again.

Didn't have any fresh corn (but TONS of tomatoes) so used canned corn.  Very simple and very good!  Will make this again!

I have been making this recipe for almost one year now.  I take it to potlucks all the time and it disappears!!!  I have friends that request I bring this to their events!  One change I made at the advice of other reviewers is to use cilantro instead of basil.  I turns out great.  You can even eat it with tortillas chips as a salsa although I would spice it up a bit with cayenne or something.  Excellent either way!!

scrumptious!  I was worried about making this in case most people wanted a "basic" salad.  But everyone who tasted it was pleased and pleasantly surprised at how yummy it was.  Definitely making it again!

This was okay, not fantastic, though it was a nice change. I think perhaps cilantro would be a better herb to use than basil.

Yum. I used canned corn (bc I'm lazy) and it was still delicious. I also like avocado, so I added that and some chopped red pepper as well. I bet you could add almost any summer veggie to this. Tasted even better the next day!

the only thing I changed was the addition of Rice Wine vinegar instead of white vinegar, 1 chopped fresh jalepeno, and about 1/4 cup of red cooking wine. Also added 1/4 tsp of dried basil, since I had no fresh on hand. Also added a bit of garlic salt and was very heavy-handed with the salt and pepper.

This is a quick and easy recipe that is overall healthy.  But, I too found that the flavor needed SOMETHING.  I will try this again and may experiment with other spices.

I used frozen organic white sweet corn instead of fresh. I also added black beans and cilantro instead of the basil. My family loved it alone, or as a topping for salmon, quesadillas, or with tortilla chips.

I'm sorry, but we did not care for this at all, in fact other than for me tasting the finnished product and not being too impressed with it, nobody wanted it. I was so disappointed because it sounded so good, looked pretty, and since each ingredient alone is wonderful, this combination didn't appeal to us.

I've used this recipe for a couple of years with large groups of teens and adults.  Although corn doesn't seem to be their favorite veggie, I get lots of compliments from those willing to try it. I've served it hot and cold.  Both ways are enjoyed. I stir it frequently when it's being served so the liquids stay on the veggies, reclaiming it from the bottom of the bowl. I use canned veggies: I'm sure it would be even better fresh.

So full of flavor!  I used a red onion for color and grape tomatoes for a little extra sweetness.  I also subbed balsamic vinegar for white vinegar as that is what I had available.  This was such a nice, light, tasty side dish to the hamburgers we had.  This will definitely be a part of the rotation for summer cookouts.

The sweetness of the corn mixed with the tart of the vinegar and slight spice from the onion and basil is awesome. I used a red onion instead for less of an intense onion taste. The colors are so pretty too. I haven't even put it in the fridge to chill and blend yet and I already want to eat it all.

Excellent, easy side dish. I used frozen corn, tomato, green bell pepper, eye balled the vinegar, and sub veg oil. Turned out great. I also added dill and garlic salt to it. Delicious! Went great with my spinach mushroom quesadillas (and Im not even vegetarian!)

YUMMY is all I have to say.  I made this with pulled pork and restaurant style coleslaw from this site.  I followed some advice from the reviews-used cherry tomatoes and halved them.  Used some scallions and garlic salt.  Did not use the olive oil, did not need it.  I used 1tbsp of white vinegar and 1tbsp of balsmic vinegar.  I also used a vidalia onion which I carmelized; and be sure to use FRESH basil-this is the key for a tasty salad.  To finish this wonderful salad off, I topped it off with feta cheese--it was awesome.  thank you Eileen for a cool, refreshing summer side dish...

This is really good. I used sliced grape tomatoes, only half of a small red onion finely diced, dried basil (fresh would have been best)and red wine vinegar because I was out of white. I also only used half of the oil although some of my ears of corn were on the small side so maybe I just had less corn. This really is a great summer salad because the corn and tomatoes are at their best!!!

This was such a refreshing salad. I used both yellow and white corn. I also added a chopped red pepper and used champagne vinegar! I will make this again for sure!

The first time I made this I used canned corn, and I thought it was pretty good. I made it again yesterday but with fresh corn, and it really was super delicious! The only thing I did differently was to use way less oil - I just drizzled a little over the salad. I'll definitely be making this again. Thanks, Eileen!

Made this yesterday for a BBQ.  Took other reviewers advice and added cilantro and black beans for a mexican flair.  Also used grape tomatoes and balsamic vinegar instead of the white.  Was a nice change from potato and mac salads.  Really like the crispness of the corn.  Enjoyed with the habanero lime salmon from this site and a green salad.

Wow, I made this last Summer with what I had on hand, and again this season. We love it. I'm sure the original is amazing but  I have to work with what is available. I made  it with 2 cans well drained whole kernel corn- better quality. I finely diced 2 rib of celery, added 1 TBSP dried minced onion, 2 tsp minced garlic, 1 tsp. dried dill, 1 tsp ground cumin. I used rice wine vinegar and olive oil.

We love this stuff ! !  Great alternative to the usual macaroni or potato salad. It's a side dish that lends itself to all manner of meals, buffets, BBQ's .  THANK YOU.

Easy and brilliant! I used half of the oil in the recipe, and we still loved it. We tend to like things on the tangy side, so I put it the same amount of white vinegar as the recipe called for. It was so fresh and we absolutely loved it! Would be great to use farmer's market produce for

Served twice and raving reviews! Reduced olive oil and upped the vinegar. Made the day before both times. Agreed that flavor wasn't there the night before.. Obviously needs to settle in in the fridge. More salt than I expected.

Thank you for the recipe.  It was a base for a delicious salad.  I added 1/2 chopped green pepper, 1/2 chopped orange pepper, 1 chopped jalapeno, the juice of two limes, 1/4 teaspoon cumin and replaced the oregano with cilantro. I also added I can of black beans.  I marinated it for several hours. It was awesome; even my husband who is a gourmet cook was impressed!

Just tried this tonight.  You should definitely make it ahead of time because it gets better when it sits and marinates for awhile.  I made it about an hour before my party and wasn't so sure about it.  When I served it an hour later, it was so much better and I got so many compliments on it.  Great summer salad!

I love the taste of summer corn. But it's delicate, and I found that adding just the tomatoes to this recipe began to diminish the taste of the corn. When adding the onion (yellow) and dressing parts (basil, vinegar, etc)...I cut them back a LOT to keep the flavor of the corn 'in front'. To no avail (*sigh*).  In the end, it was more like eating dressing over veggie bits that was pretty far from fresh corn flavor.

Delicious! Such a fresh tasting salad. I halved the amount of olive oil and was satisfied. I think it would be too oily if the entire amount is used.

Big success at a summer picnic!  I used frozen corn (run under hot water to thaw), cherry tomatoes, red onion, and also added green and orange bell peppers for added color.  The second time I prepared this, I added about a cup of italian dressing.  Both were equally delicious and gone!  Would highly recommend!

Excellent - especially with fresh New England corn right off the cob.  Made it with fresh cilantro instead of fresh basil to go with "Fantastic Chicken Burgers".  Can't wait until corn is in season again!

I have made this twice now, once with steamed corn out of the bag and once with corn on the cob... personally, I preferred using the steamed corn out of the bag because it was less prep work and the kernels weren't cut too short as easily.  I also used a few of the other tips, cilantro instead of basil, grape tomatoes halved instead of one big tomato, and a small portion of red onion.  This salad is super good with all the changes.  Great for BBQs and parties!

I make this often for parties & it's always a hit. I've only made it with fresh corn.  This is one of those recipes you gotta try. Never a kernel left over! Update: I wondered why some didn't rate this as high. I found the trick to this salad is to make sure your corn is sweet. This winter I made it with corn that was bland. I will taste the raw corn b4 I buy it now. When it's sweet this is great. I've also now tried can & frozen, nothing beats fresh sweet corn. When the corn is right this is one of my favorite side dishes.

Anyone complaining this salad has no taste is buying the ingredients at a grocery store.  The key here is to use fresh, local ingredients.  I bought corn, tomatoes, onions, and basil from my farmer's market to make this salad the same day.  The onion I felt was too strong and recommend 1/8 to 1/4 cup.

This salad was so tasty and refreshing (I made it on a hot Arizona summer day).  I happen to have several basil plants growing in my yard, so the fresh basil gave it a wonderful flavor.  Thanks for posting the recipe!  By the way, I used frozen organic super sweet corn because I was in a hurry and it tasted fantastic.

I made this with bi-color corn on the cob and was less than impressed. Maybe it would be better with sweet corn. I made this for a fish fry and ended up not even serving it.

I made this recently for a barbeque.  I used frozen corn, uncooked, for ease of use, cherry tomatoes, halved, and red wine vinegar instead of white vinegar.  Mixed everything and let sit overnite in fridge, which allowed the flavors to meld.  We really enjoyed it and will definitely make this again.

I like to use about 1/3 cup mix of white vinegar and red wine vinegar when making this.  I use red onion for the color and taste.  For a twist, I add in about one to two cups of steamed edamame for protein.

I tried it as written and it was too much onion for me (depends on how large your onion is).  I also added more vinegar.  Nice salad that we will try again. Next time I will use half of a small sweet onion and twice the basil.

This was delish! I made exactly as the recipe reads!  For the 1 onion, I used 1/2 of a sweet vidalia and 1/2 of a red onion for color and flavor...everyone loved it!  I served this with fish tacos and ended up putting it on the tacos, it was wonderful that way too!

This recipe is simple and just right!  I used frozen corn, and the flavor is still farm-fresh.  I made this as a side to some Mexican lasagna.

Edit:  It's become one of my go-to potluck dishes.  The salad gets rave reviews and I never have to take any home.  It's also safe in the heat since there's no mayonnaise.  I usually make the salad with the corn still frozen and store the chopped basil in a plastic baggie until about an hour before serving.  By that time it's thawed, the basil isn't wilted, and is still nice and cold when people want to eat!  Also, I cut the basil and onion into thin strips instead of dicing.  I just think it looks nicer.

This is a great recipe that is easily modified.  We also add avocado, cucumber and mozarella cheese (we halve the cubes of mozarella you get at the deli counter) as much or little to taste.

Something was not right with this recipe. I read the reviews and was expecting a real WOW...but not sure what was wrong. There was no flavor except for that of the oil, which seemed too much for the corn. In fact, I rinsed the veggies off and tried again twice, before finally using italian dressing, which really no one liked anyway. I ate it, as I felt an obligation after such work, but no one else in the family even touched it. It was a waste of good ingredients, in my opinion.

This was a good salad, but I would use half the amount of onions.  The amount in this recipe carried a very strong flavor, and I love onions but this was a bit too much.

This is great. You can vary the proportion of corn to tomatoes however you like and it still tastes great. I would recommend balsamic vinegar rather than plain.

This is the most beautiful salad!  I used half a purple onion (for color) and green onion (for flavor and color) and made this 6 hours ahead of time.  However, next time I will make the day before because the longer this sits in the fridge the better the flavor.  Will make again!

6.30.18  Corn and tomatoes are in season, so it’s time to take advantage of that!   This salad is so fresh and so very easy, just delicious.  Simple often is best, and that’s the case here.  Very nice salad.

Delicious summer salad. I used two cans of corn instead of fresh. I also used white wine vinegar instead of plain white, and added a bit more. I used a pint of halved grape tomatoes, and also added a diced cucumber. Can't wait to taste after a day in the fridge.

Use a red onion, and by all means, switch to apple cider vinegar for a fruitier taste that goes better with the corn. I add a touch of honey to the dressing as well. Avocado is a nice addition if you're serving ir right away. (Crispy bacon on top, too!)

We enjoyed this summer salad.  I cut the recipe down to only use 4 ears of corn and made it up in the morning so the flavors had all day to meld.  We were not disappointed.  The fresh basil adds a lot to the recipe.  Served this with grilled Hawaiian brat patties, 'Broccoli Cauliflower Pepita Salad' and 'Greek Deviled Eggs' both from AR.

Very easy recipe and tastes better the longer it's in the refrigerator. I use a red onion and canned corn you can use white and yellow or the fiesta canned corn or both! Big crowd pleaser!!

Honestly, I don't post reviews as much as I use them so consider this an exception. A friend gave me some fresh picked corn today & I really wanted to showcase it. Well this is the salad. Had everything on hand and followed the recipe (another exception) using a tad less sweet onion. Wonderful salad. Wish I had made it earlier this Summer. It's a keeper.

This salad is surprisingly delicious despite its simplicity. My guests raved. I used cherry tomatoes, an onion and basil from the garden and fresh corn. I used less oil and rice vinegar. Fantastic. I'll make this again and again, I'm sure.

Using the recommendations of others, we adjusted the recipe slightly. Instead of boiling the corn, we roasted it on the BBQ before grilling our meat. Yellow cherrry tomatoes, red onion green pepper and fresh basil were tossed in 1 1/2 T rice wine vinegar with salt and pepper. Once the corn was grilled, we cut it off the cob and tossed it in salt, 1T melted butter and 2 T grape seed oil before mixing it with the other veg.

My husband loved the salad so much he suggested posting our version. Very refreshing and a lovely medley of flavours.

I wanted to make this for my family reunion, however I didn't have time to pick up ears of corn. So I substituted canned corn. I used half of a red onion (it's what I had on hand) and added some chopped green pepper to add a bit more color.  I also left out the salt (tho I tend to do that with most recipes).  My family raved about it, and several asked for the recipe.

I did not have fresh corn, I used frozen sweet corn. As the recipe is, with substituted corn, it is pretty flat. With fresh corn, it probably would have been better. 

So after I made it according to the recipe, I increased the vinegar to 1/4 cup, and added some diced cucumber. This made the recipe much more flavorful. I would make it again like this.

Easy recipe and was very good - 4.5 stars if I had that option.... it was missing SOMETHING though, so I added a TBSP of balsamic vinegar for a little zest.  Next time I plan to try to use grape tomatoes as some of the other reviews recommended.

Love this salad. We did a low country boil and had several ears of corn left over. The following day we used the leftover corn for this recipe. So yummy! We used a sweet onion and squeezed in a lime for a little more flavor. New summer staple now!

My Mom & I only tasted it before & after it got to marinade since I was only making it as part of dinner that consisted of bbq pulled pork sandwiches and the colslaw that had to be split between 2 families so I had to change the servings to 12 ears of corn.I hope they absolutely love it as much as we did! The only thing I did different was use white corn on the cob and broiled it for 10-15min rotating so some of the kernals were browned or blacked it added awesome summertime flavor and look to the dish..doesn't always cook it all the way so I put them in a deep skillet filled maybe a quarter of the way or less up the corn, covered and cooked/steamed over medium heat for maybe 15 (keep checking the water to make sure it doesn't all evaporate, an 1/8th less oil and vinigar simply because it was the last of the oil but I don't like my salads too oily anyways so it worked out perfect. I also used green onions instead of white because its what I had,I like them better in salads and most other things.Besides that I used fresh tomatoes & basil from our gardens.I will definately be making this over & over again in the future and may get more creative when I have more time and am making it for my family.I love that you can taste the flavor of every ingredient and it is not overpowered by seasoning,just a little sea salt and fresh ground pepper.PERFECT! Everyone had some great ideas for extra add in vegtables!I'd love to serve this with some fresh sliced or chunked hass avacados.Yum:)

3 of 5 in our house really liked it, and it was so simple! It's perfect for cooking with kids. The teen boys would have preferred plain corn. That being said, I couldn't find corn on the cob, so I used canned plus fresh salsa I'd made that day. It had tomato, onion, garlic, lime, and cilantro. I also added green pepper and skipped the basil, as the fresh herbs were poorly stocked at the store. I didn't bother cooking it, just mixed and chilled and ended up with a sweet and tangy dish that lured my veggie hater to go back for seconds. Her vote outweighs the boys this time, and it's a great way to doctor canned corn.

This dish is amazing. The prep was minimal and the result was fantastic. I didn't have white vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar and it was super delicious. I think it is way more than 4 servings however. I doubled it for a party of 8 and I could have definitely served 15 people with it all!

My husband took a bite and said "You know what this is? Summer. I am eating summer."  This is one of my absolute favorite recipes.

This was really good - I didn't boil the corn, I just took it off the cob and used it "raw." I served it at a summer cookout and everyone loved it - the bowl was empty before dinner was served.

This is awesome! It is fresh and light, a nice change from most summer salads. I made a few changes. I used red onions sliced thin for its sweet flavor, cucumbers for color, and added chick peas for a little something extra. I doubled the recipe and 4 hungry men devoured the dish. I had very little left!

Had some leftover corn on the cob and this was a great way to use it up. After reading some of the reviews, I used a sweet white onion and halved the amount, and the salad was good. I think this recipe would be tasty with cilantro, which is what I'll try next time.

This was a great summer bbq corn salad. I did take everyone's advice and scaled back on the onion as I didn't want it overpowering the taste. Based on my guests reviews of the salad, that was a good decision to do. I also added a little bit more olive oil than what the recipe called for as well. Delicious, fresh, and crisp. Great if you are looking for a cold veggie salad to serve this summer. This will become a staple at my bbqs from now on!

This is the THE BEST corn salad I have ever tried! I used 3 mid-size unpeeled Japanese Cucumber in place with normal cucumber for extra crunchiness. Added a pinch of sugar when tossing all ingredients. End result? Beautifully-coloured salad and the taste was so refreshing with combination of sweet, sour, peppery taste! Hubby who is not a salad fan now always begs for more and couldn't get enough each time I make this :) Thank you very much for this extra-licious, super-yummy salad recipe, Eileen. It is definitely a 5-star rating from me and hubby, of course!!!

This is a great side dish, and, as mentioned in other reviews, infinitely adaptable.  I just grilled some corn and used a lime-based vinaigrette seasoned with some of my bbq rub and the resulting salad was incredible.  Use the printed recipe as a base, and work in what you have available.

This is DELICIOUS! I used canned corn instead of fresh and it was still very good and quick. I added salt according to my taste and added a little balsamic vinegar - i think it made a big difference!

Easy and delicious.  I used defrosted frozen corn kernels - about 6 cups worth.  I also used red onion, it was giant so I only put a half or else it would have been super onion-y!  I also chopped up a jalapeno and sweet red pepper and added those.  Turned out delicious!  Also didn't need all of the oil, only used about half, as others had suggested.  It went over well at the potluck I brought it to!

This a great summer vegetable side dish, when fresh sweet corn is in season.  I used shallots instead of onions and followed everything else.

I made this recipe for a dinner party and it was delicious!  Very refreshing on a hot Saturday evening, my guests loved it.  Aside from all the ingredients the recipe calls for I also added yellow tomatoes and green/red peppers, it made it look very colorful too.

Excellent flavor! I made the Tropical version mentioned by other members. This is how I modified the recipe: I left out the tomatoes. I used a medium red onion rather than a large basic yellow or white. I cut the oil in half, using only 2 Tb. of olive oil. I used rice vinegar rather than white vinegar. I added in 3 small snack-size boxes of gold raisins, 1 diced orange pepper, and a small container (about 1 cup) of diced pineapple, drained. My family loved it! Thanks! :) p.s. It does taste better if you let it sit in the fridge overnight.

Although it's a fairly basic and common recipe, it's simple and reliable, so I will keep this one on file.  I might try adding cilantro instead of basil next time for a different taste.  Thanks!

I scaled this down to less servings and came up with 2 ears of corn for the amount I needed. Next time I'll definently use more corn as that was the best part with all the other different flavors complementing it.

A perfect picnic food! It's light, and full of summer flavor. The only thing I did differently was to use cooked frozen white corn instead of the fresh (just to save time). It was delicious!

I loved the combination of fresh vegetables, but fond the salad a little bland as a main dish. Next time, I will make it as a side and maybe add some additional vinegar and herbs to punch up the flavor.

This is my favorite recipe for a summer salad. I microwave the corn (directions from this site) and it's so easy. I used Sicilian lemon balsamic vinegar with a good olive oil and farmer's market fresh tomatoes. As fall is creepy in the air here, I'm holding n to summer with this salad!

Very good! I used balsamic vinegar since its what I had on hand.  I loved the basil, but next time I think I'd use cilantro. This recipe had a little too much onion for my taste, but that's just me. I liked it, but I only give five stars when my husband asks me to make it again, which he didn't.

This was so easy and a perfect side for BBQ ribs.  I also took every shortcut mentioned by previous reviewers.  Used a can of sweet corn (drained), one tomato, about a 1/4 cup of red onion and 2-3 tbsp of zesty Italian dressing.  Besides being fast and tasty, it was yummy as a substitute for salsa over bean & cheese burritos the next day.

This is a great tasting summer side as written.  To adjust for my family's taste I now use halved cherry tomatoes, 1/2 a sweet onion, 1/3 cup vinegar, 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tsp pepper.  No salt to keep it heart healthy.  If I'm making a lot of sides for a large gathering I'll use 1-1/2 bags of good quality frozen sweet corn because it cuts down prep time dramatically, though it's not quite as fresh tasting. I'll also swap cilantro for the basil if i'm serving with Mexican food or just want that taste.

I’ve been making this for years! It’s a great way to use up some of my garden produce. I like to add cucumber and use cilantro in place of basil also basil is good too! I like to get the salt and pepper corn from the local veggie stand when in season during the summer. Very colorful and tasty healthy salad! Thanks!!!

This has become my very favorite salad, and I just can't keep it in the house!  Everyone in my house has really enjoyed it!  I didn't read any of the other comments, but I used canned sweet corn - called "steam crisp" - and it was still beyond delicious!!!  Thanks for sharing!

I want to like it, but I can't. I've made this on two separate occasions, once with canned corn kernels and once with barbecued corn. Obviously it was better the second time, but it's just too bland for me.

Loved this recipe!  Was so light and refreshing tasting.  I cut the corn off the cob and then cooked the corn that way instead of having to handle hot corn cobs to cut the corn off. 
 And I used green onion instead of regular onion and then added crumbled feta cheese too.  Delicious!  I will definitely be making this again.  Thank you so much for the recipe.

This is a great refreshing summer salad. My son is a confirmed tomato hater but, loves this and doesn't balk at the tomatoes. I make it just as it is written with the exception of microwaving the corn.

This might be another recipe already listed but I love to make a canned or fresh corn watermelon salad with cilantro and mint leaves and honey lime dressing, S&P.  Add  red onion if you like and other herbs! I have eaten this all by myself! Honey lime dressing is awesome!!!

I usually love a tangy flavor but not so much here. I might try again with a less tangy dressing. The vegetables are a great combo though.

This was a pretty good salad, very fresh tasting using my garden tomatoes and basil and canned corn.  However, even with the onion (I used sweet Walla Walla onions) we felt it needed a bit more of a kick for our tastes.  We don't like super spicy foods, but DH and I both felt either some red pepper flakes or a little bit of chopped jalapeño would provide the needed spice.  I'd also like to try this again using grilled corn to see how that affects the overall taste. This salad was quick to assemble and made a lovely table presentation.  I'll make this again, but will try spicing it up a bit.  Thanks for this recipe!

I used red onion for the milder flavour and added colour, and added a good dose of fresh black pepper.  As others have mentioned, this is a great make-ahead salad as the flavours intensify the longer it sits.  So easy and so pretty!

It is very good, but rather bland.  I would use more vinegar, more salt and pepper, and a little cayenne seasoning to give it more flavor.   Colorful and looks appealing.

Easy and good. I used frozen shoepeg corn to shorten the prep time (I'm sure fresh would be better). Next time I will use less onion but dice it smaller so you still get some with every bite. I will also use a bit more basil. The basil added a ton of freshness but the onion can be a little over powering. Really good recipe that can be made ahead of time.

No changes. I thought it bland. it looks nice but I will not make again. My granddaughter liked it but my husband (who likes just about everything) did not. Perhaps the ordinary flavours appealed to a younger pallet

This was amazing! We are on our third night of eating it and it just gets better each night!   I used of a Visalia onion and I roasted it after I  cut it into chunks… It added just a touch of sweetness to it. This is my new favorite summer side dish!

This was a perfect salad for a summer day with all of my favorite ingredients.  When I have been in a hurry or it is not corn season I have also used frozen corn which I thought did not take away from the salad at all.

We have excellent fresh, local corn during the summer so I looked forward to making this recipe.  Based on comments from other contributors, I used 1 red onion, added some garlic (1 tsp of fresh garlic) and a few dashes of red pepper flakes.  I also added a tablespoon or so of lime juice.  Instead of the oil and vinegar, I used about 2/3 of a bottle of one of the Good Seasoning's mixes.  Don't overcook the corn because it tastes better with some crunch.  Everyone at the party raved about it and how it had some kick to it!  I loved Lisa's recommendation about how to cut the corn off the cob by using a bundt or angel food pan.

I made this last night fro dinner and it was amazing.  I was growing bored of the summer corn on the cob and tomato and cucumber salad and was looking for something different. This filled the bill! I used the golden sweet cherry tomatoes from the garden and a combo of butter and sugar and silver queen corn.  (Hint for cooking the corn- I hate boiling it in a pot of water, it heats my kitchen up too much- I bought corn fresh from the farmers market and kept it in the husks. I placed the corn in the microwave, one ear at a time for 4-5 minutes and ended up with perfectly cooked corn.) I also used a red onion and white wine vinegar. My kids (10 and 5) even went back for seconds! I am really looking forward to having the leftovers for lunch and curious to find out how the taste has changed in the fridge for the night. This will defiantly go in the "make again" pile. Thanks!!

Super easy to make and taste great. I love simple foods. I used 3 cans of corn instead. I also used red onion. It's a keeper. Even my 3 yr old son loved it.

This is a great salad with not dressing and nothing to hide the freshness of the vegetables.  I will make it often!

Used 4 ears of corn, cooked for about 5 minutes, halved cherry tomatoes, a quarter of a sweet onion, some diced red bell pepper, and drizzled on just a little bit of the oil.  Used a little bit of balsamic vinegar and everything tasted incredibly fresh and sweet, with just a bit of tang from the vinegar.  It made 6 servings easily.  Maybe more.  I can't wait to make this again during the summer!

I REALLY wanted to like this salad.  Had such a nice combination of flavors and good reviews.  Made it exactly as written except for using the halved cherry tomatoes in place of regular.  It WAS pretty!  Just needed something to give it a little oomph, IMO.  Lots left over-think I will try adding some jalapenos to the rest.  Sorry.

Yummy and refreshing. 
I used canned shoepeg corn, drained.  I also added 1/4 cup green peppers, and I used cherry tomatoes, halved. I also used purple onion as someone else suggested. 
It is even better the next day!
I will make this again and again!

I absolutely love this recipe. It's a good reference base for what I make. Normally, I half all of the ingredients and omit the vinegar/oil. Instead I use creamy Italian dressing and add the seasoning. It is freaking amazing.

This was allright. My fiance's brothers came to visit today (my fiance and I got a new doggie we wanted them to meet!). My fiance grilled brats / Italian sausages and I made two salads to serve on the side. This was one of the salads I prepared. I really wanted to make a fruit salad (i.e. strawberry pretzel, taffy apple, etc.), but because my fiance doesn't like fruit at all, I was stuck searching for something that he would eat. Unfortunately, most of the salads in my recipe box call for ingredients he hates lol! :) I must say, this was very quick and easy to prepare. To speed prep even further (totally not necessary tho...), I purchased a 32 oz. bag of frozen sweet corn. Instead of chopping tomatoes, I halved a pint of grape ones. I used a Vadila onion to add a little sweetness and DOUBLED the basil (I love the stuff!!!). NOTE: Be sure to s&p REALLY well. Properly seasoning is crucial, especially adding enough salt. Also note that 2 medium-sized ears of corn equal approximately 1 c. frozen. Had I known this beforehand, I wouldn't have splurged for the 32 oz. bag (and that may be the reason for this being bland). Overall, this was good, but nothing to write home about. Perhaps after sititng overnight this will taste better. I also think using a good quality balsamic or red wine vinegar would add more flavor. Thanks anyways, Eileen! :-)

Very bland.  Tasted like raw, fresh veggies in a bowl.  Only used half of a red onion instead of a whole and that was still way too oniony.  I ended up having to put some Italian dressing on it to give it some extra flavor and it made it taste so much better.

Did recipe as described...awesome.  what I like is that it allows for so many options....red wine or balsamic vinegar....or herbs to give it a southwest flavor...or even ham, bacon, chicken.   Hard to go wrong with fresh corn and summer tomatoes and anything else one wants to add !!  Thanks for the recipe !

We used frozen corn to throw this salad together at the last minute.  It was very tasty, but for my own personal preference, I'll cut down on the basil next time, or maybe switch it out for a change of pace.  Very good!

Great salad to tryand clean out the refrigrator.  I used grape tomatoes; green onions and some mushrooms.  Also used balsamic vinegar - because it's what I had in the house today.  I have made the recipe as listed and turns out wonderful.

I made this to bring to a party as a nice alternative to a potato salad.  I am not a big fan of onions, but I tried a taste and it was very flavorful.  I received many compliments.  Based on the reviews and time constraints, I made this a day ahead.  I also grilled the corn rather than boiling.

This was so good made with fresh, locally grown corn, tomatoes, and onions.  I had to use freeze dried basil because I didn't grow any, and the local market didn't have fresh, but it still turned out amazing.

Great salad! My husband is a picky eater, but he loved this salad. I made this dish a few times, it is always great and refreshing. I also changed it up a little,I use frozen corn and leave tomatoes and basil out and add kidney beans instead. You can mix pretty much anything you have in the pantry as long as you use corn and the dressing as base. Great recipe!

really good.  I had a giant can of corn sitting idle taking up precious space in my cramped kitchen....I used purple onion and way less oil (about 2 tablespoons) and rice vinegar.  Chill for at least an hour and enjoy!!

I love this salad! I've made this a few times for different occasions and have had rave reviews. The only steps I do differently are I cut the corn off the cob and then throw it in the boiling water with the onions for a few minutes to soften up a little and cut the onion flavor a little (unless its a vadalia, then I love the flavor) and I add cut up cucumber in for some extra crunch. I also add chopped parsley with the basil. Ive made it with a garlic red wine vinegar as well and that makes a good variation. This is a fun recipe to play around with.

Great tasting and easy to make. I added about 1 tablespoon of rice wine vinegar also for more flavor.

This was great! I actually liked it better as a dip with Chips. I added pinto beans, a few chopped Jalapeños and balsamic glaze turned out awesome. I agree that it is better the next day. Reminded me of another recipe I make a lot. So I think I will combine the two in the future. ( Add: kidney beans and black beans.

Wonderful recipe, great salad. Be sure to serve cold, as warm corn takes away from the crisp freshness. We'll definitely be making this one many times over the summer.

This is pretty good.  I used frozen corn (a whole bag) and put in some peppers and jalapenos.  I made it once before as well, I always just add in whatever veggies seem like a good idea.  I only used 1/2 the oil and it was enough, very yummy!

Very easy, light, and good.  I used 3 12 oz. bags of frozen corn, about 2 10 oz. containers of grape tomatoes (sliced in half), 1 package of fresh basil, and 1 red onion, and had enough to feed about 20.  I think next time - 1 bag of corn, 1 container of tomatoes, and half the basil and only about 1/3 of the onion will be right.  Need to cut the liquid ingredients in half to accomodate.  Also, instead of 1/2 cup of olive oil, I used 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup of italian dressing and it was delicious.  I'd do this split again.

I brought this to a picnic and everyone enjoyed it and asked for the recipe.  Someone brought some Mexican beef to put in a tortilla shell and people quickly added this salad as salsa for that!  I used a lot of the suggestions for additions to the salad.  I'll make it again.

Yummy!  This salad is like summer in a bowl.  I mistakenly took the corn off the cob before cooking it, so I put the corn in boiling water for 5 minutes and it was still tender-crisp and delicious.  The end result was a really beautiful, tasty salad. The only change I made was to use red onion instead of white.

This didn't work for me. I used white corn and it didn't marry well with the other flavors. My  borther's family devoured it though. Other wise I would have only given 1 star.

This was a great recipe.  I used 4 white corn on the cob, 2 small tomoato, 1 small onion, 1 Tbsp white vinegar, 1 Tbsp balsamic vinegar and a little more fresh basil than it called for. As someone else mentioned, do not skip the fresh basil, it is the best part of the flavor combination!

Overall:  Great garden colors and flavors; it is especially good on a hot summer night.

I used white and yellow frozen corn to save time and 1 large red onion. Everyone loved it. I on the other hand would prefer maybe next time a little less onion, maybe a dash or so more of vinegar and possibly using fresh corn to see the difference.

My local produce market had corn that they had marked as "the best of the year", so I decided to make this salad.  The corn was fabulous and sweet, but made as directed, this salad did not wow me.  I did let it marinate for several hours, but the flavor just wasn't there.  I added some homemade italian dressing for a little more flavor before serving.

I thought this was excellent, made just the way the recipe states.  Will make again; may try other vinegars, per others' suggestions.  Nice way to use up leftover, cooked corn on the cob.

Just OK. Not quite what I expected. My picky husband and 2 year old both enjoyed it. Used cilantro instead of basil. Would make again, but it wasn't exceptional.

It was good, but I think it needed to sit for a couple of hours before serving.  It had a sort of raw flavor to it.

This salad was nice and refreshing. My husband absolutley LOVED it! It was a little hard to get the corn off of the cob nicely. I had some big chunks of corn, but it was okay. Still tasted wonderful! Thanks for a great recipe that is healthy and light!

My mom gave me a bag of corn on the cob and tomatoes from the garden and I didn't want to waste this good stuff so I looked for a recipe, found this and it was very good! I used fresh basil and Good Seasons Italian dressing made in the carafe with red wine vinegar.
