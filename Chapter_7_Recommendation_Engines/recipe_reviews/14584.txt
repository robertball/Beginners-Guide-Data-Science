I buy several bags of pita bread and keep them in the freezer.  Just heat the oven to 400, spread the sauce on a frozen "crust" (no need to defrost) and sprinkle on cheese and toppings.  Bake for 5 to 7 minutes and a very quick dinner or snack (even breakfast sometimes for my kids!) is served!  Really great idea!

I'm giving this 5 stars, even though I changed the recipe.  I just love finding a way to have pizza, if you want to eat whole grains instead of white flour.  I think this is more low carb than having regular pizza as well.  I may try using a pita in the future but I've been making this recipe using whole wheat tortillas.  Instead of grilling them, I put them on aluminum foil on a cookie sheet.  Then I spread a little olive oil on top, then red sauce, shredded lowfat mozzarella, & then whatever I want as a topping.  I bake them at 350 degrees for about 15 to 20 minutes.  Even though they're thin, you actually can pick them up to eat them like pizza slices.  I've topped them at various times with fresh sliced mushrooms  (which I've microwaved for a couple minutes 1st & drained so they wouldn't be too watery on the pizza), zucchini slices (partially microwaved 1st), & cooked drained ground meat.  YUM!

I sprayed my pita with cooking spray and saved a few grams of fat. I have since made this with green and red peppers, sliced mushroom and red onion, zucchini. Very quick and delicious.

I really enjoyed the pizza especially the crispy crust (I used the oven). It was quick and easy.

This was fun! I used "garlic and herb" pitas, added some green bell peppers, chopped red onion, and some thinly sliced canadian bacon. I also used "pizza cheese" (a combo of cheddar and moz). Boy was I a skeptic about grilling this but it turned out really good - and VERY simple! I'll remember this for our upcoming camping trip! Thanks!

What a great appetizer! You can obviously do so much with this recipe to suit your own tastes. For something a little different, try using tortillas in place of the pita and top with either tomato or taco sauce and sprinkle with shredded cheddar and jack cheese. Fantastic Mindy!

Absolutely delicious! I made these in the oven at 400 degrees for 10 minutes. I put the pita on the cookie sheet ( I didn't grease the sheet). I also tried this recipie with a whole wheat tortilla. Both came out with crispy crust and tasted amazing! I will definately make these again!!

Wow - I really didn't think the pita would be such a good pizza crust!  It was much better than any thin crust pizza I have had before.  This is such a versatile recipe -so this is how I made it my own.  I used whole wheat tortillas, sprayed with fat free cooking oil, huge spoonfuls of tomato paste, big chunks of fresh garlic, left over grilled chicken that I cut into big bite sized pieces, red onions that I already had chopped from before, fat-free mozarella and cheddar shredded cheese, and dried basil, oregano, and parsley.  Put it in the grill for 6-7 minutes (had to wait for the cheese to melt).  It was FANTASTIC.  I kept a few pitas on hand so I can change up the ingredients for the next batch.  Thanks Mindy!

This is by far the best idea I have heard in a long time! I used pizza sauce, 6 cheese blend, low sodium pepperoni, onions and green peppers and I was in heaven! I made two because one simply wasn't enough but even with eating two small one's it's still less calories and fat than takeout. I am currently pregnant and have had a nasty aversion to oils of just about all types. This has put the breaks on pizza dough, chocolate, peanut butter, nuts, etc, etc, etc. I ate this and did not have one hint of oil and that's rare these days. I would love to kiss the chef, thank you for this idea! I am going to try garlic Naan and see how that works!!

We LOVE this recipe. I usually get a jar of tomato sauce and spice it up with minced garlic and tony's (a creole seasoning we use in the south) for a yummy kick. I get this shredded cheese mix, I think it's like 5 cheese Italian or something, and it has mozz., asiago, parm, provolone, and something else I can't remember. And then we put whatever toppings: pepperoni, mushrooms, zucchini, eggplant, anything we are in the mood for that day! Before we assemble them, I brush the pitas with olive oil on both sides and garlic powder on the side with toppings...makes it extra pizza-crusty. Then we pop them on the grill until they're nice and crispy. SO much like pizza! OH ALSO--get the whole wheat pitas...makes a big difference!!

This is 5 star as written, but it is also great in the oven (using Pam instead of olive oil).  I also make it veggie style with mushrooms, tomatoes and broccoli.  Hubby likes it with bacon, bell pepper and tomatoes.  Thanks for the inspiration!

Hah! What an awesomely quick and slightly healthier way to have pizza! 
Don't have a grill so made them in the oven. 350 degrees for about 15 minutes does the trick. Made some with zucchini and some with mushrooms and both turned out yummy. You could add just about any topping you like to these. Ill keep this recipe in mind for a quick lunch and or snack!
Thanks for sharing!

Loved it!  What a fabulous, healthy way to enjoy pizza!  Just be careful if your grill cooks unevenly... you may end up with a couple of crusty pizzas while the others are just fine.  Keep an eye on ALL of them!

Super quick and easy.  Very tasty.  Make sure to place pizzas on aluminum foil on the top shelf in order to keep them from getting too crispy on the bottom.  It would also be wise to use thick, fluffy pitas.

We loved this.  Simple, easy, and since I love crispy thin crust pizza, this ended up being just perfect to me.  Instead of tomato sauce, we did it the old fashioned Italian way and put sliced tomatoes, also onion, garlic, some slices of mozzarella, basil and oregano and some salt and pepper flakes.  It was delish.  My husband has been nagging me for more!!

Thank you for this recipe! You are brilliant. I have been trying to find a pizza recipe I could make at home and this is now my go to recipe. It was delicious and low in fat. I used Pomi chopped tomatoes which I always stock up on in my pantry. The cremini mushrooms were a perfect choice. I added olives, red onion, red pepper, fresh basil. I served it with grilled corn and a nice salad. A perfect light healthy dinner.

This has become my "go-to" recipe when we are in the mood for pizza, but do not feel like running after take-out....(I live in the country, unfortunatly no delivery).  My family each customize the pizza and put on our favorite toppings.  Quick and easy!

These were delicious.  My family really enjoyed this. This was the first time I every cooked pizza on the grill and it won’t be the last.  I used Boboli mini 8” pizza crust.  Everyone through it was fun fixing their own pizza.    I sautéed some onions, green peppers, fresh mushrooms and fresh baby spinach on my pizza, put it on the grill the crust was nice and crusty, it was just delicious. Like other viewer said, I will probably not order pizza again, at least not in the summer months.

I was craving pizza, but living in a place where it gets super hot outside, I didn't want to leave the comfort of central A/C.  I pulled out the ingredients, which I always have on hand, made a salad, and my husband and I had a great dinner.  Definitely hit the spot.  Delish!!

These were spectacular! I changed up the toppings a bit. I used a store bought garlic alfredo sauce that I had leftover from dinner the night before, and I added smoked provolone and broccoli with a bit of parmesan cheese on top. Absolutely decadent, and sooo easy and quick. Thanks a bunch for the recipe, I'll definitely be making these again.

This recipe was more delicious than expected.  I made it as a healthy alternative to traditional pizza and to my surprise it was better .  I added more veggies, used whole wheat pita bread and skipped the olive oil. Thank you!

WOW! Used whole wheat pitas, left off the oil, sauteed mushrooms and onions with garlic powder in a little butter, and used them.  Added diced tomatoes. Fabulous!  Did a second time using ranch dressing as sauce, shredded cooked chicken, tomatoes, sauteed mushrooms and cheese. Hubby says best pizza crust he's ever had!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a really fun dinner to make with our kids, everyone customized it to their liking, two had pepperoni, one had red, yellow & green peppers with mushrooms, and the other pepp, mush, and sausage. (I basically did a topping bar...) and then we added some crushed red pepper flakes on top for a kick. Whole wheat pitas were the way to go, and the kids were already begging to do this again. Thanks so much! It is nice to have an alternative to the expensive delivery...

I used naan bread because it was on sale. Just as good really. I didn't grill mine either, I just threw it all in the toaster oven. It came out wonderfully. My boyfriend, who can't make macaroni and cheese by himself actually got up the next morning and made one of these for his breakfast. Talk about a life saver. Thanks for the great recipe!

I don't like pizza at all but this I can eat once in a while. It was very delicious and tasty. I just baked it in my oven for 10 minutes. I will make this for my little nephew Jordan. Because I know he and his sister loves pizza. This is a more healthier version and they can't eat too much because they're small.

This was great!  I let the kids put their own toppings on their "mini" pizzas.  My only suggestion would be to buy a pizza cutter, the crust gets so so crispy it is tough to cut with a knife and not lose the cheese.  Yum!

This was awesome and simple!!!  The crust is crispy and you can top this with anything you want.  I skipped the olive oil and added turkey pepperoni as a topping.  Delicious!  You can make it anytime, anywhere.  Who would of thought about pizza on the grill!! YUMMY!

I did this the lazy way! I broiled a wheat pita round for a couple minutes, added toppings (basil pesto sauce, chicken, broccoli and mozzarella cheese is what I used) then broiled it all until the cheese was melted! I'm in college so I love fast, warm meals with minimal ingredients. P.S. I cooked the chicken and broccoli before I added it to the pizza. Broiling it for a couple minutes will not cool the toppings.

Absolutely delicious in every way. I've made several times. While it is perfect as-is, you can also cook it in the over at 375 for 10-15 minutes and it comes out perfect as well. I added bell peppers for a wonderful and delicious meal.

This is a great recipe!  Makes a great fast snack or dinner served with a salad.  Simple to adapt for whatever you want on top (we've made it with just cheese, and others with mushrooms, precooked Italian sausage, pepperoni, onions).  The surprise is the crispy crust and edges you get on the pita.  I also made these in the oven 3 times now and they are a new family favorite.  My son requested trying them taco style so I omitted any sauce because the taco meat was juicy and covered it with Kraft Mexican 3 cheese blend and again delicious. Try it-be creative-it's pheonomenal :)

This was really good! I had a gourmet mushroom mix that included crimini mushrooms that I needed to use, so we used that.  Husband and I love veggies, so I added what veggies I had to our pizzas. (Onion, green pepper, tomato)also added pepperoni, Italian seasoning, crushed red pepper.  
I think my favorite part was the idea to add olive oil to the marinara. Something I will adopt from here on out! So customizable to what you have on hand. The grill also gave it a little extra kick!

This is an excellent recipe.  It produced some of the best pizza that I have ever had, a product far superior to the big chain restaurants.

I cooked mine in the oven.  400 degrees for about 20 minutes, until there is just a hint of brown in the top layer of cheese.  

I used garlic powder instead of salt to keep the sodium level down.  In addition I sprinkled the crust with oregano.

I mixed up the toppings on mine (spinach, red bell peppers, onions, garlic, and fresh basil that I sauteed altogether for a couple minutes) but used the same method. It was the first pita pizza I've ever had and it was AMAZING, I will definitely keep pitas in the freezer from now on! Thanks!

Delicious!  I used Greek pita bread, brushed with olive oil and fresh white mushrooms, spinach and red peppers.  Very easy and great to make with kids because they can put on whatever they want.

PbA, thx for the tip about microwaving the shrooms b4hand to dejuice them. I actually made both pita and tortilla pizzas, since I had both items on-hand, and honestly i liked the pitas way better. they ended up crunchy & the tortillas didnt. PS.they have whole wheat & multi-grain pita pockets now. I baked mine at 350, 20 mins. And I also split my pita pocket and made two out of one. It was GREAT!

A very simple recipe that is so quick to make. Used Greek style pitas that have no pocket, so there was no danger of them puffing up in the oven. Cooked in the oven at 350 instead of out on the grill in the cold and snow. Easy to adapt to the preferences of each family member. I wonder if the oil was really necessary, though. I think next time I will try to make it healthier and lower calorie by using whole wheat pitas, leaving out the oil, and adding lots of fresh veggies. Thanks for the great idea.

I make these when I can find pitas on the clearance rack at my local grocery store. I like mine with EVOO, garlic, fresh basil, tomatoes and fresh parmesan. The kids are a little more traditional with homemade pizza sauce, pepperoni and italian blend cheese. It really is the best on the grill, but it tastes pretty good just out from under the broiler.

for a even thinner (almost cracker-like) crust, slice the pita in half crosswise so you have 2 rounds.  then bake them until slightly golden and crisp.  add sauce, cheese, any toppings  you want and back again to melt the cheese.  enjoy.

This is a good recipe for when you are searching for a really quick, easy summer dinner. I didn't have mushrooms on hand so I used pepperoni. The pitas go from "not finished" to "burnt" in no time, so watch the grill!

This is a super easy dinner or snack! I used sweet onion flavored flat bread and customized each pizza for what we wanted - one with pesto, olive oil, and cheese, another with tomato sauce and cheese, and the third with tomato sauce, cheese and various veggies. All were delicious!! I think I'll skip the hassle of rolling out pizza dough and just use pita/flatbread from now on! Great recipe =)

These work well to alleviate those pesky pizza cravings :)   We make them with whole wheat pitas and have tried many toppings, they're endlessly customizable!

Hey, these were great! I used whole wheat pitas and toasted them first....put them on a baking sheet...layered on the toppings...and baked them until veggies were crisp/tender and the cheese was bubbly. Used fresh green peppers and mushrooms....also used some left over Chunky Marinara Sauce from this site.....really yummy! My hubby and I enjoyed...thanks!!

VERY NICE!!!  Great light healthy meal!  I did my own pizza by doing the following......used only olive oil and NO red sauce.  I sprinkled with course ground garlic, italian seasoning, sea salt, sliced tomatos and topped with motz. cheese.  I baked on a cookie sheet @ 350 for 8 min.  Next time I will add spinach and maybe mushrooms.  Very nice and very versatile!!!!  THANKS for a new favorite

You can also bake these in the oven/toaster oven, skipping the olive oil, and they are delicious.  I'm a vegetarian so I add tofu "chicken" and veggies with soy cheese.  Wonderful.

Be CAREFUL! I have a charcoal grill and I guess I had too many coals... these babies got scorched on the bottom in no time flat. Other than that, they're great :) I'm going to make them again with less charcoal this time!

We used to make these at the summer camp I worked at a couple of years ago! The kids loved them. We would roast them over a campfire during out trips using 'Y-sticks'. The ingredients were a little different, no oil, just cheese, pepperoni, sauce, green peppers, etc. I have to say, the fire really gave a great smokey flavour. These would be great on any camping trip, at the cottage fire pit, or even in your own backyard!

Have been making these for a while now. Easy and fun to make. I put the pita in the oven on 350 until crisp and cheese is melted, about 15 to 20 min. Toppings are endless.

I used to make these in the oven. Now that it is summertime, I was wondering if I could do these on the grill!  I usually use my own sauce (or a good jarred one if I don't have time) mozzarella, onion, pepper, black olives, oregano, and pepperoni.  I don't oil either side or the grill and did not have a problem. This is also a great recipe to use up all those left over veggies or meat.  Mine took about 10 minutes on a medium heat grill.  I don't think I am going to go back to making these in the oven!  Thanks for sharing!

I always have wheat pitas on hand and was looking for something different to do w/ them. Boy were my daughters and I pleased w/ this idea!! My 3 yr old niece was so happy with herself, because she made her own dinner:-) We used store bought sauce, a slice of provolone cheese, turkey-pepperoni, caned portabella mushrooms, topped w/ low-fat feta cheese. YUM!

Great idea for a quick meal. I made a barbeque chicken pizza. Spread BBQ over pita then top with cut up chicken, bacon bits on onion. Then top with mozzarela cheese.

This is an awesome basic recipe.  I made a family night out of it and each of the kids showed their artistic abilities.  I put a whole bunch of different toppings and let the kids make their own and it was a blast.  We now do this at least once a month.  Thank you so much for the idea and the memories.

As with any other type of homemade pizza, by the time you buy the pitas, sauce, cheese, meat, & veggies, you are looking at a very expensive meal. But it is always fun for everyone to make their own creations, especially the kids. We tried grilling it a couple of different ways and found the best way is to grill for about 30 secs-1 minute on one side of the pita, then take it off the grill and load the cooked side with the toppings, then place back on the grill for a few more minutes til the cheese is melted. Will definitely make this again, although next time I might try doing it potluck style with some friends and have everyone bring a couple of ingredients to help bring down the cost. Thanks!

This recipe is genius. I cannot believe that I didn't think of this first! I always have pita, spaghetti sauce, and shredded cheese at home so this is now a very convenient snack for us. I top it with whatever I have in the fridge that may sound good; onions, olives, pastrami, basil, turkey, etc. I don't grill them though, I just put them in the toaster oven and toast it for about 7-10mins. Thank you so much for this great recipe which has come in handy for snack/lunch so many times for me when I had nothing else to prepare.

We've been doing these for years because it's the perfect do-it-yourself idea for large groups. You can chop, slice, prep ahead of time & have one person manning the grill. Everyone loves it because they choose their own favorite toppings!  Some other choices: marinated artichokes, olives, red onion, peppers (green, red, hot, pickled), spinach, broccoli, fresh basil.  Your favorite spaghetti sauce from the jar works just fine, too, and is less expensive than pizza sauce!

Never thought to use pita as crust!  We loved it!  We did slice the pitas so we had 2 pizzas per pita.  Nice and crispy and tasty!  Topped with peppers, onions fresh garlic and mushrooms!  Yummy!  Did not use the garlic salt.  Tank for the idea!

I have used pita for pizza many times, another favorite meat to try is chorizo.  I also use tortillas for crust.  I layer 2 together with some cheese in between because they are thin.

This was SO GOOD! I used olive oil, wheat pitas, jarred Ragu sauce with added oregano and garlic powder. Oh just so easy to make, fast and a crowd pleaser.  Although I love to make pizza dough from scratch I hate the mess.  Didn't grill but used my pizza stone in the oven.  Can't believe I hadn't thought of using pitas before....

tasty pizza and very filling. though i must subtract a star from my rating due to the fact that the cheese easily slipped off the pizza itself. what did i do wrong?

This were really good, and most importantly, my 5, 3, and 1 year old boys loved this. Its a great lunch for the younger ones to help make. The only thing I did different was different toppings (mine had mozz, diced tomatoes, and basil & my boys just had cheese) I also baked rather than grilled. Will be making this every weekend when my kids are off school!

I love Pita Bread in general, therefore, I love this Idea. My advice is to keep in mind what you like and lay it on there. I also recommend to try out a Pita Chips Recipe and if desired, find a dip to go with it, great snack.

I omit the olive oil and place the pitas on a cookie sheet. Pop in the oven at 400* for about 10 minutes to crisp them "crust" up. We have a pizza bar full of toppings and everyone makes there own. Place them back in the oven for another 10 minutes. VIOLA! Personal pizzas.

My husband had little confidence when he first heard that I used pita for the pizza "dough." However, we both were pleasantly pleased with the results. My husband actually kept talking about how great it was. It is also great for us since it is always hard to stay eat healthy portions when a large pizza is present. These are perfectly sized for a smart portion. Oh, I also added toppings and baked it rather than grilling.

This recipe is my son's favorite. I tend to bake it most of the time, because it's too cold to grill outside right now, but it's just as good baked.

So easy and delicious! I cant believe i never thought to do this myself. I love pita, and i love pizza, so the two go naturally together. You can easily improvise to taste as well, add mushrooms, or pepperoni, onions, whatever you want! Love it, definitely will make this again on a regular basis.

Super easy and delicious.  The crust turned out crispy but still had a little chew in the middle. We both loved it.  We made our pizzas with pasta sauce, mozzerella cheese, and pepperoni slices.  Try putting the sauce on last, as a topping, and it will be just like Chicago Pizza here in Jacksonville.

I actually made this with cut up chicken tenders, instead of grilling I microwaved it for a minute & 30 secs, it was the softest & most cheesiest pizza. All I did was 3-4 teaspoons of meat sauce, Parmesan & cheddar cheese on top, then added leftover chicken tenders (chopped to small pieces), more cheese on top and it was GREAT. I also made a pepperoni one, my take on this is around 400 calories for the whole pizza when done, it’s a great meal for those who’s on a restricted diet plan.

This is a very good, simple and versatile recipe, as many others suggested make with whatever comes to mind. This version I did bake at 425 for 10 minutes and came out just right, I actually just placed the pita bread first off for 4 minutes to crisp up the base before adding all the toppings then let it sit for the 10 minutes.

This was delish! I used an oven for this at 350degF for 20 min. I may try upping the temp for a shorter bake time another time. I put foil on a cookie sheet and used two pitas. I drizzled each with a little olive oil, then topped with a homemade pizza sauce from this site, followed by the cheese. (I used a combo of mozzarella and colby jack.) I used bell peppers and onions on each and on one I also added some chopped ham that I had available. This is a great recipe that has so many possibilities for the cheeses and toppings. Thanks for the recipe! UPDATE 1/9/18: I made this again with a 400degF oven (would even do 425) for ~12 min. Came out better. This time I made a veggie pizza: chopped tomatoes, leftover broccoli w/garlic, and black Greek olives. I also added green peppers and onions, but this time I sauteed them for about 8 min in EVOO so they'd be softer. I also used a combination of mozzarella and gorgonzola cheese (on bottom), veggies, then more cheese. This was excellent! Note: The cheeses and olives are salty; need to go easy with them.

This is so simple and so satisfying. Made with ingredients I keep on hand, it is highly adaptable to personal taste.  Make several apiece for supper or have one for lunch.  Great idea!

we made it last Friday. it tested sooo good,but still have some defeats: 1.the dou is so thick. 2.too much oil on the dou. that's the reason why we could not thake it out from pan.  3.there need more meat on it(personal advantage). We are not study it yet. and we think it is successful and delicious pizza that i ate.

As others did I put this in the oven instead of the grill on 400 for about 10 mins to make the crust crispy along the edges. This recipe is a great base and you can really add anything to it. I spread some mince garlic and Italian seasoning on the crust before putting the sauce on and it added an amazing flavor to the pizza. I  topped my pizza with red/green bell peppers, onions, pepperoni and Canadian bacon. So easy to make and absolutely delicious! I will definitely make this again.

Really easy and tasty for a hot summer day using the BBQ.  I used spaghetti sauce and portabello mushrooms together with onion and yellow peppers on a whole wheat pita which is what I had on hand.  Tex-Mex grated cheese and a good sprinkle of cayenne on top to spice it up.  Crust was crunchy and easily held together to eat.

Try it with naan instead of pita and lightly toast the naan before topping and baking for a crisper crust. Do experiment with toppings and for a variation on sauce try pesto or any spread of your choice.

I make this often as it is a family favorite. We make it healthy by using whole-wheat pita bread, loading on the veggies, and sometimes I use cashew-parmesan instead of cheese. we omit the oil and make a cheap and easy pizza sauce with canned tomato sauce and spices. I love being able to enjoy pizza my way!

I baked it in the oven for 12 minutes on 400 degrees. I didn't use garlic, or olive oil. I topped it with pepperoni, jalapeños(I like spicy!), white onions, black olives, and crushed red peppers. SO delicious!!

I think this recipe is easy to follow and it's a fun meal for the whole family. My 4 yrs old son made the pizza himself and pita bread solves the problem with people want different toppings. Everybody wins!

Delicious! I bake on a cookie sheet at 400 for approx 10 min. I don't use mushrooms and I double/triple the amount of sauce. I use organic valley shredded mozzarella cheese, and rizzos brand pizza sauce.

Was a quick weeknight dinner.  Less calories than a traditional pizza with the same fulfillment. Made ours with green peppers, onions, black olives, and lots of mozzarella! A definite new staple in our household.

This recipe is so great and so easy!  The mushrooms are a necessity, as they taste so yummy with the pita bread.  I add onion and green bell pepper as well.  Also, I bake it in the oven at 400 for about 10 minutes.

Very easy to make for lunch or a snack. I didn't use the mushrooms though or the garlic salt but did season with herbs we like.

I've tried to make pizza at home trying every different type of crust out there, never liked any of them.  Using pita for the crust is perfect!  Thanks for the recipe.

Love this idea! Quick meal or snack.  This is something you can modify and add anything as a topping.
