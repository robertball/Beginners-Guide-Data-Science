I had green jalapeno instead of red and had to go hunting for Sriracha. It was worth it my husband proclaimed them the best I ever made and I liked them as well.

Instant hit! Deviled eggs are a holiday must have in my family, every year. This year I decided to switch it up with Chef John's spicy twist to the predictable Deviled Egg, and I'm never going back! Deviled Eggs do not have to be made standard, or with boundaries.... Mix it up, adjust the spice to your liking, and "never make it the same twice, because that's no fun!".
Each time I have made them, I use a little more of this and a little less of that, mainly adjusting the level of spice according to the party I am serving. My advice, mix up the yolks according to the recipe, taste and adjust! A little trick my Mom taught me is to put the eggs in ice water to cool them down and to help the egg shells come off clean and easy. Just make sure you allow enough time for cooking, because the ice water will stop the cooking process. I put a dozen to 18 eggs in a cold pot, cover with water and cook on high until the water boils. Turn the heat down a little so the water stays on a steady boil, but not a rough rapid boil, cover and cook for 8 minutes. 
Thank you Chef John for all of your videos, I am a visual learner and your videos have given me confidence to make things I didn't know I could!

Basic recipe is pretty good.  It does give a different twist on the classic deviled egg.  I gave up Jalapenos (and other favorites) for Lent, but will add them for our Easter dinner or soon after on this recipe, but they will NOT be candied.  Lose the sugar.  Otherwise, very nice.

These were very good! I used more Siracha than called for...We really enjoyed the spice in these, and the creaminess of the filling from the cream cheese. A nice change from the norm...will make again! Thanks for sharing. :)

The yolk was raw in the middle and the shell stuck to the egg.  I wasted a dozen large eggs and did not serve deviled eggs, as an appetizer, for Easter. Bummed!

Nice combination of tastes - a bit different than the standard deviled egg.  I kinda of missed the usual sprinkling of paprika though.  Thank you for the recipe.  It was a fun one to photograph too.

We LOVE this recipe. While it's extra work I recommend going the extra mile and candy the jalapenos. It is soooo worth it. (And I don't even care for jalapenos!) In fact I've become an avid follower of the chef because of it. We bought and tasted Sriracha for the first time for this recipe and it is now a permanent staple in the pantry.

This is by far the best I've tried yet. And its beautiful red and green compliments the holidays nicely! I used white vinegar instead of rice (all i had) and a little more Sriracha. I candied a red sweet pepper (all i could find) and even though i missed the bite from a jap, these still worked wonderfully both visually and tastefully! These were AMAZING!! Thanks Chef John! Making Stuffed Peppers tonight!

My eggs were not cooperating with so I used this recipe to make a delicious egg salad.  Just add about 1/2 the egg whites, serve on rye toasts with the candied pepper on top.

Served this for a dinner party of 15 guests and every single one complimented me on them.  Huge hit!!!!  Love the different tastes and the candied pepper really added something different, including a more fancy aesthetic!

I was asked to make deviled eggs for a family reunion so I tried this recipe. I followed the directions exactly, and they turned out very good. I love the candied jalapeno on top. After a few attempts at this recipe, I did make a few adjustments for my taste. I'm not a huge mayo fan, so I cut the mayo in half, and added an extra Tablespoon of cream cheese.  I also substitute 1-1/2 teaspoons yellow mustard + 1/2 teaspoon honey instead of Dijon, which I found to be too spicy and hot for my liking.  I also like to season the unfilled egg whites with salt, cracked pepper, and dried minced garlic before I fill them.

This recipe is simple yet produced a great deviled egg.  I cut them in 1/4 and used it as an appetizer. 
The red jalapeno worked out better than I had expected.  I cut it very thin but it was delicious.

I had to sub green for red jalapeno only because they were out of red at the local produce market...but the green ones added that extra pizaz and flavor.  Can't wait to try the red soon on the next batch.  I will need to work on the texture but other than that...these are  delicious deviled eggs that are making my devils tail start to grow just a little bit longer.  Thanks again for another spot on recipe Chef John!  ... I salute you with a fork in my tongue and a smile on my face. (Not a forked tongue, those are weird, but kinda cool)

I made this for our family Christmas dinner last year and have orders to make it again for this year's. I made a few changes though. I very thinly sliced a couple of the tiny sweet peppers in red, yellow and orange and then used the green jalapeños. Some I made without the jalapeños so they weren't as spicy, but with all the peppers in the same sugar to pickle, the sweet peppers had just a little bit of bite to them too. They looked great with all the different colors

I've made dozens upon dozens of deviled egg recipes and this is by far and away my all time favorite.  The slightly sweet jalapeno pepper, the creamy egg with a kick from the sriracha, OMG  - a must try!

Tried this for lunch today.  It was great!  I did mix the egg mixture in my mini food processor for an even consistency but chunkier would be good to.  Just personal taste I think I would slice up the jalapeno rings a bit.  I wanted to have that good jalapeno in every bite.
My family likes things spice so I added 1 and 1/2 teasp. sriracha. Thanks for another winner recipe, Chef John.

I spent today making and trying a few new recipes in preparation for summer cookouts and get-togethers.

This was a winner.  Followed the recipe and the "to taste" amount of Sriracha that I liked was a generous teaspoon.  

I've never seen red jalapenos in the market but I did find red fresno peppers at one of the Asian grocery stores.  The fresno worked perfectly for this recipe.

The chives and the candied pepper ring really worked well together with the creamy filling.

These deviled eggs are the perfect combo of tangy, sweet and just a touch of spicy. I love them and so does my husband and friends that tried it. Follow the instructions exactly, you won't be disappointed! *TIP: Make sure your eggs are not very fresh for easy peeling. I learned the hard way! Use older eggs (but obviously not expired). It makes the peeling process pain free.

This recipe was better than D's Delicious Deviled eggs and I think it has loads of potential. I would have to modify it in the future and add more sriracha, mustard, and salt to kick up the flavor. My husband didn't care for the candied jalapeno on top, but I thought it added interest and enjoyed it.

These are fabulous deviled eggs! Take the couple extra minutes to make the jalapenos. This absolutely makes it over the top and the presentation is perfect. I did have to use chopped green onions instead of chives because 2 stores were both out of fresh chives. I love to play around with ingredients but with Chef John's recipes I go by the letter and will definitely use fresh chives the next time I make these. Every one of his recipes are outstanding, including this one. I doubled the recipe and they were gone in seconds at my friend's party. Everyone loved them.

the filling came out great. the method for boiling the eggs is good. but, you can't use fresh eggs AND you have to peel the eggs when they are room temp else they will peel hard and look horrible.

Made this for the first time tonight and, honestly, I'm shocked how much I love it. I do NOT like spicy things and between the jalapeno and Sriracha I was very skeptical but my wife loves Chef John's recipes so I tried it for her. And let me tell you, I'm a fan now, too! I couldn't believe how luxurious the egg mixture turned out to be, how wonderful the Dijon mustard played so well with the Sriracha and cream cheese, and the candied jalapeno was DELICIOUS.  Thank you for such a wonderful recipe--I'll never doubt again!

Chef John, I love these eggs.  These eggs get rave reviews everywhere I bring them, time and time AGAIN! ...just a lovely recipe. The flavors are well rounded. They're not boring for sure! Also thanks for the quick pickled jalapeños recipe you included.  I can't wait to try more of your recipes :-)

Very good, and the little pepper slices made them special.  I decide to just use the hot sauce I had on hand, rather then spending additional for the sraicha hot sauce -- just added a pinch of garlic too.

Wow!  This was absolutely delicious!  This method cooked the eggs perfectly.  I added more hot sauce than the recipe suggested, and I topped with paprika, but other than that, I followed the recipe.  I definitely recommend this!

I really didn't care for the addition of cream cheese and sugar.  I'm going back to the old fashion way I've used for 50 years--just mayo and mustard.

These are the best I've ever tried! I thought the sriracha flavor would be overpowering but it's not! Everything is subtle yet very flavorful!! I've made these twice and the first time I didn't make the candied jalapeños. After making it the second time exactly as the recipe is described I'm dreaming up different ways to use candied jalapeños. I can't wait to make these for holiday parties.

Delicious. Topped with fresh chives and some paprika. Made it for a cookout people loved it, even got compliments from people who said they don't normally like deviled eggs. I think the Sriracha is the key, I added a bit more than was called for

I didn't love this recipe...
The candying of the peppers was more work than they were worth, and the srirachi flavor didn't come through too well for me.

I had a 2016 New Year's party and served a variety of Hors d'oeuvres, including the recipe of these deviled eggs... I have to say, it was a HiT! Because I was preparing so many dishes and was under a time constraint, I left out the candied red jalapeño peppers. Instead, I just added sweet relish to the yolk mix. I received multiple compliments from all my guests!

I was a bit worried about cooking the eggs this way, but I have to admit the came out perfect, with not a hint of green around the yolk. I omitted the jalapeños (I'm the only one in my family that eats them) but followed the rest. Not too spicy at all, and the cream cheese really added to it. In hindsight I would've doubled the sriracha but this was my first experience cooking with it. Family hit!!!!

Love this!  Yay- thank you Chef John!  I only made two modifications based on personal taste and ingredient availability in our home.  I left off the jalapeno rings(didn't have them).  I also substituted regular pickle juice in lieu of the rice vinegar, salt, & pepper(I didn't have rice vinegar on hand and the pickle juice already had salt & pepper). They came out awesome! I really loved these. So much so that I only gave my husband one and ate the rest. Embarrassing and rare let me tell you.

I loved this recipe! The sweet jalapeños were the best, I added a little bacon for my boys who don't eat jalapeño. I also substituted the sirichia for another hot sauce but it was great. I didn't use the rice vinegar or add sugar, didn't feel like it needs it. Thank you for the recipe!

I'm not a big jalapeño fan but I had some celery so I added that instead to keep the crunchy texture. I love the idea to use cream cheese in place of some of the mayo! My family is not big on mayo either so this was a great alternative.

Wow! Perfect heat, perfect tang, perfect consistency. I didn't do the jalapeño, but I will try it next time. I also boil my eggs for 6 or 7 minutes and then let them sit in the pan for 6 or 7 before putting them in cold water. Great recipe!

I used a sweet red pepper instead of the candied jalapeño and chopped some fresh basil because I didn't have any chives. Used balsamic vinegar because that's what I had in the kitchen. Also sprinkled a little smoked paprika and cayenne pepper over the eggs. They ended up looking awesome and my boyfriend loved the flavor.

A good deviled egg recipe.  Lost one star for me as I like a bit of sweetness with the yolk mixture and the pepper would add that except it was just a bit more effort than I wanted to put into a deviled egg. Other than that I am sure most would find this variation quite tasty.

Delicious!  I loved these and they had a great flavor.  Something different to spruce up a classic deviled egg.  I didn't do the pickled peppers, but I know they would be so good on top.  The only thing I did differently was to add the green onion/chives into the filling rather than on top, and added a touch of sugar, maybe 1-2 tsp to slightly sweeten the filling.  So good and flavorful!  Thank you for the recipe!

Did not have jalapeño, so added a little sugar/water mixture to the eggs and used less rice vinegar. Topped it of with a Sriracha/Lime Fusion to give it a sweet and spice combo. Mmmmm good!

I made these for a work party.  had them on the front seat of my truck when a deer ran out in front of me.  The eggs flew off the seat and rolled to the floor.  amazingly, they kept their pretty shape (thanks to the cream cheese)  These eggs were a hit!  Everyone asking for a copy of my recipe!  Don't worry Chef John, I didn't take the credit!  And now you have more followers!

I changed it quite a bit.  Some don't like mayo so I subbed sour cream and we don't like hot stuff so omitted that and added just a pinch of hot sauce.  My first time making deviled eggs because I don't like the standard recipe.  I do like Chef John.

Perfect basic deviled egg recipe.  The "candied" pepper on top is worth the extra effort.

Couldn’t find a red Jalaoeno. Will try it next time for contrasting color and a zingy sweetness. Very good though using chives and sweet paprika.

I used green jalapeno peppers instead of the red. I used sriracha spice instead of the sauce. Everyone in the office loves these deviled eggs.  I have to admit they were good. I used the method of boiling the eggs and they came out perfect. Thank you for the video and the recipe.  I am going to try your sriracha sauce recipe.

This is the quickest way I know to get rid of a dozen eggs. If you like a little spice with your eggs, this is the recipe for you. The fam cannot leave them "for later", so the eggs are done, -- and gone. 

I did not have rice vinegar, so put in balsamic. It changes the color a bit, but it is delicious.

Love this recipe! I make mine a little spicier. I add habanero powder to the filling and garnish with bacon (I added habanero powered to the bacon too;-). Love using cream cheese for texture.

Sorry Chef John, this is not my favorite recipe.  I added the water and it made it way too thin.  I had to add some dry potato flakes to thicken it up.  It was a winner with my husband though!!  He love them!   So, I'm going to change my rating to a five star!  Thank you for providing me such delicious and fun videos!

I had all ingredients except the jalapeño so I used a red pepper instead. They taste delicious though, but would use the hot pepper next time. What a difference the cream cheese makes!

For a person that made deviled eggs for the first time it was hard to figure out how to cook them but I think that it was easier that a lot of other recipes. I think for this recipe you need patience because once it is done you are probably proud of your self. You also have to pay attention to the recipe. If you can do all the things than the eggs are right to make for you. Cause they take a really long time. Anyway try this recipe and see how you like it.

Used balsamic instead of white vinegar and used a green jalapeno because that's all the store had. I also garnished with a small piece of bacon. The salty bacon with the sweet/spicy jalapeno and the creamy deviled egg filling proved a major draw! They disappeared quickly!

I personally put the egg yokes into a large sandwich bag, mix the ingredients then cut a small hole in the bag's corner then  squeeze the mixture into the egg halves. I  have tried a few different recipes and like this one. I also do a version where I add sweet pickle relish and Worcestershire sauce and it comes out great.

Used tamed green jalapeños instead of red! Turned out amazing for a first time maker. I didn’t use rice vinegar though, and used regular mustard. Perfect for thanksgiving:)

I made this for a Labor Day BBQ and they were devoured! I cooked the eggs in my pressure cooker (perfect eggs every time!), so I skipped that portion of the recipe. I used green jalapeno, skipped the chives, and sprinkled with smoked paprika. To serve, I only topped half of the eggs with the jalapeno slices, which was a good thing since there were a few folks who wanted to try them, but were afraid of the heat of the peppers.

Chef John never disappoints! This was quite good. I thought there might be a distinct cream-cheesy taste but you couldn't really tell other than the texture. I didn't have sriracha so I used chipotle pepper to taste and it added a nice smoky taste. Hubby requested relish in his like he had growing up, which we also didn't have, so I improvised that with finely diced dill pickles.

Great twist on a classic.  Didn't have jalapeños on top, but think it would be a great addition. I'll be making these again!

This is a staple recipe for me and that always garners  complements. Minor changes I make: green jalapeno, apple cider vinegar, and 1 tsp sriracha. Yummy and addictive!

Couldn't find the cream cheese or peppers, substituted salmon-flavored cheese and tomatoes. A huge success for me and my wife, for whom I prepare breakfast in bed every morning,
She is an excellent cook, whereas my function is that of sous-chef and dishwasher.
