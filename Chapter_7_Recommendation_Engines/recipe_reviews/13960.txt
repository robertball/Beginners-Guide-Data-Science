Have made this several times and really enjoy it.  Good with fresh or canned green beans.  I skip the initial heating of oil and tomato paste step - I found it unnecessary - I simply whisk the oil and tomato paste together in a small bowl and add to the beans and stir - it blends better that way.  My husband is managing his diabetes with diet, herbs and exercise - green beans are one of the nonstarchy vegetables he can eat, consequently, this was a welcome addition to our diabetic recipe collection.

We found this recipe acceptable but next time I will use butter or crisp bacon in place of the oil which did not provide the necessary flavor punch.

This sounded odd when I was preparing it, howver, it was very flavorful and the only fat is in the vegetable oil.

I cut the oil in half.  This was so tastie!!!!  My husband even liked it and he hates onion.  He is quite picky actually and he loved it and asked for seconds.  I will definately make this recipe many more times.

This recipe has potential, but I had problems with the tomatoe paste/oil bit.  Couldn't get them to mix, so it just sat on top of the veggies.  Hmmm?

This was less like a stew and more like green beans with some heated tomatoe paste. I added some sauce and noodles and let it sit for a while but it still tasted rather bland. Maybe some fresh basil would do the trick but I wouldn;t make it again

This is delicious! I used a whole 6 oz. can of tomato paste, about 1/4 c. olive oil and about a lb. of fresh green beans with red and orange baby bell peppers and the onion. It took about 30 minutes of prep and another 45 minutes cooking, but it was worth it! The paste gives it a rich sweetness without adding my sugar!

What a GREAT recipe!!  I followed it step-by-step, adding a bit more tomato paste and 3X the liquid b/c I wanted a lot of sauce (for added flavor, I used chicken broth instead of water & olive oil instead of Canola)... it was phenomenal!  Quick, simple and full of delicious flavor, just the way I like my recipes.  Thank you for sharing this one.  I'm adding this to my permanent rotation of side dish recipes!

I had green bean stew at a middle eastern restaurant and thought it was delicious and healthy. I added beef cubes to the recipe and it was amazing.

This was just okay.  It was more of a side dish and a little bland for my family.  The good thing about it is that it took little to prep.

Green beans are so very good and this recipe just makes them better! I didn't have the heart to use green bell peppers for this so I used yellow ones. :) Nice veggy for any protein. Thank you LMiller.
