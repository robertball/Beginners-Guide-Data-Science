Previous reviewers' frustration with this recipe is probably the fault of a certain vagueness in the directions.

Dulce de leche is essentially a jelly based on milk instead of fruit juice; the liquid needs to be reduced to about half its original volume. It will foam up considerably when first reaching an active simmer, and again when the baking soda is added. After that, it will be relatively well-behaved for a while and the heat can be turned up, though constant stirring will still be needed to keep the bottom from burning. When it's nearly ready, it will suddenly get very foamy again (if you have a jelly/deepfry thermometer, this will be at about 220 F). After that, you can keep testing small samples on a chilled plate to see how much it stiffens up; if you evaporate it too far down, you may end up with something more like soft fudge-- still perfectly edible, but perhaps not what you had in mind.

I'm not sure why this recipe suggests chilling the dulce de leche *before* placing in jelly jars, which seems like an invitation for trouble of various kinds. For a start, it's much easier to scrape it out when it's still hot. One last cleanup note-- instead of tossing the sticky pot into the sink to soak off the caramel you couldn't scrape out, pour a bit of plain milk into it and gently reheat it on the stove while stirring. Hey presto: caramel-sweet

My daughter-in-law is from Argentina and taught me how to make this. She uses skim milk and splenda for half the sugar in the recipe. Instead of standing over the pot and stirring, she places a saucer upside down in the bottom of the pot. As the milk heats up, the saucer starts rocking and stirs the milk. She lets it simmer away without stirring for a few hours and it's delicious! Use it for a dipping sauce on bananas or any fruit, cake, ice cream. Unfortunately, it disappears by the spoonful eaten right from the storage jar!

I loved this recipe.  I actually made less by using 4 cups milk, 1 cup white sugar, 1/4 teaspoon baking soda and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract. It was done in 35 minutes. I had it on medium-high the entire time and ended up transferring it to a larger pan in the middle of it since it kept wanting to overflow. I did beat "vigorously" the entire time, my husband helped for a few minutes and it was done! At 20 minutes, it started turning slightly light brown and was heavier in consistency, I chose to leave it longer because I like it thick but you can probably turn it off as soon as it starts to get thick and brown if you want it runnier. I am argentinian and grew up on this so I'm thrilled to have this recipe. I made swedish pancakes that are so easy and put the dulce de leche inside...yummmmmmy!
For the swedish-like pancake recipe put everything in blender together:
3 eggs
2 cups milk
1 1/2 cup flour
3 Tbs sugar
2 Tbs oil
1 tsp salt
Blend completely in blender. Fry very thin in hot frying pan coated with oil. Turn once, they should be lightly brown on both sides.
Put a coat of dulde de leche and then roll them up. I like to add powdered sugar on top for presentation. Everyone will be impressed, these are delicious! Enjoy! (the swedish pancakes make about 24 pancakes, I cut this recipe in half to match the amount of dulce de leche made.

Great recipe for authentic dulce de leche! Be sure to use a wide, deep saucepan that will allow the milk to bubble and foam a bit. I kept the mixture at a steady simmer-almost-boil the whole time, and it was ready in about 45 minutes. Also, the recipe should note that the dulce de leche is ready when a spoon leaves a path in the bottom of the pan that disappears after a second or two. Any longer and the dulce de leche will be too stiff after it cools.

Sorry Juliana, this was a total waste of time, ingredients and money.  My son and I looked high and low for a recipe for his 6th grade spanish class project.  We worked on this for nearly four hours one night and it never turned into anything but hot, vanilla milk.  It never thickened even after we added tapioca (after three hours of total frustration).  We wasted an entire gallon of milk (whole, because nothing was specified), cheesecloth, and a costly vanilla bean.

Alright, for all the non-believers out there...I promise, this recipe really does work, and with a little time and a lot of patience, you WILL have beautiful, thick, caramel-y dulce de leche. 
I altered this recipe a tiny bit (I didn't use a whole gallon of milk, and  lessened the amounts of the rest of the ingredients accordingly. When I was about 30 minutes into the final stage (stirring, stirring, stirring), and still just had hot vanilla milk, I too was quite discouraged.  I tried playing around with the heat a little, and finally found that keeping it on high heat (it will constantly attempt to boil and foam over--just keep stirring) did the trick. After about 2 hours total (roughly an hour and a half of the final stirring stage), I couldn't believe my eyes when it FINALLY turned the promised golden brown, and thickened beautifully. All in all, the "milk jam" takes about 2 hours, more or less, of your time--and is well worth the wait. Stick it out! You won't regret it!

I tried this basic recipe and it came out great. I think that it's almost foolproof as long as you keep stirring the milk and making sure it does not overcook. I also only made the dulce de leche with 1 liter of milk (4 cups), 1 cup of sugar and a bit of vanilla extract. It took about 45 minutes from start to finish. I also added some chamille floewers (you can find them in the spices section) to give it something extra. By the way I also made a fat-free, sugar free version using non-fat milk and Splenda; although it's not as fullfilling as the original it still taste pretty darn good for those of use on a diet. Try it on some vanilla ice cream.

This recipie results in a good tasting product however, it takes an extrememly long time to make (for me it was 4 1/2 hours)but worth the effort to get the traditional flavour (as opposed to the sweetened condensed milk version).  This recipie made about 3 cups of dulce de leche.  Vanilla extract may be used in place of the vanilla bean.

This recipe is not easy to make.  (I needed 32 servings.  No mention of what a serving size is nor how long the overall preparation and cooking time is.  I stirred the mixture for over 1/2 hour at the last stage and NO thickening occurred.  It never did occur for the following 1/2 hour.

It sounds delicious, but I never got there.

Juliana,thank you,thank you!!!.
I'm assuming that you are argentine,but just in case,I'll write this in english,I really needed the recipe in U.S. standard measurements and you have saved my day!!.
This will help lots of argentine ladys cooking around the world.
To other ladies that don't know what "dulce de leche" is,I suggest them to give it a try!!,spread it over buttered toast and you'll see what I'm talking about!!.
Juliana,keep converting recipes!!!.

This was creamy and fantastic.  I've never had pure dulce de leche - only dulce de leche ice cream.  I had to make some modifications based upon what I had on hand.  I used 4 cups heavy cream, 4 cups skim milk, 2 tsp. vanilla extract, 2 1/4 C sugar, and 1/2 tsp. baking soda.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  It took exactly one hour of non-stop stirring with a whisk to reach a perfect amber color. The time passed quickly. I just chatted with my son while stirring.  I used a large Le Creuset pot on medium heat the entire time.  I had no sticking at all. We poured it over bananas but this stuff would even make cardboard taste good!

This was a fun recipe because it made me feel like I was doing a science project or something.  It's cool that all this happens just from milk!  I changed the recipe and just made it from 2 c. of milk and it probably reduced to a little over 1 c. of dulce just perfect for a middle layer on a cake.  I added vanilla extract after I took it off the heat.  I didn't think the ice bath was necessary b/c it made the dulce harden too fast.  Super yummy and easy.  Only took about 40 min.  I stirred occassionally in the beginning and then when it started to brown, I would stir and come back every min. or so.

This is a very good recipe. I'm from Uruguay, (wich is like almost Argentina) and I grew up with this, ok, probably I wouldn't make the whole gallon, but the proportion is 1 cup of sugar for every  1 litre of milk, and 1/4 tea spoon of baking soda. I use to omit the cloth and ice bath process and still works perfect.
and is soooo yummy! try-it as a filling for chocolate cake

This recipe works! It takes quite a lot of time but the end result is great dulce de leche, even better than store bought. I used only 1 liter of milk and scaled everything else down and I had to cook and stir it for about 40 minutes. This amount of milk made one jar of dulce de leche. The trick is to keep the heat high and just keep stirring (that will prevent the milk from boiling over). I didn't strain the milk because I didn't have a cheesecloth and it still worked out just fine. I'm already looking forward to make pancakes tomorrow - they are so good with dulce de leche. Thank you, Juliana!

I am from Cuba and the easiest way to make Dulce de Leche is to take a can of condensed milk and put it in a presure cooker cover it with water and cook it for 45 to an 1 hour ( unopened can ) or a big pot put the unopened can cover with water and boil for 2-3 hrs and  let coole and enjoy Yummy !!

Much easier way to make this recipe is just to pour a can of sweetened condensed milk into a canning jar with a lid, no other ingredients, then set the jar in a simmering pot of water for 2-2 1/2 hours.  Just make sure the water level stays at least where the milk level in the jar is.  Yummy!

YUMMY!!!  i am from a small island in the medittearanean sea and i have never tasted Dulce de leche but when i tried this recipe it tasted amazing. I found it very easy to make. The steps are very simple and clear and if you have a bit of patience it is worth it.I didnt need such a big quantity so i took the advise of other reviewers and decreased the amount to 4 cups of milk, 1 cup sugar, 1 tsp of vanila essense and 1/4 tsp baking soda. It took me about one hour and fifteen minutes of constant stiring and it was worth it. i served it as a sauce on top of chocolate cake and everybody loved it. Thank you very much!!

Amazing!  I made this as a special treat for my Argentinian exchange student's 16th birthday.  She said it was just like at home!  Used it as filling for a layer cake and the rest as a dip for fruit or spread on toast.  (Ate a fair amount by the spoonful.)  Yes, a little time intensive, but well worth it for a special occasion.  I'll make this again at Christmas and give in small jars as gifts.

I made this on a whim this morning and it's wonderful - however, the original directions are a bit vague.  The suggestion of one reviewer to place a saucer upside down in the pot was fabulous - I didn't have to stand there and it turned out perfectly.  I did reduce the proportions to 1/4 of the recipe and it's perfect to fill a layer cake.  However, there will not be extra to pick in, and that's a shame!

Great recipe! After a long time of stirring i was about to become frustrated because it wasn't thickening, but I kept my patience. I turned the heat up a little bit and I just kept stirring! I think stirring is the key! I also substituted the bean for vanilla extract. It worked out just as well. We were very pleased with the results!

this is a great recipe for REAL manjar or dulce de leche, you can also make it by boiling an unopened can of condensed milk (be careful as it can explode if left unattended and the water evaporates) but this recipe is the more elaborate one for dulce de leche.

I followed the measurements and proportions from previous reviewer vane, as I didn't have a full gallon of milk to spare, and this worked perfectly. Instead of watching the clock, I periodically checked the temperature of the mixture as I stirred and it boiled. When it was more difficult to keep my candy thermometer from accidentally touching the bottom of the pan, I knew I was getting somewhere. The mixture started to thicken and get frothy right around 200 degrees and from there I just watched and stirred every 15-30 seconds as it thickened and darkened in caramel color. I'm so glad this worked!

This is really delicious! Wont be making this often because it is frustrating and time consuming. Very yummy though.

I made this DAIRY FREE (w/ homemade almond milk) and it was wonderful!   Haven't had real dulce de leche in a long time, so I don't know how authentic it was, but I LOVED it!   I cut the recipe waaaaay down, and used a splash of vanilla extract, but otherwise followed the directions. It took about 45 minutes of stirring for me. I'm so excited to make this again, to top my incredible pumpkin cheesecake!

I followed the recipe exactly and this came out great.  It would have to be a very special occasion for me to make this again.  I stirred for over 3 hours.

This recipe is fantastic.  Like other reviewers, I kept it on high for most of the time, stirring fairly continuously.  The mixture will slowly thicken and darken, until it is about half of the original volume.  The only problem I encountered was in the last 5 minutes or so, when little bits began to burn at the bottom, no matter how fast I stirred... (but they are just harder caramel, so still yummy!)  I used vanilla extract, 2% milk, and the whole process took less than an hour. Enjoy!

I am going to try this because I've looked for it with no luck and need this for a Sweet Potato recipe. I'm sure it will be fine. Thanks a lot for having the recipe in your possession.What a lifesaver you are.

Modifications are necessary as stated in other reviews to create a perfect dulce de leche.  I made a lighter and smaller version of this recipe.  I used 4 cups of nonfat Lactaid milk, 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract, a little under 1 cup of sugar, and 1/4 of a teaspoon of baking soda.  At first, I was skeptical like some of the reviewers that I would ever get dulce de leche out of this mixture and would just end up with hot milk.  I figured that by using nonfat milk, I had altered the recipe too much.  However, once I followed the suggestions of others and raised the heat higher than medium after adding the baking soda, the mixture began to turn into dulce de leche.  In order for this recipe to work, you must use a higher heat during the last cooking phase and not medium like this recipe states.  To avoid burning the mixture, you will need to stir it constantly.  Nonfat milk and Lactaid milk (for those who are lactose intolerant) definitely works so if you are looking for a lighter option, you can absolutely make that substitution.

Boy, did I make a mess with this!  My attempt got hard and unwieldy very quickly.  I cannot blame it on the recipe, however.  Must be the cook!  I was chipping dulce de leche off everthing in sight!

I followed the recipe to a T and ended up with warm, sweet, vanilla milk.  I had to scrap the entire batch.  I tried the recipe twice and neither time did it work, even with the suggestions from other users.

I had some milk that needed to use up and this fit the bill; I was so glad to see a dulce de leche recipe that didn't call for sweetened condensed milk. I cut this down to 8 servings which is about the size of a small container of mayo. I did use half brown and white sugar, and a generous splash of vanilla. This will be awesome with the flan I have planned for tomorrow.

Wow! I cannot believe I actually made real dulce de leche! So tasty and quite easy too, thanks to Marilyn's advice to put a saucer on the bottom of the pot - almost no stirring was needed.

I had great success making this recipe.  I did cut it into 1/4.  I used skim milk and a deep heavy pan.  I cooked it at a rolling boil stirring vigorously.  It was very thick when it was done and would be delicious even thinner on cake or sweet bread.  I will just have to take it off sooner.  I did eliminate the ice bath and it set up just fine.  I took about 1/2 and hour from start to finish.

I just finished this recipe, and it is AMAZING!! I am a caramel FREAK (Yes, I know Dulce isn't the same, but it may as well be to my taste buds!), and this is my first time trying to make anything like this.  I followed the previous reviewer's variation: 4 Cups 2% milk, 1 Cup sugar, 1/4 tsp vanilla extract, and 1/4 tsp baking soda.  I didn't have a problem with the sugar caramelizing over medium heat... I'm thinking it is probably because I have 'gormet' copper bottomed stainless steel pots.  The whole process only took me an hour from measuring my milk to ending up with my dulce de leche topping for the cheesecake that's in my oven.  Tastes awesome!!!

Delicious...on EVERYTHING! If you are a sweet toothe that is. A simple recipe to follow, my only suggestion is to TURN UP THE HEAT! 45 minutes of stirring, on Med., with no results. 15 minutes on the precarious verge of boiling? Dulce de leche. Thanks for this tasty treat!

The recipe is heavenly!! I just finished making it. Yes, it takes some time and a lot of stirring but it's soooooo worth it! I halved the recipe because I wasn't sure how it would turn out. Next time, I will make the full amount! It reduces down to probably less than 1/4 of what you started with! Trust me, you will want more!! I am so happy you shared this! Thanks!

This is a superb recipe. I have been using it for 10 years. Start by making it with 1 quart (4 c.) of milk as a test. It requires A LOT of patience. If you don't have time or patience, boil a can of sweetened condensed milk. Straining through the cheesecloth is not required but creates a lovely smooth result. I use vanilla extract instead of the bean.

VERY VERY SWEET! But it took over 5 HOURS! I mean it is delicious but it really was VERY time consuming. There had to be an easier way to do this! Try other websites for less vague directons. I was stirring for over 5 hours!

this is a good recipe. when they say large saucepan,they mean at least a 12 qt pot.  I used an 8qt and It still boiled over.  and at a higher altitude (Denver), it took almost 2 hours tp reach the right consistency.   I haven't decided if it's worth making again.

Thank you soooooo much for this recipe!!! is just perfect. I didn't have vanilla bean so I just used vanilla concentrate. 
I cooked on medium high heat and it didn't stick on the bottom. I mixed continually at the beginning until the milk did not bubble any more , after that I just stir here and there.

I saw that some one spent a lot of time and money on this recipe and said it didn't work.  I make this recipe and it took AGES because I used very low heat - almost 6 hours or so.  I have since made it using higher heat and it did not take as long.   If you are using very low heat, it WILL work, but it will take a while.  Try making 1/2 the recipe to see if you like it - or even 1/4 recipe.

Thank you for the wonderful recipe. I had a ton of fun making this! I halved the recipe and it took about 45 minutes just over medium. I think I may have over-stirred the mixture though because it had a lot of little bubbles in it. It didn't affect the taste though! Thanks again

I first made dulce de leche in high school as a Spanish 3 project. We were told to use 2cups sugar and one cup milk as the ratio and plan on spending the evening stirring the pot and reading our English book for the week. I've mad it ever since as it is indeed addictive. It does take 2-3 hours from start to finish but is worth it. I bought various brands while in Spain on vacation and they did differ slightly. I'm going to have to try this with the baking soda and see if its any different. It makes a wonderful gift for anyone with a sweet tooth. Also wonderful added to hot apple cider.

mine turned out very clumpy.  perhaps, as my argentine wife warned, i had to stir constantly, which i didn't.  she did say that this is one of those things more worth just buying than making as the milk ('artisinal' milk i bought from a local farm at nearly $5 a quart) was pricey, and the work was long.   i didnt stir enough, my bad.  i guess the argentines have even learned that its easier to buy than to make unless you've very dedicated for 3+ hours.    i will say that i had goat's milk d.d.l. in the north of argentina that was very good (gamey of course).  so you might try this as its slightly different, and something you cannot just buy in the states.

This makes a really delicious caramel sauce, good on ice cream and apples among other things.

As other people have said, this takes a long time to make (4+ hours). However, if you're cooking the milk slowly enough you don't have to watch over it so carefully, especially in the later stages. I left it alone for an hour without stirring and it didn't burn.

You have to watch over it initially since the milk will foam up. Make sure you use a large enough pot.

My arm is about to fall off. It has been way longer than an hour of cooking. It’s now been 3 1/2 hours. the voluom has lowered about 1 1/2in but still not thick. I am still going to try and finish this, but if I knew that it would take this long I would have never started it.
