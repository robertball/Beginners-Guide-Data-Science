I doubled this recipe because I needed a lot of it.  I put it in a 9x13 pan and used two boxes or 24 candy canes crushed up.  I also added a 1/4 tsp more of the extract and used a few drops of red food coloring adding one drop add a time.  After adding each drop I stirred it just enough to give it a swirling effect.  Without the red food coloring it was a pale yellow/cream color which I thought was unappetizing.  I cooled it in the fridge then cut it into 1 inch squares.  I brought a plate of it to a holiday party and the hostess was kind of upset that all of my candy was eaten and her fancy sweets from the bakery were leftover.  This is a GREAT recipe.

This is so easy and tastes great also!!  I made this one time, and have had 5 people ask for the recipe!  Cut the recipe in half, use a round cake pan, using the empty can of condensed milk in the middle put the fudge around the can and you can make a wreath and decorate it.  So easy and beautiful.

Everyone loved this fudge!  Instead of just mixing in the food coloring I did a swirl effect right before putting it in the refrigerator.

This is my second year making this recipe and I will probably make it every year from now on.  Everyone who's tasted it raves about it, even my 3 kids who don't care all that much for peppermint.  A few trial and error tips:  Last year I added the red food coloring and the fudge came out pink.. I wasn't really pleased with that.  This year I left out the food coloring altogether and I think it's much prettier this way.  Also, there is no need for the added fat of "greasing" the foil.  Use Glad's Press and Seal Wrap (make sure you refrigerate for the full 2 hours!) and it peels right off with no sticking.  Also, make sure you use candy canes that are easy to crush.  If the chunks are too big the fudge won't cut easily.  Last year I used the individually wrapped, round peppermints but I thought it was better this year using regular, cheapo candy canes.  I put a tin of this in all of my Christmas packages this year, it's a nice change from the traditional chocolate with nuts fudge that everyone else makes.  Now somebody please stop me before I go eat it all!

This was a huge hit at work!  I used white choco chips instead of vanilla chips.

This is really great candy. I don't know if I could classify it as fudge- because it is the texture of a chocolate bar. The flavor is great. I only used 1 cup of crushed candy canes. I added about 2 tsp. of peppermint extract though so that you could actually taste the mint. I colored it red- and thought it to be a bit of an eyesore. I didn't have any extra candy canes to crush and sprinkle on, but that would've made it look great. Instead, I had some green mint chips. I melted them in the microwave, and spread them over the fudge. It was green and red layered- it really added a lot to the presentation. I will try this with milk chocolate too. Thanks.

Made this for Christmas party & everyone LOVED it! It took 25 (+ or -) candy canes to get 1 1/2 c.; I put them inside a large ziplock bag before crushing them with a hammer (helpful hint :)).  Very tasty & sooo easy!!

This one was a hit at my house.  I only had 1 cup of crushed candy canes on hand, and it turned out great (12 candy canes = 1 cup crushed).  I almost think that 1-1/2 cups might have been too much.  My husband took a bunch to work and they were gobbled up quickly!

My husband helped me make this fudge--that's how eager he was to try it!  It was worth his effort.  I didn't add the food coloring, because I wanted white fudge.  I also sprinkled an extra cup of candy canes over the top (for extra good looks), which resulted in too much peppermint.  Next time, I'll just mix in 1/2 the candy cane amount into the fudge and reserve the rest for the top.  Great, easy recipe that is a perfect addition to cookie plates.

Wow - can I just say this is the PERFECT holiday recipe?!  Its beautiful, colorful, easy to make, doubles as a gift, and tastes amazing.  I followed the recipe the first time exactly as follows (with red food coloring) and it turned out wonderfully.   **One tip I found to be helpful: Spread the liquid fudge into the pan before adding the food coloring, then add in only a couple of drops in different spots and swirl the color gently with a spoon. The fudge will cool quickly but this prevents the fudge from turning all pink and gives it a gorgeous red and white swirl, similar to a real candy cane.  I am about to make another batch right now and will be giving as gifts to my coworkers this year.  Happy Holidays and thanks for this recipe!

Oh this was yummy! It was a soft fudge, so I might experiment with changing some things to chane the texture a little more. The crunch of the candy canes made a nice partner to the soft texture of the fudge and poingent peppermint taste!

Not what I expected... Not really a "fudge" texture or consistency. After reading the reviews, I noticed that one member described the texture as "fondant" like. This is a very good description. The taste is okay, maybe a little more extract? I enjoyed trying a new recipe. Thanks for sharing.

Oh, god. Is this GOOD! I used half vanilla and half white chocolate. It's nice and creamy without being overpoweringly sweet. I have to hurry up and package this up before I gain another five pounds! (This reminds me of the Candy Cane Kisses only with more peppermint flavor.)

I followed this recipe just as written except I did not add the food coloring....I don't think this candy needs it, it is SOOO pretty on it's own. I added the crushed candy cane to the mixture and then after pouring it into the prepared pan, I very gentley patted some crushed candy cane on top of the fudge. I posted a picture and I think the fudge looks pretty without the food coloring. Thank you for a wonderful and easy recipe.

Yum, Yum and more YUM!!   Oh my goodness I just love this fudge.  It may be to do with the fact that I am a huge white chocolate fan.  I followed this very easy recipe exactly.  I did make in a small muffin tin to get individual portions of heaven! Only gave the food colouring a quick swirl so that it gave a marbled finish.  These little goodies are being stored in the freezer until Christmas, placed in an airtight freezer container, seperated by wax paper.

Wow, this was awesome!  I made it per the recipe, and wouldn't change a thing next time.  I, too, lined the pan with Press'n Seal, then refrigerated.  Easy removal!  I didn't add the food coloring until it was all in the pan, and I added a drop here and there, and swirled it.  Was beautiful!  Thanks for the recipe!

This candy cane fudge is soooo good!!!  I made it for a Christmas party because it was fast and easy.  I have had 5 people ask me for the recipe!  I used the Herseys vanilla chips...I think they have the best flavor.

I substituted white almond bark for the vanilla chips since that is what I had on hand. I used candy canes that I bought on sale after Christmas and chopped them in my food chopper until 1/2 were like powder and the other half were small chips before adding to the mixture. It was a big hit with everyone.

This recipe is great as is.  I added extra peppermint extract as suggested by another reviewer and it was too overpowering.  Stick with the original recipe.  Super easy!!

I like how soft and creamy this recipe is. Let it set as long as possible before you handle it because it is sticky if you cut it too soon. I have made this twice. The first time, I swirled green and red food coloring on top and the second time I used only red, which is much prettier. I use white chocolate chips as I have never seen vanilla baking chips anywhere. A tip: It's much easier to crush the round peppermint candies - they break into nice large bits rather than the mostly fine dust you end up with when trying to crush candy canes.

Used this for a cookie/treat exchange & won Best Taste.  I only found 12oz. pkgs of vanilla chips and left about 1/2 cup (4oz.) or so out to try to equal the 10oz. pkgs. Also, I did not use the food coloring because mine turned pinkish from the candy canes. I pressed some slightly crushed candy cane on top & added some green sugar sprinkles on top too.  My picture of how my candy looked is in the photos above on the plate with the holly picture on it. And I only gave it 4, because I like peppermint not love it.

This is a wonderful fudge, I did change a couple of things myself but that's the wonderful thing about being the cook is that you CAN change something on the recipe if you don't like it.  I used two tsps of peppermint, it's not as over powering as you would think it is and cut back on the candy canes for older people that can't really chew it. It was such a beautiful fudge that after we were done making it, we used it to help my grandpa propose to his sweetheart we put it in the fake ring box and stuck the fake ring in there with the beautiful red food coloring and the pretty ring it left her breathless

This is great!  It is a little softer than regular fudge and maybe a little sticky, but definitely delicious!  I used vanilla candy melts for this and increased the peppermint extract by about half.  I put one cup of the candy canes in the fudge and reserved 1/2 cup for the top.  I spread the fudge in a pan I had lined with non-stick foil (which worked great) and then put drops of red food coloring randomly on top.  Swirled with a spoon and added my reserved candy canes, patting them down lightly so they’d stay put.  Great recipe and pretty too!

Don't expect this to come out like fudge because it's not fudge.  The taste was okay.  I was disappointed.

I love this recipe!  I made it a few years ago & was looking for it on here & was so happy to find it again!  This time I saved it to my recipe box.  One thing I love is that the longer it is in the refrigerator the better it tastes!  After about 3 or 4 days the candy canes start to get soft & it is sooo good.  This year I made these with the swirl affect on top, it looked soooo cute!  I also had these mini chocolate molded snowman that I made with a mold & put them on top when it was still warm so it would stick together.  They look so nice as gifts!  Thanks TINAMARIE11

I just wanted to point out if you're in a pinch financially (like me) and need a baked goods item that yields a lot for a very small price to give as Christmas gifts, this recipe is for YOU!  I made tons of it last year and bought little decorative boxes to gift them in -- The boxes were more expensive than the ingredients!  I made it exactly as the recipe states and had no trouble.  It is VERY rich and filling to eat.  It's versatile enough that you can add more or less peppermint depending on your personal preferences. I also made half of the pan swirled with red food coloring and the other half swirled with green, looked so cute!  I'm definitely going to make it again this year, and was even requested to do so!

super easy, and wonderful. Just wished I would have bought more candy canes for the summer, so I could make this as a summer treat! Also works well using the candy cane chips when they come out during the holiday season.

So simple and looks so pretty, too. I crushed 8 oz. of candy canes to come up with the amount needed for the recipe.  The hardest part of this whole thing was peeling the cellophane off the candy!

The taste of this 'fudge' was ok, the texture was so dry and crumbly that I would not serve it at the party I planned on bringing it to.  I would highly recommend NOT using Ghiradelli  classic WHITE chips for this particular recipe.  I think that is the reason for the dryness of this fudge, (for me).  Fudge should be creamy and kind of melt in your mouth, not dry and crumbly.

Favorite new recipe I tried this Christmas!  Absolutely picture perfect (I dripped a bit of gel colorant & swirled as others recommended) and surprisingly delicious as well!  I love the little crunchy bits, but my husband liked when the candies got a little softer with a bit of time. Time? Bah! Good from the start!

This is so good. The cool taste of peppermint is great after all the heavy holiday meals. I dipped a butter knife in red food coloring and swirled it through the candy to get the swirl effect, otherwise it turns out pink.

I used dark chocolate chips.  I also put Hershey's candy cane kisses on top while the mixture was still warm, then cut the fudge between the rows of kisses.  Another time, I sprinkled the crushed candy canes on top, but didn't mix them into the fudge--I liked this better than mixing the canes into the fudge.  Crushed canes can have sharp edges, and I scraped the roof of my mouth with a larger cane piece when I had them mixed into the fudge.

This was a big hit at my church's Christmas party! People kept asking me for the recipe. I did follow previous advice and used white chocolate chips instead of the vanilla baking chips though.

The mixture gets stiff quickly so if you are going to add the food coloring at the end you had better pay close attention.

This recipe is very simple, yet very decadent. The smell of the fudge reminds me of those tiny pastel colored non-parels that come in a bag around xmas. I used wax paper instead of the tin foil. I also used 1 full teaspoon of peppermint extract(instead of 1/2 teaspoon). I did not use the food coloring, but I did crush up 2 xtra candy canes to sprinkle on top of the fudge. I also used 4 candy canes crushed up to put in the fudge.
Totally unique recipe! I love it!

This was just ok. I really wanted to like this recipe. But the sweetened condense milk was too overpowering. I bake at every work function and the recipes are always requested. This one was not requested and was not finished. I threw half of it away. On a positive note it was pretty to look at it.

I decided to make this after seeing it featured in the daily recipes yesterday, and I am glad I did!  This is a wonderful candy for the holidays.  The flavor is like those after dinner butter mints that you can buy.  I made this with 2 exceptions to the recipe.   I only used about 2/3 cup of crushed candy cane in the candy and I used only 3 dots of the food coloring on top and swirled it in with a knife then added an additional tbsp of crush candy and a sprinkle of green colored sugar on top.   It was so easy and quick to make that it's a great last minute recipe when you just need one more thing to have on the dessert table or to give to friends.

Soo easy!! I didn't realize until making it that I had bought mint extract instead of peppermint (not sure if there is a difference)but it turned out great. I added only 3/4 cup of crushed candy canes.... I don't think I would like that much crunch in my fudge. I did add just a few green sprinkles and some remaining crushed candy cane to top it off and it looks picture perfect. Hint: I used mini candy canes...so much easier than peeling 13!!

Excellant and easy recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly except for using white chocolate chips instead of vanilla and it came out great.  The candy canes create a nice crunch.

This is an absolutely easy and scrumptious treat! I don't have access to Peppermint extract so I just used extra candy canes and vanilla extract for the proper consistency. I also use white chocolate chips b/c we don't have vanilla at our store here in Europe. It is phenominal anyway and everyone asks for the recipe. You can't go wrong! It also ships well in the mail, I sent some to our families in the USA for Christmas and to deployed soldiers in Iraq. They all loved it!

I made this near the holidays for my coworkers. It was very easy to make, except for crushing the candy canes. I skipped the food coloring, because the candycanes were pretty enough. This made some SUPER sweet fudge, and I couldn't eat more than one piece because of that. But, everyone else finished it off!

Excellent!  Used one package of 12 large/regular candy canes to make 1 batch and saved out a few crushed pieces to sprinkle on the top after swirling about 4 drops of food coloring (did not stir in).  I think the peppermint flavor is just right as is.  Tastes delicious!!!  Yum!  Will definitely make again.  Can't wait to share with my family!

This is pretty good! I made it this morning for the first time. I used white chocolate chips instead of vanilla, and didn't end up using the peppermint extract as I was sure I had some and didn't.. The response was great! People really enjoyed the mild peppermint flavor of the peppermint twilrlies!

I used vanilla flavored almond bark instead of vanilla baking chips, because there weren't any vanilla baking chips in the store. It still came out good! I will use more peppermint extract the next time I make this and try it with the vanilla baking chips. The fudge has a similar taste to candy cane hershey kisses.

I made this last year right after Thanksgiving and it didn't last until Christmas. This year I am making several batches and giving some as gifts to people who enjoyed it last year. The mint is not overpowering and the fudge is nice and creamy in texture.

Also, a tip: if you don't feel like crushing the candy canes yourself AC Moore has candy cane mix ins already crushed and ready to go. Great time saver!

The recipe was easy to follow and it came out well.  I thought it was too sweet and my husband thought it was too minty.  I brought it to two holiday parties and it did not go well.  It was fun to try but I don't think I will make it again.

this was very easy to make. the hardest part was crushing all the candy canes. it took about 1 box of the dozen candy canes to give the right amount. warning this is extremely sweet but that is pretty much to be expected based off the ingredients.

I don't know what went wrong but it never seemed to set up.  Still very gooey and could not make squares out of it.

I have been making this recipe for about 10 years now. I have never seen it published. This fudge is one of my favorites and all my friends and family look forwad to it every year... even the one that don't like candy canes!

My kids like this, but hubby & I think it'd taste much better using regular semi-sweet chips.  That's what I'll try with next year's leftover candy canes!

Eccelent!  If you drop some food coloring on top after you have colored the fudge and swirl it around with a knife it looks like marble. Yummy!

Super easy and delicious!! I'm new to making fudge and this recipe made it seem as though I'd been making it for years. We took it to a Christmas party and received compliments from everyone, including a call two days later.
I did not use any extract and simply ground some of the candy cane pieces into tiny bits (almost dust) to mix into the batter. I saved slightly larger pieces for the top.

It is a tasty fudge. But I made it last year and the 1st batch didn't set as "fudge" your recipe calls for too much condensed milk.  It should only need one can which here is 8 ounz.  Last year I did it your way and it was too wet and sticky and wouldn't set. Then I redid it and with less condensed milk and it was more like a fudge. This year I forgot about the the way I did it properly and followed your recipe again and once again 14 ounz of condensed milk is way too much. Basically a waste :(

I mad this as a Christmas gift for my work colleagues, and while it was too sweet for me, they loved it!  My son has been sneaking pieces every time I turn my back.

I melted the chips and condensed milk in the microwave instead of in a saucepan...much easier!  It is a very thick mixtue and does begin to thicken even more very quickly, so I also stuck it back in the microwave for a few seconds to loosen it up and get it into the pan.  I'll be making it again!!  3 batches in and still getting requests...

Easy and delightful recipe!  I used 18 normal-sized candy canes - 12 crushed and mixed into the chocolate/condensed milk, and 6 crushed and sprinkled on top.  Doubled the mint extract because I wanted it extra minty; a few drops of red food coloring and it's peppermint candy pink!  So cute and festive!  Only problem I had with the recipe was the instruction to melt over medium heat - I assumed the condensed milk would keep the chocolate from burning, but it didn't.  The candy doesn't taste burnt at all, but there are little brown flecks in it.  Please use a double boiler to melt the chocolate!

I wish I could give this a 10 star rating for presentation. It was beautiful and so festive. Everyone was excited and intrigued. I only used red food coloring, and it was really, super pretty. Everyone who tasted it also really liked the flavor. The change I would make would be to make sure the candy canes are totally crushed- biting into a piece of candy cane sort of spoils the experience. I crushed mine pretty good, but next time will crush completely. Great recipe.

Oh YUM! This was absolutely FANTASTIC!!! I needed a homemade gift for our groomer, but didn't have much time to prepare an elaborate one. I've had this recipe filed away in my "maybe" folder for quite some time and decided this year was THE year to give it a try! :) I did make a couple of (minor) changes but am sure this would have been delicious as is. As many others did, I also gently folded the food coloring into my fudge. I think I swirled it a *tad* too much tho, because my fudge was ever so slightly pinkish in color (but that was fine by me). I only used 1 c. of crushed candy canes in the actual fudge itself and reserved the remaining 1/2 c. for the top. My final change was to drizzle some melted Andes mint chips over everything PRIOR to placing in the fridge to "set." A holiday themed Wilton box tied with festive ribbon sealed the deal! Thanks SO much for sharing your recipe, Tina Marie! This will be added to my holiday cookie trays for years to come. :-)

Tastes very good, but I stored my fudge in a cool dark place, and the candy canes that were not pulverized seemed to run and make the fudge gooey.  Again it tasted great and everyone loved it but the presentation was not the best.

This was wonderful.  I added a little more peppermint extract to make it more flavorful.  I also swirled red dye in it as mentioned.  This was a very popular Christmas treat.  It will be a party staple from now on!

I have to say, everyone thought this recipe was amazing, the only thing I would change is to VERY FINELY chop up the candy cane so the fudge is not crunchy. I also would put the food coloring in at the very end so you get the swirl effect. Also, I have never seen vanilla chips so I used white chocolate and it was great -- I would definitely make this again for the holidays, it was a lot of fun. Oh, and I would like to try adding more peppermint extract next time for a little more peppermint flavor!

It was a simple recipe and made for a good Christmas party treat.  It was a little chewy, where I expected more of a thick fudge like texture.  I only used 1 cup of candy canes (because thats all I had, I didnt realize 3/4 of a box of mini canes would make so little) but it was plenty.  Out of that 1 cup I saved a little bit to layer the top with and I am glad that I did.  I took the advice of others on here and didnt add the food coloring until I put it in the pan, then I dropped it in small drops and swirled it.  I liked the look of that better then it being all pink.  Other then that it was a pretty good recipe and makes a really good addition to a cookie platter for a holiday get together.  My only advice is cut the squares pretty small, it is a very rich sweet.

I changed two things...I added another 1/2 tsp. of peppermint extract and I used white chocolate chips because I've never heard of nor could I find vanilla chips! I personally don't like white chocolate so this wasn't a big hit for me, but others loved it!

I'm not a big fan of vanilla. With that said, I found this fudge to be lacking regular fudge consistency and it really just tasted like melted vanilla chips and peppermint.

I made this fudge using one package of milk chocolate chips and one package of a combination of dark chocolate and mint chips.  I still added a little peppermint extract too.  It turned out pretty well and people seemed to enjoy it.  The hardest part was smashing the candy canes - I used 24 regular sized candy canes and tried to smash them in a plastic bag with a rolling pin.  Definitely didn't work very well because I was left with large-ish chunks.  Next time I may try the food processor.

Very festive looking and simple recipe. You definitely need to like peppermint to be able to enjoy this though. I cut the amount of peppermint extract down and it still came out pretty strong, but it is good in small bites!

I guess I'm a chocolate fudge purist so this recipe didn't do much for me. The texture is firm and it sure is pretty on the plate.

I was very unsure of it when I seen the ingredients, but I thought I would give it a try since other users said it was good.  I should have went with my first impression of it.  BAD!  Way to sweet and nothing to it.

Good.  Like somebody else said, it's not exactly fudge.  But it was good.  I used a little blue food coloring barely stirred in.  It contrasted with the red/white candy canes for a summer effect.

Was extremely easy to make The end result was pretty and festive looking Hardly any was eaten at my party maybe one tenth of the "wreath" I love sugar but I didnt love this fudge was a little over whelming in taste and sweetness and this from a person who likes to lick the frosting beaters. My husband took the rest to work and he said everybody there loved it and was all gone in 15 minutes but he might have just said that to be nice to me..... But was very pretty  I put half of the crushed peppermint called for on top for decoration four stars for ease of making how it looks and for the story my husband is telling

Great, easy recipe. I made this as an alternative to chocolate treats. I used 2 bags of nestle white chocolate chips and about 20 candycanes. I did not add food coloring because it is a beatiful pink/white color on its own. I sprinkled red and green sprinkles over the top and some extra candycane bits for decoration.

I tried this after reading all of the good reviews.  I followed it exactly and I wasn't very impressed because I'm not real fond of white chocolate(just my personal preference I guess.)  And the candy cane mixed in made it pretty hard. The second time I made it I split the condensed milk in half and in two separate pans I made half with 10 oz of white chocolate and the other half with 10 oz of milk chocolate chips (with 1/2 tsp of peppermint extract in each.  I followed one of the reviewers suggestions of putting several "dots" of food coloring in and only mixing 2-3 times (just enough to swirl.) I then unevenly poured the white chocolate in a saran wrap lined casserole dish and then unevenly poured the chocolate over and around the white chocolate.  I swirled a little and spread the fudge evenly.  I sprinkled the crushed candy cane on top.  It was so good!! The mixture of the milk chocolate and the fudge was perfect for my taste (the white fudge only was too much for me and I could taste the condensed milk a little) Though it kinda gets on my nerves when people review recipes only to have changed them completely, I had to post this.  I will see what my friends think of it tomorrow.

This is a fantastic recipe, especially if your not especially great at making fudge ^_^. When I made it, I left out the food coloring, and it was just fine. Also, make sure you crush the candy canes really well- otherwise you end up with large candy cane chunks that are annoying to try and chew.

I really like this recipe! It is just thr right amount of sweetness and mint - my kids absolutely love it! Another thing I loved that it is super easy to make. I am a beginner and this recipe is very simple, which is great. Will definitely continue to make this one!

I was somewhat skeptical, but this was very nice!  My teenage (boy) cousins loved it and went out of their way to tell me so (which was impressive, I thought). Unfortunately, I wasn't able to achieve the pretty swirls, but some extra crushed candy saved the day.

I took these to a cookie exchange and everyone enjoyed them. They taste great. I would definitely swirl the food coloring in next time so mine would look more like the photo. I just added it in and it just made "pink fudge". Tasted great, looked so/so.

Well it was not what I expected at all! Maybe without the candy canes it would be better, it was way too hard to chew! I'll give it a go around without the crushed candy canes...

I love this recipe, although I would not call it fudge! The taste is fabulous, I love the candy canes mixed with white chocolate!
I do have one suggestion though, I would use a bigger pan than the 8x8, cause this stuff was so thick. I had everyone cutting their pieces in half. But it was gone in no time.
Thanks for a delicious recipe!!

I actually enjoyed this fudge. I tried it for its uniqueness and because my hubby likes candy canes. We loved it. I dont particularly care for white chocolate but this was great. I didnt add any food coloring as I really liked the look without it. Thanks for sharing. I'm going to try this with semi sweet choc. chips too.

I rated this recipe at five stars  because I didn't want to negatively affect the rating, but I didn't follow the recipe exactly. Definately do NOT use dark chocolate chips instead of the vanilla.  I did and it turned into a big, crumbly blob of greasy looking chocolate with bits of candy cane. So if that sounds good, follow my lead, but I won't be making it that way again. I imagine the original recipe is significantly better.

Yummy and Easy!!!! Great recipe. I followed the suggestion of using less candy canes and think somewhere between 3/4 and a cup works great. My other substitution is using white chocolate chips instead of vanilla (I had those on hand).

Can't wait to bring this fudge to a neighborhood cookie exchange!!!

Very easy recipe and it will make a nice filler on my Christmas trays.  I microwaved the chips and milk for 1 minute on high, stirred, and then 25 seconds at a time on high until all the chips were melted.  I then stirred in the extract and candy canes.  Cut the pieces small as this is really rich.

Fantastic recipe! It is going to become a holiday staple...the best part is that the recipe is so easy that I can just jot it down for people when they ask for it.  I used white Baker's chocolate because I couldn't find vanilla baking chips and left out the food coloring...I thought that the color might not be as good, but they looked as good as they tasted (delicious).  Enjoy

Easy recipe to use. First time actually making fudge that was not like taffy.  I used the mini candy canes (about 50 of them) and crushed them in a plastic bag.  I put a drop of food coloring in the middle of the 8x8 pan and then in each of the 4 quadrants and swirled.  Very yummy and not over powering for peppermint. I will make again.

Made this for my mom's Christmas party at work and she said it was a HUGE hit!! It was super easy and only tweaked it a bit. I used the soft, ball shaped peppermints and crushed them and put them in the mixture and on top before cooling them! They were soo good! I definitely will be making these from now on!!

Wasn't as good as I thought it would be. When I put it into the pan, the oil started seeping to the top. It leaves a pretty good aftertaste, I might try it again. It's texture wasn't quite like the chocolate fudge I make sometimes.

I liked it...it wasn't bad. I would have liked it more if I had had enough candy canes but unfortunately realized at the end I was about a half cup short. Was good anyway though.

We liked this and used the recipe for both work and friend holiday parties.  We didn't bring any home.  I made a mistake once of putting in regular chocolate chips and I got most of them out of the pot but not enough.  Please use the white chips.  Otherwise it looks like Candy Cane poop.  Will look forward to making this at next year's holiday party!

Warning: Candy cane / mint fans only! But if you love these, you will not be able to stop eating this rich, creamy fudge! It has a great deal of depth of flavor, not just the mint flavor - but some vanilla too! I adore this fudge. This year, I used red/green striped candy canes for a beautiful effect! The hardest part of this recipe by far is prepping the candy canes, but it's worth it! I used it for gifts (with three other types of fudge and other goodies) and heartily recommend!

This recipe worked out great! I could have crushed my peppermints better, but that was my fault. I didn't use the peppermint extract, I'm not a huge peppermint fan and this still turned out well! Perfect amount of peppermint and white chocolate! I'll be making this again!

I made this earlier in the week. After it sat in the fridge for the specified amount of time, my husband and I tried it and thought it was "okay". Now it's 4-5 days later and it has been in the fridge all week. I sat some out today because we had company coming. Now that the flavors have melded together, it is great......the texture is just like fudge should be and the candy has partially melted but still crunchy. Everyone liked it. It will be added to my yearly candy making list for X-MAS. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this last year for Christmas and everyone loved.  Instead of putting it into a pan and cutting it, I lined my mini cupcake pan with cute liners and spooned the fudge into that.  I put it into the fridge to set up and they turned out beautiful.  I did omit the red food colouring, but I think I will try it out this year. I also just crushed and sprinkled the candy canes on top instead of mixing them in. I gave this recipe to a friend and she used the red food colouring and said it turned out really well when she swirled it.

Vanilla baking chips are not available in my area; I only found them online from one seller but used white chocolate instead. In that case, people who don't care for white chocolate (like myself) probably won't like this as much. But it's so pretty and a nice touch at Christmas. Stir the candy cane powder and shards into the fudge, swirl in red food coloring (rather than stirring it in completely), then press the larger pieces of candy cane into the top.

This was very easy to make.  I received many nice comments about it.  Also, my son got a big kick out of smashing the candy canes into bits with a deadblow hammer.  Supervised destruction is always a plus for him.

i made this for our Christmas buffett with no changes and it was very, very good. the only problem i had with it [and i'm sure it's my fault] is by the time i got around to cutting it, it was harder than a rock. the flavor was awesome, but it was very hard to take a bite of. i'm not sure why that happened, but it barely matters when it tastes this good.

Love this recipe!  I am not a huge fan of hard candy so I was hesitant to make this, but was attracted to its festive look so thought I'd give it a try.  I did not add any food colouring and only added about 1 cup crushed candy canes.  My whole family really likes it, as did those receiving some over the holidays.  It has been added to my holiday baking list for future Christmases!

I tried to make this and it came out okay. It was soft and sticky like thick frosting but I read elsewhere that I might not have cooked it long enough so now I'm trying to fix it. Hope this works! :fingers crossed:

I hate to see all the negative reviews on this, but I get it.  It's not for everyone.  I made this last year and made it again because I am one of the people who really enjoys it!  Last year my husband accidentally bought the old-fashioned candy canes, which are softer, almost like dinner mint-consistency.  They are the thick sticks about 5 inches long.  I haven't tried it with the harder, starlight-type candy canes, and I probably won't because I like it with the sticks.  Last year I doubled the peppermint in it and I thought it was too minty.  This year I followed the directions exactly, with the exception of using old-fashioned candy canes, and I thought it was perfect.  My father-in-law loved it, my husband didn't; half my daughter's friends (sixth graders) loved it, the other half didn't.  My son likes it but doesn't love it.  This is not a soft, creamy-type fudge, it does work out to be more like candy, as someone else said.  I think it tastes a lot like a dinner mint and I love those, so I'll continue to make this every holiday.  For those who think it's not minty enough, maybe go up to 3/4 tsp of peppermint extract.  I like the subtle minty flavor with 1/2 tsp myself.  Couldn't be easier, no boiling or painful candy burns!  Four stars easy.  Would give five if it turned out more like traditional fudge.

This was very disappointing, the texture came out fine, it just taste like white chocolate chips with candy cane pieces, nothing spectacular that warrants the high ratings.  Maybe additional peppermint extract should be added for more peppermint flavor.  I would not make this again, I feel I wasted my time and money on something that was not very good.

Even though this may not officially be fudge, this is super super good.  My wife loves this stuff.  I made this twice last year and already she is talking about this being a priority to make and give to neighbors for the holidays!!!

Nice festive treat.  I used 24 oz of white choc chips, fat free milk, and just over 1 tsp Ice 101.  Was a little hard, even out of the fridge, but tasty

I made a lot of this for Christmas presents. I couldnt find peppermint extract, but did use peppermint flavoring, which isnt as strong.  I followed the recipe, even put some on the side to make red to put a swirl in it. A Keeper! UPDATE: When I made this, my son couldnt have any due to getting a tonsilectomy. I saved a couple pieces for him, and he just had to have more! So, I let him make it, since it is very easy & quick to do, and since I ran out of red food coloring, he made it blue with green swirls!

This didn't turn out like I expected. After all the great reviews I thought it would be excellent! I did it exactly as written, and it wasn't very smooth. It turned out quite sticky. I used the more expensive white chips hoping it will be smoother and it wasn't. It tasted like mint flavored condensed milk. My husband said he liked it so I gave it 3 stars instead of 2.

Followed the recipe but I ommited the food coloring.  I used the food processor to crush the candy canes.  Some of the candy canes were crushed so finely it turned into a powder which made the fudge a pinkish white color so there was no need for the food coloring.  This was my first time making fudge and it was so easy to make and it turned out great.  Everyone loved this!

I tried to make this twice and I followed the recipe exactly, yet both times my fudge was came out soft.  I'm used to solid fudge.  Not only did I double the time in the refridgerator.  It was so soft that it started to melt once I took it out of the fridge.  It tasted great though! What can I do to get a firmer fudge?????

This was really easy to make, and everyone at Christmas loved it. I tried not to stir it too much after adding the food coloring so that I would get the swirl effect and not just pink fudge, and it turned out really pretty!

I love this recipe! I don't add the food coloring to mine, but that to me is just personal preference anyways. Everyone loves this fudge! I have people asking for it every Christmas! It tastes just like the Candy Cane Hershey Kisses that are out this time of year. 5 Stars for sure!

If I could give this more stars I would. Absolutely amazing, to die for flavor.  I used white chocolate chips, have to wonder what vanilla would taste like instead. Used double the peppermint extract as I like peppermint ALOT. Crushed a full box of 24 candy canes, but had issues making them equal sized pieces. Food processor is broken. As a result had big chunks and powdery stuff when I was done. I spread the biggest chunks on the bottom of the 8x8pan after lining it with Reynolds Release foil (no need for butter-yuck). Followed the recipe and folded the rest of the candy in, dust and all, omitting the food coloring. Poured over candy in dish. Removed and turned over to cut into pieces. Way simpler than pressing candy into hot fudge. Came out vaguely pink in color, but looks pretty with candy chunks on top. Tastes great. Might drizzle with semi-sweet chocolate next round.   I didn't find it to sweet, although the mint lingers nicely. Great alternative to the heavy chocolate fudges normally served and visually appealing.

I'm giving this only two stars because the candy canes gave this fudge a really nasty texture. I think it would be MUCH better to use crushed starlight peppermints. I skipped the food coloring and it was still very festive looking, just had an awful texture.

This was excellent. I could not find vanilla chips anywhere so I made it with white chocolate chips and this made it a wonderful fudge texture! I also used the food processor to grind up the candy canes so they were a very small texture, and this made the fudge mostly white with pink sprinkles in it. I did swirl just the top with food coloring but am leaving it off next time b/c the white and pink dots looked so pretty!

This turned out a gummy mess.  I have made all kinds of candy for over 60 years but have never had anything like this.  I don't know what went wrong.

I thought it was too sweet but the two people I gave it to loved it! Very easy as far as fudge goes. Pretty hard to mess it up and very festive looking!

Pretty tasty and visually interesting.  The downside (or, perhaps the upside, if you don't want to eat a lot of sweets!) is that it is *very* rich fudge.  Still, it's an attractive addition to Christmas sweets and a nice contrast to traditional fudge.  As for the coloring, to avoid the pink hue, it's best to use gel food coloring (I got mine at a craft store).  *A little goes a long way!!!*  Just put a bit on a spoon and stir it a few times to get the attractive marbled appearance in the photo that appears with this recipe.  Regular (liquid) food coloring isn't quite potent enough to not be pink.

If I could give this recipe more than 5 stars, I would! Made a batch for the first time this year and took some to my BF's mom's house on Christmas.  Everyone LOVED it and I have been sharing the recipe ever since.  I did add a full teaspoon of peppermint extract, and used white chocolate chips because I couldn't find any vanilla chips in either of the two grocery stores where I live, and it came out beautifully.  Rich and smooth with a nice pepppermint flavor that was not overpowering.  This is definitely going to be a family classic!  THANKS!!

I made a double batch of this fudge for a bake sale.  Forgot to put in the peppermint flavoring, but the crushed candy canes gave it plenty of peppermint flavor, especially after a few days-the candy canes really came through flavor-wise.  Used 24 candy canes (the cheap ones)for the double recipe, and that was way plenty. The day the fudge was made, you could taste the white chocolate and Eagle Brand a little, but after a few days, the peppermint was the only flavor you could detect.  I used the toothpick method to drag small drops of red food coloring around on the top before the candy hardened.  This seemed to work well, and almost looked like the picture.
Don't drop too much food coloring on top, though, or it looks rather traumatized. Just use a couple of drops at a time.  I microwaved the white chocolate chips and Eagle Brand for 3 minutes at power 7--just until barely warmed, then stirred till smooth. (1100 watt oven) This worked really well and was much easier than the stove method.  A very good recipe and different.  Especially good for Christmas holidays.

Good stuff! I used white chocolate instead of vanilla chips and added 1/2 tsp vanillia. It gets a bit hard too work with as it cools so you have to be quik after you take it off the stove. Loved it not too much perpermint.

I found this recipe about 5 years ago when I made it for the first time.  Its one of the only recipes on this site that I follow exactly, it's AMAZING!!  I make it every year and my whole family and office love it.  I always get asked for the recipe, and I love how the candy canes turn the white chocolate to festive colors depending on the candy canes you use.

Ok, YUM!  Our store ran out of candy canes, so I just crushed Starlight Mints.  Had trouble with the swirl, so mom and I were joking that it looked like a slab of raw meat... that being said, it was a big hit in my Christmas dessert buffet.  Thanks for the recipe.

Made this to go with a co-worker's "ornament polyanna" gift. Wanted something "Christmasy" so I made them and put them, along with the recipe, inside the ornament. Haven't given it yet, but let my daughter taste one and she said they're delicious. I halved the recipe, used Ghirardelli white chocolate baking chips, melted them in the microwave, then added the milk. Used an 11x9 dish so they'd be thinner. Candy cane "dust" made them a little pink, but still have the red swirl effect (not as pretty as the pic, though). Put crushed candy on top also. I haven't tasted them (and probably won't) because I don't do white chocolate. I'll give an update after the recipient tastes them.

This is going to be my all-time favorite holiday fudge! It's super easy to make and looks so pretty. In the first batch I mixed the red food coloring too much and just got pink fudge but the second time I barely stirred it after adding the red and just swirled it a couple of times so there were pretty white and red stripes. With the condensed milk, you probably do need to keep it in the refrigerator but it also freezes well so it's great to make ahead of time for those little tins full of yummy candy at Christmas.

OK. Maybe this is a "girly" fudge.  Husband hated it.  I had mixed feelings about the texture of fudge.  I am used to "melt in your mouth" and this was rather thick and chewy for me. Others said it was good too.

So yummy!!!!!  I smashed 12 candy canes into tiny pieces.  It came out to 3/4 cup but I thought it was plenty.  I tried swirling the red food coloring on top but next time I'll skip that.  My husband took it to work yesterday and didn't bring one piece back.  Everyone loved it!

It was an ok treat, but not at all like fudge.  As someone said before, this is more like a candy bar.  The two tastes are an interesting combination, but you really need to like white chocolate for it to be good.  Not sure if I'll make it again as I've had much better, but it's not bad.

This is an interesting fudge. It turned out great and was pretty simple.  It wasn't as big of a hit as I thought it would be, but I think it was just such a unique and unexpected change from the traditional chocolate and peanut butter fudges.

I liked it.  Thanks for sharing!

This was a good, easy recipe. I only used 1 cup of crushed candy canes because I didn't want it over minty. Also, definitely grease the foil, I used release foil without grease and it stuck to it a bit.

This was very easy to make and got rave reviews at work.  I like that the recipe can be easily adapted to make other kinds of fudge as well. I'm thinking of trying it with milk chocolate chips and orange flavoring.

This fudge is very good if you like candy cane.  I didn't use quite as much as used in recipe and it was still plenty minty.  Also didn't use food coloring as the red/pink/white coloring was festive and pretty as is. People liked them as an after dinner treat. Will use every Christmas in my fudge platter

The family loved the fudge.  Also, gave as part of neighbor treat gift boxes. Made as prescribed except added the food coloring and swirled at the end.

I didn't have vanilla chips, so I used white chocolate instead and doubled the peppermint extract to cut thru the extra sweetness. It was a big hit.

This was very easy to make! I did just use one cup of the crushed candy canes though. I didn't add the food coloring until after I poured it into the pan. A few drops on the top and then I swirled it in. This gave a nice look when it was finished and cut. I shared it with my neighbor and she just raved about it. I will make this again next year!

I was surprised that I really liked this. The condensed milk flavor is very mild, being covered up by peppermint flavor, and was not detectable the next day. I made this at my 10-year old grandson’s request, and all three grandkids loved it. I’ll make this easy recipe again.

Very good - but a couple points: Swirl the red food color through the fudge, or you end up with pink fudge. Also, reserve some of the candies to spread on top, instead of stirring them all into the fudge.

Everyone loved these! I followed the directions exactly, except for the food coloring. Other reviewers suggested using a knife to swirl red stripes like a candy cane. Didn’t work! The mixture was too dense to pull that off. Fortunately I realized quickly and was able to contain the damage to a corner. I added red sparkles all over to make up for the lack of pink. Would make again!

To make the swirles and taste that I wa looking for, I let the chocolate completely melt and them added the extract and abit of cand cane. Once that had heated i poured into my pan and swirled about half a cup of candy cane and the food dye into the top of the fudge with the handle of a wooden spoon. Looks beautiful and has perfect taste and texture

I definitely would not call this a fudge as it is too soft (I like the description someone else gave of it being more fondant like). But despite it being quite soft and difficult to cut - even after being in the fridge for several hours - it tastes delicious and I do like it. If I made it again I would consider using small chocolate moulds or something similar so I did not need to try to cut it. The only change I made was to use 2 tsp of peppermint extract, which was perfect!

These were a hit with party guests! I didn’t use any food coloring because I love the white color against the red candy cane. I used a 4 traditional sized candy canes.

I followed this recipe minus the food coloring and I used white chocolate chips because I couldn't find vanilla chips.  This fudge has a lovely flavor but it didn't set as expected.  I set it in the refrigerator for 6 hours and it still had a sticky texture- which is strange because I also made two similar ingredient recipes and they set just fine.  I was able to cut it into squares but the tacky texture made it difficult to work with.  Also, I lined my pan with non-stick aluminum foil which worked great.

First of all, I make A LOT of candy to give as gifts at Christmas and am always on the lookout for new and pretty candy recipes. Well, I made this but mine came out looking nothing like the picture. First of all, I think this would have been much better IF ithe chips and sweetened condensed milk were combined over a double boiler. Yes, mine melted just fine as the directions said but it thickens really quick because of the direct heat. I stirred my peppermint flavoring in  off the heat  (and the mixture really started thickening up), then the crushed peppermint, and finally the red food coloring. By time everything was combined, mine was more pink than white. Big disappointment! Not sure how to get it to look like red marbled swirls as shown in the picture. 
Flavor is okay - nothing special to me and I do like peppermint candy. I taste more of the sweetened condensed milk than anything. Don't think I'll waste either my time or money making this one again.

I made a quadruple batch of this recipe. I have a lot of people that I need to give handmade gifts to, and this was the perfect match recipe to do that! I did add more peppermint extract at the recommendation of other reviewers. I tasted it with the amount recommended in the recipe, and I could barely taste any peppermint at all. If you're like me and you like a good minty flavor, you'll want to add more. Also, at the recommendation of other reviewers are used one half vanilla chips and one half white chocolate. The result was a very creamy soft fudge. My husband is allergic to chocolate and this is his new favorite fudge.

Nice color contrast and flavor contrast to all the other sweets. Recommend: 1. not using food processor to crush candy cane because all the pretty striping was ground off the pieces. 2. Not mixing red food color into mix. White/red mix is prettier IMHO.

The recipe, as is, took almost two full boxes of candy canes. I started making this to use up old candy canes from last year but ended up rushing to the store to grab another box. Despite this, the fudge turned out really well. I would suggest leaving out the food coloring as the candy cane pieces make a great pink-marble effect. For an decorative element, just leave a few larger chunks of candy cane to sprinkle on top before the fudge cools. The fudge really cools fast through! Melting the chips on medium heat allows the fudge to cool very quickly, making it thick and requiring lots of muscle to stir. Overall, I will make again, but with a few adjustments.

Absolutely  loved it! I didn't use food coloring and I also used 2 teaspoons of peppermint extract, it added a lot to the taste! I recommed busting your peppermints first, the chips don't take long to melt at all. Oh and I saved some to sprinkle on top before I cooled it! I think this will be my yearly Christmas candy??

This was a great and easy recipe! I only had one package of white chocolate chips so I used semi - sweet chocolate chips instead! It was a great substitute, and the fudge still had the candy cane taste! I loved this recipe and will make it again!

Love this recipe. I think I made it 3 times over the holidays last year. Every time I make it I put a tad more peppermint flavoring in but that is just a personal taste. Everyone loves this and it is great addition to any cookie plate.

I would have to agree with a previous reviewer... do not use Ghirardelli vanilla chips (my grocery store doesn't carry any other brand of vanilla chips so I had no choice). It ruined my fudge! After it began to melt in the saucepan, all the oils started to separate and oil dripped everywhere while trying to transport it from saucepan to dish. The peppermint oil isn't nearly enough because it barely had a minty taste. It sets up quickly and I had just enough time to add the peppermint pieces before it hardened. After transporting it to a dish, I had to get paper towels to sop up all the oil on top. Then I put it in the fridge.. big mistake! It got so hard you could barely take a bite. Very few people ate it and I ended up throwing most of it away. I will stick to regular fudge from now on.

This is pretty and it tastes festive, but it's essentially melted vanilla chips with candy cane mixed in, so I don't see how it could ever be classified as great.  I served this with a large selection of cookies and this didn't make the top of the favorite list.  I imagine if it were served alone, folks would eat it and say it's pretty good, but I don't think the taste really wow's anyone.  I suspect the attraction is how festive it looks.

Made this as written. It seemed to take a long time for the vanilla chips to melt, and you do have to keep stirring them or they will start to burn. I used a mini food processor to chop up the candy canes, which was much easier than using a meat tenderizer on them like I started doing.  I used 12 candy canes, and it was plenty pepper-minty.

I didn't like this very much the day I made it, but the flavors seemed to come together more the next day.  I used white chocolate chips, and while this turned out ok, I much prefer the Peppermint Brittle recipe on this site.  Still, people liked it - didn't get rave reviews, but it made a nice addition to my cookies trays.

This is the best peppermint fudge recipe I have tried.  It is definitely rich, I cut mine into 1 inch squares.  I opted to leave out the food coloring, it is beautiful with just the crushed candy canes on top.

Very good recipe! I used milk chocolate chips instead, and only put the crushed candy canes on the top instead of mixed in. Quite delicious and will certainly make it again!

Thank you for this!!!  I cannot eat chocolate so fudge (and holidays in general) are difficult for me to have desserts.  This was my first ever attempt at fudge and it came out sinfully divine.  I made it for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it.  It has this wonderful texture, you just can't help yourself.  I didn't crush candy canes.  I got lucky and found white chocolate candies filled with candy canes at Costco, so I grabbed them up.  Then at the last minute I found Andes white and peppermint bits at Target.  I added all of the Costco candies and a handful of the Andes bits, everything melted down perfectly.  Then I sprinkled the Andes bits on top, beautiful.  Oh!  I also didn't add any food coloring, since it isn't good for you (LOL!  Who cares when making fudge, right!  Silly.) but it was very pretty regardless, nice pink color.  I suggest you cut it into small pieces just because it is so rich.  Enjoy!

This was fine, but not the consistency of fudge.  It was too hard and dry.  No one in my family really ate it.  I did increase the peppermint extract to 1 tsp and it was still hard to taste the flavor.

very yummy! I tried to take others advice and swirl in the food coloring at the end but I worked too slow. Watch out, it hardens quickly.  I used white chocolate chips since that's all I could find and it's VERY sweet, but looking at the ingredients I would expect that. I would make it again.

I don't think this qualifies as a "fudge" but it tastes great! I doubled the amount of peppermint extract, and it's been a huge holiday and party hit for a couple years now! I leave out the red food coloring, as it tends to come out light pink, and isn't esthetically pleasing. I leave mine in the fridge over night before cutting. It is quite sweet/rich, so I usually cut it into small pieces.

I tried this at Christmastime to add to a variety of goodies I made for a group at work.  It went over very well and, as all fudge is very sweet, the peppermint took away some of the rich sweet flavor  mixing its own wonderful minty flavor with it.

This was pretty good but not the best fudge I've had.  I definitely would recommend skipping the red food coloring. I just gently swirled it in but it gave the fudge an overall odd-color which I think was off-putting.

This was really good when first made but after a day or two the candy canes started to "melt" and made an unpleasant look.  Also, the fudge was kind of hard and not really soft.

Made this for my family Christmas Party.  I did not like the texture and was not like fudge at all.  More like was the recipe called for...overly sweet baking chips mixed with sweet condensed milk.  I will stick with the traditional style fudge.

Was really easy to put together.  Definitely could use more peppermint extract.  Peppermint taste was non-existant.  Also, I didn't find the need to add the red food coloring.  The peppermint candies added that swirling effect alone.

This has become a family favorite of ours for the last 3 years! I prefer making it with one bag of milk chocolate and one bag of white chocolate chips, (no need for food coloring in that version). I find it sets to a better consistancy for our tastes. Great recipe!

Didn't really care for this.  I thought it was chewy, not like my reguar fudge recipe using marshmallow fluff. Unwrapping the candy canes was also very tedious.  Sorry...

I didn't see vanilla chips, so I bought and made these with almond bark, but it didn't thicken up enough.  They were too soft, but they were super super sweet!  (silver lining--I was satisfied with tiny bite size servings)

I made this for a cookie exchange party and it received rave reviews! I only added 1 cup of candy canes because that's all I had and did a swirl effect with the red food coloring. It came out pretty and was yummy!

Made this tonight for my hubby to share with coworkers for Christmas. Unfortunately, when I went to the store, they were out of peppermint extract. I bought cinnamon extract and used that instead with the round cinnamon discs crushed up (same measurements as if it had been peppermint). It turned out so yummy! Super easy and quick to make and oh so delicious!

Mmmmmm.... so good. I just finished a test batch of the fudge to give away as holiday treats, and I'm loving them. I might have to give it away today,before I eat the whole pan full. I made it almost exactly as written, except for the food coloring. i first put the chocolate mixture into the dish, then put 5 scattered dots of red coloring, then swirled then. Very pretty presentation. I did also sprinkle a few pieces of the crushed candy canes on top before chilling. I might omit this next time though. A little too much crunch as per hubby's remarks.
All in all.... easy and inexpensive. Will definitely be using this again and again.

I made this so far twice every time Christmas came along. I found it fun to do this and loved the minty white chocolate taste. I brought some of the fudge to school to share with friends and they all loved it very much, one friend even asked for the recipe. Overall, Love it! And will make it again.

i love peppermint, but this just tasted plain artificial. It wasn't good... at all. Maybe it was bc I used candy canes instead of the starlite mints, I dunno. I know that I won't attempt to make this again though.

so delicious!  I doubled the recipe because I like fudge thick and so it took extra time to set up but it was great!  We also saved some of the crushed peppermint and pressed it on the top--tasted so good and looked great too.  I can't wait until next holiday season to make this again and share

I made this yesterday and followed the directions except for adding food coloring. This is not fudge! Its closer to a fondant very soft and sticky. I also agree that the cushed candy canes give it an unpleasant texture. Save your money and make white chocolate mint bark with your extra candy canes

Yum!  I couldn't find my peppermint extract after everything was on the stove so decided to try butter extract.  It turned out great!  I also cut down the peppermints to 1 cup.  It was a creamy peppermint dream - just the right amount of sweetness.  I will make this again!!

I followed the directions and everything.. but my fudge ended up really, really sticky and gooey. Like, it would not cut apart and whenever I tried to pick some off, it would stick to my hands. It tasted good though, and I think that if I changed something next time I did it (like maybe add more chocolate?) then it would be much better.

I had a terrible time the first time making this because we have a gas stove and medium heat burnt everything. We placed a smaller pot under the pot we were using and we filled it half way with water. I also only used 1 cup of crushed candy canes.  It was a HIT! Everyone loved it and people are bugging me left and right for the recipe.  THANK YOU

I made this to use up the candy canes from the Christmas season. I ended up throwing it out as no-one wants to eat it because it's too sweet and we like fudge & my husband is a dessert person...Was quite a waste to make this.

Incredible!! Very easy to make it and great taste! I swirled the food coloring so that it was more of a red/white than a pink. I cut it in squares and placed it on holiday festive paper plates. It made a great gift for our neighbors. They all wanted the recipe and my family was sad there wasn't any left so I had to make some more! I will definitely make this an annual holiday recipe.

This was the first time I made fudge and it turned out really good.  I just wanted to use up the leftover candy canes and I think next Christmas I'll make these for a large gathering cause it makes a large quantity.

This was so very yummy! I brought it to a Xmas party and everyone wanted more because the peppermint complimented the sweetness so much better than regular fudge. The only complaint is that the candy cane was a pain in the you know what to crush without a food processor (you'd better have a good food processor with great blades too). Thanks again!

I didn't have any peppermint extract, so I used mint.  Also, I ground the candy canes to an almost dust like texture because I didn't want anyone to break a tooth on a piece of candy cane.  Everyone at worked loved the fudge.

This was so easy to make and my co-worker loved it.  She is not a chocolate fan, but had said one day she wished she could get a white choc peppermint fudge that there was not a layer of chocolate.  This recipe fit the bill.  Thanks.

Loved this festive fudge. Can omit the peppermint extract as well if you don't have it. Candy canes alone carry the mint flavor well enough.

I made this over the holidays and it was the biggest hit of over 20 different treats - favorite for both the kids and the adults. It is sweet, but you can make the pieces very small. My 3 year old loved to help smash the candy canes in a thick sandwich baggie. And it was super easy to make.

This was super easy to make.  I did have a little separation of butter fat that formed a layer on the fudge.  I was able to wipe it off once the fudge was cooled though.  Aside from that, this was delicious!

I'm going to have to make this again the right way...  I only had one back of the vanilla chips and a package of white bark...It didn't turn out so well.  It was way to hard to cut into squares..I had to brake it apart.  Next time I will use all vanilla chips and put it in a larger dish so it won't be so thick.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this so my mom could take to work today. She loved it!! I am going to take it to the rest of my family on Christmas. HURRAY!!!!!
p.s. Be sure to check your bag of chips as to whether it is 10 or 12 oz. There is a difference!! I also use the wholoe box of candy canes. :]

I must have done something wrong because my fudge came out too gooey to really do anything with. The only thing I changed was that I used Nestle's white chocolate chips instead of vanilla baking chips. The fudge tasted good, I just wish it hadn't been so gooey!

I used white chocolate morsels and melted them in the microwave. About halfway through the melting process I added the milk. I also used a full teaspoon of extract.

I did not do the swirls, and it is still a very pretty candy. 

Will make again!

This fudge came out beautiful.  I swirled the red dye and put crushed candy canes on top.  Mine didn't taste very minty - it tasted like white chocolate.  It lookd great on a holiday platter with other flavors of fudge I made.

This turned out really well.  I added a little extra peppermint extract and swirled the red food coloring on top.  A great addition to my holiday gifts.

Very good.  Big hit at parties.  Unless you're a pro, you won't be able to make pretty red stripes like in the photo so do this instead: sprinkle the crushed candy canes on top instead of stirring into the fudge.  I did this and everyone ooh'd and aah'd when I unveiled the fudge.  It's so simple and really pretty!

So easy I thought I was doing something wrong.  The mixture is very doughy in the pan but turned out great.  I used more peppermint extract, almost 2tsp.

Very easy recipe.  It was so quick...and the taste was wonderful.  It took more candy canes then I thought to make 1 1/2 cups.  I will make this one again.  Thank you.

My family didn't really care for this fudge.  It wasn't very creamy.  I probably won't make it again.

I didn't actually taste this after it set, but I did taste the batter, and it was very yummy. Howver, my friends really liked it. They complimented on its mild peppermint taste, and how its not overbearing. Its really easy, and will probably make it again.

Good, but too sweet.  I would suggest making it with chocolate chips instead of the white.  Also, drop the green food coloring.  I needed to add crushed pepermint to the top so it didn't look so Halloweenish.  I also added more Peppermint extract.

I made these candies for our hospital Christmas tea, and before it was over, I was getting requests for the recipes.  So VERY easy, will use this recipe over and over.

Excellent fudge recipe!  This is a great way to use up leftover candy canes.  I used red and green candy canes and did not add food coloring.  It turned out beautiful!
