This soup is sooo good and easy. I doubled the recipe so my husband could bring leftovers to work. I pureed part of the soup and left part of it chunky. To make it even richer I added some cream at the end and leftover ham. So comforting on a cold day.

Delicious!  I think I'll leave some of the soup chunky next time--just personal preference.  Great flavor, though.

This soup is delicious!  It is very rich.  For me just a cup was enough until the next day.  Even my very picky daugther liked it!

Excellent! I added a few more tablespoons of marjoram and bohnenkraut in addition to a couple cloves of garlic. I blended only half of the pot for a little more 'chunky' soup. Used grated cheese instead of cubed and it just didn't melt as well - lesson learned! But it didn't matter, the flavor was still awesome!!

This was great.  Right after blending, I aded a bottle of  beer and 1/2 of cup of half-n-half.  Now it's a soup to die for!

I will definitely make this again!  It was delicious.  I did not put in parsnips (didn't have any), and I saved back about a cup  from being pureed so the soup would be more chunky.

I had to add a little more chicken broth after it sat in the fridge for a couple of days.
My husband loved it also?

The recipe is a great starter, but here are my suggestions to make it better:  1.  only puree 1/3 to 1/2 half of the mixture.  2.  add 3 ounces cream cheese (at the end).  3.  add 1 tbls of bacon bits (in the beginning).  4.  add heaping tablespoon of sour cream add a splash of half and half (at the end).  Enjoy!

I am not sure why this delicious soup has been waiting for a picture since 2001.  This soup is very easy to prepare.  I used an immersion hand blender to puree the soup.  Seen as we had someone who can't eat cheese I let everyone add cheese to their own bowls.  I used some cajun seasoning on my bowl of soup to kick it up a notch.  Thanks for a great recipe.
