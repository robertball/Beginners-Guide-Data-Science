Easy and awesome recipe - this came out better than the jackfruit tacos I had at a fancy vegan restaurant in LA! The jackfruit came out flavorful and tender. I used homemade taco seasoning.

Quite delicious. I like the instructions to rinse the jackfruit first. It takes away that brine flavor. I shredded the fruit instead of cutting into pieces. It gives it a nice texture for tacos and tostadas. I highly recommend trying this recipe. Even if you arenâ€™t vegan, these tacos are delicious and will make you happy. Thank you for the recipe.
