I was intrigued by the recipe, however I needed an appetizer to take along to a party as a cold appetizer.  I followed the recipe as presented and cooled the shrimp.  I then made a second batch of the marinade but without the oil and mixed it with cream cheese and sour creame.  I spread the amended marinade mixture on pieces of dark rye bread and pumpernickel and then laid the marinaded/grilled shrimp (after cooled) on top.  It was awesome and everyone loved them.

This recipe was SO simple and the shrimp was delicious. I ended up using half a lemon instead of the lime because I didn’t have any on hand- I also added a combo of red pepper flakes & chili powder in place of the ground red pepper. Lastly I cooked the shrimp on the stove top instead of on the grill to make it easier- put about a tbsp of olive oil in the skillet and some minced garlic. Let that heat up for 1 minute then threw the shrimp in, allowed them to cook for about 2-3 minutes then added snow peas and sugar snap peas. The shrimp cooked for 1 more minute after adding the vegetables then I served the shrimp over brown rice. Absolutely delicious! Good next day too- I ate it cold (so the shrimp wouldn’t get overcooked) and just added some sliced avocado... thanks for the recipe Jenny :o)

This is the best grilled shrimp I've ever had.  It was awesome!  I did double the tequila but other than that followed the recipe exactly.

This recipe is absolutely fabulous! This tastes like something that you would order at a nice restaurant. It will not disappoint! Very easy to make. I used jumbo frozen shrimp that was already deveined, just had to peel them (but left the tails on for good looks). I have also used fresh shrimp from the market. Both do well. The bigger the shrimp, the better. I have used bottled lime juice when I don't have a lime laying around. I have also substitued dry cilantro as well, but you get a much better flavor from chopping it fresh. I've made this several times and it's always a hit. Great summer meal!

This was wonderful! My husband and daughter couldn't stop raving about dinner. I improvised just a little by adding 2 tablespoons margarita sweet & sour mix, and doubling the tequila. I marinated the shrimp for approximately 2 hours. I skewered the shrimp with red bell slices and served them over a bed of rice pilaf, with a side of steamed broccoli. The flavor of the shrimp was fabulous. This recipe is defintely a keeper.

My husband and I love shrimp on the grill and are always trying out new marinades.  This was awesome!  I served it with crusty bread and a big salad and that's all we needed.  Loved it!

This is wonderful!  To make it even better, here is my suggestion: double the marinade and set half aside.  While the shrimp is grilling, simmer the extra marinade on the stovetop.  Serve the shrimp over rice (I used and loved "Lime Cilantro Rice" from this site) and then drizzle the extra sauce over the shrimp and rice.  So delicious!

I say this is a 4 1/2.  I did add some margarita mix and OJ to make some more liquid for the marinade.  It was great on the shrimp.  Thanks for sharing.

Without even making this will tell you that is the marinade for ceviche and would not leave shrimp in it for 3 hours. Wouldn't even bother to grill shrimp just drain the excess marinade off and eat the lime will cook the shrimp

This was sooooo good!  I've made it several times and I love it more each time.  The girls at work don't believe I've made this.  They think I brought in left-overs from a restaurant!  It's even good cold!

I made this on skewers on the BBQ for ten people and there wasn't a single shrimp left in the house.  People DEVOURED it.  It's absolutely wonderful!  (Note:  I did 3 tbsp of tequila...)

Fantastic recipe.  I was looking for a quick and easy recipe for the shrimp I bought for an appetizer.  It was not only quick and easy, but delicious as well.  Lots of flavor.

This was so good. Too cold to grill, so I put the shrimp and marinade in a screaming hot cast iron skillet. Removed the shrimp when cooked and reduced the sauce by half, then added a pat of butter and poured over the shrimp. Definitely a keeper.

This is a great way to do Southwest shrimp.  Everyone loves this dish.  I've been making this for several years, sans tequila; but, I endorse this nice touch.  I've been using white wine in my marinade.  Also, a finely diced Jalapeno or two can be used instead of the red pepper.

I urge you to add the lime juice to the marinade less than an hour before cooking.  I use more fresh lime juice (4-6 tbsp.) just before cooking.  The lime juice tends to "cook" the  shrimp even before the fire is applied.

Delicious! So good and so easy to make. My husband is still raving about it. As another reviewer, I added fresh asparagus and cooked in a grill basket.  I will make this one over again.

Just made this for the 3rd time. It's better if you use 9-12 per pound raw shrimp, peeled & deveined. Add an extra teaspoon of tequila & use 1/2 teaspoon of crushed red pepper instead of ground red pepper. We use a grilling basket instead of skewers & turn 4 times. WOW!

You don’t tug on Superman’s cape. . . and don’t mess around with this recipe! Had these w/ “Easy Frozen Margaritas” from this site. Maybe it was the alcohol that made these taste so good but who cares. Simply great as written!! Suggest using wild shrimp as they’re more flavorful than farm raised.

Simply fantastic. I didn't change a thing. Well didn't have fresh cilantro so I used dried. Other than that it was perfect as written. Instead of using bamboo skewers, I use porcelain coated grilling basket(much easier and faster than threading all that). I also marinaded fresh asparagus(cut into 2-3 inch pieces) right along with the shrimp. Cooked the asparagus for 5 minutes and then tossed the shrimp in the basket. Stir occasionally. DO NOT OVER COOK the shrimp. Enjoy>>>>Thanks Jenny Best grilled shrimp to date for me.

This recipe was delicous! We followed it exactly as written. Make sure to use raw shrimp. Do not over marinate or over cook! Grilled some fresh lemon and drizzled over shrimp right after grilling. YUMMO! Try this, you will not be disappointed.

I am rating the marinade only. I had difficulty detecting any shrimp falvour but then this is an appy finger dish so it doesn't really matter. Our Spot Prawn season is now in Vancouver and I can take whole live (very large) prawns and steam them in butter and lemon grass and mixed pepper corns and shalots in white wine and then peel them after cooking.

A very simple marinade and grilled shrimp is one my favourite things to cook and eat! It is on the quite spicy side, which I love but just a heads up to others who want a more mild heat - cut back. Thanks for a recipe that allows me to have a shot of tequila with dinner. :)

These were very simple to make and had just enough flavor that you could still taste the shrimp, not just all of the stuff that got put on them. I did increase the amount of tequila to about 3T, following other reviewers suggestions.

This shrimp is devine!!! It's the best shrimp I've ever tasted! Full of flavor and super easy and fast to make!!! 
I didn't have skewers so I used a heavy grilling pan on my stovetop. I put extra virgin olive oil, and some more minced garlic in the hot oil. The shrimp cooked for about 5 minutes total and was perfectly cooked! Yum

My husband and I made these as a last minute appetizer to go with our steaks this weekend and the shrimp were truly the star of the meal! The only thing I added extra was another 1 tsp of tequila.  My husband woke up this morning asking if I could make these again this week, but as the main course.  OF COURSE I CAN!!   Usually my husband cannot tolerate cilantro or lime, but in this dish he loved both of those ingredients. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This marinade, garlic, lime, OO, tequila, cilantro, pepper flakes and salt is a great go-to for chicken or beef fajitas. It's a keeper.

Just a comment. The recipe calls for the shrimp to be marinated for 30 minutes, not for 3 hours.

Delish!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't skewer and grill them.  Instead, after marinating for a while, I took out the shrimp, brought the marinade to a boil and then added the shrimp.  They cooked up in about 30 seconds!  I served it over garlic bread to sop up the delicious broth.  I will make this again and again, thank you Jenny for sharing!

Used this marinade on chicken leg quarters on my gas Weber Q last night and it was fabulous.  The skin got deep brown and crisp and the meat was still juicy. This recipe will be used again for sure.

liked it!  Added a bit more tequila, and used dried cilantro since I didn't have fresh.  Marinated for several hours before grilling.

This was good, but I don't think I'd do it again.  Living in Maryland, there's only one real way to steam/marinate shrimp and that's with Old Bay.  Since I didn't find a marinade using Old Bay, I tried this one.  It complimented my "surf and turf" dish of T-bone steaks, but I'll have to go back to my old stand-by.  I guess I'll have to devise my own Old Bay marinade.

Made this for dinner last night and it was fantastic. Only change I made was to up the tequila a bit per suggestions from other reviewers. Also subbed chili powder for the red pepper since my wife and mother-in-law can't take the heat. Will make it again and very soon!

This recipe is so easy and so INCREDIBLE!  We've made it at least 6 times since February.  We love it, and highly recommend it!  The first time, I borrowed Tequila from the neighbor, and the rest of the times I made it without.  It's still amazing without the Tequila, but I may have to stop being a tightwad and just buy some of my own.

If you make this, you'll be very pleased with the results!

I've made this twice.  Both times I have left out the tequila (ran out) and doubled the red pepper (used cayenne).  Delicious.

These were a great way to cook shrimp!  I may cut back the red pepper just a bit next time because I don't like spicy food much, but the flavor of this was really delicious.  Also, it was a breeze to throw together which is always a good thing.  Yummy stuff!

Tasty but I think it dried out the shrimp.  I didn't think I overcooked them but they sure were dry.  I think I'll just stick with salt, pepper & a bit of cajun seasoning next time.

I scaled this recipe for six people.  Since kids were eating it, I omitted the red pepper flakes but kept everything else the same.  I served this as shrimp tacos with avocados, limes, and shredded cheese, along with a side of Black Beans and Rice from this website.  The result was everyone asking for THIRDS and no leftovers!  We LOVED THIS!  THANKS!

This was okay.  I felt like it needed a sauce.  Maybe next time, I'll double the marinade and make a sauce from that.

Quick and easy! I didn't have cilantro on hand so I omitted that, but when I have some in my garden again this summer I'll be making this plenty. I might add a little more tequila next time, I find I didn't really taste it.

My 5 yr old son and I love seafood especially shrimp.  I saw this recipe and thought I would give it a try.  This was one of the best grilled shrimp recipes I have ever had.  I tried it once where I didn't have much time for the shrimp to marinade and it was good, but I tried it again and let the shrimp marinade for about 2 hours the second time.  It was a lot better the second time.  So the key is the longer you can let the shrimp marinade the better it will be.  I also brushed the remaining marinade on the shrimp when I put them on before flipping the skewers for added flavor.  I am definitely going to try the recipe on chicken also.

I didn't find that the long marinade and tequila flavours merged with the shrimp. I've had tastier more bold flavours with other marinades from this site.

Yummy Yum and very easy to make. These shrimp had a nice refreshing lime tast and the addition of the red pepper and garlic and lemon pepper (something I added) added a nice zest. They were really good.  I also used whiskey instead of tequila (because we didn't have tequila on hand) and it was oh so good. This is definitely a keeper for a quick snack or a party.

This is a great recipe easy and tasty. I worked really well with precooked shrimp (its all I had) so that's a huge plus. Try it you wont regret it.

This was fantastic.  I marinated the pre-cooked shrimp in it and think I liked eating them cold like an appetizer vs. cooking them on skewers tasted best.  Will  make it again purposely to bring to a party for an appetizer and serve in a pretty bowl with toothpicks for individual "sampling."  I did try marinating chicken with the same marinade and it didn't turn out as well as the shrimp.

No cilantro because hubby doesn't like it.  Used a dash of cayenne instead of ground red pepper.  These came out so good!!!!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Meh.....this was ok in my book.  I added a bit more tequila and lime juice and it still didn't have a strong enough flavor for me personally.  I'll try something else next time.

This was an absolutely awesome recipe.  The only change I made was to add some honey to the marinade.  The lime juice was just too overpowering.  This was far better than any restaurant shrimp I have ever, ever eaten.

Just made this for the first time and scanned the comments before proceeding. Not sure about the negative ones. I only made one substitution and that was by accident. I misread the ground red pepper and used red pepper flakes instead. It still turned out wonderful and I will make this again. It's definitely a keeper! Thanks!

These were excellent! After reading the reviews, I did add more tequila. I goofed and bought the wrong shrimp and they shrunk considerably on the grill so I am anxious to try this recipe again when I have better shrimp.

Ok this was delicious!!!! and so flavorful, i have no clue how some said this was bland, i did add a little  more red pepper, but overall i kept  the recipe ingrediants the same.  i however got really small shrimp so there was no need to use skewers, i just dumped eveything in a skillet and sauteed it.  i then made the cliantro lime rice and pour the everything in the skillet over the rice, yummy and so very easy.  this will become a regular easily!!

So simple and delicious. This makes a great last minute meal even if you have frozen shrimp on hand, which I did. I was able to thaw my peeled deveined frozen shrimp in cool water at room temp in around 1/2 hour. Next time I make this I will save a little marinade aside to baste while grilling for a little extra moistness. But these were delicious.

I make this recipe all the time.  I do add a little more tequila, and a pinch of red pepper flakes to give it a little more zip.  I would definitely not recommend marinating for more than 30 minutes, and I always brush the left over marinade on the shrimp while I am grilling them.  They are delicious.  Try brushing some olive oil and salt on some asparagus and grill it with them.  TASTY!

I have never grilled shrimp before but in an effort to eat healthier I had bought some frozen deveined tail on shrimp from Trader Joes.  I followed the recipe for the marinade exactly except for using rum instead of tequila (don't have tequila in the house).  I poured the marinade over the frozen shrimp in a plastic bag and let it sit for about 90 minutes on the counter.  The shrimp had thawed and and actually had started to cook with the lime juice.  We enjoyed the grilled shrimp a whole lot and will be doing this again.

Delicious! I have made these several times and have made a few alterations.  I use the E-Z peel shrimp.  I find that if the shell is on, it protects the shrimp from getting burned.  If the shells gets burned, the shrimp itself is still great.  Also, I use the juice of 2 whole limes, and at least 2 Tbsp. of tequila.  Sometimes, I use a diced fresh jalapeno instead of the red pepper for more kick.  Enjoy!

This was a huge hit for a weekend gathering I had.  So so simple to make!  I marinated the shrimp for 3 hours and doubled the amount of tequila used to get more of a margarita flavor.  Definitely making this again and again.

i actually used this marinade for tiliapia.  it could not sit long at all as it started to 'cook' the fish.  it did have a very nice flavor.  i think if i had had the cilantro it would have been a 5 star for sure for me; but the DH does not like it.  i can't wait to try this on shrimp!  thanks for the post jenny!

These were AMAZING! We cooked them on the grill after marinating them for about an hour. The only change I made was to double the teqiula per other reviewers. Will make again tonight!

This recipe was just OK.  I felt the marinade didn't get absorbed into the shrimp that much, and I marinated them for over 3 hours.  I guess I was expecting more flavor than what I got.

Simply awesome. I marinated for a little over an hour and the flavor came out great. I did just eyeball everything and added a little of the margarita I was drinking at the time for more liquid but it turned out great. I think it'd be pretty tough to mess this one up.

This marinade is really good with chicken as well. I marinated chicken breasts for 2 days (by accident), then grilled.  Tender, juicy and YUMMY!  I have since marinated chicken for 1-2 hours, but it isn't as moist as the 2 day marinade.

Everyone liked these. Used parsely instead of cilantro, because my daughter doesn't like cilantro. Also, grilled on top of a perforated grill rack to save the time it takes to skewer the shrimp. These would be great in a salad, too. Served with corn on the cob, cucumber salad, and toasted pita wedges for a summery and easy meal. Thanks for the great recipe!

So simple and so good.  I let my shrimp marinate for 3hrs without any ill effects on the meat.

The flavor of the meat was wonderful.

I made this the first time and used Halibut and sauted it with the marinade and it was good, but not too much kick.  The 2nd time, I used jalepeno olive oil and cut out the ground red pepper and grilled the shrimp - it was EXCELLENT!  Also, since I didn't have tequilla, I used margarita mix with tequilla in it and it worked just as well.  We have used this recipe 3 times in the last week alone.

Just what I was looking for. This is such a good recipe! I did not have fresh cilantro on hand so I used dried. Still delicious. The next time I make this I will plan ahead and buy fresh cilantro ~ it will be even better! Definitely a keeper. Thank you for sharing. As a matter of fact, I have passed this on to two good friends. =)

Used this recipe for a surf and turf outside meal.  I really liked it.  It is a subtle marinade that does not overwhelm the shrimp.  It is super easy to put together.  I typically have all the ingredients on hand.  The only change was to adjust the heat factor - the amount of cayenne -  to 1/8 tsp for 1lb of shrimp.  I know that if I don't have the fresh cilantro on hand, I'll make the marinade ahead of time and use 1.5  Tbs  dry cilantro which I always have in my spice cabinet.  With all said that's why it gets 5 stars.   It was perfect and will certainly make this again and again.  Thanks for sharing!

I have been using a similar marinade for years. Add a tablespoon or so of olive oil to keep the shrimp more moist . Of course, you can also substitute Tabasco  for the pepper flakes.   It also makes an excellent marinade for tuna steaks or salmon fillet's before grilling.

This was super easy and very tasty.  I made a couple of small changes: omitted the red pepper, added a dash of cumin, and grilled the shrimp with the shells on.  I think it kept the shrimp from drying out on the grill.  I'll definitely be making this one again!

Not bad. While I prefer a simple lime & garlic marinade (think Chili's shrimp fajitas...), this was decent nonetheless. Our shrimp were a tad bland, but not enough to keep me from making them again. Having said this, I do wish I could have tasted more of the margarita marinade because it smelled FANTASTIC! :) Topping our skewers with a squeeze of fresh lime / pico de gallo was a nice touch (and a must, IMHO). Spanish rice, chips and guacamole were perfect, fuss-free sides. Margaritas made this a truly authentic meal. I'll definitely be making this again come summertime. Thanks for sharing your idea, Jenny! :-)

This was extremely yummy.  It's winter so I used a cast iron skillet which worked great.  I also took some of the marinade, added a pat of butter and a bit of white wine and reduced it on the stove. It made a great sauce over the top of the shrimp and the rice.

We really enjoyed this.  I used all the ingredients as specified to prepare the recipe, and only marinated for 30 minutes before grilling.  However, I did take the unused marinade and brought it to a boil, for one full minute.  I served the shrimp over garlic toast and then poured the cooked marinade over all.  This was flavorful and not too spicy.  Dee-lish!

Followed it exactly and it turned out amazing.  Used chicken and shrimp.  It was 4.5 stars for the chicken but probably 10 stars for the shrimp.  AMAZING.  Wouldn't change a thing.

This dish was a hit from the 7 year old to the 49 year old.  Our two youngest are extremely picky eaters and they loved this meal!!!  My husband's comment was that this could be served for a fancier meal setting.  The only change was that I cooked it in the oven @ 350 for 30 minutes.

My girlfriend and I have been making this for a few years but with a little more tequilla (equal amounts of tequilla, lime juice, and a half olive oil).  Add basil and/or cumin too.

Even though I was away from a printer, and did forget several key ingredients, it was AMAZING!  I used 2 T tequila, 2 T fresh squeezed lime juice, 1/4 lemon wedge fresh squeezed, and chopped flat leaf parsley since I can't stand cilantro.  A dash of sea salt, a bit of fresh cracked pepper, and it was phenomenal

Hands down the BEST homemade shrimp I've ever made. Always try to share it with friends, and they rave about it too !! Thanks for posting, it's perfect as written, I made no changes. Used a pretty good tequila and The biggest shrimp (collosal) and it's perfect every time.

I've made these a few times and we love the flavor.  The trick is to not over cook them.  This is a great summer time meal.

This recipe is delicious!  I have been making it for years as an appetizer and it is always a hit. I serve it in a giant margarita glass partially filled with crushed ice and with a bowl of salsa mixed with sour cream in the center for a dipping sauce.

This recipe ROCKS. I marinated big prawns to do a trial run with this recipe. It was outstanding. This will be our Christmas dinner this year. I wanted to try the recipe out before an important holiday but don't fear trying it out. It is wonderful and we can't wait for Christmas. I served this with lemon couscous and fresh asparagus and it was perfect.

I love this recipe, you can also marinate already cooked shrimp in this and then serve it as a cold appetizer.. I did that for a party I had and everyone loved it!! I am so glad I found this one.

This was really good!  I sauteed it on the stovetop though...too hot to fire up the grill today.  I made it exactly as the recipe states.  I might spice it up a little next time and I definately want to try it on the grill!  A great summer, light meal!

Have avoided shrimp for years since husband is allergic.  Now have two boys that love it so have started trying recipes.  This was my first attempt, yummy!  Cut back on the red pepper due to the boys.  One thought it was still too hot but the other gobbled it up.  I think the recipe is perfect as is.  I used them for shrimp tacos but will serve over rice so I can enjoy the flavor.  I also use the margarita chicken recipe on this site for chicken tacos which is good but this has a more subtle flavor.  A keeper in my book.

We loved this dish in my house! So simple and so delicious! Made a couple of changes though.  I used key limes since I didn't have regular limes. Also, I added some Tabasco Chipotle hot sauce. I marinated the shrimp for about an hour. Our grill was out of gas, so I cooked the shrimp in a pan with the marinade and mixed in some cooked bowtie pasta for a super yummy meal!

Really, really good. Made it once as directed. Made it a second time using chipotle powder instead of red pepper, marinated 2 to 4 hours in the fridge, and cooked them under the broiler for >2 minutes total. Don't overcook your shrimp!

This was great!  We added mushrooms, peppers and onions.  We also used the vanilla rum as one rater suggested.  We've already made it twice in two weeks and will make it again soon!

Excellent! I'm always looking for great ways to grill shrimp and this is one of the best I have tried and my family loved it.  It was even good cold the next day.  I had extra marinade and I used it on chicken and it was pretty tasty too!  Will definitely do again!

Very Yummy! One thing, I couldn't taste the marinade that much even though I soaked the shrimp for over 2 hours, otherwise I would have given this a 5. I made veggie  skewers (Red onion, mushroom, bell pepper, cherry tomato, and pineapple) to go with it and brushed the leftover marinade plus a little extra olive oil and cilantro and served it over brown rice. It was such a light and filling summer meal.

made this dish and it was DELICIOUS!  I think the fresh cilantro really adds to the flavor.  I highly  recommend this recipe and I recommend Argentinian Shrimp as they are slightly bigger than regular shrimp but not as big as jumbo.

What learned was that if you have different sizes of shrimp; don’t mix sizes on your skewers. If not the small ones will be over cooked and the bigger ones under cooked. Sort them and stack them and cook accordingly. They’re really  yummy

I basically followed the list of ingredients (added more garlic and substituted Serrano peppers) and marinaded 30-40 minutes, but then sautéed rather than grilled (it’s a cold January).  Used these as appetizers with blue corn chips along with a bean and corn salsa.  Outstanding - very easy to sauté practically as guests walked in the door.  Raves all around.  Will definitely do this again.

Used 4-8 prawns. Substituted crushed red pepper over cayane pepper for a better presentation. Best part with the prawns being nearly 1/4lb each is no need to skewer. They curl up and open, looking like lobster tails.

I've got some pretty serious foodie friends  and they  were blown away! I was going to do my usual lemon-tarragon marinade but could find any decent fresh tarragon so I tried this recipe and it was amazing! It tastes like drinking the best Margarita you ever had while eating a delicious grilled shrimp.

Pretty good. Used cilantro fresh from my garden. After skewering the shrimp, I dug the cilantro out of the  marinade and left it on the shrimp for grilling.  Make sure to thoroughly soak the skewers, and they will burn up. I used deveined shrimp. Removed the shells, but left the tails on for easier finger eating.

Yes, I skewered this with fresh pineapple and green pepper.  I would suggest doing each element on its own skewer, starting with green pepper first, then add the pineapple skewers and then shrimp. That way each is cooked to perfection

Excellent. I doubled the tequila, cayenne pepper and garlic. I also cooked the shrimp in a cast iron skillet since I didn’t have skewers or a grill.   Absolutely delicious.

This was excellent. I served it with garlic lime rice and grilled broccoli, and scallion to garnish. Next time I will make a second batch of the marinade to make a sauce.

Two challenges for me: I don't own a grill, and cilantro tastes like soap! So a few modifications were needed. 

First, I used a little extra lime juice to give additional, non-soapy brightness to the dish. Next, I used the marinade mixture as a sauce. I heated it in a skillet until the garlic started sizzling, then tossed in the shrimp and sauteed until done. I removed the shrimp and let the sauce reduce a little.

I served the shrimp over orzo, which it turned out Mr. Pickypants wasn't fond of, and with a side of seasoned green beans and bell pepper. I really enjoyed it, and will definitely make it again!

These were delish.  i used lemon juice instead and only marinated them 30 minutes or so.  They were just as good the next day cold.  When i tasted the marinade before using it, i thought it was going to make the shrimp too hot from the cayenne pepper.  But it mellowed out and was very good.

I followed the recipe, but marinated the shrimp for a little over two hours instead of 30 minutes.  And I cooked it in a grill basket instead of on skewers.  I was surprised that the marinade did not add as much flavor as I anticipated,  but overall this wa very good.

I have made twice now. First time decided you need to double the tequila & marinate for 1 to 2 hours. Now I tried again & didn't have enough cilantro so at this time we're giving it a 3 stars rate.  I'm not sure but think I used lime juice from the bottle both times so I want to make sure I use a lime next time also to see if it makes a difference. I see great hope in this recipe but maybe it is just because it has tequila in it & everything taste better with tequila.

Really good. Definitely marinade for a little bit longer - the longer it sits in the marinade, the stronger the tequila flavor.

I made recipe without alterations (which is a first for me), but I grilled on a salt block for 3-4 mins.   So technically, I altered the recipe!  Left overs were delicious cold.

This recipe has made me famous among family and friends. I do cut back on the red pepper flakes since we aren't terribly spicy people.  I have also used my cast iron grill pan to cook them indoors. I get the pan nice and not, sprinkle on some olive oil and cook them 3 minutes each side = yummy, nice and juicy with attractive grill marks. Everyone wants the recipe. This one is definitely a keeper.  And I never keep track of how long I marinate - an hour at the longest!

This was very good! I have a 9 yr old whom I constantly battle about food...and he loved it! I used chicken breasts (again...picky eaters, ugh) which I cooked in the grill pan. As suggested by other reviews I added about 3-4 TBSP of tequila and a splash of OJ. Next time I will add some red pepper flakes for a little more heat. Great marinade!!

A very easy and simple marinade that enhances the shrimp but does not overpower it.

Excellent - we used HUGE shrimp (8 per pound) and I was a little worried the marinade would overpower the shrimp. We grilled them and served along with bacon-wrapped filet for a surf and turf Valentine's dinner. Perfection.

3-26-16... Added 3 Tbs of chili sauce, omitted salt and used the 1/4 tsp of cayenne and followed rest of recipe. Needs this to punch up the flavor. Doesn't remind me of a margarita, but tastes good! Might try adding some lime zest next time to get the  tangy flavor profile stronger.

We did take out the tequilla because we do not drink in our home but this is awesome! We have used this for grilling shrimp and pork chops. My kids beg for this almost weekly. We do use a bit more lime to give it more liquid.

Great shrimp! I hate to change a recipe but I don't consider this a change...I wouldn't marinate these shrimp for more than an hour and make sure you mix the ingredients before you throw in the shrimp. The lime juice starts to cook them if you don't. OTHER THAN THAT! PERFECT! and I wouldn't change a thing! Loved it and passed this one on to family memebers.

For some reason, the shrimp didn't soak up as much of the flavor as I was hoping it would. I overcooked it on accident (oops) so that may be part of it too, but the sauce was incredible and tasted really good over the rice

I made these shrimp skewers the same day I prepared the slow cooker barbecue ribs.  My family was coming over for a late summer evening dinner on the deck.  They were delicious just as is!!  Even my small grandchildren loved them.  I will definitely be making them again.  Might add even more garlic and cilantro next time.

Really, really good.  I do, however, prefer the recipe from here "Grilled Marinated Shrimp".  The name isn't as fancy, but the marinade is better.  Just my opinion.  This was very good though.  I liked the kick from the red pepper!

I think honestly I'd give it a 3 1/2 stars.  The first time I made it - I marinated the shrimp for 1 hour and couldn't taste anything.  On the 2nd go round, I marinated for 1/2 day and it was much better.  

I may make again, but will probably look for another recipe.

This was really good! Even my husband who normally turns up his nose at shrimp ate them like they were the best thing he had ever eaten. I made it exactly as the recipe instucted and I wouldn't change a thing.

Wow - what a big hit.  Didn't really know what to expect but everyone loved it.  I used the same marinade on scallops but didn't like it as much as on the shrimp.

My family really enjoyed.  Followed directions as written but next time I would probably add a little more red pepper to give it more of a kick.

These are good, I marinate them and then put them on kabobs and grill. I also used the marinade for the mushrooms & squash on the kabobs. Once I made them and did not have tequilla so I used vanilla rum and it got rave reviews. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was good if you love the taste of fresh cilantro. I grilled half of the shrimp and served the other half chilled.People liked them both ways.I, personally thought they were just OK. I like spicier food, so maybe more hot pepper if I make this again.
