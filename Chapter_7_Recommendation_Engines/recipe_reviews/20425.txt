These burgers turned out really good.  My husband makes his own version that is very similar to this recipe (using a little of this and that)...and I wanted to replicate it.  Suprisingly enough, this came very close to his.  I used dry herbs and threw in some cilantro and green onions.  I used a bit more salt than what the recipe called for and used ground pork rather than lamb.  I've never cooked with lamb before...simply because I never see it at our grocery store.  I was given several compliments and plan on making this again.  Thanks for sharing Alan.

Fabulous flavor. I wouldn't change a thing to the recipe for the burgers. Even when cooked all the way through the meat was so tender and juicy. The only thing I did differently was I made some homemade tzaziki yogurt sauce and added a spoonful or two of that to the burger and feta in the grilled pita pocket. This will be a new favorite for the grill! Thanks Alan.

Mighty tasty burgers! I substituted dark corn syrup for the molasses, and white wine for the sherry. Very good - and the burgers held together well on the grill. Just let them cook well before turning over.

Yummy, Yummy, Yummy!! I raise sheep, so always have lots of lamb on hand and I am always looking for good lamb recipes. This one is great. I didn't have any fresh mint, so used 3 mint tea bags (make sure it has no additives) also, I had no sherry or wine so used angastura bitters. This lamb burger was so tasty and did hold together well. My family gave it 5 stars, even the kids. Will serve this often this coming summer. Thanks for the great recipe.

These were fantastic - even with the variety of substitutions I had to make (7 mos pregnant and not keen on the idea of a special trip to the store).  I substituted fresh thyme and rosemary for the cilantro and mint, honey for the molasses, a good squeeze of lemon juice as I was going for a Greek flavour.  The mix was a bit dry so I added a beaten egg and a handful of breadcrumbs and they were delicious! Can't wait to try the original recipe.  Thanks Alan.

Excellent! Based on the other reviews, I doubled the recipe, and I'm glad I did. I love grilled lamb, and I'll make this one again. I didn't have sherry. I used some white wine instead. I happened to have pomegranate molasses, so I used that instead. Goes great with salad and wine. If you like grilled lamb, you'll love this recipe.

We love our food highly seasoned, and these were wonderful for our first meal from the 4-H market lamb that we had just picked up from the butcher! These will become a must-have in our home! Served with tzatziki sauce, they were stupendous!

Ooh so goood! Made it exactly as written, I didn't find it to be dry at all (and I'm one to usually overcook things on the grill!). Served it with tzaziki (?sp) by Jolie, perfect to balance the spiciness, and a Greek salad. Red wine to drink, and what a satifying meal! Thanks, Alan.

I made these just as written. They were not to my liking. Way too much going on w/ these burgers. You can't even taste the lamb, might as well be using ground turkey or pork ;) TOO many spices in this that are overpowering, and they are not spicy at all. No one liked them. Next time I want a lamb burger, I'll just make a lamb burger: nothing needed but S & P.

I made these into mini burgers for a BBQ party we had, then served with mini pita breads and tzatziki (no feta). Everyone LOVED them! They were so fantastically flavoured - the spices are spot-on! I will definitely make these again. Thank you Alan!

This recipe is GREAT!!  Had to sub ground pork as no lamb was available, but changed nothing else in the burgers.  Added homemade tzaziki to the pita with the feta... my husband, who was expecting "a hamburger on a bun" RAVED... and said "make this again... but try to find the lamb so we can compare!"

Absolutely delicious.  A very nice change up from the regular burger.  The combination of herbs and spices are just the right mix--there's a hint of everything, but nothing is overpowering.  Served these with sauteed red onion, spinach and tomato and feta with lightly toasted bun.  My wife raved about these burgers and I did too. Will definitely make these again!  Sweet 'tater fries were a nice side.

This is one of the most unusual and delicious recipes I have tried.  You have got to try this.  Totally yummy!  Just make sure the pitas that you buy open up well.  Mine didn't.  Thank you Alan.

My husband and I loved the flavor of these burgers and I'm not a huge fan of lamb. I would have given them a five except they ended up a little dry.
Update: I fixed the dryness issue. The first time I made these was on a George Foreman type indoor grill. The nexxt time I made these I opened it up flat and it made a huge difference.

YOU ARE A GENIUS! we live in the middle east (so lamb is really inexpensive) and my husband made these tonight. They were amazing, the best burgers he has ever made. For those looking to make them, do not skip the molasses and keep true to the recipe. You will not be disappointed

I served this during one of our crazy roof deck parties this year.  OMG!!! Delicious!!! Everyone at the party goobled them down quickly.  We made them into sliders and we couldn't keep up with the demand.  The only thing we replaced was the pita, we opted for regular burger buns instead.  Next time I will try the same ingridients on ground beef or pork.  The price for lamb here in NY is a killer!  Nevertheless, I don't regret spending the money since everyone enjoyed the dish!! Thanks Alan!

This was quite possibly the best hamburger I've ever eaten in my life! Instead of pita I used regular hamburger buns (grilled, of course!), adorned with lettuce and tomato-- but I added grilled, carmelized onions...OMG! As with so many other ppl, I couldn't find ground lamb in any of the supermarkets here in Puebla, Mexico; but I went to the local "mercado" where everything sold there is the absolute freshest, and asked the butcher to grind some lamb for me.  I made a bunch of these burgers, wrapped them individually and stuck 'em in the freezer for an awesome quick meal whenever!

These are excellent!!  I didn't have sherry or molasses and I added a minced clove of garlic, but otherwise went with the recipe as written.  I had made some tzatziki sauce with some homegrown cucumbers which went wonderfully with them.  

I spread (with difficulty) some fat free feta on the pita rounds.  I learned that fat free feta does not spread and does not melt and has no taste.  :-)  Best to use regular feta or skip it all together, IMHO.

But anyway, five stars - excellent ground lamb preparation.

These were good, but I don't think I like lamb as much as I thought I did.  I think I'll try this same recipe with ground turkey or beef next time.  Lamb has a very strong flavor to me, but surprisingly, these were less strong the next day (less lamb taste, and more flavorful with the herbs and spices).  I omitted the red pepper flakes, and decreased the pepper to 1/4 tsp. to make it less spicy.  Serving these with tzatziki sauce is definitely key, as some suggested.  Thanks for the recipe!

I don't normally eat lamb 'cause they're so darn cute running around bleating and what not, but I made an exception with this recipe. The green herbs looked real pretty and tasted even better. Not real strong and gamey like you'd expect. It's a little dry without some kind of dressing, so I poured on some Italian dressing from a bottle. Overall, not baaaad.

These were fantastic.  Definitely a little spicy (almost too much for me, but my other half loved!).  I was told that it was "restaurant quality", something he'd expect from one of our high end burger places.

I did make a couple of minor changes.  Due to rain, I was unable to grill, so I cooked for 5 min. on the George Foreman grill, set to med/high. These were done.  I like mine a little more on the rare side, so I will probably reduce the time if I cook them like that again.  Also, I used Naan Bread instead of pita bread, and folded it over.  It was absolutely delicious.  We added spinach leaves and tomato slices.  I didn't need anything else, but I have it on good autority that this was also fabulous with horseradish.  :)

These were great!  I realized as I was making them that I was out of molasses, but they were still wonderful.  My 19-month-old neice even loved them.  Will make again.

Great even if you're not a lamb fan.  No substitutions on the meat - perfect as is. I didn't have pita so I used hamburger buns and made some tzaziki yogurt sauce.  Nice change from the usual.

These were fantastic. I never have cooked lamb before and it was so tasty. The spices gave it a nice kick. Thinking of adding the tzatziki yogurt sauce next time too. Everyone loved them.

I don't usually have fresh cilantro or mint so leave those out.  I also add an egg to the meat and the coarsely chopped feta instead of putting feta on top.  Makes four good sized burgers.  Makes a good low carb main dish and i usually serve it with broiled eggplant slices that are seasoned with curry powder and paprika.  Love the spice!

Very flavorful, very tasty!  Had to make a few minor substitutions but I don't think they were detrimental. Basil for mint, white wine for sherry, brown sugar for molasses, muenster for feta -- it's all good. Someone complained in another review that there was too much going on with all the herbs and spices, and maybe so, but it's a great combination.  Would a straight lamb burger be good? Sure, knock yourself out. But this was a dang good burger!

EXCELLENT recipe!  I doubled the meat, used basil instead of cilantro, used 1/2 the red pepper flakes and accidentally mixed the feta with the meat.  Served with tzatziki and salad.  Yummy!!  I'll be making these again fer shur!

Per another reviewer I made these into cocktail appetizer by making mini meatballs and serving with a yogurt/cucumber dipping sauce.  Baked at 400 for about 13-15 minutes.  Great flavor!

Why have I never made this before now?!? This is delicious. Amazing. GLORIOUS. I never would have believed it... but get to chopping (add a little more garlic and maybe a hot pepper) and this is the perfect burger. The first time I made this, I was tempted to eat it every day for a week. So many different spices melting together for perfection. Eat it in a pita - eat it on a potato bun - just EAT IT!!!

This tasted even better than my mother-in-law's Greek Meatballs (which follows a very similar format), and I think the addition of the molasses and cilantro is what did it!  Extremely flavorful. Will definitely make again in a heartbeat!  Two substitutions: 1) to make the burgers stretch, we added one egg and 3/4 cup bread crumbs. 2) We didn't have feta or pita bread, so we served it on grilled garlic toast (butter both sides of bread, sprinkle with garlic powder, and grill til crisp)--DELICIOUS and highly recommended substitute!

Holy lamb! I made these for my family and neighbors and they gobbled them up. I used all fresh herbs from my herb garden and lamb from the farmer's market, so it could not get any fresher. Everyone raved that the flavor was better than any gyro they had ever had.   The only thing I did differently was used 1 t. of cider vinegar instead of a t. of white wine vinegar and a t. of sherry as I did not have either. I think as long as there is a little acid, all is well.  I also put the feta in the meat instead of on top.   I paired it with the tzatzikiII recipe from this site which really complemented the meat well. We highly recommend it!

WOW, I couldn't believe how well the mint complimented the lamb.  I topped with carmalized onions and homemade tzaziki yougurt (both from this site)- after tasting this dish I wanted to go slap somebody! - That good!

My husband screwed up his nose as I brought in all the herbs from the garden.  Green didn't belong in his meat and potatoes.  But I warmed up some fresh pitas, spread them with hummus and tzatziki, topped them with a traditional Greek salad, and put the patties and feta on top of it all like a giant taco.  He wolfed it all down, and asked me to double the recipe next time.

We were supposed to be cooking these on the barbecue tonight but typical English weather it's raining. So ended up cooking them indoors. Really tasty made no alterations and I don't think any are needed. Had tzatziki sauce on top of them which was just perfect. Will definitely make these for our next barbecue. Thanks.

This was very good!  I used pomegranate molasses, and doubled the amount of chopped mint and cilantro.  I also added an egg because the mixture was quite crumbly.  Since I don't have a grill, I shaped the mixture into 20 meatballs in a pyrex dish, and baked them for 25 minutes at 400 F.  We had them in pita with feta and tomato, drizzled with homemade tzatziki and a couscous version of tabouleh.  Yum!

I made so many substitutions to this recipe to fit what I had on-hand, that I'm not sure this review counts, but here goes.  I used chopped lamb loin instead of ground lamb, used light corn syrup instead of molasses, omitted the allspice and sherry, and used a lot more vinegar.  I then marinated the lamb with some whole roma tomatoes in the mixture for about 1 hr, then cooked it kabob style on the grill.  I put the tomatoes and the lamb in the pita shells with some feta cheese.  It was very tangy with a kick.  We loved it.  I'd like to try this again with ground lamb.

These were excellent--juicy and flavorful, without the spices overpowering that incomparable charred lamb-y taste.  We ate them tucked into pita with feta cheese, spicy mustard, lettuce and fresh cilantro.  I would recommend using *pomegranate* molasses in this recipe--available at middle-eastern grocery stores.

I made these into mini meatballs and baked at 400 deg for ~15 min. as another reviewer suggested. Lamb has a lot of fat, so I was glad I added parchment paper to my sheets which helped to absorb some of it. I like spicy, but these were just a bit spicy for me, so I'd cut back on the spices the next time. I had some homemade cucumber spread on hand, so I used that in place of the tzaziki sauce. It offset the heat of the lamb very well. Also added a few tblsp of fresh basil. Thanks, Alan, very good recipe! UPDATE 11/15/15: Much better cutting back on black pepper & red pepper flakes. Note to self: Add 1-2 TBLSP of milk for some moisture, or maybe an egg (fat bakes out then seems a little dry). Less cumin, too.

These burgers were amazing! I made them into mini burgers, using a 1/3c measuring cup to get them a consistent size. I mixed up some cilantro mayo with a little lime juice added for extra flavor, to top the burger. Wow. This recipe is a keeper.

Excellent! I made a few substitutions since I was missing ingredients:
2tbl parsley instead of mint
1/2 tea garlic powder instead of garlic
1 tea apple cider/apple juice instead of sherry
1 tea lemon juice instead of white wine vinegar
1 tea karo dark corn syrup instead of molasses
1/8 tea cinnamon + 1/8 tea nutmeg instead of allspice
I used regular buns and topped them with sharp cheddar cheese, red onion, lettuce, tomato, and mayo. I didn't know it was possible to make such a great burger myself!

Tasty & easy. Since we didn't have any lamb, we used hamburger. I added a little tomato & cucumber dressing on my burger, but hubby had his as recipe is written. Will make again for sure.

These were fantastic - I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband thought they were too "lamb-y" and he grew up on a sheep farm so that's saying something, but they were great for me. Definitely a strong lamb taste so if you're not into lamb, give these a miss or use different meat.

I've made twice now and everyone loves! Even my very picky friend from Turkey who doesn't like anything. Last time I tried with half lamb/half ground beef and it worked just as well.

These were perfect! I made no changes. Served with diced cucumber, tomato, onion, and feta cheese tossed in lemon juice and olive oil (topped with tzatziki). Made great addition to our Greek style pitas. Just like Gyros.

These were excellent.  I couldn't fine fresh oregano, so I just used 2 tsp of dried.  We had hamburger buns, so we slathered them with tzatziki and crumbled feta.  The only thing I would do differently next time, is to double the recipe.  The burgers were kind of small, or we're just big eaters!

One of the best recipes I've come across on this site.  I had to make several modifications to suit the personal tastes (rather, work around the dislikes) of my family.  I added chopped vidalia onion, eliminated the cilantro and the mint.  I put out tzatziki sauce, tomatoes, and sliced vidalia for garnishes and it was a huge hit.

Our office enjoyed these for lunch today. The combination of feta, pita, and lamb were incredible! No other condiments needed really! Great idea for lighter fare at any summer BBQ!

Would make again! Could have used more heat. Garnished with raw red onion, mixed greens and used a nice moist feta. I was considering using fig preserve and or mustard as a condiment but didn't.

I gave it 3 stars because my husband loved it, he said. Im looking for a way to make lamb, that does not taste like lamb. I would not say it was easy, due to the number of ingredients that had to be used. But is was not difficult.

This was delicious!  I subbed a tbs brown sugar for the molasses, and a splash of red wine for the sherry, and the burgers turned out perfectly.  Great flavours!

Great alternative to your average burger. I made this for my boyfriend and he and I both loved them. The only thing I changed was to leave out the mint... Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.

Excellent lamb burgers! I grew up eating lamb, and this is my favorite lamb burger recipe I've ever had.  I used dry oregano (cut in half).  I also put sliced cucumbers and plain yogurt on the bun.  Definitely making again!

If you want something different than a beef burger, these are great. If you think it's going to taste like beef, it doesn't at all and you will be disapointed.

Wow!!  These were SO good!  Everyone-- from those who love lamb, to those who had never tried lamb-- loved them.  I served them in pitas with feta cheese and Tzatziki Sauce II from this site (I added a little lemon juice to the sauce, used fat-free yogurt and didn't strain it).  Really delicious!!

The only changes I made were that I used oregano flakes instead of fresh, and that I did not use sherry. Everything turned out well, especially because I like lamb.

We had this a couple of days ago. My husband asked me not to make again but I would make it again for me with just half the herbs, the full amount of herbs was a bit overwhelming. One thing he did love is the feta. Now I am asked to use feta on all burgers.

We raise our own lambs/sheep and I am always left with a surplus of ground lamb in the freezer. I tried this recipe and it was such a hit that even my picky 6 year old loved it.  I didn't have cilantro, so I used fresh rosemary and some chives as well and ground all the fresh herbs in a mini food processor.  All of the flavors combined with the lamb were just beautiful and I added caramelized sweet onions to the tops of the burger and they were to die for!!

Made this tonight for a party of 10 and they loved them.  They said that they would eat this burger over a regular beef burger anytime.  I used red wine vinegar because I was out of white.  I also added red onions to the recipe.

I thought this recipe was delicious.  I followed it but stuffed the burgers with Alouette sun-dried tomato cheese spread.  It was great.   The Alouette cheese kept the burgers extremely moist and added extra flavor that complimented the spices in the burger.

This was a good burger. Using only lamb was a little too much for me so next I will mix with half beef or pork and I think it will be much better.
Must use tzsiki sauce with this one for the best flavor

I cook ground lamb and serve it to my dogs all the time, but never thought of it as a delicious meal for the rest of my family until now...this recipe is stellar!  We don't have a grill, so I used a skillet, preheated for one minute and brushed with a bit of cooking oil.  I then cooked the burgers for 5 minutes on each side.  I placed them in a baking dish and cooked them in a preheated (300 F) oven for an additional 5 minutes, along with the pita bread.  Along with the feta cheese, I filled the pita bread with thinly sliced cucumbers, diced tomatoes and a dressing I made with plain yogurt and finely chopped onions.  It tasted GREAT...this recipe is a definite keeper in my collection!

Very easy to make, although between a few stores around here I couldn't find gather more than 1 lb of lamb meat, so make sure to call a few days ahead to order some.  Everyone, and I mean everyone, who came to my BBQ raved about this lamb burger recipe.  I'm not much of a cook, but this recipe made me feel temporarily like the greatest cook in the world!  Thanks!

Unbelievable!  Had some ground lamb in the freezer and made these last evening.  Substituted chopped fresh parsley for the mint and dried oregano.  My husband wanted more (he had already moaned through two burgers).  I would suggest cutting down a bit on the salt!

It was lovely. Doubled the lamb based on reviews and used ground red pepper instead of flakes. Husband loved it but kids said it was spicy. They ate it with ketchup....kids.

this was very tasty.. i used ground turkey (1.25 lbs) instead of the lamb.. and left out the oregano b/c i was worried it would be overpowering.. i also left out the molasses and sherry as i don't carry either usually.. and used 1.5 tsp of kosher salt for the regular.. i had mine straight up and bf had his in tortillas (we're socal).. ty for the recipe

These bad boys are great. They DO have a lot going on at once, and I think a slightly simpler recipe could be just as tasty. I didn't use the sherry (none available)but I still liked them a lot.

Yum!!! We altered the recipe a bit: used minced rosemary (fresh) instead of cilantro, because we're not fans of cilantro; used red wine (a cab sav) instead of sherry, simply because we had a bottle open and wanted to use it up; used 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper instead of red pepper flakes, which we didn't have on hand; and omitted the allspice. But man oh man were these burgers delicious! This was our first time trying to make our own lamb burgers, after having loved some real gems at restaurants, and this recipe made us wonder what took us so long to try it ourselves. The only thing we'll do different next time is cook them a little less time. We did 4 minutes per side, and that gave us burgers brown all the way through, but still juicy. But I prefer some pink in the middle, so next time we'll maybe try between 2 and 3 minutes per side. We served with tzaziki (using a video recipe also on this site, which was produced by foodwishes.blogspot.ca, where the actual ingredients and amounts are written out). Feta, I think, might overwhelm the pure goodness of these patties. Taste the burgers first, before deciding whether to add feta. You may find, as we did, that it's completely unnecessary.

inadvertently included fresh chopped peppermint as opposed to cilantro in asparagus sauce, which started with lemon-lime buerre blanc thickened with roux.  Added equal amount of cilantro, and it was delicious on both grilled asparagus as well as on the lamb burgers

I took out the cilantro, sherry, molassess and red pepper flakes and it was still good.  I used balsamic vinegar because that was what I had on hand.  Great taste, makes delicious and juicy burgers.

These are awesome!!!  The only thing I didn't put in burgers was the mint (didn't have any).  Used hamburger buns instead of pitas, and served with Dianah's tzaziki (sp?) sauce that rocks!  One of the best burgers I have ever made.  This would probably be just as good with ground beef, will try with that too.  Served with sliced garden tomatoes and just picked corn on the cob....what a wonderful, simple dinner.  Delicous!!  Do try, you will not be disappointed.

So Good!!  The only changes I made (since I didn't have it) was I used white wine for the sherry and the vinegar and also couldn't find fresh oregano so used my ground oregano.  I doubled the recipe and made some into burgers and made some into big meat balls in the oven (just to see if it was as good- and to fit nicely into the warm pita pockets)  Serving with fresh garden tomatoes, red onions, and Chef Johns tzatzik- and the frozen Alexa spicy sweet potato fries!!

This was really good. Didn't have mint or cilantro available so left it out. Otherwise I made it as the recipe described.  Made them into meatballs and baked in the oven. This was the first time I had ever eaten lamb and I will definitely make again.

Very good burgers, but if you aren't a fan of spicy foods, you may want to cut back on the crushed peppers. My husband love spicy food, so we enjoyed the heat but it may be too hot for some people. I followed the recipe exactly as written, and as it was good, the next time I make it I am going to leave out the oregano, did not care for the flavor of it.

Didn't have Feta cheese so I used mozzarella which I melted on top of the burgers on the grill. My husband and son loved it. Will make again for sure.

I cooked the feta inside the burger, and I didn't have all-spice, but it was delish either way. Very juicy. I was able to just cook in a frying pan and they turned out great. My one year old even liked them.

Made these as written-- they were delicious!  Top with tzatziki recipe from this site for a great accenting flavor.

I have never written a review, but I have to write in to agree. I made this per the recipe, but added basil, frersh chives and cardamom. I added feta and tatziki and made both burgers and meatballs on the grill. My husband and children LOVED it and I wasn't even sure the kids would eat lamb. My husband is a great cook and he said this was the best burger he has ever had. A happy family tonight.

Good.  Same texture as regular (beef) burgers, perhaps a bit less juicy (meat was lean - only kind I could find for ground lamb).  Pita idea is neat but make sure you have large enough pitas or ones that open up well, it was a bit messy.  Used whole wheat pitas.  Used Greek feta with basil/tomato flavours.  Used mirin instead of sherry, rice vinegar instead of white wine vinegar.  Added lettuce as topping.  You don't need normal burger toppings, these are flavourful enough.  Serve with a salad or chips and hot sauce.
