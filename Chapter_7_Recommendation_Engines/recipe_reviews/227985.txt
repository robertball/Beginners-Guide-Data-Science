Hubs and I could never eat a full (or even half)  recipe of this before we either got sick of it or the cobbler topping got soggy.  So...I scaled the recipe down to two servings and, using just strawberries and rhubarb, baked this in individual ramekins for 20 minutes.  I didn't have tapioca so I substituted flour, 1-1/2 times as much.  I didn't have raw sugar either, but ordinary white sugar worked just fine.  I really liked that this was not overly spiced - the hint of cinnamon was just enough.  A minor and subjective criticism because these are delicious and SO cute, but I found the topping a little skimpy - next time I'll make another half recipe of it.

made this for a church gathering.

I was concerned at first as there seemed to be a lot left over, then came the seconds and WHAM! it was gone!

Huge hit.

I have a 5 serving amount baking in the oven right now. I didn't have raw sugar so I used my vanilla bean infused white sugar. I used 1/2 a tablespoon extra of my instant tapioca for a thicker sauce. I also love cinnamon in the dough, so I doubled that amount. I thought that this didn't make enough of the dough topping so I doubled that recipe as well. 
I was wondering how I could use my rhubabrb, strawberries and blueberries all at once so I am really happy to come across this recipe. It smells amazing and I will attempt to post my result picture after it comes out. 

*additional comment after pulling out of the oven* 
Thickened up nicely, didn't bubble over at all. (that's a good thing)I baked for 45 minutes, but my oven bakes fast so next time I will go a solid 40 minutes.Just the right amount of sweetness too.

Just pulled this out of the oven.  Stuck the spoon in the corner to give it a taste.  YUMMY!  Substitued Agave syrup for the sugar.  Looks like it will thicken nicely.  Now, to see how the kids like it.

This was very good.  I used 2 cups blueberries, 1 cup strawberries and 3 1/2 cups rhubarb.  My only issue was that the tapioca did not get very soft or thicken very well.  Next time I will use cornstarch and more topping.

I made this for a church picnic, and a small one for home.  I didn't have any strawberries so I just used additional blueberries.  I also added chopped  pecans in the crumb topping.  With homemade whipped cream (I use local honey to sweeten the heavy cream) it was a hit.  Never made it past the first 25 people going through the buffet line.  I will definite be making this again!

My suggestion would be to double the cobbler part and no tapioca and replace with cornstarch. We personally like it a little loose with more cobbler.

Little bit of shortbread type crust and a flavor explosion of berries, not too sweet!  Absolutely must have with a bit of good old vanilla ice cream!

Very nice, but don't eat this warm from the oven if you prefer it firm.  It firms up as it cools.  I doubled the topping and might just halve the filling next time.  I liked it but it made for a lot, and it overflowed my pan.  I'm glad I put it on top of the pizza stone, which caught all the juices, but I'm thinking either my pan wasn't the correct size or this just bubbles up and over a lot.  Either way, there's still a lot of filling to the doubled topping and I like my cobbler a bit more balanced between topping and filling.  Delicious combo, though, and a great use of the rhubarb we got from hubs' parents.  Thanks for the recipe!

Well, I made this as written and I thought it was fine, but guests couldn’t deal with rhubarb.  I guess it’s “either or” on that.  For those who can’t get their hands on tapioca, I understand! I made my own version of this 25 years ago when I lived in Switzerland, where I had access to rhubarb and strawberries but no tapioca. I used potato starch instead, as I was accustomed to using it in my cheese fondue; it is finer than cornstarch, and does not cloud the clarity of fruit sauces or fruit pies.  Use the same amount as you would corn starch.  I have never used tapioca, but I have used rice but not in this dessert.  But back to the point; potato starch or arrow root, which is even finer than potato starch can also be used.  Arrow root is the more common thickener used in Chinese food sauces like sweet and sour sauce; it is wonderfully clear, but corn starch would cloud it up, and potato starch too, but to a lesser degree.  I appreciate this recipe as I don’t have that cobbler recipe from 25 years ago. I’ll never forget the flavor, though!

Really good. We liked it even better the next day.  I made it using Truvia instead of sugar and it turned out great.
