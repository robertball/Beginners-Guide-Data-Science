If you want to try bringing this to an even better state of Nirvana: Use only 1/2 lb of beef and add 1/2 pound of ground pork. Also replace skim milk with 1/2 a cup of ricotta cheese. I think you'll find you'll have some moister more flavorful meatballs.

I've been using LTH's recipe for some time now and its my staple. I have subbed an egg for the milk without any problems. Also, I never have seasoned bread crumbs so I just up the Italian seasoning (can't tell you by how much cause I don't measure this recipe anymore). If I'm just making this for myself, I add some additional sriacha for more heat (or if I don't have the Frank's at home) I bake these on a slightly greased cookie sheet and flip halfway. These freeze great cooked or raw. Oh and I've used 80/20, 90/10, and 95/5 beef with these and they've all turned out great. Thanks for the recipe!!!

Thank you , everyone, for the glowing reviews!  We at the LTH house LOVE these meatballs!  I almost always at least triple the recipe when I make it so I can freeze a few bags of meatballs.  I bake and then freeze the baked meatballs.  I'm kinda lazy (ok, a lot lazy) and never feel like taking the time to place the cooked meatballs on a cookie sheet, freeze them, then bag them. I'm lucky if I let them cool before I toss them in a freezer bag and chuck 'em in the freezer.  I freeze them in freezer bags without sauce.  It makes for crazy easy meals when no one planned ahead/feels like cooking! These do have a nice bite, so adjust the crushed red and hot pepper sauce (Red Hot at our house) to YOUR tastes.  I also rarely ever feel like dicing an onion (I'm lazy, remember?) so I usually sub dried minced.  I also tend to forget that my aversion to black pepper is generally abnormal, so, if you're not a freak like me, you may choose to add some black pepper, too!  Come as you are and enjoy Meatball Nirvana!  :)

Hubs wanted meatballs as part of our "SuperBowl Smorgasbord."  I have my own way of making meatballs, but since I was using these on their own rather than with spaghetti, I kind of wanted to try something completely different, and in terms of how I make my Italian meatballs, these are different. Italian seasoning, oregano, garlic salt, hot pepper sauce and Worcerstershire sauce are all different additions for me and, other than omitting the red pepper and hot sauce in consideration of Hubs' sensitive innards, I resisted the strong urge to make these more compliant with what I was familiar with.  I popped half of one in my mouth and "Mmmm!" ran through my mind. They have a nice balance of flavors that will only get better once the flavors develop even further in my homemade tomato sauce, I thought.  I had Hubs taste the other half and the first word out of his meatball stuffed mouth was, "Yum!" (Trust me, he NEVER says "yum")  I've got more cooking to do to complete our smorgasbord (Go Pack!!!) but these meatballs are going to be one, fine contribution.  Way to go (again!) LovestoHost!

Excellent meatball recipe. This is good in homemade BBQ sauce or a good marinara and also in meatball sandwiches. Dosen't matter how you use it, it always turns out fantastic. This also works well with ground turkey or chicken and even adding a little italian sausage is good, too. I do like to use my own homemade italian seasoning and homemade seasoned bread crumbs (brush day old bread with garlic butter, bake until crispy, then run through the food processor until finely ground) in this recipe I also do what LTH does and double it because either my boys eat them all up or I'll make one batch and freeze the other. If you have any leftovers, it's even better the next day. GOOD STUFF.

This recipe gets 5 stars for balance of ingredients and flavor... but gets 3 stars for instructions.  The ingredients balance well, and the meatballs have a great taste.  There are a few things I experimented with to improve this recipe.  First, I reduced the salt, and used garlic powder (not garlic salt).  I also did not dice the onion, I grated the onion on a small grater, and grated it over the bowl, so the onion juices blended into the meatballs, and you're not left with large bits of onion.  One of the biggest steps is to combine all the ingredients EXCEPT the beef, and allow this mixture to sit for 5 minute before including the beef.  This way, the bread crumbs absorb the moisture of the milk and the flavors blend.  Once you're ready to mix the beef in, use only your fingertips, and blend gently being careful not to over-blend.  Taking this step, you create a more moist, light and delicate meatball.  The instructions as written in this recipe will likely cause the meatball to get dry, dense, and hard.  Again, delicious balance of flavors, but the method of mixing the meatballs is not the best.

Great recipe for meatballs!  I used minced garlic instead of garlic salt, 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes (was adding hot sausage to the sauce as well and didn't want things too spicy), and used an egg in place of the skim milk.  This was a nice change from my usual meatball recipe - thanks LTH!

LOVE! I've never been 100% satisfied with any meatball recipe until now. The kick from the crushed red pepper and hot sauce really make these something special. I served them on hoagie rolls with sauce and cheese. Delicious. I might even go so far as to say that they deserve a fist pump.... ;) Thanks LTH!

My kids was served this with Nana's Pasta sauce by EAKE, and my son said it was better then Subway's meatball sub. WOW, is what I thought. 3 of my kids had 2 hot dog size meatball subs a piece. And I tried the meatballs myself and thought it was delicious by slightly on the salty side, I think I would omit the salt the next time I make these(for my prefences) It had such a wonderful aroma of flavors. I really enjoyed it. However, my kids said it was slightly spice on some crunchy pieces but I guess that means the red pepper flakes. But all agreed it was loved. I think possibly use cayenne powder in the place of the red pepper flakes just for them. But I saw no problems with the red pepper flakes....but I have to apease to the children. I will so keep this recipe in my box, because not only was it good, it's the 1st meatball I've ever made that was cooked all the way through and moist, not hard or stiff. Thanks lovetohost.

I have had this recipe saved for the longest time, and I finally got around to making it.  I followed this to the letter, and I can't fathom any changes I would possible make.  Let me tell you a little something about me and meatballs- I have a torrid love affair with them.  The ultimate in comfort food, I love them on top of spaghetti (all covered with cheese), on hoagies, and, if they are good enough, all by their lonesome.  I made these knowing they were going straight into the freezer, but I had to try one.  Then two.  Then my kid wandered into the kitchen, and we talked shoes and boys, all the while stuffing meatballs in our faces.  Yes.  They are THAT good.  I tried them on spaghetti- awesome.  Next, I will create a meatball hoagie the likes of which would make an Italian Grandma weep.  I love, nay, I ADORE these meatballs!  Thank you lovestohost- there may be other meatballs in my life from time to time, but I will secretly be longing for these whilst I eat those lowly wannabes :)

These are the best tasting meatballs we have ever eaten!!!  We followed the recipe as written and used a large cookie scoop to keep them equal shaped.  The kids loved to roll them into a ball.  They had tons of flavor, next time I might try to cook them in sauce for spaghetti and meatballs.  However you use these you will not be dissapointed!!  Great recipe.

I took a leap of faith and quadrupled this recipe and it was worth the risk! Sooo wonderful! I used ground sirloin. I was alittle worried about not using any egg but I followed the recipe to a "T" other than using fresh garlic and reducing the crushed red pepper to a 1/4 proportionally to suit my family. I made a pot of sauce and had pasta and subs last week. I intended to freeze them in bags but ended up making family size portioned containers and froze them in my sauce. Gave one to DD and she loved them. Each pound made a dozen meatballs slightly larger than a golfball. I have a convection oven so 15 minutes cooked them nicely. Thanks LTH, I will be making these again soon!! (As long as the fam doesn't OD on them in the mean time!)

Fantastic!! I have prepared dozens of recipes off of this site - some have even become staple meals at my home and I have never left a review. These meatballs are great! Only minor changes on my part. 
I used 2lbs lean ground beef and 1lb ground pork sausage. I basically tripled the other ingredients (I am not a seasoning measurer). I omitted pepper sauce and cut down on pepper flakes ONLY because of my kids - would have added if making for adults. I only double the seasoned bread crumbs (1 cup) and used oatmeal (1/2 cup) to finish what I needed, as I don't like the taste of the pre-seasoned breadcrumbs. Needed a little more milk. 
This made 40 meatballs larger than a golf ball. Filled my jellyroll pan. I baked for 10 minutes, then moved a little more than half of them to my pot of spagetti sauce to finish cooking on simmer. I finished baking the other half as directed and used them for meatball sandwiches the next day. 
For the meatball sandwiches, I LIGHTLY buttered split french bread, sprinkled with garlic powder, covered both sides with mozzarella and fresh parmesean cheeses and broiled till bubbly. put warmed meatballs on bread and drizzle with warmed marinara sauce - YUM! Next time, I will tear fresh basil UNDER the cheese before broiling.
Thanks lovestohost!

We love these meatballs!  We've been making them for over a year now and they are perfect for our family as my son is allergic to eggs and this is one of the only recipes I've found that doesn't include eggs.  I decrease the pepper flakes to just a pinch since my three year old is eating them.  They have a nice flavor compared to a lot of other meatballs I've tried that seem rather bland.  Thanks for the recipe, LTH!

This meatball recipe is fantastic! For those that have reviewed my recipe reviews, I double or triple the garlic which I did for this recipe. Everything else, I followed to a T and then added 2 eggs which my Italian family has always done which bulks up the meatball a bit while baking. 

I then quickly put together a meat sauce with 1 Tbsp of extra virgin olive oil, 1 Tbsp of garlic, 1/2 cup of onions, salt and pepper to taste (let these cook until the onion has lost its whiteness), 1 C of organic ground beef (cook until brown), then added 1 24 oz can of stewed/chopped tomatoes, 4 fresh tomatoes in which I blanched, chopped, and added to the sauce, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, 1/4 cup of red wine (the stronger the better). 

I then used the water from the blanched tomatoes to cook the Fettucine (which adds a delicious infused taste), and when the meatballs were done, I added them to the sauce.

Dinner was great and I'll definitely be using the recipe again. THANKS!

I have been looking for a meatball recipe for as long as I've been cooking---at least 25 years! I can't ground pork where I live, so I used 80/20 sirloin. These were by far the best meatballs I have EVER made. I only used 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes and they were still too hot for me---but other than that, they were perfect. I didn't change a thing, except I used Club cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs.  These meatballs were reminiscent of Flora's, an old Italian eatery I frequented as a kid. I've been trying to reproduce that flavor. These are so moist, not dry at all (I mixed everything for about 20 seconds with my hand mixer to keep it from getting dense and tough). I cannot wait to try them on crusty Italian bread with marinara and melted mozzarella!

Delicious! Made these for my hubby and his father and they loved them! I used more than a lb of ground sirloin 90/10 and added more ingredients as needed. Mixed with sauce and served over pasta and it was an amazing dinner. Will definitely make again

Outstanding recipe! I'm not sure why other people choose to leave out the red pepper flakes and hot sauce.  It does NOT make it spicy, it only adds an additional layer of flavor that makes this recipe even more awesome!  Made them with spaghetti sauce and pasta and it was a big hit!

LTH, I tip my hat to you and this recipe. I looked at these meat balls so many times, but have never made meat balls without eggs as a binder (or following a recipe-it's always a handful of this and splash of that). I bit the bullet and tried them. They are great!! Nicely spiced and they held together wonderfully. I had minestrone soup minus the noodles left over from the weekend. I pureed it in the food processor, added tomato paste and a few fresh tomatoes. Cooked the meatballs in  the oven, transferred them to a crock pot with my new sauce and left them alone to get aquainted. Served over spaghetti with garlic toasts. My only regret is not trying these sooner. Next on the menu will be to master balls into Swedish meatballs. Thanks for the recipe.

These meatballs were delicious! I've been looking for a good Italian Meatball recipe for a long time and I think I have found the one. Served on spaghetti for dinner and on good crusty rolls as leftovers the next night.

An excellent recipe, the only change I would make is to grate the onion to mix it more evenly with with the meat. Also, why salt then garlic salt?  Maybe a grated clove of fresh garlic and then 3/4 tsp kosher salt.... We left out the hot pepper(s) because our young son was eating them as well. We simmered in sauce once cooked to add flavour to the sauce. Loved the tenderness and texture.

These were great! I wish I'd erred a little more on the side of spicy.. I didn't have red pepper flakes so I just added a few extra dashes of Crystal hot sauce, and I should have added more. My kids ate the snot out of them, though, had to cut them off so we could have leftovers. I did commit a sin though. *hangs head in shame* Instead of baking them, I seared them in a little olive oil and butter then just cooked them off in the sauce. In my defense, it's a trillion degrees here and the thought of turning the oven on upset my tummy! Besides, butter makes everything better!

We love meatballs.  We haven't found a meatball we didn't like, until now.  The bread crumbs and seasonings were over powering.  I tried these a few different ways (on pasta, in a sandwich, ...)  I'm sure there are tweaks I could make to improve it for our taste, but I'm just going to start over with another recipe.

My boys LOVE these-especially my 4 yr old! I decreased the red pepper flakes to 1/4 tsp & they had just enough kick for the kiddos. Thanks for another GREAT recipe!!

That'sa spicy meatball...( in my "Old Italian Man voice") lol... Very flavorful and good!.. If you don't like spicy omit some of the red pepper/hot sauce but we loved them just as they are!...   I doubled the recipe and  served on whole wheat spaghetti tonight; we will probably use the rest for meatball  subs tomorrow.  My modifications were to omit the oregano because it's already in my Italian seasonings; I didn't have enough worcestershire so I used steak sauce...  :)

I found this recipes a few years ago on this site. Everyone in my family loves it. When my son married two years ago, he made sure that he and his new wife got a copy and it is also a staple in their home. I always serve it with my home made sauce. I prepared these last year when my sister-in-law came from out of town. She ate them plain and just raved about them. You can't go wrong with this recipe. I try to watch salt content or all of my recipes so I use garlic powder instead of garlic salt. Also depending on who is eating with us, I sometimes decrease or omit the red pepper flakes.

The only thing I do differently (this comes from a 100 year old family italian meatball recipe) is to make a well within the meat mixture and add the parmesan cheese, bread crumbs, milk and mix them up into a slurry...and wait a few minutes.  Then combine this into the meat mixture, form into balls and let sit in the fridge for an hour to "set up."  Instead of baking them, the cooled meatballs are added into spaghetti sauce that is simmering on the stove.  Let the sauce and meatballs cook together (which I'm told from my Italian family that I married into) is the best way to avoid tough meatballs.  I have to agree with them. After an hour on the stove with bubbling tomato sauce, the meatballs are fabulous and add flavor!

I made these last night and they were amazing.  "Mmmmm aahh these meatballs are deeeelicious" my boyfriend says.  I did leave out the parmesan, because I didn't have any. I did a mix of spices for the Italian Seasoning, and used my homemade wheat breadcrumbs.  I didn't bake them but did the technique of dropping them into hot spaghetti sauce and cooking them in the sauce. They were amazingly good.  Thank you lovestohost this will be my standard meatball recipe!

I made these as written except for subbing garlic powder for the garlic salt, and they were wonderful.  Doubled the batch as making twice as much takes no more effort, and I could tell by reading the recipe that I would probably like them.  First night we had Meatball Nirvana Sandwiches, next night with pasta.  Do try to mince the onion as small as possible to blend easily.  This would probably make delicious mini-meatloaves, too.

Kinda like the ones I make except for the hot sauce and hot red flakes. I put in 1 egg instead of milk; crushed crackers instead of bread crumbs.

Finally got around to making these.  YUM!  I went LTH style and used dried onions instead of fresh, cut back the red pepper a tad and omitted the hot pepper sauce, 'cuz I'm a little sensitive to spicy stuff.  I was very pleased with the texture and taste.  I made this along with Best Marinara Sauce and served over hot capellini.  Thanks for a great meatball recipe, LTH.

Awesome flavor!  I used 73%  ground beef (only because I got 5 lbs for $6).  I made meatballs of all sizes to freeze in sauce.  I used disposable pans so I wouldn't have to scrub greasy pans afterwards.  Will make again.

OMG!! This recipe deserves 10 stars. I reduce the italian seasoning to 1 tsp and the oregano to 1/2 tsp. I used onion powder in replace of the onion. I used 2% milk instead of skim milk. I used 1/4 cup of italian bread crumbs. I did not use red pepper flakes. I used the recipe for meatballs and get this...MEAT NACHOS!! For meat nachos you prepare the meat as usual but do not make meat into balls. Just leave the meat scrambled and put it an ovenproof glass pan or whatever you use to bake with. Let it cook for 10 to 15 minutes in a convection oven or in a regular oven it may take up to 20 minutes to be done. I love you lovestohost for this recipe.

Yum yum yum! Made a bunch for my hubby who lives to have bucatini and meatballs after hockey tuesday nights. Instead of buying the frozen ones I always do I thought I would give these a try. So happy I did. He loves them and I made enough to freeze :).
I did half beef half pork and they are fantastic!

They had good flavor, but the texture was really soft. Kind of like Chef Boyardee meatballs. But I do like the idea of baking the meatballs and adding onions and cheese, but I definitely won't be adding the bread crumbs or the milk next time. I just don't see a good reason to ever put MILK in meat.

Yum! I made these for a meatball sandwich & they were delicious!  I decreased the red pepper flakes a tad, as my husband has a hard time with spicy, and just added a few dashes of Rooster hot sauce which I think you find in the asian foods aisle.  We both LOVED them! Thank you! Also so easy to make! (I use a icecream scooper for ease in putting them on the pan)

These are fantastic!! They have a little kick to them which makes them so yummy! Double or triple the batch and have some at the ready in the freezer. Freeze individually on a jelly roll/cookie pan, once frozen store in freezer bag. You won't regret it!!

The meatballs turned out great, but I found the italian seasoning and oregano to be overpowering, so I'm reducing the amount of those two seasonings the next time I make this.

These meatballs are terrific. Just enough "kick" to put a tingle in your mouth and very tasty. Will definitely make a double batch next time so I can freeze them. Thanks for a great recipe LTH.

This got rave reviews from the family! I've been looking for the "perfect" meatball recipe for a long time & I've finally found it! I doubled everything since I have a large family to feed and I did omit the hot sauce, though I think I'll give it a try next time & see if anyone notices.

This is a great recipe. I doubled it because I had a pound of italian sausage I needed to use. And I used fresh garlic, just my preference. These were really easy to make and with doubling the recipe I ended up with 72 meatballs. cooked 24, shaped and froze the rest on a cookie sheet then when frozen put them in a plastic bag. Will never buy premade meatballs again.

I really enjoyed these. I made them with ground turkey and isntead of the cheese I used nutritional yeast which gives a cheesy flavor. i got occupied when I was making these and overbaked them.. my own fault. When I reheated them the next day, I reheated them in some chicken stock on the stove.. not dry anymore!

What a great meatball recipe! I've never made meatballs from scratch before & this recipe was super easy! Like the other reviewers suggested I substituted an egg for the skim milk. Instead of the ground beef, I used ground turkey to make it lighter and healthier! Delicious! :)

These were awesome - I reduced the ital. seasoning by 1/2 tsp. and the oregano by 1/4 tsp., based on my taste preference... this will be my go-to recipe!  I froze most of them and they've been great to pull out a few at a time to throw into my pasta sauce or make a meatball sandwich.  YUM!

I made this recipe with venison mixed with a small amount of beef fat. I was worried but they turned out great!

I made these exactly as the recipe read.  Nobody would eat them.  The seasonings are way overpowering, and they are very dense.  I will not be making these again.  Not sure what to do with the leftovers.  Sorry.

OK...these are the best meatballs ever, bar none. I used half ground beef & half sweet Italian sausage and decided to take the advice of the reviewer who recommended ricotta cheese in place of the skim milk - definitely a good idea! My husband loves them and I have found the most perfect meatball recipe known to man - thanks, LTH!

I can't give this less than a 5. Even though I thought the red pepper amount was a wee bit too much (& i LOVE spicy!), hubby is still raving over these & devouring... Total winner for a recipe! No complaint on his end... Perfect bake time, perfect taste- WILL be making these again! Only thing i did different was top w/ a bit of bbq sauce & broil for 3-5 min on lower heat after the sauce topping. Turned out PERFECT! Applause for the perfect meatball recipe!!! Many thanks... :)

For once, I followed LTH's recipe to a "T". Absolutely wonderful! Here's some FYI's that might help. I used an ice cream scoop to form the meatballs. I ended up with 17 fairly uniformed 1 1/2 inch balls. Baked for 22 mins. - perfect! This recipe sets the standard! (Add 1/2 lb Italian sausage, 1 tsp salt, 1/4 cup dried onion flakes, 1 tsp fresh garlic. Delete 1/2 tsp salt, 1 SMALL ONION, 1/2 TEASPOON GARLIC SALT, and change to 1/4 crushed red pepper flakes.

These were just ok for us. I was really expecting an outstanding meatball, but I thought they lacked some flavor. I'll keep looking for the perfect meatball recipe.

These were without a doubt the worst meatballs I have ever tasted.  To describe what was wrong with them would simply be to say - try some other meatball recipe. I had to give them 1 star to get this rating on the site - would have preferred a -5

Awesome meatballs!  I like to double the recipe and keep some in the freezer.  Great flavor with a good kick!  My only addition is a few grinds of black pepper (I know how much YOU love that) hehehe!!  ;)  LTH, thanks for sharing your recipe!

Even when I choose recipes that have been rated highly, I always look through some of the reviews to see what suggestions others have to make it better. For this 1, I couldn't find any suggestions (except maybe cutting down on the red pepper flakes which is a matter of preference), which made me a little skeptical, but I moved forward with everything exactly as prescribed. To my delight, I am in COMPLETE agreement with everyone about how tastey these are. I didn't find them to be salty, usually I add seasoning all to all recipes, even when not called for, but didn't need to in this case, and although a little spicey (which I like) even after cutting down on the red pepper flakes to appease others. Thanks SO much for sharing!

i'm amazed by the very high ratings on this recipe.  these meatballs had a very bizarre flavor - i can't put my finger on the culprit but suspect it was the worcestershire?  i did think the texture of these meatballs was half decent, but not enough that i'd try tinkering with the flavor to make them right.  perhaps they just weren't our taste, but i can say for sure i won't make these again.  i think the fast and friendly meatball recipe is far superior to this one.

I love meatballs, but these weren't that special in flavor for me, besides being a tad salty. But a good basic recipe to play with and experiment with.

These were good, and easy to make.  I've always baked my meatballs, I just really like the texture much better than fried, and cooking them raw in the sauce grosses me out.  I followed this recipe exactly, with the minor exception of using 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes instead of 3/4.  The 1/2 just looked like plenty.  I like the texture of the meatballs made without egg - they're not as mushy as the egg ones can tend to be.  The only real problem I had was with the 'tangy' ingredients - the worcestershire and the Franks.  I didn't think they combined well with the other flavors, and it was even more noticeable when the meatballs were added to red sauce.  That's really the only change I would make.  It doesn't need an egg, they won't fall to pieces without it. All in all, a good recipe and one I will probably use again, with the minor changes above.  Thanks a lot for sharing, it's much appreciated!

I made this recipe exactly, and they turned out great! Very flavorful. Next time I would grease the pan before cooking, as they stuck to the baking sheet. Otherwise, awesome! Definitely will be adding this one to my collection.

These are very good! I used fresh, minced garlic instead of garlic salt. I add extra hot pepper sauce as I like my meatballs with a kick. The flavors all blend nicely together and cook perfectly at the suggested time/temperature. Make sure to take the meatballs out half way through baking and flip them so that both sides brown.

These turned out quite well. For the most part I stuck to the recipe, except that I used turkey ground and so also did not use Worcestershire because I wasn't sure how well it would pair.

I have now made these 3 times, and we love them. I usually use ground turkey over beef for lower fat content, and they are great anyway. I have made them with spaghetti and sauce, and also with bbq for an appetizer, and both ways are just wonderful. In fact, these taste so good, that we really like them plain with no sauce as well. Thanks for the ultimate meatball recipe that I will probably use for years and years.

Best meatballs I ever made!  I was worried that they would crack, get crusty or become rocks when baked but NO!  They held their shape beautifully, stayed soft and didn't crack at all.  I cooked all day in my crock pot with sauce and they didn't fall apart!   I added black pepper and used fresh bread crumbs from bread I had made - not store bought dry crumbs in a can.   I upped the red pepper as we like HOT!  Thanks LTH - these were just delicious!***8/13/11 Still my favorite meatballs! :)

These meatballs are definitely full of flavor. The recipe calls for a "small onion" but does not mention how many cups. We thought there were too many onions and way too much italian seasoning.I believe this would be a much better recipe if you reduce the amount of italian seasoning (I think 1/2 tsp would be plenty) and cook the onions beforehand (using 1/2 C diced).

These are excellent!!  The taste is perfect!  Next time I am going to mix half ground beef and 1/2 ground pork though for a better texture.  We tried these and Chef John's Italian meatballs side by side. Everyone loved both of them but the 6 adults liked the flavor of these the best but the texture of Chef John's which is half ground beef and half pork.

I was looking for a main dish to have with macaroni and cheese that I was craving, and I thought of meatballs. However, I didn't know WHAT KIND of meatball I wanted to make - Italian, Swedish...? My husband then found this recipe and decided to make it since I was in charge of the mac 'n cheese dish. 

Oh my goodness. This did NOT disappoint. These meatballs were so delicious I didn't even need any sauce to serve them with. They were moist, perfectly cooked but not overcooked, with great flavor balance and texture... and a nice, subtle, palate-warming heat at the very end of the bite right as you swallow. Basically - these meatballs are amazing. If you're looking for a basic go-to meatball recipe, look no further... these meatballs are ANYTHING but basic.

I am sorry but these was not brilliant for me, they were not what I'd describe as meatballs at all - they were very salty and dry. I was very disappointed as this recipe had been so very highly rated - I guess my expectations were way too high!

These meatballs are so flavorful! I normally am not a big meatball fan because they are usually bland. These have a great taste and texture! I tripled the recipe and ended up using two pounds beef and one pound lean ground pork because that is what I had. Otherwise I followed exactly.  I plan on doing spaghetti and meatballs tonight and then meatball sandwiches tomorrow.

I made these with Italian seasoned lean ground turkey and left out the pepper flakes and hot sauce (for my daughter). My carnivorous husband didn't even know they weren't made with beef! The whole (picky) family loved them. Thanks so much!

First try at homemade meatballs, perhaps it was the sauce I used with them, or maybe I just like my stand by frozen ones better.

Really good, really easy! I think you should roll the meatballs over about half way through baking, though.

This was a fantastic recipe. My second time making meatballs and this was a great guide. Very flavorful which is what I wanted in a meatball. It does have a kick which my daughter loved! But if you're a lightweight like me, just be aware. A couple of things that I did different. Doubled recipe and used half ground beef(80/20) and half ground sausage (oops, meant to grab ground pork). Added 4 tbsps of fresh parsley (had it, wanted to use some), eggs instead of milk (2 total), used minced onions because I didn't have any fresh but used freshly grated Parmesan because I DID have some of that. I followed the spice portion as best I could with a few minor changes to accommodate what I had available. I used the marinara sauce recipe from Italian Spaghetti Sauce with Meatballs and made meatball subs out of the combination. YUM!

I am not rating the taste because I used pre-seasoned hot italian chicken sausage instead of beef so I didn't add any spices to it.  (Amazing that way...)  But I am rating this on the texture and way it stayed together, which was great!  Perfect ratio of the bread crumbs, meat & milk.  I also loved having the parmesan cheese in it.

Nice consistency. Flavorful, a little hot, maybe too much for the faint of heart.  If spicy doesn't suit you, I'd leave out the red pepper flakes.

These are delicious!  I added green pepper and some onion soup mix to my batch and fell in love!  I made some small and large sizes to freeze for quick meals later.  Great for sweet and sour, italian or brown gravy! Good recipe lovestohost!

Over the Top Wonderful. Lots of flavor,with a little "kick", easy to prepare and bake. These meatballs are very versatile with red sauce, gravy,
and even as an appetizer with a dipping sauce. These will be the only meatballs I will make. I usually double the recipe and freeze for future use. We prefer our meatballs on the softer side, so  Once the meatballs are formed I add a 14oz. Can of plain tomato sauce, cover and bake at the original time and degrees. These  are hands down the best meatballs. Thank You for Sharing.

These were terrific! Perfect for hearty meatball subs.  I doubled the recipe, cut way back on the pepper flakes (as I had littles to feed), and used panko for the breadcrumbs. They were the perfect texture and held up well on our portugese rolls.

I was skeptical about a meatball recipe that didn't use egg, but I decided to follow the recipe exactly.  These meatballs are phenomenal!!!  Best I've ever had and also got rave reviews all around, even from the picky eaters.

Love'em!  I doubled and used half beef and half pork and granulated garlic instead of garlic salt.  I also omitted the hot sauce but love the red pepper flakes.  I omitted the oregano...the Italian seasoning was enough for us.  I really like meatballs without egg and these are a keeper!  They freeze beautifully!

YUM!  These were great with red sauce and spaghetti, and would make amazing meatball subs.  My daughter also enjoyed them dipped in her favorite condiment she calls 'Metchup' (ketchup & mustard mixed together--LOL).  Thanks for sharing your recipe LTH!

I love these!  They have a hearty, beefy taste and texture, and not the mushy/spongy taste that so many meatball recipes have.  I'm not one for measuring everything but I can't see how you can go wrong with this recipe, unless you ignore it completely!

Despite the rave reviews, I made a couple of alterations: I doubled the recipe and used 1 1/2 lb ground beef to 1/2 lb very lean ground pork for some additional flavour and it was fantastic! I also baked the meatballs for about 20 minutes and then added them to a homemade tomato sauce and let them simmer for about 2 hours on low heat (had some extra time on my hands!) - the result was incredible.

Yum! Love the kick of the pepper flakes and hot sauce (I used Tabasco).  Only change was to maybe halve the Worcestershire - we like it, but aren't wild about it.  Meatballs were delicious and moist, and I think Meatball Nirvana mix would also make an awesome Meatloaf Nirvana! Thanks, LTH! These will become a regular in our rotation!

So the first time I made this I changed it up a lot, and this time I followed it exactly, except for not using onion since I didn't have any. Amazing! Very very good. Added a lot of Tabasco, and used plain bread crumbs, but upped the seasoning.

I have to say these were very tasty.  The Worcestershire sauce gave it a nice taste.  There was a nice melding with the spices and onions and cheese.  I will definetly make these again.  Thank you for posting.

The best meatballs I have ever eaten!!! Husband says "Wonderful seasoning combination with just the right amount of heat."  We did cut the red pepper down to 1/2 teaspoon and added a little McCormick's Texas Smokehouse Burger Seasoning just because.  I didn't have any bread crumbs; but, in the fridge I found the baggie of left over Pepperidge Farm cornbread stuffing and used that.  Used 96/4 hamburger and pulverized the onion before adding it :) Will definitely make again.

DH has always made the meatballs around here. Not any more. I made a double batch of these today and tossed some into my spaghetti sauce. Not only were the meatballs a HUGE success, but they added extra flavor to the sauce and made the whole meal amazing. I'll make these again and again! Thanks, LTH!

These are the BEST meatballs I have ever had. I quadrupled this recipe. Didn't add as much as it called for of the red pepper flakes and no hot sauce. Added roasted garlic in place of garlic salt. In place of some of the milk I added an egg. Sprayed the cookie sheet so they wouldn't stick. Quadrupling this recipe made 26 large meatballs. Made the greatest meatball subs, can't wait to make again!

OMG....tooooo delicious...I used these meaballs with the sauce recipe from this site called "Italian Spaghetti Sauce with Meatballs".  Freakin' amazing.  I only changed a little bit (b/c I don't have milk....just used an egg)....omitted the red pepper flakes b/c I had added them to the sauce (in a moment of recipe confusion).  I added several shakes of red tabasco sauce.  THESE ARE NOT SPICY MEATBALLS PEOPLE....don't freak out.

These were the best meatballs I ever made. I did change just a couple of things....I doubled the recipe using 1 pound of lean gr. beef and 1 pound of meatloaf mix (veal, pork and beef), I omitted the hot sauce and only used half the pepper flakes (hubby not fond of spicy!), I also omitted the milk and used 1 cup ricotta cheese. Perfect! I may cut back on the pepper flakes next time or omit them altogether, still too spicy (not for me). This is definitely a keeper!

I really questioned whether nirvana could be reached through meatball, and I must say it was awfully close with this recipe.  Super moist/juicy, flavorful with a little spicy kick.  I loved these meatballs.  We had them with a little bit of tomato/basil pasta sauce and angel hair pasta, but they really could be eaten all by themselves, and would be stellar in sandwich form as well.  Thank you for this awesome recipe - I can't wait to make them again.

LOVE these meat balls. Tip I learned from Fabio on the Chow!ciao show, cook the meatballs IN the sauce. I learned from my mom to cook the meatballs separately, but now when I cook them in the sauce everything tastes so much better

Great flavors, though I think I will double all herbs and sauces next time! I think I have finally settled on this recipe for Italian meatballs. The milk made them a bit mushy though, and they fell apart too easily, even after adding an egg. I think if you skip the milk and add an egg or two, the texture will be perfect. Thank you!

These were just ok, not enough moistness or flavor. Don't know anyone who adds oregano or italian seasoning to a meatball recipe. I add beef/pork/veal mix found in supermarkets, salt, pepper, grated romano cheese, minced onion, minced garlic, 1 egg, 1/2 c milk, 3 slices of bread, fresh parsley. Soak bread in milk, mix up with spoon, add egg & then other ingredients before adding meat mix. Mix all together & then fry up a little meat in a pan to taste for seasonings. You can add more seasonings to your own taste. Then bake in oven or fry in pan. Add to sauce & simmer for 1/2 hour or serve just from the oven with some grated cheese on top.  Delicious!!!! & moist.  For extra moistness, try adding 1/2 cup ricotta cheese instead of milk.

I hate to admit that I wasn't crazy about this recipe.  I doubled it, but only used enough onions for 1 pound and still felt it was a bit much.  If I were to make these again I would used the spice dried minced onions or chopped onions, probably 3-4 TBSP.  The spices all together were good, and I used the recipe for meatball subs with garlic french bread.  

For those that love onions, I do too.  I cooked the meatballs for 25 minutes, and the onions were still a bit crunchy when finished.  They just weren't the best I'd ever tasted.

The meatballs definitely live up to their name. They came out delicious; moist and full of flavor. I substituted one egg for the milk and skipped the dash of pepper sauce (kept the pepper flakes though) and thought it came out pretty spicy, so you may want to adjust according to your tastes. My boyfriend absolutely loves them. I've made them at least three times already!! Great wonderful awesome recipe!

This is definitely my new go-to meatball recipe.  I did decrease the red pepper to 1/4t. and eliminate the hot sauce.  It still had a little kick, which we all liked.

Love these meatballs. They have a nice kick to them. I usually make a huge batch and freeze them for easy meals through the week. I use pork sausage if I have it along with the ground beef, which adds a bit more flavour.

Nothing special here. I did not care for the overpowering taste of Italian seasoning in these meatballs. For me, that ruined the lovely marinara sauce too. Also 1 1/2 inch meatballs needed less than 20 mins.

Wonderful! I also exchanged the milk for egg and this worked well. I cooked them in the oven then I used Don Pepino tomato sauce (yellow can, simple, delicious, economical sauce for everything!) with them in the crock pot for a few hours and made the best meatball and provalone cheese subs ever!!

I am surprised these didn't taste like nirvana. From all the reviews, I thought they would be the best I ever had. They didn't come close. I think there are just way too many seasonings mixed in them. They were o.k., but I will never make this recipe again.

I've just started on my quest for the perfect meatball recipe and this was NOT IT.  For me these tasted like meatloaf balls.  I always follow recipes to the "T" but maybe I goofed somewhere.  My husband like them, but agreed they tasted "meatloafy"

Tasty but a little dry until sauce is added.  Definitely not to be eaten without adding sauce.

Not as much flavor as I would have liked. I'll have to double the garlic for sure. This recipe is a great start though...thanks!

Excellent meatballs for pasta or meatball sandwiches.  I followed advise of other reviewers and used half ground beef and half ground pork.  Gave the meatballs incredible flavor and texture!  I also used the egg instead of the milk and used fresh oregano and basil out of my herb garden.  I sauteed them on the stove and finished off in the oven and popped into jar sauce that I kicked up with more fresh herbs for a 30 minute simmer.

These are good!  Great with spaghetti & meatballs and in meatball subs with cheese and marinara.  I make a bunch of them, bake them and then freeze the extras for later.  My go-to recipe for turkey meatballs.

I think this recipe calls for way more oregano and Italian seasoning than I care for.  I'll try them again but cut those measurements down.  They cooked up nicely and held together though :)

Yummy! When I saw this was LTH, I knew it was a winner. My husband is still talking about these, days (almost a week) later. Which, I will add is rare for him. The review to use the ricotta instead of milk and to add the sausage, was spot on. We were looking for spaghetti and meatballs and OMG! did this deliver. Awesome, 5+++ stars. We can't wait to have them again.... very soon!!! Thanks, LTH, you rock!!!

These were good, easy to make and easy to freeze.  I made a double batch and froze them in a gallon bag just like you would buy at Sam's.  I have used them for everything, from spaghetti and meatballs to bbq meatballs.  They are fun, versatile and easy.

Allow me to preface this by saying that I am NOT a big fan of meatballs....UNTIL NOW!  I had decided to make these today to freeze for my sister who is about to have a baby.  I decided to double the recipe b/c my son and BF love meatballs...I AM SO GLAD I DID!  I cut into one after cooking and I was SHOCKED at how good they are!  I did use ground turkey instead of beef, but other than that I stuck to the recipe, and this is going to be a keeper!  Thanks LTH!

I have been looking for a good meatball recipe and I have finally found it!  My meatballs were on the small side, so thebaking time was just a touch too long, but still good.  I ate one right after they came out of the oven because they smelled so good!  Served with Brooklyn Girl's Penne Arrabiata from this site.

OK this really was meatball nirvana, my boyfriend raved about these. I made the recipe exactly as written and made a double batch, I'm really glad I did! They were moist and yummy and I loved the red pepper flakes in them, it added a nice kick.

The seasoning was good, but otherwise not impressive. They burnt on the bottom, fell apart, and were very boring overall.

These meatballs are even better than those at my favorite Italian restaurant.  No need to go out for my spaghetti and meatball dinner  anymore, haha.  I pretty much followed the recipe as written, except for substituting with dried flaked onions, and used fresh minced garlic.  Loved the extra kick from the pepper flakes.  It’s also extremely easy to prepare, which makes this recipe a real winner!

My husband said, "Oh my god, these meatballs are awesome!"  And he's right!  I made them exactly as instructed, with the exception of leaving out the dash of hot sauce (since we only have Shriraka and I was afraid it would be way too hot).  Next time I might increase the amount of parmesan cheese called for, but that's just a question of personal taste.  An outstanding recipe that we will use again and again.

I have no idea why I waited so long to make these since I saved the recipe as soon as it was published.  I made them as written and found the balance of flavors to be perfect.  To make them a bit easier to shape I refrigerated the mixture for about half an hour before forming.  I served them with a very light, freshly made marinara over polenta with a salad to complete the meal and my food critics gave rave reviews.  The parmesan cheese really lightens them.  Thanks, Lovestohost

YUMMMMMMMYYYY.  The only thing I changed was that I cut back on red pepper flakes by half, used an egg instead of milk, and literally only used one dash of Tabasco hot sauce (although I prefer Franks Hot Sauce).  My daughter and fiancée loved them... I am buying a few of pounds of lean ground beef this weekend so I can make a batch and freeze for the week! 

This is in the regular rotation now!

I just made these this morning and they were gone in 20min. I used the dried minced onions and my husband who hates onions LOVED them. My two year old loves them but I think I'll cut back on the red peppers a little. I followed the recipe just as it read expect for the dried onions and I put the bread crumbs and milk in a bowl there own bowl. I add everything else then I squeeze the bread out and add it. YUMMY!!!!!

Very good. I did double the batch and used 1 lb of ground chuck and 1 lb of pork and reduced the amount of red pepper to my families taste, other than that made as directed. Yum!

I had to make some weird changes because certain ingredients were unexpectedly missing from my fridge! Instead of an actual onion, I used a Tbsp of dried minced onion, and apparently the author of this recipe has done the same thing, so I feel better about it, haha. Also, I used Sriracha for my red pepper sauce .

Here's where I had to be VERY creative. I had no milk (my husband drank the last of it the night before and didn't tell me!), and my bread crumbs were unseasoned. Since I figured the milk was meant to add moisture to the mix, and I needed some sort of seasoning to make up for the bread crumbs.... I used 1/4 cup of Italian salad dressing with the crumbs I had. Weird, I know, but it worked fairly well. The meatballs were slightly less sturdy, and there was some oil runoff (from the dressing, no doubt) but for 98% of the time they held up while I picked them up off the baking sheet, and they tasted fantastic! My husband loved them so much, he kept bugging me to bring out the leftovers (of which we had plenty, which was also awesome about the recipe) in the following days.

We found these were too spicy and I only used 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes.  If I make these again I will eliminate the red pepper flakes and use a little more cheese.

WOW!! These were great!  I made them without the hot stuff and as minis for my 1 year old.  Much cheaper than getting the premade ones at the grocery store.  And much more delicious!!! I'll be making these every week!!

I used 1/2 lb ground beef and 1/2 lb of ground pork.  This was a decent base recipe.  At the moment, I don't know what I would change, if anything.  I served the meatballs with a homemade spaghetti sauce.

Excellent as listed.  Also tried with 1/2 pork 1/2 beef, also excellent!  The spice is just right, not too overpowering but enough to leave you thinking.  I make meatballs often but this particular recipe received many comments and compliments.

I believe this was my first time ever making meatballs, and I was glad I chose this recipe.  I used some ground beef which had a higher fat content (because it was what I had), I cut down the red pepper flakes to 1/4 tsp. (for my kids), omitted the hot sauce, and used finely ground oatmeal instead of bread crumbs.  I also only used about 1/4 of a small onion.  Once baked, I put the meatballs in a crockpot, poured my favorite jarred marinara sauce on top, and let it cook on low for a few hours until supper time.  We recently bought a LOT of beef from a local farmer, so I think these would be a good way to use the ground beef.  I plan to make and freeze some for later use.  Thanks for a great recipe!

left out the hot sauce and subbed cayenne powder for the chili flakes but it was still a little on the too hot side for my family though i enjoyed it.  I served the meatballs on top of couscous and it made  a pretty good dinner.  the meatballs didn't fall apart.

Nice recipe...just enough 'kick' to it. Next time I think I'll add these to an arrabiata sauce, or as others noted, make meatball subs w/some provolone.  I also subbed 1/2 c of ricotta cheese, as I had some to use up...Will make again:)

So I took "Itlaiantapas" idea and used 1/2 beef and 1/2 mild sausage plus added ricotta to the mix.  I used fresh garlic (minced) and unfortunately totally forgot the Worcestershire sauce!  But they turned out absolutely amazing anyway.  This was my first time making meatballs...will definitely use this as a base again.

These are spactacular.  I prefer walnut-sized meatballs (This recipe made 30) so they can be more managable when used in sandwiches, so I only baked them for 13 minutes or so.  I also would recommend turning them during cooking, otherwise they have a flat side that's browner.  Also, when making any meatball you have to remember that mixing and rolling these is an art.  If they're over-mixed and or over rolled, they become too dense.  LOVE these MEATBALLS! THANKS!

Super duper amazing!  I always get raves from the boyfriend when I make these.  I generally make a double batch and freeze the second batch in two packages (seal and save) they reheat exceptionally well on a weeknight.  I think Frank's is the secret!

DELICIOUS!  I whipped these up as a main dish for my family's dinner tonight and was very pleased.  Moist and flavorful sum these up.  I made them kid-friendly and not too spicy by omitting the hot pepper sauce and cutting the crushed red pepper flakes down to 1/2 tsp.  They still had a bit of a "kick" but were not spicy!  I also used 1 egg in place of the skim milk.  They baked up in 20 minutes and I served them with a "meatloaf-style dipping sauce" of 1/2 cup ketchup, 2 tsp. dry mustard, and 3 tbsp. brown sugar mixed and warmed through, veggies, mac n cheese, and applesauce...a kid friendly meal!  Will definitely make again as a family meal or as appetizers for company.  Thanks for the recipe, LTH!

I substituted vegetarian "ground sausage" for the ground beef and reduced the temperature from 400F to 350F. I baked the meatballs for 30 minutes. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. After 15 minutes, I flipped the meatballs over so they would brown equally. I served this with spaghetti and home made spaghetti sauce. I will definitely make this again.

Um, I wouldn't exactly call this nirvana. They were good, and our dinner guests could taste some spice (although we could not - we take things on the SPICY side of spicy), however, they don't warrant making again.

Delicious! Very quick and easy to make, ideal for me  to make when I get in from work for the family. I also substituted the egg for the milk and I used few shakes of Tabasco sauce instead of Franks.

the most delicious meatballs we have ever had! they are full of flavor! I will be making this all the time now. My whole family loved them, i did add black pepper and used regular milk rather then skim, i also kept the onions out because my husband is not a fan of onions. My suggestion is if you are making these for kids decrease the amount of red pepper flakes and hot sauce because it is a little on the spicy side! THANKS SO MUCH FOR THIS DISH!

I'm pretty sure these are the best meatballs I've ever tasted. I tripled the recipe, used just the 1 onion, used probably a half-cup of milk (because my onion was ground to bits in the food processor -- I added its juices too), and reduced the salt. It amuses me that the majority of people who didn't like them complain that there's too much flavor here. Look, anyone can make flavorless meatballs -- do you really need a recipe for that? But -- if you are looking for meatballs that do not need to be drowned in your great grandmother's secret recipe special sauce with weird ingredients or words you need a dictionary for -- here's your recipe, a meatball that'll stand on its own, do its job in a sandwich, or make your old marinara sauce seem new again. Thanks, LTH! (Tripling this recipe yielded 45 spaghetti-meatballs and 20 meatball sub meatballs, baking at 400 for 20 and 22 minutes respectively.)

Very good! Everyone at my house liked them :) I was afraid while preparing them, seemed like a LOT of seasoning was going into the meat, but it didn't end up overpowering at all. Thanks for the recipe LTH :)

These are really good!  I will reduce the red pepper flakes next time for my weak-stomached husband.  It is easy, delicious, quick and very, very good.  I actually used too much parmesan when I doubled the recipe but they were fantastic anyway.  Will surely make again and am sending the recipe to a friend who loves to cook.

The flavor of these is great...seasonings and all of that is right on.  However, with all of the liquid in this recipe, I had to use an extreme amount of breadcrumbs.  They still fell apart on me.  I ended up salvaging what I could and letting them simmer in my sauce and giving up on the others as actual meatballs and tossing the crumbles into the sauce as well.  Flavor very good...but at the end of the day, I think I'd stick to using an egg and nixing the milk.

MOIST & DELICIOUS!   These are by far the most moist and delicious meatballs I have ever eaten.  Hubby has not stopped raving about them.  I followed the recipe exactly but had to leave out the red pepper flakes, although I did add the hot pepper sauce.  This is definitely our new "go to" recipe.  Thank you lovestohost for sharing such a 'WINNER'!   I only regret that I didn't try them sooner.

I have never made meatballs before but this recipe is it. I used 1/2beef and 1/2turkey, both very lean and "baked" them on the grill. I served them with ravioli and marinara sauce and stored them without sauce. They were so good plain that I kept snitching them while they were cooling and one more from the fridge before I froze them. They're a great cold finger food, not greasy at all.UPDATE: I sliced these for pizza and had some leftover so I made a sauceless sandwich with sauteed peppers, mushrooms and smoked sun dried tomatoes, topped with some fresh parm. Still my favorite meatball recipe.

We did NOT like this at all! The italian seasoning and oregano was overpowering and it was too much worcestershire.  The Amazing Swedish Meatball recipe for the MEATBALLS, not the sauce, is much better, IMO.

Wow, these were good.  They have a bit of a kick that I loved.  I omitted the hot sauce because I ran out but they were still wonderful.  I will make these again.  I think they would make great cocktail meatballs too.

This is a very good, easy recipe.  The only thing I didn't add was the hot pepper sauce and crushed red pepper flakes, but, other than that I followed this recipe completely.  I cooked them in sauce in the crock pot for 8 hours on low and they were done perfectly.  Thanks LTH for sharing this recipe.

Made these with ground turkey-otherwise, kept everything the same. EXCELLENT!! Only wish I had made more- the next time, I will. Made the "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" recipe from this site, and made sandwiches on french rolls. Really, really tasty!! Thanks lovestohost for this recipe!!

My whole family loves meatballs so I thought I would try this recipe.  I already have one that everyone loves, but I like to try new things.  I am sorry to say this one didn't go over well.  I know there are a bunch of rave reviews, but if you are feeding a family and they are not into overly flavored/spiced tastes, then this is not the meatball recipe for you.

Fantastic. Easy and quick. Changes? 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes (personal taste); 1/2 tsp garlic powder (that's what I had; 1/2 tsp onion flakes instead of onion (personal taste). Personally, I think as long as you stay close to the original recipe, if not exactly, you'll like this as much as our house does. Really, really good.  Thanks LTH! Antoher winner.

I've used this recipe before, and I always add 1 or 2 eggs as a bonding agent.  The meatballs hold together perfectly and the egg is good additional protein for you.

OMG...these are SCRUMPTIOUS!!!!  I was looking for something different to do with my ground beef and this was my winner!  EXCELLENT!  I used panko for the bread crumbs as that's all I ever buy and didn't have any Italian seasoning, so just threw in some basil, thyme, etc.  Next time, I will use a homemade pasta sauce and use proper hoagies/buns (had to make due with pocketless pitas and canned sauce, LOL, which were still great)!!  Loved these meatballs and will definitely repeat this recipe, thanks LTH!!

So freaking good!  We had them as sandwiches on a large Italian bread that I cut lengthwise and spread garlic butter on and then toasted. Topped it with some mozzarella cheese and it was awesome. I simmered them in a jar of Ragu chunky sauce and it was great . I can't wait to make them again but with my own sauce and spaghetti. Good job lth:

Fantastic. Amazing. Delicious. I can’t think of enough words to describe the most wonderful meatballs I’ve ever tasted!  I always change recipes around without ever tasting the original. I didn’t change this one for whatever reason. It was sooo good. Try it, and I guarantee your family will LOVE it. ??

These were really good, but a bit salty. Next time we make them we will omit the garlic salt in favor of the same amount of garlic powder.

I made this for our New years eve party and I wish I would have made more. I used ground sirloin this time which made a huge difference. Used an egg as opposed to milk, I added aged cheddar to the beef mixture that really married everything together nicely. I also turned them halfway and broiled them for a few minutes  to crisp them up a bit. I have had 2 people from the party ask me for this recipe already, fantastic dish!

I'm not a meatball fan but I loved these! I had to make some minor changes because I didn't have ingredients on hand and felt too lazy to run out. Used cayenne pepper instead of red pepper flakes, and used shredded cheddar cheese instead of Parmesan. Came out wonderfully! Very moist and held together well. Great flavor. I'll definitely make these again.

Wow, these just came out of the oven and after tasting I came straight to my laptop to review!  These are delicious, just the right amount of spicy zing without leaving any after burn. Choose this recipe for my day of making freezer meals, these will go into the regular rotation. I doubled the recipe and it made 24 two inch meatballs. For the reviewers who complained about dry tough meatballs I offer this advice.
First mix up dry ingredients then add wet, let this sit 10 min to soften the crumbs. Then mix in meat, be careful not to over mix or the meat will get tough.

Not even remotely as good as Chef John's meatballs.  Any meatball that doesn't include ground pork or veal is a gussied up hamburger.

Wonderful recipe! Easy and quick to put together. I made mine gluten free by using gf bread crumbs and gluten free Worcestershire sauce. After baking for 20 minutes I added them to a pot of spaghetti sauce, cooked for 10 minutes more and then served over penne pasta. My family loved them. Thank you lovestohost for this recipe.

These were great! My only suggestion is to half the onion; next time I will most likely grate it or throw it in the food processor.  We turned them into bbq and Italian sliders!

Wonderful recipe!  I used half pork, half beef and it turned out great!  I used crushed organic flax croutons for breadcrumbs and added minced red bell pepper and fresh garlic. Served on ciabatta loaf with fresh sauce, topped with Asiago, Parmesan, and Romano cheeses with fresh basil. Baked on foil for easy clean up.  Rave reviews!  My 15 year old son took his first bite and said, "I'm so lucky..."  I will definitely be making this again.

Rated this 4 stars due to making some changes based on other reviews. Gotta say how much I appreciate the reviews and suggestions on how to make a good recipe even better, because we really hate to waste food and money if something doesn't turn out. So...doubled the recipe to freeze extras. Used egg instead of milk, garlic powder instead of garlic salt, sautéed the onion and minced garlic to soften. Left out hot sauce and red pepper flakes but added a touch of cayenne and onion powder. Little less Italian seasoning and Italian breadcrumbs. Mixed all the seasonings well before adding beef and egg and Worcestershire. Cooked 20 meatballs at 400 for 35 minutes. We love them! Try not to get upset over changes, everybody's tastes are different and reading some less positive reviews can spare wasted time and money.

I am rating this a 4 only because the heat level was a bit much for us; however, cutting back on the red pepper and eliminating the hot sauce makes these the best meatballs. Very flavorful.

Amazing recipe and I always get great compliments on it. Instead of using all beef, I use 1/2 lb Italian sausage and 1/2 lb beef and it adds some extra flavor. My ex boyfriend loved it so much he made the awkward phone call to get the recipe!

Really great recipe. I have made adjustments because there were some things I needed to use before they went bad: I used 1/2 ground chuck and 1/2 italian sausage. I also used an egg in place of the milk as per other reviews. Instead of garlic salt, I used two cloves of minced garlic (I thought there would be too much salt in there otherwise). The cooking time was spot on.

I have made this now 8 times in the last 3 months and I make a big bowel of them I have bumped it up to where it makes about 28 meat balls. Make them and put them in the fridge and use them on Meatball sandwich, spaghetti, nachos, put BBQ sauce over them heat them up. I want to try 1/2 ground meat and 1/2 ground pork for the recipe but never do it when I make them. I bet it would be very good I will have to do it next time lol maybe.

This is a DELICIOUS meatball recipe and it's super easy to make! My husband compliments it every time I make them. I've played around with it a little bit and the one most important thing I've learned is that you cannot leave out the Parmesan cheese - it totally changes the flavor and they aren't nearly as good. i used a teaspoon of tapateo for the hot pepper sauce and it gives them great flavor without making them spicy. I'm a wimp and can't handle spicy foods. Too much pepper and my mouth is burning. The one thing I DON'T like about this recipe is actually the baking style. They tend to get all black and crusty on the bottoms because of baking in their own grease. SIMPLE REMEDY though: place a cookie drying rack inside of your cookie sheet so that the grease can drip through. Works great!

Not a fan of this recipe. The milk made these meatballs a gloppy mess. Just add an egg and keep it moving.

The grandsons weren't thrilled with this recipe. I think the hot pepper flakes and the hot sauce didn't mesh with the other seasonings. I won"t make it again - but obviously a number of reviews enjoyed it and so to each their own.

I have been wanting meatballs, so today was the day!  These are great and can be used for any sauce.  I did not have any hot sauce, but they had the perfect heat for me with the crushed pepper.  I used Tastefully Simples Italian Garlic spice in place of the Italian spices, because it was what I had.  I put them directly in to my sauce which is spicy too!

Best meatball recipe I have ever made and I come from an Italian family. I substituted the onions for french onion soup because I didn't have any onions and we were stuck in our home due to ice storm in Dallas. I didn't use all of the packet though mostly just the dried onion from it and not much of the poweder. I also fried the meatballs in a small amount of olive oil rather than bake them. The whole family loved them and also said the best they ever had!

I have made this many times, and it is great as written. I always double or triple the recipe (if you are going to mess up your kitchen you might as well have an extra meal or two out of it).  They freeze beautifully once baked and cooled. I make up ziploc bags of 12. Also, they are esp delicious if you add a pound of italian sausage to the ground beef. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

this was very good.  actually used the meat to stuff peppers.  the DH couldn't stop praising them!  i thought it was a bit too spicy, but that could have been my fault.  (measument was off).  other than that, i have no complaints! we are going to have these as meatball sandwiches this week!  thanks for the post lovestohost!  :-)

Very flavorful! used a bit of cayenne instead of the red pepper flakes, gave just the right amount of kick without biting into a 'hot spot'. Made them a few times, cooked half time in oven when putting in a sauce and entire time when using them on their own or in a sub

After reading all the reviews I decided to tweak it by substituting 1/2 the beef for ground pork and used part skim ricotta instead of the milk.  This is, by far, the best meatball recipe I have made to date.  They simply melt in your mouth.  This is a keeper.  Thanks for the recipe and suggestions!

This recipe even passed my 6-year-old meatball lover! I adjusted a few things because we like to eat turkey. I increased the recipe to account for 1lb of grass fed beef and 1.5lbs of ground turkey.  I added an egg to help with moistness due to the lean turkey and they were ....AWESOME! I made a bunch and froze them...defrosted and reheated in sauce they are delectable!  A true winner!

I had some ground beef I needed to use up and found this recipe so I decided to try it.  I did not use the Italian seasoning or oregano because I used Italian Style Panko Breadcrumbs.  I only used 1/2 onion cause mine was large.  I also used regular milk because I did not have skim milk.  The flavor was very tasty but I thought the meatballs were a little dry.  I think using an egg vs. the milk would have improved this recipe.   Will try at a later date.

Good, basic recipe with some extra zip! Followed the recipe exactly, just switched garlic powder for garlic salt. LOVE the baked rather than fried option-- Can't stand greasy meatballs!! I think next time, I'll go bolder on the spices. The recipe as is cooks up quick, easy, and I appreciate the flexibility.

I kept seeing this recipe recommended on Recipe Buzz. I thought to myself that they can not be as good as everyone says. Well, I finally tried them myself and they are just as good as everyone says, maybe even better. I usually end up eating 1 or 2 (or maybe even more) as soon as I take them out of the oven. I like doubling the recipe and freeze the extras for a quick meal. I need to start tripling it. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

The only change I made was substituting the Worcestershire sauce with A1 sauce.  Everytime I've made these I increase the batch size and we still never have leftovers!  They are that good!  And I have never liked meatballs until this came along!

Try broiling the meatballs vs baking, this adds a dark rich color, flavor and texture before adding them to a sauce and helps them stay together better. Using a rack keeps the bottom side from getting all soggy and splitting during bake or broil.

The only thing this is missing is an egg and these are my meatballs!  I would only go easy on the oregano and I would leave the Parmesan cheese as a topper if the people eating them like Parmesan cheese, as it is an acquired taste.

My husband and I enjoyed these.  They were a little too spicy for the kids.  Next time, I'll cut back on the oregano and pepper flakes, and see if the kids like them more.

My husband loved it! He took the leftovers for lunch today and said he'd be the envy of his coworkers. He took one bite and said "tell whoever posted that recipe that I love it!" :) I made them just as the recipe said.

These were very easy to make and had a wonderful flavor!  I made them very small and added them to an anlphabet vegetable soup.  I have plans to make grinders with them next, as well as several batches just to keep in the freezer.  They are so versatile!

I did what another reviewer recommended and split 50% ground beef (75/25) and 50% ground pork.  It was fantastic.  Too spicy for our 6 and 3 year olds with the red pepper but great for us.  Nest time I will just carve out some meatballs for the kids before adding the red pepper flakes.  Thanks for our new meatball recipe!!

These meatballs are pretty awesome. I needed a tasty, general purpose meatball and hit the jackpot with this one. I have so much beef in the chest freezer - just made a quad batch of these. The kids love them. I opted not to include the hot sauce but did add the hot pepper flakes. For us, it totally Goldilocks (just right).

Delicious! Had these for dinner tonight! Had to use a clove of fresh garlic instead of garlic salt and chili powder instead of red pepper flakes (didn't have either of 'em). Still tasted fabulous! Thanks for a yummy recipe. We'll be doing this again!!

A different and delicious twist on meatballs. Used this recipe for meatball sandwiches and added ATK simple tomatoe sauce. Be sure not to overcook and have dry meatballs.

I was surprised at how moist these turned out. They were a little spicier than I expected so next tie I make them I will do either the hot sauce or the pepper flakes, not both.

These are so good!I use ground Turkey and extra Parmesan- plus a little green onion. Plain breadcrumbs work just fine with these changes. Very flavorful and tender.

Meatballs were amazing! Though one comment I have is what exactly constitutes a "small" onion?  The smallest onion I could find was the size of a baseball and I only used 25% of it...the meat could hold no more! :)

The best meatball recipe ever!!! I could eat these things by the pound.  Also this is a great way to season ground beef for lasgna, baked ziti, spaghetti.  I even used it for Hamburgers, topped with some spaghetti sauce and provolone cheese slices.  Those were some good bugers.

Great recipe! I only put in half the amount of red pepper flakes and no hot sauce and it was plenty of spiciness for me (I like things mild and not very spicy). Doubled the recipe and it made 30+ meatballs. I put the majority of them in single serving Tupperware containers with World's Best Pasta Sauce (from this site) for quick and easy dinners. Thank you for the great recipe!

Followed some suggestions and substituted an egg for some of the milk and since I'm a complete wuss on hot sauce, I left out the pepper flakes and hot pepper sauce. Whole family LOVED them! Great base recipe.

Good base recipe. I only ate one right out of the oven and they do seem a bit crumbly so not sure they will hold together when they hit the sauce. Surprised by how spicy they were, guess I was too heavy handed with the Frank's-dissapointed I won't be able to get my kids to eat them. Great flavor though, will use less salt next time, a tad too salty. Overall though, much more flavor than other meatball recipes I've tried recently! Thx!

LTH....you have out done yourself! :) what a fabulous recipe!  I followed the spices to the letter but I was peeved that I forgot to add the parmesan!!!!!  I did use a combo of pork/beef and hubs said these were the best meatballs he has ever had...usually I make turkey meatballs, decided to splurge on the waist line today! Thanks again, next time I won't forget to add the cheese!!!! :)

Great meatballs - but beware - found them VERY hot even after decreased red pepper flakes...  I have never made meatballs without using an egg before - they held together beautifully and are very moist.

I didn't have any hot sauce, so left that out.  I also didn't realize I was out of worcestershire sauce, so I used steak sauce in place of it.  These were DELICIOUS!  Cooked perfectly in 25 minutes in the oven.  Awesome taste, thank you so much!

Excellent I like spice but held back on the red pepper sauce and found them to be spicy enough with the red chili flakes. Makes about 25 meatballs. Next time I will make a bigger batch and freeze!

O-M-G!!! I'm seriously kicking myself for not trying these sooner! True meatball perfection! I tripled the recipe and I was using 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 ground venison, so I added a little plain yogurt to the mix and they turned out Fantastic!!! I also used dried minced onion per submitter's recommendation. I will never try another meatball recipe. Thank you, LTH!

Delicious. I did half hamburger, half Italian sausage. I used ricotta cheese instead of milk. and it seemed the 25 minutes didn't quite brown them. I put the oven on broil, and sat them under the broiler. I increased the recipe by 1/4th. It made wow, over 30, and a group of 5, ate all but 7. I also get alot of my recipes from this site.  Very good! This is one of my favorite recipes on Allrecipes.com.

My whole family thinks these are awesome! And they really couldn't be much easier.
I use either crushed croutons or crushed Ritz crackers, because I never have bread crumbs on hand. I also use minced garlic rather than garlic salt, and it doesn't seem to need additional salt to compensate.
One tip- I would grease the baking sheet or spray with cooking spray prior to placing the meatballs- they come off the sheet a lot cleaner that way.

These are fabulous.  The only change I made was substituting ground turkey for the ground beef.  I served them over spaghetti and marinara sauce.

wow, awesome. I did wonder about NO egg so I added one egg, and used 1/2 lb pork sausage AND 1/2 LB HAMBURGER. ALSO DID NOT HAVE ITALIAN SEASONING BUT HAD PIZZA SEASONING AND USED THAT. I also used kosher salt, did not have sea salt.Did not use the hot sauce. but would like to try that. I WANT TO TRY THIS NOW AS IT IS WRITTEN. I USED A SAUCE WITH BROWN SUGAR, WORCHESTERSHIRE, MINCED ONION AND CATSUP AND DRIZZLED THAT OVER THEM IN THE OVEN AND THEN JUST KEPT ADDING MORE.

I would have given 5 stars but hubby felt they were missing something so I split the difference. I followed the recipe exactly and made delicious meatballs. I simmered them in a spaghetti sauce from this site after baking. Best spaghetti donner I have made. I also doubled this recipe to ensure I had leftovers.

Did I overcook them?  They were just okay.  I've made better.  They were just kind of dense (and I didn't over work the meat).  I used a 90/20 ground beef but I've used lean meat before with great success.  Maybe I overcooked them.  After baking, I let them simmer in my homemade sauce for an hour and a half.  Not my best sauce either so maybe I was having an off night.  I'm not sure I'll use this recipe again but don't not try on my account.  I usually pan fry my meatballs and finish in the oven.  I prefer that (more flavorful).

After I made these I realized I had forgotten to put the onion in. However, it did not make a difference these were delicious.  I tended to think they were a little salty but everyone else loved them!  Next time I might try fresh garlic instead of the garlic salt (that that must be more of a personal choice since everyone else found the salt to be spot on).  I did try 2 versions one with milk and the other with ricotta cheese (the cheese went over well, but doesn't mean the other had any leftovers either.  This recipe seems to be very versatile and hard to screw up with all the different versions you can do.  As long as you stick to the main idea they'll be great.  PS also tried half pork and half beef great results with that as well that is why I gave 5 stars because you can change it to your own liking.

Why did I never think of baking my meatballs before! These tasted a bit like my regular meatballs, but the whole roasting trick I never fathomed before. The texture of the meatball was wonderful. I followed the recipe, except I didn't have Italian seasoning so used basil, oregano, parseley, adobo, and some old bay- just a touch of each. I didn't have 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, half of that at best. Very excited to do this again! Thank you!

Fantastic!! Used cayenne in stead of red pepper flakes. Sauteed onion with garlic before adding to meat. All I had was Colby/Jack mix and I can't imagine that it could taste better with any other cheese. Added 1 beaten eggs and a litte bit of milk. Instant favorite in our house! Served with Newman's Own Sockarooni sauce and thin spaghetti noodles. Thanks!!

Delicious! I used tomato sauce instead of hot sauce (1/3 C for 2.5 lbs of ground beef). I used 1/2 tsp thyme, and Panko bread crumbs, omitted the milk and Worcestershire sauce. I baked for a little longer because my meatballs were larger. This makes very tasty meatballs! Another tip is to freeze meatballs and reheat in a crockpot in your favorite sauce for about 3-4 hours on low. The meatballs come out very tender.

Great recipe.  Have made several times.  Family loves it! I  triple the recipe and have leftovers to freeze or next day.   I stick to the recipe for the most part,  but two things I change; use fresh mince garlic--I think garlic salt would be too salty, and I always use ground turkey.  Also, one time I didn't have parmesan and used grated mexican cheese and came out just as good.   Personally, if you alter it too much you are not making the same dish.  I like it as it is!  A keeper!

I made these for a potluck. After cooking as directed, I made a homemade marinara sauce and simmered the meatballs in that for about two hours, then took it to the potluck. I served the meatballs out of the crock pot, with dinner rolls and quartered slices of provolone cheese for "Meatball sliders"! Everyone raved about them. They are very moist and flavorful. We ate the leftovers over spaghetti. My boyfriend loves them, and I do too. Thanks for the great meatball recipe!

I cut back the red pepper flakes to ¼ teaspoon and it was still a bit too hot for us – maybe leave out the hot pepper sauce next time too!  I got 23 balls and put a batch in the freezer after letting them cool.  I’ll serve these on hoagie rolls with marinara sauce or mozzarella cheese, or in spaghetti sauce.

This recipe ROCKS!  I made this because I had most of the items in my pantry, and it turned out to be so good, I can't stop thinking of these meatballs!  I was out of oregano so I added more Italian seasoning.  I used 2% milk and I didn't use extra lean ground beef.  SO YUMMY!  I will be making these meatballs all the time!  Very easy and exceptionally tasty!

Made these last night and baked them for 20 min then put on our favorite bbq sauce and slipped them back into the oven for another 10min. My grandbabies and son thought they were the greatest meatballs ever so I am making them again to have in the freezer for a quick meal.

Just had these for dinner, with angel hair pasta and homemade garlic bread. These meatballs were fantastic, the only change I made was using ground turkey, omitting the salt completely, added some black pepper,used 1 egg instead of milk,and 3 cloves of fresh garlic. They were moist and delicious. I was nervous at first using an entire small onion diced, but I'm glad I did. Will make this again, but will tweek it more to my liking, alittle more heat next time, and maybe another clover of garlic.

I made these last night and found them to be quite... Blah.  They are definitely easy, and it was nice that most of the ingredients were things I had on hand and generally keep stocked in my kitchen, but in terms of taste, I've had much better.

Meatballs were very good but next time I'm going to sub the fresh onion for minced onion (it was wayyy to onion-y) and maybe a little less spice so I can serve them at a party. Thanks!

I used them for my sgetti and they were quite good with the sauce. I didnt add the hot sauce though, and scaled back on the red pepper also. I made about 3lbs worth.

These are pretty good. I did make some changes. Sauteed my onions with garlic before adding and used turkey and ground pork. Replaced the bread crumbs with an egg because I am a low carber. Delish!

Made this for dinner tonight and it was amazing!!!!  I took a reviewers tip and used an egg instead of milk and it worked out great.  I also didn't have any parm. cheese so I substituted some flax seed I had to try and sneak some Omega 3's on my family.  :)

I made this last night.  I followed the recipe almost exactly except I used half lean ground beef and 1/2 ground pork.  It came out really well. I did use all the red pepper flakes and the hot sauce and it was a bit spicy for me.  I really liked it but next time I might cut the spice in half.  My boyfriend likes spicy food and it was just fine for him but he agreed if we make it for anyone else we need to cut the spice is half atleast.  I also cut the salt in half since we were also using garlic salt and the worcestershire sauce can be salts as well.  I may add in the salt next time to see if it makes a difference.  I didn't notice the recipe lacking salt and it wasn't too salty.  I baked these in the oven for 20min and then simmered them in a pot of tomato sauce for about 40 minutes.  I served it over spaghetti squash, as my bf is diabetic and served broccoli and cheese with it.  I would definitely make this again.  Very good meatball recipe.

These meatballs were delicious! I followed the recipe almost exactly. I only made two changes, garlic powder instead of garlic salt and onion powder instead of an onion (laziness, I know). These were quite a hit and made for some very good spaghetti. The only differences I will make next time will be a bit less italian seasoning and a bit more hot sauce. That's no fault of the recipe, only personal preference.

OK, so I followed another reviewer's suggestion to use 1/2 lb. beef + 1/2 lb. pork, and to replace the skim milk w/ 1/2 cup ricotta cheese.  I know thus I'm not exactly rating the original recipe as submitted but they came out really, really GOOD!  Moist and flavorful, and I loved the spicy kick from the crushed red pepper flakes!  The next time I'm serving appetizers, I'll be sure to make these.  Definitely a keeper recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

These were the BEST & most DELICIOUS meatballs I have ever tasted, like the other reviewer I substituted the milk with ricotta cheese and did 1/2 lb of beef and 1/2 lb of pork, I made them real spicy and at the end I put the broiler on to make them a little crispy n the outside, I did not use any sauce like in the picture, they did not need anything else. I can't wait to make them again as we finished them all!

I've made these several times and they are delicious.  They go so fast.  I am on a high protein diet so I'm always looking for dishes to cook with meat and no refined carbs (i.e. pasta, rice, bread).  I did not use milk.  Instead, I used eggs to moisten the mixture.  Also, I try not to use dried herbs.  Instead, I threw in fresh parsley, basil, and oregano from the farmer's market.  These are amazing meatballs - I will use these forever.

Wonderful! I made a double batch and froze half of them (cooked, then cooled) - they're easy and delicious to re-heat in a sauce too.  Even better, they improve a regular tomato sauce, balancing out the acidity from the tomatoes wonderfully.

Delicious!  I made a couple changes, I used Italian seasoned turkey meat, I substituted a cup of ricotta for the skim milk and added about a 1/2 cup of Parmesan (I used the grated kind, not the dry powder type that you get at Pizza Hut).  Next time I want more Worcestershire sauce.  Yum!

My boyfriend, his brother and I loved the meatballs! We are all fans of spicy foods so it was really awesome with the hot sauce! The only thing I want to know is how to not get it to burn on the bottom? Thank you for the recipe!!!!

I LOVED these meatballs. i didnt change anything in the recipe i used it as is. i did cook mine in the slow cooker in a tomato sauce and we all ate it as spaghetti and meatballs.  It does taste a bit like meatloaf but i love meatloaf, so i liked that.  i cooked them on high for 2 hours then on low for 3 or 4. they were really tender and melt-in-your mouth good. will def. be making this again.

These were ok. I'm not sure what it was exactly but for us they tasted a little off with tomato sauce. I think they would be a better stand alone meatball. I cut the red pepper back by half and while it wasn't hot it did leave a after taste that I guess I'm not used to in meatballs.

I used ground venison in place of the beef. I added like 7 dashes of tabasco and used cayenne instead of flakes (just what I had on hand). I really liked these but thought there was too much diced onion; I might cut down on that or sub for minced dried next time. Will make like this again. Thanks!

This was a phenomenal recipe for meatballs!  I made a bunch of minis just to try it out and have now saved it as my new defacto meatball recipe.  Other than not having sea salt, I followed this to the 't'.

I LOVE these!  I have made them a few times now and oh my!  The have nice heat and are just down right tastey.  I didn't add the hot sauce (didn't have any) and use turkey most of the time, but otherwise made them just as written. I make a double batch and freeze them so I can have them to add to sauces and to make quick sandwiches. So awesome! Thanks so much for sharing. They are a family favorite!

These were fabulous!!  I made quite a few changes: reduced the pepper flakes to about 1/4 tsp., omitted the hot pepper sauce, (we like spicy, but not in our meatballs) used feta cheese instead of parmesan (didn't have parmesan) used quick oats in place of the bread crumbs to make them gluten free, and I added a can of tomatoes from my garden.  They were so good....I served them in red sauce with tortellinis.  I almost always change recipes......but some cooks just have to : ) I will make these again!

Made these for dinner tonight, so yummy! I didn't even want to wait to put them with the spaghetti. We like it spicy in this house so I added a little more hot sauce. Other than that followed the recipe to the T. This is goingto be my new staple for meatballs. I think this would even be great for meatloaf as well.

Simply wonderful. What else can I say.

I'd rate it higher if possible. My mouth was so happy. Nirvana was the best way to describe these.

DELICIOUS meatball!  I made seasoned breadcrumbs out of some Gluten Free cornbread to make it wheat-free.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  I am giving it 4 stars only b/c following the baking instructions still left my meatballs a little dried out.  Next time I will cook a little lower/slower.  Wonderful recipe!

It is a very good meatball recipe. I cut the crushed red pepper in half but still felt it was a bit much for my 3 year old and myself. Next time I'll try just a quarter of what the recipe calls for- for the crushed red pepper. I was very pleased with this recipe, it was very flavorful, but it went perfect once I poured pasta sauce over the meatballs.

These were good and I liked that they were baked. Used them to make meatball subs, which everyone liked. Only change I made was to use dehydrated onion flakes insteaD of fresh onion. Thanks!

The Worcestershire sauce and red paper flakes are the key to these meatballs. Don't hold back on either ingredient. If you don't have bread crumbs, you can toast regular bread and chop it up into small pieces. I love eating these with the Cowboy Mashed Potatoes found on this site. Easy and delicious.

The miniature food critics who have told me on more than once occasion that they hated red meat devoured these!  For that alone I'd give this 50 stars if I could.  I like the slight kick from the pepper and how these just about melted in my mouth.  This is defiantly going on a regular dinner rotation now.

Really just ok for me.  I used 85/15 ground beef, and I thought they came out pretty dry. They could really use some sauce. The flavor was ok - kind of meatloafy, as one reviewer said. In fact, the ingredients are almost identical to a meatloaf recipe I got from this site! Also, I cut back on the Italian seasoning and oregano, and l felt they still overpowered the flavor of the meatball.  My husband said "they were alright, but not special".  I'll look for another recipe next time I make meatballs.

These were pretty good, very moist.  I've always baked my meatballs rather than fried them, less mess.  I actually felt they could use more heat, but that wouldn't be hard to adjust, just add more pepper flakes or hot sauce.  Would use again.

Holly Molly this recipe is out of this world!!! Let me tell you not to second guess this recipe.  The meat was so flavorful and tender.  Yummo!!!! I made meatball sandwiches with it... using the  Worlds Best Lasagna recipe (sauce only) to put over the meatballs. Next time I think I will try making hamburgers with this recipe.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This was a nice change from my usual meatball recipe.  I just ate one right out of the oven, with no sauce, and they have a great flavor.  I used half pork, half beef, and reduced the crushed red pepper to just 1/4 teaspoon, however they are still quite spicy...delicious to me, but might be too much for my kids.  Next time I'll have to use even less of the red pepper.  Still, these are very tasty!

SO GOOD.  I followed this recipe exactly, except for leaving out the crushed red pepper flakes to avoid heartburn from too much heat.  I baked these in the oven as recommended and then reheated them later in my own red sauce and served over spaghetti.  The meatballs were moist and delicious.

Definitely Nirvana!  Our family is not into spicy foods, so when I tripled the meat, I only doubled everything else.  This worked for us.  And for the first time ever, my meatballs did not crumble after baking.  The meatballs were disappearing before they hit the freezer!

I only made a half-batch and used ground turkey instead of beef, but these were delicious!  The red pepper flakes gave it a little kick. If making for children, I would probably not use as much.  Overall, great recipe.  Thanks!

I made these the other night, and they are awesome!  I have never baked matballs before, that's basically why I choose it.  I omitted the red pepper flakes, and I added half of a small container of ricotta cheese like someone else suggested, and they were very moist and flavorful!  Will definetly make again!

So I have made these a few times and always a huge hit. Last time I made them appetizer sized. I had to sub a few things I used regular bread crumbs, I used smooth cottage cheese instead of the milk and I put 2 tablespoons of hyanne pepper instead of hot pepper sauce and red pepper flakes. Oh wow they were spicy but so yummy. For the top I used a 1/4 cup of ketchup 4 TBL of brown sugar and 3 TBL worcestershire sauce. Then I spoon it over the meat balls and let them cook together making a sweet and spicy meat ball. They were such a huge hit my boyfriend licked the plate. YAY thank you so much it was a true Nirvana in my home. Will use this many times to come. everyone said it was the best meatballs they had ever had. I love that.. HAHA

Loved these.  I only left out the hot sauce and replaced the diced onion with onion powder.  Also, used part lean ground beef and part meatball mix (beef, veal, pork).  They were a huge hit with the "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" which I followed closely.

Awesome meatballs. My husband is a very picky eater. I added these to my homemade sauce. We both were amazed. Next day made a triple batch to freeze. Thank you :)

These were great. I actually pan fried them, sort of a bad idea, alittle bit of sticking going on but they still came out great.I put them in a pasta of vermicelli with zucchini,squash,onion and halfed tomatoes with juice and let simmer, fantastic! The boyfriend raved about them and wants them again

Like some other reviewers said, I added ricotta cheese instead of the skim milk, and I used plain Panko bread crumbs and stuck with the stated amount of Italian seasoning.  Came out absolutely fantastic.  Next time I'll try the pork/beef combo.

We loved this recipe!  I made it as written and used the meatballs for subs.  But we ate them as leftovers with pasta and of course still loved them.  I have a meatloaf recipe that uses milk so I had no hesitation to use it here.  The milk makes them very moist and you don't need the egg to hold it all together.  Great combo of flavors!

I didnt really care for this recipe.  I served it at a family function and there just wasn't much flavor.  I have preferred other meatball recipes much much more.

So good.  I made the balls the night before we wer planning on having these for dinner and then baked them in the morning.  For dinner, all we had to do was reheat the meatballs in some marinara sauce to top our spaghetti.  They were incredible and everyone went back for more.  Even my picky son, who normally would have scraped the meatball off to just eat the pasta, ate 2 of these meatballs.  Fantastic recipe!

Made these without the red pepper or hot pepper sauce.  A huge hit.  I had extra and I planned to freeze them, but my husband kept eating them every time he passed by the tray, so I didn't even have to!  Great for making ahead!

The name speaks for itself, right? I'm very impressed with how easy and delicious these meatballs are. They put my mom's to shame ;-) 
Contrary to what I've read from other reviews, I increased the spiciness of the recipe after the first time I made it.

Very good with an extra bite that I don't usually expect from a meatball.  Easy to make ahead and then pop in a crock pot with some sauce.

These are delish!!!  I doubled the recipe and used two eggs instead of milk.  I used 80/20 beef, next time I'll go with something leaner b/c they got a little greasy after baking.  After cooking, I put them in a crockpot on warm with some marinara and served on hoagie rolls with italian cheeses.  Everyone raved :)  That's all we can hope for is everyone else enjoying it...

I used this as a base to follow, I didn't have any worcestershire sauce and I put a 1/4 the amount of red pepper in.  FLIPPING AWSOME, moist and tasty!
Next time I'll put in half the red pepper as I didn't even notice the small amount i put in.  I did go half and half of beef and pork.  I've never had better meatballs.  I used them for spaghetti and meatballs and meatball subs the next day.

This recipe is fantastic and can be made low fat by using 96% fat free ground beef. I like the fact that the meatballs are baked, which frees up the stove top for boiling the pasta and making the sauce. In the past, my stove top got a little too crowded!

Nirvana is RIGHT! I just read this recipe this morning and decided to make them for tonight's footbal game. We're having friends over, so I quadrupled the recipe (got about 58 nice-sized meatballs)...the only thing I did different was that I browned them first, then allowed them to simmer in my homeade sauce in the crockpot. I've already had four...I can't STOP myself, they are FANTASTIC!! Thank you SO much for sharing!!!

This recipe produced a very flavorful (somewhat spicy) meatball.  I did have to make a few changes, but nothing drastic.  I used 1/2 lb. ground beef and a 1/2 lb. ground venison, 1% milk, and 1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper.  I might decrease the onion next time or use the dried minced onion, as DH thought these were too "oniony," though I had no problem with it.  Next time I'll be sure to double the recipe and freeze some for a quick meal.  Thanks!

Great meatballs! Made the recipe exactly as stated, minus a little bit of the salt. The italian seasoning was a little much, so I will reduce it next time. I used Reggiano Parmesan because it's so much better than the powdered, fake Parmesan cheese in a can. Thanks for the recipe!

Yum. These were really easy to make and they taste amazing. I've never been successful at making meatballs before and this recipe worked out great for me. I used my small scoop to portion them out, made it really easy. Thanks for the recipe I will be using this again!

I just made this tonight... and it was a HIT!!! Thanks so much for this recipe! I was looking to get away from the traditional Italian meatball but not stray all the way from the idea... so I could add sauce if I could.... only thing I didn't have was the hot pepper sauce but it was still amazing!

Didn't really like the flavor. Different than other meatballs I've made. I also didn't chop the onions finely enough - make sure you do that!

I found these a little too salty, so I think I will use minced garlic, rather than garlic salt and perhaps a bit less salt next time.  But my husband has not been so happy with a meal in a LONG time!  He had two helpings of these meatballs in Marinara Sauce II (from this site) over pasta and raved!  Also, these were amazingly easy to make in big batches and freeze.  We have a lot of beef, and I will be making these to freeze and provide quick meals when I am busy.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy and lots of flavor!  I had a hard time keeping the meatballs from falling apart after they cooked.  I tripled the beef, but just doubled other ingredients.  I also cooked my onion in olive oil first.  They were a little salty, so next time I will cut back on the salt.

Based on the reviews I felt like this recipe was a little overrated. The meatballs were good not great. Also with the hot sauce and red pepper flakes they were a little too spicy for my little one.

I'm sorry, I really thought this would be good with all the fabulous reviews, but no one would even eat it.  The onions were CRUNCHY, and ruined the whole effect.  My BF says they're just like these things his mom used to make when he was little, except those were Meat CAKES, not meat balls.  They used to eat them with ketchup.  I would never make these again.

Pretty good! I didn't add the hot sauce because we can't take that much spice! However, it was good overall. We made this with diced tomatoes and cappelini pasta. Will make again!

I really like the overall recipe and I've used it many times although I have made some changes. It works better by replacing the milk with an egg and using fresh breadcrumbs, not seasoned, and the onion needs to be very finely chopped or minced too and for me personally no salt, especially as you are adding Parmesan. We find we prefer to make this into burgers, baked in the oven for 20 minutes or so, turning once halfway through.

I made these last night for dinner and they were really great. I followed the recipe exactly except that I totally forgot to add the Parmesan cheese, which bummed me out when I realized it. These are delicious meatballs and were super easy. I definitely need to work on my dicing technique, though, so I can get the onion small enough--chunks of onion were tasty but unappetizing to look at. ^_^ Also, I used 1 shake of Louisiana Hot Sauce but next time will add a bit more--I'd like to try it a bit spicier. My meatballs stuck kinda bad to my cookie sheet though and it's going to be a total pain to scrub up. Minus 1 star for clean up. :P Looking forward for leftovers for lunch!

These turned out great! My husband & 3 year old LOVED these!  I omitted the red pepper flakes & I didn't have any bread crumbs on hand so I made my own by toasting up some stale bread w/ EVOO and then crumbling them into the mix.  I also grated the onion so it wasn't in any big chunks in the meatballs.  I tuned them half way through baking then I put them in my sauce to simmer for a little while.  They were great reheated in meatballs subs the next day too!  This recipe is a keeper!!!

Yum! These were almost perfect. Next time I will decrease the salt as they were a bit on the salty side. I made these with ground turkey and added about a half a tsp of fennel seeds and black pepper. Easy recipe, can't wait to make it again!

Excellent; I used regular bread crumbs because that was all I had.  I also used 2% milk, and regular salt-they were still outstanding.

Awesome meatballs! They were so flavorful and delicious! I doubled the recipe, cut back on the red pepper flakes and used regular breadcrumbs. They were great! The best thing is that they held together perfectly.

My family was crazy about this - I didn't have any oregano but it didn't mattter.  I doubled the recipe and froze some and used some for meatball sandwiches by taking a loaf of ital bread and removing some of the soft middle - cut up the meatballs and added mozzarella and sauce and heated for 15 min wrapped in foil.  My picky 12-year-old even liked them.  These are the most tasty meatballs I have ever made.  They are easy too.  I will keep these in the freezer for quick meals (if they last!!!)  I work outside of the home and am thrilled to find recipes I can use to make many different meals by cooking once.

Perfect meatball recipe!  The only substitution I used was ground turkey in place of beef.  This is the first meatball recipe I've ever used that didn't call for egg.  I don't think I'll be using egg any longer in my meatballs.

Good flavor, but way too much salt. If I made it again, I'd reduce the salt to 1/8 tsp or less. There is enough salt in the parmesan cheese, meat, garlic salt, bread crumbs and worsesterchire sauce.

I have never made meatballs, and am not a meatball connoisseur but I know what taste good, and to me these weren't all that great. I thought there was too much seasoning, which competed with my sauce. I guess I was expecting these to be something wonderful with a name like meatball nirvana, and this fell short. Won't make again.

I finally made these! They are delish! I didnt make any changes. The only tips I have is to line your cookie sheets with foil for easy cleanup. Also, a way to check the seasoning of the meatballs is to cook a little patty on the stove top. Then you can taste and adjust your seasoning as needed. Thanks LTH for a great recipe :)

These did turn out fantastic as far as taste and all went, however, I used cheap hamburg and they literally baked in grease.  Oh well, there's always next time... and there will be a next time.......

I actually haven't tried the original recipe; as I printed it out I chef-inspirationally modified the ingredients for a super tender and delicious meatball, and the result was 5-star. I used fattier 80/20 beef. Instead of the onion diced, I grated it on the small side of the grater for an extra fine texture. Instead of the garlic salt I used a large clove of fresh garlic, crushed (mince it and use kosher salt as an abrasive and the back of your knife to mash it into a paste). Instead of Italian seasoning I used 1 tsp. dry basil, 1 tsp. fresh thyme minced, 1 tsp. fresh rosemary minced, and 2 tsp. dry oregano. I kept the red pepper flakes, dash hot sauce (Frank's!), and Worc. sauce. Instead of the skim milk I used an egg. Kept the parm. cheese, and used plain bread crumbs instead of seasoned (because of the seasonings already in the meat). When I baked it I put the meatballs in a 9x13 baking dish and filled it with water about a third up the meatballs. This steams them at the same time and keeps everything super moist and tender. Doing it this way came out very good! Thanks for the great base recipe, I'll be making them like this again!

I had to omit the onion, garlic and bread crumbs, but I subbed with extra Tuscan Sunset (Italian seasoning from Penzey's), and I used cornflake crumbs instead of bread crumbs, and lactose-free milk instead of regular. I used less crushed red pepper (kids!) but we all enjoyed these! Thanks, lth! I'll make these again!

These were absolutely delicious!!  My husband and I think most recipes are under-seasoned, so we increased the amounts of most of the ingredients.  We also think you can never have too much onion, so we used a large one instead of a small one.  I also saw that one person used ricotta in place of milk, which sounded great, so I did that, too.  I didn't have any seasoned bread crumbs, so I just used plain, but you couldn't tell since I had increased the other spices.  These were the best meatballs I've ever had, by far!!

WOW! These were amazing! Made them for dinner and my husband couldn't get enough.  :)  I felt that they had a lot of oregano flavor though...but my husband loves oregano so he thought they were just perfect as is, and I can't wait to make these again!

Great start but add 1# of Italian sausage and use fresh basil,oregano and Italian parsley. If your going to use fresh herbs double the amount suggested in recipe. I also double the amount of cheese. Weigh out mixture to make 1 ounce meatballs. This will create Over the Top Nirvana Meatballs.

Good meatballs!  I doubled the recipe and froze half of them.  I used 1 lb of ground pork and 1 lb of hamburger.  I also used Ricotta cheese instead of the skim milk based on someone's recommendation, I found I still had to add some milk, however.  They turned out EXCELLENT!

The flavor is out of sight! We really liked them and we would have liked them much better if they hadn't over-cooked. :(  I followed directions but dropped 25 deg because I have convection oven.  They still burned.  But they weren't tough!  Just a little more flavorful ;)  Thanks for the recipe.  I know how to adjust my dumb oven for next time.

These were good except I felt there was too much of the worchestire sauce in it.  Maybe cut that in half and i would give them 5 stars.

This was delicious.  I've been trying to make a decent meatball for awhile and finally I found one.  Something I tweaked was I only added 1/4 teaspoon hot pepper flakes and no not sauce.  Next time I would add a bit of garlic too.  One can never have enough garlic.  I will definitely make three batches next time just to freeze!

I made these meatballs last night and followed the recipe exactly as written...they turned out FABULOUS! I also had some french rolls that I scooped some of the contents out of and put 3 meatballs each inside.  I topped the meatballs with a 6 cheese spaghetti sauce, covered with mozzarella cheese and baked for 10-15 minutes.  The rolls got just enough crunch and the cheese melted perfectly! My boyfriend loved the meatball subs and definately wants me to make them again!

This sounds great.  If I want the meatballs to use it with spaghetti how long would you think the meatballs should simmer in the sauce?

This was my first successful attempt at meatballs in years. I used my stand mixer to incorporate all of the ingredients (although I left out the hot sauce and pepper flakes as I did not have any), and a #40 food disher made them the perfect size.  They were delightful, and the extras froze beautifully for another dinner.

Only change I made was added fresh garlic instead of the garlic salt. Otherwise it was made to the T. I tossed them onto a homemade white garlic sauce and angel hair pasta. Freaking LOVED IT and so did my boyfriend! I'll definitely be making this recipe again.

This was my first attempt at homemade meatballs, so I have nothing previous to compare them to.  I followed the recipe as is and we both liked them very much.  I plan to freeze half for meatball subs next week.  Mmmmmmmm!

These were the best meatballs by far!  I used a pinch of cayenne pepper instead of the crushed red pepper flakes since I didn't have any. I added about 1/2 tsp more of garlic salt, too.  Also, we didn't have any Frank's Red Hot Sauce so I used a few drops of Taco Bell hot sauce. It wasn't an ideal substitute, but they still tasted awesome. My family gobbled them up so quick and the next day were asking me when I'm going to cook the Nirvana Meatballs again :)

This is the perfect meatball recipe! I just made this tonight and the family loved it.  I used onion powder instead of chopped onion, and the flavor was great. They smelled so good baking in the oven too! Thank you for the great recipe!

Great recipe, i’ve changed it a couple of times and it still turns out great, everyone always loves them. I’ve substituted the milk for one egg and they turned out wonderful. I’ve also substituted the onion for about 3 pieces of celery, chopped finely and then added onion poweder and that also worked great. I usually stuff them with provolone and it’s wonderful.

This is pretty much the best meatball recipe ever!  I made it almost exactly as written though I subbed eggs for the milk, made it GF by using Quinoa Flakes instead of breadcrumbs and grated the onion on a box grater so the onion would be fully cooked.  It really makes a difference to mix all the wet ingredients and seasonings with the breadcrumbs/quinoa flakes and let sit for 10-20 minutes first before mixing with the meat (I would recommend doing this especially if you're using the quinoa flakes so they have a chance to soften up)  The only thing I would do different next time (and I'm already looking forward to next time with how awesome they turned out) would be to use garlic powder and/or fresh garlic instead of garlic salt as I found them a touch too salty, though not overly so.  All in all, a really excellent recipe!

I had high hopes for these meatballs...followed recipe exactly ... sorry to say it will not be a keeper.  The Italian seasoning was too potent and overtook the flavoring of the meatballs.  I will go back to my basil / parsley with a pinch of oregano seasoning.  I still will bake my meatballs as I don't like to pull raw meatballs in my gravy.

No changes necessary.  Just watch your dash of hot sauce because my dash was too much.  By too much I mean about two tablespoons spewed out since I didn't realize the metering  spout on the bottle was stolen and not replaced.  

This is a very nice tasting recipe and I complimented it by making a homemade Italian style spaghetti sauce to accompany the meatballs in a bed of spaghetti.

Great recipe , however I fry the meatballs to get a slightly crunchy exterior and seal all the flavor in before finishing .
Then I would finish cooking in either a red sauce or in the oven.  Makes a big difference.

Excellent recipe!  I followed it exactly but did adjust for 12 servings.  I always follow a recipe to the letter first time out.  These have a slight kick which makes it interesting.  Moist inside and great flavor all around.  Highly recommend!  Can't wait to serve at vacation down the Jersey shore.  Thanks for sharing.

I used this recipe my first time making meatballs  and they turned out great, very flavorful! I might skip the onions next time though.

I followed the recipe with the exception of  the hot seasonings. I used ground sirloin; maybe they would have been better with ground chuck, as they were quite dense. The flavor wasn't pleasant. Sorry, won't make them again.

Made these so many times I have the recipe memorized! Only change I made was when doubling it I used ground turkey and beef...multi grain crackers instead of bread crumbs (my daughter is allergic to corn). So much love for this recipe! It's a requested item for every food-event my hubbub company puts on! Ya make me look good LTH!!

The only change I made was using half beef and half pork. They ended up tasting like breadcrumbs with seasoning and a kick. I probably won't make these again.

This was super easy and amazingly good.  I did however not have bread crumbs on hand, so instead I put in 1/4th cup of oatmeal, it still turned out great, and I don't think I want to change it.

This is the recipe I use when I'm hankering after homemade meatballs. Wonderful as is but I've altered it through the years to please our family's palette. Instead of all ground beef I use half ground beef and half hot Italian sausage, mince the onions very fine, roll them loosely in to roundish shapes but not a tight ball and instead of 1-1/2" balls mine are usually 3/4"- 1".

I added an egg and used a bit of siracha instead of franks red hot.
Amazing..
Also instead of baking them I fried them quickly in about half an inch of oil, 3 minutes per side to add some texture to the exterior. Then I cooked them with my pasta sauce.

My husband really looks forward to me making these meatballs. This last time, I cooked them on the Big Green Egg.....Oh. my. gosh! I lined a pan with foil and lightly sprayed with Pam. I added one Apple wood chunk to the coals and cooked for 20 minutes at 400 degrees. Unless weather dictates, I will ALWAYS cook them in the BGE!

This is now the base for any meatballs I make. Only changes are: I split the meat to half ground pork, half ground beef and I use onion powder instead of onions. I nonupled the recipe (meaning multiplied by 9!) for tons of meatballs. Then I freeze them on a baking sheet and portion them 12 to a bag and vacuuming seal them before storing in the freezer.

Just the right blend of spices and kick without bring too much. Bsked on aa rack -no grease and no mess. Taste great alone and can't wait to add to a pit of simmering sauce.  Thanks for sharing this tasty recipe!

So good!  Highly recommend it!  The only thing I did different was omit the garlic salt and I cooked them on the stove, and they still turned out great.

Great recipe as is!  The only change I made was to use ground venison rather than beef, because you can't get any leaner than that.  Will definitely make again as a double or triple batch and freeze the extras.  Some reviews indicate to roll the meatballs over half way through cooking and I think I'll try that next time because they did stick to a Teflon baking sheet.  Also will lightly grease the baking sheet next time.

My family thought it was a little spicy so I guess I'd cut down the red pepper flake just a little.  I added some minced garlic and used ground turkey instead of beef and almond milk instead of regular milk because that's what I had.  I thought they were flavorful and delicious with a little kick.  I plan to make them again.

I tweaked the recipe a bit. In addition to the ground beef, I added 1lb of sage sausage (makes them super tender) The dry ingredients, I ground with a mortar and pestle. The onion, I diced in a Ninja and after hand mixing the ingredients in a bowl, I threw everything in the Ninja again, until it was almost pasty in texture.

Hubby says it's a keeper and that's good because he makes great meatballs. I used 2 1/2 lbs. ground white turkey and 1 lb. lean ground beef.  Other than this change I, like so many others, followed the recipe to the T.  We ended up with 76 meatballs that are 3/4 oz. each.   Needless to say, we have plenty to freeze since we each ate only 3 meatballs.  We ate it over spaghetti squash with marinara sauce and topped it off with fresh Parmesan cheese.  Thanks for such a yummy recipe!!

We loved these meatballs. Recipe is spot on for flavors. I enjoyed them more the second day after sitting in marinara all night. I used two pounds of beef and a #40 portioner/scoop and it made about 40 meatballs. Such a hit and my first time making homemade meatballs. Thank you LTH!

I liked this recipe... I did cook it a different way to make it more moist. I first browned them in a frying pan with some olive oil and then simmered it with the sauce... I also added 1/8 Tsp of minced garlic which gave it some more flavor

I made this for tomorrow nights dinner. I hope we have some left to eat tomorrow night. I doubled the recipe, because we like leftovers. My only change was to use fresh garlic instead of garlic salt. My husband & I have each sampled 3 meatballs already. I hope the kids get some. The house smells amazing too! Thanks for a great recipe.

good recipe.   I did increase the parmesan, Worcestershire sauce and used sazon Goya bread crumbs. used a quarter of the onion and chopped it small as possible for the picky eaters.  I baked the meatballs for 15 min at 375 and took them out and placed into the pasta sauce cooked on low for a few hours and they came out perfect. I used two canned spaghetti sauce and spruced it up with brown sugar, butter, Italian seasoning, piece of bell pepper for that butter taste, garlic, powder, and onion powder can change a basic can of pasta sauce.  kid approved

This recipe rocks and rolls. I made these meatballs for meatball and marinara sandwiches. Due to the exquisite taste of the meatballs, my honey bunny scarfed his sandwich down in about 2 minutes flat. I did not make any changes to this recipe.

These really where great I was apprehensive because I've always used pork for my meat balls, I didn't have Parmesan on hand so I used feta also didn't use milk but an egg! Cooked em in the oven then threw them in my sauce on low to keep warm! Everyone loved them!

These were delicious! Now I did add a 1/2 pound of sweet italian sausage and subbed in 1 egg and splash of heavy whipping cream for the milk but they were gobbled up! I will totally make them over and over again!

My husband doesn't like onions so I used 1/2 tsp onion powder and they were awesome! He also doesn't like spicy things so I left out the hot sauce too but he loved them!

Thank you for your recipe.  The meatballs I always make are really good and tasty.  Decided to try something different and made these.  Didn't change a thing and I have to say we really enjoyed them.  I'll make these again and freeze them so we can swap off between our usual and Nirvana!

Never would have thought baked meatballs could be so good!
Used pork/beef/veal combo pack.  Only thing I didnt do was add the hot sauce as I was afraid the kids wouldnt eat it.  They were very flavorful but a tad denser then I would have liked.  Would definitely make again but will look up how to make fluffier.

I doubled the recipe by adding a pound of ground pork. Also, a chopped handful of fresh Italian parsley.  Made the meatballs 2.5" in diameter and baked for 25 min.  Froze half. Used other half, plus pasta sauce for meatball sandwiches with melted provolone.  Delicious!

These were the best meatballs I've ever tried! I followed the recipe using only beef. I baked them for 16 minutes and then put them in with my spaghetti sauce that had been simmering for hours. Best spaghetti ever!

My little guys and (not a meatball loving) hubby love these. Due to allergies, I omitted the Parmesan cheese and milk and they taste fabulous! I make a huge batch then freeze them to add to spaghetti sauce for a quick meal.

Nice recipe, I think my fiance messed it up and suggested putting it at 425. I enjoyed this recipe but may decrease the red pepper to 1/2 teaspoon instead of 3/4. I'm a wuss when it comes to spicy. These are fine for me, but would be more enjoyable if I tasted the meatball and other seasonings  rather than jus feel the kick of the red pepper. Again, it's a personal preference

This was quick and easy to prepare. I used a mix of ground beef, pork and veal. I omitted the worcestshire sauce because I'm not a fan of it.  I would cut down on the salt the next time to about half. It was delicious!

Our meatball loving family enjoyed this recipe. Like another reviewer, I used and egg in place of milk. I also added some frozen spinach. I'm thrilled that this recipe cooks the meatballs quickly and thoroughly! A winner that I've saved for future use!

Fantastic! Better than store or restaurant. Made minor quantity changes to suit our tastes, otherwise pretty much stuck to the recipe. The biggest change is substitute crushed red peppers and Frank's Red Hot with Sriracha sauce. 

Froze a bunch for those quick easy meals during the week or unexpected guests. The house smelled awesome!

Made mine with ricotta instead of milk.  Delicious, but the oregano flavor is very strong.  I might cut that in half next time.

I was looking for an easy way out from my usual meatball recipe.  The only change I made was using 1 lb of meatball mix (ground beef,  veal, ground pork). I've never been compelled to write a review of any recipe before.  These are flavorful,  moist and very easy to make.  The only change I will make in the future is to reduce the amount of red pepper and omit the hot sauce.  Was a bit too spicy to be a "go to" dish. But I will never use another meatball recipe again.  Simply delicious.

My husband loved these meatballs. I thought they were good but a little too spicy for me even though I decreased the amount f red pepper flakes.

I covered them with beef gravy that I added mushrooms to.

Will make again but not so spicy!

This was the "BEST" meatball recipe I have ever tried.  I overdid it on the Oregano which was my own fault.  I will not do that again.  But, thanks so much for sharing this recipe.  It's a keeper!

I really love this recipe. Not too finicky, just good flavorful ingredients that I generally have on hand. I make a double batch, flash freeze right on the cookie sheets. I then place them in freezer bags so that I can pull them out of the freezer as needed.

Great! Quick and easy! I don't drink milk and I avoid beef so I used ground pork and almond milk instead and they turned out wonderful. We will definitely make this again!

I tasked hubby to make these meatballs. He did such a wonderful job! We-ooops-He followed the directions to the "t", however, I think he added too much hot sauce-MEN. Use garlic powder instead garlic salt. Or add no salt at all. Make sure you chop onions very small or all you will get is a mouthful of onions(sorry, honey). Make extras to freeze!

I thought this recipe turned out fantastic.  I followed exactly except for red flake peppers b/c I didn't have.  We ate half and froze half for another time.  Everyone including my picky children ate them.  My only comment would be that when you put in the oven I would recommend lining the baking sheet b/c I spent a lot of time cleaning it.

Best meatballs ever! This is a five-star recipe as is, but even better if you use 1/2 beef 1/2 pork, fresh garlic, and ricotta instead of milk. Also, we like spicy, so I put several dashes of hot sauce. Thank you for this delish recipe!

Very good.  I doubled the recipebut didn't double the red pepper, using half ground pork.   It was plenty spicy for us.  Good meatballs.

Love this recipe - the red pepper flakes add a very delicious kick of spicy flavor that doesn't feel "too spicy".

To me this recipe contains a lot of onion considering it only calls for 1 pound of ground beef. I was skeptical at first but used it anyway and the meatballs came out fine. I made these tonight for meatball subs and it was very delicious! My picky 9yo who hates onions even at all of his. Nice change from the norm.  :)

Used minced veal (I know, not politically correct) and cooked the meatballs directly in the marinara sauce.  It was delish!  Made again but this time I used beef and pork and baked the meatballs in the oven.  When meatballs were made, I simmered them in a tomato sauce.  Very good!

Really great meatballs.  I didn't add the hot sauce and added about half the red pepper (a packet from the pizza hut package)and it gave it flavor without the spicy punch.  Otherwise cooked exactly as is (I double the recipe or else it would be gone immediately) and everyone goes crazy over it.  Bravo!

This was fantastic. First time I made them I mostly followed it right it but took a few things out (because I don't like spicy food) and replaced the milk with marinara and then baked then in buiscuits with marinara and cheese. Went over so well! This next time I wanted to put them in a teriyaki dish so instead of oregano and Italian spices I used Chinese 5 spice and replaced Worcestershire with soy sauce and just omitted hot sauce and pepper flakes. They turned out perfect and went great with teriyaki!

These are spicy meatloaf balls. These would have been better served on mashed potatoes with a piquant sauce. I think the onion, Worcestershire sauce and pepper flakes push it over the edge. I pride myself on my homemade meatballs but thought I'd change it up with a different recipe. My kids agreed that I should have stuck with my standard.... disappointing.

The texture was on the dry side even after substituting ricotta cheese for the milk and the spices were much too overwhelming. 
Won't be making this one again.

Excellent recipe. I used 2% milk since I didn't have skim. My wife doesn't like the peppers so mixed everything but the peppers then divided the meat in 1/2 along with the rest of ingredients. Added the peppers to half then added the rest of ingredients. Both meatballs came out great. Moist and flavorful.

Too much seasoning!  Even though I used plain breadcrumbs instead of seasoned, I found that there was way too much oregano and Italian seasoning for my taste.  I also used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt and the meatballs were still too salty due to the Worchestershire sauce and salt.  I'll go back to my old recipe.

I gave this recipe 4 stars however my nonna made meatballs very differently and I think I am partial to hers. I did find these too dense for my liking and the seasoning really took over. I did not find them spicy at all like other reviewers did. I won't likely make these again because I think I will stick to my traditional family recipe but I'm glad I tried them. I can see how others like them so much. Thanks for sharing your recipe lovestohost.

I'm giving this 3 stars because with a few minor tweaks it's amazing but as written I don't care for it. Primary problem is the uncooked onions. The onions barely cook in the ~20 baking time. Redid with pre-cooked onions that I sauteed on medium until they were very soft but not caramelized and it was amazing. Also needs more salt and less red pepper flakes /hot sauce and this is coming from someone who uses very liberal amounts of salt and loves spicy food. I was most surprised that no egg was needed and these come out extremely light.

Super easy! Thought even one small onion was too much for a pound of ground beef. Next time will use less.

We've been using the recipe for a couple of years now.  It is our GOTO recipe for meatballs.  We use dried minced onions instead of fresh and it still turns out great.  That's the only thing we've done different, until last night.

Last night I decided to try frying them!  OMG!   Just a little dab of olive oil in a hot pan.  At first, you'll have to manually flip the meatballs as they fry, but once they've gotten a sear around most of the outer area, you can just jostle the pan around to keep them spinning.   I didn't fry them to the point that they were finished.  Instead, I put them in the oven once they got a good sear.  I only had to cook them in the oven for 7 or 8 minutes before they were finished.  And they didn't bathe in grease while cooking in the oven because frying them got most of the grease out.   Absolutely delicious!

First time hubby liked these but I wasn't too crazy.  Too much oregano or italian seasoning for me.  Second time I made the following changes and they were soooo much better.  Added an egg because it was missing a binder.  Reduced oregano and italian seasoning to 1/2 tsp each.  Used 1/2 lb ground beef and 1/2 lb ground veal.  Now, they are close to nirvana.

I didn't know if I"d like them with the worchestershire sauce and the hot pepper sauce, but they were really good. I'll definitely make these again.

These were just okay.  I was definitely disappointed after reading all of the rave reviews and I followed the recipe to a T.  Definitely worth trying, just not the one for our family!

Best recipe I have found yet for meatballs.  I made this recipe using ground chicken and subsituting 1/2 teaspoon onion powder for the chopped onion.  The results are fantastic!  I will make these again!  Thank you Lovestohost!

I have made this recipe with beef and turkey and they both work great. I reduce the milk a bit as it tends to make the mixture too wet and add some more Parmesan cheese. Sometimes I don't have all the ingredients and it substitutes well. They are moist and very flavorful! Great meatball recipe.

I've made this recipe a couple times now, and really love it!! We use ground turkey and omit the red pepper flakes but otherwise the texture is impressive (especially when using turkey). Even our 'meat shy' kids enjoyed them tremendously. The best part, its easy enough to make on a weeknight when I'm tired from a long day of work (and makes great left-over meatball sandwiches).

My favorite meatball recipe. I add to my tomato sauce and have also served with brown gravy and mashed potatoes.  Outstanding.  Today I am  substituting this recipe for my porcupine meatball recipe with the addition of rice and will serve with sautéed cabbage. I use fresh garlic and my own fresh breadcrumbs. I followed example of using ricotta cheese in place of the milk. Love this recipe!

This was soooooooooo good. I substituted ground turkey, and added about 1/2 # ground italian sausage.  While these baked I warmed spag sauce and a drained can of  oregano/basil/garlic canned tomatoes. when meatballs were done, added to sauce and simmered for about an hour.

This recipe really works! I needed a quick meatball for some hungry kids and this did the trick. I made it "as is" except that I didn't use  quite as much bread crumbs. Well done!

This is the first meatball recipe I've ever used. I was excited to try it but it let me down. I used ground turkey instead of beef and didn't use any hot sauce. Changed nothing else. These fell apart completely (too moist i guess), were way too spicy, and just were "ehh..." not terrible but not good. Gonna mess around with the ingredients and try it again. less seasoning and bread crumbs, also leaving out all spicy stuff and maybe Worcestershire sauce.

These were excellent.  I also used minced garlic instead of garlic salt.  I don't think my family took a breath while devouring these meatballs.

Awesome meatballs!  The only thing I changed was the breadcrumbs.  Having gluten sensitive family members, I used glutino brand GF breadcrumbs.  I also wanted to suggest spraying PAM on your pan before adding the meatballs.

a whole onion was way too much. It was really overpowering.  I would suggest maybe a quarter onion and also to put it in a processor so you aren't eating chunks of onion with a little meatball thrown in. The oregano was a little overpowering too. I think next time I may leave it out all together since the bread crumbs and Italian seasoning already have that flavor.

Very tasty!  Heeded advice of some on the saltiness and used minced garlic in place of the garlic salt, and used plain instead of seasoned bread crumbs.  Also subbed 1 egg for the milk.

I made this recipe by the directions, except I used one egg instead of milk.  It came out amazing!  Also, I had 1.5 lbs of meat so I used a heaping of everything.  My husband loved the spice/heat to it!  He wants me to make these at least once a week!  Thanks so much for this amazing recipe!

Love this recipe! Since my stomach cannot handle red pepper flakes, I added about 1 tsp. of fennel seed for an extra flavor kick. It turned out to be an excellent addition. Be sure to mix enough to distribute the seeds throughout.

I have made this recipe verbatum many times, and I LOVED it even though I found the original recipe to be the tiniest bit dry, even with changing meatball size/cooking time/ etc. 

One user suggested substituting ricotta cheese for the skim milk and it makes SUCH a difference! It infuses the meatballs with a delightful cheesy flavor that accents the other cheeses and leaves them much more moist. Please try it! It adds a whole new dimension to an already 5 star recipe!

I'm giving this 5 stars, because my family loved it. However, even omitting the hot sauce and cutting down on the red pepper, it was too spicy for me. So word of caution to those like me: JUST CUT OUT THE RED PEPPER AND HOT SAUCE. It is flavorful enough without them. ;)

I tripled the recipe, because it said the recipe made 12 meatballs. I was like, "Uh, that seems like a small number. I need more than that." Well, I ended up with over 100 3/4-1" meatballs. TIP: Mix this in your Kitchen-Aid mixer! Less messy. Then use a small cookie scoop to scoop them out in uniform balls.

After 25 minutes in the oven (we like them well done), I simmered the meatballs in sauce and served over sub rolls. The rest are going in the freezer. :)

These were great!  I loved the mix of everything and followed the recipe except for two pieces: (1) I used fresh garlic, (2) I used half a small onion.  These were still quite heavy on the onion, so next time I think I'll use a quarter of an onion and mince it into impossibly tiny pieces.

Only used 1/2t red pepper flakes, no hot sauce because I ran out, and I used SOY SAUCE instead of the Worcestershire sauce.  COMPLETE SUCCESS!! MOIST TOO!!!  I baked for 18-20 min using a medium cookie scoop. :)

I've followed this recipe several time.  It's great as written.  I also enjoy doctoring it up with meatloaf mix instead of straight-up beef, replacing grated parm with shredded parm, and mixing up the spices here and there to taste.  The hot sauce and crushed red pepper really help the meatballs stand out on their own when served with a red sauce and pasta.

Love this recipe! Adds so much to basic spaghetti. Make the whole batch, omit spicey ingredients, add half measurement of spicey ingredients to half meat, make large meatballs for adults, mini meatballs for little ones without spiciness. Everyone is happy!

I made a double recipe...doubled everything except cut back slightly on the red pepper flakes.  I love these!!!  They may be a bit salty for my taste, so next time I'll probably cut back the salt.  But maybe they only seem salty since I have been eating them without sauce, pasta or bread.    I will definitely be making these again,   Just the right kick for me.  Thanks!!!

This recipe is AWESOME! I made these as mini meatballs for a girls night in. Only thing I did differently was sear them in a cast iron skillet then let them simmer in sauce, in my crock pot. These were a hit and I will be making them again!

Awfully good -- a robust meatball. I added 1/3 lb. ground italian sausage for an extra layer of flavor. It was a bit too salty, so I would substitute minced garlic for garlic salt. The meatballs had nice heat and were great on a toasted sub roll with homemade marinara and mozzarella!

It's edible and tastes good except the texture was a bit on the dry side. Next time I will use egg in replacement of skim milk and use half ground beef and half ground pork.

Amazing!!  This really is meatball nirvana! The only change I made was to use an egg instead of milk, and leave out the hot sauce.  Sooooo good!  Will definitely make again!

Simply amazing. I made these for a wedding I cooked for for my sister in law (catering was too pricey), and these were the star. People loved them despite the surprising kick. They make great meatball subs to and without sauce they freeze well. Since we don't have kids, I will often make a batch and just freeze the extras.

I can't believe how often we make this recipe. I am in love with reading the reviews too! We have tried so many of the different ways to put these together- My husband loves them so much that he bought me a kitchen aid mixer just for the meatballs! We recently started adding A.I. sauce too. We are so spoiled by this recipe, love you for sharing!

I have tried a Bon Appetit meatball recipe and wasn't satisfied, but this is an amazing recipe.

I followed ItalianTapas review: I split the meat with beef and pork and I added the ricotta cheese.

Will make again and again!

Way too much seasoning, too spicy. If I made this recipe again, I would have to make too many adjustments to say it's even this recipe. No one in my family of 5 enjoyed these.

Excellent! In my version, I used about 1 tsp fresh garlic instead of the garlic salt, about 1/2 tsp cayenne instead of the pepper flakes, a little more hot sauce, and only 1/4 c. bread crumbs. Based on other reviews and the pepper, I was expecting a spicier meatball. Instead the pepper and pepper sauce seemed to brighten the flavor without adding heat. Mine reached done temp. in 20 minutes. Only lightly browned, but since they went into a red sauce, who cares? Really delicious.

These were the best meatballs my mom and I have ever had, they were moist and not dry at all! ( A pleasant change) We used fresh herbs, and swapped the italian seasoning for italian seasoned bread crumbs instead. We also used fresh garlic (gives a stronger/better flavor) and used more parmesan cheese (we're cheese lovers) along with more chili sauce and chili flakes. We followed the suggestions made on the site and stuck to our 2% milk and they turned out just fine along with our usual preference for 85/15  ground beef.

Just finished making these.  Very good recipe and very easy to make.  I only did about 1/2 the red pepper since my toddlers will be eating them too.  Only complaint is they are a bit salty.  Next time I'll skip the salt and just do the worcestershire and cheese.  Those two ingredients add enough salt on their own.

Debated whether or not to give these 5 stars.....my husband and son love the kick that these have.  They are tasty and freeze well.  I think I am going to cook the onions a bit before putting them in with the mix next time.  I will make these again.

Making these for dinner tonight. OMG! NOM NOM NOM!!!! I had to get out of the kitchen before I ate them all. Got them simmering right now in some Newman's Own "Sockarooni" sauce. I substituted the milk for one egg. This will be my meatball recipe forevermore!

The PERFECT meatball... finally!  LOVE the extra kick that the red pepper flakes and Frank's brings.  A little too salty for my taste... I'll reduce the sea salt to "a pinch" next time.  Thank you for this recipe!

Used deer meat because...well...we are hunters. Guess what? FABULOUS! We were worried using deer meat because it sometimes doesn't work for some recipes. However, this was fabulous 100%! Followed recipe exactly...no changes.  First time to ever make meatballs too!

These are awesome cooked in the crock pot!  After trying it the way the recipe stated, I did make these changes:  I did half grass fed ground beef and half Italian Sausage.  I substituted the milk for an egg.  I also used panko Italian seasoned breadcrumbs.  Also, make sure you use real parm cheese - no fake stuff!  I doubled the recipe and made smaller sized balls.  I cooked them on low in the crock pot in 2 jars of sauce, a can of diced tomatoes, and I added a package of mushrooms and a zucchini that were cooked in butter/olive oil and garlic before adding to the sauce mixture.  You will be left with a nice thick meaty sauce and delicious meatballs :)

Very good but i omit the additional oregano. Made it once exactly as the recipe stated and it was way too overwhelming. The spice mixture also makes for great turkey burgers.

Yum!  These were so good.  I made meatball sandwiches out of them and my husband ate what was leftover plain for lunch the next day.  Next time I will double the recipe and freeze the rest.

Cannot believe how moist these are with the lean ground beef!  Loved them - will absolutely make this recipe again!  Only ended up cooking for 15 mins but maybe mine were smaller than they were supposed to be.

When a recipe comes out great the first time it makes me so happy!  I got the highest praise from hubby who said they are better than his.  I guess I did make a few changes now that I think on it.  I used the pork, veal, beef mixture.  I used Italian flavored Panko, Japanese style breadcrumbs, and soaked it in the 1%milk before adding it last to the mixture.  I also used Pecorino Romano cheese instead of Parmesan because I like it the best.  I also followed another raters suggestion and flipped them 1/2 way through baking.  I will be eternally grateful for that tip since frying is bad for you but they never brown right when baked and now they do!

Wow, wow, wow – why did I wait so long to try these meatballs?  This is the BEST meatball I’ve ever eaten.  Even my son, who does not care for meatballs, ate these.  That is a HUGE compliment to the creator – lovestohost!  I made these exactly as ingredient written, but formed smaller meatballs.  We ate part of them and I flash froze the rest of them for another meal.  I didn’t realize how simple meatballs were to make.  No more store bought ones for my family.  The next time I make them, I will use 3#’s of meat so that I can have quite a few meals in the freezer.  Thanks lovestohost for sharing your incredible recipe.  We loved them!

These meatballs packed too much heat, even after I had cut back a bit on the crushed red pepper flakes. I won't be making them again.

These meatballs were highly over-seasoned and had way too much bread crumb.  It took over the taste of the meat completely.  .  I think the additions to the meat could be cut back by half.

Only change I made was to use corn flake crumbs instead of seasoned bread crumbs to keep the recipe gluten free.  This is my new meatball recipe!  The flavor was great and the texture was like velvet in my mouth!  I was surprised how moist they were and very pleased that I was able to keep it healthy by not using an egg and using skim milk.

OMG! Turn down the heat . . . please. The meatball was very good in its quality holding well, even when added to a spaghetti sauce. Unfortunately, with the recommendations for its spices, we found it excessively hot. If you just wish a slight kick, I would cut the red pepper down from 1/2-3/4 of what the recipe calls for; also, make sure your onions are finely chpped or it detracts from the perfection of the meatball.

It is frustrating to me when people rate a recipe (good or bad) but don't follow the directions!!
I prepared this just as written and it is wonderful! I have used the same meatball recipe for 20 years and honestly was skeptical, but the red pepper flakes and hot sauce really jazzed these meatballs up! A big hit all around. Served as suggested with marinara and angel hair. Delicious!

The author of this recipe isn't kidding. This is meatball nirvana. Moist, flavorful, just a little bit of a kick. I didn't have onion, so I used garlic instead, and added a bit more hot sauce (because I like things spicy). These were so fantastic, I didn't even put tomato sauce on them. I will be making these again, and again, and again (after the batch I froze runs out).

These were some pretty tasty meatballs !!  Not wanting the "crunchy" onion as some reviewers mentioned...I sauteed the chopped onion in two Tbls. of butter - used crushed up New York Roasted Garlic Bagel Crisps for the bread crumbs - a few shots of Tapatio for the hot sauce - an egg instead of milk - and up'ed the Parmesan Cheese to 1/2 cup.  So good that I dreamt of a meatball sandwich for the next day...but nope...not one meatball left :(

Loved! I always do three pounds at once so I can freeze a serving. I also always do 1 pound ground turkey with 2 pounds ground beef. So, that is what i did here.  This recipe was great with the addition of the turkey. The seasoning  is great! I only cut back on the salt and red pepper a bit. I used 2 eggs and about a 1/2 - 3/4 cup hot water instead of milk. Ina garden uses hot water and it is truly the best tip for keeping meatballs soft and not hard bricks of meat! Just add enough hot water to really loosen up the mixture so it is soft and mushy. Can't go wrong. Thanks for a great recipe!

I'm going to be honest. I had to change the recipe up A LOT because I have more than 1 family member with a sensitive tummy. I completely omitted the pepper flakes, hot sauce (which I just put on my own meatballs after cooking) and cheese, and I subbed soy milk for the skim milk. Also, I was out of Italian Seasoning, so I subbed Poultry Seasoning (which is basically Italian Seasoning with black pepper and nutmeg). I used 1 tablespoon of the Poultry Seasoning because my bread crumbs were not seasoned which was my bad. Next time I will do as another reviewer suggested and just add more oregano. Still, this recipe yielded the moistest meatballs I have ever eaten. I ate the leftovers last night, and they were still pretty moist ofter being nuked in the microwave. Thank you for sharing, LTH!

WOW! I am making meatballs for my husbands open house and they were so good I could not get the family to stop eating them! I was out of red pepper flakes(and some folks don't like things too hot so I substituted Mrs. Dash's steak seasoning), it was perfect. I used 80/20 ground beef as we are going to be using a chafing dish and I did not want them to dry out.  Thanks so much for the great recipe.

I tried this today and thought it was pretty yummy - I did make a double recipe and instead of 2lb of hamburger, used 1lb hamburger and 1lb of mild sausage as suggested in a previous suggestion.  The meatballs were very very good - but way too spicy for my tastes. The house smells so good now!!  When I make these again, I will avoid the red pepper flakes and use only the dash of hot sauce.  I think I will also add some minced garlic.  However, if you are a fan of hot dishes, then this recipe is perfect as written.  Excellent recipe.  Thanks!  Wendi

My husband made ALL of the food for our daughter's wedding reception of 100 people.  He knew he wanted meatballs due to the versatility, but wanted something differnt.  This recipe was a big hit.  We also used minced garlic rather than garlic salt, omitted the oregano and used Italian seasoning.  The crushed red pepper was a surprise that had people coming back for more.  We vacuum froze the meatballs in meat-flavored jarred sauce and when it was time for the reception, they were great.

These were delicious!  I soaked the bread crumbs (I used panko) in the milk before adding to the beef mixture. I also used garlic powder to cut down on the salt.  So good they really don't need sauce.

These are the best tasting and easiest meatballs I have ever made! I will never use another recipe! Next time I make this recipe, I will make double the recipe in order to have some to freeze. If you have a family of three or more, I would recommend to do the same!

Delish! I used ground turkey and added extra spice, but stayed true for the rest of it.
The taste truly lingers in your mouth - like chocolate or wine will - and just evolves into something amazing. So delish I was sent back into the kitchen to make more! ha!

This is my absolute favorite meatball recipe.  I do add more herbs along with some shredded parmesan cheese and coarsely crushed oyster or Saltine crackers.  The added kick of the red pepper and richness of the worcestershire sauce makes them so good I actually eat them without sauce quite frequently (which I think is the true test of a great meatball).  They are surprisingly easy too.  My son likes spicy dishes but you might want to ease up on the red pepper if your kids don't.

We used Sweet Basil instead of Oregano. Came out tasting really good. I would cook the onions first as they do not have enough time to soften up. We will try this recipe again.

These meatballs are so easy to make! They taste great and my favorite part about them is that they freeze even better. I bake up a big batch of them at once and freeze for quick easy meals during the month. To reheat for a juicy meatball, I throw frozen meatballs into a saucepan with a little bit of water, cover with a lid and let them steam, stirring occasionally and/or adding more water so they don't stick to the bottom. They always come out tasting fresh and juicy!

My husband liked them but I thought they just okay because they were too spicy-hot for my liking & I didn't even use the hot sauce. Also, I think an egg would have helped made them more moiste. Thanks anyways.

The spices were good, but it was too much like a -- as dumb as it sounds -- ball of meat. I'd mix in pork or use just turkey next time. 

TLDR: Good base recipe, but missing something.

Delicious!!! Used with "chunky marinara" (made non chunky with a blender) from this site, put them in the oven for 20 min then let them simmer in the sauce for another 15.... served with Jimmbos garlic knots (sans red pepper since its in meatballs) from this site

So. Freaking. Good.  I doubled this recipe so I could save some meatballs for later.  Only added half of the red pepper flakes and followed the hot sauce amount, and didn't taste any heat (and I'm weak in handling spice).  Also followed other reviewers by subbing the milk with ricotta cheese.  They were moist, flavorful and addictive.  Thanks!

Yummy, I doubled and used 1lb beef, 1/2lb each pork and sweet italian sausage.  Did not mince the onions very well will try to cut them smaller next time. Also will try the ricotta instead of milk that another reviewer suggested.  Froze half for later and they made a GREAT last minute dinner with pasta and sauce.  Thank you!

These were SOOO GOOD!!! My boyfriend told me they were even better than our favorite Italian restaurant's meatballs. I did make a few minor changes, but still stayed true to the recipe's overall taste. I used one egg instead of the skim milk, panko bread crumbs instead of Italian (it's what I had on hand)...since I substituted for panko, I doubled the Italian seasoning. I also added fresh oregano instead of dried (again, it's what I had on hand). When using fresh herbs, I learned that the ratio to fresh to dry is 3:1. So I used about one TABLEspoon of the freshly chopped oregano. (3 tsp yield 1 TBS). I didn't have garlic salt so I doubled the salt, and added 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder. It turned out amazingly delicious!!!! My search for the perfect meatballs is over. :)

I changed/added a few spices here and there to taste, but largely kept the recipe the same...holy , they were delicious!  I combined them with the Tomato Cream Sauce from this site located here:

http://allrecipes.com/recipe/tomato-cream-sauce-for-pasta/detail.aspx?event8=1&prop24=SR_Title&e11=sauce&e8=Quick%20Search&event10=1&e7=Recipe%20Search%20Results

It came out fantastic with that pairing over some linguine.  A house of 5 people found themselves unable to move, they had eaten so much.

Excellent meatball recipe!  LOVED them!!  I doubled the recipe and added a package of onion soup for additional flavor (and so I didn't have to mince onions.)  We made them about 2inches in diameter and baked for about half an hour.  Delicious when added to homemade tomato sauce and placed on top of spaghetti noodles!  Nirvana!!

added green bell pepper and subbed panko for the bread crumbs with a bit of Tony's seasoning.  Delicious.

This is a good recipe. I have made it twice now and I really thought there was too much oregano in it. I will cut it by at least half (if not all of it). What I like most is that you can make this recipe your own with your personal tastes really easily.

These are delicious! I will caution folks- make sure you grease your baking sheet before you put the meatballs on it. The recipe didn't say to grease it, so I  did not and ended up scraping them off the sheet. Other than that, everything worked well. I added minced garlic since we are garlic fanatics at our house. =)

Very good meatball.  Next time I make it, I will omit the oregano it was too overwhelming.  I also took out most of the spicy peppers and sauce because i have young children.

These are really good! I did not have warchestershire sauce though and I did not add any hot pepper sauce. They have a tad bit of spice. I added these to spaghetti sauce and noodles and it turned out wonderful.

My husband did not care for the chunks of onion.  I even sauteed the onions first to make them less evident.  Maybe I should have processed the onion in a food processor first.  He would probably approve minced garlic instead.  My son liked them as is.

These were a huge hit at my house.  Even my extremely picky 6 year old asks for these now. You can adjust some of the ingredients as preferred. I like the bit of the hot sauce and red pepper flakes. I seperate a smaller bowl for my 6 year old without those items and she loves it!

These meatballs have great flavor and are easy to make.  I didn't add the dash of hot pepper sauce and thought they added just enough kick with the red pepper flakes.

These meatballs were delicious! My husband and I loved them. I cooked them in the oven for 15 minutes before adding it to "The Best Marinara Sauce Yet" listed here on the site to finish cooking. The best part was that the meatballs soaked up some extra flavor from the sauce and helped give the sauce an extra kick.

These are really good.  I had most of the ingredients on hand last night, so decided to throw them together.  I was not disappointed!  I followed the recipe exactly as written, and my only complaint that brought it down to 4 stars was the amount of oregano.  I think with it being in the Italian seasoning and then adding another 3/4 teaspoon on top of that, it came across as a bit overpowering to both my husband and me.  But, that's a very easy fix.  :)  This recipe is a keeper, and I will be making it again!

I am sorry, but I think we are some of the very few that don't like this. No one cared a lot for them( except our 8 year old)and I just don't like them at all. Sorry.

These were tasty!  Flavors and texture were fantastic.  The red pepper and hot sauce does add a kick but I wouldn't change it.  I topped with my all time favorite pasta sauce:  "World's Best Pasta Sauce" by JohnChandler http://allrecipes.com/recipe/worlds-best-pasta-sauce/detail.aspx.  It was perfect!

Words of the man of the house, "DEFINITELY make these again!!"
Thanks for this recipe.  I had always ended up with meatballs that were dry and didn't hold together well.. not these! They're so good my hubby did a butt wiggle dance bringing the dishes to the sink..he doesn't dance, so that says something!

These meatballs were just okay -- the final product tasted more like bread crumbs than meat, and the little bit of spice put into the meatballs did nothing to enhance the flavor. I won't be making these again...

Pretty good.  My 5 year old gave it a thumbs up.... But was expecting more flavor.... Could be that I had more meat, but used same recipe exactly.  Will try it again, definitely.

Thank you for this recipe...these meatballs are awesome! Love that they are baked instead of fried. I used ground turkey (what I had) and garlic powder instead of garlic salt because sea salt can be a bit over powering at times. Next time will triple recipe so I can freezed them. Thanks again!!

This is wonderful! I can't believe I can make insanely delicious meatballs right in my own apartment, and I can't believe that it's really simple.  Thanks for broadening my repertoire with this great recipe!

I follow the directions at listed except I never have skim milk so I use my 2%, cut back the worcester sauce to 1 tbs, and can't find a 'small onion' when I go to the market so I use about 1/3 of a the big white onions you tend to find.

Great meatballs; substitute garlic powder for the garlic salt.  The red pepper and hot sauce gives them serious kick - I skipped the hot sauce and just used the red pepper flakes.  Still have a bit of kick, but still not too much for a kid to like.

I make these often in double batches and freeze some to have on hand!  Excellent meatballs.  I always make them as this recipe states but am planning on trying the 1/2 ground beef 1/2 pork and ricotta cheese suggestions one reviewer had some day!  These are also excellent in cream of mushroom soup over egg noodles;)

I'm not a meatball fan at all, but these were pretty good. The rest of the family loved them.

I just love these meatballs!  I only use half of the red pepper flakes and hot sauce to make them a bit more mild.  Usually I make four times the recipe at once...I have a lot of mouths to feed.

These were delicious! I omitted red pepper flakes because I have a 2 year old who doesn't like anything spicy, and they were still fantastic! We will be making these on a regular basis.

My husband said these were good!  That is a rare compliment coming from him.  I made them as indicated, minus the crushed red pepper, as we have tender palates.  I've never put cheese in my meatballs, an the flavor comes out loud and clear. I made one-inch meatballs instead of the large ones, and baked them for just 10 minutes.  Next time I will double the recipe and freeze some for quick fix suppers.  Thanks!

I was so excited to make these based on all of the reviews and the yummy ingredients, but I was a little surprised at the result - they were too salty and too herby (and I love salt and herbs).  Next time I'll try it with less Italian seasoning and less cheese.  Also, I used plain breadcrumbs, and was glad they weren't seasoned!

Made these last night.  They were fantastic.  I may have heaped my chili flakes a little too much for my husband's liking but I thought they were great.  I noticed he ate any remaining meatballs so that crack about them being a little too spicey may not mean much when all is said and done. 

I did not have sea salt so used Kosher.  I didn't have Italian seasoning so I used the recipe on AllRecipes called Italian Seasoning II and left out the oregano since this recipe called for oregano.  I had only plain bread crumbs so I threw in some oregano in them.  

Don't overcook them.  I think I did, but they were still really good.

Okay seriously, where I come from meatballs are cooked all day in sauce or gravy to serve on noodles or rice.  My husband travels a lot though and he wanted a meatball sandwich.  I cannot tell you how abhorrent the idea was to me but I made them.  Oh my goodness, this was the best sandwich I've ever made.  I made small meatballs loaded them up on a hoagie bread, loaded THAT up with mozzarella  and then wrapped it up in aluminum foil and backed it for just a few minutes and it was the best, absolutely the best.  Now I've made about 50 pounds of meatballs and canned them for instant sandwiches wheneven the kids want one.

I am in meatball Nirvana! These were so easy and delicious.  The only change I made was used onion powder versus the diced onion. While I was baking the meatballs I mixed up my tomato sauce and then added them to the sauce and served over spaghetti.  Delicious. I think these meatballs would be good served with a gravy based sauce as well, or Swedish type sauce and served over rice.  very good.  You won't be dissappointed.

These were so easy to make and so good.  My picky 6 year-old loved them!  I didn't have fresh onions so I used granulated onions and reduced the spice since I was cooking for kids.

Eh, just okay.  I don't understand all the rave reviews.  Neither my husband nor my daughters were all that crazy about them.  One daughter ate one and the other ate half of one.  I can't put my finger on what we didn't like about them, but they weren't salty enough for sure.  I followed the recipe as written, only omitting the red pepper.  I'll keep searching.

This one's a keeper!  I made Grandma Maggio's Spaghetti Sauce from this site along with these meatballs.  While I didn't think too much of the sauce (it was just okay), these meatballs stole the show!  I didn't have any Franks RedHot so I used Tabasco.  YUMMMMMMMMY!  Thank you lovestohost for this great addition to Allrecipes!

These are fantastic! Only thing I did differently was to add fresh finely diced white onion to improve the moistness. I formed the meatballs with a 1 Tbsp scoop, baked on a jelly roll pan for 25 minutes, & they were done. I then cooked them another 10 minutes to soften the onion even more (so my kids wouldn't notice them...). WONDERFUL!
I think next time I will add a bit of marinara , or even change it up with BBQ or even buffalo sauce. MAKE THESE! You won't be disappointed.

Couple of changes (not intentionally). I did not have red pepper flakes so I used cayenne pepper instead. I used italian croutons smashed up. Didn't have worcestershire sauce so I used soy. Used pepper and more salt. More meat also because I ended up using about a cup of the croutons. Okay so these were the best freaking meatballs I have ever had. I loved the spiciness! I used them in spicy and zesty spaghetti sauce with motts cheese. Thank you!

These are amazing! I used 1tsp garlic, 1/2tsp dried oregano, 1/2tsp dried parsley, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper since I didn't have any italian seasoning. I used 93/7 ground beef and it's awesome.

Out of this world!  These meatballs lived up to their name!  I am not a big fan of Worcestershire sauce or hot sauce, but I added them anyway to stay true to the recipe and, wow! Delicious! Used an egg instead of the skim milk, but otherwise followed to a T.

Hats off to this recipe! You rock my world ... it's the best meatball recipe I ever tasted. I changed a few in the recipe though. Like the garlic salt ... since I don't have garlic salt when I made this I just mixed 3 parts of salt to 1 part of garlic powder. Then I used table salt instead of the sea salt. I used only 1/4 teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes. And then I also used beaten egg to replace the skim milk. The taste of my finish meatballs was so perfect that everyone in the family is looking forward for another meatball nirvana day. Thanks lovestohost for hosting this recipe =)

This came out really good. Very flavorful and moist. I've always cooked meatballs on a flying pan, but I think baking in the oven works better. I made small changes, but for the most part, I stuck with the original recipe. I added an egg, reduced milk to about 1/4 cup. Also added chopped parsley, because I love parsley in meatballs. I LOVE spicy food, but because of my love for spicy food, I have the tendency to overdo the spice. So, just to test it out, I only added 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper, and did not add any hot sauce. 

Results: I think 3/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper would be OK. Next time, I'm gonna up the spice. Also, as some of the other reviewers have noted, I thought it was a little on the salty side. I think I'm going to add only a little bit of sea salt and 1/2 tsp garlic salt next time around. All in all, great recipe! Thank you!!

I didn't know you could bake meatballs! I'm super happy that I came across this recipe. Now I have a new and healthier way to make meatballs and they were DELICIOUS! I used eggs instead of milk cause that's what I'm used to and it came out great!

First attempt at making homemade meatballs.  My breadcrumbs were expired, so I substituted rolled oats.  I also accidentally added a lot more hot sauce than I meant to, but it didn't hurt them at all.  They turned out spicy and delicious.  The spices kind of reminded me of Italian sausage in a way.  Delicious!

Followed the recipe exactly except, I sauteed the onion until tender before adding.  These meatballs had the family saying, 'wow, what did you do different to the meatballs? They're awesome!'.  My family eats meatballs, many meatballs, and NEVER make comments on the taste.  And I have to agree, they were different in the way that you thought...someone who knows how to make meatballs, made these!  Don't be afraid of leaving out the egg, it turns out perfectly.  The texture is what you expect but better.  Good flavor and tasty.  Every bite is just as good as the one before.  No shortage of salt or seasoning with a good tender, cut with a fork texture.  Try these.  You won't be sorry.

I know this has so many glowing reviews, but our family thought it was just okay. I prefer the recipes from Ina Garten or Giada for meatballs. I thought this lacked some flavor and was a bit dry.

I liked the flavor of this recipe, but found the texture of the meatballs to be a little loose for my taste. I would perhaps use an egg instead of the milk as a binder next time, and reduce the amount of breadcrumbs to 1/4 cup for a denser meatball. I would make them again, though - just tweak it a little. :)

Excellent recipe..I would ad some fennel seed to the recipe.  We made this out of ground deer ground and it was a big hit.  Thank you for a great addition to the table.

All I can say is WOW.  What a great recipe.  I followed it exactly and I wouldn't change a thing.  However, that being said, it is a very robustly flavored meatball recipe.  I like oregano and italian sesasoning, but some palates may prefer to cut back a bit on those spices.  Me?  Its perfect.

This is the 3rd time I have made these and they are phenom!!!! 1 minor adjustment this time, ground Turkey instead of beef (cholesterol intake for me).  They were amazing!! Fiance was so reluctant to try them and he said they were the best batch yet! Great recipe!

Loved it!!! This is the first recipe that got me into cooking, now I am addicted to this site. This was easy to make, and it tasted wonderful! Made some quick noodles, and it was a full meal.
Some personal changes: I substituted Mazzarella cheese for the Parmesan, and left out the pepper and hot sauce.

This is one of the easiest, most flexible recipes out there! My husband was pretty impressed that I was making meatballs on a weeknight and it took no time at all. I didn't add the spicy flavorings since our 9-month old was taking part, but hubby added crushed red pepper on top of his pasta.
Also, since hubby is gluten free I never have breadcrumbs around, but I did have cooked quinao in the fridge, so I added that. Delish!

Im an extremely healthy eater AND Im also trying to become a better cook. This recipe is a new favorite! I used all organic ingredients. Instead of dairy milk I used plain, unsweetened almond milk. I added goat cheese crumbles instead of parmesan. And I used gluten-free oats that I ground up in a coffee grinder with some black pepper and garlic salt in lieu of bread crumbs. OMG! THANK YOU for this recipe! It was even easy enough for me to use and customize.

Just (literally) made these, took them out of the oven and gave one to my husband.  HE LOVES THEM.   I made mine with ground chicken, and a bit smaller than 1 1/2 inches, then baked for 30 minutes.   The only thing I would change would be to saute the onion a bit first cuz it is still a bit "crunchy", my husband says he likes it just as is, but I do like my onions a bit softer in a meatball.   Great recipe, good kick to it with the hot sauce and pepper flakes.

I used 3/4 of a pound of ground beef but otherwise followed the recipe exactly besides using shredded parmesan cheese and the meatballs were amazing. No leftovers which we usually have on pasta nights. I seared them with garlic olive oil and then finished cooking in tomato sauce...so moist and flavorful.

Awesome!!  Just enough spice but not overpowering.  I stuck to the recipe but I used regular crushed garlic, and plain breadcrumbs.  Thanks!

My familiy and friends love this recipe!  I use half ground turkey and half ground beef and the flavor is wonderful.  I tried ground turkey only but did not like it as much as the mixture.

Delicious, moist, super-flavorful meatballs!!  I love that I already had all the ingredients in my kitchen.  I made these with an amazing, simple marinara sauce for my husband and a couple friends, and everyone LOVED it!  This is a new favorite, and I'll definitely be making it again.

We did add an egg to this recipe, a little bit more Italian seasoning since our bread crumbs were plain,  and we skipped the red pepper, BUT WOW these were so great. We made them then put in the crock pot with sauce for several hours before eating them over angel hair pasta. We WILL use this recipe again.

Absolutely delicious.  Instead of milk I added one egg like some of the others suggested.  I also added extra crushed chilies to the mix and it was delicious.  My boyfriend couldn't get enough!

The name of this recipe is SPOT.ON.  These are absolutely DELICIOUS!!  

I did make a few changes and doubled the recipe because I'd bought 2 lbs. of ground beef/pork/veal.  

Since I only had one slice of bread on hand, I tore it up and figured it to be about 1/4 c. when crumbled.  I then supplemented with 3/4 c. oats and added both to the food processor so I wouldn't have big oat flakes in the meatballs.

After emptying the bread crumbs/oats, I added 2 cloves of garlic and the roughly chopped onion to the food processor to get a nice mince.  I sweat that in 2 Tbs. olive oil over medium heat for about 5-7 minutes.  Removed from heat and let cool a few minutes, then mixed in the bread/oats.

From there, I followed the recipe directions for mixing and baking, turning the meatballs half-way through baking.  

I hadn't eaten lunch yet when they came out of the oven and was tempted to stuff myself silly with meatballs!  YUM!  Finally a meatball recipe that reminds me of my Italian grandmother's.  Thanks LTH!

These were very good. I actually may add a little more garlic salt, hot sauce and red pepper next time which is just personal preference. But overall, these were very moist and delicious!  Very good meatballs.

These are the best meatballs ever! I've made them a few times and multiply the recipe by 5x so have plenty to freeze and give away. The red pepper and hot sauce add just the right amount of zing. They are wonderful.

My husband LOVES these meatballs, he works 48 and 72 hour shifts for his job in the military, and I send him to work with these in his food bag every week or so.  I did find that using a whole diced onion had a tendency to make my meatballs TOO moist, causing them to fall apart when I put them in my sauce, so I usually just use onion powder instead.  I also omit the red pepper flakes because of my hubby's sensitive palate but those are the only changes I make.  I myself have never been much of a meatball fan, but after making these I am an official convert.

Yum, Yum, Yum!  Love that these have no sugar or egg in them!  Absolutely delish.  Followed recipe to the letter.  
Wish I would have doubled the recipe now but will make again soon and will double or triple it then for the freezer.

WOW. these are incredible! used others advice and used an egg instead of the milk-- no problems there. also, used 80/20 and they were perfectly moist after cooking. made my own bread crumbs from a toasted baguette and seasoned them with chicken grill seasoning. also, didnt have any italian seasoning so i did about 3/4 t dried basil and about 1/4 t marjoram in addition to the oregano. added about a tsp of sriracha and these came out with a kick! so good... we put these on the rest of the baguettes with some spaghetti sauce and havarti, instant meatball sub. will definitely make these again and again.

oh, also, i had a 1" cookie scoop so i just used that to make these meatballs and only had to cook them for about 8-9 minutes. perfectly moist and tender so make sure you watch them!

Well, I thought, anybody who calls a recipe for anything "NIRVANA" gets my vote AND I will try it! 
DID THAT and NIRVANA IT IS! I rarely make any changes to a recipe the first time out, but I did leave out all the "hot stuff" because my honey has GERD! and should not have anything hot and spicy. He does, but he shouldn't. THIS RECIPE IS A KEEPER! THANKS TO LTH! (Why doesn't anybody ever rate a recipe on this site 5 STAR? This one IS.)

Thank you for the wonderful recipe.  Just made it exactly as written and sampled the meatballs before adding them to my main dish.  The addition of the red pepper flakes was wonderful. I ususally like things spicier, but the amount was perfect in this recipe giving just a hint of the pepper flavor.

I didn't have a lot of the ingredients but it still turned out very good. Mix well as egg substitute will make it really wet. Add extra bread crumb if necessary, I bumped it up to 3/4 cups or cook longer. Also, meatballs will stick to foil so add oil to the bottom or pasta sauce. Only problem with using pasta sauce is the meat will bake out the meat juices but it moistens the meatballs very well!

These Meatballs were good and had a kick. I am glad I tried it. However, I had them with spaghetti and meatballs and they didn't seem italian enough to me.

Excellent...used with Best Marinara Sauce Yet (from this site).   I made two substitutions in this recipe.  I subbed 1/2 C ricotta cheese for the skim milk and instead of 1 pound of beef, I used 1/2 lb of beef and 1/2 lb of ground italian sausage (italian blend).

Classic Italian style meat balls.  I made these with my four year old niece.  They were super easy to prepare.  I served this with Baked Ziti I from this site.  Also great to make ahead and store in the freezer with marinara sauce.  Simply reheat in the oven or stovetop.  First time around, I made them with egg as the binder... 2nd time with milk. Milk was better and less dry.  I also decreased the bread crumbs and increased worchestershire to 2 tbsp.

I made 3 pounds of these back in august and froze them raw. I also used them to make burgers out of [also froze them raw. first froze in layers on a tray with wax paper and then transferred into a ziplock]--they are delicious and so handy for quick meals. When I want to make meatball parm, I cook them in some sauce in a saucepan. Other times, I just put the frozen meat balls whole into a pot of pasta sauce and break up the meatballs as it defrosts for an amazingly yummy meat sauce. Ive also used this meat sauce in lasagna and ziti. My husband LOVES the flavor of these and they come out really moist. My only problem with these is that some of them would crack a little as I cooked them, but the recipe *does* call for baking them, so I can't take stars off for that. I made another batch of these today [but forgot the hot sauce ::sad face::] and will try baking them before cooking them in the sauce and see how it goes.

These meatballs were delicious!  Seriously good.  I made a couple of alterations.  Didn't have parmesan on hand, substituted mozzarrela - perfect.  And I rolled them in extra breadcrumbs before baking - this gave them an extra crunchy coating.

These are the best I've ever made and ever eaten.  The meatballs stay softer while cooking in the oven and when you cut into one you can see strings of cheese- so good!

Oh my word!!  I just made these for our dinner and now wish it wasn't 2 hours away!  I doubled the recipe and added italian sausage as the other 1 pound of meat.  I didn't have hot sauce and frankly, I'm a baby when it comes to spice, but followed the rest of the recipe as stated.  I cooked half and froze the rest for a later dinner.  Thank you so much.  I don't think I'll ever be buying the frozen store bought meatballs ever again!

I have been looking for a great meatball recipe for a long time and finally found it here.  I eye-balled the ingredients (I think I came close to original, but skipped the red pepper and hot sauce-can't tolerate spicey). I coud have eaten them right out of the oven and skipped the rest of meal prep!  Thank you, thank you, thank you!

I made two batches. 1 Beef, 1 Turkey. Both, delicious! The turkey was a wee bit drier than the beef (not too dry, but may be once re-heated). 
I made two "mistakes" when following the recipe. I didn't have grated parm, just shredded parm. Probably didn't make a difference, may have made it better. Also, I accidentally unscrewed the cap on the hotsauce instead of lifting the lid to add a dash to the 2nd batch- whoa! Those were some spicy turkey meatballs! :) The recipe is delicious and a keeper in our house. Thanks, LtH!

These meatballs were amazing!  A big hit with my family; my husband and kids raved about them.  I made one change though; I made them with ground pork instead of beef.  I will definitely be making these again!

these are great!! I was looking for a basic recipe that didn't take forever or call for 'fancy' ingredients.  The only change I made was to use less onion b/c my husband isn't a huge fan of onions.  Oh I also used garlic powder instead of garlic salt b/c I didn't have any garlic salt.  We ate them as meatball subs with store bought marinara sauce and tonight I'm making them again with store bought sauce for spaghetti and meatballs.  Tasty, fairly quick, and delicious!!!

Love this recipe.  I double the recipe, but use 1 lb of ground beef and one pound of mild Italian sausage - and I skip salt. In place of Italian seasoning, I use dried sweet basil.  I use plain bread crumbs; and, if I don't have those, then toast some bead and make my own. I've also used it as a base for meat sauce for spaghetti and lasagna - the latter adds a lot of good flavor. Because the recipe is double, I freeze half after they've cooked. Love this recipe.

This meatball is delicious!
So many recipes and store bought meatballs have a pasty and tough texture.  This recipe yields moist meatballs with a pleasing texture.

An aside, I chose to mince my onion to avoid pieces sticking out of the side.

Kudos to the recipe provider.

I had 1.5 pounds of ground beef to use so I decided to make these meatballs. I am SO glad I tried this recipe!  It is the best ever. I baked them in the oven for about 20 minutes and then put the meatballs in a large straight-sided pan and added 26 oz of Hunts spaghetti sauce and a drizzle of olive oil. Let simmer on low for about 15 minutes covered. Served in a bowl with some of the sauce and a couple of tbsp of Tassos Mediterranean olive salad which I got at Costco. Fabulous meal! 
Put single servings of the leftovers in ziplock baggies, put all of those in a big ziplock and they are in the freezer ready on a moment's notice. This will definitely be my go-to meatball recipe from now on. Thanks so much for posting this!

These were def good, good flavor. I followed recipe exactly but they were sort of dry - do you think an egg would moisten them a bit? I'll try that next time.

Very good! I left out the hot pepper sauce and added a whole cup of bread crumbs. I mixed mine with ground pork as well and added an egg, which I think helps keep the balls together.

These were really yummy. I changed a few thing cause I didn't have the original. I use A1 steak sauce instead of worcester sauce, whole instead of skim, and the hot sauce I used was some sriracha hot chile sauce. Also I didn't have any seasoned bread crumbs so I just crumbled up some bread and seasoned it with some garlic powder and Italian seasoning.

These were pretty delicious and easy as far as meatballs can go!  I used a little mild pork sausage because we had it on hand and also an egg.  Next time I may try them exactly as the recipe says, but otherwise they were pretty delicious as we made them!

I may have over cooked the meatballs a little because they stuck to the pan pretty fiercely, but they were totally delicious after I scraped them off!

Fantastic recipe! Never tried making meatballs before - left it to everyone else... but your recipe made all of us happy! I ended up throwing them in a slow cooker with homemade tomato sauce and they ended up great.  I would have never thought of adding red pepper flakes, but the bite and flavor was great and will be using this recipe again! Thanks!

I loved these meatballs but my husband thought they had too much "heat". Next time I will omit the crushed pepper flakes and go with some black pepper. Also, I didn't have any Italian seasoning so I used dried basil instead. They were moist and flavorful. I can't wait to make them again!

This recipe is awesome.  It is of mild spiciness.  Make it exactly as stated the first time and tweak in future builds.

I personally add a little wheat germ (for health) and use more crushed red pepper than suggested.  Worcestershire sauce is not needed in my opinion.  

I recommend using half beef and half ground turkey if you want a healthier mix.  100% beef is awesome but the 50/50 mix of beef turkey is probably 80-90% as good.  It's a good option if you are looking to make it a little healthier.

I did tinker with garlic once.  Give it a shot but it really does not improve the taste.

I made this recipe with my 3yr old. We used garlic in place of the garlic salt, omitted the red pepper flakes (but kept the hot pepper sauce) and used soy milk and soy Parmesan replacement because of a dairy allergy. They turned out fantastic! Held together nicely and full flavor.

These meatballs were delicious! I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder. I also used 1 egg in place of the milk, as others have suggested. One reviewer said that these were a little dry. In order to avoid that I added 1/4 cup milk to the breadcrumbs and let them soak that up. My meatballs were very moist and so yummy. I also used gruyere cheese instead of parm, but only because I had some to use up. This is going to be my go to meatball recipe! Thanks for sharing!

Very good..we like spicy food, so these were definitely more flavorful than other meatballs I've tried, but certainly not overwhelming! I doubled the recipe, used half pork sausage and half ground beef, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I think more garlic or fresh garlic would be a good addition, but otherwise, the spices are a great mix. We ate them open-faced on hamburger buns with my own spaghetti sauce recipe. We had most of them leftover for the freezer, which is a great thing!

I substituted an egg for the milk and loved 'em! Lots of flavour and not too much heat. I used a red onion, that added some extra zip, too. Thanks!

These turned out awesome.  I didn't have any bread crumbs so I just threw in an old hotdog bun and lays potato chips in the Ninja and it worked perfectly.  Thanks so much for this recipe.

This will become my got to recipe for meatballs! They were so flavorful. I'm so glad that I risked it and made a double batch. I'll be freezing one batch for a weekday meal. I had to omit the pepper flakes and hot sauce for the kids, but I can't wait to try these when it's just a meal for the hubby's and I.

my husband really enjoyed these, as there's a ton of flavor. i exchanged the milk for riccotta (as someone suggested), and that made them much lighter! the kids thought they were too spicy, so next time i'll try less or no red pepper. definately a good recipe though!

The best meatball I've tried in a long time! Thank you for the recipe! If you don't like it too spice, reduce the amunt of red pepper to your taste.

I made these last night since my kids asked for meatballs for dinner.  I didn't have time to read the reviews so I followed the recipe exactly and here is what I found out.  You don't need the 1/2 teaspoon sea salt it calls for, the garlic salt, Worcestershire sauce and Parmesan cheese provide plenty of salt on their own (and I believe the bread crumbs have some as well) and instead of dicing the onion, I will be grating it next time.  The cooking time in my oven was around 20 minutes, any longer would have made the meatballs overcooked.  Also, if you are making these for small kids, you might want to omit hot pepper sauce or crushed red peppers or both.  I used both and my kids were fine.

SOOO delicious! I've made with ground beef and received rave review. Had a friend over who doesn't eat red meat, so I swapped it for ground turkey, and I like it even more, and he loved it too. Like another reviewer, I take the easy route and use onion powder (or flakes). I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt since the sea salt is more than enough (as well as salt in the spaghetti sauce). Highly recommended.

I make this at least 2x a month, sometimes doubling it. It's a real husband pleaser! We mostly use these for meatball subs, and they are even good left over for lunches the next day. Not to mention they are quick. By the way, the recipe is perfect as is, no tweaks needed.

These are seriously the best meatballs I've ever made. My guests raved over them and I am sure they will become a household staple. I had a pound and a half of ground beef so I just doubled everything and used 2 eggs instead of the milk and added minced garlic instead of garlic salt. These are absolutely incredible.

Just made these meatballs for dinner, and WOW they were so flavorful.  I didn't have worcestershire sauce, so I used A-1 steak sauce instead....yumm. Also,next time I make these I will definitely mince the onions a bit finer or maybe grate them with a hand grater, as I didn't care for the larger sizes I had left the pieces in.  Other than that, this is a fantastic recipe that I will definitely make over and over again and try with turkey and pork as well!!

Really delicious! Next time I'm going to do half ground meat and half pork- that will take it to 5 stars!
I also added fresh garlic and skipped the garlic salt.

AWESOME!!!!!!
I made these EXACTLY as the recipe said & my family absolutely LOVED THEM!!!  

I've made them several times since my first try & I will say that varying from the recipe did NOT produce the same results :(  Leaving out the Parm cheese is NOT a good idea.... the meatballs seem to be wetter & just not the same flavor.

I love this recipe & will use it over & over & over!!!

Now that's a spicy meataball!!  Made these tonight and the entire family including the girlfriend loved them, side note I'm not Italian and she is along with her home cooking mother.  I made 3 times the amount and it was perfect, the only difference being whole milk.  I had not made meatballs at home in years and always just winged it off of memory from my teenage pizzeria chef years and these blew those away hands down!! Gratzi!

Made the recipe with 1lb ground beef and 1lb ground veal, 1 egg instead of the milk and upped the italian seasoning b/c my bread crumbs were plain. Hubby liked it, Made some mini for my daughter too. good recipe that can be played around with

Nirvana is a great description of this dish.  I'm not much for measuring so I just estimated the amount of each spice and it turned out amazing!  I love this recipe!

AH-mazing. First time making meatballs and I am glad I used this recipe! I used turkey instead of beef and I upped the herbs (I like using a lot of spice), used dehydrated onion, and added more spice (I like heat too!). I also had no bread crumbs so I crushed up some crackers and croutons - worked fine. Totally great - moist and filling. I served over some penne pasta and froze the rest. Will make again!

(BASED ON 6 SERVINGS) I thought it would be too much onion, it wasn't. I only used 1/4 tsp. of the red pepper flakes and I wish I would have used more. I could barely taste the spice. HOWEVER, this was my first time ever making meatballs without eggs, and I was surprised how moist they turned out. I didn't have seasoned bread crumbs so I used 1/4 + 1/8 cup italian seasoned bread crumbs and 1/4 + 1/8 cup plain bread crumbs. The meatballs were really, really, good. I will definitely use this as my meatball staple from now on. Thanks for the recipe! :0

Thank you for this recipe!  I have yet to try it with the hots because my family members don't food with heat, but will when I make them just for me.  I also use fresh garlic in the recipe.  Last night I did 1/2 ground beef, 1/2 ground pork and the were the juiciest meatballs ever!

*****  I just had to post a review.  These meatballs were absolutely delicious.  I normally use eggs in my meatballs and thought it was a little strange to just use milk, but I made them as written.  They were so moist, tender, and flavorful and the consistency was perfect.  I cut down on the red pepper flakes and my family and I thought there was still a little too much of a kick so that is the only change I will make.  I will be making these for many years to come.  All 3 of my kids, even my picky 6 year old LOVED them.  Thank you for posting it.

Delish!  I loved these!  I tried them right after they came out of the oven to make sure they were cooked through.  I was surprised by the spicy kick I got!  It isn't overpowering, but just enough to give you that flavor.  Definitely a keeper!

Yum!
These are fabulous! I used 1 lb turkey and 3 lbs beef to make a 4x batch. On the advice of other reviewers, I used real garlic and ice cream scoops for quick measuring.
We just ate big ones with pasta and I have smaller ones cooking up for sandwiches this week.

These are delicious!  I make them with a little less oregano than called for.  This recipe has become a staple in our house.  I serve them on garlicky sandwich rolls with marinara sauce.

Added real garlic and used half ground pork along with ricotta cheese, then put some cayenne in there to kick it up a notch. Excellent...

These meatballs are so good, they are all I could talk about for days.  I went a little lighter on the red pepper flakes and a little less on the bread crumbs, other than that, followed the recipte.  Everyone loved them.  So good, I had them for dessert too!!

We thought these were really good if all you have in the house is burger. I think they would be even better using the meatloaf mix blend of pork, veal etc. But if what you want to use just beef then you will be happy with these. Eyeball the amount of red pepper flakes if you are sensitive to spice and adjust to your liking. Thanks for the recipe! Oh, and I added a little minced garlic too (personal preference).

Tasty! These were a bit spicy, even without the hot sauce. I made them earlier in the day, refrigerated and baked right before dinner. I think sitting longer made the red pepper flakes spice things up more.

Try with bison! Quadrupled recipe for meatball throw-down.  Used 1 lb bison, 2 lb ground beef and 1 lb ground pork. Followed recipe, but made a few changes...  4 onions was too much, put in 2.5 onions, reduced milk to 2/3 cup, added 1 cup ricotta, added 2eggs,  reduced bread crumbs in half. Reduced grated parmesan in half, but added 1 cup of a 3-cheese shredded mix (asiago, pram, romano). Added 10 cloves of crushed garlic!  6 tablespoons of fresh basil. It was amazing. Given amount of ingredients, its important to mix evenly, one at a time. It look me a half hour to mix it all

I don’t care for ground beef so I made these for my husband.  He thought they were delicious and moist and deserved five stars.  My daughter had some of the leftovers the next day and loved them.  Her exact words were “these are awesome.”  She took the remainder for lunch for the following day and asked me to make more.

These were okay.  My father, who loves meatballs, only had a couple of these.  They did not hold together well, didn't have a great consistency (it was too chunky), and didn't have all that great of a taste.  I won't try making these again.

These meatballs were AWESOME! I was hesitant because of some of the ingredients, but made them EXACTLY as posted and served them with a garlic, Parmesan spaghetti  side dish on this site and topped the meatballs with spaghetti sauce. Delicious!

Fantastic!!No other words for these meatballs. Only made changes as a result of personal preferences.  Omitted hot sauce, used veal instead of beef, real garlic in lieu of garlic salt and no salt. I must say I generally use all of these same ingredients but in different quantities. Quanity is key. Use your measuring spoons. This is what makes this such a fantastic recipe. Smells wonderful, tastes even better. Never knew I could use milk as a binder instead of an egg. I make these as meatballs and hamburgers.

This is my go to meatball recipe for over a year now.  Perfect just as the recipe is written.  I make a huge batch and freeze them, it makes dinner easy...thaw in the microwave and add sauce.  Everyone loves my meatballs!!  
Try this recipe you will not be disappointed.

Fantastic!  I don't usually like meatballs, but these were very flavorful.  I didn't have any onion or Italian seasoning so I improvised.  Otherwise I made as the recipe states.  Really good, and a keeper.

I more than quadrupled this recipe (5x), added 1 head of crushed garlic in addition to 1 t. of garlic salt called for.  I also used eggs instead of the milk, which worked well.  Cutting that many onions was time consuming so I rough-chopped them along with the garlic and threw them in our food processor.  The resulting consistency helped blend the flavor better and made a great binding agent for the meat balls.  Several hours of rolling, packing and freezing yielded 243 meatballs!

This recipe was great...I made it for my dinner party last night and everyone raved about how great the meatballs were. 
I modified the recipe alittle, I didn't add the spicy hot ingredients and no breadcrumbs which was by accident. I added an egg - 1 cup of parm/romano cheese. The beef i used was the veal,sirloin,pork variety pack and I added 1/3 extra onion. It was really great!

I followed this recipe exactly except I used 93/7 ground turkey because of the lower fat content and I also did not add any garlic salt or any salt as there is enough in the grated cheese and wrochestershire sauce and the seasoned bread crumbs.  I divided the finished product into 4 equal portions, froze the other 3 turkey burgers individually and had this wonderful spicy, tender turkey burger that I will be making from now on!  If anyone is interested, it comes out to 7 Points Plus on the Weight Watcher program.  Definitely a keeper.  Over the top delicious!!!!!

Delicious!  I have been looking for a great homemade meatball recipe to mimic those tasty ones found in restaurants.  This one was great!  I omitted onion due to personal preference and both myself & boyfriend enjoyed these with spaghetti.  Will make again!

I have always had a strange problem making meatballs .  They are always flavorless and fall apart....so much so that I stopped making them.  I gave this recipe a whirl and woo-hoo, my husband called these the best meatballs that I have ever made!!!  I doubled the recipe and used half lean ground beef and half ground turkey.  I subbed 2 eggs for the milk and yum, yum, yum!!  they made awesome meatball subs one night and then spagetti and meatballs the next!!!  Thank you LTH for this keeper meatball recipe!!!!!

I omitted the salt, replaced the garlic salt with garlic powder, added 1 tbsp fresh minced garlic, used half the red pepper flakes and omitted the hot sauce, my son doesn't like spicy, simmered them in marinara sauce and made meatball subs with them, a big hit with my family!
* note to self 3lbs ground beef made 51 meatballs with #50 scoop, baked 20 minutes

I have made meatballs b4 but this is very good,recently saw a tv show on pbs 2 add bread to recipe,but forgot how to do it so i searched and found these very similiar,didnt have red pepper flakes so i added cajun spice and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and used kosher salt.  I didnt have bread crumbs either so i added a piece of bread and about 5 saltine crackers for the consistency of bread crumbs, these were very moist and good aroma iz amazing.

Forgot the Worcestershire Sauce... substituted the Parmesan cheese for Mozzarella and they were still awesome. My roommates (all males) tell me this recipe is a keeper. If you're thinking about making it and can't decide, I would try it... totally worth it. And it's a super easy recipe.

Starting this out at 5 stars because they're still in the oven and smell awesome!  It was a last-minute dinner decision and I've had to improvise seeing as my grocery store is closed today! - I used packets of Taco Bell hot sauce in lieu of Frank's. - I used minced onion instead of fresh. - Hoping that cooking them on a thin wire rack over a catch pan will work - was trying to reduce fat since I only had lean chuck on hand.  Seems to be..a good amount of grease in the pan. - Turned them over after 3/4 of the cooking time. RESULT:  Awesome!!!!

I made a couple of changes. I cut both the garlic salt and the salt in half. I also added 1 tb of minced garlic. The meatballs didn't hold together very well. The mix was a bit more watery than other meatballs I've made, I think next time I'd use an egg in place of the milk. As for flavor, I think they were a little more "herb-y" tasting than I'd prefer, and I'd probably go easy on the Italian seasoning next time too. Overall, an ok recipe.

I used these with my grape jelly, chili sauce cocktail meatball recipe. Think they have a little too much of the "rosemary" flavor to go with the sauce. I think that they would be really good in spaghetti sauce tho. I will definitely try them again in a tomato based sauce.

These were good. The only problem I had was that I seemed to put too much onion. It says one "small" onion and apparently my onion was not small enough. Other than that, very tasty.

These were awesome!  I made so many modifications based on what was available at home and they still were great.  I used 80/20 ground turkey and panko bread crumbs.  These might be my favorite meatballs!  I froze a few of them before they were cooked, which was quite easy to do.  I had meatballs and speghetti one night and meatball sandwhiches the next.  And I've yet to have my frozen meatballs.

They definately have more of a taste than traditional meatbals...almost taste a little like sausage.  After tasting one right out of the oven, I immediately decided to cover them with a very plain sauce to hopefully reduce the strong oregano and Worcestershire sauce flavor.  I have my fingers crossed hoping my family likes them.  I think that they will make my husband's head sweat!  :)

I think that there is way too much Italian seasoning and oregano...otherwise, the recipe is good. I'll make it again, but this time I'll leave out the oregano and 1/2 the Italian seasoning.

Perfect meatballs!  I doubled the recipe using half extra lean ground beef and half ground turkey to make a big batch for freezing.  Freezes very well, just drop frozen meatballs in some red sauce to heat up and serve with pasta.  Will certainly make again!

Pretty tasty.  Mine came out overly salty and I'm not sure why because I measured all the spices.

AMAZING!!!  These were so yummy.  They would be great to serve as appetizers for a dinner party.  They also freeze really well. I did substitute ground turkey for the ground beef.

These were great! Omitted the cheese in the meatballs since i top off the pasta with it I figured it didn't need to be in there.  Didn't add Italian seasoning. but put in fresh sage, basil and oregano.  YUM!

Ok...so I bet I will get slack for this one...but here it goes....I used extra lean GROUND TURKEY instead of beef!!!  I know, I know...not the same....BUT....these were amazing meatballs!!!  Loved the flavors and the heat. Served with whole wheat spaghetti and Marinara Sauce from this site. Will definately make again. Also loved that they were baked not fried. Will try with the ground beef at some point. Thanks LTH!!

Awesome! I just last minute needed an easy meatball recipe. Didn't have an onion so I just used minced onion. No hot sauce either but they were still phenominal! Will make these again and again!

Great recipe, although a bit dry because I did not use them in a sauce. I also used half the amount of onion called for along with gluten free oats instead of bread crumbs. A total keeper. Thank you for the recipe lovestohost!!

I've never been overly crazy about meatballs, but wanted to do something a little extra than just spaghetti, these are really good. I like the spiciness to them and the ease as well. I cut out the salt all together, since there is a lot of salt in the bread crumbs and garlic salt. I also made them a little smaller about 1 inch in diameter and cooked them for 15 minutes and they turned out perfectly.

These were amazing!!  I used turkey instead to cut fat and calories and then just eyeballed the ingredients (I left out pepper flakes and hot sauce).  I served with marinara sauce and whole wheat spaghetti...my family told me it was so good that I could serve this to company.  Made an extra batch to freeze, these are delicious!

My wife has a wonderful spaghetti recipe and we have been searching for a Meatball one to go with it. Found it with the Meatball Nirvana. Thank you for sharing it, it is outstanding. We loved the kick that the hot sause gave and will prob add a bit more the next time that we make it.

These were good but I cut the amount of red pepper in half and left the hot sauce out completely and it was still a little too hot.  I think other than that, they were really good.  I wouldn't go as far as to say the best because I have had better.

I usually make turkey meatballs, but I thought I would give these a try. Wow! yummy! They turned out super moist and flavorful. I got side tracked and forgot to add the onions and they were still delicious. I didn't have seasoned bread crumbs on hand, so I added some additional salt, pepper, and italian seasoning. I baked them for approximately 12 minutes and finished them in a pan with some sauce. I will be making these again. Thanks for the recipe!

These are fantastic! I loved the spiciness of them. The only change I made was to use minced garlic instead of garlic salt and the size of my meatballs might have been a little smaller than 1.5 inches.

These are great meatballs and make a delicious sub.  I've made them with and without the oregano, and I think they taste better without the oregano.

Ok, yum! Way to go LTH! I made a triple batch tonight so hubby could have meatball subs for dinner tomorrow night and I could freeze a bunch. I made them fairly small and it made 52 meatballs. I cooked them for a little less time to adjust for size as well. I just sampled one and yum! I realized, however, that I completely forgot the onion :(. So I'm sure they should be even better...but that's what I get for rushing through them after a long day. Still full of flavor with a nice kick though. Thanks for sharing- I'm so glad I finally tried these!

This is a fantastic recipe! My husband is SO picky when it comse to meatballs. I thought he wouldn't like these since they were just beef. Lets put it this way. I made two pounds worth and I ate 4 and my father in law ate 4. My husband ate the rest! I didn't even get to freeze any! The spices are perfect. If you like really spicy you should add more kick, but we like spice and I wouldn't add more.

I was up against my mother in law's meatballs that my husband loves so. He absolutely loved these. I definitely was able to compete. Thank you for the delicious recipe. I served it with a creamy tomato sauce over fettucini and it was amazing! I didn't make one change to the recipe, which is rare for me. It all worked out perfectly! :)

This was a quick and easy recipe.  I followed it to some extent.  I was making it for my toddlers so didnt put in any pepper flakes.  I didnt have any sea salt, garlic salt, italian seasoning, skim milk or reg. breadcrumbs.  I substituted all of it with reg. salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste.  Used Italian bread crumbs, and reg. whole milk.  Still came out delish and very moist.  I added the meatballs to my sauce and let it simmer for 30 mins.  My family destroyed it!!!

I diced he onion very small, as someone else suggested, and omitted the pepper flakes, added minced garlic instead of garlic salt. Did add 2 dashes of hot sauce. Next time I will combine the milk and breadcrumbs before adding to meat, as I thought the crumbs imparted a bit of a grainy texture. Used 1/2 turkey and 1/2 beef. All in all, would make again.

Simply the best! I've tried many meatball recipes with varied success, but this one turns out perfect every time! The only thing I really change is fresh garlic for the garlic salt and I tone down the spice a tad. They are perfection!

These meatballs were wonderful for dinner tonight. These had a great taste, and were slightly on the spicy side. I think all of the spices meld together very well, and compliment the meat, but don't overpower it. The only thing that I changed was I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt...I thought I had some in the cabinet but couldn't find it. Oh well, you know how it goes. :o) Thanks you so much for sharing this recipe, Lovestohost! I will definitely make again.

These were pretty good.  Not as moist as I like but probably because they were baked and not browned in the pan.  But perhaps healthier this way (?)  I do like the little bit of hotness, but not sure that the kids did.

Yum!  I used a little over 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes because I was afraid they would be too spicy, next time I'll definitely use more because they weren't spicy at all.  I used lean ground turkey because that's what I had on hand and although the texture was different from regular ground beef meatballs, the flavor was outstanding.  After 20 minutes in the oven, I topped them with "Bar-B-Que Sauce" from this site, covered the dish with tin foil, and baked another 15 minutes.  I should have doubled the sauce so there would be some to use as gravy on my mashed potatoes but all in all this was a great combination!  I will be making this again and will double or triple the recipe so I can freeze some.  Thanks LTH!

The meatballs taste much better when broiled.   Broil 5 minutes, flip them with a fork and spoon and then broil another 5 minutes. I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and added 1tsp ground black pepper. I also used 1 egg and 1/4c skim milk

Pretty good meatballs! I used turkey, so the only minor problems I had may have been because of that - the meatballs stuck to the foil a bit, and also fell apart a little too much.  But the taste was excellent - nice and spicy! And I was glad that this was a meatball recipe that didn't require eggs, since we were all out.

Excellent meatball.  I forgot to add the diced onion in the rush to get them in the oven but they weren't lacking without it.  Very tender & light.  Not like some of the dense & dry ones I've had in the past.  Will be awesome on a sandwich for lunch tomorrow.  Thanks for sharing.

I love this recipe! I didn't follow it completely and it still turned out delicious. I didn't use extra lean meat, I skipped the hot pepper sauce and flakes, and I replaced the milk with 3 eggs.

I was in a pinch and didn't have my usual meatball mixture of pork, veal and beef in the freezer, only ground beef.  I found this recipe and thought I would take a change.  I made it exactly as printed as I didn't have time to play around and it was delicious!  I think the red pepper flakes and hot pepper sauce is what really made them pop, along with the other spices.  I also didn't have time to bake them so I just popped them in my homemade spagetti sauce and as well they turned out delicious.  I had some left over to freeze for another meal and can't wait to eat them again

These meatballs were nothing special.  I followed the recipe exactly except for adding the spicy ingredients.  They held together well, but were very dry.  I was disappointed in the result after the rave reviews.

Love this recipe!  I've made it several times and these make awesome meatball subs!  Very easy to throw together and bake off.  I usually just sub some onion powder for the onion the recipe calls for because it's easier.  Next time, I think I'll double the recipe to have some on hand in the freezer.  Thanks!

I guess I'm one of the few who wasn't too crazy about these - - - they weren't bad, by any means ... just to soft for my tough tastebuds I guess.  I prefer a more *meaty* texture, but if you like soft creamy meatballs, this is the one.  Many thanks.

Pretty good. Served w/ pasta & marinara. They have some heat, so of course my kids did not enjoy them. Next time I will leave out the red pepper flakes and add a touch of soy and brown sugar.

I doubled the recipe because I knew LTH wouldn't steer me wrong and offer up a bad recipe.  Good and tasty.  I left out the hot sauce and didn't double the red pepper flakes. I'm glad I didn't.  Next time, I'll probably leave them out altogether.  A little more kick then I like to have.  :O)

An absolute worthy meatballs! Mixing the ground beef with sweet italian sausage makes a difference says my 7 yr old daughter. I only omitted the spiceness for her and followed everything else.

UPDATE: MADE THESE AGAIN TONIGHT (BOY, IT'S BEEN A LOOONG TIME!) AND THEY WERE SIMPLY A-W-E-S-O-M-E!!! THESE ARE EVEN GREAT ON THEIR OWN ALTHOUGH I'D NEVER DO THAT (MB'S WITHOUT SAUCE JUST SEEMS UNORTHODOX TO ME...). I THINK THE KEY IS USING A GOOD HOT SAUCE (I.E. FRANK'S) AND SEVERAL GOOD DASHES OF IT. THESE WERE OUT OF THE OVEN IN 20 MINUTES AND OUR MB SUBS WERE ASSEMBLED IN UNDER 5 (YIPPIE!!!). THANKS AGAIN, LTH! :) Hooray for Italian night - spaghetti, meatballs and homemade garlic bread (Mmmmm...)!!! I've been searching high and low for a good meatball recipe, and these just might be it. Prep was SO easy, I'd do a repeat on that basis alone! And, using my Pampered Chef 3 T scoop made forming even-sized meatballs purely effortless. TIP: If you lightly spray each meatball with Pam cooking spray, they will crisp up nicely in the oven (if you like your MB's browned with a slightly crispy exterior). I have also found that placing your meatballs on a rack INSIDE a roasting pan will help keep the grease at bay. All in all, these were good, but I'm not convinced these are the "end all be all" MB's (at least not for me). If you're looking for the perfect meatball for sub sandwiches, these are definitely it tho - these babies are firm (not mushy) and hold their shape really well. Thanks for sharing, LTH. These seem to be the BOMB on here! :-)

These meatballs are okay, but they have too much Italian seasoning in them, which makes them quite musty tasting. I probably would up the garlic (include fresh) and reduce the Italian seasoning, possibly subbing with fresh herbs. For people who like silky meatballs, this is great, but I like to have more meaty texture, which I found lacking. For this reason, I might decrease the amount of breadcrumbs and liquid just a bit.

So yummy! even my picky 3 year old loved these.  I added garlic to my meat balls but other than that the recipe was great. Next time I think I'll add a little more hot sauce and cook them for 20 instead of 25 mins.

I made these beauties a few weeks ago but quadrupled the recipe and froze in bags of 12 each. My husband and I really liked them but better yet I gave a bag each to my always starving college student grandsons to take back to their lairs and heat up. They raved about how great they were! You've got a winner here, LTH !! Thank you! Will make again and again.

I give this recipe 4 stars only because I made two versions of it. I made half a batch following the recipe to a tee and another batch with 1/2lb ground beef and 1/2 lb Italian Sausage. The one with the sausage was excellent and 5 stars! I would also suggest rotating the meatball half way through the cook time, this way it does not get overly browned on one side. Next time I might saute the onion to give it a richer taste. Overall it was a great recipe!

Wow! Delicious with just the right amount of spice. These were so simple to make and packed with great flavor. My family loves spicy recipes, including my little ones.  The recipe is very versatile you can make it more or less spicy/garlicy depending on your preference. Thanks for sharing.

This is really good. It wasn't greasy or mushy. It was very firm and didn't crumble in spaghetti.

My first time making this and I decided to triple the batch! I made some changes though... Was out of Italian seasoning but had the individual components of it so I worked out the mix, reduced the chili flakes by a quarter and used eggs instead of milk. We froze them after rolling, but cooked up a few to taste. Very moist! They do need some black pepper though, sorry LTH :P EDIT: I tried these again and they were much better, though without the hot stuffs- Still tweaking to meet our flavour profile, but a very good meat ball that can hold up to sauce, pasta and sandwiches.

These meatballs were DELICIOUS!!!!!! My husband said they made him want to punch somebody's mama! (that's a good thing :) We used ground turkey instead of beef, but I would imagine they're just as delectable either way!  We made garlic bread subs by melting butter and grating garlic into a skillet and then brushing it onto the inside of french rolls and sticking them under the broiler for a minute or two.  Put a couple meatballs inside, and poured homemade spaghetti sauce on top - YUMMY!!! :) Thanks LTH!!  These were awesome :)

I've been meaning to try these for a while now and finally did last night. These were really good and flavorful! The only changes I made were that I used ground turkey instead of beef, I used onion powder instead of fresh just out of pure laziness, and I omitted the spicy ingredients because I'm a wimp. Made myself a meatball sandwich and my boys had spaghetti and meatballs...yum!

This was a great recipe but the onions really need to be sauteed before adding them. They were still a little crunchy and kept falling out while I was rolling the meatballs. So saute the onions and it's a five star for me. Taste was great! We used them for meatball subs. This ones a keeper with that small change

These were good but VERY spicy. I even omitted the hot sauce and they were still much too spicy to serve to my kiddos. Very good flavor for adults, but if you're thinking of serving them to little ones, I would either halve or omit the red pepper altogether.

Very good and very easy to make. Hubby cut up his meatballs and ate them in a sandwich and I had them over pasta. I might add a little more Frank's Red Hot next time to give them some more kick.

I have been looking for a meatball recipe that didn't taste like just lumps of ground beef.  This recipe is delicious.  I followed the recipe exact except for using half ground beef half pork, and I used dried minced onions in place of a whole onion.  These meatballs were extremely flavorful.  The only thing I changed was the cook time.  Mine had to cook a lot longer than the recipe states.

I normally do not like meatballs but these really were good. I put some sweet thai chilly dipping sauce on the side which complimented the hot sauce in the meatballs well.

SO GOOD!  I made these last night, and talk about the best meatball subs ever.  The only thing I did differently was to grate the onions rather than dice them since my husband doesn't like chunks of onions.  But that doesn't even count as a change to the recipe ... no alternations necessary as far as I'm concerned!

Great!! Love them. Next time I might reduce the oregano.  I think the Italian seasoning and seasoned bread crumbs are enough herbs, but I still loved them.

Substituted ground turkey for the lean ground meat, and followed recipe exactly, with the exception of the crushed red pepper flakes (non in pantry).  Think this is definitely my new meatball recipe.  Nice taste and the meatballs held together well ~ very  nice texture to them.  Thanks~

Very good meatball recipe. I love the "spice" of them! Only complaint is they stuck to my non-stick baking pan! Next time I'll bake on parchment. Then they'll be perfect!

This definitely deserves 5 stars!  We both enjoyed this tremendously.  I used ground turkey and soy milk instead and it was truly wonderful.  Served it with homemade marinara and it was a hit!  Thanks so much ... I love finding great recipes!

I thought these meatballs had a great taste. Like one of the previous posters I had let myself run out of breadcrumbs. So I ran a few pieces of bread through the food processor. I toasted these in a pan with 2 tbsp melted butter. While the bread crumbs were toasting I added the seasonings I wanted. I allowed these to cool and added to the meat.

YUM!  The very best meatballs I've ever made, by a long shot.  So much flavor!  My partner & I eat a fair amount of ethnic food, so we're used to lots of flavor, & a lot of meatball/meatloaf recipes end up rather bland.  Not this one.. it was SO delicious, we both loved it!  Only made 1 change, since I realized at the last second I only had 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs on hand.  So I crushed a few saltine crackers to add to the mix, & it worked fine.   I foresee myself making this regularly, & in double batches for freezing some (instant comfort food on a busy night?  ok!!). Thank you so much for this recipe... Nirvana indeed!

Very good!  I slightly overcooked my meatballs though. I would take them out closer to 18-20 minutes, and definitely not 25. I also used ground turkey and doubled the spices to counteract the blandness of turkey. I kept crushed pepper the same amount for my son (who still detected the kick!) I liked baking them, easy and healthy.

Thanks you have found the perfect meatball recipe.  Made is with Best Marinara Sauce (on this site) - perfect.  Have used in sandwiches and tried both with spaghetti.  Freeze great.

I made these yesterday and the only change was that I also used some ground pork in addition to the ground beef.  Once cooked, I refrigerated them.  Today, I placed them in a crock pot with 2 jars of tomatoe sauce and heated everything for a few hours.  Served them with spaghetti - delicious.  Will make these again!

fantastic! I used 1 pound ground turkey and the spice was enough to cover the texture issue you sometimes get with ground turkey.  The whole family love them.

I have tried numerous recipes to find my perfect meatball. I can stop looking. These were very flavorful and moist. Next time I will mince the onions instead of just finely chopping them since my son doesn't care to see them in anything he eats. Didn't bother me at all. These meatballs were yumm.

I made these to go in spagetti, I left out the parmesean cheese because I didn't have any and used only 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes and left out the red hot. They were perfect.

We really enjoyed these!  Next time I will add less hot sauce and red pepper as my son complained they were too spicy.  Thanks LTH!

Made these again replacing with Johnsonville sausage instead of ground beef.  I did cut back on some of the seasonings. We still enjoyed them but prefer the ground beef version.

Killer good! I really loved the addition of the worcestershire sauce in these. I did reduce the amount of crushed pepper flakes due to the little guy, but followed the recipe exactly otherwise. I will definately be using this recipe from now on! thanks, LTH! :)

These were spectacular! I really liked the kick in them - although I did cut back on the heat a little.  I will try to always have some of these in my freezer!  I used them for meatball subs and then froze some and used them for a weeknight meal of spaghetti and meatballs.  Aptly named, thanks Lovestohost!

Awesome!! 11 month old LOVED these, with and without sauce! Me and hubby had meatball subs and kids had penne with meatballs. Next time i will double or triple (leftovers!!) Not too much spice for kids - i could´ve used more but definitely good.

These meatballs are delicious!  I had to take a sandwich to a major school function, and I chose to make these to fit into small little Honey Wheat Sandwich Rolls from this site.  The meatballs fit perfectly into my little rolls, and I added a little mayo and Sweet Baby Ray's.  Everyone loved them!  I made the meatballs as written except cut back a little on the onion and crushed red pepper.  I'm glad I made a triple batch of these meatballs because they were excellent!  I can't wait for leftovers!  YUM!  Thanks, lovestohost!

Okay I was skeptical, but after my husband ate one  he commented how great these meatballs are. I thought they were delicious as well. They are great all by themselves. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe. 
UPDATE: I've made these many times, always a hit! To make them easier on DH's digestion, I cut the red pepper to 1/4 tsp and the worcestershire to 2 tsp. and skipped the red hot sauce. They are good either way. They do freeze and reheat well. Makes great meatball pizza, sandwiches, spaghetti. as well as plain, but do need a sauce/gravy of some type.

Delicious.  I was craving spaghetti but was too lazy to make sauce so I decided to put some homemade meatballs into jarred sauce I've had sitting for a while.  These meatballs definitely took the jarred sauce up a few levels and became an amazing comfort food dinner.  I had to make a few subs based on what I had on hand.  1.  ~2 tbsp minced onions instead of real onions.  2.  Soy milk instead of normal milk (can't drink it).  3. No hot sauce.  4.  Shredded mozzarella instead of Parmesean.  After they cooked I put them in the jarred sauce on the stovetop and simmer for about 40 minutes before serving.

These are very good.  I mixed all ingredients together and added the ground beef last.   Used dried minced onion rather than grating a fresh onion.  Also used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.   I used an ice cream scoop to get uniform sizes and this made 16 meatballs with my scoop.   I would double the recipe next time so that I have plenty to freeze.  Thanks for a great meatball recipe.

I have made this recipe numerous times and it never disappoints! 5 stars for the recipe exactly as written. Occasionally, I change it up by using fresh garlic and adding one extra hot sausage (casing removed).

I made sweet and sour source and simmered the cooked meatball in a sauce pan for about 5 minutes. It's delicious. My kid liked it very much.

We substituted Cholua for the hot sauce, I had Panko breadcrumbs on hand, so we just added a little bit more Italian seasoning.? my 12-year-old son really wanted meatballs and we chose this recipe, they were really good!

I made this with Beyind Beef. It was yummy and pretty much I distinguishable from "real" meatballs. I also used an egg instead of milk.

I made this exactly as written and thought the meatballs were very flavorful. Next time I will cut back on Italian Seasoning and Oregano as this came through quite powerfully. I will make again.

WOW!!! best meatball recipe I've ever tried!! I just doubled the spices since I used 2lbs. of ground beef and substituted powdered garlic for fresh minced garlic. I think the Worcestershire sauce took it over the top so do not leave it out!! I also left out the crushed red pepper...dont like spicy but other than that it's my go to!!! was Incredibly moist and flavorful!!! I used a tbl spoon to portion the meatballs..will make about 45 or so.

This was amazing! I read a couple of comments that stated that the meatballs were dense and I did the following to prevent: 1) did as another poster mentioned in mixing all the ingredients and allowing to sit prior to adding ground beef. 2) Soaked 2 slices of white sandwich bread in water, squeezed out excess water, took off crusts, and mixed into my mixture.

It took me a few goes to get this just right, however it's my favorite meatball to make.
I add 1 lbs. of Italian Sausage and double the rest of the ingredients.

I’ve made this several times now.  I follow the recipe as listed except for omitting hot sauce.  My grandkids love these.  I usually make about 3 pounds of ground beef.  I bake on a foil lined pan for easy clean up.  I freeze them on the pan and after they are frozen, I store them in plastic bags to muse as needed. These are great for a quick meal!

LOVED this recipe! Only had a Mexican cheese blend on hand so used that instead of the parmesan and still tasted great! Used the meatballs in a spaghetti squash and meatballs recipe I found online. Will definitely be making these meatballs again & again! Meatball Nirvana  is a justified name for this recipe!!

The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is because I’ve had better, those these were terrific.  I substituted onion powder for the fresh stuff, but otherwise kept to the recipe. The meat balls were a bit loose, so the next time I make them I’m going to add an egg. However, the flavor is nice.

I made 2oz meatballs and baked them on parchment paper. I finished them off in 6-hour marinara and served them over al-dente zucchini noodles. Tasty and easy.

I have made these twice now. This second time I did a lb of sage sausage I needed to use up in addition to the ground beef and doubled the recipe. I also halved the red pepper and omitted the hot sauce as a couple of people in our household do not like a whole lot of spice.

This is my go to meatball recipe and it's always a big hit, even with my picky 7yr old.

Great meatballs. I agree with many on the page that the onion should be grated instead of diced to avoid big pieces but still get all the flavor. And the first time I made them with salt and garlic salt they came out too salty. But dial back the salt content and use minced garlic instead of garlic salt and bang.....delicious meatballs.

I made these and they were by far the best meatballs I've had!  As per usual, I modified the recipe. EOM always makes me up my substitution game. I had no milk, just use sour cream and a bit of water; no bread crumbs, use corn bread mix. I used a meat sauce in lieu of Worcestershire. They were excellent! full of flavor  and the hubs liked them too! He gets nervous when I start throwing things in my cauldron!  I added them to a box noodle meal.

I have never left a comment on recipe until now. Great recipe as is, no need to vary. Made them as is and turned out great. My family loved them with the spaghetti and was a big hit. If you like a little spice, these are great! I will definitely double up the amount next time.

Loved these!  We made them with ground beef and ground pork (half and half), no Italian seasonings but kept the oregano, and cut back on the bread crumbs by maybe a quarter.  With no hot sauce on hand, subbed in chipotle powder.  Ahmazing, thanks for this great recipe!

Really like this recipe and the kids loved it.  I did make one tweak substituting 1/2 lb of pork for 1/2 lb off the beef.

I didn’t reach nirvana.  They could have been softer.  There was a lot of dried seasoning.  I don’t even own garlic salt or Italian seasoning, so I had to improvise with my own mix.  Honestly I’ve never seen garlic salt used in a recipe.  The onion should be minced or finely diced.  I added only about 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper and my daughter complained.  It’s not for everyone.

Way too spicy and salty.  I made it with 2 1/2 lbs of ground beef, so I increased (basically doubled) all ingredients proportionately.  Altering the recipe, I would probably start by replacing the garlic salt with garlic and eliminate the red pepper flakes and hot sauce.

Wow! Come as you are into my kitchen for a bite of these delicious meatballs. The whole house was smelling like teen spirit as I slow cooked these tender meat berries for the family. They had us feeling better than a dose of lithium. I’d put them in a heart-shaped box for my sweetie any day.
True Meatball Nirvana, just as the name suggests.

Used 1 1/4 lb. of lean chopped beef so I used one egg and a splash of 1% Milk. Very tasty except next time I would use less salt overall. Held together really well. I also turned them halfway through cooking

This is the best meatball recipe I’ve found and my friends and partner ask me to make it for them all the time! I bump up the Parmesan a little bit to 3/4cup, which increases the mass of the mixture to just enough to very cozily feed our house of four for dinner. I never buy skim milk so our whole milk works just fine, and I like to use sriracha for the hot sauce. Amazing dish.. less than an hour of work that I don’t have to stand for all of. I feel so competent making these.

Followed this recipe exactly but doubled the ingredients since I had 2 lbs of meat. I didn’t have garlic salt so I used adobo and I didn’t have oregano so I used sazonador total. It came out so good. Definitely my favorite and go to meatballs going forward!

Very good as is. Like some other comments i mix all ingredients except meat and let it sit for 10 mins, then combine. Also most of the time I make it with 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 mild italian sausage.

My go to meatball recipe! It's great since I can leave the hot stuff out to make a few for the kids, and then just add the rest for my husband and I. He's brought it to work for his friends to try and they are obsessed too.

I feel like my small onion was too much and “dice” was too vague. Its frustrating when a recipe yields different results simply because of the use of relative terms. Overall I was happy with the meatballs although I wouldve been happier leaving out the hot sauce and using half the yellow onion I used. Once sauce was combined with the meatballs, they did taste even better. Give these a try and use about 1/4-1/3c onion finely diced.

Delicious, flavorful. Every child and grownup here loved them and noticed that they were different! I followed the recipe but cut the red pepper flakes to 1/4 the amount because of kiddos. I added all the seasonings to the milk to make sure it was evenly distributed throughout the meat before adding the crumbs and cheese. I did add 1/4 tsp black pepper, as submitter suggested, to my 6 serving batch.

This recipe worked well and the meatballs tasted delicious. In the future, I will use half the onion and add more salt. A keeper!

I thought i had too much onion, but it was delicious. I had it with spaghetti and vodka sauce. It was very very good. Thank you for the recipe! I will definitely make this again.

I made it tonight and my mouth is still burning from the red pepper. Way too much! 
Take away the red pepper, add sautéed green peppers and finely chopped onions, add one egg, 1/2 cup of typical bread crumbs and 1/2 cup of homemade breadcrumbs (I got a French bread from the store and cut it in half and tore off pieces and let them sit for a few hours) 
Form meatballs, brown them in skillet. Add sauce and simmer for about 45 minutes. 
Your mouth will thank you

I have made this exact recipe SO many times and it never fails. I always make a double batch and freeze some in ziplock bags. They freeze very well.

Very good! I used half beef and half pork and substituted  day old bread for the crumbs.. I also soaked everything except the meat in the milk for about 15 minutes. Will definitely make this again.

The only change I made was to double the recipe. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  I was surprised that no eggs were required. The meatballs were delicious, but fairly heavy and dense.  We really liked the taste, but I believe that an egg or two would have made for a lighter texture.

My husband and I liked this recipe. I did not add the hot sauce and reduced the red pepper flakes but we both found it still too hot.  I would leave out the red pepper next time.

Followed the recipe except for the Italian seasoning. Used  just garlic, salt, pepper and oregano.  After making it the first time, I tripled the recipe for the freezer. I used a quarter cup measure so they were uniform. I'm not much of a beef person, but my Italian husband loves these.

I just finished eating these - omg, best I have ever had, anywhere!!!! Husband likes them better than my regular meatballs, which are fried. These will be MY meatballs from now on! I had to make a few slight variations as I did not have all ingredients on hand, but not much: in place of garlic salt, I used garlic powder; in place of Italian blend seasoning, I used 3/4 t basil, 1/4 t oregano, 1/4 t thyme and 1/4 t sage. Wow wow wow!!! I’d give this 6 stars if I could!

This is MY recipe!!    --except I use an egg instead of milk,  (allergies) and add extra seasonings : garlic, oregano, parsley, and onion seasoning--because we like SPICY!  I also usually add some parmesan cheese .

Hubbie just said "you make the BEST meatballs!  I make them for family gatherings and they are devoured immediately from the app table (usually with our favorite BBQ sauce). Wish I could take credit for these truly awesome meatballs.  They have become a staple in our house.  I do have to cut back on the red pepper flakes (but definitely suggest using them), otherwise the recipe as is makes perfection.

I've never made something the same way twice, that includes meatballs. This is the first meatball recipe I made years back. I've since made countless other meatball recipes not finding what I want. I came back to your recipe and the only change I made was using crushed rosemary olive oil crackers for breadcrumbs and ricotta cheese or sour cream for the milk. Absolutely my favorite. #1 meatball recipe hands down.

Yes, I used ground oatmeal instead of bread crumbs to make it gluten free and left out the Parmesan.

Delicious!!   The only tweak(s) I made are the same as many other reviewers.  1/2 lean ground beef, 1/2 Italian sausage and a little extra hot sauce & red pepper flakes.  I've probably made this recipe over 10 times now and my family still LOVES it.  Mama Mia!!

Really tasty. I added a bit more pepper flakes for added heat. With the leftovers we made meatball subs with a simple pasta sauce, mozzarella and provolone cheese.

I didn’t change anything and my family said these were the best meatballs I ever made. I thought so too. I will definitely make them again.

This recipe made for a very tender meatball, but the combination of ingredients gave it a rather odd taste.  I think the Worcestershire sauce contributed to that, and I would lessen or leave that out next time.  I did use half  85% ground beef and half ground pork.   Probably a very good recipe with a little bit of tinkering.

I thought it stayed together well and had good flavor . When I make it again I think I will add just a few more spices and red pepper flakes.

I used half lean beef and half ground pork, and replaced the skim milk with half a cup of ricotta cheese.  Used recommended amount of chili flakes and 5 dashes Chipotle  Tabasco. Noticeable heat but not overwhelming for anyone who like buffalo sauce equivalent or more.
Had to cook for 45 min on 400 and finished on high broil for approx 5 min. (note: the meatballs were 2" wide) 
Might want to consider searing in a pan before or after to achieve a more desired outer texture and look.  The broil added a little bit of crunch to the top but could definitely go for more coverage. Also, maybe try smaller diameter next time.

These meatballs are amazing! I just made this tonight and they were SO GOOD! I served them on mini chibata rolls broiled in the oven and topped them with marinara sauce and mozzarella cheese. They were outstanding, and even my kids enjoyed them. 

I made them exactly as the recipe stated, except I did use 1/2 pound ground beef & 1/2 pound ground sausage. We had a few left over and I plan on freezing them for a quick snack or lunch. I made 18 meatballs and cooked for 25 minutes. Perfect!

Thank you for sharing your recipe! We loved it!

Perfection!  These have a little spicy kick. I tripled the recipe and froze most of them for busy weeknights. I also made a few hamburgers with this recipe. They were delicious but a bit too spicy for my taste. But when eaten in spaghetti sauce, they are just wonderful!

These meatballs are the best I’ve ever made! The only changes I made were eliminating the dried oregano (I didn’t realize I was out of it!) and cooking the meatballs in my slow cooker with sauce. They turned out delicious, firm but not tough. I will absolutely make these again and again.

Perfect meatballs.  I doubled the recipe so I could add a pound of ground Italian pork (my husband hunts and makes his own pork sausage).  Planned on saving the leftovers but there weren’t any.

minor changes.  We had just had 2 days of spicy food and I wanted a more traditional Italian meat ball. So I omitted the hot sauce and while I included the red pepper flakes I just sprinkled. I wasn't sure about what type of bread crumbs so I tore a couple slices of bread into small pieces. Also used less onion or maybe my onion was big. I used less Parmesan in the meatballs as I was adding some on top to serve. These were fantastic and I will be making them again, next time I may up the heat!

I used venison instead of beef. Added paprika and extra spices. Instead of milk I used one egg. Awesome recipe thanks for sharing.

Good recipe. A bit too much heat first time I made it. Second time around used fresh garlic less heat. Also went half pork and beef. Otherwise followed recipe to the letter.

This got an immediate "make these again". Glad I followed other reviewers and doubled the recipe. Made around 40 meatballs and I put half in the freezer for later. I did use half beef and half italian sausage. Wonderful flavor, was not dry and made for a pretty easy meal prep. Baked them  in the oven and then added them to the crockpot with some sauce for two hours.

Fantastic! I tried one of the readers kind suggestions to make the meatballs with 50% ground  beef and 50% ground veal and substituted Ricotta cheese for skim milk..Nirvana achieved! Definitely on my repeat recipe rotation!

These were yummy!  Put them in some of my favorite spaghetti sauce and fresh rolls with provolone melted on top for amazing meatball subs that were devoured by hubby and granddaughter.  Will make again but definitely using the aluminum foil over the cookie sheet next time!

I rated this 4 stars because I changed the all ground beef to half Italian sausage/ half lean ground beef. I did double the recipe also, but those were the only changes I made. We made meatball sandwiches with them and they were amazing!!

This is a great recipe!  I did tweak it just a bit.  I used a packaged meat blend for meatballs/meatloaf (beef, veal & pork).  And I used a couple crushed cloves of garlic & half n half because I didn’t have any milk.   I made them for a game night, so I threw them in my crockpot with a couple jars of sauce and kept them on low.  
Followed the recipe other than the few exceptions and they came out great!

I made this recipe and it is super easy!  I hate to cook!  I made these for my nephew who is very, very fussy and he said they were a hit! :)  I thought they were awesome!  I will make them again only doubling the recipe so we can have more. :)  Great for having meatball sandwiches as well.  Thank You!

Made these meatballs yesterday to go into my sauce. Absolutely tasty meatballs. I used a few drops of Siracha Sauce because I did not have plain Hot Sauce on hand. But I will say.... the perfect amount of kick ?? I will definitely make these with my sauce again.

My husband and I really enjoyed these meatballs. I had never baked meatballs before having always preparing them in a slow cooker in the past. I was afraid they would be dry but they were definitely not. I watched the cooking time and checked them closely so as not to over cook. We ate them with marinara sauce. I will certainly use this recipe again.

Followed recipe precisely for meatballs.  Delicious.  No need to adjust anything! Added some extra spices to sauce.  Garlic and onion powder,  oregano and basil, and some brown sugar to reduce acidity a bit.  It was a huge hit!  Served with angel hair pasta and a side Caesar.  Meatball subs tomorrow night!  It’s a keeper!

We typically do not use beef, so subbed lean ground turkey and a smidgen of Italian sausage for flavor. The meatballs are tasty, have a nice spice kick and are easy to make and cook. Used aluminum foil on the baking sheet for easy clean up afterward. Good recipe.

I loved the combination of ingredients, but the balls were a little "tough."  I had hoped they would be more tender.  I may have messed up.

absolutely life changing!  We made these litter gems exactly as shown, then prepared garlic bread sub rolls and covered with store bought marinara and provolone cheese.

Best Meatball sandwich I've ever eaten!  Don't keep looking, try them!!!

This recipe does NOT sound appealing at all. I use pork, veal and 85/15 beef for moisture and flavor.  Using freshly grated Romano cheese and 2 cups of stale Italian bread crumbled along with garlic, eggs and fresh parsley with lukewarm water make my meatballs moist and flavorful.

Cannot possibly be the nirvana if made without any Italian sausage. I’ve never heard of baking in the oven instead of browning in a pan full of oil but interesting idea like bacon in the oven. Still no sausage no meatball in my opinion. Might try the baking idea sounds easier

Best meatballs ever.  Great for spaghetti, sandwiches, or just alone.  I do one step better and cook them in a wood pellet grill.

Pretty good, I made it last night. But, I never use garlic salt, I always use garlic powder or fresh minced garlic. I also use fresh parsley in my meatballs, & I divide the meat by using ground round, & then an equal amount of fresh ground pork, so it doesn’t end up dry. I don’t use milk, but I do use a can of stewed Italian tomato’s , including the juice. I chop the tomato’s. I add a whole beaten egg, onion powder, coarse black pepper, salt, Italian seasoning , with my fresh minced garlic, & chopped finely parsley. The fresh Parmesan is essential. And I make my own seasoned bread crumbs. Believe me it’s worth the extra effort. 
But, I wanted to try this, & no offense it could not compare to mine

No doubt this is a great meatball recipe. But the term "nirvana" in Buddhist teaching refers to the cessation of desire, not its satisfaction. Please use the term correctly and use a different word to describe the meatballs.

My kids (5&8) love these meatballs. I use cheddar or a Mexican blend instead of parmesan. I also go easy seasonings, and use 100% whole wheat panko bread crumbs.

Added some chopped spinach to sneak some greens into the recipe. I also usually use ground turkey, which has a more uniform texture after it is cooked that find more enjoyable than ground beef.

Delicious!!! I doubled the recipe and used a package of ground meatball mix and page of ground 93% ground beef. It was a little over 2 lb of meat. I could have chopped onions smaller. Still yummy!

I printed this recipe on 11/23/18. It called for 3 Tbls of Worcestersauce now it says 1 1-2 hum?? I use 3 and it comes out great. I might even dilute a teaspoon of beef base with a little water and add that to deepen the flavor.

I made this twice. The first time, I put too much oregano in it because I did not have the proper measuring spoon. The second time, I complete forgot the oregano. However, I still brought it to my work for the potluck and everyone likes it! Everyone people I have never met before told me that the meatballs were good!

Absolutely delicious!!! I ate them plain and they were perfect! There is so much seasoning and flavor that it needs nothing else, although I am sure with some noodles and sauce it would be fantastic as well.

Like another contributor, I fought the urge to put some of "my" things in here - it's so different from what I usually make but I made it totally as written.  They are wonderful and I'm glad I made a double batch.  Admittedly, I did cut back a smidge on the red pepper flakes but only because I'm not overly fond of them.  
Great recipe!

I made these last night for dinner and they were great. I did not have onion so I added onion powder and used shredded cheddar because we were out of parmesan. They baked up nice with a crisp outer coating. We threw them on top of our spaghetti.  Yum. This is going into the favorites.

I made this recipe for nirvana meatballs and it was easy and delicious! I changed it a little by leaving out the red pepper and hot sauce. I also used fat free half and half instead of milk. I made the mixture a day in advance and let the flavors blend overnight in a ziplock bag. I lined the cookie sheet with foil and sprayed the foil with Pam. I baked for 23 minutes and they turned out moist and delicious! Will definately make this again. I could also see this recipe as an Italian Meatloaf covered with ketchup.

Super-easy and tasty.   I still have a bunch in the freezer.  What I liked about this recipe was that there was no veal involved.

My family loved them.

I make this for large family gatherings and it is ALWAYS a huge hit.  They are moist and full of flavor.  They go well as part of a sub, with pasta or just on their own.  Huge favorite every time I make it.

Made exactly as written here and these are fabulous!  Great to eat totally plain or to put in spaghetti sauce.   They have better flavor than any meatballs I have ever made.  I think the Worcestershire is the key ingredient!

Excellent! I added 1 1/2 cloves of minced garlic instead of garlic salt and grated a small onion with the juice instead of dicing. It added so much flavor and moisture to the meatball. I also used panko breadcrumbs for a better texture. Once cooked I mixed them with with sauteed red & green peppers in a tomato basil pasta sauce and served them on a panini bun  topped with melted mozzarella.

The Worcestershire sauce gives this recipe a little something extra over the standard meatball recipes that I have tried.  I prefer to bake these on a baking sheet with a wire rack to allow the grease to drain off.   Easy recipe to double and freeze half for another meal.

Delicious. Modifications: I didn’t have any garlic salt, so I threw in four cloves of garlic, used fresh oregano instead of dried, used stovetop stuffing for bread crumbs, and added an egg cause the mix was dry. It tasted yummy. Next time, I will triple the recipe to have extra for freezing.

I have made this so many times now. Love it. We do go with the ground beef/ground sausage mix which I think makes them even more amazing (although you will get more splatter when they cook). We made smaller ones for appetizers, and tennis ball size for italian night!

I was looking for a meatball recipe that would compliment my robust spaghetti sauce. This recipe competed with the sauce instead. They would probably be better served Swedish style.
I will not make these again

My husband and I make these meatballs with ground turkey and they are a huge hit.  My father in law is opposed to ground turkey, couldn't tell and loved them.  When we first made these, we found them to be a smidge salty so we cut out the garlic salt and use either garlic powder or minced garlic, and use a bit less regular salt than what it calls for.  LOVE this recipe.

I made these and they were really good. The only thing I'd do differently is add less crushed red peppers (husband and 10 yr old step-daughter (who loves spicy food) says they were a little too spicy. And bake them at a lower temp. They came out a little too well done. Other than that I loved them even with them being spicy.

I love this recipes as is! I’ve made it with beef or turkey. And it’s always delicious. I don’t use the hot sauce because I don’t have it around. I do add extra pepper flakes. After I’m done baking them I love adding them to my marinara sauce to give it my sauce and the meatballs more flavor. It’s always a hit when I make it :) This is the only meatball recipe it use.

Have made this recipe several times with rave reviews!  Taking these little bites of heaven, covered in Bolognese Sauce (recipe also from this site, minus the meat called for in that recipe) to a football party today - true nirvana.  Thanks for a great recipe, lovestohost!

I think... Is that it?! This is truly meatball Nirvana- so simple and so tasty. Great for a weeknight dinner. Seasoning was perfect and the end result was absolutely delicious. Will definitely make again!! 
UPDATE: Used A1 Steak Sauce 2nd time, turned out great!

I used ground turkey for the beef and pork and an egg for milk (as I read from a review the egg worked just as well). They were delish! Next time I will be sure to follow the recipe ingredients to compare.

These meatballs were very tasty, but I have a few must-do tips.  Dice the onions very fine.  Mine were diced normally and my meatballs looked like porcupines.  Line you tray with foil and then  grease the foil.  My meatballs stuck to the tray and some broke when I tried to release them.

Made these for dinner for guests. I did modify slightly. I used 1/4 spicy chorizo and 3/4 ground beef. Still came out amazing. Probably the best tasting meatballs I've ever had. Guests were raving about them and asked for the recipe. I will be making these again. The photo is from right before I placed them in the oven. I forgot to take a post bake photo.

These are by far the best meatballs I've ever had! I don't eat beef so I make them with ground turkey. I oftentimes make a double batch, so we have some leftovers. My daughter, who is a really picky eater, gobbles these down.

Word to the wise: don’t use a baking pan that isn’t raised/ doesn’t have tin foil to catch the grease. Amazing recipe but we had a bit of a mess to clean up.

Being from Italian descent, I always followed my moms sauce w meatballs; seeing the recipe on AllRecipes, making some changes, adding a smashed garlic, wine & Worchester saunce, gave an 'old recipe' a very much new touch!!Big hit with family and friends;

Delicious. My family loved these meatballs. They asked me to make them again this week. They are easy, straightforward, and added with marina sauce and pasta or crusty bread make a great main dish. I did not chop my onions enough in my opinion. I think if I'd diced them very small these would be even better. I will make again.

Made this exactly per the recipe. We thought it was good but there's a lot going on. Will make again but with the following adjustments: no hot sauce, no onions (onion powder instead) and 1/2 cup of milk opposed to the 1/3 cup listed in the recipe and some chopped fresh parsley.  Good base recipe though.

Delicious, easy and versatile. I chose to leave the hot ingredients out. I brought them to a party, in a predominantly, ITALIAN, small town in  NJ.
 I served the warm meatballs, accompanied with fresh warm Italian rolls, from a local bakery. Made sure to have extra Marinara, Parm, Mozz, & hot pepper on the side. Completely gone in an hour ( I made 2 chafing trays) .........
 Many compliments followed.

Came out super tasty!  I would not suggest doing it on tin foil like it says on the footnotes . It made it well done on the bottom. And if you do not like it to spicy I would suggest putting less pepper flakes

Making these for a second time. The first time, they disappeared!! Using fresh jalapeño from the garden instead of small onion. That’s the only change I made and we love them!!

Uh...YUM. I felt guilty putting sauce on these to make subs. (Only change I made was one egg in place of milk.) Edit: Made this last night with turkey because it's what I had on hand. Was still really good!

Great meatballs! I replaced the milk with an egg and went light on the red pepper flakes, and it still had a little kick. These would be good in sauce in a sandwich or over pasta. Trying to cut back on carbs myself, I had some for supper in a store-bought sauce. Just didn't have time to make my own sauce, which would have been better. Thanks for the recipe!

If I could give this 6 stars I would.  I make large batches and freeze so they are always on hand.  The flavour is so good it doesn't need any accompaniment.

I made this recipe but omitted the onion (bc I didn't have any) and used crushed red pepper (about 1/4 tsp- that is what I had on hand). I also used plain breadcrumbs. I think it was good. When you first bite into the meatball it taste like an Italian meatball then  you get a small kick of spice. I would make them again.

This is an excellent meatball recipe. I have made it at least a dozen times and everyone raves about it. I always sauté the onion before adding it to the meat, add a few dashes of Montreal steak seasoning and add an egg but those are just my preferences. I can’t ever seem to leave a recipe alone! I am sure it would still be 5 stars without my changes.

I cooked them around 20 minutes and used ricotta cheese instead of the milk about 1/2 cup per pound of meat. I also added a bit of pepper and some seasoning salt. I have been freezing them in packs of 4-6 and they make perfect mini-meals. So good.

Foolproof recipe!  Made just as recipe reads and the meatballs were delicious!  They were moist and stayed moist even after freezing (for over a month) and thawing in the microwave.

I love this recipe! I've made numerous adjustments though: I use turkey instead of beef (make sure to get 93% lean, 7% fat), but that's just to be "healthy". Dice the onions very finely. I tend to have a heavy hand with the hot sauce and only put in 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes. I've started adding about 1/4 tsp parsley, and make the garlic salt a very rounded 1/2 tsp. I do not add the sea salt at all. I use just a tad less than 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce. Since that adds some more moisture to the mix I go a little less on the milk, just shy of the 1/3 cup.

I was looking for a quick meatball recipe and found this one. My family loved it! I have two teenagers, so I doubled the recipe and it took almost the same amount of prep time, but had plenty for leftovers. Instead of using 2 lbs of hamburger, I used 1 lb of hamburger and 1 lb of ground elk and it was delicious! This will now be a staple in our household!

Fantastic meatballs recipe. I only used real garlic instead of garlic salt, and used very little celery salt. I just made 5 Ibs , and used about 1 teaspoon of the celery salt. I didn't change anything of all other ingredients ! thanks very much for this recipe

I would give 10 stars if I could. Absolutely delish,  made exactly as recipe, except for skim milk, used whole and used garlic paste instead of garlic salt. They were so moist. I did grate the onions. I had some sauce frozen, thawed and dipped in that, made hoagies, topped with mozzarella and provolone cheese. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing this gem.

Love these meatballs.  I made them exactly as written here the first time, and now I might change it up a bit if I don't have something on hand, but they are always perfect.  Whenever I make them, people want to know the recipe.

These meatballs were delicious! The flavor kind of reminded me of a meatloaf. I will definitely be making them again. I made them with spaghetti, I can't wait to try the leftovers on a meatball sandwich tomorrow!

This is a really good recipe. I was reviewing the comments, and I see that I am among very accomplished cooks, so my comments may be amateurish .i couldn’t find the recipe that my second mother, of Italian descent, shared with me many years ago, but this comes close. I did a double batch and doubled the Parmesan and left the breadcrumbs the same as a single batch. I also used ground chuck, since I was out

so easy and so delicious.  After reading reviews I used 1 pd bison and 1 pd pork.  The rest I doubled. I also subbed 1 1/2 cups of ricotta.  I bought a loaf of bread and made my own croutons in processor. I made about 3 dozen smaller meatballs and froze in a few baggies for later. There is so much flavor!! I was really happy with results.

I used it as a loose recipe, substituting as I needed to.  Came out quite well.  I would try again with a closer version to the original--it might be a 5.

Made pretty much as recipe states. Didn’t have Italian bread crumbs so added more Italian seasoning and 1 pc torn up bread. Followed rcommendation of putting all minutes (so bread can absorb milk) then add meat. Though tasty, I am not sure if I liked my meatballs spicy...may omit pepper flakes and sauce next time for something different.  Served with spaghetti and pasta sauce.

This was just what I was looking for! I used the food processor to make the onions grated so there weren't any big chunks and they were amazing. My 5 year old felt they were too spicy so will be omitting the spicy elements tomorrow when I make it again. Watch the video-it helped me so much to know how much to blend the ingredients.

Gratted the onion into a fine paste. No chunks in a meatball. Added fresh garlic done the same way as onion. Used fresh Basil. Great combo. Rest of the procedure was the same.

I LOOOVEE this recipe!  It is fast and easy to make, and the name is very fitting -- true meatball nirvana.  I've made it multiple times now without changing a single ingredient.  Well, other than this last time, swapping out ground beef for ground turkey.   And my carnivore husband who protests anything ground turkey gobbled them up without so much as a question as to whether he had been tricked into eating turkey.  The meatballs always form well and stay together, but are tender and juicy inside.  The flavors are sublime.   I must confess to being a recipe tinkerer, but this one is perfection out of the gate.  Tonight we ate the meatballs on pasta with red sauce but I can't wait to sandwich the leftover babies into some crusty bread for a meatball sub tomorrow or the next day.

Followed the recipe exactly. Used for spaghetti and meatball dinner. These were okay but a long way from the best meatball I've ever had.  Funny texture to them that put me off on first bite.  Recipe makes about 20 1 1/2" meatballs.

Truly the best meatballs ever! Was looking for an all beef recipe and stumbled on this one.  The only  thing i changed was subbing minced garlic and salt for the garlic salt. So tasty!

This is my favorite meatball recipe and now the only one I make! I always get compliments. I do not add as much onion, but that's just personal preference.

Great easy recipe. I let it sit in the fridge for 30 minutes before I baked them, it let the flavor intensify. Will be making them again.

I made the recipe exactly as written, other than making a quadruple batch so I had plenty to stick some in the freezer. They were easy to put together and tasted great. They have a little bit of spice...which we love.

This recipe is SO good. This is mine and my sister's go to for meatballs. We both love making these for company because they are always a hit. We always give credit to the creator of the recipe but we've made these so many times that we joke Meatball Nirvana is our "family recipe" :p By the time I have grandchildren they will be passing this down as "grandma's meatball recipe".

This was my first time making homemade meatballs and they turned out great!

I'm not sure how to add notes that I can read next time I make this so I'm going to include them here.    I used 1lb of ground been and 1/2lb of Italian sausage.    For the rest of the ingredients I changed the serving size from 4 to 6.    I used 1tsp of onion powder instead of the small onion, garlic powder instead of garlic salt, an egg with a splash of milk, only half of the red pepper flakes and omitted the hot sauce.

I put the meat together in a ziplock bag and mixed it through the bag then added the egg/milk/worcestershire sauce to the bag to mix with the meat.  In a separate bowl I added all the dry ingredients to the seasoned bread crumbs.     Next I put the meat mixture in the dry ingredient bowl and mixed together.  I divided it into 4 large balls then divided each of those balls into 5 smaller balls which ended up being a little bigger than a golf ball.  I baked on a rack at 400 for 20 minutes and then put them in the crockpot on low with marinara.

Very good meatballs, and easy to make.  I used a 50-50 beef-pork combo, just to add some pizzazz.  I made a tomato/red sauce, and put the cooked meatballs in it to simmer for 30 minutes, just to add flavor & color. Made some garlic bread from a French loaf. Let everyone make their own mini-meatball sandwiches, adding as much or little red sauce to it as they desired. Mmm good!

Awesome recipe. I use half each of ground pork and ground beef, which gives the meatballs a better depth of flavour.

Very good. We all enjoyed the meatballs. Not outstanding but worth making again and pairing with an excellent sauce. I made a 1.5 X batch using 92/8 ground beef.  This made 18 meatballs averaging 67.8 calories each. (I added up calories by ingredients). I used Hunt's Garlic and Herb pasta sauce (40 cal/0.5 cup) and whole grain thin spaghetti (174 cal/cup - cooked).  I'll use a better sauce next time and substitute  spaghetti squash for spaghetti to make it healthier. We normally do this and enjoy it more but decided to try the spaghetti the first time we made this.

Solid recipe made out of staples I usually have on hand. Beats regular ground beef in spaghetti, and my kids had a lot of fun making the meat balls.

As far as flavor goes, I'm accustomed to making meat balls with 1:2 pork sausage to ground beef, and I have a preference for that--but for a straight beef recipe, this one does the trick. 

I found that I needed to add one egg to a double batch for stick-togetherness, based on raw texture of the mix, but I also used home made bread crumbs, which may have been more absorbent than store bought.

With the Worcestershire sauce and the onions, these tasted more like balls of meatloaf than meatballs to me.  I did go light on the pepper/hot sauce.  I didn't dislike them, but they weren't what I was expecting.

I have made these twice, both pretty much following the recipe, but I put a note to review them after trying the changes from "Italian Tapas". 

Both are very good, but I think the changes from Italian Tapas make them even better: swap the 1/3 cup of skim milk for 1/2 cup of ricotta, and use 1/2 pound each of ground pork and ground beef. I could not get lean ground beef,  and used 80/20 and it was fine, especially since the ground pork I get is very lean.

The other things I didn't do: I don't keep garlic salt as I watch my sodium content, so I used granulated garlic, next time I might cut the 1/2 tsp of sea salt-which I also don't keep, to the same amount or less, of kosher salt. I don't get seasoned bread crumbs as there are ingredients in them that I either can't have or don't want to eat. I used 1/2 cup of plain panko and rolled a rolling pin over them first. 

I made a tester to see if I wanted to put fennel seeds in them, and much as I love fennel seed, I didn't add them. I also did not bake them in the oven on a rack, as I usually do. I used my 2-qt air fryer. I preheated it to 390º, put half the meatballs in for 5 min. gave them a shake and another 5 min-done. I did them in two batches, but I have a lot less mess to clean up. The air fryer basket is much easier to clean than a gridded cooling/baking rack., AND the air fryer does not heat up the kitchen, which is nice, as we are about 80º today.

Try Meatball Nirvana either way, or both ways and make up your own mind,

This was a perfect addition to our Super Bowl party. These meatballs were fantastic! I do think the only thing I'll do differently next time is use a shallot as opposed to a regular-sized onion because it seemed like quite a few onions. Still, it was very flavorful. I'm definitely making these again.

Great recipe!  I got tons of compliments.  I may try adding ground pork next time as well as back off of the oregano.  This is simply to compliment my pasta sauce as they were great on their own.

Turned out great, next time I would decrease the salts slightly.  Instead of baking these, I browned them on stovetop, then simmered them about 30 minutes in spaghetti sauce. VERY GOOD

These were much more delicious that we expected.  I don't eat red meat, however my wife and daughter do.  They always kind of pooh pooh my ground turkey adventures.  However, they just  LOVED these meatballs made with ground turkey, and even admitted that they were better than any they've tasted before.  A real repeat!

I followed the recipe exactly, but it looked too dry to form into meatballs.  Added one beaten egg after reading other meatball recipes and they came out fine.  Very good meatballs to bake, store in a plastic bag in the freezer and take out  as needed.

Best meatballs ever! Made just as the recipe calls for and they are excellent.

To everyone that has added this, removed that or changed various things.....they really aren’t fairly reviewing THIS recipe.....post your own recipe and let us try and review it.

Great recipe and very flavorful, this will be my go to meatball recipe and super easy. I did change a couple things: didn't have any parm, don't like and didn't have hot sauce so I omitted, sauteed the onion in a bit of olive oil first, and instead of garlic salt I put in probably 2 tbsp minced garlic (love garlic).

Best recipe! I do double it (1 lb. ground beef & 1 lb. ground pork). I also omit the milk, use fresh bread crumbs, fresh garlic (not garlic salt), add 2 eggs and omit the oregano (doubling the Italian seasoning). I usually chill these, portion them out, then freeze them with my vacuum sealer. All you have to do for a quick meal is dump the frozen meatballs in some sauce and simmer until they are thawed. My son LOVES them and I always keep them handy in the freezer for the busy winter months so I have a quick meal in a snap when I get home from work!

I have made these meatballs a number of times and they've always turned out great. Of course, I tweek the recipe to fit our tastes. I use half hot Italian sausage half ground beef, and quadruple the recipe and freeze a bunch for easy meals later. 
I have used these meatballs when feeding the masses and not once did people turn their noses up to the meal. Just the other day I made huge pot of spaghetti for 6 hungry men and they all said it was the best they ever had, even my husband and son who have already had it many times. 
I use parchment paper in the cookie sheet to help with cleanup.

I made this recipe as outlined with 1 exception- I didn’t add the oregano simply because I somehow ran out and didn’t have any and my Italian seasoning has oregano in it already. I LOVE spice- especially spices used in Italian cooking- but it should be balanced. I practically choked on the amount of Italian seasoning in this- so much that, while everything looked well mixed, it was like biting into meat pockets of dry seasoning. I’m glad I didn’t have the extra oregano or we’d have a wasted a pound of meat! Bleh! It was edible drenched in a zesty marinara, but that’s the best compliment I can give it. Honestly, cut the Italian seasoning to 1/3 of the recipe, leave out the extra oregano, increase the red pepper flakes an garlic, and you’ll be much better off than following this to a T.

This is by far the best meatball recipe I've ever tried. I have modified it a little, by using dried minced onions, and very little milk because I'm using ground lamb instead. Also, I made this recipe for burgers on the grill with the lamb, and again it was delicious. One must be careful with lamburgers because they tend to want to fall apart, but it can be done! This one is a family staple, and I've never had a single meatball left.... everyone starts picking them off the baking pan before I have a chance to put them into a pasta recipe!

I made these tonight for meatball sliders with provolone on Hawaiian rolls. These were amazing. I followed the directions exactly except I added more or less of the ingredient as desired. Perfect meatball!

These are really great! I add half the pepper flakes and no hot sauce, because I'm a wuss, but otherwise followed the directions as is. I usually put them on a rack on top of a cookie sheet covered with aluminum foil to catch the drippings.

Things that make you say, "Mmmmmmm!" 
I left out the hot sauce, but otherwise made these per the recipe. They were just perfect and my family devoured them. My usual meatball recipe calls for half beef and half Italian sausage, but I didn't even miss the pork in this recipe.

One of the best recipes I ever found online - have been making these for over 6 years now. Adults rave about these when I make them as written, but kids find them too spicy. So, when I make them for my little ones I skip crushed pepper.

I've never been crazy about meatballs before but these were fantastic!!! I omitted the hot sauce (My husband doesn't like things to be too hot). Next time I make them I'll try the hot sauce and see how they go over.

12.9.17  Followed this recipe to the letter, and would make one change in the future...cut the red pepper flake amount in half.   We’re about middle to upper middle when it comes to spiciness, and we both felt the meatballs were a bit too hot.  This comment is not meant as a negative because we all have different personal tastes when it comes to spiciness.  I suppose we both prefer to have the Italian herbs be the dominant flavor in the meatballs with just a hint of spiciness.  I baked them to 160ºF which took 22 minutes, the texture was spot on perfect, and they were plenty tender and moist.  Served with World's Best Marinara from this site.

Great recipe! Simple, easy and quick! I didn’t have time to cut up the onion, so I subbed onion powder for an actual chopped onion. Would recommend this great recipe.

Made it using 1 lb ground beef and 1 lb pork(doubled all of the other ingredients). Meatballs were made using a 1in cookie scooper and they covered two cookie sheets(solidly). I thought we would have plenty left over for the next day but they were so good we had only four left! Not sure what the secret is to these but my family loved them.

I wanted to like these meatballs as much as the other reviewers did, but I personally don't like this amount of bread  crumbs in my meatballs.  It takes on a mealy flavor, with all meat, it tastes the way I want it to. The flavor was good however, nice choice of spices.

This is my go-to meatball recipe. Super yummy. Super easy. You can freeze them after you've cooked them so double the recipe and have them again in a month!

This is the sort of recipe that can be easily modified to taste, too. When doubling, I use half ground beef and half Italian sausage. When I do that, I leave off the red pepper flakes to keep the heat back. 

I grew up with my mom's excellent meatballs, but I never wanted to make them because she browned them in a skillet before putting them in the oven and it was so much work! Now, I make meatballs all the time. And, I sold my mom on this method. :)

VERY GOOD
This is the first meatball recipe I have tried and I am keeping it! I did reduced some spices as I am feeding a 2 year old, even son, these meatballs are still very flavourful. They are nice and moist and hold their form. Thank you for this recipe!

It was okay, but not a soft meatball at all;  was hoping for it to be fantastic.  Not one that I'll make again.

The italian restaurant in town must use this recipe! The only change I would make is add an egg to it and a few more bread crumbs. The egg will help keep them "glued" together. Extremely Excellent!
I made wide egg noodles, jarred Classico Marinara and layered it up in a bowl like the restaurant! Just need some chocolate cake now for dessert to top this off!

Feb 7th-now going to try this as italian meatloaf!

Just made this for the first time tonight. We had it with spaghetti and Ragu meat sauce. It was seriously amazing!! The meatballs turned boring spaghetti into a flavorful, restaurant-like meal! The only changes I made were not adding the hot sauce and reducing the red pepper slightly. Also made extra and froze them - very glad I did that now!!

I’m getting back into the swing of cooking, this is a great recipe as it sits if you want quick and easy! I went a lil heavy with some Tobasco (still freaking delicious!) Great recipe and my first time ever MAKING Meatballs. PERFECT.

Incredible!  By far the most flavourful meatballs ever!  I added half a teaspoon crushed garlic and used Herb and Parmesan Shake and Bake instead of breadcrumbs.

These are great. I also use this recipe for the meatballs in wedding soup. To save time, blend everything but the meat in the blender and then mix  the blended ingredients  with the meat. Bake in oven for more ease. I make 4 or 5 batches at a time and freeze the surplus.

I've made this as is, and followed the recipe exactly-5 stars! I also made it using another poster's recommendations by replacing the milk with ricotta cheese and using half ground beef and half ground pork.  I prefer it that way-10 stars! But bot ways are excellent and my family loves them. Have made these several times now. My go-to recipe for great meatballs. Thank you for this recipe!

Don't get me wrong they were good but just wasn't enough for me. It seem to be missing flavor. The only difference I made was egg instead of milk. how I ran out of milk with five kids I will never know lol. I don't think the egg made that much of a difference. I will try one more time and add more salt and herbs. also they burned at the bottom. I will flip them half way through next time.

Loved this recipe! So simple to throw together! I will use less onion next time though. I cut in half and served on a Hawaiian roll topped with marinara (tomato and basil) sauce and Italian cheese blend. Mini meatball marinara subs.

I used an onion packet, and a sprinkling of garlic and salt. I did not use hot sauce and cut the red pepper flakes to 1/4 tsp. It was still too spicy for me but my husband liked it.

I used minced garlic instead of garlic salt, every where else I followed the recipe.  Just the one dash of Franks Red Hot made it just a bit too spicy for my daughter to thoroughly enjoy but the boys all LOVED it.  Baked for more than 30 minutes... maybe I made the balls too big? Will definitely make again.

This is now my only recipe for meatballs. I wont eat meatballs from anywhere else now, because they aren’t as good as mine! No apologies. I do substitute an egg for the milk ( I feel it binds the meat together better) and I don’t add red  pepper flakes (kids) but everything else stays the same. These are sooo good and sooo easy and have become a regular rotation in our meals. I’ve doubled the batch and frozen them and they were still fantastic!

I've made these many times and they always turn out fabulous. Two suggestions...first, double the batch and freeze the extra...they are wonderful the second time around. Second, do NOT overlook them. Better to take them out early and let them cook up on their own. My family really enjoys this recipe.

Very good, and easy to put together. I followed another reviewer's advice about letting the bread crumbs soak in the milk before adding the meat and other ingredients - makes sense. The same reviewer's tip about using one's fingertips instead of rolling the meat paid off  resulting In a light meatball. Used Asiago cheese as I prefer It.

I added four cloves of minced garlic as we love garlic. I will decrease the red pepper a little as the heat was almost to much for our sauce. All in all, a very good tasting meatball! I want these in a big sub! Made these again and added 1/2 lb. Italian Sausage, doubled the Italian Seasoning and half of the red pepper...better than before...co-workers all wanted the recipe!

Outstanding Flavors, I used the full measure of flavorings and spices.    We loved this.      I will be more watchful with baking though, as 35 minutes, for 12 meatballs, at 400 degrees produced  very dry meatballs.  However flavorful.   Will absolutely make again.

This is fantastic. I have made this a few times and everyone loves it. If this is for an hors d'oeuvre, cut the milk back a little and add an egg.  When I make it as prescribed, they are losose which is fine for dinner or sandwiches but will not hold up to a toothpick.

I added Italian sausage, used whole milk, minced garlic, no hot
sauce or parmesan  cheese. I bought some real good romano
cheese and grated over meat balls when eating them on a
sandwich or spagetti,sooo good.

This wasn't *quite* meatball nirvana for us, but it was pretty close! I discovered my spice cabinet was in sad shape when I went to make these, but they still turned out pretty good! I never use real onions in anything, but especially not a meatloaf or meatball or anything like that because they just screw up the appearance and texture. So I used onion powder instead. I didn't have but maybe half of the suggested italian seasoning and I didn't have garlic salt, so just used regular garlic powder, and next time I'd skip the pepper flakes in favor of just regular cayenne. I had some serious doubts that they would stick together without eggs, but they did, sorta. I'm thinking some egg and oatmeal instead of bread crumbs next time would be a good addition. I tossed mine in the instant pot with a quick marinara from the skinnytaste website and pressured them for 10 or 15 minutes, and made them into meatball subs. If you do the same, make small meatballs (learn from my mistakes, people!) and don't be afraid to go heavy with the sauce. A quick trip under the broiler and they were pretty darn awesome!

These were good.  I had to triple the recipe and in the conversion must have added too much salt. Either that, or the amount of salt in the meatballs and then the sauce they were in created just too much of a salty flavor...so word of caution.  This is coming from a person who likes food salted generously.  I would use garlic powder versus garlic salt, depending on your sauce.

Great meatballs! I had a two pound package of 80/20, so I doubled everything, and they turned out. Good flavor, held together well, and they're really good with some homemade alfredo over the top. Will definitely make these again.

I really loved the Worcestershire flavor of these and my husband liked that they were a little bit spicy.  Mine came out just a little too onion laden for my taste.  I"ll probably swap out for onion powder next time.  Otherwise, i'll definitely make them again!

We make these all the time since finding this recipe.  They are full of flavor and moist.  We even made some and froze them to have on hand for whenever.  The seasonings can be played with a little.  There have been times we were out of one seasoning or another, and they were still great.

Very well seasoned and tasty. I paired with a BBQ and made a sub. I did sub 1 egg for the milk  and baked on 400 degrees for 15-20 minutes. Flavor seems like it would pair well with a variety of sauces. Thanks!

The recipe was easier than I had hoped and a big hit with my husband. I didn't have red pepper flakes so I added a little extra Frank's sauce. This made it have the perfect kick for 6/7 of my people. Children ages 15 months to 16 yeas loved it, but it was a tad too spicy for one of the 4 year olds. Easy fix

I loved the flavors. I did use an egg vs milk, just because I wanted a good binder. I used these for meatball sandwiches. I love that I can bake them. No flipping or turning. Just throw them in the oven and move on to the next part of the meal. Will use again!

Loved them.  Few changes because I was out of milk and bread crumbs.  Subbed one egg and 1/4 c half n half for milk and toasted (to dry it out) whole wheat bread for bread crumbs.  I had 1.5 lb pack of ground beef so increased recipe to 6 servings to adjust.  Made 11  2.5 inch meatballs (like bigger meatballs).  Hubby didn't even mind the kick.  Think next time I'll leave out hot sauce and use 3 lbs meat to freeze some.  Just served over pasta with jarred marina.  Picky teenager even gave up grilled chicken for 4 meatballs.  Hubby was looking for more.

This is very similar to my family's traditional meatball recipe. The only difference is I always add one egg to my meatballs to help keep them moist and bind them. Also my dad can't handle anything spicy, so he definitely wouldn't add red pepper or hot sauce, but I love the spicy kick it gives to this recipe. My husband and I make these all the time for spaghetti or sliders.

Yum. Cut the red pepper flakes in half for the kids, & it still had a good kick.  Thanks for the recipe.

One of my favorite recipes! I think it's better with the spices, but if you're like me and can't handle spicy foods, it's still really good without the red pepper and hot sauce. Really glad I found this one! I also usually skip the onion because I'm lazy and it's still good without it!

No onion, no pepper flakes or hot sauce, no worcestershire. And used an egg.  Probably should rewrite my own recipe but was looking to do one without using frozen.  Did not want them to be spicy.  Very good.   Cooked them in the convection oven on aluminum foiled pan-(spray it next time) at 425 for 13 minutes then dropped into sauce.

I didn't know what to make for dinner last night with my ground beef but I wanted something different and then I found this recipe. After I read the reviews I did substitute an egg for the milk  and because we don't care for hot foods I left out the hot sauce. Instead of baking them I simmered them in tomato sauce. They were amazing and got good reviews from my husband with the request that next time I add less pepper flakes(as I said we don't care for hot foods but for people that do by all means leave them in) I served them with pasta and garlic bread the left overs will make amazing meat ball sandwiches. Love this recipe five stars isn't enough!

Excellent meatballs. Based on other reviews, I used a 'meatloaf' mix of meat (beef,pork,veal) instead of just ground beef as it was available at the local market. No other changes. Made great meatball subs and also a fine addition to spaghetti sauce

I've followed this recipe three times always leaving out the milk. Today I decided to use almond milk in place of cow's milk to perform a little test. I had my reservations, but to my surprise and delight, the meatballs were superb! The milk gave them a nice soft inner consistency while having a crunchier outside due to baking. My taste-tester/hubby agrees that these are the best meatballs I've made.

I altered the amount of red pepper flakes to 1/2 a tsp - this had spice to it, but good enough for the kiddos. My two year old kept coming back for more with his pasta! These held up very well paired with Rao's marinara sauce, which is our favorite here. I do think it personally has a little too much oregano, so next time I'll reduce that. Other than that, these will be made again!

I used 2 eggs instead of milk, 1/2 onion instead of whole,  2 gloves of fresh minced garlic, and concocted my own Worcestershire sauce bc I didn't have any  at the moment (mixed soy sauce, dash of Maggi, TEENY bit of anchovy paste (1/4 of a dime size), couple dashes of fish sauce.), I've made this recipe a few times and this version was the best!! 

Enjoy!

These meatballs were great. I followed the recipe exactly except I did not use hot sauce & I turned the meatballs over half way through the baking time. I was pleasantly surprised with how they cooked up in the oven. (Usually I fry my meatballs.) Flavor was excellent with a nice kick from the red pepper flakes. Makes about 25  meatballs.

SUBS: I used 2 teaspoons of onion flakes instead of onion, because I didn't have onion at the time. I didn't have bread crumbs so I crushed standard soup oyster crackers. I used 3 teaspoons of Huy Fong chili garlic sauce as my hot sauce. I used chuck ground beef. (80% muscle/20% fat)

REVIEW: The meatballs were amazing. I tried one (or four, don't judge) about 3 minutes out of the oven and they were amazing. I expected them to not have much structural rigidity, but I was pleasantly surprised at how sturdy they were on their own. The texture is great and tasting the garlic and red chili flakes together really completed the experience. 

I made mine to be spicy, which is why I added the 3 teaspoons of  garlic chili sauce. I really loved how the sauce interacted with the flavors (no vinegar-y taste, added heat and tang), but at times it was overpowering. I if you were to use this sauce I would recommend only 1 teaspoon. Even if you like it spicy, it pays off to dial it back for the sake of retaining the garlic/herb flavor.

I love meatballs, but really good ones tend to be more intensive than what I want to do , These have ingredients that I already have on hand and are super easy. Then to top it off, these really taste good. These will become a regular on my dinner list.

These turned out very moist and flavorful.  I only made a couple of changes:  Added some dried celery leaves and used half ground beef and half sausage.  Used home-grown breadcrumbs with seasoned salt to compensate for the seasoned breadcrumbs in the recipe.  I'll serve with fettucine with broccoli one night and sweet chili sauce and stir fried veggies the next.

This was my first stab at homemade meatballs. Everyone in my house loved it. I might go a little lighter on the onion next time. But there will definitely be a next time.

Really delicious!  I used ground chicken and pork and made a meatloaf.  I was short on time.  It came out perfect and so yummy.  Nice change from the ordinary meatloaf or meatballs.

I took the suggestion of using the ricotta cheese instead of milk and I didn't have any crushes red pepper or hot sauce. Was good though, next time I want to experiment with fresh herbs instead of dried though. There was just something a tiny bit off in some bites. Is still make it again though.

I wanted meatballs for subs with marinara sauce and this was perfect in texture and taste. I should have diced the onion a bit smaller for the smaller meatballs. Baking is so much better than the mess of frying and greasy meatballs.  Next time I will make a double batch and freeze them. So good.

Loved these! I doubled the recipe using half lean ground beef and half ground pork. I was out of Worcestershire but found an online suggestion to substitute with soy sauce/vinegar/ground cloves. The mistake was doubling the red pepper flakes, too much!  I will make again but will half the red pepper.

I found the end product dry and lacking in flavor.  I agree with another review that  extra lean beef lacks the fat that I believe is needed in meatballs that I grew up with in my Italian home. I also agree that the meat should consist of pork and veal. I also think meatballs are best cooked in a tomato sauce, not in an oven.

Meatballs made with super lean ground meat taste like sawdust.  Fat is a crucial ingredient in any meatball. IMHO, 75% lean is the ideal amount of fat.  It used to be called "ground chuck".

Don't use garlic salt but use granulated garlic.  Simmer in Newman's Own Sockarooni sauce and you will knock them off their socks.  Great meatballs.

My family was not happy with these meatballs. I think I'll stick with the ground chuck recipe that has some flavor.  I just drain the fat when I'm done cooking but the chuck does impart good flavor. 1 dash of hot sauce does nothing whatsoever to a meatball recipe. Why put it there? I really wanted them to be great but won't make them again. The Worcestershire sauce sort of made them taste like sloppy joes.

I'm Italian and never heard of red pepper  and hot sauce in Italian meatballs.  My kids like pasta and meatballs.  Why would I serve them hot sauce.  I like flavorful but not hot.

I followed the directions for these meatballs, they were good, but not what I was looking for as a spaghetti topping.  To me, they tasted like meatloaf.  I think they would make for a great meat loaf recipe ;)

Very easy to make and delicious. I may have been a little "heavy-handed" on the hot sauce and the red chili flakes I used may have been a little spicier than usual because they came out a bit on the spicy side. They were a little to spicy for my nine-year-old daughter, but I loved them. Maybe next time, I'll substitute black pepper for the red pepper flakes and pay more attention when "splashing" on the hot sauce!

I used ground turkey since I didn't have beef kept almost all the ingredients, I used minced onions instead of a fresh one and reduced the time in the oven. They were great. I will make them again very soon

I used my pampered chef stoneware to cook these and that was fine. I followed the recipe exactly except i used liquid egg beaters instead of milk and threw in some extra breadcrumbs so it wouldnt be so wet. I teat tasted one meatball and thought it was full of flavor and not dried out. Seemed like a lot of yellow onion but thats okay. Mine are wrapped in saran wrap in the freezer for this weekend. Im gonna make meatballs in thebhawaiian rolls with mozzarella slices on top. I think its gonna be an awesome meal for snack, lunch or dinner. I'd def make these again b/c they were packed with flavor.

This is my favorite meatball recipe! I used an egg instead of milk just because I needed the milk for another recipe and the meatballs came out fine. I did sautéed the onions in butter first, because I don't like crunchy onions in cooked foods. Next time I will grate them because in my house, the finer and less noticeable the veggies, the better!

This is by far the best recipe for meatballs I've ever tried. My very picky fiance was in love with them. Only tweak was an egg instead of milk (out of milk). The meat is seasoned so well that I've paired it with the plainest sauce I can find to retain the taste. Absolutely perfect!!

Just made these with 1lb pork  1lb beef,  few dashes of hot sauce no hot peppers.  Diced onions very thin but think next time use onion powder instead as they are a bit of a pain. Used lactose free mozzarella in case Addie comes.  Used an egg instead of milk and gf bread crumbs.  Awaiting verdict.

DEFINITELY NOT MY FAVORITE. WONT MAKE AGAIN

These meatballs are amazing and take almost no time at all. They make around 16 if you do a medium size ball but are very good with spaghetti

I followed this to a T except I tripled it because I had a big crowd to cook for.  2 lbs 90% lean ground beef and 1 lb of ground pork.  And I didn't have italian seasoning so I just used equal amts of Parsley, Oregano and Basil.  went a little heavier on those than was said.  AWESOME juicy meatballs with a bit of zing.  YUM!

Fantastic!!  This is my new go-to recipe for meatballs.  We loved them as is but on subsequent times I've made them I've upped the red pepper flakes and hot sauce a bit....just because my son-in-law loves very spicy foods.  I always double this recipe and freeze some.  I've made with all ground beef and also combined ground beef with ground venison or ground bison.  Always delicious.

These meatballs turned out epically! I used 1/2 cup light ricotta instead of the milk, and they turned out so great. I have now included this recipe into my regular rotation. Thank you!!

I made a couple tweaks-- used 1/2 cup ricotta in place of the 1/3 cup milk; added an egg; reduced crushed red pepper flakes to 1/2 tsp, and substituted some cayenne pepper for the hot pepper sauce; used 3 small garlic cloves in place of garlic salt.  Also, blended all dry ingredients together before adding meat, then mixed by hand-- careful not to over-mix. Formed meatballs firm enough to hold together, but not too firm.

Sooooo good! My family loves them!  Only made a few changes because I wanted to double it & didn't have enough of some items. Used 1lb hamburger & 1lb sausage and used 1/3 cup milk with 1 egg (instead of doubling the milk).

I cooked the meatballs early in the day and then added the number I needed to my marinara sauce to warm up before dinner time. I served over linguine with a side salad and garlic bread fingers. My guests absolutely loved these meatballs and quickly asked for the recipe, which I proudly shared. I froze the leftover meatballs and will defrost as needed to add to more pasta sauce. This is a terrific recipe and you won't be disappointed!

these are awesome  my son loves them.  I browned them in a skillet,  poured the sauce on top, reduced heat, and cooked about 20 minutes.  My son said they are better than Subways meatball sandwiches.  I bought hoagie rolls for them.

Swapped the skim milk with ricotta and it was amazing, found it to be VERY spicy though, reduced the red pepper flakes to 1/4 tsp and added a couple more hot sauce dashes, tastes miles better than anything you'd find in a restaurant and goes so well with sweet tomato sauces.

Very good!  I baked 2 gf everything bagels until they were dry -- about 300 degrees for roughly 30 min.  Then put them in the food processor until crumbs.  I used nutritional yeast for the Parmesan but used only about 1/3 c. instead of a half (for a doubled recipe).  Also, the mixture seemed quite dry so I ended up adding 1/4 c. milk.  I think 2 T. would have been enough.  also used ground cayenne, about 1/2 tsp. and siracha for the hot sauce, about 1/2 tsp.  both were a good amount.  Wouldn't want them more spicy.  Scooped with the 1 1/2" diameter cookie scoop and then made them into balls.  I ended up with 51.  Done at 20 minutes.

Made recipe as stated: Convection oven at 400 took 15 minutes. Moist, good texture and balance of seasoning. However, next time I will omit the additional oregano since the Italian season mix has it. I will also use minced fresh garlic instead of garlic salt (personal preference). I will also go back to my normal way of mixing the meatballs, by making a well of seasonings, breadcrumbs, and milk in the center of meat,  letting the breadcrumbs absorb for 5 minutes, then gently mixing the meat in...this seems to give a slightly better texture to the balls.  Over mixing causes dense meatballs.

Flavorful and tender bites of heaven! I omitted the red pepper flake because I didn't have any. Also my package of ground meat was a little big so I added an egg and only used a splash of milk. We made meatball subs out them topped with seasoned tomato sauce and mozzarella. Will definitely make again!!

I've been making these for years and they are a favorite amongst friends and family. I always use 2 lbs of lean ground turkey and double the seasoning measurements. I never use skim milk and they come out perfectly fine. Also, instead of the Italian seasoning I use "Jane's Krazy MixedUp Seasoning" and I use Italian seasoned breadcrumbs instead of regular. Sometimes I'll stuff mozzarella in the middle for an added element of surprise    for dinner guests.

What can I say except these were wonderful! I made exactly as written and I wouldn't change a thing! Served with a parm-Romano based tomato sauce and spaghetti noodles and it was great! These meatballs are versatile and I could've done anything with them. The kicker is they were so simple I would leave my kids to make them. For real. Me the cooking control freak would walk out and leave either one to it :)

This is a quick and easy way to make meatballs when all you have is burger.  The only thing I didn't use was the red pepper flakes.

These meatballs are soo good! I liked them so much that I made them into a meatloaf the second time and added 1 pound of Jimmy Dean sausage. My whole family wolfed down the meatballs and begged for them again.

I follows the recipe as directed.  I thought the Italian and oregano were a bit strong so next time I will omit oregano completely.  Also a good tip is to either cook the onions prior or mince them before adding to the meat mixture.  I used a 1/8 measuring cup and was able to make about 28 meatballs. After baking I let it simmer in a sauce for a few minutes, put them on a bun, added cheese and popped it in the oven for a few mins to make subs!  Good recipe overall!

These turned out super onion-y. I used a small onion and diced it all up, but geez. It was a bit overpowering and took away from the overall taste of the meatballs. These are not very firm either. I assume using eggs instead of milk would help that. That isn't a deal breaker for me but I can only give 4 stars because it would have been a lot better if I had subbed powdered onion instead!

Good meatballs that you don't have to cook in a skillet. They are a little reminiscent of meatloaf, but still good.

My husband loved these meatballs and called me a cooking Goddess. My meatballs were stuffed with small balls of mozzerella in the middle. 
Like Italian Tapas Cook,  I used lean hamburger and ground pork.
We were  out of eggs and worchestire so I used Stubbs BBQ,
A1 sauce and pepper was the additional spice all the rest of the ingredients I kept the same.

This was a decent recipe, but there were too many strong  flavors for me to really enjoy it. I like to taste the meat more. Not a kid friendly taste for sure... even omitting the hot sauce and halving the red pepper, I had 4 kids over who complained about the spiciness and didn't like the flavor.

OMG!  Yummy. I added 1 egg, coated/rolled in fine grated Parmesan cheese and BAM!  I actually tested with and without grated Parmesan coating and like them better with it. Lined Cookie sheet with foil and sprayed lightly with Pam to prevent sticking.  Best I ever had.

Great recipe - I have made this once before as recommended and it was wonderful. This time I realized I had no Worcestershire sauce at home so I had to substitute something instead....I used mesquite liquid smoke (the stuff you use in bbq) and it was DELICIOUS

This was fantastic. I had to make it gluten-free so I subbed ground oats for the bread crumbs. And in place of the onion I used onion powder. Other than that I stayed to recipe and we couldn't have enjoyed it more.

Love this one! made it as written the first time, came out fantastic. Made it with 1/2 lb ground beef and 1/2 lb ground pork the second time, came out fantastic. Made it with 1/2 lb ground beef and 1/2 lb ground sausage meat the third time, and that was the winner for my family! I make it with the "Worlds Best Pasta Sauce" recipe, and we have enough to put in the freezer. Heats up GREAT!

These meatballs are absolutely the best. The only change I made was to double the recipe using one pound ground beef and one pound ground pork. And I'm so glad that I doubled it because these won't last anytime at my house.  Thanks for a truly great recipe!

Used my judgement using the ingredients leaving out hot sauce and peppers due to dietary requirements. Could have  added more breadcrumbs but the Meatball's were nice and moist with good  flavor. Great no egg recipe!

I thought these were very good.  I substituted ricotta cheese for the skim milk because  I didn't have milk (no more kiddos at home!) but I did have ricotta cheese as another reviewer recommended to use.

The recipe as written is great.

To mix it up with a little variation try this:
(leaves them a little more seasoned)

skip the salt and milk
+ 1 healthy sized shredded carrot
+ 1/4 c finely diced green pepper
+ 3/4 c pizza sauce 
    (mine was left over homemade)
+ 1/4 c or so extra breadcrumbs but leave very moist

glass baking dish works better than foil (even oiled) since they stick a tiny bit  to foil

These really are meatball nirvana!  We make these often using  half pork and half beef as some of the other reviews have suggested.    They are always a hit with everyone there.    We have them as appetizers and provide a variety of dipping sauces such as maranaira, BBQ, honey mustard, and hot sauces and people eat them right up.   One of my favorite apps

Good but next time I'd probably leave out the Italian seasoning. I didn't care much for the flavor that it added, just personal taste. I didn't have Worcestershire sauce so I had to do without, otherwise everything else was done the same. One of the other reviewers said that these were too dense. Well, you did something very wrong because the texture is spot on.

As with some others, I used an egg in place of the milk, added Italian seasoning to the bread crumbs, even forgot the onions one of the times and everything tasted great.

Awesome! The only change I made was I used dried minced onion and soaked it in the milk first. I would cut down, or eliminate, the red pepper since we just aren't a spicy food family. Otherwise, the seasonings are perfect, don't be afraid there is too much, as I first did. It is a perfect blend.

This is my go to Meatball recipe now.  We love it.  We are from New Orleans so we like a little "kick" in our meals.  This recipe has just enough!  My daughter LOVES meatballs so I usually triple the recipe and freeze a few meals for her.  I triple the recipe because I like to use 1 pound ground beef, 1 pound ground pork and 1 pound ground veal.  I also use fresh herbs.  Other than those two changes, I make it exactly as written and have not found a better recipe yet!!!  Thanks!!!

Very good!  Made these for the "meatball grinders with a yummy sauce" recipe on this site. 
Doubled the recipe, didn't add salt, made own bread crumbs (buttered 4 slices of bread and cooked at 250 degrees for 40 minutes or so), less than1/4 tsp. of red pepper (wasn't spicy at all) cos of the heat intolerant kids, and no hot sauce.   I added a little extra Italian seasoning To compensate for the unseasoned bread crumbs but next time I won't add extra.   Cooked them for 10 minutes on each side then put them in a crockpot with the meatball grinder sauce on low for about 2 hours then on medium for 2ish hours.  Next time I will just keep it on low cos they seemed kinda dry even though it was in sauce.

Made a double batch, added 2 eggs instead of milk and 3/4 cup of bread crumbs. The best meatballs I have ever made!

These were fantastic! My kids loved them and continue to ask for them. They didn't even mind the kick from the crushed red pepper.

These are really excellent. Texture, flavor and ease are fantastic. Only thing you might want to change is the amount of red pepper flakes. That much spice isn't something I'd normally

These are deeeeeelish.  I only had almond milk and wasn't sure that would work as well so I subbed in an egg instead but the rest followed as directed and they came out really well.  served with marinara in a sub roll, we will definitely be using this recipe again!

A-Mazing. I have been using this recipe for a few years now, and multiply the recipe by 4-5 or even 7 times so I always have some in the freezer ready for a lazy night.  My picky eaters gobble it up.

The flavor is great but the onions are crunchy! I am not a big fan of crunchy onions in my meatballs.  I only used half of an onion and there was still too much onion.  I dunno what I did wrong. I followed the recipe, with the exception of using beef and pork, milk and ricotta.  Maybe I will sauté the onion next time.

Easy recipe with excellent results!   These are some of the most tender, moist and flavorful meatballs I have ever had!  The only change I made was using cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs, as I forgot to buy breadcrumbs at the store.  the results were delicious!  I cannot believe how moist the meatballs were,  even without the egg thar many other recipes call for.

Baked the meatballs as directed and then added the cooked meatballs to a good quality jarred marinara sauce.  Served them with  hair and a bit of fresh basil.  Delicious!

I would suggest doubling  (or tripling) the recipie so you can make ahead and freeze.  I did not do so this time, but will definitely do next time!

Fabulous! I used ground venison, and I didn't have milk, so added a splash of almond milk instead. That worked just fine. I  had issue with getting the onion chopped small enough. I think next time I'll send it through the food processor. I also found it a bit salty, so I think next time I'll use a little more sea salt and garlic powder instead of garlic salt. Even then, these are the best meatballs I've ever made!

Amazingly good meatballs. I switched up some things just because of what I had available, I used sriracha and soy sauce instead of  the hot sauce and worcestershire. I also omitted the salt because between all the added sauces and parmesan, I didn't want to kill myself with salt. They were still amazing and extremely flavorful. You can eat these are they are  or add them to your meatball recipes. I made soup in the slow cooker and they flavored the entire soup perfectly.

I have used this recipe twice. the first time I followed as written and wasn't a huge fan of the texture. It just didn't give me that family, home feeling I was looking for out of spaghetti and meatballs. They reminded me more of store bought. 
The second time I diced onion and garlic, used a salt free herb mixture plus the listed spices. I also used lamb and a tiny bit of ground pork. The texture was significantly better. 
All in all the flavor of this recipe is good. Just thought the texture needed some fixing.

I'm not sure how these were supposed to taste, but they didn't taste like meatballs :(  I cut the oregano down to 1/2 tsp and used saltines instead of seasoned bread crumbs, and still all I could taste was the seasoning.

I liked the flavor, but was a bit overkill on the seasoning. While I'm not terribly picky, this would probably be way too salty for most people. Thought I maybe got some of the ingredients/portions wrong (many similar negative reviews tell me this is probably not the case). Still think it could be decent...might try again in the future with lowered seasoning amounts.

This recipe was absolutely delicious!! This is one I will be using again. I grew up in an Italian family and we have a "secret sauce" recipe that I usually just add meat to, but I wanted to start trying some good meatball recipes. This was a hit with my picky husband!!

I only rated it 4 stars because I felt there was a bit too much onion, and I used veal instead of ground beef. I also was out of worshteshire, and substituted a smaller amount of soy sauce so that I wouldn't get an Asian flavor. The consistency was tender and SO moist, and the bake time & temp was perfect. Unless you absolutely love onion, I would suggest only using half a small one. It added a whole new flavor to my traditional spaghetti & meat sauce recipe. Will be making for a long time!

Very good. Used the suggestion of one reviewer to use half hambuger and half Italian sausage and ricotta cheese for the milk. Didn't use hot sauce cause I don't like things very spicy.

My whole family loved these! They usually hate meatballs but I took a chance and it paid off yay! Next time I'll leave out the hot sauce because my 2 year old didn't like the spiciness, but aside from that they were a complete hit! Thanks for the recipe!

This is a very easy and basic recipe for meatballs. The pros: easy, not many ingredients, keeps its shape, oven baked (healthy). Cons: no depth in flavor you get from addition of ground pork or turkey, too much breaking

These meatballs were excellent, and I don't easily impress with meatballs. They weren't too dry, or mushy. The Italian seasoning spice that I made myself but added following the recipe gave it great flavor. I will definitely make these again. The leftovers were eaten as a snack before I could even use them in a meal again! Loved by all. Thanks for the great recipe.

I double the recipe and went with one of the reviewers suggestions and used half beef and half pork, I also used one egg and 1/3 cup milk (again based off of reviews). 
They turned out yummy, the only thing I will change next time is that I will leave half of the meatballs without the red pepper flakes & hot sauce bc these were definitely a little much for my 2 year old to handle.

Loved this meatball recipe.  Very easy.  We skipped the red pepper flakes and hot sauce, but otherwise made no changes.  We found the spices to be just right, and liked the dense consistency very much.

Great easy meatballs. Very few dishes to clean. It's nice to spice them up with more red pepper. Not too bready.  Juussst right.

You can't make good meatballs without using ground pork along with the beef. A little veal wouldn't hurt either.

My son found this recipe and asked me to make the recipe. OMG, these meatballs are stupendous! They're easy to make, the ingredients are those on-hand, too, which makes it better. He and I demolished all of the meatballs. I highly recommend this recipe!

This is one of my favorite recipes. I include shredded mozzarella or provolone, in addition to the Parmesan.  I usually make the meatballs a bit larger and serve them on subs. I also generally bake them for only 20 minutes, as I despise overcooked beef. Some days I will prepare the mixture and store them in the refrigerator while I'm at work. Then, my husband preheats the oven and bakes them so that they're ready when I get home. (I run an afterschool program and don't get home until 9:00pm some nights.)

Great recipe, thanks. I did modify it, because I wanted to use some fresh parsley, coriander, basil and garlic I had in the refrigerator. I chopped the ingredients and mixed them into the ground beef. Otherwise I followed the instructions.

My husband said these were the best meatballs he's ever had. I think he ate like 15 meatballs with our meal! I made spaghetti using the "fresh tomato marinara sauce" recipe that I found on here which is also delicious! Everyone loved these meatballs so much!

I was kinda  surprized about all the great reviews. My husband was not impressed at all, he told me to stick with the way I usually make meatballs. They were good but not great........maybe I'll add italian sausage next time and not put milk in them.

So elderson doesn't like pasta, my youngest son loves spaghetti.  This recipe is the solution.  Three of these bad boys on a french roll with mozzarella and sauce draped over and elderson is happy ("OMG, best meatball sandwich ever") and youngest son is loving the spaghetti and meatballs.

The recipe is solid as stands, the meatball has an amazing range of flavors that take the diner on an adventure with each bite.  I will be making these again real soon.

Only recommendation is to watch the salt. First batch, I followed the recipe almost exactly (egg instead of milk) but it was a little too salty for our taste but still outstanding. Second batch, just used less salt and still outstanding.

I usually don't measure ingredients often so I can't rate on measurements. I did not have some items on hand since it was a last minute find, so I substituted. No milk (can never keep it in this house with my kids ??) so I used 2 whole eggs , kosher salt instead of sea salt, garlic powder instead of garlic salt, I did not have worcestershire, I used crystals hot sauce and I used Italian bread crumbs. I followed everything else as directed and they were so yummy!!! My family loved them! Very moist meatballs. I was told they were better than my usual haha so this will definitely be placed in my recipe box! Thank you!

I decided to give them a go after reading these positive reviews and I'm glad I did. I adjusted the recipe to 10 servings (made approximately 85-90 meatballs) to bring to a potluck.  These meatballs have been added to my favourites. They are perfectly moist and tasty even without a sauce.  A keeper for sure. Thanks for sharing!

Although I made some substitutions the recipe was too soft for me and had to add more starch to hold it's shape. Also found them overly salty.

These are good, but I strongly recommend you do not use ground turkey with this recipe.  I've tried beef and they came out excellent, just go easy on the oregano and I substituted cayenne for hot sauce.  

The turkey ones came out terrible, they are bland.  If you go the turkey route, double your spices.

These were good but I wish I had seen the review where the person grated the Onion.  I made these meatballs on the smaller side and the chunks of onion were a little overpowering. That being said these are NOT your grandmother's Italian meatballs. So while they were tasty they aren't something I'd serve with pasta they sort of taste like meatloaf.

These were great! I did however omit the hot sauce and only used half of the red pepper because my kids don't like spicy food. Besides changing that, the plates were licked clean. Definitely a keeper!

Excellent.  Only thing I did different was to use garlic powder in place of garlic salt and onion pwd (1 tsp) instead of onion.  As someone else mentioned,  mix with fingertips (kind of stirring around bowl) without squishing the meat together.  Otherwise the meatballs tend to be dense and dry.  Excellent flavor.

Doubled recipe and made 16 large meatballs. Didn't put anything hot In. Used garlic salt, but no salt and less oregano because oregano is in the Italian seasoning. Added a tea of basil instead.  Really great for spaghetti.


Note to self: use half meat 90% and ground pork and  1/2 + 1/2. Cook for 20 minutes.

I like the recipe because it's egg free, have grandchildren with allergies. I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I used an Italian blend from Penzeys Spices that it wonderful. I also made the meatballs mini size & work out great. I will make again.

We made a huge batch of these meatballs and they came out great. Our first time making meatballs and now it won't be the last. The only thing I would change is to maybe  use less or no red pepperflakes. One of my 3 children didn't care for the heat it had. We used this in spaghetti one night and used some that we reserved and froze for meatballs subs another night.

This is a great recipe.  My first big tip is to NOT use the sea salt.  use NO salt because the hot sauce has plenty of salt already in it and the first time I made these they were too salty to eat.  I also listened  to a few others and used eggs instead of milk.  Those are my only changes.  I baked them on parchment paper on a cookie sheet.  Really really delicious.  Thanks so much for posting.

These are the best meatballs hands down that only use beef rather than a beef and pork mixture.  Very quick and easy to make.  My wife doesn't like anything hot or spicy so I left out the  peppers and hot sauce.  Once the meatballs are done cooking in the oven I then transfer them to a pot of marinara and simmer them for an additional 20-25 minutes just to boost the flavor even more.  My wife absolutely loves these.  The recipe makes enough for a couple of dinners for just two.  We had meatball sandwiches and then spaghetti and meatballs the next evening with the leftovers.  This will be my go to recipe for meatballs from now on.

They were pretty good, but they tasted less like meatballs and more like meatloaf (even with red sauce and bunch of spices). If I ever want mini meatloafs, I know the recipe to turn to. 
Pro: Pretty tasty, easy enough to make.
Con: Not exactly a meatball, more like a meatloaf.

I used larger portions of all the ingredients. Mixed Sausage and beef. Instead of bread crumbs used 1 egg and instead of regular sweet chili , I used a pepper sauce from home(Africa), not sure you can find it in stores...to retain moisture I foiled the meatballs while baking.
My boyfriend can't stop raving( the excited meaning) about these, and he loves to snack on them.

Definitely, a keeper...(the recipe), and him:-)

Excellent meatballs....the family loved them.  I doubled the recipe.  I used 2 TBSP minced onion instead of onion, minced dried garlic instead of garlic salt, 2 eggs instead of milk, 2 TSP sweet smoked paprika, 2 TSP hot smoked paprika, 2 TSP dried basil instead of 'Italian seasoning', garlic cholula as the 'hot sauce',  1/4 TSP red savina (pepper) plus 1 small jar pesto.

These were simple to make and had a great taste if you like SPICY. I made two batches. One with ground beef and one with ground turkey.  Both were very good but it was way to hot for me personally. I did omit the  hot sauce in both meats. I did cut the red pepper flakes down to 1/4 teaspoon.
One reviewer referred to these as "meat loaf" I kind of agree but they were good and I'd make them again but would cut out the red pepper flakes.

Made it exactly like the recipe but left out the hot sauce (because I didn't have any). My family loved them!  My husband said they were the best meatballs he has ever eaten ( he's 65 so he's eaten a lot of meatballs!  I doubled the recipe and froze a dozen uncooked to make later.  The best thing was cooking them in the oven-- then just added them to a pot of sauce . Thanks

I made two batches. One using beef and the other using ground chicken. The changes I made, similar to others, were an egg in place of the milk, and I used about 1/4 cup panko bread crumbs.  They both tasted good but the chicken are my favorite. They were more tender and moist and just seemed to have a better flavor even though I made them the same.

I followed the recipe as is twice and my entire family LOVES it! I like the idea of adding ricotta instead of skim milk and I will add a pinch more red pepper next time, but that's just our taste. Fantastic as is!

These were really good! I never have breadcrumbs so I always use oatmeal. I stuck it in the food processor for a few pulses and added some ground flaxseed. I was skeptical about it not using an egg but these turned out great! Kids loved them! They were good leftover the next day, too!

I made this recipe because I wanted a protein with spaghetti and I had the ingredients on hand. I had to look for a recipe with rave reviews because my husband does not like meatballs and I was just hoping he'd eat them. Amazing results! Yes, they're spicy, but they were so good my husband ate them alone! WHAT?!?!? I've been married 27 years and this is a first. They were even better the next day. On day two, made some beef gravy and served with mashed potatoes. Crazy versatile. Taking the advice of reviewers, I mixed up the bread crumbs and fluids separately and then added to the meat mixture. I also baked them in a muffin tin. We'll be making these again. Thank you so much for a great recipe.

I like this recipe,  and it's easy to modify if you have some dietary restrictions or missing ingredients.   I substituted A1 steak sauce for the Worcestershire sauce , and used Almond milk.  The precise amount for the onions is a mystery to me, need to experiment a little more to make it right.

Just ok, they were nothing mind blowing and I found them a touch dry. Taste was good but I would ease up on the oregano next time. My daughter did however eat TEN of them lol and she thinks they're fantastic.

I accidentally left the onions out other than that I did not change a thing and they were so yummy. The red pepper flakes is what elevated these meatballs. I am making them the recipe again today only I'm putting it into a meatloaf pan  because  I feel it's the same exact thing  but instead of balls it's a loaf , absolutely love this recipe  !!

Perfect seasonings! We made a low-carb version with eggs instead of milk and pork rind crumbs instead of breadcrumbs. I left out the spicy ingredients. I made a ton at once (5lbs beef) and it was easy.

This is a very good recipe. Over time, I've made some changes but the base recipe is great. The two changes I've always made are substituting onion powder for the onion (we don't like onions) and using gluten free breadcrumbs because my husband has Celiac Disease. Other things I've done as I continue to make this include: using garlic powder and a bit more salt instead of garlic salt, using unseasoned breadcrumbs or using 1/3 amount seasoned and 2/3 unseasoned (so the flavoring doesn't overwhelm my sauce), using freshly made hot sauce from our own home-grown peppers (and a bit more to make them spicier) and using freshly granted genuine parmesan. Also, using whatever dairy milk you have (skim or more fat) will not affect the recipe. I prefer them with these changes BUT I think you will enjoy the recipe as rated. These are the only kind I make and my family far prefers them to the pre-made frozen kind, gluten free or with gluten.

Holy meatballs! So, these are the most amazing meatballs I have ever eaten in my life. HOWEVER, I made one really important change. Instead of just ground beef, I made it with half ground beef and half bulk ground pork sausage. Because the sausage has a kick of its own, I left out the crushed red peppers. Mainly because I have a toddler and a four year old I needed to eat these. ;) Otherwise the crushed red peppers probably could have stayed if you like spicy. I also used gluten-free bread crumbs. These did stick terribly to the foil covered baking sheet I used and that did annoy me. I doubled the recipe so I had to do it in two batches. I realized I forgot to coat the foil in oil to prevent sticking the first time so I did it well the second time but they still stuck. :( I think next time I will turn them halfway through and along with oiling the foil first that ought to fix the problem. Regardless, we were all fighting over these meatballs and they went so fast! I was so pleased and amazed that my usually picky toddler was actually happily destroying them! And he ate at least two at a time every time I heated some up for us for the few days they were around. :D That's a lot of meatball for a little guy who isn't even two yet. In fact, on the last reheated serving of them, my toddler ate all that I gave him and tried to take my husband's and it is literally the first time I have ever seen him refuse to share his dinner with his kid when solicited for some of his food. Haha!

Tripled recipe with 1/3 each of ground hamburg, veal & pork.  Omitted hot sauce that I did not have on hand.  Subbed fresh mix of oregano, basil & parsley I had instead of dried Italian seasoning/oregano.  Came out fantastic!.  Not too spicy at all -  I'll have to try again with hot sauce.  Also, put a little nugget of provolone cheese in middle for added surprise.  Great recipe!

I first cook the diced onions on the stove top to get them a nice golden brown. I also like to add mushrooms, bell peppers, and fresh parsley or Rosemary.

First time making meatballs. Tried this recipe because of the high ratings. Only didn't use one ingredient because I didn't have any hot sauce. Other than that followed exactly. They turned out great. Everyone love them . Thanks for the recipe.

There are 3 things that I love about this recipe. 1st is that I had all the ingredients on hand with the exception of the skim milk and I just replaced that with an egg. 2nd It was so very easy to make. 3rd they were delicious with just the right amount of spice. This is my favorite meatball recipe yet!

I made these meatballs almost exactly as the recipe called for. I didn't have oregano or hot sauce so I didn't use them, but didn't really need them for my taste anyway.  The recipe was quick and easy and doesn't have too many ingredients. I also liked that you cook them in the oven so you don't have to stand at the stove and keep turning them! They came out great! I will definitely make them again. Next time I'll cut the Italian seasoning in half though and add a little less milk. Thanks for the recipe!

We followed the recipe to a "T" and they came out great!!!  Next time we will use a little less onion since we doubled and used 1 really large onion and a pinch less hot sauce.  Can't wait to put these on a sub roll!!

These are the best meatballs I have ever made.  I didn't have italian seasoning so i used oregano and I had a mccormick spaghetti sauce dry seasoning that i put in there instead.  I also baked them at 350 rather than 400 and they took less than 20 min. Watch them so they don't burn.  And, i adjust the salt to my taste.  I like meatballs to have enough salt so i used a bit more.  I will absolutely make these again.  I took them to a picnic today and they were a a big hit.

Absolutely great. These were the best meatballs I have ever made in my life and I have made a lot. I used ground sirloin in the recipe. I didn't have skim milk so I used whole milk. I made the meatballs in the early afternoon and put them in a bowl and drizzled some red sauce on them. I put them in more sauce to heat them up for dinner and they were very moist and tender.

I couldn't find seasoned breadcrumbs, so I used a packet of Italian seasoned coating mix for chicken. Because of this switch-up, I found the meatballs a tad salty, but otherwise yummy. I MAY have left them in the oven a little longer than necessary because the bottoms were a little over-browned, so I WILL make these again, but if I use the coating mix again, I will reduce or eliminate the sea salt, plus I will take them out of the oven after 20 minutes baking, instead of the 25 or 30 minutes I baked them for this time! Practice makes perfect!

One dash of Frank's doesn't cut it. I find Frank's to be rather mild. So add as much as you want.

I used what I had in the pantry for 1.5 lbs ground beef, so garlic powder instead of garlic salt, 1/2 tsp or so onion powder instead of a small onion, had basil so added 3/4 tsp because I didn't have Italian seasoning,  and added a sprinkle of ground red pepper instead of crushed. What was left went per recipe.  Yield was 25 golf ball sized meatballs.  Great flavor!  This will be my go to recipe from now on! Thanks for sharing.

First- Best meatballs for anything, but especially spaghetti! Second- I followed the recipe exactly but added one step. I caramelized  the  onion in olive oil for a few minutes before adding to the meat mixture.  I prefer it this way because it makes them softer and adds flavor.

Omg!!!! These were beyond delicious. My boyfriend told me they were the best meatballs he has ever tasted. I didn't not have skim milk and use ricotta cheese instead as another reviewer suggested. I don't think it could have turned out better. They were extremely moist and tender. YUMMY!!!

We have an egg allergy in the family and these meatballs are the first ones I've tried without egg that are outstanding! I'll never put an egg in meatballs again. I've substituted ground turkey and it's still delicious.

"Fabulous" is hubby's description. Used gluten-free breadcrumbs and 2/3 of the pepper flakes to accommodate his dietary restrictions and preferences. Going to combine with the Marinara Sauce recipe by Ealeanor 1052 for dinner, and tripled the recipe for freezing extras.  My only suggestion would be to bake them on parchment paper - the pans are hell to clean!

I made this tonight and they were delicious!! I didn't have onion or milk so I used onion powder and an egg and they turned out great! I cooked them on a sprayed cookie sheet and for about 28 minutes (flipping half way through) and they had a nice crisp on the outside! Will definitely make again!

Substituted turkey for beef, just for the hell of it. I also added about 2/3 of a cup of bread crumbs instead of a 1/2 cup. And I also put a chunk of mozzarella cheese in the center. Yum!

I got a little heavy handed with the seasoning, but these were still really good. I did add 1 lb of mild sausage. I might go with hot sausage and leave out the red pepper next time.

I used these for meatball subs, with marinara and mozzarella. I turned my back for a few minutes and almost didn't get any! I followed the recipe pretty closely, but the mix was a bit dry. I threw in an egg and it was perfect!

I made this recipe as is for the most part, omitting the hot sauce and putting slightly less than the recommended amount of crushed red pepper.  That was purely so my kids wouldn't complain about the level of spiciness!  The meatballs turned out fantastic and I will definitely make these again and again!!

Mmmm! These meatballs were fantastic! I used 1lb of ground beef and 1lb of ground sausage and substituted the milk for ricotta cheese. Then I doubled the remaining ingredients. These were so moist and juicy! The flavors were amazing! I paired these meatballs with the "Chunky Marinara Sauce" recipe found on this site. Perfection!

Just made these & i really like them. I didn't have any hot sauce or red pepper flakes, but they were still really good. I think next time I will cut down the Italian seasoning and oregano a little but I'll definitely make these again. Thanks for posting!

Loved it!!  Very tasty and flexible to what you have on hand and preferences.  I had milk but seldom have it and an egg would work as well.  I seldom have seasoned breadcrumbs but they too can be made.  The thing that surprised me the most was the red pepper flakes,  Frank's Red Hot sauce and the Worchestershire sauce really made the difference.  Will make again and try them in a meatball sandwich.  Grandkids loved them too.

Delicious.. Meatballs came out fluffy and light. I used half ground beef and half pork, and substituted dried thyme for the Italian seasoning. They were very flavorful!

I made this in the slow cooker, strained it then added tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese. It is great for any bring-a dish gathering... serve with small hoagie rolls for meatball parm sandwiches on the go.  It is a favorite! Oh and I have even made it with half beef and half turkey..... just as delicious!

The meatballs were so good that even using a really great canned sauce, the pasta and meatballs passed the husband taste test.  I would serve this to guests with a great bread and salad without a second thought.  Soooo good.

I made meatballs w/ 1/2 beef and 1/2 pork, and used Ricotta cheese rather than w skim milk as one user suggested.  Awesome and very moist.  My family loves them.

This is now my go to recipe for meatballs. Everyone loves it. I do use an egg instead of milk and sometimes throw in some fresh herbs instead of dried. I also use plain bread crumbs instead of Italian. There are plenty of spices in this recipe already. Delicious meatballs!

I love this recipe!  I always use cheese crackers and an egg which I omitted in this recipe.  I browned them then put them in the slow cooker with a jar of spaghetti sauce.  I'll probably make more next time and freeze them.  Marilyn

I made this recipe with veal/pork/beef mixture, but with no other changes. By far the BEST meatballs I have ever made.  I couldn't wait to try them when they came out of the oven.  Thank you.

At first glance I thought "Franks hot sauce in meatballs?" But I made them non the less. They were stupendous! I did leave out the red pepper flake as I was out of them.  They came out soft and tasty! I highly recommend them!

1st time making meatballs, this recipe is great (I took another reviewer's advice and swapped the milk for ricotta). Also used a meatball blend, not just ground beef. Will definitely be using this recipe again!

It was okay -- I won't make it again though.  It was maybe too moist, and maybe had a little too much oregano.  Also I thought there was too much onion.

I skipped on the Frank's and pepper flakes. I swapped breadcrumbs for panko and I swapped Italian seasoning for basil, sage and rosemary. I also used half extra lean ground beef with half ground pork and I used one egg.

I've made this recipe probably about 5 times now after finding it. It's my go-to meatball recipe. Easy, quick and tastes amazing. Every bite has the slightest kick from the chili flakes and the hot sauce, which both my roommate and I love. They're not just bland balls of meat. They can definitely stand alone on flavor! I always use the meatball/meatloaf mix for this. I also make sure to mince the onions really fine or I grate them on a box grater. Fantastic recipe! Thank you.

This was yummy even though I was out of Worcester sauce so didn't use any and I was out of milk so I used half and half!

Really enjoyed the flavor.   I like spicy but others in the house don't so I help back on the hot sauce and red pepper flakes.   I did use some and it did add a kick.   Next time I might just add a little more.   I made the meatballs a little bigger then swedish meatballs and they came out great.   Will save this one for sure

Best meatballs ever!!! I'll make them with pasta and no one will eat the pasta anymore. Serve as main dish now. I pan fry with little oil, onion powder instead of whole, and when nice and brown on each side I finish by simmering in favorite spaghetti sauce. Always a hit!!

This is my go to recipe for meatballs! Really enjoy it. Now if you are sensitive to parmesan or don't want that flavor to be prominent, then either use a little less or use shredded parmesan instead. Or use fresh. The flavor can be overpowering sometimes.

Good meatballs! My kids ate them without any complaining! I did not add any red pepper flakes and did not add any cheese. Great tasting with spaghetti.

I grated onion (bf doesn't like onion), and I did not have any hot sauce so I used some ghost pepper salt. Nice change from the same old Italian meatballs I make.

I made this last night with gluten free breadcrumbs and a 1.5 lb of beef mixed with 1 lb of mild Italian sausage and it turned out fantastic.  Everyone loved them even my non gluten free kids/husband and it made enough to freeze some (I double the recipe to accommodate my extra meat).

Excellent !  I browned them for about 10 minutes in the oven and then simmered them in the spaghetti sauce for about an hour.  So tender.

Superb! 
I did cut back the red pepper flakes to 1/4 teaspoon, otherwise followed recipe exactly. Perfect amount of heat for me. This could very well be the best meatballs I've ever eaten, loaded with flavor!

Followed the recipe exactly and the flavors were good but the meatballs came out too dry. I think I'll try to make them bigger than the suggested size and cook them in a covered cast iron skillet next time to try to retain some moisture. A bit too spicy for my kids though.

I made these as written with the exception of using less red pepper flakes, I used 1/4 tsp as there are RPF's in my Italian spice mix.  To me the texture is a bit odd, much like a frozen meatball.  I don't see the point of mixing most of the ingredients and then adding in the milk, cheese and breadcrumbs and mixing again. Ground beef should be mixed only to combine the ingredients, over mixing creates a dense, tough meatball.  I think that they would benefit from fresh garlic and some parsley.

These meatballs were delicious. I did make a couple changes. I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I was generous with the Worcestershire sauce and Italian seasoning. I used plain Panko bread crumbs. I also added a generous tbsp of Sambal Oelek chili paste. Instead of milk, I used half and half. And finally, I used ground turkey instead of beef. I was very pleased with the result. Husband loved them so much, he didn't want any sauce.

Looking for something a bit different, I decided to try this version instead of my standard "go-to" recipe that my mother used to make.  Mom always added an egg to her meatball mixture and chopped fresh parsley. I made this as written.  The flavor is pretty good, but the texture wasn't to my liking.   Next time, I'm going back to adding an egg and the freshness of the parsley.

Used half pork half beef and it turned out great.  Definitely had a little "kick," so might not be the best for young kids if they are sensitive to stuff like that.

This is the second time I'm making it. The first time, I used milk.  I thought the recipe was okay. This time I used one egg, instead.  I still think this recipe is okay. It's just meatballs with some hotness added to it. Maybe if I tweaked it up like the other folks do, I might give it five stars, but that wouldn't be rating this particular recipe, would it?

I made the recipe almost as written, I omitted the hot sauce since I'm not a hot food fan. Loved the meatballs, will definitely make again.

Everyone loved these. I didn't put in the spicy ingredients simply for my son. Though I did use Italian breadcrumbs and garlic powder. We are planning on adding another veggie next time. I think these would be great for subs.

Very good I prefer to bake meatballs than frying, but the only change I would make is a half teaspoon of pepper flakes, 3/4 was a little too much. I would definitely make again

YUM! Love the red pepper here, although I only used about half as much.  Used cottage cheese for the milk and added some cooked quinoa I had in the fridge and some uncooked hot cereal for the bread crumbs and added some nutritional yeast.
Baked 1.5 inch meatballs for 30 minutes on pure convection 350 degrees...

Wasn't the best, the meatballs could be better by searing them for a few seconds to make them less mushy and have a better outside texture. I'd also use real garlic in the meatball mixture and  make sure to use parchment paper under the meatballs when cooking with the baking sheet. It was a little flavourless but overall mediocre.

I thought these meatballs were perfect  and I will definitely be making again! I grated the onion because I really hate having pieces of uncooked onion in my meatballs. I also used a 1" scoop so I had more meatballs. The cook time remained the same as written.

I use to buy frozen meatballs, but never again! These are so good and simple to make. I made the following slight changes: whole milk instead of skim, homemade bread crumbs, increased the Italian seasonings to 2 teaspoons since the crumbs were unseasoned, and omitted the Worcestershire sauce because I didn't have any. It made 21 meatballs. Next time I plan on doubling the recipe, at least, and freezing the extras for a quick meal on busy days.

This recipe is amazing!   I make it with gluten free seasoned bread crumbs & it is still amazing!  I have celiac disease and cannot find gluten free frozen meatballs (I am a mother of 3 & don't have a lot of time) & other recipes I've tried take a long time and don't have much flavor.   I made this for a big family dinner, they loved the meatballs & asked for the recipe.  I, of course,  recommended the app as well ;-)

Loved this! I doubled the recipe but use 1 lb ground beef and 1 lb ground Italian sausage. I like to combine ingredients and form the balls the night before and bake the following evening. It makes for a quick and easy weeknight meal.

Love this recipe! I make it all the time. I always double the recipe and do 1 lb of ground turkey and 1 lb of hot Italian sausage. I also do a little less onion and red pepper flakes. I roll the meatballs and freeze them uncooked for later use.

I have to make meatballs on a weekly basis in my house... But I have made some substitutions in the recipe... Instead of Worcester sauce I use A1 Think & Hearty Steak sauce, instead of garlic salt I use 1 tbsp of minced garlic, & no milk.

Loved the taste, easy to make.  Will make again, but will reduce the salt (with the other seasonings I do not think it will be missed) and reduce the oregano (a little redundant with the italian seasoning).  I agree that if the onion is grated, it will blend better with meat.  Also, will flip the meat balls half way through baking

No wonder it is so well rated and so widely loved.

Decided to make it my first dish-from-internet-recipe and it was a resounding success!

Very oniony and with a hint of spice, which is exactly what my girlfriend and I love.  Delicious!

Awesome meatballs!  I made some today to put in a recipe for sauce called "Italian Spaghetti and Meatballs"by Jeremy on this site.  Jeremy's  sauce was great, but the meatballs in that recipe sounded a bit bland, so I came looking for another recipe.  Glad I found this one!  Thanks for sharing!

Made the balls with spaghetti.
The balls are very good but I didn't especially like them with my tomato sauce.  Guess I'm used to Moms meatballs recipe.

The recipe would be good in making a nice meat loaf.

I still recommend them.  They are easy to make and with the exception of the ground beef, it can be made with what you probably have in the kitchen.

The meatballs were a bit spicier than I anticipated, but nonetheless, my picky children gobbled these down and asked for more!  It was a family hit and will now be added to our rotation.

Next time, I'll use 1/4 ts of red pepper vs. 3/4 ts, but other than that, we won't change a thing--- except maybe doubling the recipe and freezing the second batch!

I loved these! Came out great! They are spicy but good. I used less salt and less crush pepper and hot sauce. I also added 1/4 pd. mild Italian sausage to 1 pd. ground round 85/15. I used ricotta cheese in place of milk. Thanks for this great recipe!! Will be making some to freeze soon.

These Meatballs are AWESOME! I left out the onion because my boyfriend doesn't like raw onions, I subbed a little onion powder instead.. and made my own Italian seasoning because I didn't have any.. We enjoyed this very much.. Will definitely make it again and again!!

Only meatball recipe I use. I use panko Italian seasoned breadcrumbs but still add the rest of the seasonings. My sweetheart (who is full Italian) said they are as good as his mom's. My kids love these. I make them whenever we have spaghetti. They are a staple in our home. I've tried them fried and baked. I usually fry them in batches for about 3 minutes on each side, put them in a bowl to drain, drain off the extra oil from the pan but leave some of the bits in the pan, add the no sugar added tomato basil sauce from a jar, scrape the bits into the sauce, bring the sauce up to a simmer, and return them to the pan to simmer in the sauce, covered, for about 10 minutes. Perfection. Thank you for this outstanding recipe.

Good recipe!  I reduced the Italian seasoning to half.  Would have been a little too much.  Didn't put much red pepper flakes either, because kids don't like it hot.  Will cook for only 20 min next time.  I will definitely use this in the future!

I LOVE these! I use a little less milk, and a bit more Parmesan cheese and bread crumbs. It allows the meatballs to stick together better. I also set the timer for cooking at about 12 minutes, then turn the meatballs for another 10 minutes cooking time. My husband is wild for these, and he hates onions!

I have been meaning to try these, well I finally made them. They did not disappoint. They are very easy to make. To make the  clean up easy I lined the pan with aluminum foil, it was a SNAP to clean up. One pound of hamburger makes about one dozen meatballs. The only ingredient I would not add is the crushed pepper or the dash of hot sauce. If I did add it, it would be 1/8 tsp of crushed pepper. That's enough for me, my taste buds are not a fan of those 2 ingredients.

These meatballs are very delicious but they definitely have a strong kick to them! They are a little spicy for my kids. You may want to tone down the red pepper flakes.

These are very good made primal! I used heavy cream instead of milk, and 1/4 cup almond flour instead of 1/2 bread crumbs. Also cooked meatballs on a bacon-fat smeared baking sheet....delicious.

I have made this several times. I usually stick to the exact recipe and get tasty tender meatballs that are jam packed with flavor. When making them for my 5 year old I omit the red pepper as it is a bit much for her.

I tripled this recipe, but only doubled the salt.  I could still taste it, so I'll probably reduce to 1/2 tsp next time.  I also leave out the hot sauce and red pepper flakes for personal preference.  These meatballs are very good, make sure to chop your onions very fine.

I've been using this recipe for about 3 years now!  It's excellent as is but I've played around with it a few times by using half ground pork sausage (spicy) and half ground beef.  Then replaced the milk with ricotta cheese.  No change to the spices other than to use dried and minced onion as my kids wouldn't eat them if they saw onion pieces in them...   and they're adults now!  My daughter calls them 'Crack Balls' since they are so addictive!  Ha! 

Tonight I"m making them but stuffing them with a piece of mozzarella cheese in the middle to see how that works and replacing bread crumbs with a seasoned almond flour mix to make them gluten free and lower carbs.  Wish me luck!

Thanks for the great recipe!

I had to adjust the recipe a bit because I didn't have enough grated parmesan cheese, so I used grated white cheddar to make up the difference and I had to made my own bread crumbs out of croutons.   Nonetheless, it still was a fabulous recipe and I would highly recommend it.  Super easy.  I love the technique of baking them in the oven.  The true test will be whether or not my family approves.

Very yummy. Just a bit too hot and I used only 2/3 of the prescribed amount of crushed red pepper flakes. But I'm a wuss on spiciness. Very good!

Probably the best meatballs I've ever made.  Substituted the garlic salt for crushed garlic and sea salt.  I add a dash of worcestershire sauce to my spaghetti but never have added to my meatballs.  That and the red pepper make these a winner.

I made this per the recipe, except that I cut the red pepper flakes to 1/4 tsp.  I'm glad I did because after they were cooked I ate one and it was delicious but then the red pepper kicked  in!  Whew, it was hotter than I thought it would be.  Now I put all the spices in a spice grinder and I don't know if that caused the heat to come out more or not.  Still they were delicious!  Will definitely make them again.

I made these for dinner tonight with homemade spaghetti sauce. The meatballs tasted wrong with my spaghetti sauce.  Followed the recipe to a T except for cutting back on the red chili peppers.  The meatballs had what I call "hot spots" of hot spice in them and that turned me off.

It was my first time making meatballs and I was having  guests over for dinner.  The ingredients were all basic, and were in the house.  I doubled the recipe and mixed sausage with hamburger.  They were a huge hit.  I was so proud of them, that I cut some in half and had people try them before dinner.  It only enhanced the anticipation for dinner.  This is going on my favorites list.

I didn't find these any different then any other meatball I have had however it could be just me because my girlfriend thought they were amazing. A few things Id change next time I make them first I would flip them halfway through cooking time as they were burnt on the bottom when I took them out. I would also like to replace the onion with mozza cheese and possibly use ricotta cheese instead of milk for a moisture more flavourful meatball maybe a tad more salt as well.

REMINDER: WARM MEAT TO ROOM TEMPERATURE. This is just to save the pain in your hands when you mix the  meat. I always forget when I make meatloaf and I forgot when I made this dish. That said, the meatballs are delish, and it's my first time making meatballs. I used half ground chicken and half sausage. Next time I might use 3/4 chicken (or venison or bison) and 1/4 sausage -- it tasted strongly of sausage. I like a little sausage flavoring but also like to cut the fat.  I also cut the hot spice. It bordered on being a little salty, so I might cut that just a tiny bit next time, too. Substituted egg for some of the milk, not sure that was necessary.

Always a hit!! The only change I made was I used 3/4 hamburger meat to 1/4 Italian sausage. Everyone loves them.

First time trying this recipe but it won't be my last. Excellent in every way. Can't wait to try the next day in homemade spaghetti sauce. The flavors are exceptional coming from the kitchen, can't keep everyone's little fingers from sneaking a few.

We really liked these. I have toddlers, so I omitted the hot pepper, spicy ingredients. I also added an egg. When I first tried these right out of the oven, they seemed a little odd. But, when I simmered them in spaghetti sauce for about 10 minutes, they underwent a magical transformation and turned out to be totally delicious. Everyone liked them. I love that they are baked--easy to make!

excellent as is.  I would like to try adding spicy italian sausage, ground pork, or ground lamb with the beef next time but this recipe is a winner as is.  I'd also consider putting the onions in a food processor to hide them from kids

Good, but tasted more like meatloaf. I didn't use the hot sauce and  next time I will use half the amount, at most, of the red pepper flakes. They have a pretty good kick!

Made these as the recipe stated. Will flip half way through baking next time. Easy and tasty. I can see how these are good with either red sauce or bbq sauce.

I replaced the milk with Ricotta cheese. My stuff is a little bit hard to stir, so I added some milk. It turned out to be a little dry, (maybe I should shorten the time next time or make bigger balls )but it's soooo good!

These hit it out of the park for my family. I've only ever done or seen meatballs done in the skillet so that is how I did them. Messy. I will try baking them next time. My family loved them. Darn. Now I will need to make meatballs vs. buy and put into pan to warm...

Followed this recipe and was not dissapointed !  Its my favorite  meatball recipe,  hands down!  I do sub ground turkey (85% lean) for beef and an egg for half the milk, but aside from that I follow this recipe to the T and get the tastiest meatballs ever.

These balls were delicious. I made 2 batches, one ground beef the other bison meat. Both were great. Changed a few things for the bison, no red pepper flakes on either and egg instead of mik. For the bison, I ground up multi-grain bread added a little dry mustard and no cheese, forgot. I used ground stuffing cubes instead of bread crumbs for the beef. Also used fresh minced garlic. Again, these were very good, especially with homemade marinara and pasta.

This is a great recipe. I make a large batch and freeze half of them for future quick and easy dinners. I just place the frozen meatballs in sauce in a skillet and heat them up and they're ready to serve.

Lovely recipe, made it tonight. 
I did make some changes based on the reviews, by swapping out the mince for a mix of pork and veal mince - and replacing the milk with ricotta cheese. I also threw an egg in as it was a little dry without the milk. These were lovely and I will definitely make again! Thanks for a great recipe!

I cut the hot pepper and only used 1/3 of what the recipe called for and it was still very spicy. There was too much of either oregano or Italian seasoning for me as well.  Also the meatballs were done at around 15 minutes. The worst part is that the meatballs burned on the bottom. Every single one of them. I went to flip them at 10 minutes and they were stuck. Unfortunately I had to give the dog the bottom half of each one as it wasn't salvageable at all. So I wasted half a pound of hamburger.

Was looking for something new and gave it a go.  I used my jar of garlic instead of the garlic salt  - and the meatballs tasted wonderful .  I baked them for 20 minutes, then to brown them a bit more, I turned on the convection in the oven.   My daughter and I made them over lunch and she said, "Mom, these are the best yet!".  I don't know if it was the pepper flakes, hot sauce, or Worcestershire sauce - but it makes for a perfect bite  in the flavor!

LOVE LOVE LOVE these meatballs!  Very few changes.  I used lean ground turkey instead of beef and 2% milk not skim.   PERFECT in 20mins.   I like them as is, but I top them with whatever pasta sauce I have on hand for the family.

Loved this recipe! My normally picky fiancé devoured them :). I used water instead of milk (I was out) and just regular Kraft grated Parmesan. Served them up with brown gravy and mashed potatoes for a definite repeat dinner!

I just made these tonight, and I'll never make another recipe again. The only differences with my meatballs were I had no garlic salt, so I just put a little extra salt and used garlic powder. Also, I didn't have Franks red hot sauce, so I just used sriracha. These were awesome! I took the advice of another member and turned the meatballs halfway through. they turned out perfect!

I can't eat red pepper flakes or hot sauce, but my husband can. He liked them well enough, and said it was a nice change on something bland. The only thing we would want to change is making them in cupcake pans or something so they don't dry out so bad while on a sheet pan.

This is my go to meatball recipe. They are moist and flavorful.  I use half beef and half pork to prevent dryness and I've never had a problem. A perfect addition to spaghetti but they also make for delicious meatball subs.

I doubled the recipe using a pound of italian sausage and a pound of ground beef. It made 15 2" meatballs. They turned out moist and tasty.  I pretty much followed the recipe but only had panko so increased the spices a bit. I plan to serve them tomorrow but I tasted a bit of one (I had to make sure it was cooked, of course).

I used ground pork/beef mix, garlic powder instead of garlic salt, BBQ sauce for worchester, left out the pepper sauces for my 2 year old, and used ricotta in place of the milk. Fantastic, and baked up moist.

I made this tonight and followed the recipe exactly. I doubled it because I wasn't sure how many meatballs a single batch would yield. The meatballs are SOOOO good! Gave a bite to my husband and he said they are "restaurant quality." So glad I doubled the recipe (and just FYI- I ended up with 42 meatballs). Will definitely make this again!

I executed this recipe with slight modifications. I used ricotta cheese instead of milk and I browned the meatballs before baking them in the oven. I served them on a french baguette, garlic and onion tomato sauce and  provolone cheese. After I assembled the sandwiches, I put them in the oven to toast the bread and melt the cheese.

I've made these meatballs three times.  The last time I doubled the recipe because my kids complained there were no leftovers.  I may try some of the other viewers suggestions and add ricotta or ground pork, but as is, this recipe is the bomb!  Our favorite way to eat these scrumptious meatballs is on a toasted hoagie roll smothered in melted provolone cheese.  Yum!

Absolutely LOVE this recipe! I use spicy breadcrumbs to give the meatballs a little extra zing! Just love how baking them gives them the crisp outside but moist inside. I decided to put marinara sauce over the top of the meatballs after they were done cooking, covered the pan in tin foil, and left them in the oven as it cooled to allow the sauce to heat up. YUM! Can't wait for leftovers tonight!

Very good. I made meatball subs using this meatball recipe and topped it with Prego Italian Sausage and Garlic Pasta Sauce along with some more grated parmesan cheese. The only thing I altered was that I subbed the milk for an egg. They had a very unique Italian flavor and it only took one 6 inch sub with no sides to fill me up. I have a feeling I will be making these regularly considering how much my fiance loved them.

the meatballs were a hit! I did not put the spicy sauce and the heat for me was perfect. Also, spray your pan or foil with nonstick spay because the meatballs will stick.

I used 85/15 ground beef, used bottled grated parm ('cause I didn't have any fresh) and skipped the breadcrumbs ('cause I didn't have any of those either, lol!) Overall really good flavor! The italian seasoning really stands out.  They were a bit salty for my taste but that might be because I didn't use the milk and bread crumbs.  The red pepper flakes add just enough kick.  The only reason I rated this recipe with 4 stars is that I didn't make it exactly as called for in the recipe. I would definitely make these again!

I made a large batch, used 3.7 lb pkg of 90% lean Ground beef.  To adjust to this amount I minced 1 large onion and 4 lg garlic cloves. 1/4 cup fresh chopped parsley and oregano combined. 1 small deveined and de-seeded fresh cayenne chili pepper minced. 1 Tbsp dried oregano, 1 Tbsp dried basil, 2 tsp salt, 1 tsp black pepper, 1 tsp dried red pepper flakes, 1 Cup Italian Style bread crumbs. Stirred all these ingredients in bowl to combine thoroughly. In separate bowl I beat 1 egg, 2 Tbsp Worschestershire Sauce, 3 splashes of Tabasco sauce and 1/4 cup of milk. Stirred liquid ingredients into dry. Mixed ground beef by hand into final mixture. Baked 2" diameter meatballs at 400 degrees for 20 minutes, baked 1" mini meatballs at 400 degrees for 10 minutes. Made 40 large and 30 mini meatballs. Taste Great!!

I will give this 5 stars since my husband loves it so much when I make it... One change I make is I don't use skim milk since all I drink is whole milk, I use what I have or buy what I will use later... Still it turns out perfect... Last time I made was couple days ago and my husband said that was perfect- I didn't taste it til later due to my morning sickness, but he loved it a lot... So 5 stars for easiness and tasty dish...

I'm not a huge meatball fan, but I loved these! I used ground venison instead of beef and subbed matzo meal for the bread crumbs.

Very easy, and tasty meatballs, I forgot the hot sauce, but the red pepper flakes added enough kick.

I didn't use pepper flakes because I couldn't find them in the church cupboard but did use extra hot sauce.  Also sauteed them first before putting in baking pans and covering with spaghetti sauce;  they went over REALLY well and were tasty and tender!!!  I even served them with large baked potatoes and the two were a hit!

These are great for meatball subs! Just put some butter, garlic, provolone, and mozzarella on a hoagie roll and toast. Mmmmmm!!

I seriously don't know why I've waited so darn long to make meatballs.  I've never made them until today.  Just finished making this recipe and I have to say I am impressed with myself - of course,  with a lot of help from "lovestohost".  The proportions and amounts are spot-on for the initial recipe.  I did add a couple of links of mild Italian sausage because I needed to - but I know that change in no way made enough change to impact a true rating of "Loved it"/5.  So many possibilities with this recipe to tweak the spices for your own taste.  Right now I have  the cooked  meatballs simmering in a basic marinara/red wine sauce and will serve over rigatoni w/grated Romano.  mmmmm.... I can hardly wait!  Thanks for posting this recipe!  Glad to have found it!  :) **use parchment paper on baking sheet for an easy clean up***

Delicious, and there is lots of room for adjustment.  I skipped the Parmesian cheese because my family is not crazy for it, and I had no worcester sauce in my cabinet so I used soy sauce -- and it was still delicious.

I was looking for a recipe that I already had ingredients for.  The only changes I made were one clove of chopped garlic and I added a bit of basil as I didn't have Italian seasoning.  Can I just say that these were the BEST meatballs I've ever made?? I used 96% lean ground beef and was worried they might be tough, but they were juicy and super flavorful.  Fantastic recipe! This will be my go-to!

Absolutely the best meatballs I have ever made/eaten. I doubled the recipe and didn't measure seasonings. But I used all the ingredients. I almost forgot the worchershire but thankfully caught myself. So so good!

I've never loved or craved meatballs before, but I never knew how good they could be until I made these last night!! They are so tender and flavorful and don't crumble like meatballs I've made in the past. I made a quadruple batch (stocking our freezer before the baby comes), which made about 50 meatballs using a scant 1/4 cup scoop for each. 20 min baking time was spot on. I did sub 1 lb of the ground beef with ground pork and reduced the salt by a total of 1 tsp. I will never look at meatballs the same way again!

I made it kosher! No milk, no cheese, added 2 carrots for the color, and gave it 500° at the end for 2 minutes. Great recipe, I will use it again. Thank you.

These meatballs were delicious! I substituted milk with an egg and I added a bell pepper. I puréed the pepper, onion, egg and seasoning in a blender (to hide the onion and pepper from my picky kids). Everyone loved them, yum!

Loved this, ate them so fast I forgot to take a pic. Used all the ingredients exactly, minor sub from skim milk to 2% (what I had) and instead of crushed red pepper I used Tuscan ground pepper blend from a local spice company. Oh, and Panko vs Italian bread crumbs. I would make this again and again, thank you!

Great. Simple and flavorful. A little spicy for me (I'm a spice wimp, though). I'll leave out the crushed red pepper next time. Used 1.2 lbs of ground beef (didn't increase other ingredients) and it made 23 small meatballs (about 1 1/2 inch each). My new meatball go-to.

Delicious!!  A couple changes I made: used 1/2 pork sausage and 1/2 ground beef.  The recipe calls for 3/4 tsp crushed red pepper which seemed like a lot so I only used 1/2 of that and I am glad I did because the spice was just right and would have been inedible (to me) if I had used what the recipe called for.  Used egg instead of milk because my daughter has a dairy allergy.  I also used less onion and next time I will use even less than I did this time.  I made a double batch and froze half.  This is my first time making meatballs and I will definitely make these again!

I found this recipe a few years ago & it's been my go to ever since. I usually use ground bison and they're perfect! I've also used ground turkey and they're just as good. I use onion and garlic powder instead of fresh onion & garlic salt. I add more red pepper flakes (I like spicy!) and I omit the milk, since I don't drink it. They're perfect! I'm actually eating some now???? the only time there was a misfire, was my own fault. I didn't have bread crumbs or onion powder, so I used a packet of Frenchs Onion Soup mix. It would've been delicious, but I had added some salt already. Oops!

These are not too hard to make.  Everyone liked them.  I use with two jars of pasta sauce per pound of meat.  We like a lot of sauce.

The bf went nuts for these! They're really easy and tasty. I do recommend reducing the onion a bit - or at least making sure to dice it very fine. Served it with red sauce, fresh bread and salad.

Great recipe! I used A1 steak sauce and grated parmasean cheese since I didn't have worechestire sauce and shredded parmasean. The meatballs tasted great with the substitutes.

I went to make this recipe and discovered I was out of onions. Gasp. Surprising since I always know my onion situation lol. I decided to make it anyway using dried onions and onion powder. Despite that these were very good. Texture was great even though I used ground turkey (93/7). I'll be making these again.

I'd never made meatballs before, and wanted to give it a try. I found this recipe and decided to use it for my first meatball-making attempt. I will never, never, ever need another meatball recipe—these are the best meatballs I've ever had. I don't usually keep milk in the house, so I've been using one egg instead of the skim milk. I also use 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 ground pork. So good!

Everyone commented on how great these meatballs were.  I was afraid because of the hot sauce and red pepper but even the kids loved them.  They do have a kick to them but everyone asked for seconds. I did double the recipe due to the amount of people eating.

I really liked the flavors. I made the recipe as described. However, my meatballs kept falling apart. Next time, I would use an egg instead of the skim milk.

Awesome! It also works great with lean ground turkey or a combination of turkey and lean ground beef.  My family loves these meatballs.

We use it for spaghetti and meatballs, and killer meatball subs.

Best meatball recipe we have tried thus far! I subbed the beef with turkey and used gluten free bread for my daughter with a wheat allergy. This recipe turned out great. I submitted a picture as well.

The taste was very good - however they were way too soft and fell apart the minute I put them into my sauce.  Really needs an egg to hold them together.

Try adding Soy Sauce instead of Worcestershire sauce... Its amazing. Use cold hamburger meat. Oh and hand mixing everything in also is great. (Separate the liquids and the solids and the hamburger and then once every section is mixed up dump the onions into the liquid, mix and then pour into the mushed up hamburger and once mixed completely pour in the dry section and squeeze with hands until everything is evenly mixed.) I made a double batch so that can also be something. And i also make the meatballs smaller about an inch in diameter. Hope you enjoy.

Best meatballs that I've ever had!  I'm critical of my own cooking but I loved these and so did my 6 year old daughter.  The only thing different that I did was add more hot pepper sauce and real garlic.  5 stars!

This has to be the most delicious meat ball recipe I have ever tried.  Has a nice kick to the flavor.  I make them earlier in the day and then just before dinner I either make spaghetti sauce and then drop the meatballs in the sauce to reheat.  I have also used gravy.

I was a bit disappointed with this recipe.  I felt that the oregano was on the overpowering side (though I've always preferred less seasoning and spices than those around me).  I also used a smoky habanero sauce instead of Frank's Red Hot (never have liked vinegar-heavy sauces like Franks and Tobasco), which gave the meatballs a bit of a bite, and that was pretty good.  Definitely worth trying again, and if I find I like them better with less (or no) oregano, I'll be sure to update my rating.

This is now my go to meatball recipe! I love it!!!!! I just cut down on the salt a bit, but other than that, don't change a thing! I can eat them straight from the oven with no sauces and still be just fine! Thanks for the recipe!

I use this recipe with elk and deer venison, and the only change I make is to add one egg for extra moisture,  what with venison being so lean. Love them, husband loves them, and have had plenty of friends try them and be incredibly surprised (in a good way) that it's venison and not beef!

This is our go to recipe for meatballs, we make a huge batch and freeze them for future use. So easy and I will never buy frozen "meat"balls again.

This is now my go-to recipe for meatballs. Everyone I've served them to loves them. I have also used ground deer meat instead of beef and they turned out pretty good.

I use this recipe a lot, but slightly tweak it.  I eliminate the red pepper flake and italian seasoning.  Fun thing I tried was making a meatloaf using this same recipe and it came out great!  Just a solid go-to recipe!

I give this recipe 4 stars, but after MY tweaks (of course) its a 5 star meatball! I added some things that made it truly awesome!! 

I chopped up 1/3 lb of bacon, and sautéed it with the onions and minced garlic (instead of garlic salt). I also added 1/3 cup of chopped ROASTED pine nuts...I mixed them all in, rolled em out, and baked em!

Fantastic! Only change I make is to use minced dried onion instead of chopping a fresh one.

I've made these twice. I followed the recipe the first time and it needed some more flavor, needed to hold together better, and I almost felt like they were a little dry. Made them gain with 90/10 lean ground beef. I used kosher salt and simply used a dash more, switched the garlic salt to garlic powder (otherwise it would be too salty), also used a little more union and had it finely diced. I ended up adding in more of the Italian seasoning and red pepper flakes which I think went well. Cooked for 24 minutes. After round two, it still didn't really hold like I wanted, flavors were better, but this time felt too moist. I would cut back on the milk and the onion, add in an egg white, and up the bread crumbs and Parmesan just to try and give it some more hold considering I've seen eggs used in every other meatball recipe.

I omitted the hot sauce and used an egg instead of the milk. I also cut back on the red pepper. I think there was still too much red pepper.

I'm an amateur that loves to cook . I usually do not follow recipes . I like to do my own thing an it usually turns out pretty darn good. However my meatballs never do. Something is always missing. I also always have made them on the stove top frying them then adding them to my sauce. This time I followed this recipe exactly as I will from now on. Simply put. The name is fitting . They are the best  I've ever had !! Thank you for posting it .

Super easy. The taste is wonderful and I now have my family begging me to make them again. Only suggestion would be to rotate them halfway through or the bottoms get a little tough.

This recipe is my go to, (five star as it is written)... Or it was until my daughter's dairy allergy cut it out. I just made a much requested second round of these using nutritious yeast for the cheese and unsweetened almond milk instead of skim milk. The typically "the more butter the better" DH and very picky DD love them, even more than the original recipe.

My favorite meatball recipe ever.  Just made these again tonight to go with my homemade, homegrown tomato sauce.  I use half ground beef and half ground pork.  It just doesn't get any better than this.  Perfection!

Delicious.  I used egg instead of milk and garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I paired these meatball with a marinara recipe "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" from Allrecipes.  The family loved it.  I doubled both which gives us enough for leftovers.

Great recipe! I made it gluten free by using my own bread crumbs. I also used a milk/egg combination as a binder and added spinach for sneaking in greens to my son's diet. Will make again!

These meatballs were easy to make. I would suggest greasing your baking pan first. Mine stuck to the pan badly, despite using a non-stick pan! I would also recommend using onion powder or onion flakes vs fresh, chopped onion, as the onions still had a lot of crunch and bite to them. I don't mind it, but my hubby doesn't like crunchy onion texture. Next time, I'll only make these two adjustments.

This was a solid meat ball but twenty minutes was too long to cook it. It was sort of tough and definitely could have been cooked for five minutes less at least.

Just made these with mashed potatoes, roasted asparagus, summer squash and onions. Soo good. Only thing I did different was used whole milk, fresh oregano, some thyme, didn't use the peppers or hot sauce and used real garlic instead. Oh and I poured some olive oil over them before baking for extra goodness.

FANTASTIC!!!!
I cut back the red pepper flakes a teeniee bit depending on the type of meal I am making with this. 
VERY moist meatballs. Basic ingredients you are sure you have on hand!
They cook quickly too!
A staple in my dinner rotation now!!

I made a double batch and substituted half ground chicken.  They stuck to the pan, but were otherwise tasty.

Me and my family are gluten free for many who do not know what gluten is it is the thing that makes your bread rise mostly found in wheat items anything made with wheat, we make our bread crumbs from scratch and we also don't use any red pepper or hot sauce and its really good you don't have to have gluten to have a good meal.

Perfection!!! I wanted meatballs with gravy for a hearty meal, so instead of using the Italian seasoning & oregano I subbed Lipton onion & mushroom soup seasoning (about a tablespoon) & made gravy with the remaining packet. I also had leftover fresh bread so I used plain bread crumbs. These were absolutely delicious & smelled amazing while cooking. I made 12 & they were perfectly cooked in exactly 20 mins. I will never use another meatball recipe now! Thanks!!!

Actually better than I thought! I had all the ingredients except for the oregano but it delicious anyway.  It had a bite to it because of the peppers.  I like the fact that this recipe can be used for not only just typical spaghetti and meatballs but can also be used for appetizers with a sweet and sour sauce or any way you would like.  I will definitely make this again and make sure I have the oregano available.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

The only thing I did different was to use ground turkey instead. They didn't need any marinara sauce or anything. They were so good and full of flavor. Just enough spice to be really good but not too hot. I never have been able to make meatballs(they always fall apart or something), but this turned out awesome. They've got to be the best meatballs I've ever had. The good news is now I can make them at home instead of having to buy them premade! I'll be making them again. They'll be perfect for potlucks.

Easy, quick and great flavor.  May be a little spicy for some. Omitted the hot sauce but kept the pepper flakes.  Will definitely make again.

Awesome!  Added red pepper flakes instead on hot sauce, they were still awesome.  Oh, and, I soaked my breadcrumbs in the milk before adding them to the meat.  That keeps the bread from drying out the meatballs.

This is great! I am lactose intolerant and am sensitive to spiciness. So I omitted milk, cheese, and hot sauce. Used 1/3 cup white grape juice. Also, I did not have enough Italian seasoning. So I just used three shakes from the spice bottles for each spice that makes up Italian seasoning. Still had a kick!

I started making these before I checked my pantry, so had to use half Italian breadcrumbs, half plain, and had no Italian herb  blend. .  Also left out crushed red pepper intentionally.  They were just OK. They  burned on the bottom at 400 degrees, so for last batch I lowered to 350, and turned them halfway, and those did not burn. Not worth the effort in my opinion.

I omit the red pepper flakes for my kids, but the entire family loves these. I have made these with both beef and meatloaf mix, and both are very good. I recently used this recipe to stuff green peppers, and they were awesome. This recipe is in our regular rotation.

Hands down, these are the best meatballs I've ever had. I've made these about six times now and they are flawless. If you don't feel like dicing an onion, you can substitute about 1/2 teaspoon onion powder (as I've done on lazy days), and you can use garlic powder instead of garlic salt (I seem to never have garlic salt around) for the same results. Other than that, I would not make any alterations as these meatballs are simply wonderful as they are. Excellent work, LTH.

This is amazing. I use 96% lean beef, sweet baby rays bbq sauce in place of Worcester sauce, and no hot sauce. Comes out moist and delicious. Tip : use the mix to make a meatloaf. Bake in ove for 1 hour @ 350. Or these make great burger patties.

This is my new go-to meatball recipe! I did substitute the milk for 1 egg and 1/4 cup of spaghetti sauce (I make my own but I'm sure any sauce would be ok). They held together beautifully and they were the perfect compliment to my homemade sauce. I will definitely be making these from now on!

This is a review of the ORIGINAL recipe. These were absolutely delicious! My first time making meatballs. If you have anyone who dislikes spicy food, cut back or eliminate the red pepper flakes. It calls for quite a bit. Secondly, next time I think I will saute the onions first. The onions come out crunchy in the meatballs. That may be appropriate, but my personal preference would be for more cooked down onions.

This was a super easy recipe. Didn't take long to make. I took the advice of another review and used an egg instead of milk. Didn't have bread crumbs, so I smashed some crackers in a ziplock until fine like bread crumbs. Turned out perfectly. The family loved them on spaghetti. Will use the leftovers to make meatball subs. Great recipe, thanks.

Tried this just recently.  It was a hit with the whole family!  We did not have "Italian Seasoning" and so we were a little heavy on the Thyme, so will be better prepared next time.  We also skipped the crushed red pepper to my husband and son's disappointment.  But hot sauce gives it enough kick for those of weaker tolerance for spicy heat.  Thank you for sharing!

This is probably the best meatball recipe EVER !!!  We've made it several times, and since the first time, DH loves making it too.  We double the meat and use 1lb. of ground beef and 1 lb. of sausage.  Sometimes we like to use spicy Italian sausage with it, so if you do, definitely cut back on the red pepper flakes.

The only thing I did differently was I USD Ricotta cheese instead of heavy cream. My sweetheart took leftovers to work, he let a couple of guys try them and they all went crazy over the taste! Thank you for sharing :)

This is my go to meatball recipe! I am an EXTREMELY picky eater and I love them.  I didn't have skim milk so I used 1%. First time it was a little spicy second time I didn't add the hot sauce and it wasn't as spicy. I have also made with some chopped green pepper and that added great flavor!

If you make 1 1/2" meatballs, expect to have nearly 30, not 12.

I HATE meatballs, but I LOVE this recipe!!  I am now a meatball lover, as long as it's these meatballs.  Since I only had garlic powder on hand, I used that in place of the garlic salt and then just doubled the salt called for in the recipe.  Also, since I have kids with little mouths, I made them smaller than what is stated in the recipe, probably about 3/4 inch in diameter.  Since I made them smaller, I cut the cooking time down to 17 minutes and they were done perfectly!  Cooked all the way through, a little browned on the outside and bottoms, but still nice and juicy.  Everyone ate these up and they are being requested to be made again.  Thanks so much for this recipe and converting me over to a meatball lover!!

Made this last night and it was delicious! I also substituted 1 egg for the milk and it turned out great. Maybe it was just my oven but I cooked them for 20 minutes at 400 degrees and they were a little dry so next time I'll try 15 minutes. This is now my "go to" recipe for meatballs, highly recommend!

This has become my new go to for meatballs, I follow the recipe exact except for replacing the milk with ricotta cheese, and always double it and freeze any extras. I use this with a variety of sauces, and always have rave reviews.

Our favorite meatball recipe of all time!!!!! The only substitution  I make is 1/2 a teaspoon of crushed red pepper instead of 3/4 (and that's only because I don't like them too spicy).

I didn't know I liked meatballs until I made these! I loved the spice level, though it was too much for my toddler. I used half and half instead of skim milk, which worked out just fine. There was a definite "ick" factor in making these, which has nothing to do with the recipe itself, and everything to do with the fact that meatballs need to be mixed using your hands. These are delicious, both on their own, or served on subs with marinara and melted provolone.

These meatballs have such great flavor, but are too delicate. Baking is easier/faster and does keep these meatballs intact and attractive, but baking doesn't develop flavors as well as heavily browning in a pan. As written, these fall apart on the stove. I will definitely make these again, but I will decrease the milk slightly and add one egg to help hold everything together.

My go to recipe for meatballs.  The only difference is I add a bit of black pepper and whichever hot sauce I have on hand (usually tabasco or sriracha)  Also instead of garlic salt I use garlic powder since salt is already called for.  We always have a big bag of these in the freezer for easy dinners or packed lunches.  Just microwave a handful for a few minutes and they're good to go!  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

EDIT:  I make these with ground turkey now and it's still just as tasty!

I made the mistake of making these half hamburger meat and half Italian sausage) They were way too strong and over powering. Unfortunately the mild Italian sausage so over powered most everything else.  I rated this a five star because my hubby really liked them and also because my alteration made this recipe taste much different than it would have been otherwise. So it would not be fair to give it a low rating.  I will make this again using only hamburger meat and hopefully I will have a great meatball recipe, because if you stick to the recipe I don't see how you could go wrong with this one.  These do a have a kick to them so if you don't like spicy, I suggest you omit the red pepper flakes.

Def a keeper recipe.  I think it would be great exactly the way it is but I kinda made it on the spur of the moment so I just went with what I had.  I used...
-chicken seasoning instead of italian cuz that's what i had
-I used a little bit (1/2 C) of almond milk cuz that's the only kind of milk I had
-added an egg cuz I wanted to
-added garlic salt only 
-added chili powder but not the chili sauce

I baked it for about 15 min on its own and then added some tomato sauce (the ones that come in a jar) and baked for another 7 min.  It was delicious.  I added the sauce cuz I didn't feel like waiting.  I think it would be perfect if the meatball was baked separately and the sauce cooked separately and then may be simmer with the meatballs to serve.  

Thanks for the recipe.

I didn't like the texture of these meatball.  The 1/2 cup of bread crumbs made it more bready than meaty.  If I make this again I will either try less bread crumbs or substitute rice or oats in its place.

I've made these EXACTLY to recipe twice but tried egg instead of milk the third time and it's not better or worse, but a little more chewy and the crusts browned easier. If you like spicy, you will LOVE these. They're delicious with a sweeter red sauce. DON'T add sugar to your red sauce, just don't add any red pepper flakes or black pepper, these will entertain the taste buds plenty. These are really so good.

Look no further- these are awesome! I'm not the best cook in the world so if I get more than a "it's ok" from my husband, I must have a great recipe! Some of the changes I've made is to always double the recipe and use half Italian sausage/half beef but I've also used a sausage/chicken combo and a sausage/lamb combo- all wonderful! I usually only do half spicy, but even the non-spicy ones are delicious and my kids love them. They freeze great and are an easy, quick meal on soccer nights!

Average meat balls. They got a kinda funny tangy taste to me that rubs me the wrong way. Not sure if it's the worcetershire or the dash of Franks. Tryed em twice and there off my saved list.

Added an egg. Used minced garlic and sirachi. Mistakenly added cumin instead of oregano but it worked. Broiled them on each side for the last few minutes of cooking. Great recipe that I was able to tweak to my specific likes. I will make this again and again.

I have never had good luck making meatballs, but finally decided to try this recipe for myself after having heard my mother rave about it for months.  They turned out fantastic!  I included fresh garlic rather than garlic salt (only because I didn't have any on hand), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I will definitely be making this recipe again!

This recipe is perfect. Not too complex but just as tasty as the complicated recipes. I cut back on the red pepper flakes for my daughter but she still likes a little kick so I leave in the hot sauce.

This was my first round of making meatballs, but I must say I was expecting much more. I found that they were in need of more flavor and moisture. Next time I will cook them in a slow cooker with a sauce or marinade.

Excellent, moist meatballs with a good kick. Used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and cut back a bit on the pepper flakes. Otherwise made exactly as written. This is a great meatball - I don't understand how some reviewers say these are bland or mushy. Try this recipe, and Thanks LTH!

These are delicious, but the recipe calls for way too much onion in my opinion. Cut the onion in half at least.

really good I usually quadruple it and keep some on hand in the freezer for those nights I'm to busy or just forgot to pull something out. They're great with BBQ sauce, sweet and sour sauce, spaghetti, or just popping them in my mouth yum!

Very close to my recipe.  I made it as is, very good.  Nice little kick from the red pepper flakes.  I did add all the dry ingredients and put them in a food processor, didn't want big flakes of red pepper.  My recipe had fresh parsley in it so next time I will add that.  I did turn on the oven broiler the last ten minutes.  Five minutes then flipped the meatballs and cooked for the last five minutes.

This is my husband's favorite meatball recipe. I made it the first time 2 or 3 years ago and it's the only recipe I use. I've also used it to make meatballs at a party...they were gone in 15 mins!

This is the absolute best meatball recipe!  I like to make really little meatballs (easier to eat and a bit crunchier) out of this recipe, and they always turn out delicious.

This is my new go to meatball recipe.  We loved them.  I doubled it, used ground turkey, omitted the pepper flakes (cause I hate biting into those little hot pieces) and made them a little smaller than golf balls.  I baked and froze one half of them and only half baked the second half and finished cooking them in some home made spaghetti sauce in the crock pot.  They made excellent meatball subs for our family of 4 and there was still enough left over for the kids and I to mix with spaghetti noodles a few days later.  I can't wait to use the other half still in the freezer.

I have made this many many times and it is very easy to switch it up a bit depending on what you have around the kitchen. I made it tis morning and my changes included adding wile flax seed and wheat germ (maybe like 1/8-1-4 cup) one egg, one slice crumbled sourdough bread,no milk and I always fry it. It came out awesome and very juicy. The hot sauce, worcestershire and chili flakes make this a delicious recipe and the flax and wheat germ give it a bit of happy healthiness. Enjoy!

This was my first time making meatballs, and now whenever my mom makes spaghetti she tells me to make meatballs... The recipe was easy to follow, and although the flavor was great, I've always liked strong flavors so I'll be adding in some more Worcestershire sauce.

As a beginner, I found this recipe very simple. It turned out great and I neither burned down my apartment nor got food poisoning. That's high praise for this recipe. I used ground turkey instead of beef, per a friends recommendation. Big success! Next time I will cut the onions smaller.

I changed this up only a little bit:
used 1 lb grd beef and 12 oz grd italian sausage, doubled spices and onion EXCEPT crushed red pepper flakes - 1 tsp of those.  Used ricotta cheese in place of milk.  Used gluten free breadcrumbs (about 4 handfuls in the doubled recipe) and seasoned with seasoned salt (maybe 1 tsp tops).  Added ~3/4 c finely chopped mushrooms and ~1/2 tsp white pepper.  Loved them!  DH said maybe a little less spice next time so need to reduce the crushed red pepper to 3/4 tsp (single recipe amount).  Will make again!

Great recipe! I have made these several times as written and the meatballs were good but a little dry. I followed other reviewers suggestions and finally made them perfect tonight. I made using 1.5 lbs ground beef (1 lb 80/20 and half lb 85/15) I adjusted the seasoning accordingly except I used 1/3 cup skim milk and added 1 egg to the mixture. I cooked them for just under 20 minutes and they were amazing. I also made sure to use only a small white onion and diced it into super tiny pieces which I think was the key to the perfect texture!! Thanks for an amazing recipe

These were very good. I browned them in a pan on all sides to avoid the flat bottom of so many oven meatballs and finshed them off in the oven in the sauce. They had a very nice texture and taste so they'll probly be my go-to meatballs. I double the recipe, formed and froze half on a sheet pan before bagging. I saw no noticable difference so that was quite covinient

Quadrupled the recipe (3lbs ground beef and 1lb ground pork). Laid low on the red pepper flakes, and omitted the hot sauce. My kids loved it! Said they were the best meatballs I've ever made. Will make again for sure!

This is a fantastic recipe!  Would also make a good meatloaf...for those who may not want the "spicy" kick, simply leave out the red pepper flakes.  Excellent consistency, as well.  we found that it was necessary to turn them about halfway through cooking time.  We also replaced 1/2 of the ground beef with mild ground sausage.

I have never made homemade meatballs but after this recipe I will always make them homemade. They were super easy. I made it with 1lb.ground pork & 1 lb.ground beef &.doubled all other ingredients but eliminated pepper flakes as.my kids dont like spicy.

Love - the only thing we changed is using a mixture of pork and beef. To be fair, we are living in Germany temporarily and they LOVE pork here.

WOWZERS!!!  SOOO yummy!  I had to make a few alterations because I didn't have some of this on hand--like sub minced garlic for the garlic salt, no red pepper flakes, and another blend of spices instead of the Italian seasoning.  And since I had mild Italian sausage, I used that instead also of the beef.  So, maybe I changed too much to effectively rate this recipe, but it was delicious regardless!!  :)

I have made these and they are great.  They will definitely be made several more times for this family.  The only thing I did diferently was I added an egg, because I put them in a crockpot with sauce, and needed to make sure they wouldn'tbreak apart while in crockpot.

My husband loves meatballs, and this is the perfect recipe for us! The red pepper added just the right zip. I actually made them with deer hamburger, cooked them at 400 for 10min, then added them to my sauce already simmering letting it cook for about an hour. Amazing!

We didn't love it and I can't pinpoint exactly why.  Maybe the Worcester was just too strong.  It tasted more like a cocktail meatball than a traditional Italian meatball.  My husband also suggested that mixing beef with another meat (pork or turkey) may have suited our tastes a bit more.

I made these with ground turkey so they're a little lighter than you'd expect, but overall they're great! Just how I'd like a meatball to taste!

Delicious! Seems like a forgiving recipe too - I didn't have bread crumbs so I used a package of backup boxed stuffing mix from holidays, and then omitted the Italian seasoning. What can I say ... Sooooo good! I think this base recipe would make a great meatloaf!!

Added egg instead of milk, skipped the hot pepper sauce, skipped the Italian seasoning (i ran out), skipped the Worcestershire, I used fresh garlic and I cut the red pepper flakes down to just 1/4 the second time because it was too spicy for us. I know I changed a lot but everyone loved them. This is favorite recipe right now!

This recipe turned out great for me...however I didn't bake them. I cooked them in a little olive oil to get them crispy and then added my sauce to the pan and let them cook in the sauce for a bit. I also used a Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute in lieu of the oregano, italian seasoning and garlic salt and T.J.'s Pink Himalayan Salt instead of sea salt. They were moist and tasted awesome!

Yum! I made these with ground turkey since I was trying to be healthy but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. These are even better the next day, after sitting in marinara sauce.

Amazing! Best meatball I've had. The only thing I did differently was add a little bit of bacon bits. I also used asiago cheese instead of Parmesan, I think it has a nicer flavor. Also, about the cooking time: 25 minutes is way too long. I lightly sear my meatballs then put then in the oven for 8 minutes. They cook all the way through. Great recipe! This will be my meatball recipe from now on!

Just made these meatballs for the first time and my family said they were the best meatballs they've ever had. I made a double batch for six people and they were gone in minutes. I followed the recipe almost to a tee. I didn't have any skim milk so I used half 'n half instead. I also didn't have seasoned bread crumbs so I used seasoned Panko crumbs. Everything else was the same. They came out moist and tender and full of flavor. This is my new favorite meatball recipe and will use it from now on.

This was the first time I made meatballs. I was scared that they would be dry but I was wrong! This recipe was delicious.  I made meatball subs with it and used a bolognese sauce to top it off and melted provolone cheese on top.  I was going to freeze the left overs but it was so good we polished them off before they hit the freezer.

I thought I might cut back the Worcester sauce a tiny bit but my husband thought they were absolutely perfect. Easy to make and I will be freezing them. This recipe is a keeper.

I just have to say these meatballs are comparable to the mix I would pick up at the Italian market a few miles from here , there even better! All the herb with the btie added from the kick of Franks Red Hot and Red Pepper Flakes add that extra flavor thats need to call the an amazing melody of flavor. Anyone that would even not consider making these , would be insane.

Amazing recipe! I was really nervous about making these. I've never made meatballs before and I didn't want them to turn out dry and flavorless. Definitely not an issue with this recipe. They were very moist and flavorful(the only thing I forgot to add was the onion). Even my 3 year old loved them! Will absolutely be making them again.

I read all the great reviews about this recipe and decided to give it a try. Lo and behold, just as the reviewers said, these meatballs are delicious! They have a great flavor with just the right amount of spiciness. I will definitely make these again in the future.

We used ground venison (mixed with a small percentage of beef for flavoring) and they were amazing. For anyone looking to make use of their leftover stew meat grind that stuff up and make it into meatballs. I read the previous reviews and used an egg instead of dairy and they held up beautifully. We also made 5 large meatballs instead of small ones and just adjusted the time by 3 more mins. Worked out well

Great recipe!  The taste is well-balanced and meatballs are nice and juicy.  I used both the milk (as stated in recipe) as well as added an egg for extra moisture.  Also used fresh red hot peppers (finely chopped) instead of hot sauce and red pepper flakes.  Would definitely keep this recipe and make it again!

wish there were more stars to give!!! Wow-I pride myself on Italian cookery but never perfected GREAT meatballs! This flavor is powerful but not overwhelming. I followed the receipe religiously and was thrilled with the results. My meatball quest is over. I used fresh 80% ground beef not thawed and that is part of the trick. A little fresh parsley to garnish is a nice touch.

Awesome! First time making meatballs and I was exceptionally pleased with how these turned out. Followed the recipe to a T (even the things I was slightly weary of such as hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce). Stick to the recipe and you won't be disappointed. There is a slight heat/spiciness which we appreciate in my  household.

This is a great meatball recipe. Adding the hot sauce to it gives it a nice zippiness that my boyfriend loves. The meatballs get a little greasy during the cooking process, but as long as they don't sit in it they're AWESOME!

I thought this recipe was pretty darn good.  Usually, I don't follow a recipe when I make my meatballs but decided to try this one out!  I got nervous because I read good reviews before making them and then read bad ones while the were baking.  Followed it for the most part, with the exception of adding fresh minced garlic.  I also grated my onions very fine.  The meatballs were very tasty.  I did have a lot of liquid come out, that i poured out  3/4 of the time baking in the oven.  I will make again using the same ingredients by just eyeballing my measurements.  They did have a kick, but I added a lot of garlic!!

This was a great and easy recipe! Everybody liked them, even our kids. Because I was using ground pork (it's hard to get ground beef where we live), I added one egg to the recipe to help them hold together. Will definitely be making these again!

I have been making this recipe for years and am still amazed at how many servings you can get out of a small amount of mince. These are really soft and moist. I up the garlic and chilli but that's just personal taste. I find if grilling them, a lot of moisture comes out but if left to rest, they re-absorb the juices so try to be patient!

First, If you use deer meat spray some oil on the cooking sheet. Second, we must really like food spicy in our house.  I thought these were bland and the 9 year old ate them with no problem.  I've definitely had better meatballs.  I'd add pepper, more hot sauce and a little more salt since I don't have garlic salt, just powder.  I also use homegrown herbs and Penzys spices so these were really disappointing.

I adjusted for a serving of 6. The calculator worked perfectly and followed directions. I used shredded Parm instead of Sprinkled but the ingredients didn't specify either way. I also substituted the Skim for 2% as we didn't have skim

Awesomeee !!!! I did make some changes as others had suggested . I added ground pork and black pepper , substituted fresh garlic for the garlic salt , egg for the milk and , since I didn't have Italian seasoning , added dried basil . these came out delicious !!! They have a great texture and good balance and depth of flavor . I've eaten a lot of meatballs in my time and the only ones I've tasted better were from an Italian immigrant mom . Great recipe !!!

These were too salty for our liking and too spicy for my son.  It just wasn't the recipe for me.

Not the best meatballs Ive had, these were ok. A little salty and I omitted the 1/2 teaspoon sea salt. The pepper flakes were a nice touch but def lacking.

Followed this recipe to the letter and it was awesome.  They had a little kick which was a little too much for my daughter.  I will reduce (not eliminate) the hot pepper and hot sauce next time.  Still, they were fantastic.  This recipe will now replace my boring meatball recipe.  Thanks!

I always use this recipe now for spaghetti and meatballs. I have always added an egg to it, just to make sure there's no chance they are going to fall apart. Delicious, especially with the hot sauce kick!

I got this recipe from a friend, Dawn-Amherst, who's daughter found it here. I made these last night and even though I had to substitute A Lot of the ingredients(eggs for milk, unseasoned bread crumbs for seasoned, no hot sauce, etc.) they were so good that we are having them again tonight! This time I will be able to make them as written and I am positive they will be even better. Thanks, Lovetohost for posting and to Dawn for suggesting them.

These are delicious and easy to make.  I did add one egg and used half sweet Italian sausage.  I made two dipping sauces: chipotle bbq and horseradish/mustard mayo.  Thanks!!

These were outstanding. Perfect size and texture. Kids did them with spaghetti and the adults did meatball subs. Even the ladies did seconds. Definitely a keeper.

The kids found them a little too "spicy" even with the hot sauce and peppers removed, but the grown ups love them! I'll keep making them and the kids will get used to the flavors.

I took a leap of faith and made a double batch for my first attempt and I am glad I did.  I made it exactly as written.  The only change I will make going forward is to use more garlic salt or perhaps fresh garlic as we like a lot of garlic flavor in our meatballs. I highly recommend this recipe!

I'm new at meatball making, this was my first recipe to try. It was perfect. I followed the directions and turned the meatballs halfway during the cooking time. We made meatball subs out of them. Definitely a keeper!

These were really good and simple.  I was surprised that there was no egg in the recipe, but they held together just fine.  Will keep this handy.  The leftovers will make good meatball subs.

These meatballs are AMAZING!!! After the first taste test, it was hard to wait for them to cool down before popping a few in my mouth. I omitted the red pepper flakes and hot pepper sauce, because my kids and I are wimps, but it didn't matter they were still delicious!!! The hubs can always throw some hot sauce on top if he wants the heat. Tonight a sort of meatball stew, tomorrow meatball subs. Can't wait!!!

Made it for a crowd so 3# ground sirloin, 2# ground Italian sausage. Subbed ricotta for the milk.  Served with marinara recipe from this site - "Best Marinara Sauce Yet."
Both recipes were incredible!   I don't have to go to the Italian deli anymore for meatballs. This recipe is truly the be-all end-all for meatballs. Will make again and again - THANK YOU!

I didn't have Worcestershire, and didn't try to substitute anything.  I did not add any of the hot ingredients, not my thing.  After pulling them out of the oven, I couldn't stop eating them right off the pan!  I had to portion out the rest so I wouldn't eat everyone else's ; )
Actually, I could see how the hot elements would be really great in the recipe and I wished I had added them!
It's a winner all around, thank you for this recipe!

Great recipe! We had about 25 people over, I quadrupled the recipe and made some with onions and some without to satisfy the picky eaters in my family. The meatballs were DEVOURED!! Some people didn't even get any! Will definitely be making these again!

These are my favorite meatballs and I've been making this recipe for a couple of years now.  I'm only giving 4 stars because I tweak them a little from the original and then they are AMAZING!  I always double the recipe - one because my husband devours them, and two because I like to have a lot leftovers for easy lunches or sandwiches.  I use 1 lb. of ground beef and 1 lb. of hot Italian sausage (we like a kick), I only use about half the onion and saute it for nicer texture, and I replace the skim milk with ricotta.  Seriously, these are some of the best meatballs!

First, let me assure you - these meatballs are fantastic!! Now, I know some people like to blast other people for rating recipes that they have modified. Oh well. Blast away! Here's what I changed:  I doubled the recipe, but instead of 2 lbs of ground beef, I used 1 lb ground beef and 1 lb ground pork. I feel this significantly added to the recipe. Also, I used 2 cloves of minced garlic versus garlic salt. The fresh garlic is much better in my opinion. I skip the hot sauce and red pepper flakes and instead used cayenne pepper, smoked paprika, and a little chipotle chili powder. I also added a tablespoon of brown sugar. Also, instead of grated parmesan, I used a blend of parmesan, romano and asiago. Oh, and I beat 1 egg into the milk prior to adding it. The results? FANTASTIC. Like, can't-keep-your-hands-off-them good. It made about 55 good sized meatballs. I cooked them and then froze them in convenient sized batches. Perfect for pulling out after work for a quick meal. I thought this recipe was an excellent base and if a person makes a few personalized tweaks, they can have the perfect meat ball for their family.

Pretty amazing. I took the advice of one reviewer and added the ricotta. I do not regret the ricotta. Can anyone? And, I skipped the crushed pepper b/c ... I have little kids. I made for extended family and I felt pretty spectacular when they were like "WOW!" and "You worked so hard!"and "This is so incredible!". So, yeah. Try this recipe. It's good.

This is my "go-to" meatball recipe. Absolutely amazing. I have tweaked it slightly by leaving out the oregano and adding half a chopped green pepper. This is by far my favorite meatball recipe, hands down! To make these even more heavenly, I like to stuff them with ricotta and shredded mozzerella. Complete and utter nirvana

These were amazing! I cooked them in the crockpot from raw all day with sauce and sausage. Didn't have red hot sauce, so used pep porcini juice. Eyeballed all of the other ingredients. They melted in our mouths!:)

Perfect! Baked on a broiler pan to allow grease to drain. Used panko soaked in the milk. Adjusted seasonings to our taste. Will always use as my basic meatball recipe!

These meatballs are so good! I doubled the recipe for my family of 3 and by lunch the next day they were gone! The only thing is, they are a bit spicy, which I loved but my 7 year old needed a few drinks lol. Next time I will add just a dash of red pepper flakes since this time I cut it in half and it was still a bit spicy. My husband raved about them to his co workers which he never does! I was skeptical since there were no eggs in the recipe but I learned meatballs are much better without eggs. Thanks for sharing them!

Best meatballs I've EVER tasted--bar none.  I used a mango habanero sauce (I had run out of Frank's Hot), and it was amazing.  Even my one year old inhaled them, spicy kick et al!  Nirvana indeed.  Bravo!  And thank you :)

I love this recipe. Been making it for years now and I do exactly what the recipe says. When I have the time I make homemade spaghetti sauce from "Linda's Lasagna" recipe. Its delicious for meatball subs too.

WOW! These meatballs had a bite to them but a perfect bite to them. I also used turkey meat which I believe always has a unique taste alone, we loved these meatballs and will make them again and again! I suggest ground lean turkey meat to try atleast once gives it a whole different taste.

Before I try any new recipe, I always read the ingredients very carefully. If there are ratings and reviews, all the better to read before I begin making the recipe. This is one reason allrecipes.com is my top site for recipes and food ideas, because they also provide reviews and comments. I did not change this recipe at all, which is how I try and start all new recipes, as it looked very basic and good to me. And it was very good. Husband loved them. I did not turn them, nor make any ingredient substitutions. They did have a slight peppery, hot bite but not much at all and I thought that made for a more complex flavor and liked that. I made a double batch so I am pleased that I liked them very much. Only changes next time would be to dice the onions more finely and try Panko crumbs, which is my personal favorite for bread crumbs. This one goes in My Cookbook!

Little crunchy on the outside, perfect on the inside.  Kids ate them plain and loved them. Husband and I had them with marinara.  Great recipe.  Next time will double recipe and freeze half.

Yep - this was a hit.  Forgot the onions and milk but did add several garlic cloves, slowly sautéed the meatballs in a little olive oil and drenched them with marinara sauce when they were just about done. Make super yummy meatball sandwiches.  Delicious!  Highly recommend.

I love these meatballs. Simply the best, you can't go wrong making these. I love that I can bake them instead of frying them like my mom always did growing up. The texture is perfect and the flavor is awesome. My staple for making meatballs from now on. 100% happy over here!

Love love love!  This is very similar to the way I have made meatballs, but the addition of Worcestershire and crushed red pepper flakes really gave it a kick.  Thanks!

Made a couple small changes..half ground beef, half mild or hot Italian sausage and instead of skim milk, I used evaporated milk.  These things are addictive.  We love them with a favorite from scratch sauce (yeah, the one that takes all day) but equally as good with another favorite right out of the jar!  These meatballs make the best meatball subs smothered in provolone and any sauce you choose. I have doubled the recipe and after shaping into meatballs, put them on a cookie sheet and froze them, then put them into freezer safe bags so I could take out as many or as few as needed for me and DH or for when the gangs all here.  Positively perfect meatballs!!

I used a veal, sausage, and beef mix and it was delicious!!  Loved the kick with pepper flakes and Sriracha...so yummy marinara and fettuccine noodles. Delish!!

Made these for my husband last night, and overall he thought they were delicious. I will make a couple of changes next time - the amount of onions seemed excessive, I left some out and even then it felt like a bit too much. Perhaps using the dried minced onion would solve this problem. Also, we expected them to have more spice to them than they did, so next time I will put in a bigger dash of hot sauce, and probably some pepper also. But overall, they were easy to make (never made meatballs before), and the cooking instructions were spot on.

This is a very good basic meatball recipe.  I thought it got to be a little bit much though with the Italian seasoning AND the oregano, so I think next time I will leave out the extra oregano and maybe even cut back on the Italian seasoning a bit to suit my taste.

The only difference for me is that I use about half Italian sausage and half ground turkey. I also substituted ricotta cheese for the milk.

I modified the recipe a bit to suit my tastes and they turned out spectacular!  I left out the Italian seasoning and oregano as my bread crumbs were "Italian seasoned."  I used the equivalent of two cloves of fresh minced garlic, onion flakes instead of fresh onion, and I cut the Worchestershire sauce down to 3/4 Tbsp, and cut the red pepper flakes down to 1/2 tsp.  The hot sauce I used was Crystals.  They taste delicious without adding them to any marina sauce I may eat them all plain!

Perfect meatballs.  I don't use these for my italian dishes (family recipe, sorry), but for meatball subs or snack trays, they're amazing.

Thank you LTH! This is a meatball recipe to end all meatball recipes, a keeper. I did not have breadcrumbs so I threw a handful of croutons in the food processor and used that instead. I did turn them over at the ten minute mark as they were Browning nicely and wanted to keep it even. Didn't have oregano or hot sauce on hand so threw in another pinch of Italian seasoning. Heck I only had about a tablespoon of parmesan and these still turned out amazing.Kept their shape (a problem with other recipes I have tried-a meatball does not an egg need) served on toasted French bread for the finest meatball sub in the land. Thanks again, end product was happy husband and kids were in a state of nirvana...meatball nirvana.

We definitely like these meatballs.  Made them to go along with a veggie lasagna and crusty bread.  I pretty much follow the recipe; no hot sauce; sometimes sub ground turkey.  Delicious!  Note:  don't overcook them, or they'll turn out dry.

My 46-year-old husband has disliked meatballs all his life... thought they were too bland. No more! He loves these meatballs. In fact he raved about them. I followed the recipe exactly, and served with marinara/pasta. Delish! (Note: spray your pan with PAM before baking the meatballs.)

My first time making meatballs and they were OUT OF THIS WORLD!! I made a bigger portion and followed some of the other reviewers suggestions, i.e. Ricotta instead of milk and used pork as well as ground beef. I adjusted the recipe for double serving and will keep this recipe forever!! I gave four stars because I believe the suggestions helped to make this as delicious as it was

My husband is a big fan of meatballs but we can never seem to find a recipe that he truly likes. I gave this one a shot one night and my husband was in love! We left out the hot pepper sauce and red pepper flakes so the kids could have them too. This is a family favorite in this household!

Wonderful meatballs with a KICK! I reduced the amount of red pepper flakes to 1/4 tsp and they still had a nice spiciness to them. Didn't change anything else. I made them twice in two weeks, and all who tried them gave rave reviews. Hubby loved them so much he said he would pay to eat them in a restaurant. They also won out over his sister's meatballs, which have been his lifelong favorites. Shhhh....don't tell her!!

Awesome meatballs. Use the leanest beef you can find, cut the onion by half and make sure to chop it finely. The hot sauce I used was ghost pepper sauce and it only needed a few drops.

I did have to leave out the spicy stuff due to personal preference, but I liked this recipe.  My former meatball recipe used cream of mushroom soup so I liked that this one bypassed that and used less processed stuff.  I served these at a work function and they were totally gone!  Since I was serving them "plain" and not on pasta, I added a slice of mozzarella on top while they cooked. Soooo yummy!

Delicious and pretty easy to make.  I make them without the hot sauce (simply because its not something I typically have in the house) and they still have a good amount of kick from the crushed red pepper.

I tried this and they were amazing!!  I used a combination of ground beef, pork & veal. They were so tender and would almost melt in your mouth. I did a few things differently but either way this is sure a winner in our household :-)

Love the burn.  Crushed red pepper provides just enough heat to make these meatballs unforgettable. If you are serving red wine with this recipe I'd avoid heavier wines like cabernet, malbec and shiraz because they accentuate the burn.

I thought they taste great. Made it almost exactly as written, but I didn't have skim milk, so had to use whole milk. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I thought they were too soft. I like a bit of crunch on my meatballs. But I remedied that situation by putting them in a hot pan on the stove. Gave it a great crispy skin, and soft in the middle. Great recipe :)

I made this recipe last night. It was one of the lightest and delicious meatballs I've ever had! Perhaps because I made them, but nonetheless here is how I prepared them - I doubled the recipe, using 1 lb of organic ground beef and 1 lb organic ground chuck. I followed the recipe for the most part but used siracha hot sauce (we like it hot hot hot) I doubled the amount of herbs and pepper flakes used. Used one big fat onion and put a whole head of garlic in the beef. They were fantastic! It made about 35 meatballs, great for freezing and using for another occasion.

I used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt and followed a reviewer's suggestion of using ricotta rather than milk. These were delicious.

Delish!  The whole family liked them.  Very moist and good flavor.  I think I'll try putting the onions on the food processor next time to even out the texture.

I love these meatballs! I've tried a few different recipes and was never particularly excited about any of them . . . until I found this one. Really great flavor. It's probably the hot sauce and chili flakes that make it stand out, and those are things I generally don't cook with and/or use with caution as I'm not a fan of super spicy foods, but these are not spicy at all. I've used this recipe a couple of times and also had my teenage daughter make it once. I've don't have an "italian seasoning" blend so I just put in the italian seasonings what I have, such as oregano, basil, and garlic powder. I have made it with regular bread crumbs (usually plain) and panko breadcrumbs and both work well. I never buy skim milk, so use whatever I have, either whole or 2%. I generally never measure anything and they always seem turn out great. I think they're hard to mess up. ;) I'm making some tonight and think I'll double the recipe and freeze some.

These were delicious except my oven got too hot and they came out a tad well done on top, my fault.  Had to make a few substitutions due to what was on hand, but this was the first time I made meatballs and used no egg as a binder! Keeper!

Wonderful!  Hollowed out a hoagie roll.  Two meatballs per roll, sauce, and mozzarella cheese.  Toasted rolls first....soooo delicious.  Froze the last few meatballs and looking forward to a quick and easy weeknight meal in the future.  6/28/13

We really enjoyed this. I did add some lean ground pork sausages (casings removed) to the hamburger mixture.  Everything else made as is.  Such a good meatball recipe.  Paired this with the Best Marinara Sauce Yet recipe by Jackie.

I used ground turkey instead of beef.  I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  I did not use the hot sauce as we like things a bit less spicy.  I also doubled the recipe.  They were delicious and I am looking forward to making them again.  I made the meatballs in the morning and stored them covered in the refrigerator until dinner.  This made for a very simple meal that I served with a spinach salad.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used this recipe for my first time making meatballs, and I am very happy with the results. I substituted heavy whipping cream for milk (I had a lot of it) and Vietnamese chili garlic sauce for hot sauce (it's all I had in the way of a hot sauce), and the meatballs were delicious. If you want a little extra kick to your meatballs, I would recommend adding 1/3rd to 1/4th of a teaspoon of the chili garlic sauce.

Great meatball recipe. I've done this twice now; once with ground meat and once with a combo of ground chicken and turkey. Both were outstanding. I usually make a milder marinara sauce and these meatballs had just enough spice in them to make them hot, but not too hot. The second time I also added a little bit (about 1/2 tsp) of crushed fennel. Good move on my part.

I suck at making meatballs, and this recipe was so wonderful you can smell the garlic in the meatballs even after they are frozen!  Can either bake them or fry them after making.

Yummy recipe. Very easy to make. I used 80% ground beef instead and also used fresh minced garlic instead of powder. I served as a sandwich on Italian hero topped with mozzerela cheese and marinara sauce. Beware if you don't like spicy stay away from this recipe. I happen to love it and my hubby too:)

These were quite tasty!  However, I found them a bit too salty. I would cut back on the salt by half next time. With the Worcestershire sauce, cheese, and garlic salt (although I didn't use garlic salt), AND presumably tomato sauce on top, the sodium is through the roof! Other than that, my family loved them. Will make again! Thanks for sharing.

I made these a few weeks ago, and I precooked them in the oven then finished them in the crockpot, amazing! Also I froze half of the original batch when they came out of the oven and pulled them out yesterday, to go along with a fresh batch and was pleased at how well they tasted even after being frozen! I could not tell which ones were freshly made. This is a winner, thank you!

I think this recipe is okay, they only downfall I have found is there is no fat in the meatballs and if u want a moist meatball it needs to contain fat. I use a half pound of hot sausage, use an egg instead of milk and use 80/20 ground beef. Once you cook in the oven, the fat drains off anyway. Other than that this is a good recipe

The boys loved these! They were easy, I like that I didn't have to have eggs to make them and even though I had to make some adjustments (toasted bread turned into bread crumbs since we were out) and leaving out the spicy stuff (red pepper) to keep it okay for little people these were great. I doubled the recipe and stuck the extras in the freezer for another day. It made 32 meatballs for me! Will make again!

These meatballs have a great flavor.  My only complaint is that they stuck to the pan.  I recommend spraying the pan with nonstick cooking spray.  Just a tip, I made the mistake of placing the finished meatballs in a pot of marinara sauce.  The meatballs started falling apart because they are very soft.  Next time I won't add them to the sauce.  Other than these two things, they were excellent.

We love these meatballs! I've made them for our family so many times. I've started making a double batch so I can freeze half of them (fully-cooked). All in all, they are excellent and I'll be keeping this recipe around forever.

I have made these once and will make again, they were pretty good, lighter in texture than most. I like to bake mine too, and freeze what I don't use.  I like to bake them on a parchment paper lined jellyroll pan. I let them cool and freeze them overnight on the pan, pop them into a vacuum bag, toss the paper, and clean-up is done.

I have made these meatballs at least 10 times, and stick to the recipe for the most part.  The only thing I may change is that sometimes I will use turkey,  beef, and add some sausage in too.  But as far as the other ingredients, I don't change a thing. I triple the recipe everytime, so that I can freeze some...they are that good.  Have always gotten rave reviews!

I used Italian breadcrumbs and added some minced garlic (the jarred kind and drizzled some of the juice in as well). I would recommend dicing the onions into itty-bitty pieces otherwise your meatballs look like they have tumors. I cooked on 400 for 11 minutes and then down to 385 and threw in a loaf of ciabatta. I then cut off a chunk of ciabatta, sliced it in half, sprinkled on Provel (yes, Provel, not provolone)and more minced garlic and heated up tomato sauce from The Hill. Then I sliced two meatballs in half, placed on burn-the-roof-of-your-mouth Provel cheesy bread and smothered in tomato sauce. Mmmmm. Almost as good as Fassi's.

These were absolutely divine!  The entire family enjoyed these.  Even my picky 8 year old gave this a thumbs up.  The only change I made was to use half ground beef and half ground pork.

HUBBY LOVED THESE!  I expected my husband to tell me that these meatballs were not seasoned to his liking since there is no Lawry's Seasoned Salt in them. However, he ate 6-8 of these immediately(I made smaller meatballs) and the next day asked me to make more.  He would go into the fridge and pop the cold meatballs for a high-protein snack and within 3 days he'd finished the batch!  I only had 4 of them!  I'm making a triple batch today so I can freeze some.

I thought I followed the recipe, but maybe I added a little more red pepper flakes than suggested, because they were SPICY! My husband and I loved them -- very flavorful!

Yummy! Made as instructed except for excluded the hot sauce and used a little less than a 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper instead of red pepper flakes.

I liked these meat balls, I will cut the onion way down the next time I make them, that was the only negative reply I received from my family....too much onion, and we like onion!  easy very tasty, I think they will be great in a meatball sandwich.

I did tweak this recipie a bit.  I knew 12 meatballs would only last about an hour in my house and I wanted some for the freezer. I added 1 lb. of italian sausage and 1 lb of veal.  I read an article where it said that a good meatball contained all three meats.  

I also took another reviewers suggestion and used riccotta instead of milk.

I trippled all of the spices and cheese and cooked for 20 minutes.

These are the bomb and I will make them again!

Wow, these are good! I have always purchased 'homemade meatballs' from the gourmet section of our local grocer since they were better than my recipe...until these! They have a ton of flavor and my husband and kids loved them too. I added a tablespoon of ricotta as one reviewer mentioned and they were nice and moist. They do have quite a bit of kick from the red pepper flakes and hot sauce (I used chipotle), but not too much. Just enough to keep wanting more! If you're not into spice, then maybe just a dash for some flavor without the heat. Thanks for the great recipe! I'll have to make them in a big batch next time!

I first made this recipe about two years ago. Since then I've remade it dozens of times. My family loves it. I've played with it, using white bread instead of the bread crumbs and it always turns out great. We like them plain but we've also eaten them with pasta and marinara sauce. They have a bit of a bite and we like that. I'd say they were named correctly!

This is by far the best meatball recipe EVER!  I can't stop eating them. My picky teenager (the one who doesn't eat anything unless it will survive the nuclear holocaust) will eat them!
I added an egg, and substituted 1/2 turkey for the hamburger.  I tripled the batch, cooked as directed, and froze them.  Works very well, and now we are never without yummy meatballs!

I love this recipe!! I discovered it a couple months ago and have been "addicted" ever since! I changed up the recipe a little and instead of baking them, I put them in a saucepan with broth and put it over noodles. YUM! This recipe is a keeper! :)

Love this recipe! My Italian friends agree that this has that authentic flavor! I used parmesan flakes to give a nice cheesy pull with every bite! Also tried a 1/4 cup milk and a 1/4 cup sour cream.. Made them a little fluffier :)

We loved these! They will now be my go-to meatball recipe. I made them as-is and didn't tweak the recipe beyond being liberal with the spicy stuff -- we like our food with a kick in the face.

These are the best homemade meatballs I've ever had - and I come from a long background of Italian food snobs!  I have made substitutions several times, depending on what I might have available at the time.  I've made them with venison, beef, beef/pork combo - and they are all delicious!  (I would rec a little pork or heavy cream with the venison to increase the juiciness).  My kids will burn their little fingers stealing these off the pan while the meat rests!

Such a good meatball recipe!! Next time I will scale down the hotness. Both my kiddies complained they were too spicy. If you like spice...they are awesome! My husband and I loved them :)

This is a 5 star recipe! I did have to alter the recipe a bit but it turned out fantastic. I did not add any hot sauce and used 3 garlic cloves instead of garlic salt. I also added a heaping table spoon of Ricotta.

We loved the flavor but ours came out a bit dry...the only change was that I had Italian style panko bread crumbs, which shouldn't really change them.. Humm any ideas on how to moisten them up since I plan to make them again this week.

I don't eat beef, but wanted some good meatballs for my beef-eating family. I used panko crumbs because they are just simple ingredients: wheat flour, dextrose, yeast, salt (the regular bread crumbs were made of bread containing high fructose corn syrup and lots of additives). Like LTH suggested, I also used dried minced onion to omit the step of chopping an onion. I was out of milk, so I used 2 eggs and a splash of half 'n' half in a triple recipe. Froze the leftovers. My family says they're WAY better than store-bought frozen meatballs!! Thanks LTH!

Used this recipe as my base. Modifications I made are: used 1/2 lean beef and 1/2 ground pork, deleted sea salt and garlic salt (but used garlic and onion powder) and used a mix of fresh grated parmesan and romano cheeses. I baked at 350 degrees for about 40 minutes in a baking dish of my homemade spaghetti sauce.

fantastic!  Used A-1 b/c no worcestershire sauce.  Added pizza sauce poured over top of meatballs & w/ 5 min. left added Italian cheese blend over sauce.  = AWESOME!  Pizza Meatballs w/ some zip made my husband's mouth water for more.

To make Gluten Free- we used crushed almond crackers in lieu of bread crumbs.  Still was Yummy yummy!!!

I used this recipe for the first time yesterday to make spaghetti and meatballs. I didn't have any Worcestershire sauce, which I know for a fact would have been great, but the meatballs turned out awesome. My friends loved them!

Perfectly easy and tasty meatball recipe! I ran out of bread crumbs (I was making this with 5# of meat! Yielding around 150 meatballs) so I subbed some Ritz crackers. Using a cookie scoop to form the meatballs is a quick trick to uniform size. I also like to bake them on a cooling rack over a foil-lined pan; it was about 20 minutes for the size of ball I made. After cooling completely, I popped them in the freezer for a week or two. After spending the morning on low in the crockpot, covered with sauce, they were thawed and ready to eat! They went over very well at the party!

Great receipe, a little spicy for my younger children but overall wonderful.  I will be making these again, but pulling out theirs before adding the "hot".

Very yummy! I made these for the first time tonight. While they were baking, the whole house smelled wonderful. The Worcestershire sauce and red pepper flakes really make these taste fantastic. I would suggest spraying the pan, even if it's lined with aluminum foil. (My meatballs stuck to the foil a bit.) I will use this recipe again, maybe with something besides pasta sauce.

This is my go to meatball recipe now. Always makes a delicious, moist meatball.  I do add an egg for extra protein, and I subbed yogurt for milk since I had extra on hand (plain).

Very tasty meatball recipe. This was the recipe I used for my first homemade meatballs and I loved how simple and tasty they came out! I ended up adding mushrooms, crushed red peppers, and minced garlic to these and they came out so good! Just make your favorite pasta sauce and you are all good to go!

I cut back a little on the salt and used lean ground turkey and they turned out great. They did stick a bit to the baking sheet, so I would oil the sheet first next time. Great recipe!

These were ok. Since we do not like spicy, I left out the red pepper flakes which may have been why I could taste oregano.

I having been using this recipe (with the alteration of 1/2 pork and 1/2 beef) for a while. My family loves these covered in blueberry jelly w/a touch of allspice. I know it sounds weird, but give it a try when you want something other than the usual pasta sauce route!

I can't stop making this recipe! To die for! So delicious! I always double it with the intention of freezing some, but they never make it to the freezer! I skip the worcestershire sauce and add more crushed red peppers. Spicy! Delicious in spaghetti, on a roll or on their own!

Awesome recipe as is! I first tried it because my husband is allergic to eggs, and I didn't miss them in this recipe. Since then, I've also tried it substituting 3/4 turkey and 1/4 breakfast sausage (what I had on hand) and it was really delicious too. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is my all time favorite recipe for meatballs. If you don't like to much spice go lite on the red pepper but don't leave it out that's what makes it is so good. I make this at least once a month it has so much flavor.

This was my first time making meatballs but these turned out pretty good. Sadly we ate so much today for Superbowl Sunday that we only had enough room to try a meatball. I'll add more or edit this once I make meatball sandwiches from the meatballs. Thanks for a good and easy recipe :)

I'll add to the choir - these are the best meatballs I've ever had. I followed the recipe to the letter and they came out perfect. I have been doubling the recipe since the first batch since many of them are eaten prior to serving them for dinner due to taste tests for "quality control" - they are just that addictive. Thanks for sharing this, lovestohost!

Delicious!  I made these with ground Turkey, used less than one T of Worchestershire because it is all I had & did not have red pepper flakes so used ground red pepper (about 1/2 tsp) & they were really good.  Will definitely be making these again!

ABSOLUTE WINNER. I make this almost every week, i left out the hot sauce because the onion and the red pepper flakes already make it spicy enough for us... But my bf asks for it by name... he calls it "Crazy exploding onion meatballs" Totally recommend it!

Excellent. Perfect, tender, and tasty. 

I've experimented with a variety of meatball recipes but this is the new family favorite. They cleaned the pan. Not a single meatball left which is a win in my cookbook.

So delicious! I skipped the onion because I didn't have one, used egg instead of milk and skipped the hot sauce. Everything came out great. This will be my new meatball recipe for sure.

Too hot for me, but just right for the guys. I doubled the recipe. I will halve the crushed red pepper flakes or leave it out all together next time. Has a very good texture and moisture content, as well as being easy.

Great recipe!  As suggested by others I used ricotta cheese instead of milk, and found a ground beef/veal/pork mix recommended for meatballs at the store so used that.  Delicious!

These are the best meatballs I have ever had!!! So delicious. Crispy on the outside, beautifully tender on the inside - they melt in your mouth. The flavours blend very well together. Fabulous recipe, thank you!

Really enjoyed these!  Our usual meatball recipe is done on the stovetop, so, these are nice in that you don't have to stand about turning them all the time.  :)  We liked them just fine as is, but, do swap a few things from time to time, such as changing up the cheese to Swiss or mozzarella, just for variety.  We grind the red pepper flakes a bit as they can be a bit crunchy, not a texture we prefer.  We also up the "spicy" with some extra hot sauce, a little cayenne, or some finely-chopped jalapeno peppers.  Good go-to recipe.

Yummy meatballs, very easy to make though I burned the bottom of the balls, forgot to flip them (and I always seem to burn everything anyways). I made a few changes, used an egg instead of the milk, and crushed up Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs as I didn't have any. I added lots of hot sauce and I will definitely be making them again.

Oh my goodness. This recipe is easy and delicious. I need to remember to triple and freeze because this would be such a tasty fast meal. I do need to put something under the meatballs to catch the grease in my oven (it drips off a flat cookie sheet without sides). We enjoy with pasta and red sauce the first day and use the meatballs with sauce on hoagies with provolone the next. Yummy!

Very good, well worth the effort!  I have tried several meatball recipes and this one is at the top.  My mother was the meatball maker in the family, and I never got the recipe.  Now I have a recipe I am proud to serve.

This is an excellent recipe!  I don't eat beef but I made it for my family, I love to cook and I always try everything that I make, and I thought they were to die for! I did add 1 egg to the recipe and it was perfect!  My compliments to the chief :)  I will be passing this on!

Overall these were very good.  I suggest running the onion through a food processor rather than dicing.  The onion pieces are a bit too big for my liking.

I have made these twice. Kids just love them. The only change I will make next time is to use red pepper powder or hot sauce so that no 'surprise' of biting into crushed peppers.

This was just 'ok' to me. For all the effort you put in, I really thought these were going to be great. Unfortunately, they were very 'bready'. That being said, if you like bready meatballs or meatloaf, the flavor was fine. If you don't, then cut that back considerably or choose another recipe.

These were fantastic meatballs!  I used ground turkey and doubled the recipe and had no leftovers.  The spices were perfect with the ground turkey.  I'm interested to try this with ground beef, also.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

These meatballs were quite good.  I made them and placed them on a cookie sheet in the freezer til frozen then transferred them into a ziploc bag.  Just took 9 meatballs out and put them in the toaster oven at 350 for 30 minutes before heating up some tomato sauce to make sandwiches.  A few modifications:  
- Because I want to make them for meatball sandwiches, I didn't make them completely round.  I just flattened them a bit, so they'd fit better in the bread
- I had to leave out the peppers and hot sauce to appease the kids. I'm sure they taste great with the peppers, but even without the sauce, I found it to be tasty
- I have also increased the amount of onions, carmelized them and then added them in once cooled.  Otherwise, if using raw, I'll mince instead of dice. When I tried dicing, I thought the onions were a bit overpowering.

When it comes to meatballs, I associate "Italian" with it and in keeping an open mind, I would say this meatball has a good flavor as a mid-western or southern meatball because of the Worcheshire sauce, ground red pepper and hot sauce.  But, as an Italian, I prefer my hubby's Italian meatball recipe he learned from his mother.

Must say these were delish! Got rave reviews last night when I served these with homemade pasta and sauce. Great meatballs! I sub'd lean turkey and 99% lean ground pork for the beef. Moist, tender meatballs were the result. Some went in the sauce some saved for today...good both ways.

Good recipe! I used 96% lean ground beef, doubled the recipe, used half garlic salt and half garlic powder, used 1 egg and 1/3 cup vegetable juice instead of milk. Turned out flavorful and got great reviews from the family.

It was so good! I did add pork to it and I didn't have all the spices it called for. Best. Meatball. Ever. Love the kick from the hot sauce and pepper flakes! Thank you for the experience!

This is my go-to meatball recipe for spaghetti and meatballs.  I've tried so many recipes, but now have been using this one for a couple of years now.  I've made them with all beef, beef & venison mix, and a beef & pork mix.  All excellent! The only thing I usually change up is that I use gluten free breadcrumbs.  Also, I just use whatever milk we have on hand (usually cream or whole milk).

The whole family loved them!I used them in spagetti and sauce. I also used ground turkey instead (since we're trying to eat healthier)and took another reviewer's advice to substitute the skim milk for an egg. I also skipped on the bread crumbs (didn't have any on hand)but they still came out delicious. Definitely keeping this recipe for future meals!

My family loved this! I left out the peppered ingredients bc my 6YO is sensitive to it yet my hubby thrives on spice. So I just made two separate plates.No complaints. BUT I made it with bison.

We used veggie "meat" to make meatballs for a sandwich.  These were fantastic.  Just the right amount of flavor and kick and very simple to put together with common ingredients.  We will use this all the time.

Yes this is a great meatball recipe. Just do it. I had no parm but they were delicious. I am sure they would be great with half pork as well. There is something about making great meatballs that always impresses people :)

I followed some past reviews and did half ground pork and half ground beef. Next time I'll either chop the onion finer (a little too crunchy for my taste but it could have been the size of my meatballs) or substitute onion powder. This was the most flavorful and moist meatball recipe I've tried so far. Made a double batch and froze extra to go in the crockpot with some marinara for an easy weeknight meal. Delish!

This recipe has become my husbands all time favorite meal.  I also substitute an egg for the milk.  Once the meatballs are browned I put them in the slow cooker covered with mushrooms and marinara sauce on low for 4-6 hours.  It is a meal to die for! I can't thank you enough for this recipe.

We made this just the way prepared except for omitting the hot sauce, and it's a good thing we did. With the hot pepper flakes, it was just the perfect amount of "kick," and they were very tasty and flavorful. I cooked them as directed, then warmed up some pasta sauce and served on meatball subs with melted cheese on top. Good recipe - thanks, LTH!

UPDATE: Made these again the other night for my mom and brother, again in meatball subs. My boyfriend, who had just had them two nights before, came over and sneaked a sub too. I did not have any left over!

These are delicious and easy to make. I used sage instead of oregano, and an egg instead of milk. I had one immediately in a sandwich and froze the rest for later use. I would definitely use this recipe again.

This is my go to meatball recipe! The only change I make is I use an egg instead of the milk (just my preference), and sometimes I do ground turkey to make it a bit healthier. Yum!

These are the best meatballs! I didn't have panko breadcrumbs, so I used crushed saltine crackers and omitted the additional salt. I adjusted the crushed red pepper flakes and hot sauce to my taste. Great recipe.

Love these meatballs so much! We followed the recipe as is except for the following: 
We substituted dehydrated minced onions for fresh cut, because my son likes onions as long as he doesn't see them. 
I cut the red pepper flakes back to 1/2 teaspoon, because I'm a wuss. After tasting them I realized we could have gone with the whole 3/4s.
So good! Today we had meatball sandwiches for lunch with the leftovers. Yum.

Duh-licious.  Juicy and flavorful with just the right amount of heat.   Double batch with half frozen for later use is the way to go.  And def.  use fresh minced garlic.  Yum.

Was amazed at the flavor these meatballs have.  Family requests them weekly.  My husband can't handle the heat so I omit the hot sauce and cut the pepper flakes back. There are never any leftovers!

These were absolutely divine...

I customized by adding the following...

1 egg
1/4 teaspoon of Adobo
4 minced garlic cloves
1 tablespoon Honey Teriyaki Marinade
1/4 teaspoon GrillMates Steak Rub
Fresh Ground Pepper to taste
Fistful of Chopped Onions and Green Peppers

A little extra Italian breadcrumbs and pinch of cornstarch for firmness....

They were out of this world....
Bravo!

I don't really cook that often but when I do it is usually because I'm entertaining guests.  I made these for a family function yesterday and they were a big seller.  The meatballs were super easy to make and very tastey. I'd definitely use this recipe again.

These meatalls are very tasty and very easy to make.  Stupidly easy. The only change I would make next time is to reduce the onion.  I love onion but at 4 servings, I found "1 small onion" to be too much.  Maybe an actual measurement (i.e. 1/4 cup) would be helpful?  I baked mine as directed then I put them in the pasta sauce on low for another hour to soak up the sauce.  Definitely worth making!

Made this last night for meatball sandwiches and it was the best recipe for meatballs I have made to date. They were tender, tasteful, and just a little spicy. They have now become my goto meatball recipe!

These were really yummy! My husband and I both prefer are meat slightly drier, so we broiled them in the oven for just a couple minutes after they were done cooking to lose some of the moisture. Wonderful! Will make these with my spaghetti all the time!

Very spicy, but very good.  Next time I'll use less red pepper and a milder hot sauce.  My husband liked the heat though, so I have to give the recipe 5 stars.

How anybody could not rate these 5 stars is out of their mind! I am a mediocre cook at best and made these for my girlfriend and they turned out beautifully. So rich in flavor and so easy. I made a triple batch and froze the rest of the meat and ate on it for about a week straight.

Awesome recipe! This is now my go to meatball recipe and I have made it at least 20 times in the past year.  My kids and husband love this little kick these have.  I like to add a lot of hot sauce, but we like things spicy. I also like to simmer them in the pasta sauce for a while before serving.  I love baking the meatballs instead of pan frying, it really cuts down the grease. Thank you for such a great recipe!

I doubled the receipe, omitted the salt, used real garlic, 1/2 the oregano and no red per flakes (per all of the other reviews).  Outstanding!  I'll definitely make again!

So good and so easy, using everyday ingredients that I always have.  My husband, who is not a fan of meatballs (for some odd reason- weirdo) loved these and plans to sub them for sausage in the yummy red sauce he makes. Subs- I used an egg instead of milk, siracha instead of Frank's, and left out the breadcrumbs because I eat low carb.

Just made these - my first time making homemade meatballs! They turned out GREAT, despite the fact that I didn't have any Worcestershire sauce. Only change I made was to add one minced garlic clove instead of garlic salt. This one's going in the recipe box!

I absolutely love these meatballs!  They were my first attempt at meatballs ever.  I made them with ground turkey and made a few (very few) swaps in ingredients because I didn't have what I needed, but overall kept almost exactly the same.  SO good!  
I agree they are a little spicy, which I love, but I might use a little less red pepper flakes when making them for my toddler.
Overall - fantastic!

My first attempt at meatballs. Turned out great only alteration was using fresh garlic vs granulated and cooked them in the oven then finished them in sauce. Loved the flavor and spice. Wife found them to be a little too spicy. 11 year old loved them.

I've re-read this recipe about 10 times trying to figure out what went wrong because these are just plain boring and unoriginal.  I omitted the red pepper flakes and hot sauce, and used a dash of cayenne instead, but there is no way a little extra spice can fix this.  Probably not worth the effort to tweak...think I'll just try a different recipe next time.

AWESOME!! The only thing I changed was that I left out the red pepper and pepper sauce bc we don't like things too hot. Other than that I prepared them exactly as written. I will definitely make again and again!

Great, simple recipe. Made 'em for the in-laws, even our 3yr old liked them. She'd like them more if they were a little less spicey. I'd like more. But that's the great thing about this recipe, the ingredients can be varied and altered without fear of the end results.

These were really good and easy to make.  I left out hot sauce and next time I'll go easy on the pepper flakes (personal preference-don't like spicy food!).

Wow!  I hate meatballs, these were the best!  Instead of milk I used one egg and homemade breadcrumbs.
The whole family said that these were the best meatballs they have eaten.  A keeper!  Thx for sharing

I've made this several times.  Tonight I used half beef and half pork.  I use very little red pepper flake and no hot sauce.  Tonight I was out of Worcestershire sauce!  Who runs out of that!  Instead I used A1 sauce and they turned out great.  I double the recipe and freeze half.  I use with spaghetti and for meatball hoagies.

I cook these meatballs exactly like the recipe says and they are a hit for 10 or 80 people.  I have noticed they are really "spicy meatballs" if I use Cholula versus Red Hot. It's really delicious with hot Italian sausage and a good homemade sauce.

These were one of the best meatballs I've made. I didn't feel like chopping up onion and my boyfriend is not a big fan of onion so I substituted with a little bit of onion salt.  I used cayenne pepper instead of franks red hot sauce because i didn't have any on hand.  As another reviewer stated i subbed the milk for 1 egg with no problem.  I also filled the meatballs with mozzerella cheese and cooked them in a skillet with some oil.  They would be even better if they were stuffed with mozzerella and ricotta cheese!

FABULOUS!!! Best Recipe I've come across, followed recipe as written. Very tasty!  My 2nd go around I did change one thing, used spicy pork sausage and Hamb, 50/50. Added another level of flavor, my new go to recipe for meatballs. Doesn't matter what you use them in, spaghetti, sandwiches with marinara, I even used them in Swedish meatballs!

This came out great. I think onions should be minced not diced. And i substituted olive oil for skim milk. Absolutely fantastic.

I did a 2:1 ratio of ground chuck/ground pork for these and they were amazing!  Will definitely be making a double batch soon to freeze for quick meals in the future.

These are delicious!  I used oatmeal instead of the bread crumbs because I don't care for the bread crumb texture.  Also, line your baking sheet with parchment paper so the meatballs don't stick.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Loved.  I didn't have onion, so I used onion powder and added a little EVOO to the mix.  And a tiny bit more red pepper.  Excellent!

This just didn't reach a state of nirvana for us.  It was sort of bland and not enough flavoring.

This recipe was wonderful! I made it tonight for guests and everyone loved them. I omitted the hot sauce (didn't have any) and didn't use garlic salt, just garlic powder, but other than that, left the ingredients the same. I made breadcrumbs from scratch out of wheat bread. I made the meatballs a bit smaller, coming out with a batch of about 18-20 from a pound. I baked for 17 minutes and then finished by cooking them in a homemade sauce. I really like that this recipe doesn't use egg (BF has an allergy) and makes delicious meatballs that hold together!I would definitely make these again.

Most excellent.  I usually don't like meatballs but decided to try this out for a friend.  They blew me away!  I covered them in warm Stubbs barbeque sauce and the flavorful spiciness was perfect.

One tip: Make sure your onions are diced small as possible.  Otherwise they stick out, look unseemly, and tend to fall apart.

Update 3/8/2016: Four years later and this is still my favorite meatball recipe. I have since made it exactly as the recipe states and it is excellent! I made a double batch a couple years ago for a family holiday potluck/party, and I served it in marinara sauce with French bread on the side and it was gone in no time, everyone loved these meatballs. I made them again tonight, and they are ridiculously quick to make and cook, even on a weeknight! 
Original review: So I usually buy the pre-made meatballs from Whole Foods butcher section, that you cook yourself, and today was no different. But when I got to the butcher section, they had no meatballs! Luckily, they had lean grass-fed bef on sale, so I picked up a pound, knowing I'd be able to find a great recipe on Allrecipes! This recipe was my final choice, for several reasons: a) it's egg-free (food sensitivities on my part) b) it's simple, made with stuff I generally have on hand and c)they're baked. That said, I was missing a couple ingredients. I forgot to pick up milk when shopping, I had no Worcestershire sauce on hand, and the only breadcrumbs I usually have around are panko. These were my workarounds - I used water in place of milk, and added some veggie bullion paste that has a similar flavor to Worcestershire sauce to the water. I added the veggie bullion water to the panko, to moisten it, then added it to the meat mixture and mixed well. What I noticed is that the raw mixture smelled very similar to the meatballs I

Sooo good! Although I didn't have Italian seasoning so I used some basil and more oregano. I also didn't have breadcrumbs- instead I used a few slices of bread broken up and mixed it with the milk.

These were delicious.  I followed the recipe ingredients wise, except for substituting an egg for the milk, then instead of baking them, I made the meatballs smaller, fried them to make them crispy on the outside, then simmered them in spaghetti sauce for a 1/2 hour to let them fully cook.  Delicious!

these are delicious! I used 1/2 quick oats instead of the bread crumbs and onion powder instead of chopped onions as I didn't have time to chop them.  I used them with our favorite homemade BBQ sauce.  This recipe is a keeper!

Amazing recipe. Having tasted these, I regret all my wasted time in life eating inferior meatballs. Super savory and great firm texture.

   I used unseasoned bread crumbs, parsley and basil in place of italian seasoning, two eggs and a touch of cream in place of milk. I also used onion powder and just a little red onion- the sweetness was a nice contrast to the savory spices.

The hubs loves these! He is 100% Italian and said they are better than any of the homemade meatballs he had growing up (any his mom is an outstanding cook!) I think the Frank's is what sets this one apart from others.

Best meatballs I've ever made. I omitted the spicy stuff on account of my wimpy kids, and had to use seasoned breadcrumbs because the plain ones were stale, but the flavor of these was amazing & totally complemented the spaghetti sauce I made. I'm permanently replacing my old yucky meatball recipe with this one!

Perfect and easy for large groups!  I make the meatballs ahead of time and then before people arrive I put them in a slow cooker with spaghetti sauce and heat them up.  So far everyone has raved about them!

I thought these were great - I should have diced my onion smaller and I would put a little less bread crumbs, it seemed a little bready- I used 1 pound and a 1/3 of meat and the same amount of bread crumbs that it asked for so I can't imagine with 1/3 less meat  - now the leftovers were fine couldn't taste the extra bread crumbs but the day of it was too much.  Other than that if you can handle a little heat I would increase it... I didn't find heat in the amount of red pepper flakes and hot sauce that was suggested and I can handle a small amount of heat so I will increase it next time. Otherwise this will be my new meatball recipe.

I found nothing truly spectacular about these. Yes, they are quick and easy for a weekday dinner, and that is important to me as a working mom, but taste-wise, I wasn't impressed. I left out the red pepper flakes and hot sauce, as my 3 year-old was eating these, however I doubt it would've made them any better. I increased the garlic and decreased the Italian seasoning, which contains oregano, which I don't particularly care for. Even with far less Italian seasoning than called for, the oregano flavor definitely overpowered the meatballs. Baking at 400 degrees seemed too high, so I baked them at 375 instead. However, baking them at 350 for the same cooking time would've sufficed. Hubby really liked these, but I probably won't use this recipe again. I'll keep searching for my idea of "meatball nirvana" but thank you for the submission nonetheless.

I really like these meatballs. I read a lot of reviews and tweaked the recipe to our liking. For instance, I used half chuck and half pork, added green peps, used real garlic, lessened the heat factor, and baked at 350 degrees on parchment paper to minimize cleanup. People said they were dry or salty? They must've screwed something up, 'cause these are delicious.

These were very moist and easy to make but there were too many spices for just 1 pound of ground beef.

great recipe! very flavorful and only used 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes per pound and it could have handled a little more kick. All in all, very easy recipe to follow and I will be making again.

Quick and easy recipe.  I used ground elk instead of ground beef, and minced garlic instead of the garlic salt, and the flavours were awesome... they meatballs were moist and absolutely FABULOUS!

Very nice spicy kick!  The spice is not overpowering though - these will taste great with red sauce.  I did not have Italian seasoning so I added a bit more oregano and added a few twists of fresh cracked black pepper.  I made a double batch and froze them in 2-serving packets for quick and easy dinners.

I thawed out hamburger the day before and didn't know what to make with it, my boyfriends suggested Meatballs, I looked up this recipe and made them for dinner with home made garlic toast.  They are going to be my go to meatballs!  They are the first meatballs I have ever made and I will not make another! Quick and easy and a crowd pleaser! Meatball sandwiches tomorrow!

I added garlic powder rather than the salt and we felt the meatballs were still a little salty.  Overall we really liked this recipe and will likely make these again!

Just made these for a picnic and they are delish!  Doubled recipe using 1lb. ground chuck and 1lb. ground pork.  Used Sambal Oelek in place of the pepper flakes/hot sauce. Dropped them in some Mid's meatless marinara sauce and they are so darn good.

This recipe is a keeper.  The hot sauce and crushed red pepper flakes really kick it up and offer great flavor.  I've never made meatballs without an egg before, but it works.

Fantastic! Used just enough evaporated milk (instead of skim) to moisten our homemade Italian bread crumbs and made the meatballs around 1/2 inch in size (which was the perfect size for serving with pasta). Reduced the baking time because the meatballs were smaller. Will make again!

Best meatballs ever!! I liked the recipe as stated minus the hot stuff since I have little kids. I also made it with the addition of one egg and it was even better. There was a bit of a tougher texture without the egg.

Best meatballs i've ever made! A bit spicy for some tastes (not mine) so go easy on the hot sauce and red pepper flakes if you are in that group.

While the meatballs turned out tastey, I was somewhat dissatisfied that they tasted like meatloaf. If I try this again, I'll prolly try a few differences with spices -more of this, less of that-... and I'll also leave out the breadcrumbs and eggs(milk substitute).

Love this recipe!  Meatballs are always a great comfort food and these are by far the best ever.  The only thing I tweaked was to add some montreal steak season to give it a little extra kick.  My sons chow down on them.

These are great!  I doubled the recipe and made a crockpot-full of meatballs in my favorite jarred spaghetti sauce.  Probably the best meatballs I ever made.  My family thought they were a little spicy, so I might just cut down on the red pepper flakes next time.  Otherwise...perfect!  Thanks for the recipe - it is a keeper!

Wow! These are fantastic! Because of my kids, I left out the red pepper and hot sauce, but those ingredients aren't what makes this. It's the PARMESAN!! I ended up adding more parmesan than was called for, then ended up needing more bread crumbs because the mixture was too wet. The result was fantastic.

Personally I thought these meatballs were very very good... my family didn't think they were anything special though.... I served these with our homemade spaghetti sauce over noodles... next time I want to try with a marinara sauce either over noodles again or on a sandwich... either way i enjoyed this recipes tasted great..

These were awesome with a kick!  Made as the recipe stated.  After they were done in the oven, I drained and added them to spaghetti sauce which I simmered for about an hour.  A little spicy for my kids, but they'll adapt!

Meatball Nirvana Haiku: "These are fantastic! I followed the recipe, to perfect results!" I scaled the recipe up to 6 servings, since I had additional ground beef, and froze some of the meatballs for another night, but truth be told, I could've just eaten bowl after bowl of these plain. After baking them, I let the 'balls simmer in a simple basil tomato sauce until ready to serve, and we just scooped them onto our plate and *poof!* they disappeared, leaving our stomachs in a blissful state of, yes, nirvana.

My first meatballs...  They are SO good!  Great flavor, nice texture.  Made with Miller's Marinara recipe from this site.

These were really good and my 4 year old loved them! The Italian seasoning or Oregano was a bit strong for my tastes which is why I only gave 4 stars. Next time I'll cut that back a bit and they will be prefect!

These were amazing. I always think meatballs taste weird but these were so good. The only thing I changed was I used ground turkey.

These were THE BEST meatballs I've ever made!
Aside from making a double batch; I followed the recipe exactly. 
For those cooks out there who use lower fat beef, be sure to spray your baking sheet with Pam. My first batch stuck but the second one came off nicely.
Thanks for the great recipe.

Delicious!  Can't wait to serve them tomorrow for the football game.  I only used 1/2 of a small onion, and plain bread crumbs (since that was what we had) and omitted the hot sauce and pepper flakes (as I am not a spicy food lover).  This will definitely be my go-to meatball recipe.

I've never made Meatballs before, so I gave this recipe a try on Saturday. I followed the receipe exactly, excluding only the Frank's and crushed red peppers, and cooked them along with some rigatoni and marinara sauce. My girlfriend and I both enjoyed them, and I will certainly be making them again.

Use garlic instead of garlic salt, use Ricotta cheese instead of milk, or use one egg.

Oh wow! Very tasty. I did add brown sugar to the mix though and omitted the hot sauce. 1/3 cup of brown sugar did the trick.

These were great!!  Vey easy to make.  My husband loved them.  We are a picky family in that we do not like bland food.  We love flavor and spice.  I didn't used garlic salt.  I always use fresh garlic.

Absolutely delicious!!  Though I used 3/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper since I didn't have red pepper flakes, it was great.  My husband liked it better than another recipe I tried off of here, he had 2 meatball subs for dinner.  This recipe is a keeper!!  Thank you LTH..

This was an amazing meatball recipe, the fresh grated parmesan was the kicker.  The only thing I changed was I added ground pork to it, because I needed a lot of meatballs, Thanks so much , I'll never make meatballs any other way again!!!!

I make this all the time, a double recipe of course, here's my version: 1 lb ground beef, 1lb Italian pork sausage. Blended oats instead of bread crumbs. 1 egg, 1/3 c almond milk. Chopped garlic, extra pepper flakes. I can't really tell a difference if I leave the Parmesan out. I've made a turkey/pork version but it was significantly less awesome. Def go pork sausage instead of ground pork, if you're going the pork route. These. Are. Bomb.

Great recipe, I substituted ground turkey for the meat, as I don't eat beef and tortilla chip crumbs for bread crumbs and ricotta cheese for the milk.  I also baked them with a little water in the baking dish to keep them nice and moist.  The meatballs were delicious.  I would make this recipe again in a heartbeat.  Thank you LTH!!!

I thought it was only so-so. All the Italian seasoning and Italian seasoned breadcrumbs made them taste like stuffing, to me. I like my meatballs a little sweeter and not so herbed.

Very good, although I found them a little too spicy.  I'd probably leave out the crushed red pepper flakes the next time around.

These were nice, I enjoyed them more after they sat in the marinara sauce I made for a bit.  I will make these again. I didn't add the hot sauce, since my husband does not care for anything too spicy and I didn't have fresh onion so I used dried and it worked out just fine.  Other than that I followed as directed.

These meatballs were to die for.  I took them to work the next day and everyone loved them.  In making this I learned that next time I will dice the onions a little finer and pick out a better marinara sauce  to match the meatballs with.  Pretty easy to follow even for a beginner cook.

This was my first time making meatballs.  I had a lot of ground beef to use up.  I used 90% lean.  I skipped the italian seasoning since I did not have it.  Just added some oregano, parsley and basil instead.  I used minced garlic.  Half of the onion was fresh, the other half frozen.  They really turned out great.  I'm impressed with myself!  LOL.

These are excellent, flavorful meatballs.  I am not a very big meatball fan and these are just the right texture and flavor for me- great in a sub or on spaghetti. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

These meatballs are so easy to make and so flavorful! I've never attempted homemade meatballs from scratch before, and now I don't think I'll ever buy frozen again.  I loved all the spices and just estimated how much I thought we'd like rather than measuring exactly.  They are great on their own, but I put them on hoagie rolls with tomato sauce, pepperjack cheese and red bell pepper strips (we love peppers, what can I say!).  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Great meatballs.  My husband loves meatballs, and even though I am not a fan of meatballs in general, I liked these ones.  I put in less spice than it called for and used real plain bread and broken into small pieces because I didn't have any seasoned bread crumbs.  In fact, I can't imagine it having more seasoning than it already did.

These were good, not great.  Definitely a little too salty, and I really like my salt.  With the cheese and italian breadcrumbs, there is no need to add more sodium.  Also would decrease the breadcrumbs next time, or use plain, because the seasoning was a little overpowering.  I might make these again with some tweaks

These meatballs are fantastic!  They are spicy, but we love spicy food so they were perfect for us.  If you are not a fan of spicy food, just cut the amount of red pepper flakes.  The meatballs were moist and very flavorful.  These will become a regular at our house.

Awesome recipe.  My husband and I love them, will for sure be making them again.  They don't even need any sauce, they're good enough just plain- I think they're the best meatballs I've ever eaten.

PHENOMENAL!!!  I did change it a tad though... doubled everything except red pepper flakes but used 1# beef and 1# pork.  LOVE these meat balls!  If you're reading these reviews wondering "what makes these meatballs different from all the other recipes?"  I'll tell you... No EGG.  Soooo.... it doesn't have the "spongy" texture that some meatballs do, but rather a more meaty texture.  Do not over mix.  And once browned, I like to finish them off IN the sauce for a half hour or so. I know some purists may find this a sacrilege, but I think it makes them moist and flavorful.

These were great! All three of my very picky eaters were convinced to eat one meatball each, which is a huge victory in this house! I did cut the red pepper flakes way down though. After baking these I tossed into my marinara sauce while it finished simmering and the flavors melded perfectly. I served over fresh spaghetti with hot bread and it was wonderful!

OUTSTANDING! I threw this together for meatball subs for my 3 daughters and I-who can all be pretty picky! It was a smash hit and will be staying in the family cookbook!  I did use a little more garlic because we love garlic a lot! I toasted hoagie buns topped with marinara, meatballs, some more sauce and topped with grated cheese-YUMMY! Adelicious meal in under 30 minutes!

These were excellent, and easy to make!  My only concern was that they tasted a bit salty, but I will see what I can do next time I make them to refine that for our family's taste.  There will definitely be a next time!

Made exactly as called for.  My husband and I both loved the heat in them but I'd cut back a bit if I were making it for others with a less spicy palate.  Delicious with some spaghetti sauce on a crusty roll.

Fixed these as written except followed other poster's suggestions: used one egg instead of milk and omitted the oregano. The Italian seasoning was more than enough. I used panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs. I put the meatballs in the slow cooker covered with tomato sauce and cooked for 8 hours. They were perfect served over rice. Will add to my favorite's folder!

This recipe rocks! I just couldn't get my meatballs right and had nearly given up before I found this. I made it without the hot sauce and it was perfect for us. I now make a double batch at least once a month and freeze the extras. I have yet to mess it up :-)

Amazing meatballs!! I used 2 eggs and then added enough milk to make 2/3 cup (I made a double batch) instead of just using milk.  I also did not add any hot pepper sauce, and just threw in a few hot pepper flakes.

These were really good. I was pretty skeptical about using milk rather than an egg but I was pleasantly surprised, these were moist and held together. The only change I made was to add 1/2 tsp of cracked black pepper and i think the bite from the pepper negated the need for the hot sauce. Next time I'll skip the Frank's.

Very moist and flavorful! We really enjoyed these this evening. Followed the recipe and even the little ones asked for seconds. I already have plans to double or triple the amount next time so I can freeze them and have them available for busy weeknight pasta or sandwiches. Will definately be on the menu alot around here. Thanks for sharing!

This is the easiest and best recipe for meatballs I've found.  I caution parents, however, that the pepper flakes may be too much for little ones.  I either omit them or run them through a grinder.  I make this about three times a month.

Excellent.  I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 pork and 1/2 beef.  They are lovely.  I have put many in the freezer for later an will make up a pkg for a gift for my son in law.  Thank You for a great recipe.

Since I'm on a low sodium diet, I omitted the sea salt and garlic salt (added garlic powder).  Everyone that tried them loved them.  Used the remaining meatballs in an allspice meatball stew recipe also to rave reviews.  Thank you very much for the recipe!

I don't cook much, but this was easy to make and my husband LOVED them.  If you serve them over spaghetti, watch the pepper/spice content of the sauce you use or make.  GREAT recipe!

Made these last night.  First time making meatballs.  I really enjoyed them.  Didn't have any red pepper flakes so I used cayenne pepper.  Gave them a nice kick.

My first attempt at meatballs.  Tasted good, very easy.  I put them in spaghetti.  I made mine smaller than this recipe called for so I ended up with over 20.  I had planned to use the left overs on some meatball subs but there weren't any left!!

We made these with ground turkey instead of beef and they were AMAZING!  We followed the advice of another reviewer and used 1/2 cup ricotta in place of the milk but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I was pleasantly surprised the meatballs held together so well.  Thanks for a great base recipe!

These were so great! I scaled higher because I was making them for my son's first birthday party. Close to 200 meatballs GONE in 3 hours. And that wasn't the only main course! Everyone kept saying, "What's the spice in these, yummm" haha. I couldn't use milk because I didn't have enough, so I substitutd eggs and they were still sooo moist and delicious. Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent for pasta, subs and meatball stew. Like a great many I substituted the garlic salt with dehydrated garlic. Also I sauted the diced onion with a touch of olive oil. If you use dehydrated onion and garlic both use the milk AND add 1 beaten egg.

This recipe is delicious!! I didn't have any milk in the house, so substituted an egg. Other than that, made as listed with the exception of salt. Used only half the amount of salt, because I'm not a big salt fan, and rarely use it. When I do, I cut it in half. I like to taste the food- not salt.

These are great!  I love that they are baked, not fried.  I subbed 1 egg for some of the milk, and had only dried onions, but I don't think either of these things affected the totally awesome taste of these.  A must try!

5 Stars!  So easy and so tasty!  Made a triple batch and was glad I did!  There's a kick to them, so children might not like, but my whole dinner party loved them (and some are not good with spicy)!  Bake time of 20  minutes was perfect.  I used 2 parts ground turkey & 1 part spicy Italian sausage.  Egg instead of milk.  Thanks so much LTH!

These meatballs were EXCELLENT. Has just the right amount of zing to them. We made a large batch and froze them and had our first meal tonight....so they freeze well.  This is my new meatball recipe for sure!

I left out the italian seasoning and oregano because I wanted a sweeter taste. My wife raved about how soft they were. Don't ask me what that means.

These were good - I let them sit in the fridge 1 hour before baking. Also - the baking time left them a little over done (even at the 20 min) so next time I will do them a little less. I only used a pinch of red pepper flakes due to family taste preferences. This was my first time making meatballs and they were a success!

SO good!!! I put a small onion in the food processor and added ricotta cheese as suggested by another reviewer. So moist!! After I baked them (I doubled this, btw) I put them in my crockpot with a 26 oz jar of marinara sauce. Warmed for a couple hours 'till supper and cooked some pasta. Next time I'll make them a bit larger and put them on hoagie buns.

Not a huge onion fan so, I only added 1/2 of the onion that it asked for and they came out perfect. even over-cooked the second batch and they were still delicious!! so much flavor, can't wait to impress my friends with these as an appetizer (with marinara on the side) at our next gathering!

Don't let the four stars fool you... These things are AWESOME !!!  However, if you're feeding guests who are not into spicy, definitely omit the crushed red & the hot sauce.  If you do like spicy then these meatballs are five stars all day long....  Thanks for the recipe...  Will definitely make again & again!!!

This recipe uses a wonderful blend of spices. The meatballs hold together nicely. The only thing I would do different is to occasionally turn the meatballs because they can get stuck to the pan if they are left stationary. Ate the leftovers in a meatball sub and was pleasantly surprised that they made a good leftover as well. Will definately be using this recipes again! Thanks!

I have made this three times, each time better than the last. I have changed it some but the way it was written is truly outstanding. I reduced the pepper flakes to 1/2 tsp. and did away with the hot sauce (wife won't eat anything with any spice at all) and I split the ground beef with pork sausage.

Great! I omitted the hot sauce and red pepper, added two tablespoons of romano cheese, and one beaten egg.  The outcome was excellent. Instead of baking them, I cooked the meatballs in the Chunky Marinara Sauce recipe from this site; heat the sauce to a boil, reduce heat, add the meatballs and simmer for 25 minutes. Tender and moist - my family loved them!

REALLY GREAT MEATBALLS!!!  The only thing I would change next time I make them is not to cook them as long as I did.  Turn them over after 10 minutes and you should be able to tell how much longer they need to cook.  Try em' you'll love em'.

I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs in mine and it turned out pretty spicy.  Too spicy to enjoy by themselves as plain meatballs but VERY GOOD in the spaghetti and sauce!  I think next time I will use more Parmesan Cheese as I could not really taste it and wanted more of that flavor.

That's a spicy meatball!! Delicious. Lots of flavor and can't wait to taste it after 24 hours of the flavor marrying. I probably added a little more hot sauce than I should have but they really are flavorful.

Yes!  Finally!  Found my go-to meatball recipe!  These were fantastic.  Cooked them up and make mouth watering meatball subs.  Great flavor!  The only things I did differently was substitute 2 cloves minced garlic for the garlic salt (didn't have on hand, we are garlic fans!)... and next time I may slightly reduce the crushed red pepper (only due to personal preference.)  Extremely flexible recipe!

I made this yesterday and LOVED IT!  But I always have to make some changes to make it more mine.  I added a 1/2 lb of Italian Sausage to it, I didn't have garlic salt so I used garlic powder, used Basil instead of oregano (since I was out) and didn't put the hot pepper sauce in because I didn't have any.  They were a huge hit in my house.  I can't wait to make them again!

This recipe was fairly simple. My husband gives them a 5/5 rating.  I used ground turkey and decided to make really large meatballs.  I also chose to replace the milk with egg, I couldn't really see what the difference would be by using milk. The recipe made 9 large meatballs. Next time I might try with ground beef and pork and make smaller meatballs.

Absolutely fantastic!  Best meatballs I have EVER eaten. The flavor is phenomenal!  Followed recipie as is except for MORE hot sauce/chillies (as I am a chili junkie).  This is a real keeper.  Love it!

Girlfriend gave it a 6*!. I found it to be a little dry -possibly because I used 'extra-lean'. Next time, I might use my standard 'medium' ground beef and possibly not cook for the entire 25 min - knock it down to 20 min

This definetly earned 5 stars.  I put these in spaghetti, and instead of doing 1 lbs. I did 1.5, because 4 servings wouldn't be enough.  This was so so so easy to make, I love it!!!!!!!

MMmmm I used turkey meat & instead of Italian seasoning I used Pappy's Lemon Pepper & substituted seasoned bread crumbs for crushed saltine crackers..cooked & added them to a tortellini soup!Very filling & comforting when your feeling under the weather.

Loved the recipe.  I made two batches.  The first one exactly like the recipe and the meatballs were very moist and flavorful.  The second batch I made for my kids and omitted the red pepper flakes, hot sauce and onions and they loved them. Thanks for the great recipe.

I made these with turkey tonight and YUM! Easy and tastes great! I love that it doesn't use an egg. I used a pinch of cayenne in place of the hot sauce and was just the right amount of heat.

this makes great turkey meatballs. i only used about a 1/4 tsp of salt b/c 1/2 tsp seemed to much. the hint of pepper in these really set them off.

I pulled up this recipe for my boyfriend when he asked me "How do I make meatballs?"  Based on the good reviews, I knew this recipe probably wouldn't fail him.  I was right!  He loved these meat balls and even used the meat to make a few burgers.  We did do a few substitutions- eggs for milk, real garlic instead of garlic salt, and no bread crumbs (we were out).  These turned out amazingly.  Leaving the onions coarsely chopped made for a nice texture.  Delicious.

I thought this was a great recipe.  My 2 and 4 year old boys loved it.
