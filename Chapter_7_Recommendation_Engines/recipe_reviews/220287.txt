I'm not fond of finding a recipe and rearranging, deleting, adding until after I've made it the first time.  Stacy, I have to tell you, I didn't change anything with this recipe and these are some of the BEST Brussel sprouts I've ever made, bar none!!! I wanted something different, remembered the sprouts and made them to your specs and had them with some BBQ'd ribs.  Cut them in half, boiled them for almost 5 minutes which left them with just the right amount of crunch.  The combination of butter, honey mustard dill and onion is delightful.  Please know that your recipe has been saved and shared already with my daughter and 2 neighbors.  I can't wait to do this one again.  TY!!

I made these to serve for dinner but they were so good I ate them all before dinner!  Instead of boiling (i dont care for boiled veggies) I cooked the Brussels sprouts in a couple tablespoons of olive oil a hot skillet for around 6 minutes.  I prepared the sauce using 3 parts honey to 2 parts mustard and I used half yellow mustard and half brown.  I don't think that any of my changes strayed from the original intent of the author.  The mustard is a perfect combined with these little cabbage veggies (think corned beef & cabbage with mustard).  I will make these again.  Thanks sueb for recommending.  And thanks Stacy for sharing this recipe!

I had a bag of frozen microwave-in-the-bag sprouts. My family had them previously and didn't like them, so I was nervous about serving them again. They were cooked and ready to serve when I made a last minute search on this site to try to make them tastier. I was in such a hurry that I just plopped on some soft butter, squeezed on some honey, sprinkled on some onion powder and dill weed, and mixed it all together. I left out the mustard, but what a transformation! Everyone scarfed them down and asked for more! Very yummy.

I think it would be better baking these with olive oil instead of boiling them, which would also help cut down on the cabbage smell in the house.  I will probably also add a little more of the dijon mustard (hot version) next time.  Otherwise this was tasty.

This was an interesting departure from the typical bacon/garlic preparation and while we enjoyed it as something different, we still prefer the typical bacon/garlic preparation.  I guess we just weren't huge fans of the sweetness. More important, I'm glad I didn't cook the Brussels sprouts as long as directed - 6-7 minutes was all they needed.

I made this exactly by the recipe. My 9 year old son ate 3 huge servings and would have eaten more if there was any left. Excellent recipe. Its a keeper with the whole family.

I love dijon, so naturally I thought I'd try this. I quartered my brussel sprouts and fried them in a pan with olive oil, then mixed in the dressing afterwards. Delicious! I probably added a bit more than needed, but the dressing is to die for. Thanks for this one! Will definitely use again!

Go, brussels sprouts! This is a fantastic recipe. You know, the kind that when the bowl is empty you still find yourself dreaming about? And, yes, I did eat the entire bowl myself! I made the recipe as written except I sauteed the little buggers instead of boiling them. But it would be just as good no matter how they are initially cooked (I think I'll just steam them next time, just because that will require less baby sitting). But the end result and mix of flavors is fantastic. The flavor of the sprouts isn't covered up, just enhanced. Can't wait to make this again!

Steamed in the microwave for about 3-1/2 minutes until just tender and then mixed in the dressing.  Just a little sweet, at least for our taste; think I'd use less honey and more dijon in the future.

Very good, but I would recommend rinsing them in cold water after you drain them so they don't get overcooked.  Also, make sure you drain them well, otherwise all the sauce gets washed out (we learned this the hard way).  Even still, so yummy.  I halved the butter and honey, and subbed oregano because I didn't have any dill.

These were very good. Sweet and a little hint of Dijon flavor but it wasn't overpowering. I really liked this dish and would eat it again. I used frozen brussels sprouts so I didn't halve them and doubled the seasoned butter sauce. Thanks for the great recipe!

I wish I had doubled this recipe. I was dispappointed that they were all gone when I went back for seconds. It was that good. The flavors really came together well and complemented the cabbaginess of the sprouts. I didn't change the sauce at all, but I did saute/steam the sprouts. When they were almost tender I dumped the sauce on them to finish cooking. I did have to add a bit of water to stretch it.It seemed to soak in a little. Really delicious. Thank you!

We doctored up our regular brussels sprouts with this mixture and they were fantastic. I always cook my veggies in a microwave steamer, so I did that and then added the dressing. "These brussels sprouts are really good. Are there any left?" Love what the honey and dijon do to the flavour, and the dill!

A wonderful surprise ! Didn't boil them in water 1st or you loose taste and vitamins. I lighty roasted them in a frying pan, added the sauce and let it stew under a lid. Also replaced the onion by black pepper (more my taste)and dill by oregano : perfect ! Served with grilled pork chops. First time that Brussels sprouts were getting that many compliments !

I made it but I prefer to roast brussel sprouts and have a little char on them.  I used all of the ingredients listed but decreased the honey and increased the Dijon mustard.  Made a good amount for four people and they disappeared very quickly.  Two of the people don't care for brussel sprouts or so they said until they are them all up.  Will definitely make them again with the changes I made.

This is very good - but I can only judge it with the changes I made. I toss the brussel sprouts with olive oil and a little salt and pepper and roast them in the oven instead of boiling them. When you add the sauce, the slightly crispy texture of the brussels really adds another dimension to the dish. I always double the sauce recipe because I always use more brussel sprouts, and I leave the dill out . Just butter, honey, mustard, and the onion powder. I then sprinkle a small amount of fresh-squeezed lemon juice over everything just to pull it all together. It's fantastic.

Delicious! I absolutely LOVE brussel sprouts and am always looking for a differnt way to prepare them. I used a HUGE bag of them so just made more sauce. The sauce is light and delicious. I went a little lighter on the butter and a little heavier on the dill sauce and dijon. Absolutely delicious and easy to make!

Delish! I used spicy brown mustard instead of Dijon. I also didn't have dill weed on hand so I just added a splash of dill pickle juice. My husband couldn't stop eating them!

Wonderful flavor. Followed ingredient list to the letter but put mixture in skillet to saute for a few minutes.

I don't write many reviews but I had to for this. I love fresh vegetables and recently Brussels sprouts were on sale. We have never made them fresh, only frozen. We tried boiling them whole and they were OK but slightly dry and they needed something. They needed this recipe!I thought just halving them made a big difference. We loved the flavor and moisture that the honey and mustard added. Good stuff!

I love Brussels sprouts,especially when they are fresh. I was looking for an easy recipe that added flavor w/out a lot of fat. This recipe did not disappoint. I took advice of others and sauteed in olive oil @ 7 mins. They were perfect.

We love B. sprouts, but I wanted to do something a bit different.I steamed the sprouts in my steamer,& whisked olive oil, the mustard,honey & onion powder together-no dill weed-so used herbs de Provence instead. Put the sauce w/the halved sprouts & it was a hit & is now saved to my R.Box & I will definetely be doing this again. Thanks Stacy

My husband and I love this!  Delicious!  Couple of changes...I use a package of sprouts (don't know how many are in there).  Second, I put just a little oil in a dutch oven on the stove top and cook, stirring often, 15-20 minutes.  They turn brown but it only enhances the flavor.

This was excellent!  I didn't change a thing.  Brussel sprouts aren't a veggie we usually eat, but we will eat it more often with this recipe.

It was quite good as is. I would add a pinch of salt to the butter mixture before stirring in the Brussel sprouts. Neither my husband nor I are huge fans of this vegetable, but every so often I serve them for a change of pace and this was the best recipe I've tried so far.

I don't know if my measurements were off but it was a tad too acidic to me. I did not like how to dijon combined with the brussels sprout's flavors at all. It all combines together well enough though.

Made this one for Thanksgiving dinner.  Only change I made was to increase the mustard and down the honey a bit because was also having sweet potatoes.  It turned out great but the sauce was a bit soupy.  Didn't stop it from being a hit, though.  I will definitely make it again.

Simply added a bit more dijon mustard for our tastes, but an excellent recipe that was quick and a hit with my husband. We paired it with Bacon-wrapped, mozzarella-stuffed chicken breasts.

The sauce is quite good, but my family just didn't care for the sweetness paired with the Brussels sprouts. We may make this sauce and serve it over other vegetables.

My husband really like these as they are really yummy.  Because of personal preference, I sautéed  in EVO instead of boiling.  I cut in half and browned and then turned over, stirring until almost tender.  The sauce is great as it, but is one of those you can taste and adjust to your personal preferences. I made as directed, added to the sprouts in the pan, covered and cooked until fully tender.   Thanks for sharing!

It was a great way to serve Brussels sprouts -- quick and easy to make. They were tender when boiled and the sauce gave them a little kick. Great for a quick, healthy vegetable and for those folks who don't normally like Brussels sprouts.

I sautéed brussel sprouts instead of boiling as we prefer a crispier outside.  Then I tossed them with the sauce.  Perfect!  This is the only way I will eat brussel sprouts!

Sauteed the sprouts instead of boiling other than that followed the recipe, good flavor.

Delicious! I was so apprehensive about cooking them as I never had. My family was brave and we were pleasantly surprised, they came out great!

Made as recipe outlines. I will definitely make it again. Honey, Dijon softens the strong Brussels flavour.

This was super simple and very tasty provided a) you like brussel sprouts and b) you can forgive their odor as you cook them.  I made one slight alteration to this recipe.  I don't normally have honey on hand at home, but I did have honey Dijon mustard so that's what I used instead of the separate measurements of the two ingredients.  Turned out just fine, my husband and I really enjoyed them.

Made the Honey Mustard dressing many times after I made the brussels sprout. Love the recipe and have used it on fish, pork loin, and chicken, besides with the sprouts. Yum!

Pretty good and worked fine as leftovers. Interesting alternative as another person noted. Nothing like a little honey to sweeten the pot eh? I did roast the BS and added them to the "sauce".

delicious!  I had more Brussel sprouts that the recipe called for, so I put the rest of the ingredients together proportionally.  My Brussel sprouts were frozen so cut them in 1/2, put them in the pot and boiled for 5 minutes, it was plenty of time. Will definitely make again.  thanks for a wonderful side dish!

We love this recipe! I have made it over and over. The first few times, I didn't have dill weed or onion powder on hand. We really liked it. More recently I added in the rest of the spices and it was fantastic!

I was hungry and in a hurry so I boiled the brussel sprouts whole and drained. Put the ingredients as listed and ate! Love it, very simple.

I have been trying difference Brussels  Sprouts recipes for years, and this is by far the best one yet.  I loved the Dijon mustard and honey combo, and the dill just sent them over the top.  I wouldn't change a thing. Such an easy delicious recipe.

Had this for a diner party of six, made enough for 12. and they were gone. Everyone loved them! It's added to my list, and will definitely be making them again.  By the way, I used regular mustard, as I did not have Dijon, and added garlic powder rather than onion powder.

Sautéed the Brussels sprouts in grape seed oil.  Made the mustard mixture as directed.  It wasn't  awful.  It wasn't great.  It was ok.  It is definitely sweet.  I prefer Brussels sprouts in garlic butter from food.com.
