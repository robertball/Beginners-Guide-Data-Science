I'm sorry but the cookies didn't taste very well. I followed the instrutions exactly as it was written. It tastes like hot flour and butter. I'm sorry for the bad review. :(

A perfectly fine ordinary peanut butter cookie.  I cut back on the recipe to 20 servings since I'm not feeding a camp full of kids and it did make 20 large cookies.  I didn't change the recipe at all other than the quantity and using chunky peanut butter.  They are tasty and I'm sure if feeding a camp full of kids, this recipe will be fantastic.
