Didn't even realize that our Billy Boy had this recipe on the site. Hubster is a burger and topping snob, but because I knew he would love this, I gave it a shot. He did Bill!! We also ended up mixing in horseradish which made a terrific cocktail sauce for both shrimp and our favorite Vermont cheddar cheese. Thanks honey pie!

This is a great start.  If you are like me and like to experiment with healthier alternatives, then this gives you a little push.  I have been making my own Ketchup and Mustard sauces for years.  I use base 'tomato sauce' and then add splenda for sweet, garlic seasonings, cider vinegar, onion salt etc. as my tastes warrant.  Same thing with Mustard, just add the flavors you like, cayenne, garlic, black pepper.  The options are endless.  I love a sweeter mustard so I have been putting a little splenda in with garlic and man is it good on veggies or on the wraps I make with turkey and coleslaw.

I tried this out last week, and liked it so much I made it with a 24oz bottle of ketchup. I added quite a lot more garlic pwder, and also some dried minced onion. I'm going to make up a smaller bottle for Husband with some spicy yellow mustard. Thanks!

Try to find a ketchup without the high fructose corn syrup. Hunt's has one. I don't think Heinz has caught up with reality yet. If you use the green Tabasco sauce, it comes pretty close to the Heinz Hot and Spicy.

This is very good!  My bottle of ketchup (Heinz) was only 20 oz so I used 2 tsp cayenne, 2 tsp onion powder, 1 1/2 tsp garlic powder, and 1 1/2 tsp chili powder.  I used the full amount of hot pepper sauce (Tapatio).  So far I've only had this on chicken burgers, but I'm sure it'd be yummy with just about anything.  It's a nice change from plain ketchup!  My boyfriend loves it, too.

I just added the spices to a nearly full bottle of ketchup and SHOOK well. No wastage or clean up. It worked for me. Used a skewer to mix in the seasonings a little at a time.

I love this so much. I am not a big ketchup fan but I put this on everything. I actually eat breakfast now because it's so good on an egg sandwich.

I love this stuff! I had it on a couple of Hebrew National fat-free franks as a healthy snack. Wayyy better than Heinz Hot & Spicy! I used onion powder instead of the onion flakes for fear of them clogging up the opening in the ketchup bottle & I cut back some on the chili powder.

Wanted something different on the burgers of our "4th of July" celebration and this delivered. So easy to make it like you want it. A great way to top off those charbroiled burgers plus more.

I'm a ketchup lover and always try different, local types when I travel.  I made this and all in my family agree it's the best of many and I'll always have this on hand.  It's like a gourmet product!  (I may have to start making french fries again.)

This is excellent. I made alot of this and sold in jars for a fundraiser. Everyone wanted the recipe. I just smiled and asked if they wanted to buy another jar. Thanks, Bill!

This is Fabulous!!!  I just mixed up a batch and even before all the flavors have had time to meld it's extremely tasty!  Can't wait to try it on fries and burgers!

Simple to make and a nice kicked up ketchup!  I made half a batch and made some with chili powder and some without.  We preferred the version without the chili powder.   I also think this would be really good on top of a meatloaf!  Thanks for the recipe!

We'd give this 4.5 stars if we could.  I scaled this down to make 1 cup and it has very good flavor. I will keep playing with the spices.  This time I added more tabasco sauce (1/4 teaspoon) and decreased the cayenne pepper by 1/4 teaspoon since I wanted more tabasco taste to serve with homemade fish and chips.   Would be great on Mexican or tex-mex burgers, especially if you used a Mexican hot sauce.

I didn't have hot pepper sauce, so I used Sriracha and didn't use quite as much chili powder.  Very good!

Great idea! (The Japanese have a ketchup-based sauce called okonomiyaki sauce, not so hot, that includes brown sugar, Worcestershire and soy sauces, garlic, and ginger.)  Yum.

Pretty good condiment, with a little kick and some chili flavor to it.  I've had it on hot dogs and crinkle fries.  I think it would be best on top of meatloaf though or with a pasty.
