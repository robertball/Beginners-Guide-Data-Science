I first had this at a little Italian place near me. It's one of those places that makes their own pastas and you can chose which kind you want with your meal. The chef recommended it over penne. When I tried it I wished I could make this at home. I found the recipe here and it was FANTASTIC! It was better then the italian place! I add chicken stock instead of the water and I still use the boullion. I like the sauce a little thicker so while it's simmering down a bit, i add a LITTLE flour water mixture while stirring the pan. AND, the kicker that puts it over the top....LEMON JUICE. Squeeze some fresh lemon juice in the pan. SO GOOD YOU WILL CRY. So far, I made this three times and had a total of 17 people try it (i make HUGE amounts of it at a time, usually three pans cooking at once). EVERYONE loved it and they were SO impressed!

This dish is quite delicious, but I prefer a stronger flavor in the meat, so I salted and peppered the chicken BEFORE sauteeing, and I browned the garlic in the oil BEFORE browning the chicken pieces, so that the oil was infused with the garlic flavor. This also made for faster preparation!

Thanks Jill! Great recipe! It's so hard to find things my five-year-old husband really likes!

Simply outstanding! The chicken is fork tender in a smooth, rich and velvety sauce made so by swirling in a couple of tablespoons of butter once the sauce has reduced.  I salted and peppered the chicken before browning, and made sure not to cook it quite completely so that it would not overcook once returned to the sauce.  I used fresh rosemary rather than the dried, as I believe it imparts an entirely different and more subtle flavor.  Served on a bed of tri-color angel hair pasta, this was as good a dish as I've had anywhere.

On Long Island, good Italian restaurants serve this dish family style. It contains chicken on the bone cut or chopped into bite size pieces, along with chunks of Italian sweet and hot sausage, chunked up mushrooms, whole garlic cloves, potatoes cut into small chunks, lots of black pepper, lemon juice, fresh rosemary sprigs, and olive oil. All the main ingredients are browned on the stove then finished in the oven in a casserole and seasoned to taste. With a salad and fresh bread, it's a meal all by itself. "Scarpariello" means shoemaker in Italian, and this signifies that the dish is rustic in origin and makes use of whatever is handy in the kitchen. So it's pretty open-ended. If you use chicken cutlets, lemon and garlic, it's "picatta" - piquant. Nothing is considered wrong in how the dish is made because the results are always "right"!!

This is a very elegant dish that I have made quite a few times.  I like to cut the chicken into a small dice before browning - makes it easier to eat with pasta.  Sweet onion can be used in place of the shallot, but be sure to use a dry white wine.  I have ruined the dish a couple of times using cooking wine and also a sweet white wine - tasted terrible!  Thanks for sharing the recipe, Jill!

I really liked the flavor of this, but as another reviewer commented...it looked as if I poured soup over the pasta.  I will definately fix again, but will thicken the sauce next time. I really liked the wine flavor...it was delicious.  I didn't have shallots on hand so I used a bit of white onion instead.  Thanks for posting.

Instead of water and chicken bouillon, use chicken broth.  You can get it with less salt than with the bouillon, and better flavor.  As with others, I also recommend using less or as an option thicken it with a little flour and water for finishing.

A very tasty and quick dish. Probably made it 30 times now. I added FRESH rosemary this last time and WOW!!!. I sometimes add 1/4 cup heavy cream for a whiter, thicker sauce. Have 4 teenagers that love it and ask for it by name. Usually serve over fettuccini, sometimes rice.

This was incredibly quick to prepare, as well as delicious!  Instead of cutting the chicken into strips, I sliced the chicken where I had thin "fillets" - I simply took a sharp knife and made thin diagonal cuts that were just slightly parallel.  I seasoned the flour w/ a little bit of garlic powder, salt and black pepper, and seasoned the chicken w/ black pepper, crushed rosemary, and salt.

I sautéed the garlic in a mixture of EVOO and butter. 

This is a keeper!

I wish I had read some of the other's advice but I had printed this recipe off months ago and just chose to make it now. Let me put it this way: I served over angel hair pasta and it looked like I just put chicken strips over the pasta and poured chicken broth overall. HOWEVER, the taste was really good..despite its bland appearance. The "sauce" didn't thicken really well but next time, I might take some previous reviewer's advice to remedy that.  Also, I might add some garlic powder to the flour when coating the chicken. However, I followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out realy good...or as the submitter says "delicate."  Would make again!

The recipe is good, but we prefer bone-in chicken pieces, so I used small pieces of 
thighs as well as breasts. I also added more garlic, eliminated the bullion cube and used 1 cup of 
chicken stock. 

The recipe doubles and triples well and can be prepared ahead and then heated
through in the skillet.

I just went to a fancy Italian restaurant over the weekend and was determined to mock their Chicken Scarpariello.  Let me just say that THIS recipe was even BETTER with recommendations made by a fellow reviewer.  First, to make a thicker sauce, add more more butter to the skillet AFTER taking the chicken out.  Melt the butter (about 1.5 tablespoons) and then add more flour- about 2 tablespoons) now you've made a roux and this will thicken your sauce. Proceed to sauté the garlic.  (I added some fresh mushrooms at this point).  Also- we love a garlicky dish, so because the fancy restaurant had "chunks" of garlic, I also cut up bigger chunks...gave it an amazing flavor.  Also- just a DASH of red pepper flakes is recommended for added flavor.  For my wet ingreidents, i also nixed the water and just doubled the broth (prob about 2.5 cups of broth- we love a lot of sauce) and added 3/4 cup wine and about a half of lemon (lemon is a MUST in this dish!).  I boiled some linguini noodles that i tossed in along with fresh parm cheese and kalamata olives.  Served with a side salad with blue cheese dressing and garlic bread.  OMG, sooooo good.

nice recipe but a few hints: keep the chicken breast whole and cook it that way as the chicken tends to dry out faster when sliced. You'll see the juice run out if you slice it after it is cooked and you can also fan out the slices(cut on a bias)over the pasta or rice. Also forget the shallots as they are super expensive, use red onion. also forget bouillion as it is loaded with salt home made chicken stock is the way to go; after the chicken is done remove from pan reduce the sauce by 1/2 and swirl in raw butter to finish the sauce. Nape oner the chicken and enjoy.

This is a wonderful dish but it is not scarpariello.  I do it a bit differently.  I find that the shallots and rosemary don't work for this dish for me.  Scarpariello should be very garlicy and lemony.  As others have mentioned, I also use chicken stock.  But along with the chicken, I use cut up sweet Italian sausage browned with the chicken and cherry peppers.  You can use hot or sweet.  I mix them.  I cook it in a stainless Paella pan to be able to make sure there is enough juice, then at the end mix about 1/4 c cold water with a heaping tbsp cornstarch to make the liquid very thick.

This wasn't for me.  I had to make many changes to get the sauce to a good flavor and consistancy. Too many changes to list here.  There are so many positive reviews I have to believe that I misread the recipe.  I will not be making this again.

I made this using finely minced green onions instead of the shallots and I substituted chicken broth for the water and bouillon.  I cooked the chicken completely and only used olive oil without any butter.  Then I kept it warm in the oven while I made the sauce.  I used fresh rosemary and half the amount of liquids, so I wouldn’t have to reduce for as long.  Even after reducing, the sauce was very thin, so I gave up and added a little corn starch mixed with a little more broth.  That did the trick.  I thickened this just enough to give it some nice body and then swirled in a couple of tablespoons of butter.  I skipped returning the chicken to the skillet, and when plating I put a pool of sauce on the plate and topped it with the chicken.  A very nice and tasty dinner that we both enjoyed!

This was a quick and easy dish that tasted great. I added a few veggies for my daughter (broccoli and sun dried tomatoes), and did as JDRABIK suggested and sauteed the garlic first to help give the chicken a bit more flavor as well as season the chicken prior to dredging in flower. I thought there wasn't enough sauce, my wife thought it was perfect, and my daughter thought it was yummy.

Next time I make this, I will not skip step one. :) Somehow I skipped right to step 2, so I missed the cutting and dredging, but it still turned out great! I actually liked the presentation (deep bias cut). I skipped the bouillon since I don't use it and instead used stock in place of the water and bouillon. Also, rather than rosemary I used herbs de provence. Perhaps it was my method of cooking, but next time I'll also add my drained noodles to the sauce and then top with the chicken... overalll, easy and quick with great results!

I thought this was pretty tasty, though like other reviewers have said the sauce can be pretty thin. I'd like to try cooking this once again and making the sauce thicker and maybe a little less tart. My boyfriend thought it was really good though.

This was decent, but not spectacular.  We found the sauce to be very gravy-like, which was strange when served over pasta.

A great dish! I will definitely be making this again! I, too, made the sauce thicker by adding a cornstarch/water mixture. If you make it a little too thick like I did :)...then just add more chicken broth, worked for me. And took the advice of one reviewer and diced it instead of putting it in strips and it worked well. The white wine I used was Pinot Grigio, it went perfect in the dish AND to drink with the dish. I ended up serving mine over rigatoni since I didn't have enough mostaccioli in my pantry for the dish and it still paired great. Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this several times and it is always excellent. It has become one of my favorites. Perfect as written, and still good without shallots when I don't have them. I usually try to use fresh rosemary when I have it. It's quick and easy for a busy night.

Amazing dish, took one readers advice and added the juice of half of a lemon as well as two extra garlic cloves.  Served over "Gourmet Mushroom Risotto", amazing.

Used a 1/4 of an onion and an extra garlic clove in place of the shallots--Had a bunch of real picky kids over (the chicken nugget and french fry type) and they gobbled it up -- definetely a keeper!

I am giving this 5 stars because I am a 20 year old college student who has about less than a month of real cooking experience under his belt, and still managed to amaze my mom and dad on my first try cooking this. It was amazing! Following some of the suggestions mentioned before (adding a little corn starch and water to thicken the sauce, adding some garlic salt and pepper to the flour, and using a large cube of chicken bouillon rather than chicken stock) the chicken was delicious! However, the corn starch might not have been the best idea, and next time I'll try making it without that addition. We ate it without rice or pasta and it was amazing, so I'm sure adding either of those two would make it even better. All I'm saying is that if an inexperienced 20 year old can impress his parents the way I did with this dish, you can bet this recipe is the real deal!

My new to cooking neighbor asked my for a chicken recipe.  I gave her this one and said I had been wanting to try it.  Since she invited us for dinner I can report this recipe is easy and turned out very tasty.  The flavors are very clear and clean.  I would recommend doubling the sauce.  I may add a few more spices next time.

A killer recipe.  I used skinned thighs and legs.  Browned them in a cast iron pan, readded them after the shallots and garlic...etc and half way through baking squirted a half of lemon.  A delicious mix of Marsala and picatta...next time I'm gonna add some mushrooms

This was some of the best chicken I've ever made...and so easy!  I salted/peppered the chicken before dredging in the flour, and it turned out too salty.  I would recommend following the recipe to the T, and then adding salt at the table as needed.  The sauce thickens up and makes a nice gravy.  I served over mashed potatoes with green beans, but I think I will try over noodles next time.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This had great flavor!  I used fresh rosemary and added a little cornstarch/water mix to thicken it up some, which kinda made it look like Italian dressing ;)  I served over some rotini with broccoli on the side.  Oh yea and doubled up on the sauce too.  Great recipe!

Wonderful!  I made it exactly as written except instead of only 2T of shallots I used half an onion minced.  We like onion and I think it gave it more texture.  Will make again!

I am a little undecided about this dish. It has good flavour and is fairly easy to make but I am not sure what the sauce should be like... should the pasta be covered with the sauce or is it sort of a dry-ish pasta dish. If it is dry-ish, perhaps the pasta ought to be sauted in olive oil etc. The dish on the whole seemed a little flavourless when served with just boiled pasta. Update: I made this again and used angel hair pasta as recommended by the author. It is much better with angel hair but I did douse the angel hair pasta with lots of olive oil to give it more flavour.

Made this as written and while it was pretty good, it was still quite bland. In an effort to do more with it, the next time I caramelized the onions, added garlic and fresh rosemary instead of dried, used a whole cup of white wine, a nice squirt of lemon juice, a touch of cream and smoked sea salt. It came out still pretty good even after the changes, but it's missing something.

Yum.  This tastes fancy!  Served it with french style green beans and a white bean puree.  Followed MARKINPA's advice of adding a little lemon juice.  I put too many shallots and garlic in the sauce; it still tasted fantastic, but it was too loaded with them.

Very good! I seasoned the flour. Only had bone in chicken so I boiled it and took the meat off. I cubed the meat and coated it in the flour mix and browned. I left out the rosemary because I don't care for it so I used italian seasoning instead. I used the stock from the chicken instead of the water. Doubled the sauce and I used the flower mixture to thicken up the sauce. Oh and I only had white wine with lemon flavor. Turned out awsome. I may make this for my family for Easter.

although the flavoring was great...i adjusted and  added less water but substituted lemon juice to equal 1 cup. I also added sausage and red pepper. it was a soupy mess. disgusting and embarassing.  i read other reviews and was prepared to make a slurry with cornstarch but i was amazed at how much i neeeded to get the right consistency. 2 stars for nice flavor but unless you want to serve chicken scarpariello soup you might want to decrease volume of liquids.

This is soo very yummy! I added some italian seasoning to the flour. I also had to thicken the sauce like others said. Last thing I did was a can of diced tomatoes at the end and served over pasta.  My 15 month old ate it up!

Pretty good... Used chicken broth instead of the white wine (thought I had some but turned out I only had red), water and boullion cube... Also, the sauce wasn't getting thick for me so I whisked up a little flour and water and thickened the sauce with that...  The family enjoyed it...

When I prepared this dish the way the recipe has it written out it came out quite tasty but not seasoned to the tee. I used about another 3 tablespoons of flour. I also seasoned the chicken with lawrys seasoning salt while it was browning, but what really brought it out in the end was while everything was simmering I also added 1 teaspoon of ginger 1/2 teaspoon of onion salt, and 2 tablespoons of soy sauce. I also used chicken broth instead of the  bouillon and water. The broth keeps the flavor up. Thanx for the recipe.

This receipe was fantastic... I was surprised at how much flavor there was with the few ingredients used.  The only thing I changed was after I added the chicken back in, I added in 1/2 heavy cream to thicken the sauce and make it a little creamier.  Fantastic, I served it with angel hair pasta and a nice pinot gris.

EXCELLENT! I made a version quite close to this, here were my changes:
Added: mushrooms, capers, bay scallops 
Altered: didn't have shallots, used onion
Helpful tip: My wine shop sells little cartons of wine with caps (like boxes of broth, but smaller).  So if you don't want or need a full bottle, this is a perfect size!

Delicious, tender and moist. The sauce is the jewel in this recipe. I eliminated the water and bouillion and added 1 cup chicken broth in its place. I used a couple tablespoons more flour to get a thicker sauce. I seasoned the breasts with garlic powder, salt and pepper first. Outstanding dish, Jill. I will be serving this to dinner guests later this week.

This was very easy meal to make.  I used an onion instead of the scallion and next time I would add mushrooms.  I also added 1/4 cup more of the white wine.  We like more sauce with our noodles.  I also added some dry parsley at the very end...it made it more colorful.

This is quick and easy to make and is delicious! I made it with an extra helping of shallots and garlic.  My only complaint is that it didn't quite make enough for two people to fill up on, so make lots of rice or pasta with this recipe!

This was incredible.  I just wanted something different to do with chicken, and ended up making a classy, delicious dinner. It tasted and looked like something you would order out at a nice restaurant.  I'll be making it for company often.

I tried this over egg noodles, and it really hit the spot!   I also used onion instead of shallots, and a particularly sweet white wine.  This made for a light, heady dish which I found surprisingly good.  Try it!

Just made this tonight & it came out excellent. I followed the ingredients exactly, except adding a little bit of flour to thicken the sauce, and I stirred in some chopped spinach for taste/color. Served over ziti noodles. I let the sauce simmer for 20 minutes while the noodles boiled & the garlic bread cooked in the oven. This tasted great & was so easy. My 2 year old loved it. Thanks for the recipe! :)
*PS: I attached a photo of my finished product.

This is a great dish and I have enjoyed it for years, it's fast and the family loves it.  Be aware though, if you are thinking of "adjusting servings" you cannot just multiply your ingredients.  Rosemary can kill a dish if you add more than 1/2 teas. for any recipe from 2 to 20, just don't do it. I use shallots but I always use stock rather than cubes because of the sodium. I usually make this dish for four so I use about a cup of water and a cup of stock and juice from half a lemon. 
When I Prepare my chicken I slice it though once horizontaly, make a cutlet which I then saute quickly and remove from the pan.
Oh dear, I am really jumping around on this recipe but just before it is complete I add a drained can (14oz.) of artichokes, heat and serve over angel hair.
I learned of this recipe during the year I lived in beautiful Roma and I'd say that it is one of the most forgiving recipes, everyone made it differently!

This was wonderful!  I used only 1 Tbl. oil and 1 tsp. butter to cut down on the fat - would do that again.  I got distracted and didn't read the directions about cutting the chicken in strips, so I left them as whole breasts - still turned out fine, just took longer to cook.  I added 1 Tbl. cornstarch to the sauce and it thickened it nicely.  I served this with "Orzo with Parmesan and Basil" from this site (be sure and double that recipe), and it was a great complement.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this seversal times and it has always come out very good.  I substituted chicken broth for the bullion and water.  Also, I used a couple sprigs of fresh thyme instead of the rosemary and it was wonderful!!!

This was a really tasty dish. I seasoned the chicken before browning and added fresh squeezed lemon juice. It turned out really yummy, the chicken was so tender. The only problem was the sauce was pretty thin, maybe I should have used more flour or something...

This was excellent. Lovely flavor. The only change I made was to use onion instead of shallots. I didn't give it 5 stars because I'm not the biggest fan of the flour coating and may try it without next time, but it might not be as tasty.

Husband loved this & said next time I make this I must make more.  I sauted onions/garlic prior to cooking chicken; also added s&p to flour and when adding wine, added a little more along with mushrooms, lemon juice, and some cornstarch to thicken sauce quickly.  Very tasty- thanks for sharing!

This recipe came together amazingly with such simple ingredients.  I love spicy food with big bold flavors, but this was so satisfying and made my tummy happy (as well as the bf's).  I did salt/pepper the chicken first and then coated the chicken with flour; I just made sure to get a nice brown crust on it so that it wouldn't get soggy in the sauce. Was worth it, it made the chicken very moist. Added some corn starch to thicken up the sauce, and added just a tiny amount of lemon pepper to brighten it up.  DELISH!!!!!!!

This is a great, simple, tasty chicken recipe.  If you want to just throw a chicken dish together in a half hour when you don't have many ingredients on hand, this is a great choice because it utilizes ingredients everyone has around the house.  I accompanied it with broccoli and a sweet potato.  Yum!

I am giving this 4 stars because its needs a lot of modification.  Where I come from Scarpariello has a mix of vinger peppers and hot cherry peppers. I added these peppers in with the onions and garlic and sauteed them.  I also followed the suggestion of other reviewers and took 1 t of flour and 1 t of water, mixed it together in a cup and then added it to the sauce to thicken it.  The dish came out so delicious and restaurant quality.  With these modifications, you will be very pleased

I've been looking for a recipe like this.  What a great flavor.  I subbed onions for shallots and I added a splash of lemon.  Next time I'm going to double the sauce.

Very good recipe, but I also doctored it up a little bit to make sure it had enough flavor.  I doubled the sauce recipe as well because once you boil it down you do lose a good amount of liquid and we like a lot of sauce!  

I used 2 cups of college Inn chicken broth in place of water and added a tablespoon of lemon juice (had to use the concentrate from one of those plastic lemons because I didn't have fresh).  I used 1 cup of white wine.  I used 5 cloves of garlic and 3 shallots.  I dredged the chicken in flour that had some garlic powder, salt and pepper added in.  I used 3 tablespoons of butter with a fair amount of extra virgin olive oil when I cooked the chicken... for the health conscious, I am sure you can cut down the butter!

Served over linguine... it was very good.  Mine had a strong lemon flavor... for those who don't like too much lemon you could do less than a tablespoon.  Also had a strong chicken broth, onion and garlic flavor...but it was delicious!

I use red onion vs. shallots as I didn't have any. I used broth instead of water and added a little more but thickened it with flour later.

IT WAS THE BEST!!! I also made risotto which was incredible with the chicken. I've never made risotto and it was harder to make than the chicken but excellent!

The lemon that someone suggested made the dish over the top. It was AMAZING!! I recommend the lemon. I had plenty of sauce left over and my son dunked a loaf of bread and ate that. 

Excellent!!!

An easy-to-prepare recipe - I pounded the chicken breasts until they were thin and then sliced as indicated (helped with uniform cooking time). I used fresh, chopped rosemary (about 1 tsp ) and had some flour left over (about 1/2 tbsp) after dredging, so mixed it with a few tablespoons of water and then added it to the sauce to thicken slightly. I used gemelli pasta, and mixed the chicken and sauce with the pasta before serving. I served with freshly grated parmesan cheese. Delicious.

Yummy! I used chicken tenders and seasoned them with salt and pepper before cooking them. I used chicken stock, fresh rosemary, lemon juice, and a touch of cream. Served it over angel hair. And btw....I used a good white wine and enjoyed the rest of the bottle with diner:)

delicious! Be sure to use a good quality white wine. I used chicken stock that I had made myself and frozen, instead of water. This makes a LOT ... more than 2 servings I'd say, at least 3 if not 4.

Great recipe, my family loved it! I used college inn chicken broth instead of the bouillon and used a very little rosemary.

I followed this recipe to a "T" and unfortunatley had to make something else for Dinner.  I think I have discovered that neither my husband nor myself like the flavor of rosemary...

We loved this recipe!  It was even better as leftovers, as the chicken really soaked in the flavors.  I agree though, it didn't have enough sauce.  We're making it tonight for some friends, and I'm going to quadruple the amount of sauce that this recipe calls for.  We served it with basmati rice the last time and will serve it with egg noodles tonight.

Thanks for sharing!!!

We loved it!  Kept all measurements the same but used italian seasonings instead of rosemary and also added a squirt if lemon.

This is good. My kids didn't really care for the flavor of the Rosemary. If I make this again I might have to find a substitute for it if I make this again.

Pretty good- I served it with broccoli over ziti. I also used some cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Next time I think I would skip dredging the chicken in flour.

I modified slightly by 1) slicing 1/2 of the garlic and shallots and heating with the oil/margargine and 2) making extra sauce so it can be served over angel hair pasta.  One of our favorite dishes.

This was very flavorful. I accidentally used too much flour which made the sauce sticky in the end, but it was still yummy. I added some lemon as others recommended, which was a great addition. Next time I will cut the rosemary in half and use less flour. This makes way too much for 2 people, at least at our house!

Very good!  Modified mine for 4 servings and rolled 2 tablespoons of butter in some flour and added it to the sauce to thicken it.  You definitely have to do that (thicken the sauce).  Served with egg noodles as the consistency didn't seem right for traditional pasta (let alone capellini) and peas.  Added 1 tspn salt and 1/4 tspn pepper to flour mixture for chix but would prob eliminate that as kids said it was a little salty.  Also used 1 can of chix broth + 1/4 cup of water in lieu of the 2 cups of water.  Thank you Jill M. for a great recipe.

This is an excellent dish as is.  I make this often for family dinners as EVERYONE likes it.  I've made two changes - I substitute 1/2 the flour with Romano Cheese and when sauteing the garlic and shallott I add mushrooms.  Delicious!

This was really good. I added some lemon juice as suggested by another reviewer. I also added a tiny bit of cornstarch to make the sauce thicker. I'm not a fan or rosemary so I think I will leave it out next time. Overall, good recipe and really easy. Makes more than 2 servings as well.

I used chicken stock instead of bullion and had to add lots of extra seasoning (including more garlic) after tasting because it seemed a little bland.  After adjusting the seasoning I still wasn't thrilled with it.  I ended up serving it the next day (slowly reheating while covered on the stove) and it was flavorful and tender.

This is a simple, fast recipe with excellent results.

The chicken was just delicious. I had it with capellini; it has to be good with a number of other sides. I used a $10, pretty good bottle of wine and we drank some of the rest with dinner - I think that's the way to go, don't use a bad base and everything will work out.

After dinner, after numerous compliments, my GF said that this recipe will have to go into the files - does not happen every night!

I tried this last night for the first time and all I can say is this is good! I did add in some fresh cut mushrooms when I sauted the shallots and garlic but other than that no changes.  Served with buttermilk mashed potatoes and glazed carrots. Saving this one in the recipe box.

I didn't have white wine so added a splash of apple cider vinegar and made up for the rest of the liquid with a little extra water.  Still turned out great!  

Hit with the fam!  Delish :)

Tastes a lot like my husband's favorite chicken scampi dish at the chain italian restaurant! I doubled the liquid to make extra sauce, just had to thicken it up a bit at the end with some flour. We also like to add red and yellow peppers along with extra garlic. Serve with angel hair pasta and a nice glass of wine!

Omitted white wine just because I didn't have it, but added extra 1/2 C water to make up the liquid amount. Added extra bouillon, too (which turned out not to be such a great idea, it was too bouillon-y.. the one cube called for in the recipe would probably have been perfect, even with the extra 1/2C water). Definitely will make again, very tasty!

very easy and quick. only gave it 4 stars because it was a tiny bit bland. HOWEVER, it's nothing that couldn't be fixed. My husband, 2 and 4 year old children LOVED it!!! Dinner was very quiet due to people eating it up;) Will definitely make again.

The dish was tasty, but I hoped that the sauce would thicken a bit.  Although the sauce was very thin, it still tasted great when I drizzled it over the pasta.

I used 3 chicken breasts and cut them into bite size pieces.  I didn't have shallots so I used 1/2 an onion (will use 1/4 next time).  Also, instead of the water and bouillon I just used 1 cup of chicken broth and I squeezed half a lemon into the sauce too.  When I removed the chicken I added a slurry of cornstarch and water to the sauce.  I then added the chicken back to the pan and simmered everything together.  I served it over white rice.

This dish needed a little background sweetness.  I used chicken broth (instead of white wine and water as directed), so it's probably my fault.  A sweet white wine may have provided what I thought was missing.  For me, I'll make it again using chicken broth, but I'll add some marmalade, brown sugar, or a little honey.

def add salt and pepper to flour before frying.  Also, add the garlic to the oil before the chicken.  Might also add some capers next time. Overall very good!

This was a tasty skillet recipe that was fairly light and very easy to make.  I thickened the sauce just a bit as was suggested by a couple of other reviewers and served over penne pasta. I served steamed brocolli as a side along with a nice chardonay.  Definately will make again.

I never cook - I had to look up what it meant to dredge and how to mince garlic and shallots.  This meal was awesome - even my 15 year old enjoyed it.  I will definitely make it again.

I didn't give this 5 stars because I would have loved to have more sauce.  If you serve the chicken with pasta or rice it seems there isn't enough sauce.  Other than that the sauce was delicious!

This was tasty, but not robust.  I needed to add more butter and garlic than the recipe called for, and I did put garlic pepper on the chicken before I coated it with flour.  I beat the chicken with my meat tenderizer to make it fairly flat, which helped it cook quickly.  With the leftovers, I added a laughing cow wedge of cheese before reheating, and then stirred it all around.  Yum!!

This was very good.  I used chicken broth seasoned with herbs and lemon instead of the water/bouillon.  Served over angel hair pasta.  Super easy, super quick.  This is a keeper.

Delicious and easy!  I followed the recipe exactly with 2 exceptions. Since I had almost 2 lbs. of chicken, I sliced it thin and browned it in two batches.  I kept the browned chicken warm in a low temp oven.  The only other change was to squeeze half a lemon's juice into the sauce as it cooked down.  The chicken was tender and the sauce thickened perfectly when the chicken was added back in.  A nice enough dish to serve to company, but easy to make on a weeknight, too, since it uses common pantry items.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Except for leaving out the shallots I made this as is, and served it with rice.  Interesting that so many people couldn't get the sauce to thicken but mine easily cooked to half, and adding the chicken back in just cooked the sauce right up and there was none.  This does make it a bit boring looking and less tasty as the flavor's in the sauce.  So 2nd time I didn't cook it down at all and instead used the liquid to cook the rice in, then threw the chicken in to heat.  I cut the chicken even smaller that time so it was easy to eat with the rice which had all the flavor.

UNBELIEVABLE!! One of the best dishes I've ever turned out of my kitchen. My wife couldn't believe how delicious this was.  After reading reviews I did make some changes.  I added 1/2 teaspoon each of pepper and garlic salt to the flour before dredging.  I doubled the sauce using 1 whole shallot, 1 small onion, 4 cloves of garlic and substituted chicken broth for the water (used a teaspoon of "Better Than Bullion" with the broth).  I ended up skimming about 1/2 the onion/shallot remnants from the sauce but I think it definitely added to the flavor.  Since the sauce wasn't thickening, I added 1/2 cup half and half with 2 tbsp flour to thicken it.  Served it over your choice of rice or angel hair pasta - both were outstanding!

Super!!  Had to double the sauce and add a little cornstarch/water mixture to thicken it up but still great!  Used regular onion and did have to fry two batches of chicken.  So only drawback is that it took me much longer than recipe says.

This was great!  My whole family loved it.  I served it with whole wheat pasta and a salad.  I made the recipe exactly as is except I added some capers.  They are not necessary but I had them and thought I would just add them.  Next time I think I will also add some sauted mushrooms.  Neither the capers or the mushrooms are necessary...just personal favorites.  The recipe is excellent on its own.

My husband and I thought this was just OK.  Followed recipe as stated.  It was a little bland, probably should use chicken broth instead of water and bouillon. Not really my taste and not sure if I will make again.

My husband is a fabulous, intuitive cook. I can cook because I can read. I made this all on my own and he commented on it for days. The presentation with a great salad and good wine ( lots of the second) made for a nice, romantic dinner ! Highly recommended for unsure cooks!

This was excellent, I served with rice (I put some chicken boullion in the rice water) and followed the recipe with only a couple of exceptions.  I added some lemon juice with the wine/water/boullion mixture.  I also added a little bit of flour (maybe 2 T) after the garlic and shallots had softened, stirred it in until it was incorporated into the veggie mixture, then added the remainder of the liquids.  The sauce turned out nice and thick and was great with the chicken over the rice.  Excellent recipe and will definitely add to our favorites.  Great for dinner guests although this time I made it for hubby and me plus my mom who was visiting!  We all loved it.

Yummy!  I like things spicier so I added paprika, ground cloves, dry mustard, and oregano to liven it up.  I used cubed round steak on my second attempt.  Makes it very versatile.  A favorite from now on.

I followed the advice of other reviews, replaced the water with chicken broth and added a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. I also added a little extra white wine, and 1 T. of cornstarch mixed with 2 T. cold water to thicken the sauce. It was fantastic! I'll definitely make this again.

I really wanted to like this because it has so many ingredients that I love; white wine, shallots, garlic, rosemary. I don't know, maybe it was just me, maybe I cut my chicken too thick, but it took forever for the chicken to cook through that I ended up having to add more liquid. Anyway, it ended up being too much hassle for just an ok taste at the end.

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I doubled the recipe and served it over white rice.  I did not have shallots or white wine;  I used dried minced onion and extra water instead.  I used a tad less minced onion and rosemary then called for and a little more salt and pepper.  I thought the rosemary added a nice flavor, but was not overpowering. (My family enjoys mild flavor - we are not a spicy bunch.)  You can reduce the sauce as much or as little as you like.  The flour from the dredged chicken helps to thicken the sauce and I found the flavors intensified as the sauce reduced.  The family requested that I make this often - I will add it to my rotation - it was something a little different to do with chicken and we all really liked it.

Really liked this recipe. I mistakenly pounded the chicken breasts thin instead of cutting them into strips but they still turned out great. I followed the advice of others and added garlic powder, salt, and pepper to the flour. Also, I didn't have any dried rosemary so I substituted Italian seasoning and I thought the flavour was really good. I will try it with rosemary next time to compare,  This recipe was a definate hit in my house

Ok - here is the verdict.  I took the other members' advice and replaced the water with chicken broth, I added some garlic powder to the flour added a small can of mushrooms, and quadrupuled the amount of sauce for 2 1/2 lbs of chicken.  Yes, there is ALOT of sauce!   I liked the dish very much and agree with the other member that the rosemary makes the dish.  Although I liked the recipe, and it was very good, it didn't "Wow" me.  Thats the reason why I didn't give it 5 stars....because it lacked the "wow" factor for me.  I would make it again.  I have to say that the rosemary makes the dish very unique tasting and doesn't taste like your "every day" meal.  It has a very light and delicate flavor.  This dish is worth the effort.

This was awesome!  Following the advice of previous reviews, I added more wine, some garlic powder to the chicken while cooking, and used chicken broth instead of the water/bouillon mixture (but I did sprinkle in extra buillon, as it needs the extra kick when served over angel hair, which cuts the flavor).  It was so good that my friend made me make it again in the same week.  I added lemon the second time, and that was good too.

The flavor was very good, but I didn't care for the resultant sauce, or lack thereof.  I added mushrooms and lemon juice to mine, along with some starch toward the end to thicken the sauce a bit.

Delicious!  This recipe was simple, quick & delicious.  Next time I will add more wine since I really wanted to sop up the sauce.

I can't see how anyone wouldn't give this 5 stars.  I've probably made it a dozen times and finally got around to rating it.  The only thing I do different is add more chicken broth in place of the water, and add garlic powder to the flour before coating the chicken.  Served over butter and garlic spaghetti.  Excellent!

Very good, husband loved it. A little too salty, I'll probably cut down on the boullion next time (i use a paste, not cubes)

The aroma and flavor of this dish while cooking was incredible.  I added mushrooms (because I had them, and I love them) and used chicken stock instead of water (I still used the bouillon cubes for extra flavor).  Delicious served over rice. Will definitely make again.

Great flavor.  I reduced the wine mixture longer than recommended and added a small amount of flour and water to thicken.  Served with rice.

Easy and delicious! I used more shallots, garlic, and boullion as my husband prefers a more intense flavor, but the recipe was wonderful. I will be serving this one again! Thank you for sharing, Jill M.

Really really good! I'll omit the salt next time as the bouillon gave it plenty of flavor with the additional salt at the end. That's the only change I would make. Thanks!

Chicken Scarpariello Haiku: "'Sauce' never thickened. Would be easier whole breast, and not cut before." Tough to flip and brown the chicken cut into those slender strips, so if I made this again, I'd brown the breast and cut to serve. Also the "sauce" which smelled divine, never got to any point of thickening, and I see that several reviewers suggest swirling in a flour or cornstarch slurry at the end. We ate ours over a mixture of half "zoodles" half spaghetti. My husband proclaimed the leftovers much, much better, especially w/ a heavier squirt of fresh lemon juice and parmesan cheese.

I made the recipe pretty much to a T. I pounded out the breasts instead of slicing them and sprinkled a touch of flour to the shallots and garlic to thinking the sauce. DELICIOUS!!

This was so good! I added some sliced cremini mushrooms (sauteed them with the shallots and garlic), used fresh rosemary instead of dried, and served over pasta. I think this one's a keeper.

The first time my boyfriend and I tried to make it,  we added a little too much extras. We replaced the water with broth as another reviewer stated, however,  we also added the chicken bullion, and It came out way too salty. This time around, I added the broth instead of water and used the goya chicken bullion packets (just a sprinkle), I had no scallions so I utilized what I had, which were yellow onions and a sprinkle of flour in the sauce to thicken the mixture. The rest was as the recipe asked for. I have to tell u, my oldest son is my food critic. He came out for seconds:-) awesome sign that the food was fantastic. I have to agree:-) lol happy cooking:-)

Great flavor.  After letting the sauce reduce to about half (it was hard to tell, since it was still very liquidy, so I did it by taste) I decided to add the cooked angel hair to the pan.  I let it soak and simmer for another 3 minutes, then added the chicken and let things go for another 2 minutes.  By then, most of the liquid was soaked so there was a good amount of "sauce".  We also threw some parm cheese on top.

If you don't have someone helping you in the kitchen make sure you have everything prepped before starting. Luckily, my husband was on standby to help me cut stuff up because I went in a little unprepared. That being said, this is a great recipe. 
If you boil down your sauce too much, don't panic. Let it go until it becomes a little like a paste and then add a half cup of water and allow it to come to the right consistency. I didn't really need to use flour to thicken the sauce and I didn't get something soupy like others have, so hopefully that will help.
All and all we really enjoyed this one. There are numerous vegetables, like broccoli and spinach, that could be added to make this a true meal on its own.

Delicious!  Made this for a family dinner last night (had the sister in law and nieces over) and everyone inhaled it.  Wish I'd made more!  I did adjust--no scallops, left out the wine, forgot the rosemary and added more flour to make a thicker gravy.  I also added seasoned salt to the flour mix I put on the chicken.  So easy and relatively quick.  My picky niece didn't even blink an eye and was trying to eat before we'd all been served.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was simple and quick, but a little lacking in flavor. It sort of tasted like chicken noodle soup when I served it over angel hair pasta. That said, the chicken was tender, so I think perhaps with an addition of more spice and some crushed red pepper, this would be a dish I'd repeat.

This was a simple dish.  Followed other suggestions and salt and peppered my chicken before flour coating.  Used dried thyme as we didn't have any rosemary, and added just a tiny bit of cornstarch to thicken up the sauce.  Served with angel hair pasta.  It was a bit bland, and next time I might throw in something else to give it a little more flavor.  There is also no way this makes 2 servings.  We mixed ours in with some pasta and it's more like 4-6 servings.

This is really, really good!  The recipe "as is" makes a lot of sauce - it would be perfect over pasta.  Next time I will omit the flour coating on the chicken as it got a bit soggy after sitting in the sauce for awhile.

Made this for the first time 2 nights ago. Direct quote from my picky 10 yr old "This is a keeper" and from my hubby "I'd eat this again!"  It was tasty, simple to make and the only change I made was to add a slurry of 1 t. cornstarch mixed with 1 t. water to help the sauce thicken a bit while it was simmering based on other reviews I read. Thanks for the recipe !

This was unbelievably forgettable and bland for something that has been rated so highly. I followed the recipe fairly closely, except for adding garlic to the sauteeing onions and adding some salt and pepper to the flour in which the chicken was coated. My husband and I were disappointed and frankly, disgusted. What a waste of good ingredients.

I really liked this dish. It's really easy to prepare. I served it over angel hair pasta but I'm looking forward to trying it with rice.  One thing that I did do to it was to thicken the sauce a bit more.

Good recipe but I will make some minor changes next time. Chicken tenderloins cook faster than the breasts. Kitchen Basic makes a "stock in the box" that is quite low sodium but on the expensive side. I will add some fat free 1/2 & 1/2 to the sauce along with a little parmesan cheese. And finally, garnish with thinly sliced scallions or chives. Serve over pasta of choice.

Delicious! I did add heavy cream as suggested on another review. Served over vermicelli pasta. Will surely make again.

This was sooo tasty!! I have hardly any cooking experience and this was simple enough.  I didn't have any white wine on hand so I replaced it with a 1/2 cup  of apple juice.  Served with angel hair pasta and bruschetta! Very yummy!

I thought this was fantastic!  I followed the recipe to the tee except for omitting the chicken bouillon cube and replacing the water for 1 cup chicken broth.  This is a keeper!  Thank you for sharing!

I loved this recipe - it was easy to make and very good.  The only thing I would have changed is that I would have added some lemon to it - in fact I did after it was on the table, I just squeezed some over everything and it was exactly what I was missing.

This is by far the best, and probably most elegant, chicken recipe I've tried in a long time.  I used fresh chicken breast tenders because they're moist, juicy, and make the perfect size strips.  I subbed chicken broth for the wine and cut the amount of oil in half just to shave off a few calories and fat grams.  It was fantastic!

I never have time to cook a real meal after work, but I did it with this recipe. It was delicious! Tasted like far more effort went into it. I used thin sliced boneless breast, but did not cut it into pieces, just used the whole breast halves to make it even easier. Used a cup of chicken stock instead of water and bouillon. The rosemary flavor was heavenly!  Will definitely make again many times.

My husband found this recipe and it is a keeper! This dish not only tastes wonderful but has the best aroma while cooking.  We added three chicken breasts to the dish so had to also add more white wine and cream to make enough sauce.

This was far and away the best recipe I've pulled off this website.  I was upset that I didn't make a larger recipe because I really wanted leftovers.  I can only imagine how good it would take after sittting in the sauce for another day.

Decent. I think I expected it to be more garlic-y, more like a Milanese without the lemon. It was more like a Francaise, which is also good, just not what I expected.

Definitely has delicate or subtle flavor.  I added salt and pepper to the flour before dredging, but would add more seasonings next time as I thought it was a little under-flavored. I also added fresh mushrooms and plenty of fresh rosemary. Served this tender chicken and sauce over thin spaghetti, and we added grated parmesan cheese over the top to give it little more zip.  Very nice.

This was pretty good. Very simple but tasty. However, this makes waaaaay more than two servings, more like 5 or 6. I think that would cut back the calorie content quite a bit. By my calculations, it should only be about 250 calories for 5 servings. Not too bad!

This was a very easy and tasty chicken dish. The recipe supposedly makes only two servings, but I found it to be more like four or five. I added extra garlic, because my cloves were pretty small. It was very yummy served over egg noodles. I will probably make this again. Thanks for sharing!

After reading several reviews about how soupy the sauce was, I decided to add the flour/water mixture after I'd reduced the liquid for four minutes. I used a whisk to make sure it was incorporated completely, reduced the heat to med low, and let that cook for two minutes. Then I added my chicken and mushrooms and simmered on low for another five minutes. As I mentioned, I sauteed some mushrooms after I cooked the chicken, but before I sauteed the garlic and shallots. I added more olive oil and butter to the skillet because my chicken had absorbed almost all of the fat. Remove them from the skillet and add them to the bowl/plate you're using to keep the chicken warm, then add both back to the sauce at the end. My sauce ended up quite thick, almost entirely glazing the chicken, not much to pour over pasta. So next time I'll either serve it with a starch that is creamy on its own (like risotto) or skip the starch altogether and serve with vegetables.

Can I give this more than 5?  It was absolutely delicious.  I made double the sauce so I could eat it over boiled new potatoes, but  instead ended up with wonderfully glazed chicken with not much sauce left in the pan...  instead of dredging the chicken in the flour (which I seasoned with a small amount of poultry seasoning, salt, and pepper) I shook the chicken pieces to coat in a plastic bag.  Used a sweet white wine from a local winery, and substituted homemade chicken broth instead of water and boullion.  The rosemary added such a nice taste.  I'm not one that usually enjoys leftovers, but I'm looking forward to these...

This was exactly what I wanted for dinner tonight! I made some extra sauce so that I could top my rice with it. After reading the reviews I realized that the flour on the chicken was likely not enough to thicken the sauce as other reviewers had mentioned, so I used about a tablespoon of Wondra at the end to finish the sauce off. Also I used Chardonnay wine.

Quick, easy and delicious! Splashed a little bit of Half & Half and lemon juice in.  Omitted the shallots because I didn't have any.  Added in a bit of Parmesan cheese.  Thickened the sauce with flour.  Served over LEMON PEPPER PASTA.

Sauce is very delicate....unfortunately, my household more enjoys more robust flavors so this was a little lost on us. I served with thin pasta, but I would recommend maybe homemade mashed potatoes with the sauce drizzled over. Plus it would be more filling.

Made this last night with brown rice and a salad. Not too bad. I just wish the sauce was thicker, instead of broth-like. I did add a little cream, but I still wasn't pleased with the sauce's consistency. I do recommend seasoning the flour before coating the chicken though.

This was a very good dish. The only change I made was adding a splash of lemon juice and a tbls of butter to the sauce towards the end. Once you add the chicken to the sauce it thickens right up. This was so yummy and the rosemary added the perfect taste to it. Definately a keeper in my book.

I just made this dish tonite and I have to say, it tasted delicious.  I added some lemon juice and parmesan cheese towards the end.  My only thing was that I wished the sauce was a little thicker...I know that you can add some flour, but I'm so bad with thickening up sacues/making gravy.  I honestly felt this tasted like something from an italian restaurant!  I think steamed veggies like green beans, zucchini, carrots, & broccolli tossed in the sauce with the chicken would be a great addition for a nice dinner.  Would certainly make it again.

Easy Simple Recipe.  I am rating a four instead of a five because I forgot the Rosemary and it was very bland.  Don't forget the rosemary and/or your favorite seasonings.

Very simple, yet quite tasty. Gobbled up by my dinner guests. I used chicken tenders and they came out perfectly.

I'm not sure where to begin.  It was quick, easy, the taste was decent, no one complained (we were very hungry and I got a late start figuring out what to make for dinner).... but it just wasn't that nice to look at.    I made the recipe as listed  because I needed something NOW... usually I look at the reviews and take recommendations from the other cooks if they sound like what my family would enjoy more so than just blindly following the recipe when I know in fact something simply won't work for us.  In this case, I needed more flour, as well as more oil and butter.  The chicken cooked up fine, but when I added it to the reduced sauce, the flour coating came almost completely off... so while the flour thickened the sauce as expected, the chicken underneath just wasn't that pretty....and I thought it was rather unappetizing to look at.    I WILL say that the chicken was nice and tender.... like the texture was VERY nice and the flavors of the spices/garlic/shallot/wine were perfect for my family, the sauce though... I would probably set to the side and whisk it smoother, and then either re-combine with the chicken or just leave it on the side completely.   Truthfully, I really would give this another shot, but insure I was not rushed so I could really pay attention to tweaks I could make to have it present better. It is a good start, though!  I would say 3 1/2 stars.

This was not a favorite.  I think the coating of the flour made the chicken taste soggy and the sauce lacked any real zing.  Plus my sauce never thickened up, so when I spooned it over rice it was watery.  The over all taste was fine.  This dish is okay but nothing special.

it's a decent & very easy recipe to follow. i had to add a little flour to the sauce to thicken it up a little though.

We enjoyed this recipe but I did also alter it by using onions (we did not have Shallots) and also using chicken broth instead of bouillion. It came out very tasty!

This easy & quick to make. Didn't have shallots, so, as suggested, I used half of a small onion, in addition only had 1/4 cup of white wine, so I made up the difference with chicken broth. This will definitely be a regular on our menu.

So delicious! My boyfriend gobbled everything up I'm upset I don't have any left overs for lunch! Couple changes..I used chicken broth instead of bouillon and a small onion instead of the shallots and used chicken tenderloins (instead of chicken breast)..I thought they were perfect because it eliminated having to cut them down to size. This will absolutely be in our regular dinner rotation from now on.

This was AMAZING!!! I added a chopped bell pepper and two small chopped tomatoes to the dish during the last 5 minutes of cooking, and ate it over jasmine rice. I also doubled the garlic and cut the chicken in bite size pieces. My husband took the leftovers for lunch to work today. Delicious!!

This was a fantastic recipe!  I followed the feedback of another member, subbing chicken stock for the water, adding lemon juice, and a little four-water mixture.  I don't think I would have enjoyed it quite so much without said changes, that's why I gave it 4 stars.  I pounded out my chicken breasts before cooking, the result being I could cut them with a fork - so juicy & tender!!  Serve with grated parmesean cheese.  YUMMM!!!

This recipe was quite good. My whole family enjoyed...even my five year old (who is a hard sell on everything). I followed the recipe pretty much exactly except that I followed the instructions of other reviewers and added a tiny bit of flour water at the end and used chicken broth instead of boullion. The only other change I did was that I used garlic butter marinated chicken breasts that they had at my grocery store at the meat counter. I served it all over angel hair pasta. My family said it is a definite repeater!

I followed the recipe. I gave this 4 stars because some really liked it and others just thought it was okay. I think I will try again but add more garlic and thicken the sauce like other reviewers suggested.

Simple and quick to cook.  This one went over great with the picky eaters in my house.  Season flour with salt and pepper,  Use chicken stock instead of water.  I added fresh rosemary, WOW!  I will continue to make this dish forever...

Fantastic recipe.  Delicate blend of ingredients make this a sure-fire winner. A couple of modifications I made:  added the juice of 1/2 lemon and added a bit of flour to thicken the sauce.

I think with fresh rosemary or another herb as the front note it would be okay, but even with adding spices to my flour and more garlic to the saute, I found this recipe unremarkable.

Hmm. I doubled the recipe and used 1/4 cup of lemon juice and 3/4 cup of water instead of the 1 cup of white wine. Overall we didn't think the flavours went together very well and it was quite strong. I also had to cook it for over 10 minutes for the liquid to reduce and had to add cornflour dissolved in hot water to thicken the sauce up. I won't be making this recipe again, I just didn't care for it.

Very easy to make and very tasty. We served it over whole wheat pasta & added frozen peas to the sauce. We also left out the rosemary and added a bit of lemon juice like previous posts had suggested. Excellent, light flavor. Thanks!

My husband does not like wine, so I ommitted that, but there was definitely something missing.  I ended up adding quite a bit of lemon juice.  I'm not sure how much I added, but it made all the difference.  I also added some cayenne pepper and some red pepper flakes for heat and served it over fetuccine.  We put some parmesan cheese on top and thought it made for great dinner.

OMG!! This recipe was melt in your mouth good :) I do love the addition of the lemon (go easy on it though) and adding flour to the sauce to thicken it and using chicken stock instead of water. It was really good and I used toasted bread so I could finish up the sauce.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did make a few changes.  I used 1cup chicken broth instead of mixing the bullion and water.  I also added a little lemon juice and used fresh rosemary because  I had it. Served over couscous, it was delicious.  All of the kids even ate it!  Will definitely make again.

Delicious! I actually added a little extra Rosemary, because we love it. I also used chicken broth. Served with rice.

I liked it.  The wife rated it 3 stars.  I think the rosemary was just a touch strong.  Maybe scale it back a hair or two.  Others liked it also.  Not 5 stars but quite good.

I followed suit with many of you here and changed this up a bit.  I added salt, pepper, onion and parlic powder to the flower before dredging.  Increased the liquids to make more sauce and used chicken stock instead of water/bullion and used fresh Thyme instead of rosemary( whole sprigs during the reduction and removed for serving.

Yummy!  Took some advice from others and doubled the sauce.  I also added a little cream to the sauce because I wanted the sauce a little creamier so I could serve it over white rice.  Thanks

I thought the leftovers were even better the next day

This was an excellent dish. I served it with the "Rich Pasta from A Poor Kitchen" recipe from here and it was delish. I don't think I will add the rosemary next time though. I think it is too distracting.

I tried this recipe looking for another way of making chicken and I was totally pleased.  My family loved it and so did my best friend who happend to stop by.  She liked it so much that she asked me for a copy and she passed it out at Easter dinner to 4 of her relatives.
The only thing that I did different was I doubled up on the ingredients (except the chicken) to make more of the sause.  My family likes more sauce. Other than that - WONDERFUL RECIPE!  Even my 70 year old Mom cooked it up and loved it!  Good Going!

Very Good.  I used 3/4 cup each of water and wine; the former since it would just evaporate off anyway and the extra wine because that was how much was in the bottle.  Served it over linguini with green beans on the side.

This was very good and quick.  The chicken turns out very tender.  I used 4 large garlic cloves, sliced mushrooms (saute w/butter & olive oil), and used 1 c. chicken broth, with about 2 Tbsp. chopped fresh rosemary instead of dried.  Season to taste.  Yummmm

This was a big hit at my house -- it was very easy to make and I served it over jasmine rice.  The only change I made was to use prepared chicken broth instead of the bouillon.  I think next time I will add mushrooms and maybe a little lemon.  Definitely a keeper!

Terrific, very easy to make. Usually I change things but I didn't change a thing. My daughter was eating the sauce right out of the pan and she is picky. Will definetly make it again. Maybe I will add some parmesan cheese next time. Thank you!!!!!

Since I was cooking for two, I used only two chicken breasts, diced. At the end, I added a half can of cream of chicken and a little milk. This went well with mashed potatoes.

this dish yeah woz kinda real good. gooooddd. but..its best to make the souce a lot thicker and also add mushrooms to the dish. actually it goes better with mashed spud (taties, potatoes or whatever ya call it) rather than pasta (thats wot I fink anyway). also cut the chicken in to smaller pieces than suggested. it cooks better 'n quicker. any way thanks a lot Gill.Gillyyyy!!

This recipe is missing the sweet Italian sausage.  I also added  hot cherry peppers as well as red bell peppers.  In place of the angel hair pasta I added roasted potatoes.  Thanks for the base recipe for Chicken Scarpariello.

So easy and delicious. Made two pounds of it last night alongside pasta and my roommate and I liked it so much, we each ate an entire pound of the chicken! Making it again tonight and it will definitely be part of my regular rotation moving forward.

Delicious. I pretty much followed the recipe.  I used vegan butter which worked out fine browning the chicken.  I added a little flour, about 1 Tbl., to the 1 cup of broth before adding to the pan as other reviewers had suggested to thicken the sauce.  I didn't serve with pasta, there really isn't that much sauce, I suppose the sauce part could be doubled if you really want it with pasta, but I served it with roasted potatoes and lemon pepper string beans and it was SO good.  I will make this often.  I would definitely serve this to company.

It was okay. It was better after a few changes. I halved chicken breasts to make them thinner. I then added salt and pepper and a sprinkle of garlic powder to the chicken. I used yellow onions. I added about 2 tbl of butter to the minced garlic and onions. I also added a splash of lemon juice. Since the sauce was very thin, I had to mix about a tbl of corn starch with water to the sauce. I then added the chicken to the sauce. The sauce was quite good. The chicken was rather tough, though. Next time, I think I'll take it off the flame sooner.

This recipe was easy to make, but flavor wise was just OK to us. The chicken was very tender and moist, but just seemed bland. Overall, while the recipe worked fine and was still good, we felt underwhelmed. I think this recipe also serves more than 2 people, but I did serve over pasta—had abut 1.5 lbs chicken and we had plenty of leftovers for 1 lunch and for dinner the next day (just the 2 of us). I made this almost as written, but made some simple changes mainly due to dietary restrictions (salt and pepper on the chicken out of habit before dredging with flour (used gluten free flour); used 1.5 cups chicken stock instead of bouillon, subbed white wine with 1.5 tbsp lemon juice—common sub is 1 tbsp lemon juice for every 1 cup stock). I had some mini bells to use up, sliced them and lightly sautéed along with the shallot and garlic. I had no problems with the sauce thickening especially after adding in the chicken. I actually felt we’d need more sauce. So, I added close to 1 more cup of stock plus additional 1 tbsp lemon juice and the sauce thickened up nicely. No need for that slurry business other reviewers noted, but I did deglaze my pan, which the recipe doesn’t tell you to do, but you will need to do so. The sauce seemed to be missing something so I swirled in another tablespoon of butter and that helped. I roasted some broccoli as well and tossed it in to just warm up. Next time, I would add more salt and pepper to the chicken before dredging, definitely would use at le

My modifications: seasoned the flour with Italian seasoning, salt, pepper; when I added the garlic and shallots to the pan, I also added a bit of the broth and 2 fresh cubanelle peppers sliced into rings. After a bout 5-6 minutes, added the remaining broth and wine (used chicken broth instead of bouillion cube and water) and a pile of jarred hot cherry peppers. (I had doubled the whole recipe). I let this all cook down for about 10-12 minutes, added back the chicken for about 5 min. Served over fresh linguini. This was incredible!!  Can't wait to make again and again!! (not sure why my photo was such a blurred close up on this page, my shot was a wider view of whole pan, it didn't look sloppy and mushy, lol)

If you plan to serve it over white rice, double the sauce, trust me! 
Also, I added salt and pepper to the flour before I dredged the chicken.

Loved this dish.  However I didn't have any wine or rosemary so I substituted the wine with chic broth and 1 tbsp vinegar and Italian seasoning.  Will definitely make it again.

I loved this recipe. Super easy to make and fantastic flavor. My family loved it. This will be a repeat at our house. I pick out recipes by the star ratings and the comments. This one will not disappoint. I included for the sides mashed potatoes, broccoli,  corn and rice. I gotta fill these kids up. :)
It was a winner. Thank you everyone for being honest with your comments. It really helps.

My son and I LOVED this easy recipe.  We made it with a few modifications -- added sliced sausage and capers, used fresh rosemary, used the broth instead of water, and mixed in some roasted red potatoes.  This may sound like a lot of adjustments, but the underlying recipe is very tasty.  Making it again tonight!  :-P

This is delicious and I've used this recipe for years, however the times given for reducing and thickening are off by quiet a bit. It generally takes about 4x as long. I must note that I do adjust the serving size from 2 to 8 usually, so that might make a big difference. I would suggest keeping this in mind when planning your meal. But it's worth the wait, regardless.

Loved the flavor for a change of pace.  I salt and peppered the chicken lightly before flouring like another reviewer mentioned. And the other minor change was to add the bouillon cube to the skillet with the water and wine so that I didn't dirty another pan. Once the broth boiled it dissolved the cube. Make sure to reduce the liquid. It makes a nice glaze to coat the chicken.  I served with angel hair and broccoli. Perfect combo.

Delicious and easy! I followed everyone's suggestions: used chicken broth, but added a little bouillon, too; added extra broth and wine for more sauce; thickened sauce before putting chicken back in pan. I was concerned because I don't love rosemary, but it was very subtle. Next time, I'll add mushrooms. Served with penne pasta. Very good and little mess!

WOW! Sooooo good!!! Upon reviewing the simple ingredient list, I was expecting an "average" dish, but what I ended up with FAR exceeded that! Not only was this SUPER flavorful, it made for an easy weeknight meal. I often make changes to most new recipes I try, but didn't feel the need to this time. Other than liberally seasoning my chicken with s&p (I skipped adding s&p to my sauce), I made no changes. A TRUE recipe is one that can stand on its own without needing ANY enhancements or improvements. If you are looking for the REAL deal, search no further. This IS as authentic as it gets! Rotini pasta complemented our chicken nicely. Roasted asparagus and glasses of the leftover chardonnay (that I used in the sauce) completed our meal. Thanks SO much for sharing this great Italian classic, Jill! I'm adding your recipe to my "keeper" file right now! :-)

Very good, French tasting chicken dish (although the name sounds Italian). Perhaps I felt a French vibe because I squeezed half a lemon over all before serving and I'd do it again!

This was good but not quite 5 stars for us.  The description that Jill gives as "delicate" is very accurate.  My husband and I like lots of flavor and to us this was a little too bland, even though I added lemon-pepper and garlic-pepper seasoning to the flour.  I also squeezed some lemon juice over it at the table.  It's just a matter of personal taste, and if you like mild flavors, you will probably love this dish.

The 1st time I made this recipe (as written), it was good.  The 2nd time I made it, I mixed with a Chicken Piccata recipe.  I added lemon pepper and seasoned salt to the flour.  Then I quickly sauteed in butter/olive oil, as well as chopped garlic and onions.  I let the chicken then bake another 20 or so minutes while I mixed 1 cup chicken broth and 1/2 cup white wine mixed with extra lemon juice.  (No bouillon/water) Let that simmer for the 20 minutes the chicken was baking.  Added some wondra to thicken up to a glaze, and then topped the chicken with the glaze once coated.  YUM!

This is absolutely fabulous!Super easy, too. The flour on the chicken thickens the sauce up nicely. My husband requested that we make more sauce next time. I cooked a clove of garlic with the chicken then I added only one clove to the sauce

I've made this a million times and my husband and I just love it. I originally got the recipe from my mom and she got it in a Weight Watchers Cookbook. I've committed it to memory though and I don't even need  it written down. I use onions instead of shallots and I use a whole onion because I love onions. I also usually add another 1/4 of a cup of wine. If it's too thin I just use a little cornstarch to thicken it up. Definitely a wonderful, easy, tasty recipe.

This was a delicious, quick, easy-to-prepare meal. It has a light, mild taste. I did cut back on the garlic since I'm not a huge fan. I served it with rice, which soaked up the wine sauce nicely. Next I will try it with pasta. I think it would be great with angel hair. Can't wait to make (read: eat) it again!

I found this recipe tonight on my way home from work, while on the train. I picked it because I knew I had all of the ingredients. I substituted a few things because I didn't have the original ingredients. I substituted beer for wine and thyme + oregano for the rosemary. It was still really great.  The whole thing took 30 minutes, which was great!

This chicken was very simple and delicious.  The only change I made to the recipe was to use Italian seasoning instead of only rosemary.  The simple ingredients yield a very flavorful result.  In order to thicken the sauce, an extra teaspoon of flour was necessary.  For a simple meal, one could easily double the sauce to toss with some angel hair.  Serve chicken on top, perhaps with some capers tossed in.  Definitely a meal that would be impressive served to company.

So so good! I did not dredge the chicken in flour simply because I forgot. I used fresh rosemary instead of dried and added some heavy cream. I also will next time double the sauce next time as we wanted more to coat the pasta we were serving it over.

I used low-sodium chicken stock instead of water and bullion to cut down on salt. Flavor was good, but it could've used more sauce. Would consider doubling the liquid next time.

This was a great recipe but for personal taste I think I would add another Garlic clove.  I also added some Creme Fraiche at the end and it was even better.  I will definately be following this recipe again.

This was so tasty I kept sampling from the pan before my boyfriend got home!  Relied on others' recommendations of a little additional flour to thicken sauce.  Fresh lemon squeezed on top = phenomenal!

Just made this for dinner and it was FABULOUS!  Of course I too tweaked it a little.  I did use the bouillon and water, but I used bisquick instead of flour.  I seasoned the bisquick with some of the seasoning from the melting pot as well as "Rileys" seasoning.  I also did as another reviewer said and sauteed a little garlic with the oil and butter before putting the chicken in.  I used white zinfandel and used a little (maybe 1/2 tsp) of the bisquick to thicken.   I will definately be making this again!!

I really liked this recipe.  I followed it exactly and even though the sauce looks a little thin, it thickens when you put the chicken back in.  I used a pinot Grigio for the wine and it was delicious!  I have a very picky family and they ate it up! I will definitely be making this again.

I really enjoyed this dish! I wasn't sure I would since it used rosemary and I'm not the biggest fan of it. But I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome. Normally when I try a recipe, I follow it to a "T" so I can give a fair and honest review. If I decide to make it a second time, that's when I "tweak" it. This time, however, I did make one change - I added S&P and some Italian seasoning to the flour for dredging the chicken. The rest of the recipe was followed to the letter. I think next time I make this, and there will be a next time, I will add some frozen peas, some red pepper, julienned carrots, etc ... to add a primavera aspect to it.

The sauce was delicious.  I followed some previous advice to saute the shallots and garlic in the oil/butter before cooking the chicken.  I didn't add the rosemary.

Delicious! I have made this three times now and it has been consistently good. I like to add salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the flour and then sprinkle with pepper, as needed, while the chicken is cooking. Served over Basic Microwave Risotto.

Very good.  I did thicken the sauce with a little flour and water and added a 1/2 cup of fresh sliced mushrooms.  I will be making this again soon.

I guess I forgot to review this one.  My daughter loved it and I thought it was good. I had to cook my chicken in 2 batches, but the sauce was yummy and I served it with pasta-spaghetti because I didn't have angel hair.  A little more time consuming, but the results are good.  Thanks for sharing.

Wonderfull taste and very quick. Pulled together from what I had in the pantry. I din't have mushrooms on hand so I left them out, otherwise followed the recipe except for sauteing the garlic before browning the chicken and adding black pepper & salt to the flour.  This is definitely a keeper.

Well this is by far one of my favorite All Recipe dishes!  We have made it 3 times; first as authored and did find the sauce too thin but with beautifully balanced flavor, 2nd time we skipped dredging the chicken and instead browned them with part butter & part oil for more brown color and then added cornstarch water mix at the end and it worked out to a fabulous consistacy we also used Swansons Chicken stock in place of water and bouillon.  The third time we did the same as the 2nd round but added a splash of lemon. Yummy!!    We have served it with Lindberg Risotto, Ore-Ida oven roasted potatos or plain pasta and all are great.  Especially the potatos because they are nice and crisp and soak up the sauce!  We are going to try it out with a nice white flesh fish next time.  This recipes is so wonderful, thank you so very much Jill M!

This was a surprisingly good recipe.  I was a little skeptical at first, but my boyfriend made a couple changes that really made it stand out.  He added some extra seasonings to the dredging flour, such as salt and pepper, and also added flour to the liquid while making the sauce so it would thicken up properly.  It was perhaps even a little TOO thick, but still very tasty.  Also, instead of water and a bouillon cube, he used chicken broth.  We served it all over rice and it was a great, easy dinner; relatively healthful, as well.  Next time we do it I think a splash of lemon juice will really help brighten things up.  Give it a try!

Fabulous...a definite keeper.  I've been looking for a chicken recipe that tastes and presents like this one for a while..the search is over.  I've made this 4 or 5 times now, for 2 and for 10 and each time its a big hit.  I do add a splash of lemon juice as some recommend and it's great.

Excellent as written.  The chicken especially had a great flavor to it.

This was a great dinner. We don't drink or use alcohol so I used a white cooking wine that you can get any grocery. I loved the taste. I like a lot of sauce with my noodeles, so per others suggestions I doubled the sauce. It was to runny- but great flavor. Next time I make this dish I will thicken it up a bit. Thank you for the recipe!

This is a great recipe.  Quick and easy to make.  I typically don't love rosemary, but it wasn't too strong and it added a great flavor to the sauce.  I went with the consensus and thickened the sauce with a water flour slurry.  I was in a rush and didn't make it with pasta, but I think it would taste great on pasta, but you might want to double the sauce.

My review is kind of skewed, since I really tweaked the recipe a lot and so I'm reviewing the results of that.  I had some leftover roasted chicken (so I didn't brown any in the first step, just skipped right to cooking the onion and garlic, to which I added some sliced creminis), no shallots (so I used a chopped white onion), prefer sage to rosemary, felt that this would be good with the addition of some cremini mushrooms and asparagus, and lastly, I followed some other reviewers' suggestions, such as thickening the sauce a bit, adding a touch of cream, and squeezing a bit of lemon juice over the sauce at the finish.  It turned out to be very tasty and my picky 8 y.o. even ate it, so that's saying something.  I believe that this recipe would be very good as written, but is clearly very versatile if you have any ideas of your own about tweaking it.  I will def. make this again and keep the recipe handy in my file.  Thanks for sharing!

1 and 1/2 lb chicken for 2 people? and as some reviewers said add sausage too??? Way too much protein.  I think using 3/4 lb for 2 would be plenty served over pasta.  Have made this before and this seems enough.

Very good. It seemed to be missing something though I didn't have the white wine so I used all chicken broth instead and left out the boullion. I did it with angel hair pasta. Everyone ate it and said it was goo dbut no one really raved about it. I will try it again sometime and see if I can tweek it abit. All in all though pretty good.

This was great. I made the mistake of letting the chicken stay in the pan too long and all the gravy dissappeared, so I had to add water.  Next time I would stick closer to the timing in the recipe.  Tasted good, tho.

Great recipe.  I took another reviewer's advice and added the juice of one lemon and some fresh zest during the last few minutes of reducing the sauce.  I also used a whole can of chicken broth instead of water and still added the boullion.  I think the secret lies in making sure you reduce the sauce by half to concentrate the flavor.  Added a tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken the sauce at the end, threw in a drained can of asparagus because hubby insists on veggies and I had them on hand.  Great flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is very good. I used a small yellow onion instead of shallots. I also had no wine so I used all water. My husband said the sauce was good but it needed more so I will double next time.

I added Italian style bread crumbs in with the flour and it really gave it a nice coating and flavor. I also used low sodium chicken broth instead of bouillon. Turned out fantastic! A nice recipe to serve for a dinner party!

My 7 year old daughter was the only one who liked this. The rosemary did not go well with this. Also it had no flavor. I will not make this again.

This recipe was easy to make and quite tasty.  My 2 year old loved it.  My 3 year old ate the chicken but would not touch the angel hair pasta.  My 7 year old would not even eat it.  I will try this again and serve it over kid freindly pasta.

This made for a really nice meal. I served it over angel hair pasta. For a thicker sauce, I used about half the liquid called for, plus, I threw in some mushrooms. --Supercords
