Green kids love this dish!
Purple people thinks that this dish is weird, though.

the raspberry vinegar is a bit much for such a light dish.  the name is misleading, it's really more of a chocolate pudding with a hint of banana. the tofu/ banana combination is yummy all on its own.

I couldnt find any raspberry vinegar at the store so I didnt use it, instead i just used a mint leaf as garnish and called it good. And it was!
