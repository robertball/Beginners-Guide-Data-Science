I pared down the recipe to fit one package of Costco chicken but otherwise I followed the recipe and proportions. I think I overcooked it in the 45 minutes I baked it because it was kind of dry but my husband liked it that way. I thought it needed more seasoning and more mushrooms for sure but I suppose that is truly in the eyes of the eater! We did enjoy our dinner tonight so thanks Aimes!

I saut√©ed my mushrooms beforehand and added 3 cloves of rough chopped garlic to them. Otherwise I followed the rest of the recipe. Tasty sauce!
