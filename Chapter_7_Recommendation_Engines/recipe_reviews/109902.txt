My daughter made this for a local St Nikolaus festival and came in first place in the baking category!  We tweaked the recipe a bit. We did not add the raisins. After assembling the kuchen, we sprinkled it with cinnamon sugar instead of plain sugar. Also, we used dots of butter instead of drizzling with melted butter.

These cakes are so pretty, my mother thought I'd got them from a bakery. I used Granny Smith apples and only needed 6 for the two cakes. I found the mixture more of a batter than a dough that could be pressed in the pans. So I used a spatula to spread the batter up the sides of the pan. We had this for Mother's Day (in March in the UK) dessert still warm with whipped cream. Many Thanks

Delicious, but this does not "keep" ~ if not eaten right away it gets soggy.  A German woman in my neighborhood says she cubes the apples in small pieces.

Very easy to prepare and absolutely delicious.  The sugar and butter drizzle at the end is a little much, so I just cut it in half and it was still very tasty.  8 apples is subjective based on the size of your apple.  I cut, peeled and cored 8 apples and ended up using about 5.  Also, baking time took more like 45 minutes.  This recipe reminds me of what my grandma used to make.  Thumbs way up!

This is my roommate's new favorite dessert.  She referred to it as "possibly the best thing I've ever eaten."
I substituted currants for the raisins and added a little lemon juice to the apples.  
The first time I used this recipe I had trouble getting them out of the pans.  We ended up just slicing it in the pan, like a pie, but it probably would have been prettier had I been able to get them out.
I tried this again in cupcake tins to make more individualized portions and they turned out really well!  I made 24 total and baked them at 350 for about 20 minutes.
