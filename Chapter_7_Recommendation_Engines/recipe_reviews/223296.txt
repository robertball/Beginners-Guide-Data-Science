this was a really recipe, the garlic and honey mustard were really good together, i actually wanted to just keep eating the sauce until I put it on the pork chop.

Fixed as written. It lacked flavor, and I even used spicy brown mustard. I think it would benefit from salt, chopped garlic and even some red pepper flakes. I also think it would be better if it were just browned in the pan, then covered with the mustard mixture and baked covered in the oven. I will give that a try Before I give up on the recipe

I rarely review a recipe, but this one is so good, it deserves a review. This is a restaurant quality recipe! I made it with sweet and hot stone ground mustard instead of yellow mustard, because that is what I had. I think the yellow mustard would also have been delicious, but the stone ground mustard looks really pretty. I did like some other reviewers and browned the chops, then cooked them at 400 degrees for thirty minutes in the oven. I also cut up some small red potatoes and cooked them around the chops. My, oh my!!! That was soooo good! I served them with some green beans, which were good, but I think something a little more "green" to bring a little brightness to the dish would have really elevated it. Try this recipe. You will be glad you did!

I used Cajun seasoning on the chops with browning.  Covered with sauce and baked them off in a 400 degree oven for 30 min.  Very, very good and easy.  Oh, I also used dijon mustard.  YUM!!

This dish was fabulous! After reading a lot of reviews, I made a few changes. We like a lot of sauce, so I used 1/2 C. of honey, 3 Tbsp of spicy brown mustard, 1Tbsp stone ground mustard, & 1/2 Tbsp Mrs Dash garlic-herb blend. For the spice rub, I used 1Tbsp of the same garlic-herb blend, 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper, and 1/4 tsp salt. I used 5 thick pork chops & the spice mix covered both sides of the chops well. I also added 1 Tbsp olive oil with the butter to sear the meat. After searing both sides, I reduced the heat to low & brushed a small amount of the sauce mix on them & browned both sides again-watching to keep them from burning. I finished them in the oven at 400 degrees for about 25 minutes, covered. I got rave reviews from my husband and son, so this will definitely be added to our meal rotation.

Cooking times were way off. Would be better to brown in the pan then bake. I ended up with a charred mess in the pan and black pork chops. The flavor was decent, minus the char.

This recipe was ok, but I found it to be bland just as is the first time I tried it, so I added a little salt and pepper, garlic and sliced Vidalia onions and baked it, covered, on 375 for 45-50 minutes, instead of pan frying them. I found them to be much moister and the flavour was much better the second time round.

Tried a variation on this. Instead of using garlic powder, I cooked some chopped onions and garlic in some butter then used the same butter to cook the pork chops, re-adding the garlic and onions at the last minute. Came out very good!

Great honey-mustard sauce, and an easy recipe to put together. Definitely salt & pepper pork before the pan fry. I agree with some other reviewers about the char, though, as the honey will burn in the hot pan. Next time I'll quick pan-fry and finish in sauce in oven. (I used very thin chops). The honey-mustard flavor is perfect.

These are really good! My whole family enjoyed them. The only problem was that they did come out a little dry, so I would definitely reduce the cooking time (unless you use thicker chops) or maybe cover while cooking.

Awesome and relatively easy since I'm not the best cook in the world.  The only thing I hate about this is the mess of frying and cleaning up after.  But that just goes with the territory. My family loved it and I even tried with boneless chicken breasts.  Another hit! Oh and I didn't have the ingredients to MAKE honey mustard but I did have bottled honey mustard...worked great.

I loved the flavor of this, but it did turn out a little dry. The honey-mustard ratio was perfect though so I will definitely try this one again to see if it turns out a little better. Both my 5 year old and 2 year old really liked it though, so it was a winner in that regard. Thank you for sharing the recipe, AuntE!

Great recipe and suggestions. I followed the ingredients and as others suggested, added sliced onion and fresh garlic. Browned and baked at 400 with potatoes for 30 mins. Uncovered for 5 mins. Served with steamed green beans, tossed with butter and toasted almonds. The kids and hubby loved it. Usually pork is so dry and this was perfect. Thank you!!

Simple yet delish! I followed the recipe except I baked my chops in the oven on 375. My 4 year old granddaughter ate two, and hubby was in love. I think I have found his new fav pork chop. LOL

The honey just scorched in the bottom of the pan, and the way the recipe reads, you end up putting the honey/mustard on the same side.   I had to turn the heat way down to stop the burn, and then I wondered: coat a side and turn it pan-down, or let it sit atop the pork whilst the other side cooks.   In the end, nobody felt the flavor profile was good enough to even try again :(

This really needs to be an oven recipe.  The sauce burned very quickly in the pan and I ended up putting it in the oven as other reviewers have stated.  The flavor was...ok.  I love honey mustard, but there needed to be something more to it.  We ate it without complaint but it is not something I'll make again.

Fixed as written. The sauce was SO good, but as I cooked it, it burnt. Really badly. I timed it exactly as written. Maybe I should have baked it in the oven? Really disappointed, was expecting it to come out better.

This was good but lacked the mustard flavor, so next time I applied a thin layer of dijon mustard, then the garlic and pepper to sear it into the meat.  Proceeded with as written and it was so delicious!

After reading all the reviews, I made a few adjustments: For the sauce I used 1/2 cup honey, 2 tbsp stone ground mustard, 2 tbsp yellow mustard, 1 tbsp red vinegar, and 1/2 tbsp minced garlic. I sprinkled salt, pepper, and garlic powder on both sides, seared the chops for about a minute per side, then brushed both sides of pork chops with sauce before searing about 30 seconds more per side. Then I placed the pork chops in a glass baking dish, poured remaining sauce on top, and baked at 375 for 45 minutes. These are the most delicious and tender pork chops I have never made. I will definitely be making them again, and may even try substituting the pork for chicken.

I would have given this 5 stars, and due to a broken wrist won't be cooking for awhile, but I do cook pork and " cook until no pink shows, plus the 8 total min. per side is way, way, way too much.  The new way is to leave a little pink so they are juicy, there is no longer a danger to leaving pork a little medium instead of cooking it until it turns to dry rubber.  Sorry, however, the sauce sounds lovely.  I will try this but not cook mine above my digital thermometer temp of 140º.

The next time I make this I will not put the honey mustard on while it is still cooking.  Or maybe turn it down to low because it burns!  However the flavor was good and the chops were juicy and tender.

Made this for dinner tonight. Didn't have garlic so used garlic/herb Mrs. Dash. Otherwise it was really good and hubby really enjoyed it.

My boyfriend & I made this last night and it was fabulous! The ingredient ratio was perfect and always something that I'll remember. I do have to say that we didnt go by the book on the cooking times. We didnt do the "3 minute , 5 minute" thing. My boyfriend is a cook and knew how to cook the pork.. we actually let it cook a little longer than the suggested times. We talked about how awesome it will be to serve our kids this once we're older & get to that point in our relationship. We'll always remember this easy recipe. Thank you!!

I put garlic in the mix, and on the chops when I braised them. My family enjoyed this recipe. The glaze made a delicious "gravy" for the meat too.

Haven't cooked pork chops very often in the past, so I tried to follow the recommended cooking times in this recipe over medium high heat. 3 minutes to brown on each side was way too much time for my stove top! Then the butter/honey/mustard all started burning together in the pan only minutes after I added it. Oven cooking may have been better. I cooked it for maybe 1/3 the suggested cooking time and it was a bit over-cooked, with lots of charred honey mustard on the outside, the inside was ok. I'll have to decrease the temperature if I try it again. However, most of my kids still ate it, and my 1 1/2 year old loved it.

My husband said they were ok. For any pork dish that is high praise, not his favorite meat. I used minced garlic in the butter when melting it and then cooked the pork chops with the rest of the ingredients. I thought it was delicious.

I recommend a lower than medium heat so the honey doesn’t get too browned on, but they were scrumptious as described!

Really enjoyed it except I would use more mustard than it suggests. It could also use salt and pepper at the same time as the garlic powder.

This was delicious!  I had a lot of pan drippings after frying the pork chops, so I made a light gravy from it while the pork chops were baking in the oven.  I then added the rest of the honey mustard sauce to the gravy so when I took the chops out of the oven, I  brushed the gravy/sauce on them.    For a side I made red skin potatoes with Rosemary and my family used the gravy/sauce to dip the potatoes in too!   SO GOOD!

I made this recipe as directed and it was very good. I may have cooked the chops a couple of minutes too long as I thought they were a bit dry; however, my family commented on how much they liked them.

I made this this evening and found it rather tasty.  Trick with pork and a given, is to salt and pepper to taste and NEVER cook over 145 degrees internal temperature.

I used honey dijon mustard and I think next time I will use prepared mustard mixed with honey for a smoother coating.  Otherwise, it was quite good.

Excellent easy weeknight meal. I used bone-in pork chops, and I added a little salt with the garlic powder. I used Dijon mustard because that is what I had. My family loved it, and I will add it to my regular dinner rotation. Will likely use it with boneless chicken too.

I will definitely make this again! My family loved it. Be sure to turn down the heat to medium after searing both sides. You may need to cook a little longer than 5 minutes on each side after brushing with the honey mustard. So fast, so easy.

I would use a little more garlic next time.  I was a little too conservative with it for the first time.  Otherwise, they were quite delicious!

I might have finally figured out how to not overcook pork during this recipe. So, that's good. I don't know if I didn't use enough of the sauce, but the flavor was weak for me.

Very quick and easy entree.  It was a little bland.  However, the honey mustard sauce made up for blandness in sweet tasting pork chops.

The first time I used thin chops and they came out great. The second time I used thick cut and I let the sauce bubble up BIG mistake the sauce had carmelized. All my fault. Make sure you don't have that problem.  AS I SAID ALL MY FAULT. Thank you for the great recipe.

I liked the ease of this recipe. However, the taste was bland.
I think I would add some salt and pepper.  Maybe less honey too.
I will try it again with a bit of tweaking.

Pork can taste so bland but the honey and mustard in this recipe gave it just enough sweet & sour to make it very yummy.  I will make this again.

This recipe is fast and super tasty. I didn’t have any pork chops so I used country boneless  pork ribs and they were absolutely delicious. It’s an easy sauce to throw together and it cooks up fast. I will definitely make this over and over And next time I’ll use pork chops.

Probably will not make it again. Followed the recipe exactly. The process leads to dry meat and quite frankly the flavor was at best just ok.

The first time I made this the marinade burnt , as it’s got honey in it. The second time I made this I seasoned the chops well & cooked in a pan. I cooked the sauce separately over a gentle heat & poured it over the cooked chops. I added crushed garlic to the sauce.

This is my first review.  We really enjoyed this. I'm not really crazy about pork chops as they are usually dry, but these were real moist.  I did use dijon mustard as that's what I had. I will definitely be making it again.

We thought these were seasoned poorly and had little saucy flavor. The recipe is also incorrect. There is no amount of garlic powder listed in the ingredients although the recipe tells you to use half of the garlic powder on each side of the meat. Also, in #3 the words ",turn them over," should be left out. Otherwise you are putting honey mustard on one side of the chops---twice---and NONE on the other side!

Really good. I made it as directed and added salt, pepper and garlic powder before I put it in the pan. I used a non stick frying pan which is essential to keep the sauce from sticking and burning, also played with the heat up and down to keep it all from burning.  I scooped sauce back over the chops as they cooked and turned them a couple of times. The secret is to  stay with them but they don't take long to cook. My husband enjoyed them and suggested the sauce could be used with other meats as well. I agree.

I followed the recipe and it was ok. If i make it again, will tweak the recipe with a little less honey, substitute dijon for regular yellow and maybe add some red pepper flakes for a little kick. Will also use fresh garlic in the butter instead of garlic powder. Grandkids loved it, but the adults agreed it needed more flavor and less honey.

These were easy and so delicious.  I made only one change--used Dijon mustard instead of yellow. You may think there's too much sauce but as it cooks, it thickens. Served it with mushroom rice and poured some of the sauce on top.

So easy, quick & tasty. I cooked the pork chops first in the skillet to brown them with the spices (salt, pepper, garlic salt, etc) without the sauce.  Then before baking them, (@375 for 30-35 min), I put the sauce on both sides.  Maybe next time I'll make more sauce to coat.

Quick, easy, tasty. Used real garlic instead of powder. Pan-frying seemed to decrease the flavor of the honey-mustard; added more on at end. Others recommend baking it into it, and that is probably better.

I actually followed one of the reviewers advice and baked it in the oven at 375F for 50 minutes and added 3 minutes with Broil uncovered. My fiance loved it he said the porkchop was actually moist and taste was awesome!

I fixed this tonight, but can’t give it 5 stars. I thought using prescribed mustard and honey combo was too sweet. The sweet flavor is lingering in my taste buds. The chops, however, were moist and delicious.

Made this for my family last night. I really like that it was a quick and easy meal, perfect for busy weeknights. I peppered the chops and added the garlic powder while they were in the pan and let them them cook almost all the way through before adding the honey mustard sauce. When serving them, I topped them off with more sauce. Got a thumbs up from husband and daughter!

The honey mustard burned to the pork chops. Would've been better as a sauce at the end. The chops were charred on the outside and dry in the middle. Needs alot of tweaks if I make this again.

I followed the instructions, except I used a prepared commercial "Honey Mustard" I already had.  I even sprinkled onion powder in addition to the garlic powder, and a little McCormick's Steak Seasoning.  There wasn't much flavor, even though I used a generous amount of everything.  The chops were 1/2  inch thick,  but they were far from tender or flavorful. Guess I'll  just pop them into the instant pot cooker I have and pressure cook them in BBQ  sauce to tenderize/salvage them. Perhaps I messed up by not using the honey/mustard step that was in the recipe..

This was good. I would suggest putting the garlic powder on all sides before searing. Also, lower the temperature to low after adding the honey mustard so it doesn't burn.

Didn't make any changes.  The sauce was good and this was so easy.  Only issue was that it was a little dry, but that was my fault.

This was quick and easy and quite tasty,  I didn't have any garlic powder so I used Mrs. Dash garlic and herb seasoning and that worked fine.  I might try using honey mustard next time and see what that does to the flavor.

This was easy and delicious! I used pork tenderloin, sprinkled with garlic, pats of becel and the honey mustard sauce. Baked at 400 for 37 minutes. So yum! I saved some sauce and poured some on before serving.

This was a delicious combination, I ended up putting a teaspoon of curry in the sauce to give it more depth. Beautiful!

Delicious recipe and perfectly quick and uncomplicated for a weeknight dinner. I did pat dry and salt and pepper the chops before searing and also sautéed a little chopped onion in the butter for a bit of extra flavour. I had some leftover honey mustard so brushed it on steamed asparagus, which was excellent.

Tender and delicious. I sprinkled the chops with a little garlic blend before cooking and added half and half to the sauce before serving. It cut the sweetness of the honey. I will make it again but cut back a little on the honey. The sauce was very good but just too sweet.

No changes made.   Easy to make.  Sauce carmelized beautifully.   Tried this recipe for Husband as he likes pork, he gave it thumbs up.  Even I liked it a lot and I do not care for pork.

Swapped yellow mustard for Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard and use some of the local honey I bought over the summer. Made sauce, poured over boneless chops, tossed in the over and it made out pretty good for such a simple recipe.

I will defiantly make this again but next time I'm going to  brown in a pan with salt, pepper and a few chopped garlic gloves. Maybe one chopped cayenne pepper while browning to give it a little heat. Must try this again!

It was pretty good, but I tried to oven idea, and it dried out the pork chops.  I've done this, but I used mustard powder, and it really worked better in my view.

good quick and tasty! Great alternative to BBQ pork chops.
