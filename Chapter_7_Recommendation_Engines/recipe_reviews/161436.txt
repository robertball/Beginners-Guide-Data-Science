What a winner! Noticing the recipe called for no fat, I was tempted to add a 1/2 stick of butter and I'm so glad I didn't and stuck to the recipe as written, only adding 1 tsp. of vanilla to the batter. This was SO nice and moist with a perfect amount of rhubarb.  Any more, I fear, might have made this soggy rather than cakey, particularly after the first day. I was afraid of glopping on the cinnamon by shaking it over the topping, so rather than take a chance I mixed maybe 3/4 tsp. of cinnamon in with the topping ingredients. Good call I think! This is simply a great, old fashioned coffee cake - nice balance of rich, moist cake, delicately flavored with rhubarb and topped with a buttery, crackly, streusel. Grandmas always seem to know how to do it best!

Easy, simple and delicious! I didn't have sour cream on hand so I substituted plain yogurt. I used 3/4 cup of packed brown sugar instead of white sugar (personal taste preference) and also added 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts to the topping. I'll make this again. UPDATE May 8, 2011: If anyone is interested in cutting back calories - I've made this using 3/4 cup sugar in the cake and only half the topping. Still delicious with a crusty crunchy top. This may depend on how sour your rhubarb is. Also, try using a cup of red currants in place of 1 cup of rhubarb.

Very moist and flavorful cake.  I got great reviews.  However, if the topping was suppose to be a crumb topping like a crumb cake, mine did not turn out that way.  More flour would have been needed. I will be using this recipe again in the near future.  I used frozen rhubarb.

This cake is amazing! I followed several other suggestions, and used 4 cups of diced rhubarb, and 1/4 cup brown sugar in the cake and all brown sugar in the topping. I had slightly less than a cup of sour cream, so I made up the rest with some vanilla yogurt. The rhubarb taste is very subtle, even with four cups of fruit. This was yummy as a morning coffee cake; yummy with afternoon tea, and especially terrific served warm with a scoop of strawberry ice cream for dessert! Alas, the cake lasted less than a day!

This review is for all you high altitude bakers out there.  I live at 7500 feet.  Not extremely high but not sea level either, so many of these cakes don't turn out the same for me as they do for people even 2000 feet lower.

The recipe, as written, didn't work that well for me.  Although it was tasty and moist, it was dense and somewhat tough/chewy.  Not what I thought a cake should be like.  Usually I just give up at that point, eat my failure and mark a par for the high altitude course.  BUT...this recipe has received 5 stars from a LOT of people. So, I just had to try it again with high altitude adjustments.

Below are the adjustments I made, for what turned out to be a completely different cake - moist, yet light and cakey, with a crunchy/crumbly top.  I am so excited by the result I just had to share.

For the batter:
- moved the butter from the topping, down into the batter
- reduced sugar in batter to 1c.
- reduced the baking soda to 1/2 tsp
- added 1 tsp baking powder
- added 3T flour
- added an egg

I started out creaming the butter and sugar.  Added eggs and sour cream.  Slowly stirred in the dry ingredients, not stirring too much.  Then folded in the rhubarb.

The topping:
2/3c brown sugar
3/4 tsp cinnamon

Temp/time:
- temp up to 375 deg
- 30 min until golden brown

It wouldn't be fair to give the recipe less stars b/c of my altitude.  I gave it, 5 stars because my end result is what I think the author intended - and it's darn tasty!

Wow...Wow! YUMMY is all I can say about this cake...I actually just got this recipe from a friend and came on here to see if anything like this was already posted - this is the exact same recipe and it is amazing! Not too overwhelming with rhubarb but something different than pie or jam. Definately a keeper - you MUST try this!

I was initially drawn to this recipe because of the minimal fat. I adapted the recipe a bit to try and make it a little healthier: I used 1/2 the amount of sugar (by using Splenda brown sugar) and used whole wheat flour in both the cake and topping. I added 2 tbsp of egg white as I found the cake batter a little dry. And I also used 2 tbsp of apple sauce instead of the oil for the topping. It was REALLY more like a paste, so I had to put it on top by spreading it out by hand. I also baked them in muffin trays as they're a little more portable, but my rhubarb chunks were a little large, so they tended to collapse a bit. I also added the cinnemon as well as ground cloves and allspice into the topping. But VERY moist and delicious cake! Will DEFINATELY make again and look forward to adapting even more!

I didn't have sour cream, so I used plain milk with 1 T vinegar....it turned out GREAT!  You need to leave the milk and vinegar out for about 1/2 hour, so it curdles the milk a bit.  Other than that, I made just like the recipe.  It is SOOO DELICIOUS!  THANK YOU!!!

My husband doesn't like pies, so this caught my eye.  We liked this cake.  It's sweet, but the rhubarb offsets it well.  This receipe is going in my book, thanks!  I will also try this in the fall using diced apples in place of the rhubarb and some brown sugar.  Yummy!

Delicious rhubarb cake.  I followed the instructions exactly and was very pleased with the outcome.  This would be good as a dessert cake, but also as a morning coffee cake.

I've made this recipe exactly as it's written multiple times. Every time, it's a HUGE hit. Everyone's always surprised to learn there's no butter or oil in the batter, because the cake is incredibly moist. The rhubarb bakes down into the cake, making it nice and tart, and the crumb topping cuts the tartness just enough. This is a great dessert, especially when paired with vanilla ice cream or frozen yogurt, but when we bring a pan of this to the lake, everyone wants a slice for breakfast, too!

I made this cake for my sister's birthday and everyone loved it!!! It was easy to make and turned out really moist and flavourful. The crumbly topping was perfectly crunchy- the combination of soft cake and crunchy top was marvelous.

Very simple and very good!  This recipe will definitely help use up the few bags of frozen rhubarb that must go to make room for the spring crop.  If the cake is this good with frozen rhubarb, I imagine it will be wonderful with fresh picked.
I also used plain yogurt (whole milk) in combination with a few tablespoonfuls of sour cream.  Added ~1/8 teaspoon  of freshly grated nutmeg to the batter.
Moist and delicious!  Thank you, Oma!

I don't know much about rhubarb, but we grew it in our garden this year, so I had to find a use. This recipe was an excellent one!! It was gone from our house in two days. Very moist and not too strong on the rhubarb flavor. So good, in fact, that my husband said I couldn't make this too often or we'd gain too much weight! :)

This was incredible.  My kids loved it and they normally hate cake.  I also added a scant 4 cups of rhubarb and don't even think that 3 would suffice.   I used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream since I didn't have the latter.  That added some healthy protein and works really well as a substitute.   Very moist.   I may even cut some sugar out next time.   I'm pretty sure that the recipe is fine on its own, but extra rhubarb is highly recommended.

Seriously fabulous!  Added cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla.  Even cold it is addicting!

Made it for a 4th time subbing 0% greek yogurt and making into "cupcakes" baked for 18 min.  Delish!

This good, simple cake is best eaten the day it's made. I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the cake, but otherwise made as written. Changes I'll try next time: up the rhubarb to 4 cups, add a bit of cinnamon to batter, cut the topping in half (using brown sugar), and adding chopped walnuts to topping. Worth another try!

FAVORITE RECIPE...

Made it an easy ONE BOWL RECIPE by whisking together eggs, sour cream (or yogurt or greek yogurt)and sugar and adding a tsp of almond extract, then adding flour with salt and soda mixed into it a bit and mixing that in with a wooden spoon, then dumping the rhubarb in (I use more than it calls for!) and stirring, then pouring into greased pan and baking, subbing the streusel topping (though that is good too!) for a powdered sugar glaze when it comes out of the oven. THAT is fast :)

Very nice but the topping is too much and too sweet.  My son said it was like eating sugar cubes!  Next time, I will cut it back for sure.

Fantastic!  I didn't have quite three cups of rhubarb, so I added on large apple cut up.  I also used 3/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 white sugar in the topping, also added in ten or so grahm crackers and sprinkled with cinnimon sugar which was all I had.  The topping was crunchy, inside was moist.  Made it for my moms birthday tea and cake to have with her Aunt.  We all loved it!  First time I ever impressed my mom with my baking skills!  Thanks Oma!

This is very good! I substitued 1 cup of plain greek yogurt for the sour cream due to intolerance. Moist with a cake texture! I just couldn't quit eating it. The first piece I ate right out of the oven, the second piece, I topped with vanilla yogurt, the 3rd piece I ate was warmend with a pat of butter on top. Easy to prepare too!

My husband & I scarfed this whole cake in a day.  Unbelievably delicious and moist!  I didn't change a thing, except I used 4 cups of rhubarb.  I have at least that much left, so guess what I am making again today? :)

I started making this and realized I didn't have any sour cream so I used 3/4 cup buttermilk and it was still great! I will make this again using the correct ingredients, but I can imagine it will only taste better. :)

This recipe was just what I was looking for. I followed the recipe just the way it was written too. Which is odd for me normally I like to add my own twists. But no chnages needed here. I shared this cake with a large group and everyone loved it!

I made a half of recipe using whole grain spelt flour and 1/2 cup dark brown sugar in the cake.  I made the topping as written.   It was delicious though I thought the topping was a bit too sweet for my taste but after placing a piece in a bowl and smothering it with plain yogurt the sweetness was just right.  In an 8x8 metal pan I baked it just 35 minutes.   The batter was quite thick spreadable though.  Highly recommended with just about any fruit you might choose.

Good base recipe but I think it needs some modifications. I made the recipe as written except that I reduced the sugar in the batter to 1 cup and in the topping to 3/4 cup and I still found it too sweet. The cake came out super moist, which was awesome and it think it would be great with other fruit too. However I like at least a little bit of tart in my rhubarb desserts and this was just downright sweet. Maybe it just depends on the rhubarb you use. I will play with this recipe some more to perfect it to my taste buds.

Fantastic! My only complaint, and it's minor and easily remedied, is that it's a little too sweet. I used only 1 cup sugar in the cake and scant cup in the topping and will cut both back to 3/4 cup next time. I love the texture and the amount of rhubarb, though, and will keep this recipe!

Fantastic, I didn't have any sour cream so I used 8 oz of strawberry yogurt and it was delicious.  I also used brown sugar for the crumb topping and it turned out great!

Very moist and a great recipe for rhubarb.  I made a half batch and served it warm with vanilla ice cream.  Loved the crunchy topping.  Thanks Alea for sharing your Oma's recipe.

Made this recipe to use some fresh rhubarb from the garden.  Baked in a mini-loaf pan with eight mini-loaves, the batter nearly filled each mini-loaf and then baked up with a nice muffin-esque top.

All I had on hand was low fat 5% sour cream, which seems to have worked well with this recipe.

Excellent cake, and extremely easy to make.  I cut the sugar by 1/4 cup, and will likely cut more next time I make it.  I also probably used 4 C rhubarb.  For reference, made this way and cut 6 x 3 (18 pieces) in a 9 x 13 pan, it's 180 calories a piece.  Delicious!

ABsolutely fantastic!! Made this for a large crowd and everyone raved about it! The only changes I made were to use 4 cups of rhubarb, and for the topping I used brown sugar, mixed the cinnamon right in, and added a some rolled oats. This was great both warm and cold, even a couple days later.

I was craving rhubarb, and this recipe came with great reviews, so I gave it a shot. Simple to prepare, and very moist, but too sweet for my taste. One of the reviewers made it with half the sugar, so I may try that the next time.

After writing the paragraph above, I asked my husband what he thought of it. He loved it, and my 5yo son said he would give it 10 stars, if he could. I'm raising it to a four star, and eating it with coffee.

This recipe is SO GOOD...I just had to cover the dish because my husband and I keep snitching cuts out of the pan.  I made it according to the recipe, but as someone recommended, I used brown sugar for the topping.  I wanted to reduce calories and did not have fat free sour cream or fat free plain yogurt, so I used 80% fat free vanilla yogurt. I also forgot to put the cinnamon on top.  I am a gardener, but I am not a baker.  This was one of the easiest, best baked goods I ever made!

I was one of five people asked to make a Rhubarb cake for my nephew's grad party, I was the last cake to arrive, but the first to be gone! This recipe was GREAT!  I did add the extra cup of rhubarb as others suggested, and 1 cup of brown sugar and did 1/2 cup brown sugar with 3/4 cup of white sugar.  I will be making this again and again!!

Excellent cake.  We received rhubarb from our csa this week and I wanted to try a new recipe.  I made it exactly as stated.  The only bad thing I can say is that it's not healthy, loaded with sugar but it sure tastes good.

This was terrific, and very easy to make.  I made according to directions and liked it, but next time would definitely make a couple of modifications.  Would add 1 t of vanilla to batter, and I think I would use brown sugar instead of white sugar for the topping (the topping was a little too sugary/gritty for me).  Probably could use 1/2 c brown sugar and I also would just add 1 t of cinnamon in with the topping rather than trying to sprinkle over the top.  And you could easily drop another cup of rhubarb in there if you have more.  I served it out of the oven with vanilla ice cream, but actually think it tasted better cold the next day.  This is a great dessert, or coffee cake.

I've made this at least once a month since I found it. it's wonderful. I've substituted rhubarb for cherries fresh pitted as well as frozen and blueberries. I often omit the topping and it's still delicious and a big hit with my family. I've tripled the recipe many times and it freezes really well.

I made this for my husband's birthday. This cake was very moist and delicious. We kept it in the refrigerator for a refreshing treat. The recipe is great the way it is and great altered as well. Try 2 cups of rhubarb and 1 cup of strawberries and cut back on the sugar.

Terrific.  We love rhubarb pie (using the Fresh Rhubarb Pie recipe from this site) and can't wait for the season.  This year we have a bumper crop of rhubarb and after making several pies, I was looking for a change of pace.  This recipe was definitely it.  I used the recipe as-is except I used greek yogurt, half brown sugar, and extra cinnamon to suit our personal tastes.  I'll definitely make again with and without those changes and in the fall when apples are in season.  My college age son is home for the 4th of July weekend so I made this for breakfast.  He devoured almost half of it (he's the typical eating machine).  We enjoyed it so much that later after our cookout we ignored our other dessert and polished this off with a side of ice cream.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!  After one use, it is already one of my family's keepers.

This recipe was super yummy! I only had light sour cream and it came out wonderfully. I also added chopped pecans to the streusel topping and mixed in my cinnamon instead of sprinkling it on after-the-fact. Mine baked for 55 minutes though I used a glass pan that was closer to an 8x12.  Serve it while it is hot. It is fabulous that way!  Oh and don't be concerned if the batter seems very sick. It worried me at first but it all came out just fine.

This is soooo good.  I used previously frozen rhubarb so it had probably compressed to the equivalent of 4 cups fresh, and I also added a few strawberries.  I used full-fat live culture sour cream.

Amazing recipe!  I was short on sour cream, so I added half Greek yogurt and it turned out just fine.  I will definitely make this one again.

I used frozen rhubarb.  The bottom of the cake was too wet.  It didn't become soggy even after a week.  I just didn't like the texture.  I may try it in the summer with fresh rhubarb.

Delicious!  Made a few suggested changes from other commenters -- I added an additional cup of rhubarb (as I had it already chopped), used half brown sugar in the topping and mixed in the spices to the strusel mixture.  I also doubled the strusel mixture for the top as the folks I was making it for LOVE strusel!  I think that weighed the cake down too much, but it got rave reviews from my guests.  Cake itself was moist and just tart/rhubarb-ey enough.

Delicious and easy to make substitutions. I used yogurt instead of sour cream and brown sugar instead of white in the topping. A moist and flavourful cake - good for breakfast.

Excellent!  You can actually taste the rhubarb.  I did add 1 tsp of vanilla and I put the cinnamon right in the topping instead of sprinkling it on after.

Delicious!! My husband and I loved it. Even though I used less sugar than required the cake was still wonderful. 
I am trying to cut our sugar intake so I used 1 cup sugar for the cake and 1/3 for the streusel.  I think one can swap the rhubarb for tart apples or tart cherries and the result will also be great. I must try. 
Thank you very much for the recipe!

This cake is really, REALLY good.  And about as easy as it gets.  Other than adding a little cinnamon to the batter, I made it exactly as directed. It's more like a coffee cake.  Great for a brunch.  A good reason to plant some rhubarb in the yard.

My rhubarb plant produced over twenty stalks(not bad for its first year) and I needed a recipe to use them all up so when I saw the high reviews and since I gad all the ingredients available at home I decided to give this recipe a try. Unfortunately, my cake did not get high reviews at home. First of all, the crumb topping was like plaster thus leaving my cake half raw.  Also, the cake was tasteless perhaps substituting brown sugar and some other spices would have been more palatable. I added the rest of the rhubarb to my apple pie now that was delicious! It was an interesting experience for me because I had never baked with rhubarb before.

This is a very basic, moist cake that is good, but not too exciting.  There are other rhubarb recipes that use vanilla, at least part brown sugar, etc. that we would choose over this recipe. Quick to prepare if you are in a hurry.

Great tasting cake. Only gave it four stars because the rhubarb flavor is really weak, even though I added four cups like the other reviews said. I make a rhubarb sauce (4 cups rhubarb, 2 tbsp butter and 1/2 cup brown sugar) and topped the cake with that. Really brought out the rhubarb flavor. Next time I will make the sauce w/o sugar and add it directly to the cake batter, hopefully adding more flavor.

Very Good had some right when I took it out of the oven.  I had to cook it a little bit longer (10 min's) ovens are different you know.  My husband will love it.  Very easy to make and top was nice and crispy.  The lady who said her topping was not crispy must have put too much butter in it.  Sooooo Goooood TY for sharing recipe.

WOW! I am very impressed with this recipe. It was absolutly fabulous--moist, sweet, chewey, with a crunchy topping. Just awesome! Will make with half brown sugar next time (and all brown sugar in the topping) and put a little cinnamon in the batter as well. Thanks so much for this great recipe, I will make again and again!

A nice moist cake.  I found the crumb topping to be just the right amount.  I used fat free sour cream and splenda instead of sugar.

I've given this recipe away on request numerous times!! It can be made with whole wheat flour if being eaten shortly after coming out of the oven. I've also made it into cupcakes with paper liners and froze them just before baking just to have them on hand and stored them in a large Ziploc bag in the freezer. Bake them from frozen at 400 for about five minutes longer than a thawed muffin. So delicious!!

The recipe was a bit confusing when it came to the sugar part.  It calls for 1 1/4 c in the ingredients section, but under instructions it says add 1 1/4 c sugar to the cake and then says add remaining 1 c to crumble too.  Was it supposed to say add 1/4 sugar to the cake???  Also it took 1.5 hr to cook at 350.  Too much sugar in my family’s opinion, probably would have used 1/2 c in the cake and 1/4 for topping would be a better ratio.

Rave review's from church family! I added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla with rhubarb and used 3/4 cup brown sugar (instead of white sugar) and added 3/4 teaspoon cinnamon in the topping instead of dusting on top.

This cake is excellent.  I made a very few changes.  I addded 1 tsp. Vanilla and cinnamon to the cake.  For the topping I used 1 cup brown sugar instead of white sugar , added  1/2 tsp. Cinnamon and 1/2 cup nuts plus the original flour and butter.  Everyone wanted the recipe and will definitely make it again.

Used partly brown sugar (1/4 cup) with the white flour.  Also used only brown sugar in the topping and added the cinnamon to the topping before sprinkling over batter.  Used 3 cups rhubarb but could have used 4 cups which some people did.  Especially if you want less cakey, 4 cups!!  Will make again, so easy!!!!

Made it as printed. Turned out most and very flavorful. Yup was crunchy. Even better the second day.  Pretty high in carbs and calories so we cut half size pieces. Will make again.

What an amazing recipe! The topping didn't come out crumby like what I know streusel should be but came out like a toffee topping which burrowed down into the  cakes leaving little caverns of goodness.  The cake was not overtly sweet which allowed the rhubarb to add it's sweety tartness to the cake. I used turbinado sugar instead of white and vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream. This was a hit with my family and I will make it again!

Home made flavor, gourmet creation.  Super EASY! Reduced fat with yogurt.  Used 8x8 pan, deep and moist.   Can substitute half brown sugar.  Added sugar & Streudel to topping.

For the topping, I did half brown sugar and half white sugar, and also replaced the flour with oatmeal. I needed more oatmeal than 1/4 c.... Maybe closer to 3/4 c. It gave it great texture! This cake was AMAZING, very flavorful, and very moist! It will be one of new "go to" recipes!

Agreed with the positive ratings! However, I reduced the sugar in the batter to 3/4 cup (using brown sugar), and reduced the sugar in the crumble to 3/4 cup (I think can be further reduced to 1/2 cup as it was still very crunchy rather than crumbly). Also works with apple replacing the rhubarb.

Excellent recipe - so easy.  Made it exactly as written and it turned out perfectly.  I was surprised that there was no liquid (milk, water), but it didn't need it. Moist spongy cake with a great crumble!  Definite keeper!

Excellent. I love rhubarb and I love this cake. I have never added any spice to my rhubarb concoctions because I never wanted to mess with the true flavour of rhubarb, but the cinnamon really works. Yum!

Good cake - my family liked it best - warm - from the oven.  The cake became moister the next day - and that was not necessarily a good thing.  We liked the cake the first day the best.  I will make again, the flavor was very good.

A fantastic cake! I followed other reviews and added more rhubarb. It was great warm for dessert with ice cream, but would be great as a cake for a coffee hour or brunch.

Made this with rhubarb from my garden - absolutely delicious! I only used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar and replaced the sour cream with plain greek yogurt. Wonderful! Even was asked for the recipe!

This is a wonderful moist cake with a nice cinnamon flavor. Perfect when you have a lot of rhubarb but don't necessarily want to mix it with other fruit. The tart rhubarb stands very well on its own.

WAY WAY WAY too much sugar crumble on top and not enough flavour in the bread/cake.  I liked how moist it was and that there was a good amount of rhubarb in proportion to the other ingredients, but yeah, way too much sugar and butter on top

Excellent as is. I followed this recipe exactly. The cake is moist and light at the same time. Delicious warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, but absolutely Superb when fully cooled and eaten as coffee cake. The first pan got eaten so fast I promptly made another. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Wonderful cake for no fat in the batter! The rhubarb cooks up to provide the needed moisture. The cake is moist with a nice tart-sweet balance between the cake and topping.  I used 3/4 c. brown sugar and a half teaspoon of cinnamon in the batter and a half cup of brown sugar for the topping. Great way to use fresh rhubarb.

Our family loved this cake!  I was looking for a recipe similar to the rhubarb cake that my Mom-in-law was famous for and came across this version, with sour cream in the recipe and a shortbread-type crust rather than the brown sugar type.  I think this is even better!! I made it the first time with a cup of sour cream, and my daughter made it the second time with half sour cream and half milk.  I think the secomd cake was a nicer texture. All in all a lovely, fresh tasting cake!!

I added 4 cups freshly picked rhubarb and it didn't get soggy.  I did not have sour cream, so I used 1T of lemon juice with about 3/4 cups of whipping cream.  The batter is very thick - don't worry.  I have added pecans to the streusel with good results... extra crunchy goodness.

Good, but my husband liked the crust on the sour cream-rhubarb squares better.

Excellent recipe. Great reviews. I used half brown sugar and white sugar in both the cake and topping. I also used 4 cups of rhubarb. Thanks for sharing!

I made this as our dessert for my family's Father's Day barbeque and it was a hit not only with the adults but the children loved it too!  One of those kinds of desserts that you keep cutting just one more little piece off as you pass by it.

Rating: 5 stars.  After all the questionable reviews, I was skeptical to try this recipe. However, I did and sure don't know what others problems are but my cake came out just perfect!! I followed the recipe with no changes and it was awesome, so don't hesitate, just ENJOY!!  Your friends and family will be glad you did!

Loved it. Used whole wheat flour & yogurt as replacements as well as thawed rhubarb and it turned out great. Was not sure about the consistancy before adding the thawed rhubarb but was very pleased. I put a good bit of cinnamon over the entire pan and the flavor was great. Adding berries would have been even better!

This is one of the few highly rated recipes on this site that I haven't liked.  I made it exactly as the recipe said but maybe I did something wrong.  It took forever to get the middle cooked and when it finally was done it had more of a bread texture than cake.  Also, it was lacking in flavor.  I expect a rhubarb cake to be tangy and this one was very bland.  The topping was like eating a bowl of sugar.  I really wanted to like this and am sad that I used up the bag of rhubarb my neighbor gave me on this recipe.

Delicious - a hit with the whole family.  I didn't have sour cream on hand, so I used regular whipping cream and a squeeze of lemon juice instead.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla, as another reviewer suggested.  Light and moist cake, crunchy topping - perfect!

Not what I expected at all.  I followed the recipe, using pre-measured frozen rhubarb, which I thawed and drained (not squeezed out), so I don't know if that made a difference to the texture in the end.  We found the texture to be more like a bread than a cake.  It also could have used more rhubarb flavor in my opinion.  I think adding 1/2 cup butter to the recipe would have made it that cake texture we were hoping for.  Either way, I won't be making it again.  I have enjoyed other rhubarb cakes from this site much, much more.

Definate 5 stars here.  I grew up eating rhubarb in many forms but have long since lost my rhubarb coffee cake recipe.  This one far outshines any rhubarb cake I have eaten!

I made it as is and was happy with the taste, and the cake was gobbled up. I now use 2/3 cup sour cream & 1/3 cup apple sauce, to reduce fat. I've also made the cake with rhubarb & strawberries, with apple, and with blueberries. Four cups of fruit seems to be perfect when using fresh fruit. Very tummy and easy enough for my 10 yr. old granddaughter to make.

Delicious and moist!  I will definitely make this recipe again.  I also added more flour to the "crumble" so that it would do just that.  Next time I will try using vanilla yogurt in place of sour cream....to add just a touch more sweetness.  Thanks for sharing!

This is the best rhubarb cake I have ever had. Everyone loves it and I make it very often. Last time I tried making it with splenda and it wasn't as sweet, but it was still very good. It did not turn out as thick as making it with sugar.

Easy and delicious. I have made it twice now, and both were great. I used 4 cups of fresh rhubarb in both, because I have a ton of it in my yard. The first time I used 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 vanilla yogurt because I didn't have enough sour cream. I reduced the sugar a little to compensate for the yogurt. It was soooo yummy and moist. The second time I used all sour cream as the recipe calls, and I think I like the half yogurt just as well if not better. Other refinements include adding walnuts and a little extra flour to the topping and mixing the cinnamon in rather than sprinkling on top.   I will definitely this again. My boyfriend and some house guests all loved it.  A great use of rhubarb when no other fruits are available.

This was truly delicious.  I only had 2c of rhubarb so I scaled the recipe to 2/3 and used a 9.5 inch round glass pie plate, and it was a perfect size.  Other than that, I followed the directions exactly, baked it for the time suggested, etc.  I think it actually would have been even better if I scaled it to 1/2 (so have 4c rhubarb in the original recipe instead of 3).  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent! There was some free rhubarb in my church kitchen today, and this was my first experience cooking with rhubarb. The cake is deliciously moist, tangy, and tender.

Will definitely make this again.  Very moist and tasty.  Used 1 tsp. of cinnamon in the topping but would add more next time.  Had compliments about the crunchy topping but I found it a bit sweet.  I'll tinker with that the next time I make it.  Still it's a five star recipe for sure.

A good cake.  Not as flavorful as I expected, thus 4 stars, but my hubby gives it 5.  He loved it!  The sour cream really keeps it moist. I may try to spice it up a bit more next time.

This was really good! The topping was amaaaazzzing! I cooked it for the full 45 minutes but I really don't think that was enough because mine came out more bread pudding-ish than it did cake-ish. Still good though, and that's why I left it. I most likely will make this again, it's a great way to use up the overabundance of rhubarb that we have!

This was wonderful! Such a great recipe for rhubarb--I halved the recipe and baked in a 9" cake pan and it turned out fabulous. I upped the amount of rhubarb just because... what a hit at work! So moist and the great flavor of rhubarb is nicely complimented with the sugary crumbles on top. Yumm....

Delicious! Very moist. This was a big hit at my book group last night.  I only did one thing differently.  I added the cinnamon to the crumb topping mix instead of sprinkling it on top, about 3/4 teaspoon. I made the crumbs in the food processor.

Definitely enjoyed this. Made half the recipe in an 8x8 pan and used two cups of rhubarb.  Made the topping with brown sugar, minus a tablespoon which I filled with oats instead. Smaller size took 40 minutes in the oven.

I did add the 3c  of rhubarb because I really wanted a robust flavour. While it turned out really amazing, I think I’ll add 4c next time.
Will I make it again??? Probably tomorrow! Everyone loved it! 
It was the best rhubarb cake ever!!! 
I’m putting my location for altitude adjustments
I’m in Alberta, Canada. Ehhh...

Love this recipe, its easy to mix it up & personalize it. It is always a good choice if you have rhubarb. I used 4C rhubarb, decreased sugar to 1 cup & used .5 white sugar & .5c brown. Topped it with oatmeal, that added a touch of texture to the moist cake. Would be yummy with other fruits too!  So easy to make it your way.

Amazing recipe. It doesn't look like it will turn out when you put it in the pan as the batter is soooo thick but Wow! It turned out perfect. I added 4 cups of Rhurbarb for some extra tartness and left out the cinnamon just because of personal preference. Also used brown sugar for the topping. We will enjoy this many times again. Thank you.

The cake batter was seriously dry and looked nothing like in the video so I added vanilla and about a half cup more of sour cream to get it to a consistency that approached something you could work with. Otherwise followed recipe and it turned out beautifully. When I make again though I will use Splenda brown sugar mixture to save some calories but if you are thin just follow the directions as given!

I made this with 4 cups frozen rhubarb - it’s getting a little wetter as the days go on, but luckily the cake is not lasting long! If I made it with frozen rhubarb again, I’d cut some of the sugar from the topping as I find it a bit too sweet. I imagine it helps to balance the tartness of fresh rhubarb, though. I’ll probably try some oats in the topping next time, too! Yum. Also, it does not look like enough batter for a 9x13” cake pan, but it rises a lot.

We enjoyed this coffee cake very much.  Adding chopped pecans to the topping was a good suggestion. I cut back the sugar a bit as I always do and it was still delicious! The only issue I had was that it was so moist, the remaining cake became soggy after two days. I doubt that it was the recipe that caused this however, but the extra cup of rhubarb I threw in. I will make this again, and add cinnamon to the batter but stick with the proper amount of fresh rhubarb.  Thanks for making my first rhubarb cake a good one!

This was delicious and so moist.  I cut back a little on the sugar both in the cake and in the topping and it was still plenty sweet. I also used Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream and it was fine.

Fantastic. I didn't change a thing.  It was easy to make with few ingredients. This recipe is exactly what I was looking for in a rhubarb cake.  The cake has a moist muffin like goodness and the crunchy top is like an added kiss.

I made this exactly as written.  Fantastic!  I love everything rhubarb and have a lot of great recipes.  This will be added to the go-to pile!  Only complaint is that I made it for a meeting tomorrow night and may have do make another as this one seems to be disappearing.  Perfect rhubarb recipe. Thanks Oma!

OMG  Sweet and tangy.
Made this for mother's day for me ! My husband could not stop raving about it. No leftovers with this recipe. Only thing that I did that wasn't mentioned in the recipe is that I beat my eggs and sour cream together before adding to the dry ingredients.

Minor changes. Substituted a 1/4 cup of brown sugar for white and also used some in crumbles. Added 3/4 tsp almond extract to batter.  I’ve already eaten 3 pieces myself.

I followed recipe exactly. IF I make it again will add 2 more cups of rhubarb. Did not like topping and it didn't look like the photo. IF I make this again will figure something something else for topping.

Family loved it!  It’s a keeper! All I had on hand was 4 cups frozen rhubarb from last season, so I thawed it, drained it and threw it in the batter. I also added 1 tsp cinnamon to batter and topping,  just a personal preference.

Very Good!  I have made it a few times and it is always a hit.  I made it per recipe except I cut cold butter into the topping to crumb consistency instead of mixing in melted butter.  I also add a little cinnamon to the sugar and flour of the topping.

This is a really good cake recipe.  I did not have sour cream so used 1 cup of buttermilk instead and added a teaspoon of vanilla to cake batter also 4 cups of rhubarb instead of 3.  Plan to use Italian plums next time and will reduce sugar to 1 cup.

This cake was absolutely delicious. I read all the reviews and did use more rhubarb, 4 cups instead of 3. Followed the recipe otherwise. It was moist, tender and well received by my guests. I used frozen rhubarb from my garden. Just thawed enough to separate each piece. Will most assuredly bake this again. Thanks for the recipe. Of the many, many rhubarb recipes I have made in the last 50 years, this is the best! I also feel that the sugar content was spot on.

This is a keeper!  I took one of the other reviewer’s advice and mixed half the white sugar for brown in the cake batter, and used brown sugar entirely for the crumble mix.  Turned out delicious and my husband and son raved about how good it was.  The cake is disappearing fast!

It's been a while since I made any rhubarb cakes, but this one just seemed to have too much sugar to balance the fruit!  And I threw in an extra 1/2 cup rhubarb to finish it off!  It was easy to assemble, and I used gluten free flour, but still it seemed way too sugary.

This cake was a huge hit with my coworkers and family. The first time I made it I accidentally used twice as much butter for the topping, so I just added more of the other ingredients (mixed the cinnamon in instead of sprinkling on top) and made a double topping. Everyone actually liked the extra topping better.   Excellent recipe that I will be making again (and again!)

This is an excellent rhubarb cake. I used 4 cups of rhubarb. I replaced a quarter cup of white sugar with a quarter cup of brown sugar in the batter. On the streusel i used brown sugar.

The guests LOVED the cake.  Delicious crunchy top!  I made it according to directions- but added extra rhubarb- about 3/4 cup.  I will make this again soon!  Thank you for a great and easy recipe!

Made it for church coffee hour--it vanished. Added some hazelnuts to the topping for crunch. Super easy to make, and a great alternative use for rhubarb.

This cake is delicious !  I added 4 cups of fresh rhubarb instead of 3 (just because I cut too much) and subbed half brown sugar/half white sugar for the topping.  This recipe is a keeper !!

I cut the sugar to a little less than a cup for the cake itself and used about 3/4 cup brown instead of white sugar for the topping.  Everyone loved it!  Will definitely make again.

Wow!  This turned out so well - super easy to throw together, it filled the house with a divine aroma....cutting into the cake revealed a delectable treat - moist and flavorful with a wonderful texture enhanced by the crunchy topping.  I’m always looking for good rhubarb recipes and this one is superb.  I’ll be making it again soon!  Thank you Oma!

Fantastic! Love the crunchy topping! Sweet and tart at the same time. I also mixed the cinnamon into the batter. I used generous sized chunks of rhubarb.

I added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter, could add more. My rhubarb turned out to be five cups because that's how much I ended up with once I got it chopped.  The cake could actually use six cups, which is what my family recommends the next time I make it.  I used a cream cheese frosting and topped it with a cup of chopped toasted pecans.  The nut "crunch" added great texture.  This is a lovely moist cake.

Absolutely delicious.  For those who say the recipe doesn't have fat, the sour cream is the fat.  Plus the 1/4 c butter for the topping.  I rate it five stars for ease of preparation, taste and a way to use some of that rhubarb we have this time of year.  Yes, it's rich; just cut back the rest of the day.

it was good, nice and moist and full of flavour.  The only thing I would change is the topping.  I think it needs more cinnamon and a nice crumble topping would certainly enhance the flavours.  On the whole my family loved it and wants more!

I used kefir (yogurt) instead of sour cream, added a dash of vanilla, and brown sugar on top instead of white.  I also used some diced apple because I did not have enough rhubarb. Turned out awesome the whole office loved it! Its very moist definitely no butter needed!

Nice crispy sugar topping and a moist, sweet/tart cake.  Easy and quick to put together.  Ran out of sour cream, so used vanilla yogurt instead.  Will make this again!

It was very good. I made three changes...I used Robinhood gluten-free flour because I am celiac, and greek yoghurt instead of sour cream.  I also used oatmeal that I whizzed through the blender instead of the flour in the topping.  Worked great!

This is a fantastic cake, very moist!  I did substitute Greek yogurt for the sour cream because I always do, and in my opinion isn’t really a change.  One friend said she was deleting her recipe and will now use this one!

Sometimes simple is best, and this recipe is Exhibit A. Good with ice cream. Even better with ice cream and fresh local strawberries. I froze half of it; it was very wet when thawed, but 10 minutes in a 280 degree oven restored the crumb and the crispness of the topping.

Reducing the sugar in the batter and topping to about 3/4 cup and 4-5 tbsp, respectively, makes for a stunningly snackable cake. If you like airy, 2 1/2 eggs doesn't hurt! I have my taste adjustments, but making this as-is would certainly delight my palate.

Great cake even my son who hates rhubarb was eating it. The only change I did was brown sugar instead of white sugar in the topping.

I used frozen rhubarb and a little more butter for the topping. Cake was done in 45 mins. but the top was not brown enough for me so I put it under the broiler for a min or two watching it closely. Very moist and a couple of seasoned cooks (elderly women)  loved the testers I gave them.

Great Cake - However, for all you people out there who apparently think there is no fat in this recipe, have you never read the fat content of sour cream?

Excellent, excellent!  Have made it several times.  Didn't have sour cream the last time I made it and substituted greek yogurt - could not tell a difference! I up the rhubarb to a solid 4 cups,  and stir in the cinnamon with the flour at the end.  It is a favorite at the office - and now I'm running out of rhubarb in the garden AND the freezer!  Love this recipe!  thx  :)

This made an excellent cake and a great use of the rhubarb in your garden.  It was tasty and moist, and the topping gave the cake a nice crunch.  I mixed a little of the cinnamon with the sugar before adding the butter for the topping so it would be evenly dispersed across the top of the cake.

Very good recipe. I cut the sugar in the  cake in half from 1 cup to 1/2 cup - poor choice. Next time I will stick to the recipe as written. Very moist and yet "cakey" in texture. I have made soupy rhubarb cakes in the past. This one is great.

We loved this cake.  It was not too sweet and still had a tange to it.  I will diffidently make it again!  I followed the receipe as written.  I found using the white sugar  crumble on top of the cake was difficult to knife through, so I might try with brown sugar next time.

Very Good.  The only thing I would change would be to add more Rhubarb.  Make it 4 cups not 3 cups.  Add some Orange Zest for a little kick.  Just me I love Rhubarb.

Excellent cake. I found the batter to dry so I added an extra egg and some water and 1 tsp of vanilla. Also used brown sugar for the topping and added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the topping ingredients.  Definitely make again with these changes.

Delicious! Just the right amount of moist.  I used 3 cups frozen rhubarb, drained of all juice and added about 1 1/2 cups fresh strawberries, cut in small chunks . I loved it and so did everyone else at the dinner party.

I did change a bit. I diced the rhubarb first and poured two heaping tablespoons of sugar  on it and only used 1 cup of sugar in the dough.  Then after finishing the dough and topping I poured the liquid from the sugared rhubarb away and carefully lifted it under the dough. I sprinkled grinded almonds on the dough before putting the topping on it.
Everyone loved the cake! Thank you for sharing! :)

I loved the texture of the cake, and the rhubarb flavor came thru well (I added an extra cup of rhubarb based on other reviews). However, I felt it needed a little more flavor. I will make it again, but will add some cinnamon and vanilla to the batter.

We enjoyed this cake A LOT (2 adults and 2 kids). For personal preference I cut the sugar in half (cake and topping) and used brown sugar. I also adden extra Rhubarb and some cinnamon,  nutmeg and vanille extract to the fruit. As we say in german AUSGEZEICHNET ;-)

Love this cake. Very moist and full of flavour. The only changes I made was use 4 cups rhubarb and brown sugar in the topping. Will definitely make this again.

I give it 5 stars because I made it my way! I try to cook somewhat healthy even when baking goodies. I was looking for a blueberry coffee cake recipe but I liked the batter recipe, sort of, for this one. I used 1/2 c whole wheat flour with the white flour. I added a tsp each of cinnamon and vanilla. For the sugar I used 3/4 c white sugar and a heaping tablespoon of brown sugar. For the batter I added a big spoonful of unsweetened applesauce with the low fat sour cream. Instead of rhubarb I used a cup of blueberries and 1/2 cup of strawberries. For the topping I used 1/2 c softened butter, some granola, Brown sugar, white sugar, chopped walnuts and cinnamon. The best coffee cake I’ve ever made. Mmmmm

I used frozen (thawed) rhubarb, and was worried that it would be soggy, but it was great.  I will difinitely make it again!

OMG, I’m still smiling after trying this cake.  The only two changes I made was... 
1) I used 4 cups of rhubarb rather than 3.
2) I used brown sugar for the crumble topping rather than white sugar.
Everything else was per the recipe.  Both of my adult girls were over to test it out with me and we were all blown away with how good it is.  Great Rhubarb cake!!!

This is a great recipe! When I made it I thought I had done something wrong as the batter was particularly dense, but when I baked it, the moisture in the rhubarb cooked out and made the cake moist and delicious. I expect a more experienced baker would have just known that! I did find the sprinkle topping was a bit too much so I'll try reducing that quantity next time I make it. It doesn't call for much spice but really, this lets the beautiful taste of the rhubarb be the star flavour!

I followed this recipe and found it too small an amount of batter for the size of the cake pan suggested. It was more like a soft dough than a cake batter, which I found odd.
The flavour was nice (especially the topping!) but it was a bit dry.

Wow!  Delicious!  I've never made anything with rhubarb before.  Thought you'd taste the bitterness/tartness of the rhubarb but no - not the case.  I might try and tone down the sugar in the cake part next time (I'll try to reduce it from 1 and 1/4 cups down to one cup and see how that goes).

Made it!
 It is a kind of cobbler style of cake. It tastes really good. On the sweet side. I will double the cake part the next time I make this.  Plus I will reduce some of the sugar. Thank you for another yummy recipe. 
 P.S would go great with a scoop of ice cream.

Absolutely delicious, I substituted half dark brown/half cane sugar for the white because that's what I had. 
Also I used full fat 14% sour cream.
This was undoubtedly my familie's favourite rhubarb desert to date!

I made a 1/2 recipe of Oma's Rhubarb Cake (and put it in an 8x8 pan). It is a tasty and moist cake, and really is like rhubarb streusel muffins in a pan! So it can be a dessert, a coffee cake, or a breakfast cake - very versatile indeed. I followed the recipe as adjusted, although was reminded that the pan size and any amounts referred to in the recipe are not modified so I almost made a 'way too sweet' topping :-). This is a great way to use rhubarb, and there are no special ingredients, so if you have the rhubarb, this is a very good recipe to make.

There is seriously something wrong with anyone who doesn't like this cake.  Moist, delicious and full of flavor. My changes were subbing a quarter cup of brown sugar in the cake and adding 1 teaspoon of vanilla. I used all brown sugar and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon in the topping. Make this cake and you won't be disappointed.

The only changes I made was adding a tsp of vanilla to the mix and substituted plain yogurt for sour cream. I baked it a bit longer and it turned out great. One of the best Rhubarb recipes ever.

Delicious moist cake.  I followed the recipe without making any adjustments.  I did read the comments and added a bit of extra flour  to the topping to give it a more crumbly topping.
It's not an overly sweet cake; the topping gives the cake a nice level of sweetness.

I took some suggestions from others (thanks, all!) - added a bit less sugar, used mostly brown instead of white sugar, added some vanilla, used more rhubarb, and put cinnamon right into the crumbly topping. And LOVED it! Wonderful recipe! Oma really knows what's what!

We planted rhubarb in our backyard last fall and had a lot of it grow this spring, so I tried this for dessert tonight (sampled it first to make sure it was fit to serve to guests). It was absolutely amazing! Highly recommend!

followed recipe exactly except used more rhubarb - about 4 cups instead of 3.  chopped it fairly small.  the batter is really thick but I resisted the urge to add some liquid.  this turned out very moist,  not dense, and totally yummy!!!!!  this will now be a regular in my rhubarb recipes, right at the top of the list.

This was really good! I might try the vanilla addition suggested by other reviewers, but it's not necessary. Another cup of rhubarb wouldn't hurt anything, but I'm not sure if I'll follow my husband's suggestion of "double it! At least!"

Made it exactly almost as stated.  I put one teaspoon of  cinnamon in the streusel mix instead of sprinkling on top. Turned out great.

I followed the recipe exactly except I made my own sour cream out of cream (1 cup) and lemon juice (1 TBSP). The 45 minutes was perfect in my oven. I will make this again! I was happy it has so much rhubarb in it. You can really taste the flavour and texture. :)

After reading other reviews, I cut back on the sugar, reducing to 3/4 cup white sugar in the batter and 1/2 cup brown sugar for the topping.  It was excellent, but would still be good with even less sugar (next time I will try 1/2 cup in the batter and see how it comes out.)  I used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  The cake is extremely moist and delicious.  I brought it to an event at church and everyone loved it.  Thanks for sharing!  I made it again and cut the sugar in the batter a little more, down to 1/2 cup.  This is just the right sweetness for me, but I think most people probably would not want to go below 3/4 cup sugar in the batter.  I also doubled the amount of flour in the crumb topping, which worked much better for me.

It was so moist and delicious.  I did not use the butter or flour in the topping.  I just mixed 1 Cup of sugar with the cinnamon and sprinkled it over the cake before I baked it.  My kids loved everything about it!

Used white whole wheat flour and substituted plan no fat greek yogurt instead of sour cream. Also, added 1/2 cup of chopped pecans. And I added two cups of rhubarb and two cups of chopped fresh strawberries. Reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup. The initial mix was very dry, added an additional beaten egg. Upon completion, the cake was tasty but rather dry. Not sure if I will make this again.

Great recipe. I made it as written with a couple subs. I didn't have sour  cream so I used yogurt. I used half brown & half white sugar in the topping & mixed some cinnamon into it. While still warm I served it with a scoop of frozen yogurt. This is a keeper.

I'm not a rhubarb fan, but I LOVE this cake.  The only change I make (slight) is to take 1/4 c of sugar (from the first sugar amt) and sprinkle it over the rhubarb while I am mixing up the rest.  I have shared this recipe many times.

After harvesting some beautiful rhubarb from my garden I told hubby I wanted to try something different then my tried and true recipes. We started looking together and when he saw the word Oma he quickly said "that's the one". We hadn't even read the recipe yet. It was just an emotional thing evoking thoughts of his Oma. I made it and I got only 1 piece. While the crumble was too sweet for my taste and I will alter it slightly next time he loved it. It was part of his breakfast, lunch and dinner for the next 2 days and he strongly hinted I should make another cake instead of a pie. Well I have lots of rhubarb ready to go and much more still in the garden so he will be getting this cake every week for awhile.

I've made this cake about 6 times and it was always excellent!!!  Although I will note that when using frozen rhubarb, I increased the flour by a quarter cup and the sugar by the same. Just to offset the extra moisture from frozen fruit. When using frozen, I also increased baking time to 50-60 minutes. Enjoy!

Couldn't stop eating it!  I made some minor changes to reduce sugar and fat content: used low fat sour cream, some whole wheat flour, and some sugar substitute.  I noticed that the batter was too dry, so I added a little low fat milk, made it easier to spread it in the pan.  I also added spices: nutmeg, cloves and more cinnamon.  Tasted great!  I will make it again.

It turned out fantastic - very moist.  The only thing I would change next time is to add more rhubarb.  I used some frozen rhubarb from the garden so that might have made a difference.

I have made this several times and it's gone in a day!  I use half brown sugar for the mix and brown sugar for the topping.  My husband just loves it and so do our kiddos.  A must try if rhubarb is your thing!

Best I ever made. Used Ellenos greek yogurt instead of sour cream, infused sugar with vanilla beans and used farm fresh eggs, and almost all organic ingredients. I also used an extra 1/2 cup of rhubarb. One could reduce the sugar maybe a little particularly if using white refined. I use the organic from costco(not as sweet).

This was delicious!!! I did make a few minor  adjustments...I used brown sugar instead of white in the topping. I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream b/c it's what I had on hand. I also added vanilla extract to the cake ingredients.  I will definitely make again exactly as I did this time.

Spectacular.  I used last year's frozen rhubarb (added extra)and a few leftover strawberries and it was great.  I would highly recommend.

Wonderful as always. Did not need to make any changes, but add more rhubarb if you have it. Have made this 5 times. Makes a wonderful moist cake . I mix the sugars, using some Splenda brown in cake part.

Very Moist cake which I loved, but would definitely cut the sugar- way way too sweet. I would also use brown sugar as I think it would give more depth of flavour. I also used plain greek yogurt and it was great. Next time I would also add more Rhubarb as others suggested. Great recipe, but will be even better with the tweaks.

made it exactly as it was written.  Second go, I added some fresh blueberries which was good as well.  I also added more flour to the streusel topping which make it a little drier.

Absolutely the best rhubarb cake ever!  Topping stays crisp if it lasts more than a day.  Not too sweet and subtle taste of rhubarb.  I love rhubarb so that's not an issue with me.  Great combination of sweet & tart.  Oh yeah I did mix the cinnamon in with the sugar, flour and butter.  I put some fresh grated nutmeg over the topping.  Not too much nutmeg though.

Love this coffee cake, it's always a hit with or without ice cream or whipped cream. I've changed it slightly, adding a tsp of cinnamon to the batter, and substituting brown sugar for white in the streusel. Also I don't add the streusel until halfway through baking time, I set the timer for 20 minutes and then add it, it keeps the streusel a little crunchy.

I am flooded with rhubarb right now, and was a bit tired of the standard rhubarb fair so decided to give this a go. It was amazing, like most I substituted brown sugar for the white sugar in the topping, other than that followed it to the letter. Super moist and flavorful, everyone went crazy for it! The only complaint was, it wasn't as good the following day, it seems to be best served warm!

Loved this, but like others just tweaked it a bit.  4 cups of rhubarb instead of 3, 1 cup of sugar instead of 1-1/4, 1 tsp of vanilla for the batter, and used brown sugar for the topping.  Very thick batter, so I was a little concerned,  but it came out very moist.  Cover tightly so it stays moist and it stays fine for days.  Delish!!  Easy breezy!!

Wonderful recipe and very easy to make.  I used about 4 cups of rhubarb, as others recommended, and added 1/2 t. cardamon and 1t, nutmeg to the topping (probably will double these amts next time) .  I also cooked it in a convection oven, which should shorten the time, however, it took about an hour to cook.  I'm thinking because of the extra , more moisture.  Thank you Oma!!

This cake was an old fashioned winner for me- used my own rhubarb. The cake was moist and spongy with a crispy crusty topping - just the right amount of sweet to balance the rhubarb. I will definitely make it again.

Added about a 1/2 cup of diced fresh strawberries to the 3 cups of freshly cut rhubarb. Was out of sour cream so supplemented 1/2 cup full-fat Greek yogurt (that's all I had in the fridge) and added a 1/2 cup heavy cream with 1 tsp. of apple cider vinegar (after letting the mixture sit for 15 minutes to curdle) to make up for the disparity. Cut sugar in the batter to 1 1/8 cup rather than 1 1/4 cup. Also added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1 tsp. vanilla to the batter. Used 3/4 cup packed dark brown sugar for topping instead of white sugar. If you are baking in the summer months, you'll have trouble getting the topping to properly crumble with that soft butter and flour mix unless you use additional flour (which I don't like) or your AC is cranked. If your topping is too sticky and clumpy, put the mixture in the freezer for 10 minutes and then break it up with a fork to get it to crumble. 

At the suggested bake time, this was too wet for my taste (as others have noted) so I left it in for an extra 20 minutes.  Came out moist but not undercooked as some here have complained about. Next time I will make sure to have sour cream and may add and extra egg and a bit of baking powder instead of just baking soda as per the recipe.

Made as is (baked on broil for the last minute to make the top crunchier). Brought to pot luck, big success! I think next time I'll make a bit less of the topping as it is very sweet and buttery on top of the delicate cake, just a personal preference. My husband loved it as is!

As I was making I thought this is such a odd cake recipe, but holy cow! It's sooo good. I didn't have baking soda and used 3 tsp of baking powder still turned out  great. Especially with some ice cream.

Loved it I did add 1 tsp vanilla. Next time I will have less sugar on top, 1/2 cup I think. I also added an extra cup of rhubarb.

I have made this recipe several times as written and it is delicious & moist!  I have also made it making a few changes- used greek yogurt instead of sour cream because that is what I had on hand.  I have also made this with 1 cup brown sugar instead of white sugar.  It comes out great every time!  My co-workers love it when I bring it to work as it disappears quickly.

Very good. Made with 1/4 c brown sugar in mix and 1/4 c in topping (sub), added chopped pecans to topping, nice moist cake with crunchy topping. Great. Would definitely make again. Looks nice too. Cooked 350 45 min, perfectly done.

My family and I thought it was awesome. I had problems with my oven going off part way through the baking process - in the end I had to bake it for an extra 40 minutes at 250C in order to have it cooked through in the centre.  Will try again - might add a tad more flower - also I was using Gluten Free flower.

Added more rhubarb.  4 cups to be exact.  My guests raved that it was the best they ever had, and they are true Minnesotans and know their Rhubarb! ;-)

Made this recipe in the nursing home where I work. The residents loved it. The first time I made it I followed the directions exactly and it came out perfect. The second time I made it, we didn't have sour cream so I substituted vanilla yogurt and cut the sugar down to 2/3 cups. And it was still perfect. The residents loved it. One of my resident's said it reminded her of the rhubarb cake her mom used to make.

Everyone loved this, even the little ones; I'll definitely make it again.  I started mixing the dry ingredients together before discovering that DH had hard boiled all the fresh eggs, but I did have a carton of egg whites.  For the 2 eggs, I subbed 4T egg whites plus 2 tsp canola oil.  I  added some cinnamon to the topping, as well as sprinkled some on the batter and over the topping.  Delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is my go to light cake . It is great  for breakfast or snacking when all the grandkids visit. I often add strawberries to the rhubarb or make it with whatever fresh fruit I have. Moist and fresh!

Stuck to the recipe except I had 4C of frozen rhubarb from last year in the freezer - I just let it thaw in the fridge and put it in a strainer before adding - scrumptious!  The topping really made it - and it is more like a coffee cake consistency - wonderful!

This was excellent. I used whole wheat flour because I don't use white flour at all. I also used half fat sour cream instead of regular. I did have to bake it an extra 10 mins. I will definitely make this again.  Yummy.

This was absolutely delicious and I made it exactly as the recipe said.  It was sweet, but it was a great compliment to the tartness of the rhubarb.  I've never made anything with rhubarb before and this one will be a go-to for future crops!  My co-workers called it "vegetable bread" to talk themselves out of it being a sweet bread :)

This is the first time I've ever reviewed any recipe on here, and there's good reason for it. This recipe is AMAZING. Best cake in general that I've ever had in my life. Could use a bit more rhubarb in my opinion, but overall flawless.

Very good, not too sweet. The rhubarb gives it a nice flavor and the crust is divine. I added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp nutmeg to the cake, and as other suggested, I added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the topping instead of dusting. Just perfect with vanilla ice-cream.

The rhubarb in my garden is out of control, so I will happily be making this several more times this year. Made it Monday night and my husband asked if I'd make it again for dinner with his parents later in the week. Made it just as it is written and every body loved it . Unbelievably good and easy.

I have NOT made this yet but as the other recipe I commented on (Rhubard muffins) I bought beautiful stalks (long thin & dark red) & on sale too!  I've made strawberry rhubard pie  but was looking for a couple different ways to use it.  Now i've got 2 more that I can't wait to use. Thanks for all the positive (& negative) reviews. BTW I read the first 10 NEWEST reviews.

I made half recipe in a pie pan because I didn't have that much rhubarb. I also substituted plain yogurt for sour cream. Next time I will try using brown sugar and a drop of almond extract. Tasty and super easy!

I made this using four cups of rhubarb. I changed the topping to 3/4 cup of packed brown sugar instead of white sugar and added chopped walnuts and cinnamon to the topping as well.  It turned out very well, not too sweet.  It's a little unusual so your guests should be fans of rhubarb to appreciate this one.

Absolute perfection! The first time I made this it seemed incredibly thick. I resisted the urge to alter anything. Glad I didn't. (I do regularly substitute sour cream for plain Greek yogurt as that's typically what's on hand ) Such a delicious, moist , cake. Served with vanilla ice cream.

This was very nice.  I was going through my freezer the other day and found a couple of packages of rhubarb that I hadn't used yet.  Added a few nuts and used 1/2 WW four.  A little cardamom, mace and a 1/4 c european marmalade.  Came out terrific.  I'll probably do the same at a later date with the rest of the rhubarb.  I never really follow a recipe, so rating this is difficult, but if Modify it and it comes out terrific, then I figure the basic recipe is really good--so 5 stars. Thanks!

Great cake, easy to assemble and bake.  Added teaspoon of vanilla and cinnamon to the sour cream/ egg mixture... used 3/4 cup of brown sugar in place of the white sugar in the cake and half the topping (relying on other posts).
Perfect, moist, tart and not too sweet.. just needs a cup of tea or coffee... will make again... Made again using half sour cream and half non fat vanilla yogurt... perfect!

Wonderful! Used 4 1/2 cups rhubarb, and cut the sugar in half. Also used brown sugar in the topping, and about 1/3 cup of chopped walnuts to make it crunchier. Just Excellent!  Oh, and also had no sour cream, so used someone else's advice -- used milk & vinegar & left to sour. Turned out great!

Fantastic all purpose recipe. I've used this recipe dozens of times, with many kinds of fruit. Canned & fresh peaches, berries, and yes, even fresh rhubarb. Turns out perfectly each time, to rave reviews. I tend to add a bit more fruit, just to make it yummier. And I add various spices depending on the fruit - cardamon, cinnamon, zest of various fruits, etc. Love it.

This was GREAT!! The cake (with an extra cup of rhubarb) was light and flavourful.  I used half a cup of brown sugar and half white in the topping and that was delicious.  A keeper for sure!!  Thanks!!

Everyone loved this cake. To make it a little healthier I replaced a cup of the flour with one cup of whole wheat flour and used 1 cup of greek nonfat yogurt for the sour cream. For the topping I subbed half of the butter for coconut oil and added 1/4 cup of oatmeal with 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour. It was crunchy and delicious! Will make this again.

Very moist and tasty.  I did use almost 4 cups of rhubarb instead of 3.  Still wish it was more tart and had a stronger rhubarb taste.

Oma was a genius. I made this with all purpose gluten free flour and xanthan gum. Along with the brown sugar substitution listed above. I added oatmeal to the topping. It was moist and tasty.

I made the recipe exactly as written and it was wonderful. It makes a nice cake which is not too sweet. The little tart kicks from the rhubarb are just right. Thanks for another great way to use rhubarb.

Gone in no time!!!! Deliciously sweet and tart. Substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream, only because that's what I had, and it was amazing!!!!! Topping is a crisp treat! I'm making another one tomorrow.

Delicious. I made this gluten free by substituting gluten free flour mixture and one tsp zanthum gum in place of regular flour and used brown sugar in the topping instead of white sugar as another person suggested. Everyone loved it here!

Beginner cook. After dicing 3 cups of rhubarb thought "THIS BETTER BE GOOD". It was. Had to bake an additional 15 minutes before the tester came out clean.

I added vanilla and agree with another reviewer the topping needs more  flour. Absolutely delicious even with a little tweaking. Like that it uses lots of rhubarb and not fat other than sour cream in the topping. This is a keeper.

Excellent use of the abundant rhubarb in my backyard. I used vanilla yogurt in place of sour cream and added 3/4 tsp cinnamon to the crumb topping. I baked for 35 minutes in 2 8x8 pans to share with the neighbors. A great blend of tangy and sweet.

This recipe, as written, is wonderful.  I've made it many times.  I also like to change the white sugar out for brown sugar.  I also like to add 1/4 cup oatmeal to the strudel topping for a bit of texture.  Alea your Oma must have been a wonderful grandmother if she could make something this yummy!

Lovely recipe!  I didn't have sour cream, so substituted the same amount of vanilla yogurt.  I also added two cups of diced strawberries.  Used half whole wheat flour and half unbleached white flour.  I also cut back on the sugar for the topping.  It was moist and dense and fruity, much like an English bread pudding.

I didn't have sour cream, so I used a 6 oz container of low cal peach yogurt and the rest mayo!  Also threw in some brown sugar in the topping mix.  This is seriously one of the best cakes I've ever made!  I love that I now have something delicious to make with the rhubarb that grows in my yard.

This cake was good, but I think it was too sweet and a little bland. Next time I will use half brown sugar in the cake and topping, add walnuts to the topping, and add vanilla and spices to the cake batter. Even though I wasn't a huge fan, my coworkers raved about it.

This is a coffee cake so it is intended to be dense and moist. The recipe is perfect as is. I used frozen rhubarb and drained it well before adding to the batter. Its great warm from the oven and just as good cold. Hubby had 2 pieces.  I might try using brown sugar for the topping instead of white granulated. It is a great cake that can be used with frozen apple or fresh peaches.

Made per directions many times.   Only variation is sometimes a little more or less rhubarb.   Everyone who tastes this loves it- even people who are not big rhubarb eaters!

My husband had four pieces of this and a lot of others had seconds.  I substituted the sour cream for plain yogurt and added some vanilla extract.  I changed it to 4+ cups of rhubarb and put half brown and half white sugar.  This cake is light and very good!

It was a good recipe, but I have a rhubarb coffee cake recipe that is similar to this one, but better.

I made this many times last year and always got great reviews. Now that it's rhubarb season I'm gearing up to make it again! Yummy!

Just made this and it is lovely! I saw the recipe and really wanted to try it but had no rhubarb, so I used frozen strawberries and used mostly brown sugar for the cake and all brown sugar for the topping. Gave it a real caramelized, sticky flavour. Yummy, yummy, yummy
Definitely adding to my recipe box!
