This was very tasty! I baked the veggies in the marinade for ten minutes and then served them over cooked couscous. I will definitely make this again.

This is one of the best sauces for vegetables I have ever tasted! And so simple and easy to prepare. Grilled or baked your vegetables come out tasting wonderful!

This recipe tastes much better than it sounds. I made it for a group of 4H kids with zucchini squash mushrooms and tomatoes and they really liked it.

This was very good! We are not big fans of clove but surprisingly this was an excellent recipe! We made beef kabobs with veggies and used this on mushrooms zuchinni yellow squash red yellow and green bell pepper and onion. They came out grilled to perfection! Of course we use a different marinade for the beef (beef or chicken marinade listed in allrecipes too) Very tasty! Thanks for the recipe and making our tummies happy!

This was a little too sweet for me - although my friends seemed to like it.

We tried this sauce on kabobs and grilled them. I didn't care for them but everyone else thought they were good. I guess if we had more time we would have tried a marinade and soaked the veggies but since we had to make them quick this seemed to work well. The sauce didn't have much zip.

For a summer twist I cooked the veggies (broccoli onion peppers) after marinating in a skillet until tender crisp. Then removed them from the liquid and cooked on a high heat grill covered with foil to finish. Served over couscous..... Delicious!

This was a pleasant surprise - delicious combination as is! Used large mushrooms and green red & yellow peppers. Left in the mixture for a good day and grilled. Everyone loved it and will definitely use it again!

I had some pineapple juice leftover from another recipe and decided to give this one a try. Typically I do not like pineapple flavor in savory dishes but this turned out pretty good. I would leave out the cloves next time. I don't think they brought anything to the recipe.
