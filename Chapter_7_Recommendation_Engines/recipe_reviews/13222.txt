This recipe was not good. They should have named it Mushy Rice Jambalaya. Not only that, but the flavor was odd. I would suggest to omit the whole cloves. True, it smelled so nice when it was cooking, but we sat down to eat it and I hated it! Don't waste your time with this recipe, it's an insult to Jambalaya.

This recipe was very good.  The only thing that I wasn't pleased with was the rice was too mushy...maybe next time put the rice in a three hours later into the cooking. I also had to add a some water toward the last of the cooking time.

Wish I had read the reviews before I made this! It smelled wonderful but tasted awful.It was very mushy and pasty. We threw most of it away.

Cooking rice all day seems to turn it to "Wallpaper Paste"  Not impressed.

Definitely wallpaper paste once it's cooked in the slow cooker for that long. I wasted $ on buying the stuff to try this recipe and to top it all off, I had my parents over to try it as well. It's a big joke now between all of us.

This recipe was quite awful.  I'm used to jambalaya having a nice spicy heat.  This was mushy with an unpleasant flavor.  It was nice to prepare in a slow cooker, however, the end result is quite poor.

This recipe was O.K. I had to add water to it and the rice turned out a bit mushy, but my husband liked it O.K. I modified the recipe and added a dash of Tabasco, cayenne pepper and a bay leaf so the taste was not bad. I would try this recipe again only I would leave the rice out, cook all day, THEN add cooked rice during the last 45 minutes perhaps?

Add a cup of water or broth. Use wild rice instead of white rice, cook it separately, and mix it in when you mix in the shrimp. These simple steps rescue this recipe from the problems reported by others.

I took the advice of many commenters and left the rice out of the recipe and served it instead on the side :) Very good jambalaya!!!

Really revamped this due to all the negative comments.  No shrimp and didn't have tomato paste.  Also added small carrots to the mix along with the other veggies, some chicken broth, diced seasoned tomatoes and some more celery.  Not too bad, would just call it leftover ham stew.   Added the ham the last hour and cooked on high for 4 hours.

I used cheyenne pepper. Used cooked shrimp and added the rice with the shrimp in the last hour on low. My family loved it.
