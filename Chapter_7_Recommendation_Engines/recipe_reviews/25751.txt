I had to make a quickie dinner tonight and decided on soup being that my daughter Ashley is home with a really nasty cold, coupled with the fact that it's freezing here in N.J.!! I'm not complaining because I love winter and snow; and we've had a lot of both! Anyway, my gang went crazy over this soup as they always order F.O. soup as an appetizer when we go out for dinner, however these were the changes I made: I only used four large onions, two small cans of low salt beef broth, two cans of beef consomme', a tablespoon of sugar added to the onion while sauteeing and a tablespoon of flour just before the onion was done browning. I used Guinness beer which gave it a great flavor. Thanks so much Carolyne for cluing us in on the dry mustard and beer additons!

This was a big hit with my friends!  Everyone loved it!  On demand, I ended up making this the next week for another party!  Thanks!***Update.  Almost 5 years later I am still making this recipe.  I've tried others and still come back to this.  However, I do add a dash of thyme, a splash of Worcestershire, sugar to onions and flour to onions when almost done.

I've tried many french onion soup recipes, and this one was pretty good.  I reduced the number of onions to 6 and I added two tablespoons of flour to the onions right before they finished cooking.  I used a brown ale and it gave the soup a really good flavor. I added a little salt at the end, but that was just my own personal taste. I would definitely try this again!

This soup was very flavorful I added a splash of red wine for color.  I did use Vidallia onions which made the soup far too sweet.  I would stick to white or yellow onions.

It is VERY unusual when I don't  doctor up a recipe.  In the case of this one, it was not necessary.  Did add a bit more dry mustard and black pepper than called for, and used Feta instead of Gruyere (didn't have any).  It was VERY, VERY DELICIOUS.

I have never made French Onion Soup before this recipe is not only easy, it tastes fantastic! My husband has been wanting me to make French onion soup because its his favorite. Well my husband said that it was the best he's ever had, even better than at a restaurant.  I highly recommend this recipe & will be making it again & again! Thank-you so much for the recipe!

Very good recipe! Seasonings are always what I am most tentitive about and it is what makes a good dish great. I used a half bottle of Bass Dark Ale, a little sugar to brown up the onions nicely, and low sodium broth, which then needed some salt to bring it where it needed to be--all of that because of my choices, not because of Carolyne's recipe. Very good, Carolyne!

This has been a hit whenever I serve it.  I never use large sweet onions, so I don't need as many as the recipie calls for. A cup measurement would be nice. I also put a little worchestershire sauce in to add a litte more zip.  It's a great soup that I always have the ingredients on hand for.  (Who doesn't have at least one stray bottle of beer in their 'fridge?)

This soup is absolutely delicious.  I love the addition of the beer (rather than the wine that many onion soup recipes use).  I used Newcastle brown ale and it added a nice taste to the recipe.  Thanks for a great recipe, will be added to my permanent collection

The soup tastes delicious. However adding 10 onions is absurd. I added 4 and a half and it was plenty. I added more beef broth than called for too.

This is truely a great soup, I used Boston Lauger, being a nightclub, what a great thing for my customers. I make it in large quantities and it was truely great, I use chinese hot dry mustard and it added just a very small kick to it, and I used a fresh loaf of bread from the local bakery, I premelted a slice of provalone on top of the bread slices and then topped it with freshly gratted Parmesean, it came out great and was great for a cold rainy night in the northwest

Wow!  This was amazing!  It was my first try at French Onion and my husband sang my praises all through the meal.  I thought that there would be too many onions, but I followed the recipe and it was fine.  I used Samuel Adams beer and substituted Swiss cheese.  This is defiantly a keeper.

This is a nice, light version of the traditional french onion soup, this meant even my children ate and enjoyed it, which they wouldn't have done with a soup made with wine. Not just that but it was tasty to boot, I made mine with vegatable stock. Thank you for sharing, it will be made again here.

This is a great recipe, I like the flavor contributed by the beer (I used a lager)...it is a nice change from the consumme flavor.  Perfect for a cold fall afternoon.  I will definitely make this again.

The only thing I changed was reducing the onions, based on some of the other reviews.  Was fabulous.  Used Irish Death dark ale, which is somewhat sweet.  Served to guests and they loved it.

This was a little different take, but I liked it.  I did add a little sugar to the onions, and wished I had added a little more.  Perhaps the beer I used was just a little too dark/bitter?  Will try something a little lighter next time.

After making this recipe, I was told it was the best my friends had ever tasted! There were no leftovers! The beer really added a great flavor. I also had to use Jarlsberg cheese--all I had on hand, but it turned out delicious!!

I just made this exact recipe this weekend with a hunk of Beef in a slow cooker.  Trust me, ten onions is NOT absurd!  If it is done right, the onions will become translucent and practically melt away.  Enjoy this with a hunk of homemade French bread and some sweet butter and away we go!  Excellent recipe!

I followed this recipe except for decreasing the onions to 6 yellow and 1 vidallia, it took longer to brown than the recipe, and I substituted half Swiss and half Provolone cheese; it was a big hit with company, I will make it again

GREAT!! After onions were browned (used only 6 avg sized onions) I added 1TB flour to thicken and 1TB brown sugar for richness. Didn't have enough Gruyere, so I mixed what I had with mozzarella and topped with parmesan. YUM!

This recipe's definately a keeper. The taste is wonderful, I also added a splash of Worchestershire, presentation is also key here. Spend the extra to buy the soup crocks and you'll feel like you're eating in a fancy restuarant every time you make this wonderful soup.

I replaced the beef broth with beef consomme - it gave the soup a rich smooth flavor.  this is one of the best onion soups I have ever had.

This was pretty good.  For me, it wasn't the best flavor for french onion soup, but that's my taste.  It was good and I enjoyed it, but I have had better.  I liked the change in flavor, but I prefer more standard broths wiht the sherry/wine flavor for this soup.  Glad I tried it, though.

I thought the onions would be over-powering, but the beer and bay leaf blended in great. I'd definitely make this a million more times

Hmmm... After reading all these great reviews, I'm trying to figure out why mine came out less flavorful, an almost bland, sweetish taste that was definitely not my fave. Followed the recipe, used a Dos Equis beer and increased the salt and pepper - to no avail!

This is very good and easy too! I did use 5 onions not the 10 it called for. The beer gave it a nice taste. My husband rated it a 9 out of 10 and trust me...thats really good!! I will make this again and again!!

If you follow the recipe as given, it is amazing! The flavor is wonderful. Not crazy about all the onions? Pull them out when you ladle the soup into the bowl before baking, so you get all the flavor but not all of the onion. Very nice. My family looks forward to having this again.

I made this soup for a group of friends and it was a hit!  I used seasoned croutons as a substitute for toasted bread and it was great!  I also substitutes mozzerella cheese in the recipe.

I made this for Christmas dinner, and got rave reviews.  Absolutely scrumptious; wouldn't change a thing.  Used Killian's Red as the beer.  YUMMM!

I was visiting my son in MA, and he rarely cooks. I’d bought some avocados and onions to make guacamole one day and had about 10 small onions left over. I knew they’d go bad if I didn’t do something with them, and decided a big pot of this soup would be good. Any left over he could freeze. He is vegan, so I used vegan margarine, and vegetable bouillon instead of butter and beef stock. We decided not to bother with the toast, but if we had, I’d have used some vegan cheese. It turned out great!

Excellent, I did make a change, (for broth bring a vegetarian I do not use beef broth,) I use beer. I don’t  like store vegetable broth because some are just too salty. It was a chilly day and perfect for soup.

I was looking for a French onion soup with wine or sherry and came across this one. Soup is my favorite thing to make.    I was skeptical, so I put about 2 cups of the base mixture in a separate pot, then added the beer and mustard.     It was fabulous!   So back in the big pot it went.   I added additional mustard and garlic.  I used a little extra unsalted butter.   Also used thin sliced provolone cheese because I had it on hand.

This recipe got filed in my recipe box.

This is exactly what I hoped it would be. Changes made were red wine instead of beer (it's what I had in hand, ahem), and "Not-Beef" bullion instead of beef broth, since I don't eat meat products. I was concerned that it would be too vegetable-y if I used veg broth...Not-Beef is more of a mushroom broth, I think, and it worked well. All in all, a fantastic recipe that is easily made vegetarian. Thank you!

My husband said he didn't want beer in his soup. How wrong he was !!  He loved it.
Used 4 large onions, add 1 T of sugar and flour. Used vegetable broth as that was all I had.   Very good and easy to make

I made this as written the first time and it was waaaaaaaaaaaaaay to many onions.  The second time I made it, I used 6 onions about the size of my fist.  Perfect!  I used a nut brown ale both times but would like to try it with a stout. I would also say, don't use cheap cheese.  This soup is worthy of a good Gruyere.

Nothing special.  Made it as recommended, used Bass Ale for the beer.  Broth wasn't as rich as i've had in restaurants.  Used swanson beef broth.
