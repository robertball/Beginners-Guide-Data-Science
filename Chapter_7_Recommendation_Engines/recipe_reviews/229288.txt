We altered the recipe as follows, did not boil the zucchini (we like it crunchy. We make our own sauce using both crushed and stewed tomatoes. We also added some defrosted mixed veggies and gave it a little kick adding crushed red pepper flakes. This is a wonderful recipe and we plan on making many more times.

Delicious! I did cut the recipe back and pretty much eye-balled everything, but I did use all the ingredients called for. I used whole wheat seasoned breadcrumbs in place of regular. We really enjoyed the addition of the onions, breadcrumbs and parm. I will be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
