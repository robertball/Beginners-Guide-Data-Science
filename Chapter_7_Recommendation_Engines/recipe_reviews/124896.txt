This is a very easy and delicious meal to make. I only made a few changes, which were that I added a large can of diced green chiles, and pepper jack cheese to give this recipe a little more flavor. And it came out perfectly!

What a great way to use that frozen spinach in the back of the freezer! Very tasty, very simple. I did add a few things because my family likes their enchiladas spicy: one small can of mild green chilies (some in the sauce, most in the chicken mixture) and some pepperjack cheese inside each enchilada as well. Yummy and healthy too! Even my picky toddler liked it!

This was a good basic recipe, but needed some doctoring to make it a great recipe. Added black beans, green chiles and 4 oz lower fat cream cheese in the filling, used wheat tortillas, added other spices (cayenne pepper, dash of cumin, white pepper, red pepper flakes) and omitted the nutmeg, used 2% milk Mexican blend for cheese. Mmmm, I think we found a keeper!

I liked it!!!! Only used 1/2 of the spinach and will make sure it's spread out really good...some of it clumped and made it too spinachy. I added some shredded carrot and may add some brocolli and cauliflower chopped fine next time for more veggies. In the sauce I added cayenne pepper and just a touch of the nutmeg.
I really liked this alot!!!! Very filling and a great way to get the veggies in there.

This recipe turned out very well for us. Even better the second day. We also added some green chilies and Pepper Jack cheese and it was just the right touch. I will probably leave out the nutmeg next time around, but we just don't have very sophisticated tastebuds. Thanks for the recipe!

Nutmeg in Enchiladas is weird.  It was really overpowering.  If I ever make these again I will use chili powder or maybe cumin instead.  I also boiled my chicken and used a mexican cheese blend.  Mozerella cheese just seems Italian to me, not mexican.

After cooking the meat and onions, I mixed with all the ingredients and ran it through the food processor. Added fresh cilantro, jalepenos, black olives, replaced the milk and soup with 1/2 cup of cottage cheese. Spice wise: Adobo Seasoning, Cayenne, White Pepper, Cumin, Garlic, and who knows what else. I also used whole wheat tortillas. I went a little crazy. It was DELICIOUS!!

Turned out awesome, took others suggestion to use sour cream, less milk.Plus once I had started to prepare them I realized I did not have the spinach! So I chopped up brocolli and lightly steamed it before adding it to the mixture.
A keeper. Thank you

Used fresh spinach and per other reviews, left out the milk, soup and nutmeg, and used cheddar rather than mozzarella.  The sour cream made it creamy enough.  Really tasty, and can be made very healthily with whole grain tortillas and skim dairy products.

Easy to make.  Great idea with the spinach.  I would leave out the nutmeg.  I am just not a big fan of nutmeg.  I would also add green chilis and maybe some cheese inside the mix that goes into the enchilada-we love cheese.

Nothing frustrates me more than when I read reviews and change a recipe, then wish I hadn't messed with it.  Reducing the nutmeg (sorry not a fan) and possibly adding the pepper jack cheese are good suggestions, adding extra spices is not.  After reading reviews, I was afraid this would be bland so I added extra garlic, a bit of cumin and ground pepper.  It was too strong and ended up overpowering the wonderful creaminess of the recipe.  Not all recipes need a "kick." I plan on making this again as written minus the nutmeg.

This was amazing!  I did make 2 changes (sorry, I know some people hate it when others do that.)  I used 1/2 tsp cumin in place of the nutmeg, and omitted the onions & just stirred a can of mild green chilies into the soup/sour cream mixture.  So creamy and yummy!  Thank you!

Oh so good!  I cubed the chicken (young kids) and add fresh sliced mushrooms when I have them, but otherwise, don't change a thing!

It tasted very bland and felt like it was missing something. The recipe called for too much spinach. You should use about half the spinach if you decide to make these.

This was really good.  I added 2 cloves of crushed fresh garlic while sauteeing the chicken and onions, and followed some other suggestions and added a can of green chilies.  I also used pepper jack cheese instead of mozzerella to give it some kick.  It was really good, but I still felt like it was missing something, so I only gave 4 stars.  Maybe some chopped red bell pepper?

This was really good. I didn't use the cream of mushroom soup, as I make my own powdered cream soup mix, but this was still fantastic! Will make again!

I made this recipe tonight for my family. I used the exact measurements and prepared the recipe to the exact instructions. The mixture came out great with nice flavor but honestly there is something missing from the chicken, spinach, and onions. Something to flavor it and make it pop. I will try to add something the next time around.

I replaced the nutmeg with cumin and added chili powder. I liked that there was spinach in it, but I used fresh. I cut the spinach into small pieces and added it to the chicken, stirred and removed from heat. I used wheat tortillas. My husband likes my normal enchiladas better. I used skim milk and low fat cheese and sour cream. Too much milk too soup.

This was EXCELLENT. I cut the nutmeg in half, so it was fairly subtle. I think it would be great with seafood, too: shrimp and scallops maybe? With a touch of white when to deglaze the pan before mixing in the spinach.

The nutmeg overpowered the whole recipe :( next time I will leave the nutmeg out. I did not think this recipe has a mexican taste to it either so I added enchilada sauce over the enchiladas while they baked.

I did mine more 'casserole' style: 2 cans white meat chicken, sauteed fresh spinach & onion, sour cream, milk, 1 can low sodium cream mush soup, garlic blend seasoning, corn tortillas, (layered lasagna-style), then mozzarella blend cheese on top towards the end. A big hit in our house !

I have made this twice and both times I pressure cooked the chicken breast for half an hour with some mexican seasoning and a bay leaf and then I shred it.  I also added the green chili's to the chicken mixture along with a little bit of cheese.  All in all good recipe - I too like the pepper jack cheese for more heat :)

I swaped the nutmeg for chili powder (I think taco seasoning would be really good as well), used corn tortillas as well and they were really good, I used fresh spinach instead of frozen, added a can of green chilis and 4 oz of cream cheese to the inside of the enchiladas and was heavy hannded on the cheese which I swaped for colby jack insted of mozzarella.  They were really good!

MMMMmmmmmmm.  These were really good and filling!  I like onion so I doubled the amount.  I also added diced red peppers, black olives, and a can of black beans.  I used whole wheat totillas and my husband and I ate these for dinner and lunch for 3 days!  I highly suggest topping each one with fresh salsa.

I made the recipe as it says and it was great!! I had a request to make spinach chicken enchilada's and this was the only recipe I found on allrecipes.com. Next time I might add some green chiles or pepper jack cheese but that's only because I like my enchilada's to have a little more of a kick. It was still great without them though :)

Very good, but lacks ZIP.  (Just having tortillas does not make it an Enchilada dish.)  I added 1 Tablespoon of chopped Jalapenos to the sauce just before addding it to the chicken and it came out great!

I love this recipe and I've had rave reviews everytime I make it for company. My changes include using fresh spinach (sauteed first) and at least doubling it, I use half the sauce mixure with no milk, pepper jack cheese instead of mozz, no nutmeg and a little cumin. It turns out great!

I was quite disappointed with this. For one thing, I followed this recipe exactly except that I halved the recipe (using two chicken breasts), and I ended up not having enough of the filling to sufficiently fill the four 8" tortillas. So I strongly suggest using more chicken and spinach than the recipe calls for (you'll still have enough of the sauce). Also, it really lacked in flavor. I suggest at least doubling the amount of garlic powder. I also think this would be better with sauteed mushrooms added to the mixture. It just needs something more.

This recipe was great! I omitted the nutmeg and seasoned my chicken. I also used mexican blend cheese instead of mozzarella.  Next time I will add fresh cilantro for extra flavor.Overall it was a really good recipe.

This recipe could make 5 stars with a little more kick! Adding green chiles and  cumin, plus maybe some jalepenos? We like more spice and flavor than these had, but it would be easily adjusted!

My husband made this last night and it was delicious.  He added diced roma tomatoes along with the cheese for the last 15 minutes.  The only I would add would be some pepper or adobo seasoning for flavor, but this is definitely a keeper!

I thought these were excellent.  I didn't change much, but this recipe would be easy to adapt to a lower fat recipe using low fat yogurt instead of sour cream, skim milk, and healthy-version of Cream of Mushroom soup.  I thought the flavor could be a little better by putting a little bit of cheese in the filling.  The only changes I did do is to use Monterey Jack/cheddar cheese mixture and to add pepper and a dash hot pepper sauce to the soup mixture.

This dish was very very tasty!! I also like food with a little bit of a kick so used pepperjack cheese and added green chili peppers to the sauce as well. It was absolutely delicious.

Pretty good. I left out the nutmeg and only put in about half of the spinach it called for.  Too mushy otherwise.  I also added more chicken.  Needs hot sauce/or green sauce when served.

I'm not sure what went wrong with these enchiladas.  My husband and I couldn't even finish our servings.  I'm crazy about spinach and often eat it plain.  They were pretty bland and made a weird consistency.

These are the best home made enchiladas I've made.  I used a little extra spinach than the recipe indicates, and also added a little cayenne pepper to give it some zing.
