This was delicious and so easy to make. Don't let the looks or sound of it fool you. Find a video online of how to wrap the parchment and just go for it. The only thing that was a bit hard was trying to keep the wine and lemon juice from leaking out of the sides while I was folding. All in all though, it was very easy and made a wonderful, healthy, light, flaky, incredibly aromatic fish. The presentation is great too (see my photo...which doesn't do it justice). I didn't have capers so went without, but I would recommend using them and not rinsing the brine off. The dish was lacking in salt because I didn't have them (though in retrospect, green olives with a little of their juice might have sufficed). This dish is the only thing I've ever seen my Dad put salt on (I did salt the fish beforehand). I paired this with "Stuffed Peppers Italian Style" from this site. I will absolutely make this dish again. Thanks so much for posting Paula!

This was delicious and easy!  We are trying to eat more healthy so I made a few changes.  I mixed the tomato, garlic, basil and capers together.  Then after drying the filets and seasoning them with salt and pepper, I spooned over a bit of the tomato mixture on each filet.  I topped with a slice of lemon rather than lemon juice to keep it from being too juicy.  I omitted the butter and wine.  I loosely folded the parchment paper leaving gaps for steam to escape.  I did not grease the baking sheet, and I baked in a 350 degree oven for 20 minutes.  The fillets were moist and perfect.  I served with rice and salad and even the kids gobbled it up with requests for seconds!  This will definitely be a repeat in our home.

This was a really easy and quick recipe...great for a weekday dinner. I wish we made more. We served it with brown rice (which soaked up the juice nicely) and asparagus. I will make it again. Did I mention that I usually hate tilapia because it is so bland? This was very flavorful!

Really yummy. A big hit with the family. I added a thin slice of lemon on top of each fish fillet, and I did the pouches in aluminum foil instead of parchment paper.  Just as tasty and worked just as well, and no need to butter the pan under the pouches.

This recipe calls for far too much wine.. the paper does not close well with this much liquid.  You really cannot taste anything except the lemon and of course the fish.

This was so good I couldn't believe it was so delicous.  No worries about dried out fish!  Since I prefer salt water fish, I used sea bass.  Unbelievable!

Wonderful. I bought the wine to use, and then forgot to add it. I did everything else the recipe called for, and my husband said it was the best fish presentation he's had in years (he's grown up in a restaurant, foodie family and has traveled with business eating in very great restaurants). So very easy to make. I used parchment paper pockets and they worked wonderfully. Will do this again!

I love eating healthy and this recipe certainly fits the bill.  I haven't used parchment paper and whole lot, but followed the easy instructions and it turned out great!
