I give this five stars only after revising the recipe as follows:
increase chopped tomatoes to 1 gallon
reduce jalapenos to 3 chopped jalapeno peppers.
increase onions to 2 cups
add 1 tablespoon of sugar
add one box frozen sweetcorn
increase garlic powder to 2 tablespoons
bring to boil and reduce heat to simmer uncovered for 2 to 3 hours stirring regularly.  One hour before completion add two 12 oz cans of tomato paste and stir in well.
Cook until salsa is thick enough for your taste and just before removing from the heat add 1/2 cup of a dry red wine.
This will can well and also freezes well.
Add more peppers to give it more kick or stir in hot sauce before serving for those who like more heat...

Although it's not a quick Salsa to make it is really worth the wait. I spooned out half of the batch and let the other half continue an extra hour and it was indeed spicier. Looking forward to some sport events to try this again.

I have modified this recipe to my liking. I have added 1 tsp of hickory smoke seasoning(liquid) and 1 cayenne pepper chopped really fine and also substituted a  regular red pepper along with the geen pepper to this recipe.Also use 1/2 the vinegar and I used white vinegar .Now I like this recipe.Great recipe to try and play with. !!!!!!!!!!!

I don't eat salsa, but this got a HUGE thumbs down from hubby.  He didn't like this recipe at all.   While I was cooking it, it looked more like soup than salsa, due to all the vinegar.  I actually ended up straining it all out, but apparently, it didn't help.  Hubby said the vinegar taste was overwhelming.  I don't recommend this recipe and will delete it from my box.

Very watery and way too many jalepeneos.
I like my salsa thick and some kick, but this just "burns" so bad that you
will not be able to taste the flavors.

This makes great salsa, I found however that if you follow this recipe to the letter it is far too sloppy. I cooked mine for 50 mins and then took the lid off and carried on cooking it for about 40 mins until a lot of the liquid had evapourated. Fantastic in choriso or steak sandwiches with focatia or chiabatta bread.

This is a very easy recipe. I never made homemade salsa before, but my husband said, "It was better than a local restaurant that we ate at." That means a lot to me. I don't like when recipes don't turn out. Anyone could make this recipe. Of course I added some black pepper, cajun spice, and some other ingredients. I care not to reveal. Thank you.

This is my first traditional salsa recipe experience, with fresh vegetables for all the ingredients. I cooked it for what seemed like 2 1/2 hours, and my husband and his father both gave it a huge 2 thumbs up! I canned it in 1/2 pint jars (also my first canning experience), and ended up with 7 jars. It's going to last a long time. I liked the simple ingredient list and for once had everything fresh from my garden and in my pantry! My husband said I could do this recipe again, and my father-in-law took a jar home with him! Hats off to a great recipe Kim Niederreither!

This worked out very well.  As another reviewer suggested, I didn't add any water and simmered the mixture for well over an hour.  It tasted and smelled excellent!  Thank you

The best salsas would not inculde vinegar as an ingriedient, but a salsa is to be fresh and not drowned in liquid, lest they be tomatoes that are pureed in some salsas or other fruits such as avocado or mango, etc.

I would use 4 cups canned diced tomatoes with the juice and replace the green peppers with red, orange or yellow as green can cause acid reflux with some people.  Pour hot salsa into hot sterilzed jars and screw down tight, will keep up to six months or more if it lasts that long.  The heat from the jalapeno pepper depends on how any seeds you leave in them that's where the heat comes from.

I thought that this sounded like a really good recipe and I was impressed at first with how easy it was and how beautiful the color was when began to simmer.  I was very dissatisfied with the finished product.  The overall taste was quite poor and the vinegar was overly pronounced, distracting from the tomato base and remaining ingredients.  I would encourage others to find a better recipe.

I made this salsa last year and have to make more this year. Everyone loves it. I canned it in pint jars and made several batches but we went through it all. Very good, you can control the hear with the amount of peppers you put in.

Everyone loved it. I accidentally doubled the tomatoes but glad I did. We all agreed it needed less cigar vinegar and extra jalapeño. Hoping to can some of this recipe next time.
