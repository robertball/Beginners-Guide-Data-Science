I thought this wasn't too bad when eaten straight from the oven. I followed the directions exactly, except I did defrost the veggies a little in some water and drained them well before proceeding with the recipe. It was kind of like a kabob somewhat, but without the stick. I would have liked some type of seasoning I didn't have to consider on my own or what is the point of a recipe. Just make sure to eat this dish right when it is finished. Once re-heated the chicken gets a little dry and the vegetables kind of soften a bit too much for my taste.

I used salted and peppered chicken thighs as these veggies tend to lack seasoning.  Since it's summer I grilled out and put the veggies in a foil pouch with 1/2 tsp garlic powder and onion powder. Love the ease of the product but would love more seasoning.

This was okay. Needs a lot more seasoning than recipe calls for.

I think the ease of this dish is great because it came together in minutes and was very quick to cook.  Personally though - we prefer a crisper vegetable, so, we weren't big fans of this product.  The vegetables were much to soft for us.  Based on the other reviews I did add some Italian seasoning to the mix before broiling.  I think without some extra flavor it would be very bland.

This was ok; not horrible, but not great either. I really liked that it was quick and everything cooked in one pan. Thankfully the veggies add quite a bit of flavor to the dish, because the chicken is bland bland bland. I even added two crushed gloves of garlic to the mix. To get more flavor, it'd be beneficial to marinate the chicken in the oil and vinegar mix for a few hours, but I guess that defeats the purpose of a quick, last minute meal. I cooked everything for 12 minutes.  The recipe ready veggies are very handy, however I miss the crunch of fresh veggies.

Most people didn't seem to like this that much, but I thought it was great! I read a few reviews before I broiled it and figured I should take heed to what was mentioned most. Most reviewers stated the chicken needed more seasoning. I lightly used creole seasoning on both sides of my boneless chicken. I followed the ingredients as it was called, but I poured more balsamic vinegar on the chicken and the veggies. This dish was all about flavor considering it is a broiled dish. I noticed my chicken was cooking too fast. Therefore, I broiled it on Low. The high setting was burning the outside and the inside was pink. My chicken was frozen. Once it thawed in the oven I applied the creole seasoning to ensure it wouldn't be bland. I think it cooked broiled for 20 minutes. Guys my husband thought it was good! It's a winner in my house. I don't think I would change anything I did.

Couldn't find the frozen grilled veggies so substituted for other veggies but turned out great. I wasn't greedy with the cheese and made a rice side. Delicious.

Very quick, easy, and tasty! I didn't have Birds Eye veggies...just used zucchini, squash, onion, and mushrooms I already had. I added a bit of Worcestershire sauce & garlic (for my taste). I will definitely be using this recipe again! ??

This was pretty good. I dont eat plain chicken though. I marinaded my chicken in Caribbean jerk then grilled it. Then I cooked it all together in a skillet.

This came out pretty good. I did marinate the chicken in the balsamic vinegar and oil ahead of time. I made this for a potluck for some non cooking friends to show them they can do it!!! They really liked the idea of not having to cut up all of the veggies themselves. This definitely needed some added seasoning. Great idea Birds Eye for when the vegetables are not in season... they would cost alot more to buy them fresh.

This dish comes together quickly and the color from the veggies is lovely. Needs a little more seasoning but the chicken is moist from the short cooking time.

I couldnâ€™t find the bag of frozen veggies, instead i used 1 yellow squash, 1 zucchini, 1/2 red bell pepper & 1/4 yellow onion. I used garlic salt instead of regular table salt. I also added a tsp of oregano! It was really simple and turned out delicious. I will make it again with my given modifications.

Make sure if your vegs are frozen that you pour off the excess water, i cooked mine on low broil for 10 then hi for 10 and added parmesan and 2 more mins in. Family loved it, but i too thought it was a little bland. Will try again and add to it.

I used 1/2 tsp of Italian seasoning as other users suggested. I suggest using Pictsweet seasoned spring vegetables because it adds more flavor than regular frozen veggies. This dish was simple and delicious. I got requests to make again.The only other recommendation I have would be to let the dish cool a little before serving because of the broiling. Will definitely make again!
