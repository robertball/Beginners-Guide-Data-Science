This quick, easy and healthy salad is packed with fresh flavor. I highly recommend trying this great recipe. I made two minor changes. I reduced the amount of olive oil to one tablespoon and did not add cumin. Wonderful!

This salad was fantastic! Rinsing the beans in a strainer under running water prevents the "goopy" problem another reviewer had mentioned.

This recipe is FABULOUS! I made it without the oil and used canned diced tomatoes (drained) instead of fresh tomatoes. Also used more parsley (about half of a full bunch - a cup or more).

Do not reduce the olive oil or increase the lemon juice. Safad's vinaigrette is perfect. Just whisk the garlic, olive oil and lemon juice in a separate bowl and pour over the chopped ingredients. Do not use canned tomatoes or mushrooms in this salad. They will introduce textural problems. And don't leave out the cumin. It adds a nice note to the flavor profile. This is an excellent recipe!

I found this to be good, although my husband didn't care too much for the dressing- too much lemon.

This recipe is 5+. You should go to an egyptian/mediterrainian store to get the canned fava beans. Buy the small ones. Awesome!

Sorry, maybe we're just not fans of fava beans.  When I opened the can of favas, I saw that they had this thick goop all over them. I tried to wash it off but it wouldn't   rinse away.  So when I put everything together, it was still thick and goopy. Maybe that's just how favas are; I don't know. We liked the rest of the stuff.

Paired this with " Asian Orange Chicken" on this site. Lovely way to prepare fava beans. I used freshly cooked favas for this recipe.

Amazingly simple. Will add one more lemon next time. Good way to use up all the random canned favas I have in my basement. Thanks!

excellent salad and very filling...made the mistake of using the large fava beans, will use the small ones next time. This was a great lunchtime salad with just the right amount of dressing for me.  Thanks for sharing!

I didn't really taste eat because I made it at night but my dad seem to like it A lot! I didn't add cumin and I used 1 and 1/2 olive oil and a little bit more lemon cause I love lemon. I don't know whether (the reason for my dad liking) he was hungry or he liked it, maybe both. Whatever it was, he ate the rest of it ( which was 90 % of the salad) ; )

I did not make this for me.  Thus, I did not eat any of it.  I made it for my husband, and he loved it!  Thank you so much for such an easy recipe that is a husband-pleaser, too!

The salad part was great. I found the beans really tough. Next time, I'll simmer the beans for an hour or three.

I used fresh fava beans from the garden.  This was a good salad, but not memorable.
