LOVE this recipe! I like to make mine with 1/3 cup of oatmeal to give it texture and protein.   Add a few coffee beans to make a mocha-choco-peanut wake-up smoothie. Yummm!!! Thanks for submitting this recipe! :)

This was yummy. The flavor reminded me of a peanut butter cup. The texture though was a little icy. I have an almost similar recipe I found on Pinterest using whole milk, regular sugar, and non-fat dry milk powder. I actually like this one better, made lighter and with the peanut butter. I did make a few small changes. I halved the recipe and got 1 large serving. I do not care for whey protein powder, in any flavor, so I subbed vanilla slim fast powder. It is a little sweeter. I added the optional Stevia and didn't bother with the 1 Tblsp of heavy cream because I didn't have it. That small amount in any smoothie or drink is barely detectable, anyhow, from my experience.

I printed this recipe yesterday, stopped at the grocery store to get a few ingredients, in the POURING rain----it was sooooo worth it!!! I made the smoothies as soon as I got home!!! I used unsweetened almond vanilla milk and left out the vanilla extract. My girls and I found this recipe to be filling and they were up early this morning putting their own spin on it-like adding half a banana! I started a high protein low-carb lifestyle 2 years ago. I'm thankful to have come across this recipe for a low-carb smoothie that tastes great and my family enjoys as much as I do!

I found a quick and easy way to do this. I used a Milk Chocolate flavored Atkins drink in place of the milk and cocoa powder and it was fantastic! I didn't have heavy cream so I used lite cool whip. I will try the heavy cream next time though 'cause I picked some up today! (I also forgot the vanilla - didn't matter, was still delicious!)

Made this exactly as written...including 2 packs of stevia. I was a bit disapponted, especially from all the great reviews (Makes it hard when most people make their own adjustments/changes and then rate) Anyway, I was very excited to try this, so at first taste I was surprised at how bland it was. Because I didnt want to throw it out, I added another stevia packet and that helped a little, so I added one more (4 total) and added more vanilla extract (1 tsp) total and that was better. I will probably make again but will continue to use more Sweetner to make more tasty.

This was icy and refreshing. I skipped the protein powder, used sugar free French Vanilla creamer instead of heavy cream and unsweetened vanilla almond milk. I will make again.

Average.  The PB taste was very subtle. I prefer my shakes a bit creamier- next time I will had half a banana per serving.  I did sub greek yogurt for the heavy cream and omitted the stevia as my protein powder has stevia in it already.

This is great! So refreshing. I only have sweetened vanilla almond milk so I didn't use the sugar or vanilla. I used french vanilla coffee creamer for the heavy cream. I added a frozen banana and just eyeballed the peanut butter since I don't like it heavily pb*ery. Thanks for the recipe!

I'm a huge sugar /carb/treat addict and I recently started doing the low carb thing. first of all, it totally works, my cravings for bread and rice and everything has gone down, but sometimes late at night I still crave treat food.. I made this and it was incredible. I used salted caramel flavored protien powder and didn't put in the vanilla extract but aside from that I didn't change anything.. just halved the serving. it tasted like birthday cake peanut butter chocolate heaven.. like a shake. I can't recommend this enough.

I am a huge chocolate and peanut butter fan and recently started the low carb lifestyle. I made this as written, omitting the vanilla extract and using honey roasted skippy which has 6 carbs per 2 T. It came out better than the Atkins  chocolate peanut butter bars which I thought were inedible. It does taste a little diety but I found it to be an adequate substitute for a chocolate peanut butter fix while still staying low carb

Delicious!  It's like having a milkshake but with a ton less calories. I made this according to the recipe, using my ninja blender; came out pretty smooth and any small ice pieces melted or were unnoticeable.

The flavor balance between chocolate and peanut butter is great. I didn't have whey protein powder, so I added a bit of vanilla extract, and I used maple syrup in place of the stevia.  It was a little watery without the protein powder, but still a nice treat.  I am sure as written it would have been even better.

I just started my 19 year old son on a low carb diet and as you can imagine, there are times when it’s tough for him. Tonight, he asked for dessert and wanted to get some ice cream, but I suggested we try a low carb smoothie instead. I found this recipe, and luckily, had all the ingredients on hand.
I forgot to add the cocoa powder (I have cacao powder, actually), but this tasted amazing!! I used organic coconut sugar instead of Stevia, and it worked really well!

I have made this several times. A couple of times I added some bananas pieces and strawberries. If you add those ingredients  you don't need the stevia.

I did not make any changes to the recipe, although, I did use approximate measurements for the ice and peanut butter. I found that the smoothie was chunky and wouldn't blend together no matter what. The smoothie was tasteless as well and had an extremely bitter chocolate flavor.

I love this shake.  I also add a serving of frozen spinach to it.  Granted it looks kind of gross but you can't taste the spinach at all and you get a veggie serving in which if you are like me, you can always use.

I wanted to try this right away so I used ingredients I had on hand.  Apologies ahead of time of that offends anyone.  I used "real" salted caramel peanut butter and peanut butter flavored protein powder.  Yes, I do love peanut butter in case you were wondering.  I thought the cocoa powder (chocolate)  was the more prominent flavor I got but I thought it was delicious.  And yes, I would make it again........in fact I did.

I love this recipe. So yummy! I made a few small adjustments. I used PB 2 instead of peanut butter, vi shape nutritional shake mix (2 scoops), vi shape chocolate flavor packet in place of the cocoa, and used sugar free vanilla syrup (torani) in place of the vanilla extract since I didn't have any on hand. I only used one stevia packet and it was sweet enough. It was so good! Tastes like an ice cream slushie. I 100% recommend this to others doing keto like me, or who just want a delicious protein shake.

I love this recipe. I did not use the sugar substitute but it made no difference to the wonderful taste of the smoothie.

My kids are asking for this protein shake for breakfast every day now. They love it! I use powered peanut butter simply because it's less mess, and sometimes add half a banana.

Since I'm allergic to dairy, don't like bananas, and currently, am VERY low carb, this is perfect.  I used all almond milk, so it wasn't as thick or creamy, but it covered my top two priorities.  It tastes delicious and is guilt free.  Thank you!

This is a good, quick breakfast option. My 4yo loves it too. I don't have a blender, but a stick blender works great.

I made this as written without the stevia and would make it again. It's very filling and a healthy alternative for a snack or treat.

O.M.G. Amazing! I used chocolate whey protein powder instead of vanilla. This turned out great! I put about 3 tbs of peanut butter in to enhance the taste. Oh yum yum!

So delicious! I substituted honey for Stevia and used half a cup of almond milk and half a cup of 1% milk. I also used hemp powder instead of whey protein powder. I highly recommend making this!

Only change I made was to use local honey instead of stevia (1 tbsp) and also halved it for a single serving. It seriously tastes like a chocolate peanut butter milkshake. Amazing. I will be having these smoothies regularly. Thank you for the recipe! YUM.
