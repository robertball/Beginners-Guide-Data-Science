I followed the recipe exactly.  While waiting for it to cool down, after about 5 minutes I smelt it burning.  I looked into the pot and it had turned brown and the bottom of the instant pot was starting to turn black.  The instructions said to give it 10 - 15 minutes.  I'm thinking I should have lifted the pot out of the cooker after 2-3 minutes.  But the instructions said nothing about that.  I am waiting for it to cool all the way so I can taste it.  I hope I can use it, but have my doubts.

Just tasted it!  Mmmmm good.  It taste nutty.  With a little salt it would be wonderful!
