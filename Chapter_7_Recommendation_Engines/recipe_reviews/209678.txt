This was so delicious! I broiled mine and the chicken came out juicy and tender. If you broil it I'd recommend cooking the chicken for 15 minutes and then adding the veggies as they got a little burned. Fantastic recipe!

This dish was wonderful, I added more veggies than called for because I made it for a large get together we were having!  You can vary the veggies to your taste and liking but it was a very good dish!
