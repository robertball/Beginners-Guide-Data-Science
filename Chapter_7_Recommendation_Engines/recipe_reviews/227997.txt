This is one of my favorite ways to oven-roast potatoes. I use my own homemade onion soup mix and sometimes I like to throw in either fresh minced garlic or garlic powder and a little fresh ground pepper. This also works on the grill, just stick your potato mixture inside a foil "packet" and grill for 30 minutes.

So good!  And so easy!  I didn't use two types of potatoes because we wanted both potatoes and carrots roasted, so I subbed the sweet potatoes for carrots.  We put them around a pork loin roast, did them for the time specified and OMG...mouthwateringly (if that's a word) awesome!  Will make again, and although my kids refused to try them, my husband and I ate the entire pan! LOL

This is a nice simple roasted potato recipe.  I used much less EVOO, 2 TBSP and used a packet of Knorr's French Onion Soup mix.  One of the ONLY foods Mr. LTH doesn't care for is sweet potatoes, but he ate them (and even didn't hate them) in this.  I found myself preferring the sweet potato chunks!  THANKS for the recipe, CARAMOMMY!

I have made this recipe more times than I can count! The only difference is that I only use regular potatoes and not sweet potatoes. This is so quick to throw together, and tastes great too! :)

I accidentally put a pack of italian dressing mix in then realized I grabbed the wrong pack.  So what could I do...the deed was done.  I just added onion soup mix to the batch too.  My family went wild.  They said I have to do this again.  So what are we having tonight?  Yep we are having my Uh-Oh Potatoes...go figure

I've been making this for years and it's a family favorite.  I've never used sweet potatoes but may try that next time.  You can easily double or triple the recipe for a crowd.

We really liked this recipe. I used equal parts of white and sweet potatoes. I  used a onion soup mix, from this site, instead of the boxed and less olive oil. I will be making this again but will use a lower temperature as there were some charred bits.

I make these with just straight regular potatoes (red potatoes), about 2 lb.  Have never tried with the sweet potatoes but interested in giving it a try.  I have discovered that if I peel the potatoes before roasting, they tend to fall apart more and leave more of a mess in the pan.  I line the pan with foil to help with clean up.

Like the others have said, this is surprisingly delicious!  I can't wait to make it again.  It is also Vegan so that is a plus for one eater in my family.

I really liked this recipe, as did my whole family. My husband isn't a fan of sweet potatoes, but said this recipe was his favorite way to eat them so far. The only change I made was to add an onion cut into wedges. Next time I will try a homemade onion soup mix to eliminate the msg.

I've made this recipe twice: once "inventing" the onion soup mix I didn't have on hand, and the second time exactly as written. Either way, the recipe was so easy, and so incredibly delicious! It will definitely go into my core recipe rotation.

My husband hates sweet potatoes so I just used russet. Very good flavor but make sure you spray or grease your dish as I didn't and they stuck horribly to mine. Otherwise very good. Will make this again

The recipe is fine except for the temperature and time. I did make the cubes a bit smaller but I did 20 minutes at 450°F and some of it stuck to the pan and burned. I'd rather do a lower temperature.

Tried this recipe tonight.  It was good, but, personally, I think it could have used a second packet of onion soup mix.  I'd totally make this again.

These were delicious!  I made them for Thanksgiving for something different.  I think I might just use sweet potatoes to make them because I liked the flavor better with the sweet potatoes.  Thanks for the recipe!
