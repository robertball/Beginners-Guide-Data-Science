We thought this was great! I have to take issue with TARA1218 though.  Vodka tastes very different then gin so you completely changed the flavor of the marinade.  Of course it wasn't as good, you didn't follow the recipe! I'm sorry but I get so annoyed when I see people make many substitutions to a recipe and then gripe that it was just "okay".

Wow, this is delicious. I was a little nervous because I thought that it smelled a little funky while marinating. But, after it's on the grill and it gets that cooked-outside taste...delish!

I actually made TWO versions, exactly as noted for one steak and another that replaced brandy for gin and bitters for vermouth; making a Brandy-Beef Old Fashion. Hey, I'm from Wisconsin, what do ya want?? Side note: I did pierce the steaks a few times before sticking in the bags overnight. 

Make this recipe, you won't be sorry.

I substituted vodka for the gin, otherwise followed recipe.  My husband, the steak and martini lover, thought it was ok, nothing special.  Raved about the savory garlic marinated steaks so will make that recipe instead.
PS.  I see I was criticized by RELISH for changing one ingredient and still rating the recipe.  I agree when lots of changes are made, it can be frustrating to read negative reviews.  However, I changed one ingredient and since many people like VODKA martinis rather than gin, I thought it might be helpful to some.  Also, leaving reviews is helpful for me to remember what changes I made and what worked/didn't.  Sorry.

This was a very tasty marinade.  We had cut up stew meat (very inexpensive), so I was looking for a marinade to add flavor and tenderize the meat.  I skewerd the beef with onions, peppers, and mushrooms and grilled them, basting the skewers as they cooked.  It was delicious!  I think next time I will try a little more of the "martini" and a little less of the "BBQ sauce" though, as it totally overwhelmed any "martini" taste!  but thanks for a great idea!

I made this marinade for beef skewers and everyone that had them at our party LOVED them.  Wow!  I have to admit the whole time I was preparing it I just wasn't sure about the combination of BBQ with the martini ingredients, but it was a knock out!  I mixed it all in a zipper bag and marinated my large cubes of beef for the skewers overnight.  It was excellent.  Thank you!

This was very good.  I did the steaks on the grill pan.  Next time I will serve in a martini glass with the olives as shown in the picture.

This will blow minds and palates, totally tasty and unique. Upscale with down to earth flavor blasts.  I added side of the lemon zest garlic beans for perfect balance.
