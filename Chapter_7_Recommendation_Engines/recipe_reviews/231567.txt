I made this exactly as directed and I was just loving it.  The beer and garlic cloves were just a perfect extra to a normal corned beef.  The next time I did it I also quartered a large sweet onion and tucked that into the veggies.  I should have taken a photo it was so beautiful.  Leftover veggies in the beer broth were wonderful. It doesn't say to cover it, but I baked mine in a covered ceramic baker.

Made as written and the only thing that didn't work for me is that the carrots turned too mushy for our liking with that much cooking time. I ended up roasting another batch in the oven but they didn't get that good flavor not having been cooked with the corned beef and beer. Next time I will just add them later. This is a great recipe and one I will make again.

This is an easy and delicious dinner party menu.  I put the carrots and potatoes in the last hour.  I liked steaming the cabbage separately.  It didn't disappear in the broth like other recipes.  The meat was tender and sliced easily.  I remember my Mom's corned beef falling apart and melting in my mouth.  Has the type of beef changed over the years?

After reading reviews and also noticing the beer burning off after about 30 minutes I transferred the meat to a covered Dutch oven and added another beer. I added the carrots and potatoes plus an onion during the last 45-60 minutes. Made the cabbage as described.  Have plenty of juice in the Dutch oven for those who want extra cooking juice on their plates. Will make again, but definitely in a covered baking dish. Delish! Thank you for sharing!

I made it as described and did not cover it.  The beer evaporated completely and burned.  Fortunately, I was able to salvage it by putting the beef in a different pan, adding potatoes and carrots and drizzling with olive oil.   Flavor of the beef was good and disaster averted.

I agree with a previous review - the corned beef was chewy and tough.  I did two corned beefs, doubled the beer and spices and made recipe exactly as listed.  I did not cover the meat since the instructions did not specify to, but that may have helped.  The meat was not tender, the carrots were super salty - had to remove them after about 45 minutes or they would have been mush.  I would not recommend this recipe and will not make it again.  I have made the boiled corned beef dinner for years and it always comes out super tender and amazing, as well as perfect flavor and vegetables.  Will stick to the traditional way of cooking St Patrick's Day dinner.

I used a 2 .4lb Hummel Corned Beef that has the spices already in the meat and they recommend using the juices in the package. But I threw out before reading the directions. So I googled corned beef packet spices and added cinnamon, ginger, allspice, and ground clove (did not have whole cloves) with a pinch of salt and black pepper. I used 11 .2 ounces of Guinness Beer and 5 ounces of water. I followed the rest of the directions and highly recommend this recipe. It was delicious and will be my go to St. Patrick's Day Dinner. Thank you!

I made this exactly as instructed and it came out great.  The only issue was it was much saltier than expected.  Next time I make it I will omit the pinch of salt. Otherwise it was perfect,  delicious,  and moist. A big hit for our St. Patrick's day dinner.

Horrible turned out like rubber. I followed the recipe exactly. I did cook two corn beefs but double the beer and spices. Haven't a clue what went wrong.  I did notice some tip at the bottom about tin foil. Was it supposed to be covered?  Never saw that in the recipe. Really disappointing.

OMG!!!  This is the most tender and tasty corned beef I’ve ever made.  I followed the recipe which is quite simple.  I didn’t make the potatoes or cabbage. I added a bag of baby carrots when there was an hour left of baking as I didn’t want mushy carrots like one individual had. I’d surely make this again.

So delicious!  I will never cook corned beef in a slow cooker or on stove top again.  I used water instead of beer and used one crushed garlic clove instead of whole and garlic slivers.  I also added a quartered onion and covered it during baking.  Superb!

This was excellent. I made it over the St. Pats weekend. I had everything on hand. Easy to make, my husband loved it. I like steaming the cabbage separately instead of putting it in the pot. The only change I would make is to add more liquid while cooking. Had a few slices left, so those are in the freezer for a corned beef stew another day.
