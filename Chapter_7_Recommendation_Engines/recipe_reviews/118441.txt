We are still at the breakfast table, got to love the iPad. Love the egg blossom-fixed it for Luanne's birthday. Tried to thaw the phyllo in a hurry in the morning. Don't do this, too much stress. Thaw in the fridge like the directions say. I added crumpled bacon in the bottom of cups with cheddar cheese instead of pram. Topped them with chopped red pepper along with the chopped green oinio, pretty presentation and extra flovor. If you want an not too hard and quite fancy/special breakfast by all means make these egg blossoms.

This was wonderful!  Eggs are the cheapest meal on a tight budget and these make dinner parties still look elegant.  I cooked chorizo sausage (found at any supermarket) and put it in the blossom before the egg.  This was wonderful! A layer of green peppers might also add a mexican zest to this recipe.

This is a nice quick recipe for when you need to use up leftover phyllo dough.  I did not make the salsa for this recipe.  I just made the egg/phyllo portion.  Instead of cutting the phyllo sheets, i folded one sheet into forths for each egg "cup".  I used Pam spray instead of butter.  This is a very easy dish and yet the results are kind of fancy, making it perfect for a brunch or to serve to your overnight guests.

I didn't have everything for this recipe so I decided to make a more american version. Instead of green onion I did paprika, and added some crumbled bacon as well. I definately feel like there needed to be more cheese too, I had very nice parmesan and my husband didn't even know it was in the dish.  Will make again, it was very tasty!

While these made a very nice presentation;  I followed the recipe exact.  using my own salsa. We felt they lacked in taste.  next time, I may try some bacon or ham added.  Thanks for posting a unique idea.

These were wonderful.  Since I'm low carbing, I used low carb tortillas instead of phyllo dough, and tried both ham and sausage on top.  I make 6 at a time, then just warm them for a quick breakfast.  I didn't have time to make the salsa, but will have it tomorrow.  Can't wait.  Thank you!

I made these on a Trip to the Mountains with my In-Laws and these were the Star !! I really was not sure how they would turn out but the were beautiful and delicious. It seemed like a lot of work at first, but  I can see how much easier it will be to make them the more i do it. I was nervous the first time i made them since i am not a great cook, but this recipe hide that fact. I have even been asked for the recipe !!

Easier than I thought, the only change I made was to use gruyere cheese instead of Parmesan. Good breakfast dish with the ability to prep much of it in advance.
