This is a very flavorful recipe and very moist.  I would add this to my turkey anytime.

I made this for our Thanksgiving dinner and thought it was very good.  I wanted to use sausage instead of ground beef, but this actually worked out well with beef since one guest was Muslim and doesn't eat pork.  However, I may try it with sausage in the future.

I used a can of evaporated milk and added a cup of raisins and chopped red delicious apples (which I personally love). I didn't have pickles on hand so I used sweet relish instead (which turned out marvelously). This recipe is delicious throughout the year.
