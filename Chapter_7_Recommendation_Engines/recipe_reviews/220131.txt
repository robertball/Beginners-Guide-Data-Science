Finally made pad thai from scratch and used this recipe. Yum! Turned out great. I halved the recipe since it was only for 1, didn't have tamarind paste so I subbed a little lime juice and fish sauce for the sour. I also didn't have chili paste so I used powder, and I used fresh garlic instead of preferred. I used a gourmet seafood mix and only used mushrooms and snowpeas for the veggies. I loved it. Next time I will make sure to have all the ingredients on hand to give it a more adequate rating. 

Oh, I also only soaked the noodles for 30 minutes in really hot tap water like the directions on the noodle package called for.

Nom is all I need to say! This was super yummy! Make double the amount of sauce though- you'll definitely need it! You could easily substitute different veggies, and I added a little chicken bc my husband insisted on it. Now that I have all of these ingredients in my house, it should be really easy to have PadThai any time I want! Yay! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Yummo!  This is amazing.  I tripled the sauce based on a 1lb package of Thai Rice noodles.  I don't know what tamarind paste is so I just left it out.  It easily fed my family of 6.  Great recipe.

I'm only rating this recipe on the sauce, as that is all I used from it. BUT! The sauce really is AMAZING and better than anything I've had in any restaurant. I used noodles that were already soaked and vacuum packed, so I just needed to add them to the stirfry at the end. I marinated about a pound of sliced chicken in some peanut butter, rice wine (you could use white wine), soy sauce and brown sugar for a few hours. I cooked the chicken first, then added sliced carrots and onions for a few minutes, then added bean sprouts and water chestnuts. I pushed everything to one side of my wok and scrambled an egg. Then I tossed in the noodles and the sauce (which I cooked according to this recipe), removed the wok from the stove, and continued to toss until everything was combined. I topped with chopped peanuts, sliced green onions and lime. YUM! Thank you so much for this incredible sauce recipe.

We really liked this!  I'm guessing if I'd followed the directions exactly it would have been even better, but I realized after I started that I didn't have cilantro or water chestnuts.  I also used chicken broth rather than vegetable.

Really good! It requires a lot of ingredients though but I even found the tamarind paste at my local Indian grocery store. I didn't know what to expect when I tasted it, but the finished product was really good. Kind of hot though, but perhaps I used too much chili pasted. I added  an extra two teaspoons of PB and 4 pinches of brown sugar to the finished product.  It is pretty authentic. When I make it again I'm going to try to find a way to reduce the oil. I omitted the oil  when sauteing the veggies and used water instead.

Delicious.  Added another 1-2 tbsp of brown sugar at the end, as I like my pad thai on the sweet side.  Next time I may scramble in an egg for some extra protein.

This recipe is a staple in house. It's fast, easy to personalize and everyone loves it! One alteration I use is more peanut butter and red pepper flakes.

This was so good!  I didn't have the tamarind paste, but don't think it really needed it.  I added chicken tenders, tripled the sauce, increased the peanut butter to 1/4 cup, and added some coconut milk. But it would have been good without the changes.  My husband said I need to make this at least once a month!  No more expensive take out from the local Thai Restaurant.

This didn't really taste like Pad Thai.  However, it was yummy and it's possible i messed something up.  I will give it another try.  I agree with others that you should make more sauce.

Not enough sauce, does not coat the noodles, not the pad thai taste that I personally like, but might be good to others. Not nearly enough flavor.

bf loved this and unfortunately i didn't care for it and i can't pinpoint why.. other than leaving out the tamarind paste i followed the recipe to a T.. i loved the crunchy veggies but felt the sauce just tasted spicy/hot not really flavorful.. bf said this is how the pad thai tastes at the restaurants he's been to.. he said maybe i missed there being a protein in it.. but in my opinion i just didn't care for the flavor

The baby corn, zucchini and carrots were a few extras that I didn't feel were needed.  I didn't hate it or dislike the taste, I just won't be making it again.

This is a wonderfully complex dish, and so easy to make!  While everyone has a favorite Pad Thai, you should give this a try.  If you don't have the prep time for the noodles, just place the dry noodles  in boiling water for two minutes.  After that, put them in a bowl with water and ice to stop the cooking process.   The depth of favors and textures you get get for 30 minutes of time is surprising!

This was so yummy and versatile! I left out water chestnuts but added tofu. I only wish I had doubled the sauce!
