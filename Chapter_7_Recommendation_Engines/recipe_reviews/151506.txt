Used the recipe as a base to cook wings, didn't have apricot so I skipped the sauce all together but cooked the wings with the cooking spray and mixure.  I thought spraying them again seemed odd but did it anyway, and it was great.  We loved them, juicy and perfectly cooked.  Wish I had a baking rack though, I think that would make them crispier and seem more like fried. love!

I liked this recipe very much, but as usual I added my flair.  I don't like hot (spicy) food so I chose to add only 1/8 of teaspoon.  I should of added the 1/4.  My wings were swimming a little, I would have like them to be a little less wet. I will make them again.

This is an ok recipe. I would recommend that you season the wings before breading. Use a quality chip not store brand. Do not put more than 10 wings in a pan or you will have an oven cleanup.

LOVE this recipe. My kids loved it to. Nice flavour and change compared to regular roast chicken. I did chicken wings first time and then chicken pieces as well! I seasoned the chicken a little before adding the marinade.

I make this for the kids in our family.  I actually have to ration it out they love them so much and fend off the adults, because they love them too.

Not a fan - these were not crispy and burned very easily.

I made thie recipe using applesauce because my son is allergic to apricots.  It came out great.  And he almost ate them all.  We love the glaze so much, we've used it on turkey wings and pork chops.

This is THE best recipe I've found for crispy baked chicken wings. I had my own marinade but the cook time was spot on, perfect perfect perfect!
