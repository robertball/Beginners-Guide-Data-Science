YUM!!!  I've been making pie after pie tweaking things here and there trying to get it perfect. THIS IS IT!!!  I used "regular" light brown sugar, added nutmeg, extra cinnamon and a dash of vanilla extract.  I cheated and used a premade piecrust (pillsbury) but adding the sugar on top really made a differance.  This really is the best apple pie i've ever eaten, let along made.  Oh yes...i also pre-cooked the apples and mix on the stove before putting them in the pie.  Thank you Aunt Carol!!!

I have not made an apple pie in years but decided to do so today because I wanted to use up some McIntosh apples before they went bad.  I previously used my mother's apple pie recipe, which wasn't great (not an Italian specialty-smile). OMG!!!  When I cut into this pie, I couldn't believe it!  Could not believe that I made this pie!  I used the Pillsbury Refrigerated Rolled Pie Crust (delicious) and followed the recipe to a near "t" with the following changes: I added 1/2 tsp of fresh grated nutmeg and 1 tsp of vanilla to the apple mixture, I baked the pie at 450 degrees for 15 minutes then 350 degrees for 55 minutes.  Pie came out PERFECTLY!!!!  Not too sweet, not gooey, not too wet or too dry, perfect mixture of sweet and spicy, tender & tasty apples, perfect crust!  Absolutely wonderful!  Can't wait for my dear husband to taste this tonight!  Will definitely be making this pie again and again and again!!!

This is the best apple pie recipe. I have even forgotten to add the cinn. one time and it still turned out great. I use pillsbury rolled crust and I love adding the sugar to the top, it really makes the crust taste wonderful.(I usually don't eat the crust but I love this one) The only thing I do differently is I set the oven to 425 and cook for about 12 min at the beginning instead of the 450 for 15 min. The crust turns out purfect every time. Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe.

I have been making this pie according to Aunt Carol for 9 years or so and I thought it's about time to give it a rating.  I have been able to make excellent pie dough for many years, but the apple filling in this pie is the very best.  My brother-in-law has cautioned me so many times about arriving to their home without an apple pie and risking being locked out of the house.  ;o)  I will continue to make this recipe as written and I thank Jo Ann Taylor and Aunt Carol for it.

I use 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I usually sprinkle white sugar on the top crust rather than brown. Depending on how juicy the apples are 1/2 cup flour might be just right or it could be a bit much, but I hate a watery pie, so I normally do use that much flour just to be sure. It is better to determine doneness by whether the juices have started to boil instead of the crust color. If it isn't boiling yet and the crust is getting too brown, put foil strips over the edges.

OMG! E-Z, perfectly delicious pie! As another suggested, I set the oven to 425 and cook for about 12 min at the beginning (instead of the 450 for 15 min.) Then 350 for 45 min as written, the crust was perfect, no burning. I also used 1/2 the brown sugar because I thought it would be too sweet. I also added the juice of 1 lemon.  It turns out either way, would have been fine. It's a GREAT recipe, thanks Aunt Carol.

This is a great recipe.  It bakes up just nicely and the sugared top crust is just extra yummy.  I was looking for a great apple pie recipe and I found it!

beautiful presentation with the sugar on the crust, however, really gooey and sweet inside.  apples stayed semi-crisp and was balanced by the very very sweet filling. it's good, but was too "wet" for me.

Great recipe, thanks for posting.  I added vanilla and nutmeg like a few reviewers suggested.  We ate it while still warm so it was pretty sloppy bit delicious anyway.  I hope tomorrow it's set up more.

My daughter made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was the first time she ever made a pie.  It was absolutely delicious and she did a perfect job.  It came out so gorgeous, we all took pictures.  There wasn't one crumb left.  sAn easy, great tasting recipe.

My first apple pie!  I used 3 Granny Smith and 5 McIntosh, 3/4c white sugar, and 1/4 brown and it had just the right sweetness.  Follow the recipe if using all Granny since they are so tart.  The McIntosh gave it a little natural sweetness, and since they are very firm, did not get mushy.  This is my go to apple pie recipe!  Can't wait to make for Thanksgiving.  I also used the Good Housekeeping pie crust recipe--it is very easy!

This pie was delicious! I substituted Spectrum organic shortening (0 trans fat) in the crust. I used light brown sugar as I couldn't find the brown sugar specified in the recipe. But it came out perfectly. It didn't overflow into the oven either. I also brushed egg white on the top crust, then sprinkled with sugar.

This pie was the first pie I ever made. I used Pillsbury 9 inch pie crusts and made a lattice top. This pie was so delicious!!! At first I couldn't figure out how to stir the apples and sugars and flour together. There was just so much powder that wouldn't stop being powdery. I figured out that actually tossing the apples around to get the moist cinnamony moist filling. This pie was just so delicious. My family can't stop raving about it.

This was the very first apple pie I ever made (pretty sad for 27!) and it turned out AMAZING! So easy and good, awesome appearance- I did the lattice top and sprinkled sugar on that.  I used Ida Red apples (was trying to get rid of them) and they were great.  Cooking time came our perfect.  I even took a picture and posted it on facebook and eveeryone  was VERY impressed :) It was sweet, but I liked it that way. Great ala mode.

I took this to a bbq and it was devoured in a snap!! Everyone loved it and I will be sure to make this again! The only changes I made were that I used Braeburn apples (I don't like granny smith apples) and as per other reviews I only used 1/2 the amount of cinnamon called for. The sugar crust was everyone's favorite. thanks for an awesome recipe!

Every one in my entire family loves it. It has been compared to the legendary family GRANDMA'S Apple pie. It is actually requested for family gatherings. Great job.

This is my very first apple pie, i even made my crust from scratch. My husband loved it, he even took a little to work with him.
Thank you. I was really proud of myself.

I LOVED this pie, so did my husband and he is very picky about his apple pie.  I ended up using 8 cups of apples sliced about 1/8 inch thick.  It was wonderful!  Not too sweet, set up nicely, just perfect, thanks so much!

One of the best apple pie recipes I have ever made!! I also used to Pillsbury pre-made pie crusts but with the sugar on top you really couldn't tell. I added a little more cinnamon than the recipe called for and about a tablespoon of lemon juice and it turned out amazing. My boyfriend said it was the best he had ever tasted. Him and his friend ate the whole pie in one night!

This is the best apple pie I've ever eaten. I'm a novice baker in general, and this is the first pie I've ever made from scratch (not including the refrigerated pie crust), but the recipe was simple, easy, and turned out amazingly good even for me! I followed the recipe exactly as written and the filling was thick and had the perfect amount of sugar, not too sweet. It didn't take too long to make especially with using a mandolin to slice the apples. I will never buy a premade apple pie at the supermarket ever again, I'd rather make this recipe myself.

This rating is for the filling only.  It was fine, but definitely not the "10" I am looking for.  Seemed awfully pasty and a little flat.  It's GOOD, don't get me wrong, but not FABULOUS, and that's what I am looking for.

The crust came out excellent and I will bake it this way next time.  However, too much sugar for me and I thought there was too much flour.  It wasn't juicy due to all the flour.  I'd cut down on brown sugar and probably white sugar.  Crust was Excellent though!

Fantastic Pie!  Best I've ever eaten.  I used macintosh apples, and cut the white sugar down to 1/2 cup.  Used the never fail pie crust II recipe from  this site.  I baked it maybe 10-15 mins longer than stated - I like my apples soft - and it was amazing!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I'm not a huge fruit pie fan, but my boyfriend says this one deserves 5 stars.  I used Jonathan apples, half the amount of white sugar and made my own crust using Veggie Pie Crust on this site. I made a lattice design on top with some stars to make it fancy looking.  I loved eating the few leftover apples that didn't fit in the pie that were smothered in cinnamon & sugar!

This pie was a breeze to make.  I used refrigerated pie crusts and apples of "unknown species".  My brother got them from someone he knows.  They were smallish, red and yellow, frangrant, and slightly mealy textured rather than hard and woody like a Delicious would be.  He just told me they were "cooking apples".  The sauce for this pie is abundant, almost too loose but that's easily remedied next time around.   The point is that this is good enough that there WILL be a next time around!  Flavor is excellent!  Thanks for a very nice recipe that anyone could master.  ~ My photo of this recipe is # 11~

Delicious pie!
My only change was letting the cut and coated apples drain in a colander for about 45 minutes.  That let the excess fluid drain off some before loading the crust with he fruit.  Which made the second attempt much less runny & it set up much better than my 1st.  Thanks!

this pie was okay.  I only gave it 2 stars because it was SO sweet.  I don't like my apple pie that sweet.  I wish I had thought to cut down on the amount of sugar but since the reviews were so good I stuck to the recipe.  I used a variety of different apples (we had gone apple picking) so maybe they were sweeter as well so less sugar could have been used.  Eh...I won't make this pie again.

Amazingly good recipe. I recently lost the recipe for apple pie that I have been using for years, and was looking for a new one. This is now my new apple pie recipe! I was hurried, the kids were running around and getting in the way, and I forgot the cinnamon but it was still amazing! Thanks for sharing this one, I appreciate it.

Excellent recipe for traditional apple pie.  I added about 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg with the cinnamon.  I added a bit less flour than called for and it was plenty - not runny at all.  I got my apples at the farmers market and based on the recommendation of the apple guy found a fantastic pie apple called "Mutsu".  I will definitely look for them again next time.  They are big and meaty, not too sweet or too tart, just perfect and they bake up really well.  I also threw in a couple Granny Smiths.

I made this for two Fourth of July cookouts - because what's more American than apple pie on the Fourth? I made three pies total all with Pillsbury's pie crust, which really is the best! It turned out very well for two of the pies and was phenomenal for the third pie when I added 1/2 a jar of Smucker's caramel ice cream topping and a package of walnuts. My husband polished it off within 24 hours! The other pies were a hit at both cookouts and now I have requests for more! The hardest part is the peeling and cutting with the apples - you're in the home stretch after that! Five star recipe.

I didnt like this pie because it was too gooey and too dark. I found that if you use this recipe you should only use about 1 1/2 Tbs. of flour and 1 Tbs. of cinnamon. It came out alot better.

I've made this several times and it is such a great pie.  I use 1 cup splenda instead of sugar.  No one can tell.

This was excellent! It is somewhat healthier than the Grandma Ople apple pie (much less butter) but still forms a delicious syrup in the pie filling. The only modification I made to the recipe was to add a splash of vanilla. I made it with the "Pie Crust IV" recipe on this site.

This was pie delicious! I tried a crust that was also on this site which was a flop so next time I'll save myself the headache and buy Marie Callendar's frozen ones...this was an awesome apple pie.  I think it beat out the boyfriend's auntie's pie that he loves!

The results were great!  I had a dinner for 6 last evening and this pie was a winner.  Just a comment, that I think the times need adjusting for preparation (5 min?),cook time (10 min?), and ready in (15?).  Thanks for this great apple pie recipe!

Simple but excellent recipe.  I like to use less sugar in apple pies so I used red delicious and only 1/2 cup sugar.  Thank you Aunt Carol and thank you Pillsbury for the first pre made crusts!

Delicious!!! I absolutely love the flavors of this pie.  I added toasted, chopped pecans and butterscotch caramel sauce.  If you do this too, I would suggest to decrease the sugar just a little.  Thanks for a great recipe!

this was pretty good.
next time i will use more tart apples as it was a little on the sweet side.
however, i didn't exactly do it all by the recipe. instead of putting it into a pie crust i put it into some phylo dough.

I made this pie twice in less than 7 days - and had never made an apple pie before, EVER!  I got RAVE reviews of it, and even managed to forget the butter the second time and it still was perfect (and lower in fat!).  I use either frozen or boxed crusts and it makes for a very quick and easy dessert.  A real keeper!  Don't forget the ice cream!

Made with Basic Flaky Pie Crust. Excellent!!! The filling was very quick, easy and quite yummy for a quick apple pie fix. This recipe will go into my recipe box for sure.
Thanks! My husband really liked it too.

Yummy!!  Used red delicious apples because that's what I had. Used regular brown sugar, not the special kind recommended. I will definitely make this again and again. It was a little sweet for me so next time, I will decrease the white sugar in the pie to 3/4 cup. I will leave my apples in big slices too because I like them firm, not soft. Wonderful tasting, very easy recipe!!

Absolutely DELICIOUS!!  I've now made this pie 4 times and it is a hit everytime time!  It makes a BIG,BEAUTIFUL PIE.  If you don't want to make your own crust I buy the refrigerated roll out crusts which I roll out a little bit more.  The final presentation with the sugar topped crust is so eye appealing.  IT TRULY IS THE BEST APPLE PIE!

I LOVED this pie, so did my husband and he is very picky about his apple pie.  I ended up using 8 cups of apples sliced about 1/8 inch thick.  It was wonderful!  Not too sweet, set up nicely, just perfect, thanks so much!

This filling was great!  I've never made an apple pie before, I thought I was going to have to try mulitple recipes to find the perfect one, but this is the first one I tried and i'm not going to try another one.  I used granny smith with a couple of fuji apples thrown in.

Very good. I cooked the apples slightly and strained the juice  before putting in the crust as I don't like too much liquid in pies. The sugar on top of the pie crust worked really well.

Thank you for providing this recipe.  This is the most delicious apple pie I have ever tasted.  The only thing I did differently was reduce the white sugar to 3/4 cup. I did not have free-flowing brown sugar but used golden brown sugar and did what you advised and made sure it was without any clumps or lumps. The baking time was perfect. I used a clear glass dish, probably 10 inches, and used about 8 small/medium apples. After letting the pie cool for about 45 minutes, I gave a slice of this warm pie with vanilla ice cream on the side to my husband.  He didn't say a word - he just kept nodding his head the entire time he was eating it and left no crumb on the plate!  I brushed egg white on the top crust and it baked to a beautiful golden brown.  Wow. I'm thinking of having another piece now!

I made two of these pies and brought one to a church pie auction benefit. It sold for 60$! It looked really pretty with homemade piecrust and latice. It was pretty simple to make and it was totally yummy, especially with the granny smith apples. They really do make the best apple pies because they are very flavorful and stay firm and slightly tart which is a nice compliment to the sweetness.

MAGNIFICENT is the only way to describe this recipe.  This was my first time making apple pie and it came out great.  I forgot to add the extra butter in the filling and to sprinkle the sugar on top.  It still came out great.  My fiance absolutely loved it.  

Oh Yeah.  I used buttermilk instead of water to make the crust and it was perfect.  IF YOU LIKE APPLE PIE, YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS RECIPE!

This was a huge success.  I didn't put the additional butter on top of the apple mixture and it didn't seem to make any difference.

This was my first attempt at apple pie and it turned out great.  Be sure to use Granny Smiths...they are just tart enough. The brown sugar gives the filling a great caramel taste. Enjoy!

Absolutely delicious...would definitely make it again!!  The only thing I did differently was that I brushed the top layer of dough with milk and sprinkled white sugar on the top of the crust rather than brown sugar.  (The milk helps brown the crust)  FYI:  I followed the "French Pastry Pie Crust" recipe off this site.

Good to eat and easy to prepare. I only had two pieces.  The rest was eaten before I could get to it.  A little trouble with the using regular brown sugar on the top.  Burned quite easily.  Probaly better to use regular white on top instead.

This pie turned out really good. I only used about 1 1/2 teaspoons of the cinnamon, because I didn't want it to be overpowering. I also used pink lady apples because they are what I had on hand. I used five apples.  If you love the taste of apple butter then you will love this pie, because to me I think the brown sugar gives it that slightly different flavor. And of course the filling is darker because of it. I used the french pastry pie crust on this website. It was the best pie crust I've ever tasted. Thanks Aunt Carol!

This recipe was GREAT! It was so easy to make and it tasted amazing! I had never made a pie before and I was a little concerned about my pie being runny, so after I sliced up the apples, I tossed them in a little bit of flour to coat them, to ensure that the sugar wouldn't pull too much liquid out of them. I used 7 granny smith and 2 macintosh apples because I figured the granny smith would be nice and tart, and the macintosh would be more juicy. I also lined the crust with tin foil since I don't own a pie shield, and I put a piece of tin foil on the rack directly above the pie so that it had less chance of burning and the color was golden brown. I finished off the lattice with an egg wash and cinnamon sugar. My husband, brother-in-law and I gobbled up big pieces with vanilla ice cream, and everyone loved it. Thank you so much for such an easy and delicious recipe! Aunt Carol will be making an appearance again soon!

This was one of the best pies I have ever had. It was really easy too, I don't think I will buy store pies anymore with this easy recipe! My eleven year old son basically made it with my help, even the lattice crust. It was a big hit at Thanksgiving dinner!

I never made an apple pie before and will never use a different recipe ever again!  I thought my grandmother came down from heaven and baked me her fantastic apple pie!  Fabulous.  I used Freedom apples since I had a bushel.  Other than that I stuck to the recipe and it was absolutely perfect!  THANKS!

Oh, this never makes it more than a day at our house!   lol  Such a wonderful recipe!  The only thing I do differently is add a touch of nutmeg!  And, like alot of the other reviewers, I cut down on the sugar.  Love this!    Thank you Aunt Carol!   :)

Love it -- been making it for years, but never reviewed.   I don't mess with the free-flowing brown sugar; I combine and sift the dry stuff over the apples, stir to coat completely (adding vanilla) and then let set for 15 minutes or so.

I brush my crust with milk (using a pastry brush) and then shake cinnamon sugar over.  Yum!

So yummy. i recommend slicing the apples really thin, just makes them better. also don’t put a ton of water and sugar on the top crust it has to cook wayyy longer to brown if it’s really wet. overall great recipe!

This was sooo delicious.   I followed a couple of minor changes that others have made, (adding Vanilla,  etc...)  but the rest I kept on course of this recipe.   I will definitely be making this again and again!

Great recipe! Super easy! I changed one thing....I melted butter and brushed it on the top if the crust then sprinkled cinnamon sugar on it before putting it in the oven.

WOW!!  This is literally the BEST apple pie I've ever had!!  NO changes needed it's PERFECT!  I tried another apple pie recipe with over ten thousand reviews but this is hands down better!  My 4 year old son and husband also agree that this is MUCH better, yummy!  Feel like I could eat the whole pie at once.

The best apple pie recipe.  Have made it many times.  I use an oil crust rather than shortening, which is thinner and flaky.  Also have used other apples like Jonathan and Melrose.  All are great with this recipe.  I don't try any other now for apple pie.

Other than that stuck to the recipe  and my husband said he has never had a apple pie as good!!

This is my go to recipe!  I use grannies and only a half cup of white sugar.  I find it’s too sweet if you use a full cup.

Would make it just exactly as the recipe says.  Took it to a family reunion and everyone loved it.  I didn't even get a piece!
Used premade pie shells, allowing one to thaw enough to roll and place over the top.

Great apple pie recipe.  I followed the recipe almost to a "T" except I couldn't get to the store for the free flowing brown sugar.  I used regular brown sugar and lightly packed it.  
It was a little bit soupy, but I think it was the type of apple I used and nothing to do with the recipe.  
This will likely become my go to apple pie recipe.  Thank you for sharing Aunt Carol's recipe!

This recipe is excellent! The only change I will make in the future is to reduce the initial 15 minute bake temp to 425 vs 450.

Made this for Thanksgiving this year.  I used Apple pie spice half the sugar and half the flour.  Next time I will use more apples as well.  Other than those tweaks, awesome taste!  The reason for less sugar was due to the reviews.

I have been making a variation of this for years! I prefer gala or Fuji apples and I reduce the sugar a little to compensate for the sweetness from those varieties. Sometimes I change up or add spices such as nutmeg or allspice depending on how I’m feeling that day. My husband loves it as do both of my brothers-in-law. Aside from the turkey I think it’s the most looked forward to item at our Thanksgiving and Christmas gatherings. It was also requested in place of birthday cakes one year!

Anyway this recipe is awesome. We went Apple picking this past weekend and I have made 5 pies in three days. Give them away to my family and got rave reviews from everyone. I made zero adjustments. It’s perfect. The apples made the perfect amount of juice and because of the amount of flour, it sets up beautifully and doesn’t run all over the pan when sliced. My keeper Apple pie recipe from now on. Thanks Aunt Carol, whoever you are :)

This recipe was just a little too sweet for me. That being said, I did use a different variety of apple (gala and fuji). My husband really liked it, though.

This was the best apple pie I have made! I used only Granny Smith apples and 3/4 of a cup of white sugar instead of a whole cup. Delicious and so easy if you use a frozen pie crust!

This was my first apple pie I made ever! I made the pie as a gift for my husband's birthday. I didn't make any changes to the ingredients, but I did heat the ingredients on the stove as reviewer suggested. My husband was impressed with my result ; surprised would probably be a better word. The next day it tasted even better as the ingredients had a chance to "set". The only change I would make is adding a few more apples as they tend to shrink upon cooking. Otherwise this was perfect! Thanks Aunt Carol!!!!

I've made 4 pies using this recipe so far.  First one was as written and everyone gobbled it up.  I prefer more spice, so I added a tablespoon of ginger paste and 1/2 tsp of allspice.  I highly recommend this recipe!  Also, after moistening the top crust, sprinkling turbinado sugar on before baking makes it so pretty!

This is a simple apple pie recipe. I made it as written with the French Pastry crust. It was so delicious that I won our family's annual Thanksgiving pie baking contest one year!

So good. I used a variety of apples that I had on hand. I had no problem at all with it being watery like others mentioned. I also sprinkled the top with a mixture of cinnamon and sugar. It was a fabulous pie. Really good warm with vanilla ice cream.

Amazing. My first ever apple pie & came out better than I ever could have hoped! I used the recipe "Ruth's Grandma's pie crust"  instead of a pre made dough. I also let the apples sit in the mixture in the fridge overnight, but that wasn't intended (I realized too late that I needed to borrow a pie plate) & as a result there was all this sugary syrup at the bottom of the bowl I just threw into the pie...it came out super!

I have not made Apple pie much as we don't typically like the spices ratio used in Apple pie recipes.  However this one is delicious and all my family raved over it.
