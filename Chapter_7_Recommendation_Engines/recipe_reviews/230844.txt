Delicious! Tastes like a creamy artichoke dip. I left mine a little chunky (see photo) so I could use it as a spread or as a dip. I also used about half the amount of lemon, figuring I could add more if I wanted to. Wound up liking it the way it was. I spread this on fresh, homemade bread for a snack today, and will use it to make a sandwich for lunch tomorrow. Great flavor!

This was pretty good! It had a nice lemony tang to it. I made it a day ahead of time to let the flavors blend better.  There was some liquid separation the next day, but I just drained that, or you could stir it back in.  This was tasty on a chicken wrap! EDIT:  The following day I mixed this into some tuna and it make a great tuna sandwich!
