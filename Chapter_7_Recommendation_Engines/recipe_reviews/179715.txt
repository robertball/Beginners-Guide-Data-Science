Very easy to make, and I received compliments.  I didn't roll the pastry out, instead I left it the thickness it was and used the extra to cover the bottom of the pan completely.  I did the same for the top.  The crust was a little tough, but my puff pastry had been in the freezer awhile, so that could be why (or because I didn't make it thinner?).  Instead of the cinnamon and sugar, I think I will drizzle a glaze on it next time.

I used a peach pie filling for a delicious flavor! But the texture of the pastry was a little tough to cut through with the side of a fork.

I am so proud of myself! Usually I am terrible with things like pies etc... I can't make a pretty crust to save me. With this I can! Mine does not look like the picture. Instead, I rolled it up sorta like a strudel/burrito. I rolled the dough out, kept it in a rectangle.  I did not tuck the ends under, instead I pinched them closed using a fork for a print. I also made slits on the top. The cream cheese goo is delish. My embelishments to the recipe was a 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts, a handfull of soaked raisins, and 1 Bosc pear that I sliced thin and sugar spice coated. Mixed it with the canned filling.  I was making 2 of them and did so because I feared running short on filling.  Served with  ice cream and actually leftover filling that I ended up purreeing and heating up. Also, leave the puff pastry a bit cold, it is easier to work with. If I can do this you can!
