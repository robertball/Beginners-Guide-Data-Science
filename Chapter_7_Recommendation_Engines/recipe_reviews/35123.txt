Delicious! I'd never tasted a gooseberry before, and wasn't sure what to expect. My jam turned out great, perfect sweet/tart combo, and such a beautiful color. My family loves it too!

Not having a food mill, I crushed my berries in a food processor on "chop".  Nice texture,  good jam consistency, delicious!

To Cloverdale: I know your post is a year old, but I just wanted to say that, yes, there actually ARE do-overs when it comes to jam that did not set well. You just dump all the jam out of the jars into a jam pot. Bring to a full, rolling boil. Cook for just 30 secs. Remove from heat. Add in more pectin.Add more pectin (I would suggest perhaps the rest of the package?). Stir and skim for 5 minutes. Put back into clean, sterilized jars. 

Note that liquid pectin called for in this recipe and the powder or crystal kind are no interchangeable. The crystal pectin generally calls for less fruit and less sugar for 1 packet than will be called for in a recipe using liquid. Also, double check the size of the pectin. It used to come in 6 ounce bottles, which is what this recipe is referring to. It calls for 1/2 of a 6 ounce bottle or 3 ounces. Today, liquid pectin is usually in 3 ounce pouches, so you would use a full pouch.

If you want to make jelly, you cannot just substitute an equal quantity of juice for the fruit. Jelly making is another whole art and uses different recipes. Usually more sugar and more pectin.

I followed the recipe on the sure jell and used the low sugar kind. My mom has gooseberries and I wanted to use them to see how they tasted. I enjoy them on the bush but had never cooked with them. I didn't like the jelly. My mom and dad love the jelly. I guess it's up to your taste buds! I also didn't use the skin or seeds. I put them in a juicer and only used the juice. It is a very pretty color.

Good flavor, but you may want to add more pectin.  I had fantastic gooseberries, but this recipe produced a runny product.  Unfortunately, there are no "do-overs" when making jam.

I didn't have enough goose berries so mixed in red currents. Cut back on the sugar and didn't use any pectin. It took a lot longer to thicken but it was awesome. After the first taste a second flavor came out â€¦ awesome on toast, crackers and ice cream.
