I LOVE Mexican food - all the flavors - and I'm always looking for a way to make it more healthy, so I was intrigued when I read this recipe.  I followed the suggestion of cutting the chicken into strips and pan frying in a little bit of olive oil (instead of baking), mainly because I was hungry and didn't want to wait a half hour :) After it was lightly cooked thru, I also added a half a packet of hot taco seasoning (my husband and I like a little spice) and put in a little salsa in the skillet at the end after the chicken was browned to add a a little more moisture.  (skipping the tomato sauce entirely)  I used a salad base comprised of some baby spinach, leafy greens and fresh herbs, adding more fresh cilantro to it.  I also added some diced onions and a half of a diced fresh tomato.  After topping the salad with the chicken I topped with a little (jar) salsa, the black beans, sliced avocado and a sprinkling of 2% shredded cheese.  I think adding sour cream would have (for me) spoiled this light, tasty and refreshing meal.  It is great and I'll make it again for sure.  So easy!

Instead of baking the chicken, I cut it into strips and cooked it on the stovetop with just a little bit of olive oil until no longer pink, then stirred in half a pack of taco seasoning mix till the chicken was browned. To the salad, I added diced red onion and fresh cilantro. For the salsa, I used fresh pico de gallo- next time I will use more than 1/2 cup.
Light and refreshing!

I cooked the chicken by boiling it (I needed chicken for 2 recipes) I put the chicken, tomato sauce, home make taco seasoning, and black beans into a skilled and then I added a can of corn.  I just heated it all up, put it over spinach and served with sour cream and chips.  My family loved it. I forgot to use cheese and salsa, but I bet it would have been even better.

This is ok as written. Nothing special. Could use some tomatoes, cilantro, onion. Way too much sodium in this to be considered healthy eating. This contains a few days worth of sodium. To make it with less sodium, make your own taco seasoning, leaving out the salt and use low sodium beans.
Frying the chicken even in olive oil does nothing to make the recipe any healthier. Has too many carbs for those trying to watch that part of their diet.
It is tasty, of course, as written, just not healthy.

I took the suggestions and added fresh cilantro to the sauce. Choose pico de gallo rather than salsa. I think the taco seasoning & tomato sauce was a bit much and would probably cut back next time.

My family enjoyed this dish tonight.  I used leftover chicken, heated it up on the stove with the tomato sauce and taco seasoning.  We tossed the chicken with all the additional ingredients, not really measuring anything.  We all added in black olives, my husband also added tobasco and ranch dressing to his.  We all really liked this salad!  A healthy, yummy dinner!

This salad is good with my additional changes. I cooked the sliced chicken on the store top with diced onion and minced garlic. When the chicken was almost done I added 1-14oz.can diced tomatos along with the toco mix. I also added 1/2 package frozen corn--heated through and dressed it with toppings. I served it on crispy romaine----yumie !!!!

Great healthy dinner.  I cooked the chicken in the convection oven for 40 minutes and came out very moist.

This recipe is a good start. I added corn, cilantro and green onions to ours. It was surprising good on a bed of spinache. I would usually put it on top of tortilla chips.

Loved this.  Cut the chicken in strips and put in a bowl with taco seasoning/tomato sauce mixture...Then I cooked that over the stove. This really hit the spot.  Thanks!

I made this for dinner a week ago and my teenage son LOVED it.  I served it over rice and added a little sour cream on top before serving.  I used tomato paste instead of sauce and diluted the paste and taco mix until the consistency was good.  Delicious. Easy to make after a hard day at work.  Will make it again!!

This chicken was so good and easy to make. My husband is picky and doesn’t really like to try new things, but he loved this recipe. Forgot all about the sour cream but this recipe is so good you really don’t need it. Thanks!

This was so good and easy! I didn't find this too salty at all. I did make my own taco seasoning, but I did use salt. I used low sodium tomato sauce, as suggested, and I rinsed my black beans. I added some sauteed onion and peppers and some cilantro would've been good. Very easy and delicious!

Really liked this salad. It was very easy to make an very filling. I easily fed four people with this recipe. I did use the recipe MEXICAN RICE II that is on this site for a side-though my dad and brother added it directly to their salad. Also, I combined the black beans and salsa (used a bit more than recipe called for just cuz I like it) and microwaved them.

Okay so I love Mexican food!!  If you are afraid of the fat from the tortilla chips or even the taco shells...this is the lean side.  Although the we are not fans of the black beans, we substatuted a can of whole kernal corn.  If you are not sure about using the chicken in this you can replace it for ground turkey.  This recipe was overall the best Mexican makeover lean style.

This was a huge hit with the family. I added a small can of Mexican Corn to the meal. I decided to mix the black beans and corn in a bowl and microwave for a minute. I used a chunky salsa instead of a traditional salsa dip (I found it next to the chip dip in the fridge area of the store). I used mild everything, which was fine with the family, but I sprinkled chili powder on mine to spice it up a bit. I also cubed up the chicken on the salad. I love these types of recipes where you can personalize them up like this.

This was really good.  I did pan fry chicken strips added garlic, 1/2 a pkg taco seasoning and about 1/4 salsa.  I warmed up the beans in the micro and served with all the toppings.  it was light and perfect.

This recipe was super tasty and filling! I definitely will be making it again.

My variation is below:
I cut out the sour cream, and will cut out the cheese next time(it didn't need it), added fresh cilantro to the sauce, added a fresh roma tomato and used home made taco seasoning sans salt(I used homemade taco seasoning (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/taco-seasoning-i)

Excellent!  The only change I made was to cook my own black beans, rather than use canned.  My husband said it was the best Mexican type salad I'd ever fixed.

Love this recipe. I've made it several times. This time I prepared it in a large skillet and browned the chicken breasts on each side, then added the tomato sauce and taco seasoning (both low sodium) and also added the black beans to the skillet and towards the end threw in the spinach.

I'm sure this recipe is delicious as written, but I didn't have any taco spices when I started to make it, so I improvised using rebel angels spices (from this site) and salsa instead of the tomato sauce. Also added about 1/4 c fresh cut up cilantro, a can of corn and a can of kidney beans drained & rinsed. It was very good and it made a 1 dish summer meal.

My wife loved this recipe and said that it puts her taco salad recipe to shame.  Secretly, I had to agree.  This is remarkably simple to make, but you wouldn't know it from the taste.

I cheated on this big time.  I used a rotisserie turkey breast (diced), cooked frozen spinach, and added diced jalapenos from a jar.  Mix it all together in a bowl with 2x sour cream and 2x cheese and my special homemade taco seasoning.  Diet, shmiet.  It's pretty darn good.

This was fantastic, and SO simple! It was also very healthy - people who are worried about sodium can just use low or no sodium ingredients (I did). I added diced red and green pepper and chopped cilantro - it made the dish perfect. It was also amazing how the presentation came out when you piled up the ingredients - looked like it came right out of a food magazine!

Excellent recipe!  I did cut the breast up in slices so it would cook faster.  The taco seasoning was chicken taco seasoning.
I didn’t have spinach so I used the variety spring mix and added some ice burg.
It was all so delicious we ate every last bite.

Great salad and liked using the spinach leaves instead of nachos chips. Cut chicken in bite sizes pieces and cooked in a skillet then drained and added taco seasoning.  I like finding more chicken recipes and this is another easy and good one.

My family absolutely loved this recipe.  The only thing I changed was that I made the tomato sauce rather than use the canned variety.  It takes few ingredients, is easy to make but packs a huge taste punch.  I'll be making this again.

Completely changed this recipe when I realized I didn't have any fresh spinach on hand and didn't feel like making *yet* another grocery run. --> But WOW! I couldn't believe how wonderful the results were, or how easy it would be to replicate in the future. First, since I had to give up on the salad idea, I decided to turn this into a more traditional hot entree. And I prefer my black beans heated through, so well, throw that can of black beans (*UN*drained) into the bowl with the can of tomato sauce  and the packet of taco seasoning (per the recipe)and mix it all up. Next, preheat the oven per the recipe instructions, lightly grease a baking dish, position the chicken breasts in the dish and cover with the tomato sauce, black bean and taco seasoning mixture. Cook per recipe instructions. In the last five or so of the cooking time, I topped the chicken with some crushed-up stale taco shells and about a cup of mild cheddar cheese, which melted attractively on top.  Served it with a box of Spanish rice mix and a microwave-in-the-bag vegetable. There! Dinner's all ready and you hardly even have a dish to wash. Oh, and did I mention that the chicken was so tasty and moist and flavorful that I felt like I'd just hit the jackpot? Yeah, I did.  Sadly, I was so excited about the outcome that I totally forgot to take a picture until I'd finished eating it.  Hey, that's a good excuse to make this one again, isn't it?!

Absolutely delicious!  And very little prep for a very wonderful  taste.  I made the recipe exactly as originally written, except that I added cumin to the sauce and fresh cilantro as a garnish!
Thanks for a delicious Mexican Chicken and Black Bean salad that I plan to make again and again!

One of the best entrees I have ever made, but I do love Mexican food.  The combination of spinach, black beans and the cheese made it a delight.  I will certainly be making it again.

It was delicious even though I substituted black-eyed peas for black beans and minus the sour cream to keep it a low-fat dish.

I added onion, salt and pepper. I may try crushed red pepper on a individual plate. I really like this simple recipe.

The sauce that the chicken was cooked in is fantastic and simple.   I served over a spinach blend.  Fast and easy if you cook the chicken ahead.
