I would reduce the lemon juice just a tad, it overpowered the flavor of the dressing at first. Perfect for a dinner for 3, with 2 servings left over.

This recipe is fantastic!! I made this for my family and they couldn't stop eating it or raving about it! I made no changes to the recipe other than adding a slight amount of brown sugar to bacon prior to baking it to give it a candied flavor. I also skipped the croutons because I forgot to buy the bread on my shopping run. This will definitely be one of my go to recipes!
