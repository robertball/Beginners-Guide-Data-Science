This is a DELICIOUS recipe and so easy! I roasted the asparagus in the oven with a little olive oil and used part sesame oil as some others had suggested. I also cut the spears into about 2" pieces to make it easier to serve at a potluck - not as pretty but worked well. I also toasted the pecans a bit.

I started making this dish with the intention of preparing it exactly as written.  However, after marinating the asparagus overnight, I decided to ad lib the final touches.  I tossed the marinated spears onto the grill at the last moment. After plating the beautifully grilled spears, I added the green onion, and sprinkled them with slivered almonds that had been toasted in the oven.  THEY WERE DELICIOUS!! I will make this dish again and again!!

Absolutely excellent recipe.  I do not normally even particularly like asparagus, but this recipe was a tremendous hit with both me and my family.  My parents both loved it...in fact, my dad raved about it for the entire weekend.  I only marinated it for a couple of hours, and it still was divine.  The next day, I'd left it in the bag with the marinade, and it was even better.  Will be making this recipe again and again--a permanent favorite.

This was OK but not anything that made me go "wow!" I think my problem was my asparagus wasn't as fresh as I would have liked and that imparted a bitter taste. I am going to try it again using fresh asparagus and sesame oil instead of vegetable oil.

My guests and I did not care for this recipe.  I felt that the soy sauce flavor overpowered the dish (I followed the recipe exactly).  I liked the idea of a cold, marinated, crisp asparagus dish, but this did not do it for me.

This is a wonderful salad/vegetable.  I took it to a party last night and it was eaten with many raves.  This morning I had to send the recipe to everyone attending.  I did substitute l tablespoon sesame oil for 1 of the vegetable oil and added the sesame seeds as someone suggested.  It was wonderful and so easy.  You just need to plan ahead to marinate it.

i just made the asparagus, i didn't add the onions or the pecans, but we did not like this.  maybe it's because of how long it was marinated?  maybe i will make again, but only use dressing at the time i serve it & will definitely toast pecans or cashews and add green onions.

This was sooooo good.  My 14 y.o. grand daughter HATES asparagus and she LOVED these.  I used cashews and sesame seeds that I toasted in a little butter, drained on a paper towel and cooled.  When serving, I tossed the green onions (about 1/2 cup, not 2 tblsp) in a little of the marinade also.  To serve I lined up the asparagus on each plate, sprinkled with onions and then the seeds. I was delicious and I will serve it often.

This is good. My marinade turned out a little too tart. Maybe it was because I used honey instead of sugar. I also used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil.

very good, a little salty. Pecans are a great addition. I've made them twice so far and will be making again.

This recipe is so easy and soooo good! I find that cooking the asparagus in the boiling water for 2-3 minutes works perfect, leaving just the right amount of crunch.

Tweeked it quite a bit so it's not fair to say I didn't like THIS recipe.  Do NOT marinate for 24 hrs. WAY, WAY too long....strong flavor.  Used slivered almonds instead.....just okay for me...probably would not make again.

I have never bought, cooked or ate asparagus before.  I was looking for a dish to take to the company Christmas party.  This recipe was a hit!!!  Everyone complimented me on the dish.  I only marinated the asparagus for approximately 5 hours.  I took another reviewers suggestion and cut the spears into 2" pieces.  I will definetely be making this dish again!!  I give the recipe a 5 rating due to all the wonderful compliments I received from asparagus eaters!! Thank you very much for the recipe!!

I used low-sodium soy sauce. Next time I would a little less sugar because it was a little sweet for our taste. Also, it doesn't HAVE to be marinated overnight. I couple of hours is fine. Also, make sure the asparagus is not over-cooked! We enjoyed this recipe!

The flavor of the marinade/asparagus was great but i found my asparagus looking very unappetizing. Some had an odd brown color and looked a lil slimey.Maybe i will cut the marinating time to just a few hrs next time. The pecans didnt really go well with the aspargus either. Looked nice on top but that was about it.

I brought this to a party and got rave reviews. I did tweek the recipe just a bit. I used toasted sesame oil instead of vegetable oil, added some garlic and minced ginger to the marinade. I also let it marinade and extra 12 hours. This is a definite keeper.

My husband and toddler liked this, but I didn't much. I found the asparagus to be very soggy after marinating for so long. I also found there to be too much of the dressing. I think there are better (crispier) ways to enjoy a great vegetable.

Couldn't wait to try this. I added some sesame oil to marinade 1 tsp. Toasted some sesame seeds to sprinkle over marinated asparagus, along with nuts and green onions. Couldn't be better. I always over buy the asparagus when it it first comes into season and then run out of ways of using it. This was absolutely terrific!!!

Delicious!  Even my friends who don't like asparagus liked this one.  Didn't need all the pecans, and added a bit of sesame oil to the marinade.  Will definitely make this again and again!

This was really nice! After my first bite I was like, oh ok not bad but nothing special. But I liked it more and more as I kept eating and wished I had more! I marinated it for 24 hours and I didn't find it too strong at all. I did adjust/eyeball the measurements though (I only had a small amount of asparagus, so I didn't want to make the full marinade amount) so maybe I ended up adding more oil or less vinegar. I would definitely make this again!

Tasted good...  But I'm not one of those great pre-planners, so some time I need to make it 24 hrs ahead and see if it's better!
Did it a second time and used broccoli and asparagus, then grilled...  WOW!

I added a simple teaspoon of old style whole grain dijon mustard...made all the difference in the world.  No more overpowering soysauce taste, but a rich hearty thanksgiving flavor :D  The next day I also added some pan cooked pealed potatoes and some candied sauteed onions, omg delicious!

Made this for a Mother's Day celebration yesterday and it was well received. I also used splenda,less of it than what was suggested for the sugar, and added a little minced garlic in with the marinade.  It stayed fresh tasting sitting on the buffet table, and leftovers are even good.  Very easy, not too overpoweringly salty when you use reduced sodium soy.  Thanks!

Different way to eat asparagus.  I only did this one pound of asparagus, but made the full amount of marinade.  I also used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil.

I made this for a family get together. First of all, it's unbelievably easy to make. Second..it went so fast I should've doubled the recipe! Everyone loved it.

We really enjoyed this one, even a non-asparagus lover asked it be a keeper:). Thanks to the reviewer who gave added info to boil the asparagus for 2-3 minutes because that really helped me with a time frame and it was perfect. I didn't change any of the ingredients and thought it was very good. A good company recipe with good flavor as is.

I enjoyed this recipe.  Having a cold veggie to bring for a dinner is great, as you don't have to cook something when you get there.  With marinating the asparagus it isn't as strong as normal, so even people who don't "like" asparagus, eat it.  I confess I overcooked the asparagus a bit, but it was still good.

Very tasty. Can even substitute splenda/sweet & low for the sugar to make it even more low-carb.

I made this once per the recipe (served cold).  The 2nd time I marinated the washed & trimmed asparugus and microwaved them at the end so the dish was hot.  My husband liked this a bit better than I did.  It was OK but a bit sour, probably from the vinegar.

Do not marinate 24 hrs.  Several hours in the fridge works fine and keeps the green color of the asparagus.

This is a delicious way of serving asparagus.  I did use less oil and soy sauce and more sugar than called for due to personal preference.  I also toasted the pecans and only marinated for about 4 hrs.

I have made this dish for several gatherings and always gets raves. Sub sliced toasted almonds for sesame seeds and it's a winner!

I have made this recipe over and over again.  Everyone loves it.  I can make it the night before and it is ready to go when time is pressing.  It is a great summer dish for parties and even to take camping. Bring this dish, throw a steak on the grill and you have a great gourmet meal.
