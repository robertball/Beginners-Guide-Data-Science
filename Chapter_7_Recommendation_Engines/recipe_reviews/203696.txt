This had such common ingredients for my household, that I had to give it a whirl!  The soymilk scared me, but it came out with great results!  I doubled the gravy mix, (necessary), and thickened it with flour, then served it over toast for breakfast. I even added extra veggies I hade left over, (green beans & onions), YUM!

I was going to saute my yellow squash and zucchini for dinner, but thought it would be boring. I found this recipe and was SO glad I did! It turned out fantastic and I had all the ingredients at home except soy milk so I used my normal lactose-free milk. It was fantastic!

okay, but would recommend not using so much sauce and if you like your veggies a little crunky like me don't cook as long.

We weren't too thrilled with this in our house, but it's probably personal preference.  I also think I was expecting it to taste and look different.  I have no idea why--the soy sauce should've been my clue this isn't a normal cheese sauce, but I guess expectations don't always match reality.  The sauce is pretty thin, so I added cornstarch to make it more of a gravy.  thanks for the recipe!

This was easy and quick and added great flavor to vegetables I'm otherwise not too crazy about.  Would definitely recommend and will be making this again for sure.  I used regular milk instead of soy milk and it turned out great.
