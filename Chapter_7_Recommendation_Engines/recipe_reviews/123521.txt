This was a really good recipe, but I did make some changes. I used white corn meal and a heaping cup of sugar in the mix.  When I prepared the corn bread, I used 1 and 1/4 c. of milk. This produced a moist corn bread.

Needs a little more sugar, and use a little less than the stated amount of the mix when making the corb bread. Otherwise there isn't enough for a full 5 shots.

Scaled to 12 servings. Used 4 T. sugar, and 1 whole egg.  Sprayed nonstick spray into 12 cupcake lined muffin pans and added the batter.  Baked at 425 for 20-25 minutes.  My husband loved these corn muffins!

This is good if you don't like sweet cornbread. I love it- just basic yummy cornbread. You can probably sweeten as much as you like. I added some frozen roasted mild chilis I had in freezer, added some smoked motzarella. This goes well with tortilla soup. Thanks for great recipe!

Awesome! Makes a lot of mix and the cornbread came out perfect. I used honey and butter for dipping and it tastes just like Marie Calendars. So simple.

Just tried this with beans and rice for dinner. 1/3 cup sugar was plenty sweet. Baked it in cast iron skillet and was great. Thank you for a great recipe. Will be making this often

This is yummy cornbread :) I made the cornmeal out of dried corn from our fields and it came out wonderful. Fixed a batch of beans and ham shank with the cornbread for dinner tonight and not a bit was leftovers. Thank you for a great recipe!

5 stars with a couple changes.  I like a sweeter corn bread, so I added a little more sugar.  After reading reviews that said it was a little dry, I halved the amount of mix to prepare (1-1/6 c.) and mixed with a little over 1/2 c. milk and the full egg.  I made it in 6 muffin cups baked for 20-25 minutes.  They turned out moist enough and the amount was perfect for my family of 2 adults and 2 small children.  My one year old liked them, but I couldn't please my 3 year old who's become a little more judicious in her food choices lately.

Not bad.  I'm a bit odd in that I don't like corn bread at all, but I like corn dogs.  So, I didn't have corn bread mix on hand when I wanted to make the Corn Dog Casserole on here.  I scaled the servings to 12 and made this for the casserole, and it worked wonderfully.  Thanks for the recipe!

Worked great in corn casserole.  I have not tried on own so I did not give a great review, but plan to try again very soon.  Worked great in other recipes...

I tried this, but I think I messed up somewhere. I went by the reviews and put a bit more sugar and milk, but when I cooked it in the oven, it stayed too "goopy." The crusty parts on the top tasted delicious, but the whole thing didn't turn out. It was probably from me changing it up a bit, but look at it this way: the ducks at the nearest pond will have a good meal now!! :D

I used this mix to make "Awesome and Creamy Corn Casserole" from this site.  I'm currently in a remote area and couldn't find the boxed corn bread mix called for in the recipe.  I was so pleased with how this turned out!  The corn casserole was perfect and tasted just like it always had.  I can't wait to use this mix to make the corn bread.

I ended up adding copious amounts of milk for my hand blender to try to get through it. I baked it for 20 min at 425 degree.  I tried it out and it's edible but even though I added more milk it's still dryer than dust.
