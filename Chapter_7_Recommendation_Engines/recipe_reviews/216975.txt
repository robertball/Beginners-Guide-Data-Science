tried two batches of this chicken. Absolutely could not get the batter to stick and it would start to burn before the chicken was cooked through. Dud recipe.

It was great, used my deep fryer and had to alternate the recipe a bit. In a deep fryer they need to be in at 325 for about 12 minutes to cook at the way through. Also going to try soaking the chicken in chicken broth before coating because it needed a bit more salt. Fried great, and with a little salt tasted great.
