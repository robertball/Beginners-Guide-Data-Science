Big P's Classic Chili Haiku: "It's been a long time, since a chili's been 5 stars, but I loved this lots!" I make a different chili recipe about once a week, and rarely do I go back and make a recipe a 2nd time around, or at least making it the same way again. THIS chili might change that (thanks Big P!) as I really liked it that much that I'll probably make it again. It was easy to put together, I actually liked the big hunks of red onion and celery (although I'd consider adding bell pepper) and all the ingredients were easy to come by, and all came together for a fantastic, no-fussiness chili.

This was very good and simple, resulting in a mild chili that everyone will like.   I made it exactly as stated, but as usual for us, I ended up adding a little molasses to add a little sweetness.

It was good! Friends liked it, I liked it- was just missing something. Not sure what though.
