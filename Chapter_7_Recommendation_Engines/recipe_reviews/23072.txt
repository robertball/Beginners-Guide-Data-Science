I've made this cake three times, including for my sister's wedding, and it was excellent!  I used all butter rather than shortening/margarine, and left out the baking soda (by accident at first, but then I realized that the cake layers came out flat and thin i.e. easy to stack and ice without the soda).  When I made the two-tier wedding cake, I doubled the recipe to make the bottom 12" diameter tier and I didn't have to adjust the baking time or anything.  HIGHLY recommended, including the frosting.  Even avowed pineapple haters liked this cake.

I made this for my Brother in Law's  surprise birthday to rave reviews.  One gentleman told me "This may have been the best cake I have ever eaten". 

I tripled the recipe made it in 2 14" square pans. The changes that I made were using 2 large cans of crushed drained pineapple.  I cut the amount of pecans in half in the batter. Left them out of the frosting and coated the outside wall of the cake in crushed pecans. I decreased the sugar by one half of a cup. I also added a package of dream whip to the batter.  It really was very moist and delicious. I may use this recipe for my friends upcoming fall wedding cake!

This cake is wonderful! I made it for my sisters birthday and it looked and tasted fantastic. The recipe is easy and the baking time accurate. The icing was smooth and perfect..so smooth in fact that I couldnt bring myself to mix in the chopped pecans but instead sprinkled them over the top and sides of the cake as a garnish. I also prepared it as a two 9 inch layer cake, instead of the three 8 inch layer which worked very well. My whole family loved it, even my sisters 3 yr old son :) I would defintely recommend this cake!

I have been cooking for over 40 years and have plenty of experience baking.  This is one of the best cake recipes that I have ever tried. I made it according to the directions except for changing nuts to English Walnuts because I didn't have pecans.  This will be my special occasion cake from now on.  Just wonderful!

Wow! Everyone loved this cake! I doubled the coconut and pineapple, left out the pecans (cuz I didn't have any on hand) and Wahlaaaahhhh. Moist, tasty, rich. I made a cream cheese flavored with real rum frosting and yummy! I'll make this one again!

SO good!! I made this cake twice recently and can't get enough of it. The 2nd time was for a baby shower and I omitted the pecans and coconut from the cake & added 1/2 cup more pineapple and WOW. I had lots of requests for this recipe at the shower.

This is the best cake I have ever made.  It was delicious!  I brought it to work and got compliments on it all day long.  It actually tastes like those cakes you buy in expensive bakeries!

This is the best cake I have ever made. It was delicious!  I love this cake.  Unlike other cakes, this one tastes better the older it get's.  I have no problem with making it a few days before I need it, other than it being devoured.

I made this cake for Mother's Day and was unimpressed.  I couldn't taste the coconut or pineapple, which made it quite boring.  Won't make again.

I've made this cake for two weddings, two graduations, a retirement party and a 70th birthday party.  One of the brides saw the cake, stole away with it and saved it as her "topper" for the first anniversary.  This cake has become famous among my friends and now, when a special event approaches, people begin to ask if I'm going to bring the "wedding cake".  It's great to be famous for a fantastic cake this this.  :]  I've doubled this recipe to make a half-sheet cake, but I generally make it as two rounds.  You have to bake the half sheet a lot longer and I usually bake it at 325.  I've made this with a traditional buttercream frosting, but I prefer the cream cheese frosting.   I've made the frosting with and without nuts (and used the nuts as decoration).

I found this recipe to be very similar to my mother's recipe for Italian cream cake. However, for a real Italian cream cake, omit the pineapples, and add some brewed espresso or rum to the cream cheese frosting

A knock out!  This cake was such a hit and I was so pleased to make a genuinely moist cake.  As other reviewers have said, I used all butter (does anyone really use "shortening" or lard anymore?) and I cut down on the sugar in the cake batter.  Also put whole pecans on top as decoration, not in the icing.  Next time I will cut way back on the sugar in the icing...as much as I love icing, the heavy sugar taste overpowered the flavor of the cake a bit.    But WOW - yum!  Got lots of compliments and this goes in the family recipe box for sure.  Note that it isn't the cheapest cake to bake...pecans are pretty dear but worth it!

I wanted to transport this to a party and keep it simple, so I baked it in a 9x13x2 recyclable aluminum pan. Acutally I doubled up the pan to keep it from burning...seemed to help!

This the best cake I've ever made! Made it for a family reunion and there were 10 other cakes served and this cake was the only one finished! Everyone wanted the recipe. I made it exactly as given and it turned out fine. However, every experienced baker knows that beaten egg whites are ALWAYS folded in last. I'll make that adjustment from now on. I can't emphasis enough how fabulous this cake is.

This cake was such a hit!  I made it for a friend's wedding, and now friends are requesting this same cake for birthday cakes! I did not add any of the pineapple, coconut or pecans.  Instead, I made a raspberry filling.  I used the same frosting it recommends here.  Everything was exceptional!

I've made this twice now and people love it...especially my husband.  I would have given it 5 stars, but for the denseness of it, I didn't.  The flavor is just like a wedding cake, which is also a more dense cake, but this was just a little too dense for me.  Of course, maybe I just need to make it a few more times because i think it's one of those recipes that the more you make, the better you get at it.  The icing is really good too.

Wonderfully moist!
We live at high altitude(8,500ft) and the adjustments I made were to add 1/4cup more butter milk and decreased the shortening by 2 tablespoons , decreased the sugar by 1/4 cup, and I did not drain the pineapple completely! It was one of the most successful cakes I have made at this altitude!! :-)

Just finished baking this cake...the aroma is wonderful, the texture is light, and the taste, delicious! For those who don't like too much sweetness, drop the amount of sugar to 2 or 2 1/2 cups. Otherwise, follow the directions as they are and this recipe will surely be a hit!

Ii will say the taste alone is a 5.  However the consistency is a 3. Although this cake tastes delicious, it crumbled into a million pieces.

This cake was very nice. I made the full recipe but only used one layer, then cut out three increasingly smaller layers from that. I  made mini-muffins with the left-over batter. I also left the nuts out, they didn't seem right. The cake turned out to be VERY moist. I made it a second time and it wasn't as moist then because I left it in the oven a few minutes too long, so it's important not to overbake this cake at all. 

The frosting was excellent, but a bit hard to apply because of the crubmliness of the cake. People loved this cake, it's a nice fancy cake for any occasion.

After reading the reviews, I decided to give this cake a try. It was yummy and was a hit with the non-nut eaters in my family. The toughest part was getting the cake out of the pan, albeit I was using my sister-in-laws pans rather than mine. Next time I would use higher quality pans and line the bottom with wax paper. 

For the recipe, I increased the coconut to 3/4c and decreased the nuts in the cake from 1c to 3/4c. I would also double the icing recipe so you have enough to do thick layers between the cakes to really show off the 3-layer cake look. I also would decrease the nuts to 3/4c using 1/4c of this to reduce into fine powder to give the flavor without the nut texture--it's good the other way too but I wanted it to be liked by those who normally don't care for nuts.

All I can say is...WOW!  Hubby helped and accidently dumped in a whole can of crushed pineapple instead of 1/2 cup and cake still turned out great.  I could sell these cakes for profit but that would take the fun out of making them.  End results are worth all the effort.  Thanks for sharing!!!

Oh my! This cake is fabulous! It was a huge hit at the soup supper where I served it. Next time I would put more filling between the layers. I was afraid I would run out of frosting, but there is plenty to put a generous amount between the layers (the recipe does not mention filling the layers).

Very good cake. I took it to my church gathering and everyone loved it. It was gone in no time. I did add a box of vanilla pudding to the dry ingredients to make sure it was moist. I really didn't taste the pineapple or coconut, I may have to add extra next time. I didn't mix the pecans in the frosting, I sprinkle them on top. I felt like the cake was a little bit overcooked, maybe I'll cut the time by a few minutes next time. Overall, a very good cake, will definately make it over the holidays.

IT WAS AMAZING! I loved it! I doubled the coconut and the pineapple. Took it to work, didnt last a day. It was great!!! Not to sweet, but sweet enough to hit the spot. Took a lot of work to make it, but in the end it was perfect! Loved it!!!!

I love this cake!!! It is even good without frosting.  Frosting the whole cake was too sweet for me so next time I make it I think I will only frost the top and middle.  This recipe is a keeper.

Someone at work gave me the idea to make this cake.  She had a different recipe, and I wanted a recipe with more ingredients, so I came to All-Recipes.com. This is a great reciepe.  My mother had several pieces and she normally does not eat a lot of sweet things.  The only thing that I would recommend is using cake flour instead of all purpose flour.

Followed recipe exactly, except used 1.5x almond extract, 1.5x buttermilk, and 2x pineapple.  Poured a little pineapple juice into the mix when blending well.  Made as cupcakes.

This is only the 2nd cake I've made in my life and it was delicious!  I didn't find it bland at all and really only a hint of pineapple.  I made it for my boyfriend's birthday and will definitely make again.  I even had a Bridget Jones moment and wound up adding the yolk before the whites and messed that part up, but it turned out to be delicious and moist!

Words cannot express how good this cake is! You would think that because the cake is so dense, it would be dry, but it was far from it. It was tender, moist and delicious. I decreased the sugar just a tad, added a little more pineapple and coconut and that was it. No one in my family likes coconut, but I made it anyway, just because I wanted to see if I could, and I did. You will not be disappointed!

I bake for a local coffee shop & thought this one might be good to use for them, I was not impressed.  The cake has very little flavor aside from biting into a pineapple piece occasionally.  It also seemed dry to me.

I made this cake for my mom's birthday and it got rave reviews!  I *love* this kind of cake, and the recipe was perfect.  The only thing I did differently was not to add the pecans to the frosting; I sprinkled them on top.  While I typically hate baking, I will be making this one again!  Thanks for posting!

This was ok, not bad, but not remarkable in anyway.  I have no prior experience icing cakes, but this frosting with the nuts in it seemed very difficult to spread on the cake.

Very good cake and easy to make. My 10 year old daughter made this cake for the County Project Show and placed 2nd. We had to omit the frosting - no cream cheese accepted, it had to be cooked. She sold her cake for $30.00.

The cake itself has an excellent flavor, but the texture and consistency turned out a little too grainy.  (I'm big on texture so I usually add a little (1/4 cup or less) light vegetable oil to most cake recipes to make sure it stays moist while I'm creaming butter and sugar.  Maybe I shouldn't have.)  The pineapple and coconut made the cake feel a little "lumpy" in my mouth too.  But bascially, I thought it had a great flavor.

Bake for only 20 minutes and then start checking with a toothpick.  I made a triple layer and 35 minutes was way too long.  In spite of it being a little crispy the flavor of this cake was wonderful.

I am so happy I came across this recipe. Just to put it out there, the pictures don't do it any justice at all. I followed a suggestion from above and did all butter instead of the shortening and omitted the baking soda. The best frosting I've made in a very long time. Everyone was raving about it. Thanks so much for sharing.

I made 1/2 of this recipe to try it before I make it for a bridal shower this weekend.  It is amazing!  I used all butter, used 2 times the pineapple, but did not double the coconut.  The bake time was perfect - it took just 35 minutes. I added a scant 1/4 teaspoon almond extract to the frosting and added pecans on the top after I frosted the cake.

My husband said this cake is even better than my signature coconut cake!

I made this for a bachelorette party and it was unanimously declared a fantastic cake. My mom had the leftovers, and she also said it was one of the best cakes she'd ever eaten.

I like that no single flavor comes across too strongly. Instead of tasting individual coconut, pecans, and pineapple, you taste a harmonious blend of flavors complimented by a smooth, moist texture that's  solid and cohesive but light and airy.

The only substitute I made was butter instead of shortening.

I didn't care for the look of the pecans mixed into the frosting, so removed two cups of frosting and mixed only that with finely chopped pecans and used it as filling, frosting the top and sides with the plain cream cheese frosting.  It seemed skimpy on the sides, so I pressed chopped pecans around the whole cake.   Yup, probably 4 cups of pecans in all! The cake was fabulous, but the frosting was a bit too sweet and rich for my taste.  If I make it again, it will probably be with buttercream.

Phenomenal flavor, very moist and light!   I made cupcakes with this recipe (makes 36-48 cupcakes) with a couple of modifications: 
*Instead of margarine, I used butter.
*Instead of 2 tsp vanilla in the frosting, I used 1 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp almond flavoring.
*Instead of mixing pecans into the frosting, I used sugar-glazed pecans sprinkled on top of the frosting.  

Probably the best cupcakes I've ever made, and I'm not a big fan of nuts. They were a big hit. I'll be making them again!

My guests all raved at how good this was, even the ones who didn't like pineapple. If you are going to make something unbelievably good you just have to add goodness and forget about calories. I made this cake but changed a few things the second time and thought it was much better by substituting the margarine and shortening for 1 full cup Butter, adding walnuts with the pecans and also including more of them than called for in both the cake and icing, also adding coconut to the icing. You can add more pineapple if you like also. A couple things to consider, If you can't get your egg whites to fluff, its OK just add them anyway, and double the icing, your guests will appreciate it.  Its ok to change some things, put in what you like, omit what you don't.

I made this into cupcakes for my fathers 80th birthday party. The theme was Italian foods so this was perfect! They were the best cupcakes I've ever made, I got tons of compliments...they are highly addictive.

i have made this cake twice the first time i forgot the baking soda which made it come out flat which was fine cause it was easier to stack but both times it was super moist and tasted so good. i had coconut haters even like it they couldnt even tell it had coconut in it. on one cake i ran out of time and frosting so i went to store and bought fluffy whip icing and used that on one and tasted awesome too so if u dont have time to make cream cheese frosting included in recipe try betty crocker whipped fluffy white icing with some nuts on top to decorate it will work as well and light in taste too. the only problem is it is alot of work but worth the taste.

This was almost too delicious!  Subbed white wheat flour and it was still moist and delicious!
