Don’t bother melting the marshmallows, it doesn’t work. Highly recommend buying an entire bag of chocolate chips for the top layer and then sprinkling s’mores mix. Following the original recipe only coats a small portion of the cake.

This cake is delicious!  The only change I made was to use the whole packet of graham crackers rather than the one cup called for and a little additional butter.  It does take time to get all the four layers put together, but the instructions are spot on.  A little slice goes a long way, so you need to plan on having a lot of eaters!  Very delicious!  Thanks, Hershey's Kitchens!
