This was a good, very basic chicken soup.  It was really easy to make, especially since I had leftover chicken.  The garlic gives the soup a great flavor.

Great way to use up leftover chicken. Added spaeztle noodles. Quick and easy to prepare. Kids ate it right up. Used minced garlic from a jar, chicken base from Sam's Club and frozen diced onion. Also added a bit of parsley and thyme.

Really simple, yet really great! I actually used 4 chicken breasts instead of the legs that you reccomended, with 4 bouillon cubes, and it worked out a treat! Thanks for sharing

Loved loved loved it. I ended up using a whole chicken and uping the ingredents for my large family. I added shell noddles instead of the egg noodles and added a little to the cooking time to conpensate. It is a favorite at my table.

I am a very new and fearful cook.  I usually seem to mess up the most basic recipe.  But my husband was very sick today and so I wanted to make him chicken soup.  This soup turned out great!  Very little preparation and not too many ingredients.  It is probably not as tasty as other more complex recipes, but it was perfect for my husband and my taste.  I will definitely try this again.

A really great soup, but just a tad bland. I had to toss in some chicken broth and some Mrs. Dash seasoning to get the taste I was looking for.

Also, try using homemade noodles instead of packaged. Delicious!

Good soup and very easy to prepare.  I used a pack of chicken thighs and about half as many noodles.  Will make this again!

4 stars for ease, but I would be sure to add extra seasoning. It was a little bland. I used chicken broth instead of bouillon, and I also sauteed the garlic with the chicken. I added in the noodles (used flat egg noodles) after they had already been cooked al dente so that they wouldn't soak up the broth as much.

What an easy but hearty hot soup on a cold day for my family.  I followed the recipe exactly but added the broader egg noodles instead of the thin ones.  I'll make it again and again.

Very delicious. I make this often and my family can't get enough of it. However, to feed a family of four I have to triple the amount of chicken and water. I also substitute the noodles for 2 cups of rice. Still fantastic, thanks for this recipe.

Perfect and easy to make, all in one pot. Didn't have skinless chicken, so I cooked it with the skin, then removed as I was pulling the meat. Added a lot of flavor.
