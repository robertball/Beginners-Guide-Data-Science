1 can cranberries, whole Ocean Spray
1 jar Spicy Chili Sauce, Heinz
1 cup Ketchup, Heinz
1/2 cup onion, diced
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
2 tablespoons liquid smoke flavoring
2 cups brown sugar, packed

This recipe using the pre-cooked frozen meatballs only gets a 2 star with me. Why use frozen meatballs when it's so easy to make your own. Doing that will raise the recipe up to at least a 4 star recipe.

I've been making these meatballs for several years.  Sometimes I've made my own meatballs, and other times, when hosting a large event, I've used the more convenient frozen meatballs.  Either way, there have never been any leftovers.

kick this up another notch:
1) Add a little lemon and sugar
2) Simmer for at least an 1 hour until the meatballs are glazed by the sauce.  This results in a deep penetration of the sauce flavor into the meat, masking the cheese which often is present in frozen meat balls.

I made my own meatballs using 2 lbs. ground beef, 1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese, 2 cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs, 2 extra large eggs,  salt, pepper, and ground dry parsley.  I just incorporate all of it and make balls, spray a cookie tray with Pam and bake at 325 for about 25 minutes, put all in my slow cooker and add this amazing sauce, doubled off course.  So good!

I did not make this at this time, but many years ago we made it for a New Years dance at our church, and everyone enjoyed them.  It doesn't always have to be homemade to be good.

This is a great recipe and would be 4 stars if homemade meatballs were used.  Also, try adding a can of sauerkraut to the sauce - yum!

I made this for my husbands bday party and they were the first things gone so they must have been pretty good. Alot of people liked them and asked for the recipe. I quadrupled the recipe and added a little liquid smoke and worschestire sauce. I also used turkey meatballs. My advice is to get the cran. sauce nice and hot and melted down before adding chili sauce, otherwise it stays thick and chunky and doesn't pour over the meatballs as good. I made the night before the party, kept in the fridge and then got them hot a few hours before the party. The flavor seemed better then.

I made these for a Super Bowl get-together; everyone raved about them, and I was asked for the recipe as well.  Even partiers who have made the grape jelly/chili sauce version of these meatballs told me that mine were much better!  I will make them again.

Served these twice during the holidays and both time they were inhaled!  People raved about the sauce and were sure I'd made the meatballs from scratch.  I was thrilled to tell them the meatballs were purchased frozen and of the ease of the sauce.  When throwing a party, time is often a big factor and they were happy to here how easy they are.  Of course you can make the meatballs from scratch, but it is hard to imagine they would be better.  My friends will surely be serving them when I come over now.

Ok I just did these and let me tell you, my fiance gobbled it right up.  He is vegetarian so I got the frozen veggie meatballs.  I sauted some onions, garlic in the pan before adding sauces.  Served with some spaghetti, salad and garlic bread. So easy to do.

Took this to a party last night and it was an enormous hit!!!  So, so easy to make, especially since I used frozen meatballs.  I will  be making this more often...curious to see how well it freezes as it would be handy, for me, to have small batches that can be used as wanted.  Know this recipe has been around for a long while but had never made it until yesterday...what a mistake that was! :O  They really and truely are that good!

I've made this a couple of times.  They are SUPER easy to make and a big hit.  I didn't cook them on the stove.  I mixed the cranberry sauce and chili sauce and then put the sauce and meatballs in a crockpot.  Yummy!

YES!!, This IS the recipe for meatballs and lil bbq weinies that all the old lil bitties bring to the pot lucks! I use pre-cooked meatballs and/or eckridge lil smokies (THE BEST!) I was kinda pissed when i found the recipe on the back of the ocean spray can and realized the recipe i had been searching for  FOR YEARS consisted of two simple, cheap, freakin ingredients!! Hate cranberries in any form..., i would live off this stuff! make huge batches and send them to work w/ hubby for him and the rest of the road workers :) They think i'm the best cook ever, too funny

Use the Cocktail Meatballs recipe on this site instead of frozen meatballs. I've tried it both ways and there is no comparison.

I'm rating this for the sauce.... the jellied cranberty and chili sauce is the BEST combination for cocktail meatballs.  It's SO easy and SO delicious.  I agree that making homemade meatballs is easy enough and I would suggest making the meatballs in advance (you can freeze them too).  I mixed the jellied cranberry and chili sauce in my crockpot, threw in the frozen meatballs and let sit in my fridge overnight.  When I passed by that evening or the next morning I would give it a quick stir.  Then several hours (approx 3) before the party I took it out of the fridge and put the crockpot on low.  That's it!

These were AWESOME.  Made as directed in the crock pot.  My husband said these were way better than the ones with BBQ sauce and grape jelly (not as sweet).  Will continue to make this recipe.

Served this in place of the oldie but goodie, grape jelly/chili sauce/lemon juice, meatballs. Was not well received by my guests. Most commented flavor of cranberry sauce/chili sauce together, was not desirable.

I make this every year for our annual Christmas Open House, they are always a hit and people always ask for the recipe. The only thing I do differently is add a Tablespoon of ground gloves to the mixture before pouring it over the meatballs.

Appetizers don't get much easier than this one!!!!  I used a 1.4 lb. of pre-cooked cocktail meatballs to the can of jellied cranberry sauce and the bottle of chili sauce.  It was the perfect proportion.  I also used a 2.5 quart crockpot to heat the sauce and meatballs.  These things were flying out of the crockpot - - everyone loved them.   Don't let the unusual combination of ingredients scare you.  These are delish!!!

Have made these for years.  They are as advertised...quick easy and good.  If you don't have the jellied cranberry sauce, grape jelly works too.  If you want to make your own meatballs, be my guest.  However, you are then removing the 'quick' compnent of this recipe.

I make my own meatballs, using crushed corn flakes.  (Makes a sweeter, firmer meatball.)  To the sauce, I add 3 T of brown sugar and 1 T of lemon juice.  Not a big fan of frozen meatballs.  However, using homemade meatballs and the sauce additions, this recipe is definitely a 5 stars one.

I have been using this combo (but use whole crarnberry sauce) for years...for fresh meatballs-either beef or turkey, for stuffed cabbage, and recently in the slow cooker for pork chops.

These are fabulous. I use a couple Tablespoons of the good authentic Chili paste from the asian grocery (basically it is ground up chiles!) instead of the Heinz sauce. I do add a little brown sugar to balance the heat, and some garlic.

I'm not sure I've ever made an easier appetizer.  I doubled the recipe and dumped it all in the crockpot, I'm honestly not sure I ever even stirred it?
Guests loved them and wanted the recipe. One note -I've used the store brand chili sauce before, and it tasted funny...make sure to use the Heinz brand.

These were gobbled up and got rave reviews at the party I took them to! Premade the meatballs, heated the sauce in the slow cooker, added the balls along with a little brown sugar and lemon juice and cooked on low for a couple hours. Yum!

Simple and delicious! I have served these as an appetizer and taken them to potlucks. They are always a huge hit. They are great when you don't have the time for extensive prep-work. Everybody always wants the recipe and they're always shocked when I tell them how easy it is!

I make these for many occasions and everyone always loves them!  They're great because they're so quick and easy!  Others complain that the recipe calls for frozen meatballs, but I love them because frozen meatballs make this so easy and speedy!  I keep the meatballs on hand to use just for this recipe because they can be ready for a last minute event.  Super!

As written, this recipe is always a 5 star hit. I have expanded the ingredients over the years for added flavor. Double the sauce - 2 cans cranberry, 2 bottles chili sauce. I use 3 T dark brown sugar, 1 T lemon juice, 4 T dried minced onion and about 10-15 dashes of Tabasco in addition to the cranberry and Heinz chili sauces. Lil smokies or a variety of smoked sausages (cut into 4ths) go into my pot, also. No matter what, the crockpot is empty long before the party is over.

Only 3 stars for using pre-made meatballs. I baked my own ground turkey meatballs, and doubled the sauce. These freeze very well and are always there for drop-in company.

Great recipe for those who don't have all day to wallow in their kitchens. I'm a vegetarian and only use meatless meatballs. Can I still play? Okay, now that's off my chest, my mother passed the original version of this recipe down to me years ago which calls for red currant jelly with the chili sauce. I've also used grape jelly for equally amazing results. If you love a hint of spice, try a pinch of cayenne, it's amazing. I put everything into my slow cooker on low early in the morning and by mid afternoon they're ready. Never any left overs.

My son-in law said they were the best meatballs he ever had. I added a dash of worcestershire sauce.  So much easier than making your own meatballs, and you would never know they were pre made.

This is so delicious!  I have a variation where I include a squeeze of fresh lemon juice and a few shakes of tabasco.  These are always a hit at parties, and there are (sadly) never any leftovers!

I have been making these for years and they are very yummy! When I have the extra time, I do like to make my own meatballs, so that I can control the size, ingredients, etc..., but in a pinch the frozen ones work out fine too. I LOVE the flavor of the sauce. I've also just thrown all of the ingredients in the slow cooker and let it go to town. Super simple, super tasty, and a great appetizer that is a crowd pleaser! :)

THIS IS THE BEST RECIPE EVER FOR A EASY APPETIZERS!! This is so easy, my children could make this everyday. I didn't make any changes to this because it didn't need any. My guests definetly enjoyed this. I only made one batch, because it was my first time making this, but I regret it. I should have made more. The meatballs finished up in an hour or so. I will definetly be making this all the time... Easy, Tasty, and Affordable :)

I agree with the reviews that the meat balls, not being home-made, reduces the star status to 3. I've prepared store-bought meat balls only to find them all spongy and too processed. Also they are not slow cooked if you use the HIGH setting for 4 hours as recommended by the maker, should be 5 hours on AUTO  or 8 hours on LOW which is a combo of HI and LOW settings. Assuming that time is not not a factor. Also the 15 minutes on stove top is not enough for the sauce to penetrate the meat.

I've been using this recipe for years, except that I use my own homemade meatballs.  Everyone loves them.  The frozen meatballs remind me of dog food, there's just something 'off' about them. 5 star recipe if using homemade meatballs.

I liked these quite a bit. I made up the sauce on the stove first to get everything mixed and melted and then poured it over turkey meatballs in my slow cooker. I cooked it for 4 hours on high and they came out great. At first, it looked like the sauce wasn't enough to cover the meatballs completely, but as it cooked down, everything got covered well, at the turkey meatballs were well flavored from the sauce. The leftovers were even better the next day. The sauce does thicken up quite a bit--just enough to fully coat everything, but not enough to use for pouring. I'd double the sauce if you're wanting to reserve some for pouring.

gotta be careful with what kind of meatballs are used.  The brand we bought was too spicy for the kids, and it didn't go ever well.  Like the ease and convenience of this recipe.

These are my favorite appetizer to make. Super easy, always a crowed pleaser. I've even made these with the frozen vegetarian meatballs for the non-meat eaters and they went crazy for them! Go figure. :) At home we eat them as a main dish over buttered egg noodles. Love em!

SO EASY and so tasty.  This is my standard party dish now.  Everyone always asks for the recipe, and are always blown away when I tell them how simple it is!  I use the frozen italian meatballs you can get at Costco, and it takes just a few minutes to throw together.  I always make this in my slow cooker a few hours ahead of time to let the flavors simmer.  It makes them so much better, trust me.

This is THE classic, midwestern, man-pleasing recipe for every game day.  However, I recommend allowing to slow-cook for AT LEAST 3-5 hours so flavors thoroughly permeate frozen meatballs.

Don't let the ingredients fool you.  I made this for Christmas and not a meatball was left.  Even the 4 and 5 year old's kept asking for more.  I did make one change.  I added about a tablespoon of brown sugar.  This really helped balance out the chili sauce.

These were very good.  A friend made them for our Christmas party at work, and gave me this recipe, printed from this website, and wanted it for my Recipe Box.  So simple and was a wonderful combination!  Will definitely make these myself.

I've made this for five years for every pool party we have in the summer, nearly every week. I use grape jelly instead of cranberry and I use my crock pot. Always a big hit.

I found this recipe on this site and gave it to my boss to make for our holiday party.  She thought it sounded weird, but they came out really good. There weren't any left at the end of the night!

I loved this recipe!  I tried it out on my friends at a recent Christmas party and everyone loved them too... :-)  no joke, I had no leftovers!  And its soooo easy.  It was also the first time I used my crock pot/slow cooker.  It was just so easy, and so tasty.

This was an easy dish to share at our party and I brought my crock pot home empty.  I used Italian meatballs from Costco, baked them in a 350º oven for 45 minutes before adding them to the remaining ingredients of this recipe I had cooking in the slow cooker.  They were so delicious, everyone asked for the recipe.  I served with slices of Italian bread (small loaves) - it was perfect.

Have made these twice now and both times they were a big hit.  I did add some jalapeno pepper jelly to the first batch.  The second batch I was out of the jelly so I just added some red pepper flakes.  I only got one little meatball when I wasn't fast enough to go back for more. The pot was almost licked clean. Very simple to make and keep warm in the crockpot.

used costcos's Italian meatballs and was feeling guilty that my contribution to my husband's company Christmas party was so simple to make. was pleasantly surprised when he came home with an empty crockpot and said that even with all the fancy food, people loved the meatballs! thanks for a very good & simple recipe!

These are addictive... just as written.  I for one appreciate the benefit of using pre-made meatballs... as I really hate touching ground meat for the time it takes to mix up fresh meatballs (or meatloaf or hamburgers...I know, I know...just an idiosyncrasy of mine...).  I would PAY someone to make them fresh for me, OR just plop a bag of frozen ones into the pot!! Not to mention, it is fast to throw together at the last minute if you're in a pinch to make something "fresh/hot."

Great recipe, I have made them often, but instead of Cranberry sauce I use 2 small jars of Jalapeno jelly to make a spicy meatball.

I love this recipe and it always goes over really well.  I bake the meatballs first to get some of the grease out and and then put everything in a slow cooker.  My other tip is use to use plain meatballs (I really like the ones from Aldi), not Italian meatballs.  I don't think the Italian seasoning goes well with the sweet bbq flavor of this sauce.  Delish!!  And I'm not even a huge fan of meat.

These would have been extremely easy to make if I could have found the meatballs.  My store didn't have the cocktail meatballs so I had to make my own, no biggie, just made a basic plain meatball with bread crumbs, egg, and a little seasoning.   I liked them, my roommate liked them but had a lot of leftovers. (And I had 7 people for dinner)  Re-heated they just tasted like BBQ sauce. Probably won't make again.

This sauce is hands-down the best sauce for meatballs. From what I hear you can play with the jelly flavor used (I actually made mine with grape). I've known about this recipe for years but this is the first time I've made it and was so excited to know that it is as simple as everyone said. One key piece of advise that I'm sure many already know.... do not skimp on meatballs. I made this with a cheaper brand, frozen turkey meatballs that were absolutely horrible and had to throw the batch out.  Next time I will make my own meatballs.

I am not an elaborate cook.  I found this recipe.  Easy and delicious.  They were all gone!  Takes longer than 15 mins to simmer though when starting with frozen meatballs.  Love it and it will be a staple of mine.

This is a solid pot luck recipe.  I'm sure it can be tweaked to earn that extra star; but, it is a real crowd pleaser as written.  I mad this for a pot luck; but, I never got my dish to the event.  Later that day I shared this dish with 11 other people (4 adults and 7 kids..plus us-1 more kid and 1 more adult) and EVERYBODY loved it.  Even my son who kept saying..."That looks like a lot of cranberry sauce and I don't like cranberry sauce." as I was getting the dish started. We made meatball subs out of this dish and they were great!

The best thing about these is the easy prep.  I haven't found the perfect frozen meatball yet, but these are great to bring to something that asks pot luck, and you have no time for that.  Let them simmer while getting ready to go, then transfer to a crock pot to keep them hot at the party/event/whatever.

Were a hit Christmas Eve Party. Everyone loved them. Ran to the store on Christmas morning to buy more to put into the crock pot for Christmas Day appetizers.

Made these for Christmas Eve, they were gone in a flash! Easy, simple recipe. We are going to make them again for New Year's since they have been requested.

This is one of my favorites. My Mom used to make these all the time. My brother named them red juicy meatballs when he was just a little kid. My Mom serves these as a meal with mashed potatoes and green peas. Any other way and my brother won't eat them.

I've been making this recipe for over 30 years. However, I use the whole berry Cranberry Sauce. 5 stars from me for ease, taste, texture, and no leftovers.

Don't let the short and somewhat odd ingredient list fool you: These really are the ULTIMATE party meatballs. We have had these at several different parties now, and each time, our guests look a little embarrassed and apologize for stuffing themselves with so many meatballs. They are incredible!

This was a HUGE hit! And to those who down grade the rating because of the frozen meatballs..huh? If you prefer the homemade ones and have the time, great. But for those of us on a hectic schedule this can't get any better! Throw in a crockpot and go! Great with noodles, too.

If meatballs are left too long in the crock pot, they tend to get mushy.  Other than that, they were a hit with guests at a party and are quite simple to make.  Next time I would probably double the can of cranberry and chili sauce so all the meatballs are simmering in sauce and less mixing them in it.

I give this recipe 5 stars for the ease of it.  I used PC swedish  frozen meatballs.  There are 64 in a pack (just the right amount and size) and I threw them in frozen and simmered for an hour.  I was making quite a few other appetizers, and it was nice to have one sooo easy.  I poured them out over rice, and the family thought I had made the meatballs, they were so tender.
If you don't mind more work and a little better taste the Pineapple sweet and sour meatballs are better, but this takes the cake for fast & easy!!

these weren't bad, but they weren't particularly great.  we usually use the chili sauce and grape jelly recipe also and decided that we prefer them that way.

Ever since I made this recipe for an annual Christmas party several years ago -we get asked to bring it every time!  I usually use grape jelly.  Also - kick it up with 1/2 cup or more of Frank's Hot Sauce - we love it that way!

I give this a 3 because I make another version of this that has the ingredients to make it a 5. Try adding a cup of grape jelly, crushed red pepper, and garlic powder to give it some personality.

Not impressed. I thought it sounded like an excellent recipe but found out that the chili sauce actually tastes just like ketchup. Much rather have had something closer to chili sauce or bbq. I think I'll keep the cranberry sauce and replace the chili sauce with bbq next time.

We have made these in my family for over 40 years so it's not such a "new twist" but can tell you from experience the sauce is delicious! Have only ever done with homemade meatballs but can't see why if in a pinch, frozen would work. Great done in a slow cooker or just to keep warm.

These are always well received and I usually bring them to 4- 5 gatherings a year..... I use the frozen meatballs because they are fast and convenient....everyone always asks me if they're homemade....sometimes I tell the truth ;))

I also add 1-2 TBS brown sugar and always use the Cranberry Sauce with the whole berries....YUM!

I had to say, I had my doubts. Cranberry sauce mixed with chili sauce? Ewww. But OMG, these are so good and so easy! I was sick and exhausted over the holidays and we had company coming. I had to think of something good but that required minimal energy- these were it! They went over extremely well with my family.

Yum. Perfect for my holiday party. And my husband is PICKY. He didn't even want to try them. Once he did I saw him eat at least 10 during the party!

Love, love, love this recipe. This is so easy. I make it every year for our Christmas eve family gathering, double the batch and there is never any left. I usually put everything in the crockpot for 4-6 hours on low until well heated and then turn to warm. I've even made it with the grape jelly and it is great too!

These were good, but I found that there was no bang to them. I had never tried heinz chili sauce and maybe I was expecting something more spicy and not so ketchupy. I think this is a good base recipe but I would like to add maybe some sweet chile sauce next time and or a chili garlic sauce.

I added a package of chili seasoning mix and it was perfect. I also used whole cranberry sauce instead of jellied.

I'm giving this recipe 3 stars because this is the base for a 5 star recipe that I received from a friend. I know this is an odd combination but these meatballs (homemade or frozen) disappear quickly. Add 1 pkg. of onion soup and 1 can of drained and rinsed sauerkraut to the cranberry and chili sauce.  Heat in a slowcooker for 3-4 hours on low.  A Holiday must in our house.

Great Recipe; however, try using grape jelly instead of cranberry jelly for a change - and - I use the frozen meatballs, but I first brown them with onions. Excellent!

I just made this for dinner tonight.  I got the recipe from a co-worker and she told me to use grape jelly.  It still was great!  I had some frozen leftover meatballs and my crock pot..couldn't have been easier!  I boiled up some fettuccine, added some alfredo sauce and used it as a side dish.  The kids loved the flavor of the meatball sauce mixed in with the alfredo!

These are a winner.  SUPER EASY and TASTY!  I actually made the meatballs in advance and froze them.  The day I was going to use, I put everything in the crockpot and served them right out of there to keep them hot.

Simple and wonderful. It was especially great with turkey meatballs.

And why stop at parties? I think this will be my go-to quick, tasty snack when I'm in a rush.

This was OK but for the best meatballs, add Uncle Yammy's Grillin Sauce

Had a good flavor, but we all thought they were too sweet.

I followed this recipe to a t and I was disappointed with it. I read other reviews where other people added other ingredients and I would highly recommend doing that instead of just using the chili sauce and cranberry. You might want to consider using bbq sauce and apricot jelly instead.

They were okay.  I much prefer using BBQ sauce and grape jelly as a meatball combo.  I think after trying this recipe, I will start adding chili sauce as well since it adds a little zing, but the cranberry sauce was a "fail" in my opinion.

These were a hit with my husband and kids. I did tweak it a bit by adding 1 T of grape jelly to the sauces. I also cooked these in the crock pot.

Tasty.  I liked these better than the grape jelly version.  They have a tangy flavor.

This is a good twist on grape jelly meatballs. I did like these, but I think I like the grape jelly/chili sauce mixture better.  Either way, they are both good and just too easy!

I made my own meatballs for this recipe using ground pork.  My husband said he thought it was an odd combination for the sauce but I put the meatballs in a slow cooker with the sauce and took it to a Christmas Eve party.  I made about 28 medium size meatballs and they were all gone in a short time.  I would recommend making your own pork meatballs as they are very good with this sauce.

I made these for Thanksgiving doubling the ingredients so I could also add a package of smokies.  Everyone loved them!  This is a dish that will have to made again at our house, and not just for a holiday.

Wow, these are great. I used the frozen meatballs and they were perfect. Can't wait to try them with homemade meatballs. I will be taking these to my next potluck dinner.

These are great and I have made them so many times, as most have said they are a hit and you will have none left. The difference I have added to make them even better is a can of Sauerkrat. Its hard to believe but they are even better!!!

Made these last night for my guests.  They were a hit!  I ran partially out of the chili sauce so used ketchup for the remainder of the 12 ounces needed along with a squirt of hot sauce for a kick.  Delicious!

Nothing bad, nothing great.  I made these today to take over to our neighbor's New Year Party.  Maybe they'll like them better then me.

These are always a hit.
I'm on Weight Watchers, so I use turkey meatballs, add a little garlic and some finely chopped onion....never have even 1 left before dinner.  Maybe I should serve these as dinner ;-).

These meatballs were terrific!  I just combined all ingredients into a crock pot, using turkey meatballs I bought at the grocery store, and let them heat up until my guests arrived.  Perfect, and a big hit!  Definitely a keeper.
