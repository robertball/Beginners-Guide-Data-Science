Really tasty!  Cooked my own chicken & made broth...used a whole fryer, lots of celery, tarragon, salt, pepper, onion, poultry seasoning & garlic.  I froze the leftover broth for another time.  Awesome with homemade garlic bread & a salad.  The cheese really tops it off!  I used 1 and 1/2 boxes of the spaghetti.  This is a keeper!

This was absolutely delicious! If you're a bell pepper lover like I am, this is a must try. I used yellow and orange bell peppers but will make it with yellow, orange, and red next time I make it :) Also, it makes a lot of pasta so there is definitely enough for 2 meals! I would also highly recommend using 1 pound or 2 chicken breasts. 1/2 pound is not nearly enough. Overall, great and tasty dish. I highly recommend it!

Very good - used Barilla Plus bow ties instead of spaghetti and Parmesan instead of Romano cheese.  This recipe suits my family perfectly!  Very healthy, love the Barilla Plus pasta!  (Oh, and for the chicken I used part of a rotisserie chicken, saved the rest of it to use for sandwiches in our lunch).

This dish had a great flavor. The only thing change I will make next  time is to increase the amount of chicken  broth and cheese.

My family asks for it all the time, only I changed it slightly to make it saucier.  I added about a cup of half & half with about 2 Tablespoons of flour to it for more "gravy".

The recipe states 1/2 lb of chicken.  I added about 1 lb of chicken and barely had enough for 3 servings.  Lastly, a second pan to partially cook the chicken, that was just 1 more pan to wash!
The chicken broth did add something to this recipe. Will not make again.

This is great recipe. I used sweet mini peppers and omitted the been peppers. I also used regular noodles and added a teaspoon of Italian seasoning. I also used left over roasted chicken I had on hand, it made for a quick meal.

I give it 4 stars with the following changes.  Even with additional cheese, pepper and garlic powder, the dish is still bland.
Next time, I will add cooking wine, thicken the sauce a little and add much more garlic.
Also, it is way too much pasta for the amount of sauce/topping.

I took the advice of others and used a 1b of chicken. I also added some extra chicken broth because of the additional chicken. It turned out a bit creamier than I expected. Next time I will use the recommended amount of chicken broth. For extra flavor, I also used some Cajun spice on the chicken. My husband loved this! I will definitely make it again.

I put more chicken (whole breast) than what was described in the recipe and cooked about 250 grams (~9 oz) of spaghetti. I didn't have any broth available so I had to skip it. Still turned out pretty well though.

It was delicious!  I used parmesan cheese because I didn't have Romano, but it was great and my kids loved it!

My husband and I both loved it.  Hubby asked to add it to rotation.  I didn't have the Barilla plus, so used plain spaghetti, and substituted Bovril's Chicken Bouillon concentrate in 3/4 cup water.  I halved the spaghetti and peppers (used one each red, orange and yellow Bella MINI-peppers - from Costco), but the rest of the recipe stayed intact.  The romano and cracked black pepper makes it! Be sure to let the results sit for about 10 minutes to let the spaghetti soak up the broth tossing periodically to ensure the mixture coats all of the spaghetti.  I served with more grated fresh romano and cracked black pepper (and of course a glass of chardonney).

amazing!!! we didn't have chicken broth or the cheese in the pantry.  We used chicken tenderloins, and rice noodles. it's the peppers, garlic, onions and Balsamic vinegar that make it amazing! Put it over your favorite noodles. Easy enough for my 13 year old son to cook (with a little supervision).
