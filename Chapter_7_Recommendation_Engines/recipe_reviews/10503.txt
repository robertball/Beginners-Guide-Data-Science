wow!! this recipe made amazing biscotti!!!  i had my doubts from when i slipped it into the oven until i took it out.  i wasn't sure how to shape it very well and i thought that it was a little too moist and wet, especially for something that would soon turn crunchy. but...after the second baking, it was crunchy and delicious!!!! this is the second time i've made biscotti, and this recipe turned out MUCCCHHHH better than the first did. i also halved this recipe to just try it out first and used only 2 eggs, which turned out great.  i've now made it twice, the first, a hazelnut version with frangelico and a second almond version with amaretto.  both were very delicious!!  i dipped these in melted chocolate.. delicious dipped in coffee... now i'm addicted! i'll be making them whenever we're running low so we always have them!

I have experimented with several biscotti recipies, but this one is my favorite. They are VERY hard and crunchy, perfect for dipping into a latte, and are essentially fat free. I typically half the recipe, but instead of using 3 eggs, I use 2 eggs because the dough would otherwise be too moist.

This is an easy recipe and oh so delicious! You can also improvise. Omit nuts and add chocolate to half the dough. Roll out two separate rectangles of white and chocolate dough, place one on top of each other, roll jelly style, bake roll and slice.

I really enjoyed these cookies because they're on the hard side and crunchy.  I think what makes this authentic and traditional is that the recipe doesn't include butter or oil.

Don't follow the metric measures, they're totally wrong. Mine ended up too liquid to form a biscotti. The end result was a disaster.

This recipe is excellent!  I've made it several times, substituting whole wheat flour for the white, and Amaretto and almonds for the Frangelica and hazelnuts.  It's one of my new favorite recipes.  Thanks to the owner!

I fixed this for an Italian themed dinner party.  It turned out great.  I must admit I did not have hazelnut liqueur so substituted Orange liqueur.  We dipped them in Franseca 10 yr aged tawny port.  Enjoyed by all.Will do again.

Mmmmmm... SO DELUMPTIOUS!!! (Delicious + Scrumptious  = Delumptious!)  
The dough spread awfully flat, and I couldn't manage 2 rectangles on one cookie sheet.  I used almonds and amaretto liqueur (no hazelnut liqueur available).  Also, I didn't use 2 Tsp almond extract, only 2 drops (the European extract here is much more potent).  Can highly recommend this great, easy biscotti recipie.

You might need a little extra flour as this dough can be sticky but the end product is wonderfully delicious!

These are great, the dough is supposed to be sticky so I don't think I would add more flour. Just use a little cornflour or rice flour to shape them. Also I'm really confused about why some reviewers keep referring to this recipe as "virtually fat free" and "containing only good fats from the nuts", there are 6 eggs in this!!!!

Very good recipe!  I followed it exactly and my dough was VERY sticky- like cake batter rather than dough- so I added about 1/4c more flour and then poured half, the dough onto a parchment lined cookie sheet and did the same with the other half of the dough and quickly threw them into the oven before I could freak out too much.  They cooked up beautifully and tasted great at that stage!!  Then I cut them and put them back into the oven for 20 mins. and when I pulled them out, some of the bottoms had burned.  What I'll do next time is turn them over 1/2 way through the second bake and maybe cook them at a little lower temperature. BTW, I used almonds because that's what I had on hand. Thanks for a good recipe!

I can't believe how good these are!!  The only fats in them are good fats from the nuts, and since I used whole wheat flour, I think I can call them healthfood!!  And they were easy too!!  I love this recipe!!!

This was my second attempt at biscotti and they turned out soooo good! Even my husband liked them, and he hates biscotti. Was a bit worried when I put the dough onto the baking sheet as it was very ooey and gooey. Was afraid it would spread but it puffed up a bit in the oven and cooked out just right. Didn't have the hazelnut liqueur so used a chai liqueur instead and still turned out great. Thanks for the recipe, it was just what I wanted!

This was my first attempt at Biscotti & it came out great! I don't think it was as hard and crunchy as Biscotti is supposed to be, but it was still very good. I could not find Hazelnut Liqueur so I used Caramel liqueur instead. With or without dunking, my co-workers seems to enjoy them!

What went wrong?  A very sticky, loose dough.  Basically, I just plopped 2 globs on the cookie sheet and hoped for the best.  They did come out looking pretty good  and so I sliced and baked.   I needed to do the 2nd bake for about 30 minutes, flipping them every 10 minutes.  Some were still a little soft in the middle but I took them out anyway.  When they cooled some were quite hard but they did taste really good.

I loved this recipe just the way it is, but the second and third time I made it, I changed various things and the base recipe stood up to all my fooling around beautifully. It's very important to really beat the sugar and egg mixture with an electric beater till the mixture is very airy, light and fluffy. In one version I added some melted butter to make the biscotti a bit less hard. In another version I didn't use the hazelnut liquor and used almond, vanilla and a touch of anise instead only with almonds, lots of them, chopped coarsely. In another version I also added some chocolate covered cherries which I chopped into quarters. The point is  the base recipe is superb and strong enough to take a lot of innovation. Oh yes, and I found that beating one egg white with some sugar till it starts to thicken and turn white and brushing this over the uncooked loaves, makes a lovely crunchy sweet glaze.

My husband loves this recipe because they are strong enough to dunk but soft enough to chew. Must follow directions exactly, except I have used hazelnuts, sliced almonds, or chopped walnuts, all from store-bought bags with good results. I have been using this recipe for over ten years. I prefer adding an extra tsp of almond flavoring & omitting the liqueur. I originally did that due to guests who could not tolerate alcohol in any amount/form, but liked it so much that I’ve stuck with it. Thank you, Rosina, for posting this recipe!

Been looking for a good Cantucci recipe for a long time & this is it!  Easy to put together although pretty sticky dough, as mentioned by others.  I used  Amaretto & traditional whole almonds.  Great texture!  Next batch I will try unbleached flour & a bit less sugar.  Will also form more (skinnier) logs for the traditional, smaller biscotti.  Be sure to let baked logs cool before cutting.  Other than my personal taste - this recipe is outstanding!

Don't try this recipe with the metric measures:  4cups flour and 2 of sugar  DO NOT translate to 250 and 200 as given. I should've noticed this and the critical review below.

I wasn't a fan. I really missed the butter flavor that many other recipes provide. The flavor lacked depth.
