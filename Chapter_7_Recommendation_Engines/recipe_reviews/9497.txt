This recipe was super easy to put together and had excellent flavor.  The only draw back was dipping the peanut butter balls in the chocolate, they were too soft, even after hours of refridgeration.  I finally put the balls in the freezer over night, then worked quickly to dip them into the chocolate.  That was much less frustrating and they looked beautiful when I was done (plus tasted excellent).

Another Buckeye (from Ohio) with a tip... if you have a local cake and candy store, go by melting chocolate for candy such as Merken's chocolate instead of using chocolate chips.  It is creamier and will help with the dipping process.

I thought 4 lbs of peanut butter and 3and 1/2 lbs of confectioners sugar was a bit much so I halved the recipe and still got over 160 buckeyes. The dough was not dry enough and difficult to handle.
It had to be frozen, rolled into balls and refrozen to coat the bals with the chocolate. Then I could only do 10 at a time because the dough became soft again. Thumbs down on this recipe.

Great recipe - however, I just let the butter soften VERY well instead of melting it.  Also, if you 1/3 bar of paraffin instead of shortening to the chocolate while melting, the coating turns out better.

Everyone loved this recipe. We added Kelloggs Rice Krispies cereal to lighten the recipe, and add some additional texture and crunch.

Maybe this worked for some of you, but it's the first time I've made these. The quantity was ridiculous- for an army. I used a double boiler (homemade)the chocolate never got thin enough, the peanut butter balls wouldn't hold together and use a toothpick? Huh, maybe if they were frozen instead of refrigerated. To the chocolate I added more butter, then some water, made about three dozen, threw some undipped ones away, threw the chocolate away, froze the rest of the 200 or so balls and might try some other kind of chocolate dipping sauce, or the dogs will have peanut butter treats.

First off, for all you people complaing about the quantity, you can adjust the quantity. Secondly, I thought these were great and easy. My boyfriend LOVES them.

This was very yummy!!!  As said in other reviews, the balls were hard to form, so I coated my hands with flour every coulpe of balls and it made it sooo much easier.  I put the balls in the freezer over night and took them out when I was ready to dip them in chocolate.  I also melted the chips minus the shortening in the microwave at 50% power for 30 seconds at a time until it was melted.  I will make these again and again!!!

The quantity is large, but easily adjusted. Heck allrecipes does it for you.  Freezing the balls before dipping is a must and take the time and money to go to your llocal craft store and but a dipping fork. Mine cost me under $2.00. It takes the stress out of the dipping process. My Girl Scout troop made these and gtave them to their families last Christmas. FTR, we made four batches as the recipe is written. I have a huge troop.

Super Easy!  Buckeyes themselves are a bit time consuming, but overall it's an easy recipe and I get raves and requests for the recipe all the time!  I gave out small tins of these for Christmas and everyone LOVED them!  Once you remove the toothpick, you can dot your CLEAN hands in water and tap each top, it'll "erase" the hole mark to make it look more authentic.

So easy! I cut the recipe in half and took the suggestions to freeze the balls with toothpicks, first.  They tend to get soft quickly if you don't.  Highly recommend this recipe.  Thanks!

Unless your cooking these for an army, half the recipe.  They taste like reeses, which I love, so they taste good, but alittle goes a long way.  They are VERY sweet so make your candy balls smaller than suggested. My turned out rather messy looking but they still tasted ok.

Very good. The mushy balls that people are having problems with can be easily remedies with more powdered sugar. Funny..last yr mine were all crumbly not mushy. We use natural peanut butter with the oil at the top. I modified the recipe quantity as I only had 3 jars PB. So my recipe went something like 3 jars PB..2.5 baga powdered sugar,2/3 cup melted butter. I mix it with my hands as it is impossible to do any other way. It felt a tad dry so I added a TBS more butter..then a bit wet and added a handful of powdered sugar. I was then able to roll them into balls immediately and they are in the fridge now until dipping. It is just a balance between the sugar and the PB. Not a big deal. I think the brands of both that you use may influence to a slight degree the moisture. As I was rolling them my 3 yr old daughter at 3 balls without the chocolate and asked if these were for "everybody" I sadly told her most were going to the neighbors. I will make another batch in a few days. So simple! The modifications are endless. I put some cinnamon in my batter. You could do crunchy PB,cocoa powder with with white dipping chocolate, nuts, raisins, rice crispies, mini chocolate chips. On top sprinkles in the color of your choice, nuts, graham crackers,coconut. Again endless. It reminds me of fudge only more time consuming with the rolling. Have fun. get creative!

Quantity was WAY off, and I found that parafin works much better that shortening.  It helps get a nice firm chocolate coating and freezes much better (if you have any left to save!)  It is an exceptionally easy recipe but VERY time consuming.

These are delicious, and I think very easy.  I froze the balls before dipping them (they are extremely soft when rolling them) - and actually prefer to eat them frozen. I added some sprinkles to make them more visually appealing for the holidays! Delicious, and I know they will not last long in my house!!!

Honestly, the method for dipping in chocolate is awkward. I was going to give them to friends as part of my holiday cookie bake, but I passed.  Other than the look, the balls are pretty good. I made them with a mix of walnut and cashew butter instead of peanut. Next time definitely will add walnut liquor in the mix to improve flavor. In terms of richness and smoothness they were delicious. I mentioned briefly about the dipping in the chocolate with a toothpick being awkward. Why not simply dunk them all in the chocolate? Also, make the balls smaller - about the size of a cherry. Any bigger makes it a two-bite deal, and then the melting chocolate makes a mess in your fingers. I made some smaller and bigger, and trying to eat a bigger one at once was way too...buttery.   Still, I'd make those again with the few modifications listed.

I just made these because they sound and look so yummy however the dough melts in my hands.  I can't even roll them into balls.  So I have 4lbs of P.B. sitting it the fridge.  So I would NOT make these again.

These were delicious, but very hard to work with. Even freezing the peanut butter mixture, it would melt in your hands in no time. So, I spread some of the chocolate mixture in a 9x9 casserole dish, froze it, then spread the peanut butter mixture and then topped it with the remaining chocolate mixture. Refrigerated for a couple of hours then cut into bite size pieces. Also stored them in the fridge! This worked well and was very good. Thank you for sharing!

The only problem with this recipe is the quantity it makes. They are fantastic but there were so many! I ended up taking them to church, giving them away, and making gifts from them. An excellent recipe though. Will definitely make again (but half the recipe).

I make this recipe every Christmas. I love it! When the peanut butter is too soft, I find that adding extra confectiner's suger and some flour helps, along with refrigeration for a few hours. :) I usually dip the whole peanut butter ball and drizzle the top with extra choclate, white chocolate, or butterscotch to give it more of a truffle look. :)

These are great and always disappear quickly. Make sure you adjust and recalculate the serving amount because the recipe as it is makes a ton. I always cut it in half or even more. I did like others have and cut down on the sugar in mine. They were still easy to handle and plenty sweet. I always up the chocolate dip part of the recipe a bit so I have plenty and it is easy to dip them all. Plus you can use the extra chocolate dip for other things like cookies, nuts, etc. These are yummy!

This recipe is amazing.  All of my kids loved it..in fact I ended up having go make four batches last christmas, they wouldnt stop eating them.  We dipped the whole ball into chocolate just not half.  I ended up freezing them and then taking what I needed out.  I would recommend this one as its now our holiday favourite.

Very very good. However, I cut the recipe in half because it was really big. I might not next time because they went pretty fast.

I halved this recipe because I didn't want 144 buckeye balls.  Possibly this is why this recipe almost turned out to be a complete waste of ingredients?  The peanut butter would not form into balls even after freezing the mixture.  So to salvage my mess, I did an ingredient search on this site and found a recipe that included 2 cups graham cracker crumbs.  The crumbs thickened up the peanut butter and we were able to roll them into balls!  They were a hit with my husband and kids.  When I mentioned that I would not be making them again next year, my husband emphatically insisted I do!  (Also on a funny note, my 4 year old nephew loved these and kept asking for more "eyeballs")!

Wonderful. I made mine dime size which worked well. I also used Gulf Brand parafin wax - seems to work better than shorting. Laura Scudder's peanutbetter works better than some of the other off brand kinds. Imperial Marg (2 sticks) is what I used instead of butter, which might have helped the mixture be perfect for rolling. In some of my batch I added super crushed vanilla wafers - made it not so strong for those that like a lighter taste of peanuts.

Being from Ohio - these are a necessity to know how to make!  For the peanut butter, try using half creamy, half crunchy.  Very nice texture.  I found this out by mistake when I didn't have enough creamy peanut butter to make the batch.  Now I can't even eat them without the crunchy peanut butter being in there!

I've been making this recipe every Christmas, for years.  It's really easy and everyone I know loves them!  I used the scaling function on the recipe and scaled back to six servings which was plenty... 12 might be good if you plan to give them as gifts.  YUM!

Quick, easy, and the lowest amount of butter I found for this taste.  Don't listen to how to melt the chocolate!  Melt your choc chips in a metal bowl over a low boiling pot of water (constantly stirring).  Enjoy.

Hmmm not sure where i went wrong here.  I read the reviews before making this recipe and decided to cut it down by a 4th because I did not need a big batch.  I left the peanut butter mixture in the fridge 3 hours then a 1 hour in the freezer.  It never became hard enough to roll into the balls. Just a sloppy mess.  I was so excited about these and so disappointed when they didn't turn out.

Wow! The recipe stated it made 48 buckeyes or 24 servings. It made over 300. They were very tasty, but way more than I needed and took so much time to do that many. Next time I will scale it down by at least a fifth.

I made these over the holidays at the urging of my 7 year old niece.  (She said she wanted to make them because she liked saying 'buckeye balls'!).  They are great, although very sweet.  They need to be mixed by hand - my Kitchenaid pro mixer couldn't handle the amount of batter and caused a mess!  It takes a long time to roll them and long time to dip them.  I froze them after rolling them and did not have any problems dipping them in the chocolate.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I will battle with this recipe no more! For years I have struggled and cursed every time I try to form the peanut butter mixture into balls and then again when dipping in chocolate. The ratio of peanut butter to the butter and sugar is wrong and it makes a soft, sticky mess. There are other recipes on allrecipes that call fo twice the butter and sugar which makes a very manageable mixture. These recipes also add vanilla which rounds out the flavor and cuts the "bite" (for lack of a better word) of the peanut butter

I LOVED these. It made a ton, but I still had to make it twice last month due to demand at my house. :)I would suggest enlisting help rolling the peanut butter, or you will be there for hours and hours. ;)

For some reason this recipe didn't work out too well for me.  The balls didn't get to the right consistency even after adding almost a whole extra box of powdered sugar.  I've had buckeyes almost every year, but this was my first time making them myself.  Perhaps I did something wrong, but I don't usually have that problem.  I'll try again next year :)

I have made these many times and everyone loves them. I also have done a modification to the recipe by substituting Jack Daniels for the butter and the adults love them. A little hint the longer they stay in fridge the stronger they get.

As others have mentioned, I only made a half recipe and still had about 8 dozen balls. The dough seemed a bit dry but still held together well. I left them in the fridge for about 90 minutes and they stayed hard enough during the entire dipping process. Don't know that I'd use this recipe again, but they turned out okay.

Made 72 balls with 4 kids. Ours weren't buckeye balls, they were reindeer poos as we made them for Christmas! The kids loved it! They are sinfully good. Everyone who's tried them has asked for the recipe.

This recipe was great! I think I made the balls a little small and I ended up getting about 15 dozen. I stored them in the frezer in individual bags of 12. Great Christmas gifts that everyone loved! Thanks for the recipe!

This was a big hit over the holidays.  It has been voted in as a permanent addition to the christmas cookie list.
