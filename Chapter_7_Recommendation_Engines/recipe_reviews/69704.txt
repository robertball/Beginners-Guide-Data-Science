Perhaps it's because I enjoy sweet drinks, but this wasn't all that tasty.

Not great. Tasted like gin and strawberries. The flavors just don't seem to go well together. I wish I could give it a higher rating because it's so pretty and I really like gin, but I can't say I'll be making this again. Thanks anyway for posting.

Sweet and simple, best served in a smaller 9 oz cocktail glass. Would want dental floss along for those seeds though!
