Perfect, perfect, perfect. I love to bake, and have tried many different coffee cake recipes. This is the best one, by far. After I made it, my boyfriend loved it so much that he invited his friends over to have some. They finished it, and came the next day 'demanding' for more!
It is incredibly moist, absolutely amazing flavor and texture, and very easy to make. I prepared mine in a Bundt pan and covered the top with almost all of the cinnamon brown sugar topping. Then, I took it out as soon as a toothpick inserted came out clean. After it baked and cooled for a bit, I flipped it out brown sugar topping DOWN onto a serving platter, and drizzled the now bare "top" with the icing and sprinkled it with the remainder of the cinnamon brown sugar topping. Delicious.

I  Really like this recipe. I made it for a board meeting brunch and it got rave reviews! The only thing that I changed was the topping. I made a struesal topping using...

1/2 cup Brown sugar, packed
1/3 cup All-purpose flour
1 tsp Cinnamon
1/4 cup Butter
1/2 cup Pecans, chopped/roasted

What made me love this recipe was the fact that I could put it together the night before but still have that freshly baked cake that looks like you have been up all morning making it!

AMAZINGLY DEFIANT CAKE THAT REFUSES TO SUBMIT!

Even though I managed to completely mangle the topping, which then became a hardened shell that made the cooking time take an additional 30 minutes and likely steamed some of the cake, the finished product was still a moist cake and flavorful cake. The Topping, well, that was cracked off and trashed leaving me with a topless cake, but a moist and sweet cake all the same. Worthy of 5 stars wholly, because despite operator error, it still managed to produce a moist and delicious product.

I didn't think this was dry - but i did (can't help it!!) make a couple yummy changes - I sliced fresh pears onto the top before adding my own streusel made up of butter crumbled with brown sugar, oats, a bit of flour, cinnamon, crushed pecans or walnuts, and nutmeg.  I also use half whole wheat flour in place of one cup of the white flour - adds depth and a bit more nutritional value... yummy, yummy!!!

I have gotten called really rude names by the women in my office for bringing this cake in---IT IS DELICIOUS!!!!  It is also gone, as we speak.  It's insanely moist (I did put a little extra sour cream).

We've used this recipe for years, always with great success.  I'm particularly fond of this for Christmas morning brunch with a sausage casserole.  You make them both the night before.  Put them in the oven as you open gifts, and enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!

This is the first coffee cake I have ever made.  It turned out great!  I brought it to work this morning, and it has gotten rave reviews.  I did not refrigerate it over night.  I don't know if that makes a difference...it was still excellent.  I followed the recipe exactly, topping and all(except the overnight refrigeration part).

I assembled this coffee cake last night with several minor changes.  I substituted cinammon for nutmeg.  I used low fat sour cream.  Vanilla adds so much flavor to baked goods that I add it to everything I bake whether it calls for it or not.  I didn't measure the brown sugar but I'm quite sure I used closer to a half cup and it was plenty.  I baked it this morning and it was done in 35 min.  It smelled wonderful.  I took it to a class and the ladies really seemed to enjoy it.  I omitted the confectioners sugar at the end to save calories and it didn't need it.  The topping has a wonderful crunch and that's really what makes the cake.

I made this for the guys I work with on Sunday morning.  I went out to work my shift and came back to get a piece and it was all gone!  They absolutely loved it.  It was fresh out of the oven when I brought it to them.  I did use Ducky's topping instead.  Thanks!

This recipe was an OK cinnamon coffee cake but nothing outstanding.  I did add one very ripe banana to the cake part (to get rid of it) and liked the addition.  I also added about 4 Tbsp of butter and 1/2 a cup of oats to the topping and liked that as well.

This is incredible! I get compliments every time, but here is what I do different:  I add a touch of milk to the recipe and I do a crumb topping that includes butter for the top... I also have baked in within a couple of hours instead of letting it sit overnight and it still turns out moist and delicious!  thanks for the recipe!

really good coffee cake, but I would give it 4 1/2 stars, because the "amazing pecan coffee cake" recipe, even though quite similar, is the ultimate perfect recipe. This one, for some reason, has a bit of of a strong baking soda taste according to my mom. Very moist and great texture and flavour though! thanks!

This was pretty good for my first coffee cake. I had no nuts in the house so I left them out, but next time will definitely use them. I would've like a little denser cake, but it's a good base recipe.

Nice addition to our Sunday breakfast!  I cut the recipe in half (love that calculator), and used cinnamon instead of nutmeg.  I also added peeled, cut-up apple - I was a little leery of adding it the night before, but it worked out just fine.  Because of time constraints the night before, I made the topping the next morning while the oven was preheating.  I goofed and did not take the coffee cake out of the 'frig until I was ready to add the topping and pop into the oven; I checked for doneness after 40 minutes, and needed to add 5 minutes to make sure it was done, but it turned out great!  I also skipped the drizzle - it was plenty sweet for us.  My husband has already requested I make this next week - I think I will try adding pears, and use ginger instead of the nutmeg.  And I know that I will try this with cardomom sometime in the near future!  Again, another super starting point for a tasty dish!  Thanks -

OMGosh!!! This was so simple and so yummy. I'm in a cooking club and I brought this for my dish and everyone went crazy over it. I felt so silly because I didn't do much work. It was so moist and the topping was perfect. I didn't change the recipe at all. Will make this again, and again and again. You get the idea. Thanks for sharing

This cake is delicious and easy to make. I didn't make any changes and it came out perfect. Mornings are always hectic with a big family and to be able to put this together the night before and bake it in the morning is a blessing. Thank you for  the recipe- it's a keeper.

Delicious and easy.  I followed the recipe with the following exceptions:
1. Subbed 2 cups flour for 1 cup whole wheat and 1 cup unbleached white
2. Did about 2/3 tsp nutmeg and 1/3 tsp of cinnamon in the cake

Love this recipe.  Easy and everyone at my work loved it!

Made for Christmas morning and there wasn't a crumb left. Increased topping by half because of amount of nuts I had and didn't make glaze, it is plenty sweet enough. Definitely adding to permanent collection!

Everyone at work loves it when I bring this in.  I reduced the nutmeg to 1/4 tsp, and I add 1 tsp cinnamon to the cake batter.  I also add 1/2 tsp vanilla to the icing.  Awesome flavors!!

As others have said, this makes a very moist tasty cake. The topping however was much too sweet for my taste (and I actually used less of the drizzle on frosting than the recipe called for). The sweetness made this taste much more like cinnamon rolls than coffee cake. Very yummy, just too sweet for my taste. I will make this again with much less of the brown sugar topping and use frosting drizzle sparingly.

Delicious! The only change I would make next time is to increase the nutmeg just a little. The cinnamon in the topping tasted fantastic, but kind of masked the wonderful nutmeg flavor. The texture was perfect and it looked beautiful.

This cake is simply amazing.  I made half the recipe and baked it in an 8x8 dish for 4 adults and two very young children and it came out perfectly.  I will definitely be making this for company or brunch potlucks in the future.

We LOVE this coffee cake!  It was so nice to assemble it the night before and have a warm, delicious treat for breakfast in the morning.  It's so moist & delicious!  I used 3/4 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup vanilla yogurt (b/c I ran out of sour cream) and it turned out great.  We opted for pecans and thought the topping was FANTASTIC!  I ommitted the glaze on purpose and decided that the cake was perfectly sweet enough.  The flavor of nutmeg is a little strong when serving right after baking, so may cut back on that next time (1/2 tsp - 3/4 tsp).  I like nutmeg, so it did not bother me, but others may find it overwhelming.  The next day, it tasted even BETTER and the flavors were perfect!

This was very good.  I used only 1 egg and added a little over a tablespoon of applesauce.  I also added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the batter.  It had a different topping than coffee cake, not the typical crumb topping but it was still very yummy.  My husband said it needed more glaze but what the recipe calls for covered the whole cake and I felt it was enough.   This was so delicious, half the pan was gone because my husband and daughter went for seconds.  I am definitely going to make this again!

I'm only giving this 4 stars as is, because I agree with those who say the nutmeg should be cut in half. It's easy, moist, yummy, but the nutmeg is overwhelming. I will make it again though. This would go over well at my office.

Yum!  This cake is awesome!  So moist.  I made it exactly as directed, but I added extra cinnamon and left off the icing.

Followed recipe as is with the exception of cutting back on the nutmeg to 1/2 tsp and added cinnamon instead--I love cinnamon.  The coffee cake was super moist even days later.  This was a huge time saver to prepare the night before and bake in the morning.  I will make this again!

I made this the night before Christmas Day. I was a little disappointed that this cake came out so dry. However, my husband loved it and requested I make it again so I'll give it another try, tweaking the dry ingredients. The topping was delicious, and I appreciated a make-ahead recipe on a busy holiday morning.

I made this for New Year's morning, because my granddaughter wanted "cinnamon rolls" and I didn't feel like going to the grocery store, one more time.  After reading the reviews, I decreased the nutmeg to 1/2 tsp and added 1 tsp cinnamon to the coffee cake.  I also used half all purpose flour and half whole wheat flour.  Next time (and there will be a next time) I will use the suggestions about a streusel topping; a little less sugar and a little more flour / oats would be good.  The grandkids all loved it!  It also kept well (what little was left) until we could finish it off the next morning.   Thanks for the great recipe!

Great recipe and great cake! Made this for our teenagers at church but left out the nuts because the majority of kids won't eat them. That was the only change that I made. the cake is very moist!

Delicious! I didn't let it sit in the fridge overnight (I really wanted to eat it!) and it was still delicious. The only thing is that I didn't have sour cream, so I mashed 2 bananas which I then mixed with some milk & butter, and added that instead. It worked perfectly! Best Coffee cake I've ever had.

I leave out the nuts but other than that, I make it just as written.  You don't have to wait overnight to bake but it saves a lot of time for me since this is a go-to recipe for holiday mornings in my home.

This is a very good recipe. It's a little much on the brown sugar/cinnamon topping, but otherwise perfect. I made it the night before and then when we woke up I only had to put it in the oven. I would recommend this recipe only not so much topping. It is a very easy cake to make. Enjoy!

A very nice, simple and easy recipe.  I wanted to follow it exactly - but did not have sour cream. Used 1 C of french vanilla yogurt instead - turned out wonderfully.  Will definately make again when in a pinch and do not have fresher ingredients for zucchini coffe cake, etc.

One of the best coffee cakes I've had/made. This is my first time making coffee cake and this was so moist it was perfect! I added one cup wheat flour to one cup of all purpose. Was not very bold to change too many ingredients but will porbably do some experimenting the next time. Maybe substitue the eggs with bananas?

This coffee cake would have been A LOT better had the nutmeg been reduced or totally left out-it is overpowering! Other than that, the recipe turned out really well, and I made it exactly as stated.

This turned out great! I made it the night before and the only change I made was to use allspice instead of nutmeg. It was super duper tasty. The only thing that didn't turned out like the picture was the icing. Even after 15 minutes of cooling, it just sort of melted into the cake. But it tasted awesome and my mom said it was the best coffee cake she's ever had! :)

Fantastic!  I changed the spices to half nutmeg & half apple pie spice in the cake (just for personal taste).  It was great.  My husband ate almost half of it!  This recipe will definitely be part of my brunch rotation.

This is a wonderful recipe!  The cake is very light and fluffy.  Not dense at all, which is how I like it. I LOVED that I could take this out of the fridge in the morning and shower while it cooked.  It felt like a real treat coming downstairs to fresh coffee cake! I followed the directions exactly.  The only thing I would change is use 3/4 cup pecans instead of 1/2 cup.  However, I just really like nuts, so that is purely a personal preference.

This was really good. Only change I made was I accidentally added the sour cream at the last minute because the recipe was unclear. Additionally, I added a bit of coffee (subsituting some of the water).

Thanks to this great recipe my first time making coffee cake was a great success. I made these for a play date at my house and the mom’s loved them.  I did make a few changes to make them healthier.  I substituted the white sugar and brown sugar with the Spenda versions of each. I also did not put in the nuts.  They turned out great.

The only change I made was I used 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and only a third of the icing which was plenty. I also was a little concerned with some reviews about the topping which was not the consistency I was expecting. There's alot of brown sugar. I patted it down some into the batter. I guess because I did this, the topping around the edges of the cake "disappeared" into the cake. I guess that's why you should listen to the directions! Having said this, it is unbelievably moist and delicious and if you want to be the bell of the office, get up early and pop this in the oven!

Great texture  great consistency - great recipe.  The only thing I would do differently is alot less nutmeg.  The one teaspoon of nutmeg is way, way overpowering.  1/2 teaspoon would be just about right.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was AMAZING!  Don't be afraid of the dough it is very sticky and you think you have done something wrong, but you haven't.  So good!

I'm so thankful that I found this recipe.  I've made it several times and it's always so moist and delicious.  Such a time saver, too.  I do take a knife and try to swirl the topping into the batter, just a little.  If not, sometimes the topping will separate from the cake, when cutting/eating. Thanks for posting!  :)

I don't believe this is the ultimate coffee cake recipe, however, it was very good. I added a little cinnamon to the cake part. I was disappointed to see that the brown sugar topping came off the cake during cutting. If I made it again, I might make more of a streusel topping instead. Icing was good. I added a little vanilla and almond extracts to it for extra flavor.

Simply amazing.  We love cinnamon, so I jacked that up for the topping.  I don't think I'm going to get a chance to taste it cold, as 20 minutes out of the oven, it's already 1/2 gone!

This was really, really good!  To make it a little more healthy, I used 1/2 c. applesauce and 1/4 c. butter.  I also cut down on the nutmeg a little bit, I'd say I used 3/4 t. and only made half the icing and that was plenty.

I mixed the ingredients on a Saturday, to bake on a Sunday for a Monday's bakesale at work. Well, I dropped it off at the fundraising sale at a dollar per piece and came back in about an hour later and the entire CAKE WAS GONE! Mind you, there were tables and tables of other goodies to choose from, but this coffee cake I baked was missing - pan and all. Well, it turns out that a Partner at my firm bought this entire cake and brought to share at a meeting - it was THAT GOOD! So while I didn't get a chance to try this myself, the fact it dissapeared in its entirety speaks for itself! 5 stars for convenience and obviously popularity!

This was great! And SUPER easy. Took less than 10 mins to prepare and used ingredients always on hand. I halved the recipe and did it in an 8X8. I did fresh ground nutmeg and just grated it right into the bowl, didn't measure, but definately used less than called for due to the reviews of it being too nutmegy. Used slivered almonds and a dash of allspice in the topping. The topping coats it well and once coated I pressed it flat.It kind of melts into the cake, but stays nice and crisp. Next time I might make individual muffins. I skipped the icing and it was plenty sweet without it, but it would probably look fancier with it. It was a wonderful desert, but could also be used for a breakfast or brunch dish.

I made this for Christmas morning and it was wonderful! I used a bundt pan and put a layer of brown sugar, pecans, etc. in the center and then again on top (which ultimately became the bottom).  It was delicious and I will definitely make this again.

This was excellent. A wonderful MOIST coffee cake. I usually don't care for coffee cake because some can tend to be dry. This tasty cake was any thing but dry. Mine was the first pan to be emptied at our church Christmas breakfast. I did have to increase the cooking time by about 10-12 minutes.

To prepare this cake the night before is a wonderful bonus if you are entertaining, one less thing to worry about!  This cake was quite heavy but I think that is how it is supposed to be, the flavor was delish.

Perfect exactly as written.  I had to use 2T of cinnamon because I had no nutmeg.  I also used some  cinnamon in the topping.  We like things cinnamon-y!  It was a wonderfully, fast breakfast treat.

Really good coffee cake!  It's not really a labour-saver, you're just off-loading the work to the night before, and this is more work than I usually put into morning dishes.  Still, for a special treat, it's probably worth it.
I left out the nutmeg (don't like it) and used a tsp. of Lorann's Buttery Sweet Dough emulsion (available through King Arthur Flour, but you could just use vanilla).   I was worried because my batter was quite thick - I had to push it to the edges of the pan with a spatula, and then it didn't come up very high in the pan.  But it rose beautifully in the oven.  Just great cake!

FABULOUS recipe!! I brought this to work for a food day and it was gone within an hour. I had so many people come up to me wanting the recipe. The only small tweak I made was to mix half a bag of cinnamon chips into the cake batter and mix the other half of the bag into the topping mixture. So easy and delicious!

This basic coffee cake was really good, I didn't have nutmeg so I used pumpkin pie spice and it turned out great!  Everyone loved this.  I'll definitely be making it again!

Absolutely wonderful! Made it as written except I omitted the nuts because I don't like nuts in my baked goods. It was moist and quite tasty. I left in the fridge for about 20 hours and it still baked up nicely. This recipe is a keeper.

This was good. I liked making it the night before and then just throwing it in the oven. I followed directions exactly. Next time I might do 1/2tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp cinnamon in the batter. The cake was moist. I think one could 1/2 the topping and it would still be sweet enough.

Very good! I think instead of walnuts though I'd use pecans the next time. I didn't think it was overly sweet at all. But then again I like super sweet coffee cake. It kept well too. My husband and I continued to eat it for breakfast all week.

delicious! I doubled the cake part and kept the topping the same...I prefer cake to icings, and it helps it last longer in the house. My hubby barely saves me two bites!

I work in a busy specialty specialty office. I was trying to reproduce a coffee cake a patient had brought in. I found this one and it was given rave reviews. I was told it was better than the one the patient had brought in. I initially made the 1st one with reduced nutmeg due to reviews however, I couldn't taste it so I made it again with the whole 1t. nutmeg and it wasn't overpowering at all.   I had to share this recipe with several people and when I bring another one in this AM I expect it too be devoured as quickly as the last one.  Very tasty recipe!

Very good and moist. I didn't have sour cream so I used vanilla yogurt instead. My husband thought the nutmeg was too strong, but I liked it. That's why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars. We didn't make the icing and it was still really good!

Made this for my Bridge Group and it was wonderful. Read the reviews and only added the 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and it worked out great. Highly recommend this recipes. PS--Instead of cinnamon I accidently added Apple Pie Spice instead and it worked out fine. Enjoy

This was really good.  I made it exactly as directed and it was very moist and had good flavor.  It was better after it cooled down.  The next time I make it, I will wait longer than the suggested 10 minutes to put the icing topping on as I feel it melted in right away and didn't make a nice topping.

This was delicious! Although I did not wait overnight to bake, it still turned out very yummy. I also only used 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg, but in reality I could have used 1/4 tsp or no nutmeg at all.

WOW this really is an amazing recipe - I took it to a staff meeting today and everyone raved about it, and lots of requests for the recipe. I used light sour cream, freshly grated nutmeg (about 1/2 tsp) and made 1/3 of the icing drizzle (and it was plenty). The 13 x 9 inch pan worked great for me. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe, Cindy.

This recipe is foolproof!  I didn't have the exact amount of butter and only one egg and it still turned out.  The only thing I might change is using a little less nutmeg next time.  I will definitely use this recipe again and I am excited about experimenting with different nut on top.  It's great because you mix everything the night before and then bake it so that it is fresh in the morning for breakfast.  I am not a morning person so it was nice to have something already in the fridge that I could pop in the oven.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is the best coffee cake! I followed the recipe pretty closely except I only left it in the fridge about 7 hours or so and I added about a teaspoon of vanilla to the powdered sugar/milk topping. It is sooo good. Will be making again very soon.

Oh my gosh! This was SO good!!  I made two of these last night and sent one to work with my husband, and brought one to my MOPS group.  Both were gone in minutes and I got rave reviews from everyone.  I will definitely be making this again.  It might even replace the cinnamon rolls I make every Christmas morning.

Really enjoyed this one.  I was in a rush so I baked it right from the mixer and thought it was wonderful.  Just be sure to let it cool the 10 minutes before adding the powdered sugar topping.

I made this recipe as written, only I did not refrigerate the batter overnight.  I baked it immediately.  I can tell you that it is amazing.  Simple.  Like grandma had done it herself.  I think next time, I will make it with an almond topping and add a little almond extract to my glaze. Thanks Cindy for the recipe.  Killer good.

Delicious!  I have made it lower fat by substituting half the butter for applesauce and using low fat sour cream.  Always turns out great and everyone loves it.  Mmmmmmm!

Wow, this coffee cake was delicious! I split the recipe in half and baked in a glass pie dish. I also used all whole wheat flour instead of white. I took some other suggestions and halved the nutmeg, I don't really know if it was necessary to do so, but I will keep the full amount in next time. Thank you so much for sharing! Will make again

I'm not giving this 5 stars because the nutmeg is way to much.  I make a few changes: I've used oil and butter with the same result, fat-free sour cream and plain fat-free yogurt with the same result, I decrease both the nutmeg and salt to 1/4 tsp, add 1 tsp vanilla, & use half brown sugar/half white sugar (which I LOVE) and I bake it for 30 minutes.  I definitely like it better with the glaze!  It keeps well and actually seems more moist after a couple of days.  I've even made spice cake with this recipe by (making the above changes) and adding allspice, cinnamon & chopped walnuts to the batter, then frosting it with cream cheese frosting -very good!

This was amazing!  I chose it because it called for sour cream - which I always have on hand - rather than buttermilk, which I never have!  I'm so glad I did.  It was moist and delicious.  I did sprinkle a light layer of huckleberries before the struesel just for fun, and I skipped the icing drizzle, but I got several compliments on it.  I love having a new overnight coffee cake recipe!

Great, easy, no clean up the next day.  I used standard strussell topping, probably will dbl that amount, reserving 1/2 to add in last 10-15 minutes of cooking.  Also, will half the drizzle amount.  Don't forget to take out 30 minutes before putting into the oven. Fantastic, could become a weekly thing for my family.  !!!!

I was really craving coffee cake last night so I decide to give this recipe a shot. This is the best coffee cake I've ever had. I didn't have any butter, so I used Country Crock. I only had about a 1/4 cup of white sugar left so I used brown sugar for the rest. I left out the nuts for the topping, baked it in a 8x8 pan for an hour, left out the icing and it came out AMAZING. It's even better the next morning. I can't believe how moist it is. I'm going to try it again with real butter and all white sugar.

Outstanding recipe.  We had our family Christmas Saturday and 10 stayed over.  It was so nice to have the coffee cake ready to bake the next day.  I heard lots of "this is really good" comments. So it was a big hit - no left overs!  Thanks so much for the recipe.

I recently made this coffee cake for a brunch for a group of women.  My guests loved it and several asked for the recipe.  I happen to love nutmeg--so much so that I would probably add more the next time I make it.  (Not that it's necessary...just a personal preference.)  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Excellent and exactly what I wanted. I didn't add the icing and I thought it was wonderful that way.  The pecans were an especially nice touch. I will roast them a bit next time to add a little more crunch. Very good and so convienient for my Thanksgiving breakfast.

I’ve made this about 30 times. Huge hit at work! I cut the nutmeg by half and use a tsp cinnamon. I’ve even messed up and put the brown sugar in the batter instead of the topping and it’s still delicious! You cannot go wrong with this recipe!

I decreased the white sugar to 3/4 cup.  I rated that 3.5/5 because it was WAY too sweet.  Next  time, I will try half of the brown sugar/cinnamon mix and not add the conf. sugar/milk glaze.

What a great coffee cake recipe! It was easy to put together, the cake was very moist & the crumb topping was crunchy & sooo good! I added 1 teaspoon vanilla extract to the cake batter and about 4 Tablespoons of cold butter to the crumb topping. Assembled the cake and left it in the fridge overnight. Baked the next morning & it was absolutely amazing! This is my new favorite recipe, thanks Cindy!

This was fantastic, way better than I expected. I made it exactly as the recipe was written, except that I used freshly ground nutmeg so I'm not entirely sure exactly how much of that I ended up with. I was very leery of the topping - brown sugar, nuts and cinnamon, really? I usually do a streusel topping. DON'T change it, give it a try, it's really way better than you'd expect. I'm not sure what the whole overnight refrigeration thing did for it, but it made Sunday morning breakfast a little easier. Great recipe, thanks very much.

I guess I'll give this one of my rare five-star ratings. I'm not particularly fond of coffee cake - I rarely have it, but I'll eat it. I made this exactly as written, except that I had to lengthen the baking time to 45 minutes because the "toothpick test" failed as 35 and 40 minutes. I don't know what the standard is for coffee cake, but this tasted great. Better yet, I ate the whole thing myself, and leftovers, reheated in the microwave briefly, were almost as good as fresh, a week later.

Okay, don't go CRAZY trying to make this more moist because some people thought it was too dry.  I added a 1/4 extra "sour cream" (I always use plain greek yogurt for sour cream, fine for baking), and about 1/4 apple sauce.  I also substituted 1 and 1/2 cup powdered sugar for regular sugar because I just didn't have sugar.

Here's what happened: the weight of the applesauce dragged the dough down and the texture is off - it's dark and dense (but cooked) and didn't rise as well.  It TASTES good, though I would recommend adding some vanilla to the batter.

ABOUT THE DOUGH: the dough for me was getting quite stringy and sticky when mixing, like bread dough.  I think it's supposed to be like that, but it panicked me.  Don't panic!  

All in all - decent flavor (adding a banana or vanilla would improve it!), gorgeous rise to the cake, and the topping is okay.  May have been helped with a more traditional strudel!  Have some milk nearby, it's decadent!

This recipe is really great!! so moist and yummy! The only thing, and this is why I give it 4 stars rather then 5, 1t of nutmeg was wayy too much for me! I know it doesnt sound like a lot, but thats all I could taste while eating this cake. actually I didn't eat anymore after 2 pieces because the flavor was too strong. I suggest cutting it in half, twice. Other then that everything else was perfect!

This was so good! It brought back childhood memories of Sunday morning breakfasts. I only make this as a special occasion treat because it's like eating dessert for breakfast.

Wonderful Coffee Cake that was a hit at the office.  This is a super moist cake and the crumble topping is perfect!  I loved the fact that I could make it up the night before.  Definitely a keeper for holiday mornings!  One co-worker's comment, "the only way this could be any better is with a glass of milk!"  =)  Will definitely bake again!

Followed the recipe exactly. My family all loved them and I didn't even get a chance to have any myself! Looks like I'll have to make them again. But next time I will use walnuts instead of pecans, just a personal preference.

Followed recipe exactly as is. Made this to send to work with the hubby. I did cut out 1 small slice before I shipped it off - very very good! Hubby dropped it in the break room when he got to work, when he came back it was completely GONE. Said everyone was saying how good it was. Will make again for sure!

What a wonderful recipe! I made it for a birthday brunch for my daughter, and everyone loved it. It's so convenient to be able to assemble it the night before. I think it would be fine even without the icing drizzle which is the only thing you have to make in the morning. Thanks so much!

This recipe turned out well, but it did not seem quite as outstanding as others reported it to be.  I agree with one other reviewer that there is too much nutmeg.

I've made this recipe twice. First as stated, and it was a bit on the sweet side. The second time I used brown sugar instead of white, added 1tsp vanilla, added the cinnamon with the nutmeg (I love nutmeg so I didn't feel it was overpowering), left off the topping but kept the icing. I liked this better.  This is an EXTREMELY moist cake.  I'll make this again if I don't have a lot of time in the morning, but otherwise I'll stick with Betty Crocker's Cowboy Coffee Cake which I grew up on.

My husband wanted coffee cake as a special Christmas morning treat and having never made coffee cake before I was searching for the perfect recipe. Well, this is it!! It was so easy to make and I loved the fact that I could make it the day before which meant less for me to worry about the next morning. Since Christmas I have made it at least 6 more times, each with awesome reviews from my audience. I definitely recommend this recipe...you won't regret it!

Great recipe! Got rave reviews from the Marines I made it for today too. I needed something that I could have ready super early this morning and preparing it last night was perfect and it baked while I got ready.

THANKS!!

Delicious! The only change I made is to use whole wheat flour (only because that's what I typically use for baking). It's delicious! My husband, who never had "real" coffee cake before (only Entenmann's!), loved it! I took it to a brunch today and it was a big hit.

Absolutely moist. Followed instructions for cake to a T. Changed the topping to exclude the nuts. Very delicious.

Definately too much nutmeg, it overpowered the coffee cake.  I will try this recipe again with only 1/4 to 1/2 t. Although I loved the convenience of making this a night before, I think most coffee cake recipes could be done this way.  If I make this again I will try adding strawberry jam under the crumb topping or perhaps chopped apple, it seemed like this recipe was missing something.

I made this for friends the other day and as stated in the recipe, it really works overnight! I was so suprised! I did change the crumble topping a bit (personal preference and trying to get rid of some oats), but stuck to the recipe otherwise and it was wonderful. The nutmeg added a nice depth to the flavor. Thanks for sharing.
