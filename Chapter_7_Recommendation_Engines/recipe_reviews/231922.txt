I added a 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 4 or 5 mushrooms.  It was delicious

The easiest risotto I've ever made. And very tasty. I usually use recipes as a starting point, though, In this one I substituted a cheap but drinkable  Sauvignon Blanc for the cooking wine and shallots for the onion. But it looks like you can't lose with this one!

Good flavor but cooking time was a little off, I had to extend the time because my rice was "crunchy" after the given cooking time.

Good recipe as written, but I agree with other comments about it being bland. I made it as written except I left out the lemon rind because I didnâ€™t have any on hand. Next time I will increase the wine and probably add some mushrooms. I served over some cooked chicken and it made a pretty good one dish meal.

It was quick and easy, but pretty bland. I wouldn't make it again.

Next time I make this I will cut the vinegar to 1/2 cup and add1/2 more broth.  It was easy, and done in the allotted time.
