Absolutely EXCELLENT!  I glazed mine with a mixture of 1/4 c. softened butter, 1/4 c. lemon juice and 2 c. powdered sugar.  Also, I had to increase the baking time by 10 minutes.

Be careful when buying your cake mix - if you get one that already has pudding in the mix it will take considerably longer to bake. The top will get quite brown, but cook until the batter no longer wiggles when you nudge the bundt pan.

I took this to a party and everyone raved about it! I changed the baking temperature to 350 F and added a lemon glaze (2 TBS fresh lemon juice, 1 tsp grated lemon peel, and 2/3 cup sifted powdered sugar whisked together and drizzled over warm cake after it cooled 10 minutes and I removed it from the bundt pan.

I've never rated a recipe a "1" before, but this deserves it: it's nasty. I LOVE lemon and was so excited to make this cake from all the great reviews. Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed by the recipe. I'm blaming it all on the soda. I used Sierra Mist, but I doubt Sprite or 7 Up would have created a better result. The whole cake had this weird chemical taste ... ugh, like I said, nasty. My advice is to modify "Lisa's Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cake" recipe using lemon cake mix and pudding mix, omitting the chocolate chips and adding a couple tablespoons of lemon juice. I did this the day after making this disgusting cake (because I was REALLY craving lemon cake) and it turned out simply delicious.  No chemical weirdness, MUCH moister than this cake because that recipe uses sour cream, basically, just a million, trillion times better. I don't know how ya'll loved this so much, but i STRONGLY recommend using that other recipe instead!

This cake got rave reviews, especially for the fact that it is very moist. I added fresh raspberries around it and in the middle then made a lemon glaze which I poured over the whole thing, then powdered sugar. It was very tasty, I have never tasted a lemon cake I liked as well. If you like lemon cake, you'll love this!

Since I used a yellow cake mix, I added some grated lemon zest and about 1/2 tsp. lemon extract to the batter. Even tho' it was very good, I thought it was a tad too oily and next time would reduce the oil to 1/2 c. I made a glaze of the juice from one lemon, and powdered sugar. Can't wait to try this recipe using a white or yellow cake mix, vanilla pudding, root beer and root beer extract!

This cake turned out moist and delicious because I read others opinions about a potentially chemical taste I became worried. When I did my toothpick test to see if it was ready the uncooked portion tasted chemically. I made 3 other different cakes for my party and never put this one w the others. two days later I figured I taste it before throwing it out.  The cake was delicious! With the soda and all I followed the recipe exactly, so I'll go with the majority, it is perfect try it yourself. Oh I didn't even have icing!

I reduced the oil to the cake mix amount of 1/2C.  I think 3/4C of oil is way too much.  I added some poppy seeds (personal preference to lemon cakes)but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  When I tested for doness at 35min.  The cake FELL.  Completely flattened!  Thats the first time EVER that has  happened to me. So at 35 min. the cake was not done but very brown.  I baked another 20 minutes for doneness. Please note that the bake time is 325 but I did a 350 oven for almost an hour.  Also, this has an artificial lemon taste and has NO tangy Zip taste of lemons. Needs real lemon juice instead of the carbonated drink that I believe is leaving a bad tingly after taste in my mouth.  Sorry but thumbs down to everything about this recipe.

Wonderful-I've made this recipe a dozen times already and everyone I know asks for it at every party. I have found the cooking time extends about ten minutes. Don't use mountain dew- I just tried that and it changed the taste dramatically as well as the texture and color. Dew has more sugar and caffine so I found sprite or 7 up is best. I always top it with a cream cheese icing- Blend 4T fresh lemon juice, 4 oz cream cheese, and 2 cups powdered sugar until smooth- drizzle all over cooled cake. Add thinly sliced lemons around the edges on your cake plate and voila! Beautiful.

This was really good and I don't really care for lemon. My mom loved it.  She's the lemon person in the family.  I did have to bake this a little longer that listed but its still good.  I am making it tonight for a coworkers birthday.  Will add some lemon juice and a little lemon zest to the batter to make it more lemony.  I also topped mine with a glaze made of powdered sugar and lemon juice.

I used a yellow cake mix, and added a little lemon extract because I didn't have a lemon cake mix in my pantry.  I baked it in a cake pan with a daisy design all over it.  I sprinkled powder suger over the finished product.  It is beautiful, and my picky kids love it.  It is very moist and the flavor is great.  Angela

Easy, good and moist!  I cut on calories by substituting melted light margarine for the oil, Sprite Zero for the soda, and sugar-free pudding mix.  It turned out wonderfully.  Thanks for sharing!

A good lemony, moist cake.  My husband loves this cake and it is so easy to make.  Actually, this recipe (minus the soda) is on the Duncan Hines lemon cake mix box.  I leave out the soda and sometimes add a little fresh lemon juice and zest.

This is such an awesome cake..I get more requests from friends to make this than any other...an easy glaze that I use is 2 cups powdered sugar and 2 tablespoons (or more if you want it thinner)...It's such an easy cake to make and I guarantee you will not be disappointed!!!

I am rating this based on the change of oil to 1/2 cup. It was perfect with the change. It was not heavy but not super light, instead the perfect crumb for a bundt cake.  I did use vanilla pudding with the lemon cake as that's what I had on hand. I will be making this again. My grandma was in love with it. I topped it with vanilla glaze from this site.

I really loved this recipe. very easy and it came out so moist and fluffy. I also baked it longer than the recipe said, a little less than an hour. I used a box of lemon supreme mix instead of yellow cake mix, egg substitute and diet 7UP with splenda. I iced it with chocolate icing and it was delicious.

I had a lemon cake mix in my pantry that was getting pretty old, so in an effort to use it up and get rid of it, I made this recipe.  I did as another reviewer suggested and cut the oil back to 1/2 cup.  I also added about 2 T. of poppy seeds.  I finished the cake with a glaze of confectioner’s sugar, lemon juice and lemon zest.  Very good, nice and moist!

I had didn't have all the ingredients for this cake when I started.  However, it came out better than I thought.  I had used banana pudding and black cherry soda, and I threw in some cherry liquer to the batter.  Wow!  Very moist!  Topped w/ cherry liquer glaze.  Will make again w/ other flavours.

If this could get more than five stars I would give this 10!
If I am going to have lemon cake I want it to taste VERY lemony..and this hit the nail on the head. And moist-YYUMMMM! I glazed it with 2tbsp lemon juice, some lemon zest, and about 3/4 cup conf sugar mixed up.  I took a poultry brush and after pouring on the top I brushed it all throughout the cake for a nice even glaze.  Added a sprinkle of conf sugar too.  The only change like everyone else was the cooking time.  More like 50 minutes and I turned the oven to 350 around the 40 minute mark.
Can't wait to make for others.

Super moist, super easy and everyone loved!  I used diet Sierra mist because it was all I had and was worried after reading some reviews that the cake tasted like chemicals.  It did not and was delicious!  I used "pudding in the mix" cake mix so I upped the temperature to 350 degrees after reading some reviews that it did not bake well at the lower temperature. It was perfect and everyone loved it.

My husband loved it!  He said the best cake I've made.  Hey... I make a lot of good  ones.  I followed the recipe exactly, I used diet  Sprite.  I think I would add some lemon zest the next time if I have the lemon.  lI made a glaze with  2 Tbls.  lemon juice , 3/4 cup powdered sugar  and I think a little water. (someone else's suggestion with the cake)  It has to have the glaze.  It is so easy.
My friend said it is even better the next day or two.  She raved about it also.  Oh bake at 350  for 50 minutes  I used a silicone  bundt pan.

Followed the recipe and then glazed it.  It was delicious and did not last long at our house. Very to make.  Did stay in the oven for about 55 minutes.

I thought this tasted a little bit "artificial". I think I might try melted butter instead of oil if I make it again (but not 3/4 cup!). One thing to remember with recipes like this that add ingredients to a cake mix is not to use a "pudding already in the box" cake mix since you're adding more pudding it can end up heavy and gummy.

Excellent cake!  Very moist and light.  I only had to bake it between 35 - 40 minutes.  (I've read that bake time using a Bundt pan depends on the color of the pan; white-finish, light or dark metal.)  I used a "Cheater's Glaze": melt a half can of lemon frosting in the microwave for 30 seconds and then using a teaspoon drizzle over the cake.  A garnish of fresh raspberries in the center of the cake looks great.

This is very good and moist!  I had a really hard time finding lemon cake mix, and when I finally did it was a 15 oz. box, but I left the rest of the ingredients the same and it came out fine.  This had great lemon flavor but I like it a little bit stronger so next time I'm going to add some grated peel.

Awesome! I actually found Lemon Sanpellegrino soda and it worked great. I made candied lemon peels from this site and from the simple sugar leftover incorporated it into a glaze. topped the cake with the candied lemon peels.

The cake was moist, delicious and very easy to make. To increase the lemon flavor I added 3 TBS fresh squeezed lemon juice 1 tsp lemon extract and the zest from 1 large lemon. I also made a glaze using confectioners sugar, lemon juice and lemon zest. I combined the ingredients, whipped it up until liquified. I poked holes all over the cake with a fork and poured the glaze on the cake. FABULOUS! I took the cake to work and everyone raved that it tasted like a delicious lemon cake like Grandma's back in the day. Will make again and again!!

Such a delicious cake.  Could have been more lemony...definitely add a simple lemon glaze.  I also added 10 minutes to my bake time but I was cooking 2 in my oven at the same time.  Next time, I might add some fresh lemon juice and zest to the cake itself for a little more zing but t is so moist and delicious just the way it is.  Ours was devoured in one day.

Absolutely delicious!!!  I have made lemon bundt cake and NEVER before has mine ever been this incredibly moist and delicious.  I used Mountain Dew and the frosting glaze as suggested by another person (4oz cream cheese, 2 cups confectioners sugar and freshly squeezed lemon).  I did not detect a chemical residue as stated by others rating this recipe, maybe cooking it for 50 minutes helped out?  The cake was gone within a day.  I will certainly be making this again.  Thanks.

This was the easiest of all the Lemon Bundt Cakes I have attempted, very moist and satisfying, this is now my signature cake and the suggestion to dribble with melted vanilla icing completed this dream of a cake.

I made this for my company's Christmas potluck.  It turned out absolutely fantastic - 7 people asked for the recipe.  It was VERY moist.  I have made it twice since then upon request.  I think it is best made the night before & absolutely needs a glaze.  I just used powdered sugar and the left over Sierra Mist soda.

This is a *very* moist cake, and very yummy.  I did have to cook it about 15 minutes longer than shown.  I just cooked it about 5 minutes at a time beyond recommended time until the toothpick came out clean.  I made it for a brunch and everyone loved it.  I planned on using a glaze, but ran out of time.  As it turns out, this cake doesn't need it.  I will try the glaze next time for that extra lemony kick.  Will definitely make again.  So easy!

Absolutely fantastic, followed recipe, though it took longer to cook, but that was okay.  I found a lemon creamcheese glaze recipe from someone else that reviewed this recipe and the combination was to die for.  Everyone loved it.  Great recipe!

This is the best lemon cake ever! It is moist and delicious. I have made several times and it always turns out great! To glaze it, I use 1/4c of lemon juice mixed with 1.5c of confectioners sugar.

I cheated and changed it up a bit based on other reviewer's suggestions... Instead of 1 c lemon-lime soda, I used 1/2 c water & 1/2 fresh squeezed lemon juice, and I reduced the oil to 1/2 c. The cake was so moist with perfect lemon flavor. I lightly glazed the cake with a few Tbs of store-bought frosting and everyone loved it!

Great easy recipe but thought it was a little too oily. Would use this recipe again but cut back on the oil. I topped it with lemon icing that I created using fresh lemon juice and confectioners sugar.

Easy cake to make and tastes very moist. I made the cake according to the recipe but added poppy seeds to the batter. For a glaze I just added 2 tspns lemon extract to a container of Vanilla icing I popped it in the microwave for 30 seconds just to soften it and drizzled half the container over the cake.
Thanks for a great recipe!

This was fabulous.  Using sugar-free products will produce a chemical taste.  If you are going to use a cake mix, you might as well use the regular soda and pudding because the calories are going to be there regardless.  Also, adding premade instead of fresh squeezed lemon juice will alter the flavor. I've made twice now and had great results both times.  My girlfriend tried to "diet it up" and got the chemical tasting problem.  Make it as directed and there shouldn't be any problems...you might have to add 5 or 10 minutes to the cook time though!

I let this bake for appx 50 minutes and then use a glaze of 1/2 stick butter, 1/2 cup sugar and 1/4 cup fresh squeezed lemon juice. Let the cake sit overnight before serving so it can soak up the glaze. The glaze overcomes any artificial flavor.

This cake tasted great and was so easy to make.  I added 2 tablespoons of poppy seeds since I'd been craving a lemon poppy seed cake for a while.  I used Mt. Dew brand soda which worked out great.  You do need to add some extra baking time, I did 15 more minutes and my cake was perfect.  It is so moist and melts in your mouth.

I made this today and thought it came out quite well.  I also made a glaze.  I did make a few substitutions though - sugar-free pudding instead of reg. and diet soda instead of reg.  Also used a new "healthy" fat oil - "Enova".  None of these seemed to make any difference in the texture or flavor.  It was still moist and good.  I would have liked it to be even more "lemony" though so when I make it again I will add some lemon extract to the cake.  I also like the idea of adding poppy seeds - so I may do that as well.  Definitely good enough to make again!

It was very good BUT too much oil!  I was surprised your recipe called for so much more than the yellow cake mix box which calls for 1/3.

Got rave reviews from this at work which made up for the cooking time goof in the instructions. It wasnt even close to being done after 35 minutes. Put it in for another 15 and was perfectly done. So incredibly moist!

I am not a fan of box cake but this cake was surprisingly delicious.  Made it for a New Year's Eve get together and everyone thought it was very good.  This recipe is far better tasting than following the recipe on the box that calls for water. This cake taste even better the 2nd day.

THE BEST!!! Let cool in pan for 15 minutes. Invert on cake platter & top with a glaze: 1 c. powdered sugar, juice of 1 large lemon, & 1 T. water. (whisk well to get rid of lumps) I use a pastry brush to get all the sides of the cake. So moist & everyone loves it. Try the glaze- you won't be disappointed!

This cake was so good - very moist and great flavor. Like others I melted a can of lemon frosting and drizzled it over the top and presented it with a dollop of cool whip with fresh strawberries. Very nice presentation and excellent flavor. My husband couldn't wait to eat the leftovers after company left! :)

This recipe is awesome. I am used to eating bundt cake with a glaze, so I mixed powdered sugar with lemon zest and fresh lemon juice and poured it over the cake. I have had many people ask for the recipe.

Unbelievable! To brighten the flavor, I added the juice of one lemon and one lime. I then made a glaze of 1/4 cup fresh-squeezed lemon juice and 1/2 cup sugar (heated till the sugar disolved). Add the glaze while the cake is still piping hot, and it'll soak right in, making this already-moist cake even more luxurious. Dust it with powdered sugar, and it's every bit as beautiful as it is tasty. I only wish there were more stars to award this cake!

This was a great cake. It is so moist. I increased the temp to 350 and only had to bake the cake for 43 min. It was perfect.

Fantastic, people who normally do not complement..complemented!! They said it was the most moist and best flavored lemon cake they have had. I had to adjust the cooking time and temperature a little because of the quick browning and I added a lemon glaze. Turned out perfect!

Great recipe I used a silicone heart shaped pan as I made this for Sunday dessert. I also put blueberries on the top with a little sugar over them.  Lemon and blueberries accent one another.

So delicious! I used Sprite and added 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. One big change I did was using vanilla pudding mix instead of lemon. It was amazing and disappeared in a flash!

I made this recipe today and loved it - the box cake mix was only 15.25 oz though, so I added 1/2 cup bran flour (only kind I had on hand). I baked it for 45-50 minutes and after it cooled, glazed it with a mixture of lemon juice, milk and powdered sugar (I didn't really measure) and it was quite delicious!

This cake was delish!  I didn't have lemon pudding, so I subbed vanilla pudding and added a tsp. of lemon extract and it turned out fine!  Also made a glaze using 1 cup confectioner's sugar, about a tblsp. milk, and 1 tsp. lemon extract.  Next time I will make sure I have fresh lemons on hand so I can use the zest and juice instead of the extract.  Also, as with many other reviewers, I had to cook mine for about 50 min.  My family raved and that cake was gone in 2 days flat!  Will def make again.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Delicious, and so easy.  I made a simple glaze with the juice of one lemon and confectioner's sugar until I got the consistency I wanted.  I also increased the cooking time by 10 minutes.  Will definitely make again for the holidays!

This recipe is my step father's new favorite recipe.  Only change I made was to substitue 2 tbsp of lemon juice for 2 tbsp of the sprite that I used.  Took about 5 minutes longer to cook in my oven.  Very moist.  Turned out beautifully.

Very yummy cake.  I didn't have Sprite or Sierra Mist, but I did have Mountain Dew and it turned out just fine.  I took others' advice and glazed the cake with a powdered sugar/lemon juice glaze and it was great.  Definitely needs more than 35 minutes in the oven.  I just kept checking it every 5 - 7 minutes until the batter was set and toothpick came out clean.  Next time I might try adding blueberries to the batter for a more summertime seasonal cake.

I did the cake exactly as written, but had to cook for 45 minutes for it to be cooked through - seems to be the general concensus as per other reviews.  It was very easy to make and turned out beautifully.  I rated it a 4, as I put a glaze on it and didn't taste the cake before I glazed it.  It was excellent with the glaze, but I will make it again without the glaze and freeze it in individual portions for school lunches as my kids loved it.  Will definitely do it again.

The only change I made to the recipe was reducing the oil to 1/2 cup as others suggested. It was delicious! I loved that the batter fizzed and foamed when I added the Sprite. Also, as others said, it takes 45 minutes to bake. Thanks!

Fabulous! Everyone loved it, including 3 picky kids! The cake was moist and had the perfect texture. I followed previous suggestions and made a glaze with lemon juice, lemon zest, powdered sugar and just a little bit of milk. Will definitely be making again!

Moist and delicious, but did not come out of the pan all the way (top of the cake was still in the pan).  I think I should have let it cool longer.

I just made this cake yesterday and it was the first Bundt cake I've ever made. It turned out great and everyone loved it.  I used Spray oil that contained flour and sprayed the entire pan really good...I turned the pan upside down on a paper towel to drain any extra oil before adding the batter to the pan (this helps it from getting gummy).  

This is a great Lemon cake recipe.  I also did the Lemon glaze which really brought out the lemon flavor.  Its very easy to make and a nice tasting, moist cake.  I will make this cake again!

I read almost all of the reviews before making this cake, and it came out wonderful. I used 2 suggestions: 1.) I used Mt. Dew instead of lemon lime soda since I only had diet Sierra Mist on hand and 2.) This cake definetly took more than 35 minutes, but I was prepared. It took me approximately 50 minutes. I also used a little of the Mt. Dew and powdered sugar to make a glaze, that worked out well too. I did no detect a chemical taste like other reviewers had mentioned. I'm thinking that this basic recipe could work with almost any liquid and a box cake mix, like for example a chocolate cake mix and maybe a cup of brewed coffee. I think I'll try that one next. Thanks for a great recipe!

My family can't get enough of this cake.  This will be the only lemon cake recipe I ever use again.  I made it with Sprite and did not have "chemical taste" as other reviewers said.  Very moist and yummy!

I give this four stars instead of five b/c of directions.  I did a little "research" and discovered that the person posting this review must be using a dark or coated cake pan for baking (whatever that is).  I think most people use either glass or metal.  I used a metal bundt pan and according to the cake box directions, you're supposed to bake at 350 (not 325) for 38-40 minutes.  You only bake at 325 if you have a dark or coated baking pan.  I too had to add on some extra cooking time.  I haven't served it yet, but I did sneak a taste, and it's wonderful.  I plan to add a cream cheese icing w/ lemon flavoring.  The cake itself is very moist and sweet, but not too sweet.  I do not taste any "chemicals"  as others did, and I just used regular Sprite.

I made this cake for Mothers Day, it was a huge hit. Instead of using a bundt pan I used two 8" round pans layered with a lemon filling and frosted with a cream cheese frosting. It was so moist and had great flavour. I will only use this recipe for lemon cake in the future.

Could not find lemon pudding so added lemon jelly powder to the lemon cake mix. In spite of adding only 1/3 cup of oil, the cake was moist. I also squeezed 1 lime & 1 lemon into the mix before baking.Very good cake - thanks for sharing.

This was a quick, easy cake I made for my husband to take to work.  The only adjustment I made was to thin 1 cup strawberry preserves with the Sprite (vs water, since I had some left in the can).  I put half the cake batter in the pan, spread the preserves on top, then topped with the remaining batter.   Mine took 40 minutes to bake.  Awesome cake!  Thanks for sharing!

My husband declared this better than the pudding cakes at the bakery!  It had a great lemony flavor.  I added a lemon glaze which added a slight tartness.  Thanks for the recipe!

I usually bake cakes from scratch but this  box cake concoction is pretty darn good. Absolutely does not need frosting---maybe a dab of cool whip on the side, strawberries or rasberries would be nice too. Cake is pretty light so if you are using a fluted bundt pan be sure to grease the pan well and use a gentle hand upon removal.

Mmmmm! Eating this right now, still warm.  I cut
back on the oil to l/2 cup and added lemon zest.
Glazed while hot with l/4 c. fresh lemon juice, l/2c. sugar, and more lemon zest boiled into a syrup.  Thought I messed it up because I put all the wet ingredients in the bowl together THEN read the directions.  It's great, but beating the
carbonated beverage probably affected it.  P.S.
I made it a second time, following the directions
exactly, only adding lemon zest to the batter.  
As expected, the cake rose better since I didn't
beat in the Sprite.

Wow! This cake is wonderful! I have never made a bundt cake before and was a bit scared it wouldn't come out of the pan but it did *very* easily. I just used cooking spray rather than greasing and flouring, and then right before the cake was done I put a dishrag wet with hot water on the counter and put the cake right on that from the oven for 10 seconds. Then I carefully inverted it onto a baking rack and it came right out, no problem at all. To boost the lemon flavor I also added a little packet of lemon koolaid (just the flavoring, no sugar added) that had been sitting in my cupboards and wasn't going to be used, and that really made the cake *very* lemon-y. I also used Fresca (a grapefruit flavored soda) instead of lemon-lime and it was great- I think any citrus-y drink would work, including lemonaid or even Mountain Dew. Very delicious cake- I'm sure I will make it often.

Excellent cake! Everyone who had it requested the recipe. I served it with whipped cream and fresh strawberries, and it was fabulous! I will be making it again this week, and will add a little lemon zest to make it a bit more lemony.

Very moist and delicious... great lemon flavor. I added a lemon glaze as suggested by another reviewer and it was perfect! I did bake the cake for an additional 15 minutes however. It definitely wasn't done in 35 minutes as the recipe stated.

I made the Lemon Bundt Cake recipe for a dinner party I had last weekend.  It was not only delicious, but super easy to make.  It will definitely be a recipe I will use again and
again.  Five stars for sure.

This cake was wonderful!  I made it for a co-workers birthday.  It was so light that everyone went back for seconds... then thirds!  I have to alter the baking time though.  I baked it for about 55 minutes.

Cake was very lemony.  Very easy to make.  The soda makes it very light.  Delicious just to eat it plain.  It does not need a glaze or powdered sugar.  It didn't last 2 days in my house!

The last piece of this cake could start a fight.  The cake is so delicious that really any vanilla or lemon glaze could work with it.  If you put this out during a party, it will be gone in 5 minutes!  It's a family favorite in my house!

To those complaining of a chemically taste...I wonder if you used Pillsbury Plus  cake mix.  I used to be loyal to that brand, however I discontinued using and switched to Duncan Hines due to the chemically taste.

This cake was easy to prepare and tasted GREAT! It's perfect for when you are craving something lemony.

I did drizzle a glaze made with powdered sugar, milk and lemon extract over the cake after I removed it from the pan.

Amazing...amazing...amazing!!  I am a true baker but work and love to bake for my coworkers. I made this because it was so simple and got wonderful reviews. I used Mountain Dew. It was gone before noon and everyone raved about it saying it was light, lemony and just plain delicious. The icing I used was 1/4 lime juice, 1/4 cup butter and 2 cups confectioner's sugar. Yum! I will be making this over and over!

I made this with butter cake mix.  It was absolutely amazing. I glazed with lemon juice and confectioners sugar. This frosting absorbed into the cake. There wasn't even a morsel left on the cake plate.
Try it!

My cake fell because I didn't pay attention to the type of lemon cake mix I bought (it already had pudding in it).  As others suggested I added a lemon cream cheese glaze and it was delicious.

Holy Cow! This was fantastic!! I used sugar free pudding mix, diet 7-Up, and drizzled microwaved lemon frosting over it.  Because my DH and I love lemon, I also added lemon zest to the mix.  Very moist and was the perfect dessert to snack on all week!

While shopping for ingredients to make this cake, I realized the EXACT same recipe (sans the lemon-lime soda) is printed on boxes of the Duncan Hines Moist Deluxe Lemon Supreme cake mix (Lemon Pound Cake). I went ahead and followed the box instructions and drizzled the cake with cream cheese frosting, and garnished with lemon and lime twists. Beautiful cake, tasted wonderful, and the perfect ending to my Easter dinner.

This cake turned so nice and moist.  I made it for a bridal shower and put yellow roses in the center for decoration.  It got rave reviews at the office.

I couldn't find lemon pudding, so I used vanilla and added the zest and juice of one lemon, as well as 2 t. lemon extract.  It wasn't too lemony, it was perfect, and had a great yellow color.

Very Easy Recipe. Even thou I made a few changes:

 Since I didn’t have Lemon Cake Mix, I used my same old yellow cake mix, added about 4 tbsp. of lemon juice (and since I thought that wasn’t enough flavor I added 1 freshly squeezed lime I had in hand), added the cup of lemon flavored soda, 1/4 of a cup of milk, and to keep the moisture I added a box of vanilla pudding mix. Ok, It wasn’t THAT lemon flavored cake; but I did the lemon Icing which worked wonders and to give it a twist I toasted 1/2 cup of walnuts and add it to the mix.

AND Important!, like I do with all my recipes, I NEVER use oil, I use butter (I cant believe its not butter!®); this time, One stick. 

So in the end, more than a few changes, but if I had all the ingredients at hand, I would have done it like the recipe specified. But still using my handy dandy butter!

Very Good.  I tried my first one with applesauce instead of oil - it tasted okay, but wasn't nearly as good as the second time.  I didn't have any lemon-lime soda with the second one, but I had some Mt. Dew - it was WONDERFUL.  I got lots of compliments on it at my daughter's 12th birthday party.  Will make again.  I did add a glaze to it of lemon juice & powdered sugar.

Really great and it didn't last long at my house!  The only substitution I made was unsweetened applesauce for the oil.  I melted a little lemon icing for a quick glaze.

I paired this cake with Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting (with added lemon flavoring) from this site and it was very tasty.  Cooked mine as mini-bundts in 2 Nordicware Mini-Bundt Pans, sprayed generously with Baker's Joy.  They had a dark coating, so I baked them at 325 degrees for 35 mins.

This cake left a REALLY BAD after-taste in our mouths.  The best way to describe it is "chemical-tasting" like some others have suggested.  I think it's the soda.  I wouldn't make this again.

Not impressed with this one.  The texture was pretty coarse.  The flavor was alright, the icing helped a lot.  I wont make it again.  I have been searching for one to rival the amazing one they sell at Costco (yes, hard to believe).  I guess I will keep searching.

I made this cake for my friend cathy for her birthday at work. Everyone loved it. It was very moist. I baked for 40min (electric oven). although I think I should have only baked for like 30-35 versus what other people on this site are saying. I would just check every 5 minutes and guess the timing on your own. But overall, an excellent cake!!!

I'm giving this one a three...Like others, I found the cooking time to be more than the recipe states. I also had the worst time getting the cake out of the pan. Not sure if it was because I used powdered sugar instead of flour to dust the pan with, or because I used a cake mix that already had pudding in it (I've heard you can use powdered sugar instead of flour, and I didn't use the pudding mix). But as the cake was falling apart, I have to say...the taste was so incredible, I didn't even care how it looked. I had glazed it with a transparent glaze (milk,powd. sugar & lemon extract) and when I went to remove from the pan, only the top half of the cake came out. I'll try this again for sure, but I'll be sure to use a cake mix without pudding and dust my pan with flour!

This is a great cake once you get the baking time right. I baked it at 325 for a full hour. A wonderful dessert, great with a little glaze made of powdered sugar and lemon juice.

Very moist.  Great with a glaze of powdered sugar and a little lemon juice and water.

I made it for Easter and it was a BIG hit!  I made this glaze: Combine 1/4 cup milk, 3/4 cup confectionery sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon lemon extract, stirring until there are no lumps in the sugar.  I poured over warm cake, and it soaked in.  I decided to make another glaze (for appearance) by using 1/2 can of Whipped Vanilla Icing heated in the microwave for 15 seconds, with 1/2 teaspoon lemon extract stirred in.  I think either one would have tasted fine; I just wanted the look of a heavier glaze.

I'm not sure what happened, but when I pulled the cake out to check it after 35 minutes, it "fell"....the middle sank.  I had to bake it about 20 minutes longer.  I'm giving it 3 stars, because the flavor was good, but I won't make it again.

Loved it!  Added poppy seeds to Lemon-Lime soda and let set for a couple of hours before I put it together.  Took the advise of others and used apple sauce and egg substitute to "healthy" it up a little.  Will make again and again and again and ............

To make this a bit healthier, I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the Oil and used 2 eggs and 3 egg  whites instead of 4 eggs.  I used sprite ( not diet) to avoid the diet sugar aftertaste. Had to bake it about 50 minutes.  I used a container of melted lemon frosting for topping after.  Only melt about 15 seconds and wait for the cake to cook before pouring over the top.  All of us loved it and will make it again. Also I did not have lemon zest so just used 1 Tbsp lemon juice.

this smells great & is very pretty, but it's moist almost to the point of being "wet" or "soggy".  i did like it & will make again-- maybe the day before to let it dry out some.

This is a very quick and easy recipe with the end result being a very moist and delicious "lemony" cake.  I sprinkled it with confectioner's sugar strictly for looks as it really doesn't need anything else.

Well, this didn't turn out how I had wished. To 3 of us, this cake was strange tasting. Kinda mechanical. Not sure where that *off* taste came from. One of my daughters did happen to love this cake. I do have to say ~ it was a VERY moist cake and baked wonderfully. I just couldn't get past the funky sour taste it left. I used Sierra Mist as the lemon lime drink ~ maybe that caused it ~ who knows... Thanks anyway!

I had never before attempted a bundt cake and I decided to try this recipe for a party.  I bought a cake mix with pudding in it and had to cook the cake an extra 15-20 minutes.  I was very nervous, but the cake was the hit of the party!  I'm not even a huge lemon fan and I adored it.

Can't say how good this recipe is!!!  I was craving lemon cake one day, made this, and it definately satisfied my craving!  Made a simple glaze with confectioner sugar, lemon juice, and lemon zest...then topped each slice with cool whip.  SOOOOOO GOOD!!!!  Made twice already.  Very easy recipe.

This cake is light and fluffy. The lemon flavor is just right.  I used powdered sugar and lemon juice to glaze it, but it would do fine without it too!

A delightfully refreshing cake!  I glazed with  1/2 cup confectioners sugar, sifted, 2 Tablespoons fresh lemon juice, and 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest.  Nice served with fresh raspberries and a little whipped cream, but equally good all alone.  I had to give the leftovers away because I could not stop eating this.

This is one of my favorite recipes. I love it when you want something different besides the all popular chocolate desserts. Very good for Spring and Summer picnics and occasions. I request this for my birthday every year in May. 
It is very moist and delicious. I melt a container of lemon or vanilla frosting in the microwave 30 seconds at a time stirring in between and pour over the top of the bundt cake. 
Very good recipe.

Quick, easy and satisfying.  I added a little lemon zest to the recipe and sprinkled with confectioners sugar.  A lemon glaze would kick this up a notch.  I will definitely keep the ingredients in my pantry for this one.

I can't even count how many times I've made this cake!  It's always a hit and I'm always asked for the recipe.  It's an extremely moist, flavorful cake and it smells amazing when it's cooking. I add some lemon zest (yellow peel from a fresh lemon) to the glaze for a little extra kick and presentation.  Thank you for sharing this Phyllis!

I have tried this recipe twice with excellent results both times!  I use a William-Sonoma "Rose" bundt pan- cooking time increases to 45 minutes.  Sierra Mist works well for the lemon-lime soda. I also cheat with drizzled microwaved canned lemon frosting. Strawberries and a dab of whip cream add a nice touch, too. Always moist and delicious!

VERY easy and good recipe. Have made this twice in two weeks.  It is much more moist and tastier a day or two later...also I followed the advise of another reviewer and melted some canned lemon frosting in a microwave for the lemon glaze and nobody knew it.  This is an excellent recipe!!

Wow-- what can I say, but that this cake is excellent!  Great tasting and SO moist, it almost melts in your mouth!  For anyone who loves lemon cake, this is it...  I followed the directions exactly, but next time I will add some grated lemon zest for a tangy twist!  Also, I made a powdered sugar glaze with vanilla and water and drizzled it over the top.  My whole family loved it!  I will be making this one again, and again..
I would highly recommend it!

Update: I have tried all sorts of lemon/lime sodas. Here is my all time favorite for a real lemony taste - Presidents Choice Sicilian Lemon Soda. Found it at Superstore. I couldn't believe how incredible the flavour was. At first I thought it was too tart when I tasted it in a glass. But in the cake - wow! I now stock up on the soda. One bottle would make three cakes. I glaze the cake with a icing sugar and lemon juice mixture. Poke holes in cake with toothpick first and then drizzle glaze all over. Then I use a cream cheese icing and drizzle it over the glaze.

Hubby loved this one; everyone including my picky daughter said this was the best lemon cake they've tasted.

Just made this cake for an Easter brunch.  It was an absolute sensation. Baked it for 50 minutes, not the suggested 35 and it was perfect.  Decorated with fresh strawberries on top and in the middle.  It was simple, delicious and everyone wanted the recipe.  Personally, didn't think it needed a glaze as other suggested.  It was yummy!  Thanks for sharing the recipe Phyllis!

Easy and great tasting cake that you can make with stuff in your pantry!  This would be nice to use for unexpected company or when you need a quick dessert.  I didn't use any topping, but that would add the little extra touch.  I'm also going to experiment with adding more lemon flavor to the cake.

This cake was a hit at Easter, and at the Teacher Appreciation luncheon at my kid's school.  I sift some powdered sugar over the top when it's cool for a more festive touch.  I will make it again!

I need help as cake mixes are not 18.25 any more.  I made this cake and it fell.  You need to adjust ingredients due to less cake mix.  Pleas help me as even though it fell, it was delicious.  Nancy

My husbands new favorite cake. I didn’t have lemon lime so I used Cactus Cooler with lemon cake and lemon pudding. Tonight, I’m trying chocolate cake and pudding wit Dr Pepper.

This was absolutely delicious! Per the advice of other reviewers, I used 1 stick of softened butter in place of the oil. I had some Pellegrino Limonata on hand, so used that in place of the lemon-lime soda.

For the icing, I used:

6 oz. softened cream cheese
4 T. softened butter
4 cups powdered sugar
Juice of one lemon
1 T. lemon zest

It was heaven!

I will definitely make this cake again! It is so moist and refreshing I'm thinking it will make a wonderful summer cake. I  made a lemon glaze using 1 cup powdered sugar and 4 tsps lemon juice it was the perfect finishing touch.

The was extremely easy to make.  I  didn't have lemon pudding or cake mix  so I used vanilla flavored pudding and yellow cake mix   substituted with  1  lime and half cup lemon juice . My family loved it.  Will be making many more in the future.

My mom has been making this for a few years and I loved it.  I was diagnosed a couple years ago with a gluten allergy/intolerance so after missing the opportunity to enjoy this cake over the holidays when mom made it, I decided to make a GF version.  I followed the recipe but used Betty Crocker Gluten Free yellow cake mix and lemon instant jello pudding also gluten free.  It did not rise as much as the gluten version but the taste and moistness is the same as what I enjoyed before.  I will definitely make this again!

This is my go to when bringing a dessert to a party and I always get rave reviews. Whenever I sign up for dessert for my church home group everyone is hoping that I will bring this cake. Always extremely moist and very lemony. I've never had the issue with a chemical after taste...

Moist and delicious lemon cake! Baked up perfectly golden brown. Didn't stick to the pan. Nice presentation, enough to bring as a hostess gift to a friend's house. I didn't change a thing.

Made 2 of these last night - 1 bundt (43 minutes) and 2 small loafs (the loafs took a little longer to cook - kept checking every few minutes after about 30 cause I forgot to set my timer).  They were a big hit at work.  No changes to the recipe at all.  I almost changed the amount of oil, thinking it was too much, but I decided to try it as is and it's perfect.  Very moist and very flavorful.  I made my own glaze, which was also lemony and set the cake off.

I've never liked lemon cake until I tried this cake! Everyone loves when I make this cake, and it has become one of my most requested desserts! Though it doesn't really need glaze or icing, I like to drizzle white chocolate sauce over mine!

I have made this cake for years, very good every time although not a lemony as I would like,so the addition of a little fresh lemon zest as suggested by others would probably do the trick. I do not use diet soda for the lemon-lime beverage, perhaps this accounted for the chemical taste experienced by another reviewer.

I liked this cake but the oil it calls for is too much!  This cake was a little more on the greasy side for my likeing. Will try 1/2 cup.  Other than that, it's simple, moist and very good.

I also modified the recipe slightly due to only having vanilla instant pudding by using 1full lemon juice and lemon zest. Then cut the soda to around 3/4 cup. Added the 1/2 lemon juice, butter and powered sugar glaze. Scrumptious!!

I did not have lemon pudding so I used vanilla pudding and added 2 Tbsp of lemon juice. The whole family LOVED it! It is very moist and has great flavor. We will definitely make this again and again.

Awesome cake.  So easy. I also added about 10 minutes to the cooking time (total of about 45 minutes to cook).  I made a simple glaze - powdered sugar and lemon juice, drizzled on cooled cake.  The family loved it.  Will definitely be making this cake again.

I made this cake yesterday and it turned out perfect.  I made it exactly as the instructions and ingredients called for with the exception of extending the cooking time to almost 1 hour.  I used a lemon lime soda called Twist Up.  I also added a glaze consisting of fresh lemon juice and confectioners sugar.  Everyone loved it and commented on how they had never had such a moist cake with lots of lemon flavor.

This is the best lemon cake I have ever tasted.  It is moist and delicious.  My husband and sons wanted seconds and thirds when they tried it.  I did not use a glaze or powdered sugar, the cake doesn't need it.  The flavor stands alone.

I have made this 2 times now and everytime it gets better.  My kids absolutely love it.  This last time, I made a lemon glaze for it (1cup of powered sugar, 1 tablespoon of milk, 2 tablespoon of lemon juice).  I punchured holes into the cake with a wooden spoon handle.  Then I drizzled the icing into the holes on the cake.  Let it sit for 1hr.  Amazing!!!

Pretty good cake!  I didn't think this tasted chemically at all--maybe it's just the type of lemon lime pop you use?  I used Sprite and added in some lemon extract and zest.  Glad I did, as it seems to have made it more lemony, and it's a pretty sweet cake.  I thought about frosting or glaze but left it off; it's pretty good even without it.  Thanks for the recipe!

This cake was great.  Not as dark in color as the picture.  Very lemony, even added extra true lemon to the cake mix.  Yum!  I had to cook this for 50 minutes though, not the 35 the recipe calls for.  Everyone loved this.  Next time I have to make 2 of them.  It was gone really fast.  :)

Substituted Sugar Free/Fat Free Vanilla pudding (Instant large size)  for the Lemon pudding mix (couldn't find the Lemon)...then added a packet of Crystal Light lemonade mix, Used the size for an individual bottle of water.  Used 7-up for the soda.  Turned out great.

I have only three eggs, so I made this cake with three eggs, and made glaze with leftover soda.  It came out great.  It was light and very moist.  I just can't get over the artificial flavor of the lemon cake mix.  I wish I could make this cake without the cake mix.

The cake was very moist and lemony. Everyone loved it. I didn't add the pudding mix as the cake mix already contained pudding. I also added a touch of lemon zest. I will probably make this again.

I consider myself an experienced cook having cooked professional for several years, and until this recipe have NEVER had a cake fall.  But, fall it did, just like in a movie.  I stuck the toothpick in to test it and poof!  I don't know what happened.  Maybe it was the soda.  The taste was okay.  Nothing spectacular, just okay.  I have made the "diet cakes" before where you take a cake mix and just add a can of diet soda (any kind you like).  They never fell either.  I am glad it worked for some people, but I won't be making it again.  I'll stick with the recipe for Orange Cake.

This was a very nice moist cake.  I didn't think it was anything extraordinary, but I've never had lemon cake before.  It was very easy to make and I used Mountain Dew instead of lemon/lime soda as others suggested. I didn't detect any kind of chemical taste as some reviewers have stated. This cake took about 55 minutes to bake using a convection oven.  I always thought convection ovens baked things faster?  Overall a nice moist cake.

Absolutely divine! My 4 year-old couldn't stop eating it! Just say, "Lemon cake" and he starts licking his lips! I just added 15 minutes to the time and melted a container of lemon frosting in the microwave and drizzled over the cake! Used fresh raspberries to garnish which tasted great with the cake! Will make this again and again!

My stepson's favorite is lemon bundt cake.  His grandmother who is now deceased and whom I didn't get the chance to meet used to make it for his birthdays. Soo, the pressure was on. I followed the recipe exactly and it was a HUGE success for his 22nd Bday...Grandma Minga would have been proud!

Very good and very easy. I was worried about the "chemical after taste" that was mentioned by some of the reviews, but I didn't notice any kind of after taste besides a sweet lemony one.

This wasn't a bad recipe, I've just had much better.  I felt that it wasn't terribly lemony.  It did come out of the pan very easily.

Excellent recipe!  I didn't flour my pan thoroughly enough so it came out in two pieces.  I thought it was perfectly sweet but my husband suggested icing or a glaze...maybe next time.

I didn't really like this cake because it tasted very artificial to me. Everyone else in my family seemed to like it, however. I made a lemon cream cheese glaze for it using 2 cups powdered sugar, 4 oz. cream cheese and approx. 4 tbsp fresh lemon juice.

This turned out very well. I did substitute half homemade applesauce for the oil, adding a healthy scoop of poppyseeds also.  I also used two 9 inch pans instead of the bundt and cooked for nearly 35 minutes.  With a simple lemon glaze on top it tasted great and went over well with my brunch guests.  I will make this again, thank you.

This was great! I made it in 2 9-inch rounds, and frosted with the lemon cream cheese frosting, also from this site. I filled it with Rhubarb-Strawberry Fruit Spread (from Tastefully Simple), and used a strawberry and a twist of lemon rind for garnish. Delightful!

Great cake! Moist ten times over. I added a slight twist and used the glaze from the Glazed Almond Bundt Cake recipe utilizing Dry Toasted Sliced Almonds from Trader Joe's...
folks couldn't get enough.

I am very embarrassed to report that I forgot to add the oil, I had it measured out, just forgot to add it! Still the cake turned out DELICIOUS! Go figure!? This would be awesome with poppy seeds also I think. We are all devouring this cake and thoroughly enjoying. Thank you.

I have made this recipe only 3 times and every time I get such fantastic compliments.  When asked for the recipe I feel guilty because it is so easy but tastes absolutely fantastic.  I've added a lemon drizzle on top to add a little more lemon burst.

I loved this recipe. I tried a glaze that was posted (powder sugar, lemon juice and lemon zest) I would make the glaze thicker on the cake for presentation. It was very moist! I did have to cook 10 minuets longer than the recipe called for. Will make again!

This didn't work out for me at all. I used mini bundt pans and baked at 325 degrees for 25 minutes and the cakes completely stuck to the pan. I tried taking a couple of them out while they were warm and the rest after they had cooled and it made no difference, they broke into pieces. I have used this pan for many bundt cake recipes and have never had this problem before. Also, it didn't taste any different from the regular recipe that I normally follow at the back of the cake box when I make a layer cake (I always get the pudding in the mix one anyway). Next time I will make cupcakes out of this recipe, use baking liners, and spread with "lemon cream cheese frosting" (from this site).

Use Sprite for the lemon-lime soda!!! This is very good cake and super moist. I iced it with lemon frosting. It tasted SO much like the lemon pudding cakes I get from a grocery store that I think they use this recipe! ha!

Nice and moist with good lemon flavor. I added a simple lemon glaze while the cake was still hot.

This is a great cake which is very easy to make.  It is moist and delicious.  I use 1/2 cup of oil instead of 3/4 cup to make it a little healthier and I also add poppy seeds to make it taste even better.I am very happy with this recipe.

I'm not a lemon cake fan but i made this for my husband and he loved it.  He said it was even more moist after being covered for one night.  I used the white sugar and lemon juice glaze but he said it was a bit too lemony and would pefer a powdered sugar glaze w/o lemon juice.  The cake was still a wonderful success.

I brought this in for a coworker's birthday, and everyone had second helpings. (the whole cake was gone by noon, a workplace record!)  I was worried it would be too plain looking, so I topped the cooled cake with CookinMom3's glaze recommendation, which made it even more moist.  My coworkers were shocked I made it myself. (not very complimentary, hmm?!)

Oh my gosh! This was wonderful! My husband loved it!! I added a basic lemon glaze and the whole family ate in within 24 hours. Most of my cakes stay around longer than that. Thanks!! Vanna

Wow!  I didn't have any lemon pudding so I used vannilla instead.  I also added some lemon zest and a little lemon juice.  After the cake was finished followed another suggestion to glaze the cake with sugar disolved in lemon juice and then dust with powder suger.  The cake was fantastic.  The crust was the best part.  Very lemony.  No need to ice it at all.  I served to some friends and got many requests for the recipie.

I love anything lemon and this cake is included.  Yummy and easy.  I was trying to find something different to do with a lemon cake mix and this was easy and I had all of the ingredients on hand.  I'm sure I'll be making it again.  Thanks for putting it on the website.

Lemon desserts are my favorite.  I really enjoyed this cake.  Moist, tart, sweet.  Made it again for a friend's birthday.  A big hit.  I baked it without modifications.

I am so glad I tried this recipe!  At first I was hesitant, because the addition of soda sounded strange, but I had all the ingredients on hand, so figured I might as well try.  It was SO moist and lemony!  I decided not to try a glaze, and I'm glad I didn't.  It was perfect as is.  I think the glaze would have made it too sweet and sticky, but that's just my own personal taste.  I will definitely be making this again.

This was very easy to make.  It's nice because the ingredients are things that are convienent to have on hand.  I added a lemon glaze on the top for extra sweetness.

Very easy to make and very moist! Adding a lemon glaze gives it an extra kick of lemon that I think it needs to make it special. I served it with a dollop of whipped cream and fresh raspberries...yum!

This makes a nice lemony cake that is moist but yet not so dense and heavy as some of the lemon bundt cake recipes I've tried. I added a nice lemon glaze after the cake had cooled. Delicous!!!

looks a little scary when mixing/baking but turns out very yummy.
