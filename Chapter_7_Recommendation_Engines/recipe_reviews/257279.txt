I found this little gem and saw that no one had made or at least didn't share a rating, so I had to give it a try and glad I did. 
Didn't change a thing and everyone truly enjoyed! Thanks for sharing Lisa.K.

This came out excellent. I picked it cause there was less sugar, butter, & eggs then most recipes and it was easy. The only difference I made in the recipe was I added 1 tablespoon of milk. It came out moist not dry. Instead of 45 minutes it took about an hour. I think the parchment paper is an excellent idea cause nothing burned. It was golden brown all around. Just perfect. Definitely will be making it again.

Great recipe. Nice light and delicious. I modified a few steps making it. I sifted all dry ingredients and added it gradually at the end to the wet ingredients (so mixed eggs one at a time to butter/sugar etc then added dry).  Also, not sure why but I found it took much longer than 45 minutes to bake - closer to a hour.  But I will definitely make this pound cake again!

This recipe is a keeper.  I added 1 T. milk and added the flour/baking powder/salt after eggs were incorporated.  Baked 60 minutes in a glass loaf dish.  I really liked using the parchment paper as suggested.  The loaf has a dense, even crumb and is very tasty with strawberries and cream!

Amazing flavor!  
I made this exact recipe but I didnâ€™t quite  fill to one cup of sugar to curb some sweetness since there are 3 tbsp of brown sugar also. 
Per the tips article on Butter & pound cakes on this website, I dropped the room temperature eggs one by one and added the flour 1/2 cup by half cup as I mixed. this was more manageable as you cream the sugar-butter mix with the flour and eggs. 
I topped with pecan crumbles to decorate a bit and gave as this as Christmas care packages to my relatives. They loved it. 
I can see myself baking this again but subbing vanilla with rum extract as the batter is so good!

The taste was good but it was dry.  The only part that was moist was the middle.  I followed the instructions.   I am going to make it one more time,  maybe i did something wrong.  I will keep you posted.

Instead of using Allpurpose flour, I substituted it with, Swan Down Cake flour.
