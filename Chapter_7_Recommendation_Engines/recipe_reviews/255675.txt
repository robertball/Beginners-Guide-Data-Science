I've been making a dish kinda like this for over 50 years my dish calls for corn beef hash as a base with a layer of cheese on top and than egg mixture on top ( 12 eggs, long green onions, bell peppers,mushrooms,cheddar cheese )all to taste.salt peppers sprinkle some cheese on top and let it go.I do it in a large electric pan with lid but can do in slower cooker.( about 4 cans of hash. Enjoy.

Excellent base recipe.  I followed the exact directions (without the sun dried tomatoes) and it was perfect.  Used maple flavored sausage in a casserole crockpot which is rectangular rather than oval or round.  Next time I will add some chopped bacon and asparagus  along with everything else.  This recipe is very versatile, so many ways to prepare using basics recipe.   It's a keeper, for sure.

This was ok. I didn't use the sun dried tomatoes because I don't like them. It had nice flavors, but I think I will add some peppers and onions, and use cheddar instead of mozzarella and Parmesan next time.

Took this to a New Years Day morning brunch. Everyone loved it. I made the following changes. I used a little less than a 1/4 cup died basil. I accidentally used Sweet Potato Tator Tots for the hash potatoes (I wondered why they were orange!), and used half-and-half. Everything else was per the recipe.

Did I mention everyone loved it?

Made it per the instructions and cooked for 6 hours.  I thought it was dry and burnt on the edges.  Looks like a good casserole, just maybe not for the slow cooker.

Loved it. I used baked Virginia? Ham and didn't use the red pepper. What should the crock be set on I don't see that
Crock goes home empty every time I make it.

Will be making it again.  Had to adjust the recipe since the family does not like sun dried tomatoes. It was easy and delicious
