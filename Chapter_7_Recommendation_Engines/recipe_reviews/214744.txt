This recipe is delicious. The only thing I changed was to reserve a cup of the pasta water to moisten the noodles before I mixed in the other ingrediants. I did not use powdered garlic. I crushed 4 fresh garlic cloves instead. Absolutely scrumptious!

This is great... I made it adding the tomatoes chopped,  a small Serrano pepper diced and threw in some Mexican cheese.  Wonderful.. Grandkids had it your way and loved it.  So easy.. Thanks.

I didn't measure all the sauce ingredients exactly so it may be my fault, but I wasn't really fond of this recipe. The pimentos were the primary taste even though I used all the fresh herbs called for they didn't even out the pimento taste. I added zucchini just to up the veggie content, but it added a lot to it.

I was not at all fond of this recipe. Too "sweet and sour" with the vinegar and sugar. It was a large amount of damp greens in a little juice. I didn't even use it, once it was done. I would add the cup of pasta water or maybe chicken broth to thin it out, and leave out the vinegar and sugar. Or more likely, just not make this again.

This pasta is very good.  I do think that either the sauce could be doubled or the pasta halved, and that would be my own change.  The flavors of the sauce were very good, even though I made it with only dried herbs except for fresh parsley.  Thanks, Caleb!  I will make it again!

It was dry and the lemon flavor did not mesh well with the sugar.  There was also way too much seasoning.  To be fair, I doubled the pasta and doubled the seasoning, so it was a lot.  I ended up washing it off in a colander because we couldn't eat it.
