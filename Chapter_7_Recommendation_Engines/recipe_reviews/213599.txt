This turned out pretty tasty!  I substituted some ingredients.  Instead of 2 cups of milk, I used one 15 oz can of GOYA coconut milk. I didn't have any almond extract so I used pure vanilla extract.  Next time I make this I will divide recipe in half because 2 cups of uncooked rice yields a lot of rice.

I didn't expect such a wonderful final product.  It's rice pudding, after all.  I wasn't trying to re-invent the wheel.  The only change I made was using half as much sugar and adding 3/4 t ground cinnamon instead of a cinnamon stick.  It was "to live for".  I've made it a couple of times now for a friend who is recovering in his home after major surgery.  He says it has the same comfort factor as custard.  Eats a bowl for breakfast some mornings.

I cut down the cooking time by boiling the rice covered on medium heat for 30 minutes. I kept all the ingredients the same, except used 3/4 c sugar. It was fantastic! Just like Grandma's!

This is delish! For anyone following a diebetic diet, the brown rice is always a better choice. I used 1/2 cup of honey. Honey takes longer to digest, again, better for your diet. I also added raisins, also used fat free evaporated milk and skim milk. You won't notice the lack of fat. I also took a readers idea for ground cinnamon. This really is one of those I will use forever...thank you for your recipe Diana.

I used ground cinnamon instead of a cinnamon stick, vanilla instead of almond extract, and instead of the evaporated milk I increased the regular milk and added some heavy cream.  This takes a long time but it is worth it.  I'm not a big fan of brown rice but this is a way I will gladly eat it again.

DELISH!  I started with leftover brown rice (already cooked) and added 1pt. whipping cream and 3/4 c. water.  This rice pudding turned out amazing.  Love, love, love the almond extract addition.

This is good, but it isn't rice pudding or a custard.  It is arroz con leche.  Milk and rice and sweeteners.  My grandmother's rice pudding recipe has eggs and butter, so I think I am just being spoiled by that.  It is good,  but it definitly lacks the fat/flavor of a genuine rice pudding. A great option for going lite, though.  Also, to prevent it from getting crazy thick, stop cooking it before it gets pudding thick; it will thicken up as it cools some more.  If you miss the mark and cook until pudding thick, I like to just stir in extra milk once it comes out of the fridge to get it back to a smoother texture.

Your yummy, creamy recipe silenced the skeptics in my family!!  They loooved it!!  It's a keeper, for sure :))))  Thanks for sharing it, Diane!

I used a rice cooker and followed the directions at step #2, but substituted fat free 1/2 & 1/2 for the evap. milk and it came out delicious.   Only had to stir it for about 30 mins.  Loooved it!!!!!

I made this for my boyfriend who loves rice pudding. But the best compliment he offered was "this tastes like rice pudding." The evaporated milk gives this recipe an odd taste. If I were to use this technique again I'd use half and half for better flavor.

Mmmm.... surprisingly good! I love rice pudding :) I think next time I'll use vanilla extract instead. I liked the almond, but I like vanilla better.

This recipe is great. I want to eat more rice but was skeptical about eating rice pudding then the fact that is would have brown rice.  I replaced the 2 cups milk with unsweetened silk vanilla almond milk, used the 2% can of evaporated milk, added a finely cut banana, 1/2 tsp of vanilla, added one cup of raisins and used 2 tbsp of regular cinnamon- what a treat! I love it and can hardly stay away from it. I believe that my version is just a few calories less which is good cause I did this for my brown rice diet. It gets you full fast, which is just what I needed!

Made this today for the first time. The changes I made were the usual 1/2 cup sugar only because my partner is always adding Splenda, honey or maple syrup to everything. I also sprinkled the top of the serving bowls with cinnamon/sugar before refrigeraton and did add 1/2 cup of raisins.  We had it for dessert this evening, he had his with maple syrup and vanilla ice cream, I had a splash of cream and a drizzle of honey. The flavor was delicious and my partner couldn't stop raving about how good it was (between every mouthful.) Thanks for a great recipe!

Used brown jasmine rice - quicker cooking than regular.  Added one egg, 1/2 cup brown sugar, raisins, and vanilla instead of almond extract.  Results were DELISH!  And it was all finished in about 75 minutes total.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is probably the best rice pudding recipe I've come across.  It reminds me of my grandmothers recipe.  I ran out of skim milk so I supplemented with half and half (1 cup milk, 1 cup half & half) and only used 3/4 cup sugar.  I didnt have cinnamon sticks so I used a heaping 1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon. Turned out great!  Also, I cooked the rice the night before to save on time and it worked great.  I just warmed it up in the microwave before adding it to the milk mixture on the stove.

I found this recipe while looking to use up some leftover brown rice.  I agree that the sugar is too much - I'll use half as much next time.  And I don't have cinnamon sticks, so I had to use ground cinnamon.  But the rest of the recipe is lovely, and I will definitely make it again.  Slow and steady made it creamy and lush.  Really nice pudding, really nice recipe.

Very good. But I really wish I would have read the reviews first and halved the sugar.

Giving this four stars only because it takes such a VERY long time to turn into pudding consistency. Part of that could be that I was using regular milk (but less liquid than the recipe called for). I started out with some cooked brown rice I had leftover from dinner the night before. I used 3 cups of rice to begin with, and after about 90 minutes, I added another cup and a half of rice. This was finally finished close to 3 hours after I started cooking it. It did turn out tasty, but way more high maintenance than I expected rice pudding to be.

I got impatient after about 40 minutes and added an egg to thicken it (tempered before stirring into hot mixture).  Reduced sugar to 3/4 c. as other reviewers suggested--definitely still sweet pudding.

This recipe was great as far as amounts go.  I did make a few adjustments, I used 2 cups of skim milk and then 1 can of the evaporated milk.  I added vanilla extract, brown sugar and a bit of maple syrup.  I also added some allspice, just b/c I like it spicy.  Give it a whirl, you'll enjoy it!

Nice and creamy but TOO sweet! I would add 1/2 the sugar next time. I didn't have almond extract so I used vanilla extract which worked nicely.I found it took less time to make and I needed to stir it a lot during the second part.

This was a very simple, easy, and delicious way to make rice pudding with brown rice.  I'll make this again!  I made a couple changes.  I used only 1/2 c. of sugar instead of the whole cup and it was plenty sweet enough.  Instead of finishing the pudding in a pot on the stove (I tend to burn milk), I mixed the milks, sugar, and other ingredients with the rice in a slowcooker.  I let it simmer on low for a couple hours and it was perfect with no stirring and no burnt milk.  I also tried the contributor's idea for "speckled pup" as I think no rice pudding is complete without raisins.  I may eat this for breakfast!

This is so good.  It is nutty because of the brown rice.  I didn't change a thing.  I eat it breakfast!

The flavor is wonderful; HOWEVER, I followed the recipe carefully, and it never reached a pudding stage.  Cook brown rice at least 2X/ week, so am familiar with it. Now I've got a pot of good tasting soup!
