So delicious!  I completely left out the chipotle peppers, and it didn't make this any less tasty. Don't leave out the lime juice because it adds a great flavor to the broth.

I'm not sure if it was a mistake in the recipe, but I only used 2 cans of chicken broth (4 cups) b/c it was all I had on hand. It seemed like the right amount of liquid to me. So I'm wondering if the 2 quarts of chicken broth may have been in error?  1 quart would have been plenty.

The sweetness of the squash and the texture were just so good!  My kids ate it up and requested that I make just plain squash the next day.

This recipe is a keeper for me!

I knew I would like this recipe, because I love this sort of food. Like the recipe says, it lends itself well to substitutions and/or additions.  I used one chipotle pepper as I had a half can of extra hot rotel to use up.  Next time I will use all chipotle peppers for heat, as I missed out on the smokiness two peppers would have given it.  I added a can of pinto beans, as I like a more stew like soup.  I used cilantro instead of parsley, dried basil, and veg, broth and water instead of chicken broth to make it vegetarian.  My squash was already cooked, so I added it with the beans and liquids after sauteing the onion, carrot, and celery.  I added some leftover roasted red pepper leftover from pizza night, but I don't think it was enough to change the flavor any. I think it would be fun to add something green like kale to give it more color. I also think almost any leftover meat could be added (though what do I know, I haven't eaten the stuff in 15 years).

It's great! Vary the hotness with the adobo sauce. I know that one is supposed to seed the chiles but I didn't bother. Have not used the sour cream, but the lime is REALLY important. Didn't have it the first time, but the adobo sauce cries out for lime...Also, I zap (microwave) the squash initially for a couple of minutes and it is MUCH easier to peel. This also freezes well. THANKS

Very good soup.  I needed to use a butternut squash that had been sitting on my counter, and this popped up on an ingredient search.  I'm always looking for healthy and/or vegetarian soups.  This one fits the bill of healthy, so it was a great one to try.  I used the whole squash (probably about 3 cups or so) and a large Vidalia onion.  I also had to sub a few ingredients (used adobo seasoning instead of the separate spices, black and pinto beans--3 cans because I like it nice and thick like a stew--and fire-roasted crushed tomatoes instead of diced).  Served with the accompaniments called for as well as chopped avocadoes.  To the reviewer who used 2 CANS of chipotle (and to anyone making this in the future!), please note that the recipe calls for 2 CANNED chipotle peppers rather than 2 whole cans!  2 peppers add a nice note of heat but not too much.  Oh, and I didn't bother to seed the peppers.

Very good, hearty soup! The only change I made the first time was to use vegetable broth rather than chicken.  The second time I made it I increased the amount of chipotle peppers because we like spicy food.  We skipped the cheese, though.   Even though I'm a huge fan of cheese the soup has plenty of flavor and really doesn't need the cheese (or added fat and sodium).  It makes a very big pot of soup, and the reheated leftovers are great, too.

Betsy, I am so sorry you miss read the recipe. It is two peppers from a can of chipotles, not two cans of chipotles. Wow, I bet that was spicy!!

I skipped the cheese and substituted (mild) minced chilies for the Chipotle peppers. I liked this recipe because butternut squash can taste too sweet and the ingredients prevent the squash from over powering everything.

I neglected to add in the peppers since our grocery store doesn't carry them but the recipe turned out great with a little extra  seasoning.

Simply Delicious! I made this soup for my hubby last night, and he said it was my best recipe yet. My husband happens to be the cook in the family, and was really impressed. 5 stars all the way!

Wonderful soup that cooks quickly for its hearty flavor. I especially appreciate how flexible it is ... the chipotles are key and everything else works around it.

Delicious! Like others said, this soup is very substitution friendly. I left out the corn and added 2 extra cloves of garlic, 1 extra small onion, and extra carrot to combat the spice. I didn't both seeding the canned chipotle peppers.  Like it a little more healthy? Use plain, nonfat greek yogurt instead of sour cream, 2% cheese and hold the tortilla strips. Lime is a MUST!  I served this soup with a toasted whole-wheat bun  (100 calories) as a hearty lunch and it was FANTASTIC!!! Definitely worth the pain of cubing that darn butternut squash. :)

I tried this because I had some squash to use up, and used lentils and butter beans because that's what I had in the cupboard.  It went so quick, I didnt even have time to get the toppings ready.  Loved it!

I don't mind spicy foods, but the 2 cans of chipotle peppers in adobe sauce made this soup WAY too spicy.  Tried to fix it by going heavier on the butternut squash and adding a lot more chicken stock, and black beans, but the spice wouldn't quite go away.  The flavor was good but everyone was breathing fire!  I also blended the soup because the appearance and texture of it looked like vegetable soup.  I would except a thicker consistency for a bean and squash soup.

This has become a go-to recipe for me.  Everyone I've ever served it to loves it.  I use black beans instead of cannellini, and fire roasted diced tomatoes, and omit the basil (seems weird here), just my preference.  Really delicious!

Excellent! The only thing I added was a pinch of salt to the mirepoix and I used black beans.

Top Notch!

I really enjoyed this especially with the limes. I added a can of navy beans and roasted the butternut squash with a little olive oil rather than frying it. I do wish I would have only used one chipotle pepper as it was too hot for the kids. ( This coming from kids that live in and eat  Louisiana spicy foods.)

Great recipe, but as usual, I modified it and see how it could be made many ways and still taste great. I didn't have chipolte's, so added some smoked wild turkey I had in the freezer for the smoke flavor. Skipped the basil (just did'nt sound right) and used some powdered red pepper, a bit of salsa and canned diced tomato with jalepeno. Didn't feel it needed corn chips, sour cream or lime. Just enjoyed it as it was. Suspect it will taste better tomorrow, IF there's any left!

Loved this soup! I increased the veggies (a whole big onion, more celery and carrots), used 1 1/2 qts of water instead of chicken broth to make it vegetarian, used 3 chipotle peppers which made it spicy enough that I didn't let my dog have a taste but not too spicy for the vegetable flavors to come through, and added some chopped mustard greens. Used red kidney beans because I didn't have the white ones. I didn't bother with the toppings which brought the calories down under 200 per serving and much lower fat. It was delicious. Thumbs up from my husband, too!

great recipe - substitutions made - some from necessity - others by choice - zucchini, cilantro and black beans instead of acorn, parsley and white beans. I omitted the cheese and added cubed avocado at the end. I'll try it later with the cheese as I expect it adds something. yummy soup and uses some of my zucchini from the garden

I made this to use up some extra squash, expecting only to find it so-so, but it turned out delicious! I used nonfat plain yogurt in place of the sour cream. Will definitely be making this one again. Would adapt pretty easily to the crock pot, I think.

delicious blend of flavors.  I am a sucker for anything with chipotle so added more like 4 and it was just right.  Also added more carrots and onions.  Finally I also added lentils b/c I had no beans and some pasta bows. very versatile base to work from

This is a great fall soup! Don't know if they were meant to but my squash stayed in soft chunks and I loved it. Since we like food spicy I might add 1 more Chipolte pepper.Didn't think I needed the sour cream (calories) but did add a bit of the cheese. I wasn't very impressed with the cannellini beans has anyone used another kind? Will be on my do again and again list.

Great tasting vegetarian soup - I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.  I had a surplus of squash from my garden so this recipe added to menu variety/possibilities.  I love the sweet and nutty flavor of butter squash and the spice was a nice contrast in this dish.  I used fresh soaked beans and skipped the sour cream. I didn't have lime, but I'm sure it would have been more amazing.

Yum! This is a great, healthy fall soup! Like the recipe says, I think you could probably play around with what veggies were in the soup without problems - we didn't have any celery, but added more carrots and corn than the recipe called for and it was still really good! We also skipped the cheese and just topped with sour cream and chips - delicious!

I made this soup 4 times already!  I love it so much (but I'm a huge fan of squash).  It was such a yummy mexican twist on squash that I have enver had before.  And I also love that its a perfect hearty vegetarian lunch.

I made a few changes and it still turned out great.  I left out the celery and peppers and increased the butternut squash.  I used cilantro instead of parsley and  1 1/2 quarts veggie broth instead of chicken.  I also left out the sour cream and cheese at the end.

For all the work I did prepping the impossible-to-cut squash to go into this soup, it wasn't nearly as good as I was hoping it would be.  It was my first time preparing anything using butternut squash and I was really disappointed with the results. Maybe it's because I can't buy limes here out of season and I nixed the tortilla chips and cheese to keep it lower in fat and calories... maybe those things make all the difference (as tasty, high-fat additions usually do!).

I made this soup last night and my roommates loved it! 2 of them are vegan, so i used vegetable stock and i didn't have the right type of beans so i used garbanzo beans.  I also had no limes, chipotle peppers or cheese, but the soup was delicious! especially the next day for lunch :) I will DEFINITELY make this again.

This was very good, but a tad bit bland.  I suggest maybe cooking in a crock pot for a longer period of time to get the flavors to truly meld together.

Very nice soup, the lime at the end gives it a nice tang. Not sure that basil was the best idea, next time I think I'll try for mexican oregano or something. chipotle peppers add a nice touch. Definitely increase the amount of cumin, 1 tsp. wasn't enough for me. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I love this soup! I am not one to eat soup ever but I had some butternut squash to use up and found this recipe. It is easy to make and I like that it looks the same net next day when you pull it out of the fridge to eat. No fat or oils to clean off the top. This makes a great base to add any protein you may like.  And to the lady that added 2 cans of peppers..... it said 2 peppers from "A" can.

This is seriously one of the most delicious soups I have ever made. Here are my modifications:
- I used a whole small butternut squash
- minced the onion, carrot and celery as I don't really like chunky onion and celery in my soups
- used 1 can of chipotle peppers and one can of mild green chiles
- used 1 quart of vegetable broth
- added a can of black beans in addition to the cannellini beans

I really LOVE lime so when I served it I actually used half a of lime for each bowl. My husband said it was awesome.

I will most definitely make this again.

What to do with too many butternut squash in one's garden...this is perfect. I changed this up to work with what I had on hand and to please my daughter who hates spicy dishes. I also used vegetarian broth and then used an immersion blender before adding the cannelloni beans and corn.  Immersion blenders make the soup look fancier and hide the tomatoes from the fussy child.  Very good soup!

The soup is excellent just as the recipe is written. Some reviewer‘s have not paid attention to the recipe. It says to use  2 canned chipotle peppers ,not two cans of peppers. So just take two chipotle peppers out of the can and use those. Just enough heat!   Yummy

I just have to say to all of the reviewers who said two cans of chipotle peppers made it too spicy, READ CAREFULLY.  It calls for two peppers, not two whole cans.....   When this soup is made correctly, its delicious.

Excellent. We needed to get rid of some frozen vegetables and a squash. Turned out great. I sauted 3 cubed chicken breasts, added quite a bit of spice and less broth. I cooked the soup on the crock pot. It was one of those taste and add something dishes so I doubt I could reproduce it exactly. Thanks for the recipe.

Loved the spice blend. I used only 1can of Chipolptle in Adobo and strained the chilies rather than seeding them, pushing the pulp through the strainer. I used yellow squash instead of butternut.

I used Rotel diced tomatoes with green chillies and added Adobo seasoning since I didn't have any chipotle peppers in Adobo sauce.

Yeah, I misread the recipe as well in regards to 2 chipotle peppers, NOT 2 CANS! However, it was still really flavorful and I can't wait to follow directions next time and use a single pepper.

I love this soup! It's great during the winter. I've been making this recipe for years, and just realized that I had never reviewed it. I stick pretty close to the original recipe, but use way more veggies, so it's more of a stew than a soup, and I only use one Chipotle pepper. The lime juice is a must, but the toppings are definitely optional. It's fun to use them, but not necessary.

This was ok. I just don't think me or my family like squash enough to ever make this again. By itself, the soup itself was mediocre and somewhat bland. The condiments are necessary make this dish good. The lime is essential, but the cheese and sour cream round out the flavors quite well. I added some pickled jalapeños to my bowl which played well with the lime and Chipotle flavors.

I made this recipe as an alternative to Chicken Tortilla Soup after my daughter turned vegetarian.  The family really enjoyed it despite the fact that I have vocal butternut squash haters.  Some alterations I made:  I had already pre-roasted squash in my fridge.  Half of this I mixed in when instructed to in the recipe, which took on a mashed texture because of being already cooked.  I used all dry spices instead of fresh.  I added leeks, peas, and doubled the beans.  I did not have chipotle peppers in adobo, so I added chopped green chilis and abobo ingredients (oregano, garlic, turmeric).  At the  end, I added the remaining cubes of butternut squash.
