I used 3 bouillon cubes instead of the powder and a little extra cumin and this was a very nice change from rice. Thanks!

This is a good starter recipe. Needs a little more flavor. A little adobo powder would be a great addition.

This was a good change of pace for side dish on Mexican night; however, I agree with the reviewers who say it needs more spice.  I forgot to add some adobe powder as suggested and will give that a try.
