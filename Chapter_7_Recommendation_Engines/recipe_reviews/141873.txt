Best waffle recipe! I had to make one change, because I didn't have regular milk, so I used low fat buttermilk for both parts of milk. They were still amazing. This recipe does make 12-16, and for my family, that is a lot. BUT the leftovers can be thrown in the toaster the next morning and they are still so crispy and yummy good. A lot of recipes claim to make great leftovers, well this one really does! These waffles were fluffy and have a slight sweetness. This will definitely be my new waffle recipe to lean on for perfect waffles. Thanks for sharing this tasty recipe with us!

This was Wonderful!  I didn't feel like making a huge dinner, so I did this instead, needless to say we were all very happy with the end result.  I wouldn't change a thing on this!  This will be hard to beat with other waffles!  Thanks so much!

Well... I liked the texture of the waffles, but they were way too egg-y for our tastes.  I think I would like to try this recipe again, but I will probably only use 2 eggs.  My other waffle recipes use 1 egg for 2 cups of flour.  I didn't find them very sweet at all... maybe because the egg taste overpowered everything else.

These were good.  I halved the recipe and used my belgian waffle maker.  This recipe was a little more time comsuming basically using 3 different bowls because of need to whip the egg whites.  I will use this recipe on the weekends or for visiting family and friends.

yah now I have a new favorite.  I always made Belgian waffles, but I really love the texture and flavour of these.  I scaled the recipe down, but still had loads left so I froze them and they still come out fabulous.  Thanks

I was looking for a waffle similiar to what I get at a little coffee house but this recipe was not it. But, it was still good, a very dense, heavy waffle. It was really sweet. I would not make these every time I had waffles since I like my bisquik one's as well. But these are great for special morning breakfasts.

takes time to make, but very worth it! Freeze well, flat on cookie sheet then place in plastic ziplock bag.
My daughter says, "make the 9 egg waffles please"

These were really tasty waffles, a bit sweet for our tastes I would reduce the sugar next time. I halved the recipe which yielded 6 waffles. The batter makes very puffy waffles, in my vertical waffle maker it popped open twice, use less batter at first to see how it is in your waffle maker. Thanks for a new waffle recipe!

kind of underwhelmed. I'm wondering if I goofed somewhere but I'm quite a rule follower when it comes to cooking. these just seemed a little too dense, too dry and too flavorless all at once.

Very tasty treat!  Made it exactly as written. Yielded 16, 6.5 inch round waffles.  Bit labor intensive with all the egg separating but worth it for the yield.  Will update with the kids' reviews and reheat review when available.
