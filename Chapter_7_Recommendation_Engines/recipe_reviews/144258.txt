Hubs and I both enjoyed this and particularly liked the addition of the diced red pepper, which provided both color and flavor.  Normally I'd add garlic to a dish like this but I found I didn't even miss it. The lemon pepper seasoning contributed enough flavor on its own and was a nice choice. Another thing to love about this recipe is that there is no pan to clean!

Simple and delicious! I used a vidalia onion and other than that I didn't change a thing. The red bell pepper definitely perked up this grilled veggie dish. The was so easy to put together and was a great side dish for grilled chicken.

I made this for our 4th of July picnic, and it was great. I heated up the leftovers for lunch the next day and served it over brown rice - I think I liked it even better the next day.

I did this in the oven and it still turned out well. It is very easy and extremely Weight Watcher friendly, as well. Lots of vitamins, not a lot of fat, accompanies heavier foods well with high water content and naturally infused flavors.

So Good!! I didn't have red bell pepper so I added some mexican salsa to the mix and I free handed the seasons to my taste. I put it in the oven at 350 for 40 mins and WOW... the taste is phenomenal. Thanks for sharing this!!

This was not as yummy as I had hoped. I did it in the oven as I don't have a grill. 350 for 30 minutes. Garlic salt helped, but it was still rather underwhelming.

I baked this in the oven at 350F until the veggies looked done. I felt it was missing a little something, but it was a good.

These skewers came out steamed, not grilled. The three stars represent the recipe as wrapped in foil. This skewer is WAY better grilled directly over coals or roasted at 450 in the oven (no foil).  Just turn to cook on all sides. You can grill chicken on skewers or another meat, and it's a wonderful combination! You can also vary the sizes of the squash and the ingredients on the skewers. I have made it in the rounds, as specified here, and it grills beautifully. Actually, the picture in the recipe looks as if it was cooked on the grill, not in foil. I had to liberate it from the foil to get the flavor and look I wanted!

I do this on the stovetop a lot, too, and cook just until tender-crisp. It's an awesome blend of flavors.

I cooked for the time instructed on high on my grill and these turned out way too over cooked and mushy! I didn't really like the flavor combo either.

This is easy and healthy.  Sometimes, when we aren't grilling we just stick the packet into the over and get the same taste!  The kids love it!

I'm not the biggest zucchini fan, so maybe this was doomed from the start, but I found this dish too sharp, and just not that tasty.

Great recipe. Followed to the letter, other than I couldn't find my lemon-pepper seasoning so I used a Bourbon & Brown Sugar seasoning mix. Turned out very good! That's one night everyone ate all of their vegetables!

First time grilling veggies on the grill. OMG good. I used broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, red pepper, green pepper, the onion, and had to use vegetable oil instead of olive oil as I was out. Doubled the lemon pepper. Made 4 aluminum foil wrapped baggies with it on the grill. Only thing I'll change next time is to take a couple of minutes off the time for each flip as it was they burned just a tad. Agree with other reviewers though..even better the next day. I will be trying this with other variations of veggies. Wonderful and easy recipe.

This was so tasty!  I rated four stars because I found the lemon pepper amount to be far too little.  I increased it probably three or four fold to get just the right zing.

I cut everything in fairly large chunks, and tossed everything in the olive oil with 1/2 t sea salt, 1/4 t  pepper and the juice of a whole lemon because I had no lemon pepper seasoning. Then I put all the veggie chunks on skewers and grilled them on the high rack of the grill for about an hour while the ribs and chicken were grilling.  Very good, but I needed more salt and pepper.  Adjust accordingly and enjoy.

I get the same result without having to use an aluminum sealed packet by cooking in an open pan on the BBQ  . No steamed effect and better control of crispness.

These directions are not for what is pictured. I wanted the kabob shown, however this is probably the correct mixture and i will probably figure it out on my own. Just would have been helpful to have a little instruction for assembly.

I made it exactly as the recipe was written. It was very good but next time I will try less lemon pepper and maybe some natures seasoned salt

This is wonderful and fresh.  We put it in a glass dish and put it in the oven rather than on the grill.  Look forward to trying it on the grill and using varying ingredients.

I am such a huge fan of the foil packet side dishes!! I made this for my veggies, then did another packet of fingerling potatoes with salt, pepper, and olive oil. Threw them both on the grill, along with some turkey burgers, and dinner was done! Veggies turned out really tasty. Hooray for a quick, healthy weeknight dinner! :-)
