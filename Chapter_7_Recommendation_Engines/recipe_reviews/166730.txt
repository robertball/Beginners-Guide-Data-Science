I added a can of black beans, a can of corn, and some taco seasoning.  I also substituted whole grain rice for the rice krispies.  Absolutely delicious!

It was really good. We added corn, which added a little sweetness to the stuffing. Would def make again!

These were very good, I substituted rice for rice krispies, which I suppose defeats the whole premise of the recipe, but I didn't have rice krispies. the flavors melded well, and peppers came out tender and delicious.
