5 stars because this was delicious-- but I did make some significant changes.  Instead of French bread I used whole wheat cinnamon-raisin bread, then skipped adding raisins.  Instead of the cream and soy milk, I used 2 cups whole milk.  Instead of puree I used a can of pumpkin pie filling, and then didn't add the cinnamon.  I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup, and added a cup of walnuts.  Cooked in two square pans for 40 minutes- but next time will check it sooner.  Absolutely heavenly dessert that everyone raved about.

This was heavenly (if you like pumpkin). I used 1% milk instead of the soy milk and 1 cup half and half instead of the heavy cream. Used a long french bread loaf.  Made it in a 9x13 pan and baked at 350 for about 40-45 minutes. Some people liked Cool Whip on theirs but I preferred just the bread pudding. My adult daughter could not get enough of it and all my guests liked it also. I will make this again and do the same things as it was very good.

Overall was very good! I used reg milk and it came out fine. I am not a fan of raisins, so I add some milk chic chips. I also put in a 9x13 glass dish and baked for 45 minutes and it was perfect.

Xmas got here too quickly, so I didn't have any French bread or raisins, but it still turned out excellent with honey wheat and a little vanilla whipped cream on top.  My guests (my S.O.'s parents and grandparents, all Jewish/Ukrainian immigrants) loved the dessert.  I generally love bread pudding anyway, and this one is no exception.  Other recipes may suggest a sweet topping (strusel or such), but the sweetness of this by itself is perfect IMHO without being too sweet.  I wasn't sure what ramekins were, so I just divided the mixture into two casserole dishes.  One might have been enough, but I wanted to ensure this cooked evenly all the way though.  Thanks, Vivi!

This is delicious! I am not a fan of soy milk and I had no cream, so I just used 2 cups of 2% milk and it tasted wonderful. I used 2 cups of puree pumpkin from my garden which made it an even more special treat. My other small change was that I only had dark brown sugar, so I used 3/4 cup of that and 1/4 cup white sugar so the flavor wouldn't overwhelm the pumpkin. This is one of the best bread puddings I've ever eaten. I highly recommend it.

Super duper Good! Dh came home just as it was coming out of the oven, he ran to the freezer, got the Ice Cream and then ask if he could have some! I did use a multi grain bread, and more then 6 cups more like 8-so I added one more cup of cream and it worked out excellant!

I followed thsi recipe pretty closely, although I used regular italian sandwich bread instead of french bread.  I alos did not have raisins, so I finely chopped a gala apple and used that in place of the raisins.  I also did not have heavy cream, but used half and half instead.  I also used Nog flavored soymilk in place of the vanilla.  (It was all I had!)  This makes a very nice dessert.  Not too sweet, but ideal served warm with vanilla ice cream and/or whipped cream.  YUM!

Amazing. I loved this. so moist and delicious. OMG nomzies.

I used 1 C whole milk instead of so milk.

and 6 cups cubed white bread instead of French bread.

I also put it in a 13 x 9 in. pan and baked for 45 mins.

So moist and gooey! love it. Made it a day ahead of time and reheated for guests. I served it with no sugar whipped cream. Incredible. Definitely making again.

This was phenomenal! I made a few changes, though. I used two cups of whole milk instead of the cream and soy milk. I used 3 cups of French Bread and 3 cups of Cinnamon raisin. I also made a sauce out of 5 ounces of evaporated milk, 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1 tablespoon of cream of coconut. With about 15 minutes left to bake, I drizzled the sauce over the pudding. Make sure you don't let the sauce set too long or else the fat in the cream of coconut will separate and you'll have to re-heat it. 
The pudding itself was very moist and rich with flavour!

I used whole milk instead of soy milk, and milk chocolate chips not raisins,  and added icing on top after it was baked.  Icing was made with vanilla,  confectioners sugar and milk.  I cooked it in a 9 by 13" glass dish for one hour.  When I made it and put it into the fridge I was worried it was too mushy, but it came out perfect. Delicious and it was very easy to make.  I used one day old French bread.

Great base recipe, easily adapted to what's on hand or preferred. We used two cups of whole milk for the liquid, freshly cooked jack-o-lantern for the pumpkin, and 100% whole wheat for the bread. It tasted like the feeling of a warm, fuzzy blanket wrapped around us on a chilly night. Pure comfort.

This was very good. The only changes I made was to leave out the raisins and I baked it in a 7x11 pan for 45 minutes. Pumpkin is a favorite of mine and will make again.

Watch out for the ingredient amounts if adjusting the serving size. For some reason, the original recipe for 8 servings requires 6 cups of cubed bread, but knock it up to 10 servings and suddenly it wants only 2 1/2 cups of bread??

Next time I would make it a little less egg-y and bake it in a slightly smaller pan (i did 9x13 as some suggested) so it was deeper. But absolutely delicious. Definitely making it into a tradition.

Did a few changes as per other reviews. Not a fan of soy milk so just used half and half. Made a slightly bigger batch so I added extra pumpkin, an extra egg and extra brown sugar. So wonderful. Tastes like fall! Will definitely make this again!

I was looking for a way to use some leftover pumpkin and challah bread and this fit the bill.  I mixed all the ingredients together, then added to bread to ensure the pumpkin mixture saturated the bread cubes.  It came out perfect.

We loved this! I did make a couple of small adjustments. Instead of French bread and raisins I used cinnamon raisin bagels and instead of heavy cream and vanilla soy milk I used vanilla yogurt mixed with milk. It had great pumpkin flavour. The texture and flavour were excellent.

Thanks for sharing this amazing bread pudding! Made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. A couple of modifications: I used 2 cups of half n half instead of heavy cream and soy milk. Added about 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp allspice. Note to self - use 1 loaf of Wally world's soft French bread, tear into chunks and spread in 9 x 13 pan. Sprinkled 1/4 cup each of raisins and pecan pieces over the bread chunks before pouring the custard. Baked for 55 mins. For the caramel sauce I  used 1 can of nestles sweetened condensed milk - caramel, mixed in 1/2 stick of salted butter melted, and 2 tbsp. spiced rum.

Loved it! I used 5% milk and half&half to make up the milk portion because it is all I had. I didn't have raisins, but it still came out perfect. Loved the flavor, not over or underpowering

This recipe was really nice! I used 2% milk instead of soy, croissants instead of French bread, and semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of raisins. I also made mine in one pan, not ramekins. I live in high altitude so I started with a lower temp (250) then cranked it up at the end to 300 to brown. It goes great with vanilla ice cream and drizzled caramel sauce. Very tasty!

I've always loved bread pudding and this is the bomb! I used a rockhard loaf of Ciabatta bread and in place of the cream and soy which I didn't have, used 1% milk. I melted a tablespoon and a half of butter and drizzled over the bread to make things richer. This came out wonderful! I think I'll be purposely allowing bread to go stale around here thanks to this recipe!

Loved the pumpkin bread pudding. I added pecans and made an orange glaze on top. It was fabulous.
