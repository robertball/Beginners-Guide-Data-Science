I absolutely loved this but my husband thought it was "just okay" so I compromised with the four stars. For the salmon I rubbed in the oil seasoned it with fresh ground black pepper wrapped it in foil and baked it at 425 degrees for 10 or 12 minutes. The garlic really gave the spinach a nice kick and I LOVED the red pepper flakes in the fruit salsa. My only recommendations might be to put the salsa together a few hours ahead of time so the flavors meld and to possibly make about twice as much salsa since it's so tasty! Just added a warm multigrain roll for a healthy delicious rounded meal. Thanks!

Oh this is OOOHHH SO GOOD!!! I don't like spinich so i just made the salmon w/ the salsa and it was DELICIOUS!!! Best to let the salsa "merinade" a bit in the fridge and have all the flavors blend in a little and get nice and cold! YUMMY can't wait to make some more this time a BIG batch to last a while!

I was looking for a recipe for a green salad with salmon on top and this is the closest I could find. So I improvised starting with this recipe. I made a salad dressing in my mini cuisinart (could use a blender too) with 1/3 c of the fruit salsa 1 TB oil 1 TB oj couple pinches sugar pinch salt and pepper. I tossed the greens with the dressing and then served the salmon (foreman grill 5 mins) on top and the fruit salsa over all. Wow. This was sooo good. An impressive dish like a restaurant! We loved it. I posted the pic so you can see how yummy it is. It will be in our regular rotation. Thanks!

I'd give this six stars if I could. It's delicious from the salsa to the spinach. I made the salsa with the orange marmalade and coconut and I cooked the salmon at 425 for about 10 to 12 minutes. My husband wrinkled his nose (are those onions with the pineapple?!) but he LOVED it had seconds ate the spinach and had the leftovers for lunch the next day. An excellent easy recipe!
