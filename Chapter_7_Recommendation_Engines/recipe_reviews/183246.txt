Not bad in a pinch - I cut the recipe in half and used only 2 tsp. of light brown sugar as I don't like sweet cocktail sauces. Since I like more heat I upped the horseradish to my liking.

By no means the "perfect cocktail sauce" - not unless you like it SWEET, that is.  I started out not adding any - and left it that way. I also felt it needed a more tomato-y taste so I ended up using equal amounts of the ketchup and the Heinz 57.  A couple of squirts of Worcestershire sauce improved this as well.

This was much too sweet of a sauce!  Next time I will put a fraction of the sugar!  I do like the combination of other ingredients, however, and will try this one again next time we have seafood.

This was ok but a little too sweet for me.  I would cut the sugar down.  It worked in a pinch.

Really good, but I completely left out the brown sugar. For us it was perfect without it. Thank you!

This is the best one I have found yet! Loved the sweet and spicy flavor of it.  I made no changes. Perfect as is.

I made this and its great. I changed a few things. I used a clove of freshly crushed garlic instead of garlic salt. Forget the onion powder...its just salt. Use granulated onion if you really want it. I added a couple of dashes of  "whatsthishere sauce" (Worcestershire Sauce). You don't really need the hot sauce if you have raw horseradish which you can buy fresh jarred in a store. Always taste your stuff as you go. If you like it others will too. I added even more lemon.

Just like the other reviewers I found it too sweet and not enough horseradishy. Halve the sugar and double to horseradish and itâ€™s good.

This is way better than store bought. I cut the recipe in half to keep it from getting stale but other than that it is made as written. If I changed  anything I would have to call it my recipe so if you are going to add to it than don't rate it. I am going to freeze some to see if it stays fresh.

We absolutely loved it!  To give it a little more 'kick' - I used Chili Garlic Sauce, doubled the brown sugar  & left out the hot sauce- FANTASTIC.

Love it!  I used the Dynasty Schezwan Chili Sauce for a different flavor and added a little more horseradish sauce.

I tried this without reading the reviews and I wish I had.  I needed to hurry and make cocktail sauce when our shrimp was coming off the grill and we found we had no sauce.  I halved the recipe.  I too wish I'd cut down on the brown sugar.  I used extra hot horseradish and found I needed more.  This was okay in a pinch but may try another recipe next time.  Thanks.
