This recipe was a really great start!  I only put 2lbs of potatoes, added a carrot, stalk of celery, a parsnip and let it boil.  When soft I mashed it all.  Then I sauted the leeks in butter and added a little bit of flour.  When that was soft I added it to the vegetables and broth.  YUMMY!!

The soup was delightful! I did use a Hand mixer instead of the food processor.  This cut the amount of prep time.  I also cut the amount of butter used for sauteeing the leeks.  Use stock instead with a little bit of butter to cut some of the fat in the recipe.

To me this is what Potato Leek soup should taste like.  I use the entire leek though and I cooked everything in one pot.  When the potatoes were done, I blended the whole thing in the blender.  Awesome!

Wow!!!!!! Delicious soup. This was SSSSOOOOO easy to make and was just heavenly to eat with a crust bread salad and glass of white wine. I did have to use 1 extra can of broth to thin it out. I just used an hand mixer to leave some chunks. We topped it with shredded cheese and pigged out for two days!! This recipe makes a ton and keeps well. What more could you want? Two thumbs up!!!

Comfort food at it's best. I added an extra leek and needed to add extra broth to thin it out a bit. I also added garlic when cooking the leeks. I used a hand mixer to puree the potatoes right in the cooking pot. So easy!! Both my husband and I loved it!!

It was very good, however it was VERY thick!  I will try to make it again, using more broth, less potatoes & more leeks.  But still a very good base to start from!

What a lovely, mellow, creamy, delicious soup! I cut the recipe in half and it was very easy to make. I used a hand mixer to puree the potatoes, and added the cooked leeks to the original pot of potatoes. Other than that, I followed the directions to the letter. It doesn't need anything added! Perfect cold weather soup.

This soup is great! It is *really* thick, though. I used only 4 lbs of potatoes and still had something close to mashed potatoes until I added more wine (for a total of 1 C). The wine was a nice touch, though, and we ate it with parmesan and bacon bits. Even my boyfriend - who hates soup - raved about it.

This soup was fantastic. I took other reviewers' suggestions and made the following changes: I only used 4 lbs. potatoes and boiled them in about 8 cups stock with 2 carrots and 1 stalk of celery, and I used a hand mixer to blend the potatoes, carrots, and celery in the soup pot instead of the food processor. I sauteed 4 leeks in 1/4 c. butter and a couple tablespoons of olive oil, and added 3-4 cloves garlic and one onion; I also increased the wine to 1 cup. I garnished this with some grated cheddar; my boyfriend said he would have loved some sausage or bacon crumbles as well. It was so delicious!

This soup is very delicious. I made minor changes, but can tell it would be delicious on its own - I was eating this as a meal so added a bit more to it to make it heartier. I also had to use extra broth, though. And I didn't peel the potatoes, because I'm a rebel.

Added bacon, cooked leeks in bacon drippings, butter and wine, added a block of cream cheese and a small container of sour cream.  This soup is a meal in and of itself.  I've made it several times, always delicious.

As-is, the potato-to-broth ratio is way off, and the leek flavor is barely noticeable.  However, I love the idea of a vegan leek soup, so I will try again. Next time I will do as others suggested; reduce the potato, increase the broth, double the leeks.  NOTE: I also skip the half-cup of butter for a tablespoon of EVOO and frozen leeks from Trader Joes.

Top notch.  I made it with 3 lbs of Dutch Creams (all I had) but otherwise exactly as per recipe.  It's a lovely, subtle soup with a light but deep flavor. I garnished with fresh marjoram because I didn't have any parsley.  I'm always looking for good soups to serve before dinner or with a salad for a light lunch, this is wonderful for that.  Make sure you don't burn the butter.

So so yummy.  I followed another's advice and subbed out 1 lb of potatoes for carrots.  Cooked them with the potatos.  Used hand mixer to puree and was sure to do only minor mixing b/c the carrots would have turned to color an unappealing orange color if I had fully pureed them.   I also found the result to be too thick, so I added about 1/2 to 1 cup of  1% milk (all I had, bet whole would be even better) to thin it out.  The flavor and texture was so wonderful.

Like other reviewers, mine also turned into mashed potatoes.  Nice flavor, but I was hoping for soup.

We liked this recipe and I will make again, if we have guests who can not have dairy. I wanted to make a leek soup with no dairy. I only used 3 lbs of potatoes and I still had to add 1 more cup of broth to get it to a nice thickness. In the end it still felt like it needed a little something...maybe garlic. I did use a little oil instead of the butter.

this soup was so thick that I had to add liquid every time I wanted to eat it. It was more like a potato leek massh. Yummy, but not a soup.

This was tasty, but not outstanding. Maybe this is a nostalgia item and I don't have the right nostalgia for it. I first tried potato-leek soup at an upscale restaurant and thought, "Eh, it's ok, I can do better." I didn't really do any better. I added some garlic, but that's about all. Don't get me wrong, it's tasty, but it's not drop-everything-it's-dinnertime good. Also, I found the ratio of potato:liquid to be off and had to thin it a bit with more chicken broth, so keep that in mind. Thank you for the recipe!

Easy to make.  Not very flavorful or soupy and instead was very mashed potato pasty.  More thick like a pudding.  I had to add extra wine, extra butter and extra stock (doubled the wine/butter, added 2 more cups stock) and it still felt like mashed potatoes.  Needed more leeks, which I should have doubled.  I am going to fuss with this and improve it as I believe strongly this recipe has a solid base.  I would not use a blender which I tried (made the texture even more pasty).

You can edit this recipe to make it much better.  I would definitely start here as it's so simple that it could be just delightful.

This was a very simple recipe! To make it quick & easy: I reduced it to 2-3 pounds of potatoes, unpeeled. Instead of running everything through a processor/blender I just mashed the potatoes right in the pot as they simmered. (This does make the soup a little lumpy.) To make it vegan: I used vegetable broth and olive oil (instead of butter). Season with salt & pepper and, folks, we have a winner!

Fantastic!!  I had some potato leek soup at an irish pub a long time ago, and i have always been searching for a simlar recipe.  Adding cream to this soup, and I think it would be a match, but I like this soup just the way it is, its much healthier this way.    I am vegetarian, so I used vegetable broth.  That is the only modification I made.   Depending on your preference, you can make it even healthier by substituting the butter with some sort of butter alternative.  The wine and the white pepper give it a unique flavor.  This is my favorite by far!!!  I Love this soup.

I found this recipe to be very bland as is, but the lack of cream was appealing enough to perservere to find a remedy.  The addition of a large onion (chopped), few stalks of celery (chopped), 2 cloves of garlic minced, and a finely minced large carrot sauteed with the leeks was a big help.  To cut down on the starchy-ness, I boiled the potatoes in water, drained, then poured the chicken broth over potatoes before puree-ing in the blender.  Needs lots of salt (2 tsp).

Mmmm, boy is this good soup.  I am a meat and potatoes man and this is a delicious, different way to prepare potatoes.   Don't worry about making too much because this soup seems to get better after sitting in the fridge for a while.

Great soup!  I made this for a church supper (40ish people) and it was well received.  I thought I made enough to be able to take some home to freeze, but alas... no such luck. My 8-year old kept coming back for more and more.  :)

Fantastic! But like others have mentioned, it's quite thick and needed some thinning it out for it to be a soup, or you could eat it like mashed potatoes. I also ended up using probably only half the amount of butter and an extra stalk of leek.

Excellent soup with a lovely flavor.  I did use two boxes of broth from the beginning and added about 2 cloves of garlic and pureed everything for a velvety smooth texture.  It made about 12-13 cups of soup (even without a full 5 pounds of potatoes) which made it great for freezing.

I give this recipe 5 stars because it's great to find a lower fat version of this recipe! It's a good, solid potato leek soup - nothing fancy, but you won't believe that it doesn't have any milk or cream in it. I used only a TBSP of butter to saute the leeks (as I am on a low fat diet) plus a little olive oil, and that's all the fat in the whole thing. Healthy, hearty and DELICIOUS!  I will add, though, that 6 cups of stock was not nearly enough liquid. I ended up adding 2 more cups while cooking and then another cup or so of water to thin the soup out to the correct consistency. Great with crusty bread on a cold night.

Great recipe. I also added 8 cups of broth to thin the soup down. I also tried a version with onions instead of leeks because it was all I had - not the same. The leeks make the soup.

Wow, delicious!  I halved the recipe (but kept the butter the same), used Marsala instead of white wine and used a hand blender to blend all the ingredients at the end.  What a wonderful fall soup.

My "soup" had the consistancy of mashed potatoes. I added a pint of half & half and a cup of skim milk, which made it edible. But, in addition, thought it needed something like celery for taste...

I took some other people's suggestions and added a cup of milk, plus a full cup of wine with the leeks and an extra cup of chicken broth with the potatoes.  I also mashed them to leave some chunks.  I added 3 cloves of roasted garlic.
It was quite good, though I found it a little on the bland side and had to add quite a bit of salt when serving.  (And I'm not one to add much salt to anything).
Thanks for the recipe!

Really liked this a lot!  I omitted the butter and put 1/4c olive oil instead.  I also added only 1/4 c half and half.  I don't miss all the heavy cream of the "creamer" versions.  Still lower in calories.  Will make again.

This was really yummy, kind of like baked potato in soup form.    We added cheddar cheese and the kids were thrilled.  I will say the only problem is that is a really time consuming process to make it and requires quite a few pots and appliances, so it is a lot of clean up for soup.

Delicious flavor.  I used 2.5 lbs of potatoes. I added about 2 Tbs. of flour to the leek mixture and I cooked  2 diced carrots and added them into the soup.  I added 1 3/4 cup of skim milk.  To please my son, I cooked up just a tiny bit of bacon and sauteed the leeks in that with only a third of the butter.  I also blended rather than pureed the soup, creating a creamy soup with substance.

Um, it's okay.  I followed recipe to the tee but they taste too much like mashed potatoes to me.  I kept having to add way more broth than what it called for, and everytime it sat in the fridge they kept getting thicker and thicker, so everytime we reheated it we had to add even more broth.

I love the ease of this recipe.  I also put in the last bit of leftover boneless ham to the boiling potatoes, then diced it up and added it to the soup after the potatoes were pureed.  Added milk to thin soup down as well.

First off, Soup was delicious. Like many other recipes off this site, I made modification suggested by other readers. Replaced the butter with margarine, did not cook use the white wine, and added 1 lb of carrots. I also added 1 small onion finely chopped, and a small tin of evaporated milk in place of recommended cream. I also 50/50 the chicken stock with vegetable stock to lower the sodium count. First time I made it, I kept it kept the soup thick and chunky; Second time, more added remaining stock and made it more liquidy. Both times it tasted great.

I have never had or made this type of soup before.  I thought it had a wonderful flavor.   I added more broth as the recipe suggests and it turned out great.  I wouldn't serve it as a meal in itself but definetly good to keep warm on the stove with some bread for a cold day.  Very comforting.

tasty. very thick like other reviewers said. I ended up adding water to thin it out. I also added minced garlic when cooking the leeks (used the whole leek). I didn't need to add any salt because the chicken broth had sodium. I'd recommend using low sodium broth if you think its too salty.

I really like this soup!    I make this in my slow cooker--potatoes first, then the leeks I've sauteed in butter and seasoned with the salt and white pepper.  I skip the wine because we rarely have it on hand and just add a little more broth.  I put the cooker on low all day or high for 4 or 5 hours.  It's a family favorite.

I felt this was too starchy . Next time I would discard the potato cooking water and add broth. Cooking the potatoes and using the water just made it too slimy. aMaybe it was the type potato I used however(russet). Disappointing.

It was really good!  I saw some reviews that it was to thick.  I automatically modifed so I didn't have that problem.  The basic recipe is sound with less potato.  I also added dill.  And I added the leek tops to the boiling potatoes and discarded after they were cooked.

this soup was good.  my husband didn't seem too impressed.  i enjoyed it but i doubt i'll ever make it again.  i didn't think that it was "rich" at all.  i cut down on the butter and the soup was definitely thick and creamy-ish but i wouldn't say rich.  also, i used about 4 leeks and i'm glad i did because 2 just didn't seem like it would cut it.

Although this soup was very simple to make, I did not like it enough to make it again (the rest of my family would not eat it at all!)

I omitted the butter and fried up a 1/4 lb of bacon.  I sautéed the leeks in the bacon fat for extra flavor.  I cooked this in my crockpot and ended up using 3 lbs. of potatoes, 1 carton plus 1 can of chicken broth to get the right consistency.  I also used my emersion blender to purée the soup because I wanted a creamy not chunky soup.  I cooked the potato leek mixture in 1 carton of chicken broth and once I puréed it it seemed too thick, so I added an additional can of broth and then it was just right.  I didn't add the wine since I didn't have any on hand, but I think it would add nice flavor and will add it next time if I have some on hand.  This soup was thick, rich and creamy, we didn't miss the cream at all.  I served each bowl with a dollop of sour cream and the cooked bacon bits with garlic bread on the side.  YUMMY!

This was really good soup! I added some milk at the end to thin it out. I halved the recipe, used about 5 potatoes and 1 1/2 leeks. Next time I'll go heavier on the leeks. Loved the white wine in it... it really added something. Thanks!

Very good dairy free potato soup. I served it with store bought Nan bread, a weird combination, but the chewy, buttery, salty nan perfectly complemented this soup.

(also, used on hand gold potatoes vs white. diff color and probably a little diff taste but still good.)

This soup was fantastic.  Like other reviewers, I did halve the number of potatoes - and even then I still needed to add a few extra cups of broth. I also added garlic to the leek saute.  It's a seemingly simple dish, but loads of subtle flavor.

I used half the potatoes (approx. 2.5 pounds) and par-boiled them in water, drained and rinsed the pot out. Then I finished boiling them in chicken broth. I also used a hand blender and when sauteing, a little less butter and a dash of flour. It was pretty thick so I added a little more broth to desired consistency. Overall...good stuff. I'm freezing it in batches as comfort food when recovering from my upcoming surgery.

Since we are a health-conscious family, we really enjoy this recipe because it doesn't call for heavy cream. I used a lot more chicken broth than called for in order to reach the desired consistency. If I prepared this recipe to the letter, it would be more like potato paste.  Once it was thinned out, it had a nice consistency.  The flavor is very simple and clean, which we enjoyed. Overall, it's a keeper with minor modifications.

For some reason this soup seemed a little bland... I added 2 cups chopped ham, 1 cup sour cream and garlic powder. It's a good base for potato soup. Thanks JJOHN32

Unbelievably tasty and simple to prepare. Based on user suggestions, I included ~2 lbs of potatoes, 1 large carrot, 1 parsnip, 2 celery stalks, and 3.5 cups of broth. Next time I'll throw in a second parsnip and make it an even quart of broth. To make the dish vegan, I just substituted Earth Balance margarine and vegetable broth.

My initial taste of this recipe was on the bland side, especially since I don't use salt. But after letting it simmer a bit more and adjusting the seasonings, I found the flavors to be beautifully subtle. I love when I'm able to taste each ingredient, and I always forget what gentle flavors potatoes have. And the leeks really show through with a nice brightness. The only thing I did differently was mash about two thirds of the potatoes. The un-mashed chunks as well as the leeks added good texture. This is one soup I'll make again!

Delicious, creamy comfort food. I doubled the leeks for a stronger flavor. And added lots of extra stock so it was more like a thick soup than mashed potatoes.

Good recipe.  I made some changes though, and would change it if/when i make it again.  I only had 2.5 pounds of potatoes, so i added 2 whole carrots and 2 celery stalks.  I used veggie broth.  Also, I believe potato skins are healthy, but worried it would affect the consistency, so i only peeled half the skins.  (couldn't even tell!)  I used vegetable broth  and black pepper (what I had).  I only had 1 leek, and I used most of it, and I used a little olive oil instead of butter-worried it was too much. Also used cooking sherry as the wine.  The soup was good. Next time i would leave all skins on, use carrots, but limit it to 1 stalk of celery, if any. (too celery tasting) I would get more leeks! I would try chicken broth if on hand.  I will buy white pepper for my spice rack. I would use more olive oil to saute leeks for more flavor.    I would do this again, it was so easy and quick.

Easy and tasty.  I didn't weigh the potatoes and likely used more like 2-3 lbs.  so the proportion of leeks to potatoes was slightly different than in the recipe.  Very yummy.  No need for salt and pepper.  Was very flavourful as it was.

I used half the amount of potatoes and still needed all six cups of broth. If I make it again I will only puree part of the potatoes and dice the rest. Good flaver tho.

I used this recipe as a guide and it worked well. My fiance refuses to eat soup if it doesn't have meat in it, so i added some crumbled chorizo sausage. I didn't have any wine so i skipped it. Other than that i stayed true to the recipe.

Made it to serve to company who is celiac/no dairy/vegan.  (I used olive oil instead of butter.)  It was OK- I thought the measurements were a bit off; my 5 lbs of potatoes barely fed 7 (one bowl each) and I had nowhere close to 5 cups of potato water left after boiling the potatoes.  Soup was very thick.  A bit bland too.  For the non-dairy, I'd make again, otherwise I'll try a different recipe.

Quite good and even so without cream. I added red wine because I do not like white. And, I grew some small leeks in the garden and chopped up the whole plants, not just the bulbs....why not? It was quite tasty! Thank you so much!

Very delicious but very thick. Almost the consistency of mashed potatoes. You may want to add more broth to get a more soup-like consistency.

The only reason I didn't go 5 stars on this recipe is because you do need more stock than it calls for. But this recipe is otherwise perfect! It's extremely flavourful and my house smelled delicious the whole time I cooked it. It's also super easy; this is going to become a standard at my house.

The soup's consistency was a lot thicker than other potato leek soups I've eaten--in spite of my adding an additional cup of low-sodium chicken broth, and about 3/4 cup of white wine.  I also tripled the amount of white pepper, and added plenty of salt and garlic powder to add flavor--the soup was way too bland for my taste even after my seasoning.  I also think that if I make this again I would use double the amount of leek bulb, or as another reviewer did, use the entire leek.  The preparation time was more than I would have wanted.  I may try the soup again making all the above changes, or may just try another recipe.

Excellent, I followed your recipe exactly, I just made a little more than the recipe was for - and it was great! I usually make it with heavy cream or milk, but with this recipe, you don't need it and you definitely don't miss it. This will be the recipe I use from now on. Thanks for sharing.

I'm new to the kitchen...and this recipe was easy to follow and yummy!  I mashed the potatoes with a fork...the lumpy version of the soup tastes great too!

This is quite a good recipe- especially for  those of us out there with a dairy sensitivity- I loved it the way the recipe read, and it got even better when I added some crumbled spicy sausage. And SO EASY!!

The wine gives it something extra and different.  I prefer milk in my potato soup but this was worth a try.

I have made this several times and love it every time. I made it for a SuperBowl party one year on a snowy day and everyone raved- also good for vegetarian friends since you can use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. I do serve it with shredded cheddar, bacon bits, and green onions so guests can garnish as they desire. Great recipe!

I used Sweet Potatoes to make it more low carb.  It was wonderful.  I don't really know how much stock I used.  I just kept adding until I liked the consistency.  It didn't affect the flavor a bit.

Excellent Recipe. I used a 1/4 c butter and an entire cup of chardonay. I believe the wine really sweetened the soup. Simple and easy. I will be making this soup again soon!!!!

Yum.  And so so easy to make.  Loved the wine with the leeks.  Very good flavour.  I also added garlic with the leeks, and used cheddar cheese on top when it was done.  mmmmm.

We thought this was awesome. I made it last night and my husband and older daughter loved it. The younger kids didn't rave as much. I used vegetable stock (didn't have chicken) and 1/4 cup butter- all I had on hand. After the potatoes were done, I used a potato masher to smoosh them and kept some chunks. I had some today with bacon and romano cheese on top. Excellent recipe, Eleanor!

I was skeptical too, even when it was done. It looked like mashed potato soup! But this was really good and even better when reheated after sitting in the fridge overnight. I put in three leeks and didn't need to add additional broth.

Delicious mild flavor but not bland, even my husband (who hates milk based soups) liked it.  I cut the recipe in half and it made quite a lot.

I made this as close to the original as I could and found it to be devine. Simple, yet filling and healthy. I decreased the butter to just under 1/4 cup,  used only about 3.5-4lbs of yellow potatoes, three leeks (what I had on hand and didn't want the singular to go to waste. I had only four cups of chicken broth so I used all of it and added two cups of water. I had about one cup of Moscato left in a bottle, so I used all of it. Used the immersion blender on the whole shebang and it was delicious. Made some French bread. If I'd had a glass of white wine to drink with it, it would've been the best dinner all week. I love that there are so few ingredients in the recipe. It's simple, delicious, filling, and just all around a comforting meal. I imagine you could add bacon bits, sour cream and other baked potato toppings to this and it'd be great too.

This was pretty tasty. I used left over mashed potatoes but followed the recipe after that process. I would have liked more flavor, but I guess that is potato soup...I like the fact that it doesn't have bacon or cream. I did use veg broth because it was just for me.  Thank you for sharing!

Good soup! I agree could use one more leek and piece of celery. I put mine in blender at end to make it creamy, careful not to over-blend to avoid making the potatoes too sticky.

Beware this recipe calls for way too many  pounds of potatoes. Turns out thick and out  of proportion with the leeks and broth. It is sludge-like and unappetizing. Cut the potatoes down to 2 pounds.

This was so delicious and easy.  I was skeptical about the lack of ingredients but it really is delicious.  I used 2 baker potatoes and one large red potato and 6 c stock and the consistency came out great, and not too thick!  I sauteed 4 leeks (because they came in a bunch like that) in 1/4 c butter and 1/2 c wine and that tasted perfect. The only down-side was that there wasn't much for leftovers like I would have hoped.  My husband loved it!  My kids might have eaten it if I had pureed the leeks, but I wouldn't change that.  It made the texture nice.

You may as well have simply said, "season to taste". Who imagines that 1/4 teaspoon of anything, even pepper, will satisfactorily season a pot of soup that starts with 5 pounds of potatoes and six cups of chicken broth? It was barely edible until I added more pepper, some garlic, parsley, and even some cilantro. Mind you, I even used three leeks, since that's how the "bunch" came from the supermarket. Once there was some seasoning involved, it tasted not bad. As someone else mentioned, it was a good place to start. Thanks for a potato soup recipe that doesn't need milk or cream.

I followed the suggestions of some others, and went with about 4 lbs of potatoes and 8 cups of chicken broth.  Even then, I had to add about a cup of water.  I put a little bit of garlic in, and I used a little more than just the bulbs of the leeks.
My sister is allergic to dairy, so instead of butter, I used half bacon grease and half vegetable shortening.  She's also allergic to many wines, so I just used water there too.  Even so, it came out pretty good!
My suggestion would be to cut the potatoes into smaller chunks, then only blend a few, to give the broth some texture, and leave the rest as chunks, to give a little more variety and not leave it quite as thick.

This soup certainly had the right idea as it really compliments and allows the flavor of leeks to shine...however like others have complained, it had a bit of a mashed potato consistency to it. I ended up adding 2-3 more cups of broth to make it the right consistency. Next time I'll use half as many potatoes. Also, my hubby added a touch of anise to his bowl and it really kicked it up a notch so I may add that the the entire batch next time. This recipe made enough soup to feed an army, luckily I have a large freezer.

Not sure what I did wrong here. The only change I made was to cut the amount of butter in half to save some calories. My "soup" was a big pot of gluey mashed potatoes. Not making this one again, sorry.

The first time I made it exactly as the recipe and we loved it but found it a bit thick. The second time I made it we reduce the potatoes to 3 pounds and added another leak and reduce the butter by half and it still turned out amazing. This one's a keeper!

Yum. Omg this is just crazy good. Didn't vary from the recipe and I'm so glad. I did use what I had, probably less potatoes than called for and I had 3 leeks, but really this recipe is pretty versatile anyway. Awesome as directed, possibly even better with some fresh garlic sautéed with the leeks (in butter or evoo). Throw in whatever sounds good. Bacon bits, grated cheese, chives. Or not. Just excellent either way.

I made this soup for the first time today.  I used only 4 lbs. of potatoes but followed the rest of the recipe as it is written.  Like other reviewers, the result was more like mashed potato "soup" with some leek flavor.  The consistency was too thick to be called a soup.  I think the recipe could be improved if there was an option to use fewer potatoes and more chicken stock.  I also think one more leek would have made it tastier.

This soup is fantastic.  I found you cant skimp on the amount of broth to get the consistency of soup and added additional leeks to the mix. I also added extra wine to help thin out the finished product.  The soup is so creamy its hard to believe there is no milk or cream in it.  Add some variety with sausage or garnish with Bacon and cheddar cheese.  It freezes well.

Good base recipe. I made it exactly as written maybe a few less potatoes. My family enjoyed it. Adding more leeks or bacon would enhance the flavor. My daughter has lactose issues so it was great for her.

I have never had Potato Leek Soup before this recipe. I only made this soup because I had left over leeks and had potatoes at home. 

Glad I did, this was lovely. It was savory and nice and silky. I'll look into alterations later, but what I came out with didn't last a few hours at home. Merci.

Had only 4 lbs of potatatoes - good thing - because after following the other instructions, I had what my husband called "a thick glue pot".  Perhaps we can eventually finish this huge pot of soup.  Easy to make and if you like potatoes and leeks, very tasty and subtle.  The potatoes were going to spoil anyway.  I suggest using 2 1/2 to 3 pounds of potatoes, although you can always add more chicken stock.  My husband just tried some and suggested a little gravy might do some good.

Loved this.  Skipped the butter and used a little olive oil instead.  Also used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.  Very light.  Tastes rich and creamy, without the fat!

AMAZING soup! I agree with some reviewers that 6 cups is not enough broth. I ended up adding 8 cups, and still needing to thin it out with a bit of milk when serving. Other than that, I absolutely loved this soup! The taste of the leeks sauteed with white wine and butter was great with the potatoes. I will definitely make this again and again... although not for a while since it made a ton of soup, which is now in my freezer.

Definitely expect to use a full two quarts of broth with this soup - with only six cups, it reminded me of mashed potatoes! I used four small leeks, the white and light green parts. The flavor was just about perfect.

People mentioned that the soup might be too thick so I added 2 extra cups of broth.  I thick 1 would've been sufficient.  So good!  Definitely make this one again.

I thought this was just okay. I guess I missed the reviews commenting on the consistency of the soup because I foolishly made it as written and ended up with mashed potatoes. To say this is soup with 5 lbs. potatoes and 6 c. stock just doesn't add up. That's just over a cup of liquid per POUND of potatoes. To salvage the soup I had to more than double the stock which made it taste more like chicken soup than anything else. Put in more wine and seasonings to give it more flavor. Still thought it was just okay. My daughter liked it though, so that's something I guess. As written this would get 0 stars as a soup because it isn't soup. With adjustments it's ok but nothing special.

Made this last night, yummy. What made this soup was the white wine. Other recipes do not use white wine and it tastes just so so. But with the w. wine, it gave the extra flavour.

I love that there is no cream yet it's still a thick, creamy soup. Instead of using a food processor I just used my potato masher right in the pot, then added the sautéed leeks in, it left some potatoes chunky which I really liked. Next time I will add garlic for more flavour, and possibly other spices as I don't like to add salt for health reasons.

Like other reviewers, I was turned off by the consistency of the soup...I think a potato soup really needs cream or milk to make it smooth.  I added some milk to thin it out.  It was ok with cheddar cheese, but I wouldn't make it again.

I made as is and it was just like a pot of mashed potatoes.  I had to add a whole extra can of broth and more wine to thin it, and lots of extra spices as was bland.  I liked after all this, hubby didnt care for texture. Probably wouldnt make again, too many changes needed to try and "fix"

This was really good and pretty quick to make which is a winning combination.  I substituted vegetable broth for the chicken to make it vegetarian and I added a few diced carrots to get more veggies in. Sooooo yummy, my new favorite potato soup.

Great recipe.  The first time I did it, I tried to do everything from slicing the leeks to blending the potatoes with a food processer, but it took twice as long as this time.  Instead, I hand sliced the leeks and used a regular hand mixer to "mash" the potatoes with the broth.  I also boiled some chicken breast and shreded it with a fork to add a little milk.  It didnt need much salt because of the sodium of the broth and I used sherry because I didnt have wine handy, and I would do the same way next time.  A really simple recipe that's easy to modify!

This was an amazing soup! I also used a hand blender and added two parsips to the rcipe. This gave it a little sweet flavor. At the end I piped sour cream and sprinkled smoked peprika over it...YUM!!!

This was delicious!  However, 5 lbs of potatoes takes me much longer to peel and quarter than 25 minutes, not to mention taking care of the leeks.  That said, this tasty, tasty soup gets five stars from me.

This is a wonderful soup.  I made very few changes.  I used only a fraction of the butter to sautee the leeks and I used about 4 lbs of potatoes and 8 cups of chicken broth.  I would use even less potato next time as the soup is very thick and it makes plenty to last a few days.

Pretty good but definitely could use a little something extra like cheese because it just tasted like mashed potatoes. But super good mashed potatoes.

Very delicious! I followed the recipe as written. Turned out great. I especially like that you don't use any cream...much healthier option. Thanks for sharing!

Yummy.  I substituted the bacon with diced pancetta (low sodium) and it was yummy, with a bit of smoky flavor.

Yummy! I only had about 2 pounds of red potatoes- so quartered those, cooked in 4 cups of chicken broth. I added a sliced carrot due to another review. My leeks didn't have big bulbs, but I used two about four inches long, sauteed in half the butter called for and had no white wine so used sherry. I blended it all using an immersible blender (best $30 ever spent!). I served it with Cheese Biscuits. It was a hit, thanks! My four year old loved every bite.

Yummy!  I didn't have any white wine, so I just added water.  It was very thick so I just kept adding liquid until I got the consistency I wanted.  I used more leek than called for and less butter, but it was still yummy.  I also used an immersion blender (hand stick kind) so I didn't have to mess around with taking anything out.  I just put it all together and blended.  Thanks!

Loved it!  Substituted olive oil for butter and added some smoked salmon at the end.  No processor, so riced the potatoes.  It was a great hit!

I LOVED this dairy-free version of potato leek soup.    Since I had no white wine, I used red and that worked out well. Instead of blending them, I mashed the potatoes in the pot with a potato masher.  I ended up also mixing some beet greens and kale that I had previously sauteed on the side, and they went very well in the soup.

This is a great creamy potato soup without the calories and fat of cream or half & half.  I basically followed the recipe as written except I didn't peel the potatoes.  It turned out great!  I used homemade broth and a little water when boiling the potatoes.  I used about 3 tsp of sea salt and black pepper because I don't like white pepper.  Very tasty and will definitely be made again!

This recipe gives a lovely thick soup. I think it is much easier to make using a stick blender (Bamix) than using a blender.

Great recipe! I love the flavor! Since my 2 year old's favorite part of soup is the chunks of potato, I didn't wiz it up, and it turned out great, still with the smooth, thick texture. I added the leeks to the potatos as soon as they were sauted, and let them cook down further with the soup. I will make this again and again!

This soup turned out great in spite of the fact that I didn't plan well and ended up using a lot of substitutions!    I figured I'd leave a comment, though, to say that you can substitute cooking sherry for the wine if you find out at the last minute that it's been finished without you knowing it.  (all is not lost!)  Another substitution for white wine which I found on the Internet is the same amount of apple juice and a half teaspoon white vinegar.  In any case, the soup turned out great and I'll probably try a variation closer to this recipe next time when I'm better organized...

Delicious and so easy. I agree with other reviewers though, it's very thick. Next time I will cut down on potatoes or add more stock. I also added a tablespoon of white balsamic vinegar for a bit of tang.

My first time cooking with leeks and it turned out great. Awesome recipe!  I added a bit more stock to thin it a bit, and a bit of leftover cooked chicken too, and it worked out great.

I did add a carrot, and it turned out orange! So I called it orange soup and everyone loved it. I really like the fact that this is a creamy soup without milk...in fact the only dairy included is butter to melt the leeks, and one could use olive oil instead. Very tasty despite its lack of salt (when using low salt broth and no boullion cubes and no extra salt) or fats or meat. Healthy and yummy!

Somewhere around 3.5*. There was not enough chicken stock for the potatoes - had to use it all during the boiling. Followed the recipe with exception of adding garlic to sauteeing of leeks.
Overall, soup seemed to be too much like mashed potatoes.

This recipe was simple and very delicious.  The things I changed: I added half and half and a little 2% milk.  I added a little garlic powder too.  Instead of the white wine, I splashed it with some red wine vinegar.  I also used vegetable broth instead of chicken.  Huge hit. Will def make again.

What an easy & yummy recipe!  I too reduced the amount of potatoes to about 3 lbs and used 4 leeks.  Shredded paremsan was a nice touch.

So easy and delicious.  Like many, I halved the recipe and  I used a hand mixer.  I also added a chunk of tofu which didn't affect rhe flavor/consistency (I added a bit more broth) and that adds a ton of protein.  Might add some broccoli next time too for variety.

I made half the recipe and used homemade vegetable broth.  Making the broth gave me a chance to use up some vegs I had in the fridge.  I didn't garnish it with fresh parsley (as I had none) and the taste was great.  The wine, butter and leeks really made the recipe.  I really enjoyed this soup and would definitely make it again.  I wish I had made more.

This makes a great soup!  I didn't use a processor, just mashed the potatoes in the pot with the broth.  Next day it was very thick - I think if you don't add all the broth, this recipe would make the best mashed potatoes ever!

This was easily the best potato leek soup I have tasted. My boyfriend made the recipe with vegetable stock and did not puree, only mashed the potatoes. I think he also used more leeks than potatoes in this one. Also, I would say that it is important to use a drinking quality wine.. I suggest a Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand. It really does make a difference. It was wonderful on a cold night!

Absolutely delicious hot or cold! I served it for dinner and everyone raved about it.  The next day my Mom and I ate it cold and it was just like viccychoise. I puree'd the leeks too.

Very tasy but instructions are impractical as 5 lbs. of cooked potatoes won't fit into most food processors (I have a standard Cuisinart). I had to process mine in batches, which added much time to the preparation.
