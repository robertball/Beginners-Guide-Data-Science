Honestly, this surprised the heck out of me...we REALLY liked it!  Nice smooth, creamy texture and tastes totally decadent.  Yes, there is a tiny bit of a tang from the yogurt, but it's not overpowering.  Effortless to make, literally taking just a few minutes.  I didn't have Greek yogurt, so I used the Dannon non-fat plain yogurt I had in the fridge and just drained it for about an hour in a colander lined with paper towels. I could see using vanilla yogurt for a slight variation on flavor, as well.   On top of these positive comments, nutritionally it's a superstar...you can satisfy that sweet tooth without guilt!

I tried the recipe 2 times. Upon my first attempt my yogurt looked what I though was thick. However, after I stirred it, it was like a chocolate yogurt drink. So, I decided to just blend it and drank it. It tasted like tart chocolate milk. The second time I made sure to buy the thickest yogurt type I know of and used that. This time I mixed in and it had a thicker texture. However, it just looked and tasted like chocolate flavored yogurt. It definitely didn't have the dark chocolaty appearance of the main photo. It was more of a tan color. If you are looking to make flavored yogurt, this would be the recipe to go to. Using a thick Greek yogurt works well to do that. A mousse though, this is not.

Wonderful and very quick! My 8 year old loved making this delicious dessert. He added strawberries on the top for extra healthy dessert!

A huge surprise! This was really good. I did play with this a bit. I omitted the milk (why dilute the chocolate! and the thicker the mousse the better). As a result I had to microwave chocolate for about 2 minutes (and I used 80% power to avoid burning chocolate). I also used a 70% cocoa dark chocolate (was a bit bitter for this recipe, I think a 50% would be perfect!) and I only added 1c plain greek yogurt (this is the key...it MUST be greek for it to have the mousse texture) and added 1/4 tsp of vanilla (pure) to it. I topped it with fresh strawberries! Delicious. Serves 2. THANKS for the great recipe idea!!!

I used Fage greek yogurt and a dark chocolate bar.  I'll try to use a 50% cacao bar next time instead of the 70%.  To try and dampen the yogurt "tang" I added a sprinkle of cinnamon and a tsp of vanilla extract.  It helped!  Not my favorite chocolate mousse alternative BUT I am pregnant and nothing at the moment beats the real thing but I do have to watch my sugar intake.  This is probably the closest I'm gonna get.

Quick and yummy chocolatey treat.  I wouldn't call it mousse as it doesn't have that consistency.

I made an account just to rate this and make a suggestion. I didn’t expect the recipe as it to make a “mousse” so I mike it and then hit the whole thing with my electric whisk. OMG, you need to do that. It made a mousse that is a little on the thicker side, but sooooooo good. I will mention that I added about a half tablespoon of cocoa powder to this for more chocolate kick with fewer calories in case that had any effect on the final result.

This was pretty good, although I could taste more of the tartness of the yogurt than I would have liked.  I added a bit of orange juice and orange zest for a little extra flavor.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Happened to look at my jar of Nutella when starting this super easy recipe - replaced the chocolate with 1 cup of Nutella. YUUUUMMM! Well, what's not to like about Nutella with Greek Yoghurt...

I love this as a quick chocolate treat. Be sure not to heat the chocolate too much! It will seize up.
