I added a good grind of fresh pepper and liked the addition of the shredded carrots.  I used the scoop that I typically use for filling muffin tins which made it really easy, and they all ended up the same size.  I never would have known that these were shredded potatoes that I bought in the dairy section of the grocery store.  Served with both sour cream and applesauce.  They really do taste like the real deal (authentic)!

As Halloween is almost here, I added extra carrot for the pumpkin color and berry apple sauce for a bloody effect. Very tasty and easy.
