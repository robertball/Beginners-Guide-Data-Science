My husband and i could not get enough of these wings! They were so good! Instead of pouring the sauce over the wings, i basted them liberally with the sauce through out the grilling process. They were fantastic. I set aside extra sauce for dipping.The only thing i will do differently next time will be to omit the salt. It was a wee bit on the salty side. I think the hot sauce has plenty of salt as is. I think i will also omit the butter. With all the sweet honey, i dont think it will be missed and i will be eliminating all that unnecessary fat! I will definitely be making these again very soon!**Update: Ok, dont eliminate the butter..its waaay to spicy!

Oh my goodness, this was so good.  I put them in the deep fryer for 15 minutes because we like crispy wings, and then put them in the oven with the honey for 15 more minutes.  Put the sauce on and put back in for 10 minutes.  I also upped the hot sauce a bit.  My husband loves his wings screaming hot, and I like a little hot.  These magically fulfilled both our needs.  I am going to make these from now on!

I baked these at 350 for about 50 minutes (my oven doesn't get that hot though).  Honey goes well with the hot sauce.  I will make it a little hotter next time!

My husband made these last night on his own. He cooked them in the oven, 425* for almost 45 minutes. This recipe is one of the best wing recipes we've ever had. Absolutely delicious!

YES!! I had these wings years ago at a Detroit restaurant when I visited there and, I wanted this recipe so bad I couldn't stand it (the restaurant owners wouldn't give it to me...family secret and all.) I followed your recipe last night, although I did add a little more heat to them and some fresh garlic (this is a mainstay in my kitchen) and my family just wild for them! Next time, I will have to triple the recipe because they were gone faster than I could sit down and grab a couple for myself! I did add a little more heat to them and some fresh garlic. Any city that can boast such a great chicken wing recipe deserves thanks.....so, GO "RED WINGS"!! :>D

I added minced garlic.  Possible to use half the honey and still get the desired level of sweetness.  Often requested at the fire station.

We loved these. I did half the amount of hot sauce (Frank's) because we have young children that are not fans of spicy things (yet!) and they still had a very small bite to them that the kids were fine with. My husband and I who like spicy then dipped our wings in additional hot sauce and blue cheese dressing. I really wasn't sure how I'd feel about the honey and my husband who is a huge hot wing fan seemed just a little skeptical, but we were all pleased with the results. A nice change from typical hot wings!

Oh my AMAZING!!! These are the first wings I've ever made (definitely not the first I've ever consumed though...lol). I took the advice of another reviewer, baking them in the oven for 30 minutes on 400 degrees. I seasoned with cayenne and pepper, then poured about half of the sauce on top to cook them in. Once done, I tossed them in the remaining sauce and I, my 15 month old, and 8 year old devoured them! I probably would not use quite as much honey next time, and the heat is very flexible. These wings came out soooo tender. Thanks so much for this recipe!

My family and I love this recipe.  My 10 year old daughter is especially fond of it. She asks me to make it at least once a week.  I do add more cayenne pepper and I bake the wings in the oven on 425 for about 30 - 40 min. After they are done baking I turn the broiler on to crisp up the skin. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

These are really good, although I think I could do with less butter in the sauce.  I will probably halve it next time.  But overall, very tasty, love the combination of sweet and spicy.

Just finished cooking these bad boys and will be devouring them tomorrow during the first day of big boy football! I ate a few tonight to get my mouth watering, and let me tell you these things rock! My suggestions, taking into accounts some other wings I have previously grilled: use less butter (1/4 cup is fine), do not exceed 1 tspn Cayenne unless you want your ___ on fire, and finally the most important thing............. after soaking your wings in the sauce, throw back on the grill, cook 1-2 min. Put BACK in sauce, then back on the grill. Do this a couple of times til you have no more sauce to dunk them in...... a little extra work but you will get the most flavor, and you can thank me later!!

Okay, I loved the basic recipe and I am originally from the "D" so I had to try it.  I ended up putting my own spin on it.  I mixed Lawrey's Seasoned salt, garlic powder, onion powder, cracked black pepper and the cayenne pepper in a bowl (to taste). I seasoned my wings, fried them and did a batch minus the cayenne pepper for the kids. I enjoyed them "dry" by baking the honey on, then tossing them hot in the sauce and sticking them back in the oven for about 5 minutes!!!  I used the remaining sauce as a dip.  We had it with carrots, celery, oven fries and Ranch Dressing. Nothing but lip smacking goodness.  I went back to wrap up the leftovers, but there weren't any...nothing but bones.

Wow! These were fantastic. I doubled the recipe and my family of 5 devoured every last one.  I added garlic to sauce. I baked them for 30 mins then basted with honey, baked for 20 more, tossed in sauce and baked 10 more mins. Topped with sliced green onions...delicious!

Just made grilled wings for the first time using this recipe.  They are much better than i thought they would be!  I browned them fairly dark so that they would have crispier skins and they were juicy and good.  Cooked them probably 15 min as they were on the small side.

When seasoning the wings prior to cooking, I added garlic powder, paprika, and chili powder to the salt, black pepper and cayenne.  I thought this added a lot of nice flavor to the meat.

When making the sauce, I used unsalted butter so they wouldn't be as salty (since I salted the meat prior to grilling and Frank's Red Hot has salt).  I would only use 1/3 c. butter next time as I didn't quite need it all for 3 lbs of wings.  I also think the final sauce only needs 1/4 c. honey as it was pretty sweet.  I thickened it up with a few dashes of corn starch as well, think that worked out pretty nicely.

First time making this recipe and this will be the last time.  I followed the recipe directions as provided except I only had 1.5 pounds of wings so I cut back to 2/3 the recipe (Honey, butter and Frank’s original hot sauce plus one tablespoon Tabasco) which is a little less than 3/4.  This recipe had zero heat and way, way too much sweetness.  WHAT WAS I THINKING???  I normally will use 1/2 cup Frank’s for every 1/4 cup butter plus a little Tabasco and ZERO sweetener of any kind.  Also, the honeyed wings do tend to burn easily on the grill so be very careful and keep watching.

I tried these wings two ways - in the oven and on the grill. Frankly, the grilled version left something to be desired, and the flavor was almost non-existent. In the oven, the wings tasted wonderful and the sauce stayed on without burning. Also, I would recommend following others' suggestions to marinate the wings in the honey and hot sauce for a day before cooking.

Living in Michigan we had to try these.  I made them with boneless/skinless chicken thighs and they were amazing.  I just seasoned and seared them in a pan and then put them in a baking dish and poured the entire mixture of ingredients over the thighs and baked them for about 30 minutes.  These were wonderful!  The whole family loved them and we couldn't stop eating more.  Thanks for a great recipe!  This is a keeper for sure!

Wow! I give these a 5+++++!! What a hit at the 4th of July party we attended! These came out so good that I actually ate three of them. I never eat wings, cuz they always taste too "vinagery" for me, but these are the answer to that dilimma. We seasoned the wings with red/black pepper, garlic  and powder and salt and let them sit overnight in the fridge. My husband cooked them at 400 degrees for about 25 minutes, basting with honey after about 10 minutes. We tossed in the sauce mixture, rolled the wings around and served them up (they were all gone in under 5 minutes). I'm sending this recipe to four people today and printing a copy for my brother-in-law. ''This is an AWESOME recipe@!!!

I served these at last year's Super Bowl party for a bunch of constuction workers.  They were a huge hit!  It was too snowy to grill, so I actually cooked them in the oven at 400 degrees F for about 30 minutes, then used the broiler for about 3 to get them brown.  I also used a little less butter and not only basted both sides during the cooking, but tossed them around in the extra sauce when they came out of the oven.  Wonderful, wonderful recipe!

These wings were fantastic!  You can probably tell from my nick that I like outdoor smoking/grilling.  In fact I don't usually like chicken, but these wings were sweet/spicy with the wonderful flavor only cooking over a wood (or briquette) barbeque can provide.  This will be a permanent addition to my recipe collection!  Don't be too concerned if the wing pieces "char" a bit more than in the picture.  The important thing is to cook the meat all the way through.  The charred skin just adds to the range of flavors - and adds an authentic "grilled" presentation.  Bye-bye soggy fried hot wings!

Loved this recipes! I used orange blossom honey and was very generous. I used garlic powder and some cayenne pepper to season, and let the wings sit for 30 minutes. Then brushed with honey and into a 425 degree oven on a nonstick foil lined baking pan. After 20 minutes I flipped the wings and added more honey. After 20 more minutes I flipped again and coated with the hot sauce/butter/honey mixture and cooked for 5-10 more minutes. I probably could have used more heat, but these were really tasty!

Oh, YUM! My family doesn't like things very hot, so I just skipped the red and black pepper. Delish! I also fried the wings, and then tossed with the sauce and baked for a about 20 min. Great recipe!

These were so good!  I made these for Super Bowl - I was putting out all the food and this dish was the first one out.  When I sat down myself to eat, my boyfriend already had a pile of bones on his plate!  Clean-up is tough though because of the sauce burnt in the pans.

This recipe works for delicious fried hot wings!  I am not a big fan of HOT, but these were good.  More of a "kick" than hot for the sake of hot.

Like others, I added garlic powder and I upped the cayenne.  For 8 lbs of chicken, I used the following mix: 2 tbsp black pepper, 2 tbsp salt, 2 tbsp garlic powder and 4 tsp of cayenne.  Tip - mix the seasoning in a salt shaker and dispense from there.    

I heavily seasoned the wings with the spices and let them sit in the refrigerator for about 5 hours.  Then we dredged them in flour seasoned with the same seasoning and deep fried them.  We let them sit on paper towels for a couple of minutes until they were free of the excess grease, before dunking them in the sauce.  

Because I didn't pay close enough attention to the amounts called for in the original recipe, MY sauce ended up being a 50/50 mixture of the honey and hot sauce (2 cups honey/2 cups hot sauce - Texas Pete) along with the called for butter.  Because the wings were dipped in the sauce after cooked, it was safe to put out the remaining sauce so that those who wanted to could spoon it over their wings.  

I prepard the wings for a Super Bowl party, so I placed them in a crock pot to keep them warm.  As time passed, they lost some of their crispiness, but they were still delicious!

The wings tuned out fine. In my household we like the wings a little crispier.  In order to achieve that I ended up keeping them in the over 90-min instead of the recommended 50-min.

Delicious and the recipe is perfect! However I used Lawry's instead of regular salt, that's the only change I made! I didn't use Frank's, but Cholula hot sauce and they came out really great! My boyfriend loved them too and even said he liked them better than Buffalo wings; they had more flavor.  I will definitely make this again, you could use the sauce for a number of different things!  Also, I brushed the wings with a touch of oil before grilling because one reviewer had said their wings had come out a little dry, and I didn't baste with honey until towards the end and wished that I hadn't because it just kind of burned onto the wings.  But still, very good recipe and I'm really really glad I tried them!
**Made this again without basting with honey; turns out the sauce doesn't stick to the wings as well! Next time I will baste them as I did the first time - toward the end of grilling.

These were great. I have also cheated before and took pre-made frozen hot wing, then brushed them with the honey-hot sauce-butter mix. Really jazzes them up!

After having these in my recipe box for over a year, I finally made them last night.  Sadly, the storm was too bad to put them on the grill but they were still amazing in the oven!!!!  Can't wait to make them on the grill next time, and I'll probably do a mild and spicy version.  (This recipe as is would be considered the mild version.)

We had my husband's boss and two of his co-workers over for an impromptu dinner before they left town.  My husband bought some chicken wings and was going to make his own sauce.  I made him wait so I could look one up online and chose this one because of the ratings.  I'm GLAD I DID!  All four men, and myself of course, loved the wings.  I followed the recipe exactly and they came out great!  Thanks!

Yummy!  I made the recipe way for 1/2 the batch and omitted the cayenne & substituted bbq sauce for hot sauce on the other 1/2 for my kids.  Both were delicous but the recipe way was perfect!  Both my husband & I loved them!

Very good!  Had a cookout and these were gone quick.  Recipe is simple and easy, but really delicious.  Go heavy on the cayenne at first if you like the spicy taste to linger.

Detroiter here.  I have been making (and eating) wings like this for 35 years.  NOTHING beats these wings.  Hot, but not too hot.  Addictive as Hell.  A bowl of homemade blue cheese dip, some celery sticks, some great Canadian beer makes for a great football watching snack.

I cooked mine in the oven and I didn't put the honey on before cooking, just the honey in the sauce. I thought the sauce was just on the edge of too sweet, so I'm glad I didn't use the extra honey. Was very tasty and not particularly hot. Will probably add more spice next time.

This recipe was nice.  Second time I made these I let them sit or marinade them in hot sauce and the pepper overnight. I also added some habaneros finely diced too. This seemed to kick up the flavor.

If you didn't think these were great you probably made them wrong.  Grilling is definitely the way to go.  A few of mine got charred on one side at the end of cooking but it was a good flavor change every once in a while.

As a member of allrecipes for almost a year, I have used many recipes, but this is the first one I have commented on. These were delicious! I read the other comments and I fried the chicken wings first then put them in the oven, basting them every 10 minutes. The chicken was so tender and fell right off the bone. My husband said that after he ate these, he will never eat regular fried chicken again! Thanks for the great recipe.!!

It's the middle of winter in Wisconsin, so I opted to bake instead of grill. Seasoned and basted with honey, baked in the oven 40 minutes, flipping the wings halfway and basting with more honey. I mixed up the sauce and spread some on the wings and popped them back in the oven for about 5 minutes. Delicious!

This recipe is so fantastic! I've made them twice in a row. Both times I used Franks RedHot Sweet Heat Wings Sauce, and opted not to pour extra salt on. The wings beat most of the local wings places around my area. My fam & friends can't get enough, even those who normally hate the spicy stuff love 'em. A++

Made a ton of wings and drum sticks for a BBQ party. I didn't baste with the honey afraid that they would burn on the grill. I had serveral people ask what was one them. They were a hit. Will make again basting with the honey.

I have made this several times, but I haven't had the chance to rate it until now =) We love this recipe. I have made it with the cayenne pepper and without. It is great both ways. When my hubby made it without the cayenne he used BBQ seasoning instead. It was just as good. I think I used more honey than what it said, so I guess it just depends on the person barbecuing. Thanks for this recipe. It has gone down into my family recipe book, we use it all the time. Thanks so much.

These were very good wings but for me they needed to be a little hotter to get 5 stars. Next time I make them I will add a little more hot sauce to them to see if that helps. Would recomend to try for the honey on the wings is a perfect fit.

I cooked mine in a skillet with flour; my husband prefers breaded wings. Then baked them in the oven at 350 for  45 minutes in the sauce.  These were really enjoyable.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was the first time making this recipe. I pan fried the wings since it is below zero here. Dipped the wings and put them under the broiler for a few mintues. Dipped again, served and our family gobbled them down. We will make these again!

Perfect amount of sweet and spicy. I doubled the batch and added a cup of BBQ sauce (for smoky flavor) cut the butter in half for the doubled recipe. I baked in the oven at 450 (because of rain) for 40 mins. These are better than any pizza place wing and rival wing chains wings.

Wow honey really does lend itself well to hot sauce! I seasoned my wings with cayenne pepper, black pepper, paprika, and garlic powder (no salt!) and let it sit for about an hour. I have no grill so I baked the wings at 300 until they were tender and brown. Prior to baking, I spooned some of the hot sauce on the wings. I turned the wings periodically and basted with the sauce. For the sauce I melted the butter (1/2 the amount called for) in a saucepan, then added the honey (also half) and Frank's Red Hot. I also added cayenne pepper to taste. I let the sauce thicken a bit on the stove before adding it to the chicken. I reserved some to add at the end of baking. It was spicy and sweet. So delicious! Thank you for posting!

Yum.  I have made these twice for parties and they always go fast.  The first time I did them in the crock pot, the second time in the oven as the recipes calls for.  Definitely better in the oven - probably over the top on the grill.  If you like your wings spicy - add more than called for.

Made as written for sauce.  Used chicken legs instead of wings.  All loved!  (Those that like the heat, anyway!)  Have made several times.

Amazing! I marinated chicken legs (got a ton on sale) over night in half of the hot sauce and honey. I subbed red pepper flakes for the cayenne b/c I am out. I also forgot the butter and these were still amazing, perfect combo of sweet and spicy! Thanks for the recipe:)

So Good!  I've been looking for something like this for a long time!  (Those of you who live in the south, if you remember Po Folk's Low Country Wings, they are similar to them!) The sweet and spicy go so well with a tangy bleu cheese dressing.  Perfect for grilling in the backyard on beautiful pool day (exactly what I'm doing today!).  Thanks so much for a simple but flavorful recipe!!

These were awesome!  I had never made wings before and they came out perfect and were a great addition to our Superbowl spread.  Like many others, I baked them in the oven at 400 for 40 minutes, then broiled until they caramelized.

Awesome savory taste. Definitely best wet and hot. We did find out though that you can cut back on the butter and the honey still have the same great taste. A must have for superbowl parties :-)

Delicious!  We loved these wings.  You could probably tone them down a little for the kids (even thought they weren't terribly hot) by omitting the cayenne pepper.  Definitely a keeper.

These were excellent.  I have made them twice for BBQ's. The first time they went so fast, I didn't even get to try them, but was told they were sooooo good. Don't worry about them being too hot, really they are not.  Love this recipe!!

We have tried a few recipes in the past and none of them have even come close. These wings are awesome!!! We used half the honey the recipe called for. That was the only thing we changed. Thanx for sharing your recipe!!

We made these wings for a cookout and they were a huge hit. When the wings were about done on the grill, we basted them with some of the sauce. Then we put them on a platter and spooned the rest of the sauce over them. I had about six pounds of wings and doubled the recipe for the sauce. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Excellent recipe!! We love spicy foods but this is a great compliment of spicy and sweet. Made these for the hockey game and our friends were raving about them. I tried the recommended garlic additions and I also used half Franks Red Hot with half Frank's Extra-Hot. This gave them just the right amount of bite. Delicious!!

I love chicken wings, and these had a good taste.  Although I suggest you watch them pretty carefully, mine got a bit charred, so you could barely taste the sauce over the burnt honey.

You can also blend hot sauce (not buffalo wing sauce) with the honey rather than using the pepper seasoning. That way you can decide how hot/sweet you want the wings.

Really liked these, absolutely make sure you oil the grill grates generously.  The honey makes them stick.  But the flavor is fantastic!

I used siracha as the hot sauce, wings were delicious!  Also shook half the batch in curry powder and smoked paprika which in my opinion gave a better flavor than the cayenne.  Also I baked them instead of grilled.

This recipe was SO good!! I fried my wings crispy (our family preference), drained them on a paper towel then transferred them to a bowl to baste with honey. I mixed the sauce in a separate bowl then poured it into the bowl with wings, put a lid on and tossed to coat. Poured it onto a baking sheet into 350 oven for 10 minutes.....YUM!!! Raves from hubby as well :) The honey and hot sauce marry well

10 2 13 ...  http://allrecipes.com/recipe/142120/detroit-hot-honey-wings/ ... In the oven, but review so far: Yes, wings; but not really hot - as in spicy - wings.  With review suggestion, I only used half cup honey.  It's plenty sweet enough.  Twice that would be way too much.  I'm not a firebreather & these are just a little spicier than mild. The "add more if you can stand it" made me think these were going to be hot.  They aren't.  After tasting, I added 2T more Frank's. 'Still not all that hot, but I'm using it.  I thickened w 1T cornstarch - could've used 1 1/2 - 2T.  I simmered the wings 8 minutes to help with baking time. Baked plain for 20 & sauced then 20 more.  Taste: Reminds me of those you'd get in a chinese restaurant.  More sweet than hot - so good for that purpose - but for hot wings, not so much.  Good kid wing recipe, I guess.  One more thing: I totally agree with one of the fewer star reviews that said too much butter.  The ratio of one to one, hot sauce & butter is off.  I wasn't thinking & just went along with it.  It's too greasy & dilutes any flavor with their being so much of it.  I try to healthup dishes & I'm almost embarrassed to look at the pan they baked in.  The first thing my taster said was "Did you put honey in this?" No, not overly sweet; but yes, sweet.  Sweet more than hot - & the hot isn't so hot.  "Hot" should be removed from the name.  All wings aren't "hot wings". 9 2017 If only AR had a sign that I'd made these before I wouldn't have a

Awesomely great wings! I seasoned the wings w/ salt, pepper, garlic powder and cayenne, and baked @ 425 degrees for about 40 mins. or so, until they were crispy. I did not baste them w/ the honey while they were cooking. I just mixed the sauce ingredients and tossed the wings in there once they were cooked, and set them back into the oven for a few minutes, so the sauce would get sticky...Perfect! The family RAVED over these...I will def be making these again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I opted to make these in the oven using a baking sheet covered with foil and lightly sprayed with cooking spray. I baked them for 30 minutes at 375 degrees (with honey drizzled over them), then I took them out, flipped them over and drizzled more honey, and baked them for another 30 minutes. After that I tossed them in the hot sauce/honey/butter mixture and baked them for another 5 minutes. Then I poured the remaining sauce over them. They were great! Next time I'll use a spicier hot sauce. I would like to try them with barbecue sauce in place of the hot sauce. Yum!

This was fantastic! We didn't have wings, so we used tenderloins. When it came to the hot sauce, we used thai garlic chili hot sauce and added sriracha to taste. The heat of the cayenne complimented the sweet honey, we loved it!

This was good.  I admit that I didn't follow the recipe exactly--we don't like sauce on the wings, so we just dip the dry wings into a bowl of sauce.  So, like some other reviewers, I baked in oven on 425 for about 40 min total, basting with honey on each side during the last 15 min. I used Tapatio Hot Sauce because that was all I had on hand, and frankly, I thought the sauce was pretty spicy!  So the people that say it wasn't hot enough must be pretty hardcore on the hot factor.  LOL  Anyway, it was good, but having trimmed off the wing tips, cut each leg in half, and gone through all the other preparations and tending to the wings while cooking, and then cleaning of all the pans, I don't think I'll be trying to cook wings at home again.  It's not worth it to me--The chicken I used was $8, and then factor in all the time and effort and additional costs for ingredients (spices, etc), and clearly the right choice for my wallet is the restaurant option.

The sauce was delicious. We were tailgating and I decided to try to combine this recipe with one of the ways I make wings. I marinated wings in Franks Louisiana Hot Sauce for a few hours. I added cayenne, salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder to flour and dredged the wings. I then deep fried them as I always do. When they came out of the fryer, I put the honey on them and put them on the grill as the recipe directed. I then tossed them in the sauce which was made exactly to the recipes specifications. They were outrageous. My husband loved them and some of the other tailgaters (who we don't even know) who tasted them, asked how I made them because they loved them so much. The frying and subsequent grilling made them crisp the way we like them and the sauce was a perfect blend of sweet and hot. I will definitely be making these again.

Made these wings last night they turned out better then expected, seasoned with salt pepper and cayenne and deep fried only used 1/2c of honey since thats all i had added bbq sauce to make up for the difference, minced garlic, and hot sauce let simmer while wings cook. Coated the wings popped in oven for 30 mins.  Next time i will use a tad bit less honey and add more heat

My husband had never seen the purpose of hot wings but I made these and insisted that he try them. He loved them and now they are a favorite for us. I followed the recipe but I used Taco Bell sauce for the hot sauce. I also used this recipe for chicken legs instead of wings. Turned out just as great.

This was sooo good.  I only gave it four stars because there was so much butter.  I fried my wings so I added all of the ingredients into a pot and let them simmer after melting the butter.  My son loved them and he's extremely picky. Next time i'll cut the butter down by a fourth and see what happens.

I made these wings for game day and were a hit!!! I did omit the cayenne pepper and used onion and garlic powder instead, the only hot sauce i had on hand at the time was frank's xtra hot sauce so didn't think i needed cayenne. The second time i made them i omitted the butter and they were still amazing.

Breaded with cayenne, salt, pepper, and flour and baked in oven at 425 for 45 minutes.  Then tossed wings in sauce and baked for another 5 minutes.  They really werent that spicy as written, but definatly easy to make them spicer if you would like.

These were really good but (as others have mentioned) next time I would definitely cut back on the butter. I'm usually a yay-for-butter person, but the half cup was definitely too much.

AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING!!! The only thing different I did was to double the recipe for more wings and still only used about 1/4 cup of butter. I also added a shot of whiskey just for kicks (We were drinking it anyways!!) Did them on the grill and they were so amazing. The hubby loved it even though he was very concerned about the amount of honey. We went through every wing we had and even dipped the fries in the leftover sauce. 10 stars if I could!!!!

These were pretty good. Very sweet. I didn't think they were spicy at all. I might make them again with half the honey and twice as much hot sauce.

Very tasty!  I added garlic to it as well, but that was the only alteration.  I like how it's just enough to give the wings a good taste however it's not over powering.  I will definitely continue to make this.  And thank you for a new camping recipe!

My wife and friends all greatly enjoyed these wings. We have made them twice, the first time was somewhat of a failure. The second time they were amazing. 

Between the two tries we learned that Franks Thick Hot Sauce works best, the first attempt with regular was a bit to watery but the thick allowed for it to stick to the meat a lot better. We also learned to stick with the wing style chicken rather then the bigger drum-lets.  The drum sticks were way to big and the hot sauce flavor was not strong enough.

We loved the recipe but switched the order.  We boiled the wings in liquids first then grilled. We also added fresh garlic.  Either way, it is a crowd pleaser!

I loved this recipe as a base for really good hot wings. We doubled the recipe and did them in the oven. We seasoned with cajun seasoning (recipe from this site) and salt and pepper then cooked them for about half an hour before tossing them in the sauce. 2 cups honey was entirely too much (plus we didnt have it). We used 1/2 cup, I think. It added just a hint of sweetness that complimented the heat nicely. FYI: Be sure that you use good hot sauce. We only had some cheap, off brand stuff that wasn't so hot and the wings would've been beter if we'd used better, hotter sauce. Even so, these are the best wings I've had in years!!!

I made these today, along with two other types of wings (BBQ and Teriyaki) for a pre 4Th of July cookout. The Hot Honey Wings were by far the favorite of everyone. Many people asked for the recipe. Follow the recipe exactly and you won't be disappointed.

I made this for Memorial Day and we ate all of them.  I did follow some suggestions and omitted the salt.  I added garlic powder to the rub and fresh crushed garlic to the sauce.  I heated the sauce on low for a few minutes to take the raw taste out of the garlic.  This recipe is a keeper.

Everyone loved these.  a bunch of the boys asked for these to be a little hotter.  I am working on a way to keep pumping the heat up.  I decided to add ancho chile pepper with the black and cayenne.  I'll repost about the results.  I also bought some extra hot hot sauce.  we'll see what the combo does.  I put them on the grill myself.  I do not pre bake them or pre fry them,  they come out falling off the bone good.  I just toss em on direct heat to char them, and then throw them on the top rack and close the lid.  Pop in a thermostat until it reads 150 degrees.  they come out awesome! I'll let you all know about the added pepper.

These are the best wings I've ever made.  I didn't want to wait for my fryer to heat up and I never thought about grilling before.  Although I did have to get over the name of those since i do live in the 'burgh.  Let's go PENS!!!!!!!

These chicken wings were excellent. I used 4lbs of chicken and sprinkled them with cumin and salt and pepper. I then baked them in the oven for about 45 min. While they were cooking i mixed up the butter, honey and franks hot sauce. I poured that mixture over the chicken and let them cook for another 15 min. The honey carmelizes on the wings and they look and smell awesome. I will definitely be making these again! Great recipie!

Awesome and easy recipe! Followed recipe exactly except, I deep fried my wings and then tossed them in the sauce, then broiled for 3-5 minutes. I will never by wings from a restaurant again!

These wings are DANGEROUS - haha!  I have just finished preparing this dish and they are "off-the-chain"!  I promise you my wings look exactly like the photo above.  They not only look great but they taste even better.  The only thing I added was garlic and used Louisiana Hot Sauce and a side of macaroni & cheese.  This will be come a staple in my home. Thanks for sharing!

I rather disliked these.  Maybe if some direction had been given regarding what "hot sauce" to use I'd have had better luck.  The honey flavor was prominent and weird and did NOT go well with the hot sauce I used.  I could not get the sauce to "set" after I returned them to the grill.  It mostly just ran off into the fire.

We did not feel the need to baste them in honey while they were cooking and added about 1/4 cup extra hot sauce and they turned out amazing.  I served them at a party and they were gone in minutes.  My husband is a traditional wing fan and liked them, but wasn't as sold on them as others.

This made delicious, sticky, spicy wings! My wings turned out a tiny bit dry, but I think that's probably because they weren't very big and didn't have  lot of fat on them. Next time I will brush them lightly with some oil before grilling. I used tabasco instead of U.S.A. style hot sauce, and the smokey flavor worked out well. I also pulverized two cloves of garlic with a mortar and pestle, and stirred that into the glaze. I think it needs an acid, so next time I'll add some lemon juice to the glaze as well.

These were sooooo good! I was hoping the hot sauce (I used Franks) would shine through more but tasty none the less. I served Franks on the side for additional dipping. So delicious!

I just tried it for the first time today and I loved it!!  I use Frank's Hot Sauce but am looking for a better hot sauce to use.  I think I'll be eating at BWW's less and wings on my grill more.

OMG!!! This is by far some of the ABSOLUTE BEST wings we've had. My family just loved these. I've tried lots of recipes for wings (hot, sweet, tangy, fried, baked, grilled..and the list goes on and on) But these are definitely at the top of my list!!! Thanks for this great and easy recipe. Note: Similar to other reviewers I did deep fry these first to get them crispy, then brushed with honey and baked them in the oven for 15 minutes, then I added crushed garlic and dried chili peppers to the sauce. Once I brushed them with the sauce I put them back in the oven for an addt'l 10 minutes.

Fantastic recipe!! I used a simplified, indoor version - mixed everything together, poured the sauce over the chicken (I used legs the first time but I'm planning on making them again next weekend with wings!) and baked them in the oven, basting every 10-15 minutes. My boyfriend oohed, aahed, and raved about them! Definitely a big hit and I will make them again and again. :)

These wings are Awesome!!!! I made them over the summer and they were so good, everyone loved the different and new flavor these wings brought.... I didn't use the butter which was fine..... You definitley have to try these and leave them one the grill to make them nice and crispy, that's the way I like them!!

I am SO GLAD I gave this a shot for the Steeler game.  I didn't change the ingredients, only the cooking method (couldn't use my grill).  I marinated the wings in the sauce for a few hours prior, then boiled the marinade and thickened it with 1 tsp cornstarch while the wings were in the oven.  I basted the wings every 10 minutes and tossed them in the remaining cooked marinade after they were done.  These were the best wings I've ever made.  LOVED the flavor.  I'll try them on the grill when it's nicer outside.  :-)  Thanks so much for the recipe!!!

Even though i baked these wings in the oven, the hot and sweet were a fantastic combination. I added a little habanero sauce to the final basting. Very,very good.

I made these last night for my family so I could grill and watch the lunar eclipse. The sauce was perfect. I left out a bit of the hot sauce because my husband is picky and wont eat anything spicy- but I added it to my liking. The honey added just enough sweetness- delish!

The first time I made thee I realized I had purchased Frank's hot wing sauce instead of Frank's hot sauce. Rather than go back to the store and buy the correct hot sauce I thought I'd just use the wing sauce. They turned out really well. When I mentioned the error to my husband he said not to change a thing. I made a big batch of them today for him and his brother. They both raved about them. I should mention that after the first dipping in the sauce I did put them in the oven for a few minutes and then dipped them in the sauce again. Sweet, spicy and sticky. Yum!.

I made the recipe following it exactly; since the reviews were great. I thought it was ok, the flavors didn’t quite seem balanced and was bland despite the sweet heat. Also it was just too much butter for me. Glad I tried the recipe tho, I will try grilling wings again.

These wings were good and tasty but I agree with a few of the reviewers on here.  They could have had a bit more heat to them and that's with me adding more cayenne than the recipe called for.  Overall, still tasty and enjoyable.

Very tasty. I cooked and broiled in the oven. Everyone loved them and they were not too spicy. I used Cholula hot sauce, which is one of the milder hot sauces.

This is our favorite recipe.  I bake them in the oven on parchment paper and they are just as good and eliminates having to run outised and do them.

Excellent wings, very tasty, could have easily made double as they were divying them them up in the end equally amongst them - they were competing against each other to get more of them - it was crazy!

I made these for a tailgate.  Grilled them at home, added them to the sauce, and heated them up on the grill at the game.  Other than that, followed the recipe exactly.  Everyone raved about them!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I followed it exactly! What I would change is instead of serving "wet", I would set them on the grill next time. Or if serving wet, heat the sauce on the stove and add a small amount of a cornstarch-water mixture to thicken the sauce so the sauce sticks to the wings.  I will be making this again soon!

Made this a few times.  There's just two of us, so halved the recipe, but excellent every time.  We use local honey and Franks hot sauce.

We smoked the wings on the Traeger for over an hour then tossed them in the sauce and put back on the grill for a bit.  So tasty and we liked them so much we're making them again tonight!

These were gone in a heartbeat!! 
My husband BBQ'd these 30 min before I put them in the crockpot with the sauce I made a day ahead. 
I thought the sauce sitting for a day would be better tasting... :)

After forgetting to cut wings at the jointand wing BEFORE  cooking I found it much easier to cut them apart AFTER grilling.  Also, I salt, pepper and cayenne them only before grilling.  I prepare the sauce and pour over wings when they are done so it doesn't drip all down the grill and grates.  They get sticky after cooling a bit.

These were good, but far from my favorite.  I did them in the oven and think they should be grilled.  There are so many good wing recipes on this site and I think many are better than this.  It is hard to pick a favorite.

my wife thought these were the best wings I've ever made. I didn't brush the wings with honey. I made the sauce and when the wings were almost done, I put them in a bowl and coated them with the sauce as you would with buffalo wings. Returned them to a low temp. grill and finished them. you taste the sauce and the chicken. not to much spice but had a little kick. I used about half the butter it called for so the sauce was a little thicker. I will make these again very soon

I LOVED these wings. Easy cooking on the grill and not too spicy. My family are die hard Buffalo wing lovers (me too). I had chemo several years ago and can no longer handle spicy foods that. These gave me spice, with a little back heat, and sweet that soothed the spicy. Good wing for little ones too,  to start them on spicy foods. I didn't. Thank you :)

This is exactly the type of wings we were craving!   Hot, sweet, sticky . . .   mmmm delicious!
We opted to bread & deep fry our wings, then toss them in the prepared, cooked sauce.    Will definitely make again!

The best chicken wings ever. I added a 12oz bottle of honey...we like sweet...and  a little more cayenne pepper.  I also cooked it in the oven @ 425 degrees for approximately 45 mins. Instead of just basting with honey at first, I mixed it all together and basted it through the whole cooking time. Be careful because honey tends to burn. Family  loved it. This will be my go to chicken wings recipe.

The only thing I added was garlic powder with the salt, pepper, and cayenne. These turned out delicious! Will definitely make them again.

I have been making a similar recipe for years and the wings are always a popular addition to the Super Bowl party. I bake mine and then broil them to set the sauce yummy!

Love this recipe!! Cooked up all the wings I had stocked up and decided to try the sauce on chicken breasts. I make chicken breasts with this sauce at least once a week. Love pouring a little sauce on a baked potato!

I thought the flavor was good although I added much more hot sauce then the recipe noted. I would have liked them to be more crispy so I should have left them in the oven longer. Overall, good and will make it again. I will experiment more with additional seasoning because I like a lot of kick!

These were excellent.  I did not have Cayenne pepper, so did not use it.  But I did use red pepper flakes.  I also followed the suggestion of someone else and deep fried the wings first followed by application of honey & seasonings, placing them in the oven and then capped off with the hot sauce/butter mixture.  Had this with a side of fried cabbage with bacon and french fries.

Awesome.

Tastes a lot like honey! Seems like it needed more salty to balance the flavor. Not my favorite flavor with chicken.

I love them. I only used two table spoons of butter because alot of reviews said the recipe has a bit to much. And I deep fried my chicken because I cannot grill in my complex. Overall the chicken came out great. I will make these alot in the future. Thank you for sharing this recipe

My husband made these on the grill tonight. They turned out great. I don't eat wings so I had tenderloin strips done with this recipe and those were good too. We used the "buffalo" style hot sauce because we can't do super hot.

I just tried this last week because my boyfriend is OBSESSED with honey hot wings and it was very tasty for the most part I would definitely only use half a cup of honey next time because they were a little on the sweet side for me but thanks for the recipe now we wont go out as often for wings.

Love this recipe! I always use a package of 4.5 lbs of wings so I've altered the recipe a little. I use 1 tbsp cayenne, 1 tbsp fresh ground pepper and 1.5 tsp fresh ground sea salt. I use 1/2 cup of honey to baste and then use 1/3 cup each of butter, Frank's Hot Sauce and honey, which is the perfect amount to coat the wings before returning them to the grill without having too much sauce left over.

I still prefer the Carolina Tangy Gold, Buffalo, and other spicy and zesty flavors.  However, I will cook them again with more hot sauce and cayenne pepper.

I believe the recipe had TOO MUCH honey and needed more of a punch, so I ended up putting in the same amount of hot sauce as honey (they're on a 1:2 ratio on the recipe, and I like my wings a bit on the hot side).

I also used less of the butter indicated and instead simmered it for a while and added some cornstarch (whisking it with a bit of sauce in another cup first) so that it wasn't too watery and sticked better to the meat. 

The sauce tasted great with the chicken and will definitely add it as part of my regular wing sauce rotation.

Best wings, period.  The honey lends a sweetness to balance the spice.  You can control the "heat" of the wings by adding more or less of the cayenne pepper during grilling.  Note that the recipe calls for basting the wings during grilling with honey.  Keep your flame low or the sugar in the honey will burn quickly.  Followed the recipe exactly, using 1/2 cup Franks Hot Sauce, 1/2 cup honey, and 1/2 cup butter and had more than enough sauce to coat a 4 lb batch of wings with some left over.  My only change to the recipe was to return the wings to the grill after coating with the sauce and I basted the wings with the leftover sauce for a few minutes.  Absolutely the best wings I've had, even better than BWWs!

This was delicious.  We followed the directions but used drumsticks, not wings. It was spicy but not lip burning, pleasantly sweet.  Will make these again for sure.

My Family loved these wings.  the only change I made is to pour the butter sauce over the wings after grilling and then bake an additional ten to fifteen minutes in the oven at 350 degrees.

These were really good! I don't have a grill right now so I stuck the wings on a foil-lined baking sheet and sprayed some Pam on it. Baked them on 350 for about an hour, basting every 15 minutes and turning about half way through.

These were exceptional! The hubby had already marinated my wings, so I used this recipe on some drumsticks.  They were tasty.  We like things very spicy in our house, so I think I will add a little more heat next time.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Thank you for this recipe!!!!  There was a restaurant here that made THE BEST honey hot wings- and they closed.  It was a SAD DAY for me....but now, I've got this recipe!!!!  YAY!  I made this with grilled chicken legs for dinner last night and they were AWESOME- the exact combination of hot and sweet that we crave here!  I didn't change anything in the recipe and was happy all night!

These were great. I don't really measure when cooking but I stuck pretty close to this recipe and it was a hit with my boyfriend. I wanted my wings a little bit hotter then this so I just added some more hot sauce on mine. These are a great sweet and hot mix. Thanks for the great recipe.  I used the left over hot sauce mix to pourover some spare ribs, YUM.

Its good, but I wish it had more of a spice kick.. I had tripled the amount for the hotsauce and cayenne pepper and it barely was spicy. Maybe next time I'll omit the butter like one of the other members did just to have that spicy flavor. But overall its not bad..

This is about the same as "sweet spicy wings" on this site.  Either way they are good.  You can also bake them or deep fry and then pour the sauce on.

My family and friends love this recipe!
I bake the wings for 30-40min at 375 and then marinade the wings overnight in the sauce (i omit the cayenne - too hot for the kids - and would add minced garlic instead). The next day - I bake them again for 10-15 min.
They come out nice and crispy - not as crisp as deep frying but a little more healthy.

I made this yesterday using boneless chicken breast. It was okay. I had quite a bit left so I figured I'd have it tonight, and it was so much better! Awesome in fact. My suggestion would be to let it marinate in the sauce overnight so it really soaks it up. 
I also made homemade french fries and we dipped them in the extra sauce.

Full of rich flavour; one of the best chicken wings I've made. I suggest marinating it over-night for the wings to have more flavour. For the cayanne pepper and sauce I put very litte, nu-uh, bad idea. The spicer, the better! Don't put butter or salt; its salty enough and we don't need extra fat. It tasted just fine and I didn't add salt or butter. Once again, delicious!

This dish was absolutely delicious! I cooked them in the oven for 40 minutes on 400 turning them over halfway through then added the sauce and allowed to cook for another 30. The wings were so tender and the meat literally fell right off the bone! Will definitely make again!

These were incredible. We had them for a recent football game party. Although we had too much sauce left over, there were no wings left. I've already requested that my husband make them again for the next game.

Great recipe. But if cooked on a grill make sure to spray the grill with cooking spray first to avoid sticking. The taste will keep them coming back for more.

These wings were DELICIOUS, but a little too spicy.  I will definately use this again, but cut the cayenne a little, and cut the hot sauce with a little more butter.  Thanks for sharing.

This "Hot Wing" recipe was the best I have ever tasted. My son and I make wings all the time and we came across this recipe and agreed to try something new. We made them together and I am glad we did. They were a BIG HIT at our 4th of July BBQ!!!!! We will be making them again and again....

I tried this recipe with chicken breasts instead and they still turned out pretty good. The only thing that I needed was to add a little more hot sauce. Man they look pretty good too!

This was my first time ever doing wings and was an easy, great recipe for chicken.  I made this exactly as written- with extra hot sauce- and the flavor really was excellent.  The only complaint I heard was that it made for great barbeque chicken, but these just "weren't very hot wing-ish". While I'll definitely be making these again (possibly on other cuts), this hasn't ended my search for an excellent hot wing. Thanks though, it was still absolutely worth trying!

Very good.  I happened to have some left over pineapple juice from a salad I was making sitting in front of me when I was making the sauce for these wings and added it, about 1/4 c, even better!

I made the sauce for this and put it over some seasoned grilled chicken cutlets, and it was absolutely delicious.  It had the perfect amount of heat, and the honey really added to the flavor of it.  My friends can never decide between traditional buffalo wings and honey bbq wings, and I think this recipe will keep everyone happy.

Excellent recipe! I made these for our Memorial Day cookout and everybody raved. I was called away from the grill while basting with honey and a few burned slightly in spots. They were still delicious but I think next time I will put them in the oven for that part, then finish on the grill.

This recipe tasted so good and I thank you for it.  I only made it one time, but I plan on making it plenty more times.

Amazing, awesome recipe.  I added a little garlic to the tossing sauce and did grill them for a couple of minutes after tossing.  Husband gave it a 10 on 10.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I just made these tonight, they were a hit!  My mother-in-law says she doesn't normally like chicken wings, but she really enjoyed these.  I was actually very pleasantly surprised by the flavor.  I figured I'd like them, why would I bother otherwise, but they exceeded my expectations.  These will definitely be made again!

Fabulous recipe! I did add the extra cayenne pepper because we like our wings hot. Followed the recipe exactly and cooked on the grill. 
Simply wonderful!!

I made this recipe on a cold Friday evening and it was a BIG hit. The kids loved it! Unfortunately I bought a cheap spicy sauce that had too much vinegar taste but that was my fault. I added some red chili flakes    along with the cayenne pepper and it was delicious!! Thanks a LOT for sharing!!
