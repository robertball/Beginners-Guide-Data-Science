The fresh dill is the key ingredient. I was surprised at how easy and tasty this was while being very easy to make. I will add peas or asparagus next time to round it out.

I was quite excited about this recipe and I must admit, I really enjoyed it.  However, I could have frozen to death from the cold stares that I received from everyone else around the table.

I understand what they feel.  A large block of cream cheese does not a sauce make.

Since I try to stay away from white flour and processed food, I always use whole wheat pasta so of course this will absorb more sauce and make every sauce just a little bit more dry.

I would and will make this recipe again but with a classic alfredo sauce to which I shall add the salmon, lemon, pepper, onions, and dijon.

Oh well, more left overs for me!

If you love smoked salmon as much as my husband and I do, you HAVE to try this recipe!  I used smoked salmon that I made in my smoker using apple wood and, for the water, apple juice.  It turned out great!
I grow my own herbs so I had fresh dill, just not the amount called for, so I used what fresh I had and used dry to make  up the amount called for.  I also didn't have quite enough cream cheese so I  used ricotta to make up the difference.
The results were amazing. 
Great recipe that I have now saved for the future!  Sooooooo good!

I used 1 Tblsp. dill and then added more to taste. I made this recipe using good Ricotta with cream cheese + milk  pre-sauted Leeks & add frozen peas at end or 1/2" pieces of Asparagus.

This was not at all what I expected. With the word "creamy" in the recipe name, I thought the salmon & pasta would be in a creamy sauce. It was not. Mine was tasty, but VERY dry, even though I ended up doubling the cream cheese in an effort to have some sauce. Throwing the cooked pasta & reserved water back into the pot, adding all the remaining ingredients, and stirring until the cream cheese melts, as the recipe instructs, did not work well at all. I may make it again, but with changes (additional liquid, for sure) to make an actual sauce with smoked salmon, lemon & dill. Nevertheless, it was tasty.

My picky 1 and 2 year olds absolutely loved this and it was super easy.  I didn't have smoked salmon so i just baked some fillets in the oven for about 15 minutes then shredded them.  Turned out great and made enough food for lunch the next day.  If your kids like fish and noodles then this is a sure winner
