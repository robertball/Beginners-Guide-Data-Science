Absolutely delicious!! The sauce was to die for. I didn't have enough ketchup so I substituted a cup of the ketchup for Lucille's Original BBQ sauce. It was fabulous! Thank you for this wonderful recipe - we loved it. This sauce would make a fantastic glaze on a meatloaf too - going to give THAT a shot!

Holy cow these are a huge hit in my house!! The only thing I did different was I browned the meatballs in a frying pan with a bit of olive oil. It was very easy to make and I tripled the recipe!! Had everyone over for dinner. I had sauteed spinach on the side for a complete dinner. Yummmm!

I thought this tasted pretty good. It was something different. The sauce ingredients seemed kind of odd to me at first, but they made a nice flavored sweet and sour ketchup sauce. I used lean ground beef and low-fat milk and it didn't seem to be a problem. The meatballs ended up being giant! The 12 meatballs equalled 4 scoops with a standard cookie scoop. Clean-up was fairly easy to. I ended up using a 13x9 disposable pan, leftover from the last holiday, and putting it on a sheet pan. The recipe makes lots of sauce. I ate it with some litely buttered rice, from the rice cooker, and a small salad. One meatball, with sides, easily filled me up. TY

I did this a little differently, and instead of throwing everything into the oven, I let it simmer on the stove while I prepared and fried the meatballs, and then tossed the meat into the sauce and let it simmer longer until the rice was done. I also used cornstarch to thicken it since I took the stove-top shortcut. I was very skeptical of the sauce, but it turned out fantastic. It was absolutely perfect with the meatballs and served over rice. I've done different recipes before and they were too sweet that even my kids wouldn't eat it. The tomato sauce really mellowed it out.

Loved this recipe! At first I thought the sauce was way too sweet but once it cooled and I kept eating it, it wasn't so bad. I served this over rice and my husband just gobbled this up! It was a little too much for just 2 people but it gave us lunch for the next day. Will definitely make again! I'm interested in trying this sauce with other proteins instead of beef, like kielbasa or maybe even chicken.

We really enjoyed this although it is very sweet.  I might cut back a bit on the sugar next time.  There was enough sauce to completely fill the 9x13 dish. I noticed the contributor said she doubled the sauce, so next time I will probably cut it in half.

We didn't love this recipe at all.  I'm sad to say the meatballs had no flavor and it made a ton of sauce that also had no flavor.  It was edible so we ate it and I was asked by my husband and son not to make this again and I agree.

I love this recipe, I make my meatballs much smaller, it just takes more prep time, they are great on hot dog buns as well as rice or pasta

I've made this MANY times already and we love it - it makes more than enough sauce so you could cut it back a little bit if you wanted to.  We love it every time I make it - it's become a "frequent flyer" with my menu planning!

I only used the brown sugar to cut back on sugar and it was great! I used frozen meatballs for a quick meal.

I wanted to try something different and this recipe sounded delicious!  I was, however, forced to make 2 changes because of not having the right and correct amount of ingredients.  My only tweaks were adding 6 honey garlic Italian sausage links (out of casing) to the ground beef and using meat sauce rather than tomato sauce (was out of tomato sauce).  Other than that, this dish turned out superb!  I served over rice as suggested and my husband just loved it!  I'll be making this dish again!  Thank you Rebekah!

We didn't have a lot of time tonight so we just used frozen meatballs, but that sauce is spot on. I adorned it with chopped green belpeppers, onions, and pineapple and it came out great!

Delicious! I make the meatballs my own way but the sauce in this recipe is super good. I leave out part of the white sugar.

Meatballs are tender but the sauce is a little too sweet for me. Next time I’d make it with less of the sugars but it’s still delicious! Just like how my grandma used to make them!!

The meatballs themselves were bland. The sauce was too sweet, and I had lowered the amount of sugar and ketchup required. Loved the tang of the spices, and I would try it again with less sweetness.

I wanted to rate this 3.5 stars b/c they are better than ok.  Just too sweet for us, AND I didn't even use all the sugar it said to!  I used 1/2c each.  Next time I'll use even less.  Good spicy twist to it, if you can get the sugar balanced correctly, I think.

I gave this a 5 star because it is a fabulous BASE recipe that can easily be changed to suit your family's taste buds!  All of my family enjoys this, even the toddler who normally won't eat ANYTHING with a sauce on it!!  First time, made as written... it was good, but was missing something.  Second time, I used my meatball recipe, cut sauce in 1/2 and added 1/2 tsp rice vinegar and 1/2 tsp lemon juice to the sauce... MUCH better and with this I realized it was versatile.  Last night, I used the sauce recipe with stir fry veggies/ chicken and served over rice... FABULOUS!!  Add soy sauce (to taste) and it makes a very light terriyaki sauce.  Thank you SOOOOOOO much!!!

Oh Wow!! So tasty!! Pretty easy too, and most are ingredients are pantry items that you have already.  I was craving a meatball with a sweet flavor and this did the trick!  I just ate the meatballs but my husband (who needs a lot of food) ate it on some white rice which was obviously easy to make....definitely make this again.
