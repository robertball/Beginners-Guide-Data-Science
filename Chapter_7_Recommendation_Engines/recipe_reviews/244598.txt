I used breadcrumbs instead of stuffing.  Ground it fine with pecans and cheese.   Worked out fine.  Really liked it.

Crunchy crust and a nice mild fish.  Great recipe.  Made it with the spicy garden coleslaw and it was a perfect meal.

This was super good! The title however is a little misleading. The parm is not dominant and the 2 tablespoons kind of get lost in the mix so don't count on a strong parm flavor. It is however a great recipe and one  I will make again.

Simple and tasty!  Used sole: nicely complements a mild fish.  Used low salt stuffing mix.  Excellent idea to dry fish fillets before dipping in flour.  Because we had multiple fillets, I made the stuffing coating mix  in smaller batches to keep it dry.  Needed to fry them on a lower temperature (gas stove) or the coating overcooked before the fish was done.   Can be fried in batches and kept warm in the oven.
