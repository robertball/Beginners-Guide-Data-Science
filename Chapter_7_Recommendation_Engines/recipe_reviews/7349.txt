The best chocolate cake I've ever made.  If you're looking for something basic and fluffy and chocolatey, this is the way to go.  I've made it several times: Once the way it is written, which was really good, once with bittersweet chips which was also really good, and once with bittersweet chips and an added 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder with the flour mixture--EVEN BETTER!  It also tastes just great if you replace half the oil with applesauce for a slightly reduced fat version. Replace the eggs with a quarter cup applesauce and the milk with soy milk for a surprisingly delicious vegan version.  Very versatile, and exactly that "boxed mix" texture but with out the boxed mix flavor.  The batter may seem a bit runny but don't worry, that's what it's supposed to be like.  Also, don't forget to have boiling water on hand.  It won't work with cold water. UPDATE:  I have officially made this into Mocha cupcakes:  sub boiling H2O with boiling very strong coffee (or espresso).  Use semi sweet chocolate instead of unsweetened chocolate.  Deelish.  Makes aprox. 2 doz. or a few more. YET ANOTHER UPDATE: for some reason the wording on the recipe has changed.  It used to say "1 cup boiling water" and now it just says "water."  This makes a huge difference.  I can't remember why.  I'm sure Alton Brown could explain it.  I just remember reading somewhere that this is crucial in some food sciencey way.

well, if the vineger in this recipe is giving you pause, don't let it! this chocolate cake recipe was my THIRD try--that's right, 3rd! the first two were HERSHEY recipes, one turned out screaming dry, and the other..? over-moist and soft like baby food. ick--(shame, shame, hershey.) i don't know why i didn't just log on here sooner! this recipe is perfectly moist and oh, so chocolat-ee. the only thing is, i only had semi-sweet choc. left in my pantry, so the cake was more medium brown than that great dark, dark devil's food look for which i was searching. but, i'm not worried, there will be more chances for me to attempt that dark chocolate look. oh yes, i'll be making this again and again!--thanks debra!

I have to say this was very likely the best devil's food cake I have ever baked and eaten.  Moist, loved the texture.  I added about 1 tsp of vanilla, and baked it in two 8" round pans.  Turned out nice and high.  Perfect chocolate cake.

After reading all the comments on this recipe, I was convinced it was going to turn out terrific.  I followed the directions exactly.  After 30 minutes, I checked the cake; it shook like Santa's belly when I began to remove it from the oven.  I therefore kept it in a few more minutes and then checked it more.  Still not done.  This time the sides were more cooked but the middle was completely uncooked.  Next time I checked it (after a few more minutes), the entire middle portion of the cake sunk!  I let it bake until it was done, but the cake was ruined.  I verified that my oven temperature was set properly and that there's not a problem with the internal temperature setting.  Overall, what a disappointment.  I'd say it was me, but other recipes have turned out just fine.  What's so distressing is that I live in Japan and ingredients are hard to come by and are expensive when you can find them... what a wate of time and money.

A little time consuming to put together. Didn't come out right at all. After the time for baking was over, it was still raw in the middle. Sank in the middle as well. Didn't even taste chocolaty. I made this recipe twice and still had the same disappointing results.

This was one of the best chocolate cakes I've made yet! It was unanimous that everyone loved it(which is rare!). Absolutely no taste of vinegar whatsoever. I also used bitter-sweet chocolate, and cut back 1/2 cup off the sugar. Turned out sooo great! thanks sooo much for this awesome recipe!I used the satiny glaze on it...beautiful!

I made this cake for my mother-in-law's birthday and frosted it with Snow Peak Frosting.  This was a great combination.  I made the cake the day before and it was good and moist the next day when I served it.  It smells incredible when it is baking!

The cake was very good. It had a great chocolate flavor. It was very moist and stayed good a long time--I made it Wednesday and it was still good on Saturday. I'd definately make it again!

this cake is pretty good--it has a good flavor and a nice texture.  I did however add 8 oz of chocolate (instead of 3) and replaced the water with milk.  I also replaced half of the butter with applesauce (this reduces the fat and makes cakes moist).  i filled it with buttercream frosting and topped it with chocolate ganache from this site.  a good basic chocolate cake.

This is just a good, old-fashioned chocolate cake.  Medium chocolate, not too dark.  Delicious and stick to your fork moist.  Lighter in texture with a more open crumb, (NOT the pound cake texture the submitter described), just as a good old-fashioned cake ought to be.  Rather than water I substituted brewed coffee (half for me, half for the cake), and buttermilk for the milk and vinegar because I had it on hand to use.   I frosted it with my own Chocolate Buttercream, no recipe, just dumped and mixed an egg, powdered sugar, unsweetened cocoa powder, butter,  vanilla and heavy cream until it looked right.  Not a fancy cake, just a delicious one, the kind Grandma made decades ago.

As suggested i used one cup coffee to replace water (decaf) and 6 oz of chocolate. With these changes it is 5 stars.. so Good! I also used the recommended frosting from the description. yum yum yum. Make this with these changes and you will not be dis-sastisfied.

I made this cake exactly as stated except I didn't have white vinegar so I used champagne vinegar and the whole thing just fell apart! Even though I made it with top notch chocolate it tasted like mud! It was my first big baking disaster since I made it on Thanksgiving morning to celebrate my nephews birthday and for the second dessert!!  What a mess.  The next day I used a Williams Sonoma devils food cake recipe with chocolate frosting from their site and redeemed myself.  Better late than never!!  I cannot imagine that the vinegar was the culprit...but I'll never know because I won't try the recipe again.  Just be warned:  Don't substitute any other vinegar for the white vinegar if you make this cake!

Tasty, moist, and relatively easy to make. It is a bit of a fussy cake as it has to be cooked at the correct temperature and time and if not the center can get a bit droopy. I used two 9 inch pans and it took me 30 minutes to bake it completely. Made this for a friend's birthday party and iced it with the Rich Chocolate Frosting and it was absolutely devoured. Will definitely make again.

This IS the best devil's food cake, truly sinfully Delicious.. and addictive. Rich and moist. Only revision being that I add my vinegar  to my milk prior to preparing the rest of my ingredients and I add good 1/4 cup or semi sweet chocolate chips instead of the squares letting it melt into the butter on low temp. then I add 1/4 cocoa powder to the chocolate and let it sit a few mins then carry on as recipe instructs. Oh and It actually takes a good 40- 45 mins to bake at 350 not 30. It is worth the time tho. Very good. I added a Raspberry Filling in the center and a vanilla butter cream icing on top.

I wanted a good, rich, moist, decadent chocolate cake, and with my modifications- AMAZING. I I subbed strong coffee for the water, and buttermilk instead of the milk and vinegar. Perfection!

I followed the recipe exactly and it smelled amazing as it was baking.  However, it turned out extremely dry - it crumbled everywhere....needed milk to simply swallow it.  Will not make this again.

Great recipe. The texture was a nice thick cake- not as 'solid' as a pound cake - but for sure not thin feeling like a box mix.  You could for sure taste that it was from scratch.  I would however add in more chocolate.  I like a bit of a more chocolate richness. I will make this again and do a flavored filling to add something!

After reading all the reviews, I decided to make this cake because my family is crazy about chocolate cake.  They do have a lesser sweet tooth and need to monitor their cholestorol.  I doctored the recipe to: only 1 1/4 cup of sugar, 5/8 cup of cocoa powder instead of chocolate, and 1/2 cup vegetable oil instead of butter. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 Tbsp of instant coffee. Worrying the cake may be dry due to the reduction in sugar, I added 1.5 Tbp corn starch since I read pudding mix is basically corn starch and many recipes have pudding mix in them to add moistrue.  I baked the cake in two 8" square pans, one metal and one glass for 25 minutes.  The one in glass comes out super moist, and the metal one less so but still good. Actually my daughter prefers the less moist one.  My family devoured the whole thing in 2 days. I have a feeling this would become a family tradition to bake this cake whenever someone has a craving for chocolaty dessert.

I read several of the reviews before making this and was a little worried but made it anyway. It turned out to be the best I have ever had as far as Devil's Food Cakes.  I have save this recipe to use again. I did actually at a tsp of vanilla and I used apple cider vinigar instead of the white vinigar.  LOVE IT.

I made this cupcakes to take to a New Years Day Party.  I altered the recipe by using coffee instead of water and I added a tsp of vanills.  They cooked for exactly 15 min.  I filled and frosted them with the Fluffly Peanut Butter icing from this site, then topped with chocolate chips!  Everyone at the party loves them!  Better than the "Funny Bones" of our childhood.   Next time I will try frost them with a layer of chocolate gancache with a peanut butter flourish on top!  Will definitely make again!

Excellent recipe. Dense, moist and lovely looking cake. I baked mine in a bunt pan, turned the heat to 325 and cooked for 50 mins. The only disappointment was the lack of chocolate. I should have heeded the advice of many others and add in the 1/2 C. of Cocoa. Had I have done so I just KNOW it would've been right on the mark.

I have made this cake twice.  First time I had no chocolate so i used 100gm of unsweetened cocoa powder...just desolved it in the melted butter. I was surprised at the results...wow....it was my best chocolate cake ever!  Second time I used recommended 84gm chocolate and I was a bit dissapointed as the texture was different..it seemed heavier and too dense as compared to the light and fluffy one I made first.  So..the moral of the story is!.give the cocoa a shot! It worked better for me...just a delicious cake.  Awesome recipe thanks!

Great Cake! Very easy, baked perfectly - moist and light and wonderful chocolate flavor. I used brewed coffee (no instant on hand). I also was out of chocolate squares, so subbed 1/2 and 1/2 Hershey's Regular and Special Dark coco then added veg. shortening to the butter per Hershey's directions for subbing dry coco.  Used a basic butter cream frosting and cake recieved many compliments.

Fantastic dense chocolaty cake!  Wouldn't change a thing!  Those who had trouble....make sure your baking soda is fresh.  If you are making in a glass 9x13 pan, you will need 35-40 minutes to cook through the middle.  Will make this again!

I followed the recipe exactly and it did not turn out very good at all. I always try to do the recipe as it is written before tweaking it, but this is one that if I do use again (and I doubt I would) I would defiantly change a few things in, as per other members suggestions.

Eh.. I found them as tasting o.k. The texture wasn't that great and I felt that it didn't taste as much like chocolate as it should have.

I don't know if italian baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) is different from the american one but it gave the cake the most awful flavour. i'll try to make the cake with baking powder instead.... But the result this time was very disappointing.

I have made numerous cakes from scratch and this is by far the best one every. I did use dark chocolate chips and 1/4 cup natural process cocoa and decreased the sugar in it to 1.5 cups because we prefer dark chocolate and less sweet. I made it for my husband and grandsons birthday party and everyone there said it was the best cake they had ever eaten. It was even a bigger hit than the red and blue velvet spiderman cake which was also a from scratch cake. I am using this recipe for cupcakes and cake balls for the sweet table at a wedding I am catering this weekend.

So this cake has now been sitting in the oven for almost an hour, in a 13x9" pan, and the center of it is mucky and wet. The house doesn't smell like chocolate: it smells like burnt popcorn. I followed the recipe to the letter, and I have to say that I'm dreading the results. Not the least bit impressed, especially as I was making it for a birthday party.  Would not try it again.

Fabulously old school chocolate cake! The negative reviews made me nervous at first, but it turns out beautifully, every time. 

Strong coffee instead of water, and 2x the chocolate = nom nom nom! It doesn't need frosting, but I'm making it for my daughter's 5th birthday, with pink buttercream.

THANKYOU! This cake is wonderfully easy! It only took me about 10 minutes but I didn't have and eggs, so I googled it and it sayed to substitute milk, so I did. So far, it looks INCREDIBLE, smells EVEN BETTER and I can't wait to taste it on sunday- it's going into a 5-layer cake with 3 layers choc, 2 layer strawberry cheesecake topped off with strawberry icing and chocolate covered strawberries..... Happy birthday mom

After seeing the high ratings and reading the reviews I thought this was going to be an amazing recipe. I bake a lot and have really good pans that all but guarantee that cakes will turn out. Unfortunately, this one did not. Although I have a pan that distributes heat evenly, i found that the bottom half was starting to become dry before the center was cooked. I finally had to pull it out of the oven. Normally when I read this kind of review I believe the baker did something wrong, but in this case I believe there's something wrong with the recipe. 
However, the parts that did cook turned out delicious, so I cut the cake in half, cut off the top to make it even, scooped out the uncooked part and made the top the bottom half. I then filled the middle with a mixture of raspberry jam, jello mix and the crumbled remnants of the top of the cake. It turned out quite delicious and didnt waste good ingredients.

I have to agree with several reviewers on here. You definitely need to add more chocolate (at least eight ounces) and swap the water out with milk. Overall, a great basic chocolate cake, however one that absolutely relies on the frosting. Most cakes are good on their own. This one smells great, but doesn't really deliver that much once eaten. Pick a great frosting and it will be okay. Would I make again?  Nah. I'm an avid baker and chocoholic and this did nothing for me.

I don't know what happened, but the cake seemed to have exploded in the oven and was all over it when I took it out.  It pretty much fell apart when I tried to take it out of the pan.

This is THE worst Devil's Food recipe I've ever tried. Not very chocolaty at all, more like red velvet without the dye! Also extremely dry even though I took it out of the oven several minutes before the recommended time. I made this for my husband's birthday and we ended up throwing it away!

Very good. You have to be careful to fully cook or the center does flop quite easily. My second attempt turned out great.

Although this isn't the absolute best devil's food chocolate cake I've ever had, it's the best one I've personally ever MADE!  Lots of the recipes on this site gave me chocolate cake that looked lighter in color and didn't have that deep chocolate flavor I was looking for.  This one was really good with tweaking that I did from others' advice.  I found this a TAD dry, but it could've been from how I baked it.  I made mini cupcakes with this baked at 350 degrees for 15 minutes...i suspect i should've baked them for maybe 12 or 13 minutes.  Also, I added 1/2 tsp of instant coffee granules and 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract to the warm butter/chocolate mixture and used a few tablespoons of bittersweet chocolate chunks.  To make it even EXTRA chocolatey I took the advice to add 1/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder to the dry mix.  I'm hoping this turns out even better next time I make it cuz that would be to die for!  And oh yeah, i topped this with a dollop of cream cheese frosting. Perfection.

great cake, i didn't wait until it was cold to cut it and it crumble a bit and i'm glad it did cause i nibbled all the crumbs :P .
i also come from Italy and the taste was just fine, no baking soda problems, maybe Manuela didn't put enough vinegar.
I made sure i had the exact amount of soda and vinegar weighted and measured to a T.
EDIT:I used the filling from "Eclairs II" and toped it with chocolate and syruped cherries.It was to die for.Hubby and myself ate it alone cause we didn't wanna share.

This was a great cake! The Chocolate Fudge Buttercream Frosting went really well and the whole thing was devoured by three people in only two days! Try filling with the frosting or hot fudge topping--both are good.

I failed this recipe. I wanted to make cup cakes and didn't think about the amount of baking soda actually in the batter. I had an over flow of cake batter, it was a horrible mess. I will try this recipe again but will make a real cake.  That being said my two year old loved the batter.

This is by far the best chocolate cake I have ever made. It reminds me of the cake from the movie Matilda. My family requests it all the time. I once made it with whole wheat flour but you could really taste it and it didn’t go as fast. :) Bake as is!

Very good chocolate cake.  Very chocolatey, moist and dense.  Don't be put off by the vinegar; vinegar + milk = buttermilk, so it's just like using buttermilk in a recipe.  I had some trouble with the bottom sticking on one of my layers, but the next time I used a greased parchment circle on the bottom of the pan and it came out nice and clean, no sticking.  Give this one a try!

I didn't have squares of chocolate, so used 3 TBSP of cocoa with an extra TBSP of butter per square, and instead of the vinegar, I used actual buttermilk. It went together so quickly and it was moist and delicious. I made a cocoa buttercream icing. Wi!ll definitely make again

Even though my cake was defintely different from what the pictures looked like (like always), I loved it alot! I made a few changes, since I halfed it to make a 9-inch pie and I increased it to 4 ounces of chocolate (I mixed a little cocoa powder and chocolate chips), decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup and increased temperature to 200 degrees celcius and decreased the time to 26 mins (well, it was a mistake :b)

My son asked for homemade Devil's Food Cake for his 16th birthday.  This cake was perfect!!  
For other reviewers who question the vinegar:  Put 1 tsp vinegar in a measuring cup and add the milk.  The vinegar turns whole milk into buttermilk, which is what gives the cake its moist, but dense, texture.

Awesome cake recipe.  Made it for someone's b-day and everyone loved it.  I used 4oz's of unsweetened chocolate because I love chocolate....turned out great!!  I'm sure 3oz's would be fine though.  Highly recommended.

This recipe is good, but not outstanding.  I wouldn't say it has the "pound cake like texture," but rather a regular chocolate cake texture.  The recipe is good, though because all ingredients are generally on hand.

Nothing special. Has a slightly odd flavor too. This is very simple to make and it tastes exactly like King Arthur Flour's Favorite Fudge Cake. I made half and used 1/4t. salt and added 1t. vanilla extract. I wouldn't make this again because I've had better.

I had some unsweetened chocolate I wanted to use up - the other recipes call for cocoa or semi-sweet.  I followed the directions precisely.  I read many other reviews - and found the cooking time to be accurate.  My cakes also came out puffed in the center, but they were cooked relatively evenly and entirely.  The only concern was a little difficulty getting them out of the pans (they're a bit dense) - and the edges are crust-like.  They re not super chocolately tasting IMHO.  But with a fudgey or milk chocolate frosting, they are fine.  I will use this recipe again to finish off my unsweetened chocolate (hubby loves chocolate cake).

This ale was awful.  I used 2 round ale pans.  It rose in the center and was coming over the edge.  At 30 mins., I tested with toothpick so, I cooked 3 mins. more.  Tested again and still a letter wet.  Cooked 3 more mins and took out.  It was like brownie on the edge and sinking in the middle.  Tried to get out of pan.  It was shaped weird.  The second pan crumbled everywhere.

A lot of work for an average cake. My husband really liked it, but I thought it was dry and I cooked it for exactly 30 minutes (I did 2, 9-inch rounds). I know some others said it was not cooked through at the specified time, but I had the opposite problem.  I used the best chocolate and butter I could find and I wish I had chosen a different recipe to use it in.

We love this cake. It is so chocolatey and yet not too sweet. I don't ice it ,just serve with ice cream once in a while. We do have a couple  of type 2 diabetics in the family and I wanted the cake to be something they could enjoy too.  So the last two times I made this cake, I decided to try  using one cup Stevia and one cup sugar instead of the two cups of sugar.   I was pleasantly surprised to discover that this substitution resulted in a lighter texture and a higher rising cake. Still the same great taste.
EDIT: After reading a number of reviews that mentioned problems with the vinegar and also the baking soda  in the recipe, I realized what was going on. My husband, an old "scratch cake" baker from childhood told me that the milk and vinegar components of the recipe really do have to  be added last during the final mixing phase. This is because the chemical reaction between the milk, the vinegar, and the baking soda are what causes the cake to rise. If  the vinegar is not added, or the baking soda is omitted it will not rise.  The only thing that he thinks would work as a substitution would be baking powder.
The first two times I made this cake, it fell in the middle. It ended up being  more like a brownie in the center. This did not happen the third time, and I think it is because that time I was very careful to get  the mix into the oven faster than I had the last two times. I think you have to be very aware that the rising formula is actually time sensitive, and don't

This cake is delicious! I was sure I'd messed up because with the "help" of my five year old we had soup instead of cake batter, but the cook time and temperature were spot on and instead we got moist, chocolatey cakes.  I used the recommended Chocolate Fudge Buttercream Frosting and the result was heavenly! I will never go back to boxed mixes again.

I loved this cake!!! What I hate the most though is that people say they made this cake yet they swapped out most of the ingredients and changed the proportions of things in the original recipe. Guess what?! You did not make the recipe that you said you did. If you are not making it as listed you are making your own recipe!!! This means that you writing a review of this cake when you did not make this cake is ridiculous! Post your own cake recipe and review it for yourself but do not bother writing a review if you do not follow the authors instructions and measurements.

Followed exactly how she wrote it, came out perfectly! Made it for my dad's bday so I haven't tried it except for the toothpick test. I used 2 9in round pans. Thanks, Debra!!

I used this recipe for cupcakes and they were a complete failure! They overflowed and fell. I have been baking for years and never had this happen with a recipe. May be better if it was a cake instead of cupcakes but not worth how temperamental the batter is and would need more chocolate!

I made cupcakes from this recipe, baking them 15-20 minutes or until the tops sprang back and a toothpick came out clean.  Previous reviewers commented that their cupcakes sank in the middle - mine didn't but were lovely and puffed on top.  Another reviewer also commented that the cake dried out the next day.  I kept my cupcakes in a cake keeper (so lightly covered) and they were nice and moist this morning.  Hubby did agree with a reviewer who stated that there wasn't much chocolate taste to this recipe, but I thought it was lovely.  I didn't frost the cupcakes as we were taste-testing the recipe itself, but chocolate frosting might have changed his mind!  Overall, this was a great recipe.  I will probably make it again!

i have these cupcakes in the oven as we speak... i will be rating them as soon as they cool!  i did have to make a few changes based on what i had on hand: i didn't have unsweetened chocolate but rather a high quality dark chocolate so i reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup.  also, because i have a new, spiffy espresso machine i decided to put 1/2 cup espresso and 1/2 cup hot water (instead of 1 cup hot water).  i was a bit confused about the milk/vinegar because the recipe says to combine them first and then put in the batter.  should i have let it sit for five minutes to sour?  it wasn't mentioned so i didn't do it but i did wonder... :)  to be continued... UPDATE:  these are good cupcakes, don't get me wrong, but the texture doesn't convince me.  i will keep looking and trying other recipes until i find "the one." at the same time i made these i also made "simple white cake" cupcakes (from this site) and i was very impressed!  a light, velvety texture... UPDATE (again!): i froze my cupcakes because i had made them a few days in advance, after thawing and frosting them (with chocolate cheese frosting from this site) they were FABULOUS!  people couldn't stop raving about them!  in the end, after freezing and decorating them i think these were more popular than the simply white cupcakes! so i'm adjusting my score to 5 stars! :)

This is a great recipe.  I poured chocolate ganache over each layer of 2 9in round cakes.  Then on top of each layer I placed fresh raspberries.  Soooooo Goooood!!!!!  You could use strawberries as well.  Oh, on the first layer I sliced the raspberries in half but left them whole on top of the cake so it looked nice.

The cake is amazing!!  It took a little longer to bake, but that may have been a problem with my oven.  I made it for a birthday on Thanksgiving with cream cheese frosting andeveyone loved it, even those who didn't like chocolate said they loved the cake!

Mediocre at best. I constantly checked it in the oven to see if it was done, and one minute the toothpick came out wet and the next minute, it was clean but the cake was DRY! Not terrible, but I probably won't make it again.

It was very good and easy to make. I heated up the chocolate and butter in the microwave in a small pyrex bowl. I always do this because it is quciker and easier than using a double boiler. I also used German chocolate cake style icing for it. It was very delicious.

This one is a keeper!  I made this for an early Father's Day cake and it was a huge hit.  The cake was incredibly moist (I'm a little paranoid about dry cake so I did use a little simple syrup brushed on the cake just to make sure).  I frosted with a buttercream and it was absolutely fantastic!

I just tried this recipe this weekend.  It tasted good but not as I have expected.  I wanted my cake to be really dark (in color) just like in the photo.  But mine ended brown.  I did substitute semi-sweet coco powder instead of using unsweetened chocolate chips.

I did not understand this recipe and that might have been why it came out tasting very unusual and my family personaly disliked it...also maybe the cocoa powder i used was wrong or old because it formed little balls still in the cake after i baked it. They tasted hard. Sorry but not using this recipe again. But as I said you can try it I may have made it incorrectly.

Yummy! Moist but not  overly so. I would like to try it with a different frosting  next time. It was probably my fault, but the frosting was way too sweet for us.

This cake was really fun to make! I have an electric mixer and it was pretty easy. I enjoyed watching the yolks and water turn from half-transperant to custard yellow. The mixture was so pretty! I had a really good time baking. The finished product was very yummy too! Thumbs up! ^^

So fast and easy! And it worked great in my first-ever cake, a 4-layer chocolate cake with chocolate fudge frosting. Everyone I gave some to absolutely adored it.
