Excellent recipe.  I read the other reviews and have to concur that onions are an essential part of what I remember about Chipped Ham BBQ sandwiches.  We use Heinz Ketchup of course and chili sauce with brown sugar and a tiny bit of liquid smoke.  I will make this recipe as a change up for our recipe.  Thanks for submitting it.

Great, simple food!!! I grew up on these. Just a few changes the way my Mom made them. Start with Sauteed onions and add sweet relish. I miss Isley's chipped ham. You just can't order "a pound of Chipped Ham" at a deli in the South,  you have to explain how to slice it. 9 of 10 times they still get it wrong. LOL Thanks for posting.

I grew up in Cleveland, but my parents are from SW PA... we had this sandwich all the time when I was little.  I was asking somebody about it the other day and they never heard of it. Thank you for posting this recipe, now I can show it to everybody!!  Very good!!

Ham BBQ is the best! I'm originally from Western PA but now live in Ohio. I make it for big get togethers in a crock pot so it just stays hot and people can eat when they want to! Because of the high sugar content, you want to put it on warm or low after it's heated through.

We've been making ham barbeques like this for a long time! The only thing we do differently is sautee a some finely diced green pepper and onion in a little oil first, then proceed with the recipe. These are super simple and very tasty~YUM! :)

I was born and raised in Pittsburgh, and it has been so long since I've had a BBQ chipped ham sandwich. I cannot WAIT to get off work now! Thank you so much!

This was one of those recipes that had lots of positive reviews. So, I decided to trust the masses.....and they were wrong. If you're reading the recipe and you're thinking to your self, "Self, this does NOT sound good." Listen to yourself--you're smarter than you think.

Sweet, tangy, barbecuey goodness on a bun. I used mesquite smoked shaved ham (lunchmeat ham) and put this on an onion bun for a wonderful hot meal in minutes. Fast, simple, and delicious, what more could you ask? Thanks Princesscook!

Maybe you have to be from Pittsburgh to love these.  I also use Heinz ketsup, of course!   Delicious.

I halved the recipe and it was wonderful. Like others, I grew up on this sandwich filling. I made it for a quick dinner after a day of working outside. I served it on toasted potato roll, and a side of store bought coleslaw, chips and pickle strips. Everyone loved it.

This was really yummy! I had lots of leftover spiral ham and was looking for something different to do with it. I used the unsliced end of the ham, and cooked it in the crock pot all day. 
Thinking about using the leftovers for a home-made ham pizza.

just add thin sliced onion in the pot you make this in. Cook till soft.  I have been eating these for 68 years I'm 70. My Mom and grandmother made these and we don't live in Pittsburgh. So good with a small salad.
