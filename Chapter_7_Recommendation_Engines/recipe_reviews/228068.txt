Always remember when making beer chicken to place a small wad of foil or small red potato over neck so that the chicken steams & stays moist inside.  I'm not a beer fan.  I put 8 oz. of ckn broth in empty 16 oz beer can with spices of choice.  The taller can is a little more sturdy.  Less chance of tipping over!

Wonderful! Brined the chicken first overnight in fridge. I took your rub recipe and mixed with 1 and 1/2 sticks of room temp. real butter. Let that sit to instill seasonings. Put this mixture in between skin and chicken breast and then covered all of chicken.Put lemon and onion in chicken cavity. Also put hickory chips on in to smoke as it grilled. Used indirect grilling method. Put foil pan under chicken below grate to catch melted butter so it won't flame. Make sure lid is on to control temp. Flavorful and juicy!!

Very good rub!  I opened the beer and pored out about an ounce.   I personally set the grill to high for the first 10-15 mins to ensure crispy skin.  Then I turned down to 350 until it hits 160 degrees.  It came out tender and delicious!  The smoky paprika with the tinge of heat and sweet is great!  Remember to rest for 5 mins to redistribute the juices and your bird will come up to 165 degrees.  Perfect!

Don't cook it on medium, we TORCHED it...was the mistake putting the lid down? We googled how to do it because this recipe didn't clarify and all of them said to put the lid down. It was charcoal! Wish we could have enjoyed it :-(

This is our Go-To recipe for beer can chicken!!  Turns out great every time.  I put a pie pan under the chicken while it is on the BBQ to catch drippings and prevent over browning.

Made this  again last night -- fantastic as always!  I cleaned and rubbed the bird in the morning (only used about 1/2 of the rub), then put it in the fridge for 4-5 hours. 
When I lit the grill (set for med-high heat), I put the chicken on the can/stand (treated with cooking spray).  I applied leftover rub to any bare spots on the chicken, and stuck a wad of foil in the neck cavity.  
After preheating for 10-15 minutes, I put the chicken on the grill and left it on med-high (about 400-425F) for 5 minutes to crisp the skin, then turned down to medium-low (about 300-325F)  Took about 1-1/2 hours to cook this 5-lb bird to perfection.  
Leftover meat makes the best chicken salad evah!

I've made this recipe 3 times.  It's excellent.  I've also tried some of the other beer can chicken recipes on here but this one is the best.  Be careful to not put too much of the rub under the skin as it can overpower the flavor with too much spice, other than that, it's very easy. I use a meat thermometer and let it reach 165 with the indirect heat cooking method. Well done Clay!

Great recipe! Use the leftovers to make a pot pie, it’s delicious! Veggies, potatoes (cream of potato soup works too), chicken, pie crusts. Yum!

Simply amazing! I don’t use cumin or cayenne pepper and I reduce the paprika and slightly increase the rest - still the best! Definitely use an onion in the neck. I cook it in a beer can chicken wok thing and use the extra spice mix and some oil over some carrots, sugar snap peas and peppers and cook them in the wok for the last 15-20 minutes. Love it!

Unbelievably good! Nice kick to it. A little difficult on a charcoal grill, keep it cooking and watch the meat thermometer. It fell off the bones and was so moist. Looking forward forward to having friends over for it next time. Give it a try!

Good eatin'!  Just the right amount of spice if you like a little kick. Comes off the grill extremely moist. Never any leftover. I set it in a shallow pan on the grill for easy clean up.

Wow!!!!! This chicken is amazing! I made it two days ago and it was so simple! The rub is OUTSTANDING and agree with others who have rated this recipe - it is a great rub. I did use only 1 tsp of cayenne pepper as I didn't want it to overwhelm the other spices. It was perfect! The skin was crispy and the meat was juicy. Even my son, who is somewhat picky, said it was delicious. If you have left overs, try to get some of the rub on the inner parts of the breast by placing it against other pieces that still have skin on. I put all the little pieces together and smothered them in any remaining juices on the serving platter! Yummy!!!! Definitely a keeper for our family and a great dish if you're having guests!!!

Made it tonight and it was a hit.  I was thinking the spice mixture had too many ingredients in it, but I pretty much followed it and it was very good.  I ran into an issue using cheap briquettes, but was able to finish the bird off with a gas BBQ that is part of my outdoor cooking set-up.  I used Bud Light Lime beer, but I think just about anything would be good as the liquid steams up through the cavity.  I've used Dr. Pepper before and it was good as well, but I think its the rub that sets this off.  Whatever rub you choose, getting it under the skin (I used toothpicks to stitch the skin back together) and inside is key.  I let mine set after the rub  for about 1.5 hours before I set it on the grill.  I also used a digital remote thermometer and tracked it to 165 deg.  Pulled the bird out of the BBQ and let it set for 10 mins.  Spectactular!

I followed the recipe for the rub, but left out the cayenne since my family has a low heat tolerance. I rubbed the chicken down, covered it, and let it sit in the fridge while I was at work. Since I'm a novice homebrewer, and had a batch of Sunset Pale Ale ready, I used it as the beer, and shoved an onion in the neck. I placed it on a half cooking sheet, set it on the preheated grill, and cooked it for an hour and a half at 350 and it came out perfect. The skin was crispy, and the meat was moist and flavorful. I'd skip the microbrew next time though. I don't think the flavor of the beer added anything. Next time, like a previous reviewer suggested, I'll put a twig of rosemary in a light beer like Bud or Coors.

This recipe has made many people smile since I first started making it last summer.Excellent rub blend and you won't find a way to get a more moist bird.
The only change I ever make is to add a sprig of fresh rosemary to the beer can when I have some. But the recipe is delicious as written.

Thank you Clay for a great rub to step up Beer Can Chicken to the next level.  Very nice indeed.  I will admit to cheating though....I used 1/2 a can of Coors Light instead of Bud.  Sigh.... I know.. don't blame me, I don't buy beer and the last house guest that brought beer, brought Coors!  I usually end up using soda for these chickens so beer was a treat.  I will keep this rub in am  "rub" arsenal.  Good Stuff
