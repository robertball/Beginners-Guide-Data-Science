Very tasty recipe. A little temperamental though. Here are some tips to avoid frustration. 1) Your frosting mixture should be at a gentle simmer (or it may burn) so adjust the heat accordingly. I had to use med-low since med-high was bubbling way too furiously. 2) Melt and mix butter, cream, peanut butter, and vanilla first, then gradually mix in sugars. 3) Taste test as you add the sugars: I found 1 cup of each type to be plenty sweet, so I left out the 2nd cup of confectioners' sugar. 4) Keep gently simmering and stirring constantly (not frequently) until all sugar is dissolved. 5) Spread quickly and use the back of a spoon to pound it out if necessary. As stated in the recipe, quick spreading is important. As it cools (quickly) the PB oil makes the frosting not want to stick very well. It just wants to peel right off. Fortunately, my brownies were 95% covered by then with only a little unevenness, so I took the back of a spoon and pounded it even. It was my first time making this recipe and it came out awesome with the mentioned modifications. I gave it 4 stars because I really didn't change much, I just had to take a few unmentioned steps.

no need to buy heavy cream since milk or half & half works fine too.

I had my doubts when I read the recipe that this would be the fluffy frosting I was looking for.  After making it I was pleasantly surprised and loved it on the brownies that I had made and added peanut butter chips to.  I could almost eat just the frosting.  Love it!

I must have done something wrong - mine looked awful and wasn't really soft and creamy like I was hoping for.

I used this recipe and tweaked it just a bit ... I added more fresh cream with the powdered sugar to make it less fudge-y and more frosting-y!  :)  It came out just fine.  I also a full 1/4 cup of peanut butter because it needed a little more taste to balance the brown sugar.

Very good ! i also left out 1 cup of the confectioners' sugar, and it was plenty 
sweet, it was probably also easier to 
spread. It will burn quickly, be sure to
stir constantly !!  Be sure to sift powder
sugar.

Very good tasting, but beware, it is NOT pipeable if that is your  intention.  Sets up quickly and it is not easily spreadable.  Almost like peanut butter fudge.

This is great, I fixed it just like you said, allowing it only to come to a boil, first time to try this, it was wonderful. Thanks

Wow! I always thought this recipe was a family secret! Like my Mom made it up or something. You bet you eat the cake 1st and save the frosting 'til last! I can remember as a kid licking the beaters and scraping the bowl clean too!  Great recipe.

Not fluffy, too much like fudge.  My husband loves peanut butter icing on chocolate cake,  but he agrees it was not as good as most peanut butter frosting recipes.  It's OK for fudge

Peanut butter frosting is a fabulous and not too sweet recipe.  It was very easy to prepare, and very fluffy after beating for several minutes.  I made chocolate cupcakes with mini Reese's peanutbutter cups inside topped by this delicious icing.  This is a definite Do OVER!!

This frosting didn't come out fluffy at all for me. It was more of a glaze. A very tasty glaze. I started with my Cuisinart hand blender and rushed to get out the old 2 beater to try to fluff it up - to no avail. I did sift the powdered sugar beforehand as someone suggested. Overall, it tastes good and flowed over my brownies quickly and evenly. I made stripes of chocolate syrup and pulled a knife through to make it decorative. We'll see the husband thinks later. ;D

Tasted just like a funny bone!  Used less confectioners sugar, more peanut butter,  and drizzeled chocolate syrup and fluff on top!

Yummy!  It was a huge success for my daughter's birthday. Ours turned out more like a glaze.
