I've tried several basic buttercream frostings from this site and this is one of the best. I made half the recipe, which frosted a dozen cupcakes generously. I did modify it a bit, however - I used hi-ratio shortening, clear vanilla and one egg white to replace the 2 T. water in a half recipe. I find that hi-ratio shortening is best for frostings because it seems sturdier, creamier, and less greasy tasting. I beat the frosting on low speed (Speed 2 on the KitchenAid) for 10 minutes.  This frosting is excellent, particularly on the chocolate cupcakes I used it for. Fluffy, delicious, perfect for decorating if you like, and beautiful.

I tried this recipe today and I loved it!!!!  I made only 1/2 of the batch and it was enough for what I needed it for. FYI...1 pound of powdered sugar is about 3 1/2 cups. I added some food coloring for a festive touch and some sprinkles on top.

This is my "go to" recipe when decorating cakes. I like that it uses real butter and not just flavoring. This is usually enough to frost, fill and decorate up to a 12x18 cake. Any leftover freezes well. Next time you need some, let it thaw on the counter for 1/2 hour or so. You can rewhip it if you need to, but it doesnt usually need it.

I LOVE THIS FROSTING!!! It came out spectacular. Used only one tablespoon of water instead of two, also added just a little hint of pure orange extract. Try many extracts for variations. Used it to frost cookies, stayed soft enough to enjoy, but hardened just enough so it wasn't messy. I won't be using Duncan Hines to frost my cookies anymore! Also, I used an eclectic hand mixer and cut the recipe way way down, makes a ton!

I am one of those people who *calls* the corner piece of cake w/all the balloons/flowers (which means LOTS of frosting), so when I saw this recipe I knew I wanted to try it.  I finally made it this evening and it really is just like grocery store buttercream frosting.  I followed the recipe, though I didn't measure the 10X sugar.  I also added a little milk to the color I was using to frost the entire cake to make it a little more smooth (no milk necessary for the piping colors).  TY for a great recipe!  UPDATE:  I have to agree w/the other reviewer who stated it tasted different the next day on the cake; she's not nuts, it does!!

This is my absolute favorite frosting!  What ever flavor instead of vanilla, I use almond, peppermint, very versitile frosting!!  I use this recipe for all birthdays, fillings, even for our county fair.  I get great ravs using this recipe!  TY!! Update: after making this for years..my dd's tastes buds have changed-stating too sweet..so I modified switching out the water to whole milk-5 tbsp and modified directions to make it more professional since now taking cake orders-using my KA, beat on medium high butter and shortening.  Add little at a time, sugar and continue to beat and scrape down till adding one tbsp at a time alternating the sugar and milk and finally beating after fully incorporating, beat on high for about 15 minutes.  This definitely makes this more fluffier, creamier, less sweet, easier to pipe!  Still love this recipe!!

Very easy to make and hardened a bit when left in the air which was what I wanted.  If you are going to use food coloring in it, leave it very thick before adding coloring.  I used the gel coloring so it wouldn't be too watery but still found that by the time I'd added the food coloring, the icing wasn't quite thick enough to pipe nicely anymore.

This just takes a long time to beat, but
the more beating the better it is.  Makes
more than 2 cups when I made it.

Yuck. What did I do wrong? I didn't have 2 pounds conf sugar, so I reduced the whole recipe but half, then half again. I was only topping a small square cake so figured it would be enough. After beating forever it came out somewhat fluffy, but after sitting for a few mintues has turned to a coagulated runny messy. Doesn't look pretty and tastes like CRISCO. Dissapointing as I would throw it and use a differant recipe, but am out of conefections sugar. At least my 2 year old (who wanted to make it) is eating it... though my stomache is upset.

This was very good, but not quite like my local grocery store. I'm looking for something with a little less butter flavor. The cake cuts beautifully from the refrigerator, however and has a not too sweet flavor. My hubby loved it, so I will definately make it again! Thanks!

I used this for a craft at preschool and it was a big hit!!...I bought refrigerator sugar cookie dough and made them. While they cooked I made this frosting (half batch-full batch was too much). I separated the frosting into four equal parts and added a different food coloring to each and mixed thoroughly (when I did it for valentines Day I made the cookies in heart shapes with a cookie cutter, did pink, white and red frosting and added strawberry extract). I also had a variety of sprinkles. So when I brought all of this to class the kids got to decorate their own cookies with frosting and sprinkles. They loved it!...especially the eating part!!

I thought this recipe was easy and has an absolutely accurate name!  My husband loves grocery store cakes just because of their frosting-and was surprised to find I could make it at home! Thanks for this great frosting!

Well, I can't imagine coming any closer to grocery store bakery frosting than this.  It's my guilty pleasure -- store-bought "birthday" cake.  Has anyone here done a chocolate version with any luck?

I cut the recipe in 1/2 and it was more than enough to frost 40 sugar cookies.  I can't describe this little piece of heaven adequately, but let me just say that it's the best frosting I've ever made and it's just so easy.  The mix of shortening and butter is the key and the list of ingredients is absolutely perfect.  No extra anything needed.  I did tint mine with about 3 drops of red food coloring and made a perfectly soft pink fluff of cloud on top of my cookies.  I will make this anytime I need a good, light, fluffy frosting that holds its shape.  Thank you Sandra for this fantastic recipe.

This was great and very easy. Mine reached the right consistency after about 8 minutes. I used clear vanilla extract to keep the white frosting as white as possible. Thanks for a keeper!

Outstanding. It really should be called "Bakery Frosting" as it's not the greasy mess most grocery stores would sell anyway! Definitely a keeper. Don't forget the salt!

I have tried about 3 or 4 buttercream recipes and ths is now the one I will turn to. I think the shortening is definitely whats lacking in the other recipes. This is the consistency I have been searching for and the right amount of butter for the amount of powdered sugar to make sure it isn't bone tingling sweet. 5 stars well deserved. A must if you're piping!

Five Stars for Grocery Store Frosting! The name says it all, it tastes just like that greasy in-store bakery frosting. It takes three chugs of milk to get it off the back of your tongue. It was a breeze to whip up using my stand mixer. Love this frosting, super sweet and super slickery.

The best. I do not have a mixer so I did this by hand and it was Easy Easy Easy...used butter flavor shortening, unsalted butter, and eyeballed the confectioner's sugar. I scaled it to 4 servings to frost an 8x8 and 4 cupcakes (long story). Does NOT taste like powdered sugar, which is always my biggest complaint about homemade frosting...will be coming back to this one again and again! UPDATE: Made this again for my son's birthday cake, using unflavored shortening and adding liquid food coloring...and I still love it...but he didn't like it :( So, next year will have to try a different recipe out for him. But I will still use this one for me!

I LOOOVE this frosting. It tastes like frosting on a store bought cake, except not chemical-y and a little different. It as a perfect consistency, thick and rich-- one of the only icings I could actually eat from the bowl ((plain!)). I really like how if you refrigerate it in an airtight container for a day, becomes mm fondant-like. Definitely the best recipe I've made yet, thanks for the recipe! Easy to ice with, but a little difficult to write or make borders with with a pipette. I suggest adding more water if you want an easier time piping. Thanks again!! ~Bae

This frosting is excellent and reliable. For those who think it has too strong a butter flavour- make sure you either use unsalted butter, or omit the salt in the recipe if you are using salted butter. This really helps to retain the creamy consistency, but not the flavour, of the butter.

Loved it.  Made half a recipe, and it was enough to frost 12 cupcakes and about 30 mini cupcakes with some left over.  I used a bit more butter than called for in the half recipe, which was a good call.  Beat this for a good 12 minutes in my Kitchen Aid, and it was nice and fluffy/creamy.  Will use again.  Thanks!

I hate to give bad reviews as everything I have ever gotten off of this website has been excellent, with that being said, I will never make this recipe again.  Followed the directions exactly, not sure what happened.

I used this recipe as a base recipe, and made a few changes to it.  We like more of a buttery flavour, so I used 3/4 cup of both butter and shortening.  I also used less than the called for amounts of vanilla, and sugar.  What resulted was a nice frosting, just like the grocery store kind.  It was easy to work with and one that I'll use again.

I liked this a lot.  It tasted good, was easy to make, and is perfect for cupcakes and cakes.  The shortening is used in frostings for it to hold its shape at room temperature and to make it non-perishable and thus have no need to keep in the fridge. I halved the recipe (tip:  1 pound of confectioner sugar = ~3 cups) and still had extra frosting leftover after frosting 24 cupcakes.  I put the extra frosting into a spritz cooking maker and made "flowers" on top of each cupcake (I posted a photo if you want to see).  Top with red sprinkles and a silver ball sprinkle, and your result is quite presentable.  Easy, basic frosting.

Fantastic frosting!  I am a frosting gal - the real thing, not the whippy dippy kind.  This recipe fit the bill - perfectly!  I have made this recipe a couple of times, and the beauty of it is that it freezes really well.  I just thaw over night and give it a stir and it has the same consistency as the day I made it.  That is a huge time saver for me.  I just make a double batch and freeze the leftovers.  A frosting recipe that I will be using again and again.

Very good...I use 1-1/2 cups shortening and no butter and clear vanilla to make the frosting pure white. Also, it helps to mix an additional 2 minutes on low at the end to reduce air bubbles and make the frosting smoother.

Excellent!!! I'm a die hard 'Butter Cream Frosting II' fan, but wanted to try a bit fluffier frosting this time around. This frosting is terrific - tastes great and is wonderful to work with. If left in the air the frosting dries hard on the outside but is super soft and fluffy inside. That's perfect in my opinion! Thanks :)

Tryed this recipe with my 12 and 9 year old daughters and it didn't come out well. The only flavor we tasted was shortining. We even added more sugar and vanilla but it was still not good. We will never do this recipe again.

Amazing! It really does taste like grocery store bakery frosting -- a cloud-like consistency and a very clean, not-too-buttery flavor. I consider myself an icing connoisseur, and this will be topping my cakes for a long time. 

I made about 1/4 of the recipe (5 servings in the calculator), and it was just enough for 6 delicious cupcakes.

Yum! Whipped up a batch of this frosting for my husband's Bday cake (he LOOOOVES chocolate cake with plain vanilla frosting). I debated on whether or not to just make vanilla-chocolate powdered sugar frosting (Anonymous) again, but since I wasn't blown away the first time I made it, I decided to try Sandy's frosting recipe instead. I'm really glad I did. :) This tastes just like my local grocer's butercream frosting (I buy cupcakes just for that reason!!!)! One note: THIS MAKES A TON! I had enough to frost a double-layer cake with AND enough left after that to fill half a gallon-size freezer bag. I'm going to freeze my leftover frosting so that when the craving strikes, I have something to frost a cake or cupcakes with. Thanks Sandra! :-)

I consider myself a grocery store frosting expert. This is extremely close to what you'd get on a cake from a grocery store. It refrigerates/freezes well. Pay no attention to how much Crisco is used - just enjoy.

I love, love, love the frosting that comes on the cakes at the grocery store. I know some say it's "too sweet" but, for me, there's no such thing! :) This frosting is SO GOOD! I made it just as the recipe states and it was more than enough to frost 24 cupcakes, plus a bit left for us all to lick off our spoons :) Will make again and again!

YUM! Great frosting! excellent flavor and texture!  I think the only thing missing that might put it over the top and truly give it that "grocery store" flavor would be a pinch of almond extract and I plan on trying that next time.  Can't wait to use this recipe on my Xmas cookies this year! Thanks!

I am a frosting person. Finding this recipe excited me. . . I am so sick of butter cream! I've used it twice now. The main thing that I learned the first time: CUT DOWN ON THE VANILLA. Also, it tastes better the next day. Overall, I'm pretty happy with it. It was fantastic on sugar cookies.

Great recipe, my boyfriend is always saying how our food store doesnt make the sugar frosting...after i made this, he had bowls of it LOL...but i was able to scoop some from him to make this pretty cake..I gave it a 4 because it is a little to sugary for my taste, but it is very good. Also tastes amazing if you dip strawberries in it.

I wish I could give this recipe more than only 5 stars!  This is exactly the recipe I have been looking for.  My husband likes heavy super sweet frosting, but I like a fluffy, not so sweet frosting.  This frosting fits sooo perfectly in the middle, we all loved it.  It's also great that there is no perishables in it, so it doesn't have to be refrigerated.  This recipe also reduces by half very nicely.Thank you so much for a perfect recipe.

Easy and delicious!  I used butter flavored Crisco, salted butter, home made vanilla extract and skipped the salt,  I upped the extract to replace the water.  I didn't mix for 15 minutes - my KA whipped it up in about half of that.  Will make again.

The 2 lbs of sugar was WAY to much.  1.5 c of powdered sugar worked for me.  But I'm using Spectrum Organic All Vegetable shortening instead of lard, so I'm not sure if that made a difference or not.

I made this icing for my sister's birthday cake. She has always preferred the frosting that is used in grocery store bakeries, even though most people detest it. I decided to skip the vanilla, and it still turned out great! It wasn't quite the same as in the grocery stores, but it was good enough. Will use this recipe again! :D

Yummo!  This iced my cake beautifully and was delicious.  I added almond extract, because it's fab, and was very pleased.  Thank you Sandra for this recipe and the extra 5 pounds I'll gain tonight eating the leftovers.

It tasted good, it didn't taste exactly like my grocery store icing... I love that stuff.  I would make it again, just wasn't right on for me.  Make sure you take the time to beat it for 15 min.  I had to add a little more water to get it to spread out, could have been the humidity factor.

I have used this recipe before. It's the one I automatically go to when I need to make my own frosting!  I follow it exactly as it is written and it turns out perfect for me!  I always have to lick the bowl. Nothing better than some good ol' lard icing!!

Awesome recipe.  Our family needs to be very conscious of trans fats (OK saturated fat too but they're at least not as bad), so I tried making it with all butter and it still worked well.  I did have to occasionally throw the bag back in the fridge when it became difficult to work with.  If you aren't trying to do any piping, using butter probably won't affect the handling.  It will still harden a bit if left out at room temp once on the finished product.

Very tasty frosting.  Good consistency and flavor.  Made exactly as directed.  Not too sweet and hardened just right for frosted cookies.

this was okay.  I figured out that a pound of powdered sugar is about 3 1/2 cups.  Which tasted a little too sweet.  I just made half a recipe & easily frosted 24 cupcakes.  I might use this again if i need frosting for kids cakes.  I liked how it held up to temp changes, didn't melt like canned frostings.

I swear, just give me this and I don't need cookies or a cake!  We loved it!  I did half it to frost a 9 by 13 inch cake and had a bit left over to put in between some chocolate chip cookies.  I added just a bit of almond extract too.  Perfect!

I've made this frosting twice. Both times I cut the recipe in half. Half is plenty for frosting an 8 or 9-inch 2-layer round cake.

The first time, I followed the recipe exactly -- except I needed to add more water to make a nice spreading consistency. It was nice & fluffy, but seemed to lack some flavor.

The second time I made it, I used half vanilla & half butter flavoring, and I used heavy cream in place of the first 2-tablespoons of water. Again, I had to add more water then the recipe called for to obtain a nice spreading consistency. Without the water, it would have been good for piping -- but not for spreading. With the butter flavoring added, the flavor was awesome. This is definitely a keeper. 

If you bake cakes frequently, you can make a full batch, use half now and then freeze/refrigerate the leftovers for later use. Just bring it to room temperature & beat well.

Happy cooking!

I really, really liked this frosting.  It was really easy to make and it turned out great.  I added more shortening because I thought it was rather sweet at first, but I'm not sure how much shortening I added [sorry], cause I just kept adding it until it wasn't super sweet anymore.

I tried this recipe for a white cake with strawberry jelly filling for Valentine's Day. The first two bites I thought wow, finally found the right icing. By the end of the slice of cake I had I felt like I had eaten 2 pound of shortening. My lips and mouth felt like it was coated in grease. I used Crisco vegetable shortening for the shortening, and still feel like I ingested a ton of fat

Yes I am one of those people that loves the corner end of the bakery store cake. Made exactly do not just use only butter if you want the right taste and texture. If you are afraid of crisco move on. Made with salted butter and also made the day before it does taste different and better as others have noted the day after making.

Sandra, Great frosting, my daughter is getting married and she can not have milk products.
I'm using your receipt for her wedding cake.
It is so easy to make and to work with and freezes well.
I have made lots of example wedding cakes before the real deal, and everyone loves it.

This was the best frosting EVER. I will forever use this sweet but not too sweet frosting. The 15 min. of mixing makes it so light. I piped on cupcakes and frosted another rect. cake and it was cooperative. And lasted because the frosting hardens but stays so soft and creamy on the inside. Amazing.

Fantastic!  I was afraid to beat the entire 15 minutes (and with 5 grandkids screaming to decorate cupcakes any excuse to hush them up would do) so I only beat for about 6 minutes.  Mine came up beautifully without (as others have mentioned) any overt powdered sugary or greasy shortening taste.  She was a little stiff, but I'm sure with the full mixing that glitch would be eliminated.  New go-to recipe.  Thanks so much!

Love it! 
I followed the recipe as written though I added more vanilla and substituted the water with cream (to make it fluffier and taste less like straight sugar). Yes, you do need two pounds of powdered sugar. 
The recipe makes a stiff frosting that you could probably use for decorations like frosting roses,  but add more cream for a lighter fluffier frosting (1/2 cup).

Very good frosting!  I was looking for something similar to Walmart's frosting.  This was light, fluffy, and pretty darn good, but it wasn't exactly what I was looking for.  I will make again, though, but I will use half as much vanilla and I'll be careful not to add the full 2 pounds of sugar.  The texture was great.  It's perfect for writing letters and piping borders.  It held its shape without hardening.  It's not stiff enough for roses and other intricate work.

This was the best recipe I have made.  I doubled the vanilla and did not need more water. I scooped it into a freezer bag, cut of the tip and piped it onto my cupcakes. Sprinkle pink sugar and tada, RAVE REVIEWS!

Loved this frosting!  I love baked goods from the grocery store b/c the frosting is so good!  This stuff tastes just like it :)

It was very easy to make.  I made 12 cupcakes- I think I used about 1/2 and I put the rest in the freezer, relying on assurances by other reviewers that it freezes well.  

Thanks for this awesome recipe!

This is the BEST, I mean the VERY BEST frosting recipe I have ever attempted! It was quick and easy (no boiling stuff) and it tasted AWESOME!!!! I'm already thinking of a million different ways to use it (maybe some peanut butter added to make a chocolate peanut butter cake, mmmmm). Yummy yummy yum!!!!! Try it you will not be disapointed!

Excellent frosting!This is just what I was looking for to decorate a batch of cupcakes for a special birthday. Nice and fluffy, perfect texture and consistency. I used milk instead of water and had to add a couple extra TBSP to get it perfect for piping on cupcakes. I also used half vanilla and half almond extract for a bit of extra flavour.

This is awesome frosting.  It is just like the kind on the store bought cakes.
It takes color well and is great for decorating.

Pretty good, but not as good as the grocery store. Needs more butter maybe? Also, I swear the taste changed from when I made it and frosted my cake to the next day when I served it...strange.

This is gorgeous...I scaled it down to 4 servings and it did 12 cupcakes. If you're making a small cake or cupcakes best you cut the recipe down to half or quarter, it does make a lot. I added peanut butter to this recipe as I was using it on peanut butter cupcakes. This is the recipe I was looking for and have already emailed it to family members who want it as  well....Many thanks to the original poster...

I had such high hopes and this did not even come close to expectations. Even my 7 year old who LOVES frosting scraped it off the top of her cupcake. Very disappointing.

Unbelieveable good!  Holy Cow!!!!  I was in a cake decorating class before and thought that frosting was good.  This beats it hands down.  Highly recommend.  Now, I have to keep the ingredients on hand to make this often.  Thanks for sharing!

I really like the way this turned out !!!  I used 1 t. of  almond instead of vanilla.  Everbody will enjoy my "NEW" frosting !!! I plan on using it on sugar cookies, chocolate cup cakes, cinniamon rolls,......just everything !!!
I just made it again !!  Used vanilla this time & liked it even more !!!  My Father & Husband DON'T 
like to sweet OR greasy frostings...This passed there requirements and gave the thumbs up !!!!

"tastes like the middle of an oreo". If you're looking for bakery/grocery store frosting, this is it. I made a few subs (skim milk instead of water, bit more salt) but otherwise followed exactly. I will use this over and over. Fresh shortening is vital here.  Thank you!

I made this last night :/ my boyfriend really loves the taste of grocery store frosting so I thought I'd give it a go- but honestly neither of us though it tasted anywhere close to grocery store frosting! I'll stick to my go-to buttercream frosting from now on... Which I thought was a little too sweet until I tried this : p I really think it was much too sweet, I could only take two bites of the cake I had worked all night on : (  I'm disappointed, because of how many good reviews I see, I has high expectations for this!

It gets five stars because it is exactly what it says it is and was just what I was looking for, something that would be similar to what I could get in a can at the store, and with ingredients I would have on hand. It does indeed stay soft underneath and firms up on top. And, yes, it makes a lot. I frosted two (rather tall 8" cakes) and could probably have done a third (I used the rest for all my fun little projects with cake scraps. and mini bread tins...)  Enjoy!

I tried this recipe and it was awesome, very similar to the grocery store frosting .  The only thing I suggest is to use a mixer with strong mixers and you do have to add a few tablespoons of water to get it to the right consistency on top of mixing it for 15 minutes.  I have allready made two cakes using this frosting and everyone loved it!!!

I made this last night to frost sugar cookies. My son always says he doesn't like frosting on his cookies because it's just too sweet so I've been on hunt for a recipe he would like. Ding, ding, ding we have a winner. I have to make another batch of cookies now because he liked it so much! Thanks for posting this great recipe.

Great!!!!!!!!!!! Made it for the first time, for a wedding cake. It taste great and was easy to spread. At the reception my nieces came up to me and told me how much they enjoyed the homemade cake, and how wonderful the frosting taste. I was told it taste better than any grocery store frosting because it wasn't too sweet. This recipe will be used a lot (especially with the holidays coming).

good - I will make this again. It makes quite a bit so it's better than buying a lot of those little tubs at the store.  It's a good consistency for cake decorating.

I made this frosting to a T and it was soo sweet! Not a bad frosting, but not my favorite. But, I maybe stuck on store bought frosting. Any suggestions on how to lessen the sweetness? I did love the texture and how great it was for piping! Easy to color and make. Just too sweet for me!

Don't tell my Nonna this, but your frosting is the best I have ever had.  I made it last night for my hubby's welcome home cake and everyone fell in love with the taste.  It made enough to generously frost two 9x13in sheet cakes.  I used butter flavored shortening.  Next time I will use clear vanilla extract to keep the frosting a whiter color.  Mine came out ivory.

This was good frosting BUT it took about 23 minutes to get it to the right consistency and mixed well.  And I would NEVER try this with a cheap mixer.

I've been wanting to try this recipe for a long time. I thought that it was perfect. My husband (a true butter(only)cream enthusist)wasn't as impressed. It was very sugary- but isn't that the purpose of frosting? I did need to thin it a little. I will go back to a butter-only frosting to get a better rating with my butter-loving husband, but I thought this was a great recipe.

I didn't think this tasted like the grocery store frosting at all.  It tasted okay, but I could really taste the vanilla too much.  I triple checked the amount, but I followed the recipe exact and it seemed to be too much vanilla.    One lesson I learned this time was not to frost the cake the day before and wrap it up.  Not as a fault to the recipe, but the next day when I unwrapped it, the nice blue guitar was covered in white dots.  I believe some moisture got trapped in there.  Lesson learned!

Oh how I wanted this recipe to be "the one". I made this frosting exactly as the recipe says, but it is not what I wanted. It's a little greasy for my taste. I want the famous "great american cookie" frosting that you can get in the mall...Now that's a great frosting.

Used this frosting to decorate a pumpkin cake and I really liked it. Easy to make and takes colors very nice.  Next time I will mix it the full time and see if that makes a difference.  Very good and I will use this recipe often to decorate cakes, cookies, etc.

I did a half-batch and it was pretty good. I used ½ cup shortening, 1/4 cup butter, about 1 tsp pure lemon extract, about 3 cups of confectioners' sugar (the two-pound bag I have says that two pounds equals approximately 7½ cups, but my frosting was plenty sweet even cutting out 3/4 cup!), a couple good shakes of salt, and I'd say about 3 or 4 TBS water. I kept having to add water because it was too thick! Be warned: Use a BIG bowl. I used the large bowl for my Sunbeam Mixmaster and I still had frosting bits flying all over the kitchen! Oh, well. I did use a little food coloring with no problems at all. I only beat it around 10 minutes, and I ended up with around 2 cups of frosting for the half-batch. My daughter loves it, but my husband will be the true tester! I'll add to my review after he's tried it...

Loved this! Was as good as store bought. I had to add more water than the recipe called for and was nervous at first about it but as the recipe called for, it would barely spread. I mixed for the full amount of time and added food coloring for a cake. Will make this again!

This was a very good icing recipe, I have used it a few times. I absolutely love bakery icing, I have tried many different recipes, and this one is the best one I have found yet. Not exactly like the real thing-but very close. Make sure to mix it the full time, this really helps.

WONDERFUL!!!  This is so light and fluffy.  I used my Kitchen Aid stand mixer which made it easy to beat the full 15 min.  What a difference!!  My husband was craving coconut so I added a  1/2 c. cocnut and it turned out wonderful.  I did add a little less vanilla (I used Mexican vanilla which is strong.)and added just a little more water after adding the coconut.  Thanks!  This is a wonderful frosting!!

I'm making my 3 year old's birthday cake this year, and using this frosting. I did a test run last weekend, final product tomorrow. I think this tastes great, but was a little gritty. Maybe I will cut down the sugar by 1/4 to 1/2 a cup. Also, it broke down a little when I added food coloring, and am not sure how it will pipe, as I made it a bit too thin. It still had the heavy frosting texture, but was not thick enough for piping I don't think. I'll post more after I finish the cake and frosting over the weekend. Good tasting frosting, though. Simple to make!

I made this exactly as the directions said. The consistency was great but all I could taste was powdered sugar. Don’t get me wrong, it tastes good, but it definitely does not taste like what comes from a grocery store bakery.. or any other bakery I’ve been to for that matter.

Perfect!! I used milk and followed the directions exactly! It may take a tad more milk than 4 tablespoons to make it spread better and to add a little more flavor, add almond flavor as 
Well as vanilla.

Absolutely awesome! I followed the recipe to the letter.  I am not a baker.  I am a home cook who got a wild hair to bake something sweet for my husband.  Cupcakes are his favorite.  I found a basic recipe online for the cupcakes and stumbled upon this for the icing. I am not a fan of the whipped kind of icing.  I have always preferred the store bought lard type that's so sweet you cannot hardly stand a second piece of cake.  I have also not made icing from scratch but maybe twice in my life.  I was disappointed both times and did not have much hope for this one. THIS was perfection.  It is sweet, but not cloyingly so.  It is substantial, not whipped sweetness, but a spreadable thicker confection.  It was amazingly simple also, though messy even in my Kitchenaid stand mixer as it splattered a bit as it mixed.  I did add the optional 2 extra tablespoons of water, though I am not sure I needed it. Since I am inexperienced I was not certain what I was looking for in a finished product, so I left it to mix on high for the full 15 minutes.  I thought I would try piping it onto my cupcakes and tried to use a simple ziplock method with a clipped end for piping, but it was evident I didn't know what I was doing.  It looked embarrassingly messy and decided to smear it on instead.  Still tastes amazing!  And I will say when I squirted the remained of my icing from my failed piping ziplock it squirted very nicely back into the bowl.

Just finished a cake with this frosting. Instead of water I used half and half and I alternately beat in the sugar and half and half, then beat on high for ten minutes. My colors aren't extremely prominent but I didn't want to ruin the consistency with the gel coloring. It frosted easily and piped well too. It's just slightly greasy but the flavor is pretty good.

recipe did not specify if butter needed to be soft/room temperature, cold, or liquid so i ran into a little trouble that i fixed by putting my mixing bowl in a double boiler while stirring for a minute. (butter needs to be VERY soft or possibly liquid, it seems) my biggest problem with this is that the frosting just isn't white, it's more of a beige. I'm not sure if that's my fault for using real vanilla or what, but I feel like this isn't the recipe I've truly been searching for after all. it still tasted pretty accurate but something's missing.

Very close to the store bakery taste. Made this for a friend who is addicted to this frosting who cannot get it because he lives in Europe. Gave him the extra frosting and he was in heaven.

I made this and I found it to be very fluffy and easy to spread. 
However it is too sweet. I found that it really did not taste like store bakery frosting. To me it just tasted like creamy confectioners sugar. I won't be making this again. I will continue to search for a better frosting.

Perfect!! I've always made and eaten true "buttercream" frosting, made entirely with butter. Honestly, I'm a sucker for grocery store cakes and icing - this tastes just like it! I followed the recipe exactly as it is. Way fluffier/lighter/lighter tasting than butter-buttercream. Additionally, it held up perfectly without refrigeration for several hours. I will ALWAYS use this recipe from now on!

This is EXACTLY what I was looking for! I've never been able to find a recipe for that sugary, not really buttery icing that all grocery store cakes seem to have, but this is it. I didn't make any changes but I added food coloring and it came out great. Thanks!

I've made dozens of recipes from this site, but have never bothered to rate one. I HAD to make an exception for this recipe. As simple as it is, it really saved me. I have tried too many failed icing/frosting recipes. This recipe is now the only one I will EVER use. Thank you so much. It truly does taste like  bakery quality icing.

I've been searching for an icing that tastes like the bakery ones and this is it! The key is shortening and I used vanilla bean paste, so good! Don't trust the other recipes that use butter only, it just tastes oily and like butter. My go to icing from now on.

I made a 2-layer 9-inch chocolate cake and you need to make the full recipe to coat the entire cake.  I used Crisco and I did not feel the consistency was greasy.  I thought the flavor was great.  **Update** I loved the way this tasted with my cake.  Great recipe.

It does not taste like bakery or grocery store icing.  I may ice the cake with Duncan Hines and use this for decorating.  It does hold its shape well.

OMG, eating this as I type and it tastes very much like grocery store frosting. So delicious, the more you blend (on high speed) the lighter and fluffier it gets! I only made 1/2 of the recipe and I used about 3 1/2 cups confectioners sugar (unsifted) and omited the water and used 4 tb heavy cream instead ^-^ Thank you for the recipe Sandra :D Will be making again :)

Not what I was wanting at all. This was your typical sugary icing that gets hard when left out. Maybe this is what American grocery store icing is like, but not Canadian. Ours is much lighter tasting and is firm without hardening. I'll keep looking.

The best and only recipe I will be using ever again!! I use it with the sugar cookie recipe "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" and it was a hit!!! Both recipes yield high batches but I kept having to make more! Everyone loved them and I even gave them as gifts, so I am very excited to use both recipes again for Valentines day! Highly recommended. I added tiny bits of water through out the frosting of the cookies to keep the frosting glossy and moist. Easy to work with!!!

I used this for my niece's Avril Lavigne inspired cake. It was easily dyed using gel dye from Michael's to a nice hot pink. The only thing I must say is it is VERY sugary.....VERY. One little girl ate all the frosting off of her piece and got a stomach ache! I guess I'll just warn everyone that this is the real deal...do NOT make it if you don't want REALLY sugary frosting. I loved it!

Frosting was great - and really simple to make. It made a lot too! I got a lot of compliments on this frosting. I used almond extract instead of vanilla. I do notice that after being out a litte bit, it does get a little hard on the edges. I'm sure I could prevent that by using more butter and less shortning. Yum.

I added some cocoa to this and it was still too sweet and hard to work with.

This frosting tastes GREAT!! I used this frosting to decorate a giant chocolate chip cookie pizza, it piped really nicely! I tweaked it a little though. I added a little bit of half and half to smooth it out a little better, as well as a tsp of orange extract. (it adds just a very subtle orange flavor) Just experiment with different extracts!

Nice...a little sweet though, but I guess that's expected.

This was pretty good frosting, but I don't think it tasted JUST like the grocery store's. I'm deadset on finding that right flavor though, so I was being really picky. There's nothing wrong with this recipe though...it's nice and fluffy and sticks to cookies quite well. I didn't end up beating it for the entire 15 minutes. I stopped at about 6 or 7 and figured it was good enough.
