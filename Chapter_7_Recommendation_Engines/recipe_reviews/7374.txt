I honestly can't believe more people haven't tried this recipe. It is probably one of the best chocolate fudge cakes I've ever baked. (and I've baked quite a few!). I changed the recipe to 9 servings and this was actually just over what I needed. I baked an 8inch layer cake and still had mix left over! I used low fat margarine instead of butter to make it a little less sinful. I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon to add a little spice. Just before I put the tins in the oven I dropped a handful of roughly chopped dark and white chocolate chunks into the top of the mix. These added some nice surprises in the middle of the cakes. I baked it for 25-30 minutes and the result was so perfect. It was intensely moist and rich and chocolatey but it was also light to the bite unlike a lot of heavy chocolate cakes. I filled the layer cake with my Raspberry Layer Cake Filling and frosted the tops and sides with the Brown Sugar Cream Cheese Frosting and Chocolate Cream Cheese Frosting. I added fresh raspberries to the top and chocolate shavings. I will be making this cake time and time again. It is now my no1 chocolate cake recipe! The only thing I can think that is putting people off with giving this recipe a go is the lack of detailed instructions but if you've baked a cake or two before it is easy to work out the details. For example make sure you grease and flour your tins before you put the mixture in;) I urge everyone to give this recipe a go!!

I would've given this 5 stars if I had not needed to change the recipe a tad. I put in 3/4 cup of chocolate because it definitely needed more. I also used buttermilk instead of souring the milk with lemon juice. I went ahead and used the chocolate cream cheese icing and brown sugar cream cheese icing that another member suggested. Also as a semi-beginner cook I didn't realize that I should've put the batter into two round pans as there was just too much batter in one to cook in that amount of time and it caved in a tad in the middle. The taste was AMAZING though so it still deserves at least 4 stars.

I scaled this for 9 servings and baked it in an 8x8 pan. It came out fine taking about 30 minutes to bake. I like this cake very much it is moist and chocolatey but not overly rich. I also made the full recipe in two 9-inch layers and frosted with Fudge Buttercream Icing and it was a seriously satisfying chocolate "fix". Had to bring the cake to the office or I'd eat it all myself!

OHHHH WOW! This was soo good! This is going to be my favorite chocolate cake recipe! I used buttermilk instead of the milk and lemon and because I love chocolate so much I used 3/4 of a cup of cocoa. I also added about 3tbs of instant coffee granules. I put it into two 9" pans thinking I might freeze one but it was so good there was no way I would freeze it- our family would have eaten every last bite- so I gave one away. I hope they enjoy it as much as we did!! I iced it with a dark chocolate frosting.

This cake was okay. It lacked chocolate flavor and wasn't very moist but still it wasn't a bad cake. I wasn't all that disappointed when my two-year-old pulled the cake plate off the counter and sent it crashing to the floor though.

We loved it. Don't know why some people didn't like it or how come it came out dry for them not all ovens bake evenly and mine is a very difficult oven yet this cake didn't burn baked perfectly and had a fudge cake texture. I baked in two round pans which I had buttered and floured and we're making again this weekend for our birthday party. It was also really nice to come across a recipe for a chocolate cake (with eggs I tried eggless ones too which were really nice on this site) not made with actual chocolate and NOT from a PACKAGED MIX! Thanks a bunch for the recipe!! I might have to try those as cup cakes (adjusting cooking time of course) as I think they'd be FANTASTIC! Update 10 Oct 08: Made them as cupcakes and they turned out amazingly well! Had to adjust cooking time but they were a HUGE success piped some Decorator Frosting from this site http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Decorator-Frosting/ and they were easily transported to the party venue the icing didn't stick to the plastic wrap at all. I'm one happy camper!

This cake was really surprising! I followed it pretty much to the T and it came out very bland and did not have that chocolate flavor. I think you should add less sugar and A LOT more chocolate. powder. I do not think I will be making this cake again.

My youngest daughter's partner will only eat chocolate cake so I made this mainly for him. I baked in 2 9" rounds and sandwiched with chocolate buttercream. My only slight complaint is that this dried out on the edges a little trying to get the centre done. That aside this was devoured in no time. Thanks for sharing your recipe Kristen.

This wasn't all that fudgey or rich. It was a good regular chocolate cake but doesn't qualify as a fudge cake in my books. Other than that there's nothing wrong with the recipe but I will personally stick with Dark Chocolate Cake IV from this site.

Had a really nice soft dense texture--not like any cake I've ever baked. Tasted only "okay" though. I'm still looking for a cake where the chocolate really comes through. I would make this again based on the texture alone.

I was worried abt trying this cake due to all the not so good reviews. I am soo glad I tried it anyway! It is so easy to make and the texture is perfect. I agree that it is not that fudgey or chocolatey hence the four starts but with a nice chocolate buttercream frosting it would be absolutely perfect! I mixed everything by hand and used evaporated milk instead of regular and halved the recipe which I baked in an 8X8 pyrex pan. Other than that followed exactly but had to bake longer. Delicious not dry at all and also not too moist either. I would add a bit more cocoa next time just to make it darker or just use dutch processed cocoa which is naturally darker. I may also add some chocolate chips to the batter next time. Thanks so much for this recipe really good.

This cake is awesome! I made it adding 1 tsp. cinnamon and chopped dark and white chocolate as suggested by one of the reviewers. I frosted the middle and sides with Light and Creamy Brown Sugar and Chocolate Frosting and the top with Brown Sugar Cream Cheese Frosting from this site. Loved it!

I just made this today and decided to make it sugar free. I used Splenda in place of the sugar. Added extra coca like suggested and this is VERY good. I used the sugar free frosting from this site and it made a very good cake. It is dense but very flavorful.

Just finished baking the cake. I think it's really fudgy. So dense and smooth texture. Unbelievably smooth. Not fluffy or airy at all. Taste ok when it's just baked. Don't know for tomorrow or after refrigerated. I hope it gets tastier. I did all with low speed mixer from beginning to the end. Good recipe though just need a little taste fixing.

This was absolutely gorgeous! Tasted just like a chocolate fudge cake should; moist chocolatey but not too heavy either. I don't understand how anyone doesn't like it because it's too dry! I made a round 9" cake with the 18 serving recipe and it was perfect!

I absolutely love the texture of this cake- if you're a fan of dense moist cakes this recipe is for you! The only problem I had with it is I didn't find it chocolatey enough. I would suggest adding some mini chocolate chips to the batter using more cocoa powder and/or replacing some of the cocoa with melted chocolate.

This cake is my new favorite chocolate cake recipe! I will make this again and again. I didn't have the lemon juice so I just left it out and it turned out wonderfully. The cake is heavy but not too heavy. I baked it in a 9x13 greased pan for 28 minutes and then iced it with chocolate cream cheese icing. Perfection!

I added 2 tbsp of instant espresso powder increased the unsweetened cocoa powder to 3/4 cups and used unsweetened dark cocoa powder instead of regular. Adding instant espresso powder to chocolate baked goods always makes them richer and taste more like hot fudge. What many people don't know is that restaurants will add hot coffee to hot fudge that is becoming too thick.

It was a big hit but I thought it could have used a bit more chocolate. I increased the coco powder to 3/4 C as suggested but maybe I'll increase it to 1 C next time. It was still a yummy cake. I used homemade raspberry jelly (heated in microwave for easier spreading) and cheesecake pudding between the layers. Covered it with chocolate cream cheese frosting from this site and chopped up candied pecans.

I followed the ingredients carefully and the cake turned out thick & tough with a odd taste. You couldn't taste the chocolate. Not my kind of cake maybe. My son liked it but I didn't. I like fudge and brownie type desserts so I thought I would like this but the taste and texture was all wrong. I won't make this again.

Simple recipe and easy to follow I felt like a pro after making this cake. It was my first cake baked from scratch and I felt so proud and accomplished.

great recipe. very easy to make and cake comes out very moist which I didn't expect. we split the cake into two and used fresh straberries to make kind of jam or spread and added it in the middle. yummy!!!!!! thanks for a great recipe.

Yep I agree with the other reviewers this is the best chocolate cake Ive ever made. Simple batter moist rich fluffy cake. Great with chocolate buttercream frosting.
