I just finished making this recipe and it was teriffic!!! My entire family loved it.  I know for future uses, I can add whatever vegetables I want and because I used frozen pea pods, I don't doubt that if I'm out of fresh veggies, frozen will be a fine substitute!! Thank you thank you! I have been looking for a good stir fry receipe for ages!! (PS-My 5 year old loved it! What better way to get them to eat their veggies!!)

This was a really good and quick stir fry recipe. I used water instead of cooking wine or juice and frozen stir fry veg. The sauce was wonderful but didn't make enough. I am going to make extra sauce next time so that I will have extra for my rice. This is a definite must try. Will cook many more times.

This was a very easy recipe to follow.  I omited the wine, used only 4 TBSP of soy sauce
 and just used some veggies I had on hand.  The sauce makes a great flavor but next time I'll use a little more 
water.

Doubled the sauce so there was enough for the rice.  Used fresh asparagus, carrots, water chestnuts, baby corn, and sliced sirloin.  Husband and kids loved it!  Will definitely make again.

I doubled the sauce, as suggested by some others, and used water.  It came out very, very salty.  I will make this again, but will use less soy sauce and maybe try apple juice or wine.

It was a simple recipe, I doubled the sauce portion all but the soy sauce and it turned out great, I used half apple cider and half water. I increaded the recipe to serve 6 and it was too much food, four would have worked fine for our family of 6.

The recipe was a great guide.  I like to add and subtract of course, so I used a combination of cream sherry and apple juice in the sauce (1/2 cup of each), and instead of snow peas I used bean sprouts.  Seeing I was fresh out of beef - I used venison instead and it was wonderful.  Also when it was nearly done I add more soy sauce to taste.

Yummy, but with some changes.  I had no pea pods and forgot to add the broccoli, but instead I added celery and threw in some Shitake mushrooms while cooking the meat, which gave the dish unbelievable added flavor. Also, I added plenty of ground ginger, ground mustard, garlic, dash of red pepper, green onions and some sesame oil.  With all of my additions my family found this dish to be great!

This was great! I used low sodium soy sauce as well.  I also used apple juice.  Wonderful flavor.  To add a little spice put in some Cayenne pepper! (About four dashes)

My family enjoyed this recipe. Since my son and daughter are 3 and 1 respectively, I saved time by using store bought frozen "stir-fry" veggies. I only used 4 Tsp of soy sauce as well. It tasted great for lunch the next day, too.

This recipe is very good. Can also use chicken or beef bouillon granules and water instead of wine or just plain water but be sure to use low-sodium soy sauce because of all the salt in the bouillon. Will be making this again.

Very quick and easy. Probably would have been better if I hadn't used cooking wine, but it was still good.

I followed the recipe exactly (used apple juice) and I thought it was pretty good. I might double the sauce next time just because I like lots of sauce for my rice. I used top round steak. I was cooking just for me and it made a lot, but I am happy to have leftovers for lunch and another supper.

I thought that this recipe was pretty good.  I did make a few changes though.  I doubled the soy sauce and sugar mixture, kept the 2 tbsps of cornstarch, added 1/2 tsp of ginger and garlic powder, and added about 1 cup of water.  I also added red and green peppers (I can't stand pea pods or chestnuts) and it all turned out very well.  I thought it was pretty easy with maybe just a little tweaking for extra flavor.

I like this recipe because it is basicly a good base for just throwing something together.
I did not follow it exactly but we ended up having an exclent meal.

I really liked how the vegetables turned out - much better than the prepackaged, plus you can add other ingredients as liked - eg: baby corn or mushrooms.  I agree that it was a little too salty so low sodium soy sauce would be a good choice.

I thought this was a very easy recipe to make. Also it turned out very good. I used water instead of wine or apple juice, and it tasted just fine. Also served it over brown rice. I will make this again.

I made this recipe exactly as stated (using the white wine) and found it to be kind of sweet.  I was hoping for that "chinese take-out" flavor.  Maybe I should have tried adding other spices but I don't know what ones to add.  The recipe is very easy and quick to make, though.

This was excellent. I used white wine vinegar instead of white wine or apple juice. I found the vinegar taste strong so I added more sugar...a tablespoon or so more. The sauce stuck to the fry pan while I was cooking, it is helpful to have a glass of water at your side to dump in as you need it.

This was awesome.  I have already given this recipe to all my friends and family.  I did make a few changes, I did not add any pea pods and water chestnuts but added 2 sliced onions instead of chopped onions and added 2 tablespoons of chopped garlic.  I also doubled the sauce recipe as suggested.  I will be making this very often.  Delicious!!!!

I tried this recipe and I think that it has too much cornstarch in the recipe.  I tried it again and lowered the cornstarch from 2 tablespoons to 1 and 1/4 tablespoons and it was better.

Great flavor. Doubled the sauce.  Next time will use less sodium soy sauce or just use less.  Was a bit salty.

My 4 kids and husband loved this.  I also added garlic and pepper to the recipe. It was easy and delicious.  Some did comment that the soy flavor was a little strong, but some of us prefered it that way.  I have made a very similar dinner with chicken.  However, with the chicken one I used more garlic and 3 different kinds of pepper - delicious but a bit spicey the way I love it.

I thought this was just average; not great, not bad. The idea of using apple juice as the cooking liquid was interesting to me, but I would prefer more spices and seasonings.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I used about 20 oz. of frozen stir fry vegetables (carrots, asparagus, etc).  I used leftover steak that had already been marinated in soy sauce, as well as some chicken which I fried up to use really fast.  I used the white wine option, which I think helped counter the saltiness of the soy sauce, which can be a problem with stir fry.  I found the "sauce" to be tasty and very well-balanced.  This was a great quick dish and great for using up leftovers.  I'll be making this more often now.

I loved this recipe.  I, however, doubled the white wine, soy, sugar mixture to add a little more sauce(left the cornstarch measurement alone).  I also used part of a leftover sirloin steak for the meat.  I sauteed a little garlic in the oil to add a little flavor.  My husband LOVED it (he doesn't like Chinese/ Oriental foods).

Great stir fry recipe! I followed some of the other suggestions and added 1 clove of garlic, some fresh ginger and black pepper.  I didn't double the sauce and had plenty even though I didn't have exactly a pound of steak. I did, however, use lots of veggies though. I used red peppers, mushrooms, and celery as well. Might add some water next time, as the sauce was a bit strong.

I did not like this recipe. I followed other suggestions and doubled the sauce amount and cut down a bit on the soy sauce.  The flavour was very bland and when I tried to fry the beef, the sauce congealed into a thick mess that was burning.  I had to add a bunch of water to thin it down and then the meat was boiling, not frying.  It was really not good.  Sorry.

This has become one of our favorite recipes. I have made it using both chicken and beef. I have always used apple juice for the liguid in the meat marinade and seasoned oil when cooking. A very good stir fry recipe.

My wife liked this, and wants to have it again.  I thought the sauce was pretty bland.  Might be better if you threw in something to spice it up a little.

This recipe is delicious, and I've added it to my favorites.  I use low-sodium soy sauce it doesn't turn out too salty.
