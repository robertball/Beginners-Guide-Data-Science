Didn't have dried tomatoes, instead chopped a whole tomato and cooked with shrimp and garlic. Had a container of pesto on hand. VERY GOOD.

I added a lot more shrimp because my wife and I enjoy the shrimp, but overall the recipe was good. I also used about a tablespoon of pesto instead of the recommended amount. The pesto seems to be there for look and texture more than flavor, but put the amount you want or think is enough. One last thing, I couldn’t find sun-dried tomatoes, so I just got a large tomato and diced it. I’ll try and tweak the recipe in the future and it made for a nice lunch before work.

This is a great recipe to mess with!  I've made it twice and the only thing that stayed the same was the tortellini and the shrimp (needed to get them out of the freezer)!  I didn't use pesto either time - the first time I shredded fresh basil and the second time I used dried.  Both times I sauted fresh veggies that needed used up - zucchini, red and yellow peppers, what was left in a jar of roasted red peppers, etc.  I added dried red pepper flakes for more flavor.  This has become a go-to dish at our house.  I might try it with chicken the next time . . .

This is an easy and flavorful pasta dish.  My husband doesn’t care for sundried tomatoes so I chopped some fresh tomatoes for his portion and used sundried for mine.  Everyone enjoyed it.

This is a great tasting, easy to prepare, suitable for company recipe.  I did use a bit more garlic and shrimp than called for in the recipe, but other than that, no additions.  Terrific meal!

Changed it up just a little.  Used a whole package of peeled and deveined shrimp then soaked shrimp in lemon first then drained lemon juice off and used Irish butter to sauté shrimp instead of olive oil.   Doubled the sundried tomatoes (I like the kind packed in oil), added fresh spinach and garlic salt, and finally made my own pesto to add to it.  We kept the extra pesto on the side for those who really love pesto.  It was so good that everyone was cleaning the sauce from the plate with their bread.

Quick and tasty! Threw this together after work and the BF was impressed. I didn't have sun dried tomatoes, or any tomatoes...so I added a couple of T of jarred chopped pimentos for color. The container of pesto was 6oz so I just used it all.

I thought this recipe was a very good at first I think it seemed a little too Bland, not too much seasoning. I first cooked some green, red peppers, onions and garlic with a little sesame seed oil. I cooked the pasta in a medium sauce pan with the  vegetables. i season the shrimp with old bay and a little pepper. I then cooked the shrimp in with vegetables and pasta with a dash of raw coconut oil. once everything was done I added one cup of vodka sauce. it was delicious!!!!! I didn't use the pesto blend is just way too much oil and omitted the tomatoes because I use vodka sauce

I did not have all ingredients, but was able to find suitable substitutes. I found it to be refreshingly light and delicious. I will make this a recipe that will be on the menu at least once a month.
