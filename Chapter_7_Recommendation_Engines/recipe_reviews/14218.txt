So tasty but be warned - this is a tasty dish to take to a pot luck dinner but don't volanteer to take anything else. Here in NZ, we paid $6 for the melon, $16 for the chicken, $4 for the sour cream and $5 for the plain yoghurt. $4 for the celery, $4 for the grapes. This means a total of $41 dollars. But, then I saw how many people it was for (10) and then that works out at 4.10 per person.

I love this recipe.  I make it without the water chestnuts because my husband doesn't like them and it is still wonderful.  Great salad for lunches!

This is a nice summer salad.  It is best when all the ingredients are cold.  The submitter suggested using cantaloupe in place of the honeydew and that is what I did.  The dressing is light and the curry powder adds a nice touch of flavor.  Thanks Jen for sharing.

Abolubtely wonderful.  Make sure the ingredients are cold before mixing.  Very refreshing for a balmy summer evening.
