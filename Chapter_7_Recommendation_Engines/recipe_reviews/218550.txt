This salad is similar to one that was destroyed in a fire?  Then shouldn't it be named "Charred Garlic Salad"?

One of my new favorite salads.  All I can say is YUM! The flavor of the garlic is so good with the cabbage and all the other vegetables.

Despite it's title I found this really wanting for flavor. Added a little more vinegar and garlic which helped but won't be making this one again.

I can't say enough about this!!  Followed the ingredients exactly using apple cider vinegar and added pepper.  Chopped all of the veggies into squarish chunks so it was more like a chopped salad texture.  Made is in the afternoon and my family of 6 scarfed it down that night for dinner - couldn't wait til the next day!  Had put just enough aside to take to my parents for them to taste.  They both raved about it, too.  Mom sent me home with a head of cabbage from her fridge and instructions to "make this again right away!"

I loved this salad. I used Balsamic vinegar, added a seeded jalapeno (finely chopped) and plenty of freshly ground premium black peppercorns. My husband and I couldn't wait a day it was so yummy!

yes, this is a good salad recipe. however it needs more flavor for my taste too. adding freshly ground black pepper, fresh garlic, also balsamic vinegar instead of white, makes it perfecto!!
