This recipe is awsome! Just a tip my mother in law taught me. Whenever making green beans always use chicken broth instead of water. They taste so much better when you do.

I made this for Sunday dinner with the family and everyone loved them.  I cooked up some bacon instead of using ham and added extra onions.  Simple and delicious. Thanks

I used green beans right from the garden. I also omitted the ham and used bacon. I fried up four piece of bacon and added then last as so they would not get soggy. For a dash of flavor I added a 1-teaspoon of lemon pepper.

Very, very good. I did saute the onion and garlic together with the butter until translucent before adding the remaining ingredients. I also took another reviewer's advice and used homemade chicken broth in place of the water.

Husband really liked these.  I used 3 slices of bacon to replace the ham (we didn't have any)  Cooked the bacon and then removed.  Sauteed onions in drippings, then added the rest along with some fresh garlic.  Very very good.

DELICIOUS!  I made one small alteration.  Instead of water I used chicken stock.  (I never use water!) Meat stock improves any dish!

Absolutely LOVED these! I added one more clove of garlic and took the advice of others and used chicken broth. I also omitted the ham simply because i didn't have any on hand. Hubby said they were the best green beans he has ever had! Will make again!

These green beans were a wonderful addition to a rib dinner.  I usually use chicken broth when making green beans but thought that the combo of ham, onion, and garlic would make a flavorful enough broth so I made them as directed.  I think that the use of chicken broth in place of the water or a Tablespoon of a good quality chicken soup base such as Penzeys would have notched the flavor up to a 5 star plus recipe.

We love this recipe. I used 1/8 t. of garlic powder instead of the clove of garlic and also 1 T. of dried onion instead of chopped. (I just don't keep those fresh ingredients on hand.) I think it was a little much on the onion, and plan to try 2 t. of dried onion next time. Used water as called for instead of chicken stock as others recommended. These were soo terrific I wanted to eat the entire bowl. Great way to get my veggies.

I omitted the ham, and these turned out perfectly! Everyone in the family really enjoyed them, and they were easy to make - one less thing to have to watch over while you're cooking dinner.

Mine had a strange tang flavor to them.  We usually gobble green beans up, but my kids wouldn't touch these.  I guess I will have to stick to my old faithful recipe, but I thought these were a nice change (hence the 3 stars)

Great!  I used bacon and chicken broth.  I fried the bacon about half way then put the bacon, grease and all, into my enamel cast iron dutch oven.  Added the chopped onion and garlic and saute'd in the bacon fat until soft.  I cut down the butter slightly since I was leaving the bacon fat in the recipe.  Used fresh green beans from the garden with the ends cut off and the large ones cut in half.  Just added to the dutch oven, then stirred in a can of chicken broth and added the salt and pepper.  Stirred (or sorta tossed really) just a little.  I heated to where the chicken broth was bubbling a bit, then turned down to barely simmering, put a lid on and cooked it for well over an hour while my chicken was roasting in the oven.  Yummy.

This is an excellent medley of flavors.  I modified the recipe little.  First, I doubled the garlic to 2 cloves. I supplanted bacon for ham and I cooked the bacon and crumbled and set aside.  I added a few pads of butter to the bacon grease and then I cooked onion and garlic first (2-3 mins) until I could smell the garlic.  Then I added the green beans, bacon, and spices (I added a tsp of dried basil because it is delicious with green beans).  After the beans were a little soft (1 min) I added 1/4 C of chicken stock, covered, and simmered or 15 mins covered.  It was PERFECT!

My husband and I loved these green beans. My 5yr old son didnt so much, but he doesn't care for ham and beans together anyway. I did not use onion, but added onion powder. I would suggest cutting back on the butter. It adds a great flavor, but it very heavy on the beans. I also used fresh beans, washed and trimmed. Same amount of water in the pan, just covered and let it simmer for about 20 min. until tender.

This was very good & simple.  I substituted haricot verts for the regular green beans.  I used an extra clove of garlic & sauteed it in the margarine with the onion before adding the other ingredients.

Those beans were wonderful and reminded me of my childhood when my grandmother would cook green beans. I fried bacon instead of using ham and used chicken broth instead of water as others suggested.

These were soooo good. Such a nice change from the standard green bean side dish. A few changes: I omitted the ham and instead of water I used chicken broth (broth of anykind is so much more flavorful than water). I also sauted the onion and garlic for a few minutes in olive oil then added the green beans just to coat in the mixture and finally, added the chicken broth an let it simmer for about 10 minutes. Wonderful!!

I reduced the butter in half... as it just seemed a bit much for me, and WOW!  This was fantatic, my 3 year old asked for more and my husband asked me to keep the recipe handy so I can make it again - soon.

Thanks for sharing!

I followed this recipe exactly as written and it was just okay.  I think it would much tastier if the onions, ham and garlic were browned first before adding the green beans and water.  As it was, the flavors were thin.  Thanks for letting me try.

This was wonderful. I only had one child that didn't like the fresh green beans, other then that. The recipe was excellent. I feel the next time I'll lower the amount of butter, even though I used Blue Bonnet light, I'd like it just a little bit lighter in the butter department. But all in all..Hubby says it's a keeper because this is the way he likes fresh green beans. Thanks

These were easy, yummy, and inexpensive.  I will make these regularly when we eat ham.  Served them with our Easter dinner as a side to honey baked ham and just tossed a handful of that in.  Easy and yummy!

Fabulous!  I use a precooked flavored sausage (chicken garlic) and also use the chicken stock in place of water.  I tried the water the first time I made it, it was awesome but this time around with chicken stock, even better.  I use fresh beans from my garden, this is a great way to showcase your beans.

This is a wonderful recipe just as it is!!  You may want to try substituting bacon for the ham and chicken broth for the 1/4 cup of water.  Those changes pushed it to 5 stars for me.  This is one of my favorite side dishes.

These were mouthwatering! I did a few things different, I used more butter and garlic than the recipe calls for, I also used minced onions, (I didn't have any fresh)  and I also left out the ham, but I feel i didn't miss it at all. Delicious! this is a keeper.

These are awesome! I fried up 4 strips of bacon then removed them from the skillet. Tossed in the chopped onions and 2 gloves of garlic (we love garlic). After cooking those until clear I added the chicken stock (instead of water), butter and bacon and topped it off with sea salt and ground pepper. What a great, country cookin' recipe!

Wonderful.....Also changed out the ham for  Oscar Meyer-Ready cooked bacon (MUCH QUICKER)... and switched the water for Chicken Broth......Put everything together in a Ziploc bag in the morning so all I had to do was pour in the pan and add broth and butter when it was time to eat....served for Mother's Day yesterday and they were a HUGE Hit with my parent's-In-Laws-& Husband!!! Thanks for sharing!!

So yummy and just like I had growing up! I used bacon instead of ham, chicken broth instead of water, but otherwise kept it the same. Delicious!

I didn't have ham, so I used bacon and just added it in at the end so it wouldn't get mushy.  These were delicious.

Per reviews: I used 3 strips of bacon in place of ham, 1/2 a chicken bouillon cube, no salt, and dropped it down to 1 Tbl butter. 
AMAZING!

I've made this twice now: once exactly as written and once without the butter. Delicious either way, so I'll leave out the butter next time. It's important to use fresh, crisp green beans. A little leftover ham makes these beans just right!

Wonderful recipe.  This is the 3rd year in a row that I have made these green beans for Thanksgiving.  Even the kids love them.  The only things I do differently than the recipe states is that I use turkey bacon as my husband does not eat any pork products, double the recipe and I use whole thin frozen green beans as it is hard to find good fresh ones.  Absolutely delicious and very easy to make.

Very good. I used chicken broth instead of water, bacon instead of ham, and sauteed the onion in the bacon drippings. I recommend this recipe. Thanks.

Loved these.  Due to diet restrictions, I used 1/2 T light butter instead of 1/4 c butter and 1 slice cooked bacon instead of the ham. Still delicious! Agree that using veggie or chicken broth instead of water gives them more flavor. YUM - thanks for a great way to fix green beans!

This was a HUGE hit with my family and even my 18 month old (who never eats veggies) loved them. I did follow the advice of the previous poster and used chicken broth in place of the water but they were sooooooo tasty. I also omitted the ham but they were lovely as a side :)

We used a ham flavored bouillon/seasoning because we are vegetarian and it turned out just as yummy.  This is the epitome of a classic home style southern dish.

These were good and the typical southern green bean dish that I remember when I lived in NC. I used bacon instead of the ham and used chicken broth to add another layer of flavor.

Delicious!  My company went back for second and thirds on these.  I didn't have any ham, but the taste was still great.  As others suggested, I steamed the beans first for 5 minutes.  Since I don't count calories, I used 2 TLBS. butter and 2 TBLS. bacon fat, rather than 1/4 cup butter. YUM! Will become part of my rotation file.

I sauteed the onion and garlic for just a couple minutes (in olive oil rather than butter), threw the ham in and sauteed for another minute then added the rest of the ingredients.  I would probably reduce the simmering time to 15 minutes as we like our green beans a little crunchy.  I also used chicken broth instead of water for extra flavor.

I salvaged not-so-fresh grocery store green beans with this recipe.  Per other reviews I also switched out the ham in favor of last minute sprinkling of cooked bacon.  Delicious.

Mmmmmmm!  So good!  I used fresh green beans from the garden.  I also used 6 strips of bacon rather than ham.  I fried the bacon first, then used the leftover grease and about 2 T. butter to make the rest.  (I let the bacon drain on a paper towel while the green beans were cooking so they wouldn't lose the crispness.)  So tasty!  Next time I will use chicken broth instead of water, as other reviewers have noted.

I made this for Christmas lunch, and it turned out great. I ran out of onions, so couldn't add those, and used serrano ham (like prosciutto) instead of cooked ham, chicken broth instead of water (and left out the salt), and a lot less butter. It was very easy and tasty, and my guests liked it. Will definitely make this again.

I also followed the recipe as written and it was okay; a borderline 2-star rating.  I used fresh green beans but the onion, smoked ham, butter, and garlic just didn't provide flavor to the beans. Perhaps broth would have improved the flavor but increase the fat and calories and I was looking for a healthy recipe. I won't make this again although it was flavorless and edible.

These are the best green beans I've ever had! And so easy! I simplified this recipe a bit by using canned green beans (draining about 1/2 of the liquid). I used 3 pieces of bacon. I fried the bacon half way in a pain, cut it up into smaller pieces, then dumped it and 1/2 of the bacon grease in with the beans. Then I sauteed vidalia onions in the remaining bacon grease, then dumped those in and let it sit on low for 20 mins to meld the flavors. I also added a few small pinches of Stacey's Hamburger Seasoning (search for the recipe). It was the BEST green beans I've ever had. Sooo delicious.

This was interesting.  My husband and I were amazed at how much the greanbeans changed the flavor of the ham. (not that that is a bad thing)  We weren't sure exactly what to make of this.  The flavors were pretty good, however, what we had for dinner apparently did not blend well with the country flare.  So next time I make this, I think I'll make it with some fried chicken and mashed potatoes. ;)

Used bacon instead of ham. Powdered garlic instead of a fresh clove. Frozen green beans instead of fresh... let it simmer on the stove until the beans were tender. Delicious!

DELICIOUS! And super easy! Doubled the ham and it was perfect. Didn't think all the butter was necessary and I'd lower the amount for next time. Be sure not to over cook it! Otherwise it will end up watery.

This recipe was very good. I sauteed the onion and garlic before adding the ham and green beans. I left out the water completely, but it turned out I really didn't need the excess liquid at all. I also left out the salt. The ham was salty enough on its own. The only negative was the amount of butter the recipe called for. I used the full amount stated, but next time I will cut that amount in half and then add a couple tablespoons of chicken broth or water.

Absolutely delicious! I didn't have any ham so I used bacon as some of the other reviews had stated. Will definitely make this again. Tonight I tried the same recipe with frozen peas instead of the beans (and used ham this time). Everyone loved it!

This was delicious!! I'm so proud of myself for making this and making it right! Anyone looking for a quick and easy side dish---you found it. I did, however, cheat a lot. I used canned green beans, left out ham (vegetarian), bought a squeeze bottle of minced garlic--kinda just dumped it into the pan without measuring. PERFECT!! As suggested, I did saute the onions/butter and then garlic before adding the rest of the ingredients.

I make something similar to this but I do it a little differently. I melt my butter and saute onion and garlic and cut up bacon pieces. Then I snap off the ends of the green beans and boil them in salted water in a seperate pan for 10 minutes. Then I drain the water and mix in the green beans with the onion, butter and bacon. Always a big hit when we have dinner parties.

Will probably use a little less butter next time but these were the best green beans I've ever made!  I also used bacon (2 slices) instead of ham and cooked the onion in bacon grease.  Simmered for about 30 minutes because I like my green beans softer.  Yum!!

I am not a green bean lover and after looking at the ingredients I wasn't expecting much. I had some green beans I needed to cook and I decided I'd try this recipe since the reviews were so good. I was so pleasantly suprised when I tried it. Finally a green bean recipe I like!  Yummy, yummy, what a gem.

This was fantastic. I even had to make a few substitutions because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, and it still turned out great! Had to leave out the ham, and substituted garlic salt for fresh garlic because that's what I had. Also substituted the onion with a shallot, for even better flavor. Will definitely be making again.

YUM! I have never made fresh beans before and this recipe was super easy and came out flavorful. I didn't have any ham available so I substituted bacon instead. I followed another users advice and used chicken broth instead of water. The rest of the recipe I followed exact. My family loved this and I plan on adding this to regular dinner menu.

Delicious!  We used one can of ham.  We sauteed the onion and garlic in the butter, than added the ham, cooked for 3-4 minutes, then added the remaining ingredients.  Will definitely use again!

Wow! I always enjoy green beans but this was incredible. I didn't have fresh green beans so I used frozen. I also didn't have any bacon or ham but I did have real bacon bits so I threw a handful in. They turned out great. This is a recipe that will go into my keeper recipe box. Thanks for the recipe Linda.

These were very good! I added diced potatoes, some basil, used chicken broth, and added bacon at the end instead of ham. I have told everyone about this recipe and I have made it 3 times in about 2 weeks. (w/lots of compliments!) I will definitely make this for any get-togethers I go to. Love it..Thank you!

Great side dish.  Even my three elementary aged kids ate it.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't have any ham.  And I probably simmered them a little longer than stated.  This will be a staple veggie for us.

We cheated and used canned green beans.  They were eaten and loved by many.  A yummy basic bean recipe with some flavor and zest instead of just beans.  (Easy to do while camping for Thanksgiving in the crock pot).

I spent time reading reviews before making this dish.  As the majority of you stated, it is better to substitute bacon for ham and broth for water, so that is exactly what I did.  In fact, I got a head start on making this dish early in the day for a party that evening, so I mixed up the beans, onion, garlic and bacon early in the day and stored in the refrigerator to let them marinate, and right before cooking, I added the broth and butter.  My only complaint was the amount of butter.  The green beans were absolutely coated and tasted and looked greasy. It made it less appealing, and the following day, there was congealed butter at the bottom of the tupperware dish.  Next time, I will double the broth and omit the butter completely.

We put 2 slices bacon in a stock pot, followed by 1 garlic clove, 1 red onion, about 2 cups beef broth.  When boiling, added one red potato, cubed, and green beans.  Covered, simmered for about 1 hour, added fresh basil and rosemary, and IT WAS DELICIOUS!!!!  Thank you!

These were wonderful! Just needed another side dish (in addition to my rosemary potatoes) to go with my ribeye dinner. I didn't have any ham on hand, but they were terrific without it! Next time I will try it with the ham or bacon. Also I used chicken stock instead of water. I sauteed the chopped onions with the butter a little bit before adding all the other ingredients. 
So yummy, they were gone in a jiffy!

This is my new green bean recipe! I did make changes based on reviews... used an entire onion, broth instead of water, and 3 cloves of garlic. I also used canadian bacon since thats what I had on hand.. and it was awesome! This was the first thing to go at dinner. Next time I'll cut the butter way down and omit the salt so we can have this more often and be guilt free. Thanks for a delicious, adaptable recipe! YUM

These were great and I would give them 5 stars except I changed two things in the recipe.  I used chicken stock instead of water and bacon instead of diced ham.  They turned out great - just add the diced cooked bacon last so it doesn't get mushy.  Great recipe!

My kids absolutely LOVE this recipe. I have to double it for my family of 5. I do switch the ham for cooked bacon (I cheated on Easter and bought the fully cooked bacon and just used my kitchen sissors and cut it right over the pot) and it is wonderful!!!

We grew pole beans this summer and I froze many of them, but when I found this recipe I tried it with the addition of ham chunks!  This is something that keeps your mouth watering and wanting more.  Exceptional Taste!

Try substituting Turkey Ham (cubed) for a healthier option! I make my green beans this way in a crock pot (frozen green beans, chicken broth, garlic powder-sometimes use minced garlic in olive oil depending on whats on the shelf that day), and onion-fresh or minced (dry). Delicious!

Want a healthier version? Nice without the ham...can cut back significantly on the butter.

Green Beans have never tasted as good as this. I leave out the ham because I don't really eat meat but I use this recipe with all kinds of veggies not just green beans and they all turn out AMAZING. Thank you Linda!

BRAVO!!!  My picky 5 y.o. daughter asked for thirds.  My 1 year old ate about 10 beans.  I did take prior suggestions of chicken broth.  I also used my cast iron skillet  to saute the onion, garlic and ham in the butter.  Once the onions were translucent I added the beans.  I cooked the beans for about 4 minutes, stirring about every 30 - 40 secs to coat with the butter mixture.  Then I added the mixture to 1/4 of chicken broth.  The best beans ever.

I subbed the water with chicken broth, bacon instead of ham, and instead of onions (my family is picky about onions) I used half a packet of onion soup mix. DELICIOUS!!!!

I made this recipe minus the ham. Also, I followed the advice of another reviewer and used chicken stock instead of water. My family really enjoyed this recipe. Thank you for sharing. Will definitely be making this one more often... and will be making it with the ham on occasion as well. Thank you for sharing!

I used several slices of bacon instead of ham and omitted the water and they were delicious!  I will make sure I try them with ham but I happened to have bacon on hand and several of the reviewers preferred it that way.

One time I was cooking for a crowd and they were ready too early, so I put the pan of green beans in the oven until everything else was done.  Surprise...even better when they were just slightly browned so now I do that intentionally.

Husband LOVED this recipe!  My first time actually cooking fresh green beans...*blush*...and they turned out GREAT! :D I used bacon, of course, 4 whole strips, and cooked the bacon and onions together (I used half a small onion).  I also used pre-minced garlic that comes in the jars.  Fantastic recipe, so much easier than I ever imagined! :D Thanks Linda!

I followed several reviews.  So I used bacon and chicken broth which were great recommendations!  I also used canned French style green beans since I had them on hand.  This worked out very well.  I also doubled the recipe, but did not double the butter and you would never have known it!  I have never liked green beans before having this recipe! Thanks for sharing and for all the tips!

Just average tasting, and I made it with chicken broth. Followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  Several people at the party I went to left their beans untouched on their plates.  It was easy, just not great.

Delicious!  I also used finely chopped leftover bacon (about 4 slices for 2 pounds of green beans) and cooked them much longer than recommended (maybe 40 minutes?) so they got soft and absorbed the sauce.  These taste EXACTLY like the Bird's Eye Green Beans and Spaetzel frozen dish but are obviously much better fresh!

This recipe leaves my husband cleaning his plate every time!!!  Since we try not to eat pork, I substituted smoked turkey necks and it was EXCELLENT!  Make sure to get the "smoked" turkey necks if you can b/c it does make a difference in the taste.  Sometimes, I'll cook the turkey necks in the pot w/the onions for a while first, and then remove the turkey necks and cut the meat off of the bone and then throw the meat and the bones back in the pot w/the green beans!  YUMMY!!!

Perfect.  I substitiuted bacon for the ham, which was delicious.  However, since the bacon has more fat than ham, next time I will cut the butter in half.  The butter/bacon fat was a little heavy for the beans.  I also cooked these about 40 minutes, because I wanted them soft.

Substituted turkey bacon for the ham and added the bacon right before serving. Also substituted chicken broth for water. These were some of the best green beans we've ever eaten! Will definitely make again.

this is the best method for preparing fresh green beans that I found. And you can vary the additions/seasoning as desired. I'll use this one every time now! Thanks!

Very good.  I cooked on the stovetop, then put them in the crockpot on warm until time to take them to my sister's for a family gathering.  Doubled the amounts, otherwise, followed the recipe exactly.

These were the best green beans! My one year old (who hates veggies) almost ate the entire dish! Definitely use fresh green beans and chicken broth instead of water!

We have had a good crop of beans so far and I was at a loss on how to use them all. This recipe worked great. Followed others advice and used Chicken broth instead of water and bacon for ham. They were flavorful but needed something more. I will try a touch of dijon mustard in the mix next time to try to add some punch. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is simple and delicious, i love it. I make it every Thanksgiving,and in between for meals and my family eats it up. They finish this on thanksgiving before they finish any other sides...I use chicken stock, olive oil, more garlic, red onion, salt and pepper...and u have a perfect and healthy side!!!

This was absolutely delicious!! The only problem I found with it was that is seemed too salty. However, that may be a little of my own fault. I used more ham than was called for (was eating this as my main dish. along with cornbread), but did not reduce the amount of salt I put in. Definitely will next time.

Fabulous and easy.  Used fresh green beans already packaged in the market.  The only thing I exchanged was chicken stock for the water as suggested by others and because of that I didn't bother adding any salt.  PERFECT! Even my picky eaters loved it.  Will make again. Thank you!

This took me on a trip down memory lane.  I used chicken stock in place of water for extra flavor.  My grandmother always put potato in her green beans, so I added a small golden potato that was chopped the same size as the ham.  Thanks so much for sharing.  I never got to ask my grandma for her recipe before she passed.  Now I have this recipe to come to when I miss her.

How is it that I have been making beans any other way my whole life?  These are delicious and SO EASY.  I also took the advice of others and used chicken stock - I did half stock and half water. I bet it would be great with just water too.

This will now be one of my go to recipes for green beans.  First I sauteed some bacon with the chopped onions and after the onions were translucent, I added everything else.  Great thing about using bacon, besides the fact that it add greats flavor, you can use less salt and butter.

This dish is so easy and delicious! I only substituted bacon for the ham because we don't eat to much ham. My brother in law does not like green beans and ate the majority of the bowl. Everyone raved about this. It's one of my favorites.

I followed others' advice and used chicken broth instead of water.  I did not have fresh garlic or onion, so I substituted garlic powder (1/8 tsp) and minced onion (about 1 tsp) per another recommendation.  I also used frozen green beans.  They were great!  Lots of compliments.

These beans are awesome and easy.  Only change I made was using chicken broth instead of water and then I didn't add any salt.  My 9-year-old daughter said "this is the first time I have ever liked ANY kind of beans!"  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I'm a fresh and simple kind of gal when it comes to veggies, but this was a nice change.  There's quite a bit of butter sauce after cooking, which I poured over our baked potatoes, and placed a dab on our steaks.  Delish!  I took off about 5 minutes of cooking time, and they were nicely crisp/tender.

I could not believe how good this simple recipe turned out. I followed the recipe exactly except used chicken broth like the other reviewers suggested. At the end I threw in some diced up Krakus ham I had in the lunch meat drawer.  Next time I will try to cut down on the butter, but it sure was good the way it was!

Great way to use leftover ham!  I added a couple of slices of lemon after covering it - a keeper!  Thanks for the recipe.

I loved it! The only things I did different was that I used frozen green beans, Earth Balance butter (I'm on a dairy-free diet) and 4 slices of turkey bacon. I will make this again! :)

This is a great recipe as written, but the second time I made it I did a little alteration.  I cooked up a few pieces of bacon and then chopped the bacon and used the bacon pieces rather than ham and a spoonful of bacon grease rather than the butter.  I also used chicken stock rather than water.  These were exactly like the green beans I remember as a kid that my southern "grandma" used to make.  The whole family raved about them.

Very tasty, even with canned green beans. Also recommend bacon over ham, as suggested by others. I sprinkled with sesame seeds before serving.

Fantastic!!!  I had 2 cans of french style green beans and needed a side dish tonight....quick!  I used deli ham and it turned out delicious!  I didn't add water...just used the liquid from the can.  Thank you for helping me to avoid a trip to the market!  :)

Made it last night for probably the 10th time. I reduced the butter to half and it was actually a lot better. Would definitely recommend this recipe, but play with the butter quantities to your liking.

Used chicken broth instead of water, as suggested by previous reviewer.  So yummy!  Nice comfort food side dish, and very easy to make.  You can even get a small pack of already chopped ham to make it even easier.  Also a fun task for me and my little girl to snap those beans together.  Makes the whole house smell even more like home.

Very good.  My family can't get enough and its so easy to make.  I did sub campbells chicken broth for water as other suggested.  I cooked these for about 30-40 minutes as my family likes green beans very tender.  I guess its a matter of preference.

BTW,  for the vegetarians  out there,  I made these with veggie stock and no meat once and my meat-eating boyfriend says its just as good.

Who would have thought this simple side dish I made at the last minute for Thanksgiving would have been such a hit!  My 20 year old nephews who don't eat many vegetables, inhaled them.  My brother said they were the best he ever had.  I barely got a couple tablespoons because they were gone!  I'll have to make them again soon.  And did I mention they could not have been easier?  Made exactly as stated except chicken broth for water.  Am so happy to have found this awesome recipe!

This recipe is delicious.  I am a southern cook, and the only change I made to this recipe was substituting the ham for bacon. These beans taste better than my mother's, which is pretty hard to beat!

Very good! 15-20 min cook time doesn't do it here in the south though. We don't like our green beans crunchy. About an hour is good for us. The seasonings were perfect though. Thanks!

Certainly better than steamed. Someone suggested using chicken broth instead of water - will do that from now on. Increased the amount of garlic - probably a mistake because it dominated the other flavors. Overall, a very nice way to prep green beans.

Really good!  I think I'll do it in a saute pan next time instead of a sauce pan and let it cook a little longer.

made these as a part of our thanksgiving meal and they were a huge hit! Of course, it doesn't hurt that I'm southern and love to put bacon in everything but there were northerners at the table who loved this dish as well! ;-)

My family liked these pretty well.  We can't eat pork, so I substituted beef bacon for the ham, but it still was good.

Made these for Christmas and everyone thought they were excellent.  Followed the recipe except I used frozen beans for the fresh.  The fresh beans were not looking so good that week at the grocery store.  Our eight year old thought they were too oniony so maybe I will cut back the onion next time for her :)

These green beans are so good. But I do believe that part of the reason of them being so darn good was because a I used left over honey baked ham from Thanksgiving. I also used canned beans and 1/4 cup of water but added chicken bouillon for give the beans ever more flavor. I believe plain green beans are a thing of the past for me. I paired this with chucks fav mac n cheese and it was a perfect pairing. Great comfort food.

Very good, but heavy on butter. Next time I make this, I plan on using less butter and I plan on subbing chicken stock for water.

Great recipe.  Everyone loves it.  Definitely used Chicken (or vegetable) broth inplace water.  Did not over cook, so green beans still had a little crunch to them.  Nice texture.

We call these WV beans, this is how we make all our beans from green beans to lima beans, canned, fresh or dried. Couple notes: instead of garlic add a dash or two celery seed, celery salt or celery powder; I only use a pat or two of butter/margarine not 1/4 c; you can subsitute bacon slices, ham base or beef base instead of cooked ham and if using canned beans I drain broth into pot, add about 1/2 c water then add the other ingredients (not beans) boil for about 5 mins then add the beans and simmer until done. For extra zip try putting some red pepper flakes in.

This was a great addition to my Thanksgiving dinner. I didnt use ham, instead I pan fried up bacon let it cool then crumbled it into the beans. Added some minced fresh garlic and it came out perfect! Thank you for the recipe!

I used bacon and these turned out pretty good considering I am not a huge green bean fan.  It takes a lot of fattening ingredients to give these flavor but this is the way my family likes them and I was asked to bring them for Thanksgiving and everyone seemed to like them.  Pretty quick and easy too which is a plus.  I used frozen beans.

I made this with chicken broth instead of water and I thought they still lacked a little flavor.  Next time I may add some onion powder or lemon pepper or something.  Overall a good recipe, though.

WOW!!!  These were Delicious!!!  I made them for Thanksgiving this year, praying that they'd turn out as good as all the reviews said they did.  Yup!  They did.  :o)  I used real bacon pieces, down the salad aisle.  I also took the advice of using Chicken Broth instead of water.  Someone in my family came up to me as I was cooking the onion, garlic & butter & they were SHOCKED at what looked like a TON of onions!  I coarsely cup up 1 1/4 big onions, and much to his delight - it was DELICIOUS!!!  I will make this recipe 100 times again and I will look forward to eating them on every single occasion!!!  Thank you for sharing your yummy "Country Green Bean" recipe.  I loved it!  (I doubled this recipe for our Thanksgiving crowd.  I threw the cut beans into already boiling water for 4 minutes, removed them from the hot water & shocked them with a cold water rinse.  I guess it's supposed to bring out the bright green color and add to their flavor.  I've never "blanched" anything before.  A tip from a coworker of mine.)

I found this recipe at the last minute and put it together exactly, minus the ham. It was fabulous and easy and my picky husband loved them too!

This was great & easy.  Next time I will try the chicken stock though and see if I like it better.  My boyfriend thought it had a little too much butter, but I think it's great.

This was so incredibly delicious! I used chicken bouillon because I did not have chicken broth, added extra onions and used apple wood smoked ham.  Absolutely scrumptious!

Awesome!!! I had about 1 1/3lb. of green beans...kept the butter at same amount and adjusted everything else. I did use chicken stock in place of water. Even my kids ate (5,4,3) went back for seconds.

I was looking for a way to doctor up some canned green beans.  I took 2 large cans of green beans, kept everything else the same except doing 4 slices of bacon and adding the grease.  They were awesome, will do again!

Tasty as is. Would like to try a different type of ham next time. Served with "Chicken on a Stick," "Dill, Feta and Garlic Cream Cheese Spread" with Italian Bread, and "Sugar Snap Peas."

Wonderful. I didn't use ham because my family and I aren't fans of having meat in our veggies, especially if meat is the main course. I'm from health-conscious California and we tend to alter Southern cooking to make it healthier. :) Was still delicious. I did use chicken stock instead of water, as well.

This is so delicious.  I didn't have any ham on hand so just made it without and it was great.  Next time I will follow the advice of a former reviewer and use chicken stock instead of water; that will really enhance the flavor.

I didn't have any ham to put in it and I substituted veggie stock for the water, but this was sooo good!  I had green beans right out of the garden and this recipe did them justice.  This will be my go-to recipe from now on.  Delicious!

Great recipe. I had been looking for a good green bean recipe for a long time.  I omitted the ham since we don't eat pork and used ham flavored seasoning instead. And I also used chicken stock.

These were awesome!  I didn't have any hamhocks on hand, but I had some left over bacon, which was wonderful. It reminded me so much of my late Mother-in-laws green beans.  Thank you so much for sharing.

I am from the south and I never thought of putting garlic into green beans.  I tried this recipe because of the excellent rating although I was not sure if my family would like it.  I do not think it is right to review a recipe and give it anything other than 5 stars unless I followed the recipe exactly!  In this case I did not follow the recipe exactly.  Instead of chopped onions and garlic I put powders.  Instead of ham I used bacon grease. I also cooked the beans longer than the recipe called for because my family prefers them more tender.  My daughter who does not normally like grean beans raved about them! I will make this recipe again!

This was fabulous. I used chicken stock instead of water. I sauteed mushrooms,onion, and garlic and then added them to the green beans. I also used canadian bacon because that was what I had on hand. I don't even like green beans but now I will be eating them all the time.Thanks for a great recipe!!!

I thought these were awesome.  I used bacon instead of ham because i did not have ham on hand at the time. But overall turned out awesome.

I've been making my green beans like this since I've started cooking, and i love them. I usually just dress up canned green beans this way but i know fresh is best! most of the time i use bacon in place of the ham. My mom always made hers with a ham hock and they were soooooo good! These flavors and beans were meant to be together!

Absolutely fantastic! Sooo simple and very tasty in the same time. I am very happy i tried this recipe, i was looking for a good green bean recipe for a long time and now this one is a keeper. I didn't change anything the first time, but next time i will try to cut butter by half. Thank you very much!

Very good and easy.  I used a can of green beans and it still turned out pretty good.  I will take the advice of others and try chicken broth next time.  I put the butter, onions, and garlic in first and used bacon bits at the end.  It was really good.

Very good.  I also cook green beans in chicken broth, it gives them a nice flavor. I switch between bacon and ham when making this.. which ever I have on hand.

These were a great way to jazz up beans, easy too!  Instead of ham, I used the Daystarters cooked turkey slices .  I also used butter.  I used frozen green beans, and the time listed here was too long, so mine ended up a bit mushy.  But they still tasted wonderful!

A great way to use up a little leftover holiday ham!  I omitted the butter and used chicken broth - very flavorful!  The kids gobbled up their veggies.  Thanks!

I made this as a part of our Christmas meal.  I followed it exactly except I omitted the meat since I had no ham or bacon.  Other reviewers seemed to think it was great without it.  They were correct IMHO!  Everyone else said they were "good".  I think these were one of the best tasting green beans I ever ate.  I live in a big city with plenty of varieties of tasty eateries.  But this blend of veggies just worked great!  I must admit though that I do like onions and garlic.  I know lots of people don't like or are intestinally bothered by these veggies so they shy away from some dishes.  But if your OK with them then you REALLY should give this recipe a try.

Thanks for posting it!

John

I didn't have any ham to use, but this still turned fresh green beans into a quick and delicious side dish.  Baby green beans were perfect - my husband said YUM!
