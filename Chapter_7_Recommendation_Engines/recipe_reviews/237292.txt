Definitely a keeper recipe! If you are looking for a "feed that craving" donut this is for you!  The fact that it is GF is simply a plus, but will satisfy anyone; celiac or not.  The coconut flavour is not overpowering which is something I was concerned about.  They are easy and fast to make.  The ratios of flours and liquids are right on as are the instructions.  I used a soup spoon to drop the batter in the oil and they held together perfectly.  The first half of the batter I used as directed, then I added about 1/2 Tbsp of baking powder and that lightened them up even more.  The original recipe yields a light and delicious donut.  The addition of the baking powder rendered even more light and delicate giving it the stretch and airy texture you get with yeast donuts, the kind that simply melt in your mouth.  I ended up with 15 donuts, each about 2.5 inches in diameter.  Thank you Michelle2s for this fantastic recipe.  No need to cry when passing by the donut shop anymore!  :-)

These were pretty good. However, the taste was very bland. I added about 2 teaspoons of nutmeg. It was also not sweet enough, so i made a cream cheese pumpkin filling, and that turned out great. (If you like pumpkin) Otherwise, a great treat.

This was a fantastic recipe, and it was so happy to find it. I was a little nervous at the lack of other's reviews, but needed a gf recipe for a school function. I made the recipe as instructed, with only modifying the baking powder as mentioned in the review. They did puff up a lot more, but almost had that bp aftertaste. 
Frying them in exclusively olive oil seemed like a bad idea, b/c of the low smoke point of evoo, so I went with half coconut oil, and half evoo, which worked fine.  We are not a gf house, but our diet is close, so instead of powdered sugar I rolled the lovely donuts in evaporated cane juice. YUM. 
Thanks for this recipe! It is good and easy enough to make weekly, and keep my family out of dunkin donuts.

I had been craving donuts for about a month now and I cant have gluten so this recipe was a God send in this situation.. I printed the recipe and started to make it.. I made a cpl substitutions like almond milk for the coconut milk and xanthan gum instead of guar. The result was amazing. They were delicious and super satisfying.. They were a slight bit more dense than your average donut but still just light enough..I rolled them in brown sugar and cinnamon and all I can say is thank you for sharing this recipe. the measurements were perfect for me so they didn't yield a surplus that id end up wasting in the next cpl day.. just perfect..thank you a million times thank you.

I have not tried this recipe yet, but I intend to soon.  It looks delicious.  In response to foodiegoodie, you should be able to substitute xanthan gum for the guar gum.  It is more commonly used in gluten free baking and is handy to have on hand if you intend to bake more gluten free.  You would use just a little less of the xanthan.

I gave this recipe four stars as is but with a few modifications it gets five stars. :-) Based on some other reviews, I added 1 T. baking powder and 1 T. of sugar and I upped the honey from 2 tsp. to 1 T. I found that you need to make them very small (no more than 2 T. each) or they burn before the center can cook. Keep that oil under 300 degrees! Rolling them in powdered sugar just created a gummy mess and poor coverage, so I sifted the sugar on to far better effect. I also dusted them with some cinnamon. Finally, they have no shelf life so eat them hot. The recipe is small by design so that shouldn't be too much of a problem!

Wow!  So amazing.  I added an extra egg (by accident) because I quadrupled the recipe.  I also replaced the honey with brown sugar because I didn't have honey and I got Gluten Free Louisiana style beignets!  Oh my!  I could eat the whole batch!  So basically I quadrupled but put in 5 eggs instead of 4.

GREAT recipe! Tweaked it slightly by adding the baking powder as others had suggested as well as a bit of vanilla extract and apple pie seasoning. Just for a bit of flavor ??. YUM! And so easy!

These turned out super mediocre. I followed the recipe to a T and they just did not live up to the expectations of flavor. We ate 2 whole batches of them in a couple hours anyway and are now filled with tremendous regret, so I guess they were worth the efforts  the batter looked great, the doughnuts looks okay, texture was okayish, but as most GF baking, the flavor was lacking and the texture was not that of a doughnut.

So yummy and fluffy. Will try adding baking powder next time.  Keep the balls small so they get a chance to cook fully before burning. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

dip in raw honey to serve :)  
but I will use coconut oil for frying - olive oil is best used cold for quality purposes.

It ended up being bland, so added some additional sweetener and spice
