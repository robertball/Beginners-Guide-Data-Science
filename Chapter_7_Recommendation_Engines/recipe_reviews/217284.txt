After reading the reviews, the stickiness of the dough seemed to be an issue, so I reduced the amount of milk to 1-3/4 cups.  Kept everything else the same (including 6 cups of A/P flour), and let the KA do all of the kneading.  This yielded absolutely beautiful dough so easy to work with.  I'm new to yeast bread baking, and I wasn't sure what dipping the dough into the baking soda-water mixture did, but you definitely get a little bit of that taste, and that's a good thing, so don't skip this step.  I formed these into different shapes...coiled,  square, round, made a few bread sticks,  and topped with Trader Joe's kosher salt.  Next time I make these, I'll make more bread sticks because they are delicious dipped into mustard.  The baked bun texture is perfect, the dough very pliable (not at all sticky), and the flavor similar to the mall pretzels.  Thank you for sharing this fabulous recipe...this one is going into my favorites folder.

These turned out perfect!  I tweaked it just a bit and tossed everything in my bread machine.  If I can get it to work in my bread machine then it's a great recipe.  I only used 1 1/2 cups milk, used 3 cups bread flour and 3 cups AP flour, 6 Tbsp oil and 3 tsp yeast.  The dough wasn't sticky at all.  Came out very pliable and easy to work with.  I divided it into 12 balls, slit an X into the tops dipped each into the hot water bath then let rise for about an hour.  Then I brushed with the butter and sprinkled with Kosher salt.  Only baked 20 minutes and they were just "crunchy" enough on the tops yet sooo soft inside.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I used whole wheat flour instead of ap flour, oil instead of shortening, and 3 T honey in place of the sugar.  They are relatively easy to make, and were loved by my family!  I'l be making these again!

Turned out AWESOME! I used 3 tsp yeast (4 1/2 is too much yeast) and let it proof with the sugar and water.   Followed step 2 exactly except I used 1 1/2 c milk (not 2c) in a kitchen aid mixer with bread hook attachment. Slowly added in the remaining 3c flour, and after that I spread flour on countertop to knead the dough.  I kept adding a little flour here and there while kneading to keep it from sticking to the counter, then I put the dough ball in a plastic tupperware bowl with seran wrap on top to rise (no need for oil if you use plastic bowl).  The dough was sticky but not unmanageable. After it rose I again beat the hell out of the dough on a floured countertop. After it was finished I didn't have time to bake it that day, so I put the spiral dough balls on parchment paper on a baking sheet in the fridge overnight. I did the baking soda hot water dipping right before baking, my rolls were pretty big so they took prob 25-30 min to bake (I kept checking on them). Absolutely awesome recipe, way better than store bought buns!!!

Pour yourself some AMAZING pretzel rolls! Yes, the dough is VERY sticky...I'd even say "pourable".  But don't let this discourage you. I made the dough in a food processor and used less than 5 cups of flour.  After looking at the dough with every flour addition I guessed that it was not going to come together in the "ball".  I made and educated guess to stop adding flour and pour in the bowl to rise.  It rose beautifully!  I dipped the measuring cup in flour and floured my hands too before rolling it out.  I heated the water and processed the "buns" like baking bagels...not just a quick dip.  These came out perfect...my kids gobbled them up and requested the rolls for their lunchboxes!  I am glad I used less flour and mixing because more would have yielded tough rolls.  I made larger rolls (that had to be cut in half...they were more like mini-loaves) but next time I will make them smaller (like hamburger/slider size).  You can shape the rolls...just take your time and keep your hands/counter floured.  Mine were tied in cool knots!  This recipe is a keeper!  Thank you "Brittsky"!!!...my kids thank you too!

I realized after doing all the mixing that there were no instructions to add the yeast mixture to the flour/wet ingredients...or when.  I'm surprised no one else had that issue.  I read and reread the instructions and I just don't see it!  Nevertheless, I added it at the end and the buns came out beautiful.  
A couple of comments:   6" log isn't really long enough.  I would say 8-10" if you want to do any type of spiral.
"Dipping" the buns into the water & baking soda is not as easy as it seems if you want to keep the spiral shape.  I used a perforated spatula, but think any spatula would work.  Some of the buns had to be reshaped after their bath.  I made each bun 4 oz. each and they doubled in size while baking and were a healthy size when done.  Nothing was said about what to bake these on.  I used parchment paper and it worked well.

The measurements seemed off in this one. I combined this and the Mall Pretzels recipe from this site to create my own and they turned out perfectly!

This dough is sooo sticky! Impossible to shape as written. Would need much more flour. I now have it baking in a loaf pan. Not much hope for an edible product.... I am an experienced baker.... One star, only because required.

Instead of just dipping in the soda and water solution, boil 4 cups of water in large pot then add soda (it will bubble up) turn down heat so it is simmering. Place the buns one at a time in for  40 seconds maximum. Then put on baking sheet and brush with butter and add salt.

these were not at all what I expected. My husband said he relaly liked them - my kids liked them, too. But as soon as I asked if they tasted like pretzels, everyone agreed they never would have made the connection (even though there was pretzel salt on top). They tasted NOTHING like pretzels. The were still good rolls, but I can't get past what I was expecting them to taste like... I'm very disappointed. I followed recipe - with exception of the milk, I followed a reviewer's suggestion to cut it down to 1 3/4 cups.

This just didn't turn out well at all!!!!  I read the others' comments and thought I'd give it a try.  The batter was definitely "pourable"...so much so that I couldn't shape into balls at all.  I ended up scooping up a spoonful of "dough", dipping it in the baking soda mixture and dumping into a cupcake pan.  They didn't even taste like a yeast bread - my husband thought they tasted like biscuits.  Way too much effort for such a sub-par result.

These make very nice rolls with a fine crumb and good flavor.  I mix and knead the dough in an electric mixer.  Like any yeast bread the "6 cups" of flour is an estimate, but do not add too much flour or the rolls will be dry. I recommend them especially as a roll for a cheese steak sandwich.

Other than reducing the milk by 1/4 cup, I followed the recipe as written.  The dough was impossible to handle, but I kept going, thinking that the buns would be really tender.  But in the end these just didn't taste much like pretzels and we didn't enjoy them.

A Vegan Alternative - and it's perfect!
I read all the reviews to check for problems and alternatives.  I am a vegan, so I used 2 tsp flax seed, ground, with 3 Tbs water for the eggs.  I used soy milk for the milk.  Also, in my recipe I used 3 tsp yeast, 2 1/2 cups wheat flour, 2 1/2 cups all purpose flour, and oil instead of shortening.  
The dough was not sticky!  And the buns came out perfect!  They are soft in the inside, and nicely tanned on the outside with a little crunch.   I will use this for all my bread recipes in the future.

These are without a doubt the most tasty pretzel bun I have ever made.  We used them for sloppy joes, burgers, sandwiches and just to eat plain. 

The second time I made these I cut the recipe in half and made soft bread sticks for an Italian supper and the family loved them.  Brushed them with butter, herbs and parmesan cheese before baking.  Freezes well.

Like this recipe, I will make smaller rolls next time, and coat with banking soda 3 times instead of one before the butter. Seems that people had problems with the stickiness, I just kneaded flour into the dough as needed and they still turned out well.

My 13 year old son is getting into baking, this recipe was easy for him to follow, and the finished product was yummy! Crispy and salty on the outside, moist and tender on the inside. He plans to make this again for our next family get together.

Discovered too late that my milk had expired so I used water. I added the full 2 cups and an extra half-cup of flour. The dough needed just a touch of flour when rolling into the "snakes". Baked up beautifully!! Will be making this again :)

The dough was a little sticky. Next time I will use less milk. I couldn't get them to roll out into ropes so I braided them. Came out beautiful and taste amazing!!!

This  recipe I made in Foods Class yesterday and it seemed like a great idea. We made it and in the end I ended up leaving so I'm not sure what they turned out to look like but they look strange. Either out buns were switched out for a different kind or not, we don't know. They were really sticky

I used half the dough to dip in the baking soda solution and used the other half and just brushed with garlic butter. the ones that I "pretzeled" got flakey and strange on top; I'm not quite sure what went wrong there, but the ones I turned into garlic buns turned out amazing so I'll definitely keep this recipe but just for regular buns.

Excellent recipe.  Just for fun, instead of making rolls as described, I pulled of chunks of dough, rolled them flat, added a tiny mound of sausage, cheese and chili sauce, and then gathered up the corners and pinching them to make a stuffed roll.  I used ham and cheese for some others.  They were excellent and a big hit.

This  recipe is awesome. I used my dough hook to mix the first three cups of flour. i then used my good old wooden spoon to mix in the last three cups. I found i needed 6.75 cups, but it tastes awesome. thanks for sharing.

This is an awesome recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly as written and my buns turned out perfectly.  I did not have to "pour" the dough as some other reviewers have stated.  The dough was somewhat sticky during the kneading process, but after the rise, it was a perfect consistency.  The end product was EXACTLY what I was looking for!  My batch yielded 19 buns.  Thanks so much for sharing this keeper recipe, Brittskydoodlepoodlepie!

Made these just as the recipe stated and they turned out perfect!!  The kids are in LOVE with them!  Yes, the dough is sticky which the recipe said it would be.  No biggy!!  Just added more flour on the countertop when I rolled them.

The buns taste amazing, but they did not come out as dark as the pictures suggest even cooking for 25 minutes. Next time I will try for longer.

Typical bun recipe.  I wish I'd used a different recipe that didn't have the salt.  I used the buns for philly cheesesteak sandwiches and it made them a little too salty and I didn't even use the baking soda. I didn't look at the amount closely and I wasn't about to waste 1/2 cup of baking soda on buns.  Instead I brushed the bread with egg before salting it.  I only used half of the buns, now I don't know what to do with the rest of them, my family didn't like the salted tops.

Only issue I have is that I end up adding a 7th cup of flour as the dough is too sticky with only 6 cups. Maybe next time I’ll reduce the amount of milk.

DOUGH: I made it in the KitchenAid mixer. Many reviews said it was sticky - and I agree. Most reviewers suggest decreasing the milk by 1/4 - 1/2 cup. Instead, I added an extra 1/2 cup of flour and it was perfect!
RISING: My husband was cooking on the barbeque while I was making this, so when the barbeque was turned off, I placed the glass dish of dough on top of the lid, and it rose in about half an hour.
FORMATION: Rolling the dough into snakes and shaping them seemed like a lot of extra effort. I instead just formed balls. In a 9x13 baking dish, I put 8 buns and in a 7x11 baking dish I put 6 - so a total of 14 buns. I cut an X into the top, rubbed the tops with softened butter, and sprinkled with sesame seeds and kosher salt.
FUTURE: It's a very simple recipe and could be adapted to many unique ideas. With a few tweaks, I can easily see this as dinner rolls, hot dog buns, sandwich buns, etc etc. Although I still don't understand the baking soda dip.

Amazing buns but the size was a tad too large for what I was expecting. Went from looking like buns to bread loaves. Next time would halve the size told in the recipe.

These turned out so much better than expected! They are the perfect size for hamburger buns. I followed the recipe as written and would not change a thing. More than one of us looked at our burger and where trying to figure out how to fit it into our mouths. I felt like I was in the restaurant!

Delicious!  Great straight out of he oven. I used a food processor, decreased the milk to 1 3/4 cup as others suggested. I used the rapid rise method so put yeast with 3 cups flour, salt, and sugar.  I heated the water and milk, melted the shortening in that and added to the dry mixture. Beat in the eggs and then gradually added the rest of the flour. Kneeled by hand just to form a smooth ball to let rise.

To deal with the stickiness i added rolled oats while kneading untill the dough felt right. Best recipe ever! I drizzled some of the buttered buns with coarse salt and pepper before they went in the oven and they were a big hit.

As the reviews suggested I reduced the amount of milk. My dough was perfect! Finished buns were tasty and fluffy. Only thing I will change is to not roll into spirals. Mine puffed up wonderfully but became very misshapen and wouldn't have been usable for burger buns. But I will be making these again!

Wonderful recipe.  The dough is so flavourful it doesn't even need salt.  I found the dough to be very wet however and ended up kneading 1/2-3/4 cup more flour into it.

These were quite delicious and fairly easy to make.  The dough was very sticky, so I just kneaded it in my kitchen aid for about 5-7 minutes.  I might try halving the sugar next time.  I prefer pretzels rolls a little less sweet.

This recipe is fantastic.  I followed it to the letter and didn't change a thing because nothing needs changing.  I was able to mix and knead all the ingredients in the Kitchenaid and the dough turned out beautifully.  I weigh the dough and divided it evenly into 12 buns and they are big and light and fluffy.  We used them for pulled pork and coleslaw sandwiches and the buns held up nicely, they didn't get soggy or fall apart. Definitely recommend this recipe.

My first time ever baking bread. I just used a lot of flour when kneading to keep it from sticking,  and they turned out great!
