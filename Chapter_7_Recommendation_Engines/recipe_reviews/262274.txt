Fresh and complete ingredients would be best  but I was limited by my pantry . I followed the directions, but I had to make substitutions . I has no green chilies.  This changed the taste significantly.  I used 1 teaspoon of mild chili powder instead. I also put a big pinch of sweet curry powder. I had no ginger root, so I used powdered ginger. No cardamom pods, so I used powdered cardamom.   I had no nuts to grind, so I didn't add any. I had all the other spices. I  used chicken tenders instead of thighs. The chicken turned out tender and juicy. This is a very forgiving recipe. It didn't taste like the korma we get at the Indian restaurant,  but it was still delicious.  My family voted 5 stars!

Added broccoli and cilantro for the last few minutes.  Good spice combination.
