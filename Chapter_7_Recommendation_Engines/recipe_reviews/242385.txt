Tuffy Stone knows his ribs. Tasty concoction of spices bring pleasure to your taste buds. I smoke my ribs and wrap foil as he does, only difference is I add 2 TBSP Apple juice to ribs in foil to increase the moisture content which make the ribs 'fall off the bond's tender. Either way I'm sure you're going to be impressed!

it was very crispy and delicious,  takes time to grill a big piece of quality meat like this , but totally worth the wait, next time I will add less salt, for my taste was a little salty overall a keeper

The ribs were good, good meat by SmithField. The flavors were good however, the amount of salt the recipe called for was extremely overpowering. I checked it two and three times to make sure I read that right. For me, next time I will only do about a quarter of the amount. Otherwise, good recipe.

We really enjoyed these. I halved the rub and quartered the salt as my rib was on the smaller side. Baked in the oven at 275 for 3 hours wrapped in foil and a bit of beer. Finished off on the grill with the bbq sauce. Fall off the bone tender and very flavorful.

These were good ribs with a somewhat different flavor due to the cinnamon and cloves.  While I liked them, my personal preference is for a less sweet rib.  Thanks for sharing this recipe,  Smithfield!

Yum!!! Really tasty, but it made way too much for two racks of St. Louis ribs. Not sure if it would make it all the way to four, but definitely enough for a third. We baked in foil packets for 3 hours at 275, then finished on the grill a few minutes on each side to get the char we like. This method made it easy to enjoy our 4th of July in the garden without monitoring the grill temp for hours.

Made these ribs along with another recipe by Smithfield at the same time. While I preferred these, my hubby preferred the others. I followed the recipe ingredients as stated but changed up the cooking method. We put the smoker to the test on these rib recipes for the first time. I smoked the ribs for 2 hours at 225 degrees, removed and covered in foil after adding BBQ sauce, cooked for 2-1/2 to 3 more hours, removed from foil, added more BBQ sauce and stuck back in smoker for about 1/2 hour. These were tender but not the fall-off-the-bone tender we like. While I'm sure the grill method is awesome, we loved the smoker. We will use the 3-2-1 smoking method suggested to me by LilSnoo next time - heard it's perfect every time.

This did not year good at all. Tried it twice in the smoker. And add others noted, way too much salt. So I tried again with a table spoon of salt. Still no good.

Did this yesterday on my BGE turned out great, HOWEVER what's with the salt??
I used maybe a tablespoon per rack and that was too much for us I'd suggest you probably meant tablespoon in your instructions instead of cup next time I make this will use a teaspoon per rack and not more especially when using kosher salt using normal salt you can use a bit more maybe...

This was a very good recipe.  I'm not a big rib eater, but did enjoy this one slathered with bbq sauce.  I used baby back ribs from Smithfield, and they turned out very, very tender.  My husband went crazy for them, and I liked that not too many ingredients were required.  I wouldn't hesitate to serve these to company.

I made these with baby back ribs and they were amazing!  Loved the flavor, and they were so tender. Definitely will make them again - they were easy to make and are a real keeper!

These ribs were very good.  I would cut back the amount of rub I put on next time for our families tastes. The ribs were tender and fell off the bone.

I have to admit I'm not much of a griller ... These came out good but it was a lot of work & time involved. I cut the salt to 1/4 cup & followed the rest as is. I liked the hickory smoke flavor. I'll leave the grilling to the hubby.

My entire family loved the ribs! The flavor of the rub was the perfect combination of sweet & salty (although I only used two tablespoons of salt instead of the 1/2 cup the recipe calls for). The meat was so tender and fell of the bones. Will definitely make these again, as they were so easy to make!

This rub was very interesting. I liked it, but my husband, not so much. The cloves & cinnamon on ribs just wasn't his thing. 
I liked the spicy/sweet combo and the smokiness of the flavor.

I did not care for the rub. It made these really salty.
