Made this recipe and turned out really well. I made a second batch using other reviewers suggestions; I exchanged a cup of the white sugar with a cup of brown sugar, and added my own spice mixture blend. The second batch was even deeper in color and stronger in spices then the first batch. I will stick to the second method. Also, let this sit and cool overnight. Next moring put the glass pint jars in freezer. Be sure and leave 1/2'' headspace in jar for expansion, Or freeze in plastic containers. Family LOVED this! Thank you for recipe.

Wonderful pumpkin-pie flavor, my family loved it. I didn't get 2 quarts, but I will make it again.

I subbed 1 cup of white sugar with brown sugar, as other reviewers suggested, and I further reduced the white sugar by a cup (so, 2 1/2 cups white, 1 cup brown).  I probably used more pumpkin pie spice, using my own blend, so I'd guess I used an extra two teaspoonfuls.  Came out really nice - maybe a bit looser than I was expecting, perhaps due to my reducing the sugar, but that's fine.  That extra cup of sugar might have made this too sweet for me, so I'm thrilled with my results. Thanks, Bea!

This was my first taste of pumpkin butter.  I made it for Pumpkin Apple Cobbler from this site.  I used fresh pumpkin (roasted at 400 degrees for 35 min, then run through the food processor, then the blender, and strained through cheesecloth), because everyone seems to be out of canned pumpkin.  Well worth the time it took, as well as the pumpkin-covered kitchen!  Tastes AMAZING!

Good base flavor, and great concept, but definately way too sweet for my taste. I have shared jars with other people, and they don't mind how sweet it is, so maybe it is just my taste, but I will make it again with a few changes :)

I halved the recipe and it came out waaay too sweet. I would suggest decreasing the sugar by 1/4 cup and replace another 1/4 cup with brown sugar for a deeper taste. I usually eat my pumpkin butter with either sunbutter or Tofutti vegan cream cheese on toast. This recipe definitely hit the spot!

Love this! Can't wait to share it with others as gifts.  Followed directions exactly, except as others did, swapped out one cup of the white sugar for one cup of br. sugar. It is sweet and full of pumpkin flavor.

Made this for Thanksgiving gifts. It's WONDERFUL. I used 3 cups white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar and added about 1/4 cup Amaretto, which really set off the flavor.

I love the idea of this, but it is way too sweet.  I cut back on the sugar and it was still to sweet.  Next time I will cut the sugar in half.

This is a great gift idea... made a few batches for my baby shower favors :) I followed the suggestions from the other reviewers (2 1/2 cups white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar, extra 1/2 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice) and my pectin said to boil for 2 minutes, so I boiled the mix an additional minute. The consistency was perfect and the flavor was fantastic!! Definitely a keeper!

Loved this recipe.  I do a lot of custom baking for my friends and family, and had never heard of pumpkin butter.  I will make this one over and over.  Everyone knew apple butter but said they would be defiantly order this from me for the Holidays!!

This is so yummy!  One of the best items I have ever preserved.   I did as others suggested and used 1 cup of brown sugar and then just 2 cups of white sugar, total 3 cups.  It is still very sweet.  I will definitely make this again.
I also used my own pumpkins that grew out of my compost pile as a surprise from throwing pumpkins seeds in the compost pile last October.  Those seeds came from someone else's home-grown pumpkins.

This is absolutely delicious. I took the advice of the reviewers and cut the sugar down to about 3 cups white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. I also added in half a can more of pumpkin and about 1/4 cup of homemade applesauce. It is so tasty!

This is a 4-star with the suggestions from others. I used a garden fresh pie pumpkin, boiled the flesh until tender and whipped it with a hand blender. I used 1 cup of Splenda brown sugar blend and 2/3 cup of regular Splenda and it is plenty sweet with a nice spicy flavor. I also boiled it longer for a thicker consistency. Yum!

Does Pumpkin Butter have to be refrigerated after canning, or can it have a shelf life? Just getting into the adventures of canning and want to make this today.

This did not make 2 quarts. More like 2.5 pints. I only used 3.5 cups of sugar, as I don't like it as sweet. Also added more pumpkin pie spice.

I made this recipe and found it to be very bitter and way to sweet. I plan to cute down the sugar but I don't know why it was so bitter. Could it be the pectin? maybe I didn't buy the right thing.

I was in the mood to make use of the Jack O Lantern into a recipe. Instead of tossing it away, I made them for family and friends to give as gifts for the holidays and they turned out good. I added cloves and cinnamon for more flavor.

Delicious! I'd never had Pumpkin Butter before and it's quite tasty. I followed the recipe but substituted gelatin for the pectin (I was certain that was a box of Sure Jell!): I don't think it made difference. The texture is like apple butter and easily spreadable.

This was one was a great recipe!  I've made it a few times and typically use the same amount of sugar, but 1/2 white & 1/2 brown for a richer color.  By far one of my favorites :)
