Melted chocolate on an uncooked tortilla is a bit of a mess. I thought this recipe might be better with fewer chocolate chips toasted between the tortilla. It was still a 2-step process: I put 2 tablespoons chocolate chips on 1/2 of a tortilla and folded the other half down. Then I toasted it on both sides in a skillet on medium heat. The chocolate was nicely melted, but not oozing out, and the tortilla was slightly crisp from being toasted. It was much better this way; however, melted chocolate on a tortilla tastes just like a waste of chocolate to me. Someone out there might really like the taste though, and I would suggest toasting it like a quesadilla instead of following the directions in this recipe.
