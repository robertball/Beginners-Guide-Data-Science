In theory these looked great, so I disregarded the previous reviews.  But this recipe does not work.  The first batch was so thin I basically baked orange poppyseed paper, not cookies.  (I made no variations.)  So I added flour, which made them hard and tasteless.  Furthermore, a chocolate button is a large chocolate chip, which looks really stupid in the middle of a cookie any larger than a quarter, and didn't help the flavor of the cookie anyway.  This is the first recipe on this site that has failed me, but it failed miserably.  Sorry.  I really wanted to like it.
