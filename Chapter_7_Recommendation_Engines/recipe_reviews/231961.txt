With ripe bananas and a desire to try out a new recipe, I decided to give this one a chance. Having made many loaves of banana bread through the years, the ingredients seemed pretty straight forward.  The use of a mixer is definitely not needed. This came out fluffy, moist and golden in an hour. The only thing I would do next time is add some cinnamon and nutmeg for flavor and aroma.

I cut this recipe in half. It calls for more bananas than most recipes and the result is a great banana flavor. I used four medium sized ripe bananas. I also added some pumpkin pie spice and half walnuts, half pecans. It turned out great. The batter seems a little wet, but the result was a moist texture even though I had to bake it the full 75 minutes.

I took the other review's advice and added a teaspoon of nutmeg & cinnamon.  It was perfection!  The batter made 2 dz muffins and a loaf.

Nope, all the P's accross the board. Practically perfect in every way. It's almost like Marry Poppins made it herself.  Thank you Double Banana Nut. ??

I made this recipe last week and my whole family loved it! It was the best banana nut bread I have had! It was moist and yummy! I used 5 ripe bananas and pecans instead of walnuts. I made one large loaf and 4 small loaves to share with friends. I am waiting for my new bananas to ripen so I can make it again!

This is a great recipe!  I love that it has more bananas than you usually see in other recipes.  I baked mine in mini loaves to give out at the holidaysâ€¦.I got about 10 out of it (last one was a bit smaller).  I am definitely going to use this recipe from now on.  The only downfall is all the bowls and dishes I dirtied, but it's worth it for this awesome bread!

I made this recipe and it was good but a bit too sweet for me.  I make banana bread often and prefer the recipes that have a slight sweetness over the ones that are very sweet.  I would take out at least 1/4 cup of the sugar if I ever made this again. It does however look beautiful, exactly like the picture.

Great recipe! This was a big hit for Thanksgiving. So good I had several friends ask me to make this instead of giving them a Christmas present. I followed the recipe to the letter.

Prep time 20 minutes is a joke.   When finished it looked picture perfect but could not even taste the banana's.  They were ripe too.  
Sorry  I love and all receipes.com but this not one I will even think about again.  Merry Christmas to those these would have gone to.

One of the best I've made in a long time. I chose this recipe because of the reasonable ingredients ( had all of them in my pantry) I cut the recipe in half and added blue berries. It made a big loaf which lasted a week. It did take longer than 20 minutes but I don't rush when I bake; thats the fun of baking. Take your time.

I made this and it's absolutely delicious. I'm highly allergic to gluten so I made mine with gluten free flour. I used Bob's red Mill 1-1 baking flour and did the same exact thing it said except I added a little lactose free milk because I'm also lactose intolerant.  It turned out wonderful and absolutely delicious.

Instead of 1 1/3 c oil, I used 1 c applesauce and 1/3 c oil. I added 2 Tbs pumpkin pie spice. 
The bread is absolutely delicious, dense and moist. I will use this recipe again!

I love this recipe and it definitely works at high altitude here in Colorado.
I added a pinch of cinnamon, nutmeg and cardamom.
I also used half butter, half coconut oil instead of regular oil.
Finished by sprinkling some shredded coconut on top before baking and it toasted nicely.
It made 1 loaf and 8 good size muffins

I made this recipe using over ripe bananas and walnuts into 32 mini loaves. It was delicious!  Not really sweet but full of flavor. Next time I may add just a hint more sugar or let my bananas ripen another day or two to get a little sweeter.

Second review! I added about shy of 2 cups of pineapples and pineapple syrup (switched for lemon juice). My bananas were ripened and then frozen. So as they thawed they were super creamy! Advice- use a light colored pan. The darker the pan the darker the bottoms of muffins or breads are gonna be. So lighter pan is the way to go! Good luck!!

This was dry. I did make mini loaves but I adjusted the baking time accordingly. Even before they went in to bake I suspected it would be a bit dry based on the consistency of the batter. The flavour is nice, you just need a big jug of milk or similar while you are eating it. Sorry, but there are better banana bread recipes out there so I won't be using this one again.

I added some powdered cocoa. 
This is a very moist wonderful bread.

I just made this and am very disappointed, the bake time is way off, after 50min I took mine out of the 350 oven and it was over cooked and outside is burnt. I don't know what kind of oven the person used that posted this but it was not a regular oven. Will try again but will reduce the cooking time by half.
