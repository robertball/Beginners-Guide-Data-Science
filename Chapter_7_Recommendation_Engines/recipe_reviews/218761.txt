These were really good and a hit with my children. Essentially no mess and tastier than I thought!

This was so delicious and easy to make. I used hickory bbq sauce so it added a bit of sweetness to it. I used the dinner roles, but I couldn't make them like a triangle, but it was fun wrapping it up. Instead of using sesame seeds, I added TexMex seasoning and it had a little kick to it. Awesome recipe!

Although, super simple...I would not make these again. Not a hit at my house.
