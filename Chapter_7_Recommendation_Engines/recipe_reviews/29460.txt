This was the best Salmon I have ever eaten! A+++ We ended up marinating for about 5 hours and its winter in WI so we baked it for about 15-20 min. This is one for the Recipe Box.

Delicious!  I recommend marinating overnight, though.  I was also hoping the glaze would be a little thicker, like I've had in the restaurant.  Perhaps next time I'll brush on more honey in the end. This is a keeper!

This is an excellent marinade, which I think would taste good on chicken or beef, as well as salmon.  I ended up using a red onion instead of green onion (didn't have green onion on hand).  I added some fresh garlic and fresh ginger, I think this is important actually.  And then I marinated for a few hours in a dish (turning salmon around once, so that all parts got some marinating time).  And as for flavor, I think it is VERY important to take the leftover marinade and boil/reduce it in a small pan, and put the marinade on as a sauce on top of the salmon when eating.  The marinade is very very flavorful, and you need to eat it on top as a sauce, to really taste it well on the salmon.  I will definitely be doing this more often.  Oh, and I used a boneless fillet of salmon, grilling 10 minutes (5  minutes per side) on medium/high heat.  Delicious, thank you for the recipe!

Amazing! My roommate & I have used it on tilapia & flank steak also. I'm sure it would taste great with any seafood or meat-- even veggies. We skip the orange juice and always use fresh ginger & fresh garlic and add a little extra honey.

I used this marinate just the way it is presented; it was simple and very good.  I cooked the fillet on a cedar plank on a grill, adding just a hint of smoke flavor.  This one is a keeper.

Salmon was moist and juicy, baked it instead of grilled but still the result was pleasant a nice sweet flavor but the ginger flavor was lost in the sweetness, I recommend more ginger be added.

So good! I baked at 425 for 20 minutes then broiled for 5. Fantastic. Would pay money to eat that and then go brag to my friends about the wonderful meal I had.

We let this marinade overnight, using red onion instead of the green, and it turned out superb!  Has already become a favorite in our house!!

Very tasty marinade. I used fresh grated ginger, squeezed a navel orange, increased the honey a little (eyeball), and added one garlic clove, minced. I marinated this sauce in the salmon for 8 hours. Because this meal was for two people I decided to baked this in the oven in a sealed aluminum foil. I drizzled a little marinade over the salmon and baked it at 400 degree for 15-20 minutes.  The results were a flaky, delicately tender salmon. I could taste the ginger which I love and also the honey. I am glad I increased the honey in the marinade.  However, I think next time I will thicken up the sauce and/or brush a little honey to the top of the salmon. I served this with hot brown rice and "Bacon-y Bok Choy" (also from this website). A perfectly delicious meal and another recipe to add to my recipe box!

It's very good, but next time I will let the salmon soak in the marinade for even longer.  I plank grilled it (yum) for even more flavor.  Leftovers went on a caesar salad the next day--v. good.

This would have been 5 stars for sure if it hadn't burst into flames the second I put it on the grill! LOL  It was very "chargrilled", but the meat we could salvage was incredibly tasty!  Next time, I will preheat the grill, but then let it cool a bit before putting salmon on and I won't be popping back in the house!

It wasn't what I was expecting. I think the soy dried the fish out and made it too salty. I even used the reduced sodium sauce.

DELICIOUS!!! My hubbie & kids didn't give me a "10" for dinner they gave me a "12"!! I doubled the recipe for the marinade & kept warm on the stove & drizzled over the salmon right before serving. Served with fresh brocolli & whole wheat couscous. Thanks for the recipe!!

Very good. I followed the recipe exactly except I simmered the left over marinade with cornstarch and used that as a baste to glaze my salmon while grilling. Excellent. Has a taste similar to salmon teriyaki.

This was a great basic recipe, and very flexible. I didn't measure everything carefully, and added a little olive oil to the marinade as well.  I also cooked my salmon under the broiler instead of grilling.  My tip: If you would like a delicious glaze to drizzle over the cooked salmon, don't discard the marinade, but pour it into a pan. Bring to a boil on the stove, and cook until the sauce is reduced to the thickness you desire. Yum!

This was so good!  The kids loved it oo.  I did, however, substitute the honey with Brown sugar and I'm so glad I did.  I think the honey I had would have given it too much of a floraly note.

I loved the sweet and salty combo of this sauce! I was Major jonesing for salmon and the family Devoured this dish! I did not marinade the fish but grilled the fish for a few minutes and basted the fish till it was done. I brushed on a final coat before serving. Excellent! Thanks a heap Kerri.

I made this recipe for Memorial Day with a few friends. My only deviation was I marinated the salmon for an hour and it came out awesome! Everyone loved it! We thought it was the perfect blend of flavors and did not over power the salmon. Very easy and quick to prepare and will definitely make this again.

Just made it this evening for my "honey" and I!  HAPPY V-DAY...  Well he LOVED it, and I must say do did I; I will definitely be keeping this recipe on hand *wink*  Only things that I changed were the time I let it marinate (5hrs), soy sauce- I only had available half of the soy sauce, so I added in to finish off the other half a stir fry sauce that I had on hand *shrugs* it was a little thicker in consistency but it did the job, also I didn't grill it I slowly baked it on 350 for like 15min(continuously checking on it).  Next time I make this I want to definitely try and grill it, I know it's got to be just as good!!  Thanks again for sharing...

Delucious!! I let it marinade for 1-1/2 hours then cooked it in my Nuwave oven, on 4" rack 5 minutes each side.   Next time I will try marinading it all night.  Thanks for sharing.   Definite keeper.   Was perfect in salads the first time around.

I was a bit disappointed with this - it sounded like lots of people loved this combi but the flavour was a little flat for me, the soy sauce a little too overpowering and it tasted very blah. Will venture over to other salmon recipes next time...

This was the best salmon I have ever had. My girlfriend and I loved it! Definitely cook down the marinade to make a sauce. It added so much flavor! We grilled on a cedar plank because our grocers seafood guy suggested it. I would not change this recipe otherwise!

I have been making this salmon for my family for a while now.  I follow the recipe more or less.  I use fresh garlic and ginger when I have it. If I don't have the green onion I'll either omit it, or just use regular onion.  The recipe says to marinade the fish for 15-30 minutes. I found that it needs at least an hour for the fish to remain super moist!  I don't have a  BBQ, so I use a cast iron skillet to cook the fish and it turns out wonderful.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

My family loves this!  Even my picky daughter who hates fish.  The flavors of sweet and spicy blend so well.  Weather didn't permit grilling so I baked the salmon at 375 degrees for about 20-25 minutes.  I can't wait to try this outside on the grill.

Probably tastes better on a grill, but it turned out wonderful in my oven! Perfect blend of flavors.

Absolutely delicious.  The marinade goes perfectly with the salmon.  I think this would also be good on chicken.

This was a big hit with my family. I marinated the fish for longer. I doubled the marinade, and before I started cooking the fish, I transferred it to a pot and boiled it down for a thicker sauce.  This recipe is a keeper.

Loved the flavor combinations in this recipe! I used chopped garlic instead of the powder because that is what I had on hand. The salmon was beautifully caramelized and I think the honey helped the green onions and garlic stick to the fish, which was both pretty and delicious. I think if I marinade it for longer next time I might just bump it up to 5 stars. Thank you for the recipe!

I liked this a lot and my husband who really doesn't like fish said he liked this recipe the best out of the salmon I have made before.  I used the marinade recipe as written with just a little more green onion (I used about 1 1/2 of them) that I wanted to use up.  I also marinated this for 8 hours and baked in the oven at 375 for 16 minutes because it is too cold to grill right now.  The orange and honey flavors really came through nicely and the ginger was not very prominent, but I did not have a problem with that.

Marinated for about 10 minutes.  Lightly marinated slices of zuchinni and grilled all on a foreman grill fo approximately 10 minutes; 5 on each side.  The salmon had a nice mild flavor.  Very good.

I love this salmon recipe.  It’s very easy, but very good!  Both times I made this recipe; I used it in a salad.  The salad was mixed greens, mandarin oranges, Chinese noodles, and Newman’s Own Ginger Dressing.  Awesome!  The second time I made it, I realized I didn’t have ginger so I used nutmeg.  This is one of my favorite salmon recipes!

This was so good!!! I accidentally left out the honey and realized it when I came to review. Oops! I did add red pepper flakes, we like spice. My fish marinated for an hour. I grilled approx 4 minutes on each side on the indoor grill. I kept spooning the marinade over the fish as it cooked. This is a keeper for us!!

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could. I poked the fish with a fork to enhance the marinade and baked the fish at 475 degrees. The salmon tastes better than it looks, so I decided to turn some marinade into a glaze to pour on the fish when I took it out of the oven.  I made about 1/3 more of the marinade and reserved it for the glaze. I added about 1/4 tsp of cornstarch to a couple of tablespoons of the marinade to blend it, then added the cornstarch mixture to the rest of the marinade which I was boiling in a saucepan. It was the best fish I have ever tasted -- not a drop was left over.

I would not change a thing BUT to double the amount!  My kids licked their plates clean!  We did marinate the salmon for about 2-3 hours prior to grilling.  My husband sprayed the grill so that the fish would not stick.  This is a healthy, delicious, and fast meal!

My family loves this recipe! I marinate Salmon fillets in this mixture and then broil them, leaving a little of the marinade on the fish. It carmelises and tasest wonderful. I also use orange-tangerine juice.

This was absolutely delicious!  We had an early father's day celebration, and my dad loves salmon.  He RAVED!  I prepared the marinade exactly as written, and hubby grilled to perfection.  Moist & flavorful.   Thanks for sharing this simple and delicious recipe, Kerri.

used pineapple juice in place of the orange juice   and dried chives in place of the green onions because that's what I had.  Marinated it for 20 minutes, then baked at 400 in the  marinade.

Very delicious! I make it all the time. Make sure not to marinate the salmon for too long, or it gets too salty and such. 15 min - 30 min is just perfect!

I didn't have any orange juice so I skipped that ingredient and used freshly grated ginger instead of the ground powder, cutting the amount in half to account for the intensity of flavor. I also broiled it in the oven on low for about 12 minutes which kept the flesh super moist and created a crunchy glaze on top (closest to the heating element). It turned out so well!!! Definitely a keeper recipe.

Pretty good. I marinated for an hour. Since I've tasted it being salty the first time I made it, I now add only 1/4 soy sauce. I also want to try adding more honey next time.

The sauce was delicious.  It made the salmon juicy and soft.  I cooked mine in over in a casserole dish covered in foil

Like others, I used fresh garlic and fresh ginger in my marinade, and I increased both so they would be tasted over the honey. I also increased the honey a little and let the fish sit in the marinade over night. I baked the salmon instead of grilling it, and I reduced the left over marinade and used it as a glaze when the fish was done. It was superb. I will definitely make this again.

Needed to add more ginger next time! I didn't have an outdoor grill so I pan-fried the salmon instead....because of the soy sauce and honey the skin was a little overdone. Still tasted great though. Next time I'll remember to turn the heat down.

Before making this, the most I ever cooked was making fried rice with everything already prepared. I made this from scratch and it is absolutely delicious. I followed most of the recipe, except for ground ginger and garlic powder. I used fresh ginger and garlic and minced them. My family loved this recipe, I was a little eh about the orange juice but it came out perfectly. Would definitely make the same marinade for other things, like chicken and shrimp.

The only up side - The salmon came out super moist. I basically followed the recipe, only cutting back on the amount of soy sauce and using fresh garlic. Marinated it for over an hour, the taste just wasn't there. My kids love salmon, but only took half of their normal portion and struggled to finish even that. No sweet, salty or ginger flavor. In the end I had to add butter and salt for some flavor. We're quite disappointed.

I have made this recipe over and over again.  The only changes I have made - and these are based on my reading of the other reviews - is that I use fresh garlic instead of powdered garlic, I marinate for about two hours (or more if I have time), and I generally bake it in the oven with the marinade poured over it.  When I bake it, I cover the dish with foil, cook it at 400 and it is generally ready in about 25 minutes.  I have even accidentally overcooked it and the salmon was still moist and delicious.

Marvelous.  The marinade is sweet but enhances the taste of the fish without covering it up.  A last minute scheduling change caused me to marinade the salmon for 48 hours (instead of the 15 to 30 minutes the recipe calls for), and the flavors were still perfectly balanced.  Delicious and nutritious.

We also liked it just the way it is. I loved that I didn't even need to dirty a dish and put all of the ingredients straight into the bag. Tasty and delish...even my picky 4 year old gave it a try! Will definitely make again.

My absolute favorite salmon dish!  Very sweet and tangy tasting.  Marinate longer for better results.  Make sure to mix the marinade well as the honey tends to be finicky about mixing with the other ingredients.

The sauce was great but I think the cooking time was a bit off because the fish was a bit dry. Easy to make though!

I did omit the green onions because I didn't have any one hand.  Other than that exactly as called for.  WE loved it.  My 11 yr old and 3 yr old ate all there salmon and asked for seconds.  I did use an indoor grill.  Next time, I am going to add the onions and also as try fresh garlic and ginger and marinade it longer.  I will also boil down the marinade and use it as a sauce.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

I added more ginger as someone suggested. This was sort of lackluster. I agree, I was searching for something with more of a thicker orange glaze. I wouldn't make it again.

This is my favorite salmon marinade!  Simple - the ingredients are almost always on-hand, and incredibly delicious.  Whether you marinate for half an hour or overnight, it will not disappoint.  

If you are not going to grill OUTDOORS, then baking is definitely the way to go.  I used my indoor grill pan and the marinade charred and smoked something fierce.  :)

This is an excellent marinade.  I use it every time I cook salmon and it always turns out great.  The powders work well, but I prefer to use grated ginger and minced garlic.

Very good. I could hardly taste salmon (I don't usually like it). I baked it covered in the oven at 450F for 20 minutes then broiled for a few minutes. Will make again.

I made this yesterday w/o reading any reviews.  I used salmon steak about an inch thick and marinate it for about 20-25min; I would marinate it a bit longer next time though-due to the thickness of the fish.   My mom didn't want the marinate to go to waste and just in case the fish turns out dry, she made it into a sauce with corn starch, which turned out a bit too thick, so next time we'll just bring the marinate to a boil.   Also instead of using a bbq grill, I baked it for about 25 minutes at 400F in a conventional oven and the end result was great because the fish wasn't dry at all since I left some marinate in the pan.  Also, if you don't want the top of your fish to burn cover with aluminum foil. =)  I will definitely make this again, everyone enjoyed it! Thanks for the recipe!

I liked the marinade a lot but the suggested time I don't think is long enough. This should really be let to soak overnight in my opinion. I didn't think the fish retained much of the flavor after being cooked. Will make again and give it the time it needs!

Love it!  I did add fresh ginger and fresh garlic instead of powder and I broiled it instead of grilling but it was SPECTACULAR.  Served on top of a salad with a homemade dressing using all of the elements of the marinade.  YUMMY!

Yum! I marinated mine for 2 hours in the fridge (just because that's when I started cooking), and that seemed adequate marinating time to me. I used lots of fresh garlic and ginger. I also broiled the salmon rather than grilling it. Unfortunately, I left it to broil for 10 minutes and it came out a little burnt, so I'd be careful to keep a steady eye on the oven. Tastes great over brown rice, with a side of chopped sauteed kale!

This salmon was fantastic! We absolutely loved it! It probably was the best salmon we had in this site. I made fresh squeezed orange juice and marinated for 30 minutes. I will marinate longer next time.

This was good - I did use fresh garlic and ginger, and also salmon steaks. And while this is a four star 'make again recipe' - there are others on the site that are awesome, including Maple Salmon, Baked Dijon Salmon and Asian Salmon.

This was keeper!  I substituted tilapia for salmon and cooked it in a frying pan sprayed with non stick cooking spray. This marinade would also be great for chicken, beef or pork.

This was a GREAT recipe! I needed a quick and easy salmon dish for dinner and this one was ready in a flash. I had all the ingredients on hand and cooked them on my indoor grill. It turned out great. Even my sister who doesn't like salmon loved it. Thanks for this one! I'll never make salmon any other way ;)

We tried this recipe last nite for the first time and it was a HUGE hit!  I added a wee bit more ginger than called for and marinated the salmon a bit longer (due to a phone call holding us up).  The salmon had a wonderfully sweet, smoking flavor.  It was rated 5 stars by both adults and children.  The only thing I may try differently next time is to add crushed, fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder, and perhaps let it marinate even a wee bit longer.  Thank you for sharing a wonderful recipe that has now become part of our summer grilling rotation!

This is absolutely EXCELLENT ! I used Chum which is rather bland without much flavor and this Sauce gives it a hint of sweetness and a bit of Ginger zap. I served it with steamed rice and an assortment of grilled vegetable Kabobs. A certain winner, for sure !

Very tasty reminds us both of Chinese or Japanese sauce. I did a tiny bit changes I shredded fresh ginger instead of powder one and I added squashed garlic about 4 of them instead of garlic powder. I used low sodium soy sauce instead of regular one and grilled it on the indoor grill. I marinated my salmon with skin on for 5 and half hours. turned out very yummy and delicious.

Delicious! I marinated the salmon overnight, which I think was key because I’ve marinated salmon for 60 minutes in the past and it just didn’t have nearly this much flavor. Pan seared it skin side up for about 3 min, and then placed it in the oven to finish it off.? Perfecto!

Awesome !  Didn't make any changes to marinade recipe. Ended up marinating it for 1 hour.   Baked in the oven on a foil lined pan at 350° for 25 minutes, due to the 2 feet of snow outside.   Delicious!!!!   My husband loved it.  Will be making this again.  I might try the marinade on some chicken pieces.

Perfect- I baked at 350 for 15 minutes- then broiled for 4 - then let it sit on the stove top for 5 more. I plan to add more honey over the top next time.

It was wonderful, I didn’t have orange juice but I did have some lemons so I Used the juice of 2 lemons for the juice but everything else was Just So Very Good, Man Oh Man Was It Wonderful Thing To Do To Salmon, Really Really Good Oh I Almost Forgot I did not cook it in the BBQ, I have a grilled cast iron skillet that I sprayed with coconut oil spray and preheated it in the Oven Before Putting The Salmon On It and Grilled It In My Oven For The recommended Amount Of time then I Turned It onto it Skin side and let it cook another 5 minutes and it was beautiful??????

Definitely a 5 star recipe. I used low sodium and had no issues with the salt level personally. The skin will fry fast on the grill so watch it carefully. I let is marinate from breakfast to dinner, so 9 hours. The flavor is very light, so the salmon flavors still shine through. The end flavor I tasted was the light honey. Great recipe!!

Fresh ginger and garlic make the difference. Reduced the marinade and drizzled it over the salmon. Grilled multiple veggies and huckleberry potatoes. Great drizzled on those too. Adding that to my recipe book. Mmmm!!!

Made the recipe twice exactly as it is written and it was phenomenal both times!  I baked it in the oven and loved how the marinade caramelized in the pan.  This one is in the recipe box as a family favorite!

This was a fantastic salmon recipe. I made this exactly as directed with one exception. I reserved some marinade and heated it to thicken. I brushed the salmon a few times during grilling which added a bit of a sweet coating. Served with grilled asparagus.

Outstanding and easy salmon. I broiled it for about 12 min and kept it moist by spooning some of the marinade over it several times. Served it over quinoa and asparagus for a simple but delicious and healthy meal. Thanks for a great recipe.                                                                                CO Karen

So good and elegant!  I made this for my vegetarian friend and she loved it. I served over a wheat berry and kale salad with lemon vinaigrette.  Prepping fish and salad in advance meant I only needed to BBQ fish and serve while she was visiting so I had more time to hang out with her while enjoying this lovely meal with a nice glass of sauvignon blanc on the patio. Thanks for sharing!!

I plan to make it again. I did make a few adjustments, like I added a sprig of rosemary to the marinade. I also used fresh ginger too. For me it didn't have that distinctive ginger/honey flavor I was looking for, which was probably due to the rosemary? Anyway, it was good nonetheless.

this was delicious!  I did not have enough honey so I substituted Light Maple Syrup and I think the maple flavor really added to it.  Like others, I cooked in oven due to weather but it turned out perfectly.  Will definitely do again!

I didn't care for this at all.  Marinated for about an hour, didn't have a plastic bag, so poured it on top of the salmon, then flipped the filet over to marinate in the overflow.  Also poured on the rest when put on the grill.  I thought that the soy sauce overpowered the flavor.  I don't want my expensive salmon filet to taste like I dipped it in soy sauce!  I think it would be better with less soy and add some brown sugar.  I won't make this again!  I just had some leftovers and it didn't taste nearly so soy saucy.  It was much better balanced, but still prefer other recipes better.

Loved this recipe!  I used fresh ginger, garlic and fresh squeezed OJ but kept the recipe the same otherwise.  Was only able to marinade about a half hour but still came out perfect.  Will def make this one again!

Marinated the salmon for 3-4 hrs then thicken the sauce on the stove and basted it while barbecuing. Followed the recipe exactly. It was excellent! I make a flat tin foil pan (like a mini cookie sheet) and grill filets with the skin down on the tin foil. Then when the fish is done it flakes right off the skin beautifully!

I left off the onions and substituted about 3 tablespoons maple syrup for the honey and it was phenomenal! The maple syrup gave it an amazing depth of flavor. My super picky husband loved it.

This had great flavor.  I cut back a little on the soy sauce as I am not a big salt lover.  This turned out to be just the right amount of sweet/salty.  I poached the salmon with some of the marinade and it turned out so tender and delicious.

I baked this according to the recommendations for 20 minutes at 425 degrees. I also added a little more honey. It turned out delicious! I put it over wild rice and served with mixed vegetables. This was a very tasty meal that was super quick and easy. I will be making this again :)

Made this last night on salmon and shrimp. The next time I make this I am going to alter by using fresh garlic and ginger instead of powder, I may throw in some fresh minced onion in addition to the green onion, but most defiantly I plan on adding red pepper flakes for a little heat.  This was a great base and can easily be altered according to taste.

I was surprised at how good the salmon tasted with this sauce that is so simple.  It was a hit at our dinner party even after my daughter dropped half on the floor bringing it in from the BBQ lol.  No leftovers!

I prepared this dish using 2x salmon 'mignon' (about 20 minutes per side on low-medium).  The glaze caramelized wonderfully, and provided a nice texture to balance the flakiness of the fish.

Started with 2.12 lbs of salmon fillet, freshly bought.   Used fresh grated ginger and fresh garlic. I broiled in my toaster oven for about 20 minutes.  Next time I will add more orange juice.

Made this to the recipe. Except I left out the green onions - love green onions but I had none. That would have really made this special. Also used fresh squeeze orange juice as I had too many oranges.

I did reduce the marinade for a  serving sauce and that turned out great; please consider doing that while the salmon is grilling, but it did want to boil over. Be careful or you'll have a lot of cleanup.

The sauce is very dark brown when reduced , and tastes way better than it looks.

Added a little brown sugar, because the marinade was too ginger-y. Baked at 425 for appr. 18 minutes, then broiled until nice and brown. I simmered the marinade until it thickened, and then poured it over the fish. Served with a salad, cheddar biscuits, and "cream corn like no other" from this site.

It was very nice! We loved thenseeet burst of flavors! Giving it 4 stars only because the 30min marinade did not do much for the fish! I had it marinaded for 3 hours before cooking it; even then the orange flavor was mild, but that can be because of the quality of the orange/juice. I do suggest a longer time for the flavors to soak in.

We love salmon and I am always looking for new ways to prepare it.   I marinated the salmon for about 30 minutes and thought the salmon did not have much flavor.   I would suggest marinating an hour to get more flavor from the sauce.   I also would not consider the sauce a glaze.  It was definitely thinner like a marinade.    I would try this again, but, would probably try saving some sauce to the side before marinating, thickening with some cornstarch, and basting during the last few minutes of grilling.

Fantastic! I used fresh garlic and ginger. I also add 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil and 1 teaspoon of chili garlic sauce to cut some of the sweetness. Our grill is currently out of commission so i baked it 20 min at 400 then broiled for another 5 min.  I followed other reviewers advice and reduced the left over marinade in a sauce pan until about halved then drizzled it over top the finished product and it made the flavor really pop.

This is delicious. We have made this many many times, it is one of our favorites. We have use the printed recipe as well as changing a few times by adding more orange juice or adding Teriyaki instead of soy sauce.  They have all turned out amazing.

I made this yesterday after marinating for 2 hours.  I used fresh ginger and fresh garlic, which I believe made it extra special.  The flavor was great!  I've never used fresh ginger, but plan to use it more often. I baked it for about 20 minutes in foil.  Then, broiled it for 5 minutes more.  It was perfect.  I served it with jasmine rice and fresh green beans.  I have leftovers for tonight..yay!

Great recipe! Made exactly as is, with the addition of a few extra scallions ( I had bought the bunch for this dish...) I baked it and served the extra marinade (after boiling and reducing) on the side-- a big hit with my family! Thank you for a quick but delicious recipe.

This made for a very nice dinner.  I did use fresh ginger and less soy sauce than called for.  I left it in the marinade for an hour, but I think it could have used even a little more time.  Next time I'll add a little garlic to the mix.  Thanks, Kerri Skrudland!

Didn't have time to marinate for more than an hour - so the lack of the 5th star is purely my fault. It was still delicious! If you have to bake it, save a little of the marinade for the last ten minutes, pour it over and broil it. Yum!

Amazing!! So simple and easy to make. We do not have a grill so broiling was the best option. Reduced the remaining marinade until it was thick and syrupy and coated the fish and let the broiler crisp it up a little more. Served it with Asparagus Bundles, Roasted Fingerling Potatoes and Cheddar Bay Biscuits. Let's just say someone was a hero that night!;-)

Being new  to making salmon I thought this recipe sounded good. Salmon is my daughters favorite.  This recipe  did not disappoint and it was some of the best salmon I've ever had (as it is not my favorite). I marinated 10 hours or so due to timing and this worked great and would do that again. I will defiantly use this recipe again in the future.  Other than marinating longer, I followed exactly.

Fantastic! I'm new to cooking salmon. When I saw that this recipe was pretty simple, I had to try it. Used everything except the green onions (just were not available to me) and it turned out spectacular! Definitely something I'll make again :)

It was perfect and moist. I marinated the salmon for 8 hours and the flavor was delicious and not overpowering at all. I have used this marinade several times and it never fails.

Made it exactly as the recipe the first time!  Outstanding!  2nd time, we made it exactly again, but took the marinade, put in a pan and added a little cornstarch and heated it up and used on top of the salmon and also on some rice to go with it.  Yummy!

I used a good tablespoon of fresh ginger and  and a fresh garlic clove and it turned very well. I served this with lemon risotto which was an excellent complement to the dish.

Nice! I always think that recipes calling to be marinated for such a short time will never make a difference and I am always wrong. I marinated for 20 minutes tops and the salmon had a wonderful flavour. I've never used orange juice on salmon before. It was great. We'll make this again! Thanks Kerri Skrudland

Yum! I didn't have orange juice so substituted about half the amount of lemon juice, and it's just as I hoped it would be. I love salmon but get tired of the same old brown sugar marinades so this was a welcome change of pace.

I really liked this. Made some minor changes to suit my taste. Used halibut ( hate salmon), used fresh ginger and garlic and put in a tinfoil boat on the grill. It was awesome! All the flavours worked really well, next time may add more honey.

My family follows a more traditional diet (95% meat and veggies, as fresh as possible), so we need a lot of different ways to make any one item. We found this and though I am not fond of soy at all, tried it out. It was delicious! The first time we made it we followed the directions exaclty, with the exception of green onions. Left those out. Everyone loved it and the 5 year old wanted seconds. The next time or two we had it, I do not remember using OJ at all. It was still yummy. We marinated the fish for a little while, and reserved a little aside for last minute basting in the oven.

I substituted garlic powder for fresh garlic finely chopped. I also substituted green onion for red onion finely chopped. Lastly, I substituted ground ginger for larger chunks of crushed ginger since I love ginger. Very good recipe. Hats off to the author of this recipe!

My boyfriend made this for me and it was delicious. One thing the recipe doesn't explain is how to actually grill it. For the best flavor you should put the salmon on a heated grill flesh side down to sear it for about 2-4 minutes. Then flip it over and cook it skin side down for the remaining part until done. The fat (or whatever it is) between the skin and the fish will melt and you will not have that fishy taste that I don't like when I cooked my salmon any other way. Then he just scooped it off WITHOUT the skin and the skin stayed on the grill. Pretty cool :) He also put fresh dill on top toward the end of the cooking process. It was super good!

This is my first time cooking salmon and actually eating it. Me and my husband tried this and it is great! I followed the ingredients and didn't change a thing. Only thing is I used my george forman grill and cooked it on 5 minutes on each side. Salmon fillet cooks really fast and didn't want it to flake. I made it with mash potatoes and corn.

It made a very tasty and easy grilled salmon. It was a tangy and complex sweet flavor and was well liked by all who ate it- even those who do not normally like salmon.

Wow...this is super fabulous! Only change I made was to use fresh garlic and fresh ginger. I am not a salmon lover, but I LOVE this salmon. Will make it again. Great dish for company. I served it with Basmati rice and grilled mixed vegetables. Very easy.

I loved this... the family did as well. One of my salmon haters said she liked it. the other said it made salmon tolerable. That's a very HIGH compliment from him! Followed the recipe and grilled it. Will be using again! Thank you.

We love this recipe so much, we eat it every time we have salmon! I make a few small changes tho. I add brown sugar to the marinade. I also let it marinade for as long as possible (an hour or more). I then make a small batch of 2 tablespoons and 2 teaspoons of honey, soy sauce, orange juice and brown sugar and I drizzle over the fish before I bake it at 325 for 20 minutes. Delicious every time!

A tasty foundation for a marinade that I embellished on, grating fresh ginger, smashing garlic clove (to taste), used orange and lemon juices as well as honey...lemon adding its own tartness, and a slice of sweet onion to the basic mix.  Boiled it up and cooled it before placing in with the salmon.  Note to cooks:  Please PLEASE do not cook salmon or any other fish until the flesh flakes.  You have OVERCOOKED IT to a dry mess.  The salmon should be moist and opaque all the way thru, but FLAKED?  Never!

Really, really good! If using a George Forman grill- fish cooks REALLY fast, so be careful not to burn it the first time like me! Looking forward to the next time I make this recipe- I'll try fresh ginger root and fresh minced garlic in the marinade.

This is best on the bbq but in a pinch you can put it in the oven and it is still good.  We bake it at 400 for 10-15 minutes depending on the size and thickness.

This is a good way to make the salmon not taste so fishy. I do agree if the salmon is thicker, you should leave in in the marinade longer. I would use this again.

Fantastic and easy!  Subbed same amount of water and a drop of orange extract for the orange juice, and subbed 1 Tbs. dried minced onion for the green onion.  Marinated for 1/2 hour, then while it was grilling, boiled the marinade down until slightly reduced, then spooned that over the salmon and brown rice on the side.  My steak eating husband tasted it and said it was very good.

I love this recipe. I've made it several times and it's always delicious. I don't have a grill, so I just bake the salmon instead. Served over brown rice with a side of garlic green beans or bok choy, it makes a great dinner.

This was a delicious marinated salmon! I also marinated overnight and I think that enhanced the flavor. Since we currently don't have access to a grill (living in a third floor apt ) I broiled it and almost burned it though at 10 minutes so it needs to be watched if you cook it this way.

I forgot to add the ginger to the marinade. I added 1/2 tsp of the ginger right before baking in the oven, but it was not strong enough. I baked it in the marinade at 325 for 20 minutes. I think grilling would have been better. My major mistake was that I added orange zest to the marinade. BIG MISTAKE! I will try this again but actually follow the recipe.

Awesome and Easy!! Followed recipe as provided; no changes are needed! Update 5-18-14: Cooked again but baked in the oven. I think I like it better cooked in the oven because I poured the marinade over the fish and when it was finished I turned it over before serving so the fish was totally covered with the marinade ... AWESOME! Although ... if the fish is grilled, the used marinated could be brought to a boil before serving it on the side of the fish ... 
This really is better than anything you could buy in a restaurant.

I cut the salmon filet into portions, marinated all day and broiled for 8 minutes.  DELICIOUS.

Just made this salmon today, definitely a keeper! I used fresh ginger and garlic as opposed to powdered cuz fresh is always better. I did not have soy sauce so i used tamari garlic sauce instead. The salmon marinated about 5 hours and baked in the oven instead of grilled. Delicious!

I used 5 drops of orange oil instead cause I didn't have any orange juice.  Threw in a few splashes of lemon juice to get that citrus acid in.  I will make this again!  Hubby, a friend, my 4 boys and I really liked this.  It was very tasty and if I can get my kids to eat fish then I am a happy mommy!  When salmon goes on sale this is my go to recipe!

Awesome and easy recipe! Our new favorite for salmon, it's also amazing on chicken, but I suggest pounding out the chicken to make it thinner and let the marinade soak through.

You need to try this recipe with Hot Squeeze Sweet Heat Chipotle Sauce, instead of the soy, oj and honey, marinate salmon in 1/2 cup Hot Squeeze.  After you grill - bring it to the table and use Hot Squeeze as a sauce!

We eat this in our house at least once a week. No other salmon recipe that I have ever found compares. I tend to make the marindae in the morning before I go to work and then grill the salmon after work. While the salmon is grilling I simmer the marinade down, then serve with the salmon. SOOO GOOD!

Followed recipe exactly and this was pretty blah the first time I made it.  I made it again and this just has to be marinated longer!  30 minutes did nothing.  This time I marinated it overnight (about 20 hours).  It was like a different recipe!  I also added a little salt and pepper while it was grilling which helped.  The longer marinating time takes it from a 3* to a 5* recipe.  The first time husband didn't like it - this time he thought better than a restaurant!

I added some orange zest to up the flavor and I also used fresh ginger and garlic then baked for 20 minutes.  I marinated it for 30 minutes as stated otherwise fish turns to ceviche!

We used this recipe for perch, with a little extra honey.  Then baked in the marinade at 325 degrees until flaky.  So good!

I made this as written except marinating overnight, which was my mistake (not the fault of the recipe at all).  Next time I will either marinate as stated in the recipe or else cut back on the soy and ginger (I have small children and this was a bit strong tasting for them with over night marinating). As written, this recipe rocks!

I didn't have the correct ingredients, so I substituted balsamic vinegar for soy sauce and white onion for green onion and this was pretty darn good.  I'm gonna try it with the correct ingredients soon!

I liked this recipe but also feel like there was too much soy sauce in the marinade.  I used the left over marinade and reduced it to a sauce, drizzled it over the top before eating.  I also cooked this in a foil pack at 375 for about 40 minutes. Turned out very good.  I'd also suggest marinating longer.

I wasn't too sure about this recipe at first, but it turned out great. I marinaded overnight. The fish was really yummy. I used a bit of dehydrated garlic slices to the marinade as well. I thought I had fresh garlic in the fridge, but was mistaken. I also think i want to use a bit less orange juice next time. On some bites, i could taste it more than usual. I served it with the Japanese-Style Green Beans, as suggested by someone here.

This was great, and was very quick and easy.  I used fresh chopped garlic rather than the garlic powder and grilled it on a cedar plank over charcoal.  Very flavorful and the honey made for a beautiful glaze on the salmon.
