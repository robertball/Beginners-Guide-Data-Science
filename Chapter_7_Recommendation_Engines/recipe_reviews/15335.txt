This recipe was a great one for simple, yet delicious cookies! I did make a few changes though. Since I didn't have any semi-sweet chocolate chips, I used milk chocolate chips instead. I also used 3 tbsps of HOT water. To top it off, I chilled the dough in the fridge for 30 minutes. Boy, was I glad I did all of this! The cookies turned out great with the changes and not flat at all unlike some people's reviews. I suggest that you bake it for at least 10 minutes if you want nice and chewy, almost cake-like cookies. If you like your cookies more on the "rough" side than I suggest you bake it for 12 minutes. Hope my review helps you out!

I love this recipe!  My only changes were as follows; substituted 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for 1/2 cup of the white, and used 1/4 cup semi-sweet and 1/4 cup milk chocolate chunks in place of the chips.  I molded these into round balls and used parchment - the cookies flattened out quite quickly into perfect, 1/3 inch thick rounds, so I wouldn't suggest flattening them at all before baking.  I checked my batch after about 8 minutes but ended up baking for about 12.  Crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, not too sweet and even a slight reduction in fat compared to regular cookies..  I'll make these again!

I have never ever been able to bake chocolate chip cookies. Mine always came out flat, greasy and way too crisp. This was my first ever successful batch of chocolate chip cookies! I used 1 cup of packed light brown sugar and 1 yeaspoon of baking soda (because i like my cookies to be big and puffy) and i measured out the dough in 1/8th cups. They were chewy, puffy and soft - AND LOW FAT! i will definately make these again. Thanks Megan!

I switched 6 tbs butter for 3 margarine and 3 applesauce.  They were reportedly really tasty, fluffy and soft... excellent recipe base to start out with...

They were great! My husband and I are on a diet and these are perfect. I tried the cookies out on my best taste tester in the house, my 4 yr old. She loved them too! They don't even taste low fat! Thanks I have been looking for quick low fat cookie recipes!

I found you can substitute the butter with margarine, and the cookie is still delicious.  I'm constantly baking these for my parents, brother, grandparents, aunts, uncles, you name it.  Sometimes I use peanut butter chips instead of chocolate for those who don't like chocolate (yes, these folk do exist), and get lots of smiles in return.

I used this recipe to make my first ever batch of homemade chocolate chip cookies (I usually buy the break n bake pre-mixed dough) and they turned out PERFECT.  I followed the recipe exactly and got soft, chewy, golden cookies.  Depending on your oven, you made need to put them in a little longer than the 8-10 minutes... mine needed closer to 12 minutes.  Also, unless you make REALLY small cookies, I wouldn't say this makes 24.... probably closer to 18.  Still, great recipe and I will definitely be using it again!

This cookie had a great taste; it really satisfied my munchies. I used 4 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons of canola oil, and it still turned out great. However, this hardened the texture, but I like crispy cookies! The taste was just phenomenal. I loved the fact that it used only 1 egg white; it lowers the amount of cholesterol in the cookies!

I was expecting something more from high ratings, but wasn't too impressed with this cookie.  I make "regular" chocolate cookies about once a week, so maybe I can tell the difference too easily.  These cookies were flat, tasted pretty good coming out of the oven, but quickly hardened and went flat. I won't make them again because of those things.  The taste was okay, but for 50-100 calories more, and a few more fat grams, I'll take the original--there is no substitute!

Very yummy cookies. Crisp/crunchy on the edges and soft goodness in the middle. I usually use the Toll House recipe but only had one egg and really wanted chocolate chip cookies. I love that it is a smaller batch of cookies too, since I usually eat a ton of them!

Just like the last reviewr said, these don't seem light because they are so buttery. I loved the flavor, but I only gave it 4 stars because they were too thin and crispy for me.

These cookies are okay if you just want a sweet snack, but otherwise this recipe isn't good. The flavor isn't great, and the cookies spread out too flat for chocolate chip cookies.

OMG!  So amazing!  I added nuts, but the texture of the cookie is to die for.  I love the small batch style cuz I would eat 2x as much with a bigger recipe, i will be using this in the future.  Did I mention I LOVE this cookie?

I added 1/2 more vanilla and walnut halves and coconut and used Bakers semi sweet choc chips cause they are the best and a tad more flour and a little less brwn sugar.

These cookies are light and delicious, I added pecans to my recipe a little heavier but adjust the measurements use a 1/8 a cup of pecans or walnuts. If desired, a great recipe!

great recipe! a little softer than I would've liked. Made some changes, used a whole egg instead of egg white because the dough was a little dry, and instead only used 2 tbsp of water. I also substituted 1/2 cup of whole wheat flower. Didn't taste low fat, and I will definitely be making these again!

Excellent cookie; very light and puffy, used Smart Balance butter to make it a bit healthier and added extra chocolate chunks for more antioxidants, of course! These were not heavy, greasy or too sweet.

In my quest to find the perfect soft/chewy choc chip cookie, I never made cookies that DID NOT get devoured, until this recipe. These are not worth the ingredients, time or energy. Real easy to make but just not what I was looking for. When a 14 y/o boy turns his nose up at them, there is a serious problem! Cookies were too cake like. I did get 24 cookies as the recipe said. And I have NEVER heard of a recipe you can't double because they don't turn out right! Glad I didn't double it. I found my perfect cookies at nestle. 60 cookies gone in 1 day! I give credit where credit is due but these were pretty bad.

After reading reviews left by other users, I decided to substitute some ingredients: 3/4 cup Splenda baking sugar (for brown sugar), 1/4 cup Brown sugar (for white sugar), 3tbsp of margarine & 3tbsp of applesauce (for butter). I also added a teaspoon of baking powder instead of 3/4 teaspoon, a little bit more chocolate chips & about 1/4 cup of walnut. The cookies tasted very good. (And they are significantly lower in calories :) 

I actually liked the other chocolate cookie recipes on this website, too. But, for a healthy snack, I will be using this recipe :) 

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

This is an awesome recipe!!! I followed it exactly(except for substituting bittersweet for semisweet chocolate, 'cause that's what I had) and they came out incredible! From now on this is my go-to cookie recipe. So awesome that I made a second batch right away, with half white chocolate and half chopped pecans and an extra splash of vanilla. Also excellent!!

These are good, great texture but they were pretty sweet. I may try again using less sugar and the whole egg as I'm not concerned about the fat or calories, this was just the first recipe i found with 4 stars.

this recipe did't came out as I spected, the cookies were like, little cakes, I did the recipe exactly as it says... the only changes were that I used stone ground whole wheat, and added some whey protein (which it shouldnt affect the recipe)...   Anyways, it was a ok recipe (NOT CHEWY) I'll try another one next time

These cookies are GREAT! No lie. They are soft, chewy, taste like a great chocolate chip cookie and they look nice! Also try putting about 5 chocolate chips on top of the cookies right after baking, it adds a nice touch :)

These are GREAT for low fat, reduced sugar cookies.  If you compare them to the full fat, sugary ones theyr'e ok.... but the very best of the Light variety! NOTE:  6 Tbsp is just slightly more than 1/3 cup

I don't see how this recipe is "low fat". It's just half of a normal chocolate chip cookie recipe without an egg yolk and the butter reduced a little.

I think this may be the first time in years that I followed a recipe almost exactly. Considering these cookies are a lighter option, they are quite good. Not the best I've ever made, but pretty darn good.

Great cookies although a touch too sweet for me. I also added the whole egg as the mixture seemed too dry. My son and I ate half a dozen right out of the oven.

I just made these and followed the directions exactly except for two things. I didn't hve any chlocolate chips so I tore up a Hersheys bar and used that instead. Also, I baked these for over 30 minutes.  I like my cookies soft but when baking them for only 10 minutes, they were crispy balls of hot cookie dough. I was generous with the spoonfulls (as the recipe suggests) but perhaps I was a bit too generous?   Anyways, I probably will not make them again. The finished result is still very soft and almost dough-y. The taste is okay but not the best cookie ever. Maybe I messed up but i though i followed the directions exactly...  The serving size also calls for 24 and I only got less than 20. Sorry if the 3 star rating is because of smething I did wrong :(    EDIT: I was basing my review off of the first one i tasted, wich (i just realized) was larger than the others. It didn't cook through but all the others were perfect, if a bit crisp. Good recipe and WILL be making these again :) sorry

I added a peice of bread to the crispy ones and concealed it in a box and made them amazing :)

In an effort to make these even lighter, I stuck to the basic recipe guidlines but with substitutions.  I subbed the sugar with a little agave and splenda for the white sugar.  Diabetisweet brown sugar substitute(the best sugar sub I have ever had by far!) for the brown sugar.  I used half white flour and half low carb flour and replaced half the butter and all the water with applesauce.  I also used whole egg and I doubled the recipe. These were by far some of the best cookies I have ever had, lower carb, low fat or not!  Even my son who will only eat my higher fat, full carb foods LOVED them.  He took one bite and said "Mom if these are one of your healthy recipes I highly commend you!" :)

These cookies are absolutely amazing, my friends ask for them all the time! I've done them with mini M&M's and my little cousins went crazy. It's a low-fat recipe that doesn't taste like one! I added about 1/3 cup of flour too...

This was a great recipe. I didn't even tell my family it was low fat (and they never figured it out). I had to add about 1/2 cup more flour than the recipe called for though.

Great recipe, quick and easy and not very fattening part of it is awesome! I make them all the time and my family loves it! I do replace 1/2 cup of four with whole wheat flour and add couple of table spoons of oatmeal. The key is not to over cook them in the oven.

i followed the directions just as said, but these cookies did not come out at all.  i had to cook them longer them the time given and even then they didn't cook all the way. If I cooked them any longer they would have burned. I am not sure if I did anything wrong because like I said I follow the directions exactly. Thanks for the recipe though, wish it would be turned out right.

Just looking at them out of the oven, I don't want to eat them.  I followed all the instructions to the 't' and made no substitutions.  They are tiny flat little things that were on their way to being burnt at 6 minutes.  Many people had luck with this, so I rated it a little better, thinking maybe there was some user error.

This came out good. I used 3/4 cup coconut oil instead of the butter and I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup all purpose flour and 1 tsp of vanilla.

Great recipe! I did change it up a bit by cutting it to 4 tbsps of butter...I also added 1/3 cup rolled oatmeal. They turned out chewy with a bit of crunch. Will definitely make them again!

to those who want to eliminate more fat/Kcals, use applesauce instead of the butter. cant taste the difference, and they come out great.. I made these with applesauce, and splenda and loved them. a nice way to cheat on your diet.

This recipie is great.  I made about 8 dozen of these for a funeral BBQ and they were a hit. I made some regular but then I also did some with different candy bar pieces int hem - m and m's, crunch bars, heath bars, kit kats.  They were so good.

I would rate it four stars if these cookies owned uo to their name, "light." These cookies are okay, pretty good. They were chewy and not too thin. I used 5T butter and 1T applesauce. I also omitted 2 T white sugar. I used 1 1/4 cups all purpose flour and 1/4 cups whole wheat pastry flour. I only got 17 cookies using a 2 tablespoon scoop. That means if you followed this recipe exactly using a 2 T scoop, each cookie would be about 150 calories! Now these are okay for cookies but not "light cookies." Go to award winning soft chocolate chip cookies and they taste so much better with 177 calories each. You can make those cookies 150 each by replace 1/4 of the butter with applesauce, they still tastes like the best cookies ever!

Well most low fat cookies are just weird, but these were the closest I have gotten to real cookies in my low fat experimenting this summer! One reviewer said they were too thin and crispy, but mine were soft and gooey (maybe because I made 16 cookies from this instead of 24?, so each cookie would have more fat, but I don't want chocolate chip cookies the size of a postage stamp)

The thought of light chocolate chip cookies sounded good.I tried this recipe, it was fairly good to make. The end product was semi good. the cookies were crunchy on the outside but on the inside they appeared and tasted a bit raw. I probably wont try this recipe again.

Before I review this, I'd like to clarify that I'm comparing them to the "quintessential chocolate chip cookie".  These particular cookies had a cake-y texture that wasn't unpleasant, but it wasn't what I expect from a chocolate chip cookie. It's a question of preference; these are very airy, and not particularly rich (and I don't see the "chewy" part of the description, they don't really have that). They were tasty (the ingredient combination is tasty, that's just how it is) but the texture was irritatingly un-cookie-like. My sister enjoyed them, and I didn't dislike them; but if you'd like to make rich, moist cookies, this is not really the recipe you want.  I will not be making them again unless someone who likes this sort of thing requests it.

This was easy, quick and delicious!  It really doesn't taste much different from "fatter" cookies.  I think it's the egg yolk absence that makes it lower in fat and cholesterol.  I put peppermint syrup in half of it, and it was really good!  About 2 tablespoons. But I do intend to put more peppermint in next time, so the measurement isn't exact.  Like my mom would say, "just eye it!"  Thanks Megan for the great recipe.

Obviously these don't taste like the full fat chocolate chip cookies that most of us are used to.  Keeping that in perspective, these are great cookies.  They are just right to satisfy that chocolate chip cookie craving without having to worry as much about how many you are consuming.  Most of my cookies get eaten in the dough stage, and this dough also tastes great!

I really enjoy the taste of these cookies, but mine turned out like cake cookies. I did switch the butter to 3 table spoons shortening and and individual cup of unsweetened apple sauce. Everything else I kept the same. Maybe a few more chocolate chips!!! So like I said if you like cake cookies, try it with shortening, the flavour was great, but next time I will try butter.

I was not impressed with these cookies at all.  They were so flat and they lacked taste and texture.  I was really looking for a tasty light chocolate chop cookie recipe, but unfortunately this wasn't it.  It's more satisfying to eat half of one of the "Best, Big, Fat Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookie" from this site than to eat a whole one of the cookies in this recipe.

Wow! I really couldn't tell the difference between these cookies and the regular (i.e. full fat) ones! They are crispy outside and chewy inside--just the way I like them. I think they are better than Mrs. Field's, and also the Award winning chocolate chip cookie recipe on this site (the one that uses instant pudding mix)...a lot less greasy and definitely not sickeningly sweet. =D I substituted butter flavored crisco for butter because crisco is supposed to make it spread less (there's no water content in crisco, unlike butter). The dough turned out a bit sticky, but the cookies turned out fabulous. I was scared initially because they looked really puffed up when I took them out of the oven, but after a while they deflated and looked just like the kind in bakeries. I was gonna try white chocolate chips, but I think it will be way too sweet when combined with this dough. So semi-sweet chocolate chips are the best choice...I used Ghiradelli's and they tasted wonderful. P.S. I baked these at 2 am in the morning after reading the reviews, and even though I am on a diet, I just couldn't resist eating a couple of them! THE BEST recipe and a definite keeper!

Not a big baker.  Actually up to a week ago, I didn't even have a bowl big enough to mix this recipe.  This recipe makes for a light fluffy cookie that is absolutley wonderful.  Easy to make, low fat, and taste great....what more could you ask for!

What a great recipe!  This is my favorite recipe for chocolate chip cookies.  These cookies are so good that I went against the advise of doubling the recipe.  I doubled the recipe and the cookies turned out just as delecious.  The key to doubling the batter is to make sure you mix it well.

Great recipe! My husband and I are watching our calorie intake, but had a Friday night craving for some fresh baked chocolate chip cookies. These hit the spot! Didn't get quite 24 cookies, ended up snacking on the delicious raw dough! Oops! :)

These cookies are delicious. Very light and moist. I baked them for 10 minutes but they still weren't done so I added 5 more. These cookies took up 2 baking sheets, and I found that the ones baked on the bottom rack were lighter colored the ones baked on the top. I wouldn't change a thing!

Well, there is no rain today..but I am disappointed in this. The flavor is wonderful, and while they baked on the sheet they were absolutely beautiful. When I removed them from the oven, they fell flat as pancakes; and as I began to remove them from the sheet, they 'ruffled'. I just don't care for that in a recipe..I want them round, uniform, And great tasting.

When I made this cookie I loved the recipe but I think it was def. missing some flour because not even a minute after I took it out of the oven I watched it deflate before my eyes. Besides that it was a pretty good cookie. I did try some of the other peoples changes with it and it might have helped. Now my not an expert cookie maker so dont let this keep you from making this! So bake away!

I just made these cookies and they were really good for being low fat.  They are cake-like and remind me of a muffin top (the best part of the muffin to me). I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great.  I did chill the dough in the fridge for about 20 minutes before I put it on the baking sheet.

Absolutely fantastic! Worked out perfectly, follow the directions to shape into balls and not flatten, perfect results. My girl and I added 4 varieties of chips and they worked out very well. I highly recommend peanut butter flavour.

I used yhie recepie today and the cookies were great. I did not have brown sugar, so made it with white sugar and molasses. I also useed 3 T butter and 3 T applesauce. I added choppens pecans to half to batter.
Both versions were good, but the pecan ones are my fav.

Great recipe! I usually struggle to get the consistency right when baking cookies, but this recipe works out perfectly. Ive used it a few times now and will continue to do so. Ive made it even healthier by using light sugars and butter. A must try.

Yum!  The only change I made to this recipe was that I added a whole cup of chips instead of a half, but otherwise followed it exactly.  The cookies were great, just wish they were a little thicker.  They spread out a lot on the cookie sheet, but made 24 large cookies!  I'll definitely make these again!

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe, still very tasty for being low fat. I took another reviewers suggestion of 1/2 butter and 1/2 applesauce, changed to whole wheat flour, and used 1 cp of a mixture of sucanat and natural sugar to bump up the healthiness of these awesome cookies! Thanks!

Fantastic! I followed this recipe to a T and the cookies were perfect. I especially like how they were lower in calories and fat than regular cookies-- but you can't tell from the taste. They made 24 cookies as expected. Quick and easy. They took about 12-14 minutes to bake, not the 8-10 as given.

I was really pleased with how these cookies turned out. I substituted Splenda for the 1/4 cup of white sugar. Instead of the 6 TBS butter, I used 2 TBS light butter, 3 TBS unsweetened applesauce, and 1 TBS margarine (an odd mix, I know; I was using what I had on hand). I used 1 cup of white flour and 1/2 cup of wheat flour. Finally, as another reviewer suggested, I made sure the water I added was HOT water. I did chill the dough for a short time and baked the cookies for 10 minutes. They came out brown and the flavor was great; however, they are cake-like. I am so pleased that this yolk-free recipe tastes so good and my husband had to ask what was different to make them light.

This is the best chocolate chip cookie recipe I've ever tried. The fact that its lower in fat is an added bonus. My cookies came out perfect-crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside. I did increase the amount of chocolate chips because I love chocolate so much. :) Great recipe!

it deffiantely tastes "low fat" despite what other reviews say.  my family said they could taste that it was low fat however it was very good for a cookie with a significent lower calorie and fat count.  i however would rather eat a couple hundred more calories and get a more satisfying taste, however deffiantely not a "bad cookie"

EASY yes FAST yes TEXTURE fine TASTE not the same as a regular chocolate chip cookie. Basicly a good cookie, but the taste wasn't the same. Right when my brother tasted one, he said, "What kind of cookie is this?" I told him chocolate chip. He said it tasted different..However, my other brother preferred these over another cookie I made, but he's only eight. I didn't know if I should give this recipe a four or five star rating. But, because it low fat, you should expect it to taste different. So I gave it five stars because it still tasted good.

Loved loved loved these cookies.  I always had trouble getting chocolate chip cookies to be chewey and not flat and crispy.  I only used 1/4 C of chips and it was a great balance between cooky and chocolate.  I had to bake them to 11 minutes, but it might be my oven.

We just made these cookies, and they are indeed very soft and moist, maybe a little too much so. I had to bake mine a few minutes more because they were too goey. We added a little cocoa powder and extra chips to the batter to make it more chocolatey, maybe that made them too soft, I don't know. The taste was good, not fantastic.

So moist, rich, chewy and soft!! I am not sure why this recipe didnt work out for others, but I followed it exactly and they were tall and fluffy and soooo good. I think I may have underbaked them a bit, but it may have just made them richer. A warning for those who eat with their eyes first, they are a bit light in color, not the rich golden brown we are used to seeing. So perhaps a bit of cocoa or something would give it a richer color. Enjoy!!

I just made this chocolate chip cookie, and I have to say that it was pretty good for a lower fat version.  It is a little bit drier than your typical chocolate chip cookie, but I still found them to be pretty yummy!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I wanted to make double chocolate chip cookies for my chocoholic husband, so I added 7 tablespoons of cocoa powder (derived from a chocolate cookie recipe I have from Cooking Light).  The result was that this cookie tasted very brownie like.  Very good- I would definitely try this recipe again.  Who thought that even low fat cookies could taste so good?  And I feel much better making these cookies than buying commercial ones loaded with trans-fats.

ugh...ive made much better cookies...these were awlful and not worth the low fat because i kept on trying more to see if they would start to taste better. It didn't work and they came out flat and thin.  There is no substitute for the real thing.  Try the award winning cookies. everyong loves those because they come out fluffy and yummy. Don't make the same mistake that i did

These were the Best Cookies I have ever made. They were soft even after a few days. I will bake these again and share them at family gatherings. Awesome Recipe!

I followed the recipe but these cookies came out tasting floury. If I make these again I will use less flour then what is called for in the recipe.

Very good cookies! Only negative is that they have a lot of butter in them. But I loved that they stayed soft after baking! Yum, I ate them all. I think this recipe is better than the "regular" recipe. I would make this again.

Yummy, gooey goodness! Followed exactly except I was out of vanilla, put in extra water to compensate. 
They aren't pretty and a little on the flat side, but not enough to be a problem. Didn't last long enough to know if they loss their gooeyness!

My fiance LOVES these cookies!! They are super easy to make and the only complaint I have is that the recipe doesn't make a larger batch. Oh, and I tried using baking M&M's one time and they didn't turn out at all.

I really did not like these when they first came out of the oven but by the next day they seemed to have more flavor.  My eldest son really did like them a lot but I think there are better recipes out there.  Thanks for letting us try

this recipe was awesome! so moist and chewy that no one would ever think that it was a "light" variation. i used one cup of dark chocolate chunks that i've broken myself and the cookies came out a nice golden/brown color (probably due to the small chocolate shavings that i also added in there). it baked for eight minutes flat and boy, was it good!

I'm glad I waited to post my review.  I wasn't crazy about these right out of the oven or even that same day - almost threw the recipe away.  But when I ate one the next day, it was very good!  Very chewy and yummy.  They did stick horribly to the baking sheet, and when I sprayed Pam on the next batch, they went TOTALLY flat.  Will try parchment paper next time.  (Don't know how they tasted two days later, coz we ate them all!!)

These tasted just like regular chocolate chip cookies.  Mine didn't really turn out crispy at all, but they were soft and chewy.  I added more chocolate chips, which probably canceled out the "light" part of the recipe, but they were great.

These cookies were AWESOME! They taste exactly like normal Tollhouse chocolate chip cookies andhave a good texture too.  Although i did find i had to cook them longer than 8 to 10 minutes for them to get golden.

WOW!Great cookies! My husband and I love them! And let me tell ya, my husband is a hard sell on any thing "light" or "low-fat"
The next time I make them I am going to try it with 1/4 cup less flour.

thanks!!

Quick and easy to make. Husband: these are so sot, me: from scratch, him: wow! So I guess they're a win LOL I did use the suggestion to refrigerate for 30min. I think it helped with pan placement.

I double the recipe every time, and they turn out great!  I use one whole egg rather than two whites, otherwise I just double everything as written.  My family doesn’t notice that they are lighter than the usual cookies.

Made these once, they were ok.  Not on the sweet side at all which is good considering the chocolate chips in them.  I would recommend this recipe and would make them again.

When I only had egg whites in my fridge, I found this recipe. They turned out pretty good! I found that storing then right away helped keep them soft.

I thought these were just ok. They're very cake-y, so if that's what you like in a chocolate chip cookie, this is the right kind for you. I prefer a little chew and a little crispness, and these cookies have neither. Too much flour and leavening for that.

i'm impressed with this recipe. I substituted all purpose flour with brown rice flour, and I used 3 tbsp of butter and 3 tbsp of apple sauce instead of 6 tbsp of butter. I added 1/2 c coconut flakes because I love the chocolate/coconut combo. They came out light and moist and delicious. I'll use this recipe again.

Yum Yum Yum Yum YUM!!  I didn't think that I would be as happy with these cookies as I am!  For being Low fat, they taste like my grandma's...maybe grandma has been making low fat chocolate cookies all this time...Light and fluffy, just like I like them!!
