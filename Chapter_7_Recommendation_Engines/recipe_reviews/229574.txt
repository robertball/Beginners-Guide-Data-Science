One of the best cosmo recipes I've tried in a long time. I think it's the fresh lime juice makes this drink.

This was a really nice sipping drink.  I didn't have fresh limes, so I used bottled lime juice and subbed peach schnapps for triple sec and it was delightful.  I sugar rimmed my glass and very much enjoyed the added crunch.  No garnishes, here, but "Frosted Cranberries" would make an excellent holiday garnish for this drink.  CHEERS, Sheila Parcell Fisher!
