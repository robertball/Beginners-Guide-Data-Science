This is very good and very easy.  It is better with some added salt and some sriracha.

My original recipe actually said to put this over rice, as Filipinos usually do. But apparently the rice got lost in translation. Hahaha. Please do enjoy this recipe over rice. And thanks for the great rates!

Delicious! It's a nice change from my usual way of making corned beef with just onions and garlic.

This was fast and easy, my husband insisted  we try it this year. We enjoyed it. I doubled the recipe for a big group. His mother came over she is a Filipina and says it should be served over rice.
