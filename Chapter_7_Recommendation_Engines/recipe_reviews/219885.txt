These are pretty tasty - I added a few black olive and a little green onion for color.  They must have been good because within 15 minutes there were none left.

I personally did not like the bratwurst sausage over top the nachos but it tastes really good even without it! Such a lovely recipe. It is also very versatile, my favourite adjustment to this recipe is that after I put the cheese, I like to put green/red bell peppers, green onions, and mushrooms all diced. It makes such a savoury combination of sweet and salty.

A delicious new way to serve brats! I loved the spices. I can see where they would be devoured by a crowd, however there are only two of us and I wish I had thought to only assemble half the recipe and saved the ingredients for a second assembly. Now I have leftovers which won’t hold up. Bad planning on my part. I also would have loved some salsa verde for dipping. You’d think nachos are nachos so how different can this be? They are just different enough and as yummy as any nachos I’ve eaten, if not more tasty!

Really tasty. I was looking for a nacho recipe for a last minute dinner idea. I had ground beef so I used that with taco seasoning. Added black olives and green chilies (because it's what I had!)

Great nachos! The only thing I did differently was I used a can of chopped green chiles instead of pickled jalapeno slices.  I split the pan in half and did a "kid friendly" side(no spice) for my little ones.  They loved the nachos and I loved that it used bratwurst in a new and delicious way!!
