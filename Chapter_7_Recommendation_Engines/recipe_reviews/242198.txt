I really enjoyed this smoothie, and made it 3 mornings in a row to use up my blueberries. I think you could easily use frozen blueberries and skip the ice.  I used Oikos nonfat Greek yogurt. For the OJ, I used Tropicana Trop 50 (low cal/low sugar) and I only used 1tsp of sugar instead of 1tbsp (I don't like my smoothies too sweet). This ended up being 188 cals instead of 295 cals, with these ingredients and the reduced sugar. The vanilla was a nice touch, and I might even increase it to 1/2 tsp.  Very versatile and healthy! Thanks Lisa Marie for sharing!

Forget the breakfast part, I’m going to be drinking this morning, noon and night.  This was excellent.  The only change I made was to eliminate the sugar and use honey instead, and use two ice cubes.  This is a keeper!

Orange juice is high in sugar, then you add more sugar.  Healthy? No.  I added natural honey and used vanilla greek yogart, eliminating the orange juice, vanilla and sugar. Want the orange flavor? Freshly squeeze your orange juice.

This is the first recipe that I have made from the site where I did make substitutions. But this is really one of those recipes that you can play around with. I used frozen blueberries (I didn't have fresh). I used a small container of strawberry Greek yogurt and added a little bit of nonfat milk. I don't ever have juice in the house so I used the juice of half a lemon. Added a little bit of sugar and a little honey. Omitted the vanilla extract but did add a dash of cinnamon and since my blueberries were frozen I omitted the ice. End result was one of the best smoothies I have ever had. The consistency was absolutely perfect and the lemon made it tangy but it was still sweet. Thanks to this recipe and all the variations you can do with it I don't see myself ever buying another smoothie again.

Add more orange juice than the recipe says, it was too thick and needed a little more sweetness.

I doubled the recipe to make it for 2 & substituted 1 cup of strawberries in for 1 of the cups of blueberries and it was great :)

That was out of this world!!! Definitely the best smoothie I've ever tasted. I didn't happen to have any Greek yogurt so I substituted it for plain and added an extra tablespoon of sugar. Best thing I've ever had, and it's pretty healthy too. I also used frozen blueberries and it tasted fine all the same.

The orange juice makes it a bit tart.  At first I tried to omit the sugar because I am trying to do clean eating.  I did have to add the sugar.  You might get away with no sugar by substituting a sweeter juice like Pomegranate, pineapple, or apple juice.  I used frozen blueberries so instead of ice I used 1/4c water.   Once I added the sugar it was delicious.  It might also be good with oatmeal, flax meal, or wheat germ.  I will make it again!

VERY good!  I had sugar free cranberry juice so I used that in stead of OJ. Used plain yogurt and substituted Sweet N Low for the sugar.  Great low cal., low carb snack!

Really good, and I'm always happy to find smoothie recipes without bananas (I hate the things).  I leave out the sugar and if I'm using frozen berries, I skip the ice.  The cinnamon is a nice touch with the blueberries.

My daughter and I got a new Rocket Blender and this was the first smoothie recipe we made as a part of our vow to eat healthier.  We loved it!  We followed the recipe as is--and we even liked the cinnamon flavor.

Used fresh Valencia oranges off the tree and didn't need any sugar. The cinnamon adds a fantastic surprise kick. Favorite smoothie EVER.

I loved it. I used a frozen blend of blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries, used about 3/4 cup of OJ, and since the berries were frozen, I left out the ice. It came out really good, especially for my 2nd attempt ever at a smoothie.

Yum!! My husband and I absolutely love this smoothie. It’s so creamy and tasty. We made a couple little tweaks here and there... For the yogurt I use Greek Gods nonfat Greek yogurt. I use Truvia instead of regular white sugar and I use Tropicana 50 instead of regular orange juice to cut back on sugar. Turned out amazing! We have it everyday! :-)

From now on, this is my go to recipe for whenever I am craving something fruity and refreshing. I used frozen mixed berries and plain yogurt instead. It wasn't too thin at all! I also omitted the vanilla flavoring.

It was very tarty and I don’t like that but if you do follow the recipe exactly. If you like it sweet and fruity add more sugar and a few more blueberrys.

This was great!  I really liked it.  Prepared as written except left out the ice cubes as I used frozen blueberries and substituted Stevia for the regular sugar.  Thanks for the recipe!  I will make this again!

Made it with frozen blueberries. Pretty good flavor though the skins made it difficult to drink.

The best smoothie I've ever made. I used Chobani plain yogurt. Also used frozen blueberries but still used ice.

Very good! Loved the cinnamon add as it goes very well with this mixture. I omitted the sugar and ice since I used frozen blueberries. I wanted a difficult smoothie for breakfast without the greens since I am always adding green to mine. This was it!

Excellent smoothie! My blueberries were frozen so I didn't add ice. My orange juice was low sugar, and I had to add more of it to get the blender moving. I only added 1/2 tblsp of sugar, but I think I could get by without adding it at all. The cinnamon was a nice, subtle touch.

it was delicious but instead of orange juice I used apple organic juice with no added sugars, however I did add 1 tablespoon of sugar hehe, and I also added more ice cubes as I liked it to almost be like a sorbet but this did not change the flavour it still tasted delicious :)

Turned out great! I made this smoothie a bit healthier by using a few strawberries to sweeten it instead of the sugar and blended some spinach in with the oj before adding everything else to get some veggies :)

We made it but changed the orange juice to apple and it made it taste even better! But you will have to add a lot of extra juice if you make it with frozen blueberries.

Very nice. I used fresh frozen blue berries, no ice and vanilla Greek yogurt, no extra sugar because there's sugar in the yogurt and I juiced a fresh orange.

Good recipe and hubby loves it!!  OK, what I have now changed....  I forego the ice cubes and add a frozen, overripe banana.  (Take those that didn't get eaten soon after home arrival.  Peel, individually wrap in plastic wrap, and throw in the freezer.  Ready to go for smoothies!)  Sometimes I add other frozen berries and/or vanilla and sometimes I don't.  If want to add a dessert touch, throw in a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Not as healthy, but really good!!   Great for a "lighter" breakfast, but don't expect it to keep you satisfied for very long.

I eliminated the ice cubes and used frozen blueberries, didn't have orange juice so used grape juice and a little honey.  Turned out pretty good!
