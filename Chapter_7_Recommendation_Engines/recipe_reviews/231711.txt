I skipped hot sauce and added 2 chipotle peppers. It gave it a very mild kick with a bit of smokiness. As others have said, absolutely save the liquid from the beans and use  it later to have some needed moisture. I also skipped the baking portion as it seemed unnecessary. Also, some have sniped about where to put in the beans - when you lower the heat and simmer with beans is where you add the beans.

Do reserve some of the juice from the beans because you'll need it.  Without  it, you’ll be adding some water because the mixture will be too dry, thick, and sticky, so use the reserved bean liquid which will add some flavor.  The one thing that I really don’t get is why you would bake the beans for an additional 10 minutes.  The bacon is cooked so you’re not browning it, you’re not melting anything, so to me, it just seems like an unnecessary step.  Just heat and simmer the beans and serve.  The recipe author says "...great combination of sweet and spicy."   IMO there’s no “spicy” in this with just a dash of Tabasco for 2 cans of beans, so you’ll need to adjust that to your taste preference if you want a little kick. Also, there’s an omission in the recipe because it doesn’t tell you when to add the beans.  I mixed up everything and then stirred in the beans to heat.  On the positive side, we did like them.

This seemed dry, maybe should have used the liquid from the beans?  Also the recipe as written does not mention adding the beans with the other ingredients!

This recipe did exactly what I needed it to do! What to do with a can of red beans for a side dish in a hurry?  Nothing fancy but pretty good flavor. Like one other reviewer said, "Save the bean juice." You will definitely need it. I made these in 10 minutes using pre cooked bacon. I think I would have preferred to leave out the dry mustard, or at least cut it back a little, as that flavor seemed to dominate the others just by a tad. Maybe a tbsp of molasses would add even more flavor.  I might try that next time.  Overall, the beans were good, easy to make,  and on the table for a great side with hamburgers.  Thanks for the recipe Whino!

I am assuming you put the beans in on step 2.
