First of all, I have to say that I made a lot of modifications. I was looking for a healthy cake/bar with applesauce that we can eat as a family for dessert, and not blow a bunch of calories! This turned out to be a good starting point. I used turbinado sugar (same sweetness as processed, but comes in crystals--still has that molasses flavor, but lighter). We had some leftover cinnamon applesauce, so I used that, and the little bit of extra cinnamon was great. Instead of raisins, I chopped up half of a big gala apple (skin on, important vitamins) and used about a third of a cup of chopped walnuts. I also used 2/3 whole wheat flour, instead of all white.

That said, it's a delicious, moist bar with a wonderful flavor, and I think the apples and walnuts make it much more satiating, too. It's also very quick and easy to make, popped it in as I was making lunch.

The only reason I didn't put 5 stars, is because I made so many changes and didn't leave it as-is.

A very nice, cake like texture. Almost like a spice cake. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was I didn't care for the icing. I will make this again but make a different icing.

These are a very moist bar.  They have a nice flavor.  Next time, I think I will just dust with powdered sugar instead of icing them.

This is good stuff! I'm trying to eat healthier, so made some adjustments. I used 1/3 cup wheat flour, 2/3 cup white. Only used 1/2 cup brown sugar, but next time will use 1/3, because the raisins really make it sweet enough for our taste, even with wheat flour. Also increased the spice, since we like more of a kick: 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp cloves (I don't have or use pumpkin pie spice). I sprinkled 1/2 cup chopped walnuts on top, rather than ice them.  Thank you!

I have tons of chunky applesauce in our freezer and always looking for recipes to use it up. This is a winner, I used double the applesauce and added some cinnamon with the pumpkin pie spice.  My hubby said to be sure and keep this recipe, it was a home run.

The recipe itself is excellent, altho I plumped the raisins in a saucepan with a little apple juice.  Drain well before adding to batter.  The icing tastes good, but needs more milk to make it spreadable & also to cover the entire pan. I ended up adding about a treaspoon more milk....do it slowly, maybe 1/2 teaspoon or less at a time.

32 servings?  You're kidding, right?  My hubby's idea of a serving is two pieces of about 2x2 inches on top of each other! LOL!!!  I wasn't so sure he'd like them, but I wanted them.  I did use butter instead of shortening, of course--MUCH healthier, no trans-fats!

I had already tried the plain applesauce bars (same recipe as this one except it uses butter instead of shortening) from this site and I thought they would taste even better with nuts or raisins. They indeed do! We really enjoy these bars as an afternoon snack or even as a dessert! I also feel it's impossible to fail... I completely messed up the proportions the second time I made them and they still tasted great!

This was really good. I think I will add a bit more spice next time. All the kids(6) liked it afterschool for snack.

This recipe is fantastic!  I made it exactly how the recipe instructed and thought the texture and flavor were absolutely delightful!  I also LOVE the icing!  I think the key is cooking the butter long enough before adding the rest of the ingredients - YUMMY!!!

Delicious.  I used butter, 1/2 b sugar and whole wheat flour and added a chopped apple too.  We skipped the icing and had it for breakfast.  Will definitely make it again.

Really good, although next time I will add a tiny bit more milk to the icing so it spreads easier. My 8 year old is on a raisin hating kick so he said they're just so-so and only ate one, but my husband says I have to make these every day!

I used figs instead of raisins. Added cinnamon, nutmeg and a dash of cloves as I don't buy pumpkin pie spice.  Also gave them a light dusting of powdered sugar when cool.

Did this without the icing and use butter instead of shortening...so good and moist.  Also since I doubled it ended up cooking at 350 for about 40 minutes.
