My mom and i used to decorate cakes for wedddings. She used this recipe all the time for the fine details used on the cakes. Her tip was to use a drop of blue food colouring to keep the icing a brilliant white.

Royal icing is generally used to make decorations on cakes and to "cement" decorations together, and is not recommended for icing cakes.  I did use this recipe as I was out of meringue powder and it turned out pretty decent.

Absolutely amazing for decorating cookies and so easy to make however it doesn't work very well for holding things together. The outside get's crusty but the inside (if using a thicker coat) stays soft. I added a touch of pure orange extract to get rid of the raw egg smell and the added flavour gave the icing a citrus taste which was a huge hit!

I agree with a number of the other reviews.  This icing was okay, although it was a bit loose, so to get it to set, I used quite a lot of sugar.  As a result, it was very sweet.

Like the others, I did have to add a lot more sugar than the recipe states, but it tasted great even with the extra sugar.

For those who found it grainy... powdered sugar won't make it grainy only real sugar - make sure you use powdered sugar.  For those who found it too runny: the egg whites need to be beaten until frothy first, then add powdered sugar and beat until you get the consistency you want, THEN add half the lemon juice gradually while you continue beating.  If it's still too thick add additional lemon juice.  I use these ingredients all the time to make royal icing (which technically isn't used to "ice" things but to make decorations) and have never had a problem with it being too runny or soft.  The consistency depends entirely on how well you beat the egg whites and powdered sugar - longer = stiffer - just like making meringue.  If you add the juice too soon it may not stiffen up properly.   If you want a good recipe for "coating" cookies use this one: 1 c powdered sugar, 2 Tblsp honey or white cane syrup, 1 Tblsp milk, 1/4 tsp almond flavoring - mix sugar and honey then add milk to get the right consistency (may add more if you want it thinner but don't make too thin - if you make it too thin add more sugar -  but try to keep the ratios balanced) then add flavoring.  It coats well and air dries quick without refrigerating.  I brush it onto my sugar cookies as a base coat before decorating with piped icing.

Icing came out good.  I'm not much of an expert when it comes to decorating though.  I don't know why the others batches came out to thin if anything I could of put a tbsp or two of water in my batch to thin it out.

Adjust the sugar and lemon juice (or water) for your desired consistency. To 'flood' a cookie and get a smooth finish you would want the icing a little loose and I would probably start with 3 cups of sugar. If you beat our egg whites enough it will stiffen up quickly (any yolk will prevent egg whites from stiffening). Put cookies in the fridge or freezer to stiffen quicker if you plan on piping on decorations after the initial base of frosting. This recipe does need to be thicker, or of piping consistency, to pipe on more intricate decorations. This means almost as thick as creamy peanut butter (sorry that's the best thing I can think of to compare to). To achieve this consistency simply add more powder sugar.

In my opinion, the negative comments about this icing are made by people who don't really know what Royal Icing is supposed to be like.  This is a good icing and it turned out exactly as I expected it to. If you want it a little stiffer, add more powdered sugar. If you want it a little softer, add less. It's supposed to be sweet and it's supposed to be pure white. The egg whites ensure the color as well as the texture and consistency. In the UK (where I'm from), royal icing is commonly used on Christmas cakes, Wedding cakes, Christening cakes - any kind of rich fruit cake. It is not commonly used on cookies.  This is a very versatile icing and can be left a little rough or be smoothed into a perfectly flat and level surface, depending on what you require. It also hardens at it dries so provides a good base for adding tiers. It is supposed to harden as it dries, it is the nature of the icing. I believe this can be avoided somewhat if you add glycerine but I have never done that and don't know how much you would use. Overall, it is a very good recipe which I have used many, many times with no issues.

This was my first time ever making royal icing.  I found the icing a bit thick and I only used 3 cups sugar.  Was it maybe I whipped the egg whites too much?  I added a wee bit more lemon juice.  Very tasty though.   This is much harder than it looks on tv and in pictures.  I'll keep practicing.

I use this simple recipe each time I need to decorate sugar cookies, which is about once every two weeks!  A little water thins the recipe for easy flooding consistency.

This was my first attempt at royal icing for sugar cookies. It was a simple recipe and worked beautifully. As in the recipe, I added enough icing sugar for my desired consistency (so that the icing would be smooth) which wound up being just a little less than 4 cups. 

I wasn't crazy about the taste so I added just a splash of peppermint extract. The result was a slight minty-citrus taste that was good with a basic sugar cookie. I will definitely make it again!

This is pretty much my standard royal icing recipe for decorating cut out cookies. I use 1/3 cup pasteurized egg whites because I have a thing about using raw eggs. Let it whip at high speed for at least 5-7 minutes to get it thicker. The lemon is a great flavor or substitute with vanilla and almond extract.

Didn't enjoy this recipe. Ended up using way less icing sugar and a lot more Leno juice to get the right consistency. In the end I made it work but won't use this recipe again.

It was just watery sugar really. It had no solidity or smooth consistency. It was grainy and pure sugar in the most literal way possible. It doesn't have an icing taste, when I put it on my sugar cookies all it did was make it really really sweet.
