Easy and very good!  Can see serving in a bowl on a cheese platter.  Would go great with red wine too.  The texture was surprising and pleasing.

I could not believe how good these are, especially when you eat them when they're still warm. Everyone who tried them was totally taken by surprise, in a good way.

My grapes bleached while cooking and I offered them to my family as eyeballs. However, they were pretty good! Everyone thought baked grapes sounded weird, but they finished them off and I didn't get any negative reactions! I'll try them again.

Keeper for sure! Three of us went through a whole bowlful with cheese and crackers. Minor variations: I used black moondrop grapes, dried herbs because I didn't have any fresh, and a white balsamic vinegar which is probably a little lighter a taste than regular. All-in-all, a delightful surprise for everyone!

Delicious. Did not taste anything at all like expected. Made me think I was in Italy!

These were really good.  Served it with smoked gouda and white wine.  Great happy hour for me and my husband.

Excellent! I used Moon Drop Grapes and had to roast them for 30 minutes before they started to wrinkle and split.  I enjoyed these so much and will make them on a regular basis. Thanks for the recipe, Olivia!

I turned this recipe into a delicious sauce by cooking it on the stove top. It was absolutely fantastic served over a white fish fillet! I have used this sauce with cod, baramundi and grouper so far, and intend on trying it with venison. Brilliant recipe! Thank you for sharing it.

I guess I got the wrong kind of grapes because even after about 30 minutes they were still not wrinkled or split. I have not finished them yet because they are just out of the oven

These were surprisingly very good. It took 30mins for them to wrinkle in my oven. Will definitely make again.

Delicious addition to our happy hour options.  This dish gives a lovely dipping syrup for your leftover pieces of crusty bread.

I had to talk myself into eating them so of course I did not like them. My husband first called them "interesting" and later said he did like them. So they weren't a total flop but I won't make them again either.
