Four stars as written, Five stars with a few changes, as others also suggested.  1.  Saute a small onion in butter until very soft.   2. Saute a couple of cloves of garlic after the onion. Add the onion and garlic to the cream sauce.  3.  Add 1/4 cup cream and 1 tsp flour to the recommended cream, and wisk this together.  This will make the cream sauce thicker.  4.  Reduce the nutmeg just a bit- you can always add more.

The nutmeg is the thing!!  This is an excellent recipe.  It is comparable to the spinach you get at Bostom Market and Buckheads
Very quick and easy to make!!

I gave this recipe 4 Stars because I wouldn't use it "as is" without some additions. However, it is a good basic recipe & reminds me of my Granny's creamed spinach. I add(ed) finely chopped onions, Parmesan cheese, salted butter & garlic salt. I also used bagged (vs. boxed), frozen spinach heated up in the microwave. (It's the "driest" way I know to cook spinach.) I served this (my) rendition at Christmas and it was good enough that the kids ate it w/out complaint. :-)
I'll have to try it with bacon, as some Reviewers suggested. That would be a nice variation, I think. Oh, yeah: I do like the nutmeg in there.

Good recipe with some changes.  Original recipe is soupy.  Add 1/4 cup more heavy cream and 1 tablespoon of flour to cream sauce.  This will thicken it up.  If you aren't a huge nutmeg fan, half the recipe amount.

I sauteed a small onion and 2 cloved of garlic in 1 Tbsp of butter until soft. Then added the seasoning and spinach. I sauteed that just a minute to warm the spinach. I added just a touch under 1/2 cup cream (that's all I had). It turned out GREAT! I'm the only one in my house who like spinach and it was gone in two meals. It was close the creamed spinach at Boston Market..only better.

I had spinche I needed to use but no heavy cream...hence I made 1 Cup of standard medium white sauce (2 T butter,2 T flour,1 C milk, 1/4 t salt, 1/8 t white pepper)and served in a individual pastry tart shells.  It was elegant and delicious!

In the words of my 12yr. old son, "WOW!"  This recipe was a big hit.  Let's face it Boston Market makes the BEST creamed spinach, but this recipe is a great home version.  Like others I altered it a bit.  Used an extra 1/4 cup of cream. Cut the nutmeg in half, used 1 T of flour, 1/4 c parmesan, 1/4 c chopped onion, 2 cloves of garlic and 3oz. of cream cheese.  It was great!

This is a good base recipe.  The changes I make are that I used salted butter, half-and-half to trim some fat, Vidalia onion (about 1/4 of one), and I add about 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese to add richness to the taste.  Let me tell you, it works!

I read the reviews before I tried this dish, but thought I would try it anyway, as many said it was watery. It turned out great, the only thing I changed, was to spin it dry after washing and I wilted the spinach in the pan, in the sauce, at med-high heat. I did not steam it before. The sauce coated the spinach just fine. I did add some cooked bacon.

I'm giving this 2 stars because it has potential, but really, no one in my family could finish it. I was skeptical about the amount of nutmeg - its not a "little bit" - it was a lot! I can see where half as much might have been nice, but none of us ate more than a few bites. I will try this again with no more than 1/2 the nutmeg suggested.  Also, I don't see the need for a food processor - it seems like you'd get mush. Just drain the spinach, put it on a cutting board and use a knife to chop it up a bit. And a tip: if you're more likely to have cream cheese in the fridge, you can substitute it nicely for the heavy cream. Just add it in with the spinach and stir to melt it without burning.

This was delicious.  I am in the Peace Corps and in my region I have acces to fresh spinach all the time and this was a great use for it.

Even though I tweaked the method of preparing this, I used virtually the same ingredients, so I'm giving the recipe a 5 for taste...  My quicker method was to saute the coarsely chopped fresh spinach in the butter until wilted.  Next I sprinkled on the flour and mixed well.  Nutmeg, salt, pepper, and a little garlic powder were followed by 2% milk.  Simmer for a few minutes before serving.

I added almost a stick of butter, a little garlic salt, and skipped the nutmeg.  I also used frozen spinach since I didnt have fresh and it still tasted great.

I did not like this.  I did not like the nutmeg or the consistency of the whole thing.  It was runny and gross.

Very good!  Made a few minor changes based on what I had.  Used 1/2 and 1/2 and (2) packages of frozen spinach. Used only 1/4 tsp nutmeg.

Sorry, but this was a huge disappointment and a waste of $ with my using organic spinach and heavy cream.  I followed the recipe and it was bland and watery. 
Update-
I was able to salvage it nicely with the addition of minced, sauteed onion and garlic, about a quarter cup of cream cheese and a handful of defrosted sweet peas.  My kids liked it a lot and were disappointed there wasn't seconds.

This was good; however, I would omit the nutmeg. I think this was too much nutmeg and it carried a powerful taste that my husband did not care for too much.  I liked it but could not say it was the best creamed spinach I've had.  I think if I omit this, it'll do.  Thank you!

Gave this 5 stars thanks to ABoston's suggestions.  I also added the juice of 1/2 a lemon which sent it over the top.  Even my picky kids asked for seconds.  I could eat this several times a week!  Just like the creamed spinach at all the Italian restaurants on the East Coast.

I like this recipe, but I had to make some changes due to what I had on hand.  I chopped a small shallot and sauteed that with some garlic in some butter and olive oil.  I don't always measure stuff so I just wing it. I didn't have heavy cream, so I concocted some from reading what other reviewers suggested by mixing 3/4 cup milk (2%) and 1/4 cup melted butter.  I added a TBSP of flour and a couple shakes of nutmeg and let it thicken, then I added a 16 ox box of fresh spinach.  My husband loved it!!  I will be making this again, but I will use real heavy cream next time.  It was really good!

As written it is as many have said soupy. Add the 1/4 Cup cream extra and 1/4 cup grated parmesan. I found 1/4 tsp of nutmeg just about right. The onions and clove of garlic sauted in 1 T. of butter worked well. Also added 1 T of flour mixed into enough cream to smoothly incorporate. Went well with some cured thick cut pork chops and au gratin broccoli and rice Oh, and both kids ate it !! Thanks!

I did tinker with this recipe as others suggested.  Turned out delicious.  As you might guess,  it's a bit of 3 steps forward for eating your veggies and 7 steps backward for all the delicious creamy goodness.  So, have your cholesterol checked first, then enjoy!

I have used this recipe twice and both times it needed a little tweeking. This is pretty good, they lost a star for forgetting the garlic and also for how many pans they used. We used one pan. Started the garlic (1 clove) then the sauce and threw the spinach in over med-low heat. I used a 1/4 teaspoon flour for thickener but I probably could have used half that (used this when I made a half batch).

The sauce was good, the problem was chopping up the spinach in the food processor.  It came out way to fine even after just one or two pulses.  When I added it to the sauce it just blended in, for additional texture I added steamed whole spinach leaves.  I think that if I make it again I'll omit the chopping and mix in whole spinach.

This was excellent. Even my kids liked it. Next time I'll back off on the salt--as the sauce cooked down, it ended up too salty, but still very good. I'll definitely make this again.

Good recipe, but needs some onion and/or garlic if a person likes and can have garlic. I can't. I would saute and carmelize the onion for more flavor. When I make this I chop the spinach first not after it's cooked. Just use a knife to do it, no need to drag out the food processor.

We love this recipe; my 3 yr old often requests it. We use frozen spinach and it works well. Don't change a thing.

"MSCOUGAR",you are the "cat's meow." This recipe rocks! Next time I will reduce the nutmeg and heavy cream by half as it was a bit too spicy and the 1/2 1/2 pooled in the spinach after cooking although I squeezed it dry before putting it in with the rest. The taste was "the bomb." Never had spinach W/nutmeg before. A real treat. At LEAST five stars. - Thanx...Elfhelp...

yummy! I added a crushed clove of garlic and 1/4 cup grated onion to melted butter before mixing in the cream, etc. I also used one box of frozen spinach instead of fresh.

This recipe is excellent!  I used fat-free evaporated milk in place of the cream specified.  I specifically made this recipe to be used in conjunction with Chef John's Spinach Toast.  This was a perfect recipe to use for the Toast and was well received at my dinner table!

Thanks for the great recipe.

As written, this recipe would have been very bland, but (as the other reviewers stated) it is a good base recipe. I took other reviewers' advice and used frozen spinach, added a little flour and extra cream to thicken the sauce, added half a chopped onion, and 2 cloves of garlic. I also halved the nutmeg, and added garlic and onion powders. The nutmeg was still pretty strong, but it was good. Even though it came out alright, I think it was missing depth or richness. Maybe next time I'll use salted butter, and add some cream cheese or some shredded 6 cheese italian blend.

i added sauteed chopped onion & garlic, used 2% milk instead of cream.  YUM.  only advice - avoid the food processor!  steaming is good enough; processing will turn your spinach to soup.

Delicious.  I didn't have fresh spinach so I used frozen spinach that I defrosted and got all the water out of.  Turned out great.

I'm giving it 4 stars because I didn't follow the recipe exact, but it turned out delicious!  I chopped the spinach before cooking by hand.  I sauted a little bit of onion, added cream, butter, 1/2 of nutmeg, and salt.  (I had to substitute milk/butter for heavy cream since I didn't have any on hand).  I also added cream cheese.  Brought the mixture to a boil while the spinach was steaming.  Added it all together, brought to boil, added parm cheese on top and . . . yummy!

As written, I found it rather bland, hence the 3 stars.  With suggested changes from other reviewers (saute onion and garlic, parm cheese) it was a 5 star.  Will certainly make again.

I love spinach, and creamed spinach is my all time favorite, this recipe made it so easy that I will no longer by the boil in the bag type. I chopped my spinach prior to steaming; I just thought that was easier, I also used fresh grated nutmeg. Delicious

Simple to make, tasty. I agree that the nutmeg flavor is the key here. Otherwise it would just be runny creamed spinach!

To add more flavor the cream sauce I added 2 cloves of fresh garlic.

I've waited awhile to review this recipe to give it a couple of days to determine if I liked it or not and I think I did - but the jury is still out.  I had some difficulty with having the cream sauce stick to the spinach - when serving the spinach was on the plate and the thin cream sauce just oozed off the spinach onto everything else on the plate - pretty unappetizing.  I think I will try this recipe again - perhaps I did something wrong.

Tasty flavor.  Mine turned out very liquidy though.  Next time I'll either cut back on the cream or will put in a lot more spinach.

I thought this recipe was awful.  I love spinach but my boyfriend does not and I htought with a creamy sauce it would be more tolerable.  Well there was hardly any sauce and no taste.  And how did they think this would make 4 servings?

I added some mushrooms and onion I sauteed which made it much better.  And I love spinach so the recult was good.  But don't spend your time making this, it's not good.
