To add  flavor, I sautéed chicken breast in poultry seasoning and Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute. Then I sautéed two cloves garlic, diced, in a double portion of butter and added a double portion of lemon juice. Finally, I substituted garlic powder with garlic salt. These changes created a tastier, more aggressively seasoned dish. Even my husband, who usually doesn't like lemon dishes, really liked it.

I used fresh lemon peel and juice along with fresh garlic and I browned whole boneless chicken breasts because the meat stays moist. I also added chicken stock to the lemon, marjoram, garlic, parsley, and butter then reduced the sauce. This was very good a new favorite.

I made this tonight for dinner using all the ingredients listed except Marjoram because I don't have any (and really don't know what that taste is like). I did add some Thyme in place of the marjoram and altered the amounts of the ingredients to our taste along with adding some chicken broth to the lemon etc and then some Parmesan. It turned out really good and very easy to make. A light meal for sure!

Followed the recipe with one change. My mother can't handle pasta in her diet so made it and spooned it on top of a bed of spaghetti squash. It was fantastic!  There were no left overs. ??

It was very easy and quick. It needed a little "something" though.  Maybe more garlic or some salt. .. I'll certainly make it again though.

I added more chicken, spinach and  tons more lemon juice and even lemon zest to this recipe, but it still lacked flavor.  I love lemon flavor, but it still wasn't quite right.  I tried salt and more of the garlic and marjoram too.  I will try it again and keep tweaking it.  I love how healthy it is!  It tasted so fresh with the fresh parsley and spinach, so I did like that part.

We liked the flavor but it was pretty dry. I think next time I will add some chicken broth and mix all the non-pasta ingredients together first and then toss with pasta.

I really enjoyed this, though my husband said it tasted "too healthy." I think for him, there was too much lemon, but I love lemon. I would make this again.

This pasta was a hit even with my super picky hubby. We topped it with Parmesan cheese, but I'm thinking to use Asiago cheese with it next time.

I'd add butter and lemon juice.  Also, it's really good with garlic cloves.

Added Roma tomatoes chopped and fresh spinach, Marinated the chicken. Cooked the chicken in some of the marinade with 4 cloves fresh garlic. Added the juice from cooking the chicken into a bowl and grilled the chicken. Added the chicken, and some of the chicken juice as well as the Lemon juice. I also added some fresh parmesan cheese and crushed red pepper to spice it up a little.

Used fresh garlic instead of powder, and dried fine herbs because I didn't have parsley and marjoram. Kids loved it!

I made this but I felt that the pasta needed SOMETHING! A sauce or some type of liquid. Any suggestions I open. Otherwise, the chicken turned out great!

Fast, edible, but next time I will double the Lemon and the spices.  I did saute my chicken in EVOO and salt and pepper.  Next time I will add twice as much parsley and add some freshly grated reggiano parmesan to top.

Lots of bright flavored, light, simple and quick, and delicious. I didn't have dried marjoram, so I used oregano instead.

Eats like light, fresh comfort food. Add more lemon if you want it to be a prominent flavor.
