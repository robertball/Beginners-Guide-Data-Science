Delicious!  I have been testing various recipes for my Daytona 500 NASCAR party and these ribs made the grade.   My taste testers all gave them two thumbs up.  The one thing I did do differently is to season the ribs, wrap them tightly in plastic wrap and let them sit in the refrigerator overnight.   Another trick is to add one ice cube to each of the foil packages, it helps to keep the meat tender and juicy.   A winning recipe.  Thanks!
