Quick and easy.  Can't find Cinnamon Chips in stores and needed it faster than ordering on line.  This is so easy and I usually have ingredients on hand I will just make it myself  :)

Fantastic in cinnamon scones!  I did notice that after 35 min at 225 in the oven they weren't quite done, so I baked them for an additional 5 min at 300 and they were perfect.

After going to 4 stores looking for cinnamon chips, which nobody had, I was very glad to find this recipe!  I used butter instead of shortening because that was what I had.  It came out softer than I expected - more like fruit leather consistency, I was expecting something closer to a brittle.  Maybe that's because of the butter?  Either way, I'm sure they will work fine in the recipe I will be making.  Next time, I may try bringing the ingredients to a boil on the stovetop and see if that results in a firmer texture.

Didn't like them at all, very different ingredients than the cinnamon chips from King Arthur Flour.  To me they tasted like greasy sugar with cinnamon.  Too bad they aren't made any more
