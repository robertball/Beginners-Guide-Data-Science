When I told Hubs of my plan to make this he asked that I still make our stand-by vegetable dip as well - "just in case" is how I interpreted that.  As it turns out, the stand-by wasn't necessary. We both loved this welcome change from the ubiquitous ranch-style vegetable dip.  Out of personal preference I substituted sour cream for the yogurt.

This was so good!  It was far more mild than I expected, which was perfect for the husband.  I also only had dried dill, so I made it early and let it sit.  It was wonderful!!

This was execellent! I spiced it up since that is our personal preference by increasing the horseradish and doubling the mustard and chives. I also added a sprinkling of mozzarella cheese and fresh chives on top as a garnish. I will make this again.

This was just what I was looking for!  This is an awesome dipping sauce for French Fried Portebella Mushrooms (I'll submit that recipe)... I didn't have fresh dill on hand but dried worked fine!  Delightful...

I increased the horseradish to two tablespoons, that was the only change I made. HOLY FRIJOLES--is this GOOD! The kids didn't care for it but my husband and I can't stop eating it! Especially excellent with sliced fresh cucumbers.

Yum, this was great!  I made it to serve with some parmesan-crusted sweet potato fries.  I used wasabi instead of horseradish.  It had a good flavor and a good kick that would go well a number of things.

This dip is outstanding!!!! I used greek yogurt, and added an extra tbsp of Dijon, and a tsp of garlic powder. Added a bit more horseradish too, since we love it so much! Thanks for the recipe!

Although I LOVE horseradish, it seemed to be a bit overpowering in this recipe. And I also felt like it needed some other spices ... garlic, maybe?

This is great - I used nonfat Greek style yogurt.  I was surprised the horseradish flavor was so mild - it's there, but not overwhelming.  Very nice!

Tangy and spicy and not as fattening as most other recipes. Delicious!
