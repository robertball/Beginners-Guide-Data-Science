I'm the first one to admit that I typically don't like recipes using canned soup, but this is the exception.  This took less than 10 minutes to get into the oven, and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  I used Pepperidge Farm herbed seasoned stuffing mix, and when I opened the oven door, it smelled like Thanksgiving.  I can see adding a little bit of sage to the soup-wine mixture in the future.  Please don't skip the wine, as it really does add flavor to the sauce.  I may try reconstituting the dried cranberries a little in hot water because they did dry out pretty well during the baking process.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, it's going into my favorites folder.

This recipe is great.  I had to use cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken, pizza cheese (part mozarella) instead of mozarella and raisins instead of cranberries (I did have a few crans on hand.  It was gret although it took about an hour to cook.  I can't wait until I do the "official" recipe.

This was good but like others said a little on the salty side. Next time I will make sure I use low sodium soup. Didnt really think the cheese was necessary. I might try it with cheddar next time. When I reheated it I out some pepper and red pepper cause it was a little sweet but I will def be making it again

Definitely will make again! Husband wasn't picky about measuring the cheese or craisins, which was fine with me. I might try it with different kinds of cheese and see what happens -- though the mozz was fabulous! Subbed water for wine and used frozen chicken which required extra 10-15 minutes cook time. Leftovers the next day were great too! We're big eaters, so we did need another side in addition to salad, but we just made extra stuffing. Light eaters shouldn't need anything else but salad. Can't wait to make it again.

This recipe was really good.  Of course, I modified it a little.  I browned the chicken in some olive oil with Club House Italiano and Garlic Plus seasonings, and then cut the baking time in the oven to 25 minutes.  I also put extra stuffing mix and cranberries.  Hubby loved it, so in the receipe box it goes!

this is baking in my oven as I type.  I don't cook with canned soup as I don't think it is healthy.  However, I boiled a cup of chicken stock in a box and added 1/2 cup half and half to the stock with a tbsp of corn starch whisked in.  I didn't have white wine so I bravely added 1/4 cup of organic red wine.  After that thickened I poured it over the chicken cutlets that were covered in the mozzarella cheese.  I then followed the directions as written and baked at 325 on the convection roast setting.  I am so hoping it turns out despite my brave alterations!

This was really tasty!  I made it as written, except I used shredded cheddar because it's what I had on-hand.  I might cut down a bit on the butter next time and use two tablespoons instead of four.  This recipe tasted just like Thanksgiving!!  It's a keeper!

This is WONDERFUl!! Easy and amazing!  I did not alter the recipe at all! We both loved this! The stuffing and cranberries really made me think of the comforts of a Thanksgiving meal. 45 minutes cooked this to perfection.  ...Dont understand why people were saying this was too salty... I am sensative to salt and did not have any trouble.  We Will be having this often :):)

It was okay.  I added more cranberries than it called for, and I could have also added more stuffing.  The chicken itself came out drier than ideal.   Really, I think I could get the same taste by just adding cranberries to box-mix stuffing.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I am a new cook and this recipe was easy to follow and looks great when complete. I thought the cranberries were a nice touch. I always liked cranberry sauce with my turkey on thanksgiving so the recipe wasn't a leap for me at all. Would recommend and have already made twice.

I made this last night and am still wondering why it's called cranberry chicken when there's only a few dried cranberries on it.  Well, I can see how people could like it, there's interesting flavors.  I used more cranberries and stuffing than required, but it still tasted a little off to me.  I think I would try it again with a different type of soup.

This was amazing. We made this last minute for a "Christmas" with our friends, and it was a big hit. Sweetend Craisens add a nice flavour, and we used smoked gouda in place of the mozzerella. A definite new favourite!!

Delicious! I had to make a few changes because of diets and ingredients on hand. First, I seasoned the chicken with McCormick's Seasoned Pepper. I used fat free Parmesam instead of the mozzarella and low fat/low sodium cream of chicken soup. I used Pepperidge Farm Herb Seasoned stuffing mix and I didn't have the cranberries so I drained a can of pineapple chuncks, squeezed out as much liquid as I could with paper towels and threw them in the chopper. Completely omitted the butter. All in all it was a huge hit! The wine added a GREAT flavor!

OMG! We really enjoyed this. The only change I made was to use swiss cheese instead of mozzarella.  Next time I'll try asigo and will add 1/2 cup of chicken stock to the soup mixture so it's a little more sauce-like and can be used over the balance of the stuffing mix (I cut the water to a cup). Will definitely make this again.

First time making this and it turned out marvelous!! Followed the recipe, but added sliced mushrooms on top of the chicken. Also added some sage to the chicken as well and I added double of the stuffing and doubled the butter. Delicious!  I served it with some baby red potatoes (boiled and slightly pressed them on a cookie sheet, drizzled with olive oil, parsley, salt and pepper) and baked them at 350 in the oven for about 15 mins.

Very tasty! 
I love fast easy recipes and this was both!
I skipped the cheese, but added cranberries to the soup mixture ...added cut up mushrooms to the chicken to add a veggie...Then added extra cranberry and stuffing on top.
It turned out great! 
Nice sweet and savory the chicken cooked perfectly and the stuffing was kinda crunchy and buttery!
Great easy all in one meal

Yummy! I soaked cranberries in warm cranberry juice for a few minutes. I used lower sodium stuffing and healthy request cream of chicken soup. My son loved it and he’s not a big fan of chicken.

I used thin chicken breasts and they cooked in about 40 mins. The cranberries would probably be better in the sauce, so they have some moisture. I used Crasins and they came out a little crispy. I think overall the recipe is easy so it makes it a quick meal. Didn’t really taste the cheese..

Great recipe, easy and fast to make. We had larger chicken breasts, so I added a little more of everything. Mine were finished in 43 minutes.

We enjoyed this for dinner tonight and it was enjoyed. I had four large chicken breast so I cooked this for an hour. I put the cranberries on top of the chicken along with a cup of chopped apples and then put the soup/wine on top of chicken so the fruit was nice and plump. I put fresh mozzarella cheese in it but next time will leave out. It doesn't add to it and just adds extra calories and there is enough in this.

this recipe was absolutely delicious... I used cream of mushroom because that's what I had and used more stuffing (because who doesn't want more stuffing?) definitely making this again

I used a whole box of stuffing mix putting 1/2 of the mix on top of the chicken and then the soup mix , then the rest of the stuffing mix and then the butter on top.  I also used 1/2 Cup of chicken broth instead of the white wine.  Sweet potatoes are good as a side dish.  Put some raw broccoli in the bottom of the dish with the chicken as a second veggie.

I made this for company. It came out well. The chicken was moist and the stuffing (I used cornbread stuffing) added a nice crunch. Served with buttermilk biscuits and salad.

Delicious!   I added extra wine as I thought the bread crumbs might need a little extra liquid.  Turned out to be the perfect combination of just enough crunch!   It has a nice tangy flavor. The kids say it's a keeper!

This recipe caught my eye because it sounded like a good way to use up some left over ingredients from my Thanksgiving grocery shopping.  I followed the recipe except for not measuring the cheese, stuffing, & cranberries.  I'm sure I used more than called for.  My family gives this one a thumbs up so I will make it again.  It's super easy and looked kind of pretty with the cranberries on top.  Add a veggie or salad and dinner is done.

Amazingly easy, Amazingly tasty! This recipe is a keeper. I did double the soup and wine so there was a bit more of the sauce to top the mashed potatoes I made with it. It was so tasty on top of the potatoes. Rave reviews from my family! Even my husband...he hates stuffing. The cranberries were such a fantastic addition. We love the flavor they add. I will probably add more next time just because they tasted great with it! Definitely a keeper!

Easy and very tasty.  I did not use wine, I am sure that would have tasted great but I did not want to open a bottle to use 1/4 cup and then be tempted to drink more - trying to watch my calories!  I probably should have diluted the soup with something else but I didn't and it still tasted very good.  Loved the cranberries in this recipe!  I will fix this again!

Was not sure about using cranberries with chicken but I did try it and it was a huge hit. Husband had seconds. Very moist. Will cook this again.
