This recipe was delicious. I changed a few things though. Instead of day old french bread I used fresh Chala bread. I added blueberries and only left it in the fridge for 2 hours. The end result was fantastic. I will definetly be making it again.

I was very pleased with how this turned out.  Like others have suggested I used 6 eggs and 1 and 1/2 cups of milk, and dredged the bread in the liquid before pouring the rest over.  Because it is apple season, I used some Granny Smith apples in place of the peaches and it was DELICIOUS!  The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because it was VERY sweet and some may not care for that.  You definitely do not need syrup.  I think using the day-old bread is key to avoid the sogginess others have mentioned.

This was fantastic!  I also added the extra milk and egg-and found it was plenty moist.  I used fresh peaches instead of the canned and took a tip from the barefoot contessa and used challah bread, with pecans on the top.  I served it with a bit of maple syrup drizzled on the top. EVERYONE at my baby shower asked for the recipe!  :)

WOW! This is hands-down excellent. I made this for a Mother's Day breakfast -it was a huge hit! I was a bit leery of the canned peaches, but one taste of the final product and those concerns evaporated. I soaked both sides of the bread prior to placing on top of peaches. Another minor alteration to the basic recipe that I made (because so many reviewers mentioned how sweet this dish is) was after draining I quickly ran water over the peaches to remove any excess syrup. I don't know if that actually altered the flavor (since this is the first, and only, time I've made this recipe) but it was plenty sweet and simply couldn't have been better. Even my husband, who is pretty stingy on the compliments, raved. Put this one in your recipe box. Oh so yummy.

One of my sisters sent this recipe to me about a year ago.  I've made it many times since.  If  could give this 10 stars I would.  Don't let the overnight stay in the fridge scare you, I've done it both ways, the night before and morning of and they are both fantastic.  One time I even forgot the peaches and it was STILL Great!  I used a French baguette and slice it about 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick, and because we like it "eggier" I use 7 eggs (have even used egg substitute with success) and a dash more vanilla and a dash or two more of cinnamon. This is a great dish for overnight company, holiday brunches, and it's even been requested for dinner!  Today I made it and I had some peach brandy on hand and added about 3 tablespoons to the sugar & butter mixture while it was cooking. To DIE FOR.  Thanks for this new family favorite! I made it again for a brunch at work today and everyone RAVED and wanted the recipe.  I don't understand the reviews saying to add milk, I don't add ANY milk, it's not in the original recipe, I just add an extra egg or two and it's perfect.  Milk will make it soggy.

This was very good and well-received.  The peaches were good, but I think next time I will try it without.  A NOTE:  Be sure to add the milk (I doubled the recipe and used 2 1/2 cups), otherwise the bread will be waaaay too dry!

Delicious!  I used 6 eggs and 1 1/2 c. milk as suggested.  I bought the bread the same day so I dried it a bit in the oven.  I also used frozen peaches and a bit of nutmeg and cinnamon mixed into the egg mixture.  Finished it on convection to get a crispy brown top.  Yummy

Great recipe.  Will use over and over again.  Great for weekends.  I agree with others about adding and extra egg or two and milk.  Nice twist with the peaches, but would be good without as well.  Thanks.

We are the new hospitality committee for our apartment community and after 3 years of breakfast tacos we decided a change was in order.  This was a hit, everyone raved about it and it was the first to go!  I did add an extra egg and I used the peach juice instead of water.  I will dredge next time as suggested, but what a great flavor!

This was wonderful!  I took the advice of others and added an extra egg and some milk, and also dipped both sides of the bread before putting into the pan.  Everyone loved it and no leftovers!!

Very tasty. Added a block of cream cheese, cut into pieces and sprinkled in the bread layer. It cut some of the sweetness and made a "peaches and cream" version. Loved it.

I don't give 5 stars too often, but this recipe was definitely deserving of the highest rating. I made it exactly as the recipe dictated abnd it was delicious. I do wish it had stuck to the break more (the peaches were loose im the bottom of the pan) but other than that it was amazing. The brown sugar mixture made the bread melt in your mouth. Just make sure the bread is covered in the egg mixure.  This keeps it from drying out and gives it a buttery flavor. I will try this again with apples!

I halved the recipe for two people and used Love’s Sweet Bread in place of French bread. I let it sit for a several hours instead of overnight before baking. As I made the brown sugar butter sauce I used the juices of the peach in place of the water called for in the recipe. Also, instead of a pinch of cinnamon I sprinkled a little more over all the bread. I baked the French toast for about 30 minutes then took it out. I topped the french toast with homemade, “Whipped Cream,” by paula from this website. The outside of the bread has a nice crispy edge while the inside is soft. We especially love the brown sugar sauce and cinnamon coating. The sweetness was just right, nothing too “sugary”. No one asked for any syrup; there was enough brown sugar sauce and cinnamon flavor on the French toast. Delicious, fresh tasting and perfect for a late Sunday morning breakfast! Thank you for sharing.

This french toast is so easy to make and is sooooooo good.  I used the extra egg and 1.5 cups milk as previously suggested.  I also chopped the peach slices into smaller pieces.  Very easy to serve this way. The key to NOT having soggy french toast is to cook this uncovered.

I love this recipe! I added one more step. I flipped the entire pan on a lipped sheet pan. Peach upside down french toast.

Amazing!  I went exactly by the recipe and it was perfect.  I did, however, cut up the bread into 1" pieces rather than using a whole slice of bread and mixed everything prior to the overnight refridgeration.  This seemed to eliminate the dryness.  I've been making this recipe for at least the past year and everyone always loves it.  Perfect for showers, holiday breakfasts and just a good ole' Sunday breakfast.....and the best part is it's simple!  Enjoy!

Cut the sugar totally and just pour enough maple syrup in the bottom of the 9 x 13 to coat it.  Yes, buy organic real maple syrup.  You will be glad you did.

Yum!  I substituted the peaches with a 24 oz jar of chunky peach/apple sauce and mixed it with the eggs before pouring it over the bread.

Very good!  But like many others I made a few small changes based on personal preference, time and ingredients I had on hand.  I scaled it down to 4 servings and used 5 slices of wheat bread (dried them in the oven for about 10 min) and two fresh peaches that I peeled and chopped into small chunks.  I did add a splash of milk to the egg/vanilla mixture and coated both sides of the whole wheat bread slices before cutting each slice into 9 small pieces.  I topped the chopped peaches with the bread pieces and poured the remaining egg mixture over the top.  Sprinkled with a little cinnamon and put in the oven uncovered for 30 min.  Cut into 6 square servings and drizzled the brown sugar/butter sauce from bottom of baking dish over the top before serving. Mmmm!

What a great way to start the weekend! It was like having a Bed & Breakfast experience right at home! Very tasty! I had most the ingredients on hand, but no french bread. Instead I used about a half loaf of regular bread, cut into smaller pieces. I bet the french bread would have been even better, but still very scrumptious!

This is the best baked french toast recipe i've ha and made.  My husband was not a fan of peaches but this changed his mind!!  This is great for large groups since you make it the night before. I've switched the peaches and used bananas, almonds ( almond extract and slivered almonds), and just left out the peaches and added nothing. all were  awesome.  One suggestion, if your bread isn't a little dried out cut back on the milk!!! you have to try this!!! YUMMY!!!

This was delicious!  I used 4 and 1/2 c. of fresh sliced peaches instead of the canned, and other than that, I followed the recipe.  I added 5 minutes to the baking time, since I was using fresh peaches.  The fresh peaches really made it taste almost like a peach cobbler.  Yum, yum!  I will be making this again, especially due to the convenience of assembly the night before.  Great for guests!

love this! it saves so much time and is not nearly as messy as doing it individually on a griddle.  i used regular sliced bread and didn't wait overnight, and it came out great. i tried it for the 1st time and my guests loved it! i added some walnuts on the bottom.  the 2nd time i tried it i let the brown sugar simmer too long it got too thick.

This was very good, especially with fresh peaches!  We sliced 6 large peaches and kept the slices thick knowing they would reduce when baking.  I also made homemade buttermilk bread in my bread machine and used 7 eggs and a bit extra vanilla.  Delicious!  My family requested more fresh peaches for a topper though!

I just put this into my recipe box, but I'm thinking when I make it, I'd like to try it as two 8x8 pans.  When serving, I'd like to flip it like a pineapple upside down cake.  On its surface, it does sound like the bread would need some milk to moisten it up.  It also seems a shame to drain the peaches.  Perhaps a combination of peach liquid and milk added to the bread overnight would be good. Maybe some chopped nuts/slivered almonds?  I can see how the possibilities are endless.  I'm giving it five stars even though I haven't made it yet, because it won't allow me not to rate, and I don't think it's fair to slight it before I ever try it.

Great recipe!  No leftovers when I made it.  One thing I did different was not leave in fridge overnight--made it all the same morning, didn't want to wait.  Turned out great. Thanks!

This was a HUGE hit with my large overnight crowd.  I dredged the (italian) bread as instructed by other members and added the additional egg/milk.  I cut back on the brown sugar just a litte and this was still quite sweet. I may experiment with amount of brown sugar to cut the sweetness even more.  I added blueberries along with the peaches and they created a wonderful blueberry sauce on the bottom.  We had left overs that we heated in the microwave and topped with vanilla ice cream.... TO DIE FOR!   Great, EASY, fast recipe - a definite keeper!  Thanks.

Awesome recipe.  Best part, quick and easy to prepare.  I did read many reviews before, and took some tips from them.  Used only 2/3 cup brown sugar, used peach juice instead of water, used fresh peaches instead of canned (although the juice was from the canned peaches) and dipped the bread in the egg mixture instead of pouring over.  Had just the right amount of sweetness, and was not mushy AT ALL like some others had seen.  Will be making this for my family reunion brunch this coming weekend

I made half the recipe (2 whole eggs and 1 white, everything else half) which was plenty for 2 people. It was delicious! Some of the peaches sort of dissolved in the cooking process... I think it will be even better with fresh peaches which are just now coming in season. Well worth making!

I had some leftover challah and some overripe peaches so this was the perfect recipe for me. Like others, I cut the brown sugar - no more than 2/3 cup is needed, used 6 eggs and 1 1/2 cups of milk. It was too much liquid - next time I'll use just 1 cup. I also soaked the bread before adding to the pan. This tasted more like bread pudding than French toast, but it was good and the peaches added a nice twist.

Just made this for Easter and took most suggestions, i.e. adding more eggs and milk. However, one caveat: DO NOT ADD blueberries! I used  peaches and added blueberries which was a huge mistake. It turns everything gray and very unappetizing when cooked! No one wanted to eat it until I told them what it was. The taste was delicious, but it looks gross. Stick with peaches or strawberries, but not blueberries!
Also, despite the fact that I added 1 c. milk and dredged the bread, I still thought it was a little dry in place. I think the fruit on top would have been better, as someone suggested.

Used sweet Italian bread and only let it soak for about 10 minutes, but made sure all of the bread was coated by tipping the pan.  Gave it a five because it still came out great even with the short soak time.  This made the top nice and crispy.  Husband loved it.

Simple, delicious, and CHEAP. I spent less than 3 dollars to make the whole thing and it fed 8 people. Diced the peaches so they covered the dish better. Other than that, didnt change a thing!

This is heavenly!! I doubled the recipe for five people. I was only able to fit 8 slices of bread in each 9x13. Not sure if your suppose to stack them to get all 12 in or what. I did not soak overnight just let it soak for 1 hr  after prep. in the a.m. and it was perfect. This will for sure become a regular for us. Thanks

This was wonderful!  I addded an extra egg right before cooking because it was looking dry.  I also added some milk along with the eggs, and some walnuts.  The walnuts were good but not great so I think I'll leave them out next time.  I used fresh peaches and it turned out great!  I will definitely be making this again.
Made this again using a combo of fresh peaches and blueberries and it was even better!

only gave 4 stars because after beating the eggs and vanilla together i saw that there just wasn't enough liquid to be absorbed into the bread. i added 1 cup milk to the egg mixture and poured it over challah ( i removed the crust first).  with that change it was FANTASTIC!!  next time i make it for a group i'll make 2, because no one got to have seconds!

Very good! I followed what the other reviews said and added 6 eggs and 1 1/2 cups of milk. It was runny. This is the only time I have tried it so maybe the original way would be 5 stars. Next time I will try 5 eggs and 3/4 cup of milk. I can see where the milk is needed so I will keep some of it. It was very tasty though.

This was unbelievably good!! My whole family loved it! I made this for dinner and like others I dunked the bread in my egg mixture (which I also added a cup and a half of milk to). I didn't pour any of the mixture over the top after dunking the bread I placed the cut pieces over the peaches and baked for twenty minutes and then flipped the French toast and baked for another ten minutes. I served it by ladling some of the pan juices over top. YUM!

This recipe was yummy!!! I only have one complaint, which is that the crust of the bread ended up being pretty hard. I wanted to add one more egg, because the egg mixture didn't cover the entire tops of the bread. I followed the recipe exactly though. Only adjusting the time by about 5 minutes because my oven tends to bake hotter/faster. The recipe really was very tasty though!!! And pretty easy!!! I loved it! And so did my family, and the friend we had over.

Very yummy:)  Used expired Texas Toast I'd been keeping in fridge, so a bit soggy on bottom layer since soft.  Added more eggs & milk.  Used fresh peaches & put cinnamon & lil nutmeg in the syrup at base, in batter & atop along with pecans.  Will do with wheat to get some fiber into breakfast!

It was very good.  We used homemade thick cut wheat bread and worked just fine.  Used the 6 eggs and 1 cup milk, and dipped the bread before putting in the pan.  I would recommend it.  I thought the sweetness was fine.  One thing I will try next time is the peaches and sauce came out runnier than I would have liked.  Next time I will drain the peaches in a strainer and allow them to dry more.  Overall, I loved it.  Very tasty.

Enjoy!  I made a few changes, added an egg and some milk.  Sprinkle the bread slices with cinnamon and then cube.  Mix into egg milk, vanilla mixture, let sit while I prepare the brown sugar (used only 1/2 cup) and butter (1/4 cup). It is peach season, so I sliced fresh peaches.  This is so delightful, you could serve it as dessert.

I followed the suggestions of other reviewers, adding an egg and 1.5c milk.(I reserved almost 1c of milk/egg mixture to pour over the top the next morning because of all the comments about it being too dry.) This was too much and made it soggy. It was also VERY sweet. Next time I will use half the brown sugar and while I will dip the bread, I will only add 1 egg and 3/4c milk (reserving only 1/4c of milk/egg mixture for next morning).

Nice because it's easy and can be done the night before. Had to use canned peaches and I think that's what made it only 4 stars. Fresh fruit (any kind) would work better in this recipe.

Great flavor.  I used fresh peaches and cinnamon raisin bread instead of French bread.

This was really good! The only thing I would change would be to double up on the peaches and use half the brown sugar, adding some of the juice from the peaches as the other part of the sweetner. I served this on Christmas morning and it was a hit!

This was very good.  I used 6 eggs instead of 5 and I used far more cinnamon than the recipe called for - which I'm glad I did.  My son said it's a "Keeper", so it'll be a breakfast for special occasions.  I think I'll double the syrup next time - that really set things off for the family.

This recipe is delicious and oh-so=easy to make! I was in charge of a large woman's retreat recently and prepared this for breakfast. I couldn't believe how many ladies begged me for the recipe which I happily gave them. The only thing I did different was chop the peaches into more manageable bite-size pieces. This one is a definite keeper!

I love this, easy and delicious.

I used amaretto in place of the vanilla (2TBSP) and mixed in dark molasses with the brown sugar.  I left off the cinnamon, didn't need it, but added in 1/4 cup of cream cheese.  

I used an extra can of peaches too, we liked a high ratio of peaches to bread.  There wasn't enough liquid, so I kept mixing up extra eggs, milk and liquor until I had enough to really saturate the bread, I wanted it to be light and fluffy at the end instead of dry and crisp (it was a little too crispy the first time I made it, still tasty though).

Love It!!!! I too added the milk and extra egg. The only other change I made was ripping my bread into chunks and then pouring it over with the egg mixture in a bowl and then putting it over my peaches. I tried this after making it the first time with the pieces whole and getting the soggy texture. This worked much better for me and seemed to distribute the egg mixture perfectly. I sprinkle with powder sugar and YUM YUM YUM!!!

Wonderful recipe. The second time I made it, I used sliced apples. folding them into the syrup so they wouldn't turn brown. I also used 7 eggs and 1/2 cup half and half - dipping both sides of the bread as another reader suggested.  Had many requests for the recipe - great for overnight guests. Think I like the apple even better than the peach.

It was excellent--but I made a major change by adding 1 1/2 cups of milk to the egg--and cooking it 15 minutes longer. This would probably help in the instances where people felt it was too dry. I will make it this way again. Thanks for the recipe!

This was awesome.  I tried it last weekend for my husband and we loved it.  I wanted to try it out before making it for my folks tomorrow for Father's Day breakfast.  I inadvertently misread the recipe and bought fresh peaches instead of canned and because I didn't have quite enough I also used some fresh strawberries I had at home.  The combination was wonderful.  For this weekend however I bought the canned cling peaches and no strawberries so that I could follow the recipe exactly.  I'm guessing that if you don't care for peaches you can use other fruits as well including Rhubarb or other berries.  This was an absolute keeper.  Thank you so much for sharing.

Uber duber good! When it came out of the oven, I thought "this doesn't look that impressive" but after a bite...oh, so, good. 
Forgot Cinnamon, but it was fine without it. Will add it next time. Same with whipped cream.
I halved the recipe, and it works great as a breakfast for two.

I was so excited to try this recipe, and it was good. But WAY too sweet! I think I'll half the sugar in the recipe next time. I could even finish my serving because it was so sweet. Other than that I liked it.

I did something wrong, and it didn't set up well. I didn't follow the original directions but someone's comment. However, I salvage by taking it out and frying each piece.  The next day, I took a piece and put some syrup on it and my husband took it in his lunch.  He said that was the best dessert ever!  He absolutely raved over it and is still talking about it today.  That is solely the reason for the five stars.

Great recipe! I did not use peaches, as I did not have any. Also, I cut the recipe in half and layered the breads on top of each other in a smaller dish. Like a few commenters above me, I used Challah bread and added milk to the egg mixture. Came out great! Will make this again.

My initial thought that this would be like a caserole-type dish is incorrect.  I also didn't have enough eggs for the recipe so I had to make a second batch.

I didn't let this recipe sit in the fridge overnight.  I just baked it as soon as I was done putting everything together.  It was still pretty darn good, quick and easy to make.  I didn't have peaches so I used some mcintosh apples.  I also only used regular whole grain wheat bread.  This is a great alternative to cereal or regular french toast for breakfast.  Me and my 19 mth old son ate over half the pan in one sitting!!!

I "left" this recipe out for DH to make it for Mother's Day this year. I halved the recipe (used 3 eggs, four slices of bread, as that's what fit the pan) and had him use strawberries instead of peaches. This was wonderful! The caramel-like sauce at the bottom of the pan was scrumptious! We had one slice leftover and was equally delicious the following day! We kept the aluminum cover on while baking and only took it off for the last 10-15 min. Maybe that's why it was not hard on top?

I have to say this was an absolute hit!  I took the dish to a morning time function and people wanted seconds of it...while other things were left untouched.  I did change it a bit though according to a few other suggestions.  I used two cans of peaches instead of one, and sprinkled some sliced almonds on top of the brown sugar mixture.  I also added 1/2 cup milk to the egg mixture with 6 egges instead of 5...and soaked the bread as I laid it on the peaches, the poured my extra on top...it turned out wonderful.  Will be a "Do-over"

I can't go back to regular French toast after this! It was so good. Using what I had, I used a 15 oz can of peaches and frozen blueberries: it was a fabulous combination! I did add a little milk & nutmeg to the eggs. Next time I will spoon the egg mixture onto the bread instead of pouring it.

I just made this as a "trial run" for our new years morning party.  It was excellent!  My 13 and 14 year old loved it.  We decided that we would also try it with apples.  Wasn't too sweet, bread wasn't soggy .. and we used sandwich bread.  It was real good!!!

Ok, so I have made this twice this week.  Once for dinner, yes dinner!  And once for overnight Christmas guests.  The first time I only let it soak for about 1 hour, but the second time was overnight and it was by far the best batch.  Such a yummy recipe!!!

THe idea is delicious- but if I were to make it again, I'd definitely double (at least) the peaches and use thinner cuts of bread. There wasn't enough fruit to go around, and the thick cuts of bread got rather dry in the oven. Also, I needed more egg mixture to drizzle on top in order to cover the whole dish.

This was delicious!  Loved the fact that the syrup was built in :) The only changes I made were adding an extra egg (6 total)and 1/2 c. milk, and dredging the bread in the egg mixture instead of pouring it over all.  My loaf of french bread had an air pocket the length of the loaf which created a hole in each slice of bread....I cubed about 4 slices of bread to fill in the holes(tossed in the egg mixture).  I had no problems with it being too dry or too soggy.  This was perfect...yes sweet, but SOOOO yummy :)  Leftovers that were reheated in the microwave tasted like bread pudding!  Thanks for the recipe!

I took this recipe to a church breakfast where everyone seemed to enjoy it - had requests for recipe.  Unfortunately it all was eaten before I could try it.  I did modify the recipe slightly - I used fresh peaches and blueberries, and also added the extra egg and 1 cup milk.  I also dipped the french bread in the egg mixture before placing in the dish.  It did not seem to be soggy at all when it was served.

This was a great start to my day!  I used a brioche like bread which paired very well with this dish.

This is a really good recipe with a few changes. As others recommended I added another egg and 1 1/2 milk and dipped the slices into the egg mixture before layering them into the pan and then I poured the remaining mixture over the bread. The bakery was out of french bread and they recommended Texas Toast as a subsitute, I don't recommend that. My french toast was slightly soggy in the middle and I think the using a softer bread had a lot to do with it. Next time I will use french bread and I will still use the extra egg and milk. However, I will dip the bread into the egg mixture, save the remaining and pour it over the bread in the morning just before baking. I think sitting in the excess liquid overnight and the soft bread I used resulted in it being a little soggy. I also think that leaving out the extra egg and milk would make it too dry too. Overall, this is a really good recipe and everyone enjoyed it and didn't mind that it was a little soggy because it did taste really good without being too sweet. Perfect without syrup!

I made this in a 8x8 pan with the same amount of brown sugar/butter mixture. YUM!  There was plenty of sauce.  I also sprinkled pecan chips on top before baking- delicious!

Everyone loved the way this tasted and the peaches are a wonderful addition.  I think next time I will soak the bread in the egg mixture.  The top half of the bread was dry because the egg settled

I gave this 4 stars because I did tweak the recipe after reading the reviews.  It turned out wonderfully.  I used four (4) fresh peaches.  I added a half cup of heavy cream to the eggs.  I dipped the slices of french bread (very crusty/day old) in the batter and let the soak about a minute.  I dribble the remain batter over the bread only.  The fresh peaches added juice that cut the sweetness of the brown sugar mixture and made juice to put over the toast when serving.  I also cooked it longer for about 45 to 50 minutes.

I notice after I posted that I got the stars wrong.  It should be four.

Made it for a family reunion of 18 people - everyone raved about it.  Being able to make 3 of these in advance and serve a lot of people at once was terrific.  I inadvertently bought one can of fruit cocktail with the two cans of peaches, and everyone really liked the fruit cocktail version as well.  It is something I'll do on purpose next time.

excellent. don't hesitate to add your own touches. Try adding a splash of eggnog. Our family Irish pudding is made minus the peaches.  Dredging the bread in egg mixture always helps to avoid  "dry spots" on the crust that forms. Thanks for sharing your receipe

Not bad.  Make sure to use brown sugar.  
I soaked the bread in 7 eggs and used about 5-6 fresh peaches instead of canned.  It was way too juicy, so I drained it half way through cooking and flipped the bread so it'd soak the other side.  I also broiled it to get a crispy top for a couple minutes at the end.  It was definitely a great recipe!!

2nd time: We make this ALL the time!  So freakin' good!  I still do 7eggs soak for the bread (cubed not sliced).  But I add 2 jars of canned peaches (well drained).  I also use 1/2- 3/4 of the syrup mixture.  It's too sweet with the full amount.  It's easier to add syrup after if you want more sweetness.

I ended up with a bunch of raw egg that had migrated to the bottom of the pan and never cooked. The bottom of the bread was so soggy it fell apart when I tried to take it out of the pan. This recipe was a disaster.

I've made this recipe 3 times in the last few months!  The first few times i did find it a little soggy even with the day old bread but my co-workers and husband did not complain.  I've  experimented with frozen strawberries in place of the peaches (drained first of course).  I also added the extra milk and egg-and found it was plenty moist.  French toast lovers will most likely love this recipe!

So far this is my favorite recipe from this website. I made it several times w/ canned peaches and fresh blueberries. Each time it was a huge hit with not a crumb left! The first time I made it, the corners of my bread were dry but soaking each piece and then adding egg+milk before baking solved the problem. It smells heavenly!

I was so excited to make this recipe - it sounded so delicious!  But....even though I followed the directions and took others advice by using 6 eggs and 1 1/2 cups of milk, the middle was very soggy and the top was dry.  I was very disappointed. :(

Very Good!  I used fresh peaches, after all it is Aug. in Georgia and they are being sold on the street, and like most others added a bit of milk to the egg/vanilla mixture.  I also added a bit of whipping cream, as pictured, and a few more peach slices before serving.  Very easy to do and the results are outstanding.

This recipe was delicious!  I had fresh peaches and fresh blackberries, so I used both.  Additionally, I toasted some pecan pieces for a few minutes in the oven and added it to the brown sugar mixture.  I used a honey oatmeal bread that added some wonderful flavor.  Taking the advice of a few others, I added some milk to the eggs and increased the eggs to 7 and tossed the bread in it before adding to the top.  My husband loved it and he's very picky.  Kids didn't like the pecans but I thought the toasted nuts knocked it out of the park.  Will do it again!

I have bought fresh french bread, cubed it and soaked the bread in the egg mixture.  Doing this gave it a nice crispy "crust".  I also cooked it right after preparing it and didn't have any problems.  I cut down on on the amount of brown sugar mixture at the bottom of the pan and it cut down on how sweet it was. I made this for my daughter's sleepover and am still getting calls from mother's saying their daughter's said this was the best breakfast they have ever had.

Great recipe, it has become a family favorite for Easter brunch.  I modified this a little bit by adding cream to the eggs to create a custard bath for the bread.

I used regular oatmeal flavored sandwich bread ripped up (7 slices) on top of this. It turned out VERY good as far as the bread goes. I also used frozen peaches. Next time I would thaw them in a strainer as this time it diluted my caramel layer. I only give it four stars because as far as quantity of peaches it did need more. I think I might try diced peaches next time to make it feel like there is more.

The french toast was wonderful.  I used 6 eggs and 2 tablespoons of vanilla and instead of french bread  I used sourdough and cubed it instead of slices and it was great.  Thanks

This is SO good. I made this in the spring for Easter as stated exactly in the recipe.  Then, I just made it for Christmas morning .  . adding fresh cranberries to the peaches. It was FABULOUS!  The color was gorgeous, and I thought the cranberries cut the brown sugary "too sweet" peach.  I mean, the peaches alone are great, but the cranberries make it a little more unique/special.  And, hey -- you can eat a bit more of it since it's not QUITE so sweet!  It's fantastic no matter what fruit you put in, I am sure.

my husband really liked this (and he doesn't like french toast!) and so did I - my sister was not a fan (thought it was weird) - I would definitiely make again as it was REALLY easy for a crowd - the only thing I may do different is dip the bread though as it was hard to get all the bread covered with pouring it on

I made this for Christmas morning breakfast and it was a hit. I didn't have any canned peaches so I used some thawed out frozen strawberries which I sweetened with a little bit of sugar. I used Kings Hawaiian sweet bread which I thought tasted great, it almost fluffed up after cooking. I used three eggs and about a cup and a half of half and half. I also sprinkled some brown and white sugar on the top. I ended up cooking for about 45 minutes, which I think had a lot to do with all of the extra liquid. Great starter recipe, will be making again. Thank you.

After having this dish 3 years in a row for Christmas breakfast, my family has decided that it is to become a Christmas tradition.  We love it so much.  Serve it with a dollop of real whipped cream, maybe even a bit of maple syrup, and breakfast sausages.  You are in for an real treat.  Thanks for the recipe and the start of a great tradition.

I used 9 slices of sandwich bread, ripped into pieces to make it easy to serve.  I found this worked perfectly with the other recipe quantities...it wasn't too wet or dry.  If I made it again, I'd also cut up the peach slices as well to make it really simple to serve.  My husband and I both thought this was a little too sweet, and my 2 year olds both didn't eat any, so while I thought this was pretty good, I probably won't make it again.

My group of 20 LOVED it. I used sour dough bread, and tore into chunks. Made it easy to serve from buffet line. I didnt drain my peaches and no extra syrup was needed.

This was great!!! I loved this recipe for two reasons, first is it really good and second it can be made the night before.  I did make some changes.  I rinced my peaches before adding them to the pan. I bought peach halves and cut them to make it easier to serve.  I decided to use french baguettes instead of french bread, this made the portions slightly smaller and easier to dish out especially when serived with a lot of other food at a brunch.  I did dip both sides of the bread in the egg mixture before pouring it on top.  I followed the recipe for making the brown sugar mixture and did not find it too sweet.  Overall great recipe and will definitely make again

This was a big hit with my family.  I've made baked french toast before, but it has never worked out.  This worked out perfectly.  I halved the recipe and used 3 eggs and just a little bit of milk.  I dipped the bread in the mixture instead of pouring it over, and I also turned the pieces of bread over in the morning right before baking so that the bottom wouldn't be too soggy.  Perfect flavor, texture, everything.  I'll be making this again and again.

Almost like having peach cobbler for breakfast!  I used 1 1/2 cups of milk with 6 eggs as recommended, and broke the bread into chunks so it would be easier for my kids to eat.  Fairly quick and easy to put together as well. I'll definitely be making this again.

Very tasty.  I did add the extra eggs and milk as others noted and next time I will flip the bread onto the other side before baking.  Thanks for this one, I've added it to my recipe box.

This was tasty.  I added a little evaporated milk to the egg mixture before pouring it over the bread.
It does smell great when it is baking and the bread has a very custardy taste to it.  Very good.

So easy, but tastes like you spent the day in the kitchen. I used only 1/2 cup brown sugar. Put the water, sugar, & butter in the microwave until the butter melted. Stirred this together & poured it in the baking dish. I also used 6 eggs & 1 1/2 cups milk. Put peaches on top of the sugar mix. Put bread on top of peaches. Sprinkled with cinnamon. Poured egg-milk-vanilla mix over it all. Squished the bread gently down to help absorb the liquid. Put in fridge overnight. Ready to bake in the morning!

I have been making this for Christmas breakfast for the last three years. Do not listen to the reviewers who say to add milk, it will be soggy! I add one extra egg and a bit more vanilla. This year I used King's Hawaiian rolls and a may try croissants the next time. YUMMY!!

Update: made it with croissants and it was amazing!

I've made this twice and both times it was fabulous.  The first time it was a part of a Christmas Brunch buffet and not a morsel was left.  I used Cinnamon Raisin Bread from a local bakery so that I slice it the way I wanted.  Yummy!  The second time I used an Apricot White Chocolate Bread and sliced fresh apples and pears.  I also substituted Bailey's Caramel for 1 tablespoon of water.  I sprinkled with powder sugar.  This was served with a Chicken Mediterrean Sausage to balance out the sweet.  Absolutely divine!  Can't wait to make it for my next event.

We loved this.  Made it just like the recipe said but did not let it sit overnight.  I just soaked each slice of bread in the egg mixture before putting it in the pan.

This was pretty awesome. Like other reviews suggested, I used six eggs and 1 cup of milk. It was still a little soggy. Maybe my bread wasn't quite old enough? I might cut it down to 1/2 cup milk next time. My boyfriend and I love cinnamon, so we both agreed it needed more, but otherwise--fantastic! I'm definitely making this again and sharing the recipe.

This was horrible... maybe it was my fault because I tried cutting the recipe in half, since it's only my husband and I. Thought it would be too much for just us. I prepared it the exact same way the night before my birthday for a breakfast treat, and it was soo soggy and yuk. 
I gave it one star because the pictures look so good, maybe if this had even turned out half good I'd consider making again... but not going to happen.

This was as good as everyone says!  I did listen to the reviewers and used 6 eggs and 1/2 cup of milk and I also cut up 10 slices of challah bread into pieces (tossing them first in the egg mixture instead of pouring over - much easier) so I could serve it to more people as only 6 pieces fit into the dish if they were whole.  EXCELLENT AND SIMPLE RECIPE!

It's an easy recipe to use and prepare in advance. When changing the serving size though, I suggest adding more eggs. Mine was a little to crunchy after it was baked.

Really good.  I added an extra egg.  Not as sweet as I thought - just perfect.

While the flavor of this is fine, it really is too dry the way the recipe is written.  No one was too interested in this at my house.   Edible, but not worth making again in my opinion.

I added the extra egg and milk as others suggested, diced my challah bread, and used a mixture of frozen blueberries and peaches.  The bread cubes were soaked and tossed in the egg/milk mixture before being put into the dish.  The resulting dish was fabulous in taste!  We were very happy with it.  If I were to use canned or sweeted frozen fruit in the future, I might reduce the amount of sugar, but it was perfect with unsweetened fruit.

My family loved this dish!  I made it with light peaches b/c that's what I had on hand, and I used the peach syrup instead of water.  Like others suggested, I added the extra milk and egg and then dredged the bread.  I let the dish soak overnight.  Before baking I added the extra milk mixture.  Yum Yum!

This was great! My husband (a meat & potatoes man) had three servings, and has asked to have it again! Normally I can't get him to eat fruit if my life depended on it! Thanks for a great recipe, and for getting my husband to eat fruit!

very good and pretty easy.  If you refrigerate overnight, I would suggest "basting" the bread with a extra egg/vanilla mixture halfway through.  I made it at 7 and basted again at 11:30 before bed.

I loved this and so did all of my guests!  I made a double batch because I was serving a lot of people who like sweets (a 2 yr old's birthday party) and it was definitely a hit!  I will keep this recipe in my box for a long time!  The only thing I did differently was add another egg, and a splash of milk.  I also dipped the bread in the egg, then poured the rest on top of the layered bread slices.  It was incredible!  Thanks so much!

This was very good - easy to prepare with good flavor.  I added an extra egg and some milk, as others have suggested.  I soaked each slice of bread in the egg/milk mixture before placing it in the pan to ensure there were no dry spots.  I ended up mixing together yet another egg (7 total) with a bit of milk and vanilla to make enough mixture to soak the bread.  This worked well and the French toast was moist and flavorful.  My son didn't care for the peaches, but my husband and I enjoyed them.

Good flavor.  I found the bread to be a bit dry, I'll try again with extra egg mixture added the morning of cooking.  Could easily benefit from additional fruit combos.

WONDERFUL!  I have been looking for a great brunch recipe and this is it.  I did have to add an extra egg in the morning so that all of my toast was moist.  I also chopped my peaches so my 18 mo. old son could eat them easier.  I sprinkled with powdered sugar. MMMMMMMmmmmmmmmm.

I used whole wheat rolls because of convenience, stayed with 5 eggs because they were jumbo, but added 1 cup milk instead of the 1-1/2 others said they added.  I didn't see where it was added, so I mixed it with the eggs.  Maybe that was the problem, I don't know, but it was a little too much moisture, I'd cut the milk to 1/2 cup next time.  Everything else was the same and was GREAT!  I fixed it for brunch with my girlfriends and everyone enjoyed it.  I'm adding it to my recipe box.

Can even substitute sliced whole wheat toast but just make sure it is submerged in the egg mixture. I definitely would add the 1/4 cup milk as suggested by others. Delish! And you don't even have to refrigerate overnight though it is better if you do

I made this for Christmas brunch for my family.  I do not like French toast, but this has converted me!  I didn't have day old French bread, so I used regular white bread.  Turned out deliciously.  I enjoyed it even better as leftovers.  (I've portioned out some and put in the freezer for a quick warm bfast on the go.  Reheats in the microwave well.).

I added 1/2 cup half and half with 6 eggs and it was perfect. I also used cinnamon raisin bread and cut it into pieces and used fresh peaches and blueberries. I also made it this morning and baked it right away. It was so delicious!

Excellent! I used 6 eggs and 1 1/4 c milk and french bread rolls that were a few days old. I made it the night before and popped it in the oven the next morning. My husband and 3 kids enjoyed this very much! No syrup needed and it's not too sweet. Perfect!

I always overdo the vanilla on any recipe and I added 1-2 extra eggs and just a splash of milk like I would to any french toast.  I also used Whole Wheat French Baguette.  This recipe was the bomb!!! Guests loved it and so nice to have a great one-dish meal!

This was very good, however I added light cream to the egg mixture to make sure the bread was saturated.  In addition, I used challah bread and sliced fresh peaches.  Yum.

Like most people, I chose to add the milk and extra egg and dredge the bread. However, my extra touch was to top with warm coconut syrup also. Yes it is sweet but oh soooo good.

Absolutely delicious!  I used fresh Challa bread and fresh peaches then drizzled real maple syrup over it after baking.  Everyone raved!

Absolutely fantastic!  I made mine with Hawaiian 
Sweetbread, and used the suggestions from other users to add 3 tablespoons of peach brandy to the sugar mixture and sprinkled pecan halves on top.  I also increased the recipe to 7 eggs

So good.  My kids loved this! 
I believe in making recipes AS WRITTEN the first time around, and so I did exactly as told and it turned out quite good.  Next time I will add a scant 1/4 cup of cream in the egg mixture, as eggs do well in cream and the bread threatened to be too dry, but allowing this dish to set overnight was key.  I would think adding a full cup of milk, as some reviewers have done, would be a mistake, because if allowed to set, all of the bread does eventually soak up the egg mixture.  The picture shows this served upside-down, with whipped cream.  Next time, maybe I'll try that.

AWESOME!!! I made this for my husband's 50th birthday party and everybody LOVED it!  I don't usually server for guests recipies that I haven't ried myself, but with 4 1/2 stars and over a hundred reviews I thought I'd take a chance.  I also added the milk, and I added cinnemon to the brouwn sugar layer as well.  I gathered all of the old bread around and tore it all into pieces.  There was french, whole wheat, even bagels in it!  I made 4 batches, 2 peach and 2 blueberry, and both were great!  This one is going to get made over and over, but I'll probably serve it as dessert rather than breakfast!

My daughter was refusing to eat after having her wisdom teeth out two days ago, but this changed her mind.  I went for maximum mush:  used 6 eggs, 1 and 1/2 cups milk and didn't let it set, I baked it right away.  It was yummy but I'll just use 1 cup milk if I make it again.

This was soooo good. Added 6 eggs and 1/4c Plus 1/8 cup milk, a bit more cinnamon and nutmeg. quickly dredged the bread in egg mix before pouring rest of mixture over bread in pan. Phenominal! Would be good without peaches or substitute bananas...like bananas foster!!! Don't need syrup, but isn't over sweet.

this recipe is good.  i sliced a french baguette, and because the pieces were smaller, i was left with small dollops of custard in between the pieces of bread.  i did use two additional eggs, but next time i will dip the bread into the eggs before pouring on the bread.  i did enjoy this recipe.

I was looking for a quick and easy Christmas morning breakfast idea when I found this recipe. I liked the idea of preparing it the night before (saving the mess and the commotion of Christmas morning!). The family went crazy over it...it's now part of our Christmas tradition....everyone looks forward to it. Great recipe and smells soooooo good!!

Absolutely delicious!  I was intending for this to be an alternative dish at my Christmas morning breakfast but it ended up to be a dessert for the meal.  Everyone who initially decided on the other dish I served ended up having some of this as well!  Wouldn't change a thing and you can serve it right out of the pan with no need to add syrup or anything!  A huge hit with kids and adults alike!  Thanks and will be making this again!

This was very tasty.  Instead of discarding the syrup from the canned peaches, I added some cornstarch and heated it to thicken it, then drizzled some over each serving --yum!

Excellent!  I did have to add some milk to the egg mixture to make it creamier.  Pouring it over the bread left it too dry - I had to press the bread down to absorb more liquid.  (Next time I'll dredge the bread slices as recommended by others.)  I also cooked for longer, about 45 minutes, mainly because my guests were late.  Everyone this morning raved about the flavor.  Didn't need any syrup at all.

This was very good, but I also added 1 cup of milk to the egg mixture.  (Next time, I will use 6 eggs and 1 1/2 cups of milk!)  I baked it COVERED and longer than the recipe called for.  My 3 year old loved it.  I nice change from our traditional egg and sausage casserole.

Easy dish to do ahead.  I used cinnamon bread instead of French bread but any kind will do .  My adult company loved it.  Teenage girls not so much.  Would definitely make again since my granddaughters are not a good judge of food!

Had it at a brunch and immediately got the recipe but realized the recipe does not have milk as an ingredient.  My batch was dry as could be, but will try it next time with a cup of milk.  You need to change the recipe you have published

My kids LOVED this. I made it using fresh peaches and homemade bread, added two eggs and a splash of milk after I realized it wasn't enough egg for the amount of bread.

I made the recipe as stated but my family did not like. The under side of the French toast remained soggy which ruined it.

I made it but was disappointed. I pictured it like a  cinnamon roll but it was runny. I can't imagine what it would've been like had I used 1 1/2 c. of milk. It was good but it will not go in my recipe file.

I was not impressed with recipe for all the time required to make it. If I make again, I will not soak overnight and instead will just dredge bread in egg & vanilla and then brown in skillet and pour sugar mixture over it.

Delicious! But I certainly didn't leave  it overnight before baking it.  I just added the butter and brown sugar together and then put them in the oven to blend together.

Then I added real fruit, not canned; added milk to the egg mixture as  I prefer this.  I also used plain bread, not baguette and it turned out real fine.

This was delicious! The only thing I would do differently would be to soak the bread overnight in the egg mixture by itself. When I poured the egg over the bread some egg ran off into the pan and came out like a custard (which didn't bother me a bit!) and its consistency wasn't appreciated by a couple of my "Judges". I will make it again with this one change!

This is soooo good! I added about a half cup of milk to moisten the bread- so we didn’t have to wait overnight. I used two fresh peaches, chopped, instead of canned. Since we had this for dessert instead of breakfast, we topped it with whipped cream. Yum!

Ironically this turned up in my email last night as I was trying to think of what to make for a family brunch today.  Very good, turned out better than I expected. Easy to remove from baking pan (I thought it would stick). Used fresh peaches because I had lots. I halved  the butter/brown sugar/water mixture and there was still plenty to coat the 9x13 pan.  I did as others recommended and dipped each bread piece in the eggs first to ensure they were coated and poured remaining over top. Was in fridge for only two hours and that was fine. Will keep this recipe to make again.

This is my new go-to breakfast for company. I've started making mine the night before, keeping it in the fridge ready to go the next morning. I find I need more bread and liquid for a 9x13 pan so adjust amounts accordingly.  I also soak my bread in the egg mixture, like French toast,  as oppose to pouring over after.

I did use regular bread, but doubled up the layers. It is extremely sweet as is, but I have a terrible sweet tooth, so I thought it was delicious. I don't like big chunks of fruit in many meals, so I did break the peaches into slightly smaller pieces. Thanks for the recipe!

Yummmmm! The only adjustment I made was using fresh from the local berry farm peaches. I didn't let this sit overnight, because I needed a dinner quick. Very good and I made half the size.. Family of 3 with nothing left, but an empty dish.

I followed the suggestions and added milk.  It turned out doughy, so next time I will follow it exactly as written.  It still tasted excellent though so I will give it the 5 stars based on the recipe and not on what I created.  I ate mine with icecream too.  Very yummy.

Made this for a brunch.  Easy recipe & tasted great.  The peach chunks do keep the bread raised up from the bottom of the pan which limited absorbing all the egg, however while the oven was preheating, I gently pressed the bread into the egg.  I used 6 eggs and 1 1/2 c low fat milk, then sprinkled on a bit of cinnamon.  By the time the oven was ready, the bread had absorbed all the egg.  The texture of the baked French toast was exactly right, neither dry nor soggy.  I toasted some almond slices that I added when plating.  It added another level of flavor and a nice light crunch.  Next time I think I'll add a little vanilla to the egg.  Will definitely make this again.

Delicious! I added a few crushed pecans in with the layer of peaches. Added a nice crunch & helped to distract from the sticky sweetest. Yummy!! I'm definitely gonna make again.

This is a good recipe to make your own. I tried it mostly as written, and like the idea of the brown sugar/butter combo for the bottom.  Next time, though, I think I will mix the peaches with the bread (which I cubed), along with more fruit (I added blueberries too). (and yes, add milk!)  Also, I like more spice, so I will definitely use more cinnamon along with other spices for more pizzazz.  I had nice compliments and will make it again and continue to play with the options.

It had a good flavor on the top portion with the somewhat crunchy part of the ..... the peaches were good...but the entire thing was way too soggy! I definitely wouldn't call this a french toast bake...more like a peach bread pudding...a very runny one.

This recipe is awesome!  The 2nd time I made it, I substituted the french bread with croissants from a grocery bakery.  It was BEYOND good! Everyone raved about my peach french toast!

I used multigrain french bread, 4 fresh peaches and increased eggs to include 8 eggs.  It still needed a few more eggs for my liking, but overall it had good flavor.  The bread was a little crispy after it was done baking, but was a decent recipe.

It's pretty good. Not as sweet as I thought it would be with all of the sugar, peaches, vanilla extract. It was good but not excellent.

This is a hit every time I make it. I've assembed it the night before and the morning of. Great either way. I've used slices and I've tossed broken bread pieces with the egg mix. Still great either way. I do use home-canned peaches, so that may give me an advantage. Still, I get asked at home to make it again and almost a year after taking it to a church breakfast people are still asking me for the recipe and reminiscing over it.

I did use 6 eggs and 1 cup milk. Dredged french bread before pouring mixture over, then let stand for 20 minutes before baking (no overnight). I baked for 35 minutes and the bread was still a little soggy. I think I will reduce amount of milk some next time or bake longer. Deserves 5 star rating if I can slove the soggy problem.

This tastes OK but was very juicy on bottom.  Took over an hour to get it done, have an oven thermometer also and temp was correct.  Too much liquid.  Wont make again.

Yummy!!  I just made a 1/2 batch using 3 eggs a splash of milk and also used canned pears, since I didn't have any peaches on hand.  My picky 6yr old loved it too.  I made it as a desert for tonight and will have again in the morning.

My family loves this recipe.  I have made it with the peaches and also fresh apples.  I do use the extra egg and milk mentioned by other reviewers.   I made this for a friend of mine who had just come home from having her seventh baby boy.  She reported that all of the boys loved it as they made happy, yummy sounds from the table as she feed the baby.  They then  hovered around her to see her reaction when she took a bite.  I will be sending her a copy of the recipe and you can't get much greater praise.  They also really liked the Three Cheese Manicotti recipe from this site.

This is excellent as is.  Next time, though, I will cut the french bread a bit thinner, 1/2 inch slices, also I will dip the slices of bread in the egg mixture.  These modifications are just personal preferences.  For presentation I will dust with powdered sugar after baking.

I didn't have peaches, so I used apples, and I let it sit in the fridge for an hour and half only.  But it was excellent.  At first I thought it was dry, but I didn't spoon enough of the butter topping onto it.  After I did that, it was perfect.  By far the best baked french toast I've had!

This did not turn out too well for me.  My kids gave it a big thumbs down.  I added the milk as suggested, and poured it slowly over bread, covered it (pressing bread down tightly) and refrigerated overnight.  Top was too dry and bottom was soggy.  May try again and dip bread in milk/egg before placing over fruit.

I loved that I could prep this the night before for a good breakfast in a busy household.  I didn't have enough butter so I added some applesauce.  I also used whole wheat bread to make it healthier.  I liked this recipe.  My kids still had to add syrup, but they're kids!

I did not care for the texture very much and I used lite peaches and I think that resulted in it not being very sweet. Would not try again, sorry.

I made this for my son's baptism this past saturday and not very much of it got eaten.  I did make it the night before, and I followed the instructions of some of the reviewers by cubing the bread, adding an extra egg and some milk (1.5 cups).  In the end, it still wasn't enough, so I added another egg and another 1/2 cup of milk.  I cooked it the next morning and the end result was a very soggy french toast casserole.  I might attempt to make this again, but I will not add the last egg and 1/2 cup of milk (even though it will look to be not enough for the amount of bread used). I will also strain the peaches better...maybe place them on some paper towels to "dry off" a bit better.  So in the end...I might make again, but not anytime soon.

I loved this recipe. One friend I made it for refused to touch it and one was luke warm to it but another friend went back for 3rd and 4th helpings. It made the apartment smell really wonderful too.
