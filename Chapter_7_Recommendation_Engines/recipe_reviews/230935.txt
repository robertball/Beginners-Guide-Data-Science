I needed a gluten-free dessert for my Bible study group. They loved it so much they were scraping every last bit out of the glasses and have asked me to bring it again. Easy recipe, turned out great. I did make one change though. I used fresh raspberries instead of frozen and only had about 6 oz at that. It seemed like enough. I used Lindt Excellence 70% cocoa smooth dark chocolate bar for the chocolate. I served it in wine glasses and it was a really nice presentation.

It tasted wonderful but the cream wouldn't whip. We ended up with sauce so, we served it over ice cream.

This is a very simple and very yummy version. I used fresh raspberries and topped it with a sprig of mint. It was beautiful and very yummy!
