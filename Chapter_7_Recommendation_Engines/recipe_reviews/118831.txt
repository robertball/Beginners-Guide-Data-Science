The flavor was DELICIOUS! I used plain yogurt instead of mayonaise to cut the fat. The only problem was getting the dough to cook all the way through- even after leaving it in almost 25 minutes (any longer would have burnt the top) it was still doughy on the inside. Next time, I will probably cook it longer on a lower temperature.

BEAUTIFUL, DELICIOUS, AND DECEPTIVELY EASY. My neighbor's teenage son, who abhors vegetables, loved the broccoli and peppers in this.  I omitted the almonds, because I just forgot, and it was fine.

Next time I'll add some salt or more cheese to counter the sweetness of the crescent dough.

Incidentally, Pillsbury makes tubes of crescent dough without the seams now.  How convenient!!

Okay, other than the amount and type of veggies in the filling, I don't see how this recipe is any different from the other  2 chicken braids on this site.  I saved a different one to my recipe box and ended up making this one.  Oh, well.  This is actually quite simple and fun, and looks beautiful.  I made my own crescent dough and had leftover chicken from a slow cooker recipe that called for tomato sauce, so I suppose that could have changed the taste a bit.  Still, it was pretty good.  It's a bit tangy--I guess from the mayo-but not so much that it's overpowering, and the dough is a nice touch.  I can't believe I'm saying this (I LOVE bread), but it's too much dough for me.  I halved the recipe and halved my crescent dough to make 10 servings, and I thought it was a bit thick, so I'd probably roll it out thinner (not too practical--mine was too big for any other cookie sheet other than my biggest), or use less dough.  Don't let the braid scare you off if you are interested in making it--it actually is very easy.  I messed up (didn't make the same amount of cuts on both sides) and it still looked gorgeous!

This is a great dish for potlucks, looks great, tastes great.  I use puffed pastry instead of crescent rolls and find it's a tastier dish. I sometimes add a little almond in the filling as well.

I have had this recipe at a pampered chef party but it was still good when I tryed it this way. You can also use the chicken mixture on crackers. If you want to make this recipe even better try using the all purpose dill seasoning from pampered chef it makes a huge difference.

This was delicious and easy. The only changes I made were adding shredded carrots and steaming my broccoli because it was frozen. I lowered cooking heat to 325 and it took about 20 mins.

This is gorgeous!! I used all red pepper, and substituted half of the mayo (Duke's) with light sour cream. I used leftover baked chicken. I boiled the broccoli for 4 mins, then placed in an ice bath. I doubled the onions and garlic, and sauteed them together with the red peppers for 2 minutes with a dash of olive oil. I added the 2 T of almonds (sliced) to the filling. I made 2 separate loaves using butter flake crescent rolls.  I also put sliced almonds on top, in circles to form flowers. It was beautiful and tasted every bit as good as it looked!

Yum-O For the most part I did follow the recipe.  Just a few additions, I cooked up 2 lrg chicken breast and I was just shy of 2 cups so I added a bit of left over ham.  I bumped up the red & green pepper to a 1/2 cup each, finely diced, added about 1/4 minced onion and a heaping tsp of VE Lemon Dilly Dip Mix.  I substituted 1 cup of Havarti Cheese for the cheddar.  I used a whole egg instead of just the white to brush on and after is was golden, finely shredded about 1/2 cup more of the Havarti and sprinkled it over the top.  To say the least it was devoured, will make this again and again.

Update:  changed it up a bit.  Used Monteray Jack Cheese and still using the 2 cans of crescent rolls, made 4 small braids.  Brushed with egg and sprinkled with a bit more cheese.  Turned out fantastic.

Very good, liked the tang the mayo gave.  Didn't use almonds and dill (I don't like dill).  I used frozen brocoli and microwaved it for a few minutes before mixing it with the chicken.  Will make again.

I made this without the peppers and almonds and it was delicious.  I have a family of 8 and I thought 3 "loaves" were going to be too many.  I made all 3, but only cooked 2 for the kids and I.  It was gone in no time!  The last one I stuck in the fridge until hubby came home later.  He ate 80% of it himself, I ate the rest.  I will definitely make again and tell everyone about it.

LOL this recipe is virtually identical to "Chicken and Broccoli Braid" on here, so, I went w/ this one for dinner. Husband called it "fancy hot pocket!" I said "Blech! Too much dill!" This recipe has mountains of potential for unique variations, and that's what I'm looking forward to doing w/ it. Feels like the guts' options are limitless, so I can't really rate this recipe as poorly as I felt that it tasted, only b/c it's a good starting point for better and better recipes. So onto my suggestions for this as written: saute the garlic & pepper in a little EVOO w/ some onion, and give the broccoli a quick steam. Go lighter on the dill. (I used 1/2 tsp. fresh, and it was all that I tasted.) No complaints about using low-fat mayo. I halved the recipe as all that I had was 1 can of crescent rolls and everything fit snug wrapped inside and baked perfectly at 350 for half-hour.

This was good and a nice change of pace. I subbed the crescent rolls with whole wheat pizza dough and cauliflower for the broccoli. Since I didn't use the crescent rolls I ended up rolling the dough out on a well floured surface then transfered carefully to a greased and cornmealed baking sheet. I agree with a previous reviewer that ranch seasoning would be a wonderful addition. I feel like it needed a little more flavor.

This was yummy, and everyone liked it.  I did forget the cheese, and know it will be even better next time.  Didn't measure chicken, but was 2-3 cups. sauteed 2c. broccoli with red pepper, onion and garlic.  Braid took much longer to not be doughy in the middle/top. next time I'll try not to overlap so much dough in one place.  THANKS!

Easy, pretty. I didn't have the almonds, but it tasted fine. I added some crushed red pepper flakes (which seemed to do a lot for the flavor), and extra green pepper (just because I had them in the garden to use up). Quick and easy.

This was great!! It makes a wonderful presentation and is suprisingly easy.  I did do 2 BIG changes though.  I omitted the mayo and the dill from the mixture.  I did not have dried or fresh dill but decided to get creative.  I steamed frozen broccoli so it made the filling moist on its own so I did not worry about the filling being too dry.  Then, I took some light mayonaise, a small amount of dill pickle juice and a splash of lemon and made a "dip".  I served about 2 TB of this on the side and it was a huge hit!  Great recipe and I will make again!

This was a great recipe!  I used Miracle Whip instead of Mayo, so it was a little sweeter than I think was intended.  I also didn't quite "get" how to do the crescent rolls, so next time I think I'll just overlap the big ends of the rolls and wrap the pointy ends over the mixture.    My family absolutely loved this - even the pickiest and the youngest!

Smelled better cooking than it actually tasted.  This was just OK.  If I tried it again, I would probably leave out the cooked chicken and just use veggies.

Good idea, but we didn't like this at all. It was edible but that is all I can say. It looked very good though. However, my husband took the leftovers to work and shared them with his co-workers and they loved it. So I guess this just didn't appeal to our appetites. Thanks anyway, it was fun fixing something new.

Yum! This is a new favorite for dinner time. I marinated the chicken in Italian dressing for a couple hours and added a little more cheese - delish!

Someone else had given me a very similar recipe the only difference was there was no green bell pepper just red, and it was a ring not a braid, but still very excellent!!! I did not use dill weed as I'm not a fan, I used pepper instead, and did not use almonds but still this recipe was delicious. I will make this over and over again.

My family loved this recipe! The only I changed was the braiding. Instead I made it wreath style. Next time I know to make more because everyone ate this up!

We had this one Christmas when we were at my Sister-In-Laws house.  My kids went nuts for it, and I loved it as well.  She told me she got the recipe from a Pampered Chef party she attended and gave me the recipe.  I've made it several times and everyone I've made it for has loved it! I have never made it with the almonds because people can be picky about nuts, but I may try adding them once.  Super easy to make and very delicious. My husband hates brocolli and even he eats this.

This was pretty good and relatively easy. I did find that I needed to bake mine a little longer as it was kind of doughy after the time suggested. The only other thing I would change is to omit the salt next time as I found that the pre-packaged crescent rolls were salty enough on their own. Made good leftovers too.

I'm only putting four stars because I didn't follow the recipe exactly- I didn't use any peppers at all.  I didn't have a problem with it coming out doughy, and I cooked mine for 20 minutes.  Just crispy and golden on the outside.  Others may have had trouble because of oven temp. variations.  It's delish and I will for sure make it again!

Used a pastry crust instead of the crescent rolls. I think that should help with the "doneness" problems other users had. Made some other changes, but that's only because I can never follow a recipe without playing with it :) I did add some sour cream to the sauce to add some more flavor. But the other changes were well within the spirit of the recipe. The only problem with the pastry crust was that I rolled it too thin and it was hard to braid. So next time, I'm thinking to do it smaller and thicker.

Yummy!  I made this today with my son as a practice run for a Valentine's dinner he is making for his girlfriend.  It looks extremely elegant and the taste was fantastic.  We only cooked it for twenty minutes and let it sit for ten minutes before serving.  An easy way to make a great impression.  Thanks for the recipe

I didn't follow the directions to the exact, but the ingredients mixed together are wonderful, my picky three year old even ate some!!!!  I think that the recipe may call for large amounts of some things that make it too big for it's shell.  Delicious!!!!

This makes for an easy weeknight meal.  I used mushrooms and onion in place of the peppers.  I was worried that the broccoli wouldn't be cooked all the way just from baking, so I quickly steamed it for a couple of minutes - the result was cooked but still crisp.  I also added some softened cream cheese to the mixture because it looked a little dry...that made it nice and creamy.  The dill weed gave it a nice flavor and I added some freshly ground black pepper as well.  I think this recipe would be great with diced cooked ham as well.  A definite keeper!!

Made this for my fiance, found out he doesn't like broccoli and cheese together/ oh well, still said it was good. 
Made a few changes due to earlier reviews.
no green pepper so used 1/2c red pepper and added 1/4c of vidalia onion. Sauteed them first along with the garlic, dill and salt. Steamed the broccoli first. Seemed to be 1-1/2 c too much filling so I had leftovers. Only needed to cook 11mins cause it was getting golden and I knew the insides were already cooked.
Will make again adn may even try some other fillings!

Amazing and easy! I cut the mayo in half and used sourcream instead. I also put some slivered almonds on top after brushing with the egg and precooked all the veggies a little.

This is my family's favorite recipe so far.  I don't always have the peppers so I substitute celery and carrot.  I use Miracle Whip.

Giving this five out of five for my version since my husband adored it.  I reduced the recipe by half, however I divided that between the two of us and only then did it seem like enough of a supper.  I augmented heavily to suit our tastes.  It was also slightly altered by the fact my husband mistakenly picked up the multigrain crescent rolls.  I was expecting this to be odd but we found the texture surprisingly attractive.  Subbed the mayo for a light spread of sour cream over the rolled-out dough and layered ingredients on top.  Did chicken, cheddar, broccoli and almonds (put almonds inside).  Left out the peppers as we don't like cooked bell peppers.  Per another reviewer's comments, chopped broccoli into fairly small pieces so it cooked.  Sprinkled perhaps 2 tsp cajun spice mix (on this site) over top.  Sprinkled a little extra garlic powder.  Chopped approx 1 Tbs of fresh chives overtop.  Left off egg white as it seemed like unnecessary extra work.  Cooked for almost exactly 15 minutes and divided in two.  Delicious!
