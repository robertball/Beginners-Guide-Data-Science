This is a great soup!  I skipped the nutmeg and added fresh thyme instead.  I also used 2 potatoes.
Was great with a small amount of freshly shaven parmesan cheese as well.

A very good and easy soup.  I used a large baking potato, so the soup was nice and thick after blending.  Also, I didn't add the thawed broccoli until the potato was already tender, and just cooked it a few minutes more so that the broccoli kept a nice green color and fresh flavor.  My family, including my 9-yr. old son, really liked this soup.

I was worried after reading other reviews of this recipe but gave it a try anyhow because it looked so easy.  It turned out terrific!!  It was a little bland but I just added some chopped fresh sage and a little season salt and it turned out great!  And you can't beat it for healthy.  For my husband I stirred a 1/4 c of chopped proscuitto (you could use ham too) into his and he loved it. I also doubled the potato as per previous reviews here and I loved the thick texture. I will definitely put this in our monthly rotation - thanks Lon!

This recipe rocks, especially if you're obsessed with soup like I am! It's totally easy and totally tweakable. I used fresh broccoli, two small red potatoes with the skins on, and omitted the nutmeg (had none in the house). I also threw some reduced-fat white cheddar cheese in the bowl and it got all melty and delicious and tasted as good as the Panera broccoli cheddar I love but can no longer eat because it's awful for you. But even with the cheese this recipe is low-cal. Fabulous!

Great recipe!  But boy, did I mess it up - I had very bad jetlag and decided to make this at 2a.m. since I could not sleep -  I must have been really zoning as I did NOT sautee the onions and garlic - I just threw everything in a pot and started cooking :-)  It turned out great!!  As far as I am concerned if you can mess up the recipe and it still turns out well, it's a keeper :)  Used veggie broth instead of chicken and fresh broccoli. Loved it!

Wow!  This is a fabulous, low-calorie soup - great for dieting.  I used light margarine instead of olive oil, to save a few calories.  I added a couple more potatoes, requiring me to add a little bit of water (in addition to the chicken broth), and since I only had 16 ounces of frozen broccoli, I used some fresh broccoli, as well.  I also added 1/4 cup of half and half at the end, just to make it a little creamier.  I wouldn't have touched this as a kid, but now that I have realized how wonderful broccoli truly is, I loved this soup!

Fabulous Broccoli Soup! I too used fresh broccoli, omitted the nutmeg, and added red pepper flakes to give it some kick. Really adds to the flavor.  I also used evaporated skim milk to make it creamier, but the potato pretty much does that on its own.  Love this soup!!!

This is SO GOOD and super easy! I added an extra small potato because other reviews said it was not thik enough and it was SO thick, I could have eaten it with a fork! But good, I also added 2 stalks celery. YUM YUM YUM! Will make again and again (with just one potato)!

Very good! I used vegetable broth instead of chicken because I'm a vegetarian.  This soup is excellent for a low calorie soup.  I will make it again.

After reading some great & some not so great reviews, I decided to give this soup a try even though my first impression of the ingredients did not appeal to me. Should have stuck with my first impression because I found it very bland, and watery. I used fresh broccoli which may have affected it some and left out the nutmeg. After doctoring it up with some cream, cheddar cheese, and butter and also thickening it with some flour, it was much better. This one is not a keeper for me.

Have been making this soup for a long time.  Only changes being that I use leeks and add some hot pepper flakes.   Great, easy and healthy  - nice to have a soup that does not call for milk products.

I got this exact recipe from a good girlfriend of mine last week. The only change she made was to use a couple big flowerettes of cauliflower to cut down on the carbs. I used organic chicken broth and using the cauliflower gives you the same creamy effect as a potato would and this is wonderful even without cream. If you want a heartier soup, chunked ham or turkey ham is a nice addition.

I am not a picky eater, adore ALL vegetables and have loved almost every recipe I haved tried from this website, but this one is lacking. I agree with others who've said it is bland. I made a big pot of this soup and seriously thought it might end up down the drain. Yuk.  Started doctoring it up and finally got it to a place where it has a pleasing flavor.  My additions?  A tablespoon or two of butter, 1/2 cup of milk, some garlic powder, onion powder, a splash of soy sauce. a splash of lemon juice, some cajun and creole seasoning to give it some bite and a good shake of parmesean cheese. I think I would also skip the nutmeg if I ever made it again. I've seen other recipes here for Cream of Broccoli soup and think I'll make one of those next time I have a lot of broccoli I want to use up.

I used vegetable broth and fresh broccoli, otherwise made as written and it turned out delicious.  Very thick and creamy.  Will definitely make this soup again soon.  Also very minimal prep time and easy to cook!

Love this recipe!  I used organic vegetable stock, fresh broccoli. Per other reviewer suggestions, I eliminated the nutmeg and use thyme instead and used two small to medium sized potatoes. Totally vegetarian and a new favorite! Thanks!

I'm really surprised at how well-reviewed this recipe is--I followed the recipe exactly except that I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen, and threw in an extra small potato, and I found that the texture of this soup is like gruel. I hate to waste food so I threw in 2 cups of milk with some flour to thicken it, and some garlic salt and let it simmer longer.  I ate it with some cheese melted into it, and it was just okay.  I won't make this again.  If you're on a strict diet and trying to cut out as much fat as possible, the recipe as written might be good to try, but not otherwise.

This is a great soup.  I wanted broccoli soup but I didn't want to have to use milk so my 8 month old baby could eat it too.  This was perfect!  Using the potato and pureeing it make it very smooth and the result was better than I expected.  However, if you are looking for that milky, creamy texture, it is not like that.  You can tell it is pureed potato, but it is smooth and delicious.  I added  a couple of stalks of celery with the onions and garlic and an extra potato.  Because of that I had to add an addition cup of broth.

Simple to make, healthy and tasty. I have noticed that recipes that contain only nutmeg for seasoning usually are kind of bland, as some people have commented. So instead of nutmeg I added tyme and crushed bay leaves, as well as crushed chillis because I need my soups to be spicy!!! An excellent recipe for those watching their weight, but I wouldn't make it the centre of dinner. Great quick lunch for work.

This was a good soup - heathy and full of flavor.  My only complaint is that since it makes so much you can eat it for a couple of days (there is only 2 of us). By the third day you no longer look forward to eating the soup. Other then that it was good. Tastes healthy.

LOVED this recipe! Will defintely be part of my winter dinners. Super simple and HEALTHY! Doesn't get much better than that. I used fresh broccoli rather than frozen. If you go that route, do not add the stem. It takes too long to soften and my hand blender didn't puree it whatsoever.

DH and I are sick with a summer cold, so this soup was perfect.  For more vitamins and minerals, though, I sauteed onions, LOTS of garlic, celery, carrots, then added a garlic bouillon cube, and 3 or 4 chicken bouillon cubes, 3 large peeled, chopped potatoes, and 3 chopped heads of fresh broccoli.  Seasoned with a touch of salt, and simmered til veggies were soft.  Shut off heat to cool.  Then pureed in blender and reheated.  Added salt and pepper to taste, with some ground red pepper.  Perfecto!  In individual bowls, I also added some shredded mexican blend cheese (because that's what I had, but cheddar would have probably been better) to the kids' bowls.  Everyone inhaled it and went back for seconds and thirds - even my pickiest.  I've always added milk to mine, but this definitely didn't need it.- thank goodness, because we are almost out of milk and I am too sick to go to the store for it.  Vitamin packed and healthy, it was delish!  Thanks!  Four stars because I added all the other vegs for flavor and health - but I assume its great without.

I followed other reviews and used 3 potatoes & fresh broccoli. I substituted the Nutmeg for Pumpkin Spice (you could also use cinnamon). I had beef broth instead of chicken. I followed the directions exactly as they are posted.... It was excellent!

I had to doctor this soup up with Greek yogurt, Swiss cheese, & Dijon mustard. If you’re going to use this recipe then skip the nutmeg, skip the potato, & add more onion, garlic & maybe some celery.

Easy and delicious. I sub vegetable broth, add a little more garlic, and a bay leaf. Remove the bay leaf before you puree.

Nice texture although a little bland, would benefit from additional flavoring eg lemon juice, more spices.  I added a second potato for more thickening.  Very healthy!

I love this quick and easy to make soup! I usually leave out the nutmeg and after I puree the soup i add chopped fresh dill! Sometimes I leave out the potato and add 2 cans of creamed corn to give it a creamy flavor. I have also made this same recipe but used cauliflower instead of broccoli. Delicious!

This wasn't too bad but I think I would have liked it without the nutmeg.  I definitely recommend tasting it before adding the nutmeg.  I made cornbread to accompany the soup & found it a good contrast.

So nummy. Creamy with no cream :) Potatoes are awesome! I used homemade turkey broth and salted throughout the process, rather than at the end, because said broth had no added salt...and I like my broccoli pretty salty. I also used bacon grease instead of olive oil. Great warm up, and a tip? Awesome side dish Cheddar Bacon Ranch Pulls....I am stuffed!

This soup is great alternative for eating big portions of vegetables without feeling like you just eat and entire tree. Perfect for picky kids, the taste is very good and it has a nice consisteny. I always add a little fresh grated parmesan cheese and pepper but that's me.

Delish.  Used a ton of my CSA broccoli in this soup.  Turned out great and froze well--just thawed a container last week and it was fantastic.

This is oh so lovely! One potato was perfect for me. I can't imagine how thick it would be if a second potato was added. 
Not sure why so many people are skipping on the nutmeg. I thought it was a nice touch.
Don't go crazy and add a bunch of "extras" to this soup, unless its spices though I didn't think it was needed. It totally defeats the purpose of this being a low calorie soup! A little fresh hot pepper is a nice kick if you want some heat.
Oh, and since I'm the only person who seems to do the da** dishes in this house, I just used a potato masher instead of adding the pain of taking apart and cleaning the blender. I started mashing 13 mins into the cooking and allowed the soup to simmer and thicken for another 5.

yum! this was sooo simple and good! I used two fresh broccoli heads and added 2 extra garlic cloves and one more cup of stock. I didn't have  potato on had, so I used 1 tablespoon instant mashed potatoes.  This was really good! Very comforting and delicious, not to mention healthy! I will be making this again.

I have made this twice in the past two weeks!  I add an extra potato, omitted the nutmeg, added white pepper and a little Velveeta (I had some that I had to use up).  The first batch I used broccoli cuts, and ended up with little "strings" in the soup after I blended it.  Second batch I used just frozen florets and this problem was eliminated.

This is a nice low-fat soup but didn't have a ton of flavor.   I added some half and half to mine to make it more creamy which helped.

Looking for a soup recipe to use mostly broccoli stalks and this was perfect.  Simmer chopped up stalks for at least 30 min. and use a hand blender to puree.  Plenty of garlic and fresh ground nutmeg gave it the right kick.

This soup was excellent and easy to prepare.  The potato added the necessary "creaminess" to it.  I followed the recipe exactly except I only had one can of chicken broth so I had to also use a can of vegetable broth.

I was very disappointed in this soup and my husband did not care for it.  Will have to doctor what is left if we are going to eat it.  He said it definitely tastes low calorie and would never make it in a restaurant.

I made this soup for me and my 16-month old daughter.  I only altered the recipe slightly (6 cups of chicken broth and 2 potatoes) and it turned out very good.  My daughter is happily eating it now, saying "mmm, yum yum" after every bite. :-)

Awesome recipe!  I used fresh broccoli, onions and garlic from my garden and wow, I love this.  The added thyme and sage as suggested is great!  Wasn't to sure about the nutmeg so I omitted that!  I will definitely use this recipe again!

This was a delicious, hearty soup. I used Edward and Sons "Not Chik'n" broth (delicious!) to keep it vegan, doubled the potato like many others here, and used fresh broccoli instead of frozen. I saute-ed the solid ingredients in a cast iron skillet before dumping them in a soup pot with already boiling broth. It was so flavorful I'll definitely be making it a regular in the dinner menu :)

This is excellent. I love broccoli and cheese soups but dont love the calories. 
I used left over roasted potatoes from the night before and I think this gave it a great flavor. I also added several twists of a county fresh herb grinder I keep handy. I'm thinking about adding some ff sour cream to make it even creamier next time. 
Very filling! I wanted a second helping but didn't have room for it!

My husband and I love this recipe.  It has just the right amount of thickness, is filling, and tastes great as a main meal.  I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen and used four low salt chicken bouillon packets for the broth.  Relatively simple to make.  My kids won't touch this, but they don't like any soup.

Having had to re-think my eating habits, I was looking for a broccoli soup recipe that was low in calories. I was skeptical about how it would taste without all the cream and the cheese that's in my favorite recipe from here......but I have to say that this one is not missing on anything.........except the calories. I like my soups a bit chunkier so instead of using a hand blender, I used a pastry cutter to mash it up, and added a dash of worchestershire and a bit more garlic.
This one is my favorite now, and I will be using the potatoe as a substitute for a thickener in many other soups from now on.

LOVE this. Super easy and a great way to use up extra veggies. I didn't have nutmeg so I used a few other spices.

This was wonderful!  I was a little apprehensive about it, but with no reason to be.  I loved the flavor and texture.  I followed the recipe, except to leave out the nutmeg (I am not a fan) and to add a bit of sage and thyme (per other reviews).  Not at all disappointed.  Will recommend to friends and family!!

Sorry, really don't understand all the rave reviews. I really wanted to like this healthy soup, but it was just blah.  It's great for my diet (as it took away my appetite!)  Had to put a lot of salt just to make it palatable. My 5 yr old didn't like it either (pitched it as Leprachaun soup ;)  Will not make again. Also, I didn't have a hand blender, so had to use regular blender, which definitely takes a bit away from the e-zness of this recipe. If you use this approach, don't overfill the blender, my first batch went all over the counters!

This just lacked any flavor...I ended up following suggestions and adding things (cheese, sage, ham) to try and liven it up...but it was just missing something. Bummer. So healthy

I am eating this right now, the only thing I did different was omit the nutmeg and used fresh broccoli (I include the stocks too). It's delicious! I'm so glad I found it, I was looking for non-dairy blended soups and love broccoli soup, this was perfect thanks!

We were tired of our usual broccoli dishes so I tried this tonight. I used fresh broccoli since I didn't have any frozen. My husband liked it and my 1 year old and 3 year old ate a lot of it, which was surprising since they both won't eat broccoli any other way. I thought it was okay and wouldn't make it again for myself but since it went over so well with the kids I will make it again.

this soup was super!  I love soup and was looking to use up some broccoli that I had in the freezer when I  stumbled upon this recipe.  Boy, am I glad I did!  It was super easy and so tasty.  I can't believe how rich and creamy it is without any added dairy.   I love this recipe- thanks

This is actually very nice! I used fresh broccoli and also added some cauliflower, stock cubes (2 vegetable & 1 chicken stock). No extra salf was added and I ate it before I remembered the nutmeg, lol. It's a good way to use up broccoli that's begun to flower slightly, but still perfectly good for eating.

When I made this soup I could not believe how incredibly creamy it was without any dairy at all. I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen. Per the recommendations I added an extra potato and when I blended it I though it was the perfect consistancy.  A few other adaptions I made: I also added some red pepper flakes while it simmered. When I transferred the mixture to be blended I also added some fresh lemon juice and a squirt of spicy mustard. I left out the nutmeg as I didnt have any in house.  Next time I make this soup I am going to try and make it with cauliflower instead of broccoli, as I think it will be just as good. (Edited after making this recipe with Cauliflower, it wasnt anywhere near as good as when made with cauliflower)

This IS a very good soup!  I used two potatoes as suggested by other reviewers, but then realized I did not have two boxes of frozen broccoli, so I used the one I had plus 10 ounces of spinach!  It was great - and full of both calcium and iron and vitamin A!  I also put in a little (maybe 1/2 cup) of half-and-half, and some sage in addition to the nutmeg.  Sprinkled with some shredded cheese and served.  Yummy!

I used fresh broccoli, just a little more potato than indicated but no garling (i'm not crazy for it!) and it turned out just fine! Thick and hearty, without all the milk or cheese that you usually have with broccoli soup... much healthier! I don't know why somebody wrote it was time consuming... it's just a two step recipe and it doesn't even need a lot of ingredients, just what most of us have in the kitchen anyway.

Simple, yet delicious.  If I wasn't concerned about fat and calories, I probably wouldn't have prepared this soup.  But I'm glad I did.  The nutritional value and delicious taste are a great combination.  It would be difficult to find a better tasting soup with fewer calories and less fat.

I used three small potatoes and maybe two cups of broth to make it as thick as possible. Cream is overrated. Added extra black pepper too. Great way to include broccoli into your lunch.

I always try recipes as written the first time around so even though I was hesitant to add the nutmeg, I did it anyway.  Next time I'd leave it out and try thyme as another person suggested.  But I gave the leftovers away and they loved it.

love that this soup has no cream to make it thick and creamy. I used fresh brocolli,2 med peeled potatoes,vegetable no sodium stock and a few florets of riced cauliflower.I not only used the nutmeg but I also put 1 tsp dried thyme in for good measure,omitted salt. I topped with a sprinkling of parmesan cheese...yum

Used a sweet potato instead of regular potato (It's what I had on hand).   Loved the soup, great with cornbread.

I've made this soup many times and have made slight changes. To start, all ingredients are fresh and organic, one red potato with skin, half yellow onion, half leak, more garlic, 1/2 quart of chicken broth and no water. Fresh lemon thyme. One of our favorites!

This is a wonderful, easy-to-make soup!

I brought the soup to a vegetarian covered-dish dinner (substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth) and many people asked for the recipe. Because the soup is low calorie and filling, serving it as a first dinner course helps me eat less of the other courses.

So good even my husband, who is very sick of soups, went back for seconds! I made some modifications: 1 1/2 onions, 3 stalks celery, 5 cloves of garlic, 1 carrot, 1 ½ large potatoes, 4 c. stock, 2 bullion cubes, 2lbs frozen broccoli, 1 tsp. red pepper flakes, 1tsp nutmeg. Turned out rich, thick and creamy.

We enjoyed this soup.  My husband said it was not his favorite thing that I have made but it was up there.  
I omitted the nutmeg and added ham I also put cheese in hubby's bowl.   We ate it with some bread.

This is a great reciepe. I saluted a half a pablano pepper with the onion and added two potatoes. Used fresh organic broccoli. Steamed the potatoes and broccoli together and used the water from steaming as additional broth. Put it all in the vitamix to purée and then returned to stove to simmer for awhile. Yummy.

Not going into the recipe box for me. Not sure if the nutmeg or consistency but didn't care for this recipe. No worries though, don't know unless you try it.

Great soup. I use different variations of this formula with other vegetables. I blended broccoli with kale this time and used butter to cook down the onions instead of olive oil. I passed on the nutmeg though. Still excellent recipe.

This really tasty and super easy! The only reason that I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because after making it, I felt it was missing something.  I added 1/8 cup grated parmesan and a sprinkle of cayenne (I halved the recipe so next time when I make the full recipe I will add 1/4 to 1/3 cup parm) and this took it to a 5 star recipe.  Thanks! Can't wait for that family to try it.  Also, omitted the nutmeg due to personal taste.

The first time I made this soup I followed the recipe exactly as stated, it was good but was lacking in flavor. The second time I made it, I added half a teaspoon of thyme during the boiling process and added 1 teaspoon of lemon juice with the nutmeg, salt and pepper.
It was awesome! the thyme added a nice woodsy flavor and the lemon brought just the right amount of tang I found the soup needed.

Great low calorie meal without sacrificing the taste! I substitute chicken broth with vegetable broth to make it a vegetarian version. Also, using less broth (about 3/4 suggested amount) makes the soup just the right consistency for me. My family loves it!

This recipe is a good base. I expanded on it a little....I had the chicken broth and also some left over chicken gravy and mashed potato, which was perfect for more flavor and the thickening agent. I love that it was so creamy smooth without any cream! I also added some baby bella mushrooms to the stock which upped the flavor some more. Steamed my fresh broccoli, then used some of the leftover water to stretch the broth, put it all in the vitamix and voila!! silky smooth, awesome flavor, I sauteed some of the baby bella's and some chantrelles to sprinkle of top when I served it. Also, saved a few sprigs of broccoli to place on top...added the nutmeg, just a hint of fresh grated and some thyme from the garden. This was good enough to write home about!:)

Well as written its SO BLAND- doctored it up (had to!) and it was very good.  Had to add a 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1 Tbs garlic powder, 2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp black pepper and 2 triangles of laughing cow light cheese.  Couple of tsp shredded parm and it was very palatable.

Yum! Made some subs: fresh broccoli, 1 cup frozen corn, and no onions (had none in the house!). The corn added a little bit of sweetness, which I like.

Very good, healthy soup - just what I was looking for! Love broccoli soup, but wanted one without all the cream and cheese. Skipped the nutmeg since I am not a big fan and used a bit of thyme and just a dash of cayenne. My favorite way of topping these healthy soups to add richness is with a tablespoon or so of no-fat greek yogurt. Stir it into your hot soup and it adds a little tang and creaminess, just like sour cream would! Also, I recommend Gisela's Butternut Squash soup on this site for another great healthy soup!

This is great!  I used a vidalia onion, a handful of boiler potatoes, very rubbery (forgot about it in the fridge) broccoli, and two stalks of frozen celery.  It is so tasty - no salt or pepper necessary!

This soup was fairly good, although I did make some changes.  I used 2 potatoes, fresh broccoli, and added a splash of red wine vinegar.  In the end, this soup seemed to be missing something, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it.  I think something like ham or bacon would add some salty richness and really make this soup amazing.  That being said, considering this soup has almost no calories compared to most main meals, it was very good.  It was creamy and thick, and left me full.  However, my husband, who hates broccoli, hated this soup.  More for me!

Quick and easy, and I found the immersion blender worked really well in the pot for getting a 'mostly pureed' texture.  The potatoes really give you control over how thick you'd like the soup to be.  I'll do it again!

Good soup.  Made according to recipe, but used fresh broccoli and an extra potato.  Hubby added shredded cheddar to his.

YUMMY!! Woke up in the middle of the night STARVING (yeah right lol). Found this recipe. Perfect and quick!  I too was scared of the nutmeg so used thyme idea. However here is MY twist on it. I had no chicken broth so used powdered chicken bouillon with 3 cups water and (secret ingredient) one can of cream of chicken soup! I did NOT add any salt as the creamed soup and powdered bouillon had plenty of salt in it. Uh oh, too fattening with the creamed soup? Oh well, I think it adds more flavor! :-) Either way great recipe!!!!

Nothing extraordinary, but a delicious broccoli soup. I used fresh home-grown broccoli, which took a little extra effort, but made for a fresher tasting soup with vibrant color. I will definitely make it again this winter with frozen broccoli.

I can't fault this soup at all! I think its wonderful BROCCOLI soup so you should definitely expect the broccoli taste! My only addition was some smoked turkey ham I had roughly chopped because I think the smokey taste is always welcome in soups but otherwise I listened to other reviewers and added my fresh broccoli right at the end to keep the bright green look and stirred in some cream cream for a smoother flavour. Also paprika spice for great aesthetic appeal! Wonderful quick and easy recipe! Will definitely make again!

Awesome!  I used canned potatoes because they come out smoother in the blender.  Also, I kept some of the broccoli chunky so the soup wasn't so green.  Add some tobasco to the blender for a little added flavor.  Very low fat--but you can't tell!

Great soup!  Didn't use the nutmeg.  I did add about a cup of water and a teaspoon of powdered chicken boullion because of evaporation.  I also used fresh broccoli and dried garlic.  It was better than an organic broccoli soup that I bought at Wegmann's!  I'd make it again.

This is very easy to prepare and has good flavor for a low fat soup.  I tweaked it a bit by adding 1 celery stalk, the zest of 1 lemon, the juice from 1/2 of a lemon , and omitted the nutmeg. Next time I would try 1/2 of an onion and cut the lemon juice in half as well as it came out just a tiny bit "lemony".  I also used fresh broccoli (10 oz. by weight).  Since I used lower sodium chicken stock I added 1 tsp. of kosher salt as well as 1/4 tsp. of white pepper.  My yield was about 2 quarts and it wasn't too thin or too thick, just right.  I used a Cuisinart stick blender and it worked great.  I served it with a bit of fresh grated parmesan cheese and it was a hit.  For qualities such as low calorie, low fat, good flavor, and ease of preparation I give it 4.5 stars.  Great for someone trying to lose weight too!

I just got done making this.  I had to keep my 4 year old out of the kitchen so he couldn't see the broccoli being added to the pot/blender.  Once it was all blended I allowed him to try a spoonful and he loved it.  Success! I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, omitted the nutmeg, and used 4 small new potatoes.  My husband will probably want more salt and pepper on his, but this is definitely a keeper!

WOW!!! I loved this soup! I am always looking for recipes that I can make low sodium because my husband has high blood pressure. So I made this as directed, except only using 2 cups low sodium chicken broth, and 2 cups 1% milk, and added some cayenne pepper and black pepper as well. It turned out AWESOME, and I just sprinkled a little salt on mine before eating. It came out very thick, and I actually added some extra milk in at the end to make it so we could dip our grilled cheeses in it. My husband doesn't even like soup and loves this recipe-- will definitely be making this again and again. Thanks!

YUM!  This is so good and healthy!  I love that this doesn't have any cream in it yet it's definitely creamy and hearty! I skipped the nutmeg and added lemon pepper seasoning instead, along with some crushed red pepper flakes. Can't wait to have another bowl!!  :)

This is a simple recipe.  It is great for adding your little touches.  I think it was a little bland. If I make this again, I'll add more seasonings and another potato to make it a little thicker.

This turned out absolutely delicious. I've made this twice in 2 weeks - the first time I followed the recipe to a T (except I left out the nutmeg; I don't like it personally). The second time I got lazy and substituited onions & garlic with garlic salt & onion powder, and only used half the amount of stock and half water, and I barely noticed much difference in the taste. I look forward to making this again soon.

I used fresh, raw broccoli and it came out very grainy.  I tried and tried to get it smoother in the food processor, but it wouldn't work for me.  Perhaps, if I used frozen or blanched broccoli and/or a blender, it would have been better.  I ended up adding cream and cheese to try and make it better (although I really wanted to do it without all the added fat) as well as additional herbs, but it didn't help.

Not great.  I thought this was too watery and bland.  When I have a pureed soup, I expect it to be thicker than this.  I didn't even add all the broth; maybe it was because I used fresh broccli instead of frozen?  Also, I added some red pepper flakes cause it was rather bland.  This one I will not make again.

This soup is great!! I chose this one because it uses potato as the thickener instead of flour. I made it with fresh broccoli and added some chopped celery. I and was side tracked during the cooking so it cooked for about 30 minutes - I blended it and it came out great. All my kids loved it- my 6yr old ate 3 bowls, I will make this one again.

It's hard to find low calorie comfort food but this recipe fits the bill.  This is simply the best broccoli soup recipe I have ever made.  I added an extra potato for extra thickness.  Thanks for sharing.

I didn't think this soup would taste good because of the ingredients listed...it just sounded too simple but I was suprised!  The soup was great and easy to make.  I had kids over and they loved the soup!

I loved this soup - so easy to make too. I used vegetable broth and fresh broccoli, but otherwise followed the recipe. It tasted even better when I reheated the leftover soup the next day.

I found it a touch bland - perhaps cream would be a nice add in but then that defeats it being so healthy! haha

Fantastic recipe! I’d love to have an estimate by volume or weight from Chef John for the heads of broccoli... I think mine were too big. I ended up adding two more cups of broth to be able to cover the broccoli. Because of the extra liquid and broccoli, I doubled the cayenne. Everything else stayed the same. I used sourdough for the bread. So delicious!

I had a big pan and Costco amount of fresh broccoli, so with more broccoli means four potatoes, 8 cups of broth, four cups of milk, and fresh thyme. I added some cooked ham, parmesan cheese and a little cheddar. This was all pureed. Then I added some cooked cut up broccoli that wasn't pureed to give the soup texture and color. Finally, I added some Creole Seasoning.

I made this today in a large quantity up until the blending stage. Tomorrow before i reheat it, i'll use my hand mixer with a couple pulses. One note, for whatever reason i could not find a potato peeler, and my arthritis doesn't allow me to paring knife, so i just chopped my potatos small and while some skins floated off in the broth, more nutrients, right? Everyone that smelled it cooking can't wait for tomorrow! Thank you!

This was a lot quicker to make than I expected - easily less than an hour.  Rather than frozen broccoli,  I parboiled two heads of chopped, fresh broccoli in the chicken broth and added them to the tenderized onions and garlic. I diced two, medium-sized potatoes rather than one.  Since we like a chunky soup, I used a hand mixer and stopped shy of puree.  Too often, veg soups come across as bland to my family, so I ground red pepper corns and kampot pepper corns.  For salt, I used chili salt.  I did not use the nutmeg.  My teenage son devoured the soup, so that's a big thumbs up to taste and texture!

Meh.  I was looking for a lighter recipe for broccoli soup.  This was not it.  Without cream or cheese, a broccoli soup needs more flavoring ingredients, maybe some celery and carrots along with the onions (mire poix).

Just made this and it's awesome! As mentioned by others, I used 2 potatoes and used fresh broccoli. I also added 3 stalks of celery and simmered it with 1 whole red chilli. Before blending, I removed the chilli, which gave a nice kick to the soup. I served it with grated mozzarella cheese. Yummy!!!

Per other reviews, I found this soup very bland. 
I added ghee, red pepper flakes, sriracha sauce, parmesan cheese, garlic powder and onion powder. It's tasty now. I'll probably shred some cheddar cheese on top. 
I tried to make it without dairy products, but I didn't like the flavor and didn't want to wasted the healthy ingredients.
I probably won't make this again.

I sautéed about a pound of bacon, added red pepper flakes, and thyme. I did not add nutmeg as it didn’t sound good to me. I also added 2 potatoes and another 2 cups of chicken broth and a bit extra broccoli. I made this because I had All The Broccoli in my freezer and needed to get rid of it, rather than for diet reasons. It has a bit of a kick and a good taste. Veggies and bacon!

This was very delicious. I  use up some of my veggies in the fridge bc I needed to use them before they went bad. I also added to the recipe, 2 jalapeños, 4 small peppers, green onion, 1 small potato, 1 small yellow onion, a small bag of frozen cauliflower, some basil, salt and pepper. I cooked it down for about 30 minutes. I used an immersion blender. The cauliflower gave the thickness to the soup, I don’t think I needed to add the potato. LOVED IT!

Thanks for posting this recipe. It was a good way to use up a bag of mostly broccoli stems in the freezer. It  was also fast and easy to make. This is not a zing-bang, knock-your-socks off kind of soup, but more of a comfort food -- and just the right accompaniment to an artisan bread, or a toasted-cheese sandwich, and/or a hearty salad on an autumn evening. We loved it.

Love this soup!  Followed the direction step by step. It was easy and tasted great.  My husband, however, thought it needed a little something so I added 1/4 tsp. of smoked paprika.  It's just like the nutmeg, you wouldn't know it was there unless someone told you but you'd miss it if it wasn't added.

I am really pleased with this soup! Super easy to make and very tasty and healthy without all that cream and dairy. I was a little hesitant when I saw the nutmeg but it turn out it really works! I skipped out on the added salt because of the salt already in the stock. Two thumbs up for this recipe! Can't wait to curl up on a cold day to have a bowl of it.

I tried this recipe because broccoli is my least favorite vegetable and I needed a delicious way to sneak it into me. This recipe did the trick! Absolutely delicious with just a hint of the broccoli taste. I used 2 potatoes instead if one. I love this recipe!

We thought this was good, but as other reviewers mentioned seemed somewhat bland as is. And for whatever reason, my batch turned out very thin. I even reserved 1/2 cup of broth in case it was too thick, plus added one more potato but it was still awfully thin. Not sure what I did wrong. I ended up adding a slurry of cornstarch & flour in order to thicken, and added adobo seasoning. With these adjustments it turned out quite good!

this came out better that i thought, really impressed with the taste considering it doesnt have any flour,  milk or any unhealthy ingredients.  the broccoli flavor was a little over powering for me but i haye vegetables and I am trying to eat more of them.  In my first bowl i put in a slice of sharp cheddar cheese and a crumbled slice of bacon.  Gonna try out different spices to see if i can liven it up a little but was definitely still good for only a few ingredients.

Good basic soup. Hearty and tummy-warming but not heavy. I swirled in coconut milk for an excellent complement of flavors. Will make it again and try different addition of seeds, cheeses and citrus juices.

I finally have found something to do with broccoli.  I eat it.  It's not a favorite nut U don't refuse it of offered.  A DELICIOUS soup never crossed mind.  I read reviews and used 2 red potatoes (diced but not peeled).  Used thyme instead of nutmeg. Added cheddar cheese during the reheat.  Ground some pepper but no salt same needed. Boy oh boy this soup is great.  Thanks

It was fabulous! I'm a huge broccoli lover, of course it my favorite. I have tried to master several recipes but it just wasn't the taste I love. With this recipes it was exactly what I have been trying to master. The only thing I change was instead of chicken broth I use vegetable broth. It was simple and delicious! Mel Chife

I didn't put in the potato. We put in 18oz of fresh organic broccoli to make up for not having the potato.  We didn't add the salt as the chicken broth was already salty and I forgot to add the nutmeg. It turned out excellent.

Great, delicious and healthy soup! It is a little bland on it's own but I prefer soup recipes this way so I can customize it how I want.  My favorite soup is broccoli cheese soup but hate the high calories so I am happy that I found this recipe.  I added a little sprinkle of pepper jack and cheddar cheese, extra pepper  and a tiny amount of sour cream.  Simple, easy, natural whole-food soup that I will definitely make it again and again!

absolutely DIVINE! :D love love LOVE broccoli so this really hit home fore me, i felt quite emotional making this, (put my heart and soul into it, ha ha) and it really went off as a hit with the kids! They absolutely LOVED it!!! I was shocked and delighted to see my child (eldest, 32) let out a scream of delight when i fed him a spoonful which was a shocker as surprise, he doesn't like broccoli but now he loves it! Thank you so much for this recipe, really. I cant thank you enough as it has really brought me closer to him and we are now going to Santiago in the winter! I will for sure! be making this recipe for him again, but without the broccoli this time, i will call it, soup. hugs and kisses, xoxoxox, martha ?? ?? ??

I found it very bland. Next time I'll try roasting the broccoli and garlic first to give it some more flavor and adding fresh herbs and spices.

I loved it . I used sweet potatoes in mine & garnished with steamed broccoli coleslaw & bacon bits. I added habanero pepper to make it extra spicy.  Perfect and tastes delicious. And it's a healthy meal too.

My husband and I really enjoyed this soup. I forgot to add the nutmeg but it was still a wonderful meal. I also had 2 slices of bread on the sides.

Excellent soup. I added a pinch of thyme and red pepper flakes, as others suggested. I also replaced 1 cup of broth with 1 cup of almond milk. Great flavor and texture.

Cut out the nutmeg (seemed kind of strange)  added red pepper flakes, had small potatoes so I used two. Smelled really garlicy and tasted really garlicy , Hmmmm, it's missing something...BACON!!! BAM!  Added half pound-ish, maybe more (who cares, it's BACON!) of bacon and just an okay soup became awesome. Would have only rated it a two or three star without the all-star ingredient.

overall a really good, clean, easy recipe...i used fresh broccoli, and add a bay leaf to the water....i always cook the broccoli, onion and garlic, and a potato in water and stock, blend when fork tender and add 1/2 cup of milk and butter... i usually add cream cheese too...

This is good. I used thyme instead of nutmeg and used 2 Yukon gold potatoes (medium sized).  This does need a generous amount of salt and pepper. I added some nondairy cheddar cheese and it was delicious. very good for those of us who can't have dairy.

I wanted so much to love this, and it wasn't bad, but it was bland.  which was surprising to me as I used fresh broccoli and didn't change anything else. Oh yes I did, I didn't have chicken broth so I used 4 cups made with 4 bouillon cubes.  Don't think that should have made a difference in the flavor.

I liked this soup, but it took four bites before I could make up my mind about it. 

I followed the recipe with the exception of using fresh broccoli instead of frozen, two medium-sized potatoes instead of one, and I added three sprigs of fresh thyme.

To top off the bowl, I added a few shakes of parmesan cheese. It was lovely. I'll definitely make it again.

This soup is amazing! I can't stress enough how simple and easy it is to make. I made it as is and it was really delicious. I used three cloves of garlic like the recipe said, but I might use four next time because I am a big fan of garlic. However the recipe as is is still fantastic and I would definitely recommend this soup if you are looking for a good broccoli soup.

I loved the soup and the healthiness. But as I was verrrrrrry hungry I decided to make the soup a little heartier so I added about 1 cup of left over brown rice. Otherwise,  I followed the recipe.

I made this according to the directions and I thought it was very good.  I especially like the low calories and low fat.  It's just a tad bland but broccoli (by itself) is not very flavorful. I make a similar recipe with cauliflower that is beyond flavorful which requires the cauliflower to be sautéed before adding to the soup.  I'm going to sauté the broccoli next time which should add flavor to this soup.

Now here is a twist, use sweet potato instead of white potato.  My daughter who hates broccoli loved it. I have used fresh broccoli as well and it still turns out great.

This is a wonderful recipe, very flavorful. I love garlic, so I added one additional clove, I used only a pinch of salt and pepper. There was too much splash with the mixer so I used a blender instead.  This is definitely going on my repeat list.

Good broccoli soup as it is. Second time, I added cayenne, smoked paprika, plenty of thyme, a cup of cheddar cheese and 2 dollops of sour cream. And small bits of ham, about 1/2 cup.  It was excellent.  I know I went way beyond the original, but am just saying you can take a basic soup like this, then raid your fridge to make it your own.  
My broccoli was frozen and I ran it through the food processor before adding it to give a little more chunkiness.

Flavor wise it's delicious... The texture is extremely thick! If you are a texture person with foods it's difficult to eat. It literally is puréed broccoli!

Great healthy soup rather than typical broccoli cheese soup with lots of heavy cream.
I did make a couple changes as well by using minced garlic from the jar which adds more of the garlic juices.  I also used one bag of frozen cauliflower and one bag of frozen broccoli then roasted them in the oven before adding.
It also needs more salt and spices to your taste or it's a little bland. 
I didn't find it watery but the cauliflower mix may have helped with this.

I've made this over and over again for my family, and they love it!  I'm always sure to serve it with homemade italian bread or rolls.  (Italian Bread II on this site is perfect for it) I've never used frozen broccoli, always fresh, and don't include too much of the stems.  Yum!

We used 6 mini Yukon Gold potatoes which roughly equaled 2 baking potatoes and really gave it that thicker consistency that a broccoli soup calls for. Very nice recipe, my whole family loved it.

I love this!  I used 3 small potatoes and did not peel them (for extra fiber) however the skins are harder to blend.  I also used fresh broccoli as that is what I had on hand.  Mine made 6 cups of soup which works out to 138 calories per cup, so it's low fat, low calorie and full of veggies!  Tastes great too!

This is a good, healthy base soup that can easily be modified.  I added a bit more broth and some potato flakes to give it a mix of potato/broccoli taste and it was good.

Definitely need to add flavor - I added carrots, celery and shallots to the onions to start. I threw in a couple of extra potatoes I had and two more cups of broth. Also added herbs de provence and cheddar cheese after blending. Tastes good and very hearty and pretty healthy.

I picked this recipe because it not only was easy to make, I needed a quick way to use my broccoli in the fridge for lunch. It was as I predicted, super easy to make and my husband raved about how good it tasted.  I added 2 additional potatoes but other than that, good to go. I will make this recipe again!

Realized halfway through cooking I had no potatoes on hand, so used radishes instead (~15 1" each, unpeeled and quartered).  Turned out to be delishe and kept the calories even lower than if I'd used a potato.  Great recipe and the soup was tasty and nutritious.

This was yummy. I used a head of fresh broccoli, butter instead of olive oil, 3 small potatoes, 3 cloves of roasted garlic, skipped the nutmeg, and used homemade vegetable broth instead of the chicken broth. So glad to find a broccoli soup recipe that doesn't use processed cheese. Sprinkling some pecorino romano on top made it perfect.

This recipe clearly needs to be smoothed out using a conventional blender or an immersion one. Hand mixers don't work well. Also it is on the bland side. You can easily correct this by generously garnishing each bowl with shredded sharp cheddar cheese to taste!

Made it exactly the way it said and it was great! I'm a big fan of cream soup but my husband doesn't like to mix cream and red wine so I was forced to find an alternative. It also freezes very well so it's great to have some in the freezer for unexpected guests or for a healthy quick meal or snack for the kids.

Changed frozen broccoli to fresh and kept all other ingredients as is including the nutmeg. End result is a very thin soup that tastes like broccoli and chicken broth. Not very appealing. Cannot taste the nutmeg at all.

Great if you are the kind of person that eats just because your body needs food and doesn't care about taste. One doesn't need a soup overloaded with creams and cheese, but this is like putting a bunch of grass in the blender. I'll freeze what I have until I figure out what to do with it. Not a repeat recipe. Healthy does not have to mean BLAND!

Just made this soup last night.  Used frozen broccoli and about 5 1/2 cups of chicken stock.  Skipped the nutmeg and added a teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes--because I like a little bit of heat with everything.  I good sized medium potato thickened it up perfectly for me.  I stirred a generous tablespoon of crumbled goat cheese in my soup.  Yummy!   This recipe will not replace the high caloric and fat cheesy broccoli soup.  However, it is a delicious low cal, low fat soup.

I was looking for a simple, healthy recipe to make after getting my wisdom teeth out, and this fit the bill. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken, and used half frozen and half fresh broccoli. It was a little bland - but that could be because I didn't use nutmeg (I didn't have any on hand). Instead, I served it with red pepper flakes (as another reviewer recommended), and sprinkled a little bit of sharp cheddar cheese on top. Great recipe - will be making it again!

This soup is very, very bland. I added about 2 lbs of cremini mushrooms sautéed in olive oil and dry sherry, a dash of sherry vinegar, Cajun spices, tabasco, etc before it was even edible. I give it 5 stars for being very healthy, but it was not good.

Good soup - not terrific but definitely good.  Used an extra clove of garlic and added hot pepper flakes while the potatoes were cooking.  Used fresh broccoli and cut the stem all the way up til the broccoli flowerettes separated, then cut the stem into small pieces. Cooked the stem pieces with the potato, then pureed it well.  Then added half the flowerettes and quickly pureed it, then added the remaining flowerettes and cooked the soup an additional 5min.  Be careful cooking the soup after it has been pureed, it can stick and burn in the bottom of the pot.  Omitted the nutmeg.

MARJORAM!!  Replace the nutmeg with marjoram and this soup rises to a new level.  My husband said it was the best soup I've ever made.  I also followed the recommendation to add more potato to get a thicker consistency.  It was fantastic!  I am getting ready to make a double batch now because my husband and I ate the whole pot of soup in 2 days.

Like others, I used fresh broccoli.  I used 2 unpeeled potatoes and had to add another can of chicken broth. I used an immersion blender and seasoned with salt and pepper and had to agree with those who said it was bland.  I added about 3/4 tsp. dried thyme leaves and stirred in about 2 tablespoons of light butter, and what a difference!  I served it as an appetizer.  My 15-year-old son, who is hesitant to try new things, said that he liked it.  My husband went for another serving after dinner.

I tweaked this recipe to get a creamier and more flavorful result. The first thing I did differently was to use fresh broccoli as opposed to frozen. Also, I omitted the nutmeg and used thyme instead. I didn’t have chicken stock, so I used vegetable stock instead. It was finished with heavy cream and parmesan cheese for a creamy touch.

Loved the recipe. It is very similar to an old potato soup recipe I made when first married. 

Yes as a previous reviewer stated the nutmeg isn't for a nutmeg flavor. It is to enhance the other ingredients. I makes a world of difference in the final outcome of the whole recipe. 

I did make changes to the recipe for 2 different reasons. 1 is allergies. The other is available ingredients. I skipped the onions because my husband is allergic to them. I also skipped the broth. That was because I didn't have any on hand. Because of that I increased the amount of broccoli by 4 ounces to make sure of plenty of flavor.

I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, I'm not sure that that's what would have made this soup so bland, though. Too bad I doubled the recipe because I had a lot of broccoli. I added about a cup of grated parmesan which kind of improved the flavour, but not by much. Sorry, wouldn't recommend this soup nor make it again.

This recipe is amazing and a great way to use up extra veggies before they go bad (or simply get your veggie dose in for the day). Don't add extra potatoes (I tried the recipe a few times) - adding an extra potato takes away from the broccoli flavor.

Delicious!  Served with grated cheddar on top of each bowl. Yum!! I made a few minor changes. My grocery store didn't have the 10oz bricks of broccoli so I bought 2 16 oz bags of chopped broccoli.  Added 2 potatoes and a bit more broth as well.  I used my stick blender to puree it at the end. This was really good and so healthy!

I followed the recipe, but added just a few extra cloves of garlic. I enjoyed this soup. It is low fat, so it lacks a rich deep flavour, but I like it because of it's subtle and light flavour. Sometimes  I find creamy soups too heavy. I add some cheddar cheese to mine if I want something that tastes more fatty. By the way, I'm not a health nut, so I don't just like this recipe because it tastes healthy...

We really enjoyed this. I used homemade chicken broth & fresh broccoli and as others suggested, two potatoes. Perfect with our stuffed baked potatoes on vegetarian night. Thanks! Oooh, and I added some parmesan and some croutons to make it look fancy!

Used fresh broccoli (peeled stems), an extra potato, and added 2 cups of water to the broth. I just roughly chopped all the ingredients and threw everything into a pressure cooker - at 15psi for 10 minutes. Served with fresh grated parmesan on top. Fast and DELICIOUS.

I used fresh broccoli, 1/4 cup of milk at the end of cooking and added some shredded mozzarella cheese and crackers when served it! Enjoy!

This is a great recipe. I used two bunches of fresh broccoli. I peeled and sliced the stocks and only pureed the flourets. I also added 1 more potato and 2 extra cups of chicken broth. I also increased the nutmeg to 1/2 tsp. This is a new favourite of mine.

very tastey but i was hoping for a  " WOW THATS BROCCOLI" taste and i think the large onion took away from that... next time i will use a small one but keep the garlic the  same... i didnt put nutmeg init because i just don't like it. The soup is thick i used a fod processer to puree it because it was alread sitting there the blender was not :) my 21m old even likes it

I was surprised I liked this as much as I did.  I though it would be boring, but the nutmeg makes it.  It was simple to make and seems quite healthy as well.

Fabulous!  I took the advice of other reviewers and added an additional potato.  Found it a little bland for our taste so I added Thyme, Basil, and a lot of fresh ground pepper.  I used fresh, organic broccoli too.  My 11-year-old whined and argued about having to even try it, took one taste, and liked it.  He is extremely particular and difficult when it comes to food so this was victory.  Rest of the family loved it!  I thought I would have to add some cream and maybe some cheese but it is not necessary at all!  I was thrilled when I saw the detailed nutritional analysis too.  This is a keeper!!

Nothing spectacular but quick, simply, and healthy!  My husband and I both liked it  - I topped it with some fresh grated cheese and use two potatoes to make it a little thicker.  Would make again.

This recipe is both tasty and super healthy.  I am giving it 5 stars because of how creamy it is without any cream.  I did not have a regular potato so I used a sweet potato and it turned out great.  I also used fresh broccoli.  I was sceptical, but it turned out very yummy and my fiance was equally impressed.

Nice basic recipe.. I would only have a few comments  (NOTE: I made 1/2 the recipe with fresh broccoli flowerettes instead of frozen if anyone wants to note that)   1. This is a bit bland for my taste but this is not bad.. always easier to add than delete.. :) I approximately doubled the seasoning plus a spot of ground hot peppers for the zip and the capsasin ) If served cold of course it would need even more seasoning (and it is good cold!) 2. The potatoe taste is very prominent 3. I feel the soup needs a finish.. I used plain yogert "mushed in" just at serving.. significant improvement in my opinion.. suppressed the potatoe and added a TANG that zipped up the recipe a bit.. cream or even butter or olive oil might also be good.. I didn't try those.  Still.. a good recipe! Thanks

Very nice simple recipe.  The nutmeg added an unexpected flavor to the broccoli.  I varied it for the leftovers using a lemon pepper that was good with it as well.

We liked it. I found it virtually impossible to use a hand mixer to blend the broccoli however. I had to get out the blender afterall and that worked great. It's a nice healthy recipe. Next time I think I'd use some cheese in it though. This time I served it with Grilled Cheese and Tomato sandwiches (recipe on this site) and it was yummy. My 8 y.o. gave me 5 stars.

This soup was genius! Such a healthy, easy, yummy soup made with a handul of ingredients most of us have in the kitchen. I used fresh broccoli, a medium red potato, salt, a decent amount of pepper, and a tiny dash of nutmeg. I ALSO put gnocchi in the soup after it had been pureed and warmed on the stove. It was perfect. My 15 month old son who can't eat dairy loved it too! I also thought broccoli soup needed dairy, but not this recipe!

The potato makes the difference!!! I really dislike broccoli but know for health reasons I should eat it. This recipe is great and a great way to get this green vegetable into the diet. It's especially good with the addition of some half and half. Thanks for a great recipe.

I am suprised at how much flavour this simple and healthy soup has to it, and how substantial and filling it is. I use all fresh broccoli when making it and i leave it chunky becuse i love chunky soup and don't yet have a blender. It's great for making up a huge pot in one go then freezing lots of portions.

So good! I thought it sounded tasty, but it was even better than I suspected. I was looking for a broccoli soup recipe (that didn't have cream or cheese in it) to use up the massive amount of fresh broccoli I had on hand. Using fresh broccoli was the only alteration I made.

Great low cal recipe. I used fresh broccoli (lots of it) and barely steamed it. Also used a bit more potato to help thicken the soup. The red chili flakes were a nice addition too. I really enjoy it.

Great recipe - I'll make it again. Used up all my fresh broccoli and cauliflower. Sauteed the onion / oil then blended with the food processor. Kept prep time minimal by chopping the veggies in the food processor, simmered in the pan then into the slow cooker for lunch next day. Fabulous soup. Thanks.

Just by reading the recipe you know it's going to have subtle flavor, that may work for some and others may have to spice it up a bit... It's not a bad soup, great if you are counting calories. The only thing I changed was fresh broccoli, simple soup to work with and if you want more flavor..add it.

Very quick and very easy and I can't have dairy so enjoyed not having to use it. I guess I am not a huge fan of nutmeg, and it seemed that's all I could taste. I might try it with some other herbs and seasonings, because I really like the ease of the soup, just not the nutmeg flavour.

I've never had a broccoli soup recipe that didn't require cheese.  My daughter is allergic to all dairy products and also a very picky eater.  She absolutely loved the soup.  It's very healthy too.  Thanks so much!

So easy to make. So delicious. I used fresh broccoli that I had left over from Christmas and added more potato as some of the suggestions said and it was fabulous. What I liked most besides the taste, was that you could whip this up in a jiffy. Excellent!
