I made this w/  prawns -- next time chicken -   it was  delicious  and  restaurant quality sauce . 
 I plan to  add  more  cabbage - as it cooked down . I  soaked noodles only 6 min. I used  reg.   green cabbage  and  not sure if  it was Chinese or regular in recipe,  as  did not  state. This is one of our favorite dishes and will be making again.... No need to go out to  get  it now- thanks for sharing  the  recipe.

update - made again  added  leftover chicken w/ sliced mushrooms and slice celery  cut  down heat as its is  spicy as written by  adding 1  hot pepper less siracha  and read pepper  flakes -still spicy -- its  a  delicious  recipe !

These came out excellent. The sweet and spicy medley in my mouth harmoniously played to the same tune throughout the whole meal. I kept going back to the dish for more. Another Chef John classic.

One of few meals I made for husband and two kids that ALL loved!  Made double which is enough for at least 6 servings.  Substitutions based on my available ingredients:  wheat spaghetti instead of rice noodles and no jalapeños.  Chef John’s recipes are the best.

Excellent recipe! My husband LOVED it... Proclaiming it restaurant quality! We will be making this over and over. The only thing I did different was not adding the cilantro, only because we do not care for it.

This is really good.  I forgot the brown sugar, but it apparently was unnecessary because this was delicious without it.  Rice noodles sure are hard to separate though.  I hope some research will help me figure out a better way because I spent many minutes pulling them apart with a fork and then resorted to my fingers and it still wasn't easy.  As usual, I toned down the spices.  I only used one jalapeno and set the hot sauce and red pepper off to the side for people to add as they saw fit.

As 1 reviewer already said this was restaurant quality.  Had lots of cabbage from our garden so used a whole med size head, also 2 carrots,  4 small green peppers all from garden had some mushrooms that needed to be eaten so thru them in.  No hoisin sauce or rice vinegar so subbed fish oil and mirin.  Also didn't have jalapeño peppers so added a little extra sirachi. everything else the same.  I never eat seconds and I had two heaping plates as did my partner!  As usual Chef John delights.

This was absolutely delicious! As for changes- I will say I couldn't find rice noodles so I just use fettuccine noodles.I also didn't use hoisin because I don't like it... but there was SO much flavor going on I didn't miss it. It was very very spicy because I used my homegrown jalapeños which are hotter than firecrackers, but my family loves the spiciness. It could easily be made less spicy by adjusting the peppers and siracha as desired. We loved it! This recipe is a keeper!

Zero changes. I liked it a lot, but will soak the noodles a little less next time, they nearly disintegrated. BTW: The leftovers were excellent straight out of the refrigerator.

This was so good! We loved it and will definitely make it again. It’s very fresh tasting. I did cut the heat down a bit for my husband and it was still very spicy. Yum!

I did it up vegetarian, with tofu instead of chicken and with edamame added at the end. Delicious! Would add a little more cornstarch next time.

I love this recipe, it is super yummy and easy to make! The only thing that I changed is the adding of cilantro just because I can't stand the taste!

Great recipe! The taste is fantastic and I felt like I prepared a real Asian dish you would get at an upscale restaurant. Plus it looks so appealing! I boiled butterfly chicken for 8 minutes and then used a fork to shred it. My rice noodles took 14 minutes to make, even though it said 8-10. I made the sauce as described, and added extra Sriracha and chili paste to make it spicier. 10/10 recipe for the win. Oh, and it did not take me 28 minutes to make. Add in all the prep time and that took me longer.

Great recipe! Needed more cabbage, so I added more. Didn’t have rice noodles on hand, so I used Chinese wheat noodles. A keeper! Thanks!

I will probably make this again. Perfect recipe to use leftover chicken. I used leftover noodles this time. Many ingredients but simple to make and very fragrant--house smells amazing!

I made this as directed.....no changes, and was disappointed in it.  It needed a splash of acidity like more vinegar, or lemon juice, and I thought the ratio of vegetables to rice noodles to small.  It makes a tremendous amount, and would easily feed 6 people as a main course.  This site has many good recipes for rice noodles / pancit, and this isn't one of them.  I will not be making again.

Made as directed except using spaghetti noodles instead of rice noodles and making 1 1/2 times the sauce.  Very good!

This was AMAZING! It didn’t sound like much but tasted soooo good. I skipped the ingredients I didn’t have, I didn’t add any sugar or oil, and I used tempeh marinated in soy sauce instead of chicken. Just beautiful!

Absolutely delicious. I added Ginger to this recipe and also topped it off with chopped peanuts. He mentioned at the beginning that the noodles where gluten-free which they are but the sauce definitely is not unless you buy the gluten-free hosing sauce and gluten free soy sauce. Please don't invite your gluten-free friends to eat this dish and less you made the corrections.

Loved it!  Made exactly as written (used Napa cabbage) and loved the spiciness.  Hubby thought it was too much heat, so next time I will back off on the crushed red pepper.  I might try thinly sliced venison steak (cut across the grain) marinated in some sauce and then sautéed.  Also agree with another reviewer that I will use more cabbage in the future.  Thank you, Chef John!  Fantastically quick recipe.
