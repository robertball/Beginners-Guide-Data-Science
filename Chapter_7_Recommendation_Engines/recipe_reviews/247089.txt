If you want to substitute vanilla bean paste for the vanilla bean, you would use 3 tsp per 1 vanilla bean so 1.5 tsp for this recipe. Also, I used powdered sugar which turned out great. I tried stevia which didnâ€™t turn out very well.

I could eat this by the spoonful! I used regular sugar because that's what I had and it turned out smooth and creamy.

I thought it was great if you don't want a whipped cream that is not too sweat.  I'll make it again.

I made this because I was wanting something for the Thanksgiving bread pudding--I have now used up all of it in coffee, on pudding, and just eating it out of the bowl and have to make more. Delicious.

I used one  my own vanilla beans that I grew and  my vanilla extract. This recipe is easy and yummy! Used regular white sugar instead of super fine. It was great!

I skipped the vanilla & added Grand instead. Loved it over strawberries.

And for a little extra touch add  2 generous table spoons of Amaretto instead of the flavored extract. YUM YUM!!
