These were amazing, we cooked them up for Cinco de Mayo, and my fiance won't stop talking about how good they were.  I doubled the batch and made a few changes and added: 1/2 t. cumin and 1/2 t. chili powder, a can of diced green chiles, 2/3 c. frozen corn kernels, 8 oz. cream cheese, a can of Rotel diced tomatos and green chiles and upped the garlic to 3 t.  I served them with shredded cheddar cheese and they were out of this world.  The diced tomatos added moisture--I noticed people had complained about these being too dry.  They turned out perfect! This one will be a regular at my house.

This recipe is basically very good, but I only give it 3 stars because I had to change it for my taste.  I didn't have the jalapenos so I skipped those.  I really don't like cilantro so I left that out.  I minced FRESH garlic myself for this recipe, and added chili powder as another reviewer suggested.  The black bean, cream cheese, onion and pepper mixture was very attractive and appetizing, but I found it needed quite a bit more salt than called for.  I added a little rice to each burrito, to make it more filling, and put a few teaspoons of medium chunky salsa in each as well.  I doubled everything in the recipe and made six burritos to freeze for my husband's lunches.  With the addition of the rice it would have stretched to about 10 burritos, but I followed another reviewers advice and saved some of the bean mixture for a dip.

All of the reviews are right - these burritos are awesome. The recipe indicates that it makes two big burritos, but they would have to be huge. We usually get four burritos, using regular "burrito size" tortillas. The filling reheats well the next day too. Great flavor and excellent source of fiber.

These weren't the best burritos I have ever had, but they were sure good.  They froze well and tasted very good.  I recommend wrapping them in a damp papertowel when you reheat them in the microwave...they'll come out tasting fresh again.

I doubled the recipe, added a can of green chiles and some cumin. Put the burritos in the oven to melt some cheese on top and then served with salsa on top...yum!!

My boyfriend and I love this recipe! I changed it a little. I boiled and shredded some chiken and added it in at the last minute. It was excellent. I also bought a box of Uncle Ben's Mexican style rice and added some of that into the burrito also. Needless to say it was gone in no time.

THE BEST!! Cut back on the onions and cilantro a bit, but left everything else as suggested.  Seriously the best burritos EVER! Also, you just have to microwave the tortillas for 30 seconds. The oven just kept making them hard and unrollable.  FIVE STARS :D!!

Very good.  I covered the burritos in pepper jack cheese and baked in the oven for 5 min.  They are delicious.

These made a quick and healthy for me today..and they are quite tasty!  I too love black beans, cilanto and cheese and they are great together as a burrito filling.  Instead of chopped garlic, I sprinkled in some granulated garlic, (approx 1/2 tsp.) and only used about 1/2 the amount of cream cheese called for. I used refried black beans since that's what I had on hand and added a handful of blended italian cheese since I had some in the fridge.  I zapped my tortillas in the microwave...was too lazy to use the oven.  I really enjoyed these with a tall glass of diet coke... (i'm sure someone has enjoyed this with a beer or two..hehe).  Thanks jessie.

Five stars for this one! It's easy and delicious, and we'll definitely make this again. Satisfying to both vegetarians (me) and omnivores (hubby). The only change that we made was to warm 4 tortillas instead of 2, making 2 smaller burritos for each of us.

Very good...I have learned when it comes to getting the full flavor of cilantro...don't cook it into the food just add it at the end and the heat of the food will be enough to bring that great cilantro taste out.

Adding the cream cheese to the mix is a great idea, but the recipe, as written, gets four stars from me because it needs some cumin (I added about 2 tsp.) for flavor and it needs some tomatoes for moisture (I chopped up 1/2 of a regular tomato). As others have mentioned,  this can be reheated for lunch the next day, and it tastes just as good. Thanks for the recipe!

This was great!  I made it as the recipe said, but I thought it was a little too creamy, so I added another can of beans (3 cans for a doubled recipe).  I paired it with lime rice, and my favorite burrito add-ons: corn, avacado, and a bit of sour cream.  1 out of 2 kids liked it. Husband & kid used salsa, but I thought it hid the great flavor of the beans.  It was surprising how flavorful these beans were.  I should add that I am heavy handed with garlic no matter what I am making, so I probably used 5 cloves of medium-small size.

I'll be making this again! I had 2 unexpected dinner guests so I had to add a can of refried beans to the black beans... just to get 4 burritos out of it. Made home made salsa for the top. Wrapped in spinach tortillas with loads of shredded cheese. The whole family plus the 2 extra 16 year old boys LOVED them!

This recipe exceeded my expectations! Who would've thought that black beans and cream cheese  would be a great filling for a burrito. Burritos virgin should give this recipe a try. Quick, easy and delicious. Will make this again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I omitted the bell pepper and jalapeno--added in a drained can of Ro*tel. I also put in a tsp or so of cumin.  This was a tasty side dish, and so versatile it would also work as a dip.

This recipe was good but wasn't excellent.  Although, I think it has great potential.  TIP: Drain the juices from the can as the recipe states or the texture becomes to mushy/slimy so that was my mistake.   I will try this again adding a few of my favorite seasonings to give it a bit more punch.  thank you!

I've cooked this 3 times now, each one a little different. First time I followed the recipe exactly but I omitted the jalapenos because I did not have any. Cooked it WITH them the second time. Use them. They make all the difference. I used red bell pepper once and green another. I prefer red. I added corn once, that was good. FRESH cilantro is a must. If you're cooking this for a crowd and you need 2 cans of beans, only rinse and drain one can, I found that if you rinse both it doesn't produce enough moisture. COOK THIS. I am obsessed with this recipe. My father and sister loved it and they are skeptics of vegetarian food. Amazing.

These were ok, I think they would have been better without the jalapenos. Based on other reviews, I added a little extra cream cheese, a little bit of sliced black olives, dash of cumin, cayenne, & chili powder, & a can of Rotel. Put the filling in the tortilla & topped with shredded cheese blend, sour cream, taco sauce, & homemade pico de gallo. Yum.

A very good start, but not alot of flavor with this recipe.  "If" I make this again there are going to have to be some changes to make it more flavorable.  Maybe something as easy as adding some fresh salsa, and some spices.

These were amazing! The only things I did differently were I left out the peppers (only because I don't care for them), added white rice, and instead of making two large burritos I used small tortillas to make about 6 small burritos. We topped them with salsa and they were delicious! Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

These were awesome. I did follow other users advice and add chilli powder, cumin and frozen corn. Also I decided to top it off with a little sauce (alfredo, pesto and jalapeno juice mix) then top with cheese and bake for about 5 min.

a good starting point, but bland to our taste.  We have since added more veggies, hot peppers and spices and it has now become a regular meal.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. It was super easy to make and really good. Since I can't eat dairy, I made half without cream cheese and it was still good (though I have a suspicion that my husband's was better).

A tad bit bland but I will definitely make these again. I'll just add some spicy salsa to jazz it up.

Pretty good after quite a bit of tweaking.  I doubled the recipe and added a can of drained chopped tomatoes, about a cup of corn, cumin, taco seasoning and a couple dashes of hot sauce.  Since I doubled it AND we like things cheesy, I added a full 8 oz brick of cream cheese.  Ooops...I think I either should have stuck with 6 oz or added rice...Lesson learned!  Also, I started by heating the tortillas in the oven as per the directions, but they became toasted instead of just warm and therefore were difficult to roll.  So I went to my old standby:  Heating them in the microwave for about 20 seconds each; Much better!  PS: I got 8 10" burritos out of it.

I prepared these burritos for dinner last night and they were a hit with my husband and kids!  I don't even like cream cheese and I thought they were terrific!  I will admit that added chicken strips sauteed in a little oil and lime juice.  SOOOO good and I will be making these again soon!

Very few times do I come across a burrito recipe that affects me so strongly, the way this one has. Like meeting a long lost lover from a past life, you will wonder how you ever lived without it. I cherished every bite as it went deep inside of me and filled me with ecstasy. This burrito did not go to my stomach, but straight to my heart to fill a hole I didn't even know existed. 4 Stars.

Wow!  These were great! I did take the advise of others and added a can of diced tomatoes, 1/2 t cumin and 1/2 t chili powder. I omitted the cilantro because I don't like it. I also used a good half of a brick of cream cheese.  Unless you have ginormous tortillas, there was more than enough to fill 4 regular sized tortillas very generously.  Great find!

The first time I made these as written and they were too bland.  Now I usually double the recipe and do the following: I add extra garlic, 1-2 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, a cup of frozen corn, a cup of fresh salsa, about a teaspoon of Cumin, and a dash of smoke flavor.  With these additions, these are ALWAYS a hit in my house!  They also freeze well.. in fact, I just ate a previously frozen one and it was delicious!

This was a great veggie burrito! My filling made 8 nice sized burritos using 8" flour tortillas. I used a full red pepper, replaced the jalepeno pepper with a 3 oz can of green chili peppers, and added 1 tsp. each of cumin and chili powder to the cream cheese mix. With the cilantro I added about 1/2 cup shredded cheese and 1/4 cup salsa, rolled them as directed, and placed the burritos in a spray coated baking dish, covered them with foil and kept in the oven at 200-250 until I was ready to serve. A little guacamole and rice-a-roni Mexican rice and my meal was complete! Thanks, this recipe just entered into my regular menu rotation!

These are yummy!!!!  I always end up adding a bit more cream cheese than the recipe calls for and they are wonderful.  So easy to prepare as well.  Fits right in my regular rotation!

Sorry, but this combo doesn't work - please just skip the cream cheese - looks terrible mixed in with the beans. Just add a dollop of sour cream on top if you want.  Beans were hard as rocks, not enough taste - use Goya's recipe for classic black beans and then add them to the sauteed mix.

Tasted kind of bland to me.  It wasn't awful; it actually has some potential.  And I'm probably going to try it again, albeit with some changes.

I followed the directions to a T and it ... umm.. tasted bland.  

Next time I will add some extra spices - maybe some chili powder, cumin, cayenne pepper, creole seasonings - and oh yeah... I'll cook it longer as well.  The onions, peppers and beans weren't tender enough IMO.  

I followed the directions exactly and this just didn't make the grade for me.  Did I mention that it was bland?  Well it was.

I added only 1/2 the onion and used green bell pepper too.  I also added some fresh ground black pepper.  I thought the peppers were to crisp so I put the entire mixture on low and let it sit for about 45 minutes.  I also cooked brown rice which I added to the tortilla along with the bean mixture and it gave it a lot of texture.

So good!  I didn't measure anything because that means more dishes.  I didn't add the salt, but other than that I mixed it up the same.  The flavor is excellent!  Great recipe!

These were out of this world! I chose to put the black bean mixture over top of romaine instead of in a burrito and used fat free cream cheese to save calories and carbs and it I didn't miss the tortilla at all! It was so flavorful and creamy. I will continue to make this again and again!

I would have liked to give this 4.5 starts, but I'm not allowed.  =(  Anyway, made this tonight FINALLY and loved it.  A girlfriend and I are dieting so I cut the oil in half and used the 1/3 less fat cream cheese.  So easy, yummy, and something a little different too. Going to make the boyfriend try it next week as I can't wait to have it again. (He was put off by the idea of cream cheese in a burrito but I'm convinced he'll like them too.)

Mmm muy delicioso!  I've been craving Mexican lately (actually I'm always cravin Mexican) and everyone agreed that these hit the spot!  I was wary of the cream cheese but didn't taste it.  I added one diced tomato, a can corn kernels and a sprinkle of cumin.  YUM! =)

i think i first made this recipe over a year ago and i loved it then...

to cut down on the fat i used a fat free sour cream instead of the cream cheese, i added frozen corn and ground turkey...

i used whole wheat tortilla's!  one of the BEST most flavorful recipes i've found.  i love it, i'll be making it again tonight (without the ground turkey)!

This recipe has no flavor. I needed to add sour cream and mazarella cheese to the inside of the buritto and cover it with hot salsa and hot peppers.

Wonderful meatless dish that tastes meaty!  Subbed green chiles for jalapeño. Used 1 envelope taco seasoning instead of cumin, no cilantro.  Added 1 can diced tomatoes.  Rolled tortillas & refrigerated to have oven ready.  Baked topped with grated cheese.  Daughter's family loved.

This is one of my favorite burrito recipes!  I give 4 stars for the recipe with no changes, it's delicious.  When I’m watching my calories I like to lighten it up considerably by using 2oz plain Greek yogurt and 1oz reduced fat cream cheese. I'm not able to tell the difference between my changes and the original recipe when I swap the Greek yogurt for the cream cheese.  To reduce the calories even more I skip the tortilla and place the filling on top of salad greens.  I'm able to get a total of 4 servings out of this recipe rather than 2 huge servings. With the changes above it's roughly 151 calories per serving.

Very good!  Since it was just for me, used half can of black beans (like them don't love them ;)), 1 cup frozen corn, 1/2 tsp cumin, can of rotel tomatos with green chili as someone else suggested, and about 4oz lite cream cheese. Heated that, then took tortilla, spread some sr cream on it, sprinked shredded cheese and microwaved for about 15 seconds, then added shredded lettuce, sliced black olives and added the hot mixture.  Really yummy and I have leftovers which will have this week!  Thanks for recipe.

This was EXCELLENT! I absolutely LOVED IT!  The kids loved it as well. My husband wasn't fond of the cream cheese, so next time I will probably cut it in half. I also think some diced tomato would taste good. You could really add just about anything to this and it would make it more hearty!

Extremely easy to prepare and you won't be disappointed. So delicious! Also, you can put half as much oil in, if you want to cut down on calories/fat.

So incredibly delicious and easy to make. So flavorful. We did leave out the onions since we really don't care for them as much. But I will for sure make this again! AWESOME!!!

I didn't think this recipe was anything to write home about.  It was simply "ok" in my opinion.  The filling was really thick and pasty. Did not love it.

Very simple , very delicious. I doubled the recipe to feed a family of 5 but I think I might not double the cream cheese next time. It was good but a bit too rich. To much cream cheese took away from the fresh flavors of the veggies.

This is really a great start for this recipe.  We also add bbq sauce, cumin, sweet white corn, chili powder and canned chilies instead of jalapeno so the kids can not have any surprises.  We also put a little bit of a seasoned rice in the burritos along with tomatoes, cheese, thinly sliced cabbage or whatever sounds good.  we eat every little bit of the leftovers every time.

A little bland to us. These would be suited to our tastes better with the following additions: cumin, chili powder, salsa. But otherwise this was simple to fix & not a bad meal! Thanks for the recipe :) Update 12/2017: We liked them much better now. I don't think I did anything any different. Maybe I added more salt this time than I did back in 2010? Not sure. I rolled them in a pan and poured over a can of red enchilada sauce and a bit of cheese and baked them til the cheese melted. That was it. Very satisfying and my 5yo asked me to keep them on the menu.

This was a delicious dish, recommended to me when I put in a request for recipes - it's simple, quick, easy, and DELICIOUS.  I made a couple of changes, namely adding corn and chicken.  I actually got some fresh corn from the market, boiled it on the cobb for 5 mins for that tendercrisp freshness, then carved it off of the cobb and tossed it in at the end since it was already cooked.  The chicken I cooked first and separately, using the onion, garlic, olive oil, adding white wine, chicken broth, and a couple splashes of soy sauce.  I removed the chicken and set it aside, then tossed in the red bell peppers for a couple minutes, and followed the recipe from there (I made double the recipe for 2 people, since I was serving 4).  Since the chicken was separate, it could be added to each individual wrap as necessary, and I went with whole wheat wraps, and chives in lieu of cliantro.  I also cut up some roma tomatoes which could be added or not when you put the wrap together; adds a fresh burst - didn't do jalopena peppers because my two sons who were eating them with me and my wife are 4 and 2, and they would have cried if they ate something that spicy.    :))    Overall, love it, very flexible for customization, and so  good!!

I made this recipe exactly as written, but because it is suppose to only be enough for two burritos, I doubled everything (except cilantro).  The original amount would have easily made five or six burritos unless you are packing a tortilla so full of filling that the sides won't meet when folded over.   I thought this was going to be a wonderful meal as I was making it, but then when I added the cream cheese it all went wrong.  The smell immediately filled the kitchen...I can't quite put my finger on it, but it wasn't appetizing.  Despite my better judgment, I soldiered on and presented this along side cheese, sour cream, salsa.. you know, traditional burrito accompaniments.  When we finally were able to make it past the first bite we found the cilantro (which you'll remember was not doubled) was too overpowering and we really like cilantro. The consistency of this recipe was too chunky too enjoy. There was way too much onion/pepper in comparison to the beans.  All of those things can easily be fixed though simply by adding or removing things until everything is to your (my) liking.  However, I still wouldn't make these again because they were bland, the jalapeno (I put extra) was nonexistent, there was no garlic flavoring, no heat, no spice.. just lots of cilantro and cream cheese.   I very rarely rate things poorly here, but when I make something that smells like a wet cigarette I'm definitely speaking up!

A really good base recipe. I was happy to find a tasty but filling meatless recipe. I increased the amount of everything except the bell pepper - I only had about 1/2 of one. I used whole wheat tortillas, added some basmati rice seasoned with cumin and garlic powder, 2 cans of black beans, an 8 oz brick of light cream cheese, skipped the jalapenos because I'm not a big fan, but added some red pepper flakes, as well as cumin and ground coriander instead of fresh cilantro. They're yummy!

I thought the nutrition info looked high too but I checked all of the ingredients and came up with 690 calories and 34.8 grams of fat (close enough).  This recipe is only for 2 servings so per serving: tortilla is 210 cal & 5g fat, veg oil is 124 cal. & 14g fat and cream cheese is 149 cal. & 14.85g fat.   I hate when something that sounds so good and easy isn't so healthy :-(  Would be easy to modify to reduce calories & fats.

These were not to our liking.  Maybe it's just that it wasn't my taste, but...I usually love black bean burritos.  My stomach flipped over just from the smell, and I didn't like the look of it either.  This is probably the worst tasting thing I've ever made.

For ease of prep, and taste, these are fantastic! Mine were soupy, not dry, but I tripled the recipe, and maybe my peppers and onions had a lot of moisture. I served it with a citrus-cilantro rice. This would make a good soup too! TIP: I like to wash bunches of cilantro, dry them well, and freeze in bags for fresh cilantro anytime...I can't get enough of it! =)

This was good, but I don't know about the "best ever" designation. The cream cheese was a nice touch. I didn't have any jalepinos, so I added some of my favorite spice, cayenne pepper. I also used dried cilantro, and it probably would have been better with fresh.  I made this for dinner with a friend, and she said she liked them, but she had to add cheddar and salsa on top of hers to give it more flavor. We agreed on a four star rating, as I had to add cheddar to mine as well. Overall, I would say definitely try these, but be sure to have some extra toppings on hand to give some flavor.

Excellent Recipe.  Hubby liked it too.  I did however follow some of the other  advice and added cumin, chili powder, cayenne pepper and garlic salt to give it a kick.   We'll be making this again!!!

Decent and amazingly easy and fast to prepare.  Like some other reviewers, I found the cream cheese made it a bit odd for a burrito (though the texture it provides is nice).  Next time I might use some real cheese (jack? cheddar?) and sour cream instead.

This is so easy a delicious... I make it all the time! I am lazy and I heat the tortillas in the microwave for about 15 seconds before I fill them instead of heating them in the oven, but it's terrific either way.

We weren't crazy about these. I think they would be better if we had added sour cream instead of the cream cheese. The cream cheese flavor was a little odd for burritos. The red peppers were a nice combination with the black beans.

These burritos are excellent! Thanks Jessie! I've passed the recipe to several others who have also praised them highly.

For my taste, I found the proportions of all ingredients to be perfect! That doesn't seem to happen all that often to me. (I do use reduced fat cream cheese, though.) 

I sometimes double the recipe. Also, I add rice to the burrito and freeze leftovers.  They freeze very well and make a great lunch or supper!

These were pretty tasty, but the cream cheese made the filling get kind of gummy after awhile.  Maybe I didn't eat them quickly enough.  I will try again with less cream cheese or a different kind of cheese.

These burritos are delicious!  I was looking for something a little different, and these were great.  Instead of the jalapeno peppers, I used canned green chilies.  I think it would be even better with more veggies.  Thanks, Jessie!

Pretty good.  I used cheddar instead of cream cheese & doubled the veggies.  These freeze really well, so double or quadruple the recipe and have some handy in the freezer.

A wonderful recipe.  Fast, delicious, easy.  I serve with salsa for more complex flavour.  I prefer to heat my tortillas between damp paper towels in the microwave, they're softer and easier to fold that way.  Otherwise, Bravo!

Yummy and quick! Thanks for sharing. :-)
I used green bell pepper (less expensive) and I added mushrooms. It made three medium-sized burritos.

I followed this recipe as written and was surprised (based on all the reviews) at how bland it was. I even added hot sauce and it didn't help much. Next time I make it again, I'll leave out the cream cheese and add some rice and cheddar cheese instead to make it a real burrito. Out of all the 5 star recipes I've made from this site, this was the first that wasn't that great but again most people have altered it.  I think that adding another cheese would make a lot of difference in the taste, so I would highly recommend it for flavour.

A good burrito and a versatile recipe. I followed Lucy's review suggestions, adding cumin, cilantro, a can of green chilies, and a can of Rotel to the black bean mixture. Recipe was easy to put together, and I liked it.

Four stars only because I added a few things. I left out jalapeno simply because I didn't have one. I added about 3/4 can of diced tomatoes with chiles undrained, about 1/2 tsp cumin and used 4 oz cream cheese. I also added shredded monterey jack cheese before I wrapped up each burrito. Fabulous Lenten meatleas meal.

Per other reviews, I added 1/2 cup of corn, a fresh tomato, 1/2 tsp. of cumin, 1/2 tsp. chili powder and some taco flavored cheese. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and omitted the cream cheese to make it healthier. I put a little bit of salsa in the bottom of the pan and put the wrapped the tortillas in a glass pan to heat up in the oven later in the day. The meal tasted a little bland, even with the spicy salsa.

These were delicious!  I did some modifications that others have suggested: doubled the recipe, used a 1/2 t of cumin and chili powder, 8 oz cream cheese, a can of tomatoes with diced green chiles, and increased the garlic.  They are excellent.

all around great burrito! The recipe is so versatile too. I added my own fajita seasoning and cumin to the onions, peppers, and beans. I also used seasoned black beans to begin with. I omitted the jalapeno, because I do not care for spicy foods. I also left out the cilantro because I didn't have any on hand

A good starting recipe but I thought the cream cheese ruined it - not only does it take away from the flavor, the texture turned more pastey than anything.  I served with a side if cilantro lime rice - next time, I'll put the rice in the burrito, top with the bean mixture [w/o cream cheese].

We eat mostly vegetarian and this was wonderful!  Added 4 fresh garlic cloves, 1/2 t. cumin, 1/2 t. cayenne, 1/4 t. chili powder, extra can of black beans, 1/2 can of diced tomatoes.  Omitted jalapeno (cayenne was nice substitute). Used 4 ounces of cream cheese. Topped with jack cheese and avocado.  We loved it with either a pita pocket or a burrito shell!  VERY affordable and it goes longer than two burritos, especially with the extra can of beans.  Thanks for the great recipe!  The cream cheese was wonderful!

Overall, this was a great and easy recipe to whip up. I upped the jalapenos a bit and added a bit of chili powder. When we assembled our burritos, I tossed in a bit of shredded extra sharp cheddar cheese and threw in some sour cream. Served with salsa verde and chips, with a side of corn on the cob, this was fantastic! I plan on trying to freeze these in the near future, so I'll be back with an update on freezability. Thanks Jessie! :)

I used neufchatel cheese to make this recipe a bit healthier.  I also added corn, tomatoes and green chiles from Hatch, New Mexico.  The neufchatel cheese really thickens up the mixtures and adds that something special to this recipe. I strongly encourage everyone to try this!

This is a nice base for a burrito but was really bland.  I mixed it almost 50/50 with salsa to give it flavor.  Still thought it could use more seasoning even like that.  It is an easy base though, and I like the cream cheese in it but not very flavorful as is.  Makes an easy leftover, too.

What a great twist on a traditional burrito.  I had no problem with dryness on this recipe.  I followed this recipe exactly.  I put the tortilla in the oven for 15 mins and the burrito was stiff as a rock and I had to throw it away.  Maybe 5 mins would be better.  The jalepeno was not overpowering and the cilantro made this dish.  The amount fills 2 large burritos perfectly.  I served with Mexican Vegetable Rice on allrecipes.

My 12-year-old decided he was going to be a vegetarian so I thought I would try to find some meatless dishes to make for dinner. I'm glad I found this one. I forgot to buy a bell pepper so I substituted Ortega brand green peppers instead. I also added cumin and chili powder to the bean mixture as recommended by other reviewers and added Spanish rice to the burritos also. My daughter said it tasted like a burrito from Chipotle. I doubled the recipe and it made enough to feed the six of us. The name of the dish certainly fits the meal.

This is a very dry recipe, but the taste is good. Next time I will try to add sour cream instead of cream cheese, and see if it comes out less dry. Enjoy the taste, easy to make, but not a fan of the dryness.

I love these burritos; they do not require a long list of ingredients and are SO delicious! My husband and I make these often. We wrap leftover burritos individually in foil and then put in freezer bags; you can reheat in the microwave or oven. I like to add a Tbsp of taco seasoning to the bean mixture (check out Allrecipes for homemade taco seasoning recipes: quick & inexpensive!)

I love these burritos. My hubby likes them too, and that's great considering he thinks there should be meat in everything. They were even great for my one year old. My new go to mexican dinner! Didn't change a thing and wouldn't suggest to do so.

Made these as directed except adding additional garlic. This was good but kind of bland so I think next time I will add some corn and chopped tomatoes and maybe some taco seasoning to it just to up the nutrition and flavor. Thanks

Really enjoyed this! I used half the cream cheese, left out the green pepper and the salt, and added a little (2 T) minced ham. I pretty much just used what I had on hand and what sounded good to me at he time. Family loved it and I'll certainly be making this again ~Thanks!

These were really good! I thought it was going to be plain at first, because there isn't any actual taco seasoning, but it turned out to be wonderful! I did double the recipe and got about 6 or 7 burritos

Really good, following the advice of another reviewer I added some cumin and 1/4 cup salsa since I didn't have any bell peppers... The jalepeno's and spicy salsa (bought by accident instead of mild) were a bit too hot for us; I ended up having to mix in a can of refried beans... Next time I'll try to fix them the right way! :)

Even though I like cream cheese, and I like every other ingredient in this recipe I was disappointed in the end result.  I just didn't really like the cream cheese mixed in with the beans, peppers and onions.  I'd prefer leaving the cream cheese out and topping with shredded colby jack cheese once the filling is on the tortilla and adding a fresh squeeze of lime juice to top it off.

Love the cream cheese filling.  I think I also used this recipe to make enchiladas.  Simply make the burritos, set in a pan, top with a can of enchilada sauce and shredded monterrey cheese.  Bake at 350 until cheese browns, probably 15 min and enjoy!

Honestly, these weren't delicious.  As the recipe stands they would have been bland, runny and unfilling as can be.  Knowing just by looking at the recipe that they wouldn't be appetizing to us, as is, I added a can of drained niblet corn, a whole truckload of spices (italian seasoning, red pepper flakes and cumin) plus upped the pepper to almost a whole teaspoon (fresh ground).  I also added two huge handfuls of cheese (because they sure weren't going to hold together without it.  And I upped the cream cheese to almost a full tub of the spreadable stuff.  I rolled them (made ten tortilla wraps), put them in a baking dish, sprinkled with more cheese and baked for 15 minutes to melt the cheese and heat the filling.  I served them with a dollop of salsa and a side of spicy rice.  They filled us up...but they just weren't anything to write home about, even with my changes.  I can't imagine how disappointed we would have been if I followed the recipe to the letter as I usually do the first time I try something.  Nope, won't make this again, sorry.

I'm a fan!  Love burritos but never got around to making them at home.  I'll use this recipe as a base from now on.  I added half a can of no-salt-added canned diced tomatoes, about a cup of corn, about a cup of brown rice, some scallions, and a mixture of cayenne, cumin and chili powder (I went a little heavy on the cayenne - definitely gave it a punch).  Used slightly less than the 3 oz. of cream cheese but had no problem with the flavor - worked perfectly - will add the full 3 oz. in the future.  Also cooked four thick slices of bacon and tore them up and added them to the mix. Did not add any other cheese or salsa.  Used whole wheat burrito-sized tortillas and made four heaping burritos.  Freezed one and will see how it works defrosted and microwaved.  In the future will try this with green bell pepper (there was a lot of red going on) and maybe even play with some spinach, avocado, grilled chicken, etc.  A BIG fan of this recipe - thanks for posting!

Ohmygosh, YUM! I sauteed celery, bell pepper, and a whole onion in EVOO, put in a little chile powder and salsa, and made 4 burritos instead of 2. Used the microwave for the entire process, ridiculously easy. Will make these again!

I made this exactly as directed except that I used a can of chopped green chilis instead of chopping a jalapeno and I sprinkled in about a teaspoon of chipotle powder (for some extra spice and a bit of smokiness).  It was a little bit dry, but not too bad.  The flavor was great and very quick to make.  I will make it again, but next time I will not drain the chilis, as someone else suggested and maybe try adding a can of corn too.  Good recipe though!

This recipe was totally easy and a success!  I used crystalized ginger b/c I had it at home and left the pepper out.  
I wrapped each burrito in foil and kept warm in the oven until dinner.  The extra burritos were put in the fridge and eaten for lunch the next day.  Still great!

Everyone loved this meal.  I followed the recipe almost exactly as written.  I did add one cup of cooked rice which gave us 10 small burritos.  One can of black beans was enough to feed the four of us.  Thanks for the recipe!

These burritos are excellent and very healthy if you use fat free cream cheese. I used regular cream cheese the first time I made these, and fat free the second time. Even my 17 year old brother couldn't tell the difference!

My husband isn’t fond of vegetarian recipes, but this one did the trick.  
He absolutely loved it.  
Very simple to make and very tasty too.

Easy to make, nor do they break the bank! I could live on these if I had to, my boyfriend says the same thing as well. Sometimes I add shredded chicken and usually substitute the fresh jalapenos for canned. Good staple food for vegetarians and college students, or I make these to eat for picnics, or just when I am on the go. The additions of corn kernels and cheddar cheese make this dish even better.

These were good, but I changed them quite a bit.  Added cumin, chili powder and about a cup of corn to the pepper and onion mixture; subbed sour cream for the cream cheese and then layered fresh guacamole on the tortillas before adding the rest.  Topped with shredded cheddar and YUM!  I'll make these again in a heartbeat (and you must be making these babies Chipotle size to get only 2 - I have enough filling for at least 4 normal sized burritos).  Enjoy!

I'll start with a huge caveat- I've never tried making these with cream cheese.  Just can't bring myself to do it.  However- we make them all the time with shredded Monterey jack/cheddar mix and they're so filling and flavorful and good!  Quick, easy recipe for a weeknight supper.

Awesome recipe.  We made a few minor changes.  I drained the beans, as per others suggestions, added olive oil, and stirred in a can of rotel tomatoes.  I sauteed the onions, garlic and pepper, added the beans and rotel and heated.  Then I just put it all in the crockpot on low until dinner.  YUM!  Great recipe.

I didn't have minced jalapenos so I added a 10 oz. can of RO-TEL diced tomatoes and green chilies. Had to add an extra 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese due to the tomato juice.  They were fabulous.  Have made these several times since.

These were really delicious and easy to prepare.  I added 1/2 lb of sliced top round rubbed with a mixture of 1/2 tps red chili flakes, 1/2 tps cumin, 1 tps chili powder and 1/8 tps cayenne.  I browned that in some olive oil and removed it to a bowl before cooking the veggie mixture.  I then stirred the meat back in along with some fresh diced tomatos right before adding the cream cheese.  My husband loved them.  I will definitly be making these again.

Delicious!  I also added some sliced baby bellas and taco seasoning and extra garlic.  Left out cilantro.  Used diced green chiles in a can instead of minced jalapenos.

I had to re-review, even though I gave this 5 stars the first time around.  I just made these again -- my husband, lover of meat, told me we should make these often, which pleased me 'cause I thought they were absolutely fabulous!  To lower the fat content, I used PAM instead of the oil.  I added a whole diced jalapeno (seeded, but next time I'll add some seeds too) and an extra clove of garlic.  These are great with just salsa... no need for cheese or sour cream.

This recipe is a keeper. At the end, I added some spinach on top of the mix and covered the frying pan for a few minutes to let the steam cook the spinach, then I mixed it all in. Didn't bother with the oven either, I just nuked the tortillas (I found this recipe made 4 burritos rather than 2).

YUM, YUM, YUM!!! If you don't try these, you are missing out!!  Perfect just the way it is, but also easily adaptable to your tastes/needs (I like more garlic and jalepenos; my husband likes less cilantro).  We eat these all the time!  Thanks so much, Jessie!!

We live on two acres in a forest and a windstorm had come through and dropped limbs and branches everywhere. Our friends volunteered with the cleanup.To keep them fed and myself outside as much as possible, I had prepared these early on and set them out on the patio table. I had found some pretty colored twist tie type of things at a party store, so I tied two together around the burrito to keep them tightly closed. Then I placed the burritos around a mexican platter in a spiral pattern. I had salads and fried tortilla strips from this site and a non-alcoholic drink bar. Everyone said it was the most unique work party they had ever been involved in. And they all raved about the burritos. Everyone really enjoyed them. Several people wanted the recipe.

Anyone who knows me can tell you that I LOVE black beans AND fresh cilantro AND tortillas, so when I find a recipe that contains ALL of them, I'm a happy camper!  This is a great twist on a burrito even though I cheated.  I used frozen diced onion, green & red peppers, and then used a tsp. of jarred hot giardinera relish for the pepper.  But I only did this because I didn't have time to do all of the chopping.  I had some left over cream cheese & cheddar cheese mixture (from poppers made over the weekend...a good way to get rid of it) and that did the trick.  Very good, although as it cooled it became very thick, so I topped the mixture with taco sauce...YUM.  I may give this a try as like an appetizer as well, refridgerate & then slice.  Thanks jessie!

Very good, and I'll make these again. I had enough bean mixture to fill about 3 10-inch tortillas. I was out of garlic, so I added garlic salt-- BIG mistake, they ended up being overpoweringly salty. I added salsa and cheese prior to rolling them up. Also added green onions. Will try again, with minced garlic and NO SALT!

This recipe is wonderful!  I use it all the time, especially when I'm in a pinch or I just can't figure out what to make.  Since I've found it, I always have the ingredients on hand.  I usually double the recipe, giving me four servings, and keep it in the fridge.  I could eat this for days and not get tired of it!  Thanks a ton!

I'm not a very experienced cook, but, this is the easiest recipe I've tried.  Very delicious, but, can that nutrition information be right?  I've never seen anything with so many calories and fat--it must be wrong.  I'm not a huge onion fan, so, I made it with 1/2 an onion instead of whole, and, I also added 1 chopped roma tomato at the very end.  I don't have kids, so, I couldn't give a kid friendly rating.

The cream cheese really makes these good.  When I made them a second time I added a little cheddar and some chopped tomatoes--it gave more texture to the burrito.

OK, by my own personal rating, I'd give this 4 stars.  But I'm giving it a full 5 because not only did my family go back for seconds...they talked about these for a few days after!
I cut fat by using 1/3 fat cream cheese, dbl the black beans, added rotel and green chilis and some of the additional spices such as chili powder and cumin.  Topped with salsa and a reduced fat cheese blend and baked.  Then served topped with chopped lettuce, roma tomatoes, and reduced fat sour cream.  That combo make 5 or 6 really fat burritos.
Like I said...the family raved.  Really good on day 2 as well.

This was DELICIOUS! It was a hit with my kid also. I am glad I read the reviews because I tweaked it a little. I added rice (can't imagine not adding rice) and also spiced it up by using garlic powder and cumin. I also added more garlic than the recipe called for. I substituted jalapeno for green chiles. It was very good and I look forward to the leftovers. I can't understand the reviews complaining it was bland. You don't have to be a great cook to look at the ingredients and decide you may need to spice it up a little if you don't like mild.

These where bomb I followed tina's advice and added some chili powder and kernel corn and some diced tomatoes and green chillies from rotel.  Mine didnt turn out dry at all in fact rice might have made the consistency better. But none the less these where awesome for around $10 at the store and stuff that was just sitting in the pantry

Not flavorful even with salsa and homemade guacamole on top. You couldn't even taste the small amount of jalapenos. The skillet looked very yummy with the beans, pepper, and onion, but I think the cream cheese ruined it.

An extremely boring and tasteless dinner tonight.  Made these exactly as  written and the only feedback I got was "tastes like a bean sandwich".  And then everything got thrown out and we ate turtle cream pie for dinner.  Won't be repeating this one but I suppose if you like bean sandwiches, the positive things I can say about this was it was very easy to put together and quite inexpensive too.

Fixed this for my husband and myself. It was delicious and easy to make. Each burritos is large and very filling. I will be making this again soon.

My husband liked this and asked me to make it for him again, but I didn't care too much for it.  I think it's the cream cheese.  Maybe I can change it up somehow more to my liking, but as is I'll only make this again if my husband requests it.

Excellent dish. Great for busy weekdays and cooks very quickly. I followed the recipe completely, the only exception is that I did not add jalapenos since our little kids eat it too. Also, after I put the filling in and wrapped it into tortillas, I put them on a hot pan with a bit of butter and waited to get a nice crust. I did not warm them up in the oven.

Made this tonight for the 2nd time in a week!  This time I doubled the recipe so we could have leftovers. :)  Added hot peppers separately (for Hubbs and I) and even my 3 year old loved it! Yum, yum, yum!!

I've made these a couple of times now and they are really yummy but the first time I made them, I felt they could use a little more kick. I made a few changes, mostly just personal preference. I used a whole bell pepper, added a cubanelle, a whole jalapeno and just a bit of sriracha hot sauce. I omitted the onions, the cilantro and the salt. I also used less cream cheese (2-3 tbsp) and added a bit of tex mex blend shredded cheese into the tortillas.

These were very good, and easy to make. I used a slightly different method in order to avoid having to stuff and roll them at the last minute. After simmering the ingredients I stuffed and rolled the burritos, put them in a baking dish and put a little salsa and cheese on. I then heated them in a moderate oven for about 20 minutes before serving. Thanks for the great recipe!

Great recipe!! I mostly followed it except I omitted the jalapeño an instead added a can of rotel tomatoes with green chilies, a handful of fresh spinach, and one red potato that I diced and roasted in the oven with cumin, chili powder, salt and pepper. I served this on small corn tortillas warmed on the stove top. Super yummy!!!

This is a nice and easy dinner that doesn't take much time to make and tastes great. I make it a couple times a month. I skip the jalepenos, but I add some chili powder. The veggies take longer to cook than the recipe states. They need maybe 10-15 minutes to soften as opposed to 2 minutes. I usually skip warming the tortillas first, too. I sometimes make the burritos as is, but I like putting rice in the burritos. They also taste good topped with salsa.

I found it rather tasteless. I had to add some liquid seasoning to make it somewhat tasty. Works better as a base for a bean dip than actual entree.

I thought this was fantastic. Very simple, easy, and made a ton of food that'll keep well in the freezer or fridge. I followed some of the other advice here and added corn, green chiles, cumin and chili powder.

Way too hot for my tastes, but still a good recipe. Next time I would definitely scale back the jalepeno. A teaspoon is too much, maybe just a pinch!

Really good. I halved the cream cheese because I'm not a huge fan, didn't have jalapenos so I omitted those and added a little cumin. Husband and kid loved it.

I never liked beans much but I've decided they're not so bad and I should try this recipe. I made it this afternoon and enjoyed it very much! I used red & green bell peppers and added cayenne. I didn't have jalapeños but didn't miss them. I used neuchatel cheese and ate the burrito with salsa fresca which had the cilantro. If I didn't have the salsa fresca with tomato & cilantro the burrito may have been too dry in which case I would've added tomato in with the beans near the end to keep them fresh. I'll definitely be making this again!

Easy, fast, yummy!  Daughter LOVED them!  Used canned green chilies b/c I did not have jalapenos on hand.  Skipped cilantro again, because I didn't have it.  Although think recipe needs it.  Will definitely make again (w/cilantro)!

This is one of the more delicious foods I've eaten that is pretty healthy for you. Aside from the vegetable oil and cream cheese, there are many things that make this nutritious. I only give it a four star because I feel it requires a little more flavor, which I found by adding cheddar cheese on top just before I roll the tortillas (not to the mixture itself). This was suggested by other reviewers as well.

Really good. My 18 month old ate an entire burrito and my 5 year old said he loved it! Also got approval from the husband...so I will make this over and over.

Added rotel, corn an extra can of kidney beans, cumin, and Velveeta cheese in place if the cream cheese. Fed our family of four, plus leftovers!

Very quick, easy, and delicious. I forgot to add the cumin but will try that next time.  I added only one ounce of the cream cheese  (vice three) to cut down on the calories and still found it to be flavorful. Taking the leftovers into work with me tomorrow for a nice lunch. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I've had this recipe store in my recipe box forever, and wish I had tried it sooner. Fast, easy n' super tasty. I subbed light cream cheese to reduce the fat. I also baked 'em afterwards with a little hot sauce and cheddar melted on top. So good!! Will definitely make this one again.

This was great! :) My husband loved it! He said it could be in competition to Chipotle. I changed a few things because I didn't have them on hand. I used a green bell pepper instead of red (by preference) and I didn't have any jalepeno peppers so I just added chili powder. As some reviewers mentioned, they added cumin and that's what I did - it helped. In the burrito I added some rice, diced tomatoes and mexican cheese. It was easy, quick and delicious!

These are wonderful. Trying to cut cholesterol for hubby but find tasty dishes to make. Used fat-free cream cheese, tortilla's, and no cilantro (don't care for it). My boys even like them. A nice change from the red meat or turkey. I also used canned/chopped jalapeno's. I don't use the oil either, no need.

Needed more flavor, so added chili powder and cumin. Also used a can of Rotel, as recommended by others and stuffed our tortillas w/ rice too. I had no problem with it being too dry or too runny. Just thought the red pepper had an overpowering smell and flavor. I normally like red pepper, but may try green next time or skip altogether.

Absolutely delicious! I added chili powder, cumin, a few drops of Tabasco, and a pinch of oregano. I also added 2 tablespoons of salsa. Served over rice with a tortilla on the side, as mine came out fairly saucy. Fantastic, will definitely be a staple around here!

This is a really gtrat meat-less recipe.  I have made it MANY times as written, and with alterations.  I have found a super easy way to cheat when I am in a time crunch-- I heat up ready made fresh pico de gallo (found in produce isle) and add the black beans and cream cheese and voila!!  The only difference is there is tomatoes added that way which tastes great to me!

Pretty easy to make, delicious, and, if light/fat free cream cheese is used, fairly healthy! Not to mention, filling because of the beans!

This was quick and tasty.  Per other reviews I added some spices - cumin and cayenne and also some corn.  My significant other and I both really enjoyed the added corn.  Used 8-inch tortillas, and still have a lot of filling (probably another 2-4 worth).  Thanks for a quick, filling recipe!

Delicious! The first time I made this I added a can of drained Rotel diced tomato because some reviews said the mix was dry. I thought adding the Rotels made for a wet sloppy burrito. Second time I made as noted and prefer them this way. It is not dry it simply "sticks together" so it isn't falling out of your burrito.  To punch it up I used the Philadelphia Cooking Creme - Santa Fe Blend and it added so much flavor additional seasoning wasn't needed. Toasted my wrap till it was crispy and ate it flat topped with salsa. Great recipe!

This made great bean burritos! I only had pinto beans but that worked out just fine. I didn't have any cream cheese so I put some cheddar cheese. I had some sausages which I added for more meaty flavor. Cilantro at the end really added some awesome Mexican flavor I really love.

Good and EASY!!  Only needed to 'doctor' it a bit with some cumin as others suggested.  A good alternative to black bean burgers.

This looked great...until I put the cream cheese in. I would have preferred it without the cream cheese.  I didn't care for the taste and it just made it sort of gloopy.  I doubled the recipe and used 6 oz of cream cheese and it seemed like too much.  That said, my husband thought it was great, so I give it 3 stars.

One word: AMAZING!!! It was so easy and so delicious. I used fat-free cream cheese and olive oil instead of vegetable oil, for a more healthy alternative and it did not taste healthy (which is a good thing)!

These burritos were really good, just not quite a favorite.  I added shredded chicken to the mix for some meat, but it certainly wasn't necessary because there's already so much in it.  I also made white rice with lemon juice to put in mine, and that was very nice.  Otherwise, I stuck to the recipe, and it turned out pretty good.

My husband said he didn't even miss the meat, which is high praise indeed. I used finely chopped red bell pepper, half of a chopped jalapeno, doubled the amount of minced garlic, added a can of diced green chilies and one small chopped roma tomato. I did add about one tsp of ground cumin, 1/2 tsp of chili powder and 3/4 tsp salt. Served with Mexican-style shredded cheese (a blend of cheeses including cheddar and asiago) and salsa. Really good and will make this again. Thank you!

We LOVE these burritos and make them often. The flavor is wonderful, and though the cream cheese makes the appearance a little strange, it's important that you don't leave it out. I find this to have just the right balance of crunchiness, spiciness, and healthiness! Great for leftovers, too.

Really delicious. I added lime, eliminated the salt and reduced the vegetable oil. They were still so delicious and much healthier this way.

Loved it.  Added chicken with garlic and chili powder.  I also made some white rice, guac, salsa, and sour cream.  What a meal.  Chipotle has nothing on this one.

Wow!  I was surprised at how delicious this was.  My family loves mexican food but I haven't found many recipes they love.  They absolutely loved this.  We're not a fan of bell pepper so I left it out.  It was great without it.  I printed a copy of this recipe and it is going into my recipe box to make over and over.

This was possibly the best burrito I've ever had. As soon as I took the first bite I regretted not making more. The only thing I would change is maybe add more coriander.

My husband and I love the black bean recipe, but didn't necessarily like them as a burrito. These would be delicious served as a side, or over saffron rice, or even with some cheese as a dip with chips.

excellent recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I doubled the jalapeno and used 1 ounce of reduced fat cream cheese instead of 3 ounces...I didn't want the other flavors to be overpowered by cream cheese. I served it with reduced fat cheddar cheese and the "fresh tomato salsa" recipe on this website. Everyone loved it!

These are the best black bean burritos I have ever had.  I fiddled with the proportions a little to make enough for the whole week.  Instead of jalapenos, I used a small can of diced green chiles.  I also doubled the cliantro because I love the flavor it adds.

Very very good.  I got my mother to eat two heaping servings and she hates black beans.  Only a four because I can't imagine this being a two serving recipe.  This with some rice I made fed five with plentiful leftovers.  Also, I made some additions: no salt, a chopped tomato, some corn, and more pepper (I used orange).  Will make again

This was great but I did make a few changes. I added cubed chicken cutlet, two cans of Rotel, and some guacamole. I made this for the family a few months ago and I've been harassed about making them again ever since. I'm making them tonight

This was ok. I thought it tasted a little bland so after omitting the salt, added a dash of garlic salt instead. I also added a small can of green chili's and put in some sliced cheddar cheese.

I did not use cream cheese, cilantro, or jalapeno's. Instead I added chicken and some salsa. Next time will grill the peppers and onions first so theyare softer. I also added cheese which makes everything taste better! Good way to use black beans. Thank you!

As written, this is just ok, probably a 3 star recipes really.  Making additions as recommended in the top rated review (chili powder, cumin, rotel, etc) ups the flavor significantly and makes it a lot better.  But even so, while it was fast and easy to make and tasted pretty good, it is wasn't something I would really rave about.  A good quick weeknight meal though and I will use it again for that.

•Don’t mince Jalapeno. Dice. Nice and big peices. (Unless you don't like everything chunky) •Cook peppers, onions, and 1 tbs cilantro in lime juice and EVOO. •Add 2 teaspoons of cumin and paprika, and black beans. Mix and let cook. •Add about 2 ounces cream cheese and 1 tbs milk. •Let thicken, add 1 tbs cilantro. •Spoon on to tortilla and eat.

We tried this recipe several months ago, and it instantly fell into rotation at our house.  We have these burritos at least once a month.  They are so easy to make, they're inexpensive to make, and they are delicious.  The only change we make is to add 1 can of diced tomatoes.

Delicious! I added more veggies than were called for in the recipe - more bell pepper, a can of corn, and 2 cans of tomato with green chilies.  I also add more cream cheese to compensate for the extra ingredients, and some taco seasoning (I just eyeball it).  I usually add the garlic, but forgot this time, and didn't really miss it. Overall a really wonderful, quick recipe!

This made 4 burritos for us.  They were amazing. I used less oil to save some fat/calories and neufchatel cream cheese, but otherwise made as written. The boyfriend asked me to make it again the next day!

This recipe is a staple at my house.  It's a quick easy meal when I want something satisfying, fast.  I make it just as it is written, but at times have also added corn, chopped summer squash, tomatoes, salsa or chicken.  I also like to add chili powder for spice.  It's a very versatile recipe.

Great starter recipe - I adjusted a bit based on some other reviews.  I left out bell pepper and jalapeno.  I upped the cream cheese to about 6 oz.  Added a can of rotel and a can of corn.  A dash of cumin and a dash of chili powder.  THESE WERE GREAT!  Making these adjustments - we got about 8-10 servings.  Great leftovers.

From the reviews i thought this was going to be out of this world the best burrito ive ever had! It was good, but not fantastic. I'll make it again mainly out of convenience; i always have those ingredients in my kitchen!

Perhaps I got something wrong...but these were a tad bland...and very gloppy/unappetizing looking. They did taste good, but I was hoping for more flavor.

They were easy and not bad.  I think there is potential for improvement with some experimenting.  I need to take more time to read the helpful reviews on others before I try these again.  This time, I made them according to the instructions with a few minor changes.  I used Trader Joe's Cuban Black Beans. I skipped the salt.  I added a cooked box of Goya spanish rice.  I topped them with avocado.  I think they would have been much too soupy without the rice.  They were a bit too bland.  Need to be kicked up a notch next time, but I'll try them again.

This isn't 100% accurate, as I was missing some ingredients and I had some steak that I sauteed in oil and taco seasoning, but it was a winner either way!  Thank You!

These are very yummy indeed. I omitted the bell pepper simply because we didn't have any on hand, but it turned out great. I also made them into tacos instead of a burrito. My vegetarian hubby and I loved them.

I think these burritos are amazing, and I have made them many times over the last six months.  Very addicting because of the cream cheese and all of the vegetables.

These were really great.  I only gave it 4 stars because I made alterations to suit my personal tastes.  I used half a red bell pepper and half an orange one.  I used at least 3 times as much garlic (sorry, I never measure things... I always eyeball them).  I also used 2 jalapeno peppers.  I used a lot more cilantro because, quite frankly, I love the stuff.  I used 4 oz of cream cheese and diced a tomato to increase the moisture.  I didn't use the large tortillas, because I prefer smaller portion sizes.  Besides, making smaller burritos means making more burritos.  That makes lunch/dinner easy for a few days.  Once I filled the tortilla (used whole wheat btw), I added a few feta cheese crumbles on top before rolling it.  The feta cheese adds that extra oomph of saltiness without going overboard with the cheese, and therefore the calories.

This is really yummy and easy to make. I made some rice with chicken broth and put it in the burrito too. I also put some lettuce, tomato and salsa. I didn't have cilantro so I skipped it. My husband doesn't like vegetarian foods but he LOVED this. I will definitely make this again! Thank you for the recipe - it's a keeper!!

YUM! I doubled the amount of black beans, kept the cream cheese amount the same, subbed canned green chiles for the jalapenos, added a sprinkle of taco seasoning, and added cheese before wrapping them up. Same basic recipe, but adjusted for what I had on hand. Made 5 or 6 burritos when combined with some rice.

This is good, but better with some of the previous suggestions.  I added grilled chicken, corn, grated Mexican blend cheese and drained Rotel tomatoes.  I served it with cilantro lime rice.  It was okay as leftovers the next day for lunch, but it was better fresh.

I took a chance and made these while staying with my family in a beach cottage last March.  They wanted me to cook some Mexican food for dinner one night, but most of my older family isn't used to Mexican or spicy food, so I was trying to find things that I thought they would like.  I saw cream cheese with this one, and figured I'd try it.  They all absolutely loved these burritos, even my 82-year-old grandmother and her sisters.  I made them exactly as the recipe said, and I don't think I would change a thing the next time.  They were delicious and simple to prepare.  I think I will make them for my husband and myself this weekend!  Highly recommended.

Honestly, I only used this recipe for inspiration.  I feed my family of 6 with this easy variation: heat up 3 cans of black beans, 8oz of fat free cream cheese and chopped onions in saucepan until all cheese has melted. After warming up the flour tortillas in the microwave (about 20 sec), I just pile on the bean mixture, then shredded cheese and salsa.  The whole family enjoys it and it only takes about 10 mins from start to finish. *and pretty healthy

Really good!  Made as written except omitted jalapenos (didn't have any) added a pinch of cayenne pepper instead.  Also used dried cilantro.  Next time, will add a little corn.

Very Yummy.  My husband was very skeptical when he saw it, but I even got the thumbs up from him.  I didn't have any jalapeno peppers on hand, so I used some diced green chiles instead.  Will be making again.

Thank you so much for this simple tasty recipe. the only thing i added was about 1 tsp cumin, and 1/2 can of rotels,which i drained and reserved 3Tlbs of juice to add.I think your garlic amount is perfect. I just ate mine and spooned some addition rotels on top. Love Em. thanks for great simple recipe.

This is really good but the garlic is to much.  I make this just as the recipe states without the garlic and it is great.  I make them a little smaller and freeze them for lunch all week. Easy and good.

Great, had to bump up the chilli but that's just me , straight from the directions this is good I just like it hotter and found the cream cheese a little  over powering, might try with raw sweet corn next time to give a little crunch and sweetness this is a great starting point that I can see going in so many direction, but again from the original it's really good

I like the idea of this recipe more than the actual taste, at least on my first try.  It's a nice, filling meal, but I need to play with ingredients because it was a little bland.  Thanks to those who made suggestions--hopefully I'll have a more successful second try!

yum, these were better than I even thought they'd be!  I used dice green chilis (in the can) instead of jalapenos because I had them, and threw in some shredded cooked chicken. (one half-breast.)  I made three STUFFED 10" burritos- oh my gosh, this has to serve more than 2 even without the chicken!

Tasty and easy!  This is a keeper and will be used again at our house.  We used pepperoncini peppers instead of jalapeño because that’s what we had, I’m sure both would be great.

This was delicious, but, of course, we didn't stick with the recipe. Because we were feeding seven people, we added a solid pound of ground beef which we browned first, and then proceeded more or less as indicated in the recipe. While a couple of the family memebrs had it as burritos, most made taco salads with corn chips, lettuce, avocado, etc. It was very good, and my bean-phobic husband said, "Hey, did you notice I ate my beans and didn't say anything?" We all have a bit of the two-year-old in us! Thanks for a delicious launching pad!

I made this recipe exactly as written at first, tasted it and it definetly needed some additions.  I added some adobo seasoning and sazon goya to the bean mixture. After wrapping the burritos I covered them with warm queso.  Delicious with modifications.  Only giving it 3 stars because it's bland without the changes.

I do something similar, but using the low carb wraps.  Delicious and not too hard on the carbs that regular flour tortillas can deliver.  I'm diabetic and those flour tortillas can really spike my BG's.

I made these for dinner and they were so good I signed up just to leave a review!!
I made these just as described but I cooked a chicken breast first to add some meat to the mix. They are REALLY good!! you can add/subtract any of your favorites to make this "your own" but I really enjoyed it just the way it was!! Thanks!!

This burrito was REALLY good! My boyfriend hates everything in it except the jalapenos and black beans, but I wrapped it all up so he couldn't see the ingredients and he LOVED IT and asked for seconds, and couldn't even guess what was inside of it. He was in awe when I told him all of them. I added a little lime juice because it did come out a little dry, but next time I think I'll add diced tomatoes as others have suggested and a little sour cream added to the mix. Thank you!!

Good, but not great. I added canned corn and canned diced tomatoes. Use a mexican cheese blend instead of cream cheese or omit the cheese alltogether for a much healthier version.

Great recipe, a hit with the family even my 17 mth old ate it! I altered it a bit by adding fajita seasoning, green peppers, fresh garlic and a bit of sour cream to the mixture. I will be making this again - minus the fajita seasoning, I think it was too overpowering for the dish.

I hate to be a kill-joy but, I found this recipe SO bland. It needed a real kick even after I doubled the number of jalepenos this recipe called for. I covered each burrito with homemade salsa and guac which helped a bit but, all in all it wasn't my favorite.

This was okay, but not anything special.  My husband and I get these Goya Rice&Bean boxes that I think work better and are less work then this recipe.

This was pretty good!  Even my non-vegetarian hubby was okay with it.  I was going to increase the cilantro, but decided to follow the recipe, and I'm glad I did because it was perfect as it was.

Not nearly as good as I expected and no one in my family cared much for them.  They were just okay.  Nothing wrong with them, just kind of disappointing.  I doubt I'll make these again.

These may not look pretty but with a few changes to make them a little less bland they are yummy and easy.  I add 2 tablespoons hot taco sauce to the mix as well as ½ tsp. cumin, salt to taste, and some corn.  At the end I add some lime juice (a personal preference) and diced avocado.

I'm giving this only 4 stars because as written, the recipe would probably only ear 3 stars but with the changes that the other reviewers made, I would give it 5 stars. It definitely benefitted from the close to a cup of salsa that I added as well as the shredded cheddar. Yum and I will certainly make it again!

Bland, bland and bland.  Worse recipe I ever made.  Total waste of time and money.
I even added extra garlic, some cumin, corn and salsa and nothing helped this burrito. Like eating wet cardboard.  I am amazed so many people like this recipe.  Truly amazed.

I love these black bean burritos. We are big fans of burritos and these are some of the best. I added chicken and a can of green chilis. These were amazing leftovers also!! Everyone at work said "mmmm, what's that you're eating??"

These are awesome! I made whole wheat tortillas and added a little chili powder and cumin to the beans to spice them up a bit. Maybe a 1/2 tsp of each. I also had to add a 1/4 cup of water or so because the beans were really thick.

Wow, these were good. The cream cheese gave it a smooth finish and held it all together. Stayed really hot (I like that), and it was very satisfying, in spite of the fact it was vegetarian. All vegetaraian dishes should taste this good.  Cheap, delicious and easy to prepare - everything you want in a recipe. This one's a keeper.

I give this recipe, as written, four stars, but I have added some additional things to make it a five star recipe.  I added sliced fresh mushrooms, spanish rice (I use packaged precooked for ease) , and a can of rotel tomatoes (partially drained) to the mixture.  This really adds to the volume and flavor.  You can also wrap these up and put them in a casserole dish, pour a can of red or green enchilada sauce over the top, sprinkle with shredded cheese, and bake until warm for a variation on the traditional buritto.  With some additions,these are my favorite vegetarian black bean buritos ever!!

This was very good.  My family just gobbled them up.  
I did substitute whole wheat tortillas for flour, olive oil for vegetable, whole red pepper instead of half, cooked dry beans (add about 1 teaspoon salt per recipe batch), 2 teaspoons minced jalapenos, 1 tablespoon dried cilantro and 1 tsp cumin. 
I will definitely make this again!  Thanks Jessie!

These really are delicious!  I will certainly make them again and again.  I used 4 Tbsp of cream cheese and added a little ground cumin and cayenne pepper. Next time I would use only 1/2 a small onion, it was a little too much onion for me, and a whole red bell pepper instead.  I might also try adding a can of green chilies to the mixture.  All in all a quick and tasty dinner recipe!

This is an easy and delicious burrito.  You can adjust the jalapeno for heat and add some more spices for flavor.  I rolled the mix up in tortillas and covered with chihuahua cheese and put in the oven for a few minutes to melt, smothered with salsa and voila, awesome!

This was really good!  I did spice it up a lot based on previous reviews.  I added extra jalapeno and even some red pepper; I also added shredded chicken and used a ton of cilantro.  I found that it still lacked a bit in flavor.  I'll definitely make this again and try some additional spices.  It really does make for a great meal!

WOW! This was definitely a hit, even with my youngest daughter who is not a big fan of mexican type foods. I doubled this recipe, using diced green chilis instead of the jalepenos. I also took about 1/4 of the black beans and pureed them in my mini-food processor along with some chili powder and cumin, and the salt called for in this recipe, and added them to the pan at the same time as the cream cheese. I served these with a spanish rice and a smoky chipotle type fresh salsa....YUM YUM! This will definitely be made again, and soon!

I was very excited to make these based on the reviews.  I couldn't have been more disappointed.  These were bland and not interesting at all.  Definitely needs way more spice and less cream cheese.  Boring.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I think its a bonus that you can add so many extra ingredients depending on your mood.  On its own, its a great recipe.  I think it can be improved depending upon the amount of work you want to put into them.  Rice, chili powder/hot sauce, corn--all go great with this.

Overall tasted good, but the black beans could've perhaps tasted better/softer if cooked a bit longer.  You can get at least 4 burritos (using 10in. torillas) out of the suggested amount though, not just two! -- So don't try to divide the entire mix between two burritos otherwise the 10in. tortillas won't remain closed/wrapped up! Also I mixed shredded cheese into the mix right before putting it in the tortilla. Nice quick recipie though.

We added corn, and then as we assembled the burritos we added a little shredded cheese (either jack or cheddar or mix) and some salsa. Teenaged daughter and my husband loved these. I thought they were good but not great. However, I'll make again because I like to make vegetarian meals occasionally, and good ones are hard to find. This was easy too.

Oh wow, these are awesome! My fiance loved these and it is nice when I can offer him an alternative to beef. I subbed reduced-fat sour cream for the cream cheese and didn't sacrifice a bit of flavor. Also added cumin and chili powder as others suggested. The addition of the sour cream at the end moistens up the beans and makes a nice light brown sauce that helps meld the flavors. These beans would make a great side dish too. Dinner in a flash!

I thought these were just okay.  The mixture inside the tortilla was a little tacky.  I think maybe if I added some salsa they might have been better.

What a great recipe!  I never would have thought of cream cheese in a burrito.  I'm definitely going to make this again.  Very easy to make.

Well, the name suits this ... they are delicious.  I didn't have jalapenos or cilantro in the house, so I added a little hot sauce and jalapeno sauce.  I also omitted the salt.  Turned out great.

We substituted mushrooms for the red bell pepper, and 1/3 fat cream cheese; doubled the recipe and cooked it in a pot instead of a skillet.  Tasted fantastic.  

Served 5 adults, 1 burrito each, with 1 burrito leftover.  On it's own though, 1 burrito each was not enough food for this hungry crowd.

I added cayenne pepper and chili powder, and didn't use any cream cheese  -- instead, I topped the burritos with fat-free sour cream and salsa. Delicious!

I tried this recipe and it was soooo easy!  We reheated it last night and It tasted even better the next night!  The second night we ate it I shredded two chicken breasts and added to it.  It was great!  We also used it as a dip for tortilla chips.  I think this would even be good in a seven layer dip.

I used pinto beans instead of black beans and two jalepenos (could have still used more) and added some rice--Very tasty!  Would have been just as good without the tortilla-just over rice. Will definitely make this recipe again!

These were soooo good and much faster to make than I had anticipated.  I had to substitute kidney beans for black beans since my store didn't have black beans.  The leftovers were also great warmed up in the microwave.

These are really good!  And also makes for a very fast meal.  My entire family loved this recipe.  Out of my 6 children 4 of them loved these--even my very picky 5 year-old daughter.  (My 2 year-old only eats a few things and my baby isn't eating solids yet.)

I added just a pinch more of salt and a 1/2 cup of Rotel to spice it up.  This recipe is one of my family's favorites.  Serve with sour cream and lettuce on the side.

Made it again without the Rotel and it was just as good if not better.   I am thinking next time I want to roll these and place in a baking dish and bake for 10 min or so

Added lime juice, extra cheese in the tortilla, topped with salsa and cheese and heated at 350 covered for 20 min.  Family loved it.  I also increased the cream cheese and would next time increase the jalapeños as well.   Would decrease the black beans and add in more veg like mushrooms  and pinto beans. I think the addition of spices would be great as well (TINA)!

I served it with guacamole and sour cream.
 Overall loved the basic concept as a base and you could easily whip this up as is.

I cannot believe I haven't reviewed this recipe yet!  These burritos are EXCELLENT!  I am giving this review four stars, only because I do top mine with shredded cheddar cheese and salsa, and warm them into the oven at 350 degrees for 10 minutes, to make it a five-star recipe.   Even my husband - who usually insists that he must have meat with every meal - asks for these regularly!  GREAT vegetarian option!

Very good recipe!  I doubled it, and we made a number of smaller-size burritos out of it.  We have a Mexican grocer that makes fresh tortillas, but they didn't have any of the 10-inch size.  Fresh, soft tortillas really added to things! 

This was very easy and quick to make. I loved the nonfussy prep.  I chopped the onions and bell pepper in a chop wizard, which made it take under a minute.  Diced the jalapeno and garlic, but still, very quick prep. 

I did think that it needed a bit more kick than just the salt, so I sprinkled Penzeys taco seasoning on to taste while the beans were cooking, and a little more when I added the cream cheese. Still could have used more zip.  The cream cheese gave it a lovely, enchiladas suizas-like character, but mellowed the jalapeno and spices out a bit much.  Next time, I might use 2/3 the recommended cream cheese and more jalapeno to keep things spicy. As it is, I made it spicy by shaking a little Marie Sharp's habanero hot sauce on the filling before wrapping the burrito closed. But, this is all just personal taste on the seasoning level...it's a great recipe to start with, bland enough for people who don't like super spicy, but able to be added to.  

I think you could do a lot with this, but it's great as-is.  You could add shredded chicken or pork to the mix if you wanted a meaty filling, you could add roasted corn, you could make the burritos with rice filling along with the bean filling, a la Chipotle, etc.  

Quick,easy cleanup, too.

Had to try this for Meatless Monday. It was DELICIOUS! and so easy to make. I added a can of diced tomatoes with green chilis - drained. 2 tsp. cumin and 1/2 tsp. chili powder. My husband didn't miss the meat at all! Definitely going to be part of our Meatless Monday menu.Thank you so much Jessie for sharing!

Excellent burritos.  Easy and quick to make. Added a little cumin, put some mexican cheese on top and baked at 350 for 5 min.  Served with salsa and some sour cream.  Very good.  This only serves two people, so you may need to double the recipel

Well, I actually only had a tiny taste of this recipe because two of the grandsons immediately polished off a burrito each. They gave it five stars and agreed that salsa and rice were good additions - one used Sriracha sauce as well! Thank you jessie - this recipe is a keeper.

WOWW This was amazing!! They were gone quick. The most helpful positive review from Tina was a great adjustment (see below). I added everything except the corn kernels and it was one of the best vegetarian burritos I've had. Will make again. Thanks for the recipe


1/2 t. cumin and 1/2 t. chili powder, a can of diced green chiles, 2/3 c. frozen corn kernels, 8 oz. cream cheese, a can of Rotel diced tomatos and green chiles

I loved this recipe!! I didn't have any cream cheese but I did everything else exactly as the recipe states. I used shredded cheddar (that was what I had on hand). It was fantastic!!  Definitely a keeper!  I will try it with cream cheese next time though just to see if I love it even more!

I loved it but my partner said it was good but that it tasted "really healthy"... so 4 stars. I added more jalapeno and garlic than the recipe calls for and used chilli powder and cumin to season the filling. I also stirred in chopped avocado and rolled the burrito up with shredded cheddar. Next time I will also add green chiles and diced tomato, reduce the amount of onion, and bake the burritos in cheese and homemade enchilada sauce. We ate the leftover beans with tortilla chips. Definitely making again, sooo yummy and easy!

I think the cream cheese + cilantro makes this really good.  I like to add brown rice, and whatever other veggies seem like a good idea for the day.  But this base recipe provides a really nice flavor :)

Delicious! The crispness of the red pepper together with the flavors of cilantro and cumin was so good. We really enjoyed these! I was going to post a photo but we ate them too fast.

Oh, so yummy!!! We cooked our black beans in a slow cooker which made these even better, I think. My hubby loved these, too, even though he was a little skeptical at first. He likes a meat burrito, but he really enjoyed these!

Made recipe as stated and it was very good, but I liked it better before the cheese. The second time I made it I added a can of rotel tomatoes and used 1/2 the cream cheese.  Definitely will add it to my rotation.  Thank you!!

We are new to the whole vegetarian concept and this was one of our first efforts.  We like lots of flavor so we added cumin, coriander and chipotle chili to the spice list and increased the fresh cilantro.  We also added some brown rice to increase bulk and fiber.  We doubled the recipe and had enough left for lunch today.  We did not miss the meat at all and agreed that this would become a regular for us.

Added rice, taco seasoning, 8 oz of cream cheese into mix.  Spread a little salsa on tortilla and added shredded cheese- everyone loved it and had seconds.

With some modifications suggested by others, it was a winner.  The cream cheese is genius!  I used 1 medium onion, 1 medium red pepper, a can of Rotel, 2 cans of black beans, 8 oz pkg. of cream cheese, a cup of frozen corn, 1 t. Cumin, 1 t. Chili powder, 3 t. Of garlic and a 1/4 cup of cilantro.  Yum, yum, yum!  topped off the burritos with salsa and sour cream and it came together in about 20 min, including prep time.  This is going into the regular weeknight dinner rotation!

Theses were really good, I made some adjustments. I  added zuccimi amd a few ,ore vegis. i seasoned the vegetables like I would regular tacos, chili powder, season salt, cumin, and fresh garlic. I also mixed the cream cheeses with adobo sauce that chipotle chilies come in, and was such a good flavor. Paired this dish with Mexican rice and bam we had dinner, so good!

Great recipe!  Easy, cheap, and healthy!  I added a couple of tomatoes and some rice.  Definitely added more substance to make it more filling, and I'm going to get a lot more than two burritos!  Absolutely amazed at how great these are!

Trying to cut back on red meat just got easier! This recipe truly is delicious and easy to adjust according to your family's spice tolerance and what ingredients you have available at the time (For example, we used Havarti instead of cream cheese).

I didn't think the combination of ingredients was going to be anything stupendous, but I was really suprised how good the burritos were.  We didn't have bell peppers or jalapenos, but used chopped green chili peppers instead.  It was also very simple...my 12 year-old made them.

Very good and quick lunch dish.  I am gluten-free so instead of 2 flour tortillas, I made 6 corn tortilla foldovers. I had no cilantro but used the rest of the ingredients as listed, with estimated amounts, no time to measure.  It was delicious and my son really wanted more, so I guess I'll be doubling the recipe next time I make it.

These were SO GOOD! Because some suggestions by other reviewers sounded good, I also added a can of Rotel w/green chiles, corn, cumin, chili powder, and extra salt. This made about 5 burritos for us - I'm sure my additions bulked it up a bit. I meant to make rice to put in the burritos too, but forgot. That would've made for one or two more burritos, I'm sure. This will be in our regular rotation. Thanks for sharing, Jessie!

Before I rolled up the burritos all I tasted was cream cheese with some heat from the pepper.. Added more beans, more cilantro, and cumin and chilli powder as others suggested but it still was not good. Baking the tortillas first also made them crunchy and they broke when rolling up.

So good! I couldn't believe how easy and yummy it was. I couldn't find canned black beans so I used red kidney beans but it tasted so good. I also added chopped mushrooms into it to add more veggies into it and a full red pepper rather than half. Will be making it again!

This recipe was good. I used one can of black beans and I left out the bell pepper and jalapenos since I don't like them. I followed the advice of reviewers and added one can of diced tomatoes, though fresh tomatoes would have done well too. I used one onion and cilantro and about 4 ounces of cream cheese. I also added about a half teaspoon of powdered chili pepper and half teaspoon of cumin. I didn't add the salt- the recipe didn't need it! I also added some leftover corn I had in the fridge. I put cheddar cheese inside the burrito with the bean sauce. I kept the leftovers in the fridge. It tasted good cold the next day, I ate it with crackers as a dip and it was yummy.

This recipe is .si simple and delicious! Loved by the whole family. I wouldn't change a thing about it. Make black beans and rice for dinner one night and use the left-over black beans to make this recipe the next day for lunch or dinner.

I use less cream cheese and the recipe is still extremely creamy. I also use reduced fat cream cheese just to have a little less cholesterol. I am a carnivore but I never feel cheated or hungry with this recipe.

This recipe was absolutely perfect exactly the way it  was written! It was simple and delicious. I served it with some Spanish rice and the whole family gobbled them up! I doubled the recipe and served it to my family and a friend. (5 people total) There was plenty for seconds. Really great, easy and quick recipe! Thanks for making it easy to serve my family healthy food on the go!

I tried this yesterday and it was great.  It made three decent size burritos instead of two but that was okay.  Just a suggestion; at the end add chopped salsa and squeeze fresh lime over the top.  We live in Mexico, so the chopped salsa is the norm and limes are another food group.  Maybe grated cheese if you like.

This was great- everyone loved it. I made a few small changes: I spread some refried beans on the tortilla before putting the cream cheese/bean mixture on, I then sprinkled some Mexican blend cheese on and rolled them up, then I stuck the burritos on a George Foreman grill for a minute or two.

Don't let the cream cheese scare you. It's yummy. My family rolled their eyes when I told them we were having a vegetarian dinner. Then they all raved and came back for seconds. The recipe says 2 servings, but it makes 3-4.

The taste was wonderful. I savored it even more the next day. To me, the looks wasn't the greatest.  It looked like a whitesh gray clump.  But did I say it tasted wonderful?  We are doing more vegetarian meals.  This one was a success. I didn't even need the cheddar cheese that I put on the rest of the family's.  We like cilantro so that was no problem.  I had no jalapenos so I used some peppers in adobe sauce. Nice smoky heat.

One of the best recipes I've tried on this site!  Make sure to note that the recipe (as is) only makes two burritos.  I like the idea of using this as a dip.

These were pretty good.  I was surprised to see that they tasted good even without some kind of mexican spice or cheese (other than the cream cheese).  However, we enjoyed them even better with the addition of some cheddar jack. :)  I also used dried black beans instead of canned.

My family loved this! I did as someone has suggested, added 1 can of rotel, omitted jalapenos and addded more cream  cheese about 5oz, then I used my quesidilia machine to grill them.. a huge hit at our house!! Thanks for a great meat free alternative.

Based on other's reviews I added cumin, a can of green chiles & more salt. Served it with shredded cheddar & salsa on top. Delicious & easy to make. Very flavorful!! It definitely makes more than 2 large burritos! I'd say 4 at least or 6 if you don't fill them too full.

This made a quick weeknight meal for us. It didn't knock my socks off, but I can't complain about it. I definitely had enough filing for four burritos, though!

It was really good but so very delicious with Tofurkey Corizo style thrown in. Got my husband's blessing to make it again, which says a lot. I'm a new vegetarian, so finding a good and easy recipe is like finding a treasure trove.

WOW! I'm not a bean person, nor am I a burrito person.  My husband is both of those, but he's not an onion or bell pepper person. My 17yr old son is none of the above.  I made these up just like the recipe reads (oh, minus the fresh cilantro cuz I forgot to buy it, plus I didn't know what it was).  Anyway, this has become my husbands favorite "will you fix me a late night snack" request.  I absolutely enjoyed them as well.  And my son, well, he couldn't resist the aroma, and broke down and ate one.  Two days later, we all wanted them again!! I've made them three different nights already.  Eventually I will get that cilantro and see what else we've been missing!! OH yeah, one more thing, after the first night of making them, we decided the tortilla's were not going in the oven anymore (they did get crisp, I probably did it wrong) so now I either warm them a few seconds on each side in a non-stick skillet, or in the microwave between damp paper towels.

I have made this recipe several times, and I love it as is.  I add more fresh ingredients that mesh well with the flavors if I have them on hand, the more the merrier.  I've made it for company as well, and every time the recipe gets rave reviews.  

Personally, I feel like the amount of mixture this recipe makes is way too much for just two burritos, but that's just me.  We use it as more of a soft taco type of dish, and if there are leftovers we use it as a bean salsa.  YUMMY!!

This was pretty good. As others have suggested, I added a little cumin, but otherwise prepared this as-is. The results were reasonably good both as a burrito and as a dip. I don't know why some people thought this made too much filling. Using the quantities in the recipe I was able to make 2 burritos, neither of them anywhere near bursting. I'll make this again, but next time I'll try some adding some cheese and/or salsa on top, as I think that would enhance the finished product.

This recipe has become a staple in my house. As others have noted, it's great to freeze the ones you don't eat and pop them in the microwave for two and a half minutes when you want them. This recipe makes three regular-sized burritos for me. Thanks, Jessie!

Yep, delicious, despite all my best efforts. Decided to double the recipe since there are three of us, but only had one can of black beans and no red peppers. So I added a can of pinto beans and a tomato instead of the pepper. I also added a half a cup of chicken broth and simmered for a good five minutes or so because we like our beans well-cooked, then mashed them a bit. Added half a bag of baby spinach and forgot to double the cream cheese. Was the end result quite jessie's recipe? Probably not, but I don't think any of my changes dramatically altered the nature of the dish. The cream cheese, which is her real innovation, makes this. They were delicious, indeed, and crazy easy. Thanks, this is going into the "make again" folder!

Yummy!!  Cooked this tonight for my vegetarian kiddos.  I did make a couple of changes- mostly that I used 10 six inch corn tortillas rather than 2 big flour tortillas.  This really is enough to feed a family of 4.  I also used the whole red pepper and followed the advice of one of the other reviewers by melting a pinch of cheddar cheese over each tortilla.  Mixed some of the extra cilantro into the rice I served with it, and we were ALL impressed.  Gluten free and vegetarian.  
I do think that some shredded beef or chicken would have been tasty with it, but that's only because I'm a carnivore. :)

It doesn't get much easier - I swapped out the bell pepper and the jalapeno for a can of ro-tel tomatoes with chiles.  I made tacos with a squeeze of lime juice and a sprinkle of cheese for dinner, then  brought a little container to work and ate it with chips for lunch.  So good!

Good, easy, fast, and my family loved it. I did as others suggested... doubled the recipe, added a can of diced tomatoes and a can of mild green chiles, along with some cumin and chili powder. I stuffed some cheddar in each burrito, and topped them with sour cream and salsa. Delish! It made eight medium burritos for our family.

I have used this recipe a number of times and always with great results. I make a couple of changes because of personal preference and add diced chicken breast. The changes I make are to use taco peppers that we grow in our garden instead of the jalepeno peppers because they are milder. I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil and often use dehydrated cilantro when I don't have fresh on hand. I have also used this as a filling for enchiladas. The enchiladas freeze well for an easy dinner later.

Really enjoyed these. I added a can of Rotel and corn, 1/2 tsp. each of cumin and chili powder. Then served with avocado slices, shredded cheese, and sour cream. I will be making often, next time I'll have to add shredded chicken or pork to entice my husband to try it!!

This recipe is very good.  Instead of jalapenos I use a can of green chills.  In addition, I also add a can of crushed pineapple.

Very tasty and healthy.  I did not have onion, so I had to use scallions, and I only had dried cilantro.  I used my banana peppers from our garden instead of jalapenos. I added Mexican chili powder to spice it up a bit more. I used more colored peppers than called for because we love peppers. Instead of white tortillas I used a high fiber/protein tortilla. The recipe made enough for seconds for all four of us.  Will be making these again.  Thanks.

This made a very yummy black bean and chicken burritto.   I doubled this recipe and did not add jalapenos, but added a bit of cumin and red pepper flakes.  I also added some chicken broth at the end because it seemed really thick.  CHICKEN...  I took 3-4 frozen chicken breasts and boiled them until cooked thru. Shredded  it and added about 1/2 cup of Pace Salsa a good squeeze of lime juice and lemon juice.  some dried celentro, a couple dashes of chili powder, and some cumin powder.  Made the burritos  with the beans, then chicken and some Colby Jack cheese all wrapped up!  Yum!

I think this recipe has EXCELLENT bones, but I made it as is (save for the jalapenos because there was someone eating who does not like any heat), and I have to say it was lacking. I didn't have tomatoes on hand, but that definitely would have given this dish more dimension. I would also probably have added a bit of cheese if i had any. I did end up adding some chili and garlic powders (about 1/2 tsp-1tsp of each) which helped in the way of spices. I also made some lime & cilantro rice to go with it which helped make this more filling and add another layer to it. Overall this is a great base, but it definitely needs to be built on to be perfect imo :)

These burritos were delicious! My kids and husband really enjoyed them.  I served them on whole wheat tortillas (not my first choice tortilla) but we are only eating whole wheat and whole grain carbs. We also used light Horizon organic cream cheese.  So good, it's a weekly meal from now on.

Followed other reviewer's advice and doubled the recipe, added a can of Rotel tomatoes, 8 oz cream cheese, 1/2 t cumin, and 1/2 t chili powder. These are delicious! Next time I will add lettuce and tomatoes to them just to give them a little something extra!

This was so good and so fast to make. Very healthy too. I added my regular mix of spices for mexican food: garlic and onion powder, cayenne pepper and cumin.  Instead of fresh jalapeno's, I added one of those small cans of them.
 
Tasted great. One of the quickest things I've cooked.

Delicious. I followed some of the other reviews and added a little cumin and cayenne to the recipe. When folding the burritos I threw in a little cheese, salsa and brown rice for filling. My family loved them. I'll definitely be making them again.

If you're looking for a super-easy dinner that's ready in minutes, this is a great option. I skipped the jalepeno and used adobo chilis instead - they turned out great. I made a double batch and don't think it will be around for long!

I sort of had to use what I had...No onions or cilantro so I imagine it is much better with those two things...I added black olives, tomato, and a little spinach/spring mix also.  I think my best modification was substituting goat cheese for the cream cheese.

This is a great base recipe, and can be easily tweaked to your liking. For example,   I added corn, cumin, and a tiny amount of garlic salt, and did not use cream cheese (not a fan).  It was pretty good, and I will be making this again.  Next time, I may even add chicken and/or rice for my husband.  By the way, this recipe made two regular sized burritos each for my husband and me.  So basically, four burritos. :)

This is very good and easy.  My kids love it.  I find it needs a little kick form cumin.  We also add topping to our burritos like salsa, sour cream etc.. and this makes them even better.

These were great. I used my mother in laws recpie for homemade black beans instead of canned. Instead of using oil i used butter, only because black beans taste so much better with butter.  I opted to leave out the cilantro because i have never liked it. Will make again. I do agree with another reviewer this would make a good dip.

These were good and all the boys liked them too.  I would just add at least a 1/4 tsp of cumin if not a pinch more.  I also made with reduce fat cream cheese. We will be making again.  Wonder how it would be with tortilla chips instead?

Good base recipe, would rate 3.5 stars. I subbed green pepper for the red, added an entire jalapeno (seeded) and 1 tsp minced garlic. Also added a can of petite cut canned tomatoes (drained) cause I like them. I omitted the salt (figured between the canned beans and tomatoes this would be enough. My only complaint is that following this recipe as is leaves a bit to be desired in the flavor dept. Upon tasting these I added the juice of half of a large lime, increases the cilantro by 2 tbsp, added hot smoked paprika, chili powder, black pepper and cumin. Finished off with some chopped green onions. Now this is delicious. I can't wait for lunch tomorrow to eat some more! Thanks for the recipe:)

This was really good.  If you want to make your mixture go farther, add a cup of cooked rice and double the cream cheese.  Add spicy salsa for some extra zip.

Excellent, hearty, delicious and inexpensive. Great meatless alternative. Made for my friends last night and everyone raved. Don't forget the cilantro (the first few of mine were naked!) Once the chopping is done, this is a quick meal (maybe chop ahead?) Remember that this recipe only serves 2 so I had to multiply by 4 for my group.

Really good!  This Burrito is very mild in taste, which was fine to my sensitive pregnancy palate.  I tweaked the recipe as well, added corn, cumin, brown rice and doubled the cream cheese.  I too baked mine with some cheddar cheese on top.  Very good.  I do look forward to trying with with taco sauce or salsa inside at some point.

This was super easy and really delicious.  We made it according to the recipe, but added more jalapeno for extra spice.  We also threw in some corn and used black beans that were already seasoned with cumin and chili spices.  It was way better than I expected it to be.  We will definitely be making these again!

YUM!!! Like others, I modified a bit for taste. I added: Penzey's Arizona Dreaming spice (like taco seasoning only better), cayenne, more garlic, and most importantly, LIME! The lime juice added to the bean mixture really enhanced all the flavors.  Before wrapping, I topped the filling with pepper jack cheese, fresh cilantro, fresh avocado, and sour cream. SIMPLY AMAZING!!! Oh, and I made this as healthy as possible, and it was still awesome: sauteed the veggies in coconut oil and used reduced-fat cheeses and sour cream. Not a bit of flavor was lost with the lower calories!

Very tasty vegetarian burritos! My carnivorous husband approved as well! We really enjoy cheese, so I added closer to 8oz of cream cheese (you just can't have too much!!!!) I usually spice it up a bit with some cayenne or chili powder as well (add to the onions/peppers while cooking).

This was so good! We recently started meatless mondays and were tired of eating pasta and salads. This was perfect. It was very quick and easy to make and we did not miss meat at all. I followed the recipe exactly and served it with spanish rice. Yum!

These are great- I have made them several times, and the ingredients are all things I keep on hand. I did change a few things, just because of my preference- I add more garlic, use Laughing Cow cheese to cut down on calories, and use whatever veggies I have on hand- tomatoes, different bell peppers, chiles, mushrooms- or frozen fajita veggies. Delicious, healthy, and budget friendly!

These were so good! I doubled the recipe so we'd have leftovers, and we ended up with enough for two burritos the next day. I followed the recipe exactly, but did add more cilantro. I will absolutely make these again, and any meal this good that goes from prep to plate in 20 minutes is a keeper!

These were super yummy! Added in more bell pepper and cilantro, and skipped the jalepeno pepper as I was feeding this to toddlers. Also added in one can of diced tomatoes with lime and green chilies. Broiled them in the oven for a few minutes to brown them up a bit and then added cheese and put them back in the oven until it was melted. Served with salsa and sour cream.

Delicious! I did add some cumin and chili powder though because we like our food with lots of spice. Even my husband liked it and he usually won't eat black beans. I will definitely make this again.

Very tasty pseudo-Mexican dish. If you pre-chop, it goes extremely quickly. Tip: the more cream cheese you use, the less healthy/more yummy it tastes :-)

I give this five starts because it is soooo simple to make, takes no time at all, and it is scrumdiddlyumptious. Ack, wait, I did make one change... green bell peppers instead of red (just a personal preference). This is sure to become a "go to" recipe in our home.

Very good!  Great wrapped in tin foil and stuck in the freezer for later consumption.  Nuke 1-2 minutes and you've got a filling meal/snack!

This is now a staple recipe in our home. Even my husband can make it and it is always delicious. We use a mixture of beans, usually three types and make a huge skillet at a time. We take it for lunches and have it for a snack. We have added Mexican corn to the mix, which is really good as well. Instead of the red pepper and jalepeno we drain a can of RoTel tomatoes and dump it in along with the beans.

I am unable to have dairy so I didn't put the cream cheese in. Instead, I added a little salsa to add some liquid and half an avocado for each burrito.. Also, I didn't have jalapenos so I added some chili flakes and cayenne. It was great! I will try it again using the exact recipe. My husband doesn't like black beans but he really loved this burrito.

Good, but not enough spice as written. I used low-fat cream cheese and whole wheat tortillas for a very filling, cheap, and healthy burrito. Will make again, but with more garlic & jalapeno, and add cumin and maybe more spices.

Very tasty and VERY easy. The only thing I changed was adding a handful of frozen corn when I was frying the onion and peppers. Great meatless Monday meal. Thanks!

These are awesome! I've been looking for a great black bean burrito recipe for ages. I took the advice of the reviewer who suggested adding a can of rotel and some cumin and cayenne. I easily got 4 good sized burritos out of this. Topped them with salsa-so good it doesn't even need cheese!

These were delicious!!!  I did add 3/4 cup corn & a can of well drained diced tomatoes with green chiles. Good recipe to have the kids help make... My son greatly dislikes both corn and tomatoes but he ate 2 of these... YUM!!!

Wonderful burritos. I took the suggestions of others nd used cumin and chili powder.  I will think about chicken next time.  My only qualm was that, for the amount of calories in the cream cheese I was hoping for something that packed just a tad more flavor to make me believe that the calories are worth it, not that this is just an occasional nummy treat

I really like this recipe.  I didn't have any cilantro, so maybe that's what was missing.  I also forgot the salt, so I guess mine didn't really have much seasoning.  I wish I'd thought to add cumin and salt and pepper! Still, it was quite delicious, and I added brown rice to the burrito....Wish I'd had some guacamole to dip it in!! Yum!

Even though this recipe looks good and the ratings look good, I was pretty skeptical of the "delicious" factore. The cream cheese and jalapeños just didn't seem like they'd appeal to me. I'm glad I tried it anyway! I made it as-is with probably just a little more garlic and jalapeños than the recipe called for. Absolutely delicious! It's also dirt cheap, HEALTHY and really filling. This will become a regular dish in our home.

These were GREAT! I doubled the recipe so that I could have some leftovers. SO much flavor in these, I was shocked! I used lowfat cream cheese and whole wheat tortillas and they were amazing for a 'healthy' meal! I think next time I will make them the day before and heat it up later, because the leftovers were better than the first meal. I think it gave the flavors some time to marinade. Will definitely be making this again!

this recipe I made yesterday the burrito was real good...I used olive oil instead of vegetable, 1/2 tsp of minced garlic, no jalapeno peppers, red onion, no salt, no cilantro because I had none.  I heated the fllour tortillas on a hot frying pan instead and the cream cheese I melted it for 30 seconds in the microwave and with a butter knife spread it evenly on the flour tortilla....I must say that this recipe was more flavorful today....this is a keeper.....

This has become a favorite dish of mine!  I love how quick and easy they are to make.  I used about 2 oz. of cream cheese instead of 3 oz.  I can't wait to try these again with avocado, as someone esle has mentioned.

Very quick and easy and my pescatarian daughter loved these, as did I.  The recipe made 3 nice size burritos.  Next time I would use less onion and garlic (I used 3 crushed cloves) and maybe add in some green chillies.  I added in some cut up avocado which went very well.  The fat content is a little higher than I liked, so might use less oil and low-fat cream cheese.

I normally wouldn't review a recipe unless I make it exactly as written the first time but I feel like I was close enough this time to rate it.  I really, really like the cream cheese in this.  I never would have though to do that on my own so for that alone this recipe was worth making for me!  I happened to have some leftover fajita chicken from a couple nights ago so I added that into the mix.  I realize this may have changed the flavors a little but I can pretty much say that with our without the seasoned chicken this has good flavor.  It's easy to make and quick which I really like and the filling will freeze well, I believe.  I will make this again I'm sure!

These were really good! I added a little bit of dry taco seasoning to the bean mixture and I used low fat cream cheese.

Great recipe! I will say that I made some changes, but stuck with the main idea.  I used a green bell pepper instead of red, green chilies instead of jalapeno, and used 1 1/2 wedges of garlic and herb Laughing Cow cheese in place of 1/3 of the cream cheese.  I also threw in some corn- and couldn't imagine these without it! Husband loved them.  This made enough filling for 5 burritos for us. A keeper for sure!

I have not tried this....... BUT, I chose to look at this because the ingredients are what appeal to me.  Those who rate the recipe even though they changed ALOT is BS.  Make the recipe as is, THEN and ONLY THEN are you able to make changes. COME ON that is not fair for the rest of us.  Actually, it may change if I even try a recipe or not.

Excellent!  I did add about 1tsp of taco seasoning, 1 can of Rotel, and traded the jalapeno's for a small can of green chillies.  As I was cooking I was feeling I needed to add meat to the dish, so quickly cooked up some chicken breast.  But the flavor was wonderful with or without the meat!  Next time I may just skip the meat!  I'll double the recipe next time so we'll have some leftover!  Fantastic, quick meal!  Thanks!

This is a family favorite.  My husband wants meat at every meal, but loves these.  I don't know if he even knows that they don't have meat in them.  They are delicious and filling!  The only change I make is that I add a can of Rotel after I saute the vegetables.  Thank you for sharing!

My husband and I LOVED these.  I had no garlic so I used quite a bit of garlic powder, had no jalapenos, and upped the cream cheese a bit.  I also added 1 can of corn and a generous helping of chili powder.  The end result was so gooey and delicious!!  We topped the mixture with sour cream and shredded taco cheese before rolling up.  One of the easiest things to throw together, and made about 3 LARGE burritos, using the large spinach/herb tortillas.  This recipe has made it to my list for dinner rotation!

Surprisingly good. I add some serranos or jalapeños to the mix and adjust the seasonings a bit, but this is a good recipe. You don't miss the meat at all, in fact meat ruins this dish for me.

Delicious. I added cumin and fajita seasoning to taste. Also, right at the end, I added one fresh diced tomato and juice from 1/2 lemon. We served with sour cream and salsa. My toddler, husband, and myself all loved this. A wonderful no-meat meal.

These were--Good! I did use Toffuti cream cheese instead of reg cream cheese. Just trying another way to cut down on fat! With other suggestions I added chili powder, and cumin to help flavor up the Toffuti. I will make these again maybe adding some more of the vegetables.

I'm no fan of burritos, and even I liked these- the black beans sealed the deal.  I made some modifications- I used olive oil and fire-roasted red pepper from a jar.  I didn't use japs, but I did add a can of rotel.  I also added some cumin and chili powder.  This was seriously tasty.  Everyone in my family loved them.

made them for a get together. Everyone enjoyed them.  I don't like jalapenos, left them out, those who liked them added them later. I used 1 onion, 1 red pepper, 1 yellow pepper & 3 cans of black beans and about 6 oz. cream cheese.  This made enough for 6 adults. yummy. thanks!

This was quick and easy to make! I thought this was very good and so did my brother. The only changes I made was Olive Oil instead of Vegetable Oil, Sea Salt instead of Reg. Salt and I used chopped frozen onion. I also used a non-stick pan instead of skillet. This was really good, the only change I would make in the future is to use a cheese topping. Very tasty though, Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy!  I put all the ingredients in my slow cooker with 1/2 jar of salsa, a frozen chicken breast and some rice and it was ready for me when I got home from work.  So easy and so delicious! :)

Very good! I've made this many times and its always a hit for the whole family.  I end up reducing the cream cheese a bit and adding more green and yellow pepper as well.  You need to use fresh cilantro or it just doesn't taste the same.

Very good! Added some corn and some taco seasoning and served over rice, as the tortillas made them a bit messy to eat. Served with D's Famous Salsa from this site.

Very easy and yummy. I added a small amount of cooked brown rice, and then used guacamole to hold the tortillas together. We made three burritos and probably have enough filling left to make three more. My three-yr-old liked it!

Wow!  Were these good and cheap and filling.  I will be making this one again and again.  The only change was I used a whole jalapeno.

This was a quick and easy meal. My kids love it. My wife had already decided to grill burgers so we did this for an appetizer. Was quick and easy. Had some of the black ban mixture lef topped my hambuger with it was awsome.

Great recipe - I never would have thought of the combination of foods!  Of course I made adjustments based on my own tastes/available ingredients....more onion, garlic, peppers, splace of cumin.   With light cream cheese pretty healthy too!

These are so yum!  It's funny, because I was thinking of making them this weekend, and was going to look for the recipe, and here it was on the Daily Dish! I use both a green & red bell pepper, fresh garlic, and those canned mild chopped chilies (husband can't eat jalapenos).  I found that no salt was needed, but a dash of salsa works wonders.

These are delicious!  I add cooked brown rice to the mixture before putting it in the wrap...it seems to give it a more 'full' texture.  We also add our favorite sauce, such as green sauce.

I loved this! I omitted the cream cheese because I wanted to make it vegan and I didn't have cilantro, but it was still absolutely delicious. I also used pickled jalepenos instead. I added accent and cayenne pepper and other powdered spices. The tortillas I used were low fat/calories and low carb. Sometimes I even add the Mexican Rice II recipe and corn to these burritos to make them more filling. Thanks for this amazing recipe!

These were good, but much better with some changes. I added a garlic clove to the cream cheese as well as a teaspoon of cumin and then layered on some drained canned corn, avocado slices and diced tomatoes - delish!

I did not expect to like it that much but did not know what else to have. I left out the Jalapino and cilantro because of my wife's preference but we both loved them. One receipe (15 oz can) filled the two tortillos so we used a knife and fork. Marge added sour cream to her's, I ate mine as is.   We both loved them. Thanks for something new and delicious for us.

Yumola! This is a great recipe! I did double it and it made five burritos for us. I did add about 2 tsp. of cumin. I do think that corn would add a nice touch next time. This is a keeper! Thanks for posting.

Super easy and very delicious. I think it was ready in under 15 minutes. I didn't have the jalapenos, but can't wait to try it again when I do. This will be a staple in our house - our 2 year old scarfed them!

my husband and I loved this recipe.  I did change a few things..added salt, juice of a lime, a can of mexican corn, and doubled the rest of the ingredients.  The leftovers I smashed and reheated the next day as dip for football watching...yummy.

Absolutely delicious and so easy! I had them ready in less than 15 minutes! I doubled the recipe and I skipped the jalapenos, salt (black beans have enough sodium as it is), and the cilantro since I'm not a fan and just added some taco seasoning and a little chili powder with the onions and peppers, it was what I had on hand and it tasted good too. Just for simplicity I added a whole 8oz package of cream cheese instead of 6oz and they came out great. Make sure you drain the beans very well, it helps make the mixture less liquidy and therefore eating them is easier and not as messy. I will definitely be adding these to my recipe box, yum!

After sitting in my recipe box for over a year, I finally made these!  I did two things different:  no cilantro (don't like it) and added just a little bit of cumin.  The mixture was thicker then I expected but tasted really good.  I will make these again and may add some chicken too.

Super good. I did make a few changes to accomodate what I had on hand, but this is a solid recipe. I didn't have any red peppers or jalapenos (my garden is not cooperating!), so I just threw in a small can of diced green chiles. Very, very good. Thank you!

Very tasty! I took some of the advice from others and added in a handful of leftover canned corn that I had lying in the fridge,along with some leftover rotel that I had in the freezer.  I'm not a vegetarian but did enjoy this dish, although I think in the future I may add some chicken to it, to have another form of protein in it.   I also threw some shredded cheese and a bit of sour cream onto the top of it before I rolled it up. All and all very tasty and I will be making it again!

Good but not fantastic.  They really need the cilantro or they won't have any flavor.  I think I'm going to add cumin to the leftovers and maybe some diced tomato to punch it up a bit.

AWESOME! I put frozen corn, tomato sauce, cayenne pepper, seasoning salt, and green/yellow peppers in mine and it turned out just right. Microwave the tortillas instead of baking them.

I made a triple recipe and customized it based on my tastes. Along with the base ingredients, I added about a cup and a half of cooked rice, a couple cups of salsa, and chili powder and cumin. Thinking that this was looking like a pretty healthy meal, I decided to omit the cream cheese and instead added just a little shredded cheddar to the whole wheat wraps I used.  I also was able to cut way down on the salt. A triple recipe prepared this way made enough to feed my neighborhood, but it turned out excellent.

Easy and delicious!  I sprinkled the mixture with a little cumin and chili powder.  Other than that I followed the recipe and I will definately be making them again!

I've made this recipe before but forgot how good it was. The cream cheese really makes the dish. Once you get everything prepped it takes almost no time to cook. My only change was adding 1/2 t. chipotle chili powder. Now it's creamy, spicy, and smoky--triple yum.

Very good and seems to be pretty versatile. I also added 3 cloves of garlic, 1/4 cup of sour cream, more Cilantro and used Tomato FlatOut bread.  My husband also put hot taco sauce over the top, which added another layer of flavor.  Great dish.

Liked this because it was so easy and tasted good.  Sauteed the onions a little longer than called for and then added in the other veggies.  Also, did not heat the tortillas first.  Instead, filled the burrito with completed filling, wrapped it all up, topped with some cheese and then popped it in the oven until the burrito had a little crisp and the cheese was melted.  Topped with salsa and served.  They were a hit!

Okay, first let me say I had a houseful of skeptics when I said I was making black bean burritos, but these magnificent gems quietly hushed my meat-eating men. I took "Tina's" advice and doubled the recipe and added a can of Rotel w/jalapenos and seasoned it up with cumin, chili powder, and mexican seasoning. I also made homemade Mexican Rice from this site, and added rice and mexican cheese to the burritos when I stuffed them. I took all the leftover rice and added to the bean mixture and used the next day as a dip. Fabulous!!!

This was delicious!  I used the lower fat cream cheese, and a little less of it, and I also omitted the cilantro, because my man doesn't like it.  (But I'm sure it would have been great with it, too)  I just gave it 4 stars because I think it would have been a little too cream-cheesey with the amount the recipe calls for.  Otherwise, really yummy, good use of black beans and relatively healthy.

I made mine with the Mission Spinach and Herb tortillas (the green ones) because I thought that photo by "DetectiveL" looked good.  At least for the brand I used, the tortillas were WRONG for the dish.  Gave a weird, identifiable as just the tortilla as the issue, flavor.  The filling was great.  I used some Anaheim chilies in addition to the minced jalepeno, but it still wasn't spicy, for reference.  Very tasty regardless.

I loved this recipe - though I used soaked black beans - instead of can, dashed a little extra seasoning on it and omitted the bell peppers since my family does not care for them. I served mine with cut up avocado for more tex-mex taste and ate leftovers for lunch for a week straight.  LOVED IT!!!!  Also - topped it with pepperjack cheese and it was SSOO DELISH!!

Need to add cumin.  Mild Rotel makes it too spicy for the kids.  Add tomatoes and green chilies.  Only half block of cream cheese.

Pretty good! The cream cheese is the secret to this one, and it makes the consistency just wonderful! I added fresh tomatoes and a bit of Mexican rice to this and it was superb.

this was great! I made it for my mom and I, we're vegetarians. you can definitely tweak it for your tastes. I left out jalapenos (we're wimps) and added some cheese. We topped with salsa, sour cream and avocado, yummy! I made a double batch and it was enough for 5 burritos, I'll be making it to take for lunches!

The bean burrito was amazing! I took the suggestions of some of the other reviewers and added 1/2 tsp of cumin, 1/2 tsp of chili powder, sliced olives,  doubled the cream cheese and added a can of diced tomatoes, then spooned the filling over avocado slices.

We thought these were delicious!  I did add a little cumin and red pepper (as well as cooked chicken for a DH who thinks that if there is no meat it is a side dish).  I had a leftover one cold for lunch and it was still great!

I wish I could rate this recipe higher! These were absolutely delicious, I had made these twice so far. I doubled the ingredients, I needed to make a lot. I used reduced fat cream cheese instead of regular, which didn't affect the dish at all. After I put the mix into the tortillas, I added some shredded reduced fat cheddar then rolled up. I served these with salsa and sour cream. I couldn't eat just one. I love these so much. Thank you for this delicious vegetarian recipe (:

I followed Tina's recommendations.  Yum!  Update: these can alternatively be made into enchiladas.  Instead of adding Rotel and cheddar to the filling (per reviewers), they can be topped with enchilada sauce and cheese and baked for 20 min.  Still awesome.

This recipe is really easy and delicious.  I substituted cream cheese for sour cream and light shredded cheese. This is one of my husbands favorite meals.  Would make an excellent dip as well.

This was fabulous.  Like some other reviewers, I used green chiles instead of jalapenos and added about a half-can of Rotel tomatoes to the filling mix.  I also added juice from half a lime.  I added Mexican rice and made some fresh pico de gallo with avocado to put on top.  I am not typically a good cook but am trying to learn...and I was AMAZED at how good these turned out.  In fact, I'm about to finish them off for dinner tonight!!  Yum!!

We had these this past week for the first time and they were excellent.  But I did change up the recipe quite a bit.  We cooked dried black beans (2 lbs - since we have a family of 6)  I then added 8 oz cream cheeze, and a can of rotel tomatoes along with our favorite spces - cumin, garlic, chili pepper, salt and pepper.  I blended this in the mixer and then made them into burritos.  My family absolutely loved these and we now have a new burrito recipe.

These were very tasty and so, so simple to make!  My husband and my 2 year old loved these.  I did add rice as another reviewer suggested to make 4 burritos, so they were a little smaller, but followed the bean filling recipe exactly as stated - it was yummy!  Quite delicious - thanks for the great recipe!

These were very good. I did change the recipe a little bit. I used green chilies instead of jalapenos because I can't handle the heat. I did add taco seasoning and salsa to the beans and used about half of the cream cheese called for. My kids really liked it and didn't even realize there was no meat in it. They said the meat was very good. Thanks for the recipe.

These were great and quick & easy to throw together.  I followed the recipe except for the cilantro because I didn't have any on hand.  We made 4 smaller ones because of the size wraps we had on hand.  Next time I might add more cream cheese :o).

I'm never sure if it's fair to rate a recipe I've altered, but it was very good with the addition of some salsa and grated pepperjack cheese.

These are delicious and best part, easy. I added 1/4 cup frozen white corn which added great crunch and a little sweetness. I used reduced fat cream cheese. We served some lime-grilled shrimp on the side with margaritas, of course! Will be making this again.

These were ok. I made them for lunch one day. I think next time I will add cumin and leave out the cream cheese.

Made these for lunch today. Was feeding two pregnant women and was secretely scared of getting eaten myself if they did not like them, but they both loved them! Added chili powder in with the veggies, 1/2 can corn with the beans and a little extra cream cheese in with the mixture. Then filled tortillas with bean mixture, spanish rice, sliced avacado and a couple spoons of salsa. Rolled them up and melted some chipoltle white chedder on top of them. Served them with mexican table cream and chipoltle-pineapple salsa to top with. Next time I might also try some rotel or tomatos, but I had two happy pregnant women I tell you what!

I did the changes that so many others did (by adding rotel, doubling the recipe, adding 8 oz of cream cheese and shreadded chicken) and it turned out delicious.  I was afraid I had made it to spicy, so I omited the cillantro.  It was to die for and so easy.  I will make this from now on.  Also, I found doubing the recipe, it made way more for than 4 servings.  Great leftover!

Really great!I think these burritos are even better the next day. I am a flight attendant and will whip up a batch of this filling, fill 4 torillas, roll them up, cut them in half, throw them in a baggie and take them with me on my trips and WOW! They are great because they are filling yet have a lot of protien with the beans and the cream cheese. They also make great lunches for school and after-school snacks as well. I stick to the recipe as written (well, OK, I probably add more cilantro than called for) and they are packed with flavor!

This is really good!  I added diced tomatoes and green chilis with the cilantro, as well as some ground red pepper and a little bit of garlic powder.  I melted some shredded 4 cheese blend cheese over the tops and drizzled with sweet chili sauce.  Yum!

We loved these!  Of course I didn't have all the ingredients so I used 2 T of mild Rotel instead of the jalepeno and I left out the salt and cilantro.  My 9 year old raved about them and requested them for dinner Sunday and asked me to make enough so that she can take them for lunch next week!  Now that is success!

I just made these for lunch today and can't say enough about how good they are!!!  I did as a couple of reviewers suggested and added a little cumin and chili powder (I don't measure, so can't say how much...) and upped the garlic a smidge.  I was worried that they would be boring without cheese, but I didn't miss it at all.    I did add a little avocado & brown rice as I had it in the fridge.    As others have said, this makes enough for 4 burritos of the size we normally make.  Just delicious! A new favorite!!! Thanks!

For lack of ingrediants I had to change things a little bit. I used chipotle chili powder instead of jalapenos, which I think just gave it a different flavour, not necessarily better or worse. I added a bit of shredded cheddar. My hubby liked them. I had extra filling so I spread it out on tortillas and made pinwheels the next day. (roll, slice, then bake at 375 C for 10 mins)

I make this a lot for a quick lunch. Most of the ingredients I get for cheap at Grocery Outlet and I usually have most of the ingredients in my pantry. The kids love it, too. I add a tbsp. or so of lime and sometimes shake a little Frank's on mine. Rich tasting and filling on the cheap. TIP: You can fill this out and make it stretch with shredded vegetables, like carrots, zucchini and more peppers.

I made these for dinner tonight and they were AMAZINGLY GOOD! I changed the recipie a bit by adding cumin and omitting the jalapenos of for hatch green chiles. I also omitted the cilantro since I don't like it. I added some shredded chicken into the mix and it was wonderful! I will definitely make these over and over again!

These were very good.  I doubled the recipe for us and the kids.  I used 1 can of black beans and one of pinto beans for a little variety.  I followed the recipe but something is missing.  I can't put my finger on it.  We ended up putting salsa on them.  I love pepper jack cheese so next time I'll use some of that for some of the cream cheese.  A very good meatless (inexpensive) dinner that I could usually whip up in an emergency.

Delicious.  I steamed my tortillas rather than putting them in the oven.  Also, I cooked the onions, peppers and garlic until they were tender.  I wasn't in a crunchy mood last night.  I would have liked more heat, but you could add more pepper if you desire.  I will make this again.

With additional spices (Adobo, extra jalapenos, cumin, hot sauce, and Mexican chili powder) and cheddar, these would be a five star. They would be a little bland without the extras in my humble opinion.

These are the best! I tripled the recipe but cut back a little on the onions and added a little more jalapeno peppers. I also added 2 cans of corn, 1 tablespoon each of cumin and chili powder. My son who hates black beans is devouring his as I write this! Next time I will cover in pepper jack cheese and bake them as another reviewer suggested. I had to add to my earlier review because this is my absolute favorite meal! I have made these several times, either as burritos or as quesadillas heated in a skillet or baked. This time I decided to make them "naked burrito style" with out the tortillas.(Like Qdoba) I layered a portion of Spanish rice in a bowl, topped that with some of the bean mixture, then added shredded Monterey Jack cheese, guacamole and sour cream. You can eat it with a spoon or scoop onto tortilla chips. I like to top it with Fritos and eat it with a spoon myself. I am going to try Cilantro Lime rice for the next batch. Since I don't add Cilantro to the bean mixture, this shouldn't be over powering. I also add a SMALL amount of water to the mixture to keep it from being too dry. I always make extra and freeze the leftovers too!

I was expecting much more based on the reviews, but this was good with several additions. I added in the can of Rotel, and also about 1/8 tsp of cumin and 1/8 red pepper. What really made it great was the addition, the next day, of some leftover marinated (shredded) chicken and some sour cream.

Very simple, yet very tasty recipe.  I did not look at the serving size before I made it.  Just know that if you are cooking for a family of 4 or more you may want to double or tripple it to have enough!

This was a good "base" recipe, but it's not perfect. I made the following changes: omitted cilantro (didn't have any on hand); added cumin, paprika, and chili pepper; added about 1/4 cup water at the end. 

Even with the water added in, it's a little thick for my taste. The taste was FANTASTIC, but the texture needed some work. When it was piping hot, it wasn't too thick, but by the time I finished my burrito it was a little cement-like. 

I'll make it again, but I'll tinker. I think if I had it to do over, I'd thin the cream cheese with milk before adding it to the bean mix.

Wow, these were AWESOME and soo easy too!! My kind of recipe! I doubled the recipe and used a whole jalepeno and almost an entire 8oz container of cream cheese. I also omitted the cilantro. I baked the tortillas in tinfoil as suggested however two of the tortillas got super crunchy and were hard to fold over after filling them. So be careful of that. But they did taste great crunchy. I put hot sauce & taco sauce and sprinkled a bit of shredded cheddar cheese on top of my burrito. So good! This will definetly become a staple in my meal ideas!

These were a little bland.  I would reccomend adding some seasoning and maybe a can of green chilies or at least serve with hot sauce.  I also think 2oz. of cream cheese would be plenty.  We got 6 burritos in 8in tortillas out of this recipe.

This was awesome. We added ground beef to make it more filling and then a little more cream cheese to make up for the extra ingredient. I have made this twice so far and hubby loves them!

I thought these burritos were wonderful and I can see myself craving them in the near future! 
I did make some changes to the recipe: I added corn, forgot to add the onion (didn't miss it either), used green pepper instead of red, and instead of jalapenos, used a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies (drained). I also added 1/2 tsp each of cumin and chili powder, though I don't know that it was necessary. And I used 8 oz. reduced fat cream cheese. 
I think these burritos are pretty versatile and you could put just about whatever you want in them. I would just point out though that these are not your average burritos and you need to really like cream cheese if you're going to make them!

Enjoy!

Loved this recipe! I didn't have all the ingredients on hand (no bell pepper or jalapenos), so I added a can of Ro-Tel as another reviewer suggested. I also jazzed it up a bit with 1/2 tsp of chili powder and 1/2 tsp cumin, and the burritos were absolutely delicious. Even my husband liked them, and he is not a fan of black beans. I think this recipe will go into my regular rotation.

I thought these were awesome with the couple of tiny changes/additions I made.  I went by the ingredients with the exception of adding a little over a teaspoon of kosher salt in place of the 1/2 tsp and I took the advice of many and I added a few good dashes of Chili Powder as well as a couple of shakes of Cumin. I can't stand the flavor of cream cheese, but have no problem with it if it's covered up with flavor so you can't taste it.  That was definitely the case with this recipe. I was concerned after reading other reviews mentioning that they just didn't see how cream cheese fit into the meal - but it was completely flavored by each of the other ingredients - especially with the addition of the spices. It also provided a perfectly creamy consistency for the dish. I will be making this often and freezing for my lunches. My 3 year old loved it, my 5 year old couldn't get past the "red things" and wouldn't eat it.  While I was inhaling mine, my husband asked if there was a rating below 1. I couldn't believe it! Please try this recipe and make any additions you feel are appropriate. This is a great meatless dinner, especially with some Spanish Rice on the side. Enjoy!

Fantastic! Thank you for submitting this! 
I made this for a crowd…and the crowd had rave reviews. I didn’t think that everyone would enjoy this, and figured some of the other more “common” dishes made would be more of a hit. 
I was wrong, even the meat loving men liked this veggie dish and so I will make it again for sure. 
I took suggestions from others and used 8oz of cream cheese, added diced tomatoes, and kicked up the spices. 
Delicious!!

I just made this recipe for the second time--delicious again!  This time I made some adjustments, calculated the weight watchers points, and froze a batch of 10 for lunches.  In this version, I made the following changes: I doubled the veggies (2 onions, 1 red pepper, a lot of cilantro), added a can of diced tomatoes with chiles, included 1- 19oz and 1- 15oz can of black beans, and 6 oz 1/3 less fat cream cheese--along with the other ingredients.  Scooped into 2 point tortillas, this recipe made 10 4-point burritos ready to freeze. Healthy and delicious!  UPDATE:  These defrosted great!!

i'd give these four stars based on how quick, easy and cheap they are (being a college student, these are my priorities!). but, without some modifications, these are definitely bland - and i like my mexican food very mild. i added in corn, 1 1/2 cups brown rice, cumin and chili powder. with the rice addition, it gave me enough for three burritos. served them up with lots of salsa on top. with these adjustments, they were delicious!

Delicious is right!  (And addicting)  I have made these a couple different ways but our favorite was when I skipped the  bell pepper, sauteed some mushrooms, threw in some diced tomatoes and added some leftover orzo or rice.  Definitely needed more cream cheese.  There was barely enough before all the additions... Sprinkled red pepper flakes and chopped cucumbers on each burrito before serving.  Excellent.

I doubled the recipe then added 1.5 tsp of Chili Pwdr., 1 tsp Cumin and a couple pinches of Chipotle.  I also added a chopped heirloom tomato and a couple handfuls of frozen corn.  I threw in the whole 8 oz. block of cream cheese too and topped it with some aged cheddar.  Yum and thumbs up from the whole family; Gramps, Hubby and Pre-schooler alike.
Thanks for all the tips!

Very good recipe!  I left out the jalepeno because my husbands a wimp.  And reduced the cilantro to my taste.  The first bite was an adventure as we both weren't sure what to expect.  Minutes later our plates were empty.

I can't rate the recipe as is, but with the changes I made it was a 5.  I omitted the red bell pepper, added cumin, and subbed sour cream for the cream cheese.  I served the burritos with shredded cheese and salsa.  They were easy, good, and very filling!  The next time I think I might add tomatoes with chilis and more spice.  Thanks for the great recipe!
Update: Last night I made these and included the tomatoes with chilis....wow!!  We loved them!  The extra layer of flavor made a big difference.  So easy and filling and good, will be a staple in house.  We  pair these with the beer margaritas also on this site.

I thought this was okay but nothing spectaculor.  I did leave out the jalapeno pepper because I don't like hot foods so that may be why I only rated this average.  I also didn't think the cream cheese added anything other than making the bean mixture an unappetizing gray color.  I doubt that I will make these again.

This is great! Easy, fast and really flexible recipe. As some reviewers found it a little bland, I added one fresh tomato and some "bean mix" spices I had, and they were really delicious. I also melted cheddar cheese over the top. They freeze well when wrapped in tin foil and make for good, quick lunches when needed! Thanks a lot -- great idea.

I agree with others on two things-  that sour cream should replace the cream cheese and that this recipe is a good start for something better.  I added a half can of corn to the mixture along with a little cheese. After assembling I baked for a few minutes with some shredded cheese on top.  After I garnished with sour cream and taco sauce.  It was good and very filling.  I would probably do again and perhaps add a little salsa or Rotel to the mix as well.

I thought the original recipe was a little dry and bland.  I added some diced tomatos, a little more shredded cheese, cumin, and extra garlic.  This is definately a good base recipe to work from.  I also pulsed some of the black beans in a food processor so they were not all whole.

My husband absolutely loved these so I had to give 5 stars - I quite liked them but would only have given a 4.  I followed the recipe except omitted the salt, used a whole red pepper, and added dash of cumin and cayenne.  There was enough filling for 4 burritos.  A bit too much cream cheese for me - I'll cut down next time.  But great recipe.

These were just okay.  I thought that they were rather bland and the there wasn't any sort of exciting texture to speak of.  They were a little better with lettuce and taco sauce.  If I made these again, I would definitely try adding some cayenne pepper.

It was tasty, but a little bit too rich/sweet for me.  My husband liked it better than I did, but I might make it again, just tweak the recipe a bit, add, or delete things.

these are quick, easy, and nutritious. i did omit the cream cheese and onion, and used a lot more jalepeno and added onion powder (onions make me sick, but i still like the flavor). i also added some ground cumin. next time i think some chopped tomatoes would add to the flavor too.

Did not seed jalapeno because we like the extra spice. My husband had his warm and I took them at room temperature for an appetizer. Delicious both ways and easy to make!

Great base recipe.  I added cumin and diced tomatoes, as others suggested, but will try adding a little hot sauce next time - it was a little bland for our taste.  We also added chicken as my husband isn't big on veggie-only meals - with this addition, we easily had three to four servings.  With the modifications, this one's definitely a keeper - even my toddler gobbled it up!

I really enjoyed this recipe! I used jasmine rice seasoned with fresh cilantro and garlic salt as a base layer before I spooned the burrito filler into the tortilla. Delicious! Making rice to go along with this will also get you four burritos instead of two. To spice up the rest of the mixture, I added some cumin, and a bit of chili powder, and a hefty amount of garlic salt. Another great thing about this recipe, (esp if you add rice and end up with twice the burritos) is that you end up with individual frozen meals, by wrapping them up in plastic wrap and throwing them in the freezer. Later, an instant portable meal!:)

Wow - these were delicious!  I admit I was skeptical when I saw that they contained cream cheese and cilantro (seems like an odd combo).  But my husband and I really enjoyed them.  They were also super easy to make.  The only thing I changed was I made it vegan and used soy cream cheese.  Thanks for this recipe! Yum!

I just finished eating these burritos. I've always loved black bean burritos, but making them usually involved dumping a can of black beans into a pan and heating them up. This recipe builds on that idea. I added cumin, chili powder, mild diced green chiles, and some diced tinned tomatoes with a bit of their juice. I omitted the onion and jalapeno, and topped the burritos with sour cream, cheddar, lettuce and salsa.I did use 2 ounces of cream cheese and I didn't feel it made it dry. This recipe is very versatile, but because of all the changes, I give it four stars.

I had made some homemade flour tortillas and was looking for a new recipe to serve them with and came across this one. Wow! it was great! Only I added a cup or so of shredded cooked chicken and a little bit of colby/jack cheese! This one is definately worth the stars!

I doubled the recipe and used fat free cream cheese, and substituted dried cilantro. To save time, I just warmed the tortillas in the microwave. I didn't have any jalepenos, but I would probably use anaheim peppers instead. To make up for it, I added quite a bit of cayenne pepper. Overall, this was a little onion heavy, but really easy and quite tasty. The cream cheese was a nice touch.

I just made these with the new Jalepeno Popper Cream Cheese by Philadelphia.  It gave this recipe just the kick it needed.  Excellent and easy meal.

I love these burritos. I spice them up a little bit, and since we are not vegetarians, I also like to ad some steak. It is great for a meal on the go.

Loved the flavors! Added corn, cumin, chili powder, salsa and doubled the batch. Very different, but very good. Served with mexican rice. Next time might add more jalapeno for more spiciness. Thanks for the recipe!!

Yum! Very easy and delicious. I first sauteed garlic and some cumin and chili powder in olive oil, and then added the black beans, salsa and the cream cheese. Wrapped it in warmed flour tortillas and added shredded cheddar and lettuce. My husband is quite the carnivore, yet he couldn't stop raving about it.

This was a good recipe but I would take other reader's comments and add some spices to the mixture.  I planned on doubling the recipe but was glad I didn't, because next time I would probably cut out the cream cheese altogether and just add cheese, sour cream and salsa afterwards like a regular burrito.  The cream cheese did dry them out.  But the flavor with the vegetables and cilantro was very good.

Very good! Easy to make and quite flavourful. My husband enjoyed these burritios, although next time I would add some cheddar. We ate them with sour cream as well.

Did not have all ingredients so I used this as a base and then added 1 lb deer burger browned which I seasoned with cumin and a little tex-mex seasoning. I substituted green chilies for the jalapenos, used shredded mexican cheese blend instead of cream cheese, and used dried cilantro as no fresh on hand. Had to omit red bell as I didn't have any. Served with black bean salsa and sour cream. My husband who wasn't hungry had seconds and my nine year old mexican food loving son requested I make them again. Thought I should have used a bit more seasoning to give more flavor. Will try again with correct ingredients but still a good base to use and build on.

Really good burritos!  I added rice and a can of corn, extra cilantro (what's a mexican dish without 'lots of cilantro), red onion and extra garlic.....which made them better fit our family!  Thanks for the recipe, we'll be having them often!!!

I made this recipe for my enchiladas.  I usually cook a mix of refried beans and seasoned beef to  stuff the tortillas, and then I bake them in the oven covered in canned enchilada sauce and shredded cheese.  My husband said "honey, your old enchiladas were good, but I want this to be your new recipe."  Needless to say these were a HUGE hit at my house!  A definate 5 star recipe.  Thank you!

I made this over the weekend, and it was delicious!!! 
I added 2 chopped jalapenos,and a little cajun seasoning to jazz it up a bit--topped with a bit of mexican hot sauce, because I love spicy food. 

 I also wrapped it in a whole wheat tortilla, to get an extra fiber boost.

I'll never buy another fast food bean burrito again!!

I loved these burritos!  I made them with green peppers instead of red peppers.  I didn't have cilantro or jalapenos, so I left them out, but it was still fabulous.  I made these and then put them in the freezer to take to work with me for my lunches.

We loved this recipe for its taste and how easy it is to make.  I made a rice dish to go with it and didn't realize how quick the enchilada mixture would come together, so my only suggestion is to chop all of your ingredients and wait until the last minute to cook them.  We'll be having these again!

These were delicious and so easy to make, it took no time at all and I was eating a wonderful meal. I didn't have cilantro on hand and didn't miss it too much but I will add it next time. I also used neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese to cut down on the fat. Next time I will add some green peppers as well to add a little something different.

Way too heavy.  The cream cheese was an interesting idea, but this might be better as a dip.  The addition of rice other people suggested might also help.  I topped these with a fresh salsa and some shredded cheese and then threw them in the oven to melt it all.  Made them prettier, but not light enough to really enjoy.
Decent flavor, though.

Great flavor. I thought I didn't have any red pepper so I put in green and yellow. Afterwards, I discovered the red pepper and added it as well. Reduced the recipe for two servings and ended up with three burritoes. Thought the color was fine. Put in the oven with monterrey jack cheese and topped with some sour cream. Also added cumin and cayenne as another reviewer suggested. I don't think this would be kid friendly.

Yummy and super easy to make with stuff usually on hand.  I used a can of "southwestern" black beans flavored with cumin and chili and just drained them.  They were nicely spicy and wonderful!

These burritos were amazing!  I loved the easy and fast preparation.  The only thing I added was a little ground cumin.  Next time, I'll also use reduced fat cream cheese; the other flavors in this dish are so great, you'll never be able to tell the difference.  These burritos will become a regular favorite in our house.

Great! Very easy to make and very tasty. I used one onion, chopped, one red bell pepper, chopped, one green bell pepper, chopped, and one jalepeno pepper, chopped. I also substituted a couple handfuls of colby jack cheese for the cream cheese. Topped with salsa, yum! I was also thinking of trying this with the jalepeno cream cheese from Brueggers (although it is kind of expensive).

Yum!!  That is all I can say.  Best if used as a dip for chips the next day.  My picky kids even loved it.  I WILL be using this again.

I really enjoyed these burritos because they are so easy and made from fresh ingredients. I put in too much jalepeno for my husband's taste, though. A little spicy! He suggested that next time we put some carne asada or chicken in them. Very good with sour cream, shredded cheddar cheese, and fresh salsa. More like a fajita than a burrito. Very good recipe!

I could almost become a vegetarian with great dishes like this one!  I doubled the recipe and served in 8" burritos, which made about 2 each for 4 people.  We also added sour cream and salsa.
Next time, I may take other reviewers' suggestions and add Mexican rice.  Would make a great dip with  tortilla chips.

I will make this again, with a couple changes. 
Though we followed the recipe our first try was, well, gummy. Very thick from all the cream cheese. Next time we'll use less cream cheese and the light variety. 
To thin it out a bit, we did add salsa, and it added a nice tomato flavor, a bit more heat and cut the heavy cheesiness.

I loved this. I did make changes.  
I added:
1 can tomatoes with green chiles,     1 small can diced green chiles,     1/2 tsp cumin,     1/2 tsp chili powder,      1/4 tsp oregano,     1/4 tsp smoked paprika,       and salt to taste.      

I cut the cream cheese to 2 oz and honestly, it was still more than I wanted (I don't need all those fat grams!). I'll cut back to 1 oz next time - it goes further than I thought when melted.

          This will definitely go into my rotation. YUM!

I doubled this recipe and also included a can of diced tomatoes per some other reviews. This was good, but not great. Can't beat the price though! I will probably make it again, but maybe just get creative with some toppings/sides.

These are wonderful. My family loved the pepper, onion, and bean filling. I didn't have any cream cheese so I used sour cream and it worked just as well, the sourness counteracted the spice (I ignored the recommended spices and kind of just added whatever I wanted from my spice rack). I will definitely be making these again ??

We really liked this and will make again but with some modifications.  We're not cilantro fans so we left that out, otherwise we followed the directions.  It seemed dry, so we poured on some leftover cheese dip and salsa when we put these together.  I will make these again but will take some other reviewers suggestions and add some cumin and a can of rotel tomatoes.  All in all, it's a keeper for meatless Mondays!

Delicious! My husband and I loved it. I made it exactly as posted. This will be our go-to recipe on a regular basis for years to come; thank you so much for sharing! It is a very simple recipe to make, and FULL of flavour! We added rice for the kids because their little taste buds couldn’t handle it. This significantly reduced the flavour for them. Perfect for a family of 4 with some leftovers!

I made this with a can of chicken breast, Rio Tel Diced Tomatoes and Green Chilis, as well as Bush's Black Bean Fiesta.  In addition, my family likes a lot of garlic powder.  I love herbs/spices so I added Italian Seasoning, Dill Weed, Cilantro, Chives, and Tumeric.  I have a bottle mixture of Smoked Paprika with garlic, chilis, and something else (can't remember it right now).  So all this had the nice spicy but not burn down your throat spicy.  I also already had Walmart's brand of  organic salsa which I just poured out of the bottle and fiesta five cheese and of course the black olives.  This will be a good meal for my elderly mother and I for now on.  It's also very easy to make and time saving when I get off work after working a 10 hour shift.  I had left over which I took for my lunch the next day.  Two co-workers really liked it and I told them about the recipe.  I sent pictures and texted the recipe to my sister who plans on making this as well.

This recipe has become a regular in our house. I don't follow the recipe exactly, using it as more of an outline, but it always turns out great.  I usually add roasted tomatoes, cumin, chili powder, corn & cheese (when assembling or melt on top) to the recipe, and swap out the jalapeño peppers with green chili peppers because 2 of my kids don't like spicy food.  For those of us who like things a bit more spicey, we add salsa.

I will be making these again. My husband loved them and said they were restaurant-quality. I didn't use cilantro and added Chile Arbol to make them spicy. Don't use too much Chile arbol.

Love this recipe! I make it without the jalapeños and the tortillas for myself and my 2 year old all the time for lunch. We just put it in a bowl and eat it with a spoon.

As written I give this recipe a 4, but with the addition of some of the reviewers suggestions I give it a 5. My husband and my two children loved it. I made as written with the addition of half a can of chopped tomatoes with green chilies including some of the juices.

This is a good starting point, however it is severely lacking in flavor.  I tried it with 2 full minced jalapenos and added in some taco seasoning which really made a difference.

The addition of cream cheese was a nice touch I had not thought of before. Per some other reviews, I added a can of (generic) Rotel, shredded carrots, and some frozen corn. This recipe made 4-5 burritos (enough for 4 people). I also only used about 2 oz of cream cheese. It added a really nice creamy touch and we did not need to use sour cream with the burritos. I served it with Spanish Brown Rice from this website. Very good and will make it again.

These are very good - especially if you want to forgo meat for a meal.  I doubled the black beans, red bell pepper, used partially yellow onion & partially green onions as I didnt have any jalapenos.  I also used 1 can green chilies ( enough heat) about  1-1/2 tsp cumin, and about the same in salt - should've cut back the salt a little more. Used 2 cloves garlic and each serving we lined with Mexican shredded cheeese & salsa before rolling.  Everyone liked them.  We used the soft taco size and each ate 2 - (4 of us)!!  Served with homemade coleslaw - it was a good meal  - definitely fix again.

It had a good flavor, but came out really gummy.  I ended up adding diced tomatoes and sour cream when compiling the burrito then they were excellent.

I may be one of the few that followed the recipe exactly, so you may find this review helpful!! I thought it was amazing just the way it is! So, so, so simple ( made it with a cranky baby on my hip) and very fast! I added a few tomatoes as a topping along with the suggested cilantro and it was perfect. I will be making this again Very soon!!!

I made this recipe "almost" as stated. I did not have green chiles on hand so I used  cayenne pepper. I also added cumin and mushrooms to the  pan with the green peppers, onion, and  black beans. This made 4 servings for me so it was my lunch the next day. It was very good, even reheated. I would definitely make it again.

The Irish chef strikes again. Found these very bland and I never know how much extra seasoning to add.. We call them Irish burritos, affectionately.

I substituted green peppers for the jalapeño peppers as my wife thought that they would be too hot.  Once plated I topped with sour cream and homemade salsa. Will definitely make these again.

Quite good. Didn't have the red bell pepper and never use cilantro. Omitted the salt.  Added some cumin and chili powder and chunky salsa to the mix. Sprinkled some shredded cheese on before rolling up. Easy to adjust to tastes and super quick.

I don’t like cilantro so I left it out. I also didn’t have any jalapeño so I added some additional spices of my own. Personally it made enough for 2 adult servings and 2 kids servings for us. It was delicious and even my 2 year old loved it.

I didn't  add fresh garlic. I added  1 Tbsp Garlic Powder, 1 Tbsp Chili Powder, 2 Tsp Nutmeg, 1 Tsp Cajun Seasoning, 1 jalepeno pepper, 1 red bell pepper, little more than 1 onion, 1lb. Ground beef, 3 cans of black beans. I put a 1/2 cup of mixture in tortilla sprinkled with fresh cilantro and rolled it up. 
Use half the amount of cream cheese, use Mexican/Cheddar Cheese. Add salsa. I adjusted recipe for 5 servings put 1/2 cup in tortilla made 10 burritos.

These are delicious. Lately when I make them I include a bit of Monterrey Jack cheese in the filling, pour some enchilada sauce on top, then pop them in the oven for 15 minutes or so till everything is all warm and melty, but they are wonderful either way.

Good basic recipe.  Added cumin, chili powder, and a cup of corn (from frozen).  Baked them at 400F for 12 minutes to crisp.  Have made before and will make again!

These were alright but I found it lacking in flavor.  I will add some spices next time!  But they do the trick for a quick weeknight dinner.

These were really good!!  We did decide to add a can of tomatoes and green chilis, about 3 tsp. minced garlic, 1/4. tsp cumin, about 5 oz. cream cheese, and some corn.  I used shredded cheddar cheese in mine but my daughter did not and she still loved it.  We'll definitely make these again.  Thank you!

Substituted an avocado, silken tofu and a little lemon for the cream cheese to make it vegan. Used a habanero instead of jalapenos. Tasty! The first time I warmed the tortillas at 350, but they got too dry. 170 worked better.

Omg! These were awesome! I did add a green bell pepper and a small can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos. Sometimes I add shredded cabbage as well.

I never met a recipe that I didn't modify - I used black beans and pinto beans and added about 1/2 cup of pico de gallo to the mixture.  I also added taco seasoning and cilantro. I more than doubled this recipe and made 8 burritos - added shredded cheese, more pico on top, and black olives w/chopped green onion and baked until cheese was melted.  Overall a good recipe, but will spice up in the future to my tastes.

Pretty good. I used significantly more Jalapenos, and substituted parsley for cilantro because cilantro tastes like soap.  Could use some more spice, but all in all a good meal considering the extremely short prep time.

Great taste but I made some changes and also doubled the recipe. After the sauce, I added a can of diced tomatoes with liquid, 1/3 cup broth, 1 bag of crumbles, cumin, and a cup of corn. After they were cooked for four minutes I added 3 cans of drained black beans along with 6 ounces of cream cheese and cooked another 3 minutes. Adding the beans last prevented them from getting "mushy" as other reviewers complained.

This was so easy to make! I didn’t add the jalepenos too spicy for me. I did add shredded cheese in the middle before rolling up. I will be making this recipe over and over. Delicious ??

This is delicious and suuuuper easy and quick!! Added some cumin to the mix. Also I didn’t have cream cheese, so I used sour cream. Heated my tortillas in the microwave, layered some cheese on it and placed the black bean mixture over it. Was super tasty! Can’t even imagine how nice it is with cream cheese! Defn going to try that soon.

Doubled recipe. Jalapeño a must (no one in family noticed them in it), added about 1/3 c salsa to mixture as all I had. Tasted it when done and just a touch bland so added 2 t cumin and 1 t chili pepper (cause I doubled recipe). I did not have fresh cilantro so used dry. Might not have needed the cumin and chili pepper had I had it. But the extra spices did not hurt it.  We loved them. U can vary recipe with adding fresh avocado. Salsa, sour cream. Thanks for a great base. Made ahead and just heated to add in the wraps. And yes u can just use this as a dip. Fast, easy and good. Had a surprise guest for dinner so glad I had doubled recipe- she gave it two thumbs up

This was delicious and I think it would also be good just as a dip. I didn't have a bell pepper, so I used some mini sweet peppers I had. I also didn't have any jalapenos, but I used beans that I had previously made from dried beans and that had Rotel diced tomatoes with green chilies in it and I also added some Pace Medium Chunky Salsa and some Frank's Hot Sauce. I also used my favorite flour tortillas which are the Ole whole wheat flour tortillas that do not contain any hydrogenated oils and have 5 grams net carbs.

Added ground beef and chili powder then sprinkled some paprika while cooking the rest. Subbed mushrooms for some of the pepper.  Used a wrap instead of tortilla and didn’t notice any difference.  Very good! Appreciate the basic recipe.

Yes, I made this for supper tonight and it made for tasty meal. I mostly followed the recipe but omitted the jalapeno and cheese. I made spicy Spanish Rice served either in or beside the burritos which made a really good combo. Topped each one with a medium salsa. Certainly will make again.

Everyone loved it and I will definitely make this again.  We used whole wheat tortillas and added 1/4 cup of chia seeds for extra fiber and protein.

This a great recipe for our family. I have made it several
times. I usually have the ingredients on hand and it's easy and quick to put together. Not to mention very tasty.

I kind of wish that I'd doubled the recipe so that we could have had leftovers. These were quick and yummy. I subbed in Adobo seasoning for the salt and also added some cumin. Served topped with shredded pepper jack and with Spanish rice on the side.

These were delicious.  Super easy, filling & very tasty.  Added 1 tsp. cumin, added the diced fire roasted chilies, (as seen in video) extra cream cheese & they were so good.  Also, I used the black beans from Safeway that are seasoned with garlic, onion, & spices.  They are Safeway brand.  We use all the time.  They are delicious!  As a side note.  I did not drain or rinse the beans; obviously.  You wouldn't want to do that with all the good spices in the black beans.  Mixture was not mushy @ all.

I wanted everyone to love these but they were ok. I create something similar already just without the cream cheese. My son suggested I mix sour cream in with this as well, I was considering cheddar and jack.

These were very good! I made some small additions. I doubled the recipe and I added about half a cup of corn to the peppers and onions. I also added 1 tsp of cumin. My kids and husband loved it. I had left-over filling and saved it for lunch the next day. I served this with some spanish rice on the side.

These were excellent because of how easy they are to make. Since other people complained of dryness, I just picked up a jar of salsa and added that on top of the filling in the burrito. I also added some cooked chicken for the meat eaters! YUM!

Mwah. Just ok.  Would not make it again. For years i have made a similar recipe that i prefer. I put the cream cheese on the tortilla instead of in the mix cilantro also if desired but the real taste difference is i add nice sized chunk of butter to the beans near the end of cooking. It makes all the difference to make the beans taste delicious. Also sometimes i use peperonatas instead of jalapenos or nothing at all for a change.

Just made it but as an enchilada. I followed what other people said by adding 1 tsp. of cumin, salt, chili then added corn while using the whole red pepper. I topped it with sauce then a Kraft southwestern cheese blend. Turned out wonderful. My hubbie liked it too. :-)

It tastes really good but some chopped up juicy tomatoes would've been nice to put in it or maybe some more capsicum. I like spicy foods in general so I added about a tablespoon of chilli powder but I couldn't really taste it so I'll add more next time.

Very good as is or with a can of Rotel tomatoes added to it.   I have also added left over white rice with good results. This makes  4 big or 6 good sized burritos with the additions. Spice it up or down depending on how you like it.

Big, BIG hit with my very picky family.  My husband was open to trying it but he asked that chicken or some other protein be added, so I added diced chicken with lime juice. It was delicious.  Creamy, with a kick. Highly recommend this one and will be making it again for myself without the chicken. Really satisfying.

Great to make during the summer when you don't want to turn the oven on. I played with the recipe a bit but I think it would still be great without my additions.  I steamed the tortillas in their bag in the microwave to heat and soften. I added frozen corn, a can of Ro-tel tomatoes, half an Anaheim pepper (no jalapena) and some left over prime rib cut into small pieces. I substitued Mexican sour ceam (over half a cup) for the cream cheese.  It made 10 burritos. Everyone loved them, even the one year old.

I always have leftover cream cheese that I stick into the freezer before it molds.  This was a perfect way to use it up!  I didn't have cilantro on hand, but these were still delicious without it.

Tasty and easy, add salsa verde and sour cream on top. For personal reasons, I would cut down on the black beans, add alittle meat, maybe.

Everyone in the family loved it.   Added some chili powder and cumin.  I suggest doubling or tripling the recipe.

Love this.... I do add one pound of hamburger and double veggies and cream cheese for  a larger portion. But this is a favorite in our home!

Pretty good but not enough seasoning or spice for me. Tasted as I went and added cayenne peppers, jalapeno and habanero that I grew. Also black beans, kidney and refried beans along with paprika, garlic powder and don't know how you can have burritos with out cumin and chili powder.  Then it was pretty awesome.

Oh. My. Gosh.  This is soooo good and easy to make.  The creaminess of the cream cheese in combination with the other ingredients, made this burrito recipe jump out at me from other burrito recipes.  Ease.  Convenience. Taste.  Loved it!!!

This was very delicious! I did use an entire jalapeno (without the seeds) when I made the recipe. It was very flavorful and a huge hit around my house.

Really enjoyed this meal.  Will make again. Wanted to go meatless for once. Hard to do for good old fashioned farm folks  like us.  Added my own touch with farm fresh corn we put away this summer, grated chipotle colby and a little taco sauce.  Really liked the results. Just don't heat the tortillas more than 10 mins and wrap well.  I used the crunchy tortilla and made a "taco type salad"  YUM !

I make these all the time. Best part is you can change it up based on what you have in the fridge. As long as you stick with black beans and the cream cheese everything else is just added deliciousness.

Absolutely loved these! I followed the recipe the first few times, but now I kind of  do my own thing with amounts and ingredients. I add green pepper and don't use cilantro (mainly because I never have it on hand). I make enough for my family to eat as well as for leftovers. It makes a great dip with tortilla chips, too! Definitely on my top 10 list!

AWESOME!!!! Did make a few changes. Used 2 cans of beans and 1 (8oz) cream cheese.  Added 2 cans drained Rotel. Put  a little enchilada sauce  (from 28oz can) on bottom of dish, filled  flour tortillas with mix (made 10 and had left over mix), added some Mexican shredded cheese on top then placed on top of sauce. Poured remaining sauce on top and sprinkled more cheese. Put in oven to warm and melt cheese.  Served with shredded lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream and Mexican Rice. My husband who is Hispanic Loved it!

I have made this dish for my family many times because I have a vegetarian child.  I took the suggestions from other reviewers and usually double the recipe and use 8 oz cream cheese, 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp chili powder, 3/4 cup corn, and 1 can Rotel diced tomatoes with chiles.  I omit the jalapeños for my child that cannot stand too much spice.  Can be eaten with the tortilla or over rice.

Reviewing for a record since we can no longer make notes. Everyone liked a lot. Doubled recipe, used mild chilis instead of jalapenos, no bell pepper, added corn and cumin. Use microwave to heat tortillas, dried out too fast in the oven even after only 10 minutes wrapped in foil.

I followed the suggestion to add cumin and I wish I hadn't - it was also a little salty for my liking.  Next time , I will add strained diced tomatoes and reduce the amount of cream cheese slightly.

This is my favorite recipe on this whole site. I make these all the time. I also make rice so I can get double the burritos out of this and freeze them, so I can take them to work and just toss them in the microwave. This filling is also great on chips for nachos.

2016.11.23 - With almost no modifications, this is rather disappointing.  I didn't have cilantro, and the jalapeños were from a can, but those were the only changes.  We topped it with a little fresh chopped tomato and some grated pepperjack.  DBF and I liked this at first, but the more we ate the more it tasted too heavy.  The cream cheese is just too rich.  DBF and I agree that this would be a good taco dip base with LOTS of fresh lettuce, tomato, and other veggies.  Maybe just making this with beans, cream cheese, garlic, and jalapeño would work if you took half the normal portion and topped it with raw onion, raw red bell pepper, cilantro, tomato, lettuce, and cheddar.  Following the reviews and adding frozen corn and Rotel would probably have helped, but these burritos would still need raw veggies on top.

Very good. Easy to make using mostly fresh ingredients. I do use only a small amount of jalapeño so the kids will eat it.

I only gave these a 3 star because, as written, they are a bit bland. I always follow the recommendations by Tina and I absolutely love them this way. These are a great, flavorful, inexpensive option for dinner. I also love to make it as a dip and rather than put it in a tortilla, just eat it with chips. Great for that football game food!

This recipe is so fast and easy to prepare.  It's a great weeknight meal. As well as the red pepper, I also added a bit of yellow and orange.  I sometimes toss in brown or wild rice and then added shredded lettuce and taco sauce when wrapping them up!

This was really good! But I added chili powder, and way more garlic and jalapeños. Added fresh pico to my serving as a finishing touch.

These burritos were amazing! The recipe is quick and easy to make; the perfect combo after a day at class or work. The only change we made was adding a drained can of chicken to the pan in the last few minutes just to heat up since it is already cooked. We will DEFINITELY be making these again!

I didn't think it was anything special at all - tons of different, more flavorful, and interesting burrito recipes out there.  It wasn't bad, but I wouldn't make it again.  If you typically like pretty plain and simple food, you may like it.

A great veggie-full recipe which doesn't require too many ingredients and can be whipped up in a snap. I added cumin and half a can of jalapeños. I love black beans and the cream cheese was perfect with this. It didn't even need sour cream.

These were some delicious burritos!  This is a great base recipe for a vegetarian meal.  I did add in about 1 tsp. of chili powder and 1/2 tsp. of cumin while sauteing, to give it a little more of a taco flavor.  I also had about 1/2 lb. of ground turkey that I needed to use up, so I browned that in the pan with all the veggies as well.  It would of been completely yummy without the meat, I just needed to use it up and thought it would go well in this and it did.  I did make some mexican style rice on the side with tomatoes.  If the rice I made didn't have tomatoes, then I would of added a can of rotel into the bean mixture as well.  For burritos I like to layer my tortillas with the following, a layer of refried beans, mexican rice, shredded cheddar cheese, and the black bean mixture.  I top with sour cream and salsa.  This made enough for 5 large burritos for us and was an excellent meal!  I will make again.  Thank you for the recipe!

These were amazing! I made them exactly as the recipe said, and they turned out really well. They did, however, make more than 2x  what the recipe said they would. 
I think next time we'll add some rice with the tacos, maybe some fire roasted diced tomatoes, since they're a family favorite, and some cheese. It also could have used a bit more salt, but it isn't a big thing. 
I will definitely make these again, thanks for the recipe!

I made the recipe exactly as stated and it tasted amazing! I wound up serving these as soft tacos rather than burritos. My husband loved them! This is a great vegetarian recipe that tastes good!

Delicious!! Didn't have a bell pepper, so used extra onion. Had this in a wrap with salsa, plain Greek yogurt, and baby greens.

Best bean burritos ever! They also make great empanada filling. I typically double the recipe so that I can use a whole brick of cream cheese, a whole jalapeño, a whole medium onion, and a whole red bell pepper. You don't need any further spices beyond the salt. You owe it to yourself to try these!

Overly salty and just couldn't stomach more than a few bites. Texture of the thing was just weird also and felt like something was missing. Will not be making these again.

I just made these,  and they are delicious!!! I didn't have  garlic, so I added garlic powder while the onions and red peppers were cooking, and I added a dash of Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning. I also added a can of diced tomatoes and chilies, like one reviewer suggested. It made the filling very spicy. If you don't want it spicy, then leave out the can of tomatoes and chilies. I sprinkled shredded cheese and salsa on top. 

Very, very good. I'll definitely make this again.

The beans had absolutely no flavor and the filling was so soupy it dripped out.   I would try it again,  however I'd add seasoning and just a dab of cream cheese.

I had to change it a bit based on what I had on hand. It just goes to show it's versatile. I used roasted red peppers, green onions, a lot more (pickled) jalapeños, added corn and used cheddar jack cheese. I also made it into a quesadilla on my George Foreman. Delish!

I am giving this review 4 stars because I made some changes to the recipe.
I added shredded chicken, green chilis and petite diced tomatoes. The flavors went with the rest of the recipe very well and added  enough extra ingredients to make the recipe yield 4-6 burritos using burrito size tortillas. Due to the increase in ingredients I used 4 oz of cream cheese instead of 3. This is one of my favorite mexican recipes.

I added a can of Rotel as others have suggested an it was fantastic! The mixture would have been very thick without it. I also mixed mine with rice before rolling up into tortillas and the dish turned out fantastic. I would suggest if you do not like your filling extremely rich to cut back on the cream cheese - I used about half of what is called for here and it was plenty creamy.

I hate to make any recipe (especially the first time) and make any changes to it. The only thing I did was triple the recipe, as my future inlaws were in town from Florida and were coming for dinner. I chose this recipe, on a whim, as I had never made this particular one before. Just trusted the rave reviews. Well, this was not my absolute favorite that I have ever made from this site, but everyone else (with exception of my daughter) LOVED these.  My future father in law RAVED and RAVED about them. He was even talking about them HOURS later. I did dice up some jalapenos to have on the side if anyone wanted them.  These were really good, like I said, maybe not my favorite, but I will absolutely make again! Thanks for sharing. It was a huge hit in my house!

I definitely loved this recipe. I'm giving it a 4/5 star review because of all the ingredients I added based on what other commenters suggested. With the addition of all the suggested ingredients, it was a solid 5/5 recipe. I think it would have been a little bland without them.

What a simple and delicious supper. Like others, I added in a diced tomato, a small diced zucchini, and a can of corn. To ramp up the flavor, I added 1 tsp. each of cumin and chili powder. Served it with soft white cheese for dipping. Yum!

This recipe is simple and delicious. I agree with other reviewers that there is too much filling for just two burritos. I used green bell peppers (that's what I had on hand). I add advacado and it is just perfect. I have even had these as tacos with soft corn tortillas . Yummy!

This was really yummy! Before I put it bean spread on the tortillas, I put some Spinach and tomatoes.

Loved it! I left out the cilantro and added some homemade taco seasoning.  They tasted perfect with a little salsa and shredded cheese.  Super filling too.

I have made this a few times. The first time I made it as written, except for adding cumin, which I always use in anything Southwestern or Mexican.  Now when I make it, I use a can of green chiles instead of the jalapenos (easy to keep on hand, like the flavor they add) I usually don't add the red bell pepper, and after I roll them up, I sprinkle some shredded cheese on top before popping them in the oven.  Oh, and I almost forgot the biggest change I made after the first time trying it--I add some shredded chicken, because my husband is not a fan of meatless meals.  But it is very good as written, too.  Just a really versatile recipe you can adjust to suit your family.

These are a hit in my house! I use frozen fajita style peppers. It saves time and they cook up a little softer than fresh peppers. Also, I like to roll the burritos like enchiladas, place them in a casserole dish, sprinkle them with cheddar cheese and a drizzle of salsa, and bake for about 10 minutes, until the cheese is melted and the tops of the tortillas have just started to crisp. They are best served with salsa. Adds a good and necessary kick. This recipe is in our regular rotation. We love it!

Delicious!  I cut the fat down by using pan spray instead of oil as well as reduced fat cream cheese and it was still very flavorful.  I added in some chicken shredded from a left over rotisserie chicken, rolled the burritos and baked them on 350 for a few minutes to make the tortillas a little crispy.  Perfect.  Everyone LOVED them and gobbled them all down.  No leftovers.  Will definitely be making this again!

Has a great flavor - even my meat loving husband thinks they're great. I did add rice to them to make them a bit easier to put together, but that's all I changed.

Just getting into eating less meat and this recipe was a hit. super quick and easy to make. my only suggestion is to add rice to the filling. I made black rice with cumin but im sure any rice would work. the flavor lends better to mexican ingredients though. my three year-old loved it.

Followed this recipe and it turned out so great. We all loved it.  Didn't hear a word about 'something being wrong' with this dinner, and trust me when your trying to feed children all between the ages of three and twenty four....it is hard to find something that makes everyone happy.  I loved the peaceful dinner and I will make this again and again. Thank you!!

Great taste and easy, easy weeknight dinner. We love the left overs, too. I add Rotel (original) and a small can of green chiles in lieu of jalapeños.  Definitely part of our rotation now- I've made this three times in three weeks!!!

I made the recipe as written.  We enjoyed them, but agreed they weren't good enough to cook again.  It had a little too much onion for my taste.  I agree with some of the other reviews in that it needed more flavor - maybe cumin, salsa, or cheese.  It was a quick and easy meal to cook which was nice.  My fiance and I had a small portion left over so we put it in an egg burrito the next morning.

Me and my dad liked these quite a bit but we're going to make some changes next time I found out I don't like cilantro and neither does he so we're leaving that out next time adding more jalapeños and cooking the beans a little longer.

A good solid, quick, vegetarian dish. Since we have a vegetarian and I try to make things that we can all eat without having to make an altered dish this was a good alternative. Likely would make again. Not the best burrito I have ever eaten, but pretty good.

Just whipped this up tonight for dinner.  Super easy and super tasty.  I made it into 4 6" tortillas and they were very filling.  Next time, I'm going to add a bit more cream cheese to make it a bit soupier.  It seems slightly dry, but that's an easy fix!  Absolutely putting this in the keepers pile.  Thanks!

I had everything on hand except jalapenos, but they were still great without. I did add cumin, chili powder, and a bit of cayenne. Also added sour cream to the burrito when I put it all together. Will make again and again!

These were really good but added lime juice over the mixture while cooking.  Added five cheese over the mixture after it was in the wrap and then over the top of the wrap used salsa verde....lots of flavor!

I made this but I did not have cream cheese. So instead I added shredded Mexican Blend. It was a little dry but still very tasty. I also added Chicken cooked with taco seasoning. Next time I will add a can of diced chilies.  I've eaten two days in a row so far. This one is a keeper! Thank you.

I made this according to our preferences, left out the jalapeno and the cilantro, but used it as a filling for quesadillas, added shredded  Mexican blend cheese Served with sour cream and salsa on the side. They were amazing. We warmed the leftovers and had  in soft Tacos the next day as well.  I agree with others, the combo of  cream cheese, black beans & corn is terrific. Will make this again and  again.  Thanks for posting, and thanks to the reviewers too.

Good vegetarian option for a burrito.  This recipe actually made 4 large burritos for me, and I used it as a breakfast burrito the next day by adding scrambled eggs to it.  I cut back on the onions and eliminated cilantro since I am one of those weird people who just don't like it and it still came out well. I like how it is versatile and really is a good base to add whatever you like to it whether it is a meat protein or more vegetables.  Next time I may try adding corn to give a hit of sweetness but really this is perfect just as it is for a quick lunch or dinner.

Easy and tasty.  Doubled recipe and added 1 tsp each of cumin and chili powder.  Can't imagine making Mexican without those spices.  Used can of green chili's in place of jalepeno and 3 cloves of garlic.  Added some already cooked frozen chicken to a few of the burritos and about 1 T of shredded cheddar.  Made 5 burritos. Only kept tortillas in over abut 7 minutes so they wouldn't dry out.

I loved this, even though I made a few changes. It's a great base recipe for making these burritos.

I doubled the recipe, added 8 oz. cream cheese, 3/4 t cumin, 3/4 t chili powder, hot sauce, and parsley.  Then I turned it into a casserole by layering cut up corn tortillas and the bean mixture, and topping with grated cheese.  YUM!  Gave it 4 stars vs. 5 due to my prceived need to spice it up a bit.

Simple to make and tastes good. I did add Spanish rice to the burrito because it seemed to need something more than beans.  That and a bunch of hot sauce and my burritos were delicious and made 4 instead of just 2.  This will definitely be a go to for me in a pinch.

I followed the recipe in the video (cumin and can of fire roasted diced green chilis).  However, I put in a whole green chili pepper instead of a t, but it was not too spicy.  There is something about black beans that neutralize the capsaicin.

As is this is only a 3.  We took others suggestion and added corn, cumin & some chili powder.  We didn't have any jalapeno peppers so used pepper jack cheese instead & used 3 oz to replace the amount of cream cheese.  We really liked the idea of a burrito without meat, but next time will do even a little different as it just wasn't moist enough this way.  We'll try some hot sauce & the cream cheese since we didn't think the pepper jack cheese was enough.  I think we'll have to grow some jalapeno's next summer.  We also fry our burritos out of preference.  I do that to all burritos so you have a nice crispy crust with the flour tortillas.

I thought these were amazing and tasted like restaurant quality bean burritos. The cream cheese is such a great addition. My husband, however, didn't think they were anything special.

These are amazing.  I added some cumin for flavor b/c I didn't see how they would have any taste without seasoning.  But they were absolutely delicious either way.  The cream cheese melts into the rest of the filling.  I used whole wheat tortillas and they went well together.

I cooked a 1lb bag of black beans, drained and added to recipe ingredients.  I did add can drained, chopped tomatoes, lots of cumin & chili powder, extra jalapeño, more onion etc.   Served over a bed of lettuce to cut carbs and everyone loved it.

Really easy and yummy. I added a carrot instead of the bell pepper and also added frozen corn and some smoked paprika. Next time, I'd do 2 onions and maybe a little more corn.

These burritos were awesome! I did not use cream cheese, and instead used cheddar cheese. I also added 1 tsp of cumin and put a full jalapeno in there since my husband and I like our food spicy. I forgot to put in the can of tomatoes & the can of green chiles (from one of the other reviews); next time I make it I will add those and I'm sure it will be even more awesome! Made enough for 3 burritos. Delicious!

Made this recipe to thank our vegetarian friend for helping us out around our house.  He LOVED it!  He raved about it so much that I ended up making a burrito for myself and I was very pleasantly surprised.  The changes I made was using seasoned black beans and I added a can of rotel to the mix.  This recipe would be great for lunch at work, can't wait to make it again!

This is a huge family favorite and we make it often!  Sometimes we use left over chicken and it is still great!  DELICIOUS and very easy to make!  On crazy days with a lot going on in the evening, I mix a huge batch and let all warm it up as needed.

Made this recipe tonight. It was absolutely delicious. I made a few minor changes, I used a whole onion, and I seasoned with chilli seasoning.  I topped the beans in the taco with shreaded cheddar. Amazing!

These were excellent. Adjusted the recipe a bit by adding cumin, chilli powder, chopped fresh seeded tomato, substituting cream cheese for Laughing Cow Jalapeño cheese wedges.  I'm not a fan of cilantro so I omitted this.  I then topped burritos with salsa.  Next time I will finely chopped a green onions and  adding sour cream as a topping.  Thanks for the meal  idea.  Delicious meatless meal.

I loved this recipe with the cream cheese. I added half pound of hamburger, 1/2 t. chile powder, and 1/2 t. cumin.

Delicious!  Only change was omitting the jalepeno pepper since we know from experience that it adds too much heat for my husband and me.  Easy and quick.

I followed directions on this exactly but it was just bland, bland, bland. There was not any real flavor there. Unbelievably, my husband actually liked this enough to eat it but was not overly enthused so I guess if I make it for him again, I will jazz it up with some salsa next time.  I will keep looking for a good burrito recipe.

My vegetarian husband loves these!  I add hot pepper flakes to the mix for a spicier version, which makes him sweat it out!  It's an easy recipe to fix for any size crowd as a main dish or appetizer (cut tortillas in half).  If time permits, I grill the tortillas in a pan with melted butter after I've rolled the sandwiches. This gives a nice golden crunch to them.

This was yummy and easy! So yummy that we made a second batch after eating the first. Well, the second batch became our lunch for next day at work. The first batch we followed to recipe. On the second batch we added 1 roma tomato. This is definitely something I will be making more often.

My whole family loves this and begs me to make it when we go camping. I added a few things. I added, 1 teaspoon cumin, ½ teaspoon chili powder (instead of the jalapeno), 2 10oz cans Rotel diced tomatoes lime and cilantro (make sure you drain them really well). I thought the recipe needed tomatoes and some more Mexican flavor. Its really good with whole grain tortillas.

Good recipe. &EZ! Hubs likes as a dip w/chips too. Sons like this until the guacamole runs out. I might really love this on homemade bread rounds, but didn't take the time this go round. I'm not sure how much I'd like this w/canned beans. We use our homecooked black beans w/lots of cumin, chili powder, garlic, onion, oregano & etc. This will be in our 'extended rotation', meaning, if I need more black bean recipes (or a quick one), I'll use this one because it is so different than anything else we make & it is nice. But I prefer black beans w/ 1:banana salsa & tumeric rice (hot banana salsa from this site & just add a bit of turmeric & garlic to rice while it cooks); 2:Quinoa Black Bean Burgers (from this site); 3:a black bean casserole I made up on the quick one day(corn tortillas, black beans, salsa, & cheddar in layers); 4:a simple black bean soup made of half of my black beans & half salsa (red or green); 5:black beans & rice as a side to dishes such as Peachy Chicken Picante (from this site but with our modifications - usually prefer fish for that though). 6: sherried black bean soup - black beans pureed w/lots of onions & a touch of cooking sherry & broth as needed (so EZ since I can use a Vita-Mix or a hand blender). // I don't usually need more black bean recipes than that, but if I need a quick meal w/black beans, or I want a black bean dip, this will be handy. (probably '6' servings w/plenty of 8" tortillas would be enough for our family of 5 w/side salad)

These were good and simple. I didn't have the red bell pepper so I added a little salsa to the mix. We ate ours as tacos cause that was the only tortillas I had on hand. Made about 5 tacos.

My family really enjoyed these.  I love how quick and easy it is to make...time is limited during the week.  I used lite cream cheese and diced chilis rather than jalapenos and heated the tortillas in the microwave for 30 seconds and they were wonderful. I made 4 burritos out of the suggested 2 servings, but based on the popularity I am going to have to double the recipe next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

Nice and creamy. Followed recipe to a T.  Could use Goat cheese instead of cream cheese for a healthier dish and red onion and chopped chile in adobo sauce to give a spicy smoky flavor.

I had some ground chicken that needed to be used up and added that, which also stretched this further to feed my family of six. Had enough filling for exactly ten tortillas. Left out the jalapenos as I didn't have any on hand. Delicious!

This is one of the best black bean recipes I have ever had, hands down.  While I cook a variety of different things every day, I always have a tough time finding new ways to eat more beans (for health purposes) and I do like them.. love black beans in fact, but so many recipes are just "meh."  Black beans I usually reserve for a side to go with Mexican dishes, or in chipotle chicken salad, or dip (black bean dip OMG).  I think since I've stumbled on this recipe in the last year I've probably made it a dozen times.  I like to make it for our lunches to take to work because it's easy and is both good cold (for DH) and reheats well (for me).  I usually double the recipe to get a handful of lunches out of it and don't change a thing except add some spices that appeal to my taste.  You could def. beef it up with some cooked chicken, ground beef, or some veggies, but it's great on it's own with a little sour cream and salsa.

I liked these. I did make mine with crushed red peppers and fresh jalepenos with a tad of cayenne. Gave them a serious kick. I liked how there is no meat. Very good. The red bell peppers gave a good complimentary flavor. I would make again

I thought this recipe was okay. It lacked the spicy favor that tend to go toward. . Though the idea of cooking the shells was good. The addition of cream cheese is great idea. It gives the interior of the burrito some texture. It was easy to make and if I were to make it again, I would add rice and other spices. I would also put some cheese and meat. (perhaps spiced up chicken)

My meat & potatoes husband loved these burritos! I keep frozen onion and red pepper in plastic lunch bags in the freezer, it is very handy. I will be making this dinner as one of my "staple" weekly meals. Only one problem, NO LEFTOVERS!!!!!!YUMYUM

Very good.  I replaced the jalapeno with half a can of rotel, doubled the cream cheese and added diced chicken and taco seasoning.  Tomorrow I plan to try this with quinoa or rice rather than a tortilla.  Yum.

This is an Awesome recipe, but like most everyone I changed it just a little to somewhat "enhance" it to my liking. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a quick dish, and leftovers are great too! Give it a try for yourself

I love this recipe! We never have leftovers. This recipe is better than Qdoba and Chipotle!  I add corn, rotel tomatoes, and 8oz of 1/3 less philadelphia cream cheese for a juicier burrito mix.

This is Fantastic! Super easy and it makes me feel like a pro!

My girlfriend does not like onions so I substituted the onion for the extra half of the bell pepper. Also, we found it is more delicious (and pretty) if we do not drain the beans before adding it to the skillet.

Fantastic! A new family favorite.  I used the 4 green onions I had on hand  and 6 small sweet peppers- and it turned out great. I doubled the recipe to serve 4- and we could have more.  I guess I'll triple it next time!

AMAZING!!!  I never thought going meatless could be so good!  This tastes a lot like Chipotle!!  A few changes I made based on some reviews I read were: I doubled this recipe + added 1 can of Rotel, cooked brown rice & omitted the jalapeno (so my daughter would eat it).  Also instead of adding the cilantro to the skillet mixture, I put fresh, raw cilantro and shredded moz cheese on top of the warm mixture before rolling the burrito. I didn't add any spices but did add a little extra salt (used Kosher).  I also didn't top the burritos with salsa 'cuz I thought it would be a little much. Can't wait for lunchtime (there's just enough left for 1 more).  Next time I will quadruple this & add more onion. MmmmmmmmmMMM!!  Thanks for a great recipe, this is definitely a keeper.  :o]

great starter recipe. After following recipe exact, I used Tina's suggestions and added more cream cheese, Rotel, corn and green chillis. I also added a half pack of taco seasoning mix. turned out great! served it with cheddar cheese, sour cream, black olives, sliced green onions and Taco Bell taco sauce. Hubby is a meat potatoes guy but he liked this recipe.

Excellent recipe. The only thing I changed
was to add a can of drained rotel tomatoes 
instead of the red bell pepper since I did not 
have one. Making it again tonight for dinner
since hubby requested it. I think this is the
3rd or 4th time he has requested this recipe
for dinner!!

Wow!  Very, very good -- and I don't like beans or red peppers, but this was awesome!  Perfect medley of flavors.  It made 2 perfect burritos (10" flour tortillas).  I didn't bake the tortillas, I just put them in the microwave with a moist paper towel for 1 min.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a T.

I gave this recipe three stars because of it's potential - as written it's pretty bland, but with some tweaking it's good.
I left out the cilantro because I cannot stand the taste of it. I added some chili powder, cumin, cayenne and red pepper flakes. I topped the burritos with some pickled jalapeño slices, pickled red onions (just slice thinly and soak in some apple cider vinegar for a little while), chopped tomato and lettuce and I thought they were really good that way. Prepared that way, I would rate them a 4. But without the extra seasonings and toppings, they would be pretty boring.
As for the texture, I know other reviewers felt it was too thick and pasty. Personally, I liked how thick it was. It kept the filling from falling out or becoming a drippy mess when I ate it.
And I also agree that this makes more than 2 burritos. I'd say it can make 3 or even 4.

I followed the recipe except that I use the whole brick of cream cheese. I didn't want to keep part of a brick so I used the whole thing. This was really good and next time I may use refried beans because they are a favourite of ours.

These were so tasty. I eliminated the jalepanos because I hate spicy and used green peppers and no cilantro based on what I had on hand. I also replaced some of the vegetable oil with bacon grease for extra yumminess. I doubled the recipe to make sure there was enough for everyone and that was not necessary.  This recipe makes plenty!  I froze three burritos (next time I'm buying extra tortillas just to make extras to freeze) and they were just as delicious reheated.

This was a very good, quick meal.  I did make some changes based on other reviews and there are things I will definitely do different next time.  I added packaged Southwestern flavored chicken, which was good, but homemade shredded chicken with fajita seasoning would be better.  The prepackaged was a time-saver, though.  I also added some cumin, Rotel tomatoes and shredded cheddar.  I did not drain the tomatoes, but will next time, as it was too soupy.  It probably would have been okay with more beans and/or chicken, but I was only feeding 2.  Anyway, this was very easy and tasty.

This was surprisingly a HUGE hit at my house. I say surprisingly because 2 out of 3 of my kids are extremely picky and I just wasn't sure how this was going to go over with them.  Well, they LOVED it! Every single one of them licked their plates clean.  I did change the recipe ever so slightly based on what I had as well as another reviewers suggestions.  First, I tripled the recipe to serve 6 for my family of 5.  I omitted the bell pepper (didn't have it) and added a can of rotel with green chiles.  I only had two cans of black beans so I used a can of refried beans for the 3rd can and one pkg of cream cheese.  It came out a little on the "soupier" side (probably because of the refried beans as well as the rotel), but it was so scrumptious.  I spooned it into burrito sized tortillas and there was enough for 6 large burritos.  I will make this again without a doubt!

Great burritos, but I did add a couple of preferred ingrdients: drained can of diced tomatoes, a little thyme & garlic powder and added a tablespoon of vinegar. Also, I used red pepper flakes instead of jalepenos (didn't have any). I topped it off with fresh cilantro instead of cooking it in the mixture as some suggested. Very quick and easy.

This is good for a quick and easy weeknight dinner.  It is very filling! I used 4 low carb tortillas, and lofat cream cheese and only 1 tbsp of oil. I also added some shopped fresh tomatoes to the bean mixture.

I found this recipe a little bland for my taste. If you're dead set on making these, add something for a bit of flavor.

This was a quick and yummy dinner. I forgot to get the jalapeno peppers but it was still great with out them. I used low fat cream cheese and whole wheat flour tortillas. I rounded it out with some salad greens. Very good. Thanks for sharing!

Good recipe but after reading over some of the reviews I tweaked it just slightly. I did not completely drain nor rinse the beans, I left in some the juice for flavor and moisture. I also added fresh garlic, more cilantro, and oregano. Also, i let the mixture simmer for about 30 minutes and then added the cream cheese and let that cook for 10 minutes. As for final prep, I made ground beef cooked with the chopped green peppers and garlic,  rolled up with rice, and mexican blend cheese. AWESOME! 

also, it makes for a great dip when you just can't hold another burrito in! yum!

Definitely a solid recipe...we topped them with cheese, guac, salsa and tomatoes just like I would any taco/burrito !!  YUM, I don't think that it needed 3 oz of cream cheese(if I double next time..I wouldn't dbl the cream cheese part), but it was creamy and yummy and totally filling!!

I'm not a fan of cilantro, so I had a pinch or two of cumin instead. I wrap them in regular taco sized tortillas, and it makes 6-8 which is perfect for our whole family.

used non-fat cream cheese and didn't use the oil to make a good low calorie meal. Very filling, but was a little plain, that could have been because of the calorie cuts I made, spiced it up with some salsa. Overall, I would make again, but its nothing to get the mouth watering.

Ths definitely makes 4. I added 1/4 tsp of chili powder and cumin, as well as salsa, as recommended. Topped with 1 oz cheese per burrito and baked until melted.

My husband and I want to try to do a "meatless Monday" and decided to try this.  It was amazing! I didn't change much at all. After the mixture was ready, I rolled the burritos, topped them with shredded cheese and put them in the oven (375)  for about 10 minutes to melt the cheese. We will definitely make these again!

I liked this recipe, but didn't love it.  My burritos were not dry, but I did not rinse and fully drain the beans.  I am not sure why you would do that, I thought a little bit of the bean sauce was good.  I did add some extra cream cheese and some mexican cheese before serving. These were just a little bit bland, I am thinking next time I might add some taco seasoning or something.  I think the corn, tomatoes or green chilies that people suggested would be good and I think the avocado would be nice too.  To me these seemed like they would be appropriate to feed to kids. Sometimes we will make some recipes and I call them kiddy recipes, because they seem very kid friendly.  I also think this would be a nice lunch item. It is super easy to make.  My husband does most of the cooking, but I made these and he really liked them. I would give this recipe a try, but just now you might need to add some seasonings or spice. Oh, maybe more jalepenos would be good.

This was delicious! However, the fat content was a bit high, so I used 1/2 fat cream cheese, and didn't use quite as much. Also, slices of avocado in the wrap was essential- leveled out the somewhat overwhelming cheese taste and made it AMAZING. Also added a bit more jalapeno for a bit more spice. Delicious and easy recipe!!

Very good and easy to make, but it needs at least twice the salt that's called for, and I would probably opt for less cream cheese in the future.  As another reviewer suggested, I think it would be better with some rice to make it more filling.

Delicious!  I have made this several times now, different every time.... you can't mess it up.  Ive added corn and spinach with some cumin and jalepeno's and it was so good.  I've also done it without corn and added a frozen steamer wild rice mix.  Always use low fat cream cheese and have never noticed the difference.

OMG!! This is THE BEST bean burritos I've ever had!!!  I usually don't even like bean burritos.  I think cream cheese is the key ingredient in here.  My whole family loved it and it's definitely a keeper!!

These are delicious! As a vegetarian, I eat a lot of black beans and burritos and was wondering just how much better these would be than the others. But they really are fantastic. The cream cheese gives it such a nice texture and really helps the flavors come out. As per another reviewer, I added a can of Rotel tomatoes with green chiles and more garlic (3 or 4 cloves). I also used a pretty potent red onion. Didn't have any cilantro on hand but they didn't need it. Frozen corn and rice would be good additions to these burritos.

It never ceases to "amaze" me that people will rate something with three stars...and then say they didn't add this...or changed that...then it's not the recipe your rating is it?  These were fabulous. Thank you!

These burritos are one of the best things I've ever made! I make them very spicy by adding lots of jalapenos and hot salsa.  Excellent!

Let me preface this by saying that I HATE black beans, bell peppers, and cilantro. Being a glutton for punishment, and searching for meatless dinners, I decided to try this out. After cooking the  out of the onions and bell peppers, I threw the beans in and cooked them. It got reaaaaaaally dry and started to stick to the non-stick pan, so I put about 2 tbs water in the pan, and added the cream cheese(I used about 5 ounces), salt, and sprinkled it with chili powder. I recommend taking it off the burner not too long after that, since mine was sticking a lot. It turned out to be pretty  good. I was impressed that even someone who hates almost every ingredient in there could love it. My boyfriend put tapatio and sour cream on his, mine was fine as is. So good, and recommend this to everyone even if it sounds iffy to you!

We used an entire jalepano because we enjoy spicy food, but this recipe is excellent. The sour cream binds the ingredients together and makes the mixture smooth. Next time I think I would also add chopped tomato.

YUM!  This is a wonderful, light on the stomach, yet filling recipe.  The only thing I will do differently next time is add a bit of seasoning to the mix.  These are delicious, easy, and quick.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent!!  I had some left over chili kicking around that was perfect for this. Used 1 teasp dry Cilantro (husband's not a fan). Otherwise followed to the letter. Very quick, easy and delicious.  Thank you!

This was an easy and tasty recipe. I added some flavored rice to the burrito as I felt the amount of filling made was a little on the sparse side.  Also added salsa verde.  Will add it to the regular fare here.

Looking at the recipe and reading the reviews I didn't think we'd like it as much as we did.  Didn't cook the onions and peppers as much as recipe stated so there was a little crunch, so very good! The cream cheese really adds a great creamy flavor.

SO quick and easy! My boyfriend loved these! In line with the suggestiongs of other reviewers, I made the following additions: 1) 1/2 can of diced tomatoes and green chilies 2) 1 tsp ground chili powder 3) 1 tsp ground cumin. Additionally I used pickeled jalepenos instead of fresh because that's what I had on hand. This turned out very spicey. We topped with cheddar cheese and a little sour cream to tone down the spice.. it was delicious!

I might not want them every night, but I definitely want them once a week! Perfect for meatless Monday...OMG they are so good!!! I love the spice and the creaminess. I doubled the recipe and was able to get 6 good sized burritos out of it. I think I need to quadruple the recipe next week so that I can freeze some for lunch at work. I am going to take my Spanish friend one, I'm sure she is going to love it! Thanks Jessie. =)

These burritos came out just okay for me.  I'm not sure if there was something I did wrong, though I followed the recipe exactly.  There wasn't a ton of flavor in this dish...I found it to be rather bland, and VERY heavy on just black bean flavor.  In the future, I might try a couple of different spices and add a few ingredients...I'd maybe add cumin, coriander and some lime, and add sour cream, lettuce and tomato to the actual burrito.  Not sure I'll be making this dish again, though.  I'll probably try another burrito recipe.

Kid friendly! I had to leave out the jalapenos unfortuantely (added hot sauce to mine!) but then added a T. of taco seasoning mix and some chicken broth since they were so thick. Fast and healthy! Kids ate them up! served with sour cream and shredded lettuce.

I don't know if I did something wrong with these, but they weren't anything special too me.  They were decent, but not what I would expect with 4 1/2 stars after 728 reviews.  Following the recipe, they came out a little heavy on the cream cheese.  It overpowered the rest of the flavors.  Maybe I'll try it again later and put less cream cheese.

Wow, these are fantastic1 Don't be put off by the calorie count like I almost was. They definitely serve at least 3 and could almost be streched to 4. I used low fat cream cheese, used 2 ounces instead of 3 and left out the additional salt. These are great as is, but are also good served with sour cream and salsa.

One of my favorite recipes I've encountered on the site. I make this all the time. I agree with the other reviewers that I can usually get more than 2 out of this especially if I've added rice but really I like the best as they are.

Great recipe! Hubby and I recently decided to become vegetarian and this is the first recipe I tried. Made it exactly as stated. We both really liked this dish! We didn't miss the meat at all! Hubby LOVES burritos so this will definitely become a regular meal for us. Thanks for a great recipe!

My husband loves these.  I have made several times now, first as stated, since I have added a little bit of cheese to each (cheddar and/or cojita).  Every good!  Will make again and again!

this was pretty good. super easy and fast to make. it was a nice lunch and my sister thought it was great but my meat loving hubby was so-so about it. i would make it again and it's pretty easy to add any other items you may have leftover that would go well with it.

Yummy!!  I am a big meat eater so I was skeptical when I saw the only protein I was getting was through the black beans.  But I didn't miss the meat at all.  It was so good. Will make again and again.

I would have never thought about putting cream cheese in a burrito but it worked out very well. The texture and flavor were very nice.  Using 10" tortillas, this made 5 burritos, not 2 and that was after I sampled the beans a bit!

delicious! i followed the suggestion to add some cumin and chili powder to taste (about 1/2 t or more) and added about half of a small can of diced green chiles... also i used 4 oz of cream cheese instead of 3. i served them with shredded cheddar and salsa, but didn't use any jalepenos. my husband loved these. they are quick, relatively healthy, fresh, and delicious. definitely going to be added to my "rotation." thank you!

Yum!!!  These were perfect!  I do have the tendency to add things to recipes out of habit.  I added a can of mild diced chilis but I did leave out the jalapenos since my daughter was eating this with me.  I did yellow bell instead of red bell and that's pretty much it!  Great served with gaucamole!

These were healthy and delicious.  I added about 1/2 tsp of cumin because it needed a little "something".  The mixture is thick after you add the cream cheese with the beans, but you can easily fix this by adding about a 1/2 cup or so of your favorite salsa.  I also added a tablespoon, instead of a teaspoon, of chopped jalapenos and the burritos still were not that spicy so next time I'll add a lot more.  Like others have said, this recipe makes more like 4 burritos than 2, but I would still double the recipe next time so I'll have leftovers.

These were quite bland and dry.  I will not make this again.  If you are planning on making, I would add salsa before rolling so they aren't so dry.  This also improves the flavor.

Scaled this recipe to yield 2 servings. Followed the recipe except for some ingredients modification based on other reviewers' suggestions and my hubby's request.  (1) Used 7.5 oz of black beans only since I added 1/2 lb of ground beef (per my hubby's request) (2) Had no jalapeno on hand so I just added 1 tsp hot sauce (3) Added 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp chili powder, & 1 TBSP sour cream (4) Followed a reviewer's advise of heating the tortillas using the microwave (5) Shredded colby jack and monterey jack cheese, mixed them together, and placed them on top of rolled burritos. Placed them inside the microwave to melt the cheese. NEXT TIME I'll try to add diced tomatoes/salsa and jalpeno/green chiles. Thanks for the recipe & reviews! :-)

This recipe is very good, and you don't even realize that it's very healthy for you! I don't eat dairy, so I just used tofu cream cheese, and it came out just as good. If you like tomato you could probably add tomato, or even salsa. I used a little extra jalapeno, because I wanted a bit more spice. I also used sprouted grain tortillas, and it came out soooo good! Great for vegans the way I made it, and great for an acid-alkaline diet!

I pretty much followed the ingredients recipe except for being very specific with measuring. I also added a dash of ground cumin and chili powder. Instead of mixing the cream cheese in, I spread some on my tortilla and put the mixture on top. I also didn't have any cilantro so that was left out.

These were delicious. I used 2 cans of pinto beans and sour cream instead of the cream cheese because I forgot it at the store. My husband and I both loved these. I also used a whole jalapeno, and we both agreed that the amount of jalapeno was perfect. I do recommend using the jalapeno, I made one without the jalapeno for my 2 year old, and it was bland without it.

A good base recipe. I will be adding more jalepenos and some chicken next time, but really could add about anything. I like the cream cheese sub for the standard shredded cheese. I used reduced fat cream cheese. These are also quite filling

Easy and fast recipe that tasted great! I wasn't big on measuring, but I added two chopped tomatoes, one whole chopped jalapeno, 1/2 c corn, 1/2 c. chopped mushrooms and two cloves of garlic. I also subbed in fat free cream cheese, which worked out just fine. It made a ton - way more than two servings.

YUM!  I used corn tortillas and a touch (maybe 1 TBS.) or barbecue sauce, and these were delish!

Very good, quick and easy!   I added a little salsa, to make them a little more moist, and some shredded cooked chicken breast leftover from the night before.   I used a little less cream cheese, and didn't have cilantro so I left it out and it was delishious.   It made 6 smail tortillas.  Garnish with little fine shreaded Mexican cheese.  Yum!

Very tasty! We loved these! I added some shredded chicken and a can of corn. I also added some chili pepper and cumin. I didn't have any jalapeno peppers, so I just left them out. I added some spicy pico to the mix at the very end which added a little spice to it. I added shredded cheddar into the wrap and we ate them all up! Very tasty! Thanks for a great recipe!

These were just OK, nothing spectacular.  I'm usually a fan of anything Mexican, but I'm not sure what the big deal about these burritos is.  Maybe more spices and some tomatoes would spruce them up, but I found nothing great about beans with some veggies and cream cheese in a flour tortilla.

Made this for six people. Did not use any jalapeno pepper, but used some jalapeno sauce. It wasn't too hot and everybody liked it. It would also be a good dip for tortilla chips. Loved this recipe.

I followed the recipe pretty closely.  We LOVED them.  Very easy and fairly healthy.  I don't know how someone found these to be runny - obviously you would drain the beans as the recipe says.  The cream cheese does a good job binding everything together.  I chose this recipe over another for bean burritos because the cream cheese intrigued me.  It was very good.  My tortillas were only 118 calories each.  This can easily make 3 or 4.  I add tomatoes and lettuce and was quite satisfied with one.

This was really good.  I made the following changes after reading the other reviews.  I added 1/2 can of tomatos w/chilies, 1tsp each of cumin/chili powder, 1/2 can corn, brown rice, left over rotisserie chicken from earlier in the week and increased the cream cheese to 6 oz( used low fat) because it looked dry.  This is tasty, quick and inexpensive.  Can't wait to have the left overs.  Thanks for the great recipe.

this was an EXCELLENT recipe! it was a perfect combination  to create a mouth-watering, honest-to-goodness burrito.  I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, so I switched the jalapeno peppers for 1-2 chipotle peppers with adobo sauce.  And I cut out the cilantro.  My only complaint was that the recipe did not fill that many burritos - so next time I make this, I'll definitely increase the proportions.  Very, very GOOD!!

I totally LOVED this recipe, but DH only thought it was "OK".  I did add about 2-3 tablespoons of Picante Sauce and sprinkled some grated cheddar on them at serving time.  Served mine on homemade flour tortillas but DH only wanted his on corn tortillas.  Different strokes for different folks!!

My husband has to have meat, so I add seasoned (onion powder, garlic powder, cumin, paprika, chili powder) hamburger to this recipe.  I also use Onion/Chive cream cheese and a little sour cream.  A little beef base for extra flavor.  This has become one of my families favorite meals.

These were GREAT! Seriously, you have to try them! I have never eaten black beans before and I really wanted to try this so I did and it was great. Also, My husband liked it to so It was a winner all around. I added taco seasoning to the burrito filling and that made it kinda spicy. MMM

Easy to prepare, but needs more flavor/salt or seasoning than the recipe calls for. I also made rice to add into the burritos.

These were good...but I think I was expecting a little more. I made exactly as written and found them a little bland. With some doctoring and more spices, they could probably be much better. Thanks for sharing!

the name of this recipe is spot-on cause these burritos are DELicious!! I doubled the recipe and did alter it a bit based on suggestions and what I had--I added a can of tom and green chiles, didn't have any cilantro (don't like anyway), cooked up some 90 sec spanish rice to add in, used less fat cream cheese...I've made these three times already and always have a few burritos left eventhough my fiance eats a ton--they're very filling (esp when you add a little rice!) and SO satisfying!! AND they are easy on the wallet!! I will be making these forever!!!

My husband loved these and so did I. I didn't follow the recipe exactly though. I needed to use up some leftover grilled meat and added it to the mix. It was so good with the meat added, I'm almost sorry I did so because now I'm not sure I'll like it as much without the meat. Although, now I have a recipe to use up that last little bit of grilled meat. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

I’m a vegetarian  but rest of my family is not. So I always look for something that we all could eat.  (not making 2 or 3 different meals at night  to please everyone.) I loved this recipe as it is. But for my husband, no. It didn’t have that much flavor. So second time when I made this, I add taco seasoning,  He liked it but still it wasn't so great.  Third time, I add hamburger meat and taco seasoning.  He loved it! Thanks you for sharing this recipe!!

These were delicious! Only thing different I did was to double the cream cheese and add a few more spices like cumin etc. Everyone who was over loved them and they are so easy to make:)

Very easy.  I added Rotel and Uncle Ben's Ready Whole Grain Medley Santa Fe rice. Leftovers great for lunch the next day.

Instead of canned whole black beans, try canned "Refried Black Beans" made by Ducal brand.  You may have to look for them at a Hispanic Market although Publix may carry it. It is worth the effort!

We really enjoyed this recipe. I skipped the jalapeno, but my husband added some salsa to his.  It made 5 small 7-inch burritos. Next time, I'll add some rice to bulk up the filling.

MMMM! I didn't follow this recipe exactly by any means but it was so good!!!  First of all my onion had black mold on it so I had to throw it way...So i used almost a whole bell pepper instead. I also added extra jalepeno because I like spicy food and I love the taste of jalepeno. I used my mini chopper to get everything minced fine because I didn't want to crunch on anything.  I added a whole can plain diced tomatoes too (without chilis hence the extra jalepeno).  I also used the seasoned recipe black beans and only drained off half the juice w/o rinsing because I almost forgot to do so. I heard people say it was bland so I added a little cajun seasoning along with the a little xtra salt to add flavor.  The cream cheese addition is PHENOMENAL.   It came out spicy and creamy and flavorful and delicious. Next time i would use a little less tomato and use onion..But they were awesome!  I'm a vegetarian in college so easy recipes are always appreciated.

These are great burritos.  They taste just like the ones i get at prepared food section at whole foods... but much cheaper!  the only changes I'd suggest would be to use half the cream cheese.  They are plenty creamy with only half.  I also used light cream chesse.  Also, i suggest adding 1/2 cup corn (i used frozen).  They freeze well too.

I make this recipe a lot because it's quick and I almost always have the ingredients on hand.  I've been known to add some salsa to the mixture at the very end and I always season the beans with adobo seasoning.

Yum, yum. I added about a teaspoon of cumin, but otherwise left the recipe as stated. We added 'Mexican Rice I' to the tortillas and topped with cheddar cheese. We really enjoyed these burritos and I will definitely be making them again and again!

This was easy and nutritious. Flavor wasn't great, hence the 4 stars. I had to add some of that spreadable cheese in a garlic and herb flavor, which really helped. I actually used the leftover filling to go with rice as a side dish for fajitas...the beans were long gone!

When my boyfriend thinks something vegetarian is wonderful, its a minor miracle- and he loved these. Other reviewers are correct- this makes about 4 burritos. Don't cut back on the salt- the cream cheese counts on it to add zip!

I omitted the red pepper (personal preference) and added leftover shredded chicken, otherwise followed the recipe. These were very good. Daughter and husband loved them, except husband wasn't fond of the cilantro. Will definitely make again.

Oh I loved these so much!! It was so incredibly easy, I'm sure I'm going to keep some black beans on hand more often, when I don't feel like spending a lot of time on dinner. My DH, liked the taste, he just said he missed the meat.

Very, very good.  I used chili oil.  I also cut up some chicken, mixed in some Ancho & Cayenne Chili Powder and fried up the chicken in the wok first.  Then I removed from Wok and followed instructions, adding chicken back at the end.  Excellent - this will be a favorite in our family for years to come.  Thanks for sharing!

These are good, but the recipe just begs to be altered.  I tried to stick pretty close to the recipe even though I could think of a million ways to change it.  I added a little cumin and chili powder, omitted the cilantro, and used neufchatel cheese instead of full-fat cream cheese.  I also heated the tortillas in the microwave, although I'm sure that didn't change the taste.  The first burrito that I ate was fine but a little bland.  For the second burrito, I added salsa and cheese and that gave it more pep.  Some other things I might try with this are corn, canned tomatoes, rice, chicken, spinach, sour cream, guacamole, and definitely more spices.  As other reviewers have mentioned, this makes very large burritos if you're only making two.

Very easy and good "as is", plus you can adjust to suit your mood - sometimes I add some cheese and/or rice into the burrito, sometimes I have it with just the bean filling.

This was very easy and good. It's really just a matter of spicing and flavoring the beans, so you can substitute spices to suit your taste - I added cumin and skipped the cilantro. Since some reviewers thought it was a bit dry, I added some salsa to the mix, but you probably could do lime juice or something like that instead. I poured the canned beans through a splatter guard and just let them sit all spread out to drip for a while, which seemed to work well. This recipe is a good alternative to our usual mexican fare of soft tacos or fajitas and I'll be making it again!

Pretty good.  I doubled all the ingredients but halfed the cream cheese. I also added 1/4 lime juice & 1 tea of cumin & cayenne. Topped with avacado. I have been  married to Mexican man for 18 years the best way to heat a tortilla is pancake grilled to medium heat then put thetortilla on and filp over when it starts to swell up,then heat the other side till it swells remove and wrap in a dish towel to keep warm.

This is by far the best black bean burrite recipe I've ever made! The only change I made was to add some salsa to the pan at the very end. It seemed like it would of been a tad to dry otherwise. I also suggest microwaving the tortillas. I don't see how you could roll them up once they go in the oven. I could eat this again and again, it's THAT good!

I say cut the salt in half!  Too much!  Also, we sprinkled cheddar cheese on top of the mixture before putting it in the tortilla.  I didn't find it dry at all!  Salsa would have tasted good too though.  We made 8" tortilla burritos and got 4 out of it, plus I made a rice dish on the side.  Yummy and easy meal!

Good but not amazing.  It's a simple recipe and leaves a lot of room for customizing, which is why I only gave it 3 stars; it doesn't stand out on it's own.  I added more garlic and grilled chicken to bump it up a notch.  I would make it again because it's a great base for burritos.

I loved these!  I did add cumin, crushed red pepper, chili powder, corn, rice and drained diced tomatoes.  Because of the "extras" that I added I used about 6oz of cream cheese.  Super fast and wonderful.  This does make a lot and I ate this for lunch for 3 days.  Good in the wrap and good without.  Thanks for a great recipe:)

These were delicious!  I don't like anything spicy, so I substituted the jalapenos for canned mild green chilis....worked out great!

This was really yummy! I did change a few things, instead of using jalapenos I used some El Pato Jalapeno Salsa and put one boneless skinless shredded chicken breast in as well as green chilis. It was really good! Next time we're going to try some ground beef in it :) It made 3 medium sized burritos.

Not just a clever name...these really are delicious burritos!  I was amazed at how good they came out with such simple ingredients.  I added some lime juice, and made fresh gauc to put on them.  So so good.  Will be making again for sure.  One thing though...My husband and I got 4 good size burritos out of it.  If you had 2 they would be ginormous!

These were somewhat disappointing, but not awful. I added more jalapeno and some chili powder and they were still rather bland. I also added shredded cheese and salsa on top of the enchiladas. Maybe I just didn't like the cream cheese in them. Will not make again.

We like things a little bit on the spicy side so I added a whole green chile, a 1/2 teaspoon of chipolte chili powder and jalapeno infused salt. The addition of corn has a sweetness which compliments the dish well.

Wonderful!  And a fast meal too!  Omitted bell pepper and jalepeno since I was out of them but added in part of a can of mild green chili peppers.  Increased the cilantro since we really like the flavor.  Also, added in some jicama salad that I had left over in the fridge from the recipe "Jicama Salad with Cilantro and Lime" on this site.  If you haven't tried jicama, please do so.  I add the jicama just prior to rolling the burritos, since it does not need to be heated.

Wonderful recipe----my guys asked for this again this week! Changes I made: 1.Used fat-free cream cheese and reduced-fat tortilla shells. 2.Boiled/shredded chicken breasts to up the protein. 3.Added a can(including liquid) chopped green chiles and a little salsa, to prevent the shredded chicken from drying the filling out. 4. The reduced-fat shells were a little dry looking, so I thickened a can of enchilada sauce and poured it over the top/sides. Topped with a little fat-free cheddar and just heated through in the oven. Next time, I might add the fat-free cheddar to the top after I heat the burritos/sauce in the oven to prevent it from forming that 'crust' on top. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

Delicious.  Added diced fresh tomatoes and used low fat cream cheese.  Added my own recipe for rice (sauteed onions and garlic, add jasmine rice, chicken stock, and 1 tsp. cumin - cook per directions for rice - remove from heat and add chopped cilantro).  Will definitely make these again.

This is an awesome recipe, that is simple and easy to prepare. The recipe makes two very large portions, that actually could feed four people. I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Update 7-18-09: I have made this numerous times since this original review. Sometimes I follow the recipe strictly, other times I change it up. I've substituted one diced habanero pepper in place of the jalapeno for more heat, and I have also tossed a few diced up sun dried tomatoes in the mix giving it a subtle sweetness along with the extra heat. In all forms I have enjoyed this recipe thoroughly.

Tasty, easy, and filling. Instead of jalapeno I served canned green chiles on the side. Made them again using pinto beans and less cream cheese - a very flexible, useful recipe.

Tweaking - Used a whole red pepper by accident, used a small amount of pickled jalapeno (due to someone not happy with fresh), used regular parsley, not cilantro (forgot to purchase). Added up to a delicious burrito with melted cheese, lettuce, tomato on top and a side of guacamole and Mexican rice.

Outstanding. I added about 1/2 tsp of chipotle chili powder, a 1/2 cup of canned corn and left out the bell pepper. Added shredded cheese, sour cream and fresh chopped tomato before rolling up. These are wonderful and I didn't miss the meat. This is for sure a keeper!

This was a great recipe for "meatless mondays." I added corn like some reviewers mentioned and added some Spanish rice. It tasted just like a Chipotle Burrito :) (guess I don't need to go there any longer, hah!)

This recipe is GREAT. My fiance doesn't like black beans or onions, but he loved this recipe. We ate it with toasted pita bread. The only thing I altered was the jalapenos instead I used red pepper flakes. It was a tiny bit spicy with lots of flavor.

I followed Tina's recommendation of doubling the recipe and adding green chilies (I did it in leiu  of jalapenos--my kids might not want it too spicy), upping the garlic to 3 tsp. adding 1 tsp. cumin and some diced tomatoes (I don't like whole diced tomatoes so I just added the juice)and then adding 8 oz. of cream cheese and a can of corn.  Turned out delicious!  Thanks.

My Fiance and I really loved this dish. We did make some changes to it to use up what was on hand. Instead of the Jalapano we used a big Hungarian hot pepper and doubled the recipe. Flavours rocked. Next time we plane to put some nice crispy romain in right before wrapping to give it some cool crunch. Thanx for The dish! Peace love and applesauce!

This filling was AMAZING!  I made it exactly as written except I added about a 1/2 tsp of cumin.  So good and very filling.

This was SO good. I just loved it. I followed the recipe exactly! It was full of flavor. During the cooking process I was scared it was getting to watery, but by the end it had gone down.   I served this with grilled corn and some chips and guac!

This recipe is great!  I followed some others suggestions and added 1/2 tsp cumin and 1/2 tsp chili powder.  Very spicy!  I also added some frozen spinach and a dash of nutmeg. This made 4 servings for my family. I will definitely make these again.

Yummy! I followed the recipe exactly as written, using low fat cream cheese and jalapenos from a jar. Also used green tortillas for extra color. I doubled the recipe for four of us and it was just the right amount. Served with Sweet Corn Cake on the side.

I made this recipe twice. The first time, I made it exactly the way it was directed and it was good! I had no complaints.  The next time I made it, I added tomatos, cumin, red chili powder, and put slides of avocado in my burrito. Both ways of making the burrito are delicious!

This recipe is so delicious and easy to make! I added 1 1/2 cups of cubed chicken to the vegetables and browned them. Also I sprinkled the mixture with grated Mexican cheese and served the tortillas with sour creme. Thanks for sharing this recipe, I will definitely make it again!

Easy fixing and really tasty!  Tasted original recipe and it was really delicious.  As suggested previously, added to the original recipe:  1/2 tsp chili powder, 1/2 tsp cumin, frozen corn, approximately 1/3 cup medium salsa, bumped up to a large fresh minced jalapeno, and Mexican blend cheese.  My husband loved it.  Yummy, keeper!  Thank you for this delicious recipe!

OMG, these are so good. I tasted the bean mixture before I added the cilantro and was not impressed. Well, after adding the cilantro and 1tbs of salsa these were great! A healthy, cheap, quick meal! Thanks.

LOVED this recipe.  I added 1/4t. cumin and 1/2t. chili powder, as well as a half can of Rotel and topped the filling with shredded cheddar and fresh salsa...it was perfect.  Next time I may add some corn and rice, but it certainly isn't needed.  They were excellent!!!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  We eat meat almost every night for dinner so I'm always looking for some good recipes that don't include meat to change things up a bit.  The only changes I made were that I added a little lime juice with the cilantro and added some salsa in the tortilla.  I used fat free cream cheese so this was a very light and easy recipe.  The hardest part was just chopping everything up!

I made this recipe when our son and his vegetarian girlfriend came for a visit. It was delicious and was enjoyed by everyone, including the meat lovers. I did not have fresh cilantro or hot peppers.  I used 1/2 of the called-for dried cilantro and some crushed red pepper flakes. I also added Mexican-style rice as others suggested. A vegetable salad and the burritos with a light dessert made us an excellent meal. I also served this with the fresh tomato salsa recipe from all recipes for the burritos and chips.  Delicious!

Love, love, love this!! I did add chicken, oh and some diced up fresh spinach in the mixture. I also put Spanish rice in the tortilla as a filler. I doubled it and made extras to put in the freezer - they were awesome out of the freezer as a quick lunch! Great, great recipe!!

This was quite good - and very healthy too. I, like many, made a few changes: I added about 2 tsp. cumin, 3 cloves of garlic (minced), 1 chipotle in adobo and (chopped fine), low-fat cream cheese, 1 cup frozen corn, and 1 can of diced tomatoes (drained). I also used tortillas from Costco that you cook at home. My son has decided that it "is DEFINITELY a keeper!".

I wish these were spicier! Next time I'll add the whole jalapeno and maybe a little chile powder as well. I ended up opening my burrito and adding some fresh spicy pico de gallo. Perfect! I will make these again for sure, so fast and easy!

A good starter recipe for a vegetarian meal. I do think it's a bit bland so I up the jalapeno significantly. The cream cheese cuts the heat. Very good warmed up as well.

Good but had to make without the jalepenos.    Mixture was a bit dry on the tongue.  Would have been better with some salsa.  I think it could take some green pepper too to add to the flavor and color...maybe half and half with the red.  Also, I think I will add some shredded cheddar next time.

Oh my gosh these were fantastic!  I was hesitant about the cream cheese (due to high-fat content), but I cut it down and used a light version.  Also, used what I had on hand.  Didn't have cilantro or bell pepper; didn't miss the bell pepper but definitely will make sure to get cilantro next time.  I used a can of diced tomatoes (w/spices) as another reviewer suggested.  Also froze leftovers and they were the best take-to-work lunch I've ever had. I added some leftover cooked chicken and some spanish rice to mine as well.  It's a great basic recipe and you can add/omit stuff to your own taste.  Thanks for the post!

The cream cheese really makes this recipe. Very good, especially when fresh guacamole is added! This is a nice, quick recipe and good for large groups of people!

Really good basic recipe.  I added cooked rice, roman beans besides the black, cumin, coriander, cayenne, cheese, and avocado.  It was delicious.

I'm sorry, but I didn't care much for these.  I just didn't find the beans and cream cheese really went together.  Just personal taste I guess...

I was disappointed with the end result.  I followed the recipe exactly and the consistency is very thick and something's missing.  Not sure if I was supposed to drain the beans?  I will make a lot of adjustments if I make this again.

Kind of boring - they were super easy to make but needed just a bit more "something" to spice them up - maybe I will try the jalapeno next time since I didn't have any this time, used red and green pepper and a whole garlic clove, will try them one more time with some adjustments

This recipe was soooo good!!! I used neufchatel cheese for a healthier option and I also added some corn.  My 2 year old daughter even likes them.  We will make again.

These are so so good!  I would say they are  good as is, excellent with some changes.  I added one can of Rotel, like some else suggested, used light cream cheese, and also added some shredded chicken from the recipe "Lime Chicken Soft Tacos" (also on this site) that I'd cooked in the slow cooker and shredded.  To me the lime-y chicken absolutely MADE these burritos!  The only other things I changed were to add cumin (a must!) and also throw in a handful of shredded cheddar since we love cheese.  Awesome dinner!  I plan on making some more to put in the freezer for nights I'm short on time.

These are awesome. Could use more jalapeno if you want spicy. The current amount adds no heat at all, just flavor. Don't skip the cilantro! It's the perfect finish to the cheese and bean combo.

We make these all the time now.  We find this recipe most useful when we're having our vegetarian friends over!  What a great hearty meal without a drop of meat.  We also add cheese to the completed burrito because we're die hard cheese fiends.

I made this for dinner tonight and I must say that they turned out great. I had some left over black beans and rice from a couple of days ago so this was the perfect    recipe to use them in.  I used the advice from a few other reviewers adding cumin, using the stir-fry mix, adding some fresh tomatoes and adding rice.  It definitely made a good amount of filling.  I had plenty left over for lunch tomorrow.

These had a good flavor, but a little bit of lime juice added the missing touch. We will definitely be having these again for a quick and easy meal.

Very good!  I used a can of cilantro and lime rotel and skipped the red pepper because I didn't have it on hand. I also added an extra ounce of cream cheese because I had 1/2 of a brick (4 ounces) and I just wanted to use it up. After rolling, I topped these with shredded cheddar and baked them at 375 for about 3 minutes, just until the cheese was melted.  Oh, and I added about a tsp of cumin at the suggestion of other reviewers.  Served them up with chopped tomatoes, guacamole, sour cream, and salsa! Made for a lovely dinner, with plenty of leftovers for 2 people.

This is my husband's new favorite recipe.  Even my four-year-old who normally shuns spicy food gobbled his up.  My husband's only complaint with the original recipe was that there was no meat (men!), so I shredded some broiled chicken to the bean mixture.  Like another reviewer, I tossed in a pinch of cumin and chili powder.  These were great- thanks!

I had such high expectations for this meal because of it's rating, but this was probably the most overrated recipe I've seen.  It definitely wasn't terrible, but nothing close to 5 stars.  I liked that this was easy, but I think a can of black beans with a little seasoned salt tastes better than this.  Sorry.

I doubled the recipe and used 8 oz fat free cream cheese. Tomatoes would be good next time. I will also add some salsa for extra flavor, as they were a little bland. I also used whole wheat tortillas, and this recipe definetly serves more than 2, the doubled batch probably seres about 6 on taco size tortillas. Thanks for the recipe!

I followed this recipe exactly -- I didn't want to tweak it too much at first because I wasn't sure how it would come out -- and it was not impressive. overall, pretty bland. I used one jalapeño, and clearly I should have used two, or even three, because I could not taste it. it had no kick, which was disappointing. if I make this again (doubtful), I will add cayenne powder and probably some cumin.

Super delicious. I followed other reviewers' advice in adding tomatoes, corn, green chilis and more cream cheese. I used leftovers by layering corn tortillas, the bean mixture and cheese (3 layers, like lasagna) in a lunch-size dish for my husband the next day - he loved it.  Thanks for the recipe.

I'm giving it a 4, because it's probably better than how mine turned out.  I meant to double it, except only had one can of beans - so it was a little too cream cheesy.   I used pinto beans because I like them better than black, and added salsa, the baked with jack cheese on top for a few minutes.  I'm going to try this one again with the right proportion of beans.

This recipe as is, is ok but I think it is a little flat.  To solve this problem add a half lime as your cooking the veggies, add the other half when you add beans.  Sometimes I'll add about a 1/3 cup of salsa verde. I prefer habernero pepper over the jalapeno.

I found nothing special about the recipe unfortunately. I was really excited to try it out but it turned out very bland. I think black beans are heavy and with the cream cheese it needed something to cut through the heavy, dark flavor--possibly tomato-based (canned tomatoes with lime juice maybe?) and a spanish rice inside??

This was a hit with the kids (8 and 10 yrs old) and are going through "We want to be vegetarians" phase.  LOL! I took a suggestion from another poster and added a can of corn.  If I were to make it for adults only, the only thing I would change is to make it spicier.

Excellent as is.  The 2nd time we made these we added 1lb of seasoned ground beef and spanish rice. There was enough for a family of four and four burritos for the freezer. They reheat well.  Thanks

this was pretty good...I used green onions because that was what I had on hand. I think the burrito would be better with rice or something else in addition to the bean mixture? Good flavor though!

5 stars alone for the simplicity of this dish.  Like others said, there are plenty of variations to make it your own -- can't seem to go wrong with this simple recipe base.

Very quick and easy.  You can add whatever you want to it and it will taste good. I added a southwest seasoning I had.  And I did notice it a bit dry so I added a little water one time and wine the second time. Tasted good.  A keeper.

AWESOME! I sauteed a chicken breast in 1 Tablespoon of butter and Frank's Red Hot (wing sauce), added that to the burrito along with some salsa and it was amazing! This was very easy and tasted great. Entire meal from start to finish took 15 minutes.

This seemed like a great idean for a quick and fairly healthy dinner or lunch, but while it tasted pretty good, it turned out very dry.  I might try again and add some salsa to the mix.

This was absolutely terrific!!!  My family is trying more "non-meat" dishes, and this was a definite hit.  My four year old loved it too!!!  Thanks so much for the recipe.  Oh, the filling is also very good as a dip with the "hint of lime" tortilla chips.  Yum.

I try not to rate recipes that I have changed and added too because its not really all that fair to the original.  That being said, I feel like the review on this one is okay because it shows the versitility of the recipe.  I used pinto instead of black beans purely for preffrence.  A chipotle (WAY to much but I like it spicey) instead of jalapeno and no grean pepper.  I used a potato masher on about half of the filling and tossed it in a tortilla.    It was FANTASTIC!  So easy.  So good. So cheap!  Its a winner.

These are the best! I added a bit more cream cheese (fat free),about a tablespoon of sour cream and some tomatos. Such a great recipe because you can really add whatever you want to it. This will definatly become a staple.

I gave this a 4 because I had to add some things for my family's tastes.  I added cumin, cayenne, rice, and served with lime wedges.  I reduced the cream cheese a little.  After those changes, I thought they were very very good for such a simple recipe.  I used "ready to cook" tortillas, which I prefer over "regular" flour tortillas.

MMMMMMmmmmm... I made the filling last night before going to bed, and this morning after church I came home and reheated it. I assembled the burritos and added cheese. Everyone liked it! I also added some corn and a tablespoon sour cream to reheat. Very good. My 11 yr old daughter asked if it was easy to make because she wants to eat it more often!!

My husband and I really enjoyed these. Go ahead and make a double recipe if cooking for more than two.A good basis to which to add additional favorite ingredients like black olives, guacamole, etc. I made exactly like the recipe said, but used non-fat cream cheese and added some salsa before rolling up the whole wheat tortillas. Good recipe. Thanks.

These were very easy to make and had great flavor. I did add 1/2 teaspoon each of cumin and chipotle chile pepper. I will make this again.

Delish. this made a super quick and healthy meal after a late soccer practice one night. Both boys scarfed the burrittos down and asked for more!!
We stayed with the recipe, and added shredded jack cheese and chopped avocados. I will definately be making these again!!!

So good that after eating them for dinner last night I made another batch for lunch today. I use fat free cream cheese and it still tastes fantastic.  I don't like jalapenos or peppers, so I make 1/2 the recipe without those and add salsa con queso and chicken instead, which was delicious.  My mom said the 1/2 with the peppers and jalapenos was great.  My 2 year old nephew loved it as well.

5++++ omigod good! I diced tomatoes, onions, jalapenos, cilantro & red peppers mixed with rice vinegar/lime juice and served on top of the burritos with sour cream. Whole family enjoyed. Might try some steak or chicken in it next time... but original recipe is delish!

Loved it!  Will definitely be a staple in our house.  I modified slightly for our taste and what I had on hand.

I did add some leftover taco meat and drizzled with picante sauce.  Also increased cream cheese, but next time might add half cream cheese and half sour cream.  Diced tomatoes might be a good addition, too.

One other tip, I buy frozen "stir fry" mix (tri colored peppers and onions) and use this in almost all my recipes that use onions and peppers.  I hate chopping onion and fresh peppers would spoil before I used them.  Way cheaper too!

Great recipe.  Followed others suggestions and added canned green chillies and tomatoes.  It was delicious.  I think I'll double the jalapenos next time, I like a little more zing in my burritos.

This was surprisingly good and we will make it again. Reading reviews about dryness, I added a can of corn and diced chiles, both with the juices, and half cup of chunky salsa. I also added 3 cloves of garlic and cumin as we like spice. I did not add the salt other than a dash of Lawry's - a half teaspoon would have been way too much.  Served it on small whole wheat tortillas with a bit of cheddar and lettuce folded like a taco. With my additions this will serve 4 people easily.

Delicious, I added in shredded chicken and some cumin, cayenne pepper and canned tomatoes. 

I will definitely be making this again, only thing I would do differently next time is add little to no salt as the canned beans and tomatoes seemed to have enough as they were for the meal

Made these tonight.  They were delicious.  I used lite cream cheese, and substituted green chilis for the jalapenos.  Left out the onions and bell peppers.  I also added chicken.  I've added this to our favorites.

This recipe arrived in my in box today and I decided to try it.  I had all the ingredients on hand except cilantro.  I followed the recipe and tasted it before serving.  For my taste, it definitely needed more kick (especially missing cilantro) so I added a good shake of cumin and 2Tbs hot green salsa. The cream cheese is a good addition (in lieu of sour cream) but when I make it again I will cut back to 2 oz of cream cheese

Made this Today....It was fabulous - my neighbor loved it too.  I used yellow pepper and don't know what a "small onion" would look like, I just used a couple slices of a big onion diced up.
Great recipe thanks

I love this filling.  It's not really Mexican or even Tex-Mex, but it's creamy and tasty and very, very filling.  If I have a few minutes extra time before serving, I plate the burritos and sprinkle a little cheese on top and slip them in a 350 oven for about five minutes.

This recipe was alright, but I wasn't sure whether to use fresh or canned jalepenos-I used fresh and that was all I could taste in the filling.  I think the recipe has a lot of potential-I just have to adjust it to my tastes. I think next time I will add monterey jack cheese to the filling, more cream cheese and use diced green chiles, because I love their flavor.  Thank you so much for submitting it-  it was a great starting point in my search for a tasty vegetarian burrito filling!

This will become a regular meal in my family. I did double the recipe and took many of the additional recommendations (esp. diced tomatoes!!) the recommendation for a full packet of cream cheese might have been a bit excessive, but it made for a rich meal and several chips and dip type snacks to follow.

I give this recipe 5 stars WITH some spices added. I added about a teaspoon of cumin and cayenne, and a 1/2 T of chili powder. I also added another t of minced jalapenos, as well as mushrooms, which worked really well. Definitely serve salsa or diced tomatoes on the side with this one, though sour cream is not necessary. I made Mexican rice II and we just did 8" tortillas. Great with Tabasco jalapeno (green) hot sauce.

i dont usually rate so low, but i had to change alot of this recipe to make it tast good! one night i made the vegitarian version, the next night i just added a shredded chicken breast that i boiled in some s&p, cumin, season salt, fresh garlic and onion.

heres what i did differently:
 i doubled the recipe! 1/2 t. cumin and 1/2 t. chili powder, a can of diced green chiles, 2/3 c. frozen corn kernels, 8 oz. cream cheese, a can of Rotel diced tomatos and green chiles and upped the garlic to 3 t. i also used yellow and red bell peppers and mixed in some lipton spanish rice that i cooked on the stove. with these changes it was delicious!

I considered this a base recipe and loved it with the additions of 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp chili powder, and a couple of fresh garden tomatoes, peeled and chopped added just before the beans. Did not measure salt exactly but it was more than called for. I can see where corn or mexican rice would have been nice additions, but I didn't have any.

These turned out great, I love cream cheese and the combination with the peppers and onions tasted great, I added diced green chiles as well and that was a nice touch.  I didn't have black beans so just made my burritos layered with the cream cheese veggie mix, refried beans, cheese adnd garnished with sour cream, cilantro and avacado.  Nice change from the usual bean and cheese burrito I mae.

Not the best burritos I've ever had. I think that the problem is the cream cheese, which makes the bean mixture dry and pasty. I think the burritos would have tasted better with sour cream instead.

WOW! I can't believe how good these are! The recipe scared me a little so I almost didn't try it. My 6 and 5 year old girls liked them too. I was planning on saving some for my hubby but I can't, these are just too good! I made the recipe exactly how it was written. As always you can change it to your likeing!

OMG...These were awesome!!!!! With over 400 good reviews I KNEW it had to be a winner!!!I love black beans and the taste of that fresh cilantro made it over the top!!!I have go to find a market that had fresh cilantro year round because these are gonna be on my menu ALOT!I followed the recipe as stated...always do to start with buy found it needed nothing! I even ate one for a quick breakfast one morning...it was fabulous and I wasnt hungry at my 10:00 break. I dipped the end in sour cream too and that makes it even better if that is possible. WOW what an inexpensive, easy, enjoyable meal. All you vegetarians out there...you have GOT to make these. I make a big bowl of the filling now and eat it all week.It would get more than 5 stars from me. TRY THEM!!

This is a really good recipe, though I found I like it better without the bell pepper, substituted with 1 cup mixed diced tomato and corn. Its nutritional value is suspect, but non-fat cream cheese and drained+washed canned beans helps out a little.

This recipe is MUCH larger than two servings.  I did read some other reviews and decided to add some cumin, diced chiles, and canned corn.  But still really yummy!

Very tasty.  Didn't have cilantro or jalepeno, but they still turned out great.  After tasting the end product, I decided to add a bit of seasoning...ie.)cumin, garlic powder, chili powder.  Will make again.

This recipe is terrific! I doubled the recipe and added a little bit of shredded boiled chicken that needed to be used up. I ended up needing 2 more ounces of cream cheese. These burritos are great for something different!

These were SO good!  I followed the recipe for the most part but left out the red pepper, used canned jalapeño peppers, added in some chili pepper & cumin & used whole wheat tortillas.  

The onions had such a great texture to them...not too crunchy yet not soggy either.  Another time saving tip is to wrap your tortillas in damp paper towels and microwave for about a minute instead of using the oven.  They come out just great that way!

Overall super recipe and one I'll be making again!  Great for when time is short!  Thanks!

Very delicious, easy, & quick. Great meal to make coming home late from work. I do like it a bit more spicy though and add some hot sauce before the cream cheese.

Absolutely delicious!  I wish I could have tried it with jalepenos, but my boyfriend is very spice sensitive.  I substituted some milder-spiced sweet chiles, but other than that followed the recipe exactly.  Could have done with heartier portions - wished I had leftovers.  Still, it's a great recipe.

I thought this was very good and easy to make - very filling!  I added some left over chicken breast, but it wasn't necessary.   I omitted the peppers (don't care for them) and added salsa.  My husband loved it too, and he is a picky eater!!!  Will keep this one in the rotation!

We loved this. I had to use jarred jalepenos, but it still turned out fab. The burritos are filling b/c they are so rich.

I'm giving this 3 stars because as written I think the recipe is a little bland and the cream cheese is way too heavy.  I added a dozen shakes of cayenne pepper which gave it some zip, but I could hardly eat 1/2 a burrito because it was just too creamy and cheesy tasting.  I might make these again and add additional ingredients to try and even out the heaviness of the cheese and also add some additional flavor.

These were ok.  I added a tomato and used 4 oz cream cheese instead of 3, but it didn't have a lot of flavor.  I think some cheddar cheese and a little more jalapeno would make it more flavorful.

These were ok. I added chicken and tomatos, the tomatos were an improvement but still wasn't anything great. I would not care to make this again. A good thing about it was they were quick and easy to make.

I gave this 5 stars because I added inside the burrito "Mexican Rice II".  I think if it were only the beans I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much.  The only changes were that I added diced tomatoes and I left out the cilantro.  But the rice and beans together made this an extremely tasty meal.

Just yummy!!! I added 8oz of cream cheese and fresh mushrooms too. Didnt add the jalapenos. I stuffed the Burritos and then topped with Sharp cheddar and broiled till the cheese was melted and the tops were crunchy. Perfect recipe!!

this is a GREAT quick recipe... so tasty, even my 2 year-old loves this one.  one reccomendation, if you're trying to go low fat, don't use fat-free cream cheese... it's sticky and gross.  1/3 less fat cream cheese works fine.

Mmm... love the blend of flavors going on here.  I did find this to be a bit dry, but I'm wondering if I might have cooked everything on too high of a setting.  Will certainly try this again with the suggestions posted by other reviewers. I did add seasoned salt and cumin to rev this up a bit.  One things for sure... you gotta have the fresh cilantro!  Thanks for posting!

Awesome! My family loved these tasty burritos. The meat was not at all missed and it made for a nice change of pace. I used pickled jalapeno slices (chopped) instead of a fresh one. I also mixed in some yellow and orange peppers along with the red one to make it more colorful (after tripling the recipe to feed my brood). Yummy!

These burritos are really delicious.  I add some cooked white rice and spicy salsa to the mixture for more flavor.  I also sprinkle some cheese inside the tortilla before I roll them up.

Pretty good black bean burritos, with modifications.  As written, they would be a bit bland.  I added cumin, chili powder, and 1/4 cup of salsa.  I might try to corn next time.  Don't get me wrong, they were quite good.  They just needed something more to add some punch to the meal.

These are everything I look for in a family meal--quick, tasty, inexpensive, and nutrious.  To make this go a little farther, I add 1 cup frozen corn and 1 cup salsa.  I also used whole wheat tortillas.  We make these again and again.  YUMMY!

I love these!  It makes plenty, and I freeze the extras for meals when I don't feel like cooking.  I added 1 t cumin, 1 t chili powder, rotel.  I used 12 oz cream cheese (I wasn't sure what 1/4 lb was so I looked it up.)  I have made this many times.

My favorite thing about this delicious recipe is the leftovers the next day...I like to dip tortilla chips into the mixture and eat it like queso.  YUM!!!!  (Burritos are great too, and we also like to make them as quesadillas!)  :)

So good and very easy.  I usually make a bunch and indivually wrap them for easy lunches.  I sometimes add some homemade salsa to the mix before stuffing the burritos, too.

I thought, "How amazing could burritos taste?" But these were great! Somehow I forgot the garlic and I couldn't find fresh cilantro at the store but even then I wanted to eat my husband's portion, too. You can easily add salsa, rice, etc to taste. This is absolutely going into our meal rotation.

This was good!  I followed exact directions except that I added a can of Rotel diced tomatoes and I added salsa in the burrito.  Would also be good as a dip with tortilla chips.  Next time I want to add Mexi-rice to it too.  Thanks!

These were unbelievable!  I would never of thought of using cream cheese!  I did add a can of tomatoes with green chiles and a can of corn just for our preference, but it would of been good regardless.  I'll definitely be making these again.

This was the best burrito recipe I have ever used. For my family I had to make a few changes though, mostly increasing the amount. I used a package of 10 Flour tortillas, 1 Medium onion, 1 whole red pepper thinly sliced, 4 cloves of fresh garlic sliced, 2 cans of black beans, whole package of philadelphia cream cheese, cracked black pepper, left out the cilantro, added in Taco sauce on top and sharp cheddar cheese. Thanks for such a fantastic recipe, my family loves it!

I thought they were a little bland and a bit too cheesy, although this may suit some people's tastes.  Next time I would use less cream cheese and add more spices such as cumin and chili pepper.

Awesome! These are my favorite burritos. I had to do them a little differently though. As soon as I finished making them I tipped the bowl and lost every bit of it. haha so starting over I had to make them without the cream cheese. I also replaced the red pepper and onion with 1/4th of a bag of frozen peppers and onions and the minced jalapenos with minced chili peppers because it's impossible to find minced jalapenos where I live. I made up for the cream cheese with white cheese sauce and poured medium salsa over the finished product and it turned out great.

I found the burritos to be a bit bland, so I recommend adding spices such as chili, cumin and ground red pepper to the black bean mixture. Then to add extra flavour, spoon on the top of the rolled burritos, PC Lime and Chili salsa. As a side dish, make mexican corn on the cob (elote).

Excellent, healthy, and easy to make.  Watch the cilantro.  The first time I added to much. Try blending mixture with hand blender first - makes them pasty like authentic ones. Also I use more low fat cream cheese as I don't find it calls for enough.  It helps make them thicker and creamier.

Great recipe! Although I'm vegetarian, the rest of my family isn't - so I added chicken (fried in olive oil with a sprinkle of curry) to theirs. I tripled the mix to feed seven by using three cans of black beans, 8 oz cream cheese, one can Ro-tel, and three times the veggies and spices. I did drop in a handful of colby and jack, but I don't think I needed to. Served with pico de gallo (from this site) and tortilla chips. Great dinner!

I would give this 5 stars but I made some changes.  I added a can of diced tomatoes with chilli, frozen corn, chilli powder and chedder cheese before I rolled them up.  I really just followed Tina's review because I liked the sound of the changes she made!  They were so good and easy!

These were quite good! I used 3 cloves of garlic. I think I also sauteed a bit longer than the recipe called for. I also added some chopped tomato and I might add a can of Rotel tomatoes with chilis next time.

These should be renamed Deliciously EASY Black Bean Burritos!! So simple to make and so yummy. I omitted the jalapeno, just to make it easier since I don't normally have them on hand and added a shake of cumin. The cream cheese really makes the filling! Definitely a keeper!

Awesome!  We loved these.  I made them as is for myself and for my meat eating husband, I fried up some lean ground beef and added a can of refried beans to it, along with some spices to kick it up a bit.  Then assembled it with the black bean mixture.  I absolutely loved it and will definitely make it again.  Thanks.

These are great! My picky carnivorous SO and teenagers even liked them.
I did make some changes. I doubled the recipe, used a ton of cayenne pepper instead of jalapenos, and used 3 cloves of garlic. Added chopped tomatoes, chili powder and cumin. I also added monterey jack cheese on top of the black bean mixture as I was rolling them up.
Next time I may add corn too!

This is a basic staple in our house because it tastes so good, it's healthy, and it's packed with veggies.  Delish.  I have added grilled chicken before but this is great even without meat.  This is great because you can really add what you want to it.  If you like corn, add corn.  I've made this many different ways and my favorite is the original, though I heat the tortillas up in the microwave and usually add more cilantro because it tastes SO good.  Thank you for providing me with one of my favorite recipes ever!

I love black bean burritos and I love this recipe.  Just don't put extra cream cheese and it's spectacular!

These were good.  I had to make a few changes to make them a little bit more interesting...  I added more onions and garlic than called for, increased the salt and pepper (I used pepper instead of jalepenos cuz of the kids) and sprinkled in some chili powder.  Then I stirred in some salsa and some rice (brown rice cooked in chicken stock with a few spoonfuls of salsa in it) before rolling them.  We enjoyed them with these modifications -they were pretty bland before my changes. Though I did leave out the jalepenos, which would certainly have given the dish a little kick, so I can't really complain.

This was really good!  I added 1 tsp cumin and topped with salsa.  I think next time I might mix the salsa into the mixture in the skillet.  Also used green chilis instead of jalapeno.

A bit bland.  Added some cajun seasoning and apple cider vinegar.  Still needs something...will make again and continue to play with it.

I left cilantro to the side for those who wanted it. Even though everyone really liked these, the cilantro eaters liked them the most. Liked the cream cheese idea alot, and will use it in other burros.

I thought these were really good.  I added some monterey jack cheese and some cheddar cheese on top, and served w/ some taco sauce.  My husband who is NOT a vegetarian loved these.  Make sure that if you're not a big cilantro fan that you finely chop it!

This was a very good burrito.  The name says it all with DELICIOUS!  Something about it just wasn't quite five stars but that may have been the torillas we used.  We will keep this recipe.

The burritos were pretty good. I didn't put in cilantro though but it turned out fine. Also, I crushed the beans after it was cooked. Very easy to make and can be put in the fridge to heat up and eat later.

This was good, however, I think adding a jar of salsa and using this as a dip for tortilla chips vs. a burrito filler would be better.

A very yummy, yet simple black bean burrito recipe, and easy to modify! I've made this 2 times, the first I followed it except omitted the jalapenos and added cayenne pepper like another reviewer suggested, and used garlic & onion powder instead of fresh since that's what I had on hand. The second time I used the powders again, substituted green bell pepper for red, and omitted the cream cheese instead adding about 1/2 c sour cream at the end, both times the burritos turned out delicious! Also, to save time I nuked the tortillas.

My nine-year-old daughter would have said she didn't like anything in this recipe but the tortilla - however mixed all together she ate her whole large burrito.  I used a whole red pepper and a lot of cilantro because I love them, and left out the jalepeno.  Very easy to make.

Excellent!  I added baked, shredded, seasoned (store packet) chicken and a bit more cream cheese and it was great.  Also made a box of Spanish rice that we ended up putting inside that made it even better.  Could have used more beans, though, after all my additions, but picky husband said I could make it as often as I like!

Very easy to make.  I did not have fresh or dry cilantro on hand--this flavor would have completed the dish, but it was still good without.  Lime might also be a nice flavor to add.

Incredibly quick and easy to make. Completely fills me up with enough left-overs for lunch. Changes: I use whole wheat tortillas, no cream cheese, though I do add sour cream after its done, and add a mix of mexican cheeses. I also throw in lots of fajita style seasonings (cumin, cilantro, etc).

MMM MMM Good! I also threw in canned chopped tomatoes with jalapeno pieces and used a Southwestern salsa on top that had corn in it. These were so easy and fast to make...and a total hit!!!! I will be making them again soon!

These were better than restaurant bean burritos!  The mixture is only for 2 and doesn't make a lot so I recommend doubling it!

Good recipe. Might use more black beans next time. I also added shredded Monterey Jack cheese on top of the bean mixture before folding up the tortilla.

This recipe was fantastic!  I read others reviews and also added canned tomatoes, cumin and corn.  The tomatoes keep it moist.

This recipe was awesome. I use only four and five star recipes because I don't want to waste my time and money. 

This will definitely be a keeper. In the future, I will use a little less cheese, more cilantro and beans, and add some other type of meat, like ground round.  This recipe is healthy and fresh, and most important... easy. Thanks Jessie for posting it.

I added chopped carrot, chili powder, cayenne, cumin and nonsalt seasoning to the mix, then put shredded Colby Jack and lettuce in my burritos, and ate them with sour cream!  Yummy!  I accidentally left out the jalapenos (which I purchased specifically for this recipe---oops) and they were still wonderful.  Quick and easy too.  I made two large burritos and still have enough black bean concoction for probably another three...Very filling.  Great for a quick lunch!

Makes tasty, quick burritos. I changed up a few ingredients to use what I had on hand.  I added a can of organic refried black beans in addition to the black beans, and used cream cheese with chives.  Also added some green chiles.  Good burrito, but you gotta add sour cream and salsa on top for that little extra.  Gave 5 stars because I will make it again. Healthy, filling, quick.

This is an excellent recipe.  My preference is to add a little more jalapeno, and a little less cream cheese.  Though, it is very good as is.  My finace cooks lunch once a week for the local rotary club, and after trying this at home he made it for them.  It was a big hit!

I've made this countless times over the last two years, and I am just now rating this! This is an excellent recipe and everyone should try it. I usually use fat free or neufchatel cream cheese to lower the calories, but it's still fantastic!

Yummy. Inexpensive, quick and easy to throw together. My boyfriend liked it as well. Thinking about adding tomato into the burrito for next time and/or chicken. I put a few extra jalepenos in burrito cuz i like it spicy and I didn't use alot of salt. 2 or 3 shake from the salt shaker. Good receipe as is but definitely room to play around for variation

These were great, but they did get a little dry.  I added a little cumin and next time I will try adding a little lime juice.  We will definately make these again.

Great burritos! I rounded out the flavor a little bit by adding a dash of chili powder, cumin, and a chopped chipotle pepper in abodo sauce. Also, I baked them for 15 minutes in the oven at 350 degrees.  Delicious!

This turned out really well. I divide the bean mixture into 2 parts and put salsa in one and cream chese in the other (as the cream cheese becomes too dry).

Really, really tasty! The extra bonus is that it is easy and fast. I've used reduced fat cream cheese, and have added rice, corn and chopped tomatoes to this recipe as well, but it's also wonderful as is. Thanks for submitting a recipe for a great, simple and nutritious meal!

Very good, very simple, very fast recipe to make. My changes:  replaced the cream cheese with sour cream; no jalapenos; added 1/4 packet spicy taco seasoning; added 1/2 cup enchilada sauce; sprinkled shredded cheddar cheese & salsa on top.

Very tasty, a little on the dry (stick to the roof of your mouth) side, but its nothing that a little extra salsa can't fix!  You will definitely want to double (at least!) this recipe.  My husband could eat the 2 servings on his own and still be combing the kitchen for more!

These were ok but nothing to rave about. If I was to make them again....they are in much need of several different spices as they tasted bland. I added about a half cup of corn to the bean mixture and I also made spanish rice. I did not use large tortillas but small (taco) size tortillas. We put the mixture together with the rice and had a side of salsa but like I said....nothing to rave about on this one....sorry  :(

I had everything except cream cheese(sub green bell for red). Though I knew the cream cheese would probably counteract the dark flavor of the beans, i went w/o it anyways. Also, since I was going dark flavor I added a chopped chipotle. Overall, I got a dark, rough flavor but I think the bean was too overpowering. I think i'll add more jalepeno and chipotles next time. Tried it two ways, first burrito plain, and second I melted some shredded cheddar. It helped tone down the beans, but wasn't a good cheese complement for the flavor.

Very good recipe.  My husband and I both enjoyed it.  I'm not a cream cheese fan so I used pepperjack cheese instead.  It gave it a very spicy taste.

The bean mixture is delicious -- would probably even be good on tortilla chips.  I made the mistake, though, of wrapping the burritos and then keeping them warm in the oven until the rest of the dinner was ready, which dried them out too much.  Maybe if you had a sauce to put over the top?  Otherwise, this is a good recipe.
