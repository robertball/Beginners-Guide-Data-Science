Needed a little more moisture added, but very delisious!The crust on the meat was wonderful--I followed a suggestion from the chef.

Really good! I cooked the garlic in with the beef which was probably a bad idea. I thought I could save time. But I did saut√© some squash in the leftover sauce, and it was amazing! Also, used some of the remaining sauce on the beef. Definitely add the sauce later! But the taste was yummy!

I can't believe how gaga my husband went over this meal. It was good for sure, but he said it rivaled his absolute favorite meals. Served it with a quinoa/orzo side mix, and a broccoli slaw with an Asian dressing. This meal came together so fast, it's a kick  recipe for a weekday night for a family.  Used low sodium Adobo and it was still great.  I need to print this out before I lose it - I hesitate to think how upset my hubby will be if I do! :)

We usually grill steak, so I followed all the tips in this recipe and really appreciated the footnotes. I usually don't season my steak with anything more than salt, but my husband especially really liked them cooked this way. I have made filets following this recipe a couple times now and I really like it, thanks for sharing!

I have to admit, we were pleasantly surprised by these steaks!  I was in "blackening" mode and was afraid I'd overseasoned them w/GOYA Adobo (minus pepper because I hate black pepper).  I scraped a bit off and they were fine.  We opted to grill the steaks, rather than pan fry because, well, just because.  I recognized the importance of butter and warmed the butter/EVOO/garlic/parsley and added to the top of the steaks as they rested.  Delicious.  We have filets in the freezer w/this recipe's name all over them....  THANKS, GOYA!

These were a hit in my house! I have already been asked to make them again, I rough chopped the garlic and added red pepper per request from my DH, but otherwise made exactly as stated - delicious!

loved the flavor on the steak and to be honest, we could've eaten the topping straight-up, with a spoon!  served with green beans, but thinking next time a tomato-avocado salad with a lemony dressing to add a tangy compliment.

This was the best steak I have ever made! Loved the crust on the outside, but it was melt in your mouth tender on the inside. I let the seasoning sit on the steak for about an hour before cooking it. Thank you for the recipe!

The first time I've been able to prepare a tenderloin stovetop to medium rare and I loved it!  Followed recipe except used butter only.  Great crust and flavor. Definitely will make again!

I had a container of Adobe seasoning never being used, so this was a nice recipe to try it on.  Excellent results and so easy.  Use the cooking times as estimates only, since it really depends on the thickness of the tenderloin, your cooking method, and cooking temperature.  My tenderloins were about 1 inch in thickness and required much less than 6 minutes per side.   You want to cook them medium rare.  I used a cast iron skillet which is superb for tenderloins and steak in general.

This one is my all time favorite. I however only use salt and pepper (course) rather than the seasoning noted. It's all about the meat but I like using this recipe to get a nice crust.
