I don't think this is a well-written recipe. It doesn't tell you whether or not to drain the corn (I drained and used some of the liquid, but not all) or when to add the pepper. It tells you to mix the dry ingredients into the sauteed veggies "...until the mixture is bubbling..." At this point, the mixture won't bubble, as there's not enough liquid in there. Next, if you add the egg into the mixture without tempering, you'll have scrambled eggs. It doesn't tell you to "spray" the casserole dish, so you'll most likely end up with a dish that has baked-on corn. And four servings is more realistic than six. Sorry, my intent is not to be super critical, but I think the author assumes that anybody preparing this recipe would know to do all of these things, forgetting that there are many beginning cooks on this site. And I also have to say that I think AR editing could have done a better job. Before pouring the corn mixture into the casserole, I tasted it and felt there was too much salt, it tasted like I'd used creamed corn instead of whole corn, and that it was pretty bland.  At this point, I did add some shredded cheddar cheese, but that was the only deviation from the recipe. I know I'm the first reviewer of this recipe, and I don't want to discourage others from trying it. Taste always is subjective, and these are just my personal opinions. Sorry, BARELYBARBIE, I rarely do 2-star reviews, but this one just didn't work for us.

As written, I'm giving this 3 stars, but mostly because we all missed the creaminess that you get using creamed corn.   Unlike the other reviewer, I wasn't confused by the recipe and would never think of not draining corn unless that was specified in the recipe.    The taste was excellent.   I've not given up on this recipe, but am going to pursue a way of making it creamier.

Flavor-wise, it is great. It was a little dry so I think next time, I will use a can of cream corn & a can of kernel corn. (I doubled the recipe.) I also changed the bell pepper to celery & used butter flavored crackers.

I was looking for a recipe that did NOT use cream-style corn, and this was it.  I'm not a big fan of green peppers, so I used pimiento instead.  I also used Italian bread crumbs.  When I sauteed the onion and pimiento, I added about 2 teaspoons of water before putting the evaporated milk and flour in.  It turned out great!
