My family is picky to say the least and this was the first thing I have ever made that everyone went back for seconds on. I only made two small changes to cut back on the sweetness. I substituted Jim Beam for the Southern Comfort and I substituted chicken stock for the fruit juice during the thicken stage at the very end. All in all this recipe is great!

Very good. I didn't use soy sauce and didn't have enough brown sugar, so I substituted a cup of brown sugar and 2 tbsp of molasses. The sauce was pretty sweet, but I also didn't have crushed red pepper flakes. Some spicy Mrs. Dash at the end didn't punch it up enough, but I am sure some spice will cut the sweetness nicely. My own personal twist: with about 5 minutes of cook time left, I diced a peach into fairly large chunks and threw them in. They came out soft and delicious. Served over rice.

Excellent!  Like many of the other reviews, I substituted chicken stock for the juice.  I didn't have minced onion so I put in about half a chopped onion.  The other thing I did was just to throw all of the ingredients in the crockpot, except the cornstarch.  When the chicken pieces were cooked, I took them out temporarily and whisked in the corn starch. Then I added the chicken back in and let it simmer for a few hours more.  I think that cooking it in the crockpot keeps the chicken moist.  So easy and I normally keep all the ingredients on hand.

Very good but definitely too sweet. And I only used 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Next time I'll use chicken broth instead of fruit juice.

This recipe is fantastic. I was unable to find the exact juice combination on the recpe so I used an apple/cranberry juice. I have made this recipe twice the first time with chicken breasts and felt the chicken got too dry. The second time I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and that made the recipe!

There is a reason this is called "Best". It is!!!! Easy to follow directions and the chicken is not breaded! I did take the advice of others and omitted the juice altogether. I used the same measurement but used chicken broth! My entire family loved this! This will easily be in the rotation at my house! Thanks for such a great recipe!!!!

The flavoring of the sauce was excellent however I would recommend using skinless thighs since the white meat got too dry.

I substituted chicken broth for the apple-grape-cherry juice right off the bat... and it seemed plenty sweet to me. I also used boneless skinless chicken thighs and it came out tasting just like the Bourbon chicken at the mall! Used Jack Daniels instead of Southern Comfort because that's what we had. After letting the chicken chunks simmer in the sauce for 20 minutes I took out the chicken and cranked up the heat to med-high and boiled for a few minutes to help cook off some of the alcohol smell and reduce the sauce even more before whisking in the slurry mixture. In the future I may also reduce the amount of soy sauce. But overall this recipe with the changes was fantastic. Definitely a keeper!

This was an excellent recipe! My husband and children loved it and have asked for it several times since finding the recipe. I was unable to locate the apple/grape/cherry juice so I just used regular old apple juice and it was phenomenal!

Very good Recipe. I used chicken thighs in place of breast. I seasoned the chicken with 1 teaspoon of creole seasoning and cajun seasoning each. I added 1/2 cup of cooking wine to the chicken after it browned and let it cook for additional 5 minutes.

My entire family like this dish two of them are the pickyest of eaters. I did make a few changes based on the fact I wanted a dish more like at the food court and I didn't have all ingredients on had. To start with I used 1/2 inch pieces of chicken to decrease cooking time. Before browning the chicken I tossed the pieces in a 50/50 mixture of corn starch and AP flour. You do need a bit more oil when browning (u used veg oil with a couple tbs of sesame oil to add that real oriental flavor) I did it in three seperate batches so as not to crowd my pot. You'll have some nice brown bits on the bottom to add to the flavor of your sauce. Instead of the fruit juice I used juice from one can of fruit coctail and another can of peaches and about 1/2 cup of grape jelly. I put in 4 diced scallions for added onion flavor. I also used dark brown sugar and a full tsp of ginger and 2 tbs of serachi sauce. Make sure to scape the bottom to get those browned bits up that will help thicken your sauce(you will still need to corn starch to thicken a bit). I seved with home made fried rice....will be making this agian.

Argh. Did not care for this. Too salty too sweet too garlicky too SOMETHING. My kids and husband ate it but I did not enjoy it. I had to keep mixing more rice with mine to dilute the flavor. Nothing like bourbon chicken in the food court... I followed the recipe to a T.

Absolutly fabulous!! I made this for my family with the bourbon slush drink since I had leftover bourbon. As for the receipe I followed it to a tee except that I used cranapple juice instead of the apple-grape-cherry juice. We eat it with pork fried rice and spring rolls from our favorite chinese restuarant.

Excellent flavor. It didn't start out with a sweet smell more of a soy sauce smell but let me tell you it sweetened up perfectly. Made exactly as directed except I did not remove chicken for the thickening step I just thickened it with the chicken in the pot saving a step. Yum yum

This is awesome. It tastes like a combination Orange Chicken and Bourbon chicken. I just used plain Bourbon (Maker's Mark) and it was still great.

I would give it five but that I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I had to sub a couple of ingredients (primarily the bourbon) but it still tasted delightful and even my picky husband ate it.

This was fantastic! After reading the reviews from people who thought it was too dry, I cut the simmer time down from 20 minutes to 10 minutes and thought it turned out great.  Served it over rice and can't wait to eat the leftovers!

Delish! We have this now about once a wk. We make a lot of chicken so it was nice to find another way to prepare it. I have always used "cran-grape" juice in place of the apple-grape-cherry juice and chicken broth instead of bourbon.

Based on reviews I decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup. Other than that I made the recipe as stated. I served this with jasmine rice steamed broccoli and egg rolls. It is an easy and tasty recipe.... however I was hoping for the stuff like they sell at the mall:/ All in all not a bad recipe... I would make this again. But I will continue my hunt for the "mall-type" bourbon chicken....

I went with some of the other reviews and used chicken broth instead of juice to cut down on the sugar and I lowered the red pepper flakes to 1/4 teaspoon and we loved it. Will be making this on a regular basis. The recipe makes a lot of sauce so you can either cut it down or freeze the leftover sauce to use in sautéed chicken another night.

Overall it was good. I used half of the sugar called for and it came out too sweet. I would use a quarter of the sugar orange juice for the juice cocktail and up the vinegar to double the amount.

This was really rich and yummy. Too rich to go over rice so I put it over fresh broccoli. Be careful with the crushed pepper flakes you can add more later but I overdid it and it sort of wrecked it. The heat overpowered the flavor. I would definitely try again sometime. I was disappointed a picture I took on my iPhone would not post here. Odd pixel dimension rules.

The bourbon was a little strong in my thoughts. I am a type of person whom loves to cook with it and beers however I do not like to smell of it strong. Baked in the oven on 350 for about 3 hours and the sauce thickens as it cooks but you can still smell the bourbon.

Great. Used a berry-blend juice for this chicken. I was amazed at how good it was. The chicken unfortunately got overcooked so I'd quicken the sauce time and definitely keep an eye on that.

I only used 2lbs of chicken instead of 3 (we like things fairly saucy so I left the sauce ingredients as written). We all realllly liked this dish. It was a little on the "hot" side for me (just barely - self proclaimed spice wimp here) - and just right for my sister. Will definitely make again. Served this over pecan rice and it was perfect together.

My 3 teenage boys and husband thoroughly enjoyed this - I used a whole cut up chicken plus a package of thighs and doubled the ingredients. I only had orange juice on hand and I think that would only alter the flavour slightly. I will be making this again but adding more heat to offset the sweet.

My boyfriend asked for Bourbon Chicken a year and a half ago for his birthday and this is what I fixed. I've made it about a dozen times since then following the recipe more closely sometimes than others. I think I finally got it perfect tonight! I use a 2.5 lb bag of frozen chicken defrosted in the microwave and then diced but this generates a lot of water so I cut the cup of water out entirely. I've used one packed cup of dark brown sugar before and that tasted pretty good but lately I've been sticking with the light brown sugar (which is what the recipe calls for). I only use a loose cup though maybe a third of the sugar in a packed cup. I used straight diet cherry juice and cherry SoCo too and that added an amazing rich flavor. This recipe is definitely a favorite in our house!

This dish is really good! The only thing I changed was I omit the ketchup. It is just as good as what we order at our favorite restaurant. Thanks so much for sharing!

Fantastic. I used 2 frozen packs of skinless boneless thighs... About 12-18 of them. When done doing initial cooking of chicken perhaps I had more broth than I was supposed to since I ended up with a lot of sauce. had to add more thickener (corn starch mixed in tiny bit of cold water). I also cut up some green peppers and sauteed them separately in some of the sauce then added them to it was great! Hubby said def. A keeper. Oh juice- Mott's tot juice fruit punch: look at back- its apple grape &cherry!

Delicious!!!! It was devoured in minutes. The flavor is perfect. It's sweet with a little heat. I will continue to make this one.

This was a very good dish! I took the advice from other reviewers and used reduced sodium chicken broth instead of the juice. I made a few other changes due to the ingredients I had on hand--regular bourbon instead of the liqueur 1/2 Tbsp garlic powder 1Tbsp onion powder 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper and 2 Tbsp molasses. I cooked the chicken until it was no longer pink then removed it from the skillet & set it aside. I had combined the sauce ingredients in a bowl then added it to the skillet and brought it to a boil. I cooked it at a rolling boil for about 10 minutes then added the cornstarch mixed with chicken broth and let it boil until thickened. I reduced the heat to a simmer then added the chicken to the sauce and simmered it while I finished the rest of the meal. I thought it was still a bit sweet so next time I will reduce the molasses to 1 Tbsp. I served it over quinoa with green beans and roasted cauliflower. Delicious!!

This turned out just ok. The only change I made was to replace the juice with chicken broth as I thought it would be too sweet with juice. I actually found the soy sauce flavor to be too strong which maybe the juice would have helped with. My kids wouldn't touch it. I wasn't able to get the sauce to thicken up very much either. Not likely to make this again but you never know.

This sauce was so flavorful and fun to make. How do you keep the chicken from drying out as it is set aside during the last simmer of the sauce?

Very tasty. We didn't have the fruit concentrate on hand and we don't drink so we didn't have the Bourbon either. Just left out the Bourbon and blended whole black seedless grapes with some blueberry pancake syrup and chockcherry jam. Still had a nice fruity flavor. Didn't need to use the full 3 pounds of chicken. We just used 3 large chicken breast halves and let simmer uncovered. I imagine that if you do the whole three pounds you may want to simmer covered if you like your dish more saucy (which we do). Best eaten when warm as the spicy kick is much more apparent. We have little kids and when we munched on some of their left overs (I just couldn't let it go to waste) the spicy kick was less pronounced.

This recipe was my first attempt. I didn't have the exact ingredients so I did some substituting: I used Jack Daniels bourbon rather than Southern Comfort whole berry cranberry sauce to replace the fruit juice. My family gave this a thumbs up as well as the folks in our Sunday school class.

I know it seems silly to change the recipe then give it a bunch of stars but I read the most recent ones decided that my family isn't a sweet tooth bunch so kept it mostly as is but did use Chicken broth only. The only response from the family was "Is there more?"

This was delicious and easy to make. I pretty much followed the recipe for the fruit juice I took the suggestions of others and used the juice from a canned fruit cocktail I had on hand. I reduced the brown sugar just a bit. Used boneless chicken thighs for moist juicy tender chicken. You don't need to remove the chicken on the final step to thicken the sauce it thickens quick enough. I tossed in some chopped green onions at the end. Served over a bed of fluffy rice. The cooking times were just right for chicken thighs my chicken was perfectly done. Next time I'll add in some broccoli and red bell pepper. My guys loved it.

It was pretty good. Where I live we didn't have the apple-grape-cherry juice so I substituted with Safeway's Fruit Punch concentrate. Unfortunately that didn't give it the tangy flavor I was hoping for so I am going to use apple juice next time. I also plan to add more red pepper flake and just a little chili powder as this recipe makes a great foundation for a spicy chicken dish.

The only changes I made were substituting a sweeter Canadian whiskey and as someone else suggested using thigh meat. The directions are spot on and easy to follow. The chicken was tender and flavorful. Everyone enjoyed it in my house. We will definitely be having this again.

My husband asked for bourbon chicken out of the blue. I’ve never made it before and used this recipe. I’m a vegetarian so I couldn’t taste test this at all while making it. So I followed the recipe hoping I was making it right. When my husband tried it he said it was perfect and exactly what he wanted, my son loved it too. So thanks for the recipe, it was prefect. It was pretty simple to make and that is always a bonus in my book.

This was marvelous. I didn't have any liqueur (I think several readers misinterpreted that ingredient as "liquor") nor juice so didn't use either; as suggested by other cooks I used chicken broth. It turned out great! I will definitely make again!

This recipe is to die for! My husband and I love bourbon chicken made from the little spice packets you can find in the Asian food section of Meijer. I decided to try and make homemade bourbon chicken once I saw this recipe and I am glad I did it's 10 times better! My local grocery store didn't have apple-grape-cherry juice pre-mixed so I mixed up my own! Other than that I made it just as is. Definitely a keeper recipe!

The soy sauce is overpowering in this dish and once the sauce was reduced it then became way too salty (this is also my husband's opinion who likes a heavy amount of salt). At the very least I would recommend using a low sodium soy sauce but even then I think the flavor would not be right. This did NOT taste anything like the delicious bourbon chicken at a festival or the mall. I felt like the chicken turned out dry despite being returned to the sauce and simmered together as the recipe instructed. I would look elsewhere for a bourbon chicken recipe if I were you since this one was very disappointing.

I made it exactly like the recipe. it was way too salty and the soy completely masked any bourbon flavor. if I were to try it again which is doubtful I would greatly reduce the soy sauce.

Used Straight Kentucky Bourbon. Doubled the quantity of the Bourbon...still could not get a real sense of the 'Bourbon' so I am not sure that using the Bourbon is necessary. Overall a simple and yummy quick dish. Would recommend it for a last minute easy dish if you have the ingredients. I added sliced cooked green Peppers and sliced Onions to get more bang for the Buck which was delicious on Brown Rice.

Thank you Rikster for sharing this recipe. It is a keeper. The flavor is really tasty. I looked at other recipes for this and reading them they didn't compare to this one. I am not suggesting that the recipes would have tasted bad they are most likely good. The peach flavored bourbon is what got my attention on this recipe I like peach flavors. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.

It was a little too sweet even with Honest Kids juice and 1/2 the brown sugar (and I like sweet). 2 tbsp of cornstarch gave the sauce a weird texture and flavor. I tried adding more juice and spices as I tried to cook it out but it just wouldn't recover.

Made exactly as written. Outstanding! second time around I traded the juice for chicken stock cut the red pepper flakes to 1/2 tsp. and added a bit more ketchup. That was just to our taste but the original was great. As a side note I use chicken breasts and found as other reviewers did that the meat was a bit dry. The second time I seared the breasts on each side on a well preheated surface first then cut into 1" segments before adding back in. That seemed to help a bit.

I altered this a bit otherwise would've given a 5 star. I used less oil in my frying pan that only needed a little for cooking the chicken. For the sauce I made these changes: used less about 1/4 c. less of the brown sugar used regular apple juice (not the multi fruit blend) used original Southern Comfort and didn't add the garlic or minced onion to the sauce-- instead I added some fresh chopped onion and the garlic with a little bit of the sauce and cooked a bit then added the rest of the sauce with some carrots and some broccoli then chicken back in with the sauce. Cooked 15-20 minutes and added the cornstarch with some chicken broth instead of the juice like others have done. Served with brown rice and topped with chopped scallions. This was so good will definitely make again.

Really didn't change anything I did add the juices and chicken stock which cut down the sweetness. Didn't need to use cornstarch because I used season flour and browned the chicken pieces and then everything into the crock pot. All I can say is delish!!

This was phenomenal. I forgot to pick up the Southern Comfort at the store so we did without and the sauce was so tasty 3/3 deemed this recipe should replace my old recipe I was using for Bourbon Chicken. The sauce was the perfect thickness and very flavorful. I think that letting the chicken simmer in the sauce as the sauce reduces really does a lot for this dish. Thanks for sharing.

Very good recipe my chicken came out delicious and family loved it. Small change... I used twice the amount of the chicken and used only half of the sugar and it was just the right amount.

Excellent flavor. Did it in the crock pot. Family raved about the flavor and tenderness. I used skinless chicken breasts drumsticks and thighs.

I love it. I didn't have apple-grape-cherry juice so I used some cherry drink and some apple and I used chili powder as red pepper flakes. The rest of ingredients were according to the recipe. Turned out great exactly how my family likes. Thank you for sharing

Too sweet. Nothing like the bourbon chicken you get in the malls. Tastey though not a recipe I'd make again.

A crowd pleaser. Family of 7 finicky diners loved it with not a morsel left on their plates. Used straight Bourbon but otherwise prepared as directed. Might halve the brown sugar or possibly cut back on the 2nd dose of juice and add another 1/8 cup of Bourbon but will go with the Southern Comfort the next time we prepare...

Made this with chicken broth instead of juice like other folks suggested. It turned out a little salty. Going to try low-sodium broth and soy sauce next time. Or maybe half juice half broth. My family still ate it but everyone commented on how salty it was.

Even though I reduced the brown sugar it was still way too sweet. Will reduce sugar considerably and add more bourbon just before serving next time as bourbon flavor gets lost.

I love this recipe it is actually one of my family favorites. Occasionally If I am out of apple-grape-cherry juice I will grab the apple jelly or grape jelly out of the fridge and substitute that with a little less brown sugar and it works out fine. I have made many variations of this very recipe and I have never had it turn out badly it is always good!

It was good. I made it twice this week once for dinner and once for work. Everyone seemed to really like it. I had friends at work asking for the recipe. I used Maple Bourbon.and switched apple juice to chicken broth. I would definitely recommend it especially on Fat Tuesday.

1.22.2019: Pretty good! Made as written except for tiny bit less red pepper flakes (1/2 tsp. instead of 3/4) and the juice we found was apple-cherry. Fruit juice smelled strong initially but after reducing and thickening it was not a noticeable flavor. Chicken did not really brown (3 lb. all at once was more of a boil even with 11" of surface area) but it we enjoyed the tender outside--and with that sauce it certainly didn't need browning for color. Due to kiddos underfoot I gathered and whisked all the sauce ingredients in a bowl before starting the chicken; found it did not need any whisking once it was time to add. Served it over caesar salad (like our old place at the mall) and enjoyed that. Had seconds without the salad and that was the only way I noticed a little heat. Next time would do red pepper flakes as written. Yielded about 4 c. of chicken with quite a lot of sauce left over; plenty of sauce to serve with rice if we wanted.

Really good go to bourbon chicken. I did decrease the sugar and increased the ketchup for my families tastes --- but no real need to. This sauce would be an awesome BBQ sauce. Can't wait to try it - once Wisconsin thaws out.

I made as written except didn’t have any juice so used chicken broth. Very good but will try with apple juice next time. My picky husband loved it!  I also used thighs instead of chicken breast.

I was a pretty big fan of this recipe. I added a little extra Southern Comfort and only mixed grape and apple juice but this is an enjoyable recipe to make.
