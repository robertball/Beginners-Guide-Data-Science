I'm afraid I don't see the need for putting this in a slow cooker for 6 hours. Everything is cooked and I would think that a 30 min slow simmer on top of the stove would blend the flavors perfectly.

We loved this!  I cooked all ingredients (except the rice) as directed with the beef broth and no water added.  I was afraid the rice would get "starchy" in the slow cooker all day.  Just before serving I cooked the rice in beef broth, put a scoop in each soup bowl and topped with the peas. My husband and I ate on this all week long till the leftovers were gone. Definitely a keeper!

A very good crockpot recipe. I replaced the white rice with 2 1/2 cups of cooked brown rice.

This makes an enormous amount of food - to the top of the slow cooker! I would use frozen black eyed peas next time and low sodium beef broth to cut down on the salt content.  Very filling and tasty.

I was a little concerned about this having much flavor with no spices or anything really, but it turned out amazing. I have to say I did change it up a little big. I did add one whole large green pepper. I used only two cans of beans in fear that it would be far too many beans. I added 3-4 diced garlic cloves and cooked them with the onions and beef. I also served it over rice instead of adding it to the crock pot. I don't really like my rice all soggy like that. It was amazing. I really really loved it so much. It was a nice meal for us on a cold winter night. Very hearty. I am looking forward to the leftovers.

I've changed the recipe a bit in that I don't cook the rice first, I use hot italian sausage instead of ground sirloin, and instead of diced tomatoes with green chiles I use diced tomatoes with jalepenos, plus sometimes some more for good measure.  Way to spicey for me (heat can easily be regulated), but my husband loves it.  I make up a big batch and freeze into meal size portions for him to take for lunch.  Healthier and cheaper than a meal out!  Thanks!

This was very good!  I used black beans instead of black-eyed peas and only 1 cup of rice.  We served it with sour cream.  Yum!

Sorry to break the good streak here, but I really didn't like this.  I was able to finish up the leftovers, so it's not a 1 rating, no.  But it just seemed very bland, and even though I tried to start adding things to zing it up, it just never quite made it in my book.

This was so good and so easy!  I used 2 cans of fire roasted tomatoes, and added brown rice to the bowls before serving rather than adding rice to the slow cooker.  I will definitely make this again! Thanks for sharing!

This was pretty bland and more like a soup or stew instead of chowder.

I made to take to church on New Yr's Day.  It was delicious, it made LOTS and everything was gone!  I didn't use canned black eyed peas.  I cooked the dried peas in beef broth, with an onion and ham hock.  Otherwise I followed recipe and it was AWESOME!

Delicious thick chowder. My family loved it. I just stirred in the rice dry with the rest of the ingredients. No need to cook it ahead of time. Wonderful flavors. Don't be worried the tomatoes with green chiles will be too spicy -- it's not and it gives it an awesome boost in flavor. We'll make this again and again. Oh, it does make more than 6 servings. It filled my large crockpot to the very brim.

We made this for New Year's Day and really loved it! I read some earlier reviews and decided to leave out the rice. I made homemade sweet cornbread and spooned the BEPs over that. Raves from the family! The only tips I would give are to make sure and drain the ground beef thoroughly before putting it in the slow cooker, and the BEPs stood up well to leaving the cooker on for at least 10hrs, because we ate on this all day! YUM!!!

I agree, if you are using canned beans, no need for slow cooker, especially for six hours.  
Whenever we use the slow cooker, we always start with dried beans and add the ingredients we like.

In the future, I will serve the rice separately as there was a lot of it.  I ended up using 4 cans of peas to try to offset it.  I did add Creole seasoning toward the end and most at my table added hot sauce.

I cooked this for New Years and we really liked it.   I used barley instead of rice.   It was an accident but one that turned out for the best.   I was not going to use instant rice and thought I was using long grain brown rice.   I added a crushed tomato as well as the 2 cans of tomatoes with peppers.   I also added a mixture of peppers I keep in the freezer instead of a green bell so it was a little warm but not too hot.   I served it with cornbread.    We shared with my brother and the thought the barley was good too.   All in all we all loved it.  I did pre cook the barley for 20 minutes but I won't next time I will just add more water as needed.   Thanks for an interesting recipe to add to our New Years menu.  ACE

This was great. I did keep the rice seperate, making just before serving because of personal tastes. I added some Cajun seasoning and tiny bit of chopped jalepeno for some zip. Super yummy and makes enough to share!

I didn't put this in the slow cooker and didn't think it was necessary. But I made quite a few changes of the amounts and the following ingredients: added elbow macaroni instead of rice, greek seasoning, italian seasoning. I also added more broth in place of the water. Without these changes, the recipe was bland.

We loved it! I made it during a huge Rhode Island snowstorm and it was perfect for après shoveling! It's not a "fancy" dinner, but it sure is good comfort food. There were no leftovers...sadly. We will be making this again and again. Oh, the only change I made was to add about 1.5 cups chopped celery, only because I wanted to use it up. Thanks for the taste of the south!

I was really looking forward to making this dish, was waiting for a cold night.  Made this yesterday and had for dinner.  My husband & myself both loved this.  Followed recipe to a T except used black beans and brown rice.  This makes a ton too...great for leftovers.  Thanks so much for sharing!!

I made this in my stock pot, instead of my crock pot. I used a 16 oz package of frozen black eyed peas, and tweaked to our taste.  Bacon instead of ground beef. Added some red hot sauce for extra spice...seasoned with some Cajun seasoning. This recipe was a good guide!! We really enjoyed it! The hubs had 3 bowls!! Served with some homemade cornbread and it was really nice and balanced!!

I will start by saying that I HATE black eyed pees.  But I loved this recipe, I couldn't even taste them. Instead of ground beef I used hot Jimmy Deans sausage .  I used brown and wild rice and only used a quarter to half of the can of beef broth and no additional water.   Did not put my rice in the slow cooker.

I added about a cup of smoked ham to the recipe.  I don't add the water at the end.  Like the recipe less "soupy."  Very good and always a hit.

This seemed really bland to me.  It was not a very exciting meal.

I made this as written, and though tasty, found a little hotsauce helped.  Next time, I will add some cayenne or other of my fave spices to give just a little kick.  

I did layer on some fresh spinach in the last 20 minutes of cooking til just wilted, and mixed it in just before serving.  Nice addition and the veggie is taken care of!

This was good, but could have used a little more depth of flavor.  Maybe some additional seasonings?

Blackeyed peas can sometimes be bland.  There's nothing bland about this recipe.  It's delicious.  I make it every New Year's.

I also added minced garlic and some creole seasoning because it seemed a little bland.

I added some smoked sausage, substituted one Hot Rotel for the regular (to spice it up) but didn't add the rice and served it New Year's Day for "good luck".  Everyone loved it!!!  My boyfriend even woke up for his midnight snack and had another bowl...will definitely serve this again!!!
