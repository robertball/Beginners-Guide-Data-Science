Quick and easy.  You can dip in any sauce you want.  I used Dijon mustard.

These took longer to get a good brown crisp on them and you really need a dipping sauce (a cheese one is good) to make these pop but these are really good. Perfect balance of sausage and kraut!

Made these for the first time and they were a hit!  I'm not sure what I did wrong as they didn't all stay together, but the taste was amazing and it will be made again.

Meh. Not impressed. Ate them with a horseradish mustard sauce,  it it still left something to be desired. If I ever tried something like this again, I'd make sure to mix in some bisquik and/or eggs to help bind the ingredients and give it more depth.
