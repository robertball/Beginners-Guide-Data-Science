This is a great recipe and I realize that it's a reduced sugar version of Bessy's Zesty Grilled Garlic-Herb Chicken (one of my favorites that I've made a number of times) but when converting 1/2 cup of sugar from the original recipe 1/2 cup of Splenda should be 1/4 cup.  I also eliminate the saffron and it doesn't make a difference in the recipe.  I pound the chicken down to 1/2 inch, cut the oil down to 3/4 cup, put everything into a ziploc bag and marinate it for a few hours.  The chicken gets carmelized due to the sugars, comes out moist and it's definitely zesty as the name states.  It's delicious and I usually serve it with Penne from Heaven from this site.

I substituted the splenda with 1/3 cup of brown sugar, left out the saffron because its more valuable than gold up here in Canada. To counteract the sweetnees of the sugar and honey I added the zest and juice of 1 lime, and a 1/4 cup of orange juice. I also cut the oil in 1/2. It came out amazing, moist and very tasty

This had a good flavor.  I used about 1/3 c of brown sugar, no saffron and cut back on the oil.  I'll cut the oil back even more next time, maybe 2/3 c.  Husband liked this easy dish.

This is a great recipe because of previous comments I reduced the amount of splenda and oil.  My guests can't eat things too spicy so I also reduced the red pepper, but would add more back for just my family.  I did not have saffron, but it still turned out great!  The only odd thing was that the splenda clumped up, so I heated the mixture in the microwave for 30 sec. and it smoothed it right out.  Everyone LOVED the flavor.

This was a great dish! I couldn't find saffron anywhere so I went without and it still turned out wonderfull. Also added a 1/2 tsp black pepper. Had a nice zip, but not too spicy. My kids loved it!

It was too sweet for us, although I cut Splenda in half. But I also cut cajun pepper in half. Felt like sweet herby chicken. Did not like the ansamble of herbs either(although I made a change - I used turmeric instead of shaffron-may be that was the reason). did not like the smell in the kitchen when it was cooking either.We still ate that. But no more of it. May be it is just not our type of dish. So I would not reccomend it to folks who do NOT like sweet type of chicken dishes.   i

It's great to find recipes that the kid will like. We made this and my daughter loved it. She's pretty picky too.  We also like someone earlier used brown sugar instead of splendid.  Pair this with some asparagus and peppers and you have a great meal

Made this tonight for dinner. It was fabulous.  It was a nice blend of spicy and sweet. I think people that do not like spicy food might want to reduce the cayenne just a little bit. We loved it as is though! Thanks for a great dinner!

This is the best chicken recipe I've had in a long time! I cut back on the oil a bit and only 1/4cup splenda as I find it tastes much sweeter than real sugar. Very easy to make, hard to mess up... my kind of recipe:)

I've made this 3x's in the last week 3 different ways...(we love it)  On chicken legs and thighs with reduced cayenne, 1/2 cup oil and 1/4 c Splenda, [too oily on the BBQ but did get compliments] on boneless skinless breasts with 1/4c oil, 1/4 c Splenda -once with 1/2 tsp cayenne, once with a full tsp.  Think 3/4 tsp cayenne may be just right for us...but very spicy is GOOD too!!!   Will try someday on boneless skinless thighs too...just not this week!  lol

I'm confused.  The receipe says cook time 40 minutes at the top but 20 minutes in the directions.  I went with the 20 minutes.  It's cooking right now.  Here's hoping.

This definitely has flavour!  I didn't have granulated Splenda, but used liquid Sugar Twin (but only just under 1/3 cup) and it still had a great sweet flavour. Actually, I might only use 1/4 cup sweetener next time.  My husband thought it might have been a Thai recipe as it had that great combination of sweet and spicy.  We really liked it!

Great marinade for chicken breast with bone and skin! Cut the olive oil way back to 1/4 cup, used 1/4 cup.brown sugar instead of Splenda, and full tablespoon of honey. Skipped saffron - not needed. Cut heat to 1/4 teas, and added 1/4 teas black pepper. Followed Adrian's review and added 1/4 cup orange juice otherwise just an oily mess. Also added 2 Tablespoons white white. Cook with indirect heat on grill for 20 minutes, then brush with marinade and grill with direct heat on medium-low heat to crisp skin watching closely or sugars will burn. Amazing every time!.

This recipe was awesome! We are a dieting family and are so tired of all of the low carb recipes. My husband found this one, bless his heart, and did an excellent job. He followed the recipe exactly except that he didn't use honey or saffron and marinated it for about three hours. One of the best chicken marinades I have ever tasted!!

Excellent marinade.  I would use only 1/2 cup of Splenda even if you double the recipe.  I made the marinade and froze the chicken for later still was as good as cooking it fresh

I've made this dish for my husband numerous times. We both love it. I made it a year or so ago for 3 other couples and they loved it. I'm having them over again this week-end and they all requested that I make this chicken. I too have omitted the saffron because of the cost. I've never had it with the saffron and this is probably my favorite way to prepare chicken. The sweet and spicy are very complimenting to each other. It's the best!
