I cook at a Retirement home and the residents loved this sauce.Now I did a few changes. I minced the onions and used Apple Cider for the vinegar and added liquid smoke and Cayenne Powder just enough to give a a twang.I also make this recipe for 50 people so I used a whole can of Ketchup. This recipe is the best I have ever tasted!!! Thanks a million!

At first, I was skeptical about the cornstarch, but this recipe actually turned out great!  My husband said it clung well to the meat on the BBQ and we both thought it tasted just like in a restaurant!  I did add an extra tablespoon of molasses, a dash garlic salt, and 1/2 tsp liquid smoke (hickory), and used some dried minced onion and onion powder (cuz I had run out of onion).  A keeper for us!

This was a GREAT recipe.  My husband and I both agree this is the best tasting bbq sauce we have ever tasted.  The kids liked it too.  We didn't change a thing.

This is a great recipe.  I added a few things to it to make it suit our taste.  I added a bit more worschestire, red pepper and black pepper and I will cut down on the vinegar next tme, but if you like a lot of tang leave the vinegar in. I slow cooked it in the crock pot with beans and the smell and flavor was outstanding.

I used this sauce for chicken thighs and it was sooo good!  It doesn't even come close to store bought bbq sauce.  Next time I will try it on ribs!

Yummy!!!! I poured this over chicken and let it cook in the slow cooker. Didn't change the original recipe only added a tiny bit of liquid smoke(mesquite)and brown sugar. The whole family enjoyed it very much and wanted to know when I could make it again. Very impressive when something pleases the whole family! Thank you so very much for sharing this recipe!

Whoa!  In a word: SOUR!  I added 2 extra tb molasses, and a tb or 2 of brown sugar to make it palatable, as well as a couple dashes liquid smoke just for fun.  I'll make it again with less vinegar.  It is certainly quick and easy.  Original recipe gets 3 stars, but my additions bumped it up to 4.

made this to through in the crockpot with some country pork ribs. Did not add water or cornstarch due to this. One of the BEST BBQ sauces I have made. I will definately be putting this on chicken to put on the grill. Oh so good! Even my husband who doesn't like BBQ, really enjoyed this one. Replaced the vinegar with lemon juice but that is preference

I have been looking for a good BBQ sauce recipe and this was it.  I have made this several times.  I like to add crushed red pepper and some liquid smoke. Everyone that tries it likes it so far. keeps well in the fridge. I have used it on ribs, chicken,and pulled pork. Simple and really good.

My husband and I did not like this at all. It left a very bad aftertaste. I think the molasses was too much as well as the worceshire and vinegar and the flavours didn't mellow out. They conflicted with each other and it was a waste of ingredients.

I used it as a quick BBQ sauce for some leftover shredded chicken that I wanted to use on sandwiches.  It was vinegary (in my opinion) as another reviewer commented so I added some more molasses and about 2t of honey.  Still had a tang, which is ok and it's not too sweet - which is what I was going for.  Easy to make.

This is a wonderful sauce. I thought I would have to cut back on the Worcestershire sauce but ended up adding every bit that the recipe called for.

Wow! It's well known that I'm a rookie when it comes to bbq'ing, but everyone raved on the great flavor of my chicken! I do recommend letting your chicken sit overnight in a pot filled with 7up. Makes the chicken super tender!

Great sauce!  1st I made it straight by the recipe, except used brown sugar b/c I didn't have molasses.  After that I added another 1/2 tsp mustard and doubled the garlic, and now it's my family's favorite sauce for anything bbq'ed!

This recipe is really great.  If you don't like molasses, you can substitute honey instead.  We never buy bottled sauce anymore. It's a favorite in my house.

I made this on the 4th because I was out of the bottled sauce and it was so good. Very easy, but I did add cumin, liquid smoke, pepper, hot pepper sauce, and honey. I left it on simmer longer to keep warm and it just got better. It was a hit on the spare ribs. I'll never buy bottled again.

I used this to make "pulled" chicken sandwiches with leftover roasted chicken.  I just pulled the meat off the bones while the sauce cooked and then added the sauce to the chicken to get the mixture I wanted.  Served on kaiser rolls with homemade french fries, salad, and corn on the cob.  It was a hit with everyone and made welcome leftovers for lunch the next day.  Thanks for the recipe!

I basically made the recipe as instructed. I used red wine vinegar instead of plain. I added 1 tsp. of liquid smoke. I subbed Crown Royale for water. At the end I added 1 Tble. brown sugar to take some of the tartness out. It was a big hit. Can't wait to make it again. Cornstarch is key. Really thickens up the sauce so it sticks to the meat while grilling

Great recipe.  I would have loved the tartness but my other half likes sweet sauce so I added 2 tbsp brown sugar, a tsp of honey, and 1 tbsp more of molasses.  WOW.  :)

This is a good BBQ Sauce! The Molasses adds it's own special taste to this sauce. We like this sauce on Kielbasa. I have made this sauce several times. It's one of my family's favorites! Thanks, MRBUZZSAW!

Perfect. Mixed it up, minus onions that were already in the crockpot w/ the pork, added it 2 hrs into cooking. Better than anything store bought.

I am so glad I ran out of BBQ sauce. The only modifications I made were that I pureed the onion and the garlic (separately) and I used roughly 3tbsp of brown sugar because I didn't have molasses. I am keeping this for the next time I make ribs or pulled pork.

AWESOME!!! My family loves pork barbeque and we are very picky about our sauces. This one was one of the best I have ever eaten or made. It would be great with chicken, too.

this turned out very good! I read all of  the reviews and added a little liquid smoke, good idea thanks! I did run into an issue but because of the way I made it. I placed the sauce in my slow cooker with frozen chicken breast omitted the water but it still came out runny. Next time I will use more cornstarch or fresh chicken. Still very good!!

This was great.  I doubled it, threw it in a crock pot with slices of pork tenderloin, and made some awesome pulled pork.

I found this sauce too vinegary, even after I cut the amount in half.  Easily remedied with a little help from the trusty AR group.  A little more molasses and a touch of honey did the trick.  Overall, a very tasty sauce!!

I'm giving this 5 stars because it's the best homemade BBQ sauce I've eaten.  If you add liquid smoke it would probably be even better, but I didn't have any.  One modification I did - I only added 2 T. vinegar instead of 3 and it was plenty to suite my tastes.

PERFECT! I thought I had molasses but didn't so I used pure maple syrup and it was so yummy! I'll never buy BBQ sauce again! AND it's quick and easy! Tangy yet sweet!

This is a good recipe, but I found it a bit too tangy for me.  I added some brown sugar and extra molasses to calm it down.  However after cooking I think it would have been fine.  My husband liked it a lot too, and he isn't a BBQ fan.  I will be making this again!

It tasted so sour in the pan I was worried but it mellowed quite nicely on the meat. I added brown sugar to balance the vinegar and let that cause thick caramelization on the meat rather than adding the water and cornstarch. Great flavor.

I don't think I'll ever buy bottled sauce again, this recipe is fantastic!  Used it to make pulled beef sandwiches with some leftover pot roast meat; I doubled the quantity and let the cooked meat simmer in the sauce until it fell apart.  Delicious!  The recipe is very tangy because of the vinegar.  If you prefer a smoother, sweeter sauce, you could eliminate the vinegar altogether or greatly reduce the quantity.  I added a couple tablespoons of brown sugar and that also helped balance out the vinegar a bit.  This would be a great sauce for making BBQ baked beans with, can't wait to try that.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I made this BBQ sauce to use on the chicken I was grilling this evening.  I followed the directions given plus I added 1/4 tsp. of cayenne and one T of brown sugar.  The sauce was liked by the entire family.  Thanks for the recipe.

Wowser, Buzzsaw, this is fab-you-lous!!! I added a little brown sugar, used half the ketchup and twice the mustard, and let it simmer until the coals were ready. This was thick, sweet, delish! I'll be using this again! Thanks.

Exactly what I was looking for, a nice deep barbecue sauce. I would double the molassess for extra richness. I used it in the oven in winter, but can't wait to take it outside!

This recipe was very good. I ran out of ketchup while I was making this, so I was only able to use about 1/2 c. Then I accidentally added too much water. Lol. It was good though even though I made mistakes. Thanks!!!
Update: I made this again and used the correct measurements, and I found it to be a little acidic and almost sour. I added about 1/2 brown sugar which made it a lot better though!

OMG! YUM! I used this on ribs, everyone loved it! I had no cornstarch, so obviously I used flour..no issues..and I like it a little sweeter so I added more molasses...it was so good after the ribs were gone, out came the loaf of bread to get any sauce that was left!!! I can just imagine how yummy this will be when I try it on chicken next!  :D :D :D

Wow, I used this recipe tonight for boneless chicken breasts and it was ridiculously good!! I had no molasses so I used brown sugar and Karo syrup. I also didn't have worcstr. sauce (my kitchen sucks) so I used soy sauce. We wound up using the delightful sauce for the fries, and then later on for chicken nuggets. What an outstanding recipe, we won't be using bottled anymore, my fiance prefers this. Thanks for this keeper!!

Pretty good -- I did add 3-4 tbsps. of brown sugar to cut the vinegar-y taste. Put about a 1/4 cup over top of some country style ribs in the slow cooker. Cooked until done and then drained the fat, shredded the meat, and returned to the pot with the remaining sauce and heated through. Tasty, kids loved it.

Nice, and not too sweet. The only sweetness comes from molasses and ketchup. the end taste did not overpower the ribs and was a nice compliment to them. My husband is very picky and he loves this recipe. I am saving to make over and over. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is a good starting point but was to tangy so I added an extra 2 TBLS molasses and 2 TBLS honey which cut down the vinagar tang and balanced the flavors. I will make again with my changes.

This was perfect! Kinda reminded me f a sweet onion bbq sauce. Easily could be put on ribs or chicken. Had a nice dark colour from the molasses. I didn't change the recipe at all.

It was too sour! I added about a 1/2 cup brown sugar and that made it more to my taste. I also added five cloves of garlic because I love garlic! I let it simmer for two hours to really blend the flavors and I did not use corn starch.

this recipe is AH-MAZING! Don't think I will ever buy the store bought again! I did add a Tbsp of honey after reading the reviews that it could be a little sweeter.

This recipe is spot on. Actually I used honey in place of molasses, but next time I will try with molasses & compare.My husband is extremely picky about his bbq, he was licking the saucepan!

Not too bad.  I ended up adding a little cayenne, paprika, and chili powder to zest it up.  I also substituted the molasses with honey-I didn't have any molasses on hand.  Still very good!  I liked it without all the seasonings too.

This is a really quick and easy and good BBQ sauce. Next time I will dice up the onions even finer as they were a little too chunky in the sauce for my kids' taste. This recipe is certainly a keeper. Thanks!

This Sauce kicks butt! My 9 year old who is the picky eater would have licked the plate if I had let him! I wanted a tangy marinade for chicken without the high fructose of store-bought and decided to make my own. Couldn't be easier and better!
I used a high-fructose free ketchup and marinaded my chix in ziplock baggies overnight. Impressed guests the next evening. I also baked my meal over a bed of onion slices instead of grilling, and it came out just as good plus had the nice sauce to blend into the veggies and rice sides.6 stars if I could.

This is a good, easy recipe, with a little bit of help.  You'll notice the recipe lacks salt...perhaps because ketchup is considered salty already?  I found it completely lacked salt once the bbq was done.  So, the second time I made it, I added salt to the pan. What a difference! It tasted much better.  I also found the addition of vinegar to be a little too tangy.  I added about a tablespoon of brown sugar to the pan as well.  The end result was a perfect balance, with the added salt and brown sugar.

Great sauce. I add honey to cut the vinegar taste, and add hot sauce for a bit of a kick.  Great on smoked chicken.

The problem with reviewing BBQ sauce is that BBQ is a method, not really a recipe.  Everyone wants something different.  Having said that, this was too sour for me - and sour was what I was actually looking for.  I tried to fix it with 1T brown sugar and a capful of liquid smoke, but still too sour.  I'll look for a different recipe next time.  If you are looking for something really punchy and vinegary, you will be really pleased with this recipe.

Yum!  It is quick, easy, and delicious. I did add a bit of garlic powder and some brown sugar, and it was a huge hit with both the kids and adults. I put it on grilled chicken thighs and drums.  Thanks Mr.Buzzsaw!

Very good and easy to make.  I made this in a pinch because I didn't have the BBQ sauce I needed for a recipe and didn't feel like running out to the store.  I'll make again.

Made this pretty much as directions called, but used Apple Cider Vinegar in place of regular since I had more of that. Used it on shredded pork for sandwiches. It was okay...nothing earth shattering, but tasted fine. If I made this again I would probably make alterations, but will likely look for one that better fits our taste.

Great base recipe. I like others halved the vinegar and even then combined with the ketchup was to much twang for me. I will omit totally next time. I added 1/2 tsp of liquid smoke and 1/2 tsp of pepper mix and 1/2 tsp of black pepper. Dont think I will ever use another type of BBQ sauce. Thanks for the recipe!!

Tastes wonderful as a tangy sauce that hits you immediately and then a subtle sweetness in the background; added hickory smoke and some heat--cayenne, pepper flakes.  My sisters liked this sauce better compared to Big Al's, but I liked them both for different reasons.  It will be great to have both sauces at the BBQ!

We had smoked some baby back pork ribs using applewood chips, and I didn't want to use either hickory or mesquite smoked BBQ sauce, so I tried this.    WOW!!  My husband said it was as close as he has every tasted to a BBQ recipe from his younger days.    Only problem . . .he said we won't be buying BBQ sauce anymore . . .he just wants me to make this one.  Absolutely a 5 Star recipe.  Thank you.

I use this sauce for slow cooker ribs - my whole family loves it and won't tolerate me trying to change it!  The only change I make to the recipe as written is balsamic vinegar instead of white, and that's only because I just didn't have any the first time I made it.  Fantastic recipe, thanks so much!

Had these as written for labor day, Dbl'd the recipe for leftovers the next night, My family hasn't tired of them yet!  I've been asked every day since when I'm going to make them again! I would save this recipe for a weekend as they are rather time consumming, but well worth it. Will be saving this recipe for sure. Thanks for sharing.

I just love this sauce! The only change I make is I use a good balsamic vinegar instead of regular vinegar. It just has a better flavor and doesn't have that strong vinegar taste. I also like a sweeter sauce so I add a little bit more molasses. I haven't bought barbeque sauce since I found this recipe.

I really liked this sauce. But I did take the advice of a couple other reiewers and cut the vinegar down by about 1/2, put about 1 teaspoon of honey in and pry about 1+ tablespoon of brown sugar in.  And a dash of liquid smoke and it was great.  Will use it again.

i enjoyed this recipe because it was simple. the flavor was good except i did not have molasses so i used honey. however, the honey did not give that certain flavor that molasses would so i had to add some brown sugar. i'm sure if i had molasses on hand the flavor would have come out perfect.

Excellent BBQ sauce and easy to make. I used this to grill bone in chicken breasts.  Instead of molasses, I used honey and brown sugar. I doubled the amount to reduce the vinegar (used cider vinegar. Sauteed the onions and garlic in olive oil.  One secret ingredient: Penzey's BBQ 3000.

I made this to go with some pulled pork BBQ and it came out great. I liked having a recipe that did not have to sit for hours or days before using. I thought that the ketchup was a bit overwhelming but my husband said he loved it just like it was. I will make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

WOW!!! I will never buy bottled BBQ sauce again. This is amazing! I made a couple small changes. I added about 2 tsp ground cumin. And 1 omitted the water and cornstarch all together. My end result was a thick, beautiful sauce.

This sauce was ok. I did add some honey and a 1/2 teaspoon of liquid smoke.

It was good but I will leave out the mustard because it comes close to tasting like the McDonalds hamburger sauce.

I have made this twice and the second time I left out the vinegar which we liked better.  Hubby bought a huge rack of beef ribs, we 'mopped' them with this sauce, wrapped tightly in foil and smoked them for 8 hours, very good!

Excellent BBQ sauce and easy to make!  I added an extra clove of garlic, several sprinkles of cumin, 1 tsp. of hot sauce and some honey.  We used it for chicken and are looking forward to trying it with other meats!
