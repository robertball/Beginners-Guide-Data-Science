I liked the idea of mint in the salad because it sounded refreshing, but thought that 1/2 cup seemed like an awful lot.  I only used a couple tablespoons or so (didn't measure it) but even so it was a little much for our tastes.  I will definitely make the salad again with less mint. The dressing was very good.  I didn't seed the tomatoes or cucumbers, either.

I don't normally like mint in my non-dessert dishes, but this was FANTASTIC!  Tastes like summer.  Use with Splenda, and you've got a very carb-friendly dish, too.  I'll be making frequently!  Thanks very much for sharing.

Refreshingly delicious!  I used 3 large Kirby (pickle) cucumbers peeled, halved length wise and sliced.  I didn't have any problems mixing them with soft tomatoes.  The mint went perfectly with the tomatoes.  This dish went very well with fried pork chops.  I added cubed fresh mozzerella cheese to the leftovers for lunch the next day.  Yummy!

I love this salad, but I do it a bit differently. I don't use sugar.  But I do use 1 clove minced garlic, lemon or lime juice, and a yellow pepper (mostly for aesthetics).  I generally serve it over couscous so that it takes up all the yummy juices.  Simple, refreshing, and full of flavor!

This salad is excellent.  My boyfriend thought it looked like something you would get in a restaurant.  I also used less mint and I didn't have enough big tomatoes from my garden so I substitued some grape tomatoes...very good!

This wasn't to my taste. The vinegar was just to overwhelming. It does have a beautiful presentation though.

Great salad.  I cut the mint in half and added fresh parsley.  I also substituted 1/2 the vinegar with lemon juice.  It is a keeper!!

This was simple and delicious!  I used plum tomatoes and English cucumber (did not peel the cucumber - cut it into chunks).  Nice change from a typical side salad, and the mint is a nice change, too!  I've made this several times, and it is also delcious with white wine vinegar or white balsamic.

Fabulous.  Hubby's garden is overgrown in mint, so I've been trying any recipe with mint.  Took this recipe to a party and it received rave reviews.  I'm not a big fan of cucumbers, but even I loved it.  Thanks for sharing.  (BTW - this is my first review on allrecipes.)

I also halve the mint. I delete the sugar and olive oil and this is perfect and free for weight watchers. Must like vinegar!

I made this salad because I wanted to use a bunch of cucumbers, mint, and cherry tomatos out of my garden.  It came out great, and was a big hit at my neighbor's party.  I did not follow the recipe exactly, with use of the veggies, but it was great!

I left out the sugar and switched basil for the mint. Although I'm sure it's great with mint, I prefer basil.  make sure you use a really good extra virgin olive oil.

I thought that this recipe sounded interesting as I had cucumbers, mint and lots of tomatoes ready to be used.  The salad was ok, but I am not sure that I would make it with the mint again.  In fact when I was eating it, I really didn't taste the mint until after I was finished eating the salad.  Next time I think I would just have used basil instead of the mint.

I really love this recipe!! I substituted splenda for sugar to keep it low cal. The key is definitely putting the fresh mint in last, right before you serve. It was FANTASTIC!

This recipe seemed too simple to be very good, but I wanted to try an alternative to the traditional cucumber salad I usually make with cider vinegar, oil, and sugar. But simplicity can be wonderful, as proven with this salad....it was delicious, just fresh and light. I've made it twice so far and it goes quickly. The second time I made it with Splenda for a low-calorie side and it was equally good. I'll be making this quite a lot through the summer as the cucumbers ripen.

YUM!!!  Didn't read the instructions before starting and didn't realize I needed to marinate cukes an hour before finishing, so dinner was on the table before this was ready.  So, after I finished making it, I put it in a container and let it sit overnight and had it for lunch the next day.  Good idea!  It really allowed all those wonderful flavors to marry, and it was WONDERFUL!  Added a ball of fresh mozzarella, cubed just before serving.  As another reviewer quoted, "Tastes like summer!"  Other than adding the mozzarella, didn't change a thing.  This is light and refreshing.  A real keeper!  Thanks so much for sharing!

This was so refreshing! We just loved it. The only change I made is that I put in 3 tablespoons of olive oil and just under 1/3 cup of the red wine vinegar. Will definitly make this again!

This is fantastic!  A very refreshing salad I've passed on to many friends.  Sometimes when I make it, I sub cilantro  instead of mint. Both herbs are great-- the cilantro gives it a bit of a southwestern feeling.

I didn't use nearly as much mint as was called for and I thought it was still quite strong. Going forward, I would add only a TBS or two of chopped mint. I also thought there onions were also a bit overpowering for my tastes so if I make again I will reduce to my tastes.

Very refreshing! Would be great to take to a picnic. Its the kind of salad that when it gets mixed up with the other food your plate.. it makes the other food better :) I did not use the olive oil, just didnt think it needed it. Also, gradually add mint so you get the taste thats best for you. Thanks for the recipe!

I thought there was way too much vinegar in this recipe and it completely overpowered the dish.  I would make it again but I would dice the cucumbers, use less onion, and half the vinegar.  I thought the mint taste was subtle and quite enjoyed that twist.

Next time I will use a better quality vinegar because it was too pungent.  Otherwise the mint & tomato was delish.  Also, I think I will cut up the cucumbers a little smaller so that it blends together better.  The thick slices didn't mix in well w/ the soft tomatoes.  All in all, a great recipe for a gardner!

This has a very cool and refreshing taste that is perfect for those hot summer barbeque parties. I recommend splurging to get good quality red wine vinegar so it does not overwhelm the flavor of this dish. I will definitely be making this often during the summer.

Delicious!  Easy to make, but impressive taste.My guests loved it, but didn't pick up on the mint flavor too much..I didn't use the full amount as per other reviews..The picture shows cucumbers unpeeled, and the recipe indicates to peel them.I peeled strips, so the skin wasn't a big deal.Will definitely make again.

This salad is great! Very refreshing. I have a lot fresh mint growing this summer and I was excited to see this recipe and use some of my mint. I did use half the amount of mint like others suggested.

I like this - it's different!  Very good summer dish.  I did the mint to taste instead of the listed amount.  I had tomatoes on hand from my local farmers market, but I can't wait to make this with cucumbers and tomatoes out my garden this summer.  My mint was fresh cut out of my garden, too (it was pretty strong!). It is a pretty salad, too!  YUM!!

If you find the Red Wine Vinegar is too acidic try Balmastic Vinegar.  I also used Grape Tomatoes which I cut in half.  This is an excellent recipe for a hot summer day.

My husband LOVED this salad so it was a hit at our house, but he is a big cucumber and tomato fan.  I used less mint than called for (about 1/4 a cup) and it tasted great.  If you love cucumber tomato salad, try it, but go light on the mint at first. I think 1/2 a cup could've been overwhelming.  Also, definitely needs salt and pepper. Plan adding it at the end.

This was really delicious and easy! My grocery store didn't have fresh mint so I used fresh parsley instead. It was still good. I am dying to try it w/ the mint, though.

We loved this. As always, I used an English cucumber, and removed strips of peel with a potato peeler. Also used cherry tomatoes, as that's what I had on hand. I served this slightly chilled. Delicious. Thanks!

Super easy and although I’m not a big mint fan, it works with this recipe. I did cut the quantity back a bit though. As others had suggested, I did not seed the cucumber or tomatoes. Couldn’t see the benefit.

I thoroughly enjoyed the salad though my husband did not. I gave it a four because the recipe does not reflect the picture above it. Recipe calls for cucumber to be peeled and seeded and the tomatoes to be seeded and chopped. The picture shows neither of them have been seeded and the tomatoes is not what I'd call chopped. Removing the seeds from both of these doesn't leave much left! I drastically reduced the amount of mint using only about 2 T. I will make it again...for myself!

Very refreshing summer salad!  Let the salad sit for a couple of hours and then the mint really pops with flavor.  I didn't use the oil.  I forgot it and it was still delicious.

This was very good. I used grape tomatoes only because I had purchased two containers and they didn’t have much flavor, so cut them in half, and it  worked out great. Thanks, will make again.

To me the vinegar was very strong and not complimented by the mint.  Also if you tried to make it a day ahead or use leftovers the next day the mint bacame slimy and vinegar was even stronger.

This was easy and delicious. Subbed fresh basil for the mint, but will try it again this summer with the mint.

I've been making this all summer long! The first time, I added everything before I read to marinate the cucumbers but it turned out delicious anyway. The next time, I tried marinating them, but couldn't tell a difference. It's very forgiving. I never really follow it to a T, and it always turns out delicious! Last time I added crumbled feta to it, and that was really tasty as well!

I made it just as the recipe directed but I didn't have red onions on hand so I used shallots.  It was delicious!  Will make this again and again.  So healthy too!

I made this exactly as written and loved it!  We took this and a couple other salads on a boat trip- this was the first one gone. 
I want my mint to hurry up and grow back so I can make some more!

we really enjoyed with a few modifications (per usual).. i cut the recipe in half and left out the sugar.. instead of 1.5 large tomatoes i used a pint of orange zima grape tomatoes that i sliced in half.. i subbed 2 large green onions for the red onion.. and eyeballed the red wine vinegar, mint and olive oil amounts.. it didn't need any additional salt or pepper.. i did add one crushed garlic to the mix.. it was a perfect salad to accompany our beer can chicken and baked beans.. looking over my past reviews, this seems to be almost identical to Tomato, Cucumber and Red Onion Salad with Mint on this site.. only difference being the amount of olive oil.. this time around i didn't make as many mod's and found myself enjoying it more than i remember the first time.. ty for the recipe

I tried this wonderful recipe with fresh peppermint. After about three hours of absorbing all of the flavors it was just outstanding. The peppermint just brightened all of the rest of the flavors. I will make this again for sure.

Similar to AUNTWEBBIE I also do not like Mint with non dessert dishes, however when making this for a barbeque I went to, it went down really well !!

I loved the recipe. I know the mint is the important part, but I didn't have any. But it's still amazing. I did think that next time I will use 3 cucumbers instead of only 2. There is a lot more tomatoes than cucumbers. I love tomatoes but the cucumbers really soak up the taste and I love it.

My family has been enjoying this salad for years without the mint, so the mint gave it a new fun kick. I also didn't use 1/2 cup because that seemed like it would be too overwhelming.

I agree with others who said that there was too much mint, so I also used less than was called for. This is definitely an interesting salad. I loved it, it was so refreshing although fresh mint is not a taste I am accustomed to.

I made this with out the mint, simply because I didn't see any at the store.  This is one of the best and easiest to make cucumber salads I have ever had.

I always have mint growing in the garden and was glad to find another use for it!  Had quite a bit of dressing left over after eating the salad so I cut some cherry tomatoes in half and marinated them for another salad the next day.  I added some more mint as I really like the refreshing flavor combo.
