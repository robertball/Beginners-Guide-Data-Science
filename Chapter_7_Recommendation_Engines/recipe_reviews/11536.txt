WOW! I never made biscotti before, but everyone I gave this too loved it, and two even made it themselves after.  I made it for a church Christmas bakesale and my husband wouldn't let me take more than 1/2.  I like the fact that the pieces aren't huge, just about 4-5 inches long when the logs are sliced horizontally.  The only changes I made were from earlier reviews, adding about a cup more flour, using almond instead of anise (didn't have anise), and using entire container of fruit (2 cups).  Not only for Christmas around here!!

I made these for Christmas this year based on the reviews I read.  These Biscotti's were very nice.  I made them as the recipe called and also with white chocolate along the bottom.  I loved them either way.  I brought some to work and they were a big hit with my co-workers also.  The dried candy was a bit hard and chewy.  Not sure why that happened or if anyone else had this problem.  Thanks to others who told that the dough would be very sticky.  I was prepared for that and therefore was able to work well with it with a little more flour.  I used just enough to be easier to handle and tried to handle it as little as possible as not to dry them out.
Thank you for this recipe.  I will make these again and again!

Very yummy!  A subtle anise flavor and very festive with the candied fruit!  Super easy to make-dough a little sticky though.  Had to heavily flour work surface and hands....worth the effort!

This is the worst biscotti recipe I have ever made.  It is way too sweet, and there's no flavor to it.

The Best alternative to that fruitcake that gets passed around year to year.  The kids ate it, the in-laws ate it, and even the husband asked for more!!!  We call it Christmas Biscotti.

Easy to make, delicious to eat!  I did not need the refrigerator time, I just baked these loaves.  Once each loaf was baked, I only needed 10 minutes per side to finish the baking! I will be making these again!

I made these with friends for Christmas this year and doubled the recipe.  Needed a much much bigger bowl!  We had tons of cookies and they turned out great.  Everyone loved them.  I didn't dip them in chocolate but I'll try it next time.  I think they would suit anytime of year.

Great recipe. Easy to make.  Taste is wonderful (although our family is italian and a big fan of annisette so, i sprinkled in a little bit more.)  These cookies look so pretty for the holidays-but I make them all year long.  They are a wonderful coffee cookie.  I have been using this recipe for over a year now and i get compliments every time!

These biscotti are wonderful; however, I increased the candied fruit by adding a
1/4 cup each of red and green candied cherries for Xmas.  Also an additional 1 tsp.
of vanilla.  Finally, I brushed the logs with an egg wash before baking to make them
glisten.  You may even dip one end in white chocolate and decorate with nuts or candy.

I found this recipe to be very easy to make. It has a good flavor and festive look to it.
I did not have any anise so I used almond flavoring instead and it worked very nicely.
I will make these cookies again.

These were really yummy!  I usually don't like using anise, but in this recipe it wasn't over powering at all.  I dipped them in chocolate and gave them away as gifts.  Rave reviews from all who ate them, with or without the chocolate.  Will definitley make these next year!

I followed the recipe, added 2 cups of fruit, put the dough in the fridge for and hour, and then I got lazy. Looking at the dough I could see it was sticky and would take some adjusting to get it to the consistency to roll out...and then there was the slicing and baking again step.  So I decided to make drop cookies with the dough. I used a heaping tablespoon of dough for each cookie, raised the temp to 350 and baked for 15 minutes. They came out great...not crunchy like a biscotti, more like a sweet cookie.  So if you get lazy like me, this way is pretty good too.

We like this recipe so much.  I'll be making it for Christmas gifts.  Adding a little extra flour right from the start made preparation easier.  Maybe about a half cup more flour.

I made these last year and loved them. Being of Norwegian heritage I saw their potential to take on the flavor of yulekage, which is a Christmas bread with candied fruits and cardamom. I put in the whole package of candied fruit ,a cup of sliced almonds, and a teaspoon of ground cardamom instead of the anise flavor. I drizzled them with melted white chocolate chips when done and cooled. Just melt the chips carefully in a quart size plastic freezer bag, then snip the corner and squeeze out a thin stream of chocolate. Heaven for this Norwegian!

I had never made biscotti before and these came out really well. I just wanted a recipe to use some extra candied fruit. I refrigerated the dough for 3 hours and it wasn't difficult (too sticky) to work with at all. So simple and so yummy!

I did make changes because I am pre-diabetic but stuck to the exact measurements of everything except: used 4 cups Whole Wheat Pastry Flour and 2 Tbsp. Oat Flour and 1 cup Almond Flour.  I used Splenda instead Sugar and only added 3 scant tablespoons of candied fruit for the entire recipe.  I still got the flavor, it came out to be a perfect dough and shaping was very easy.  This is definitely a Keeper  :-)

My husband strongly dislikes fruit cake.  The mixed candied fruit was sitting on the kitchen counter waiting to be added to the biscotti ingredients.  His response....'yuk!'  He quickly changed his tune when he had his first bite with his breakfast coffee.  His opinion of fruit cake fruit shifts to loving  the grand flavor of these biscottis with the candied fruit.  Terrific receipe.

This recipe's going to replace other's I've used - it was easy and oh-so-festive.  I then followed the  basic recipe but substituted slivered almonds for the candied fruit and it too was fantastic.  This is a versatile recipe that's simple, reliable and I highly endorse it!!!

I loved this. But then I love Candied Fruit. The rest of my family prefers other versions of biscotti. When the holidays come around I am definitely making myself a batch of these.
