This recipe is really great, but I have some changes that can make it near perfect.  I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour, canola oil in place of vegetable oil, and I reduce the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and they are still super sweet, and even down to 1/3 cup and they're still yummy.  For flavor I always use 1 tsp. of cinnamon and a whole cup of raisins.  To make them chewy still use a 9x13 pan but don't spread the mixture into the entire pan- leave about an inch and a half empty space on one end.  (The batter will cook exactly as it sits so you don't have to worry about it spreading.  Also, you must be careful not to overcook these.  Thirty minutes is way too long, but since every oven is different I can only really tell you that you need to take them out right when you see the edges becoming brown (the middle may still appear undone.)  For me that is 18 minutes.  If you do that they will stay chewy forever--just store them in a ziploc bag.  And my last bit of advice is that you can get really creative with this recipe.  For example, instead of raisins add dried cranberries and slivered almonds. Or up the cinnamon and add chopped dried apples.  Or you could add peanut butter and freeze dried banana bits (like you find in the toddler section).   Or you could play around with some canned pumpkin and pumpkin pie spice. Just have fun!

This recipe is a wonderful start!  What I love about it is all that you can do with it.  I've been making this for months now.  What I usually do is throw in whatever leftover  bananas (goes great with the vanilla), applesauce, trail-mix, etc. into the mix! (this week I put in blueberries) Some weeks I put about a 1/4 cup peanut butter with the wet ingredients.  Sometimes I put lemon, almond (especially yummy) or rum flavoring with the vanilla.  Most times it comes out like a granola bar, sometimes like a cookie bar, but it's always good.  I sometimes use whole wheat flour too.  The only time I messed up this recipe, it came out a little dry and wouldn't cut without crumbling.  I just crumbled it up, threw it back in the oven for a bit and had some mean granola.    A good tip with this recipe is to measure out the vegetable oil first and then use the same measuring cup for the honey....it prevents the honey from sticking.  Always wonderful, I have some baking right now.

I've made these bars twice now; the first time, I followed the directions exactly and I found the finished product a little to crumbly for my taste. The kids and hubby devoured them and immediately requested more. The 2nd time I added 1/2 cup of apple sauce to the mix . This made the bars much easier to cut and gave them a more chewy, cookie-like texture. The fam. inhaled these, as well. In the future, I guess I'll add apple sauce and make them more chewy depending on the mood of my kids that day, (my husband prefers the crunchy). Thanks!!!

This is the best recipe that even comes close to the expensive store bought bars.  I used 3 cups of Old Fashioned oats which gave it a beefer texture (I like).  I also replaced the flour with whole wheat pastry flour.   As for the oil, I've made it both ways, with and used applesauce as a substitute....I prefer the applesauce, but increased it to 1 cup.  As suggested by other reviewers, I lowered the brown sugar to 1/2 c.  I also replace the honey with Splenda.  I used cranberries and walnuts instead of raisins, plus increased cinn. to 1t and added 1/4 t allspice as others suggested.  To make them heart-healthy, I lowered the wheat germ to 1/4 c and added 1/4 c ground flax seed.  MY husband and I love these...my 3 and 5 year old prefer dried blueberries in theirs.  I've probably made these a dozen times, tweeking things each time.

I've made these twice now and the second time I made them I tweaked the recipe a bit and came up with a great granola bar! Instead of the wheat germ I used natural wheat bran, added 2 tablespoons of flax seed, whole wheat flour instead of the all purpose, and instead of the oil I used 1/4 cup of organic crunchy peanut butter and 1/4 mashed banana. I also tossed in some craisins instead of raisins and some mini chocolate chips...delicious!

Very good recipe, I've made these at least 5 times in the last month, I made several variations... I made them with pure maple syrup (prefer honey) Made them with chopped walnuts, very good. I also add sliced almonds on top & lightly pat down, good & very pleasing to the eye too. ;) I made them with chocolate chips, we did not like these very much, even my little ones prefer raisins or craisins. I also tried adding half applesauce in place of the oil and they are not near as good, way too dry. I use "Old Fashioned oats" & double the recipe & bake on a foil lined jelly roll pan, I spray lightly with pam. I get rave reviews from all who have tried these, I make them & send them to work with my husband,- his co-workers love 'em! as do my children & their friends! you will not be disappointed, you can really add whatever you like to make it "your own".  I'm going to try dried blueberries next! YUM!

Great coming out of the oven, nice n' chewy, but gets dry the next day.  Doesn't keep as well as I would like - and a little dry and lacking spices/flavor. This would have been better with just dried fruit such as chopped dried apricots, raisins, dates, cranberries etc. Moms, try the "Gobble Up Granola Snacks" from this site.  Much more flavorful, soft n chewy and super easy to make.  Look it up.

This is a great base for granola bars.  I added stone milled flour instead of white and reduced it to 2/3 cup, cut the sugar to 1/2 cup, added 1/3 cup each flax seeds, sesame seeds, and sunflower seeds, and 1/2 cup chocolate chips.  Any dried fruit is also a great addition.  We pack them on hiking trips, they are very filling and keep you full.  They also freeze well, but they seem to dissapear right from the freezer!

Wonderful!  I was craving crunchy granola bars and found this recipe. I found it a little sweet; next time I'll decrease the sugar to probably 2/3 or even 1/2 cup.  I used 1/2 c raisins and 1/2 c chocolate chips, decreased the amount of wheat germ to 1/4 c and added 1/4 c of rice protein powder, to bump up the amount of protein.  I'll definitely make them again.  Do be sure to cut them before they get cold - they do make crunchy bars!

HELPFUL TIPS NOT MENTIONED: 1st: My own tip is to wrap these individually in plastic wrap (press n seal) & store at room temp (NOT FRIDGE or they'll stiffin).  That way they're easy to travel w/esp if you're giving them to toddlers as a snack!  Stays moist!  2nd: Substitute w/all wheat flour & 1/2C applesauce. Works wonderfully, but I've also substituted the oil w/canola oil with better results.  3rd: I put this in a 9X13, but shaped it until it was the thickness I wanted in a granola bar.  I like mine about as thick as a snicker's bar.  4th, I put 1/4C of almonds & another 1/4C of dried blueberries to go along with 1C of dried cranraisins.  5th, I like things sweet, but this really has an unnecessary amount of brown sugar.  I reduce to 1/2C.  With these changes, I've NEVER had anything but chewy moist granola bars that last a long time!  I think these are better than "Gobble Up Granola Snacks" from this site AND they contain peanut butter which didn't work out for some of the toddlers in my son's playgroup (allergic).  So this is the perfect alternative recipe. :)

Okay, I only make these in (minimum) double batches since my first batch. FANTASTIC!! I use all organic ingredients (I have a chemical sensitivity) and always substitute the following: flax seed for wheat germ, apple sauce for oil, ww for wh flour, and crispy rice cereal for 1/4 of the oatmeal. After that, they are idiot-proof - any combination of fruit/nuts/flavours is amazing. I bake in a 365 convection oven for 18-20 minutes - perfect for us, chewy and firm, not gooey or too hard. Crunchy, flavourful, indefinite shelf life (not that they last very long!). I use parchment paper instead of greased pans, and easily slide the cooled square onto a cutting board to slice up with a pizza cutter. Excellent recipe! Everyone - and I mean *everyone* - who has tried any of my iterations has asked for ... no, Demanded! the recipe. Thank you so much for sharing!

This is a good recipe. Tweak it to your family's tastes. I prefer a less dense bar, so my next batch will include Rice Krispies or somesuch thing to make it lighter. I did the usual "healthy" changes plus one other that I didn't see listed a billion times so I'll mention this one--I replaced part of the honey with almond butter (will use peanut butter next time). It changes the sweetness ratio when you do that, but not the stickiness ratio (which is the harder to control of the two). I do recommend everyone try this without "extras" at least once so you can see what the texture should be like. (Replace grains for grains, fruits for fruits, fats for fats, etc, but don't go adding 2 more cups of salted nuts and then whine when it turns out dry or salty!) This recipe is pretty much no-fail assuming you like oats to start with! P.S. It is not necessary to "generously grease" your pan. A generous spritzing of cooking spray works just fine if you cut them & run a knife around the edges when they're still warm.

These are really really good! one thing, though: if you are expecting granola bars like you buy at the grocery store, you will really want to up the fruits and nuts and cut back on the flour. It turns out a little denser than a dense cake, at least the way i did it. I followed several other reviews on here and decreased to 1/3 c. brown sugar, replaced the oil with as much applesauce, and replaced the raisins with craisins and added 1/3 c chopped almonds. I think next time i will decrease the flour and add more nuts and fruit.  NOTE: Those of you wanting to substitute the oil for applesauce need to anticipate a SHORTER cook time; recipes using applesauce instead of oil bake noticeably faster, so start checking at around 20 minutes- mine took 23.

We really like these. Made the following changes/adaptations based on reviews and like them better!
1. Doubled recipe and put in wax-paper (or foil) lined jelly roll pan (don't know why, but this made the texture better). This gave me 40 bars.
2. Cut the brown sugar down to 1/4 cup for a single recipe (1/2 c. for double).
3. Added in 1 c. chopped nuts (for the double recipe).

I submitted this recipe, but wanted to add a note.  Yesterday we made them again and we tripled the recipe using 2 cups of wheat flour and only one cup (total) of oil and they turned out great.  They were a little more crumbly than they would be if I'd added more oil, but they really turned out great!  If you triple the recipe - use 2 cookie trays and then use after pressing it into the pan (which little kids can do to help!) you can use a rolling pin to flatten them out nicely.  Hope you all like the recipe!  Like I said - we can't keep them around!  At least they are a somewhat healthy snack for little guys!

I made these using whole wheat flour, 1/2 the amount of oil and reduced the sugar, also using a "baking blend" of brown sugar and sucralose. I ended up not liking them because of the artificial sweetener flavor, but my BF loved them. He said it was like a big oatmeal cookie with less fat and sugar.  I gave it four stars even though I didn't care for them, but that was my fault and not the recipe. I will make them again and add some unsweetened applesauce to make up for the reduced oil, and also use real sugar this time. Can't beat the real stuff! Just use less of it.

I gave this 5 stars because I did so many alterations that there is no way I know what the original bar would taste like! However, I do prefer a more chunky bar made without flour. I followed the advice of the other reviews and used 2 cups oats, 1/3- 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup wheat germ, 1 tspn cinn., 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1 cup mixture of raisens, cranberrys and walnuts, 3/4 tspn salt, 1/2 cup honey or splenda (used splenda), 1 egg, 1 cup applesauce for the oil (will try banana or peanut butter next time), 1tspn. vanilla ext., 1/4 tspn, allspice. I cooked for 18 min. Can you tell I like to substitite to make it healthier??

Great, great recipe!!! What I love about it is that you can tweek this and come up with many different variations. I add 1 1/2 cups of crispy rice cereal, an extra egg, and I double the cinnamon. I also add dried cranberries along with the raisins. I also use whole wheat flour instead of white and I throw in some flax. The crispy rice cereal give it a nice crunch and the extra egg adds the moisture needed because of the extra dry ingredients. All the ingredients that I use are organic. I am going to try a Christmas variation this year by using only dried cranberries and adding white chocolate chips.....sounds good!!!! WARNING....once you try this, you will turn your nose up at any store bought granola bar:) It is a great way to replace junk with a good healthy snack:) I highly recommend this recipe!!

Love this recipe. I am now making about 2 batches every week because my family loves it enough and takes it to school for snacks or for after workouts etc. I've played around with it quite a bit - it is very open to doing that without ruining it for many of the ingredients except for the oil. I've found that applesauce and bananas with or without the oil didn't give it the right texture. The texture that was best for subbing the oil was either half oil and half pureed beans or all pureed beans. 

It works very well with subbing wheat flour for all purpose flour. I have also subbed 1/4 c flax seed meal for 1/4 c of flour (and still using 3/4 flour). I also sub wheat or oat bran for the wheat germ. I've also subbed almond extract for vanilla.

I've put all kinds of fillers in it - craisins, chocolate chips, white chocolate chips, butterscotch. Cut up dried apricots, dried apples and even some crunched banana chips. 

I suggest making the recipe as is at first and then have fun subbing. There is very little that I have found that goes wrong.

These granola bars are awesome! I sought out a granola bar recipe because I was spending a small fortune on store bought bars that I didn't even like that much and who knows what was really in them! I made the recipe to the T the first time but I've made a few changes along the way. I reduce the sugar and salt by 1/3, substitute canola for vegetable oil, use wheat flour instead of white and substitute half the wheat germ with whole flax seed. But every time I make these I try a new ingredient. My favorite has been the addition of 1/4 cup of chopped banana chips and 1/4 cup of nutella! The nutella makes them a little moister with a hint of chocolate. I just pulse whole banana chips in the food processor. I've been meaning to try white chocolate peanut butter as well. It's so easy to adjust this recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I make these weekly and eat them for breakfast - They are fantastic!  To the recipe given here, I also add: another 1/2 c. oats, another 1/4 c. cranberries (for a total of 1/2 c.) (or try dried blueberries or dried cherries or apricots, etc), 1/4 c. sunflower seeds, 1/4 c. pecan pieces chopped small (try your favorite nut!), and 1/4 c. golden flax seeds.  Some folks like 1 c. of chocolate chips added, but I have not tried that.  I use whole wheat flour and canola or safflower oil.  So far I have never needed to add additional oil or honey to make it all stick together.  Some HINTS: (1) measure the oil first and THEN the honey, so that the honey doesn't stick to the measuring cup; (2) butter your hands before pressing the mixture into the pan, (3) use a pizza wheel to cut the bars, and (4) don't the let bars get too cool, or they will be very difficult to cut!  One batch lasts me about a week and a half.  Since I eat two bars for breakfast, I wrap each set of two bars in saran with a layer of saran between them, and they stay fresh and nice for two weeks.  They can also be frozen.  Be sure to try these - they are the best I have found!  We use all organic ingredients, and the flavors are wonderful!

Awesome. Got thrown into the rotation immediately. I've made this three times already in about four days - some of that was for a party we hosted, and all the bars went quickly. I would recommend cooking the bars for the entire 30 minutes. The second batch I only did 25 minutes and they were still very chewy. My wife said it was like an oatmeal cookie but I thought 'Well, it's not supposed to be a cookie' so the next time I baked it for 30 minutes and it was chewy like a chewy bar, not like a chewy cookie.

I'm sure I've rated this before, but we made them again. We always add a few extras that we have on hand. I even used whole wheat flour. I added 1/2 applesauce to give it more juice. Also, my egg was gigantic, which probably helped too. We add: flax seeds, coconut, raw sunflower seeds, whatever we can find. My daughter loves to help and then eat her creation and this is a perfect project for her. She can't overmix it and its great tasting too. Thanks for sharing!

I wanted a crunchy granola bar so I tried this recipe. It smelled as if they were burning after 15 minutes at 350 degrees, so I took them out and lowered the temperature to 200 degrees, cut the bars and continued baking them on racks for another 15 minutes. I had used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 white flour and added nuts. They are quite good and almost what I had in mind, (the name brand crunchy granola bars, but with more stuff in them).

I love these bars and find them addictive! As written, they're awesome. As a bonus, this recipe can be switched up for variety by trying different kinds of dried fruit in place of raisins, or adding other fun things like walnuts or peanut butter chips. They are pretty sweet, so my personal preference is to cut the brown sugar back to 2/3 cup instead of 3/4, and cut the honey to 1/3 cup instead of 1/2. I usually go half and half with  whole wheat/white flour, too. Fast, easy, and a crowd pleaser! YUM!

These turned out really good.  I substitued ground flax for the wheat germ and choc chips instead of raisins.  I think the choc chip addition made it a little too sweet.  Next time, if I add them, I think I'll reduce the sugar.  Also added chopped almonds.  These are the perfect snack.  Thanks for submiting.

I make this as is, but I put half of the mixture down into the pan, cover it wih jam and dried fruit (usually cranberries), then slap the rest of the mixture on top.  I don't add any raisins.  But I add about a 1/4 cup of unsweetened shredded coconut.  we love it.

These are awesome. We've made them with all sorts of variations, and they always turn out. My favorite is with dried cranberry & apple. I cut the flour down when I want a gooier version.

great base for customizing with whatever you have on hand.  I added trail mix the first time, and the second time added one mashed banana, 1/2c chocolate chips, and an extra 1/2 c rolled oats.  thanks for a tasty, simple, and easy to adapt recipe!

Thanks for the great recipe! All in all, this is an awesome quick & easy, versatile recipe that uses ingredients you probably already have on hand.

Now for the changes...
I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, and apple sauce instead of oil. I didn't have wheat germ so left it out. My family doesn't like things very sweet so I halved the sugar and glazed the top with honey about 5 minutes before they were done to make it shiny with just a hint of sweetness. They were nice and chewy but crispy on top when I made them about 1/2 inch thick, and didn't take 30minutes to be done (maybe if you want them crunchier?).  

Also, instead of raisins I used what I had on hand: dried cranberries, coconut flakes, sliced almonds, and pumpkin seeds. I also added almond extract just for kicks.

Next time I make this, I'd like to try with a little more oats and a little less flour. We'll see how that goes :)...

My husband and I both think these are great, and they also smell fantastic while baking. I kept everything the same, but I didn't have wheat germ so I subbed wheat flour. I also added about a half cup chocolate chips with the raisins. The "dough"is extremely sticky, so I used wax paper to pat it more evenly into the pan. They also took slightly less time than the recipe calls for....about 25 minutes. These are right in the middle of chewy and crunchy. I'm sure I will make them again and again.

What an excellent recipe. I doubled the recipe and used my commercial size cookie sheet.  When I first was cutting them, I thought "oh no".  This is not what I was expecting.  But as the bars cooled, it was exactly what I wanted.  The recipe is a great base for a granola bar and the variations but added other ingredients allows you to make so many variations.  Thanks for sharing this treasure!!

I made several changes to this recipe but only to make it a healthy, wholesome snack.  Instead of using brown sugar I used succinate, white whole wheat flour in place of AP flour, and coconut oil instead of veggie oil.  I also added craisins and a few chopped pecans. The combination exchanges are limitless.  I love this granola bar and my grandkids (who are very picky) gobbled them up within minutes of me presenting them.

My family loves these bars in all it's forms!  Best hint I found was to add veg oil first then honey (so honey doesn't stick to measuring cup), you can use applesauce, choc & white chips, bananas, peanut butter, almonds ... Anything! It's the ratatouille of granola bars!

I took parts of the initial recipe and other reviewers suggestions. Here is what I ended up doing: 1 1/2 cups rice crispy cereal, 2 cups oats, 1 cup raisins, 1/3 cup packed brown sugar, 1/2 cup honey, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1/4 cup sliced almonds, 1/4 cup chopped pecans , 1/4 cup wheat germ, 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 2 eggs (used egg whites), 1 cup applesauce, 1/4 tsp allspice, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup all-purpose flour. I also sprinkled some more almonds onto the top and gently pushed them in the "dough". Cooked in my convection oven at 350 for 23 minutes. They're very chewy on the inside and so yummy. My son who hates raisins and nuts just ate 3 bars!

These are great.  They stayed nice and chewy for days.  I wrapped them individually in plastic wrap and placed in air tight container.  I added flax seed, chai seeds, coconut, whole wheat flour instead of white and coconut oil instead of veg oil.  I added mini dark chocolate chips and reduced he raisins a little.  I did leave about an inch on each end to make the bars thicker.  Make sure they are cut while warm.

Very Yummy!  I followed another reader's suggestion as I am diabetic.  I substituted 1/4 c + 2 Tbls Splenda Brown Sugar for the brown sugar and I substituted 1/3 cup Agave for the honey, I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil and Whole wheat flour for all- purpose.  I added 1/8 tsp of baking powder.  I also threw in some almonds and just a few dried cranberries.  It was good, next time I might cut back on the Agave a little more as it was a little sweet.  Thanks though for the great recipe and other readers changes!

Good, I subbed craisins for raisins and did 1/4 c. veg oil and 1/4 c. applesauce and used ground flax in place of wheat germ.  All in all very good and all the kids agreed! Edit:  I have made these at least 5 times now.  I've added chocolate chips, but honestly prefer them without.  I also use wheat flour in place of white.  And with reading other reviews, I found that if you don't press them to the edges of the pan, instead leave about a 1/2 inch border all around, they turn out much better.

Easy to make and delicious!  I omit the raisins and add 1/4 C mini chocolate chips and 1/4 C sunflower seeds.  I also decrease the brown sugar to 1/2 C and they are plenty sweet.  Instead of wheat germ, I use ground flax seed.

I like these because they are everything the "Gobble Up Granola Snacks" mentioned by another reviewer are not.  Healthy, packed with whole grains and peanut free.  A huge bonus in our house, or when taking snacks somewhere else.  I'll take whole grains and dried fruit over puffed white rice, corn syrup and peanut butter any day.

These are delicious! I would recommend this recipe.  I added a few things to make it even more healthful...chopped walnuts and almonds, 1/2 cup milled flax seed, 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice, 1/2 cup apple sauce (because it seemed dry).  I used stone ground whole wheat flour, old fashioned oats, clover honey, and canola oil.  I love how moist these are!  They are like eating a healthy oatmeal cookie!

This recipe is exactly what I was looking for! I too cooked for a bit less time (just under 25 min.), and mine are nice and chewy.  Thanks for submitting this recipe!

This was a great recipe. I made it with 1/2 the honey and I didn't have wheat germ.  Used trail mix instead of jut raisins. Took it out at 20 min just as the edges were turning brown. They are chewy and gooey. 
Husband lives it. As does my 6 yr old very picker eater. It's a keeper. 
Can mix in all kinds of goodness.

Love these!  I use whole wheat flour and line the pan with parchment paper so they're easy to remove from the pan for slicing.  I think they're better the next day!  I will try some of the variations next time.  I put them in my husband's lunch at seeding/harvest time.

My 5 year old daughter loves these.  I make them with chocolate chips though and replace the wheat germ with Flax seeds.  Her school is nut free so these are great for her lunch box snack.

I followed the core recipe pretty closely, and doubled it so I could use a jelly roll pan (and because I have six people in my family, including four avid granola bar eaters).

I used whole wheat flour instead of white, and coconut oil instead of vegetable.  I used 2 Tbsp. vanilla (probably very slightly too much-would try 5 tsp next time).  I used peanut butter (a little more than 1/2 c for the doubled recipe), and therefore only used a drizzle of honey.  I used 1 1/2c. chocolate chips.  I omitted cinnamon.  It was a little too salty (I used natural peanut butter, so that would not have added any), so I would reduce that next time.  I also used 1 c. brown sugar (for doubled recipe).  I'm a sucker for things right out of the oven, and the taste was good then-we'll see how it tastes and how crunchy they are when cooled.  I am also eager to try a fruit and nut version with sunflower seeds, dried cranberries, and almonds.  In that case, I'll use the full amount of honey.  Not sure about the cinnamon with those other ingredients.  Thanks for the recipe!

Love these granola bars.  We add coconut to them along with dark choc. chips.  I only bake them for 20 minutes so that they are chewy.  I also replace wheat germ with toasted flax seed.  Can't get enough of these!!

Great recipe, I lowered the oil to 1/3 c and used olive oil instead of vegetable, lowered the sugar to 1/3 c and honey to 1/3 c, added 1/2 c of unsweetened applesauce and raised the cinnamon to 1tsp. I added an extra spoon of vanilla, 3/4 of raisins, and I used whole wheat flour instead of regular. Next time I probably wont use oil at all, except in the pan. From others' suggestions, I only cooked it for 18min, and they tuned out moist and delicious.  I didn't have any wheat germ, so I took a protein cereal and ground it in a nut grinder and used that instead an it worked out great.

Great basic recipe that you can adjust to your families needs. I add coconut and dark chocolate chips. They stay soft for me and disappear quick! I double and spread out in a cookie sheet that has 1 inch sides. They come out thick but I just cut them smaller, doesn't matter, they are gone within days.

For those of you looking for a low-fat treat DO NOT use just applesauce. I used one cup of applesauce and whole wheat flour and they turned out so dense and not flavorful at all (with the whole wheat flour and reduced br sugar). So sorry I messed with this recipe now. I was looking forward to eating it! I will have to try this out without modifications next time.

Awesome starter recipe!  I made the following changes:
- Used only 1/2 c sugar
- Craisins instead of raisins
- No honey
- Instead of oil, I used 1/2 c crunchy peanut butter and 3/4 of a small banana
- I added 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce
- Added 3/4 c of mini, semi-sweet chocolate chips

The granola bars are incredibly chewy and absolutely delicious.  I baked them for only 20 minutes - just until the edges started to brown.  Yum!

Also, when I put my recipe into Weight Watchers, for 24 servings, the bars are 4 pointsplus per serving.  Enjoy!!!

This is my second time I made the recipe. Always split them into 2 parts, one with raisin and one with choc chips. Put them side by side in one pan because they are not runny. Cut down the sugar to 1/3 only and use whole wheat fluor. Hmmm, can't wait to cut them...

These are GREAT!! I did a few changes - like brown rice flour & ground flax seed instead of wheat germ. For the fruits I used chopped dried apricots along with walnuts. On some I drizzled a bit of melted white chocolate chips  - they were good that way - but really didn't need it.  I have tried several granola bars recipes - so far this is my all time favorite!! My changes were personal - I doubt they changed the flavor of the bars much at all - maybe the texture a bit. Thanks!!

As is, this is a GREAT recipe! After making them many times, I've come up with a version that suits my family the best. I cut the brown sugar down to 1/4 of a cup, 3/4 is overkill along with the honey. I use whole wheat pastry flour in place of all purpose. I also use fewer raisins, 3/4 c. is overkill again. I use 1/4 cup of cinnamon applesauce in place of the egg (so no egg). Then add lots of natural peanut butter. So I've turned this recipe into a very wholesome, nutritious, vegan snack that we all devour. I need to make them twice a week! But I'm serious when I say that the original recipe is great ;o)

More like a thick oatmeal cookie than a granola bar.  I baked mine only 25 mins. and they stayed nice and chewy.  A plastic knife cut the bars better than stainless.  Too sweet for my taste.  Next time I'll reduce brown sugar to 1/2 cup and add dried cranberries and almonds.  Will also try cutting the oil by half with applesauce, using whole wheat flour and ground flax seed to increase nutritional value.

These were awesome! i tweaked the recipe a little so im not sure how it would have went if i didnt add the little tweaks in, but boy am i glad i did! First off instead of the all purpose flour i used whole wheat pastry flour(1 cup). I used the big grain brown sugar because thats what i had and it subsituted very well. I also only used 1/2 cup of the big grain cane sugar). I increased the cinnamon to 1t. i used 1/4 c of craisins and equal parts raisins(1/2 c total of both). I used 1/4 c of local raw honey and 1/4 c of maple grade A organic maple syrup. 2 eggs instead of 1 because all of the extra ingredients i was using. And in my food processor i chop up about a handful of mixed almonds and walnuts also chopped some banana chips together(sorry i just eyeballed the almonds, walnuts, and bananas...no exact measurements). I also threw in some shredded coconut (no measurement). OHH and how can i forget?! I used one vanilla pod and scrapped out all the vanilla seeds out the vanilla pod(some may know it as a vanilla bean but the correct terminology is a vanilla pod), therefore i cut the vanilla extract back down to 1t. in all this was so tasty. i cant wait to come up with the next concoction for this recipe. just to note im a huge sweet lover and this was sweet. if wanted- the sugar and honey and maple syrup could be scaled back more than I did.

These were very good.  More like a granola cookie but delicious just the same.  I replaced the AP flour with whole wheat and changed the oil to liquid lecithin.  I added a generous amount of Benefiber to up the health factor.  I used egg beaters also.  Kids chose to add walnuts and some finely diced apple pieces that we precooked in the microwave for a few minutes just to soften a bit.  Easy recipe to change up or use up what you have on hand.  Already have ideas for the next batch!

Awesome!! I just made these, it was my first take at making homemade granola bars!! I used WW flour instead of white and lowered the brown sugar to 1/2 cup, and used mini choc chips instead of raisins- which I didn't have.  Very good!! I can't wait to make more with different items and I will try using some applesauce to cut back on the oil!

Just made some of these- so yummy! Family loved them too and they smelled great when baking! I ran out of honey so I used about half honey half maple syrup, 1 tsp of cinnamon, and 1/3 cup of brown sugar, but it was still plenty sweet. Can't wait to try variations of it!

This is a great recipe - I reduced the brown sugar to 1/2cup and usually add chocolate chips instead of raisins, but this recipe is very easy to change out things and it still turns out great.  I like them a bit thinner so I spread it the full amount of a 9x13 pan.  The kids LOVE these.  Much healthier and cheaper than store-bought.

The first time I made these, I used 1 cup of apple sauce instead of canola oil and 3 cups of oats. The bars tasted ok, but their texture was rubbery. The second time I made these, I did them in two batches, the first using canola oil and the second using apple sauce again.

Definitely, DEFINITELY, go with the canola oil. It produces a much better texture.

I tried several granola bar recipes before settling with this one. LOVE IT! I have low-blood sugar problems and these are a healthy option to keep me going until the next meal. I can def feel the difference when snacking on these vs. chips/cookies. We sub the wheat germ for chopped cashew/almonds/peanuts and add banana chips too.

The first time I made this I forgot to add the flour!!  So the next time I made it I made sure I added the flour and it turns out my husband and I like it better without the flour!! The flour made the granola bars soooo dry.  With out the flour it was really most and instead of raisins we used chocolate chips and the flavor was really good.  Next time I will use only 1/3 or 1/2 cup of flour instead of a whole cup.

This is my first time to make granola bars.  I just finished making them and they are really great.  I bought a mix of dried fruits and then added a mix of nuts (soy nuts, almonds, sunflower seeds).  I think I cooked a little too long...the edges started to darkly brown.  Next time I will cook for 25 minutes.  Also, will bake on parchment paper next to make for easy removal from pan.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe has changed our lives. I've been making this weekly for about two months now and I have not bought a single box of granola bars since. They are so easy to make I can do so in the morning before work and the ability to play and customize it is the best part. Thank you so much for this recipe!

My sister-in-law gave me this recipe many moons ago.  It is a regular staple in our house.  I make a batch on the weekends and then we eat them for breakfast on-the-go through out the week.  We have also tried adding dried cherries or cranberries in lieu of the raisins and it is very good!

This was my first time even making granola bars.  I am impressed:  hearty, delicious, soft and chewy.  They're a great hold-me-over snack!  (No kids or playground needed.)

I am vey pleased with this recipe.  I used gluten free flour and apricots instead of raisins.  I even used an egg substitute.  We have someone with a lot of allergies and I really had to tweak it and it still turned out great!

Love this recipe!  I'm allergic to cinnamon, so this prevents me from buying store bought granola bars.  I took the advice of one reviewer and only baked them for about 18 minutes, cooled for 10 minutes, cut into bars, and allowed them to cool completely before removing them. They were delicious and chewy!  I look forward to making them again with different dried fruit. I will never buy store bought again!!

This is a great find that always turns out delicious! The only problem with them is-in our house they're eaten while they're still cooling so they don't last long.

This is my favorite granola bar recipe.  It is so versatile, you can add or omit whatever suits your taste of the day.  I usually add 1/2 cup applesauce, replace the wheat germ with ground flax seed, add some (eyeball it) walnuts, almonds, unsweetened coconut flakes, and dark chocolate chips.  I also replace the flour with gluten-free flour and add a 1/2 tsp. xanthan gum.  They come out great and the whole family loves them.

I cooked it for 25 minutes with no convection on. it really seemed undercooked when I pulled it out of the oven. But it turned out perfect. I added chocolate chips, sunflower seeds and ground flaxseeds. I added half a cup of brown sugar and no wheat germ.

I used this recipe for my Jr. High cooking class.  We added the 1/2 cup of applesauce that someone else suggested and the kids loved it! By adding the applesauce it made almost a cookie consistancy.  If you want a crisper granola bar, make the recipe as is or maybe only add 1/4 c. of applesauce.
Can't wait to try this with whole wheat flour!!

These are not at all what I hoped. They are like a dry lifeless oatmeal cookie. I'll keep looking for something that is more like a real granola bar.

This is an awesome recipe to build on. I only gave it 4 stars because it is WAY too sweet if you use 3/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup honey. It takes it straight into the "super sweet dessert" category in my house, and I like to serve these to my kids as a snack. The changes I make: 2 1/2 cup rolled oats, 1/4 cup brown sugar, no wheat germ, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1 cup whole wheat flour, no raisins, 1/4 cup honey, 1/4 cup pure maple syrup, 1 egg white and 1/2 egg yolk, 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/4 cup canola oil, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract. We like chocolate chips and almond slivers in ours, but you can really add any dried fruit or nut you like. I used to always bake the full 30 minutes, but I am finding that 20 minutes is PERFECT for a bar that is similar to store-bought texture.

Ella has a perfect review and drives my point home perfectly - do not over bake. While they are still yummy, I over baked them then of course didn't read directions & let them cool in the pan. I will most definitely do over once we eat these up, cuz they are an easy, tasty & healthy alternative to chemical & sugar laden commerical granola bars.  I honestly don't see those in my shopping cart again!

This is hands down the best recipe period I have ever made as far as meeting my expectations, and not needing any changes.

I've put a twist on it by adding banana chuncks and chocolate chips, strawberries, apricots, you name it, we've made it.

I make army sized quantities and freeze them pre-cut, so at snack time I just have to take one out of the freezer and microwave it for 30 seconds.

My 4-year-old prefers these to store bought- now THAT is saying something!

I really did not like these at all.  They need something to make them crispy. They are very much like a cakey sort of bar and bland.  I made another batch from a recipe on another site and it used rice crispies and it was much much better.

My kids love these. I've tried a few variations, and our favorite version is: 1/2 cup of chocolate chips instead of the raisins, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup flaxseed meal instead of the all-purpose flour, and only 1/2 cup of brown sugar.

Very good! I made a few changes based on the reviews. I added 1/2 cup of applesauce along with the oil called for, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 cup chocolate chips and 1/2 cup dried cranberries instead of raisins. I cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup, but I think no sugar would taste just fine since there is plenty of honey in it already. Also, it only filled my 13x9 pan 3/4 of the way, so next time I need to figure out what to do about that?? A little too sweet still, but delicious!!

I love this recipe - I followed someone's advice about using less brown sugar and it was great!  I also substituted flaxseed instead of wheat germ.  Most importantly I highly recommend NOT using your hands - nonstick spatula worked great, the first time when I used my hands was a sticky disaster!!

These are very easy to throw together for snacks or to pack in lunches! You can really mix and match different ingredients if you like. For example, I used ground flax seed instead of wheat germ and a little less sugar. I also added in some coconut and almonds instead of raisins. It's a great base to play around with. I have also made them the exact way the recipe says and they were still fantastic. I did take someone's advice and took them out early. I like a softer granola bar and my oven runs hot so 15 minutes were all mine took! These are now a staple!

I thought this was a great recipe base!  The only thing I suggest is that for people who don't like things very sweet, I cut back on the brown sugar and honey and still found it too sweet since there are raisins, and I had also added dates. 
Yum!

These are wonderful!  My husband and daughter really enjoyed them and I can see this as a weekday morning staple in our home.

Made some minor changes based on what i had in the house:  (1) subbed applesauce for oil, (2) cut brown sugar down to 1/2 cup and will reduce even more next time, (3) left out vanilla extract (4) added one packet of 'strawberries and cream' instant oatmeal for slight berry flavor, (5) brushed top with honey and returned to oven for the last 5 minutes.

[Note:  did a second batch because the first disappeared in a day, and used peanut butter, raisins and walnuts - delicious!!]

My husband thought these were absolutely amazing and asked me to make them again for him to take to work as a mid-morning snack.

These were awesome!  I also followed others recommedations of: using whole wheat flour, canola oil, and reducing the brown sugar to 1/2 cup, adding 1 tsp. cinnamon and a whole cup of cranberries and not spreading all the way out in a 9x13 pan, and only cooking about 20 minutes.

These only get four stars because I tweaked them so much to my personal taste that they hardly resemble the original recipe. However, this is a great base to work off of and without it, I'd still be buying the store-bought stuff. I go with 3 cups rolled outs, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, 1 cup sliced almonds, 3/4 teaspoon cinnamon, 1 cup dried fruit (I like the Trader Joe's mix of raisins, blueberries and golden raisins), 1/2 tsp salt, NO honey, 1 beaten egg, 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract and two large mashed bananas. The bananas add a little sweetness and cut out the oil. The result is a chewy granola bar with less fat and more healthy stuff. Thanks Pregocook for giving us a fantastic base!

These were my first granola bar attempt. They were okay, but I've moved on. The flour addition makes them more like a cookie.

This is the first granola recipe i tried (excluding the wheat germ) so to me its like to foundation for ALL the OTHER creations ive made since.  Thank you so much because it was easy enough and I had all the ingredients in my cabinets/fridge.  They are very tasty and i usually add flax seed in it as well.

I sent these granola bars to my boyfriend in Afghanistan. They stayed fresh the whole way over there, and were a big hit in his shop! They got eaten even before the cookies I sent did. I added carob chips for an extra sweet treat. :) If you are looking for a recipe to ship I highly recommend this one, I just made my second batch to ship overseas!

The BEST!  My girlfriend gave me this recipe and I have passed it on to all of my friends!  I substitue ground flax seed for the wheat germ, apple sauce for the vegetable oil, and whole wheat flour in place of the all purpose flour.  Also, where it calls for raisins, you can use mini chocolate chips, craisins, or whatever your family loves!  ENJOY!!

I made this recipe twice:  The first time I took someone's advice and added 3/4 peanut butter and 1/4 cup applesauce instead of the 1/2 cup oil.  This made the texture of the bar like a protein bar.  The second time I made it, I added 1/4 c peanut butter and 1/4 c applesauce.  I also replaced the raisins with chocolate chips.  These were a winner!!!  Great recipe!

Just what I was looking for! Very good recipe and very versatile to boot. We spend a fortune in granola bars. I made a double batch. I followed others suggestions; altered the sugar, used less and it was Splenda, added extra raisins along with dried cranberries!  I wish I had wheat germ, didn't, used ground flax seed. All a good idea if you ask me. I would of put wheat germ in to if I had it. Walnuts a plenty. Upped it. Half whole, half chopped for a different texture. Lastly I really wanted a dense bar, so when I put the batter in the baking pan I packed it down pretty hard. Perfect. I thought about peanut butter. Next time! I am adding on to my review 2 weeks later. Made this batch halving the oil with applesauce. Still came out very good, not quite as great but if you are looking to cut calories works fine. Still going to try peanut butter!

Can't say enough how good these are-I followed other reviews suggestions to reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup, used whole wheat flower, and added both dried cranberries and apricots to the fruit (and added 2x the fruit) Soooo good. I'm making them again tomorrow and plan to try adding a little orange zest into the mix.

A shout out to Chef Joy for great advice: whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup applesauce and canola oil for a great consistency. I'd like to add butterscotch chips for that extra kick of sweetness that I look for in a snack. Also, just a tip: measure the oil BEFORE the honey and the honey will slip right on outta the cup!

just made them..... took advice from other reviews and used 1/3 cup brown sugar, and sub. applesauce for oil and nixed honey and just put some more applesauce in. then took raisins out and added dark chco chips and dried cranberries!cooked for 20 mins in my oven. They are dense( which I like), and not very sweet since I took the honey out(on accident...) so I think I will drizzle some on top! The choc chips and cranberries add the needed sweetness though! Will make again! Next time, who nows what I will do!!

Greeeeeeeeeeeeat recipe. I followed other users' suggestions and my granola bars came out REALLY good! Lowered the brown sugar to 1/2 cup, added 1/4 cup peanut butter & 1/3 cup pumpkin seeds; didn't spread the batter onto the whole 9x13 baking sheet, instead, I did a half an inch height / 9"x9" square (it stays exactly where you extend it) and baked it for 25 minutes. Delicious granola bars!

So far, the best granola bar recipe I've tried.  Stayed VERY moist and delicious and freeze well.  I used half oil and half apple juice and it worekd just fine.  I used dried cherries and a few white chocolate pieces to make the kids happy.  Everyone loves these!!!

We liked this recipe.  It wasn't too sweet at all. Instead of just raisins I substituted a 6 oz bag of trail mix. I used a 3/4 cup of applesauce as others suggested and they stayed chewy and soft.  I will add peanut butter to the next batch without the applesauce- so they'll be a little crunchier.

These are not bad, but not great.  The batter was so sticky and wet I would not reccommend mixing it by hand.  I added semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of raisins.  Also, even by reducing the sugar to 1/3 cup they are still too sweet.  You could probably omit the sugar altogether and just use the sweetness of the honey.  Or go 1/3 cup sugar and 1/4 cup honey.
The bars are also 'cakey' not really like a granola bar.  I think I will try these again, but use less flour and omit the sugar.  On the plus side, my kids really like them.

These just came out of the oven and they smelled so good that we couldn't wait to try them. They're delicious! I made them with several tweaks to the recipe after reading several suggestions in others' reviews. I cut the brown sugar down to 1/3 c., replaced the wheat germ with 1/4 c. of milled flax seed, cut the flour down to 1/2 c. whole wheat pastry flour, replaced the raisins with chopped dried apricots and cherries, cut the salt down to 1/2 tsp., cut the honey down to 1/4 c., and replaced half of the vegetable oil with no sugar applesauce. I also added a handful of mini chocolate chips and baked them only 18 minutes for a chewier bar. They are still plenty sweet for my taste and I'll cut back on the sugar even more next time. My 2 1/2 year old keeps asking for more and I'm having trouble staying away from them too! Thanks for the great recipe! It will be a good one to alter for variety.

These were really good except I used flavored raisins I found at my grocery store and they burnt.  I'm not sure how to stop this from happening and its frustrating to pick them out.

This is one of my family's favorite recipes.  I make it at least once a week.  They are easy, delicious, and nutritious.  I have played with the ingredients, and they are always good.  Our favorite version is doubling the recipe using a 1 lb. bag of "Bob's Red Mill 5 Grain Hot Cereal" for the rolled oats and adding 1/2-1 cup coconut. It is our favorite breakfast and take-along snack.

These are great!  They satisfy my mid-afternoon urge for chocolate in a healthy filling way.  The only changes I made:  WW flour,reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup, added 3/4 cup coarsely chopped toasted almonds along with the raisins  (the raisins add sweetness).  Next time I may add craisins or dried cranberries for a change, although these are perfect as they are!  Thanks for a great healthy and tasty recipe!

My 3 year old and 1 year old loved these! We didn't have raisons, though, so we used the dried mix of pineapple, mango and papaya that you can buy in the raison section of the grocery store, and then added 3/4 C of shredded coconut. AWESOME!!

I found this recipe to be ok. I like crunchy granola bars and these were chewy like a bar cookie but none the less me my husband and my twin 18 mo. olds enjoyed them. Couldn't convince the thre year old though. The only change I made was to add craisins instead of raisins.

Incredible. The kids loved them more than any store bought brand! Took some other reviewers advice though. Used whole wheat flour, only 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 cup craisins, and added 1/2 cup apple sauce for moisture. Baked for only 25 minutes. Will use an 8x8 pan next time. Delicious, filling, and a great snack for skiing and show shoeing!

I followed everything except I used less sugar, (less than 1/3 cup) and I used oat flour! Much healthier. They came out just  perfect! Oat flour is easy to make. Just pulverize some old fashioned oats in a food processor or even a blender until you see that the oats have became kind of flour like. I substitute this cup of oat flour with the regular flour needed here. And then obviously just follow the rest of the recipe, including the other 2 cups of oats. I've made these twice, and once I didn't have enough honey so I used some natural PB and they still came out great!

These were great.  I used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 white flour and used dried apricots instead of raisins. I added 1/4 cup chopped pistachios.  This is a great base recipe to customize to your tastes as many other reviewers have done.

My husband loves these! The only change I made was I used 1/2 cup of applesauce instead of the oil. I also did not bake them as long as the directions said to, we like our granola bars chewy.

This recipe certainly doesn't need a another rave but it deserves one.  This is a fantastic jumping off point for creating numerous types of delicious granola bars.  I have made them with mashed bananas or applesauce in lieu of oil and peanut butter or almond butter as opposed to the egg.  A touch of coconut oil is great.  I've added cranberries, many types of nut, coconut and chocolate chips.  Hint: reduce the sugar.  I find they are pretty sweet particularly if you add chocolate chips or dried fruit like raisins or berries.  I general use maybe a quarter cup of brown sugar and 1/3 cup honey or less.  Even then I questioned: is this too sweet for breakfast?  Also, definitely use whole wheat flour and you sub out any number of items for the wheat germ or part of the flour - oat bran, almond meal, cashew meal.  The options are endless!

Awesome.  Used whole wheat flour and only 1/3 C brown sugar.  Subbed oat bran and ground flax seed for wheat germ.  Added sunflower seeds, walnuts, almonds, dried cranberries, chocolate chips.  Where have these been all my life?

Perfect! I only made a few changes - (1) did not have wheat germ, used All-Bran cereal instead, (2) used Craisins instead of raisins, and (3) spread thin layer home-made blueberry spread on top prior to baking.  They stayed chewy after cooling and are so yummy!

Tried these for the first time today--yum! I have a son who's allergic to wheat, so I substituted oat and quinoa flours for the all-purpose flour and flaxseed and amaranth for the wheat germ. The amaranth is still a little crunchier than I'd prefer, but the rest of my family liked it. The higher protein content of the quinoa & amaranth makes these very satisfying, filling bars. I also substitued some chopped prunes for some of the raisins, and that combo tastes good. The only thing I'm not crazy about with these is that the high oil content leaves your fingers a little greasy afterward. But that's not a deal-breaker yet.I'm going to try these next time with some chopped pecans.

Yummy! I swapped out the wheat germ for flax meal and added a few tablespoons of brewers yeast to make these into Lactation Granola Bars. Also added a teaspoon of baking soda so they puffed up a bit like a cookie.

These turned out very "cakey" and not like granola bars. They were dry and crumbly and I didn't care for the taste.

Adding pumpkin is good! Per other reviewers and my own changes - cut br sugar to 1/2c, more cin to 1 heaping tsp, more vanilla to 1 tbs, for the 1/2c oil, I used 1/4 oil and 1/4 applesauce. Used 1/2 ap flour, 1/2 ww. 1c quick/instant oats, about 1 1/2c reg rolled oats. 1/4 tsp nutmeg and a few dashes clove. 1c pumpkin. Didn't have wheat germ, so used 1/2c milled flax seed. Baked only 20 min. Yum! *update, also tried 1/4 oil 1/4 applesauce, then extra 1/2c applesauce ..and about 1 cup/2 apples cloarsly shredded with everything else as above (except pumpkin).. awesome stuff

We love these! These are wonderful as the recipe is written, but I do add 1/3 c. of chocolate chips and 1/3 c. chopped pecans to the dry mix, and lessen the amount of brown sugar to 1/2 c.  Everyone loves these.

These are very good bars, my kids love them!  I followed the recipe exactly the first few times and they were just fine.  Since then I've cut the brown sugar to 1/2c and subbed coconut oil for the vegetable oil.  I've also sometimes switched it up and added chocolate chips (instead of raisins) and peanut butter instead of honey.  Overall, very good basic recipe that you can expand on to mix it up every now and then!

These are delicious, and very versatile. I followed some tips from other users and threw in 2 mashed bananas, dropped the sugar down to 1/2 cup, subbed coconut oil for vegetable, flax seed meal for half the wheat germ, and put in 3/4 cup mini chocolate chips. DIVINE! My kids inhaled them, and I sneaked several - yum! I have made them with pumpkin and pumpkin pie spice and walnuts as well, and applesauce and diced apple with apple pie spice, also delish. I also recommend baking for only about 18-20 minutes and leaving an inch and a half - 2 inches at the end of the pan, it will still hold its shape and the bars are the perfect thickness that way. Definitely give these a try!

So yummy!  I freeze them and then heat up in the micro when I want a snack.   I made them even healthier this way:
Reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup.  Used wheat flour instead of white.  Used unsweetened applesauce instead of oil.  Omitted raisins.  Added 1/2 cup craisins, 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips, 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.

I love this recipe! The first time I made it just like it's written minus 10 minutes on the cooking time so they would be softer. The family ate them and loved them. The last time I used dried cherries and chocolate chips. Amazing! One of the best granola bar recipes I have ever used.

I can't say enough good things about these bars. I have picky breakfast eaters - 19 mos and 3 yrs old - and they DEVOUR these. I have been making them at least once a week since I discovered the recipe. Well done!!

Good basic starter for granola bars. I decreased the brown sugar to 1/2 cup as others suggested. I doubled the cinnamon and 1 tbsp vanilla extract. I found them to be a bit dry/bland but I really think that can be fixed by adding 1 cup of raisins/craisins instead of 3/4 cup. And for sure, even in my old oven, the baking time is too long!

I've made several other granola bars and wanted to try a new one.  This one had such good reviews, I thought why not?  Very big disappointment.  These were more cake/cookie-like than granola bar-like.  I did undercook it by 5 minutes since I halved the recipe.  It may be why it tasted more cookie-like, but the taste itself was not great.

Yum!

I upped the oats the 3 cups, used whole wheat flour instead of white, used only 1/3 cup oil, added 1 cup apple sauce, used closer to 1.5 tsp salt, added craisins and almonds and 1/4 tsp almond extract. I also used 1 tbsp cinnamon and then quite a bit of pumpkin pie spice (to taste) because I love it! Baked for about 20 min, then sprinkled with salt/brown sugar and topped with a bit of butter spray, then broiled for just a min or so. . . until golden brown. Watch it closely or it will burn!

Soo good! It seems pretty flexible too. . . I'll definitely try this again and again with peanut butter, coconut, pecans, mashed bananas, pumpkin puree, different spices, etc. . . Thanks for an awesome recipe! :)

These are okay....don't mix with your hands - what a mess.  Tried taking mine out at 18 min, definitely not done enough in the middle, only around the edges.  Baked approx 29 minutes instead.  Not my favorite granola bar recipe, but one of the healthier ones I have tried.  May play around with it though.

Cant stop eating these!  The texture of the mix before baking, was odd to me-- had to "press" it into the pan...but don't let that stop you.  So good!   They firm up more the second day...we like these good and chewy!  thanks for this recipe.

Excellent recipe! I do agree with other reviews in that they're a little too sweat, but I don't generally like 'oats and honey' flavored granola bars. I'm going to try and make a peanut butter version tonight.

We really enjoyed these. As others suggested, they are quite chewy out of the oven, but tend to dry overnight. I love the  base recipe tho! I've added choc. chips, marshmallows, dried fruit, etc. Thanks for sharing!

Diabetic recommendations:  I make these in several variations, however the sugars and honey are hard for my diabetic friends to handle.  I use Organic Blue Agave sweetener in place of honey.  You can purchase it at BJ's Wholesale club.  It has a naturally low Glycemic Index which means it is slowly absorbed by the body and does not cause the same rapid increase in blood sugar as sugar or honey.  I also substitute Splenda brown sugar for the brown sugar.  An important side note if using Splenda:  add 1/8tsp baking powder to the mix.  This is very important to achieve the texture and flavor you are looking for.  Also, don't forget to use 1cp unsweetened applesauce in place of the veg oil.  As always, whole wheat flour is better than all-purpose.  This seems like alot of work, but if you have anyone you know who is diabetic, they will love you forever.  Don't forget to add all the extras too.

I recommend adding 1/8 cup chopped walnuts, 1/8 chopped almonds, 1/4 cup flax seed, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, 2 ounces dark chocolate.  Also use dried blueberries instead of raisins.  You can also add another egg if you include all of the additional ingredients.

As recommended by everyone, I only used 1/4 cup honey, 1/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Added 1 cup Applesauce to make up for the liquid and sweetness. Baked for 30min at 175C but it was still gooey at the bottom (top was crisp). I baked for an extra 20min and it was much better :) The bottom was till a bit moist after cooling. I am taking a star out as it was not crunchy nor chewy but dry on top and moist on the bottom (in my opinion).

I loved them and so did my 2-year-old!  You weren't kidding though about them getting hard!  I will definitely cut them a little sooner next time.  Great recipe though :)

Great recipe.  Just what I was looking for, a substantial and healthy alternative to the granola bars I had been buying at the grocery store.  I did substitue 1/2 c. applesauce for 1/2 of the oil.  Decreased the brown sugar to 1/3 cup, added almonds, and increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp, with a pinch of alspice.  Baked for 18-20 minutes.  This is a keeper of a recipe -thanks for posting and sharing.  I have also made it as is was written, both options are great.  I have a hard time staying away from them.

These are a great base! I add in whatever dried fruit I have, plus some flax. I even threw in some almond flower once. I have also tried these with agave nectar with great results. I wrap them individually in press and seal.

Am I the only one who only had enough dough to fill the 9 x 13 pan halfway? Other than using 1 1/3 cups of whole wheat pastry flour instead of the regular flour and wheat germ, I didn't change a thing. My kids seem to enjoy them, so thats all that matter I guess!

This recipe is delicious and a great base for many types of granola bars.  I made them to take to work for lunch/snack, but didn't get many out of the house because they kept getting eaten!  I added pecans and almonds for some more crunch, and omitted the raisins.  Next time I want to add in some dried cranberries and ground flax seed.  Everyone in the house was raving about these bars, saying we could start selling them!  Will definitely be making them again

A dash of cloves was a great flavor booster! Tgis is a great starting point and easy to sub ingredients. I did decrease brown sugar to 1/2 c, and used applesauce instead of oil-personal preferences. They came out soft and chewy, but I mixed them really well so they would stick together.

I have made these several times.  I add 1/4 cup smooth peanut butter.  We love them.  After they are cool, I package them in "snack baggies" and they are a quick grab for breakfast on the run.

this is a great recipe!  My oven cooks a little hot so they came out a little crunchy, next time I'll take them out a few min sooner.   My 2 yr old who is a very picky eater loves these.  I left out the cinnamon and added chopped pecans and butterscotch chips.  I am going to make another batch today, can't decide what I'll add this time :)

I LOVE this recipe!  I customized it every time but use this recipe (minus teh raisins) as a base.  If I'm in a rush to make them I substitute the raisins for mini choc. chippits.  Today I added ground flax seed, a bit of extra honey, coconut and a bit of cocoa.  I don't buy granola bars  from the store so sometimes make a special treat version for the kids to eat.  They never last longer than four days in our house!

Great recipe!  I didn't have any wheat germ, so I subbed the same amount of finely crushed bran flakes.  I also used 1/2 all purpose flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour.  I felt that the bars would have been far too thin if I would have spread them over the entire 9x13 pan, so I left a couple of inches of space in order to make thicker bars.  They were very sweet, so I could see cutting back slightly on the brown sugar next time.  They stayed very moist and chewy when I stored them in a ziploc bag.

These are so amazing!!!  Followed the recipe as is and they turned out perfect!!!  I agree that I will have to triple the recipe too from now on to feed my 4 boys.  They can be very picky about my "homemade food" rather than store bought.  These are such high quality granola bars that I could never eat that cardboard stuff again!  One thing I may try next time is to reduce the honey because they were just a smidge too sweet for me.  AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Soooo excited!!!!!!!

OMG! Who needs cookies around when you have these little pieces of heaven. I'm always looking for something yummy for the kids to eat but they may not get them. I tweaked the recipe a little by reducing the sugar to 1/3c and the wheat germ to 1/4c adding 1/4c of ground flax seed to make up the full  1/2c the recipe calls for.  I used dried apples and cherries and added some cinnamon chips for fun. The other thing I did was use spelt flour instead of white since that's what I had. I will definatly be making these again.

These were very good! Mine came out a little rubbery, but I made a lot of modifications the first time. I believe it was substituting all the oil for apple sauce made it rubbery. But these were still good rubbery! Definetly a keeper. These are very versitile

Very delicious! My changes:   just under 1/2 c. brown sugar...used whole wheat flour instead of AP flour...1 tsp. cinnamon...1 c. mix of raisins and dried cranberries.
I only baked it for 20-25 minutes--till lightly browned and still soft in the center.  this way, the bars remain chewy instead of crunchy.

These are not only delicious, they're incredibly versatile and quick and easy to make. 

I made two batches. One the same as the recipe and the other I substituted chocolate chips for raisins. Next time, I'll skip the cinnamon if using choc chips. So many options for this recipe it's insane.

Based on other reviews, I reduced the cooking time to 18 minutes and the result was perfect soft and chewy granola bars. As soon as they were brown around the edge I took them out.

Update...I've modified this recipe to use Apple Sauce instead of Oil, Agave Nectar instead of honey, and substituted 1/4 of white flour for whole wheat flour. Couldn't tell the difference and made even more healthy...LOVE this recipe!

Sooooooooooooooo good! thank-you so much for this phenominal recipe using healthy ingredients! Very easy to make and made exactly as written......great directions. I did use overlapping parchment so I could just lift out to cut.....if you do this however, grab one end and slide out onto your cutting board, so they don't crack....mine did slightly but easily fixed being they were still warm. I waxed paper wrapped them individually for my husband to take to work to eat on the run. Next time I will experiment with grains as well as other fruits, nuts, and perhaps mini chocolate chips. Thanks again!

Great recipe!! My kids loved them. I use whole wheat flour instead of the white, reduce brown sugar to half a cup, also 1/4 c applesauce and 1/4 cup oil.  I used dark chocolate covered PlumSweet prune bits  this time instead of raisins, but my kids love them with just about anything mixed in!

I've been making these bars for a while and finally the last time I was actually managed to cut them into bars instead of just crumbles. I think what helped was making them smaller in the pan like another reviewer suggested and another thing I did is reduced the temperature of the oven to 325. I've been adding a mixture of raisins and chocolate chips but I can see how one can play around with that. I love them and the kids like them so definitely 5 starts. Update: after making them a few times more lowering the sugar content works for us better. I only use 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of honey and they come out perfect!

These are so yummy.  I cooked for less time so they'd be softer.  I use part applesauce and part oil.  I used only 1/2 cup sugar but added mini choc chips.  I also used whole wheat flour.  Delicious. 
*** I've made these many times and my family loves them.  I've started making a batch and a half, and it fits perfectly in a 9x13 pan (so they're a little thicker and softer). I use less vanilla...the first time I used it as listed in the recipe and it was way too much, but it may be that mine is very strong.  Sometimes I add dried cranberries to the raisins and choc chips.  You can easily tweak it the recipe to your tastes.  Next time I might use maple syrup instead of honey for another variation.  Easy and tasty!

These are great. My husband couldn't stop eating them. They do, however, get hard easily, so be sure not to overbake them and cut them while warm.

Great recipe!  Kids loved these!  I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of substituting mini chocolate chips for the raisins.  I also used whole wheat pastry flour instead of white.  They freeze well, so it's easy to make more than one batch at a time.  Tonight when I make them, I am going to try 1/4 cup ground flax seed and 1/4 cup wheat germ, instead of all wheat germ.  I am so happy to have a homemade substitute for the grocery store granola bars that are full of unwanted ingredients!!!  Thank you for the recipe!

Excellent!  Very forgiving recipe and easy to modify to suit your taste.   I didn't follow the recipe exactly and used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour (to make them less dry),  1/4 cup wheat germ, 1/4 cup ground flaxseed, 2Tbsp sunflower seeds, 2-3Tbsp coconut, 2-3Tbsp mini choco chips, 1/2 Cup raisins/craisins combo, 1/4 cup agave syrup, 1/4 cup honey and cut down the brown sugar to 1/3cup.  It was sweet enough for the kids to enjoy due to the choco chips and dried fruit. To keep bars intact, I underbaked them slightly, cut the bars warm and did not remove them from the pan until completely cool.

These are so good! I made these thinking I could save money, but I just knew they weren't going to be as good as store bought, but I was wrong, these are way better!!! I used wheat flour, 1/2 c brown sugar, 1 c raisins, 1/4 c chocolate chips and 1/2 c pecan pieces, omitted vanilla. Talk about addictive!

I made these using craisins and pecans.  I also took the advice of others and added 1/2 C applesauce.  Everyone who tasted these absolutely loved them!  I am preparing to make two batches, one craisin & pecan and the other, dried apple cinnamon.  The possibilities are endless!  Thanks for the recipe.  Love it!

Just made these for my kids while they were out playing in the snow.  They are delicious!  I will have  a hard time not eating them all myself!  I followed the recipe and added mini chocolate chips (1/4 to a 1/2 cup) and about 1/2 cup of rice crispies.  Delicious!!!

Impressed!  I added the applesauce like someone else mentioned to ensure they stay together better and they are perfect.  I also put coconut and choco chips just for our personal preference.  Another recipe I was using had condensed milk in it but with a child being dairy free this recipe is much better (and healthier).  Will totally make again!

This recipe makes a pretty decent granola bar.  I added about a cup of Rice Krispies, just for extra crunch. My son and his buddies love them.  They have been my breakfast quite a few days.

Very good recipe! A keeper in my recipe box. Certain ingredients can be substituted to taste. I have made them twice already. My favorite was cranberries and almonds w/ chocolate drizzle on top. I only use 1/2 cup brown sugar. And next time I will try using applesauce instead of oil. Thanks!

Delish, I also altered the recipe and used whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and added golden/regular raisins and pecans. Baked a little longer than 35 minutes so they were golden. They came out perfect!

these were great!!  I was 'snack mom' today for my 4 year old's soccer game today, and took these for the kids.  I followed the #1 reviewers advice, and only added 1/2 cup of brown sugar, which was PLENTY!  I also followed their advice in leaving about an inch and a half on one end of the 9x13, and not baking them for the full time.  I think I ended up baking them about 22 min.  cut them while still hot, but left in the pan to cool.  I added mini chocolate chips and dried cranberries, instead of the raisins. GREAT recipe, will definitely be making this regularly!

Delicious! Both my girls loved them. The consistency was perfect and they stayed fresh in a ziploc bag! I also followed the advice of the first reviewer and used only whole-wheat flour and 1/2 cup brown sugar. can't wait to make them again.

these are gr eat as is but the second time I made them I decided to make them a little healthier.  I replaced the oil with milled flax seed and added a snack size cup of unsweetened appple sauce. I also used whole wheat flour instead of white.  I did replace the raisins with choc chips, as my big kids are not raisin fans.

Because I made so many changes, I could really only give this recipe 4 stars.  Still, the base-recipe was excellent.  I needed a hearty--and healthy!!--snack for after work, but as written, this just had too much sugar and not enough nutrition.  I used 3 3/4 cups oats, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup flax meal, 2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. clove, 1 cup whole spelt flour, 3/4 cups raisins, 1/2 tsp. salt, 1/2 cup sugar-free maple syrup (instead of all that sugary honey!), 1 egg, 1/2 cup apple sauce (instead of the high calorie oil) and 2 tsp. vanilla extract.  I also made these into 12 large granola bars (adult-sized!) instead of 24.  They have fewer calories than a standard serving of oatmeal and raisins, but are just as delicious and filling (and I can actually eat them in my car after work!).

AMAZING!  I made these with some changes posted in other's reviews just to make them a bit healthier.  1/3 cup brown sugar (instead of 3/4 cup), flax seed (instead of wheat germ cause I had it on hand), omitted the white flour and replaced with whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup splenda (instead of honey), egg substitue (instead of an egg), and 1/2 cup apple sauce (instead of oil.)  Same recipe with healthier subs still made these GREAT!

The first time I made this recipe, I dinked around with it too much and it was just ok.  The second time around I messed with it a little less and it was great!  This is such a good recipe (even my boyfriend likes these) that I made it a bit bigger to fit a 15.5 x 10.5 in pan.  Use 3 cups oats and leave every thing else pretty much the same and it still works well.  I used maltitol instead of brown sugar and there was not a noticeable difference in taste.

These bars are amazing. the first time I made them I followed the recipe exactly, they were just a bit sweet. I followed other suggestions the next time and cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup. I used flax seed meal in place of the wheat germ, only because I perfer the taste. I like to add 1/2 cup sunflower seeds/pumpkin seeds, and have used dried mango as well.  I also increased the oats to 3 cups and used the method by another reviewer to leave an inch at the end of the pan. It makes a nice chunky bar. I bake the bars for 25 minutes and they stay moist and chewy. I found that pressing them down firmly before and after taking them out of the oven works well. I wrap them and keep them in the fridge and they get better every day. Thank you Pregocook for an outstanding breakfast bar. This recipe is one I make over and over with different variations and it's always perfect !

I made these after reading the reviews. I added one apricot (from a can and 1tablespoon pear juice from the can it was packed in). I pureed the apricot and juice in the blender and added it to the beaten egg. The bars were wonderful and soft and chewy rather than crumbly.   Everyone in my house raved about these and they were very easy to take on a 10 car trip.

Great recipe. Totally versatile. Used slivered almonds and craisins instead of raisins and whole wheat flour for my first attempt at them. Next time I will remember to reduce the honey and brown sugar as previous reviewers said. Looking forward to making them again and using different combinations of nuts, dried fruit and chocolate chips.

I liked this recipe, changed to  my usual-canola oil and I'm bad, but I add at least 1 cup chocolate chips  and 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts they both  are a must in my home.  The chips +nuts  change the cooking time, but you have to watch them at around 15 min so they do not over cook or brown too much.   I've used 1 cup(+) of M+M's too. If you add more chocolate, which I have done  my husband calls the cut batch candy bars!

I think these are great just the way the recipe calls for but they are just as good with other things besides raisins.  I loved the dried blueberries and craisins were great too.  Everyone in the house loves these and everyone in my playgroup did too.

First time ever making granola bars. I added in some chocolate chips and sunflower seeds with craisins. Nice and chewy, hubby says they are ok too! I was making them for him, LOL! I added in half almond extract this time and it came out really strong. Next time I will use all vanilla. And less salt with the sunflower seeds. Thanks for a great recipe Pregocook!

My son is on the Feingold diet, so no more prepackaged granola bars for him!  But these are so much better!  I use whole wheat flour instead of white and unsweetened applesauce instead of oil.  And I bake for only 20 minutes.  1/2 cup natural peanut butter and 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips, or raisins and extra cinnamon, or chocolate chips and coconut have all turned out yummy!  Oh, and cut the brown sugar into the oats with a pastry blender, then continue with the directions.

Great recipe.  I made a few changes.  I used white whole wheat flour and added chopped walnuts to the recipe. I also reduced sugar to 1/2 cup and used canola oil.  It's a keeper.

I've passed this recipe on to so many people, made this with so many variations, and love every time, thank you! I use applesauce instead of oil consistently and only bake it for 18 min per another review. It's only 'not turned out' once, and again, per another review, broke it up a bit, stuck it back in the oven for a while at a lower heat and had awesome granola.

Wanted to love these.  I liked them better before they baked.  Next time I'm going to bake them for the full time instead of for only 20 minutes as suggested by others.  I think these would taste best crunchy.  The crunchy edges were my favorite parts.  The chewy parts seemed too cookie-like, and these are not a good cookie as they're not sweet enough for that as I made them, at least.  Will try again and hope for better.  My changes (based on other reviews) were: sub some rice krispies for some of the oats (definitely do this); cut back sugar to 1/2 cup; throw in a little flaxseed; subbed choc chips for raisins; left out cinnamon (didn't go well with choc chip version); cut salt back to 1/2 tsp; used corn syrup and peanut butter instead of honey.  Next time I may put the sugar and salt back to the recipe suggestions and then back them for the full 30-35 minutes.  I ate them but the kids weren't big fans (ages 5 and 6) this time around.  Also, definitely line the pan with parchment.  They were easy to remove.

I made these bars and they turned out great. I substituted wheat germ for bran , because that's all I had, also half of the oil for orange juice and a mixture of nuts instead of raisins. I am anxious to try more variations!

This recipe is great as is, or as many others have indicated is easy to adapt to your taste, creativity, or just to whatever you have on hand. I first made these just after delivering my son. I was nursing and wanted to have something quick to eat that wasn't processed, would be nutritious, and would also "keep things movin'" (if you know what I mean!) I always use whole wheat flour, add whole and/or ground flax seed to increase the fiber, and decrease the amount of brown sugar. For a chocolate version, I substitute molasses (high in vitamins) for the honey, replace 1/2 cup of the flour with Ovaltine (also high in vitamins) and some powdered cocoa mix and add mini-chocolate chips instead of raisins. Nutritiously decadent!

I agree with other reviews that this is a good start or base granola bar recipe. I liked it, but I thought the honey taste overpowered everything else. Sooo the next time I used light corn syrup instead of honey and it was great. I have tried this recipe substituting different dried fruits including dried cranberries, coconut, apples, or raisins, and I have even put a mixture of nuts including unsalted sesame seeds, slivered almonds, or walnuts. Also, I have added mini chocolate chips or drizzled white almond bark over the top when they come out of the oven. I also agree that the cook time is a little long, they do not need to be brown around the edges, that usually means the edge pieces are going to be crunchy while the middle pieces are more chewy; probably around 25-30 minutes is good. Oh and lastly, I don't always put cinnamon in them when it doesn't go with the other ingredients, and I always lessen the salt to 1/2 tsp! Hope everyone enjoys all of the variations you can make with this recipes!!!

These are great! I didn't have wheat germ so left it out. Next time I'll use that and maybe some dried cranberries. I added chocolate chips and sultanas. Didn't care for the chocolate in these. I'll cut down on brown sugar as I thought they were pretty sweet. Overall perfect and my son loved them!

I think these are so wonderful!!!  I didn't have wheat germ, so I left that out.  I used ground flax seed, used half whole-wheat flour and used a combination of choc. chips and raisins (more choc. chips).  We loved them and so did our group!  It's such a versatile recipe!

After making a couple times, made some minor adjustments for taste and to accommodate diabetic hubby : reduced cinnamon, added half the qty of honey and the rest Splenda (all Splenda made them too crumbly).. and Splenda/brown sugar Blend (NOTE: cut "brown sugar" to 1/3 cup. The S/BS Blend qty is 2 TBSP + 2 tsp). We love these. Yummy,filling, healthy snack!

This was so fun to make! I didn't have any honey and used pancake syrup instead, also used wheat flour instead of all-purpose. Since some of the reviewers said the cooking time was a bit too long, and I wanted chewy granola bars, I only cooked them for 20 minutes. They turned out very soft and chewy, so I will keep doing them like that. All in all, this is a delicious recipe and I will make them again!

LOVE IT! I have been really burnt out on store bought granola bars for a long time, and I don't know if I'll ever go back. The flavor is so much better, and mine turned out the perfect chewiness.  I added all sorts of things: almonds, flax seeds, pecans, chocolate chips, and some other things I can't even remember. Cut the brown sugar to about 1/3c, and used wheat flour instead of white. I also took them out of the oven before they were done and cut them with a buttered knife, then put them back until they were done and then cut them on the same lines again before they cooled. I froze them while they were still a tad warm so they would keep some of the moisture. Ate one today during a hike and I was so pleased.

I finally made these granola bars and don't know why I waited so long.  They were delicious.  Can't wait to have them this afternoon with yogurt! I followed other reviewer's recommendations and used wheat flour instead of white and 1/2c brown sugar instead of 3/4c.  I did set the timer at 30 minutes and they came out burnt on the edges, so next time I'll definitley not put them in so long.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I and my whole extended family really likes these bars.  I of course used mini chips instead of raisins, (I always do) and found it was important to cut while warm.  Mine were done after only about 23 minutes so check often.  Thanks for the recipe and the cute title,  my three year old likes them a lot!~

My family can't stop eating these.  I substituted 1/2 whole wheat flour with 1/2 the white flour (which I do with most things) and used about 1/2 c. of sugar.  I made two batches in two days and my family loves it.  I also used wheat bran once instead of wheat germ.  Very good.  9/26/09  Still love this, I make it with all wheat flour instead of 1/2 and 1/2 now and it tastes the same.

This is a great recipe to play around with. Thank you so much for sharing. Few changes: I added soy protein powder instead of the all purpose flour to make it more protein healthy. Used 2 egg whites and omitted the yolk. Added 1/2 cup mini dark choc chips, 1/2 cup flax seed, 1/4 cup of sunflower seeds, 1/2 cup raisins. reduced the sugar to 1/4th cup but was still a little on the sweeter side for me. Will reduce that the next time.  Also, I baked it for 25 mins and the bars were more on the crunchy side than chewy. May cut down the baking time next time. Overall a great great recipe! Thanks :)  Update: These are still super and I make them so often. I reduced the oil to 1/4 cup and add 1/4-1/2 cup of apple sauce and bake only for 18 mins. They are chewy, almost cake-like. We love them. Thank you once again :)

I get recipes off here all the time, but never have I been so moved to go through the effort of reviewing one. This one is AMAZING in my opinion. Well, with some tweeking- advice taken from other reviewers. Here are the changes i made: 1/2 cup brown sugar (could even use less next time), 1 tsp cinnamon (possibly more next time), wheat flour instead of white, I made one batch with 60% cocoa choc chips which was for me (amazing) and the other batch for my husband w/ the recommended raisins (i HATE raisins but i actually really liked this version too), 1/4 cup canola oil, 1/2 cup applesauce, and i baked them at 350 for 23 minutes (perfect consistency). But instead of pressing into a 9x13 pan, I used someone's advice of lining a cookie sheet with foil and spraying it with pam, and then spreading the mixture on top to the desired thickness. This turned out perfect and also made it a breeze to cut. Thank you so much for this recipe. I am 39 weeks pregnant and made these to have as a snack during labor. I cant wait to go into labor so i can eat the rest! haha

The best recipe is one that can easily be altered and changed to meet the needs of all cooks- this is that recipe! I combined other reviewers suggestions to add an extra nutritional punch to these delicious bars. Here are the changes I successfully made: - grease the pan with coconut oil (it's healthier and adds a very nice subtle flavor) - 1/2 c. brown sugar - 1/4 c. wheat germ - 1/4 c. ground flax seed - whole wheat flour - added about a handful of chopped walnuts - half raisins half cranberries - 1/4 c. apple sauce - 1/4 c. oil  Enjoy creating your own take on this fantastic recipe!

This recipe was excellent, and although I only gave it 4 stars, it definitely is a 5-star with some of the changes I made based on other reviewers' ideas.  I did use whole wheat flour, as one reviewer suggested, and I cut the brown sugar down to 1/2 C.  Next time I will cut it down even more to 1/3 C or even 1/4 C.  Also, I don't generally have wheat germ in the house, so I used the same amount of flaxseed meal instead.  And last but not least, for additions I used raisins and semi-sweet chocolate chips, since my kids love chocochip granola bars.  No nuts because we have allergies.  These were wonderful and I will make them regularly!

GREAT~~~ Love, love, love these.  I just found a great and versitile snack for my son.  I did these as is, but added golden raisins and dried cherries, along with the regular raisins. i think next time i might add some toasted almonds. Oh and I also used rice cereal in place of the wheat germ since i didnt have any on hand. Great, and so many different ways you can make! thank you~

OK - as did many others before me, I made some changes to fit our needs.  I substituted a mashed banana for the egg.  I added 1/2 c applesauce with 1/4 c. oil and reduced the sugar to slightly less than 1/2 c. I also added 1/2 craisins with the raisins.  I baked for 24 minutes in an 8in pan and they were great.  Very moist and chewy.  Will definitely make again and will probably double the recipe.

Awesome and a lot of fun to make.  I substituted mini-choc. chips for the raisins.  I tried the rice crispies instead of the wheat germ like one reviewer had suggested.  Also used less brown sugar (1/2 c is plenty sweet), and used whole wheat flour instead of the white flour (doesn't weigh it down). Also works with quick oats if you run out of rolled oats.  I've also added a dollop of peanut butter (whatever I can pull out of the jar with a spatula!) to the mix on occasion with good results. When we run out, I wash the pan and make another batch immediately.  It's helpful to put together 2 or 3 bags of the dry ingredients (minus the brown sugar) and then add the other ingredients just before cooking.  Thanks for submitting this recipe, and to everyone else for their helpful reviews.

What a great recipe my whole family just love these, you will definately need to double this recipe if you want to use them for school snacks or breakfast snack on the go.! If you do double it these are the adjustments I have started to make so they are healthier for us. I lowered the sugar to 3/4 cup after trying 1 cup and still taste great, Whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, I use egg beaters to replace the eggs and instead of 1 cup of vegetable oil I use 3/4 cup of sugar free apple sauce and top up with Canola oil to make the 1cup. I added craisins. Thank you for this recipe, I never buy store bought anymore!

Everyone loved them!!!  Except I took them out a little early to keep the chewiness and in one batch I added chocolate chips which took it to a whole other level.

Wow these are super good!!! My 3 year old loves them.
I don't think I will ever buy another granola bar again.
They are super easy to make. quick and fast, that always wins me over.
A double batch is a necessity since they don't last long.

I did make some changes and only put 1/2 a cup of sugar.  I am glad I did as they would have been to sweet with the full amount.  I think I am even going to try 1/3 of sugar next time.

I would also like to suggest trying these with Almonds and dried blueberries, I think they would be very good!

ETA:  I made these with no honey and they were perfect.  I used 2tbsp of molasses and just added enough soy milk to make the mixture stay together.  The extre sweetness and sugar of the honey is not necessary.  I am going to try and make it this way with 1/2cup of sugar as 3/4 still makes them too sweet imo.

These were really good even though I made a few mistakes. I accidently used quick oats so they came out with more of a muffin texture. I also used olive oil to make them a little more healthy but you could taste it in the finished product so next time I will use regular oil and the right kind of oats.  Despite my mistakes they still had such a really wonderfull flavor. I will repost after I make the changes.

We love these granola bars.  We make a variety of them.  Nuts, cranberries, coconut.  Yum.  My brother-in-law is in the Special Forces and has asked for a batch to take while training for deployment.

So good and so easy!
I lined my baking dish with parchment paper to prevent sticking.
I substituted more flour for the wheat germ, plus some sesame seeds and sunflower seeds to make them more granola-like.

I did these a little differently, instead of wheat germ, we used unprocessed wheat bran, WW pastry flour and coconut oil.  We've made these twice now and all 4 children love them.  I have to take mine out at about 25 minutes though for chewy bars.

These were really good. I added about 1/4 cup of butterscotch chips and 1/8 cup unsalted sunflower seed along with the raisens that are optional in the recipe. You can very easily exchange other ingredients you have on hand and they were very easy to whip up in a hurry. Thanks for submitting the recipe.

These are super easy to make and modify and are much heartier, filling, and delicious than any other granola bar out there. This is the second time I've made these since my family and I LOVE granola bars and buying boxes of them from the store is so expensive.  When I make these, I use ground flax  instead of Wheat Germ (in a 1:1 ratio), use 1 cup of brown sugar instead of 3/4, and only use 1/4 cup of honey instead of a full cup.  I also use a random amount of cinnamon, cloves, and ginger (just sprinkle it in, no measurements) and a half cup of dark chocolate chips plus 1/4 cup golden raisins instead of a full 3/4 cup of raisins.  They're SO GOOD and keep very well in an air-tight container with the layers of bars separated by wax paper.  During school and work we'll pre-package them in Ziplock bags as grab and go breakfasts.  My family (me, my dad, my mom, and my brother) can easily finish off a full pan of 24 bars in three days.  :D  These are so good and suprisingly filling for how small the bars are.  I'll usually snack on one of these instead of three or four storebought bars.  YUM!

This recipe is so versatile.  It has become one of our favorites. I have changed it a bit to suit our tastes.  Instead of raisins I put in 1 1/2 cups of chopped dates and 1 1/2 cups of chopped pecans.  You could use anything.  Chopped apricots? I use Canola oil instead of vegetable oil and we omit the cinnamon. I find we like it better if you cook it just until lightly done. They are still good if you overcook a bit but we like them softer.  Also, I use parchment paper in the bottom of the pan and lift it out in one piece to cool.  No mess and no pan to wash.

These just weren't for us. All you can taste is wheat germ. Maybe I bought the wrong brand I don't know. Followed the recipe to the letter! Sorry.

I don't have any kids, but my husband and I love these! They're relatively easy and I've made them lots of different ways.

The original recipe is great, but I've made a few tweaks.

Most recently, I've substituted the eggs with vegetable oil so that I can safely cook them for less time and have a softer bar. 

I've also added a variety of different ingredients (at different times), including diced apples, white chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, etc. 

It's a great base, and adding your favorite treats into them makes them constantly different!

I loved this recipe. I have made a lot of granola bars and this one is going to be my 'go to' granola bar. My family devoured them!! I cut the sugar to 1/2 c and did not add raisins (blech) I added mini choc chips and unsalted almonds, walnuts, and cashews.  I also added dried cherries. I think you can easily change it up! I SLIGHTLY overcooked them and actually it tasted great. (phew) You will enjoy this and trust me they will go in a minute!!!

These are very yummy. It was a huge hit with my oldest and my husband. I will be making them again. I used olive oil in replacement of the vegetable oil though and I think I am going to try adding unsalted sunflower seeds in the next batch.

This recipe IS great as written-- so great it became an immediate staple. But it lends itself well to substitutions/tweaking, too. Personally, I found adding an extra egg really helped it stay together with tons of add ins like fruit and nuts. I also like it better with wheat flour. My husband likes bananna chips, peanut butter, and chocolate. I like apricots, craisins and mixed nuts. The neices and nephews like white chocolate, craisins, and walnuts. But again, still a great recipe as written. I've made it 3 times in 2 weeks already. Thanks!

These are FAB-U-LOUS! After my first try with them, however, I edited them for health purposes, and they were genuinely just as yummy! I added a half a cup of flax seeds, I used wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour, and I used canola oil instead of vegetable oil. I've also made them with and without the raisins. They are delicious either way, but my family LOVED them with the raisins (I did, too). Also, I only baked them for about 20 minutes, as to keep them chewy. Soooooo good once they cooled! But anyway, thanks to whomever submitted this!

I tried this recipe today, along with some of the recommendations made by other viewers (less brown sugar, whole wheat flour, etc...) and added in some unsweetened coconut and cinnamon chips.  Great base recipe that accommodates a myriad of alternatives.  My son loves this and has already asked that we make another batch.

I made a few changes because I wanted it a bit healthier. I replaced the white flour with Almond flour (which gives it more protein & adds moisture). I replaced the vegetable oil with coconut oil and I had no wheat germ on hand so I replaced that with flax meal. The texture came out perfect! It was like a moist oatmeal cookie bar. Next time I will reduced the brown sugar to 1/4 cup and maybe add 1/4 cup stevia (to reduce the sugar and calories). I may try it using coconut flour too, to give it even more fiber and maybe try it with applesauce sometime too. I love these!

As the name suggests, these are better for kids. They don't pack a whole lot of flavor, and the nutritional content could be higher, especially if you're feeding them to children every day. 25 minutes in my small electric oven was sufficient. Good base recipe. Planning to do a lot of experimentation with this one.

Good bars. My husband eats at least 2 granola bars every day after workouts and likes these better than any store brand I've bought, yet they were a trifle crumbly. The crumbs were good as granola. I plan to use the suggestion from natsmom, and add 1/2 cup applesauce next time.

After reading lots of the reviews I made some of the suggested changes. Used whole wheat flour instead of white, did 1/4 cup wheat germ and 1/4 cup ground flax seed. Used avocado oil in mine... next time I think I'll use 1/4 cup avocado oil and 3/4 cup applesauce to see if I can make them a little chewier. I also took the advice of pressing the mixture into the pan leaving about 1.5 inches bare at the end to make the bars thicker (since the mixture doesn't spread when cooking). Instead of raisins I used dried cranberries and added half a cup of chocolate chips. Can't wait to try a bunch of different variations! Definitely don't need to be cooked quite so long, I'd say more like 25 minutes. After cutting (while still warm) I wrapped them individually in saran wrap so hopefully they won't get too hard. But a really great basic recipe to play with!!

I made these according to directions, just substituted cranberries for raisins.  I had a difficult time spreading it out enough for the pan suggested. There were gaps and it was not even. The more I tried to fix it the more I messed it up. Did I need more flour? Admittedly I did over bake these a bit. The edges were burned and the middle were still chewy. I do give this 2 stars for taste alone which was good. IF I make these again I will have to adjust temp and leave cranberries/raisins out.

Really really good!  We did semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of raisins and they turned out very yummy.  My 11 year old took a couple bites and said "we should start making these a lot!"

Amazing, my family loved them. They did taste more like cookie bars. I used 1c whole wheat flour, 1c craisins ,1c almonds, 1/2c brown sugar.

Love, Love, Love these! I ran the kitchen at a backpacking school in Scotland and these were a staple on every hike. I love how I can change up the fruit with coconut, chocolate, and so many other combinations.  I have passed this recipe on to many other moms..

I made these for my boyfriend while he's studying for the bar and he loved them! I tried making him another granola recipe afterwards by Barefoot Contessa but I think he just wants more of these...haha They're super easy to make and come out clean and easy to box up and send to someone! I individually saran wrap them with the cling wrap so they're easy to just grab and go and then put them in plastic bags to help keep them fresh.

I have never met a person, regardless of age who doesn't like these! I add Craisins and chocolate chips to the recipe, but you could add finely chopped nuts (if you know no one has allergies).  I have been making this recipe for years and am never disappointed.  One tip though, if you line your pan with parchment paper, it makes removing them really easy, makes cutting them easy (without scratching your pan) and pan clean up quick and easy. I did learn though not to try to make them too thick or they won't cook properly.

Kids loved them!  I didn't have wheat germ so I used flax seed & wheat flour instead of white flour.  I doctored them up & added ground walnuts, coconut, a big scoop of almond butter & a few chocolate chips.  These satisfy a sweet tooth & add are healthy at the same time!  I only baked them for about 24 minutes though.  Awesome - this is now a staple!

This recipe is so versatile. I got fed up because I couldn't find my favorite chewy granola bars with fruit and dark chocolate so I decided to make my own. You really can do whatever you want with this recipe and I feel like it is impossible to mess up. These tasted a bit salty to me so I will cut back a little next time. I followed another suggestion and used half oil and half applesauce to cut back on some fat. I was worried about them being too sugary so I cut back on the sugar a little. I think I will increase it back to what the recipe says next time. I added chopped spiced and glazed mixed nuts you buy at the grocery store, chocolate chips, and tons of raisins. I think I will increase the amounts next time and maybe add pumpkin or sunflower seeds. I baked these for 25 minutes which made them ever so crispy on the edges (which was yummy). I had no problem getting them out of my greased glass baking dish. Will definitely make these again.

I was so happy to find this recipe. So many recipes crumble unless you make them very sweet. But the egg and flour (I use whole wheat) help hold these together. Add cranberries and dark chocolate chips, decrease the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and... you have a winner in my opinion!

This is an incredibly simple recipe that makes delicious granola bars!  I omit the raisins but add dried cherries, cranberries, blueberries, or all three!  Since I also like almonds, I add 1/2 a cup of slivered almonds.  I have tried many variations of these (including using splenda brown sugar instead of regular) and no matter how I make them, they get gobbled up quickly!

I like these a lot!  I put in a small amount of mini choc chips instead of raisins.  I forgot to mix them into the batter, so I just pressed them into the top after they were in the pan.  I know I'll make these again, and maybe I'll try mixing in different things for variety. (nuts, dried fruit...)
Update:  Two days later, I realized just how perfect these are!  Just the right texture and firmness.  I'm big on tasting food fresh out of the oven.  These are better when cooled!  The only thing I might try changing is to reduced the sugar or try splenda.

We made these for our lunches one week and loved them.  I didn't have any honey at the time so I used real maple syrup which worked out fine.  I also added a few chocolate chips and my hubby loved them.  I'm going to make them again this week!

This is sooo good! I have made it four times for my picky granddaughter and she loves it.  I like having the comments  to see what others have done with the recipe to change it.  I did add less sugar which is what one person recommended. Today I added raisins to one batch.

These didn't turn out for me. I so wish they would have. I was hesitant to well grease the pan, because I find that causes burning. I usually wipe out the excess. I wanted to follow the recipe though. After less than 25 minutes they smelled like they were browning too much. I took them out and cut them in the 5 minutes. They had too much of an over baked taste and just weren't sweet enough to me. They were on the dry side and hardened too much after they were cool also. I don't have much experience making granola and may just be used to the store bought chewy ones. I would have to try other recipes to know. Mine broke too, due to being dry.

These are excellent.  The 1st time I made them I was out of honey so I used some of the other reviews and went with peanut butter.  The 2nd time I made them more based on the actual recipe just used chocolate chips instead of raisins and that was by far our favorite.  I will definitely make these again.

I made these last night and OMG!!  These are SO GOOD!  Instead of raisins (which my kids won't eat) I added mini chocolate chips & mini marshmallows!  I am thinking about adding graham cracker crumbs to the next batch.  I love these bars and they taste so much better than the store bought.  I wrapped each bar in Press & Seal plastic  wrap and then stored the in an airtight container.  I undercooked them just by a few minutes and they are SO soft and chewy.  We used to buy so many of the store bought granola bars....no more!!  I will always have these in the cabinet for my kids snacks!  Thanks for sharing!!

I know I am in the minority with this recipe, but we didn't love them.  Not sure what went wrong because I was hoping to stop buying store bought granola.  Thanks PREGOCOOK for sharing and glad everyone else seems to love them.

Fantastic! These are well received by all when I take these to a function. I use less honey, no wheat germ, and replace the raisins with chocolate chips. I bake mine in a smaller pan that goes in my convection oven toaster so they are somewhat thicker. I bake them for 20 minutes then cover will foil and bake 20 minutes more.

I only bake these for 18-20 minutes, just until the edges start to brown.  This way my toddler with just a few teeth can eat them.  I also used just a 1/2 c brown sugar and round up the cinnamon to 1tsp, Craisins to 1 c (don't like raisins), salt to 1tsp. Just simpler this way.  They have become a staple food item in our house!  We experiment with adding chocolate chips, flax seed, etc.  Hard to mess up!

These were really good. I made them exactly as written, but I did substitute dried cranberries for the raisins due to personal preference. I made them last night and less than 24 hours later, I only have one bar left! Family LOVED them. I can't wait to make more of these and experiment with the recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Love this recipe!!! I make it in double or triple batches and freeze them. Even then, they still don't last very long. I do cut back on the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and use whole wheat flour. The great thing about this recipe is that you can put in any nuts, dried fruit, coconut, mini chocolate chips, and it still works great. Also, I make them peanut butter by cutting the oil to 1/4 cup then adding 1/4 to 1/2 cup of peanut butter. Delicious!

I made a lot of changes to these bars to make them vegan and cheap enough to serve to hundreds of people.  It is much cheaper this way and still very tastey!  My recipe is as follows:  mix combine dry ingredients separately:  2 c. quick cook oats, 1 cup spoon-measured flour, 2 T corn starch, 1-2 t cinnamon, 1/3-2/3 c. brown sugar.  Mix well.  Mix wet ingredients next:  1 c. water, 1 c. oil, 1-2 heaping T peanut butter.  whisk together, heat to melt to mix if necessary.  Stir together with dry ingredients.  Add in raisins or other goodies.  Spread into 9 x 13 pan.  Bake for 20 minutes.  Cut into bars.

This  is the best recipe for chewy granola bars I have found so far! I do have a few tweaks that I recommend: bake only for about 20 minutes. Or they are too dark/dry at the edges. 
You can Add anything you want, and it doesn't effect the baking portion!! I love adding peanut butter, peanuts, almonds, shredded coconut, pepitas, sunflower seeds,  chocolate chips, dried cranberries, flaxseed meal.. Whatever you have on hand that seems appropriate for a bar should work!
I haven't tried krispies in them yet, but I just never have them on hand. I will try one day soon I'm sure.
This is a great recipe. They do not crumble to just granola as so many other recipes do. And they are not super crunchy (like the nature valley bars) which are harder and messier for kids to eat, I love these!!!

I love these granola bars, and even better, so do my husband and two boys.  They are pretty healthy, and you can do so many variations to them.  I love to add a mixture of dried Craisins, blueberries, and pomegranate. Have fun creating!

Very yummy!  Based on other reviews, I used whole wheat pastry flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and instead of the oil I used 1/4 cup peanut butter and 1/3 cup applesauce. They were delicious!  They had a great flavor. I also added mini chocolate chips to make them extra appealing. I am going to freeze these and then put them in my kids' lunchboxes frozen.  By the time they are ready to eat them, they should be all thawed.  Thank you for a great recipe!

I took advice from others and reduced the sugar a little and changed the oil to canola. I used a full cup of dried fruit: cranberries, golden & reg raisins, apples, apricots, papaya, pineapple, dates. I also added 1/4 cup of unsalted pumpkin seeds. After mixing everything it seemed a little dry so I added another 4 tbls. of honey and the same amount of water. My mix was sticky and the bars held together pretty well when cut. I would add even more next time. Also increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp. and added 1/2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice. Reduced cooking time to 22 mins.

My only complaint is that this recipe turns out a cake/brownie like bar. I was expecting something more crunchy. Personal pref. My husband loved them and I'm pretty sure he's gonna want them pretty often. Tasted great while warm out of the oven with butter!

These bars were good and easy to make but they sure tore my mouth up every time I would eat one. Maybe if they aren't cooked as long, they won't be as hard.

These came out pretty good.  After having it in my pile for years I finally decided to try them out.  I used applesauce, raisins, mini chocolate chips, unsweetened coconut, and whole wheat flour.  I baked them longer but had them on 325 instead of 350.  They still seemed almost not cooked but still good enough.  They are quite high in a 9x13 pan.  I think I might try in a bigger pan to flatten them out a bit.  Once you've cut a slice you will see how high/thick they are.  One square was plenty for me instead of a bar slice.  I also used wheat bran in stead of wheat germ cause that's what I had.  Makes for a heartier texture.  With the raisins and chocolate chips I found them to be a little too sweet.  I will lessen the brown sugar next time.  Overall a nice healthy snack!

These bars are easy to make.  I pretty much followed the recipe with the exception of using only 1/3 cup brown sugar and it was perfect.  I put them in a 11X7 pan and baked them for 30 minutes.  They  held together well and didn't crumble like other homemade granola bars.  I used quick oats but the next time, I will will try them with regular oats.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is an excellent recipe that's very easy to change up. I have substituted muesli for the rolled oats and that was a very good variation. I like to add 1/4 c peanut butter, and reduce the brown sugar to 1/4 cup, and increase the cinnamon to 1 tsp. I've replaced the oil with applesauce and that also turned out pretty well. Also, I've never had wheat germ on hand so I usually leave that out. One more tip: I pat the mixture  into only 2/3 of the pan, and check it frequently while it's cooking because it can burn.

Finally found my granola bar recipe!!! I did make a few changes.  I did not use wheat germ (didn't have any).  I did use ground flax seed, a little less than half a cup. I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil (awesome!) and dried cranberries instead of raisins.  Also only half a cup of brown sugar.  This will be my official go to recipe for granola bars!

Beyond addicting!! I had my girls mix up 1/2 a batch to "test" them and by the next day we were whipping up a full batch. They are terrific!! I didn't have any wheat germ but I used a generous portion of freshly ground soft winter wheat for my flour. It was sooooooo good! Thank you :).

I've never particularly cared for granola bars before, but I made these for my husband so he could have bars that were healthier than the store bought version, and now I'm sitting here eating a bunch of them myself. Yum! My only changes were to switch whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour and cranberries (which were on sale) for the raisins. Then I cut the brown sugar down to 1/3 of a cup, which seemed just right. Don't think I'll be going back to buying the store bought version anytime soon. Now I'm excited to make these with all sorts of variations!

I gave 5 stars for this wonderful recipe. My sons school is doing a waste free lunch challenge so I was looking for a nut free granola bar to pack in his lunch instead of buying them. This recipe is simple, delicious and it is so easy to make it your own. Instead of raisins I add coconut. I've made them with pumpkin and pumpkin pie spice and with diced apples mixed with cinnamon and sugar & applesauce.  The next time I make them with pumpkin I am going to throw in some shredded carrot. My son says these are better than the store bought & he will only eat these now. My daughter loves them too.

I have made these bars so many times and everyone loves them!  They taste like oatmeal cookies and smell great when baking. They are fabulous as is, but the recipe has lots of room for customization if you are feeling adventurous.  At times I have added nuts, coconut, flax seeds, choc. chips, dried fruits, the possibilities are endless!  Thanks PREGOCOOK for the wonderful recipe.

I saw all the great reviews and was excited to try these.  I always use the true recipe the first time around.  I found these to be a mix of breakfast bars and granola.  The spices didnt mesh well and the texture was chewy and tough.  Sadly I have no intentions to even try and mix it up the second time around.

I made these last weekend, but with cranberries & almonds instead of raisins.  Baked for 25 minutes, let it cool down a bit then cut, laid on cooling rack to continuing cooling then stored in an air tight container and week later the 3 that are left are still moist and yummy, not hard!  This is an awesome recipe that we will use often, in fact I logged on to to get the recipe again so we can make these but using heath pieces!

My two-year old loved these bars.  They were very easy to make and the ingredients will last you to make them over again.  I will try like the other reviews and add some nuts, etc. but these were great just the way the recipes says.

These bars tasted good and were easy to make, but were more like a cookie.  I was hoping to find something more like the store-bought granola bars.  May try these again in the future.

I used the calculator to change the serving from 24 to 36.  With this amount of mixture I was able to use my jelly roll pan.  Great recipe!!  This is a nice, basic recipe.  Each time I make it I just add whatever ingredients I have on hand -- chocolate chips, raisins, all sorts of different nuts.  coconut, etc.  I make some version of this recipe weekly.  Healthy and tasty!  Thanks so much!!

SO GOOD.  They don't need as much brown sugar, though.  Add several different kinds of dried fruit, instead.  I added raisins, dried cranberries, unsweetened crushed banana chips, coconut flakes, & sliced almonds.  I substituted oat bran for the wheat germ, and added flax seed.  They're hearty and [taste] healthy!

These are very good, but I would say it's more like an oatmeal cookie than a granola bar. Still trying to find something that is comparable to the chewiness of a store bought granola bar.

Really enjoyed these! I thought that they might have been too sweet with the brown sugar and honey, but they were perfect. I did substitue the raisins for dried cranberries. I probably won't buy store bought granola bars ever again.

This recipe is awesome! Very versatile. We have made cherry almond bars & chocolate chip almond bars both were amazing. I did cut the sugar to half of what the recipe called though because they were pretty sweet.

This is a good foundation to build off of. I have modified this recipe some based on previous reviews as well as my own tastes. I add an additional cup of oats, added 1c. of applesauce instead of oil, reduced the brown sugar to 1/3c. (not packed), TBS. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. all spice. I then throw in whatever I have in my cupboards; whether it's blueberry craisins, golden raisins, freeze dried apples, bananas, etc... 
This is a great recipe for young and old & half the price than buying granola bars at the store. I make these in bulk and throw 'em n the freezer until needed. Enjoy experimenting!! Try dark chocolate chunks and tsp. almond extract - YUM!

This is for me to remember my changes:  I didn't add any brown sugar at all, decreased flour to 2/3 cup (whole wheat), added 2 cups unsweetened cheerios, 1/2 cup pumpkin seeds, 1/2 cup sunflower seeds, 1/4 cups flax seeds, omitted raisins, but added 1/2 cup chopped prunes and 3/4 cups chopped dried apricots.  Decreased oil to 1/3 cup and added 1/2 cup applesauce to liquids.

Like a previous reviewer said, it's too sweet.  I cut down the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and still too sweet.  Overall, it's a great recipe.

Very tasty although they crumbled a lot and were quite heavy to eat. My 3 year old couldn't manage more than a small square although adults fared better. If you're looking for a lighter (texture-wise) snack, try Gobble Up Granola Snacks from this site.

This are good. I orginally made them as the recipe is written and they were great; however, I then tweaked the recipe to make it less fat and calories. I have added peanut butter, raisens, craisens, etc. I did find the orginal recipe was great and I know that probably due to the oil, but replacing the oil with applesauce was still good. Thanks for the recipe.

These are easy to make and delicious. Instead of buying brown sugar, I make my own and don't bother packing it. Use 1 cup of regular granulated sugar and blend in 1 Tablespoon of molasses with a fork until well blended. It works quite well, and you don't have to worry about your bag of brown sugar turning into a rock.

Absolutely delicious!  My 10 and 11 year old daughters love them!  I added some ground flax seeds and walnuts to the batch to add additional nutrition.  A definite winner!

This is the best ever granola bar recipe!  My kids love them and it is fantastic to be able to give them a healthy snack.  I cut the bars to various sizes so that there's a variety for different hunger levels.  I also reduce the amount of vegetable oil to less then 1/4 of a cup and substitute applesauce for the remainder (sometimes flavored, always unsweetened). Works great!

This is a great base recipe for yummy granola bars.  I make some of the modifications suggested, and the recipe varies depending on what I have on hand.  I always reduce the sugar and usually reduce the cooking time by a few minutes.

This is such a good recipe. My kids love it, and the best part is, you can sneak a lot in. I used Spelt flour in place of all-purpose flour. I added dried figs, flax seeds and peanuts. I replaced the oil with applesauce, almond butter and I used Agave nectar in place of honey. The wonderful thing is, I will play around with the recipe every time I make it. 5 stars.

Thank you! I have finally found the recipe for the taste and consistency of a granola bar that I was looking for. The only thing I did different was bake for 23 minutes like a previous reviewer said to do. They are the perfect amount of chewy, they stay together and taste great. Love them!

These were pretty good. I think I would add a few things to spice them up, maybe coconut and chocolate chips. As others mentioned, I would also cut back on the veg. oil and replace with applesauce.

Great bars! Best the next day. I used only 1/2 cup of sugar and they came out plenty sweet.  I also used whole wheat flour and added some pecans. I only cooked them for 20 mins and that was perfect. Now my problem is- I can't stop eating them! As yummy as they are, I estimated the fat content to be about 6 grams of fat each (which is great if you can eat just one or two a day, but...). Next time I'll try halfing the oil and using some applesauce as some reviewers suggested.

I changed a few things to make these healthier, and they are fantastic.  I replaced the wheat germ with ground flax because that is what I had.  I used fresh ground whole wheat flour.  I added sliced almonds and dried cranberries.  Absolutely fabulous. You won't be sorry.  THe best I have ever tasted. Next time I will try to cut down slightly on the honey and sugar. Thanks for the recipe!!!!!!!!!

All of my friends are always asking for the recipe, so for christmas this year I put all the dry ingredients with festive substitutes for raisins (sliced almonds, cranberries and choc. chips) it looks so pretty but you need at 1500ml glass jar to fit all the ingredients. I add 1 cup bran flakes and sub oil for 1 cup applesauce for my base and add anything from dried fruit, trail mix, drizzled choc on top..the skies the limit.

Absolutely love this recipe. It's great to build off of. I normally find my inspiration for flavors by browsing around in my local Bulk Barn (dried fruits, nuts etc). The options are endless. I find it a bit too sweet though, so I normally only add 1/2 cup of brown sugar.

Wow, these are so good!  I made them with 1/2 c dried cranberries and 1/4 c sliced almonds, and I am going to have to stop myself from eating them all at once.  I can't wait to experiment with other add-ins.  They weren't as crunchy as I would expect a granola bar to be, but more cookie-like.  But, they still taste good so I won't complain!  So easy, too!

These turned out very nicely for my first attempt. I added chocolate chips to the mix which was a nice addition. Seemed like it was missing something, so I will try adding some peanut butter and m&ms next time.

Fantastic, easy, customizable: I doubled the recipes, added ~2/3 cup ground flax seeds, swapped whole wheat for white flour, cut the brown sugar down to 2/3 c. - total - and added chopped pecans, apricots, and choc chips along with the raisins.  Pressed it all into a single parchment-lined 9x13 and baked about 30 minutes.  Perfect.  Thanks for this great recipe!

These bars weren't bad, but I didnt really think that they were good either. I might make them again trying different ingredients (cranberries instead of raisins, maybe adding some nuts or seeds).

This recipe is awesome.  Forget the wife and kids...I gobble them up after I'm done making them...LOL.  I've done my own little change ups as well as followed what some others have done.  Normally when I make it I do a double batch.  I actually got rid of the brown sugar altogether as I found it didn't need it at all.  The honey made it sweet enough.  And when I make the double batch I don't even double the honey and it still tastes great.  I even mix in a bit of buckwheat honey to the regular honey I get from the local farmer.  I use a tsp on cinnamon (2 when making double) and I even use spelt flour instead of all-purpose or whole wheat.  Our favorite is to use dried blueberries, but any dried fruit is great.  My sons don't like it with anything so I usually make a 1/3 batch for them and 2/3 batch for me and my wife.  These granola bars rule, and what's even better is that I know what's going into them.

I omitted the raisins and added mini semi sweet chocolate chips in their place. Also, used crushed graham crackers for the wheat germ. The 6oz "teddy bear" honey measured 1/2 C. I intended on making a double batch but my honey didn't go as far as I thought it would. Also, baked for 25 minutes and they turned out wonderful. Taste is great as well as texture. Thanks :-)

Great recipe. Used Flax seed instead of wheat germ, added a 1/3 cup of choc chips. Next time will add nuts...sesame seeds, sunflower. Very  tasty...the edges were addictively crispy and the rest was perfectly chewy.  I just wished I would have doubled the recipe.  I think I came out with under 24 pieces, but probably because I cut them a little larger...2x2. These do get eaten quickly.

Really good, I made these with the help of my little one this morning. I substituted AP Flour with whole wheat flour and cut the brown sugar to half. Chewy and highly nutritional will make again for sure!

I love this recipe!  I have made many variations and my kids love them - I've added sesame seeds and soynut butter (we're peanut allergic), cocoa and chocolate chips for a more indulgent treat that 's still much healthier than most cookies, and most recently I swapped in molasses for the honey and added ginger and clove and extra cinnamon for a gingerbread taste.  Thanks so much for the inspiration.  Also, I line my pan with a sheet of parchment paper to make removal easy but cheaper than foil.

Love this recipe!  I cut the honey and oil measurements in half and substituted Splenda and applesauce, respectively, to make up the difference.  Also added 1/3 cup almond butter and used 1/2 cup white flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour.  Think I've got a winner my family is going to love!

These are very yummy, but are a bit sweet for my taste, and I'm usually a sweet hound. Next time I will reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup. I also used whole wheat flour as others have and they were great! Will make again.

UPDATE: Through trial and error, I have found our favorite version. 3 heaping cups oats, 1/2 c UNpacked brown sugar, 3/4 c. flour, 1/4 c honey and 1/4 cup sugar-free maple syrup, 1/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup crunchy peanut butter, and 1/2 cup applesauce. Everything else the same. ORIGINAL These are really good. I read the reviews before making them and decided to change a couple of things.  I used old fashioned oats and only 1 cup brown sugar with the recipe doubled and upped the cinnamon to 2 tsp. I added about 1/2 cup applesauce with the wet ingredients, and used dried mixed fruit instead of the raisins. I don't know why we are supposed to use our hands to mix this and pat it out.  The only reason I can think of is so that you can lick it off your fingers after your done. :) I just mixed with a spoon and spread onto the baking sheet with the same spoon, and it was easy and clean. These smelled awesome while they were baking. I had a hard time seeing if they were done or not, but after 26 minutes I pulled them out "done or not!" and waited five minutes as directed before cutting them.  I was worried they would be a bit cakey from the way they cut, but as they cooled they hardened and got more chewy.  I was hoping for less crumbly so my 1 year old could eat them as well, but I'm watching him make a mess of the floor with one right now...I think he's just hopeless. I might try making them into cookies next time...to save myself the thirty seconds of cutting time. I know...I'm lazy.

Delicious and my 5 and 8 year old love these (as do the neighborhood kids).  My daughter and 3 of our neighbor friends have nut allergies so these are the perfect substitute for store-bought versions that are usually "made on equipment that also processes nuts", etc.  I use wheat flour (which make them even more flavorful and healthy).  I've had success with adding flax seed (a few Tablespoons or to taste).  I've not had success with my kids with subbing dried cranberries, dried blueberries, dried strawberries and cherries but they were tasty to us moms and it depends on your children's pallets.  I've also subbed apple sauce for the oil but they weren't nearly as moist (again, us parents thought they tasted good, just a little drier).  Play around and make sure to take them out of the oven right when the edges turn golden.  They're better really soft than over-done (unless you want them crunchy).  They last great in a sealed tupperware for a couple weeks.  You can put them into single baggies for kids to grab for healthy snacks on the go.  Love these!!!

This recipe turned out really good, but next time I would alter it to make it a little less like oatmeal cookies.  I made a batch to last the week but everyone who tried one asked to take a few home, so they only lasted three days.  
(I later tried the recipe using less sugar and more oats- i don't recommend adding oats, but the brown sugar could be reduced to 1/2 cup).

My husband eats Nutrigrain bars every morning, so I've been looking for healthier replacements. These were a big hit. I added lots of dried fruit, some coconut, and a little chocolate chips. Also replaced the wheat germ with flax seed meal. My one tip: cook less. I took out after 20min.

This is the recipe I have been searching for!  We wanted a homemade equivalent of the Quaker's Oatmeal Squares.  Nice and dense, very oaty, but not dry.   Not the recipe for you if you want a crunchy "Nature's Valley" type granola bar.

Not what I expected. It's okay, not sure why it has raving reviews. Very bread-like. In fact, reminds me of banana bread, not granola bars.

UPDATE:  I made these again without applesauce and they were extremely dry and hard.  I would not recommend making these without applesauce. It really improves the texture.
To my surprise, hubby and all three kids really liked these - previous attempts to "healthify" baked goods haven't been well received in our house. This recipe was!  This recipe must be very forgiving. I decided to time and a half the recipe so they would be thicker and softer (worried about reviews saying they came out hard). After I had already mixed the dry ingredients, I realized I only had one egg and not quite enough honey to time and a half it. Oh well, I plunged ahead. To up the fiber content, I used some whole wheat flour and added some milled flax seed. I also reduced the sugar and added a cup of applesauce. Instead of raisins, I used a 6 oz. package of dried Berries & Cherries (blueberries, strawberries, cranberries and cherries). Baked in a 13 x9 for about 35-40 minutes. Texture was right on and the taste was very good! Good thing they are on the healthier side because I can't stop eating them. :)

This is a great recipe. It is very versatile & you can change things to meet your families tastes or nutritional needs. I use flax meal instead of wheat germ, wheat flour instead of white and applesauce instead of oil. The store bought granola bars are filled with sugar, fat and preservatives. I love this healthier alternative. Thanks so much for sharing!

Well, I just wasn't over the moon with these bars.  The bake time seemed too long and my bars burned a bit around the edges.  Burnt raisins are bad.  Also, I don't know how you would need to slice these up to get a yeild of 24 ...  Taste wise they were just not a stand out.  My son was the only one in the house interested in eating them.

This recipe was great.  What made it even better was that my girls (ages 2 and 4) who love to help me cook were the ones who measured, poured and mixed!  We followed the recipe exactly but took them out of the over after 22 minutes as others suggested.  We can't wait to experiment by adding some of the other ingredients people have suggested.

These are so good and EASY! I made them for breakfast this morning and cooked them about 40 mins and they got nice a crispy but not burnt. I put craisins, mini chocolate chips (because a little goes a long way) and peanuts. We have been snacking all day on them.  My tip to you is.....put the vegetable oil in the measuring cup first, dump it into the mixture and then put the honey in the same measuring cup. The honey will not stick to the sides and comes out perfectly clean!   We will be making these more. I am thinking of going to the bulk section at out grocery store and picking up random ingredients to make many combination. I think these will be great for long car trips or for the track team that my Fiance couches.

This is a great base recipe for granola bars.  I usually try the recipe as-is first (in honor of the original chef) but I'm on a diet right now, so I changed out the oil for applesauce and the brown sugar for agave syrup.  I'm sure this made them much chewier than they would have been, but we still loved them :)  I used dried cranberries and the flavor was still excellent with the original spice/salt proportions.  Some reviewers mentioned that the cooking time was off - I only baked mine for 25 minutes and they were chewy (mostly due to the applesauce) but I think the difference probably lies in how old/new/fancy/simple your oven is (I have a new oven, but it's a very standard model).  All in all, a great recipe!

Do not put on tinfoil even if lightly oiled. This may be because I used 1 cup of applesauce instead of oil in the recipe. Delicious except that half of them are still pasted to the foil. Will definetly make again and again.

This comes out tasting more like a dessert than a healthy snack...especially if you add 1/2 cup mini choc chips like I did. The cinnamon and the flour (I used whole wheat flour) make it more cake-like. Very Good!!!

Super quick to make and super versatile! We are such huge granola fans, I knew there had to be a recipe out there that we'd like. Changed a few things to make more healthy. I used a Pampered Chef baking stone, too, and it only took 20 minutes to bake and turned out super crispy! I turned it out onto a sheet of foil immediately and cut with a pizza cutter - they really do crisp up nicely! Thank you for sharing!

I've made these Granola Bars many, many times for my husband.  I only use 1/4 cup brown sugar and I replace half of the oil with unsweetened applesauce.  Instead of raisins, I've used a wide variety of dried fruits, nuts and seeds.  I just make sure that they add up to 1 cup.  Very solid recipe.

These were okay granola bars. My family found them too dense and bland.  I will keep searching for that perfect recipe because I can then stop buying store-bought ones for the kids lunches.

My first time making granola bars ever and this recipe turned out absolutely delicious! My little cousin wouldn't stop eating them and told his mom to get the recipe from me. A simple, fast and easy recipe. Thank you!

These are super easy to throw together and taste great!  I make them once/week for my husband.  We like to add raisins, use 2 1/2 cups of oats, omit the vanilla and use 1/2 cup brown sugar.  Perfect!

Oh WOW!  I made these in the morning and I had eaten 3 by lunchtime!  I don't think I can go back to store bought granola bars.  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup as others reviewers suggested and they were still plenty sweet.  And instead of raisins I used dried cranberries and walnuts.  When spreading them out, I left 1.5" space in the pan so they would be nice and chewy as suggested by another reviewer.  These will be a staple around my house.

Just made these for the second time this weekend :-) Love them! I use all whole wheat flour, used 1/4 c. canola and 1/2 c. applesauce which keeps them super moist and chewy,used only 1/3 c. splenda brown sugar, 1/4 c. wheat germ and 1/4 c. flax meal, then threw in 1/2 c. craisins and 1/2 c. dark choc. chips, some sunflower seeds, and chopped walnuts.  I laid the dough out on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper, shaped it into a sqaure and then baked for 18 minutes in my oven ...The end result is simply amazing. These are my favorite granola bars and taste like a candy bar to me.  I cant wait to try different combinations like adding mashed bananas and peanut butter.I would definitely recommend trying these out since you can vary the ingredients to suit your taste/needs and they are chock full of nutrients!

This is a great base recipe that I will hold onto forever. My hubby wants snack for his lunchbox that are heart healthy...I've added soy flour, flax seed meal, and oat bran, used many different dried fruits and nuts, and even added chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, or mini m&ms.  I can't mess this recipe up, and he always loves them. Thanks so much, PREGOCOOK!

Excellent recipe! I used 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup honey, 1/4 canola oil and a 1/4 unsweetened applesauce, wheat flour and 1/2 wheat bran instead of the wheat germ. For fruit, I added about a 1/2 cup of fresh blueberries. They turned out great.

I Have been making these for about a year and my family loves them even my small children. I have made them exactly as the recipe and have also made one or more of the following changes all tasting great although the regular recipe tastes best...substitute applesauce instead of oil, splenda instead of sugar and or wheat flour instead of white all or 1/2. I also ALWAYS add 1/2 cup flax seed.

This recipe is THE BEST!!! I made a few adjustments: I used flax seeds instead of wheat germ and used applesauce along with oil.  I also used a greased foil lined pan, then you can lift the granola bars out and it makes cutting so much easier!! My picky 2 yeard old loved these!!!

I used craisins and raisin the first time and the next time added some coconut.  This is a great recipe!  No fiddling needed, but creativity can make them unique.

I ran across this recipe by mistake & thought it sounded good. After reading the reviews I decided to make a double batch & I am so glad I did! The whole family loves them. They are so healthy but my 2 year old calls them cookies! My 1 year old gobbles them up & says "more, more" & even my husband loves them. The only changes I made to the recipe were to use only 1/2 C brown sugar, used wheat flour instead of white, applesauce rather than oil, & added in 1/2 C sunflower seeds & 1/2 C flax seeds. Also definitely check bars after 20 minutes. Mine only took 25 minutes to be done. Every bite my girls take, I smile knowing how healthy these are for them!

My kids really liked these. I used dried cherries (as we live in Michigan where cherries are abundant), and they turned out perfectly. I followed the advice of other reviewers and left roomon the sides of my pan, which left them chewy and moist. Very good recipe. I will be making these again and again for my son's lunches.

Just the recipe I needed! FYI, the egg is not necessary. I omitted it and the bars were still chewy and kept shape after cooling.

These are fantastic!! I've made them many times. The original recipe is perfect! Just so everyone knows, no adjusting needed besides the cooking time, mine only cooked for 18 mins and that was all that was needed. But what I love about this recipe is how healthy it is and how easy it is to add different flavors. I've added peanut butter, ground almonds, chopped roasted almonds, mini chocolate chips, I've even added a couple handfuls of grape nuts! With all that extra adding, I did add another egg, but I love it all! Thank you so much for this recipe, oh yea, I decreased the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and it's still fine! Thanks again! My husband and son thank you as well!

I have never made Granola Bars before, but now instead of buying expensive power bars I make these instead.  I always double the recipe so they are extra thick, and add peanut butter chips,coconut,and pecans.  Perfect every time.

This recipe is wonderful!  My man has granola bars almost every morning for breakfast.  These are filling and so much yummier then anything you can get from a box.  The recipe is so versatile.  You can add any kind of nuts you want as well as peanut butter and all sorts of things you can think of.  It stays moist which is key.  I cannot thank the wonderful cook enough for submitting this recipe.  No more boxes of granola bars, this one has them all beat!

These were awesome! I took the advice of many of the other reviews and reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup. I also reduced the honey to 1/3 cup, replaced the oil altogether with 1 cup of applesauce, increased cinnamon to 2 tsp, did half raisins and half craisins and added 2 Tbsp of flax seed. With my substitutions the bars only needed to be baked for 30 minutes. Fantastic! I can't wait to try other variations!

As written (minus the raisins thanks to my 5 year old) this recipe is really good.  The second time I made it, however, I made a few changes that made these outstanding.  I substitued pumpkin for the oil and craisins for the raisins, reduced the brown sugar a little bit, and added about 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  I will definately be making these granola bars with different variations again and again.  Thanks for sharing!!!

Excellent.  I used whole wheat flour-not AP. Also tried using wheat bran-great! I added craisins instead of raisins.  Then I threw in some semi-sweet choc. chips.  I read that some people didn't go 30 mins on baking time-I cecked at 18 mins and they weren't done.  At 23 mins. they were starting to brown on the edges so I took them out.  I probably could have let them go another few minutes and they may have set a bit better.  They are yummy and cookie-like. Never buying granola bars again.

Nice recipe and the bars came out lovely from the pan. I cut back A LOT on the sweetness (no brown sugar and instead of honey I used a bit of maple syrup) and they came out not too sweet but good all the same. I also added more spices because I always add more spices in everything anyway. hehe. Oh yeah, and added finely shredded carrot to make it more healthy and it tastes good. Thanks for the recipe. I know I changed it quite a bit but I had a huge bag of carrots I didn't want to waste so I added them. I'm sure if I followed it to a 't', they would have come out really good as well.

TOAST the oats first to improve the flavour! I put 2 cups of slow cook oats in a single layer on a large baking sheet. Baked for about 15 minutes in a 350 oven. This will vary from oven to oven, so use this as a guideline only. The oats will be a light golden toasty colour. I followed the recipe as is, except I cut down brown sugar to 1/2 cup, used oat bran instead of wheat germ and added a bit more cinnamon and raisins. I like my bars on the crunchy side so I baked it for 30 minutes. I did try this recipe before, without toasting the oats and only baking for 20 minutes, but I personally found the oats too raw tasting. Toasting made it much better. Try it!!

Yummy.  To suit our own taste, I reduced brown sugar just a little, used canola oil instead of vegetable and added 1 tsp cinnamon.  Instead of wheat germ I used 1/4c ground flaxseed and 1/4c chopped pecans.  I also used 1/2c raisins and 1/2c choc. chips.

these were great, I loved them but was surprised that all 3 of my kids and husband liked them too! I will make frequently. I eat these before I even run for energy and it works great. I used steel cut oats as per another reviewer and it was fine. Add any kind of trail mix to them! The best trail mix I've tried to far is the  Archer Farms brand "Monster Mix" from Target

These were really easy, and delicious. Also nice to know they are so healthy! For the ones I made, I would have atually given four stars, because I cut back 1/4 cup of sugar. I followed someone's review saying they were too sweet. Unfortunately, they came out not sweet enough that way! They were still very good though. Lovely flavor, and stay chewy for a few days, which I love. Next time, I will add the full amount of sugar, and maybe some chocolate chips! If using white chocolate chips, I might use less sugar since the white chocolate is very sweet. The bars would have been perfect had I followed the recipe exactly, hence they deserve the 5 star rating!

These are excellent. I omitted the oil and added 1 mashed up banana + 1/4 cup peanut butter, as well as added chocolate chips with the raisins. These taste great and were so easy to make. I didn't have the problem of them crumbling apart like other reviewers, they are a very good chewy texture (maybe b/c of the peanut butter & banana?).

I left out the cinnamon and put in a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I loved the chewiness and the taste of honey.  Perfect treat for those that are craving a chocolate chip cookie, but cannot have dairy.

Update to review - I'm a chocolate girl, but must say I like them better with the raisins and cinnamon.  Watch out if you are not used to eating wheat germ....if you are like me and eat one too many of these delicious bars....well, lets just say next time I'll cut the wheat germ in half :-)

This recipe was ok, but not as amazing as the reviews made it sound. First off, do not bake them for 30 min!  That's way too long.  I did mine for 25 and they were a bit burnt on the outside.  Secondly, they were very crumbly so maybe next time I'll take the one reviews advice and add 1/2 cup applesauce to make them easier to cut and eat.  Overall, just ok, not amazing, and not really that healthy.

Great starter recipe! I used whole wheat flour, apple chips (coarsely hand crushed), and chocolate chips. DIVINE! And, full of the fiber that I'm looking for. I've never been a fan of store bought granola bars before because they always seemed so full of artificial ingredients. This is all natural, and very easy to make organic! I followed the measurements exactly as the recipe described, and it came out perfect. Thanks for the post!!

Great recipe, a huge hit with my 2.5 year old. I do reduce the brown sugar to no more than 1/2 cup, often less. We throw in anything and everything that is on hand - dried blueberries, cranberries, coconut etc. I make a pan, keep 4 or so out then freeze the rest in ziplock baggies of 3 or 4 each so they always are fresh.

I really enjoy making these for my two year old.  I usually bring crackers along for snacks, but now I bring these.  They are more healthy and they fill him up faster (and longer).  Here are the changes I've made:  1.  I reduce the brown sugar to 1/3 cup and the honey to around 1/4 cup.  2.  I reduce the oil to 1/4 cup 3. I add 2 mashed, ripe bananas to the egg mixture before adding it to the dry 4. I add a bit of allspice 5. I bake for 20 minutes.  The way I make it is not as sweet, but that's good because it keeps me from eating them all but still satisfies my son.

I have tried multiple granola bar recipes and this is the one I like best. This is the second time I've made these- they're wonderful with the raisins, but overall way too sweet. This time, because of what we had on hand, I didn't use the wheat germ, but 2 TB flax seeds instead, and only 1/2c wheat flour. In an effort to balance the amount of dry ingredients, I used 2/3c dessecated coconut and 1/3c ground almonds. Concerning oil or applesauce, I prefer oil (it's worth it to try both- personal choice), and I always add 1/2c carob chips. Just the right texture. For those vegans, substitute 2 Tb ground flaxseed soaked in 1 Tb water for the egg. I don't know if it's wiser to decrease the sugar or honey to cut down on the sweetness, but I will try 1/4 to 1/3c sugar next time and 1/3c honey. Thank you so much- I finally found THE chewy 
granola bar recipe for my family. :)

I love this recipe and its so easy to add dried fruit to make it even healthier.  I used whole wheat flour and apple sauce as suggested in previous reviews.  I added flaked coconut and some chocolate chips.  They are a big hit!

After a couple months of making these things, I needed to give them a higher rating and a re-review. 

I add a dab of natural peanut butter, a little flax seed, PURE vanilla extract. They turn out perfectly. I seriously have been baking these about once a week-my mom, grandmother, and I are addicted.

Great recipe!  I have made about 10 batches since I found the recipe in March-changing it a bit every time.  It tastes like a cookie, but is so much healthier!  Changes I made were  1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup powdered milk, 1/4 cup flax seed meal, 1/4 cup wheat germ, 1/4 cup applesauce 1/4 cup olive oil, 2 eggs, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, 2 tsp cinnamon and vanilla.  I also add raisins, dried cranberries, chopped chocolate chips, cut up dried apples, walnuts, crushed almonds (family does not like them, but don't notice if they are ground up-and it adds omega 3's and protein).   Packing it down hard helps and definitely don't overcook it.  Very portable, and very healthy!

These are more like muffin bars than granola bars (I was picturing oats held together by honey, like Quaker granola bars), but they are good.  I threw in some dried blueberries and they were way too sweet.  I suggest raisins.

Pretty good - though more of a cross between a granola bar and an oatmeal raisin cookie.  
I didn't have any wheat germ, so I used ground flax seed instead.  I cut back on the brown sugar to 1/2 cup, but still found these a little too sweet so will cut back even more the next time.  I think walnuts will make a nice addition for the next batch.  (Also - these were done baking at about 21-22 mins.)

I just wanted to thank everyone for their super helpful reviews. I originally found this recipe on Recipezaar but the reviews here have totally helped me out with making these my own. I haven't quite figured out how to make these "my own" but all the suggestions have given me so many ideas! I liked these bars a lot but with most recipes, tweaking is needed for personal tastes. Thank you!

Awesome recipe!!!!   

I made it even more healthier by:
1/4 cup of ground flax
1/4 cup quinoa flakes
using Spelt flour instead of all purpose

My kids love it and it is an awesome healthy treat!

This is a good base recipe but with changes could be a 5 star recipe. I would definitely cut down on the sugar to 1/4c as others have suggested. I think next time I will toast the oats before I mix them in. I also used wheat flour and added 1/3 c of ground flaxseed and wheat germ. These are good and I will make them again for SURE.

I'd just baked this yummy stuff, and here are my slight alterations:

1cup all-purpose flour = 1/2 cup WW and all-purpose flour
2 tsp mixed cinnamon, allspice and ginger
1/4cup oil = 3/4cup applesauce
3/4cup raisins = 1/4 cup dried cranberries and 1/2 cup chocolate chips
3/4cup brown sugar = 1/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup honey = 1/3 cup honey (I ran out. boo...)

thanks for this great recipe!

All of my family and most of my friends and their kids love these granola bars.  Even my very picky 5 year old can't get enough.  This recipe is very easy to make.  This is a great alternative to the high-fructose corn syrup and partially hydrogenated oil laden commercial brands.

I have been searching for a great granola bar recipe and found it. I always make changes to every recipe I make :-)  After reviewing comments & suggestions, I changed the recipe as follows:  2-1/2 C rolled oats; 1/2 C packed brown sugar; 3/4 tsp ground cinnamon; 3/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice; 1/2 tsp orange peel; 1-1/4 C flour; 1/2 tsp salt; 1/2 C honey; 2 egg whites beaten; 1/4 C canola oil; 1/4 C natural applesauce; 2 tsp vanilla extract; raisins; choc chips; cranberries; slivered almonds.

Used a 9 x 13 glass dish.  Divided mixture into 2 within the pan (leaving about 1 inch btwn).  Stirred in choc chips to the one side; Stirred in raisins, cranberries, almonds, choc chips to the other side. If I make only one type, I use a 9x9 dish instead.

Covered with foil & baked.  Once done, I cut into squares and immediately put onto wax paper to cool.  Then, put into plastic covered container.  Very moist. Even better the next day. Thanks!

This is a great base.  You can add up to 2 cups of "stuff" instead of just raisins then smoosh them down good with wet hands and they come out perfect. I usually add a whole bag of some fancy trail mix and maybe a little unsweeted coconut or extra nuts.  Always a hit.

AWESOME recipe!  I adjusted it since we mill our own flour.  We used hard red wheat, tupelo honey and then added the kitchen sink to this already incredible recipe (sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, cashews, almonds, dates, and pecans)!  It's never makes it through day 2!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Pretty good - I left out the raisings because my son doesn't like them - these did not however make enough to fill a 9x13 pan - I used a 9x9 and cut them into 9 bars - about 1/2 inch thick.

I just got done making these. I used chocolate chips instead of raisins. My hubby and kids love them. For me they are okay. I'd like them to be a little crispier. They were very easy to put together and I will make these again.

Wow, these are great!  I have tried a couple of other recipes for granola bars, and this is the best.  Very healthy too, and my kids are gobbling them up!  I substituted flax seed for the wheat germ and they still turned out fine.  I also used chocolate chips instead of raisins.  Very excited to have found this - thanks!

These are wonderful. Even my husband likes them. I double the recipe and we still eat them in less than a week. I also have substituted dried blueberries for the raisins.

I have made this recipe at least a dozen times now and my whole family loves it. I have modified the recipe slightly as follows. I used flax seed meal instead of wheat germ, maple syrup instead of honey, and coconut sugar instead of regular sugar. I often add in different ingredients to boost the nutrition of the bars, like hemp seeds, chia seeds and coconut flakes.

LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!  I triple the recipe and it works great!  In place of the raisins, I add 3 cups of raisins (or other dried fruit), 1 package chocolate chips, 1 cup pumpkin seeds and 1 cup sunflower seeds. I flatten out the whole batch into my jelly roll pan on baking paper to bake them.  When they come out of the oven, I slide them out onto the counter to cool for 5 minutes before I use my pizza cutter to cut them.

These are great! I used less sugar, a combo of honey and maple syrup, coconut oil, some coconut flakes, and flax seeds! Other than that I kept to the recipe. Mine turned out chewy and crumbly!

Great recipe. I make these granola bars nearly once a week, they're simple to make and taste great. I only ever make half of the recipe and still use a whole egg even though it should only be half of an egg, I don't put the brown sugar in and only use the honey and they're perfectly sweet, I swap craisins for the raisins and add in a quarter cup of sliced almonds. Delicious! Great swap for buying the boxed granola bars at the grocery store, plus you get to make them with the fruits/nuts you like.

Used whole wheat flour, added chocolate chips, substituted applesauce for the oil and baked for about 18 minutes. Also doubled the recipe. Turned out really good! Probably bc I know they're healthy too:)

I made this over and over again because it's so good. My husband and I like it so much. I followed the suggestion of reducing the brown sugar up to 1/3 cup as I want to control my sugar intake. Still it's very good. The recommendation of changing the raisins and vanilla can also be followed, to make variations of flavor.

Delicious.  I usually do half-and-half whole wheat flour and regular flour.  I also usually do half-and-half honey and corn syrup because it's more economical.  I tried using all corn-syrup and really missed the flavor, but half-and-half works just great for us.  My husband loves these when he goes camping or on long trips, and my kids love these all the time.  For an extra treat sometimes I add home-made cinnamon chips, but I usually just stick to raisins or cranberries.

I love this recipe and I have made it many times. It never takes 30 minutes for mine to cook. It takes somewhere between 18 and 25 minutes, although I have to watch it carefully every time I make it. Of course, how thickly you spread the batter in the pan makes a big difference, and I have two different sized pans, which confuses things a bit.
I often cook it with coconut oil and whole wheat flour. I also often reduce the brown sugar. These healthy changes are better suited for our family's tastes.

These turned out really well for me!  I've been trying to find a recipe for a granola bar that would stay together. These stayed together well and were nice and chewy. I made sure not to overbake them. I followed the  recipe, except for using dried cranberries in place of raisins.  To pair with the cranberries, I used 1 tsp. vanilla and 1 tsp. of orange extract.  I think next time I will cut back the brown sugar, a bit. This is a great recipe and lots of ways to make them into different varieties.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was great. I used a hybrid recipe from different people's suggestions. I used oat bran instead of the wheat germ, applesauce instead of oil, whole wheat flour, and Stevia baking blend instead of sugar and honey. They were easy to make and easy to cut when warm. I took another's suggestion and used 1 cup of applesauce instead of the oil. I think they still came out slightly dry. Next time, I think I'll use half oil and half applesauce. Overall a good handy recipe to tailor as you like??

I only used 1/4 cup unpacked brown sugar and it still tastes yummy.  I actually can't stop eating it!   Next time I'll try adding Apple sauce to moisten it up a bit.

I have made this a few times now and love it!  I have changed it each time.  This last time I wanted to increase the protein factor.  I added quinuoa instead of the wheat germ and added peanut butter and coconut oil instead of the vegetable oil.  I topped them with slice almonds.  My husband and his friends loooove them!

These came out great, although I changed the recipe. I used half white flour and half wheat flour, I added 1/2 cup sliced almonds, 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips, and replaced 1/4 cup of raisins with dried cranberries. Will make again.

I made this recipe exactly as directed and they were really good. I stored them in a airtight container and the remained chewy, which I prefer. Today I made them and used  3/4 cup melted coconut oil instead of vegetable. Added 1/2 cup of unsweetened shredded coconut and 1/2 chopped pecans and followed the rest of the recipe and directions. They may not make it to the airtight container !!!!

This is such an easy recipe to change up, modify to however you like it best, whether that means making it tastier or healthier (or both?!?)!!!!  I usually use coconut palm sugar in place of the brown sugar.  In place of the wheat germ, I substitute flax meal and chia seed.  For flour, I use 3/4 c whole wheat and 1/4 teff flour.  Instead of raisins, I might add dates, and/or dried blueberries.  Instead of 1/2 c vegetable oil, I put in 1 banana and 1/4 c peanut butter.  If the batter seems too dry, I'll then add a bit of vegetable oil.  The rest of the recipe stays the same.  I find so long as the wet and dry ingredients balance out, it works.  I convection bake at 325% for 20 minutes or so.  My young grandsons both like these;  they call them "cookies," and I feel good about offering these healthy treats to them, so that makes this recipe a winner to me!!!  I know that's a lot of changes, but I always begin with this basic simple recipe.

First time trying these granola bars, and they were amazing!!!  I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil because I am trying to find new ways of incorporating this healthy alternative.  I added mini-chocolate chips and butterscotch chips! Delicious! I will never buy them again!

These are super good! Just wanted to second several people that recommended cutting the sugar down to 1/2cup or even 1/3cup. The first time I made them I cut the sugar down and they were perfect! The second batch I forgot to do so and they're much too sweet for our preferences. They're almost like a desert instead of a snack with the extra sugar. We also like them chewy so we followed the instruction to not fill entire pan and to not  cook them as long as recommended! Excellent results there as well. Either way they don't last very long in our house, we have to ration them out so they're not all gone the first day!

So I'm like you, I want a review done on the actual recipe not the changes. So I made the recipe, even went on a special trip to buy wheat germ, got home to make and realized I had NO HONEY! So round one: made to order for the recipe but substituted light agave for honey, WONDERFUL! Don't worry about storing, your kids will eat them to fast to concern yourself with making sure the zip-lock bag is closed or not. Second time around, still had not bought honey and now out of agave, so substituted 1/2 cup or a little less light corn syrup and a big heaping serving spoon of peanut butter. OMG, I don't honestly know if by the morning there will be any left for my kids!

Let me start out by saying this is not a bad recipe! But the name is a bit misleading.These are no granola bars! They are in between a cake and a cookie!Flavor wise they are pretty good! I always try and make a recipe for the first time as written I feel like this recipe deserves a second time around with some changes that suit my taste.I will enjoy these bars in the morning with my coffee :) Next time I try them I am certainly decreasing the sugar and oil! I might try and replace the oil with peanut butter or apple sauce to try and make them a bit more healthy and try only using one egg and double the recipe... Im going to play around with this recipe! Thank you for sharing! Its always fun trying different granola bar recipes!!!

I've made these many time and they are wonderful! Very sweet, though. You could easily reduce the sugar by half or more and not miss it because you'll still have the sweetness from the honey. Easier and faster to make than oatmeal cookies.

I've made this a couple of times now, with different variations. Adding Apple pieces instead of raisins or chocolate chips. It was very moist with apples, and more of a traditional granola bar consistency with the chocolate chips. The next time I made it with chocolate chips, I added a 1/4 cup of applesauce so they didn't turn out so dry- much better. All around good recipe; I am making a version with a layer of jam in the middle today. I must mention that you need to grease your hands when spreading it in the pan or else you will get more on your hands than in the pan.

a little more like a bar cookie than a granola bar but very tasty and a step healthier. I reduced the brown sugar to 1/4c.  and used mini chocolate chips instead of raisins.

I make these bars every week now. I cut the sugar by half and only bake them for 23 minutes . They come out soft and delicious. I cut them into bars and place them in ziplock bags. I grab one each morning for my breakfast on my way out of the house.

I love this recipe! My girls love them too! Instead of raisins, though, I use chocolate chips (sometimes I add in pecans) and I use agave for the honey! Otherwise they are just wonderful.

These are wonderful!  I like to modify recipes to make them low sugar for my family.  For this one I use 1/2 cup of applesauce and reduce the brown sugar to 1/4 cup and the honey also to 1/4 cup.  I also chop up nuts to put in (walnuts or pecans).  They come out delicious, sweet, but not too sweet.  My family loves them too and they are filling so we eat them with lunch or my husband takes one for breakfast.  Great alternative to the food store processed granola bars and there are a million ways you can modify this to make different kinds of granola bars.

I know I've made this before but forgot to leave a review. Original recipe is great from what I recall. Second time around I added a mix of wheat germ and milled flax seed, chopped almonds, pecans, walnuts, and about 1/2 cup of cranberries. This is how we eat our granola cereal and happy to say bar form tastes really good too.

Awesome recipe a little dry so will add 1/4 cup of applesauce today on my second batch. We all love it at this household. Also liked that the recipe calls for oil instead of margarine or butter. Did reduce the sugar down to 1/2 cup . Great recipe thanks pregocook for posting!

This is a great granola bar recipe. I only find it too sweet, so I reduced the brown sugar and honey by half and omitted the raisins. It does make thin bars, so since I like them thicker I either double the recipe or make it in a half size pan. The recipe is also a great base recipe to include add ins like coconut, nuts, and chocolate chips. I have not tried the chocolate chips yet, but I could have chocolate in anything.

Yummy! I did as others before me tried and cut back the sugar. I had no wheat germ so I used wheat flour. I only made one batch so far with raisins, chocolate chips and sunflower nuts. Really good. Can hardly wait to try again!

These are very good! I used coconut palm sugar for brown sugar and Spelt flour. Instead of raisins, I used semi sweet chocolate chips. I used a dough scraper to form a nice 1 inch margin around edge. Great evening snack!

THE GRANOLA bars tend to be dry I think the flour and oats needed to be reduced. They do taste good and my boys ate them. I added organic cranberries and pecans.

Made these tonight, I thought they were average, probably won't make again. With that said, I did use Olive oil versus vegetable oil as that's all we had/use.

Love love love these! These have become a regular staple in my home and they always get eaten up! For the dried fruit I do a mixture of rasins, crasins, & dried blueberries. I use wheat flour, add crushed almonds, and sometimes flax seeds.  Amazing!

These are great, and really flexible to accommodate whatever ingredients you have on hand. I've made with spelt flour and used applesauce in place of the oil. Always good.

Just made them for the first time. Followed recipe but substituted wheat bran for wheat germ. I used olive oil and no raisins. They are a little too wet but stay together quite nicely. Next time I will add some nuts. A little more crunch would make them perfect!

I found it to be a little too sweet for my liking.  Seemed more of a dessert/cookie bar than what I was hoping for.  That being said it wasn't bad at all.  My kids enjoyed it.  I think I will take some other reviewers advice and add less sugar and do some whole wheat flour to make it less sweet and a little healthier.  I will definitely be making this again.  Way cheaper than buying granola bars at the store.

This is the type of recipe that allows for creativity. I have made cranberry walnut, chocolate chip, coco banana. It did take a couple of tries for me to get this recipe to suit our tastes. But it is a wonderful starter for those looking to provide healthy food for themselves or family.

I just took these out of the oven after seeing them in the magazine.  I made them for the kids 4H weekend so I'm hoping they find them as tasty as I do right now!  I used craisins instead of raisins and I liked that choice.  I didn't have wheat germ so I just used more flour and I only had a quarter cup of honey so I used dark corn syrup to supplement.  Tastes great!

We did not care for these. They weren't soft chewy granola bars, they weren't crunchy...somewhere in between...very weird texture for us.

This was great. I led out the wheat germ due to a gluten allergy; substituted bob red mill gluten free all purpose flour. Next time I will add chopped nuts and pumpkin seeds.

Ok, I'm giving this a 4star because I made some changes and didn't think it would be fair to down a star on it. I only used 1/2 cup sugar (as I had read some reviews) and I thought 2 tsp vanilla was too much so I only used 1. And I added in about 1/4 cup of sunflower seeds. Then I baked this in a 8x11 pan,which I think was the perfect thickness.  And baked for 30 mins.  They came out to be a good chewiness for me.  Will give this a try again, and probably use the full amount of sugar and a tad bit more of cinnamon.

I've made these several times. They have been a favorite and are great for packing in lunches even for my hard working teen son and husband. I've substituted wheat flour for the white flour with no notice. I've also added coconut, slivered almonds and cranraisins for variation. One time I put chocolate chips and slivered almonds instead. I double mine and put into a jelly roll pan. Mine always turn out chewy. I individually wrap them and put them in the snack box container. I can't keep them stocked and tell my kids they are only for lunches just so they will last the whole week. Thank you for a great recipe.

Made this with a couple of the suggested changes... 1/2 c sugar and 1/2 c. unsweetened applesauce. I also only baked for 20 min on a cookie tray. I was able to make these gluten free by switiching the wheat germ to oat bran and flour to sorghum. Added more dried fruit. I know it ends up being a lot of changes, but the general idea was great! Thank you.

I've been making these for awhile.  My husband likes to take granola bars to work as a snack.  I've been trying to avoid processed food so I make them now instead of buying them.  I've reduced the amount of sugar in them, I add a cup of the individual applesauce to make them moister and my husband like craisins and chocolate chips.

I LOVE this recipe!! Even my picky children can't get enough of the bars! I added half a cup of natural peanut butter, crushed peanuts, walnuts, cashew pieces, shredded coconut, craisins, ground flax seed, sunflower seeds and raisins. You can add anything you want! I went off chocolate over a year ago so I did not add any chocolate. I also added a lot more cinnamon and vanilla than the original recipe called for. Next time I am going to substitute some of the oil with apple sauce and see how it goes!

Yep, we loved this recipe and it's now a family staple.  I always decrease the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and I've tried several variations--substituting golden syrup (an Aussie thing) for honey, chopped peanuts & coconut or chocolate chips & coconut for the raisins. Whatever I can find at the time.  They're always good!

I have made this recipe many, many times; and it's pretty great as written. With that being said (and with how many times I've made it), I've modified it to fit my family's taste. The last batch I made, I used 2 1/2 cups old fashioned oats, 1/2 cup flour, 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1/4 tsp salt, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ground ginger, 1 cup of raisins, 1/3 cup honey, 1 egg beaten, 2 tsps vanilla, and then I mashed 1 medium banana into a half-cup measure and then topped off the remaining space in the half-cup measure with vegetable oil (not an exact measurement, but it reduces the amount of fat in the recipe). I followed the same instructions, mixing the dry ingredients, and then adding in the wet ingredients. Mine usually require the full 30 minutes. I have also made it using molasses in place of the honey; have tried it with both all purpose and wheat flours; and it always turns out good..So my rating is based on the original recipe AND the fact that it so easily adapted to your tastes, dietary needs, and/or simply what ingredients you have on hand....Oh, and I almost never have wheat germ in my pantry, so I haven't made it with that, but it still turns out great.

I've started making this recipe every few weeks and mailing it home to my parents and grandparents. They love it so much they freeze half so it lasts longer! I make a few changes - 1 1/2 cups oats, 1/2 cup rice crispy cereal (to give it more crunch) - and instead of a full cup of flour I use 1/2 cup white flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour.  Then I toss in whatever dried fruit, nuts, sunflower seeds and chocolate chips I have in the house. Wonderful!

This recipe is a keeper. My kids, ages 3 and 5, and husband all loved them. Good for an after school snack. I used whole wheat flour and 1/2 tb of cinnamon. First time I made them I used dried cranberries. 2nd time dried cherries and dried apples.

We call these "cookies" in my house, but they are the healthiest cookies EVER as far as I'm concerned.  I've even switched out the egg for 1/4 cup of unsweetened apple sauce (we have an egg allergy here) and they still turn out great.  I started to add dried cranberries to the raisins, and I usually use more than are called for and have even added flax seed meal.  It seems like there's just no way to mess these up.  My husband low carb/low GI diets so I altered it for him as well, using splenda brown sugar and different fruits (dried pineapple and mango) with a few extra varieties of nuts.

these granola bars are perfect for a healthy snack. i would recommend only letting them chill for 10 minutes, but no longer. I then wrapped them tightly in plastic wrap and they stayed moist, soft and chewy for several days.

Awesome.  You could probably half, the sugar, too, if you want to make them healthier.  But they're great if you follow the recipe exactly.

Made this for my kids with a small adjustment. If anyone eats Mini Wheat cereal out there, you know how there is always those crumbs in the bottom that the kids don't want to eat? I keep them and add them to this recipe. Typically, i use a cup of mini wheat crumbs in place of the wheat germ and 1/2 cup of oats. I cut down (or omit) the sugar as the mini wheat crumbs have sugar already, and the kids DIVE into these. I'm making them at least once a week!

I made these for my husband and kids to take on a hike into the mountains.  I heard that there was some hoarding going on, so I guess they liked them.I found that if you didn't bake them the prescribed time, as suggested in some of the reviews, that they were too sticky and fell apart.  I put them back in and baked about the amount of time stated in the recipe, and they were much better--chewy, and didn't fall apart.  I also added some chocolate chips.  Good trail food.

This granola bar recipe was tremendous!!! I did the recipe as written, although I didn't add the raisins and didn't use wheat germ since I didn't have it on hand. It came out wonderful! After 5 minutes out of the oven, I poured some chocolate chips over the top and spread it with a rubber spatula while the chocolate chips were melting. I placed the bars in the freezer. The granola bars are fantastic as is or from the freezer!! Thank you!!

I followed the recipe, but ended up cooking the bars for less time as suggested by other reviewers.  They turned out tasting a lot like oatmeal raisin cookies and the texture was chewier like the typical chewy granola bars.  My 3 and 5 year olds were not to crazy about them, but I, of course, loved them and ate the entire batch in just a few days.  I may make them again in the future, but for now I'll have to search for a new recipe that my children will actually eat.

My picky eater even liked these!  Added 1/2 cup flax, no white sugar, used 1/2 cup honey and 1/2 cup maple syrup for sweetness.  1/3 cup oil was plenty and I will probably reduce it further the next time.

MOIST! Baked for only 20 mins., stored in ziploc bags and tried the next day – infinitely better than store-bought. Super, super moist and flavorful. Filling too.

yum!, I followed recipe, except I used 3/4 c all purpose and 1/4 c whole wheat. I also added some trail mix and dried blueberries. Also, I only baked for 20 minutes, like so many others had suggested, and Im thankful I took them out when I did. I do think putting apple sauce in this would be delicious. Next batch I will try just that.  thank you for the recipe.

This is a great granola bar recipe.  I like the flexibility of the recipe.  I make this recipe once a week and eat for a breakfast bar or snack.  I like adding whey protein powder to boost the amount of protein in them.  I sometimes use whole wheat pastry flour intead of all-purpose flour.  Instead of raisins, I will put one cup of craisens, chocolate chips, and/or nuts.  Also, after reading the other reviews, I add 1/2 cup of applesauce.

This recipe has become my most requested. I make a double batch; leave one in the fridge for my kiddos to eat as snacks and put one batch in the freezer. When it's time to go to a playdate or on a road trip, I pull them out of the freezer and go. I do cut the br. sugar and the honey...they're still so sweet. And I add lots of extras: unsweetened coconut, raw sunflowers, choc. chips, chia seeds, etc. Yum!

I finally tried these after seeing them recommended so many times! Very good. I stayed close to the recipe using less brown sugar as so many recommended. I just made them again and beefed them up adding milled flaxseed in lieu of wheat germ, slivered almonds, chopped dried apples and subbed applesauce for the oil. You really can't got wrong with these. I put them in individual baggies in a bowl by the fruit so they stay chewy and are available to grab running out the door. Thank you! So easy and so good!

I've made this several times.  Helpful tip (for beginners at least)  I found it easier to spray my hands with nonstick spray to pat the mixture into the pan.   It took me three times of trying the recipe to make it easier to get in the pan without a mess.  I add chocolate chips, but I've found that I have to mix it instead of putting it on top (as some recipes do), otherwise it's just too sweet and messy.  I like to use the mini chocolate chips also, personal preference anyway.   Also (beginners)  do not use olive oil!  My husband used all of my oil and that's all I had.  Decided to try it, the olive oil taste was too much. Anyway, they don't last in our house very long.  We leave out raisins because my kids don't like them, but I'm sure they'd taste great with them.  Love this recipe.

These seem to me more like cookie bars than granola bars, but the flavor is awesome. My tweaks: I cut the honey by half and used biscoff (like peanut butter) spread for the other half. I used peanut butter chips instead of raisins, almond meal instead of wheat germ, and 2 scoops of protein shake mix to pump up the protein. Also, I made these with my stand mixer instead of mixing by hand, and it was super easy. they were oven ready before the oven had even preheated.

Use a flexible baking spatula to mix, spread and flatten into the dish. No mess and no waste that way. The mixture got pretty brown around the edges at 350 so with about 10 minutes left I turned the heat down about 25 degrees. That solved it but maybe next time I will cook it at 325 for the 30 minutes. I got 18 good size bars out of the batch only and only trimmed one short end off that baked too much. My kids liked them. I was only relatively satisfied with the flavor and texture. But so far I haven't found a granola bar recipe that is perfect. But I'm making for the kids and if they like them then that's good enough for me.

Our family favorite. We use craisins because we prefer those over raisins. We've tried other variations, but they either didn't turn out or just weren't as tasty as this recipe.

Loved these granola bars.  My son and I cannot stop eating them.  Warning to pregnant women - they are addictive.  I decreased the brown sugar to 1/2 C and they were still a little too sweet for me.  I will decrease to 1/4 C next time.  I used dried blueberries and dried cranberries and cooked the bars for 22 mins.  They were chewy and perfect.  A big hit!

Addictive and delicious. I doubled the recipe for a jelly roll pan as a reviewer suggested, and used 5 egg whites instead of whole eggs (just because that's what I had at the time.) Subbed craisins and chopped almonds. Put the mixture on a silpat and baked for 18.5 minutes. They are soft, and once they finally cool completely the honey and wheat flavors really stand out. The pan I used is larger than an average pan, so it may take longer for a normal-sized one. You can tell when it's cooked through just by looking, though-the same as a bar cookie. The almond pieces look nice pressed into the top, (another suggestion I borrowed) but I might try mixing them in next time so not as many fall out while I'm gobbling these down.

Super versatile recipe!  I used 1/3 cup sweetened vanilla protein powder instead of the brown sugar (I'll use 1/2 cup next time), whole wheat flour and agave nectar and honey.  Also used a combination of 1/3 cup oil and applesauce to = 1/2 cup.  I only baked them for 20 minutes and they were perfect.  There is so much you can do with this recipe!

I left out the raisins (not a huge fan of them) and the cinnamon and put in 1 cup of mini choc chips. Super Duper yummy. I also threw some sprinkles on half of it. Had to do it for my 3yr old. PS she also loved them.

I have made these and the family loves them!  I reduce the cooking time, only about 15-18 min.  My family loves these with white chocolate chips and chopped up dried apricots.  Enjoy!

Wow!  I was looking to make granola bars for my 13 & 10 yo sons and this recipe was recommended by several friends.  Their recommendations were spot on!  I made the recipe as listed for the first batch but swapped out the raisins for chocolate chips.  This time I cut back the brown sugar & honey about half and they are just amazing!  Will make again & again!

These are pretty good, taste-wise. Although, the amount you end up with is not actually enough to fill a 9X13 pan! So, the edges turned out thin and burnt :-( This recipe needs to be adjusted. Next time, I will double the recipe & I'm sure it will fill a 9X13 pan perfectly then.

All the moms and toddlers gobbled them up and I'll be certainly making them again. But, with a few changes: all whole wheat flour, 1/2 as much sweetener, 1/4 cup ground flaxseed, 1/2 cup coconut flakes, 1TB cinnamon, and only bake for 15-20 minutes. Delish!!!!!!

These were great!  So many options to tinker with, but the base was good to hold these together.  I did use instead of honey, 1/2 c light corn syrup, about half way then the rest honey, but I may just make this 50/50 for honey and maple syrup.  I did use wheat flour, 1/2 cup raisins, 1/2 cup dried cranberry.  I used 1/2c brown sugar, 1 1/2c quick oats and 1/2 c puffed rice cereal since I have 3 boxes of it.  They turned out great!  Nuts would be a great addition too.

Yum, and SO easy.  A great recipe to make with kids - you can sub in whatever fruit or chips or nuts you want.  Definintely lower the cooking time a bit though.

I've tried different granola bar recipes on this site.  They have either stuck to the pan and could not be removed without wrecking them, eventhough my pan was greased, or they just would not firm up and would just crumble apart.  This is the BEST recipe.  The flavors are great.  You can substitute in different things like different flavored baking chips, nuts, seeds, dried fruit.  The options are limitless.  It's just up to you.  And they cut easily, hold nicely and remove from a pan easily.  This is the ONLY granola bar recipe I want to use from now on.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

These are easy to make and easy to modify. Stay chewy if stored in airtight container. Be sure to cut before totally cooled. These will be my go to granola bar recipe. Disappeared quickly. Thanks for sharing!!

Yum!! I lowered the brown sugar (1/4 cup), subsituted flaxseed meal for the wheat germ, used 1/4 cup of molasses instead of the honey (just didn't have any in the house), and used canola oil AND about a 1/2 cup of applesauce. They came out chewy, but held their shape. Perfect for my younger toddler who doesn't do crunchy yet.

I just made my second attempt at these last night.  I followed suggestions to add another egg to make them chewy and to help with the extra ingredients I added:  walnuts, pecans, almonds, sunflower seeds, flaxseed meal, peanut butter, and dark chocolate chips.  I also only did a 1/4 c honey as I had run out.  They taste scrumptious!  Next time I'll do a 1/2 c honey and reduce the brown sugar a bit.

The flavor was really good, but as other reviewers stated a bit too sweet.  But I would make this recipe again with just less brown sugar.  I doubled the recipe.  These where my changes:  1. Instead of 1 c of wheat germ, I only used a 1/2 cup but added a 1/2 c of oat bran 2. Used whole wheat flour instead of white flour 3. Added 1/2 c slivered almonds 4. 1 c apple sauce.

These were fantastic!  I didn't have wheat germ so I used ground flax seed instead.  I also used canola oil instead of vegetable oil.  They turned out amazing!  I think I may have found my new breakfast staple!  My daughter loved these also.

I really like this recipe. I like the texture.The first time I made them I cut back on the honey and sugar,per reviews. The second time I made them I went completely according to the recipe and I found the recipe fit our taste perfectly !I do think, however, this is the kind of recipe that can be played around with to suit personal taste without affecting the bars too much. I plan to use dried cranberries with nuts in the future. Thanks for a great recipe!

I am 17 and love baking and making meals for my family. we don't eat any sugar at all--we always use honey or agave syrup (a natural sweetner), so I just substituted these sweetners in the place of brown sugar. Absolutely fabulous bars--they don't last more than two days at my house!!

Sooooo yummy! I like to use "Porridge Oats", which are a combination of oat flakes, oat bran, wheat bran and flaxseed. I just use 2 1/2 cups of this mix and omit the wheat germ because I rarely have it in the house. 

I love how versatile this recipe is. You can use any dried fruit or nuts in place of the raisins. My favourite is dried cranberries and a handful of sliced almonds. If you want to make these with chocolate chips, I would recommend cutting back on the sugar. Otherwise they are very sweet and end up tasting like cookies (still delicious just not what I was going for)

Every morning for breakfast I eat granola and I love the recipe "Megan's Granola" here on AllRecipes.com. However, I'm pregnant and need something to eat sooner in the morning, so I thought I'd try a granola bar recipe.

This one is great. It's healthier than a few of the others on this website, and you can make it even more so. I use 1/4 cup of applesauce and 1/4 of vegetable oil to save some fat grams. I also like to mix it up with dried blueberries or craisins instead of raisins and added and add in some nuts. Yum!

Great, the family loves even the mix before it goes in the oven! I would change just a little though:
1st, I didn't have enough rolled oats (only 1 cup) I used it, but I also crushed cherrios and Fiber One into about 1 or 1 and a half cups and didn't use wheat germ.
2nd, I used maple syrup instead of honey and I used the half cup but, only put in about three fourths of that.  
3rd, For healthier option I used Safflower oil instead of vegetable oil. 
Turned out yummy!

These bars are really lacking in texture & taste. I don't think I approve of using egg in granola, its chewy & unappealing & now im stuck with a big pan of this so now im suffering through them-yes, *suffering*. Find another recipe!

Awesome granola bars!  My little guy loves these...I make them with dried blueberries, dried cranberries and chopped raw almonds.  Delish!

Wow, yummy and easy.  I wonder if there is a way to make them with less sugar though.  Probably wouldn't be as good, but more healthy!

I am in search of a granola bar with a chewier texture. However, with that said, this recipe is good. I subbed the raisins for Craisins since that's what I had, reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and added about 3/4 cup of chocolate chips (next time I'll use the minis). Plus, at the last minute I decided to add 2 heaping spoonfuls of peanut butter just for a little something else. Altogether tasty and the true test comes tomorrow from my two little boys! I will most likely use this again and continue to tweak it to my own liking but good nonetheless! Thanks!

They were ok, I've made them twice now.  I just think the flavor or the texture is too heavy, I think it's the oil.  Other than the heaviness, the flavor was great.  I will probably keep tweeking around with it, but as is, I rated a 3.  My 2 year old really likes them.

Fantastic! Used whole-wheat flour, left out the honey (it was just sweet enough- not too sweet), used more flour and/or oats in place of wheat germ, and only baked for around 18 mins. This recipe is very flexible. Great healthy snack!

This is the recipe I use for the hubbies lunch every day.I make a batch,cut,wrap and freeze. It works well for him. They taste really good and no junk.(use wheat flour,coconut oil) Easy to change up flavors from one week to the next too. Addins I've tried are coconut,cranberries,dried pineapple,banana chips,chocolate chips,walnuts,
almonds,peanuts.

The flavor is okay, but if I brought these to a toddler playgroup I would risk being sued for bringing a choking hazard.  They are very, very hard - not chewy - just hard!

Love, love, love this recipe! The first time I made them, I baked them for 30 minutes and that was too long. The second time I adjusted the time to 23 minutes and they are PERFECT!!! I cut them up immediately and put them into individual baggies. Great to grab on the way out the door!  So easy to change up just by adding different dried fruits, nuts, etc. This is a keeper! I have already handed this recipe out to a handfull of moms! Thanks for sharing!

I love these bars. Thanks for the recipe. I did alter it a bit, I only used 1/4 cup honey and 1/4 cup canola oil. I added 1/3 cup skim milk to get it to the right consistency and they turned out great with fewer calories!

I would not change this recipe in the least! I made a double batch and I believe this made them thicker than just a single batch would. They are perfect - absolutely delicious! I can't wait to share them with my coffee/tea time girls! :)

The alterations I made were: used 1/2 cup brown sugar, no wheat germ (didn't have any), 1tsp cinnamon, no raisins, canola oil, 1/2 cup apple sauce, 1 mashed banana, 1 cup coconut, 1/2 cup chopped dried apricots.  Tasted great but only made a batch of 15, perhaps I just like to cut bigger bars?

I made this recipe but used others advise of using apple sauce (1/2 cup), reducing the brown sugar (1/2 cup), use whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose and I added some ground flax seed (1/3 cup) instead of the wheat germ.  I also  baked them for a shorter period of time as others recommended (18 min).  They did come out chewy (not crispy) and my family really liked them.  This is a perfect basic recipe that SHOULD be modified according to your taste.  For me, I'll be adding peanut butter and nuts and I'll bake them a little longer so they're just in between chewy and crunchy.  5 stars for providing a great base to start from.

Yay!!! A NUT-FREE Granola bar that is yummy too!  Which makes these great for playgroups and treats to take to school, for those kids that have nut allergies.. which statistically is one in 5.  My son developed a nut allergy when he was 7 and it has been an interesting road.  He used to adore granola  bars and such until that fateful day when he ate one and had to go to the ER.  Now he can have his granola bars again in his lunch box when he goes to middle school.  Thanks for this great recipe!  And what is really superb is that all of these ingredients are what I keep on hand anyway.  I don't need to make special trips to the store to make a treat!

I thought this was a good jumping off point for making my own granola bar mixes. I give it four stars due to the use of all the white sugar and white flour. I subbed whole wheat pastry flour and reduced the sugar and used maple syrup instead in some cases.

I made this few times. For healthy people, I made it with whole wheat flower and reduced the amount of sugar. I added some chocolate chips to it once , and I also added some vanilla hemp granola to the mix. It was amazing.. everyone loved it..

these were really good! i made the following changes: cut brown sugar down to 1/2 cup, increased cinnamon to 1 tsp, used less raisins and added chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, as well as some sesame seeds, sunflower seeds and flaxseed. next time i would like to sub some of the ap flour for whole wheat and some of the oil for applesauce. i didnt spread the mix all the way till the edge of the pan and baked for about 25-30 mins. they are nice and chewy. to pour the honey easily, make sure u use the same cup u measured the oil in. i think 3/4 cup of sugar is too much, they were plenty sweet with 1/2 -but i also had added chocolate chips, so maybe that helped make it sweeter. overall a great recipe that u can adapt and make changes to according to ur preferences. thanks for sharing!

Love this recipe! I varied a little by switching to whole wheat flour and less brown sugar.  Also added some mini chocolate chips and cranberries and only baked them for 16 minutes.  They are so good-perfect snack for me and the kids!

I just made my first batch of these and they are yummy!  I didn't have wheat germ so I left that out but I did add some chopped almonds.  I will definitely be making these again!!

I wanted to add to my original review that since I started making these, my 14 yr old daughter has also started making them and hers come out perfectly as well.  This recipe really is a no-brainer if you follow the directions and "tweak" it slightly to fit your personal taste.  Excellent!

These bars are excellent!! We got tired of all the sugar and chemicals in store bought granola bars. These are very easy to make. After I pour them into my pan, I take a long sheet of waxed paper and press all around on top of the mixture. That way they are very even and all the way to the edges with no dirty hands.

Very good, but kids complained about the bars being "too hard".  I'd suggest a 15-20 bake time instead of 30 minutes.

These were delicious! My kids loved them... my daughter doesn't like raisins so we skipped those but used walnuts. I didn't have any wheat germ handy so I used unprocessed bran. Amazing I could please all four of my kids!

I've made these at least 3 times and Homemade Chewy Granola Bars (from this site) is far better. These are cakey and just not right but the other recipe is perfect, if you're looking for a granola bar, try those. :)

Oh man.  This is out of this world.  I like that they are cake-like with my substitutions.  I reduced the brown sugar to 1/3 c.,  now I can definitely reduce it some more or even eliminate it!  I do not own any wheat germ or flax yet, I have to look into it, so I just eliminated that part all together.  First, I upped the cinnamon to 1tsp and used whole wheat flour.  Next, I subbed sugar-free maple syrup for the honey and used whites instead of an egg.  I also used 1c. of Applesauce like others have suggested.  I'm going to the store to get some dried fruit since I don't have any to make some more this week!  I'm sick of wasting money on breakfast snacks for my breaks at work and I could make them healthier, yesssssss!  Thank you all :) Awesome.

DE-LISH!!!!!!  These were even better than I expected them to be!  They taste like a healthier (but, good healthy) version of an oatmeal cookie.  I could eat the entire pan, right now.  Two things-I used half white and half whole wheat flour and WATCH THE COOKING TIME.  I only cooked them for 18 minutes and they would have been way overcooked had I left them in for 30.  I probably could have even done a couple less.  So, just watch them.  When the edges start to brown...take them out.  I also liked the tip of not spreading them out all the way and leaving an inch border around the edge of the pan.  It helps the edges remain chewy instead of crispy (unless you like them crispy, that is).  My daughter is consuming them at a very fast pace.  ;-)

As other reviewers noted, this recipe can easily be changed to suit your personal tastes. However it is great as is. One suggestion: after greasing my pan, I line it with foil and grease that. When bars are baked, I remove them by lifting the foil out. They are much easier to cut that way. I pack two in a snack-size bag and freeze them in a resealable freezer bag. So easy to grab for my husband's lunch or a quick breakfast. mmm!

These turned out delicious, despite the fact that I forgot the flour. They were rather difficult to get out of the pan, but as previously mentioned I did forget the flour. I didn't have the wheat germ so I substituted 3/4 cup of corn flakes and switched dried cranberries for the raisins. My family loves them. They turned out super chewy.

Just made these, I made a double batch and made half Chocolate Chip/Bannana Chip and the other half White Chip/Dried Cherries.  I plan on making more and taking a few different kinds camping this weekend.  I also only baked them for 18 mins.

These turned out great.  I doubled this recipe and put the dough in a Pampered Chef Large Bar Pan (this is made of stone).  I baked it for 35 minutes and it was perfectly golden brown.  I substituted chocolate chips for the raisins.  I think you could substitute just about any dried fruit as long as its cut up.

Great recipe.  I made them into cookie mounds instead of bars and baked them for about 20 minutes and they came out tender in the middle and a little crunchy around the edges.  A very versatile recipe as well.  I added coconut flakes, walnuts, and 2 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder.  Yummy grad-n-go breakfast.  Next time, I'll try dried cranberries and maybe some orange zest or coconut, dried pinapple, and macadamian nuts.

Yum!  I made these today when I realized I needed to make yet another trip to the grocery store for granola bars... They were fabulous!  My husband never wants me to buy the store-bought ones again!  I used a cookie sheet so the edges weren't touching the sides but they still got a bit dark.  Used whole-wheat flour instead and flaxseed instead of wheat germ (what I had on hand).  Also added dried cranberries and chopped almonds.  Wrapped them individually in plastic wrap to stay moist.  Delicious!!

These are awesome...I love them just as much as my 2 year old! I did substitute chocolate chips for raisins, and cut back the brown sugar to 1/2 cup. I will probably cut that back a little more next time too. And might try adding dried cranberries too...

These were very good! I replaced the oil with 1cup of applesauce to make it healthier and also cut the brown sugar down to 1/3c. I added dried cranberries and pumpkin seeds. Only baked for 20 minutes. Overall, I think I'll be making a couple tweeks to this recipe to really make it my own. But a very good start! I'm looking forward to trying it with peanut butter

These are absolutely delicious.  My husband and I can not stop eating them!  The only change I had to make was to use whole wheat flour - it was all I had in the cupboard.  I make two recommendations: 1.  Have everything ready to go (pan greased, oven on, etc.) BEFORE you start to mix with your hands, and 2.  Put the mixing bowl in the sink, or on a low surface, because it's a bit difficult to mix if the bowl is deep and up to high.  I had to stand on my toes and I'm 5'6"!

I thought these turned out fantastic.  My 4yr old loves them.  They were fast and easy to make.    I made a few adjustments to fit the ingredients I had on hand. I used only 1/2 cup of brown sugar 1/2 cup of honey and 1/2 cup of agave nectar flax seed instead of wheat germ added 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts and 1/4 cup of sweetened coconut  Delicious and just as great 3 days later.  Will definitely make them again and again.

My family loves these bars. My kids make these each week and add things like white chocolate chips, coconut, dried cranberries, whatever is lying around. Thanks so much for this yummy recipe!

Our family has also fallen in love with these granola bars!  I reduce the sugar to only 2 tablespoons to suit our tastes, but they're still fabulous!

good, chewy granola bar. I used 1/2c brown sugar as suggested and it was plenty sweet. Wish I'd had some applesauce on hand so I could cut down on the oil, will definitely be making these again.

Ok..I read all reviews. I made two batches at once. One I made exactly to recipe, used olive oil instead of reg veg oil....turned out wonderful. I have VERY picky kids and they loved the original recipe. The second batch I made more healthy as a review suggested to sub the oil for apple sauce....it was terrible, the granola bars were like rubber bricks. This recipe is a great homemade healthy treat!

These are really tasty.  Due to my own shopping error, I didn't have wheat germ.  I substituted sunflower seeds (1/4 cup) and flax seed (1/4).  The seeds gave a nice extra crunch.  Because of what some others said I used about 2 Tbsp less of sugar.  My husband, expecting dessert, thought they weren't sweet enough.  Thinking breakfast treat, I found them just right.

Very good!  I only used 1/3 c. brown sugar and that seemed just right for us.  I also added 2 T sesame seeds along with 3/4 c dried cranberries (in place of the optional raisins).

Delicious!  I left out the wheat germ since I didn't have it on hand.  I doubled the recipe and used whole wheat flour and sunflower oil.  I added dried cranberries, sunflower seeds and sliced almonds.  I used a cookie sheet and only baked them for 20 minutes.

This recipe was okay, nothing special. But this is because I used 1/4 sugar as suggested by others (not a good idea - for my taste buds!). I did add 1/2 c chocolate chips and 1/2 c craisins and this made the recipe a lot better. That said, it is very likely I will use this recipe again - with the full amount of sugar!

These were pretty good. I did find them a little too much like a dense muffin consistency rather than a granola bar. Next time I will cut the flour in half and add more oats.

Loved these!  My family ate them all so none even made it to the lunch boxes. Update.  I have been making these weekly for about 6 mos now cutting them up and using those little snack bags for the kids and hubbies lunches.  I now make 36 servings so it fits into a cake pan and i use 2 cups rolled oats and 1 cup a combo of sunflower seeds, flax meal and flax seed. I may put raisins in one week and the next week I will use choc chips.  I have also put in slivered almonds.  This is a great recipe! Thank you

The most awesome thing about this recipe is the fact that it's customizable. I didn't have honey or wheat germ on hand, so I substituted molasses and flax seed. It was still delicious! I will definitely be making these again.

Delicious, cookie-like granola bars. I subbed in 1/3 cup whole wheat flour for the all purpose to make it healthier but other than that I didn't make any changes. I'm looking forward to trying other dried fruits in place of the raisins and maybe adding some seeds or nuts.

Love these! So easy and versatile. You can substitute just about anything. A staple snack in my house now. However, I have found that by lining the baking dish with overhanging foil coated with cooking spray, it's much easier on cutting and cleanup.

These are  fantastic, I didn't have raisins around (I'm not much of a fan anyways) so I added dried and pitted dates, they were the perfect addition. When they first came out of the oven I was unsure I liked them but after they cooled in the fridge they were great. As a note make sure you REALLY cut and separate these things because they WILL stick together if you don't. I think next time I'm going to try adding some peanuts.

Great snack for my toddler to grab onto!  Wanting to make this healthier I adjusted the following; 1/3 C brown sugar, and it was still very sweet, next time I will do 1/4 Cup.  Not having wheat germ on hand I used 1/2 Cup fiber cereal.  1 tsp Cinnamon, Whole wheat flour, 1/2 Cup raisins (which gives it that extra sweetness)  little less than 1/2 Cup honey, 1/4 Cup vegetable oil.  Also my square 8 inch glass baking dish worked perfectly.  I only cooked them for 20 min as I prefer them to be chewy.  I can't wait to make them again and keep playing with the ingredients.

I've been looking for a fool-proof, easy, healthy granola bar recipe for ages and now I finally found it! I love that it is made with oil rather than butter. I used only 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 tsp salt and added some whole wheat flour instead of just white. I used half raisins and half dried goji berries to make it more interesting. I can't wait to try it with different dried fruit and nuts/seeds. Thanks for this super recipe!

Super easy to make, and very tasty! My sisters came over to the house and they both asked for the recipe! I send them to work with hubby when he doesn't have time for breakfast. (I really didn't care for them right after I made them.. but the next day they were so much better... it was probably just me..) Thanks for a really great recipe!

These bars are very good.  I used cranberries and apricots. I used whole wheat flour unstead of white flour other than that I followed the recipe and they turned out very nice.  I do agree that some people were using less sugar. I will probably try that next time because I like healthy stuff.

I hate to say it, but I made these by accident instead of another granola bar recipe I've used before. These just didn't cut it for me; I prefer my granola bars to be more chewy. They stick together pretty well, but came out flatter than I would like.

I'd been considering this recipe for a while. I didn't have most of the ingredients but read the reviews and used the suggestions and the recipe as a base and well...WOW. I used about 2/3 a cup of brown sugar, 1/2 flaxseed meal (I didn't have wheat germ), pumpkin seeds (shelled of course), Currants, tossed in some cocoa powder and about 1/2 a cup of peanut butter and used Scott's Porrage Oats (I love this brand!). They took about 20 minutes to bake and did spread a little so maybe I should have used more oat? Next time I will probably use less sugar. Heck, it might do to nix on the brown sugar entirely. But this is GREAT.

These were sooooo tasty!  I did use slightly less honey than called for and only 1/4 cup of brown sugar and they were plenty sweet.  I substituted craisins for the raisins and omitted the wheat germ.  I also used slightly less than 1/2 cup vegetable oil.  I added about 1/2 cup of slivered almonds and they were soooo delicous!

Great base recipe!  I don't usually measure...so I ended up using an entire container of oats, craisins, raisins, chocolate chips, almonds, and dried banana pieces.  It made so much I keep the rest in the freezer (but, they don't freeze b/c the only dairy in it are the 2 eggs!!) My roommates can't get enough of them.  Can't wait to make another batch!

These bars are not too sweet, so they are perfect for kids.  I halved the recipe and baked in a 8x8 pan for 20 min, but I could have cut the time down a bit.  They taste very much like some kind of oatmeal cookie bar.

I made these one day last week.  I used wheat flour(as suggested by others), 1/2 cup brown sugar, more oats, no wheat germ, 2 giant spoons of peanut butter, and chocolate chips.  We tried it while they were still warm and they were not good.  As soon as they cooled, they were WONDERFUL!!!  We ate the entire batch of them and are ready to try new versions.  I am also going to make the next batch with molasses instead of honey to make them a little sweeter and less brown sugar!

These have a lot of sugar and not my idea of a granola bar--more like a chewy cookie.

Love this recipe!  We have made so many variations of it now because you can really add anything you want- chopped almonds, cranberries, chocolate chips, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds etc.  We have made so many great combinations.  We have tried slowly cutting back some of the honey and sugar each time and it is still delicious.  These are now a money saving staple in our house.

These turned out more like a cookie than a granola bar. I'm sure I followed the recipe properly.

Excellent recipe - I've made it at least 20 times and it's different every time.  Easy to adapt. I substitute the following: whole-wheat flour or gluten-free flours (quinoa/buckwheat, etc), instead of APF; ground almonds for some/all of the brown sugar; flax seeds for some/all of the wheatgerm (esp if needing gluten-free); lemon juice +/- zest for the vanilla extract (I often add extra)' chopped dried apricots or dried cranberries or chopped prunes, or almond slivers or sunflower seeds for the raisins (NB - if using 3/4 cup raisins, you really, really need to add 1/4 cup applesauce, otherwise you just get granola; applesauce not needed for the other dried fruits for some reason...); almond oil or grapeseed oil for the veg oil. I also eliminate the salt - it doesn't need it.  The total ingredients, as listed, don't completely fill a 9x13 pan, so I tend to add an extra handful of oats, and use heaping measures of the rest.  This recipe is my staple snack food base and the kids adore it!  Thanks for sharing!!

Great recipe.  I'm so excited not to buy Nature Valley, now!  I reduced the sugar and highly recommend it.  There's so much honey in it to sweeten it sufficiently.  I like the many possibilities for variations on this recipe.  I look forward to another go at it, next time for a crunchier batch.

These are great. Didn't have wheat germ, so I just didn't use it. Put in 3/4 c. of peanutbutter and 3/4 c. of mini chocolate chips, instead of raisins [one grandaughter dosen't like raisins :p] Will make these again.

Good base recipe to start from--fun to mix in your own add-ins based on taste preferences! I used ground flaxseed in place of wheat germ, since it's what I had. I had a mix of dried cherries, dried cranberries, golden raisins, and a few white chocolate chips for fun.  Next time, I will underbake a little so they stay chewy longer. Overall, great recipe that is very easy to make.  TIP: line pan with foil for easier removal. I didn't do this the second time I made these and it was a pain that resulted in odd-shaped bars! Also, will reduce sugar next time by 1/3.

Very yummy bars, but they definitely do not take 30 minutes to bake. Mine took about 20 minutes. They are very delicious as written, but you can make them healthier by reducing the brown sugar at least to 1/2 cup, using whole wheat flour and replacing the oil with applesauce.

This is a great recipe, and so versatile. I did reduce the brown sugar to 1/2 cup as others suggested, and they were plenty sweet. I made them yesterday and between three of us they are already gone today. One tip I would give is to put a plastic sandwich baggie over your hand and spread a little butter on the outside of the bag, then pat the mixture into the pan. It's so much easier that way (I do this with Rice Krispie treats too). I can't wait to try some different varieties! :)

I have made these twice now and they are really good!  The first time I made them almost like the recipe but I added chopped pecans, sunflower seeds, and chopped apricots instead of raisins!  My study group really enjoyed them!  Today I made them with half apple sauce and half oil!  I want to make these with mini-chocolate chips so next time i'll try that!

This is pretty good. I replaced the oil with applesauce and accidentally put in a full cup instead of half so the texture is a little gummy...but I am going to have fun playing with this recipe until I get it just right for my family. And it was fun mixing it all up with my hands!

My husband is pickier about his food than most children and when I said I was making granola bars he said, "I'm not eating that."  The second they were out of the oven, he ate half of mine.  I didn't have wheat germ so I used almond flour which was very nice.  I used agave sweetner in place of the honey and I used all wheat flour.  I used craisins, white chocolate chips, walnuts, coconut, and 1 tsp almond extract with 1 tsp vanilla.  These taste like a cookie but I know they're healthier.

First, I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and cut the brown sugar to 1/4 and added apple sauce so they would not dry out as fast.  They turned out really cakey, not what I like in granola bars.  I like granola bars where you can taste the oats and the flour totally overpowered the oats.  I threw them out.  Just not a recipe that fits what my husband and I think of as granola bars.  I think I will take the advice of another reviewer and try the Gobble Up Granola Snacks from this site.

Wonderful recipe!  I made a few changes to suit my taste.  I upped the cinnamon to a heaping 1/2 T. since we love it so much.  Also omitted the oil and put in 1/2 C. of applesauce and also added 1/4 C. of peanut butter.  I also used quinoa flour and some vanilla flavored rice protein powder for added protein.  Since the protein powder was vanilla flavored, I omitted adding extra vanilla.  I also added 1/2 C. of ground flax seed and reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 C.  They taste like an oatmeal raisin cookie!  Yum!  I've also made these with pumpkin puree instead of applesauce and added pumpkin pie spice.  This recipe is so versatile, you can pretty much do anything with it.  Thanks for sharing!

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe! My favorite version so far is adding orange zest and dried cranberries instead of the raisins. I have been using it for 2 weeks and have made 4 different kinds and given the recipe to numerous other people, great recipe!

This great recipe has become a staple in our home.  I've made these a few dozen times so figured it was time to review the recipe. The recipe is so versatile and works well with the changes that I have made. The changes I made are just out of personal preferrence.  The first time I made the recipe just as is and it was great. I add 1/3 c ground flaxseed meal and 1/3 c wheat bran in place of the wheat germ.  I omit the salt.  I also reduce the amount of sugar to 1/3 c because I sometimes add applesauce in place of the oil. I increase the honey to 2/3 c. I also use unbleached white whole wheat flour. Today I added a 1/2 cup of peanut butter and chocolate chips.  My entire family loves these bars and I love that I can serve them healthy whole grains without unwanted corn syrup and preservatives. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Delicious!   My husband and toddler son love these.  I added 1 tsp of orange extract and used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.  Get your hands slightly wet before patting it into the pan.  This will help you get a smooth surface and will prevent the batter from sticking to your hands.

This is an awesome and very easy recipe. I substituted peach puree for the vegetable oil, carob chips for the raisins and 1 tbsp of milled flaxseed and 3 tablespoons of water for the egg to make it vegan. Everybody loved it! Oh, and a dash of cinnamon can't miss in any of my kids' fav dishes/ snacks.

These are great!!  I followed recipe exactly except used m&m's instead of raisins and they are so good! I really like that this recipe uses all standard ingredients that I always have around the house so I don't have to go to the store to buy ingredients for them!

I followed the recipe exactly, except I used only 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and I substituted the raisins for about 3/4 cup dried sweetened cranberries and 1/4 cup slivered almonds. I also baked them for about 25 min. The texture was more cookie-like than I expected, and they were also too sweet for me. (I'm used to the sweetness of bars like the Kashi trail mix flavor). Otherwise, the flavors in this recipe were very good. I will make these again, but will use maybe only 1/3 cup or even 1/4 cup of the brown sugar, and perhaps use chopped or whole almonds instead of slivered (for more crunch). I think I would also bake them for the recommended time of 30-35 minutes. I might even add some rice krispy cereal, like another member suggested, for more textural variety.

These are really good! My family and i love them, and spread with a little peanut butter, they really keep you going with protein, carbs, fiber and a bit of fat. I ran out of wheat germ so i just used an extra 1/4 cup of flour. I had substituted whole wheat flour. I also decreased both the honey, oil and the brown sugar to 1/3 of a cup because i don't like things too sweet, and i wanted to lower the calories.  They turned out declicious, though. The only thing was they're a bit crumbly, and a bit dense. That may have been from the adjustments i made, so i gave them 4 stars.

Hi, this is my first review, made these on Monday night & am so chuffed at how great they turned out! I read all the previous reviews & decided on half oil, half apple sauce, half the amount of sugar, wheatbran instead of wheatgerm. Added fruit, nuts, sunflower seed, peanut butter & choc chips. Husband has request more peanut butter & chips for next time. These are really filling I got 24 squares from the recipe. Thanks for the recipe & all the invaluable tips, great for a novice!

I love these granola bars! I've made them multiple times, but my favorite alteration of this recipe was using dried cherries and golden raisins instead of regular old purple raisins, and I also added about 1/4 cup of good quality cherry jam in the mix and only used about a 1/4 cup of honey and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Every one of my family and friends who tried them LOVED them-the health freaks and the sweet-tooths alike :]

Followed some of the reviews and these are GREAT. Mine only had to cook for 20 min and were just right. There are so many possibilities for these!

I made these hoping to save money over buying boxed granola bars....it started out as a great idea, until I realized they were so good they didn't even last long enough to store away!  Next time I'll definitely make a double or triple batch.

These were not as good as I had hoped, but maybe I did something wrong. I replaced the oil with 1c. applesauce. The bars were very soft, more like a cookie. Also, I'll leave out the wheat germ next time as it gave it a funky texture that no one cared for.

SO fabulous!!  Love the fact that I can add what my family likes and they still turn out perfect.  We prefer ours chewy, so bake time is much less.  So great!!  Try this recipe, you won't regret it.

Need a few changes since this is under the Healthy Cooking, you need whole wheat flour instead of white.  No oil, try applesauce instead.  If you want chewy bars, cut the baking time in half or at least for only 20 minutes.  One of my kids won't eat raisins.  Dried cherries are great, chopped of course.  And if you're still looking for chewy, throw in some coconut (which isn't healthy though)  While my daughter played high school basketball, I would throw in protein powder.

I thought these were just okay. I made as directed and thought they were kind of dry.  The taste is fine though, if you're not looking for chewy bars.  I like chewy granola bars much better, so I'll keep looking. I sent them to work with my husband and one of the comments was that they tasted 'healthy'. Now this may be a good thing, but I'm thinking that's not the best compliment I've ever received!

Very good recipe.  I made a few changes- added about 1/4 cup crunchy peanut butter, some toasted almonds, cranberries and dried blueberries.  I baked them for about 25 minutes, then scored the bars, put them back in for about 5 min then took them out and let them cool for 5 minutes and then finished cutting them.  They turned out great- I will definitely make again and will play around with different ingredients for slightly different flavors.

Fantastic!  Following the advice of others I cut sugar down to 1/2 cup, put in 1 full (rounded) teaspoon of cinnamon and used 1 and 1/4 cup of raisins (and will use more next time!).  I added 1/4 cup of milled flax seeds.  I used wheat flour instead of white.  Canola oil instead of vegetable. Baked for 25 mins and voila!  Like others have said, do watch this while in the oven.  I checked once at 20 mins and then at 25 mins.  As soon as it turns golden brown around edges, its done!  3 year old and hubby devoured these.  I am going to make another batch (only 24 hrs after making the first batch).

I love this recipe and after making it dozens of times now, I have been able to tweak it to make it a bit more healthy.  Here is what I change - I use whole wheat flour in place of all purpose (adds a little fiber).  Reduce brown sugar to 1/2 C.  Reduce the veg oil to 1/4 C.  Reduce honey to 1/4 C.  Add 1/4 C flax seed.  Add one large ripe banana, mashed.  Add 1/3 C applesauce (I use the all natural Motts, no sugar added).  I always omit the raisins because my son doesn't care for raisins, but I increase the cinnamon a bit (to taste) and add chopped dried apple.  Even without the dried apple, they are good.  Occasionally, I will omit the cinn. and apple, and add about 1/3 cup mini-chips (not quite as healthy, but delicious!).  I also bake them in a mini-muffin pan so they are pre-portioned.  Bake for 18 minutes. Makes 24.  I forgot to add that my 1 and 2 year olds LOVE these.  Before my daughter turned one I substituted pure maple syrup for the honey.  My two year old asks for them all day every day!  My husband eats them daily as well.  I make them at least once a week.

These powered my walking group through the last of a 17 mile walk.  I also reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, and added 1/2 cup applesauce.  I made one and a half batches and it made a nice, thick bar in a 13x9 pan.  My kids loved them too.  Feel free to add nuts, sunflower seeds, craisins, etc., they only get better.

The first time I made these I took the recommendation of another reviewer and left about two inches of the pan.  The problem was that these bars spreadout so there was a bit of the ends that burned and I had to throw it out.  The rest was amazing though a bit oily and the mix did not stick together well.  I left out about 1.5 TBS of oil next time and spread the mix over the pan evenly, not leaving the 2 inches of space.  I didn't really think that they turned out.  I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, but next time, I'll go with my original modifications and I'll probably make this often!  Great breakfast, love the wheat germ addition!

I have made these several times now due to the request of my children = HUGE hit with the kids and Hubby! They are so easy to make, healthy, under weight watchers plan 1 serving is 2pts and very easy to take on the go to soccer games! I added about 1/4 cup mini semi sweet chocolate chips and used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour.  You can add anything to this recipe!  This is a winner and I will be making this weekly!

These are fantastic bars!! I too, changed them up a bit. I cut the sugar down to 1/2 C, use whole wheat flour, did 1 full tsp of cinnamon, and instead of 1/2c of oil, I added 1 cup of apple sauce. I also added a raisin & cranberry mix along with some mini choco chips & some raw sliced almonds. HUGE hit. I do alot of running and use them as my fuel at the 1/2 way point of long runs. My almost 5 year old LOVES these.   For my hubby, who lacks the sweet tooth, I just added chopped dates and left out the choc chips. Another hit. The ingredients are a staple in our household now. Extremely east to make too.

I absolutely love this recipe. I substituted a couple of things. I used wheat flour instead of regular, flax seed instead of wheat germ and added walnuts, craisins and golden raisins. Thats what I love about this recipe, you can add so many different fruits and nuts that it comes out great everytime. I have already shared this recipe with many of my friends who loved it.  Thank You so much for sharing!

My husband requests that I have these on hand all of the time. I have made a few changes. I use quinoa flour instead. I use 3/4 cup of applesauce and 2 tablespoons of canola oil. I add 1/2 cup raisins, 1/2 cup dried blueberries, and 1/4 cup dried strawberries.  I also add 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts. They stay very moist. My husband likes to have them at work, and we take them on our bikes rides for a healthy snack.  The quinoa flour adds protein and the added fruit make them very nutritious. I have also made them with peanut butter, bananas, and chocolate chips for friends, but the fruit is my husbands favorite.

These are great! A very versatile recipe that comes out great every time. I like to use whole wheat flour and substitute applesauce for the oil. And I use less sugar and honey and add 2 packages of Quaker Simple Harvest Multigrain Cereal (oatmeal) in Maple, Brown Sugar and Pecan flavor for part of the 2 cups of oatmeal. It's delicious and adds another nutritional element which I very much appreciate as a mom!

GREAT base recipe! I added pumpkin, flax, sunflower and sesame seeds. Dried cranberries, almonds, chocolate chips and i omitted the raisins (not a fan). Great outcome! this is a fun recipe and great for little helpers.

Great recipe! I used chocolate chips and almonds instead of raisins (and omitted the cinnamon), which turned out yummy. Also, I found it easier to line the pan with parchment paper instead of greasing it; that way, when they are baked, it is easy to lift them out of the pan for cutting them. Next time, I'll probably add more oats for an 'oatier' texture. Oh, and I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, and they were plenty sweet!

I don't normally rate recipes I change but the base was good, I thought it had too much sugar & fat as written.  I used 1/4 c oil, 1 cup applesauce, 1 tbsp podwered ginger, upped the cinnamon to 1 tbsp, 1 cup pupmkin flax cereal (any cereal would work), and 1 cup apple granola, 1 cup currants, 1/2 cup raw organic sugar, 1 cup stone ground flour, 1/4 cup flax seeds, 2 cups oats, salt.  Also we are vegan so in place of the egg, I used 1 tbsp powdered flax seeds whisked with 3 tbsp water (whisk until mix gets thick), and in place of honey, I used 1/2 c lite pancake syrup.  I baked in 9x13 pan for 15 min and they came out perfect!!!  I can't wait to make different versions, a dessert one with peanut butter, pecans & chocolate chips is calling my name!!!!

This is honestly one of the best recipes i have gotten off of this website. they are to die for! i cannot keep them in my house though because i could eat them all in one sitting. i also used whole wheat flour and substituted the vegetable oil for applesauce to make it a tad bit healthier and my friends and family cannot get enough of them! i have shared the recipes with everyone i know because everyone loves them so much! THank yoU!!!

These granola bars are just plain good.  I did add 1/2 cup of apple sauce like others suggested.

I made these following a few others reviews. Here is what I did: 3 cups old fashioned oats, 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup of wheat germ, 1/4 cup flax seed, Cinnamon to taste, 1 cup wheat flour, 1 cup apple sauce, 1/2 cup peanut butter, 1/2 cup mini choc chips. I did everything the same except I omitted the honey and salt. These were awesome! Similiar to a protein bar. Good for after a work out. I am excited to mix it up and add other things to them.

I was disappointed with these, but since I did make some changes I'll still give them a 3. Based on the recommendation of other reviewers I reduced the amount of sugar (I do this in most baked goods) and added some apple sauce to make them more moist.  The consistency came out ok, but these were super bland.  If it weren't for the ton of raisins and crushed pecans I put in, these would have been practically tasteless.  I think this is partly due to the reduced sugar, so I would definitely recommend using the full amount.  But there was still something missing.  They were super easy to make though.  Don't know if I'll try them again.

Excellent recipe as a base recipe... and as is.  The only change I made was omitting the wheat germ because I didn't have any in.  I simply increased the amount of oats and flour by about 1/4 c. each.  My family gobbled these up in one afternoon... I will be making a double batch tomorrow.

These are not my favorite, but they are alright.  I did have to add more oats in place of the wheat germ, maybe that affected the outcome somewhat.  I also substituted half of the oil with applesauce, but usually I can do that without it affecting the taste, and sometimes it actually improves the taste.  Don't know that I will make these again, I have found many other granola type bars that I prefer over these.

A good basic bar.  I cut the sugar to 1/3 c - probably not sweet enough for kids but sweet enough for me.  I was expecting something chewier - these were almost cakey.

These are wonderful. It's a great base recipe that you can add any dried fruit or nuts too. I added chopped almonds, craisins, and coconut. YUM!!!!! My kid each ate 3 the night I made them. I also use whole wheat flour and less brown sugar. No one even knew.

I'm trying out many of the granola bar recipes here, and this was not the best.  They were way too sweet (and I love sweet).  My 2 year old likes them, but that is pretty much it.  Our family liked the "gobble up granola snacks" from this site much better.

SOOO good!  I followed other reviewers and cut the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and left a 1 inch space when spreading the dough out in the pan. (I used Reynolds release foil.)  After they cooled (cut them while warm) I put them in a zip lock bag and they are still chewy the next day.  Only problem is that I can't stop eating them!!

These were good and very chewy.  They are extremely sweet so I cut back on 1/2 of the brown sugar and used oats instead of the wheat germ. I will look for a recipe that has more oats and no flour.

This is a great base recipe.  I made one batch exactly as the recipe is and they were too crumbly, however after making these about 5 times, I started cutting the bars in the pan, but not taking them out of the pan until they are cool and I had no problems.  I have tried making these with peanut butter/flax seed (good), coconut/dried cranberries (great) - basically, throw anything in that sounds like it would be good in a granola bar, but you must compensate with more oil/honey otherwise they will fall apart.  I have a KA mixer and the way to tell if it needs more oil/honey is it should start sticking together in big chunks in the bowl.  
Also, other reviewers mentioned these get dry, but I put each bar into a sandwich bag for easy portability and haven't had that problem - they don't last long anyhow!

GREAT the first time with whole wheat flour, 1 tsp each of cinnamon and allspice, 1 cup raisins and slivered almonds pressed on top. The 2nd time I meant to add a 1/2 cup of applesauce in addition to the oil already there but I forgot to put the oil in so it was just the 1/2 cup applesauce!!! DO NOT RECOMMEND doing that....way too dry.

Don't let the name fool you....these are not only for little kids!  Made up a batch for a woman's meeting & they didn't make it out the door.  The bars where eaten all up by my teens and husband.  Like many of the reviewers already said...easily can add your own 'extra's'.

This was great!  I didn't have any wheat germ, so I subbed with crushed bran flakes and it worked out well.  I also added peanut butter (about half a cup) because we are PB hounds in this house.

My three year-old wasn't as crazy about eating these as she was making them, but I liked them - more so after they had cooled down.  Might cut back on the salt a bit next time, as I could taste too much of it, but other than that followed recipe exactly.  Also, next time I'll use a 9" x 9" pan, as that's basically the size I pressed the mixture into in the larger pan.  Edges burnt a bit at 30 minutes in the oven, but they make tasty granola!   Can't wait to try variations, like adding peanut butter and mini chocolate chips.

These are exactly what I was looking for!  I did make some changes to suit DH's preferences: I added about a 1/4 C peanut butter and 1 C chocolate chips; 1 C oats and 1 1/2 cup rice krispies; a few tbsp ground flax seed; used only 1/3 C brown sugar and it was still plenty sweet.  The only error with this recipe is the cooking time.  Mine were definitely brown after 18 minutes, even though I made them thicker (didn't spread all the way to the end of the pan).  I could have even pulled them out at 16 minutes.  So check on the granola bars way before the 30 minute cooking time.

These are really good. My kids just loved them. It will be fun to experiment with different add-ins - the possibilities are endless. Although I did not have wheat germ, they were great without it. My only problem was that I cut them when they were still warm, but I let them cool in the pan......big mistake. Even with a well greased pan, it was a chore to get them out. So, take them out of the pan before they cool! Other than that, it's a very good recipe.

I used the 9x13 pan, but didn't spread all the way as suggested.  I use Canola instead of vegtable oil, 1 Tablespoon of vanilla, I use whole wheat flour instead of AP.  I used wheat bran since I didn't have wheat germ.  Also the second time I made them I used an extra 1/2 C oatmeal, and just a touch more honey, we liked that better because they were not as sticky.  We've tried chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, raisens & dried pineapple, and butterscotch chips.  All have been good.

So good and so easy, my 4-yr old daughter loves to help me make these.  Each time we try different add-ins, she gets such a kick out of that!  Thanks for an excellent treat!

These smelled great from the moment they were baking till when they came out of the oven. I had used mashed bananas instead of the oil, and as much that created a good flavor, it made the bars a little tough. Next time I'll stick to either half oil and half fruit puree or all oil. I omitted raisins and added 2tsp almond extract. The almond + cinnamon+honey created a fantastic aroma. Interestingly, left overnight in a canister, the bars softened and tasted just like a cinnamon raisin bagel from outside. Will make these again!!!!

Fantastic!  I've made these many times by the recipe and then by being creative.  Another poster below is correct that reducing the amount of brown sugar to 1/2 doesn't make a difference in the sweetness, I also sub some of the white flour with whole wheat.  I've made these as granola bars, and as drop cookies with white chocolate chips

I made these for halftime snack for pop warner and I made 2 versions - first batch I made as written and the second I made with all applesauce instead of oil  and added 2 tbs of peanut butter and chocolate chips and I must say they both turned out great. No crumbly bars for me. all the boys loved them and the coaches did too !

These are really good.  I did add 1/2 cup peanut butter.  Next time I will omit the cinnamon as I am not a fan.  I also added pumkin seeds.  I thought the cooking time was excessive.  They tasted better the next day.

These turned out great. I used some suggestions from others. I substituted the 1/2 c of vegetable oil with 1/4c canola oil and 1/4c apple sauce. Instead of raisins, I used chocolate chips. I can't wait to experiment a bit more next time. The kids loved them. They are almost like a thick oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. Very satisfying!

WOW!  I don't think I will need to ever buy granola bars again!  I love these and so do my kids.  I didn't have any vegetable or canola oil in the house, so I used 1/2 cup of applesauce and 1/2 cup of pumpkin puree.  They are a little chewy, but we love them.  Also, I only baked them for 20-23 minutes.  They are great!  THanks

I didn't have wheatgerm so I used the same amount of steel oats.  Nice texture and taste.  My 11yo liked them so that makes them a five!  I would prefer a little sweeter but I decreased the raisins so that may be the reason they didn't satisfy my sweet tooth.

wow, these are excellent.  They remind me of a British flapjack (in taste, although not exactly in texture).  Other than using 1/2 whole wheat flour, I followed the recipe as stated.  I think I will use 1/2 cup sugar next time, just to make them a bit healthier.  I only baked them 20 minutes -- not 30 as in the recipe.  I think the key is not to overbake.  Once they cooled, the bars were a bit chewy.  perfect.  I also pressed the bars down in the pan firmly with the back of a spatula as mentioned in other reviews.  They held together nicely.  They held up well enough to pack up for my daughter's preschool class.  Now, if these can just pass the test of a bunch of three- and four-year-olds! :)  *update*  they were a hit!  All 14 kids ate their entire bar.  The teacher said the kids loved them, and she did too.  She asked me for the recipe.  hooray!

Good, but too cakey for my tastes and VERY crumbly. I think I will make the gobble up granola snacks from now on instead of these. Instead of 2 cups of rolled oats, I did 1 cup of rolled oats and 1 cup of rice krispies. I used craisins instead of raisins and added 1/2 cup of pecans, coconut, chocolate chips and added 1/4 cup of peanut butter and used the vegetable oil. I have used one banana and 1/4 cup peanut butter instead of the oil and they were still crumbly and too cakey. Good, but not the best.

I love these! They are so good and easy to make. I made 3 changes, I use 1/2 c. chocolate chips instead of raisins, used 1/2 c. brown sugar, and used ground flax seed instead of wheat germ. They are also good with whole wheat flour. I recommend removing the bars from the pan before they cool, or they are a bear to get out. My family now prefers these over store bought, and these are alot healthier! Thanks for a great recipe!

Reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup, used Canola oil, and used dried cranberries (Craisins) instead of raisins. These stayed fresh/soft for days. :) The kids loved 'em!

Great recipe.  I used dried Turkish apricots rather than raisins since that's what I had in the pantry.  Update:  The last time I made these I forgot to include the brown sugar and the result was still pretty good.  In the future, I think that I will add the brown sugar, but cut down on the amount called for in the recipe.

These were so easy to make.  I will play with the ingredients as well.  This time I added 1 tsp almond extract, dried cherries for raisns, and a couple of shakes of shredded coconut.  Very sweet, but yummy, worth the effort!

These tasted and felt more like those soft fruit-filled bars. I was expecting them to be crunchy. They were good, though.

This is an excellent base recipe.  Like everyone else has said, you can really make endless varieties of these bars.  I followed the advice from a few other reviewers and cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup. Next time I'll reduce it further to 1/4.  I used applesauce in place of oil, and I added a bit of nutmeg with the cinnamon.  I used craisins and chocolate chips.  They turned out fantastically, since and soft and chewy.

I was disappointed!  I was expecting something chewy but got something crumbly yet oily.  This is probably not the fault of the recipe, but rather the changes I made, such as reducing the amount of brown sugar and using ww pastry flour.  Maybe I baked them too long.  I will probably try again.

Used whole wheat flour, apple sauce instead of oil and corn syrup instead of honey.  I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and added craisins and mixed nuts.  The granola bars were tasty and chewy and will make for nice snacks on the family camping trip.

Love them!! Reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and instead of raisins I used about a cup of dried mixed tropical fruit I had that was starting to look a bit too dried out.  Next time I think I'll up the cinnamon to a full teaspoon.  I cut mine into 12 bars, not 24.  One of these is the perfect sized snack for me.  Not exactly low cal but I feel much better having one of these than a bag of chips and it keeps me full for quite awhile.  Thanks for the great recipe and to those who recommended it!

These were very good, but they are like a blonde square rather then a granola bar. But i will definatly make them again, the kids love them, a great alternative to store-bought cookies or granola bars.

Excellent and versatile recipe.  I typically substitute applesauce for the oil, and whole wheat flour for all-purpose flour.  One variation I like includes peanut butter and chocolate chips.  Another variation includes craisins, almonds, and almond flavoring instead of vanilla.

i adore this recipe--i bake these bars at least once a week, and it's always different (and always gobbled up!). sometimes i add cranberries and sunflower seeds (that's a favorite), or flax seed and blueberries. it's always turned out wonderfully. using the original recipe as a guideline, you can experiment to your heart's content!

I was looking for a cookie that could also be a quick breakfast. These are terrific. I followed the recipe exactly except I added only a fewe chocolate chips.  Turned out they didn't need the chocolate, they are good without it. thanks for a great bar cookie! I am about to make another batch to send to my daughter at school.

My first bar recipe that has come out SOFT!!!!!  I love it and have baked it 5 times in 2 weeks- really.  I add whatever stuff I have in cupboard- almonds, oat flour, mnms, choco chips.  This has been such a fabulous way to clear out my baking cabinet! 
Thank you for it! My husband eats them for breakfast on the way out the door, and my kids age 1 3 and 4 LOVE them. 
It has really helped cut down the "snack" budget.  I'm all smiles!

Great snack food.  After reading one of the reviews I added a mashed banana and cut down on the sugar.  Not sure if this was the right thing to do.  The idea sounded nice but it didn't translate.  My husband didn't care for them at all but my toddler and I like them enough and we'll eat up the batch. Will try making these again using the full amount of sugar without the banana.

I added craisins & walnuts, use just 1/3 cup of brown sugar (not packed), whole wheat flour, 1/3 c flax, & 1/3 c wheat germ.

These are wonderful!  My kids are granola bar junkies, but I hate always buying them from the store.  My son has nut allergies and I have been having trouble finding recipe for a chewy bar without nuts or peanut butter.  

I have made this recipe twice.  Following the advice of another reviewer, I kept them thicker and was careful not to bake them too long.  They are chewy and tasty and have been devoured by my kids.  I substituted milled flax seed for the wheat germ because it is what I had on hand and used whole wheat flour instead of white.  I like to sneak in as much whole grain as possible.  The kids didn't mind a bit.  I will continue to make these and perhaps experiment with some different add-ins such as craisons, or mini chocolate chips.  Yummy!

Not sure what it was but, something just didn't taste right about these. The honey? Maybe the wheat germ? Guess I'll just keep looking for the perfect granola bar recipe for me. Thanks for sharing!

These are really tasty. I substituted 1 cup of applesause in place of the vegetable oil (I would use less if you don't want them to be chewy!) I also used oat bran and almond meal (from Trader Joe's) in place of the wheat germ and I used wheat flour in place of the all-purpose as previously recommended in other posts. Also, I took the advice of other posts and used only 1/2 c. of brown sugar and they are plenty sweet enough. I made 2 batches today, one that had dried blueberries and a golden berry blend (Trader Joe's) in place of the raisins. I also added crushed walnuts to that batch. On the second batch, I mixed in dried blueberries in place of the raisins, and added pistachio nuts and sunflwer seeds. Both are very tasty and I plan to experiment more to the add-ins.

Really great! My two-year old gobbled these up! I'm sure the original recipe would work well, but I followed guidelines of the previous reviewers and used only 1/3 cup brown sugar and it was still plenty sweet. I also used only 1/4 cup canola oil and a whole one of those kid's cups of Mott's Peach Medley (didn't have regular applesauce). Also did 1/4 cup ground flaxseed and 1/4 cup wheat germ just to add more nutrition, and subbed 1/2 cup of the white flour for multi-grain flour.

Baked only for 25 minutes, as per another reviewer, until edges were just turning golden. Bars turned out really moist and chewy.

I am on Weight Watchers core for over a year now.. lost over 60 pounds and I am always looking for healthy snacks... this one is great! for the WW plan, I made a few changes as did some of the other reviewers.  I substituted all the flour with 1/2 blended fiber one and 1/2 whole wheat pancake mix (I had no whole wheat flour on hand)  I added 1/2 cup of flax seeds and 1/2 cup of  bran bites (they actually taste good even alone) I cut down the brown sugar by more than 1/2 but still used the honey. I substituted all natural peanut butter for the oil (this is the only real points in the recipe. I took the suggestion of others and only cooked it for about 20 minutes for a double recipe (which only filled one cookie sheet, I should have doubled it again)  So for any WW core people out there.. this is loaded with fiber even more now.. so to me that cancels out the small amount of Peanut butter and the honey.. right?? lol  Thanks again for this... ENJOY!!

I kinda mixed it with another granola bar recipe.  Here are the changes I made: added additional 2 cups of bran bud cereal, substituted oil with 3/4 cup peanut butter (heated/melted), substituted the honey w/ 1/3 cup corn syrup, substituted wheat germ for 1/2 cup flax seed, and added an additional egg to bind it together.  Instead of using simply raisins, I used a mix of dried fruit bits.  I baked for about 20-25 mins and it produced crunchy granola bars.  If you want something chewier, probably 15 mins will do it.  I can't imagine the baking time being 30+ mins - at 20 mins the edges were already tasting a bit burnt.  Really delicious nutty, spicy, slightly sweet flavor.  I think I'll always make my own granola bars now - I'm tired of the ultra sweet and gooey ones from the store!

i sub ground flax seed for wheat germ, used whole wheat flour, canola oil,only used 1/3 cup br sugar; added almonds, roasted sunflower seeds, roasted pumpkin seeds. LOVED them. the second time i made them, i mixed all the ingredients in the bowl, then put them in a food processor to make the bar finer and easier for my two year old to eat. he could not get enough! a great healthy and cheaper way to eat granola bars!

These are really great.  My whole family (including a picky 5 yr old) loved them. I used only whole wheat flour and I used Grapeseed oil to make them a bit healthier. I will be making these many more times.

This is a good recipe but like many people I halved the amount of sugar - I didn't miss it. I also used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and milled flax seeds instead of wheatgerm. The good thing about these bars is that when you're making them you just see they're full of goodness and they're the only thing that's managed to wean me off croissants in the morning! A good source of slow burning energy, and they make you feel you're making good food choices. Also good because you can play with the recipe, adding seeds or other dried fruit as a variation.

We loved these, I left out 1/4 cup of the brown sugar, they were plenty sweet. I used ground flax in place of wheat germ, whole wheat flour, and used a combo of dried blueberries, cherries and cranberries in place of raisins. The kids had them eaten in no time!

This is a great base recipe for granola bars, I do substitute apple sauce for the oil, making them moist.  With my son at a "nut free" school I always make my own snacks to send with him.  My kids like them made with 1/2 cup of raisins and 1/4 cup of mini chocolate chips.  I like to add 3/4 cup of dried apricot or dried blueberries.  This summer I will try adding trail mix, but I am sure it will work beautifully.

I made this for Vacation Bible School, and everyone raved including adults.  I did change it a bit by baking it for about 20 minutes allowing them to be a soft granola bar.  Delicious.

AWESOME!
Fourth granola recipe I have tried and will not be trying a fifth! (PHEW!)
It is easy enough for four year old participation as well which was great fun. 
Will double recipe next time in that it was inhaled within the hour. 
Thank you so much for sharing

I'm giving this 5 stars because my 4-year-old loved them. We followed the recipe exactly only we added dried blueberries to half of them (her FAVORITE half!) I wasn't totally crazy for them, but my daughter really was - And what I love is that the recipe doesn't call for any nuts. My daughter is not allergic, but with a 5-month-old in the house, I'm kinda paranoid about letting her eat nuts anywhere near him. They were also easy to make and my daughter really enjoyed helping with that almost as much as she enjoyed eating them!Great recipe - Thanks!

This is a good, easy recipe.  I used 1/2 wheat and 1/2 white flour as well as reducing the sugar to 1/2 c; they were still plenty sweet!  The batter was VERY sticky and I couldn't press it into the pan with my fingers so I used a square of wax paper wrapped around my hand and that worked perfectly.  They were soft when warm but hardened up as they cooled.  2 days later they are a nice, very firm texture.  Tastes like a cookie without all the fat and sugar!

Something tasted off and I didn't like the consistency.  They were also too hard for my two year old to eat, she just had to kind of suck on them until they fell apart.  Will not make again.

Really great snacks! I substituted maple syrup for the honey because I'm a little leary about giving anything with honey to my two-year-old, even if it's baked. I also didn't have any wheat germ, but I put in about half a cup of sunflower kernals and substituted half the flour with oat flour. Yummy! They tasted like oatmeal raisin cookies, which explains why my husband eats them. He doesn't eat anything remotely healthy! :)

Very tasty, but more like muffin/cookie bars than the typical chewy granola bar.  After a few days they did become a little more chewy.  I'll definitely them make again, but will probably change a few things to make them a bit more healthy.  Makes a large batch!

These are really good.  I added a little applesauce like another reviewer suggested, and they came out chewy, more like a cookie than a granola bar.  But the flavor was great.

Very yummy!  My husband ate them all, and he usually doesn't like anything I make (especially when they contain wheat germ!).  Good stuff!

These were good, but not great.  Something needs to be added/changed.  I'm just not sure what yet.  I think I'm going to try to add some applesauce like another reviewer suggested to see if that makes them moister.  Plus, I think some allspice and maybe even some chopped apple would be nice.
Definitely a good starting place though.

I wanted to 'use up' some vanilla flavored frosted mini wheat's cereal my kids just weren't eating...so started my thought to add it as an ingredient to a granola bar recipe! This was my first time making granola bars, and using this recipe as a base, my bars turned out delicious! I broke the mini wheats in 1/2 and I added a little more honey and milk so it wouldn't be too dry. I also added coconut and cinn. & choc. chips. I absolutely LOVE this recipe. Thank you for sending this in. I will make it 'normal' next time...think it will fantastic too!

My son's class held a healthy snack sale at school and these were a big hit. To make cutting easier, I fitted the pan with parchment paper, leaving extra on the sides. After baking, I let them cool for about ten minutes in the pan and then lifted the paper out and placed it on a large cutting board to cut. It worked perfectly!

I’ve been making this for a while now and it makes for a good part of breakfast.  I ALWAYS double the recipe, I find dark chocolate chips and sliced up prunes to be the best combo for my tastes but this recipe seems pretty open to alterations!

Love this recipe!  Easy to make and just the right flavors.  We prefer making them with dried cranberries but raisins are good also.  Plus the bars stay soft and chewy.

Terrific recipe.  I made them gluten free by whizzing up some oats in the blender to make oat flour.  Then instead of wheat germ, I used flax seed meal.  I made several variations.  I called one "Double Pumpkin" - it had 1/2 cup pumpkin puree and about 1/4 cup of pepitqs.  The maple version had maple syrup, maple extract and pecans.  The chocolate version had mini chocolate chips and cocoa powder.  Added raisins and craisins.  Next time I'll try adding chopped dried apricots and apricot marmelade.

Used only 2 Tablespoons of Brown Sugar (it enhanced the honey flavor), added 1 Tblspn melted butter.  I threw in 1/4 cup chipped White chocolate, sprinkled with chopped nuts.  Best snacks I've had in a long time. The recipe would be good the way it is, I'm just not a big sugar fan.

Made exactly as written the first time and they were really good.  So,  I decided to make some with mini chocolate chips and dried cranberries.  Next, sesame seeds and dried currents. Always turn out great. Thanks for posting this recipe!

These are not good and not healthy.  Too much sugar (3/4 cup + the honey)and fat(1/2 cup veg oil?) There are better granola bars on here thet are much healthier and taste better.

These were excellent. I tweeked it by using 1/2 cup of brown sugar, no wheat germ, 1/2 cup of finely chopped walnuts, and dried cherries instead of raisins (a full cup). Plenty sweet and delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

Made these for my kids for school lunches but I can’t stop eating them myself! The whole family loves them. I doubled the recipe and added 1.5 cups of semisweet chocolate chips. Last time I added shredded sweetener coconut and it was great. I didn’t have enough wheat germ so I substituted flax seed and it was perfect!!

Thank you for sharing. I made exactly as written, and it is quite delicious but my husband didnt really care for it. That being said, it is a great nut free snack and has excellent potential for additives as others have noted.

Great recipe as it is or to play with. Don’t use almond flour or else it won’t set and will be too runny. To pay it in the pan, rub a little coconut oil on your hands so it won’t stick.

I love how adaptable this recipe is. Craving a bit of white chocolate with goji berries and almonds? Mix it in! Craving peanut butter with pumpkin seeds? Mix it in!

I made it as posted with only one change; I used dried cranberries instead of the raisins. I also silly me) forgot to add the vanilla. 
My kids still tore them up. I used an 8 inch square cake pan and they ended up being about an inch thick. They were soft and chewy, just how I enjoy them. (30 minutes in a 350 oven) Cut them 5 minutes after taking them out. Once cooled, (about 15 minutes later) I used "Saran Wrap" and wrapped them individually then placed them all into a zip lock bag. They stayed soft and chewy and they ended up not lasting through that night. They were gone by this morning. 
I plan on trying them with the vanilla (ugh I still can't believe I forgot it)  and some applesauce and less brown sugar and oil this next time. I'm not willing to reduce the wheat germ since that is the main reason for making this recipe in the first place. 
This recipe is easy to make. I would highly suggest anyone try it then go from there to make it their own. 
Thank you for posting this recipe. Now I have another great, filling treat to show my daughters how to make so they can fend for themselves one day.

This is a GREAT base recipe that you can really tweak to your liking.  Most weeks, I make a double batch of these for a quick, on-the-go breakfast throughout the week.  I didn't like how they cut (crumbly) so I bought a couple of bar pans and they work perfectly. 
For your first time making this (or any recipe!) I recommend trying it exactly per the recipe, then make changes.
We like to get creative with the add-ins and do add 1/2 c applesauce and 1/3 cup flaxseed to all.   The only add in our family really didn't like was peanut butter.  I always set the timer for 20 minutes then check every few minutes until done.  The add-ins can really change the cook times.  I also wrap these individually and they keep very well all week. 
Apple bars:  add 2 finely grated apples, 2 additional tsp cinnamon, 1/2 c chopped pecans or walnuts.  
Cherry bars:  add 3/4 cup chopped dried cherries, 1/2 tsp almond extract, 1/3 c slivered almonds, 1/2 c shredded coconut.
Blueberry bars:  3/4 cup dried blueberries, 1/3 cup slivered almonds, 1/2 c shredded coconut.

The taste is great and I would make this again but maybe with less sugar. I wasn't thinking about the honey being a bonding agent and after adding the sugar thought the mix tasted plenty sweet for me so I didn't add any honey. This made it so my granola crumbled into musli. That's ok though its still good I'll probably just eat it with yogurt or as cereal

I was looking for a granola bar to take the place of purchased ones. At least I know what ingredients are in them, but they are not at all like the picture that is posted. They were only about 1/2" thick and not worth the calories for the size. I will keep looking.

I just finished making this.  I am not a baker - but I have made a few things here and there and learned a few tips from the awesome people who do make suggestions. So here are mine, 1st off, we don't do raisins. So I used chocolate chips instead. 
Also, instead of greasing the pan I just used parchment - worked like a charm and no mess. Someone also recommended to keep the mixture approx and inch from the edges of the pan, I did the same. 
I also changed the brown sugar to a 1/2 cup as someone else suggested, and added 1/2 cup applesauce to the liquid mixture to ensure they stay soft.
I cut them while warm.  Now I am hoping they stay soft for tomorrow when I will be serving them.

Update  - they did stay fairly soft yet intact. I stored them in a tupperware overnight and they were perfect and gobbled up by my daughter's volleyball team in no time!  
Making a double batch for this next tournament!

Really a great recipe. I used what I had on hand, so craisins instead of raisins and ground flaxseed instead of wheat germ. Also added a handful of leftover chopped pecans. It was thick enough to shape into a freeform rectangle on a cookie sheet with parchment. Baked it for about the recommended time and let cool a few minutes before cutting into bars with a pizza cutter. The outside bars are crunchier and the inside bars are chewier. Love it!

I switch the wheat germ for flax seed to cut out the gluten and use a rice flour instead if a wheat flour. I've made it with almond butter (my personal favorite), chocolate chip and peanut butter.  My kids just don't do dried fruits, so those were not an option. I have let my kids explore cooking using their ideas based off this recipe. Those are moments made together. That, if for no other reason, is why this recipe is always used at my house.

Great recipe. I have been making this for quite some time. I usually triple the recipe. I often use 1/2 almond flour and half regular flour, I usually use 2/3 of the amount of sugar/honey/maple syrup. I often will add dried cranberries and walnuts. My whole family enjoys these. They keep very well in a sealed container or ziplock bag. Thanks!

This is one of my favorite snacks when I have a sweet tooth.  I made it for my family and the love it too.  Some of their co-workers asked for the recipe after they tried it.  We didn't use wheat germ because we didn't have any.

As some suggested, reduce sugar to 1/2 cup and used agave  and honey because my kids don’t like honey. Also used coconut oil. I did use a gluten free flour too.  Added a full cup of raisins. These are delicious and very sweet- the kids liked that! Too sweet for me though. Mine were very crumbly but it could have been from the gluten free flour. I froze a bunch of these.

Made exactly according to the recipe, these are soft and chewy and EXTREMELY sweet. They're basically oatmeal cookie bars. They are a good dessert, and the recipe is probably pretty forgiving in terms of adding ingredients and stuff. However, they're not by any means a healthy snack if that's what you're hunting for... definitely a very  sweet treat!

I'm on a quest for snack bars I can eat daily that will perk me up and reduce my snackiness in the afternoon. This recipe was one stop on that quest. 

My only substitution in these bars was to use wheat bran instead of wheat germ and I didn't use raisins. 

I like the flavor of these bars and they were easy to make. I struggled to get the mixture to spread evenly over the entire 9x13 pan and worried it would come out too thin. The bars did come out thinner than your typical granola bars, however I didn't mind. They also came out dry and a bit crispy, possibly overdone although I followed the baking instructions. I personally enjoyed the crispiness, but my husband thought they could be softer. I found them too sugary for a daily snack. I'll be noting whether or not they fit my needs otherwise in the afternoon (i.e. keep me full and reduce my cravings).

Next time I will be using a different pan, probably a 9x9, and I'll cut back on the sugar and see how it goes. I'll probably end up doing a lot of what the top comment suggests too.

This was tasty and not too sweet, because I decreased the brown sugar to 1/2 cup like other reviewers suggested. I also subbed in the applesauce as suggested, but I have to admit I wasn't a fan of the "floury" aspect of the granola bars -- It seemed almost cakey to me. I may try another recipe on this site that has little or no flour included in the recipe.

Great healthy snack.  Added 1/2 cup PB2, some slivered almonds, and I was a little short on oats, so added more wheat germ and some ground flax. Used applesauce in place of 80% of the oil.  These were a little dry due to the added dry ingredients, but they taste great.  Kind of grow on you as you chew.

This is a great recipe that I’ve been making for years. I change the mixing because of the varied tastes of my family. It’s tasty, easy and versatile. Just don’t over bake.

I enjoyed this as a recipe base.  I did make many alterations based on reviews, but have no doubt that it would be great just as written.  I plan to try several different variations.  Today's first batch was:
whole wheat vs white
reduced brown sugar to 1/2 c
total of 1-1/4c oil, chunky applesauce, and honey (equal parts)
Old fashioned oats
1/4 c hemp seeds for protein
1/4 c ground flax instead of wheat germ (love WG, but was out at the moment)
craisins vs raisins
added slivered almonds

The chunky applesauce was a really nice addition.
Also, I baked it in a 7x11 glass pan and the height of the bar is perfect.  Baked for about 25-30 minutes to let it cool.  They are chewy and not hard.

I like the suggestion of pumpkin; or a more nutty blend with walnuts, sunflower seeds, raisins, etc; peanut butter; etc.  Could also make these in cookie form instead of a bar if that is easier.  Would need to flatten them to the desired shape, or bake in a muffin tin.

These bars were delicious! I added quite a few additions though... pecans, raisins, flaxseed and sliced almonds. All stuff I had kicking around so I thought I'd add it in. Came out wonderful!

Easy to make and easy to suit to your own tastes. I like to make these when we are overseas because ingredients are sometimes limited, as are baking ovens and pans, but these work every time!

Just made these for the first time and they are yummy, but VERY sweet. I will be trying them again and cutting down on the brown sugar and honey. Otherwise they are delish.

Great recipe. Did change a few things. Only put in 1/4 c of brown sugar was plenty sweet for me and my kids. Used flax And maple syrup instead of wheat germ and honey because that's what I had. Put in choc chips and pecan pieces once again because I had that. Turned out great kids ate them all before I could get them in their lunches. Also cooked for less time. 15 min on my oven was good. Making another batch now with coconut. I think this is a great recipe to play with...may even do less sugar next time.

Amazing, added 1/2 C. Brown sugar instead of the 3/4C. And omitted the cinnamon and raisins for some mini chocolate chips. I can't believe I'm going to say this but 6oz of mini chips might have been a bit to much...

Excellent!  I made two batches with different ingredients (one with candied ginger, chocolate nibs, sunflower seeds and orange oil.  The other with trail mix and pumpkin seeds).  I substituted these ingredients for the raisins.

Other substitutions:  used 2/3 spelt flour 1/3 buckwheat flour ratio to replace the white flour.  Used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.  Added additional spices to go with the flavours (ground ginger for the first; mix of allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg for second).  Instead of the wheat germ used flaked cereal.  Instead of brown sugar used coconut sugar and then added 1/2 teaspoon of molasses to the wet ingredients.  I don't know what the original version is supposed to taste like, but these were excellent, with the changing of the flour not having a bad effect on the texture of the bars.

Im giving it a four, only because I made it with dried cherries instead of raisins and they're AWESOME, and I can't imagine the original recipe being as good as these. I also threw in a little handful of slivered almonds. Definitely going to make these again-- like others have said, this makes a great base recipe to then play with and modify :)

The changes I made were: used parchment paper instead of greasing the pan (always works like a charm on things like this!), and only used about 3/4 of the 1/2 cup honey the recipe calls for (it was all the honey I had on hand). Even with decreased honey, I felt it was a little on the sweet side, I will cut it back further next time. I did do the optional raisins, which did add some sweetness. I would make this again, with 1/2 cup brown sugar (instead of 3/4) and maybe 1/3 cup honey. And maybe some chocolate chips, because life is better with chocolate chips!

Love it, you can easily change up the ingredients. I sub the brown sugar for sucanant, the veg oil for coconut oil or butter and all purpose flour for whole wheat. It's a very versitale recipe! I add shredded coconut, nuts, chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, chia seeds, dates! Any variation!  We love it!

I will definitely make these again. I made the suggested change of only using 1/3 cup sugar, reducing cook time to 18 minutes, and leaving one inch of space between the edge of the pan and the sides.  I didn't have wheat  germ so I didn't use it.  In addition to that, I added 2 tablespoons peanut butter, half a cup mini chocolate chips, and a banana  because I have them on hand and they sounded good together in a granola bar.  These Elvis style granola bars turned out awesome.

I didn't use the wheat germ or the raisins because I don't have them and the recipe still turned out great.  It was easy and they taste excellent.
I now double the recipe but only put in half the honey. They taste great!

These were both easy to make and tasty.  As is always my tradition, I make a recipe for the first time exactly how it is written and then make variations after that.  My first batch was good, but the bars were a little on the bland side.  I more than doubled the cinnamon in the 2nd batch, which really turned the color of the batter, but also gave it the punch I think it needed.  Will definitely make again.

This is a great recipe. I now make these every week. I changed to suit my family's taste. No raisins, add unsweetened dried coconut, chopped pecans and a few chocolate chips. I sub flaxmeal for the wheat germ since I have that on hand. I use coconut oil instead of vegetable.  I also used old fashioned, not quick oats. I've make several variations and they have all been great. I usually up the quantity of some of the ingredients and have found that an extra egg and some water  help make the mixture wet enough that it holds together better. Thank you for  a great alternative to boxed granola bars.

My kids can't get enough. Every time I make them they disappear with a quickness. All the parents ask me how to make them. I cut out some of the brown sugar and use applesauce. I like them chewy and soft but hubby likes them crunchy. I leave his batch in longer and everyone is happy.

I skip the wheat germ and use flour instead.  I also make this with GF Oats for my husband.   I use 1/4 of honey and 1/2 of brown sugar.  It is still plenty sweet for my family.

I have made these twice already and they were a huge hit both times!  (Once with golden raisins, once with regular) Thank you for a great recipe and alternative to store bought granola bars.  Glad to know exactly which ingredients my kids are eating!

Thanks again!

My daughter and I make a batch of these every week. This is a great base recipe to add your own spin to, we have fun thinking up what flavor of granola bars we would like to try for the week. So far we've made cranberry pecan, apple pie spiced (with chunks of dried apple), chocolate chip, chocolate with peanut butter chips, and caramel walnut. This week we will try peanut butter with apple chunks. Good recipe, if we want chewy granola bars we decrease the baking time, for crunchy bars we bake for the full amount of time.

Great recipe! I used less wheat germ so the bars wouldn't be so grainy. We used butter instead of oil and we added cranberries and chocolate chips for our own touch - they are delicious!

I have made this sooooo  many times. I substitute some of the flour for whey isolate protein powder. I've added nuts, flax seeds, dried fruit .. and the recipe itself is very flexible. This has turned into a staple item during travel volleyball season.. going strong since 2008 and everyone loves these.

Really liked it.  Everyone I shared with also enjoyed. I can see changing the raisins to maybe craisins or other fruit but great as is.

Wonderfully easy granola bar.  Easy to sub ingredients I had on hand...like mixed seeds for the wheat germ, choc chips for the raisins, and coconut oil for the vegetable oil.  
I did line the bottom of the pan with baking paper.  Definitely cut the bars while warm.  It made cutting and removing from the pan so easy.
My son loved the taste...so did I!I will absolutely make them often.

I make these for my husband (my favorite granola bar recipe uses peanut butter, and he's not a fan). Similar to other commenters I substituted whole wheat flour and reduced the amount of brown sugar. I don't have wheat germ so I substituted with half wheat bran and half ground flax seed. I've also added 1 cup of pumpkin seeds (we have a crazy amount of them), 1/2 c chopped walnuts and use craisins instead of raisins. My husband prefers crunchy bars, and I'm trying to figure out how to get the right crispiness.

Delicious & my family loved them! 2nd time I made them I doubled the recipe because the 1st time the bars were gone in 2 days! I added dried cranberries & blueberries. Based upon another review, I cut back the brown sugar a bit and did not fill the measuring cup. Perfectly sweet! Highly recommend!

These are very good and satisfying.  Very easy and mine were very moist. Be sure to check at 25 minutes and take out as soon as the edges begin to brown.   I substituted cranberries for the raisins.

I loved this recipe! I was looking for a healthy snack for my kids' lunches and this is perfect. I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, used extra light olive oil instead of veggie oil, and used a 1/2 cup of coconut sugar instead of brown sugar. I opted for dark chocolate chips instead of raisins. They were so yummy! I will definitely make again and try with raisins!

GRANOLA BARS SCARE ME.....!!!!  I love them but they are so hard to get right!!!!  I followed the directions of one reviewer to only cook for 18 minutes but mine still crumbled to a mess!!!!  I will try again and cook a little longer... I think this will help... maybe?

Really good! Made for kids' school snacks. Used all whole wheat pastry flour, 1/3 c oil and 1/3-1/2 c applesauce. Reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 c and were still plenty sweet. Added raisins, dried cherries and craisins. Cooked 30 min, could have gone a few more min to get really crisp. The edges were crisp and middle softer. By the next day, they were a little more soft, but still very good. Will  be trying this with other add-ins like mini chocolate chips, etc.

While not being the healthiest granola recipe this is a good one! Just be careful with your cooking times and you'll have chewy bars for ages, I only bake them for 15-20 mins at gas mark 4 otherwise they burn and become dry.  I make mine with linseed mix (flax) instead of wheatgerm and swap raisins for dried cranberries or whatever else I have to hand.  I've found the secret to making these my own by adding dried coconut, it gives the bars more texture.  If I'm being unhealthy I'll also add 50g of chocolate chips too!

Delicious. I use only 1/3 cup brown sugar and they are plenty sweet. Also reduce salt to 1/4 tsp. I use ground flax instead of wheat germ. You can double it and use a 17.25 x 11.5 jelly roll pan. They're more of a "honey oat bar" than a granola bar, which is fine by me.

Great recipe.  I didn't have vegetable oil, so subbed melted coconut oil which worked wonderfully.  I found them too sweet the first time and decreased brown sugar to 1/4 cup and they were still good.  Instead of greasing the pan, I used parchment paper.

Great recipe!  My son allergies to nuts.  He can't eat granola bars from the store due to trace nuts facilities....He  loves this so much that told me to make more and he wants to share with his friends.  I have some changes, added 1/2 cup of coconut flakes and 1/2 cup mini prezels (crumble them).  since I added more dry ingredients, I added 1 Tablespoon more  canola oil.  I will make it again soon.....

My family loved these just the way the recipe is. One important note is don't forget the parchment in the pan! The second time I made them I added nuts also. This recipe is very flexible and could be changed to add pretty much anything you have in the cupboard.

We love this! When I had to go gluten free I was super sad to lose this recipe. However I just tried a substitution that worked great! Gluten free oats, white rice flour, ground flaxseed for the wheat germ, & a sprinkle of xantham gum. So happy to have it back!

My family (hubby n teen son) loved these! I followed another user's recommendation and cut my sugar to 1/2 c. I also used flax seed & peanut butter. I only baked mine for 18 mins. They were chewy yet firm. This will be made weekly now!

As others, I tweaked it a little but only because I wanted to use up some nuts, seeds & peanut butter I had taking up space in the cabinet. It's a winner! I will definitely keep this recipe in my repertoire.

I never make these same way twice but they are always a hit. I double the recipe and bake on a cookie sheet. I use whole wheat flour and cut the brown sugar by more than half. I didn't have wheat germ this time so I added chia seeds and some unflavored protein powder. I also opt out of using vegetable oil for a healthier choice. These freeze great and will thaw out if put in a lunchbox in the morning.

These are delicious as written, and they lasted a little more than a week for me when I sealed them in ziplock bags.

I added 1/2 cup apple sauce, as another user recommended. the bars tasted really good but were SUPER sweet! they tasted like a dessert. you could probably cut out most or even all of the brown sugar and just use honey as your sweetener. tasted really good though :)

I made it the way the recipe stated and also added chopped peanuts in one batch.  The other batch I added mini chocolate chips.  Both were a hit!

Yum. 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/4 c. honey.  Use 1/4 c. applesauce and 1/4 c. oil.  Made half with choc chips and the other half with dried currants.  Kids don't like the oats.  Tiny helped make them.  Left 1 1/2 inches to the end of the pan, and decreased the cooking time to about 23 minutes.  Stayed chewy in the ziplock.  137 cal, 3 g fat, 4 g protein, 11 g sugar,.

Very good recipe! I did add about 1/4 cup of mini chocolate chips and about 2T of Chia seeds, I also replace raisins for dried cranberries. Mine were perfect @ 24 mins, individually wrapped they're still soft the next day. I would say this is more like a cookie than a granola bar. Still very good and a reasonable snack for kids and adults.

Delicious! tastes good with wheat flour. I had a hard time figuring out how to get it out of the pan without crumbling.  I put foil under it and baked it like that then cut it right when it came out of the pan. I waited until it cooled to get it off of the foil, but some of it still crumbled.

I once forgot to put in the egg, so the granola turns out hard and tastes exactly like Nature's Valley granola bars - sickeningly sweet, too. The next batch, I forgot to add the flour, and it turned out to be really soft and fell apart. The third time was Just Right. It's so sweet, I recommend omitting half the brown sugar.

I love this recipe and in fact have made this twice this week.  The only thing I'll note is that I suggest you watch the baking time.  My oven tends to run cooler than it says and using the recommended time the bars were a little too brown. BUT that's easy to fix.  I think this is a marvelously versatile recipe.  The second time I made it with chocolate chips.  I plan to make it again next week (which will be the third time in two weeks) with marshmallow fluff.  Sort of a rice crispy-playground bar hybrid.  Experimenting is fun.  You'll want to try cranberries and more because this is just a great useful recipe.  I glad they shared it.  [ps--I used extra extra virgin olive oil. Because it's healthy :]

These were super super sweet. I think if I made them again, I would use half the sweetners, probably just the honey and not the brown sugar.

Came out great, even with slight changes (reduced sugar, extra dried fruit, etc.).  I will definitely be making these again, and if I do say they are awesome with dried apricot!
Made again today, tried adding about 1/4 cup of applesauce to see how that changes it.  Used about 1/2 wheat and 1/2 white flour, and only 1/3 cup brown sugar, which seems like enough.  I made two kinds, and I put about 1 cup of dried fruit/nuts/chocolate in each one.  I definitely recommend lightly greasing the aluminum foil, and now I'm going to try storing them at room temperature since someone said that is better than putting them in the fridge.

This is an awesome granola bar recipe.  It's easy for my toddler to help me dump the stuff in the bowl, and they are supper tummy and can be easily altered to what you have on hand.  I personally use melted butter instead of oil, because that's what I had the first time and like it in comparison.  I always go light on oatmeal and flour because I add chia seeds and an extra "fun" ingredient.  Always the raisins though.  My favorite combo so far was adding white chocolate chips and well crumbled graham crackers instead of flour.  I also ran out of honey, so I added some more brown sugar and whole milk at the end, just enough to get ingredients a little wet.  I also found baking this at 330 helps not burn anything.  Don't overlook it either, that helps them stay chewier.  I also think cutting them in squares as opposed to bars helps cut down on crumbles.  As directions say...watched until the just turn brown on edges, take it out.  Wait 5-7 minutes.  I then turn them over on a cutting board after releasing the edges with a knife.  I pat the bars so they are sticking together, then I wait five more minutes and then cut it with super sharp knife in squares.  You can obviously cut it however you want, I just found this way has less crumbs.  Parchment paper would also be a really good idea.

This is one of my favorite recipes.  It is extremely versatile--today, I mixed in dried cranberries, walnuts, sunflower seeds, and mini chocolate chips.  Once you have made the recipe a couple of times and know what the texture is supposed to feel like before you bake it, you can start playing with the wet ingredients too.  I usually do an egg, some applesauce, plain yogurt, and a little bit of vegetable oil (not the full 1/2c, because you won't need it). Today I substituted coconut oil, but the bars are still baking so I can't say how that will taste.  I also either omit or greatly reduce the brown sugar, since I include chocolate chips and dried fruit for sweetness. Mine usually cook in less than 20 minutes, since I like chewy bars.  Recipe is delicious as written and it's really hard to mess up.

These bars are amazing!! The only change I made was to use wheat flour. Sometimes I make them with raisins and a little extra cinnamon, and other times with chocolate chips. My family loves both! The key is to use a pan that is smaller than 9x13; I use an 8 1/2x11 and it is perfect. They stay moist and chewy the entire week. I cut them into squares and we eat them like cookies. Thanks for the great recipe!

Loved this recipe. The oats were easier to mix than I thought when first reading this.  I am a bit confused as far as the "dry" comments I am seeing.  I individually wrap each square and they stay chewy for at least 3 days after the day of baking.  I also bought blueberry and cherry craisins for a mixed berry taste.

This was a very good recipe, but the 30 minute baking time was way too long in my oven. The middle bars came out okay but the bars on the edges were very  hard. I will make again and adjust the baking time accordingly. Thanks for sharing!

I have never reviewed anything before.  I have been making this recipe around every other week for a year.  I LOVE IT!  The only change I made was I cut the raisins in half & added some semi-sweet chocolate chips for the missing half.  I bake them for 25 minutes.  After they cool, I cut these in squares (24 in a 13 x 9 glass pan), and I individually wrap them in plastic wrap.  They last beautifully this way for a few weeks. Thank you for this great recipe!

I've made these twice in 2 weeks and they've been a huge hit. The first time I used raisins and the second time I used dried mixed berries. I used whole wheat flour like suggested, cut the sugar to 1/2 cup, and used a full cup of fruit. I stored them in a tupperware container and they were still chewy after a week. I plan on keeping this recipe on hand for frequent use, trying different additions. I want to try peanut butter and chocolate chips next time. A great recipe!

I have made this recipe three times. The only thing i changed was the amount of brown sugar. I reduced to about 1/4 cup. I made with "real" local honey. I think that makes a difference. I havent had a granola bar that rivaled this..Excellent..

Very easy recipe to use and to substitute ingredients with.  My 13 year old makes these all the time for school lunches.

I LOVE this recipe! These bars stayed chewy for days in an airtight container. It was a little too sweet for my taste, so I cut back on sugar the second time. I also love that you can easily add nuts, chocolate chips, change up the dried fruit, etc. YUM!!!

We love these and love that they can be varied by the goodies you add in.  We have made these every week for the past 3-4 weeks.  They don't only taste great but keep you full for hours.  We only bake for 18-20 min.  Our variety includes alternating or combining the following dates or craisins, almonds or sunflower or pecans or walnuts, choc chips, sesame seeds, coconut flakes.  Seriously sky is the limit.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I've made these several times and love them! The recipe calls for wheat germ which I never have, so I substitute sesame seeds, flax seeds, and a little extra oats.  I also sub out some of the regular flour for whole wheat flour.  I use craisins instead of raisins, and of course, add chocolate chips as everything goes over better in my house with chocolate chips!

I love this recipe and have made it several times in the past few weeks.  I must say exactly what another reviewer said...  Only bake them 18 minutes.  They come out perfect every time and stay soft and chewy!  I've made them with chopped up dried dates and the plumaisins (dried plum pieces).  I plan on making a lot of varieties of this recipe in the future!!

This has become my go-to granola bar recipe. My 6 year old and my husband both love them. They are fast and easy to put together. I did reduce the brown sugar to 1/3 cup and used 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour in place of the wheat germ and white flour. These pack well, too.

I use this recipe all the time! It saves us so much money on snacks for the 3 kids.  I have a child with gluten issues, so I switched the flour to almond flour, I use gluten free rolled oats, and I have also used peanut butter (the natural, oily kind) in place of the veggie oil. It all comes out great! I cook it for 10 minutes less.  This is a go to snack for our family!

Love the recipe. I've substituted tapioca flour for the egg. Makes the consistency a little firmer but still excellent.

Delicious. In my oven the edges started browning after cooking about 25 minutes. The texture is perfect, kids and husband love them. I love the raisins, my kids like them better when I use choc chips instead.

(too healthy!) but it is very good and my 2 year old liked it! 

I only replaced the wheat germ with milled flaxseed as that was all that I had.

Great recipe but I would line my pan with parchment then remove while warm and cut just to make it a little bit easier (and no washing the pan! ) tried it with chocolate chips also and it was fantastic.

Didn't use raisins, but put in 1/2 cup peanut butter instead. I also used 1/2 cup whole wheat and 1/2 cup regular flour. So, so yummy! I don't ever want to go back to store bought!

Followed recipe exactly, just doubled it.  It was so good.  A little too sweet for my taste, so I am going to reduce the brown sugar next time.  I over cooked it, so next time will check it at 20 min. to see if the edges are starting to get golden brown.  It didn't look like I over cooked it, but after bars cooked down, they were too hard on the edges.  Thanks for this great recipe that can easily be modified with different flavors. :-)

I subbed wheat bran for germ because, it's what I had, banana for egg (1/4c) and threw in a handful of(enjoy life) chocolate chips....Also, used whole wheat flour because why not, right? I sneak it any sweet recipe and no one knows the difference. Yummmmmmy!! They came out of the oven after dinner and we couldn't help but start eating them!! DEFINITELY will make variations of this versatile recipes, thanks!

The only change I'd make to this is I like my granola bars more chewy. I recommend cooking them for 18 minutes instead to keep them chewy. 20 minutes for me (living in Utah) was almost too long for me.
Besides that, I really like being able to make homemade granola bars. These are wonderfully tasty. I don't have wheat germ on hand, so I haven't been using it. But I've been putting a variety of chopped up dried fruit, nuts and raw pumpkin seed (I highly recommend them).

I am giving 5 stars because I SPEND SO MUCH MONEY at the grocery store every week on granola bars for breakfast, and this is such a great base to what I normally buy! I didn't add any fruits, and I definitely will, next time.

These are easy to make and good!  I followed the recipe except I used whole wheat flour and added a large handful of chocolate chips bc I have lots leftover from unfinished Christmas baking.  good flavor with a slight chew to them.  really looking forward to making them again with various other dried fruit and/or nut combinations.

This was delicious.  I never really follow a recipe... always adding and morphing. I didn't have wheat germ so I used milled flax seed.  Used 1/4c golden raisins, 1/4c dried cherries, and 1/4c dates.  Added pecans and walnuts.  Came out of the oven and is cooling.  Delicious.

Will definitely make again and again.  My toddler loves it.

**Hint from another review that helped: put a piece of wax paper on top of the mixture in your 9x13 pan.  Makes pressing it down so much easier.**

I love granola bars and this is one of the best recipes.  I always add some chopped walnuts.  Also good if you add coconut, and then I do not add the cinnamon. I have made these several times.

I made these with what I had in the pantry - Choco chips, dates, cranberries, sunflower seeds. They were great and not too dry. I will make these again with apricots, raisins and white choco chips.

This is a great recipe - thank you for sharing!  I made only a few substitutions. I subbed peanuts for the raisins, and I didn't have wheat germ so I subbed some steel cut oats for the germ.  I always increase my cinnamon because we love lots of cinnamon. These are a winner!! It is nice to make something to replace the store bought bars that are so expensive and full of preservatives.

We cut the sugar to 1/3 cup and used wheat bran instead of wheat germ.  We also sprinkled chocolate chips on top.  These were really, really good. I think next time we could cut the sugar or honey even more and they would still be really good (and healthier!).

Very good base. I added chocolate chips and coconut flakes, and I also substituted half the honey for applesauce and they were a nice moist consistency. My kids love them!

I followed the recipe precisely..the only thing I didnt have was wheat germs and I just used another 1/2 cup of rolled oats instead. 
They turned out great. I loved them! My kids did not..unfortunately...but maybe just  because it doesnt look all that tasty (for them anyway)

Made it with cranberries and chocolate chips instead of raisins. It tasted like an oatmeal cookie bar. It's good but I'm not sure if I'll make it again.

wow!!! great recipe!!! i loved that it didn't fall apart when i cut in into bars!! (previous granola recipes were too crumbly!!) i have to admit i really changed this recipe adding hemp seed, chia seeds, ground flax for the wheat germ. i also reduced the brown sugar to 1/4 cup! they turned out delicious. i think this is a very forgiving recipe. the only think i didn't deviate from was the wet mixture and the addition of one cup of flour. thanks for a great recipe! my kids love them and i feel good about giving it to them!!!

I added chocolate and banana protein powder and cut the sugar to 1/3 cup. YUM! Seriously. Yum. I also didn't have wheat germ, but I did research and found out that it wasn't a necessary ingredient.

This is a very good recipe to use as a base and modify to your liking.
I used a mix of ground flax seed and ground nuts instead of the wheat germ. I also used coconut oil to up the nutritional value as it is a much more high quality oil then canola or other veggie oils. They were easy and turned out great. My kids really love them (especially if I add chocolate chips).
Next time I am going to try using Oat Flour for a totally wheat-free version.

The most versatile recipe ever!  Just use whatever fruit you have - tasty with fresh fruit, dried fruit, or even chocolate chips!  Whole wheat flour works great too!  Something both adults and kiddos love.

I decreased brown sugar to 1/2 c. as suggested and found that it was still very sweet.  I baked in 9x13 until golden on edges and they're nice and chewy.  This is definitely something we'll be freezing and grabbing for lunches and picnics.  Great recipe and I can see loads of variations to keep them from getting boring.

This is a really great base! I made this recipe for the first time last night and substituted some ingredients for my thesis writing friends, who liked it. I changed it so it wasn't too sweet, lower in fat, and had a bit of protein.

I was crunched for time this morning when I made this recipe. I didn't have any raisins, but had all the other ingredients. These bars were a breeze to make and turned out so delicious. I had to add about 3-4 tbsp of heavy cream and some peanut butter for the bars to come together, but I'm not complaining because these granola bars were amazing. This will be my go-to recipe for a quick afterschool snack.

I've gotten so I make these all the time!  Even people who are way above me in baking skills ask for the recipe.  Mine always turn out chewy, not crunchy, though.  I don't know why.  Maybe I'm not cooking them long enough, or maybe it's because I use quick-cook oats?  In any case, I've made them with all different fillings and they're always a hit.

Loved them! I also made some with 1/4 cup wheat germ, 1/4 cup flax seed meal, 3 T nutritional yeast, dried cherries, pistachios, pepitas and agave nectar instead of honey (less sweet) and dark chocolate chips on top. Soooo good.

Delish! To make them vegan I used a chia egg as an egg substitute (1 TBSP chia seeds, 3 TBSP water), agave nectar in place of the honey, and also replaced the wheat germ with ground flax seeds, since that's all I had on hand. I also subbed the oil for unsweetened applesauce. Looking forward to playing around with different additives!

Several reviewers complained these were not chewy enough. I only had 1/4 c honey so I also added 1/4 c maple syrup. They were really chewy and delicious. Also added 3/4 c mini cinnamon chips.

I love this recipe! I use whole wheat flour and double the cinnamon. I add 1/2 cup applesauce (no sugar added variety) to make them chewy. I also add 1/2 cup chopped almonds, mixing half in with the dry ingredients and sprinkling the rest on top. Bake 30 mins, delish!

These were pretty good. I have also tried substituting the raisins for 2/3 cup of almonds, and this worked really well! I prefer the taste, to be honest. Also, I substituted apple sauce for the oil and it made the creation have a hint of apple crisp flavour hidden amongst the traditional granola bar flavour. Yum. Thanks for the recipe!

Thanks for sharing this one! I have a teen with dairy and nut allergies and this is a winner! I, too, will play with it-seems very versatile. I did decrease wheat germ to 1/4 c. and added 1/4 c. flaxmeal. Also substituted applesauce for oil and didn't add any raisins, but added about 1/2 c. mini-chocolate chips-used other suggestions and only baked 25 min.  Delicious!

WOW!!!! This recipes is exactly what I wanted. And it is so delicious! Like most other users, I made a few alterations to the original recipe: I used about 2/3 cup brown sugar, 1/4 wheat bran and 1/4 cup flax seed (in place of the wheat germ), 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1 cup whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour, about 1/3 cup of honey, and I added about 1/2 each of raisins and dried cranberries. I sprinkled sliced raw almonds on the top ar well. I also only baked it for about 26 minutes (based on other's comments) and they were very chewy, almost a sticky granola texture, and they didn't form bars because of this. Next time I make this, I will probably bake it for 30 minutes in a 9 by 9 baking pan, just to get a thicker bar. Very, very good though. Highly recommended.

Great recipe - the bars are actually bars and not crumble when cut. For added nutrition, I added sunflower and pumpkin seeds. I substituted some dried cranberries and dates for the raisins - about 50g each. I used onlly 50g of brown sugar, but with the sweetness of the dried fruits, I will omit the omit the brown sugar all together next time.

I have been using allrecipes.com for several yrs. and this is my first post & all I have to say is WOW!!! I followed the traditional recipe though used WW flour, 1/2 c brown sugar and about 1/2 c pulp from my juicer (I figured that would serve as the applesauce some were using for moisture.  Took the advice of another review, and didn't cover the whole 9x13 pan & it does stay true to form while baking! Added 1/4 cup chopped peanut, pecan, walnut, almond and mini choco-chips, popped those babies in the oven for the whole 35 min and they turned out insanely awesome! Definitely will experience more of these devine delights in the near future while experimenting new add-ins!

Fantastic recipe as it is. They freeze well too and I don't have a problem with them being brittle. I think this is because I make them thicker by leaving an inch of space or so around the edge of the pan.    I add various things: almonds, cherries, dried cranberries, mashed bananas and it always turns out great. I've omitted the vanilla accidentally and that is OK too. My fiance doesn't have much of a sweet tooth, but he likes these for breakfast with coffee. Score!

Love it!  I added 1/2 cup flax instead of wheat germ and it's good this way, too.  I used mini chocolate chips instead of raisins and the kids just gobbled them up while they were still warm.  My husband had one later and immediately asked, "Honey?"  I said, "Yes, quite a bit."  I may try to take the honey down in it.  This is definitely a keeper of a recipe which I'll enjoy making different versions in the future.

Just pulled my first batch out of the oven. Very tasty and super easy to make. I used my teenage daughters favorite (cranberries) for this batch but I will definitely play with some other combinations on future batches.

I substituted the raisins with trail mix (plus extra trail mix) and it's delicious!!!  I kept the salt even though the trail mix was salted resulting in a sweet & salty granola bars! Even though mine never come out pretty or as perfect bars this is still an EXCELLENT recipe!

ummmmm... i have mixed emotions toward this recipe. haha. i didn't have wheat germ so i substituted with all-purpose flour, and changed the 1 cup all of all-purpose flour to whole wheat flour. then i only added 1/3 cup brown sugar (im happy i did so cause they were still sweet enough).. and i ommited the egg- just because i thought it.. Overall, they tasted a little like gronala cookies. ive made them a couple times thinking they will grow on me, but yeah, its jus not working out..

This was my first attempt making home-make granola bars.  I followed Ella's recommendations and cooked them for 18 minutes.  Great recipe to play with!  I recommend cutting them with a plastic knife to prevent sticking.

I just made this today, and it is excellent! I did alter the ingredients so it would be healthier. Applesauce instead of oil, 1/4 cup of honey, no salt, and I bought wheat germ that had flax seed and cinnamon ground into it. I also added cranberries and almond slivers, and used whole wheat flour. Overall, delicious!

As written, this recipe is more like an oatmeal cookie bar than a granola bar.  Very tasty, but very sweet.  The second time I made these, I cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup, used a bit less honey, and threw in some applesauce to make sure there were enough wet ingredients still.  Like others said, this recipe is nice because you can change it as you wish.  I through in a handful of almonds, coconut, craisens and a small handful of mini chocolate chips.  They turned out great!  Now quite as satisfying to the sweet tooth as the original version, but healthier and still tasty!

These taste great and definitely stay in the desired bar shape. One thing I was disappointed in was the cake like texture. They didn't really taste like granola bars, just bars with oats in them. Next time I will reduce the flour and possibly add rice krispies. Also, I used 1/2 C applesauce instead of oil.

Very good! These are not so much granola bars, but more like those oatcakes that were in every coffehouse and health food store in the 90's. I also modified the recipe and they turned out delicious and a lot healthier! Reduced the brown sugar a bit and eliminated the honey, and substituted the oil for applesauce.

Oh my goodness, these are sinfully delicious.  I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, only 6TBS honey and only 1/2C brown sugar.  I used 1/2C dried cranberries (no raisins)  and diced up some dried apricots.  I topped it all with slivered raw almonds.  I baked for 28 minutes.  The only bummer is the portion size is tiny considering the calorie content, but very healthy!

So good and so easy!  I used dates and chocolate chips and substituted maple syrup for honey - a little less than called for since the dates are so sweet.  They turned out perfect and will be great to take to work.  I look forward to making this again and trying out new combinations.

these were absolutely delicious! i only had 1 cup of oats so i halved the recipe. i also didn't have wheat germ, so i crushed graham crackers as a substitute. i used mostly applesauce and a spoonful or 2 of oil. I used a little bit less honey, whole wheat flour, didn't use the raisins and baked the bars less for chewiness. a fantastic recipe!

I used flax instead of wheat germ since I didn't have any. I measured out the 1/2 cup, then ground half of that in my coffee grinder and left the rest whole; probably used more like a full cup this way. I used a cup of dried cranberries instead of 3/4 cup of raisins, since I didn't have any. I added 1/3 cup of unsweetened coconut flakes. I reduced the cinnamon to 1/2 teaspoon. so it wouldn't overpower the other flavours. I believe the bars came out crumbly as opposed to chewy because of the increased amount of dry ingredients; hence reducing the brown sugar by half and upping the honey would keep relatively the same amount of sweetness while binding them better.

I was told by 6 kids that we had over, that these were "way better than the ones you buy in the store"! What a great compliment. I used Craisens instead but I'm sure they are just as good with raisins! Thank you!

Made these today for the first time (in fact, this is my first review EVER), and they came out GREAT! I omitted the salt- didn't see the need for extra sodium. Also, I'm not sure about the serving size. I didn't get anywhere near 24 granola bars. In fact, I got 8 large squares. Of course, they were made for adults as opposed to children, but still. I think that the yield estimate might be off. I do want to cut them smaller next time, but I still don't think this will yield anywhere near 24 bars. We'll see. Overall though, this was a fantastic and healthier alternative to store-bought granola bars. Thanks for sharing!

so good, I don't think I can make these anymore!  My only complaint is they are way to sweet, and all that sugar gives me both an incredible sugar buzz and more calories than I want.   But they're so tasty I can't stop eating them.  Next time around I'll have to cut back on the brown sugar and honey.

I followed the recipe except for replacing the raisins with dark chocolate chips.  I wish they were a little chewier, especially the next day, but they were still very good!

Enjoyed by most in our family.  One son was not impressed.  I used cocout oil, agave syrup instead of honey, and subbed mini m&ms for the raisins.

I had almost all of the ingredients already in my cupboard, and the ones I didn't have were easy substitutions. I used a half cup of corn syrup since I had no honey, wheat bran instead of wheat germ, and tossed in some rice krispies, coconut, sliced almonds, and raisins. I cut back on flour a little since I added krispies, not really even measuring, just a half a handful here and there. It cut nicely into 12 meal sized bars, making it my new healthy (cheap) energy bar. Why pay $2 a piece when these were so fool proof and delicious? Thank you!!!

These bars came out great! I reduced the brown sugar to a tad over 1/2 cup. I used canola oil in place of the vegetable oil. You can taste the honey in this recipe, which adds a nice flavor. Next time I make these, I'll add some different ingredients such as raisins or  blueberries. Very Nice! oh and when mixing the ingredients together, I used a plastic glove. It worked great and made clean up a snap.

This is a very versatile and delicious recipe that was really easy to make. I made one batch following the recipe and one where I added slivered almonds, substituted half of the brown sugar for splenda brown sugar, the same amount of applesauce for the oil, whole wheat flour instead of white and used almond extract instead of vanilla as it was all I had on hand- it still turned out great. I also used a slightly smaller pan than the 9x13 and would be surprised if the batter could fill the larger pan.

Awesome! We love these. I just made for the first time, reducing sugar to 1/2 cup, replaced wheat germ with ground flaxseed, used whole wheat flour, and replaced raisins with Craisins. I watched closely and ended up baking for 25 minutes. I don't think the extra 5 would have hurt, though. They are still very chewy. I'm going to try chocolate chip peanut butter next time. Yum!

Following the other reviews, I used 3 c rolled oats and baked for 18 mins.  Will definitely make again.  It's a bit sweet so I will try cutting down the brown sugar (I think the honey helps with the chewiness so I wouldn't touch that).  will also try with other dried fruit just for variety.  Thanks, this will be a great on the go snack.

Loved this recipe, only thing i changed was to use whole wheat flour, and as other reviewers said use 3 cups of rolled oats and bake for 18-20 minutes. I ended up with some delicious and chewy granola bars. I will make again and again and try new add-ins

We made these to recipe and added 3/4 cup of chocolate chips, because according to three year olds granola bars aren't anything without the chips.  These turned out really great and they smell fantastic.  On the edges of the pan they were crispier but I had used a glass baking dish instead of metal pan, so I think that was my fault.

Made my healthier - whole wheat flour, used wheat germ and flax meal, 1/2 veg oil and 1/2 applesauce. added lots of cinnamon and some allspice.  used agave nectar instead of honey. will continue to use agave nector but will consider adding splenda or more brown sugar for more sweetness.  I crumbled and baked @45 minutes for crumbled granola.  Great base!  Will continue to modify based on my kitchen ingredients!

I made these to take with us on a family ski vacation. They were a hit! They kept the whole time and were great to throw in the backpack for a mid-ski snack. I'm definitely making them again.

Very good.  Just note these are not like the typical crunchy bars you buy in the store.  They are more of a soft granola or cookie bar.  My kids love them.  I only use 1/4 c. brown sugar and stil super sweet.  I make a batch every few days and throw different things in each time.  Awesome.

These bars are awesome - I have made them 4 times since I found the recipe and made them differently each time.  I tried adding espresso powder and cocoa along with coconut and chocolate chips and they were great! I did add applesauce as well per another reviewer's advice, it makes them softer.  Very yummy, and when I give these to my family, I KNOW what is in them!  And it's not preservatives and additives.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These are great, very versatile.  I've made them many times.  I cut the brown sugar to 1/2 cup, use half whole wheat pastry flour, and use dried figs or dried apples in place of raisins (I hate raisins).  I add 1/2 cup walnuts or pecans and will sometimes use half flaxseed meal/half wheat germ.  They always turn out great and keep well for a few days.  I put them in the freezer if it's going to be longer than that.

YUM! I decided that I wasn't about to pay more for all natural, high-fructose corn syrup free store bought granola bars. This recipe is great. I changed it up a little. I added 1/2 c. apple sauce, 1/2 c mini chocolate chips, chopped walnuts, dried cranberries and substituted 1/4c. steel cut oats for 1/4 c of the rolled oats and only used 1.5c rolled oats. I used a pizza cutter to cut them while warm.

This recipe is a winner around my house.  I love he flavors.  The only adjustments that I make are to double the recipe and spread them a bit thicker and cook for a slightly shorter time that suggested (Between 25 and 30 minutes)  This way they stay chewy and moist and keep very well!  Great for my young kids and me alike!

This recipe is great and very tasty. I added 1/2 cup of applesauce to recipe and it turned out great. I think the next time I make this I am going to add a chopped apple to the recipe. My husband and kids think this is the best recipe I have found.

AWESOME!! my husband and I both loved thes. When I was making them I didn't have any raisins so I instead sprinkled some coconut shaving on top, before cooking. I also subtituted the sugar and honey for 1/2 C of agave nectar.  Other than that they were pretty good :)

These were tasty (and smell really good baking per my 5-1/2 year old son)!  Instead of raisins I used a dried fruit mix and chopped peacans.  I also used only about half the brown sugar.  Next time I will use slightly less flour.  These are GREAT and I will be making these again!

Great granola bars. This was my first time making them and I am really impressed. I followed one person's suggestion of cutting back on the brown sugar. I actually would have liked them sweeter and will follow the original recipe next time. I did not have wheat germ, but in place of it I used wheat bran. I will definitely make these again.

These were ok. I made two batches, a chocolate chip and a cranberry/almond. The kids mostly liked the chocolate chip ones, but the cranberry almond were too cakey and thick. I don't think I liked the flour in them. Unless I am willing to add chocolate, I don't think I'll be making them again. Just didn't taste like the store kind.

Crunchy and tasty.  I used white whole wheat flour and substituted white flour for the wheat germ.  Also used 1/4cup agave instead of the honey.  Also did not use any raisins.  Will make again and experiment more.  Thanks!

I used white whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose and I threw in four heaping Tbps. of chia seeds. This added tons of nutrition without a single whine. No one was the wiser.

I replaced the honey with 1/2 cup brown sugar. The result: very crumbly, but delicious. Next time, I'll increase the oil if I leave out the honey. Everyone loved these!

I was not let down; this is better than storebought granola bars.  I think my husband and I ate more than our toddlers, though, because we enjoyed them so much!  I added flaxseed meal.

Delicious!  The only change I made was to use MINI CHOCOLATE CHIPS instead of raisins.  Next time we'll try a few of the health-boosting changes.  But, I first wanted my kids to eat them as well as they eat the HFCS-laden Quaker ones!

My kids LOVE these!  I am not a big fan of honey, and they are a bit too honey-tasting for me.  They can't have wheat, so we leave out the wheat-germ and use a gluten free flour.  We have tried it with chocolate chips, dried fruit, coconut, almonds...it is good any way you do it.

3/4 tsp salt was a little too much for my tastes. I'll cut it back to 1/2 tsp next time. I made cinnamon and raisin, as the recipe called for - and they are very tasty. Next time I'll try some different add in and flavors.

A great base for granola bars! The first time I made these, I thought they were a little dense. However, the next time I made them, I threw in some rice crispies to lighten them up, and they turned out AMAZING. I also may have added a few chocolate chips and extra brown sugar which probably helped. I don't know how healthy I made them, but they sure taste good and make a great breakfast.

I have made this following the recipe exactly (when I was out of my more healthy ingredients) and they are pretty tasty. Although, I would NOT bring these to a playgroup. They are pretty unhealthy (oil, sugar, white flour). As is, they are more like a bar cookie than a granola bar.

1st time I have ever made Granola bars and I loved them! I followed one of the reviews though used whole wheat flour, reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 a cup. They were still really sweet. I also added dried cranberries and chopped some almonds, I am making some this week me and my toddler ate them all up! My husband said they were a little dry but I think he thought they were cookies not granola bars. I will be making these all the time now just so we always have them on hand!

I thought these were great...I did cook them for slightly less time (about 20 minutes) because I wanted them to be chewy and they turned out great!  The only reason I give them 4 stars is that my kids/husband are picky picky and they didn't like the "big chunks" of oats, so I will have to process the oats a little before next time.  Very yummy though.

I'm giving this 5 stars because I've made them twice, doubling the recipe each time, I'm able to substitute the add-ins that my family likes (mini-marshmallows, 1/2 c peanut butter) for the cranberries and coconut, and both adults and kids think these are awesome.  My kids refer to them as "cookies" (cookie bars) and adults refer to them as "granola bars".  Either way, they work for breakfast or dessert.

Great recipe! Don't have to buy granola bars at the store anymore. I used less honey (about 1/3c) and less sugar (about 1/3 cup). Used half white and half whole wheat flour.

I thought these were too sweet to pass as granola bars they are more like oatmeal cookie bars. Next time I am going to replace the honey with agave.

my friend recommended these granola bars to me. ever since then i have had to make them every week for my husband. he likes these much better than the store bought kind. i made 2 changes-I use wheat flour instead of regular, and instead of raisins I use half a bag of peanut butter chips and half a bag of chocolate chips.

I've made these several times. I'm not sure I've made them the same way yet but they are always very good.  I do some with chocolate to keep the DH happy and sometimes PB and sometimes fruit and sometimes nuts, whatever I'm in the mood for that day.

Great recipe!  I have made this several times now, each successfully!  I would like to note that I get the best results when I bake these in a glass (Pyrex) pan.  I have also varied the recipe by substituting the 1/2 c. honey with 1/2 c. peanut butter and adding chocolate chips.  The mixture will seem dry and you will have to mix it with your hands until it's all uniform, but once you bake it, it will turn out beautifully!  I have also made the basic recipe with ground almonds and raisins.

I liked it and my 2 year old did too.  I added apple pieces, but my 5 yr old didn't like it.  I also used wheat flour to try to make it a little more healthy.  Maybe if I used the white flour he would have liked it more.  These were soft and chewy.  I like mine like this!

My entire family, even the picky ones, gobbled these down the same day I made them. And I followed the recipe to the T. I may reduce the sugar and try whole wheat next go-around, just to make them a little "healthier".

These were pretty good.  They were like a super-dense oatmeal-raisin cookie.  I made a double batch, and they kept for over 10 days.

These were easy and very good. I made them exactly to the recipe and they were great but very very sweet. I will definetly use less Brown Sugar as other reviewers have said next time.

I wanted to like these but they are only OK. I added some extra applesauce, apricots & chocolate chips but it still seemed like it was missing something.

These came out 5+stars the first time I made them and more like 3 stars the 2nd time...I obviously did something wrong the second time, but these are worth a try. These lend themselves to some very easy substitutions too, depending on what's in your pantry.

I added dried cranberries and walnuts.  I felt 30 minutes was way too long. I had to pull them out at 19 minutes. Love the idea I can play around with the recipe and make many varities.

Great bars!  Easy to make. Great out of the oven warm! I changed the recipe a bit. I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce. I used flax seed instead of wheat germ. My kids loved these bars!  I will store in plastic and share w/ preschool friends.

I wasnt that impressed when I first tasted them. But when they cooled, and I ate 5 bars, I decided I liked them alot! I cooked them for 20 mins. Definately long enough!  I think this is a good base recipe that you could alter MANY different ways and not mess up. I used 1/2 ap flour and 1/2 wheat. I didnt have wheat germ so I used part flax seed and part wheat bran.  I used SPlenda brown sugar instead. I used dates instead of raisins. Based on other's suggestions, I cut them while they were hot and stored in plastic container. Still soft day after. I am not a huge granola bar fan, but do like oatmeal. Really enjoyed these bars.

Reduced the oil & sugar, added ~ 0.5 c applesauce, substituted dried cherries for the raisins, added minced candied ginger, and nixed the cinnamon. Yes, it drastically changes the recipe but It was quite a yummy treat! Very gingery.

We love these granola bars.  I just made them for the third time and I made a mistake.  I would NOT recommend using splenda brown sugar.  The bars turned out pretty dry.  Stick to the real thing!

Didn't use wheat germ (didn't have any) or oil (since I made this since it was high in fibre, so why use oil? I just used more honey and some yoghurt in it's place)   It was awesome, will make again, again and again :)

These were great! I loved 'em, the kid's loved 'em, everyone loved 'em! Only changes I did was that I reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup, used whole wheat flour, and used chocolate chips and peanut butter chips...yum! Can't wait to try these with different fruits/nuts/chips combos. Awesome :)

Very good! I reduced the amount of sugar to 1/4 cup and since I don't like much dried fruit, I added some natural crunchy peanut butter. I only baked for 20 minutes and was done. Thanks for the recipe!

I wanted to make something for back to school care packages for my nephews and this got the nod.  Not too sweet and chewier than your usual granola bar. I used a 9x11 inch pan so they were slightly thicker than the picture. My marathon runner husband loved them and immediately requested more as did our puppies!

These are wonderful snacks for the kids.  I like that you can play around with what goes in them.  Perhaps they might be a touch sweet and next time I think I will use just a bit less sugar like others have suggested.

These are really good and healthy, too!  So much better than the preservative laden, air filled granola bars in the grocery stores.  I made mine with some chocolate chips and pecans, sliced them up, wrapped them then froze them for school lunches.  If my husband stops eating them then we actually might have some left for school.  :)

These were great with my modifications, though sticky sweet.  I only used 1/3 cup brown sugar, next time I think I'll only use a tablespoon - the raisins and honey make it very sweet already.  I had no wheat germ so I just replaced it with almond powder, I believe it helped give it a softer texture which I really liked.  Thanks for the recipe - I'll play around with it unless I find the perfect combination of sugar, raisins and honey!

I love these bars. It was essy to make and easy to pack in lunches. My kids learned to like them. Because they were used to the store bought granola bars, it took them 2 batche of these to fully appreciate the pure taste of ingredients. Great helathy snack.

I cut back on oil and sugar, as previous reviewers. Added flax and used whole wheat flour. Baked for just over 20 mins, then they started to get quite brown so I took them out. They're pretty good, but nothing fantastic. More cinnamon next time, and will add dried fruit or berries. Although I will make again for our biking trips and an afternoon snack at work. Thanks!

I add flax seed, use whole wheat flour, less brown sugar, just a little oil/replace with applesauce, it's a great standard recipe with lots of options to play with.  My family loves them...especially my 2 year old, and I am glad they are so good for you.

My family loves these and they have become a staple at our house as well.  I use whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour.  Craisens are also good in the bars.  I use coconut oil for the vegetable oil.  Very tasty!

Remind me more of a bar cookie than a granola bar but overall good texture and flavor.

They were really crunchy, and I would have liked for them to come our more chewy.  I plan on trying again, but will use a 9x9 cake pan so they go in thicker, and hopefully come out chewier :)  Great base reciepe for granola bars, very accomodating for everyones tastes :)

Super delicious! I did not have wheat germ on hand but I added in some coconut, sesame and chopped walnuts and the resulting product was superb! Will definitely make those again and again.

Very easy to make.  We did not add the raisins, but did add in some mini chocolate chips.  My husband and 3 and 1 year old girls loved them.  In fact my youngest daughter kept going back to the container asking for "mo".  Thanks for the great recipe...we will definitely be making more!

I found these bars far too sweet for my liking (and I love sweet things). I also prefer crunchier bars. But my husband seemed to like them.

I've made these 3 times and I love them.  I didn't have (still don't have) wheat germ, so I subbed flax seed & used dried blueberries twice and dried cherries once.  I'm about to make them again, they're great on the  go breakfast bars!

I made these on a greased jelly roll pan, but just spread into a rectangle (didn't reach the edges), since I wanted them on the thinner side.  Added dried cranberries and used oat bran instead of wheat germ.  This could not have been easier to make, either.  The best granola (or granola bar) recipe I have ever tried!

I made these for the first time 2 months ago and my husband and baby love them so much I've made them every week since.  I cut the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and usually add coconut and almonds.  I am sensitive to wheat so substituted rice flour in place of the flour and wheat germ.  I will never go back to store bought granola now!

These are great, I don't usually like bars like this but these had a really nice flavour.  The only things I changed were to use wholemeal flour, some sunflower seeds as well and I used 1/4 cup brown sugar and they were still sweet.

These were so yummy!!  I did put in Chocolate chips in instead of raisins.  They didn't turn out crumbly at all, but I did press them down into the pan before I baked them.  These are a huge hit with my family and kids that I babysit for.

LOVE these granola bars. Even my boyfriend thinks they're one of my best baked goods :) I made some changes that were recommended by others to make it a little healthier: used whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup sugar instead. A great snack on the go or as a treat at night :)

These were good and made a large batch.  My 12 y old daughter made the bars adding mini chocolate chips.  She enjoyed mixing everything together with her hands. I like that there is very little sugar and no sodium compared to the store bought. We will be making these often!

Really good. I use wheat flour, more fruit, and a little less oil in these. But I do make them often. Sometimes I add mini chocolate chips, coconut, or crasins. Or anything else that sounds good. Any type of dried fruit can go with these.

These are really great & much less expensive than buying granola bars. I added 1/2 cup apple sauce, which made them nice & chewy. I also added raisons, craisons, chocolate chips & almonds. Substituted with whole wheat flour. Good stuff! I brought some in to work & they all loved them!

Pretty dang good! I sub'd the white flour for 3/4 cup whole wheat flour, and 1/4 cup ground flaxseed. They are a tad bit too sweet for me, so next time I will only add 1/2 of brown sugar instead of 3/4 cup.

My husband loves to eat healthy, so experimenting with desserts isn't great all the time.  But THESE!  They are so healthy, as whole grain as you dare to go, and like everyone says, totally versatile.  I make them with lots of crushed nuts, usually, and have also tried them with peanut butter... any way you make them, they rock!  The biggest tip I have is to be SURE they are done before you take them out.  That varies depending on what goes in them.  When I use lots of nuts, for some reason it can take 40 minutes to be cooked... with peanut better, 25.  Go figure!?  Anyhow, definitely keep an eye on these, and they will reward you with healthy deliciousness.

I am working on a farm at the moment and need as much nutrient and food-value (calorie is a BAD word for me,so I avoid it like the plague!)dense snack food as I can get.  These definitely fit the bill. Each time I've made them I've been missing an ingredient but they've still been good.  I make a double recipe in the same size pan and bake it for 1 hour.  I've used half of the wheat germ and the other half wheat flour, maple syrup, nuts, and all oatmeal and no wheat germ.  The maple syrup makes a moister bar, but it still works.  So good and good for you!  Thanks for the recipe!

The kids LOVE them!! I will NEVER buy granola bars from the store again! Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe.

Awesome and easy-peasy.  My husband is a contractor and this is an easy snack to slip in his lunch that will keep him going through the afternoon but he can eat on the fly.  I added banana and more nuts - whatever I had in the cupboard.

Wow!  These are seriously good.  I will be making these a lot because my 1 and 3 year old ate them up and my husband loved them too.  They taste like an oatmeal cookie, but even better.  I loved the consistency.  I followed everything pretty much right on, except I did half raisins / half cranberries.  I really liked mixture of sweet and tart and will prob do that again.  30 minutes is way too long to bake and you do need to watch to make sure the edges are not too brown.  I had to cut away part of the bars that were overdone.  Yum!!

We didn't like these at all.  Like other reviewers said, they're too "cakey". Texture was just like an un-risen cake. I won't be making these again. Edit:  I just made the "Easy Granola Bars" and they are so much better! They have the texture of a real granola bar and taste good, too.

I added chocolate chips and raisens to mine and really liked the combo.  I am sure just the raisens would be fine too.

I've never been a granola bar fan, but these may just change my mind. I used the optional raisins, and eliminated the wheat germ as I didn't have any. Also used whole wheat flour. They turned out very chewy, which we loved. Next time I will sub whole wheat flour for the wheat germ (or get to the store to buy some) to see how it turns out. The husband has requested trying dried blueberries, which I'll do tonight. Quick, easy, and way better than the $2.50 for an 8 count variety. Definitely a keeper.

Thank you for this recipe!!  These are wonderful - they not only taste great, but you can control the ingredients to make them as healthy as you like.  I replaced the raisins with chocolate chips (and sometimes a combination of chocolate and peanut butter chips), and used whole wheat flour instead of white.  Most importantly - my kids love them - they take them to track practice after school, and they have come home with several requests from their friends to send more to share.  I'll never buy granola bars again!

These are such a nice treat to have around the house! Next time I will try to incorporate applesauce and omit some of the oil for a healthier snack :) Thanks for the versitile and especially tasty recipe!

These are delicious and way better than store bought!  I didn't have wheat germ so I substituted bran.  I also put in less sugar, but added a few chocolate chips.

This was easy...and only reason I don't go five stars is a personal preference for less sugar. The oil, though, seemed a great alternative and mine, done a bit thicker than called for, have stayed chewy. Look forward to experimenting with other additives...like dried cherries, mini chocolate chips, rice cereal, etc. Oh. I also uploaded a photo, but can't seem to find it except on my "My Allrecipes" page. Hmmm. Anyway, thank you!

Whole wheat option...I used 2 1/2 cups of oats and 1 cup of whole wheat flour. The rest was the same. The finished product was a bit crumbly but it tasted delicious.  I would make them again in a heartbeat.

I really liked this recipe.  I altered the recipe a bit...used crushed flax seed, instead of wheat germ; used 1/2 whole wheat flour instead of all white flour; & used chocolate chips instead of raisins.  Thx for this one. Will definately make again!

I'm a longtime allrecipes user, but never registered until now. The main reason was so I could comment on how much I love this easy, delicious recipe. Like other commenters noted, so fun to add different components. My favorite combination thus far consists of unsalted peanuts, raisins and a few mini chocolate chips (to keep the boyfriend happy). I also reduced the brown sugar, as others mentioned, to 1/2 cup. I also use whole wheat flour. Mine take less time than the recipe states to cook, but more than some other reviewers...then again, all ovens are different. Mine take, on average, about 21 minutes. I've been bragging about this recipe all week to friends and family. It's definitely a keeper!

These were pretty good a little to sweet though. I think next time I will cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup. I used dried apples in place of the raisins which was really good. I will be making these again. Thanks!

Excellent! I just made these, they are still warm. I'm out of wheat germ, so I omitted that. I used whole wheat flour, canola oil and golden raisins. I added applesauce, and maybe a 1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips. My very, very, VERY pick 4 year old, who has like 4 foods he eats, is eating these up! Next time, I will use 1/3-1/2 cup brown sugar, it's a little too sweet for me, but still very good!

I'm kinda having a difficult time rating this recipe as I changes so many things. Álthough I'm almost 100% sure that the origianl would be PERFECT! Seeing as I wanted to cut calories I used Splenda brown sugar and I used applesauce instead of oil they ended up being very sweet but not that I couldn't eat them I threw in some cherry craisons and chopped whole almonds. Cooking them for 30 min would be waaay to much though I did about 17 min and they came out chewy and moist. They were not "granola bar"like more of a cookie but then again I changed so many thing. I would make again but I try ading banana's and cutting down on the sugar. Thanx for sharing.

Mine could have used a little less vegetable oil, after they cooled, they had an oily taste. I put them in an airtight container overnight and still they got slightly hard. THis is a great recipe and i will try different variations soon!

Very good. I changed the recipe slightly because of my son's food allergies. I used egg replacer. I also used only 1/2 cup brown sugar, 3/4 cup of honey, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour & 1/2 cup of bran flakes. My kids loved them... and it was so sweet when my 2 year old shouted "I'm not allergic?!!!" Thanks.

These were just OK. I made a few of the changes suggested, but in the end, they came up short. Maybe they're better with all the oil and sugar, but that defeats the purpose of a healthy granola bar.

These are the best granola bars I've ever tasted...they were like a healthier version of a giant oatmeal raisin cookie!!! I followed the recipe exactly, and they turned out really well.  The only thing that was different was that they only took about 25 minutes in my oven.  Otherwise, great stuff!

This recipe makes a great granola bar... make it by the recipe first then experiment with whole wheat flours, nuts, dried fruit... this bar is great for dieting because it fills you up for hours.

I thought this recipe was awesome! I substituted dates for raisins, changed the white flour to whole wheat flour, and added a 1/2 cup of coconut. (you can cut down on the sugar a little if you use sweetened coconut) Best recipe!

I have been looking for a good, healthy granola bar to make for my 2 girls.  This one looked great, although the taste is not that great.  They seem kind of bland.  I wanted a chewy bar, so I added 1/2 cup applesauce like some had suggested, and decreased the oil to 1/4 cup.  They turned out very chewy.  I also decreased the brown sugar to 1/4 cup because I did not want them to be too sweet.  Overall, they are pretty good, but I'd like something that tastes better.

I have made these several times now and always add different things to keep them interesting.  Today I added 1/2 cup of skim milk powder to boost the protein, and chopped apples and butterscotch chips. I run a home daycare and all my children loved them!

Very good. Nice change, with all the Easter Candy lying around, good deterrent.  Will try a larger pan(maybe a cookie sheet) to make a little thinner.

Hi,    I have made this several times. If you make the way the directions are they are sweet and more like a cookie. I have cut down the sugar and honey by half. I thought that they were bland, but still totally edible. Also my toddler son and his friends all like them. So they are a keeper. Enjoy!

These taste really good. I might press the batter out into a larger pan to make thinner, crispier bars but as is they came out great. I used a piece of wax paper to press the batter into the pan--it worked great. These were super quick to mix up and get in the oven--gotta love that!

I wish I had followed the recipe as written. Instead, I believed another reviewer who said that whole wheat flour could be substituted for all-purpose flour. Bleah. Yes, I suppose it CAN be substituted, but not if you want the granola bars to taste good.

OMG these were awesome.  Thanks so much for the recipe.  It is so easy to make and soooo much cheaper than the boxed stuff at the store.  I used mini chocolate chips and they turned out wonderful.

I make this recipe at least once a week.  My family loves it. I switch the raisons with white chocolate, peanut butter, or chocolate chips to keep it fun.  I also sometimes trade the vanilla with almond extract. My kids call those ones "cherry flavored".  No more individually wrapped bars for us!  Thanks for the recipe

I've made this recipe twice. The first time I made the full recipe. I left out the wheat germ and substituted trail mix for raisins. My friends and I really liked it but my husband didn't. The second time I made half the recipe in an 8x8 pan and baked them for 20 minutes. I left out the brown sugar and added 3 packets of Sweet 'n' Low. I used a mixture of raisins, slivered almonds, and sweetened flaked coconut (which made up for some of the sugar). They were less sweet than previously but still sweet enough for me. We'll see what the hubby thinks, but I don't think he'll like this version any more.

this is an excellent recipe, and my 2 year old loves them.  i was low on regular cooking oats, so ended up using 1/2 regular oats and 1/2 steel-cut oats and they still turned out delicious.  next time, i will probably throw in some dried cranberries and nuts.

Tried it with raisins and walnuts and liked but not loved them. Still needed more flavor. Would be willing to try again however with some of the suggested improvements, like peanut butter and mini choc chips.

This was amazing, especially after putting them in the fridge for a while. I used mixed dried fruit, almonds, extra raisins, and then applesauce in place of the oil.  I think I'll try a little less flour next time to see if it turns out more like commercial granola bars.

These tasted great.  I didn't have any flaxseed on hand, so I put an equal amount of flour.  I used all whole wheat flour.  I also was a tad shy on honey.  I tried the method someone suggested of shaping it in the pan with about 1/2- 1 inch space on each side.  They did turn out chewy and delicious.  I think they were a bit crumbly, perhaps because I used too much flour.  I added what raisins I had, as well as pecans.  I will make this again.

My whole family loved the granola bars I made from this recipe. It's super easy to customize with your own ingredients. We also used just 1/2 cup of brown sugar and added almonds and coconut to one batch and crisped rice to another. This is a great base recipe to add in things your family likes!

Oh yeah, these really are good. I played with it a bit. Per another review, I doubled it and baked it in a jelly roll pan. I should've reduced the baking time by a few minutes - they turned out a little too dark. I used 1/3 less honey (just a cost issue) and added extra wheat germ, a half cup each of flaxmeal, peanut butter and applesauce and used almond extract because I'm out of vanilla. (I think vanilla would be better). I found them to be dense, moist and chewy. My toddler and I both love them. Thanks!

Loved these!  I did craisins instead of raisins and added a handful of chopped pecans.  I also added 1/2 c. unsweetened applesauce and decreased the brown sugar to 1/2 c.  Lastly, I increased the cinnamon to 1 t.  Great recipe!  Thank you!

i'm sorry - i just don't get the hype.  i was totally trusting that these would be amazing because of the ratings.  maybe my taste standards are just higher than others.  i baked these until they were brown on the edges and they are soft, dry and just plain hard to swallow.  flavor is great but i have to dunk them in my tea just to swallow them, they are that dry.  i even followed advise and subbed 1/2c applesauce for 1/4c of the oil.  also added 1/4c peanut butter in addition to the 1/4c oil.  seemed like it should have turned out.  used almonds and chocolate chips.  going to try the "easy granola bars" recipe next time.  i guess even when a recipe is so highly rated, it's still all relative to what those rating it consider to be yummy!

I used peanut butter and part honey or part applesauce instead of the oil to make it healthier.  I also added flax seed meal which has a nutty undertone and is a great nutrient!

They're yummy.  Slightly chewy and good flavor.  I'll try adding nuts, coconut and other things next time.  The recipe worked well with flaxseed meal instead of wheat germ as well.

This recipe is awesome. I cut back to 1/2 cup brown sugar but think I will try less next time. Mine were perfectly baked at 13 minutes. I'm making more today and am going to add dried cranberries and walnuts.

I clicked upon this recipe totally by chance, made them with a house full of kids.  When they were all done playing they were looking for something to eat and saw a plate of these on the counter.  Within minutes there were only a few left and they were all saying how they loved them! My son asked me to make more!  I Recommend this recipe to anyone!!!

This came together really quickly which I like.  I skipped the raisins but added craisins and white chocolate chips.  I think you can easily make alot of variations which I like.  I ate one for breakfast today and it kept me full for a few hours which was great.  My boyfriend keeps calling them cookies becuase they are such a treat.

Made 2 batches of these yesterday. 1st one w/ a cranberry and raisin mix and the 2nd w/ just craisins. The second batch worked better for me, I think that I cooked the 1st a tad too long. I used a previous suggestion of leaving a 1 in. gap in the pan. These turned out really chewy and good! Recieved many compliments, and I like how you can add so many different things!

I've been looking for the longest time for a good granola bar recipe to fill my locker with snacks. Thanks! I didn't have enough honey in my house, and didn't have any wheat germ, but the bars turned out great anyways. Next time I'll be sure to keep the full amount of honey to keep the bars together. Also, don't be afraid if the granola bars seem to crumble apart a bit at first - a few bars were left out overnight in my kitchen and they were much firmer the next day. Thanks again for the recipe =)

We love these granola bars! I didn't use the wheat germ because I didn't have any on hand and I added a little extra oats. I used craisins instead of raisins and I add some chopped walnuts as well. These are so good and so easy to make!

I just found and made this recipe TWICE already this week.  I've shared it with my co-workers who raved over it and I can't stop eating them!  I did substitute 1/4/cup Splenda Brown Sugar blend for the sugar to cut calories some because I added so much other good stuff! I used 3/4 cup of trail mix fruit for the add-ins.  They are wonderful.  I read a lot of the reviews and followed some suggestions.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Not the best... not much taste.  Maybe I should have used the original recipe instead of trying things mentined in the reviews.  I added 1c applesauce, only 1/2 cut brown sugar and used whole wheat flour.  If I make them again, I'll follow the recipe exactly to see how they turn out!  My 3 year old wouldn't eat them.

Delicious!  I made it and made a couple of changes.  I added 1/2 cup of flax seed and used dried cherries in place of the raisins.  I also added 3/4 cup of sliced almonds.  It only took 20 minutes to cook.

I'm giving these a 3 for now- they seemed a little crumbly. It's probably because I added 1/3 c ground flax seed and a 1/2 c oat bran to the recipe. Tastes great- but we've got more granola than granola bar. I'll be trying these again.

It's fabulous if you add things to it. It's rather plain as is. I added craisins and sunflower seeds. I'm definitely going to use this recipe again as a base recipe for some great granola bars.

This is a great recipe!  I am always looking for healthy recipes to try, and this is the first granola bar recipe that I have been truly happy with.  It's so easy to midify!  They are a little sweet for me, however.  I've made these twice, and the second time was my favorite so far:  I substituted applesauce for half the oil, used 5-grain hot cereal for the oatmeal, whole wheat flour for all purpose, cornmeal for the wheat germ (didn't have any), added only about a third of the sugar called for, and used only 1 tsp of vanilla.  I found that the first time I made them, the vanilla came through a little too strong, but that could have been because I used all applesauce in place of oil and didn't add the brown sugar.  I also found that when using applesauce, if you like a crispier bar like I do, it's best to bake it for 5-10 minutes more than the recipe says.  Overall, though, this recipe is awesome, exactly what I was looking for!  Thanks!

These were great and fast to throw together!  I put in some flax seed, pumpkin seeds and sunflower seed for extra nutrition along with almonds and cranberries.  I wont ever buy granola bars again.

I love this recipe!  I have been making these for a few years now.  Every time I make these I add something different.  If you add some peanut butter and peanuts you have pb granola bars.  Or I make trailmix bars with raisens, craisens, nuts, m&ms, choc chips, ans sun flower seeds.  You can really let your imagination loose with this recipe...and the bars come out Excellant every time!

The beauty of this recipe is the ability to alter to your liking.  So I cut the oats to 1 1/2 cups and added 1 1/2 cups of Organic Flax Seed Pumpkin Cereal (no reason, just saw it in the store and though it would be a good addition)  so then I omitted the wheat germ and also the salt.  Kept all the wet ingredients the same plus added 1/2 c each of golden raisins, coconut, chocolate chips and finely chopped slivered almonds.  When I thought they were done baking, I cut them in the pan before they cooled but could tell they would crumble so I scored them and put them back in the oven to continue baking - sorta like with biscotti.   I placed the bars on a baking rack to continue cooling.  These were delicious,  I know I will be making them often!

I thought these were great but very sweet even though I reduced the brown sugar to 1/4 cup. I think next time I will cut the sugar out entirely and just use the honey and maybe reduce that as well. I added almonds and cherry flavored crasins because I hate rasins. I also used alcohol free vanilla syrup(kind of like extract but in syrup form and nice flavor) from the brand Fairtrade and that added more flavor. I used whole wheat flour also and added about half a cup of unsweetened applesauce which I think gave it a very nice chewy texture. Once they came out the oven I waited 5 minutes and cut this into bars and immediately wrapped them in plastic wrap to keep it chewy and moist. The end result with the above changes made this a 5 but as is this is a 4. Thank you preggomom!

thanks for the wonderful and healthy recipe. i didn't change any thing but i added about 1/4 c of flax seeds, and some seedes like pumpkin and sunflower seeds. as other reviwers said, baking time should be less, but with the 35 min. it was OK. i am sure i will make again with different additions, i used to make Beth's spicy oatmeal cookies but this one is more healthier i think.

Super easy and super good. I always sub whole wheat for white flour and add somewhere between 1/4 and 1/2 cup of peanut butter and a handful of mini m&ms.  I would like to say I make these just for the kids, but my hubby and I gobble these up too!

my kids (ages 4and1/2 and 2 1/2 did like the granola bars as is, quite a bit; however i should say we only liked them when we got bites with raisins in it,because otherwise they were a bit too dry.

This is the fourth time I've made these and they've turned out fantastic each time. I subbed applesauce for the oil and whole wheat flour for the white. I have used craisins and slivered almonds, chocolate chips, and dried apples with extra cinnamon. Right now I have a mixed berry batch in the oven. Love the versatility!

Very esay to make, doesn't take much time or effort. I used dried cranberries in place of the raisins. I made these for my daughters pre-school class and everyone loved them and the teachers even asked for the recipe. Next time I will make them with some peanut butter and chocolate or PB chips. I took advice of another reviewer to make them softer by not spreading the mix all the way to the edges. They turned out perfectly soft and chewy and remained that way!

In my ongoing need to ruin wonderful recipes by trying to make them healthier; I made these a second time.  This time, I replaced the oil with applesauce.  Please do not make the same mistake I did.  It seems the oil is a necessary component of the recipe. Made as directed these bars are fantastic.

I love this recipe. We have veried it so many ways. My favorite is adding dried cherries and chocolate chips. I use applesauce, splenda, egg substitute, maple extract, and molasses to keep it chewier. Trying marshmallows and chocolate chips right now!

I make these bars all the time.  They are great for breakfast or an on-the-go snack.  I use whole wheat flour instead of white flour.  I make them a little thicker as suggested in the reviews.  I have added many different ingredients and I don't think that you can mess them up.  I usually add a bit of ground flaxseed meal, and have tried coconut, almonds, chocolate chips, sunflower seeds.....all yummy.

I was really excited to try this recipe and actually make granola bars for my kids instead of buying them, but these turned out quite hard and were very dense. I won't be making this recipe again.

My kids had a sudden aversion to raisins, which of corse they usually love. In any case they didn't like these, however the neighbor kids loved them. I liked them, but I will do a little playing with them. I did take a suggestion of adding 1/2 cup applesauce, as I like chewy verses crunchy granola bars. That was a good call.

These granola bars are awesome and its a good start to ANY type of granola.  I made a batch of the recipe with the ingredients as shown then I made another batch with just apples and walnuts - YUMM-O!  I used 2 apples chopped finely and about 1 cup of walnuts chopped I also cut down on the sugar like others said because I thought they were sweet enough.  The kids LOVED both batches - and if I had to pick a favorite I would say the apples and walnuts.  A great "healthy" snack!

All I can say is this a a KEEPER... I have tried several granola bar recipes which were all good but,these are by far the best. I followed others adivce and used only 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup applesauce instead of the oil and I used 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. They turned out wonderful and they are very healthy which is always a plus. I am looking forward to trying these again and adding diferent things such as dried blueberries, orange crasions and the list could go on and on...

These were pretty good, but I made some major changes. I used 1 cup of rolled oats and 1 cup Kashi brand GoLean cereal, added some raw almonds, 1/2 cup packed brown sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup of cranberries (raisins give my dad gas, ha ha), and replaced vegetable oil with canola oil. The only thing I would change next time would be to eliminate the salt in the recipe altogether. They taste a little bit too salty, otherwise. Other than that, they came out really well, and are packed with protein thanks to the wheat germ and Kashi cereal (which contains 13 grams of protein per cup)

Very good and flexible recipe.  I vary the granola bars depending on what I have on hand and my mood, for example, adding peanut butter or walnuts and dried cranberries.  Be creative with these!

Added extra wheat germ, ground flax, and used slightly less honey, and added coconut based on other reviewer comments. Used tongs to dip into a mixture of bittersweet chocolate and natural peanut butter. My friends jokingly refer to these as "colon-blow" bars. But in all seriousness, they're really very good. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was really good.  I had everything on hand already except the wheat germ.  So instead, I just added chopped walnuts.  I also added some dried cherries in addition to the raisins.  Very very good.  I thought it could maybe be a little more moist but I had absolutely no complaints!!

I really like this recipe! My daughter and I made two batches and added raisins to one batch and mini choc. chips and mini marshmallows to make s'mores granola bars.  I love that you could add so many different ingredients to make different combinations.  I did make it as is and it was a bit sweet.  I think I will follow others suggestions next time.

Very good!  My son takes meds that cause a major loss in apetite and I was looking for something that would be easy to grab, healthy, and tasty so that it would not be so hard to get breakfast in him.  These were easy to make and my kids all loved helping.  I added a bit of pumpkin pie spice to mine, some chopped pecans, dried cranberries and dried spiced apples.  They turned out great and I will certainly be making them again in the future.  Thanks!

SO YUMMY! I'd been using a no-bake recipe from this site until it mysteriously disappeared and was looking for a replacement - this is it! Because granola bar recipes tend to be endlessly forgiving, I made substitutions as I saw fit - used soy flour in place of 1/3 of the regular flour; used oat bran instead of wheat bran (heart healthy!); added 1/4 tsp nutmeg; craisins instead of raisins; and added walnuts and uncooked millet (my girlfriend's idea) for extra yummy crunch! As others mentioned, I cooked mine only about 25 minutes and they turned out perfect. I love how these are lighter than ones that call for peanut butter and chocolate (although I'm sure you could add those if you like). Great recipe, my new go-to - thanks!

Good and Simple! All the kids we gave it too really liked it. I added dried figs too and craisins b/c I had them. I tried this recipe w/ rice flour a second time- but it wasn't as good.

I'd rate this 4.5 stars if I could; the only change I've made is leaving out the brown sugar, as the recipe is plenty sweet with 1/2 a cup of honey (I also plan to try using the brown sugar and omitting the honey). I used untoasted wheat germ as well (the recipe didn't specify), and that worked perfectly. As other reviewers have noted, this lends itself very well to experimenting with other ingredients -- I recommend adding chopped walnuts. It only took about 20 minutes to bake, and I'll definitely be making these again.

This is a great base recipe to have. I'd been looking for a way to use the excess of oatmeal I'd stockpiled in the back of my pantry. Quick to prepare, too. I didn't have wheat germ, so I threw in another 1/2 cup of oats in its place. I also added a full cup of a dried mixed berry blend in place of the raisins and upped the spice to a tsp. (I used pumpkin pie spice.). After tasting them, I wasn't all that thrilled. I'd like to keep playing with these and see if I could improve on them. This is a great bar to prepare and keep on hand for a quick snack for both kids and parents. I plan on putting three or four in ziploc bags and freezing, and pulling them out when I plan on taking the kids out for errands/to the park.

I make these granola bars a lot, with the following alterations:

- add 1/2 cup wheat bran
- add a second egg
- hold the cinnamon and raisins
- add 1/2 cup sunflower seeds or pecan pieces
- add 1/2 cup bittersweet chocolate chips
- always used buckwheat honey

I bake until they are downright crispy around the edges.  They make a great breakfast on the go!

not bad, but kind of bland as written. i added a bit of slivered almonds, mashed banana and PB as others had suggested, but the flavor didn't really come through.  Next time I may amp up the add-ins and possibly toast the wheat germ/oats/almonds as I tried in another recipe for that something extra.

I've made these 3 times (3 different ways) and I think that my favorite way is with Craisins, use 1/2 cup of brown sugar (1/4 cup is ok,but not as good) wheat flour, substitute 1/4 cup of oil for applesauce, and only bake for 20 minutes.  So good!

Great recipe to play around with! I greatly decreased the amount of flour, and replaced the raisins with chocolate chips (forgot to omit the cinnamon, will do next time). It couldn't have been easier to make, and I like that it's lower fat than most other granola bar recipes I see.

This was my first try at making granola bars and they turned out quite well.  After reading other reviews, I reduced the brown sugar to 1/3 cup, swapped the oil for unsweetened applesauce, reduced the flour to 1/2 cup and used whole wheat flour, and used dried blueberries and flaxseed.  They turned out really good, but I wanted them to be a little less dense.  The flavor was great though.  I will definitely make these again and will play some more with the proportions.

These were really great.  I originally made them for my 2 year old and they were a little to difficult for him to eat, so I brought them to work and they were gone before lunch!  Someone else had made cookies and these bars went faster than the cookies.  I added some dried blueberries and everyone loved them and two asked for the recipe.  Thanks!

made this up tonight because my local import store was fresh out of granola bars and they turned out great... I didn't have wheat germ so I crushed up a cup of cornflakes, I'm a peanut butter lover so I added a spoonful of that, and used half raisins/ half crasins. SO GOOD. I also only baked them for about 20 minutes and the were perfect! YUMMY!

This is a good basic recipe though a little too sweet for our tastes.  I used whole wheat flour and melted Smart Balance (margarine) in place of the oil.  Instead of the germ I used up some left over cereal crumbs like raisin bran and shredded wheat and cranberries instead of raisins.  I will make the same next time except decrease sugar to about 1/4 cup and use a portion of real maple syrup in place of 1/2 of the honey.

These were good.  Kind of cakey if that's the word.  Instead of rasins I choppped up some craisins and they tasted good in this.  Also, I halved the brown sugar b/c they were for our toddler and they were still sweet.  Just a little healthier.  Will make  again.

I made this recipe this morning and was pretty impressed with it!  I don't like spending a lot of money on granola bars that are full of junk.  I follow the suggestion of someone and decreased brown sugar and add 1/4 cup of ground flax with a 1/4 cup of wheat germ.  I used dried cranberries and 1/4 c of white chocolate chips.  Very good.

Great, basic granola bar recipe. A wonderful way to add more whole foods into your diet. Easy to make, too. I had mine in the oven in about ten minutes.

Delicious! I used a little less bs, didn't have enough honey so I added a little molasses. Used a mix of flax seed, flour & oat bran. Mixed cranberries in with the raisins. Added a heaping t. of homemade pumpkin pie spice. Really good!

Very good and easy to edit according to what you have on hand.  My daughter can't get enough of them!  Like others suggested, I didn't spread out the batter completely. Just to the desired thickness.  Holds it's shape regardless.  Great one to try!

Here's a what I did and it turned out pretty cool! I put it in 2-8 inch pans, and then when it was done, I cut it with a large heart-shaped cookie cutter. If you use it with the pointy side in, it makes one star shaped one in the middle! Plus, all the crunchier edge pieces you have left over you can crumble and save to sprinkle on yogurt! Yum!!!

Had great taste, but turned out dry and hard. There was a prominent flavor that I wasn't crazy about at first, I think it was the honey. I added chopped almonds, peanut butter and substituted chocolate chips for raisins.  Would be better with a little fine tuning.

I have made these a half dozen times now, and they always come out great. I substitute kosher salt for the salt, egg substitute for the egg and applesauce for the oil. I put in only 1/2 C brown sugar as suggested by others, and don't keep wheat germ on hand, so just add a bit more oats to make up for leaving that out. These are a huge hit with my husband, who hasn't touched store-bought granola since I started making these.

I think the beauty of this recipe is that it is so flexible.  I doubt you can do anything to ruin it, based on all the changes other people have made.  Personally I was forced to make changes because it is too expensive or difficult to get some of the ingredients called for her in Japan and our ovens are a bit of a joke.  Still they turned out great.  I can see that this is a really good starting point for a lot of interesting bars.

These had a very good taste to the, I added a little more cinnamon, and some nutmeg, reduced the brown sugar (used splenda brown sugar blend), and did a couple other things to make them healthier. They definately stuck together find, but were a little more "cookie like" than what I was looking for. Think I will reduce the flour a little next time.

Thank you for a great recipe. I made a few changes to make it healthier. I substitute the oil with applesauce and add flax seeds to the mix. I also add some rice crispies for extra crunch.

Amazing! These bars are delicious. I had to make a few changes due to ingredients I didn't have. No wheat germ so I used extra flour, as other reviewers did I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup but 1/3 would be plenty. I added craisins, raisins and slivered almonds - I definitely recommend adding some nuts to give them crunch, and completely forgot the vanilla. I cooked them in a 8x8 pan for 25 minutes and they came out great. Next time I'll double the recipe!

To make it healthier, I substituted the oil for applesauce. I didn't have wheat bran, so I just used all whole wheat flour.  I think next time, I will try it with ground flax seeds (full of good omega fats).  I used craisins instead of raisins (because my sister doesn't like raisins) and I threw in some chopped almonds and shredded coconut for flavour.  These were healthy and delicious.  I know I changed it quite a bit, but I don't think I could've made it without this base recipe to build off of.  Thanks!

My husband eats these at his break at work.  I used 1 cup of apple sauce instead of the oil and cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup.  Very good basic recipe.  I have added nuts, coconut, cranberries, blueberries, apples and anything else I have around.  Very good.

Yummy!  Tried as is written and it turned out great, but now I only make with whole wheat flour and about half the sugar, and our family enjoys the changes even better.  Works great with just about any combination of dried fruit.  My kids and my daycare kids love these healthy treats!

I make this so often now, at least once a week.  I add ground flaxseed instead of wheat germ, a full cup of raisins, 1/2 cup of the brown sugar, and use a combo of olive oil and apple sauce.  Such a great base recipe that you can customize, depending on what type of dried fruit you have on hand.  Very easy breakfast on the go and my 2 year old loves them!

These are so good, I have a hard time leaving them alone.  I do cook them in a smaller container because I like them thicker.  I followed the suggestion of others and used milled flax seed instead of wheat germ and cut back on the sugar.  Tastes great!

these are so good!!! i've tried several variations, but my favorite is a craisin/walnut variation. and once i actually ran out of honey for my recipe so i substitued syrup instead and they were delicious!!! the only downside to making these is that i always seem to eat way more than enough at one time... ;-)

My kids love these, and I did too.  I just used 1/2 sugar like others suggested and cooked it for 20 min.  I might increase cooking time to make them crispier, though (like Nature Valley.)  They were very crumbly.  Also, I thought too salty.  I'll add less salt next time.  They are very versitle, to make other flavors.

I make these at least once a week.  I double the batch and use 1/2 the sugar and 3/4 whole wheat flour and 1/4 white flour.  I also use butterscotch chips instead of raisins.  My kids LOVE these and ask for them daily.  It takes about 10-15 minutes to mix and stick in the oven -- and makes 36 bars.

This is the best granola bar recipe! I have made it many times & tried it many ways. I use whole wheat flour instead of white flour and it is still grand. I also use canola oil - I tried applesauce and did not like it in this recipe. One of my families favorites is freeze dried banana chips and 1/3 cup of chocolate chips. Like many of the others, I reduced the brown sugar and cook exactly 18 min. and they are perfect every time. Today, the kids and I will put a dash extra cinnamon and cut up some apple rings. I expect to hear the same praise as every other time. Thank you so much for sharing!

These were ok. I have twins and my son ate it no problem, but my daughter didn't even want to try it. They got very hard the second day. So you have to eat them all the first day.

These are pretty good, kinda bland when made following the directions--maybe a little more salt.  I've played with the recipe and it works well with adding applesauce for half of the oil and they stay pretty soft.  I like them better in a 9 x 9 pan so they are a little thicker. Chocolate chips are good, salted nuts crushed up, craisens, dates are especially good with a little molasses. Kids like them pretty good and make a good breakfast on the run

I really enjoyed this recipe, but I make it with golden splenda and sugar free maple syrup instead of brown sugar and honey.  I found it impossible to buy granola bars that were sugar loaded, and this is the best adaptable recipe I've found so far.  I also use dried strawberries and blueberries instead of raisins, which I hate.

I made a few adjustments to the ingredients - I eliminated the wheat germ altogether because I didn't have any, but instead used 1/2 cup of all purpose flour and 1/2 cup of wheat flour.  Also only used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup of honey, substituted canola oil for vegetable oil, and added some craisins and salted peanuts and it turned out very tasty, with a very good texture.  The addition of salted peanuts made for a good mix of salty/sweet. These are great for those who don't have time to eat breakfast, as they can be cut up and transported in baggies and eaten as snacks.  My oven is a little wacky, so I only cooked it for about 20 minutes and it turned out perfect.  Very good, tasty, and versatile recipe!!!

Good. Very quick and easy... I followed the recipe exactly, except that I followed others' advice to reduce sugar-good idea!
Only minor problem...I was worried that I would overcook them, so I actually undercooked them. Next time I will bake a little longer (22mins)

Great recipe..I did as others suggested and cut down on the brown sugar to 1/4 cup and I added cranberries (just personal preference) and a cup of dark chocolate chips.  Oh yea..I also substituted the flax seed meal since I didn't have wheat germ.  Oh my gosh--my husband and I loved these!  Thank you!

Very tasty. . .not too crunchy, not too chewy.  They're a good texture for my 2-year-old to eat.  As others suggested, I only used 1/2 cup brown sugar, and I went 50/50 on the flour (all-purpose/whole wheat).  Took a little less than 30 minutes in my oven.  I'll experiment more next time with more add-ins: nuts, craisins, etc.

I used blueberry applesauce instead of veggie oil, and added bits of chocolate and hazelnut instead of the raisins. They came out chewy and good, but not particularly amazing. They need to be cooked a lot longer with this substitution. I will keep playing around with the ingredients, as this is a great alternative to the store-bought ones.

This was too soft almost rubber like. Something about the texture just wasn't good. I did read the reviews beforehand and made some substitutions that others suggested. Such as reducing the sugar to 1/2c, using applesauce instead of oil, and using flax seed. I think I made too many changes that altered the taste and texture.

These are fantastic!  I made them for a recent playgroup because there's a couple of children with peanut allergies and we can't serve regular granola bars to them.  HUGE HIT!  They are easily jazzed up  with different flavors - I made dried blueberry and ginger, and my 3 year old would've eaten half the pan by himself.

These were VERY good.  The only reason I didn't give them a 5 is because they do get rather hard to chew after a day, but are still very tasty.  We break them up and put them in plain yogurt and it softens up and makes for a yummy snack.  We used Craisins instead of raisins, too. YUM!

Great snack! My father put it best with: it's moist yet dry at the same time." Either way, they were a hit while ice fishing. I followed another cook's idea of replacing the oil with a cup of applesauce, but I think I'll cut that back next time. The applesauce somewhat overpowered the bar. I also added dried apricots, and I think I might incorporate sunflower seeds next time for a crunch.

These bars are the most incredible breakfast bar I've ever made - and are extremely versitile. Variations I make use candied orange peel or ginger, dried blueberries, chopped dates, and wolfberries. I use whole wheat or spelt flour. Creamed honey makes the bars ultra-smooth. Throw in a handfull of a healthy O's cereal (eg. Heritage O's in the organic grocery isle) to add a nice crunch and texture.

Taste great right out of the oven (think cake like), but the next morning were too hard to eat for my toddler to bite into.

I have used the recipe several times.  We love it.  I use milled flax seed instead of wheat germ and different combinations of dried fruit.  I have shared this recipe with co-worker and family. I used applesauce once - not as good.

These are a perfect afternoon snack and easy for the kids to help make.  And as an added bonus, MY hands don't get messy!  I have added some crushed peanuts at my son's request but other than that.. a great recipe just the way it is.

These were good, but mine fell apart.  So...I didn't get bar, just (yummy) crumbles.  Also, I used trail mix instead of rasins.

This is now one of our favorite snacks.  Friends always love it too.  I often add 1/2 cup ground flax for extra nutrition and the taste remains just as good. thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful base recipe!  You can substitute or add most anything.  I used choc. chips and pecans instead of raisins, whole wheat flour instead of white, and added flax seeds.  I also did one with dried banana chips crushed up and walnuts and added 1/2 tsp. banana candy flavoring oil and they taste like banana bread!

These were very good and easy to make.  They are fairly sweet and chewy.  My 20-month-old loves them.  I substituted craisins for raisins, only because I didn't have raisins on hand.

This was my first time making homemade granola bars and they were so good! I used whole wheat flour, added cocounts, craisins and golden raisins and they turned out great. Very hearty and filling.

These are great. My son cannot take store-bought granola bars for snack time at his peanut-free preschool. So, this recipe is great for us - it is completely flexible. I omitted the wheat germ and raisins and added coconut, chocolate chips, sunflower seeds, cranberries and chopped dried apricots. Yum!

I love this recipe!! I signed up just so I could review it.  I use all whole wheat flour and there is no difference in taste, I usually add cherry flavored cranberries and almonds and sometimes add grated orange peel. So yummy and nutritious.
