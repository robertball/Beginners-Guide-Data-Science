Excellent recipe.  I only made one change based on other reviews.  I used 8oz cream cheese and 7 oz of marshmallow fluff for the topping....it was amazing.  I baked the cookie on a pizza stone until it was golden brown all over (about 20 minutes).  I topped it with the icing and cooled in the fridge until 2 hours before the party.  I then topped with fruit and the orange drizzle and cooled for an additional 2 hours.  Next time, I would make this the night before and cool it in the fridge, as it was much better the next day.  The cookie got very moist and the flavors blended well.  I would also use more strawberries and other "firm" fruit such as grapes, blue berries etc.. and stay away from things such as bananas and canned oranges.  Great recipe.....thanks!

This is the best fruit pizza!  I had a friend in college who made fruit pizza with a glaze on top and could never find a recipe similar until now.  I made this for a pot luck breakfast and followed all directions.  It turned out great.  I even made it the night ahead and refrigerated all night.  No soggy crust!  Don't skip the glaze, though.  It makes this pizza stand out from all others.  I may double it next time, because I didn't have enought to cover the entire pizza.  The taste makes the long preparation time definately worth it!  Update:  I made this a 2nd time in a 9x13 baking dish.  It turned out just the same and was very easy to store in the fridge.

Wonderful recipe! I don't bother making the glaze, although I'm sure it's delicious. I simply melt some apple jelly in the microwave and after cooling it a bit, I brush it on the fruit. It makes all the fruit shiny and pretty. Update: After making this for years now, I have a couple of new hints. When I take this to a special BBQ or Party, and I want it to look perfect, I wash and prepare the fruit the night before. After washing the fruit I let it drain and dry overnight on paper towel lined cookies sheets, covering of course. I also bake the cookie base on a disposable foil pizza pan the night before, cover and store it at room temperature. Early the next morning I make the cream cheese layer, spread it on the cookie. I use a pizza cutter or sharp knife and cut it into wedges. I then add the fruit, brush with the melted jelly and carry it in a pizza box to the party. It never fails to impress and everyone loves it. Thanks Kay for the great recipe!

This is a show stopping dessert. Once the first piece was cut, it went in a flash. I used the mixture of 8 oz cream cheese and 7 oz jar of marshmallow cream as others did. The glaze not only adds flavor, it gives it the finishing touch that you would expect if you purchased this from a gourmet shop. I baked the dough about 15 minutes, and will increase that the next time. The crust softens up once the cream and fruit sit on it for a while - so I think it might be better to over bake it a little. I love this dessert, and so does my office!

I have made this a few times, all without the glaze.  The last time I made it, I doubled the recipe to make one big probably about 16" pizza and it still came out great.  I made the whole thing, fruit included and froze it overnight.  It kept very well and started defrosting on my way to a function.  It also kept longer sitting out since it started out so cold.  I'm sure with the glaze is great too, but I just haven't needed it.  Without the glaze, the sweetness is just right if you don't like things really sweet.  The sugar cookie balances out the cream cheese/cool whip mixture.  This is a great recipe if you're sick of making salads to bring to bbq's...it really makes a great impression.  I usually use blueberries, strawberries and kiwi.  I have also used pineapple on occasion.  Just be careful...it's addicting!

Ok, I whipped my topping so it made it super thick, but I wanted the lumps out!  That's ok, because it was so good!  And I like this topping better than my personal recipe because the fruit doesn't slide off!  Wasn't too crazy about the orange sauce, you can just use orange juice concentrate instead - plus its easier.  Great recipe though! :)  -- Oh, if you buy the sugar cookie dough, slice them like you were going to make the cookies and then use wax paper to smoosh it down into your pan

The mixture of the Cool Whip and cream cheese was a little bland, so I added about 3/4C of sifted powdered sugar.  This made the sauce a little thicker, and tasted sweeter.  Great recipe!

I really liked this recipe.  I've tried other versions, but the glaze was the difference in this one - very tasty!  I didn't give it to my kids because they like fruit plain and wouldn't have tried it, but everyone else at my July 4 cook out thought it was wonderful.

This was a great dessert! My husband insists on having it for Easter dessert. It was very pretty too! A great dessert to make for guests. It looks impressive! The kids weren't crazy about it though (ages 4 and 8) but they are picky eaters anyway. I have already passed the recipe around to friends and family. Thank you!

SO delicious. 

We added a thin layer of melted dark chocolate under the cream cheese layer, which I think took the dessert to an amazing level of goodness! The chocolate and orange complimented each other beautifully and the chocolate helped keep the sugar cookie from getting too soft. 

I baked this in a large springform pan and it the cookie formed a "rim" so it looked like a beautiful bakery tart (tasted like one too). A wonderful recipe!

This was a big hit at a bridal shower that I hosted. I doubled the recipe; however, I used a few ounces less whipped cream than it calls for and added a few ounces of marshmellow cream instead. I didn't want to substitute all of it for the marshmellow cream as some reviews said it was too sweet. I just added a little to make it more flavorful. It was great! I do recommend (like some of the reviews said) to over bake the cookie crust just a little. After the crust sits with the toppings on it, it softens up quite a bit. If it's underbaked, it will get pretty soggy.

I modified this recipe quite a bit, I whipped up 1 cup of fresh cream instead of the cool whip along with 1/2 cup of sugar and the cream cheese for my "spread".  I glazed the fruit with melted apricot jam and this was seriously one of the best deserts I've had in a long time!  SO good!

Everyone LOVED this recipe.  For the cream cheese mixture, I, too, used a 7 oz jar of marshmallow fluff, an 8oz package of cream cheese and a tablespoon of vanilla.  AMAZING!  I used Grapes, Strawberries, Kiwis, Blueberries, and Blackberries and the combination was perfect.  I baked the cookie crust the night before and stored covered on the counter-top and it was a perfect consistency. The glaze was yummy and made the fruit sparkle!  It lasted no more than 10 minutes.

I can't believe I wasn't able to mess this up!  What a great recipe!  I did everything exactly as the recipe said, and it came out perfect, and beautiful, i might add!  The fruit I used was strawberries, kiwi, bananas, blueberries and after I put on the orange drizzle, I sprinkled a little coconut, just to play up the pizza theme by making it look like cheese.

I made this gluten free by making an almond flour shortbread cookie (1/2 c. butter, 5 tbsp agave nectar, 2 1/2 c. almond flour, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp baking soda, bake at 325 for 10 mins) and using gluten free flour in the glaze.

This dessert is just the best!  It was very easy and so impressive.  I will be making this a lot.  The picture I posted is one I submitted before adding the glaze.  As you can see, I used strawberries (halved), sliced kiwi, well drained canned mandrin orange slices, and sliced banana that I dipped in lemon juice. I also added about 1/2 cup powdered sugar to the cream cheese and whipped topping mixture.  Everyone was sooo impressed....said it looked like it came from a bakery.  Oh, by the way I took another reviewer's advice and doubled the glaze.....it's really NOT necessary.  I had way too much.  The original glaze recipe works just fine.

Man, did I mess this up - maybe you can learn from my mistakes. First, make this on a 12 inch pan and don't line it with foil. Second make sure the cookie dough is built up a bit and not too thin or the whole thing falls apart. Third, this takes at least 3 cups of fruit and maybe 4. Fourth, only drizzle the glaze and don't use it all or the whole thing will be swimming and it doesn't completely set up - just thickens a little. Oh and I tried both the whip cream/cream cheese combo and the marshmallow/cream cheese combo. They were both good but the marshmallow one stayed nicer on the pizza. In the end, my pizzas looked nice and tasted good but were terrible messes to eat. :)

Wow!  Tip -- don't skip the sauce.  The sauce takes this from good to awesome.  I will lower the amount of Cool Whip next time to really bring out the cream cheese flavor.  That part kind of got lost in all the Cool Whip. I recommend tasting this as you go so you can stop when you reach the consistency & flavor that you want.

I gave this 4 stars because i thought the crust was dry and not all that great, but the cream cheese topping is fantastic. So the second, and third and fourth :) time I made this I got tons of people asking for the recipe, and here is what I did differantly. For the sugar cookie crust I used the recipe on this site called " the best rolled sugar cookies" (they really are the best bytheway).  That made a nice chewy cookie crust, then instead of using cool whip, I tried it with dream whip. WOW!  Soooo good. Everyone should try it this way. I promise lots of compliments.

This was a big hit at the party I took it to. I changed it slightly to give it some zing and a July 4th feel.  I used two 16.5 oz tubes of sugar cookie dough as the base and rolled/worked them into the shape of my jelly roll pan.  I doubled the cream cheese (I used Neufchatel) but not the 7 oz marshmallow cream which I substituted for the whipped cream.  I added about 1.5 teaspoons of orange extract to the cream cheese mixture.  I alternated rows of strawberries and blueberries and sprinkled them with the zest of one navel orange and one lemon and approximately 1 teaspoon of ground ginger.  I doubled the fruit glaze because another reviewer said she thought she could have used moreso I increased the size but found I had way too much and ended up pitching half of it so next time I’ll just make the regular batch.

If you're looking for an easy, beautiful, cool, delicious dessert, look no further than this gorgeous fruit pizza! I used strawberries, kiwi, well-drained mandarin orange segments, and fresh blueberries. There was more glaze than I needed, and next time I'll reduce the water so the glaze will be a bit thicker. 

The cookie crust is the only reason I gave this 4* instead of 5*. I'm not a big fan of store-bought cookie dough. I can see how a homemade sugar-cookie crust would taste so much better. If you decide to use a pizza stone, don't bring the crust to the edge or it will expand and spill over during baking. Leave 2" to 3" for the dough to expand as it bakes. 

Thanks for a great recipe!

I loved the glaze in this recipe and was surprised at how easy and quickly everything came together. The first crust I made oozed over the edge in the oven and I didn't loosen it right away which was a problem.  The second time I made the crust in a pan with sides and also used parchment paper on the bottom and up the sides so I could lift in out to cool and then serve on a flat tray.  This worked perfectly and made for such a pretty presentation.  This is a new favorite!

I forwarded this recipe to my sister, but asked her to make individual sugar cookie fruit pizzas for my daughter's baby shower. She followed irections exactly, cuttng the cookie dough with a scalloped cutter & piling the whipped cream/cream cheese mixture in the center to form a fluffy cloud on which to place the fruit she'd cut into a large dice (she used kiwi, strawberries & mandarin oranges). She also used the sauce recipe as written. I must say with all the wonderful finger foods we offered these were the absolute hit of the baby shower! Not the raspberry filled vanilla cupcakes or the candied apples, white chocolate popcorn, bacon wrapped dates, filet mignon w/ cheese fondue - those were all well received but these mini fruit pizzas were #!1 by a landslide!

This easily fed 8 people.  I made mine into a rectangle 13 x 9 baking pan.  It was easier to transport and functioned as a nice birthday cake.  I used 2 sugar cookie dough rolls and pressed them into the pan.  It took 20 mins to turn light brown.  I refridgerated the iced cookie overnight and put the fruit & glaze on the next day - then put it in the fridge for 2 hours.  My 4 year old enjoyed decorating this cake.  We used 5 kiwi, small package of strawberries, and blue berries.  We all had seconds.

This was a great dessert.  I took it to a dinner club I have with my girlfriends once a month and they all loved it.  I added about a cup of powdered sugar to the cream cheese/Cool Whip mixture to sweeten it up.  I also bought the break and bake sugar cookies as those were easier to spread than the full roll.  I only used about 3/4 of the cream cheese mixture and I probably could have gotten away with only using 1/2 of it because it was still pretty thick.  I also only used about 1/4 of the sauce drizzled across the top because the recipe makes quite a bit.  But overall, it was very easy to make and was a huge hit with everyone.  A great summer recipe!

A lot of the reviews say that they alter the cream cheese frosting, but don't if you put the orange sauce on top-it would be tooooo sweet. This is a great treat!

This recipe would've turned out really good except for the fact that I under cooked the crust.  My oven is older and tends to run a little hotter than it should so when it said 10-12 minutes to bake the crust I took it out after 10. It looked golden brown on the edges and I didn't want to over cook it (no one likes a hard cookie).  I let it cool and then put on the creamcheese spread and then the fruit, and the glaze and refridgerated it.  When i went to serve it, the crust was stuck to the pan (even though I had sprayed it with cooking spray). As I got further in the the center of the pizza the crust was doughy.  It's not like I could pop it back into the oven to make it a little more done so I ended up throwing the whole thing away.  What a waste of time/$. I was so disappointed, especially because I'd been craving it for 2 days (I'm pregnant). Next time I will use shortening to greast the pan and cook it for at least 12 minutes and check the center to make sure the crust is done before I go adding the toppings.

This dessert is so easy, I feel bad that people are amazed when they eat it!  I don't have a round pizza pan so I just used a small rectangular cookie sheet with sides (jelly roll pan). Fresh fruit is the best, but in the winter it can get pricey, so I get canned pineapple, mandarin oranges, frozen blueberries, and a few fresh kiwi and strawberries.  BEST DESSERT EVER!

Made this fruit pizza for our Sunday School class for breakfast.  It was a big hit with everyone!  Very easy to make the night before, refrigerate overnight, and ready to go in the morning. I was a little skeptical of the glaze on top, but it really made a difference, very yummy!

**HUGE hit with adults and kids**  Greased a pizza pan with butter (didn't have any PAM on hand) and rolled out 1.75 rolls of sugar cookie dough.  Followed the suggestions of others and combined 8 oz. cream cheese, approximately 3/4 container of Cool Whip, and about 1.5 cups marshmallow fluff to make the spread.  Used strawberries, blueberries, and kiwis as topping.    Super easy.  WAY TASTY.  Everyone wanted the recipe!  Will certainly make again.

So good...takes some time to slice the fruit and assemble it, but it's definitely worth it. The glaze makes it.

I made my own homemade sugar cookie dough and pressed it into the bottom of the pan (it's a much better taste and better for you).  I followed other reviews and used cream cheese and a 7 oz. container of marshmallow fluff.  My suggestion for the glaze is to use a basting brush and paint it on rather than pouring it on out of the saucepan or with a spoon.  That way, you'll get a more even coated glaze rather than having it pool up in the open spaces between the fruit.  Definitely don't skip the glaze though, I received compliments from everyone saying it was a step above of any other fruit pizza they had had!

This was great.  It came out so pretty and was so easy.  I caught my Dad taking pictures of it.  I used fluff with the cream cheese and it was great.  I thought the sugar cookie crust was a little too sweet.  Next time, I will try a choc chip crust or perhaps a shortbread.  I used strawberries, blueberries, and kiwis.  The glaze makes it look pretty.  My only complaint is that the oj gives it a little color.  It looks a bit cloudy if too much collects in a section so be very gradual.  Again, the cloudy color caused my husband to state it looked like mucous.  I will try to look for another glaze recipe that is clear.  Don't get me wrong.  The glaze tastes great and looks good as long as you are careful.  I think you will see what I mean if you look thru all the pictures.  GREAT recipe.

I wanted a less-sweet version, so I baked a ready-made pie crust sprinkled with a little sugar - then spread the filling into the crust, following the shape of the crust. I placed sliced apricots all around the outer edge, then a little stack of blueberries held into place by two rows of sliced strawberries standing on end. I filled the center with the blackberries. Then, I put a ring of raspberries around the edge between the blueberries and the apricots. After glazing, I added a large dollop of whipped topping in the center.   The combination of the fresh fruit, the sweet glaze, the cream cheese filling, and the crisp pie crust turned out to be fabulous! This is the perfect summer dessert recipe!

I must say, this recipe is phenomenal!  I just got home from a staff bbq/potluck.  This fruit pizza got rave reviews from little old ladies, children, police officers and the police chief!    Instead of one big pizza, I made "mini" pizzas by just forming the dough into cookie-sized pizzas.  Next time, I will definitely over-bake the dough, because it was too soft.  Other than that, FANTASTIC!

This recipe was very easy and helpful! My fruit pizza was the biggest hit at the office! i highly recommend it. Use berries instead of the softer fruits, they look and hold up better. I used strawberries, kiwi, raspberries and blueberries but really any fruit works, so what ever you like best! The cream cheese/whipped cream topping was amazing. I found it to be pretty sweet even without the sugar so I only added a little bit! This will be a HIT!

AMAZING!!! This is honestly my new favorite food - I made this for a dinner we had with another couple and the 4 of us ate all but one piece. Which I finished off for breakfast the next day and immediately made a whole new fruit pizza.
I baked my cookie on a pizza stone as well - about 15 mins. on 350. I also mixed a few teaspoons of powerdered sugar and about a teaspoon of vanilla to the glaze. Don't skip the glaze - it's the best part!
I used strawberries, kiwi, and blueberries.

Fantastic recipe! I put only strawberries on top because I am picky about fruit and I doubled the recipe and baked it in a jelly roll pan. I also made the topping with cream cheese and marshmellow creme, a sprinke of vanilla and powdered sugar. I highly recommend this simple and delicious treat. All of my husbands freind's were raving about this at his UFC party tonight.

Very tasty and very easy to put together.  I took the suggestion of another user and added vanilla and powdered sugar to the cream cheese mixture; it turned out great.  I did not make the glaze this time but I probably will try it eventually.

This was excellent! I did not have to make modifications as far as ingredients go, but I did learn a few things: I used a springform pan to bake this....I would suggest halving the recipe if you are going to do this.  I had way too much fruit and cool whip mixture leftover (which made for a really good fruit salad!).  With the springform, there was way too much cookie crust which almost over powered the fruit. 
Overall, this was wonderful! I would up the prep time, though! It took close to an hour to prepare! GREAT recipe, thanks!

I took this to a party a few weeks ago and it was gone in about 10 mins. the glaze was great and really made the dessert. i changed the frosting up a bit. I used 2 packages of cream cheese and used marshmellow fluff instead of cool whip. I had to transport it about an hour and if it got warm the cool whip would get real runny. In my opinion it came out better with the fluff and everyone raved about it. for fruit i used strawberries, blueberries, kiwi, peaches, cantaloupe, and raspberries. it ended up turning out really pretty.

This recipe was terrific. Of all the similar recipes posted, this one looked the best to me. 

It was easy to make, just took some time, as most desserts worth serving to guests do! 
I followed the directions exactly, no changes, and it was a huge hit! 
I've posted pictures of my results, I think there's a link at the bottom of the recipe page to view them.

I haven't made fruit pizza in years so I followed this recipe and it was very good, just as I remembered. I didn't use the glaze, I always melted Orange Marmalade in the microwave a few seconds till it was melted then drizzle it over the fruit. Really delicious. You can use any jam of your choice.

This is absolutely FABULOUS!! It was a huge hit at the party. The only thing that I did different was I  made it the day before because other reviewers said it was better. It was perfect and not soggy. I will definantly make this again! Thanks for sharing!

I used to make this when my children were at home, back in the 1980's.  It was always a hit.  I added two TBSP of sugar to the cream cheese and used the lower fat type.  Also added a ring of Kiwis, bananas, pineapple to the mandarin oranges and strawberries.  This was a hit with young and old alike.

The sauce overpowered the fresh flavors of the fruit and made it way too sweet.  Great without the sauce!

I made this for Easter 2011.  Read many of the helpful reviews--swapped the whipped topping for marshmallow fluff (although I am sure either would be great, the fluff just seemed like it would travel better).  I cooked the crust a little longer and made the night before...it did not travel as well as I hoped and got pretty soggy after sitting on the buffet for a couple of hours, so keep cold!  Was VERY easy and delicious even soggy though.  Next time I will keep cold and may melt a little almond bark to create a layer over the crust and hopefully keep it a little more firm.

Everything was great - except for the glaze.  My family didn't care for the glaze.  Will definitely make again though - without the glaze.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is very good. Except I have my version. Instead of sugar cookie dough I mix up a red velvet cake mix, 1/3 c oil,1 egg,and a tablesppon of water to make it a cookie dough consistency. Spread that into a pizza pan and bake it till done. Also on top of the cream cheese mixture I spread strawberry glaze you can find in the produce dept of your store. Top with fruits of choice then I also sprinkle with a little coconut for the "cheese" on the pizza!

With a couple of modifications, this is a five-star recipe. Since I often find recipes to be too sweet, I used 10 ounces of whipped cream cheese mixed with 1 teaspoon of vanilla, and omitted the glaze topping. The cookie base and fruit provided just the right amount of sweetness, and everyone loved it! It was gobbled up in no time!

Fabulous!  I didn't have a pizza pan, so I made this in 2 9" round cake pans - gave one to my neighbor and took one to a 4th of July party.  Used strawberries, kiwi, blueberries and mandarin oranges.  Everyone loved it.  My only complaint is that the next day the bottom crust was soggy (although it still tasted yummy!).

Made this for a Christmas party.  I would take the recommendation next time and use the fluff with the cream cheese.  LOVE the glaze for the top.

Instead of making one huge pizza, I used this recipe to make mini-pizzas.  Just use teh sugar cookie dough to make cookies and top each one individually.  A little more work, but less messy to serve and easier to eat.  I love the sauce.  Used strawberries, blueberries, red and black raspberries, pineapple.  Skip bananas... too smooshy.

I wanted to make individual fruit pizzas for a book club I was sponsoring.  A local bakery makes some that look more like cookie tarts which I like.  All I did was spray a cup cupcake pan with non-stick spray.  Took slices of the cookie dough rolled it into a ball and than took a tart presser and made an indent into the dough spreading the dough out and giving a well in the dough to put the frosting and the fruit.  (You could use the bottom of a wide handled utensil)  The only thing I regret was not making my own cookie dough the store bought cookie was a little salty for the taste combination I was wanting.  They looked fun and unique on the serving tray, and I received some nice compliments.

This recipe is the BEST! I thought it came out great, as stated exactly in the recipe.  The glaze on top is to die for! Always gets great reviews from others, and I get many requests to bring it to events.  I always enjoy making different patterns with the fruit.  It always looks so pretty.  Thank you! THANK YOU!

What a great recipe! Once you cut up all the fruit, it's fun to arrange it in your own creative way.  Followed others' tips and added vanilla plus powdered sugar to the cream cheese/whipped topping mixture.  It did come out a bit lumpy, even after mixing it on high for a few minutes.  A great office treat!

Nothing but compliments  I brought it to my in-laws house for a dessert on Easter.  They loved it, it didn't last long at all.  I did as others suggested and added vanilla and powdered sugar to the cool whip/cream cheese mixture. Looked great and tasted wonderful

This was the best! I made this for our BBQ and everyone gobbled it up. My sister said it was the best dessert I've ever made and I'm not sure if that's good or bad since I've been baking for years :-) She kept saying how pretty it looked and has volunteered me to make it for every holiday! I did go with the suggestion to use marshmallow creme and I loved it. I put some powdered sugar in the cream cheese mixture and I shouldn't have done that because the glaze is pretty sweet. Next time I will add a little more corn starch to thicken the glaze but people were right about the glaze, it totally made the dessert. If you use a baking stone make sure to loosen the cookie from the stone with a knife while it is still a bit warm otherwise it will stick. If you spoon on too much glaze it will spill over to the cookie crust and get soggy.

This was fantastic!  I made it for dinner guests and they loved it.  We all decided, though, that I should have put more fruit on top - be sure to really pile it on.  I also added a jar of marshmallow cream to the cream cheese/coolwhip mixture - otherwise it tasted to cream cheesy for me - and I really like cream cheese!  I could have also just added some powdered sugar to sweeten it up.  I will definitely make this again using a lot more fruit!

OHMyGOD!  Is this yummy, or what?  I used Tofutti "cream cheese" and it is was wonderful, but I bet real cream cheese would be great too.  The glaze did not thicken until I added another T. of corn starch, and then it caused the whipped cream topping to curdle a bit, but the taste was out of this world.  I think I could have eaten the whole pizza, and I will definately make this again.  I used two rings of strawberries, a center of three star fruit slices, and sprinkled with a heavy hand of blueberries and served it for our 4th of July dessert!  WOW!

It is amazing how easy it is to makes something so beautiful and delicious.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe.  I used all the fruits in the picture, except for bananas.  The only change I will make to this recipe the next time is to make two pizzas, instead of one giant one.  Even though I greased the pizza stone, the dough stuck.  I think I spread it too thin though.  I'll get it right.  It is truly a delicious work of art.  I made this recipe for my boyfriend's birthday and  he loved it.

Love this recipe!  TIP  to keep the dough from getting soggy I place the cut strawberries and other cut fruit on some paper towels to absorb some of the extra juice before placing it on the baked crust, really makes a difference!

I made this for a July 4th party and decorated it like a flag with blueberries, strawberries and raspberries....it worked well in a 13 x 9 inch pan.  I did overbake the cookie slightly as suggested by others and it held up well throughout the party.  I adjusted the recipe by mixing the cream cheese, 4 oz of whipped topping and 4 oz of marshmallow fluff, with a tsp of vanilla and it was delicious!  The glaze sounds great, but short on time I simmered apricot glaze with water and juice of half a lemon..then strained it, let it cool and brushed it on the fruit.  I put it in the freezer for a couple hours prior to leaving to preserve it for longer during the party.  It was a delicious and beautiful dessert!  Thanks for the recipe!

The citrus glaze absolutely makes this dessert AMAZING! I used strawberries, bananas, kiwis, and raspberries.

This is really good, but I didn't use cookie dough-I used cressent rolls for the crust.--less caleries and much better for you. I also used beaten cream cheese and sugar  instead of whipped topping. Heaklthier for you

I made this for my brother's birthday as an alternative to cake. It was delicious...everyone loved it. I didn't have whipped topping, but I had marshmallow creme so I used that after reading another review. I thought the glaze tasted a bit too much like orange juice. I might cut back next time and put more lemon.

I have made several different versions of this recipe; homemade cookie dough, apple jelly glaze, etc...but this is by far the best of all.  I made this for a friend's birthday and everyone raved about how beautiful and delicious it was!  The glaze sets up perfectly, the cookie doesn't get soggy and the fruit doesn't bleed.  It's so easy with the packaged cookie dough and looks like you slaved for hours.  One suggestion would be if you use mandarin oranges, I let them drain some more on paper towels so they wouldn't be so wet on the cream cheese mixture...worked perfectly.  Everyone is requesting it again for Easter.

Yummo! I served this when I had a few guests over and they asked for the recipe, they loved it! It was so fun to make too, me and the kids had fun putting on the fruit. I used Anne's sugar cookie dough recipe from Fruit Pizza 1 from this site but I added a tsp of vanilla to the mixture (a cookie just isn't a cookie without vanilla extract). I also did half the white sugar in the recipe and substituted the other half with Stevia sweetener. I used lite cool whip and neufchatel 1/3 less fat cream cheese. We topped our pizza with blueberries, strawberries, banana, kiwi, and fresh Texas peaches. I did over brown the cookie just a tad to keep from getting soggy. The orange sauce definitely topped this off perfect! I'm gonna make it again for our church get togethers!

I made several modifications because I made this with my class of two year olds: left out the cream cheese and didn't use the orange syrupy drizzle.  My kids loved to watch me cook the crust and they helped spread the cool whip and cut the fruit. We used bananas, strawberries, and kiwis and chilled it for 4 hrs during nap time. This treat is light, not THAT bad for you, and so refreshingly sweet. I would like to try the recipe w/out adding modifications for myself one time since I can't imagine it is any better than it was the way we made it.

Doubled the recipe- made on a cookie sheet.  Used cream cheese and cool whip like suggested however I used a hand mixer to make a smoother texture.  Also brushed the glaze (only needed single batch of it) over the pizza at the end rather than spoon it so it didn't get too goopy!  HUGE FAN FAVORITE at our super bowl party!

I made mini pizzas using individual cookies and topped with what I could find cheap at the time (strawberries, blueberries and grapes). I skipped the topping. These went over great!

I never leave comments on the recipes but this recipe is truly AMAZING. My family and I decided to have a homemade pizza, salad, hot wing, and brownie sundae social and I decided to bring this fruit pizza to go along with the theme. Everyone loved it!!! It was gone by the end of the night!!! Next time I will be making two of these.  I did make one change. Instead of using the whipped topping I used 7.5 oz of marshmellow fluff.  It turned out beautiful.

This came out fairly well but I don't know if I'll make it again.  It was tasty but the glaze was kind of... unattractive.  Very opaque and gloopy.  I had a hard time getting an even layer as I was spooning it over. I might try it again and just skip the glaze.

absolutely delicious! I took this to a cookout and it was devoured. I was hesitant to use the orange glaze as I'm not a huge fan of orange flavor, but it really made the dish - so don't skip it.

Delicious! I changed the crust and filling to make a pie instead of a pizza, but the glaze and base filling recipe were AMAZING! Just make sure you thoroughly mix the whipped cream and cream cheese so there are no cream cheese chunks. Thanks for sharing, Kay!

This dessert was AMAZING! I made it exactly how the recipe calls for. I served it on Mother's Day and the entire thing was gone within minutes. Everyone was raving over the fact that it looked professional, and then couldnt get over how GOOD it was! DO NOT leave out the glaze, that was the absolute best part! I will definitely be making this again!

I made 80 servings of this for a wedding reception this weekend. They were very tasty and pretty! The only change I made was to use marshmallow fluff instead of whipped topping (hoping they would be less soggy and it did help) and I didn't have time to make the glaze but they were still excellent. I topped them with strawberries, kiwi, blueberries, raspberries, and pineapple.

This is my all time favorite food in the WHOLE WORLD! I follow others advice and freeze and slice before adding fruit. I also DOUBLE the recipe and make it on a 16 in. round pizza pan....MMMMM!!!  The glaze is a must and man is this good with giant blackberries, but bananas are my favorite, because it reminds me of banana cream pie. I have made it many many times and everyone always asks for the recipe.

I have been using an almost identical recipe for about 2 years.  There is a difference in the filling that I have to share.  It was whipping lemon or lime curd (was told it is a British item similiar to jelly, not sure about that) with the cream cheese and leaving out the whipped topping.  This gave the filling a smoother, tart flavor and the pizza even better flavor than it already has.  I added approx 6 ounces, as my family likes slightly tart treats.  Raspberries and blackberries also are a wonderful flavor addition.

Delicious and very easy. I made it for fourth of July. So I used strawberries and blueberries to make a flag. I didn't use the glaze because I didn't think those fruits needed it. I will definetly make it again. It was GREAT!!! My husband loved it.

All of these fruit pizza recipes are pretty much the same sugar cookie crust, cream chese base (I prefer with marshmallow fluff), and fruit on top. What makes this one a show stopper is the orange glaze. For the reviews that said it is no different than orange concentrate, they didn't follow the recipe properly. The glaze is almost like a marmalade and compliments the dessert perfectly.   The glaze makes this pizza taste as good as it looks.

What a fun and crowd pleasing recipe.  My children LOVE to help make this one. Not only is it fun to look at, it tastes GREAT! You cannot go wrong.  There are many versions out there, but this one is our favorite.  The orange glaze sauce gives this fruit tart a professional look.

We all enjoyed this beautiful dessert. It was very simple to make. For the crust I used a sugar cookie recipe I had on file and baked it in a springform pan. Fresh strawberries, kiwi, and pineapple were used to top the cream cheese/whipped cream mixture. The glaze complimented all of the flavors so perfectly. This is such an impressive looking dish. It would also be perfect to serve dinner guests. Thanks for sharing this recipe; I will definitely be making it again.

Great recipe!  I added two cups of whipped topping and two teaspoons of vanilla to the cream cheese. The glaze makes this recipe - yummy!

Brandi, gorgeous picture! Fay, thanks for posting! I have been making this for years and I can tell you that it is absolutely wonderful. A couple of observations, I make the glaze when I am going to be serving this to adults, I omit when it is just for around the house and the kids. Reason being, I think the glaze is a bit more "adult" AND I know the entire pizza will be eaten if I am taking it somewhere. If I am just making it for the 4 of us, it will take a couple of days for us to finish it off and the glaze makes it soggy. I vary the fruit and, when I am feeling guilty, use reduced or no fat cream cheese and whipped topping. I have been known to make this in a rectangular form also, tastes just as great and is a little easier to have a smaller slice (goes further), more manageable size (think small dessert plate). Enjoy!

This takes a little time but, very well worth it.  Fabulous presentation. My kids (4) eat the whole fruit pizza in one day, my husband & I had to be quick to get our tastes in!!

This was really good.  Made this for my in-laws, and they just really loved it.  The kids will love it too and a good way for them to eat fresh fruits, if they don't usually.

I added additional glaze to the pizza so the entire top was covered with a thin layer.  Just make an additional glaze as directed - I only needed 1/2 of it.

I used basic cookie recipe and no whipped topping.  The glaze was orange marmalade with tablespoon of water.

About 15 years ago I heard the phrase"fruit pizza" and thought hmmm...did not have a recipe so I created my own...I made it with a graham cracker crust and instead of the whipped topping I used vanilla yogurt to make the cream cheese into a spreadable consistency and powdered sugar instead of granulated to sweeten it a bit...use whatever fruit strikes your fancy and used heated apricot marmalade to coat the fruit...no matter how you make it...the taste and "wow factor" are great...

I gave the recipe 3 stars because my crust came out soggy.  Be sure to bake it longer and test it before you go forward.  Also the recipe states that this recipe can be made in 30 minutes, but it needs longer to cook the dough, to cool and set for 2 hours.  It's more like a three hour recipe.

This is one of my favorite desserts to make. The first time I made it I made it like a pizza and it was very good. Then I started making individual pizzas (just cookie size). This works out great because it's easier to eat and you can "personalize" them. You can make some without strawberries (for those that can't have seeds) or just specific fruits. I let the kids help and they love it. You definitely need the glaze. That makes the pizzas! Enjoy!!

I love this recipe and I make it regularly. I make a couple changes, however. For the whipped topping, I substitute 2 8ounce packages of cream cheese and 1 large container of marshmallow fluff (I think it's 7oz). I only use strawberries and blueberries, with the blueberry, cookie, topping combination being the best part for me. The glaze is a must. Yes, it is sweet, but it's nice and tangy too. I can make this is no time. I prepare the dough and get that in the oven, and then start on everything else. By the time the cookie is baked and cooled for 10 mins, I can assemble the whole thing. Lovely. I took it to a work potluck and it was devoured in no time! I even received an email stating that it was the best thing on the table! So it is def a hit!

Have made many fruit pizzas, and this is the best.  Loved the glaze.  I was 1 T short on lemon juice (I doubled the recipe) and it was still great. I pulled my cookie crust out at 12 minutes and didn't think it was done.  Turned the oven back on and stuck it back in about another 5, and it was perfect.  Chewy and delicious! I used blueberries, strawberries, kiwi, grapes, and nectarines. With doubling the glaze recipe, I had left overs, so saving that for something else.

I made this exactly as the recipe said to and it was delicious.  I used strawberries, blueberries, grapes, and raspberries on mine.  I can't stop eating it and even my 6 yr. old daughter loves it.  She even enjoyed the glaze on top and at first she didn't think she would.

So easy and soooo good!  I made it exactly as written, and it was delicious.  The frosting is not very sweet, but the sauce is what made this dish over-the-top good!  Don't skip it! I made individual sized pizzas by using round sugar cookies, and they were a huge hit and easy to make.  Definitely a summer must-have dessert!

Great recipe. I've made this numerous times with some modifications which I think make for a stellar dessert.  I used sugar cookie mix from a bag, just as a preference. To the cream mix I add a splash of vanilla, almond extract, tsp of cinnamon, and probably 1/2c of white sugar. Canned peaches and any other fruit works fabulously.
Try this, you'll love it!!

Gone in 60 seconds! Didn't have any of the whipped cream, cornstarch, OJ, LJ or Orange zest so I...

Mixed 1/3 less fat Cream cheese wiith 1/2 cup of sugar. Then I added the fruit right before serving. Worked perfectly!

This is the BEST Fruit Pizza recipe! I've been using it for about five years now. The cream cheese/cool whip topping is the best combination and the glaze is soooooo versatile. Today I only had pineapple and lemon juice on hand so I used that and it was fabulous! My brother asks for this at his birthday celebration weekend EVERY year! Thanks for sharing your recipe, Kay! FABULOSO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I received many compliments on this dessert.  However, I should have baked the cookie crust even longer than I did.  I would have preferred a crunchier crust.  I used 7 oz of fluff mixed with the cream cheese as someone else suggested...great!  I used dry orange peel since I didn't have fresh oranges on hand.  The glaze was still perfect.

Took this to Administrative Professionals Day at work for all the hard working women in my office and they LOVED it!  Many commented on the orange glaze - I had made fruit pizza many times in the past without the glaze, but they really seem to love it, so I am keeping this one in my recipe box.

I used marshmallow cream instead of the whipped cream which I will do again.  The glaze really makes this pizza.  I would lightly brush it on right right before serving as it made the cookies kind of soggy after they sat for a day.  I liked them as individual cookie pizzas rather than 1 big pizza.

I use the orange glaze part of this recipe for all kinds of things. Just fantastic when making anything with fresh fruits.  Adjust cornstarch to adjust thickness of glaze.

I haven't made this yet but I did experience it at a home party the other evening.  It was fabulous!  Everyone there just raved over the presentation and it was so very yummy.  I took a slice home, refrigerated it, and ate it the next night.  I was just as wonderful.  YUMMY!  I will be making this for a baby shower soon.

This takes a little time, but it's worth the outcome!  I made this recipe exactly as written and it was perfect.  The citrus topping makes it extra special!  It was even better then next day, so now when I make this, I make it the day before I'm going to serve it.  A real crowd pleaser and it looks just beautiful!

This was good. I used strawberries, kiwi and mango. I would have liked blueberries but they were too expensive. It is a pretty and unique dessert but too much work to do on any regular basis.

This turned out wonderful. It was so easy to make. I agree with others that it is the glaze topping that makes this so much better than other fruit pizzas. I did not have any leftovers. Thanks

This is the best.  So many have asked for the recipe after trying it.  I now make 2 fruit pizzas when we take dessert, one just isn't enough.  I do add a little vanilla and powdered sugar to the cream cheese spread for a little more flavor.  Once you try this recipe, you will make it all the time.

I made and took this to my sister's house for dinner.  Everyone loved it.  The only ingredient I didn't use was orange zest, only because that was the only ingredient I didn't have on hand.  I used strawberries, mandarin oranges and kiwi.  Loved the bites i took with strawberries, liked them with the kiwi, didn't care for the mandarin orange.  Next time only strawberries will top this pizza.  I also made this in a disposable pan for easy cleanup.  Oh...and I used two packages of cookie dough, but will use only one next time because the crust was thicker and made this really sweet.  Thinner cooker and only strawberries next time!  Yummy!

I didn't even pour the sauce over it, and it was a hit at my party.  It disappeared quickly.  Will definitely make again.

Delicious! I made a day before and it was still great. Crust did not get soggy, although, I think it was because  I baked it around 15 minutes (entire cookie was light-medium brown). I made it in a Pyrex glass rectangular dish. When it came time to cut it the next day, the crust was a little hard, but soft enought to eat and enjoy. Just a little banging of the glass when cutting it :) Tasted delicious! and the crust was perfect.

Very good!  This is very sweet as is, so I wouldn't make any changes except to double to glaze because there wasn't enough for the entire pizza.

I tweaked this recipe a little. Did not try the suryp to put on. THis is what I did: Made the cookie crust, the cream cheese/cool whip mixture. Then I used crushed pineapple (drained), sliced bananas, milk chocolate shavings then topped it off with strawberry topping!!! It was so good!!!

Wow. Yummy. My 15 year old son said it is the "best thing I've ever had." I had to stop him from eating the whole thing! (know what he'll like on his birthday)   I used break apart sugar cookie dough (vs. sliced) and arranged the dough cubes into a Christmas tree (photo uploaded).  1 on top, next row 2, next row 3...etc bottom row 6 and the tree base was 3 dough cubes.  Arrange approx. 1/2" apart so they spread into each other.  

I took some advice on the frosting and did the cream cheese, cool whip, 1 tbs of fluff and 1 tbs powdered sugar. Yum.  After spreading the frosting, sprinkled it with green cake decoration sprinkles (sparkly). Green sprinkles contrasts white frosting nicely (vs. turning it all green with food coloring). Looks snowy.  

Spinkled the serving platter with powdered sugar for more 'snow' effect. 

Thanks for such a delicious recipe.

This pizza is great! I used Marshmallow creme instead of whipped cream. I let everyone put whatever fruit they wanted on their slice. It was a big hit! I give this recipe two thumbs up!

My husband made this for the family on Thanksgiving.  It turned out beautifully!  He used mandarin oranges, strawberries, blueberries, blackberries and raspberries for the fruit, but he used this recipe for the glaze and the cream cheese/whipped topping.

I cannot even tell you how many compliments I received on this dessert! I had several people wanting the recipe from me as well! This is a show-stopper and will really liven up the dessert table at your gathering. It is absolutely beautiful with the colors. I used the same fruits as in the picture, the kiwi, strawberries, mandarin oranges, and banana. 

TIP: make sure the oranges are drained and patted dry so you don't get a soggy cookie crust. 

I have made two of these fruit pizzas before. The other one was a different recipe and I will never use a different one that this! PERFECTO!

As others suggested, I added 3 Tbsp powdered sugar and 1 tsp vanilla to the cream cheese mixture, and used real whipped cream (lite) instead of the Cool Whip type.  Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. The Kiwi fruit made it a big hit, along with blueberries and strawberries.  GREAT!

Wow.  If I could give this more stars, I would.  Could not find refrigerated sugar cookie dough so found an easy recipe on this site for the dough.  Cracked Sugar Cookies 1.  Easy and worked divinely.  Probably added a little more than 8oz of whipped topping.  Added blueberries for color and ripe plums for a great selection of fruit.  Canned manderins I think are better than fresh.  They look prettier.  This was so much fun to decorate and tasted absolutely fantastic.  I really impressed myself as I am not a baker!!

This was an easy and tasty dessert!  I did use one jar of Marshmellow cream in replace of the whip cream and thought that was a much better way to go. I also did it in a 9 x 9 square baking dish which used less fruit but had a nice think crust!!  The glaze was awesome!!  Very yummy stuff!!

Turned out great.  I did have a ton of the cheese frosting left over because I didn't put a thick smear on.  Next time I will cut the cream cheese frosting in half.  Other than that, it was a great alternative to a birthday cake to my fruit loving daughter

My middle school aged daughter and I made this for school's celebration of pi day (March 14, everyone's favorite math-and-food celebration). We baked the crust the night before, then got up early to frost and decorate. This did not leave us time to let it chill, but the glaze did set somewhat. It was pretty. March 09: We are making it for the third PI day in a row! Although, I don't normally use "whipped topping", I have learned that this is a favorite with my daughter's classmates.

Yummy.  This was great; I used raspberries, black raspberries, blueberries, and strawberries.  The glaze really added a nice flavor.  I added a bit of powdered sugar to the cream cheese/whipped topping; I thought the cream cheese was overpowering otherwise... Will definitely make again!

Great recipe.  Huge hit. Already have 2 requests to make it again.  I followed all the directions except for I added 1/2 cup of strawberry marshmellow fluff to the cream cheese/whipped topping mixture.  Loved it!!!

I was looking for a fruit pizza recipe that included making the glaze as I remember my aunt doing, rather than using a marmalade.  This was right on target. The glaze was just right - not too sweet and not too tart. Loved it!

This was delicious I will Definetly make it again. I think that the sugar cookie made it a little to sweet. And the only thing that I changed was I used a strawberry cream cheese dip instead of cream cheese

Easy and very pretty.  I'm not great with cutting fruit to be uniform and pretty but it was very easy to do in this case.  The filling was easy and tasty and the glaze was tangy and simple.

I'll make it again.

I added about a half cup powdered sugar and about a teaspoon vanilla to the cream cheese and whipped topping, just wasn't sweet enough for me. The glaze is an awesome addition I can't imagine not using it. We almost ate the whole thing during the Super Bowl, which I recommend since the cookie is soggy the next day! I would have chosen five stars if I hadn't felt the need to add anything.

Try adding peach pie glaze or strawberry glaze to the cream cheese and cream whip for a little sweeter and colorful topping. Or you can put dabs of it on top of the filling then swirl it in for some interesting swirls of yum!

I made this for a baby shower today and it was a big hit.  Everyone commented on how pretty it was, then on how delicious it was.  It disappeared!  I might end up tweaking it some after reading other reviews, depending on what fruit is on hand or if I want to make it the day before, but this is a 5 star recipe just as it is.  One note - I tasted the cream cheese/cool whip mixture and it wasn't quite as sweet as I expected but that's a good thing...between the sweet sugar cookie and the sweet sauce/glaze, it plays perfectly! Will make again when I want to wow a crowd or show my family some extra love.

Love this recipe - people are always wowed by how pretty it looks.  Once it's cut, it disappears quickly!!   The only thing I do differently is that I make the sugar cookie dough from scratch.

I made the recipe as listed, and it was delicious! Everybody had seconds. You could easily make this early, even a day ahead, as the glaze keeps the fruit looking fresh. (I used strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and kiwis.) I baked on a pizza pan covered in wax paper, and the pieces came off nicely. I didn't transfer the whole thing, so not sure how that would work. I will definitely make this again!

Every time I've made this recipe people tell me how much they love it! I do what some other reviewers have said and bake the cookie til it's crispy because the frosting and fruit will make it the perfect softness/chewiness.

I mix in a small can of drained crushed pineapple with the cream cheese and whipped topping mixture.  No need for the glaze, it will be sweet enough.  Made it for the kids this weekend and used strawberries, blueberries, blackberries and raspberries...it was gone at the blink of an eye!

Amazing!  I do make my own sugar cookie crust, and I did as others and did the cream cheese and marshmello fluff, INCREDIBLE.  DO NOT leave out teh glaze, the glaze is absolutely delicious and really finishes off this fruit pizza beautifully.  The tastes compliment so well.  YUMMO!

Great dessert! Made it for Valentines Day and shaped the crust into a heart. Used chocolate chip cookie dough instead of sugar cookie dough because my husband doesnt like sugar cookies, baked it according to its directions.  And added 3/4 cup of powered sugar to the cream cheese and whipped topping,  like one of the reviewers suggested to add a bit more sweetness.

I found this as I was looking for recipes to use up a mix of fruit recieved in our CSA box and decided to try it since it seemed amenable to whatever fruits are on-hand. I used fresh strawberries, kiwi, tangerines and bananas. I was delicious! Four of us devoured it in a single sitting. I used a flat stone to bake the cookie crust and it overflowed. Next time, I would use half the package or use a pan with a bit of depth. There was plenty of the glaze and the cream mixture left over for a second pizza. This time we'll use tangerines and papaya for a tropical twist. Can't wait!

I only used this recipe for the glaze because I have a family favorite recipe for Strawberry Pizza that we've been making for years that uses a store bought glaze for strawberries. I just never really cared for the glaze.  In my opinion, it's too sweet, and the texture is just too thick.  I wanted to try the recipe with blackberries instead of strawberries and I wanted to make a glaze that would compliment the flavor of the berries so I gave this one a try.  I had to make a few changes based on what I had on hand, but it sure turned out delicious.  I only had pineapple/orange juice instead of orange juice.  I didn't have an orange to zest, so I used the zest of one very small lemon.  I admit the flavor of the blackberries were a little overwhelmed by the lemon flavor, but that was okay with me because I LOVE fresh lemon flavor.  This almost had the subtle taste of lemon cream pie.  What I loved most about this glaze as compared to the store bought stuff, is the thinner consistency.  This was just enough cornstarch to thicken the mixture up, but still let you drizzle it over the fruit.  At first I was worried that it would run off the edge of the crust, but it worked out perfectly.  I can't wait to try this again and experiment with different fruits and berry juices.  Thank you for this great recipe.

Glaze is WONDERFUL!  So good and I made it exact to the recipe!  Only change to entire thing I made is I added about 3/4 cup powdered sugar to the cream cheese mixture and went a little shy of the whole tub of Cool Whip.

I left off the sauce, it was sweet enough without it.  A real hit.

This recipe is a winner!  I used the advice of switching the coolwhip for marshmellow fluff.  It was delish!  I served it for a 4th of July party, decorated with strawberries, blueberries & raspberries.  It was a big hit!  The only problem- no leftovers :(

Just finished making these for our 4th of July dinner tonight. Made star shapes and did designs in blueberries and strawberries. Had to try one...then two...YUMMY! So easy, so delicious, and looks amazing! Didn't do this glaze; microwaved strawberry preserves and drizzled as a glaze.

The kids loved it. Quite tasty, impressive looking and not hard to make. I skipped the topping (because I forgot about it) but it was very good even without it.

I made this recipe this past weekend for my boyfriend, and he hands down loved it. He said that it was the best desert he had ever tasted! I'll try this next time with the powdered sugar and less cream cheese. The drizzled sauce on top made it PERFECT.:)

I made this for easter and everyone especially the kids loved it!! I messed up the glaze and it made the crust soggy. It would be good without the glaze too!! Its a fresh wonderfull dessert that everyone will LOVE!!!! I put a pile of frozen blueberrys in the center than in a circle started with kiwi than alternated with a ring off strawberrys and etc. finnished it off with a few random blueberries in between the strawberries.

Delicious! My whole family loves this recipe. The only thing I change once in a while is to use half whole wheat flour in the cookie dough.

This was very good! I used marshmellow cream instead of cool whip, and topped it with strawberries, kiwi and blueberries. The glaze really makes this recipe special. Following other users' advice, I overcooked the cookie slightly so that it didn't get soggy- it kept much longer this way!

Tip: don't use frozen fruit for this, just be patient and wait for seasonal fruit. Lesson learned! Mine didn't last very long and didn't make for tasty leftovers. I used a frozen berry mix, which was actually pretty good. However, after a couple hours passed, the fruit started to "melt" and it wasn't as appealing. Great recipe though!!

I love this recipe and I think I may have reviewed it previously, it was a long time ago.  I have never had good luck with getting the glaze to set, but this time I used 2 tablespoons of corn starch and it set perfectly and didn't alter the taste at all.  The glaze is what makes this recipe!

So yummy! I did add about 3/4 C. powdered sugar to the cream cheese cool whip mixture per other ppls sugestions. Also, I used peach pie filling as one of the fruits and just spooned that over as a glaze instead of making the one here. (Although I'm sure it would have been fabulous too!)

This was a great recipe. The cream cheese topping was SOOO GOOD! The only thing that was hard to work with was the cookie crust. I actually had to make it twice. The cookie came out really crunchy so it was difficult to cut. It fell apart and crumbled. On the second attempt i scored the cookie before i put it in the oven and tried to undercook it a little to prevent the crumbling. I brought it to a party and everyone loved it. i would DEFINITELY make this again.

This is a GREAT recipe and a crowd pleaser!! 5 Stars!! I did take the advise of previous reviewers and substituted one jar of marshmallow cream for the whipped topping.  SOOooooo good!!!  The finished product is so beautiful, when you serve it people are very impressed.  The glaze makes the fruit perfect, especially for those strawberries or other fruit that may not be as sweet as you want them.  Leftovers get a bit soggy but you'll be lucky if you even have any!!  =)  Will make many times!!  Thanks Kay! =)

This recipe is wonderful! I didn't have time to chill the pizza before taking it to a meeting and it was still a great hit. The glaze really does add the right touch. I used strawberries, bananas and apples since that's what my kids eat best. I didn't have orange juice to make the glaze, so I used apple juice instead and it turned out very well (we sampled the glaze several times- yum!). This is definitely a recipe I will make again and again. Thank you!

I tried this with my after school children. One told her dad at pickup--"You have to try this best most specially awesome fruit pizza ever." They all groaned when I told them what they were making because they couldn't wrap their brains around pizza that had fruit, but when they saw the ingredients, they could hardly wait. The glaze was particularily a nice addition.

Do not underestimate the flatness of flat! I did not flatten the dough enough, and it rose quite a bit, creating a rather thick crust. I used strawberry cream chesse since I did not use actual strawberries on top. Fresh ones were quite expensive, so this way I still got the taste without the expense! The pizza was extremely nummy, which is why it has such consistently high ratings! Even those of us who aren't skilled bakers can pull off a very pleasing and quick to disappear dessert with this recipe!

This is now a household favorite! I served it when my in-laws came to visit and they loved it! It's amazing how good this taste and it's easily adaptable to what fruits are in season. This is a great dish to serve to company as it tasted as good as it looks!!

What a delicious AND beautiful dessert!!!  I took this to a teacher appreciation luncheon but opted to do a berry mix only.  Strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and huge blackberries.  The teachers loved the treat and the rich colors of the berries was a nice presentation!

delicious. takes a long time!! but it was worth it. mine turned out much, much better after an overnight chill in the fridge. i also used the marshmallow creme with the cream cheese and added some powdered sugar. the glaze was good but i think i put too much on. i will definitely make again, it was so yummy- but will tweak a thing or two.

Delicious! I omitted the cream cheese and just stuck with whipped cream (I didn't like the marshmallow cream either, as some suggested).  Make sure the glaze doesn't seep onto the crust when you put it in the fridge- otherwise it'll get all soggy on that spot.

I loved this recipe, as did everyone else.  I took the advice of others and used the marshmellow creme and cut down on the cool whip, and it was excellent.  I also used a smaller pan, and the crust was very thick.  A friend who makes this recipe on her own tried my version and stated that she liked it thicker.

I'm making mine like that.

I used a pizza stone (not pan).  I had problems with the cookie dough dripping off the sides while it was baking, and it took twice as long to bake than stated in the recipe, maybe because of the stone.  Also, the cookie stuck to the stone in a few places despite having buttered it first.  However, the final result was a beautiful and tasty dessert.  I will definitely do this recipe again.

Wonderful basic recipe.  The more variety of fruit the better - use star fruit, kiwi, crushed pineapple, mandarin oranges, (no bananas though due to browning), etc.

Made this as listed and added kiwi, blueberries and banana slices to the stawberries. It worked really well and was liked by all who tried it. Used a retangular pan about 9 x 13 for the crust, cut the package of dough into three layers (1/3 thickness of how it was packaged) and this fit almost perfectly. Cooked the dough for 12 minutes as listed, might go a little longer (14-15 minutes) next time.

I demonstrated this at a women's retreat.  It was a hit!  It looks beautiful, and tastes even better!  Assemble at the last minute.  I tried to freeze it as another reviewer suggested, but the cookie crust came out soggy and I had to throw that pizza out.  Maybe because it had a chance to thaw. UPDATE 6/21/2010 - I brushed melted white chocolate on the crust and found this kept it from getting soggy. This is one of my favorite desserts! Tip: keep your hands buttered or use waxed paper to keep the cookie dough from sticking to your hands as your press it into the pan.

This pizza gets rave reviews whenever I take it to work or parties. People tell me I should take orders and sell them because they are pretty and taste incredible! I use Kiwi, mandarin oranges and strawberries most often. The color combination is great.

I use marshmallow fluff in stead or cool whip as suggested.  I make individual cookies/fruit pizzas .  Feeing honored that My nephew and soon to be niece have requested that I make these for their wedding reception since neither like cake.

I used lemon curd as the base. Placed strawberries around the edge followed by blueberries, golden kiwi, and then strawberries. It was a hit and I love the glaze. I made it the night before then refrigerated for a birthday the following morning.

Used a ground nut (with butter and sugar) base instead of cookie dough, pressed it into the pan and baked for 10 minutes, then the rest of the recipe as written.  Good for Gluten Free.  Excellent!

This was a great fruit pizza!  I made it in a 9x13 pan with a lid so I could transport it more easily. The glaze was delicious but made too much.  The only change for next time would be going lighter on the glaze so it doesn't just sit on top.

This was easier then I thought. Definitely pretty!!! The only thing I had a hard time with is neatly and easily getting the pieces out of/ off of the pizza pan. Cookie kind of feel apart. It taste good and is pretty. I was proud to take this to the baby shower and got compliments.

Fantastic!  I made for my daughter's B-day, she is on the healthier side of the family.  This was fresh, healthy-ish and oh so good!!!  Strawberries and kiwi - I think that is all we will use next time.  Make as is!

I followed AV8TOR's  directions and used a jar of marshmallow fluff in with the cream cheese; excellent choice & flavor.
I made a glaze of 1/2 peach preserve and  mixed with 1/4 cup water.  It caused my crust to become soggy so the next time I will use less water or use the glaze in this recipe.  Super simple; super delicious.
Note: Try brushing the glaze instead of drizzling.

I didn’t have a pizza pan so I rolled out the dough on a lightly floured board & used heart shaped cookie cutters to make individual little tarts. I rinsed & dried all my fruit while the cookie dough was baking/cooling so it made for fast assembly. I used canned mandarin oranges, fresh blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, and blackberries and used the juice from the mandarin oranges for the glaze (instead of regular orange juice). I brought these to a dinner party and they were a hit. One thing I didn’t not know...don’t cover them or they turn soggy, they’re best if eaten the same day you make them. Super yummy treat and the glaze adds a touch of sweetness and makes them look shiny!

Skip the glaze! I wanted to try it based on so many positive reviews -so I made one pizza with and one without the orange glaze. The pizza without held up much longer and seemed to have more people going back for seconds! The glaze has a nice orange flavor, but also does change the overall taste of a classic fruit pizza. It’s not bad by any means, my family all just preferred the one without! I will make this again, skipping the glaze, but will try one reviewers suggestion of a melted chocolate layer between the cookie and topping!

We made mini fruit pizzas. Basically we baked sugar cookies and then had the frosting, cut-up fruit, and glaze out so everyone could make their own. Huge success as a replacement birthday cake!

My husband needs to eat gluten-free, so we used Pillsbury's gluten-free sugar cookie mix as the base, and it was delicious! With the cookie base, it's important that the filling be not too sweet. We used strawberries, kiwi and grapes on top, and the balance between sweet and tart was just right. However, if you're making this on a cookie sheet/pizza pan, you probably won't need the entire recipe's worth of glaze. We had a mess in the refrigerator because the glaze overflowed.

I loved this dessert--it definitely is better when made the day before serving.  I followed a previous review where someone used the 7 oz of Marshmallow Fluff with the 8 oz of cream cheese for the topping, it was delicious!  Big hit at the party, everyone wanted the recipe.

Amazing! No adjustments needed. It was an absolute hit at the 4th of July party and I'm going to make it again for a girls' night. I gave out the link on Facebook and my feed has been filling up with pictures of people making this!

I made this to give away so I didn't get to eat it but I got rave reviews from the family that did get to eat it and they said it was 'amazing'.  It was easy to make too so hopefully next time I'll get some :)

This is a great recipe for a simple dish that is very well received for any gathering!  I had signed up to bring a dessert for a picnic so I used a chocolate chip cookie base and skipped the glaze, and had many compliments. It was a great combination of something a little healthier than all the heavy butter and double chocolate desserts, and it was great for the kids too!

I have made a version of this for many years - What I discovered was that putting sliced fruit into the bowl with the top coating saves some work. Then all you need is to do is place fruit on the pizza and dab on the remainder of topping.

I followed the recommendations in the comments and mixed 8oz of cream cheese with 8oz of marshmallow fluff. It was delicious! I made it for our Easter get together and it was almost gone by the time we left. I ended up using 2 rolls of cookie dough and formed it into an easter egg shape and baked it on a baking sheet. I used strawberries, kiwi, blueberries, and mandarin oranges. I didn't skip the glaze, and I'm glad I didn't! It added a nice additional flavor and made the fruit shine. Next time I would cut the glaze ingredients in half, as I didn't need to use so much of it and it makes a lot. Thanks for the yummy recipe!

This was very delicious! I made mine with marshmallow fluff instead of Cool whip. I have to say, it really does taste better the next day after sitting in the fridge overnight!

It was alright, but I would leave out the orange zest, or cut it to 1/4 teaspoon. I had some clementines on the pizza itself and with that much zest the citrus was over powering!

Delicious dessert.  I used two 16.5oz tubes of sugar cookie dough and placed them on a silicone sheet in a half sheet pan 18"x13" pan and cooked for 22 min.  The large cookie was very easy to remove from pan.  I cut the cookie in squares after icing with cream cheese/whipped cream mixture and before adding fruit and glaze to make it easy to serve.  I did add 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 cup confectioners sugar to the whipped cream/cream cheese mixture to make it sweet.  Will make again.

The glaze on this  is phenomenal! Made it just as directed but changed it to small tartlets by using muffin pans and cooking the dough in those.

Loved how easy it was to make this! I improvised by making individual cookies and adding the topping on them too. Also, I didn't add the glaze and it still tasted pretty sweet.

I made two large fruit pizzas for a ladies church function.  I took other reviewers' advice and added marshmallow creme, vanilla and a little powdered sugar to the whipped topping (I used extra creamy) and cream cheese mixture. Excellent advice! It tastes fantastic! I had two of the large 30 oz. sugar cookie dough rolls, so I doubled everything in the recipe to make the two large pizzas.  I made them the day before and refrigerated them overnight, then added the glaze the next day before the function. I made too much glaze though (but the glaze is delicious).  I won't double that part of the recipe the next time I make more than one fruit pizza. Everyone loved them. I got two large pizza boxes to put them in for transport. They were so pretty. One of the ladies asked me where I bought them! Will make this again! Thanks for the recipe!

Amazing, used my own sour cream cookie recipe for the crust, and followed everything else exactly.  It was incredible.  No too sweet. The fruit we used: strawberries, blueberries, red raspberries and blackberries.  MNZIPPY

This is pretty good, but if I'm going to eat this many calories, I prefer orgasmic. :)  It's also really expensive and time-consuming to make, and can't really hold a candle to other sinful delights. The girls did enjoy arranging the fruit on top, and they thought it was tasty. My husband was "meh" about it. I enjoyed it, but this much sugar and fat would make anything taste pretty good!

This was great! I did add 1/2 sugar and 2 tsp. vanilla to the topping...I like things sweet and it was too bland w/o. That's why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. I also didn't have any lemon juice, so I used lime. I used blueberries, grapes, kiwi and raspberries. Very delicious!

This is a beautiful recipe! I took the other reviewers advise and made the cream cheese and marshmellow creme mixture, but added a couple of drops of orange oil.  Wow!! You definitely do not need to increase the glaze amount as it makes more than enough, so you don't have to use it all. If you try to, as I did, it will make your crust soggy. One thing I will do the next time I make it thought is to cook the cookie crust more, about 15-20 minutes actually. It's also very nice to add some coconut at the end.

Simple, beautiful and definitely yummy!  I made this for my daughter's birthday and it was a hit.  Would make this recipe again.  Unfortunately, I took the advice of someone who said to put it in the freezer before transporting.  The result was a very hard cookie - even after sitting out for an hour.  We couldn't cut it for over two hours!  I will not do that again.

Fantastic! The presentation was beautiful and was very impressive as a hostess gift. The taste was great too! EVERYONE LOVED IT! From little kids to grandparents!  I'm known to be a "baker" in my community so something different and refreshing was most welcome! This hit the spot! 

p.s. I made the "Fruit Pizza" dairy free using tofutti cream cheese and omitted the orange zest since we didn't have any. I loved the look of (canned) mandarin segments.

It tasted exactly like the one I had at a fancy restaurant but for way cheaper.  Be frugal with the orange glaze as it tastes well with the pizza, but lingers on the palate undesireably later.  Used jar of marshmallow creme in the mix as well.....Delicious!

Fruit pizza, identical to the kind I use to get in the grade school cafeteria as a child.  This was always what I used to look forward to in school so I was super excited to recreate this recipe!  Yummy but it is a bit more complex and time consuming than whipping together a batch of cookies.  I save this recipe for special occasions because of that.  I also like to take the store bought dough and cut them out in little circles - making individual fruit pizzas, which makes for a really impressive presentation.

I love fruit pizza and this is the best I have ever had. I didn't have time to make the glaze but the cookie, cream cheese/whipped topping and fruit mixture was fabulous. Everyone loved this one and I will be making it again.

Delicious!!  I've made this a few times now and I always want to eat the whole thing!!  I made it with the glaze and I don't think it's necessary even though it was good.  The second time I made it I left off the glaze and it was just as good.  I used strawberries, blueberries, grapes, mandarin oranges, and kiwi!! Yum

I loved this fruit pizza however the crust got really soft, I might try and bake it longer next time.  I really think that I glaze adds that extra something.  I added blueberries, kiwi, manderian oranges, and a few strawberries in the middle.  I added a dash of vanilla to the cream cheese mixture.  I will make this again.  Great flavor.

I made this for a bake sale at work for "fat tuesday". It was the first and only item that sold out completely. Absolutley delicious. I left out the orange zest only because I didn't have an orange on hand. Did not use marshmallow creme but stuck with cool whip since it's about 12 degrees outside. No chance for it to melt. Have already been told I have to make it again soon.

I love this recipe!! The only thing I changed was I used cream cheese and marshmallow cream, instead of whipped cream. (I like it better that way). The glaze over the fruit makes it so sweet and good. Very pretty, so it makes a great dish for entertaining.

this was delicious!  i used frozen strawberries and blackberries.  i used some berry punch in the glaze, instead of only oj.  i would have liked the glaze to be a little thicker too, but its possible i didnt cook it long enough, or cool long enough. Also, i only used about 3/4 of the cool whip

I prepared this for Easter with the very large extended family.  My DH LOVED it (as well as several other family members), but for me I wasn't super crazy about the glaze, it seemed too 'orangy'. I think next time I'll try it with less OJ.  I'll defintely make it again.

A little too much cream cheese.  Try putting more whipped cream and less cream cheese.

I decided to try this recipe for a work picnic. I saved time by making the cookie crust the night before, and arranging the fruit the day of (i didnt want it to get soggy). I used light whipped topping, but it wasnt very sweet. I had to add some sugar. Next time I might just mix cream cheese with sugar. Saved more time by using canned fruit (mandarin oranges and pinnapple). Got several compliments. One kid said she "loved it." Will make again.

This was the prettiest dessert on the dessert table at our office potluck. Very tasty, I loved the glaze. For some reason mine stuck even though I sprayed the pan with non-stick spray, though. Maybe butter the pan next time?

I'm giving it four stars because the only part of this recipe I actually used was the citrus glaze.  I used my own recipe for the pizza part.  The glaze is great!  I am so happy I tried it.  It really adds that unique zing that will make your fruit pizza stand out from the rest.

I love this simple snack or dessert.  I usully use strawberries, kiwi, pineapple, bananas, and blueberries.  When assembled, the pizza looks impressive and colorful.

This is the absolute best recipe I've used for fruit pizza. It stays fresh (including bananas) for a few days!!!
