This disappears so quickly at family gatherings that I hardly even get to taste it.  I live in a small southern town, and couldn't fine fresh raspberries the first time I made this.  (Only around in season!)  I used fresh strawberries instead and it worked just as well!  We love this trifle!

The cake and pudding mixture make this trifle decadent while the fruit adds a nice fresh touch. This was a yummy alternative for Christmas dessert and it fed many people.

I found this in an Eagle Brand Recipe book a few years ago and now my family insists I bring the dessert to every gathering!  I use cool whip instead of the whipping cream usually....just because of the lazy factor.  Best ever!
