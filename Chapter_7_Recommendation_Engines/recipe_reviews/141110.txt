This was exceptionally yummy!  I did a few changes - I didn't want to make the stuffed mushrooms, so I skipped that.  I mixed spicy mustard, brown sugar, Worchestershire, minced red onion and mushroom, and spread half of that on the roast, topped with bacon, and then spread the rest on the bacon.  I had a 2.5 pound roast and I baked for an hour and 20 minutes.  Yum!!!  Easy enough for a weeknight meal but good enough for entertaining as well.  Will make often!

This was absolutely...THE BEST!!!! And so easy, I made it exactly to the recipe, I used French's Bolds n Spicy Mustard...wow. Oh I did add near the end of cooking...a wee bit of water to the roasting pan, so when it was finished cooking, I removed the roast...added more water and boiled and thickened (just a bit) on top of the stove,with corn starch to put on the roast when serving. Everyone rated this 10, definately on my forever favorite list...ohh and the mushrooms...weeee...soooo darn delish and looked like I had be slaving all the day!!
Thank-you Thank-you, please take a bow.

This was very good. Next time would saute onions and mushroom stems before filling the mushroom tops. I used portabello caps - delicious.

Might make again but have several others I prefer over this one.

MMMM...so good and easy to make, too.  I will definately make this again.  I did not make the mushrooms as we do not like them, but the pork was superb.  I did not have any Spicy Mustard on hand so I mixed Honey Mustard w/ Emeril's Essence and it turned out perfect.  I also used fresh bacon from the butcher...the pork was tender and juicy and the bacon crisp and yummy.

For me, even tho I love all kinds of mustard, I thought this was a little too much mustard. I didn't make the mushroom caps. However, this was a GREAT recipe to make for company with little notice and no time to marinate anything. Everyone loved it!

i really liked how the pork turned out.  did not find it too mustard-tasting at all. i used dijon and added a bit of honey.   i tried the mushrooms , using only 4 very large mushrooms as it was only my husband and i  for dinner.  they were very tasty although i sort of messed up the ratios - used too much mustard and, i think, not enough bacon.  i also added some minced garlic, which added a really great flavour.  i also added some parmesean cheese.  if i make these again, i would quickly sautee the onions and garlic before adding and figure out a better mustard ratio.

Very good.  I added dijon mustard (because I ran out of the other).  My whole family liked it.  Didn't think it was too mustard tasting.  I did have to cook it about 30 minutes longer tho.

The pork roast was pretty good-the mustard flavor is really strong, so be aware of that before making this.  My husband is not a fan of stuffed mushrooms, so I just made the pork and served it with mashed potatoes.

I was very disappointed. I don't know what I did wrong, if anything - seemed pretty simple, bacon, mushrooms, mustard, pork.  Gotta say I LOVED the idea of slathering my pork in pork.  But I didn't care for it.  I used less than half the called-for mustard and it was still too mustardy.  The mushrooms weren't good, either.  Sad.

Very disappointed!  I guess I should have listened to the other readers who said TOO MUCH MUSTARD...the taste was overpowering!!  I didn't even use the full amount called for and we couldn't eat either the meat or the mushrooms...are the amounts correct????  I loved the idea but........

The pork tasted delicious, but I will omit the mustard from the stuffed mushroom recipe in the future.

I prepared the mushrooms first and then used the leftover filling to stuff the slits in the roast.  That's the way to go.

This was a little dry for me. We did not make the mushrooms because we don't like them.

Absolutely delicious! Did not change a thing. Other reviewers said the mustard was overpowering. My family didn't even know it was made with mustard. Will definitely make this recipe again.
