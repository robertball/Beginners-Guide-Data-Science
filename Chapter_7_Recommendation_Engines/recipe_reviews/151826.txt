Followed recipe as shown for the exception of adding Walnuts, I used 1/2 cup of Walnuts and 1/2 cup of raisins. The 2 quart pudding was over 1/2 gone before the party let up :) Thanks

Added 12/27/2011 used 1/2 cup of honey instead of sugar, added 1/2 hour cooking time. Once again it was great

I plan to try this recipe a little closer to christmas, I am just adding this now for those who might want to try a steamed pudding but find the idea of steaming to be to much.  I always "steam" my puddings in 1 pint jars in the canner, they are steamed and sealed in one step. Also, I plan to try this with hemp oil, for the nutty flavor, omega 3 and 6 with no cholesterol. Will post how it turns out

this is very similar to the steamed pudding handed down through the many generations of my grandma's family. only the massive quantity of suet is replaced by butter. grandma had a huge steamer she placed across the front of the cook stove. i steam mine in the crock pot. make sure your can fits your crock, or purchase a rival "cake n' bake pan," still available, used, on ebay.com for $5-$15. additional instructions are to tightly cover can with foil. using a paring knife, cut a slit in the foil to vent. fill crock 2/3 with water. place 7 layers of paper towels (yes, 7 layers) over the top of the crock. place table knife across the rim of the crock, and place cover. the knife gives the correct amount of ventilation. cook on high for 4 hours. after four hours remove can from crock, remove foil, invert can on plate and hope you greased the can well enough for the pudding to slide out.  when reheating individual servings of pudding do it in the microwave for 30-60 minutes, as desired.  be sure to place about 3 layers of moistened paper towels over the pudding.

I followed the recipe. Steaming was new & fun. The texture was lumpy, soggy & dense. Only the cat liked it.

I followed this recipe to the T except for the raisins which I omitted. However, I did make a couple of substitutions.

I do not have a steamer rack, so my grandmother made a ring of aluminum foil to hold it up, which is a trick she had seen on TV. Also, we used a Bundt pan instead of a mold. When I dumped it onto a plate, it flattened a little bit and it was really dense and moist. Is the pudding supposed to be like this?

Used brown sugar, a tablespoon of ground flax for the nutty part and a tablespoon each of brandy and lemon juice. Smells amazing as it steams. I covered the top with a butter wrapper and parchment paper topped by a small plate. The way my Gran always steamed her puddings.

Just like my Mom used to make at Christmas. This was a huge hit with everyone. Especially served with Rum sauce!
This recipe is now going to be a tradition in our family too!
