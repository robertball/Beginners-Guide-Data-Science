Perfect! I used the Thai Chicken broth (seperate recipe from Jettila) and cut back just a tad on the peppers for the wife. Thanks for the broth recipe; I'm now pre making and canning it. Works great for tom kha gai base as well!

Awesome!! I forgot about Tom Yum soup until I had some delish soup at the Thai restaurant next door.  My friend and I agreed that this soup we made was WAY better than at the Thai restaurant! I was unable to find the kaffir lime leaves so subbed extra lime juice, it still turned out great.

I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned. One recipe I had says to boil the shrimp shells in the broth, then strain the broth and discard shells. I added a stalk of lemon grass and a few small pieces of galangal (removed before serving).  I topped each bowl with cilantro and a bit of hot chili oil. Thanks for the recipe:)
