Good flavors, but I had trouble cutting the goat cheese into nice round circles for battering and broiling.  Maybe the cheese should've been frozen lightly first before slicing and handled quickly while battering?  I couldn't find any herbed goat cheese, so I rolled the round over a light sprinkling of  herbs de provence. My parents, who are usually afraid of odd pairings of flavors, really liked it.  It's unique and exotic and made my hors d'oevres spread look very exotic. Ooh la la!

I made this as an  appetizer for a dinner party and it wasn't what I had hoped.  No one liked it.  The mangos weren't the best so maybe this is better with very flavorful mangos.  An interesting experiment but disappointing.

I couldn't find watercress so I used slices of cucumber instead. The goat cheese is challenging to work with, it helps to put it in the freezer for a little bit before slicing. Turned out really well and very delicious.

We thought this was pretty good.  I didn't have watercress, so we used corn tortillas and toasted them along with the cheese.  They made little mango-cheese tacos and we sprinkled some lime over them.  Quite good, and definitely would be an attractive addition to a party spread.
