This is actually pretty good.  I was wondering why noone reviewed it.  I sprinkled it with a slight touch of shredded parmesan cheese.  The sundried tomato compliments the asparagus without overpowering it.

This was great & so easy! I love sundried tomatoes, and they added a great zest to the asparagus. I also added some capers. One caution: it is easy to over cook, so watch them carefully. The suggested time made mine soggy-- still delicious, but not as crisp as I would have liked.

I would cook the garlic in low heat because it burns quickly. the asparagus where tender within 7 minutes. good side dish.

Nice, colorful side dish. I sautéed the garlic and tomatoes in a jalapeno flavored olive oil for a bit of extra kick. The flavors were ok, but I felt it was missing something. I think next time I might take another reviewer's suggestion and add a bit of freshly-grated parmesan cheese.

I made this recipe twice first as written and it was OK a little bland. The second time I made it I cooked the asparagus separately by microwave steaming it as shown and explained by Alton brown. I made the tomato garlic mixture and added 1/4 cup balsamic glaze (1 cup balsamic vinegar, 3 tablespoons soy sauce, 3 tablespoons brown sugar reduced to a syrup about to 2/3rd original volume) and served it with balsamic London broil and everyone loved it.
