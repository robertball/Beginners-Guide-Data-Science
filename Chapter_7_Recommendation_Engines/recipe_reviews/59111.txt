Nice invention, Amy. For those interested in a healthy eating plan, this can be something you come back to again and again.  Indeed, it is a healthy recipe. But the best part of this recipe is that it TASTES GOOD. I mean it REALLY tastes good. Admittedly, I was really hungry. And admittedly, I was looking for something spicy and interesting--not the same low-fat, low-cal routine. And man, Amy, this fit the bill and then some. Thankfully, I doubled the recipe so I can eat these delicous burgers for the next week or more. I thought there might be too many red pepper flakes for my taste, but the bite was just right. I'm a condiment freak and I couldn't bear to even consider putting ketchup and mustard on these. I used whole wheat buns, a fresh garden tomato, onion and a few dill slices and with a little Mexican Bean Stew on the side (also available on the allrecipes website), this was a Tex-Mex flavored meal fit for a king.

I changed this around a "little" but it was great!
instead of garlic powder I used mincced garlic from a jar and I halfed the red pepper. It was still spicey though. 
I grilled some french bread and topped with sliced cheddar cheese.
My husband really liked it and we will make this again.
We grilled them on the Goerge Forman grill
enjoy!

Absolutely SCRUMPTIOUS!  The cheese crackers and the combination of seasonings gave these burgers such a great taste.  The only thing I changed was ground chicken instead of turkey.  I topped these magnificant burgers off with some pepper jack cheese and a slice of turkey bacon.  This is definitely a recipe I will use again and again, not to mention share with family and friends.

My family really liked this turkey burger.  I used dried onion powder instead of onions.  I also added some A1 steak sauce and worcheshire sauce.  Toppped with monterey jack cheese, lettuce and thousand island dressing!  Will make again.

This was interesting...be careful the amount of crackers you use or you'll end up with something more like a spicy meatloaf!  Very versatile recipe!  Pile with lettuce, tomato, onions, cheese and a little BBQ sauce on a multi-grain roll for something that'll pass for a Ruby Tuesday-type burger!  I will make this again but try the combo without turkey and mince with fresh shucked quahogs for stuffed quahogs on the half shell.  Or I'll do it with tofu for a spicy vegetarian burger.  I will also use the seasoning-cracker combo with shredded imitation crabmeat for crab cakes (just double the amount of cracker crumbs and add a little melted butter).  Thanks for the recipe, Amy!

This recipe has become a family favorite. I leave out the red pepper flakes & add garlic powder instead but other than that I follow the recipe to a "T"

This was an easy, quick and healthy meal.  My husband and I as well as my children enjoyed it.  As others have mentioned, I also made my burgers on the George Foreman grill and modified with less red pepper flakes and a little more garlic.  Thanks, Amy!

WOW!!  These were absolutely delicious!!  I made only a couple of minor changes.  I decreased the amount of garlic powder to 1/2 T., used onion powder instead of minced, & used golfish crackers(flavor blasted xtra cheddar) and followed the rest of the recipe exactly and threw them on the grill.  My husband said he'd choose these over ground beef hamburgers anyday!  Thanks for the recipe, will definitely make this quite often!!

We used ground turkey breast, goldfish brand crackers and omitted the pepper flakes but added hot sauce afterwards (to taste).  They turned out okay, but I think that there is probably a better tasting turkey burger out there.  Definitely kid friendly though.

Yum!  As a previous reviewer suggested, I added 2 Tblspns of steak sauce.  This is a great recipe to make for get-togethers because it will please dieters and burger lovers alike.

We were looking for a quick and easy burger using turkey meat instead of beef as we were trying to follow our plan.  This was delicious and had lots of flavor.  Ended up cooking it on an Cuisanart counter top grill on medium heat and it worked great.

I love this recipe! Make these burgers all the time and follow the recipe exactly as is. My husband, family and friends all love it too. Thanks for sharing!! If you don't like spicy this is still delicious w/o red pepper flakes. Oh and these taste just as great heated up the next day.

This recipe has a lot of potential, but is WAY too garlicky - even for a garlic fan like myself! After reading reviews I too cut down the red pepper flakes, but the combination of the 1/2 T of pepper and the full T of garlic just made for a harsh, overpowering bite. The burgers were moist and had a nice texture (which can be difficult with ground turkey), but the flavor was unfortunately bitter and unpleasant. If I made this again, I would use 1/2 T at most of the garlic, and maybe add some worcestershire sauce for a fuller flavor.

My husband said he liked these.  But my 2 kids and I did not.  They were too spicy for the kids (even after cutting the red pepper flakes by 1/2).  And they just didn't seem quite right to me.  Sorry.

These were very tasty.  I used flavored breadcrumbs instead of crushed crackers, minus the pepper flakes and used salt and pepper to taste. I topped it with cheese and toasted some whole wheat bread using Frank's Hot Sauce and it was YUM!  My husband really doesnt like spicy so Frank' shot sauce is the way to go for a mild kick.  I will definately make this again.

Delicious. I opted to leave out the red pepper flakes but will definitely put it in next time I make this. I used onion powder instead of minced since that's all I had. Also put in a little bit of Worcestershire.  Great burger.

I made the turkey patties (using 1 lb. of ground turkey) and added a few more things. I added a scallion stalk, substituted the garlic powder for 2 cloves of garlic, and only used 1/3 tsp. of chili flakes. The patties turned out a bit bland and next time I think I'll add about 3/4 tsp. all-seasoning salt to give it more flavor. I give this recipe a 3 just because it's a good basic recipe but it needs a lot of additions to make it really good.

I've tried a lot of turkey burger recipes from this site - and this is by far the best one.  We love the flavor.  I do add a teaspoon of light sour cream as I think it helps keep the turkey super moist.  Other than that, I make them as is and love them.

I did not care for this recipe. I don't mind spicy food at all but these were unappealing. I doubled the recipe because we had eight mouths to feed and verified the quantities prior to making the patties. The first thought I had was "wow that is a lot of spice for such a small amount of meat" and my insticts were dead on.

Very moist, lots of flavor, but very spicy. We love food with a kick, but our guests said it was too spicy. I would start with less red pepper next time.

Don't know what I did wrong, but this had way too much garlic and red pepper flakes, and I like spicy things. This definitely turned my husband off to turkey burgers.

I love this recipe, but I usually add only one third of the recommended amount of red pepper flakes.  I like spicy food...but this recipe calls for way too much.

Didn't turn out quite like I hoped.  The burgers took a lot longer to cook than the suggested 10 minutes.

There just aren't enough stars to say how much my family loved these burgers.  I doubled the recipe.  I didn't have minced onion so on a whim I added one package of dry onion soup mix. I cooked them in a dry non stick skillet instead of grilling them.  The mix felt much more moist than I expected but the burgers came out fabulously.  I tried this recipe several days ago and my family is still talking about them.  Thanks for sharing!!

We enjoyed these burgers. I left out the red pepper flakes because my children were eating them. I used onion powder and a garlic and herb seasoning. I didn't grill these, cooked them on the stove. Turned out delicious. Topped with mayo, ketchup, tomato and onion slices and romaine lettuce leaves.

These tasted so good, I will have no problem adding ground turkey to my diet. The crushed red pepper not only gave it heat, it gave it flavor. I used saltines instead of the cheese flavored crackers and they still tasted great. I am always looking for healthier alternatives because I can't eat as much red meats as my family can. The heat just insures my kids will leave my turkey burgers alone. They can stick with the boring beef burgers.

I really liked the idea with the cheese crackers, but the red flakes really made it too spicy.  All I could taste was the pepper flakes and it kind of ruined it for me.  I would like to try this recipe again, but I will only use a few sprinkles of red flakes because it was just too much. My suggestion, follow the recipe, but only use a pinch or so of red flakes. I actually used the white cheddar Cheez-Its and put some kraft singles on top.

Excellent Recipe!  This is our favorite "burger" recipe.  My husband is not one to eat a turkey burger but enjoys this more than the regular hamburger.  We use to grill out but there's been a critter residing in our grill.  I've been preparing these on our Griddler.  They turn out delicious!  I cook them 3-4 mins per side.  Once they're finished I top them with cheese and plate them.  I'll slice some onion and then throw those on the Griddler till they're nice and soft, it really add a nice touch.

These were fantastic!  I added the Hot & Spicy Crackers instead of the Original Plain/cheese kind and these gave the burgers a great added bouns of flavors.  I had to say wasn't all the pleasing to mix up, it looked but I am glad I stuck it out and put them on the grill as these really were fantastic!

I also loved the red pepper flakes in here. What a great spice to kick this up!

Yummy!  Used ground turkey breast for less fat and didn't have red pepper flakes so I used a little hot sauce (about 1/8 tsp).  We topped with melted laughing cow blue cheese wedges and loved them!

I have been searching for a turkey burger recipe for years - but not any more!  Thank you so much for sharing this amazing recipe.  I make it AS IS 99% of the time.  When I do "tweak" it, I add fresh minced onion instead of dried, and fresh minced garlic instead of powdered.  I also sometimes reduce the red pepper as my youngest is heat sensitive.  Amazing recipe without any tweaks at all, and so easy!

While the flavor of these is good the paragraph description is misleading. These will not be low in fat unless you use ground turkey breast only. Regular ground turkey, which includes the dark meat, is almost the same as ground beef in terms of fat and calories.

Like many other users, I also made some changes to taste. I used some onion powder in the meat. I topped with pepperjack cheese, and a dollop of chipotle mayo. Served with sweet potato fries with chipotle mayo.

Fab-u-lous!  Only substitution I made was shredded (not grated) Parmesan cheese instead of crackers.  So delicious, and I've tried a ton of turkey burger recipes.  This is the best so far.

Great Recipe!! But i did make some changes. Instead of garlic powder, i used minced garlic. For the cheese crackers, i had some Goldfish Extreme Blast in my cabinet, so i crushed those. For people who do not like alot of heat in their food...use only (1/2) tablespoon or lessred pepper flakes in the recipe. Very juicy burgers when cooked in a cast iron skillet. Yummy!!

i thought these were pretty good flavor-wise, but i wasn't loving the texture - a little too mushy-cracker tasting.  almost soggy?  it was good for a change but not a favorite.  thanks though!

We've made these three times so far and we love them every time!  We don't usually have cheese flavored crackers on hand, so we use Italian bread crumbs and a handful of shredded cheddar cheese instead.  Our ground turkey is a little mushy, so these work better cooked in a skillet instead of on the grill.  The flavor is so good you don't even need added condiments!

easy and the best turkey burger on the site!  the cheese crackers had me wondering but they were perfect to hold it all together and give a great taste.  Nice bite with the red pepper so if you prefer it mild you may want to cut back a little there, otherwise take it as is and enjoy!

These were great! My favorite turkey burger so far...and they cooked up perfectly on the grill. I used plain Ritz crackers because that's all I had, but I'll pick up a box of cheese crackers just for this recipe. We served them on thin bread instead of burger buns. There were only two of us eating, so I'm looking forward to a leftover patty for lunch tomorrow. Thank you for a great a recipe!!

Adjusted recipe to 5 servings because that's how much ground turkey I had. Used 1 tsp of red pepper flakes and that gave a good kick but not too much. Can't imagine 1 or 2 tbsps!! Slapped in a wheat pita with lettuce, tomato & slice of cheddar. Yum!

These turkey burgers are definitely the best I have ever made and arguably some of the best I have ever eaten.  My husband likes turkey burgers but sometimes complains they are dry or bland but he remarked that these were bursting with flavor (and not dry).  I didn't have all of the ingredients so I was forced to make some modifications: instead of cheese flavored crackers I used wheat crackers and added basil and oregano for fun.  I also used cayenne pepper instead of red pepper flakes (though a little less) and I used a clove of fresh garlic and a tablespoon or two of fresh diced onions.  I also cooked them in a skillet because we don't have a grill.  One day when I plan a little bit better I will try it with the exact recipe.  Thanks Amy!

This was very satisfying. Taking other reviewers' leads, I cut down the pepper flakes to 1/2 teaspoon and turned the dish into a meatloaf.  The dish had plenty of spice.  I topped it off with chili sauce, put it in the oven at 350 degrees, and let it bake for an hour.

This is DELICIOUS!  We don't eat burgers often, so I adapted this recipe for meatloaf... I just add green peppers, ketchup & chopped onion. My husband LOVES it, and everyone always asks for the recipe!  Definitely a staple of my cooking!

I didn't change a thing in the recipe. My husband thought these were fairly good and my mother did, too. My father LOVED them and asked for the recipe! Too spicey for my 4-year-old. (And I'm a vegetarian, so while I do the cooking, I don't eat this stuff!)

YUM!  These were great.  I didn't have any cheese crackers, so I used cheese and garlic croutons.  I also used only 1 tsp of the red pepper flakes, I can not imagine using 1 Tbsp!! We ran out of gas in the grill so we grilled them on the George Foreman, and they were fantastic. Definitely my new turkey burger standard recipe.

I've been using ground turkey in place of ground beef for years now so I am no stranger to the turkey burger...THIS WAS AMAZING! I've added this to my recipe book and I'll definitely make it again. It's simple, cheap and easy to make but SOO SOO good! I know everyone on here complained that it was too spicy but I'm a freak so I doubled the red pepper flakes and it was delicious!

This was soooo good! Little tip, spray your hands with a non-stick spray before placing them on your grill or in the pan. We used a cast-iron pan - mmmmmm. We also used teriyaki sauce and panko instead of cheese crackers (didn't have any). We also skipped the spicy stuff but still sooooo very good. I don't think we'll have beef hamburgers nearly as often. Great recipe. Thank you.

This recipe has become a favorite with myself and my youngest son (16 yrs old). I use onion powder instead in place of the minced, some salt and pepper, and I add in some shredded cheddar cheese. I never would have imagined a turkey burger being so delicious. I had tried some at restaurants and was not impressed. These have made it to the top of my favorite foods list for sure. I cook mine on the George Foreman Grille. We even enjoy throwing the left over burgers in the microwave for a minute the next day...they taste just as good.

These were pretty tasty, for a fairly unusual creation. I made it exactly as written, but I skipped the optional "dried minced onion" since I didn't have any on hand. I noticed that my store sells both 85% and 93% (I think) lean turkey. I used 85% here, but I'm thinking that 93% might have been better. I cooked these on a countertop grill, and I found that the burgers needed at least 6 minutes per side. I was a bit skeptical of so much garlic powder and red pepper flakes in this recipe. I like both, but I was worried that too much was used here - it turned out to be just fine.. And the use of the cheese-flavored crackers was novel. It all added up to some great-tasting burgers - nothing fantastic, but I just may make these again soon.

We really love this recipe and I make them quite often EXCEPT the recipe calls for way too much garlic powder and red pepper flakes for us.  I cut them each down to 1/2 teaspoon and it's fantastic!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was amazing with a few minor changes.  I used minced garlic 1 tsp, and I used approximately 1/4 cup of chopped red onion instead of onion powder, salt and pepper 1/4 tsp more or less to individual taste.  I didn't have any crackers but I had some garlic parmesan pretzels and I crushed them which I had almost a 1/4 of a cup.  My husband said he would never want a hamburger again.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  I can't wait to have it on a pretzel bun.

Delicious!  I'll definitely make again.  It's an interesting, spicy change from the same-old turkey burger, and quick and easy.  I served them with the usual burger fixins, but on whole wheat sandwich thins and with avocado and sprouts.

These burgers were so tasty! The only things I did different were use onion powder instead of the dried minced onion and I used egg beaters instead of an egg.  They turned out AWESOME! My fiance (who's a red meat lover) actually said "wow, that's better than a regular burger." I almost fell over when he said that! We had 2 leftover that we're going to eat for lunch today.  Yummm:)

This burger would be fantastic as is but we didnt have some ingredients so this is what we did...

1 lb ground turkey
1 tbsp garlic powder
1 tbsp chili flakes
1 egg
1/2 c crushed ritz crackers
2 c grated cheese
grilled em on the george forman

They were a little spicy but very good! We were low on groceries so we served them on whole wheat buns with salsa and dijon mustard. Mmm!!

I loved these burgers while my boyfriend felt they were just ok. Our usual favourite turkey recipe has cilantro in it but our company was not a fan of the flavour of cilantro. I came across this recipe and was excited to try it out. We added a slice of havarti cheese, it was great!. To me, this is my new favourite recipe and will definately make it again.

I didn't particulary care for this, mainly because of the texture.  I might try once more and omit the egg to see what happens.

I liked the recipe for the most part but I made some changes to it. I used onion powder instead of minced onions and I added about 3 tablespoons of BBQ sauce to keep the burgers moist. They came out pretty good however next time I will only add a pinch of the garlic powder, 1 tablespoon was way too much and was very over powering!

These were really good, but I made a few changes. Instead of garlic powder, I used 2 cloves of pressed garlic. Instead of dried minced onion, I used chopped fresh onion (about 1/4 of a large onion). I also found the entire tbsp of red pepper flakes to be a bit too overpowering, so I plan on cutting down on those next time I make these (which won't be long from now!).

This was an exceptional burger. I was expecting it to be like most turkey burgers and not tasting quite right. But, I do have to say this was exceptionally good.

These were pretty good, but I think there is room to throw in some more flavor.  The garlic really took over, so I might use a little less next time.  The pepper flakes and cheese crackers turned nice.

Very Impressed!!! Made these at the Firehouse for a crew of 4 and they loved them. I followed the recipe as shown and the bite these burgers had made it an instant hit. Looking forward to making them again for a larger crew at a different fire station.

Absolutly loved these burgers!! I did change just a couple of things. I doubled the batch & only used 1 tablespoon of ground red pepper (instead of the flakes). Still had a good kick to them! I didn't have any cheese flavored crackers so I used regular saltines & then added some grated cheese (about 1/3 to 1/2 cup). Burgers came out juicey, tasteful & simply amazing!!! The whole family loved them!!!

Come out perfect every time! I didn't have cheese crackers one time so I just put in buttery type crackers and it was still great. Nice base to take and make your own.

The best turkey burger I've had. My husband was not looking forward to turkey burgers but after he had these he said they were awesome. We added lettuce, tomato, red onion, and sliced avocado. Delicious!

These were delicious!! BUT they stuck to the grill and made my husband very mad :( Make sure to use some grill spray since they are so low in fat. I used 2 egg whites instead of the egg, and I used whole wheat gold fish. I used 1/2 a Tablespoon of the chili flakes since my 2 year old was going to eat them. They were still spicy. We all loved them!! Oh we also topped them with grilled onions and mushrooms and had them on whole wheat buns. They  just as good the next day without the extra toppings though.

My husband and sons are not big fans of ground turkey but I made these turkey burgers and they were a big hit.  One thing I did do was reduced the red pepper flakes to 1 tsp. the second time I made them.  Perfect for our family!

Nice, quick dinner. My kids really liked it, but I don't htink they would have if I had used the full amount of red pepper. You could separate the mixture before adding red pepper for adults.

These were perfect! I cooked them on the George Foreman grill and I made into 5 patties instead of 4. They were very thick and we were worried that they weren't done completely, but sure enough they were and they were great! Topped them with an onion bun, avocado, tomato, monterey jack cheese and they were perfect.

My partner and I really love these burgers - such a tasty alternative to beef. The only changes I make are that I use real garlic instead of garlic powder and I also add a little Dijon mustard to give it just a little bit of an extra kick. I alternate between cheese flavored crackers and regular crackers - both taste just fine. I do find that they take longer than 5 mins on each side though!! I put them on a wholewheat bun with mixed baby greens, and top with onion, tomato (for him), pickles and ketchup and then I serve with sweet potato fries.

These burgers were just ok.  I was really looking forward to trying these, too.  They were a bit on the dry side.  My boyfriend and I like spicy, and these were ok.  If I decide to make again, I will go with the suggestions of adding hot sauce and worcestershire for the moisture.

I made some changes and this burger is SO good with either ground turkey or ground chicken!  What I do is, saute an onion, some chopped green pepper,and a clove or 2 of chopped garlic in a pan and season with salt and pepper, cook until soft.  Then add to you mixing bowl with, 1 egg (per lb. of meat), a little sprinkle of garlic powder, crushed cheese crackers( I used cheddar mac n cheese crackers), and some salt and pepper.  Mix well, and form pattys, I fry them in extra virgin olive oil, until brown on both sides.  Then I put my secret glaze, that I put on everything from veggies to burgers, which is Apricot(or peach) Jam, mixed with yellow mustard( I never measure it, I just use more jam them mustard, probably like 3 heaping Tb. jam to 1and a half Tb. yellow mustard), after the burgers are browned on both sides, I put a spoonfull of glaze on each burger, flip it around to coat both sides and leave it cook a couple mins, you can eat it now, or what I do is place burgers in the oven at 350 for 5-10 mins just to make sure the burgers are cooked in the middle, and also you can add some cheese before placing in the over, SUPER good!  My sisters both begged me for this recipe, my one sis said "this burger would make a guy fall in love with me"!  haha  I think the crackers are the secret here, they give a great flavor!  Thanks a lot Amy!

This recipe was fabulous!  My family recently started eating turkey burgers and the stores in our area stopped selling the prepackaged frozen ones.  So, I needed to find a recipe.  I altered the recipe to what I had in the house and it was great.  I used 2 lbs of ground turkey, 1 tsp of minced garlic, 1 tsp of onion salt, 2 eggs, 1 cup of crushed cheese crackers, and 2 TBS of steak sauce.  It was yummy!  My kids loved it as well!

These were yummy.  I agreed with some reviewers that the garlic was a bit strong so I may have to cut down on it.  I used goldfish crackers, but was a bit unsure what crackers added to the taste as well.

Yummy! This recipe has become a staple in my house, as I love ground turkey because it's healthy and cheap.  The first time, I made the recipe exactly as said, but the amount of red pepper flakes made my eyes want to pop out of my head so I did decrease it after that (I'm not really into spicy foods).  I also live in an apartment, so I don't grill... I've either done them in the oven or on the stovetop in my grill pan, and delicious every time!

Yum!  I took the advice of GodivaGirl and added 1 Tbsp each of worchestershire sauce and steak sauce.  Only used about 1/2 tsp of red pepper so my 4 year old would eat it.  I do not like cheese crackers, so I used Ritz and that worked great!  Topped with cheese and they were perfect!

Super delicious! We used lowfat ground turkey. Instead of red pepper flakes, we added 2 TBS Louisiana Hot Sauce. Since the previous reviews alluded to bland flavor, we added garlic powder as well as 2 ground garlic cloves and 4 whole garlic cloves, onion powder and chopped fresh onion. Since it's winter, we broiled the burgers inside (about 7 minutes). The garlic became soft and sweet, and the spiciness of the hot sauce was a nice contrast. Enjoyed the burgers with ketchup. This recipe is delicious and easy!

Delicious!  This is the first turkey burger turkey burger that I have made that actually tasted good!  I used Mrs dash (tomato garlic) instead of the crushed red pepper, also added fresh ground pepper and some sea salt.  I cooked them on the grill and they were awesome!

I decided to add a few sprigs of fresh parsley as well as a few tablespoons of diced bell pepper for an unexpected crunch.  I also used fresh garlic and diced green onions.  I would definitely make this again!

WOW! This was so easy and so good. As a guy I have the "GRILL BUG" and love to cook outside. My girl friend likes to eat lite. WAM! A delicious turkey burger! This was so easy and so de-lish! I used buttered whole wheat buns toasted on the grill then topped the burgers with green leaf, red onion rings, tomato, catsup, spicy mustard, fresh ground pepper and kosher salt.  YUM...YUM. She loved it! So did I!!!

Best turkey burgers we've ever had! So moist and flavorful! I did't have garlic powder so used minced garlic, a heaping teaspoonful. Hubby doesn't like too spicy so replaced red peper flakes with about 1 teaspoon paprika. Other then that followed exactly. Will be making again and again!

I have made this recipe several times now and my husband and I really love it. I did change the garlic powder. I added a tablespoon of minced garlic in a jar and I did not have a cheesy crackers so what I did was 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs and 2 tablespoons of grated Parmesan cheese. We have to watch what I cook for my husband and this is perfect.

The first successful turkey burgers I've ever made. Fully expected them to fall apart, but these are perfect! This is a staple in my house after just a few weeks! My only modification is the addition of a handful of grated cheese and adjusting spices to different flavor combos. So far, I've made the original version, a garlic parmesan one, and my personal favorite--cheddar bacon ranch! Love it!

Keep in mind that this is from a confirmed red meat eater ... this is a great alternative.  I did cut back on the garlic and red pepper flakes after reading reviews but other than that, I was true to the recipe.  I cooked them on our Cuisinart Griddler for 5 minutes and served them on Whole Wheat rolls.   A quick and easy meal.

I followed the instructions in the magazine which differed a bit from the website. I've used diced dried onions and left out the  onion and tomato for the sandwich. I forgot to oil enough on the pan, which made it come apart. I have made enough for another burger, though it tasted delicious with the red pepper kick. I would make it again and make it firmer next time around. I've added steamed mushrooms for my side dish.

We loved these. I made ours with Buffalo flavored Cheese crackers, and added onion powder and garlic salt in place of the minced onion. My husband liked these more than the beef burger I made him.

This is surprisingly fantastic!  I only decreased the amount of garlic powder, and because I knew that much pepper flakes would overwhelm my daughter, substituted Grill-Mates Hamburger Seasoning.  Wow, yum, I will be making these a lot.  Thank you!

I used a small  chopped sweet onion instead of minced onion and also substituted 1/4C of mozzarella cheese and 1/4C of seasoned bread crumbs in instead of the flavored crackers. I loved them but the wife thought they were a bit too spicy. Next time I will halve the red pepper. I used crushed red pepper instead of the flakes which may have been the problem.

We love this recipe and we are having again tonight. The 1st time I made these burgers I followed the recipe exactly and my husband loved, loved, loved them. (He puts Red Pepper flakes on everything...I mean everything) but too much mouth burn for me, though he was proud of me for putting a tablespoon of Red pepper flakes in a Turkey Burger. I replaced Pepper flakes with about 1/2 teaspoon ground red pepper and now we are both happy :) He can sprinkle his Pepper flakes before it hits the grill...he would have anyway!

I doubled this recipe and they were simply way too spicy.  I hadn't experienced that kind of spice since living in Albuquerque, NM.  We ate them but drowned the burgers in ketchup and olive oil mayo to cut through the heat.  We also omitted the cheese crackers and used almond flour and filled the burger with shredded cheddar.  I don't think that would've changed the heat profile - but maybe?

It tastes pretty good, however i still changed some ingredients, 1 table spoon green pepper, 1 tea spoon salt, and i didn't have cheese flavored crackers, so i used regular crackers and added 2 table spoon parmesan cheese, then cooked on the stove of 5 minutes for each side, and also added chadder cheese on the top. We loved it.

We are trying to eat healthier and have been searching endlessly for ways to fix turkey.  We did not care for this.

These are just OK.  I like that there aren't so many ingredients and it's easy.  Just too spicy for my taste and my kids.

I made these for a cooking class and none of us liked them. Even my students did not care for them.  The cheez-its made them too salty.

These were delicious! My husband is on the "Paleo Diet" and wanted to make a lower carb version of this, so we subbed 1/2 cup parmesan cheese in for the crackers. The only thing I should have done differently is double the batch--everyone seconds! :) Next time I may add more red pepper for even more kick.

Very good recipe. The patties were HUGE. They stuck together good and tasted great. The only thing I will change in the future is a reduction of the amount of garlic. We love garlic, but 1 tablespoon was too much for us and we found ourselves belching it all night and the next day. We will drop it down to 1/2 tablespoon. Used bread crumbs because that's all we had at the time. Still very good though.

So good!  Favorite turkey burger recipe I have tried so far!  I had to cut way back on the red pepper flakes (kids) to under 1/4 tsp but it still added some great flavor.  Topped the burger off with smoked provolone, lettuce, tomato and avacado!  YUM!  The kids gobbled 'em up too!  Thanks for sharing!

I made these with wheat thins and did not add the onion. We ate them with cranberry relish, fried onions and oven roasted plantains. The only thing they needed was a bit of salt, probably due to using wheat thins rather than the cheese crackers... Other than that it was excellent!

1 Tbsp of red pepper was pretty hot, but had a good kick. Next time I may use 1/2.  I also did not have cheese crackers and just used plain and it still added a nice crunch.  I will make these again.

I made these burgers a few times. Both my husband and three year old daughter love them. I do something different with mine though..... instead of putting it in a bun, I sautee onions and brown and white mushrooms with garlic then top burgers with sauteed mix. Sometimes, I will add a slice of provolone and broil quickly before serving.  Always very good.

DELICIOUS!!!!  My hard to please boyfriend even loved them.  He was a little uneasy about turkey burgers but I convinced him, w/o having tried the recipe myself.  They were sooo fantastic.  We have tried multiple things from this website and liked mostly everything.  We both agreed that this was hands down the best so far!  The red pepper flakes added a great element.  I did not add the onion or onion powder b/c I did not have any and ate it with a whole wheat bun and havarti cheese.  It needed no condiments.  Wonderful!

Simple, flavorful, and has kept me from buying pre-formed turkey burgers from the store for the last three months. It's not too hard to keep the ingredients on-hand (although my boyfriend keeps eating the Cheez-Its), so as long as I plan ahead enough to thaw the turkey, it's a great low-effort "I have no idea what to cook for dinner" middle-of-week electric contact grill meal. I burn through enough ground turkey I should probably just keep a pound in the fridge at all times; I doubt it'll go bad before I eat it, and that'll make this very available on impulse. Recommended.

After having the turkey burgers at Ruby Tuesdays I was hoping for at least an acceptable homemade version.  This is even better than Ruby Tuesday's!  My family loved it, it was easy, and so tasty.

1 tbsp red pepper flakes was waaaaay too spicy for my kids' taste.  I switched to whole wheat ritz crackers.  I will try this again, but with less red pepper.

Very tasty.  I used ground chicken instead of turkey, and I used cajun seasoning instead of the pepper flakes.  For the crackers, I used reduced fat white cheddar cheese its.  I would recommend a meat thermometer to determine when these are cooked.  I cut one in half and even then had a hard time determining whether it was done!

I only used 1 tsp red pepper and it was still a bit spicey, too much so for my kids.  I added a bit of worcestershire and cooked them in the broiler.  I ate mine on a wheat bun with colby-jack cheese.  It was good that way, but alone still lacked some flavor.

These turned out beautifully.  People said "Wow." when I set the platter on the table.  They are nice, thick-looking burgers that kind of taste like meatloaf.  The only change I made was to add less red pepper flakes.  Served them on whole wheat buns with lettuce and tomato.

Thank you for this recipe! It has been a hit! I do add jalapenos that I cut up into small pieces  in the burgers to make them spicey and a lil kick:). I also use jalapeno flavored cheese it crackers, insted of the regular flavored. I've smoked them on the outside grill and I've prepared them on the George Foreman grill. But whenever I make them, family and friends love them! It's a quick, healthy, filling and delicious burger! Also you can try it with hawaiin sweet burger buns, if you like a nice mix of sweet and spicy. Thank you, Amy!

NEEDED SALT!  I thought the salt from the cheese-its would be enough but not even close.  I will garlic salt next time and worshesire sauce because ground turkey has no flavor to begin with.  But I must say that I was impressed with the way the patties held together and the texture was great.  I put a little less pepper flakes and am glad I did because there was plenty kick to it!  I baked the patties in the oven @ 350 for 15 minutes.  Will make again with salt!

These were pretty good.  I omitted the red pepper flakes (we're not spicy fans) and I followed the recipe besides that. Next time I think that I might use real chopped onion instead of dried to add some more flavor.  I also added a sprinkle or two of worcheshire sauce (because it's sooo good).  Definitely pretty good and I'll make them again.

Excellent!  This was a great recipe.  I didn't have any cheese crackers so I used some garlic sesame sticks instead.  They worked out great!  Also, I used egg beaters instead of the regular egg.  Staying a little healthier.

A nice change from regular beef burgers. I reduced the amount of garlic powder because it seemed like too much, and used hot sauce instead of red pepper flakes (also less, because there are kids who don't like spicy in my family). An easy weeknight meal that I made extra of so that people could have them for lunch too. Thanks!

LOVED this!  this is my first time making turkey burgers and they turned out fabulous.  only changes i made were to half the garlic powder and i used a few dashes of hot sauce instead of pepper flakes.  i crushed up some whole wheat cheddar goldfish to use for the crackers.  i made some whole wheat hamburger buns, topped with the burgers and bbq sauce.  my 7 yr old (who is basically vegetarian and hates most meat) ate 1 1/2 for dinner AND asked to have one for his school lunch the next day!  now THAT is saying something!

Quick to mix and tasty.  I only made half a recipe (2 servings)  so separated an egg and used only the whites.

Loved this recipe! The burger has just a little bite to it, which I loved.  The cheese cracker and egg makes the burger very juicy.  If you have leftover it tastes great the next day.  Over all not only does it taste goods but it is healthy too.

The first time I made these burgers my husband thought they were just OK but a few weeks later he wanted to try them again.  Now they are one of his favorite meals!  We often make a double batch and freeze half to have them on hand.

I've made these a few times for myself and my daughter and we both love them, but after this weekend I can say they are a true hit!  I had a group of friends over with thier children, and when I informed them that we would be having turkey and chicken burgers they were VERY sceptical.  I did make a few minor changes to the recipe.  I made them with both chicken and turkey and ommitted the red pepper for a few dashes of black pepper and salt.  When making the chicken burgers I added the salt, pepper and garlic and then split the mixture in half.  I rolled one half of the mixture into tiny balls and dipped them in flour, then egg, then the cracker crumbs.  I then flattened them into nugget shapes and baked them for the kids.  I dumped the rest of the egg and cracker crumbs into the other half of the chicken mix and made them into chicken burgers for the adults.  I also mixed some chopped spinach into some burgers and nuggets before cooking them for the more adventurous eaters.  EVERYONE loved them, even the kids!  For a group of people who had never eaten turkey or chicken burgers before(and turned their noses up at the idea) this was a huge success!

These are DELICIOUS.  We followed the recipe exactly and have made them a few times since.  So easy, very juicy, just the right amount of spice.

What a great, easy recipes.  I tripled the recipe and left out the red pepper flakes due to guest preference.  It turned out great and I'll make again soon.

These were really good!  My beef loving husband was very impressed and pleased that they were healthier.  I only used about a teaspoon of red pepper flakes and it still added just a little kick but not too much for my two young boys.  I will enjoy playing with this recipe and changing the crackers and spices to make different flavor mixes.  Thanks Amy!

This recipe was excellent.  I love hamburgers, so I was skeptical that turkey burgers could ever be as good, but boy was I wrong.  I followed the recipe, plus sprinkled on some Lawry's seasoning salt and black pepper prior to grilling.  If you are nervous to try turkey burgers, don't be.  These are great!

Made this last nite, my only modification was to use a touch of garlic salt instead of the minced garlic and it was great! Will definitely make this again in the future.

These burgers were flavorful and juicy. I thought 1 tbsp. would be too much garlic powder, but it was just right. I only used 1/2 tbsp. of pepper flakes and forgot the egg. I didn't taste the cheese flavor from the crackers, but they must add a general salty flavor that's necessary. I would definitely make these again.

These burgers are wonderful! My husband has never enjoyed turkey burgers until now. They are so moist, the cheese crackers are a great addition. I cooked them on our Traeger grill and they came out perfect. I topped them with a mayo/horseradish sauce. We will surely be making these again! Thanks Amy!

Thanks Amy!  This was delicious.  My husband even called his mom to tell her how great the burgers were.  To reduce sodium, I used Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb seasoning instead of the garlic and onion.  I also used whole wheat cheese goldfish crackers..Delicious!

These Turkey Burgers were filling and delicious. My son and I made these for lunch and only needed a burger a piece to be full. We didn`t have buns so we used bread slices. We also used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. I`ll say it again, it was delish.

This was the best turkey burger I've every had!  I used jalapeno cheese crackers, and it gave the burgers a bit of kick!  I'll definitely make these again!

They were all right, but a little bland.  I'm not sure what the cheesy crackers bring to the party.  I also used fresh diced onion, which didn't work too well because I'm terrible dicing onion small enough to work right.  Question...is that a half cup cheesy crakers before or after they're crushed?  I just grabed a handful of crackers out of the box and smashed them up, but the turkey seemed a little loose.

These burgers are very good. I have made them more than once for my family. Even my children enjoy them! Grilling the burgers add another layer of taste to the meat.

Very good.  I thought they were a little bland at first--the cheese crakers didn't add quite enough salt for me--but they were perfect warmed up the next day, after all the flavors had time to meld.  The texture was also a little weird to me at first--too "smooth" and soft, if that makes sense--but that could just be because I haven't had a turkey burger in a while.  Took me longer than 10 minutes to cook in my grill pan, but that's a minor complaint.
