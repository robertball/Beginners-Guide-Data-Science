I think this recipe needs some ice-cream to thicken it up and make it colder.

I used two bananna's - it was good but not very thick or cold.  Like the previous review, I think this recipe needs some ice cream.

I thought this recipe was quick, easy, and totally awesome, although it could be colder. I think next time I'll add some ice. I used a peppermint flavored hot chocolate mix, which gave it a more interesting flavor and a bit of kick. I would highly recommend this is a healthier alternative to other milkshakes.

This was really good, I gave it to the kids today with their peanut butter sandwiches and they loved it. It did need to be colder, so I added 2 huge scoops of Breyer's Banana Bananza ice cream, and I must say it tasted almost exactly the same! (It has the same flavor combo) so next time I'll just add ice to get the same effect with fewer calories. A great would be low cal treat, that's pretty good for you, too.

I wouldn't necessarily call this a milkshake, but it was still yummy. I also used two bananas and ditched the sugar as there's plenty in the fruit itself and the chocolate drink mix. Thx!

Freezing the bananas is a great way to make this drink colder.  Using ice just dilutes it and it looses flavor.  I freeze my banana's in chunks and drop them in the blender.  Nice frozen drink!

Try frozen bananas to make this even more like a milkshake.  I also like to use chocolate sauce, and then there's no need to add the sugar.

I don't know if I would call this a milkshake, but it was pretty tasty! I skipped the sugar and added about a half-scoop of chocolate ice cream. Calmed my chocolate craving with minimal guilt :) Thanks

AWESOME! Five stars (with half the sugar). It's called a 'flip' not a 'thick'shake folks so it will be a little thin. If you are after a thickshake this isn't it. For Aussie reviewers, I blended Milo and sugar to a finer powder before adding the other ingredients. It made it that much more smoother. I'll make this again for sure.

This was really good, but pretty thin. I froze the bananas I used in my drink before blending, and it gave it a creamier taste. Add a few tablespoons of toastd wheat germ for texture and a bit of nutrition, or try some powdered milk to help make it a richer, creamier drink.

I made this and i loved it! The only thing i did different was i didn't have powdered chocolate drink mix so i used Nestle's Cafe Francais coffee mix instead and  it was way to sweet! I also put it in the freeezer for 10 minutes and it made it extra cold:)

This is incredibly delicious!  This is a favorite kid-treat and an excellent use for bananas that are leftover and starting to turn. We always double the recipe and it never sticks around.
