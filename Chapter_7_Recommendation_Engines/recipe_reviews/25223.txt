I actually find this too filling, so use 1/3 cup oatmeal and 3/4 cup water.  As others suggested, I substituted ground flax seed for the oil.  I also left out the honey.  I didn't have soy milk, so added some cottage cheese and about 1/4 cup berries.   I have had this for 5 days in a row and think I could and will eat it every day for breakfast.  EDIT: I first reviewed this 10 months ago and I am still eatin it at least 4-5X a week.  It is healthy and fills me up so I'm never snack through the mornings.  UPDATE:  It's been 2 years and I still eat this at least 4-5X a week, with a big spoon of cinnamon mixed in.

Great recipe - I added some cinnamon, nutmeg, and a dash of vanilla extract.  Instead of topping it with soy milk, I topped it with a huge spoonful of fat free honey flavored organic greek yogurt.  This was very filling and very healthy.

This is a good base recipe, but I have had to make some changes to suit my personal tastes.  My biggest problem is the flaxseed oil... it does not combine well and looks oily.  Not very appetizing.  So I used ground flaxseed.  I also use skim milk instead of soy, since I don't like soy.  Otherwise, this is certainly a good way to make oatmeal even healthier!

Excellent easy fast breakfast. Tasty way to get beneficial flaxseed oil. I added 1 Tablespoon of dried fruit bits and used vanilla soy milk. This recipe is good AND good for you too!

I tried this recipe for the first time yesterday and liked it so much I had it again for breakfast this morning.  This breakfast is suprisingly filling.  A big plus to this recipe is that it is quick to make and it's easy to clean up afterward.  It's healthy too.

This was good. I used ground organic flaxseed sprinkled on top after cooking the oatmeal, and organic agave in place of the honey.

If you don't normally like oatmeal, you probably won't like this recipe either. For me, it isdelicious, and the wheat germ provides a wonderful texture. Use the honey at your discretion. I only use 1.5 teaspoons. This is the only way I make oatmeal now. Thanks.

After 5 years of making fun of my husband for making and eating oatmeal EVERY day on the week, I have been enlightened!  This is amazing!  I can hardly believe that something so good for you can be this filling and taste so good.  I followed the directions as written, added half a teaspoon of splenda brown sugar (Only 10 calories) and some organic raisins.  I also use vanilla soy milk.  The result is a decadent, almost desert like breakfast that keep me going all morning.  I use ground flex instead of the oil, but I find the wheat germ and flax has done wonders for my energy.  This is a great recipe and I am SO grateful to have found it.  I am on the oatmeal bandwagon now!

This was pretty good. I didn't have flaxseed oil, I used a tablespoon of ground flax seed and just added an extra tbsp. of liquid. I used organic apple cider instead of plain water, I stirred in a half teaspoon of homemade apple pie spice and I stirred in 1 tbsp. organic honey before eating. I don't drink soy milk so I used nonfat milk. This was quite a filling breakfast. The great thing about oatmeal for breakfast is it can be different every time so play around and use whichever liquid/stir in's that sound best for you!

It's great just how it's described and lends itself to all kinds of variations. Fabulous Recipe, and I'm not even a big breakfast eater.

I cooked the oatmeal on the stove, added honey, flax meal, sliced almonds, almond milk, cinnamon, and nutmeg. For the first time I really enjoyed eating oatmeal for breakfast. Thank you for the idea!

I eat this almost every morning.  I use 1/3 c. oatmeal and about 3/4 c water because instead of flaxseed oil, I add about 2T ground flaxseed meal and sometimes throw in some cinnamon and raisins.  I always cook it in the microwave for 6 min. at 50% power.  Delish!

This was delicious!  I also suggest adding a tablespoon or two of flaxseeds.  It gives it a nutty crunch, plus Omega 3 fatty acids.

Great recipe but I use steel cut oats which are much better for you.  I cook 1 cup oats to 4 cups water, once a week.  Each day I take out the amount I want, zap it and add all the goodies.  It's the best - ask Oprah!

This makes a lot of oatmeal.  Next time I will not use 1/4 cup of skim milk (it made it runny).  And will just add enough milk to my liking.  You can add maple syrup or whatever flavor you are after that day.

Remember to use a really huge bowl for this recipe.. I found that my oatmeal bubbled up and boiled over the sides of the bowl, and I had to clean it up. I used 1 tbsp of brown sugar instead of honey, and thought it needed 2x the sugar... also replaced flaxseed oil with margarine, and used less milk. Added a little cinnamon and vanilla for some more flavor. Definitely needs lots and lots of flavoring ingredients added in! I thought this recipe was extremely filling... next time, half a portion would be enough for me! UPDATE: I now cook 1/3 cup of oats and 2/3 cup of milk in the microwave (water is too bland), and add 1 tsp margarine, 1 tbsp brown sugar, and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon in. Canned peaches and pears are nice additions too. =)

I don't recommend the microwave either, oatmeal cooks in about 5 minutes on the stovetop and turns out tasting so much better.  Oatmeal in the microwave turns out gummy and tastes like glue. It tasted good on the stove, had a nice nutty taste.  We added craisins (kids love them) and they ate it up!  Even filled up my always hungry 4 year old, she didn't quite finish her bowl before declaring herself full.  It was almost 2 hours before she asked for a snack.  :)

Great for recipe while breastfeeding. Oatmeal is good for lactation. I did not have wheat germ so I omitted, but will next time. I used seeds instead of oil.This is my first time using soy milk since I cannot use regular milk while breastfeeding. I was a little scared of the taste because of the soy milk and this recipe not using sugar. I was surprised that the honey did the job.

Strangely addictive. I did not think I would like it that much and perhaps have to force myself to eat it at least once a week. WRONG. I eat this stuff nearly everyday and sometimes twice a day - especially before a long workout.  Something about the thick warm oatmeal with all those other good things is just comforting... strange I know.  All in all, good stuff and a new staple in my diet.  Thanks

I made this recipe this morning for my 2 pre-schoolers. I was looking for a substitute for the pre-packaged oatmeal. I used vanilla soy milk and added some animal shaped cake candies so that my girls would still think it was their "dinosaur oatmeal". We all loved it and I feel better about removing one more proccesed food from our house. Thanks for the great and fast recipe.

Great recipe.  Very easy to make this one your own.  I added a few sprinkles of cinnamon and nutmeg, 1/2 tsp of brown sugar, and about 15 raisins.  Hmmm, Hmmm good!

Delicious! The soy milk and honey really added to the flavor. Paired this with a homemade smoothie - what a good start to the day. 
I also really wanted to comment on one of the popular reviews, which advises users to NOT microwave oatmeal. There is VERY LITTLE scientific evidence that suggests this to be true. Nutrient loss in nearly any food occurs when heated - heat denatures proteins and breaks down enzymes. The significant loss of nutrients in cooking usually occurs when cooking foods in water (e.g., boiling vegetables) because the nutrients seep into the water, which is then discarded. With this recipe, all of the water is absorbed; none discarded. 
At least, this is what I've learned from university nutrition & evaluating scientific studies. Sorry to rant, it just bothers me when I see these types of claims.

I use much less water, just barely covering the oatmeal in the bottom of my large coffee mug I use to microwave it.  And only MW for 1 1/2 minutes.  I don't like it gluey and this works.  Like to add craisins, flax meal, cinnamon, soy or skim milk after cooking the oats.  Recently bought raw hemp seed (high in protein) and it's good in there too.  Talk about a breakfast that stays with you all morning:  this is it.

Excellent base recipe, to me oatmeal is always better with milk instead of water. Honey is great but if you prefer maple syrup is also delicious.  So many ways to change it up, so many different things to add in.  Thanks for sharing!

Good oatmeal that you can add/subtract ingredients to your liking. Quick, healthy breakfast.

Delicious, healthy and very easy to make it! I didn't have flax oil, so I used 1/2 Tbsp of flax seed instead. I also used splenda instead of honey.

Great idea!  I make oatmeal for my toddler almost every morning and this is a great way to up the nutritional value.  I make hers with heavy cream (because she's a very skinny baby) and then after it's cooked, use apple sauce for flavor and to get a creamier consistency.  I also stir in some cinnamon and use ground flax seed rather then flax oil.  It smells like apple pie and it's one of the few things she consistently gobbles up!

I modified this recipe and made it low-calorie and filling.  I cook the oatmeal as directed, omit the honey and use one packet of artificial sweetener, omit the oil (because I don't have any) and add a nice dash of cinnamon.  Sometimes I will add a few slivered almonds, raisins, chopped apples, etc... the possibilities for this recipe are endless!  I eat it all the time!

Good recipe- just watch the times on your microwave.  Mine was almost too done by 3 minutes.  I have flax seed meal but no oil, so I used that instead, and regular skim milk.  Also added a little pure maple syrup in place of some of the honey.  Good and healthy!  I had some fresh peaches and skim milk with this for a good filling breakfast.

Finally a microwave recipe that is makes oatmeal taste as good as one made on the stove! I As other comments, substituted ground flaxseed instead of oil. Added almond milk  (no soy), cinnamon. Those of you adding "honey flavoured yoghurt"....don't....you're adding so much sugar. Oh...and cow's milk/dairy is made for the the calf...not humans and is full of hormones and terrible things that you're negating all the health benefits of the oats!

Yum!  I added walnuts to give it a little crunch.

I like it, especially with the wheat germ. But as some others stated it was rather bland - which is why I think this is a great recipe only if you have some nuts/berries/other fruit to add in. 

Personally I added in almonds and raisins and it tasted great - until I ate all the raisins and almonds before I finished the entire bowl of oatmeal. So next time I will just add more of those, hehe. *shrug* Also, I left out the flax oil, and used 1 1/4 cup of whole milk in place of the water & soy milk.

I scaled it down to what the top reviewer suggested: 1/3 cup oatmeal and 3/4 cup water. I also used ground flax seed in place of the oil, close to a tblsp and added a touch of cinnamon. I went easy on the honey, but topped it with pure maple syrup. Good and filling.

This taste  very bland. I rather stick to my old recipe that calls for more milk than water.

First of all, I cooked it on the stove. I substituted coconut oil for the flax oil; substituted hemp or coconut milk for the soy; added about 2 Tblsp of raisins and a few diced apples; added a dash of cinnamon and a splash of vanilla; added 1 Tblsp. of chia seeds instead of flax seeds; added a few chopped pecans; I used pure maple syrup in place of the honey.  I added all the ingredient in with the oats while cooking. This really jazzed up the recipe.

This was great! A little bit mushier in texture than I prefer, so I cooked it on medium for three minutes. I topped with berries and skipped the flax oil because I had none. The wheat germ added a nice thickening quality!

I can never eat plain oatmeal again!  My husband loves this recipe as is.  I usually omit the honey and add a shake of cinnamon and sometimes some raisins.  Love it!

This oatmeal really is super good!  I eat it every morning and it keeps me full from 5:30 in the morning until noon!  But I normally omit the soymilk.
