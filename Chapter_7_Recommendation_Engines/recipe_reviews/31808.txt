Excellent...very easy and tasty. I baked this in stoneware and the bird was moist as could be!  Everyone loved it.

This was a great recipe. I did add 50% more apple jack to my recipe and added potatoes and carrots. The gravy was amazing. My family loved it.

I cooked one bird in cast-iron enamel at 300 for 1 hour, but it came out dry. Next time I will try cooking at 250.
