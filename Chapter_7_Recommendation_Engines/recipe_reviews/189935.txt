these were really good on burgers.  You must take them out as soon as they are golden brown or they will have a burnt taste. Definately spread them out a bit on paper towels to drain and crisp up.

Great addition to salads, soups, potatoes, sandwiches, casseroles, and so much more! It is important to use a small size pan for frying along with the small amount of oil. Fun recipe!

So simple, so easy and soooo delicious. I can't eat gluten and these are the perfect replacement for the canned variety, way less greasy, and so much healthier, too. The thinner you slice the onion, the better the result. Try them over creamy, buttery mashed potatoes. Yum!

Better than canned and easy to make. The only change I made was to use seasoned salt instead of regular. I'm never buying canned again.
