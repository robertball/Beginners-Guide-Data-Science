I made the scramble part and it was very delicious! I added mushrooms, tomatoes, onion and cilantro and put it on garbanzo beans I had made previously. The hub said it was fantastic! If I had really read the instructions b4 making it I would've cooked the garbanzo beans according to the recipe and it would've been even more tasty. A tip for cooking with tofu is extra firm cut through the middle so you have two flat thin pieces salting and peppering and leaving it cut side down in a colander to strain while u prep everything else. This will cut down on the cook time as well as a lot of the moisture will drain off before you even cook it. This is what I do whenever I want a firmer tofu. You can also put something on top to weigh it down.

I am obsessed with this recipe!  I make a big batch of this on Sunday and pack it in individual containers to have for breakfast all week long.  It is amazing made just as listed, but I have tweaked it to suit my own needs.  I use shredded sweet potato hash browns, instead of the potato, and I omit the tomatoes and add chopped zucchini and mushrooms.  I sometimes add chopped red bell pepper as well. The spices really make this dish. Thanks so much for sharing!

I am new to being a vegetarian and have been looking for something to replacing my morning eggs.  I think I found it!  I didn't do the potatoes but I did everything else and it was delicious! I will definitely be making often!

I never like tofu particularly but our daughter is vegan.  I've made this several times now for my husband and daughter and me and it is superb. The tofu + turmeric looks just like scrambled eggs.   The only change I made is to sub in pinto beans for the black beans as a matter of preference.  Thank you for such an amazing recipe!

Tasty. My husband loved it. He thought the “eggs” were great. He couldn’t believe it was tofu and not eggs. I’ll make this one again!

Loved it! A bit time consuming to make, but worth it. A little spicy for my 4 year old, which could easily be remedied by scaling back the pepper.

First time cooking tofu. It does have the same texture as scrambled eggs. This dish is heavy on protein so try not to eat too much. I didn't have cilantro but most of this just felt like bulky food in a bowl. I'd make it again but definitely recommend the hot sauce. Does need a bit more flavor in there or just heavier seasoning.

This was absolutely delicious. Took a bit longer than 10 minutes to brown the tofu, and I used medium firm tofu because it’s all I had. I was sure to squeeze out all the juice first. Very very good. Try a side of sour cream!

Made a few adjustments and used eggs instead of Tofu and sweet potatoes instead of hash browns.

I am not vegan or even vegetarian, but this dish is amazing & delicious. My son is vegan and I was very pleased to be able to make a dish with tofu that was actually really good. Because I tried this dish in the winter,  ripe, edible tomatoes are not available. I used a 15 oz can of diced seasoned tomatoes. I took a lazy route and purchased pre-made guacamole. I would have used sliced avocado but didn’t know when I’d make the dish and did not want overripe fruit that I would have thrown out. We sprinkled with non-dairy cheddar sprinkles and guacamole. It was fantastic!  I plan to make again even without my vegan son home to eat!

It was really, really good!  I generally don't like tofu, but tolerated it just fine in this recipe because it was so well cooked and so well seasoned.  I would definitely make this again!

This was super good!! A lot of people don’t know how to cook tofu and make it flavorful; YOU are NOT one of those people! This was DELISH!!! I omitted the potato, only because I was having one with my dinner later. I added spinach to the black bean mixture and green onions and siracha (along with the avocado) on top and YUMMY!!! I even had my 10yr old son try it (who never liked eggs) and he absolutely LOVED IT!!! We have recently gone vegan and it’s recipes like this one that make this permanent lifestyle so easy to stick to!! Thank you for this!!

Really tasty stuff.  Tofu actually ended up looking like scrambled eggs, which was a nice surprise that would likely engage a wider breakfast audience.  I had some leftovers of the bean portion of the meal which ended up tasting lovely with some rice the next day!

Delicious, but it took forever to make.  So many ingredients to measure  and two separate pans to clean afterwards.  I think I will stop now.   I am just whining now.  My husband loved it also.

My whole family liked this.  I did make it with tofu, and it was good, but I think I'll try it with eggs next time.  I cooked things in the order the recipe listed things.  By the time other things were done the tofu was a bit dried out.  I think I'll start it, or the eggs, when other things are about done.  I was a bit nervous about using 1.5 teaspoons of so many spices but it did give it a really good flavor.

I love a good tofu scramble,  I left out the peppers and onion,  and it was so good.     Next time I'll try it with the peppers and onions.  Definitely on my make it again list.

I was looking for something new and tasty for breakfast that was vegan and I found this recipe. Boy am I glad that I found this one. It is in our regular rotation for recipes now. I needed something that my hubs, 4 yo and 19month old would eat and this is it. We were missing eggs and this recipe satisfied that craving for us. I didn't change a thing in this recipe and I followed it exactly. This is a staple in our house and thanks for this delicious recipe.

This was an amazing recipe! Great flavor and tofu cooks deliciously. Really great for starting vegans!
