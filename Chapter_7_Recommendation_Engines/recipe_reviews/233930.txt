This came out delicious! I substituted cilantro for parsley, and added a dollup of homemade guacamole on the side. They tasted great together! Will definitely make this again!

I did a half recipe in 9x9 glass pan.  It was mostly cooked with 5 extra minutes covered with foil.  I used artichoke instead of zucchini.  Over all it was bland/boring.  I would recommend doubling the garlic, tomato, onion and parsley mixture.  The reviewer who put feta cheese between layers had a great idea! I will make this again but use chicken broth or stock instead.

This recipe was a bit of a disappointment.  It lacked good flavor and was not good reheated.

Similar comments as to other people. As written, it's bland. Also too vague - "thick" slices of potatoes cooked VERY Slowly. Way more than the suggested cooking time. Also the description of how much liquid to add is vague.  Because of the comments I read about how bland it was, we used cream of chicken soup instead of just stock. Not sure if this made it better or not, but added a little density and the rice was quite tasty. 

We added -- 
Some sun dried tomatoes (I actually like rice and tomatoes together) which gave some tang, a lot more garlic, some paprika, and some other veggies (we had some green onion and cauliflower around). Finally we topped everything off with some cheese the last 10 or so minutes (we had a light Gouda which added creaminess  but not a conflicting flavor). 

Next time, I would either cook the potatoes a little bit, or slice them quite thin to make sure they cooked. 1/8" or thinner. 

This rating is largely based on the recipe as written, but I agree with others who said this is a nice start, but needs some big adjustments to make work.

Strange combination of ingredients-the rice and tomatoes just don't make sense.  I baked this for an hour and it was still not cooked enough.

I put in a 9x9 pan.  I doubled the fresh sweet onion, garlic and added more fresh parsley.  I also put in some feta cheese between the layers.  This is a very versatile recipe.  Takes longer to cook but that is ok.

I found it a bit bland with courgettes, maybe eggplants would give more taste. Also the cooking time was more one hour than 30 minutes for me otherwise the rice and the potatoes were not cooked after 30 minutes.
The good thing about this recipe is that you can vary it and used this one as a base.
