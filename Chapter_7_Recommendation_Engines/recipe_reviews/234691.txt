I had intentions of making this as written but once I dumped the whole 16 ounce jar of hot picante sauce in it seemed like two jars would be too many. I didn't want the sauce to overpower the cheese. It may not have but I'm glad I stopped at one jar. I can't help but think two jars would have made the dip pretty runny too. Mine was the perfect consistency. You'll just have to be the judge...
