I've never had this before so I don't really have anything to compare it to but we LOVED this! Great flavor and fairly easy to make. I just sprinkled the cilantro over top b/c my little guy isn't a fan of it. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I will def be making this again YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)

Taste just like bang bang shrimp from Bonefish! Very good! The posted serving was way too much for two people. We should have made 1/4 of the recipe. However, these shrimp are great leftover (cold better than heated up!!). Served over rice.
