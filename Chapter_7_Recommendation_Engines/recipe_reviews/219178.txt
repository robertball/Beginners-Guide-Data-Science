I made the whole thing in the bread machine. My machine is maximum 2 lbs and this recipe is 2.5 so the top was squished, but otherwise really great bread.
I tried to halve all the ingredients to make roughly a 1.5 lb. loaf, but bread would not rise. Not a criticism of this fine recipe just a note.

First off, I have this 4 stars not because of the taste, it was delicious, but because this makes a HUGE loaf to fit in one bread pan.  I had to re-read the recipe to make sure I did it correctly.  Did anyone else have this problem? 
I am going to try this again and put it into two pans, as my pan was basically full to the top before it even rose and ended up overflowing when baked.  
Also inside parts were not baked enough, where outside was dark, due to the mere size of it.

We have made this bread and shared it around it is so  good we all ways get asked for the recipe. If you bake bread do your self a favor and try it.We did use 3tsp of bread yeast over the 2 1/2 in the recipe.

This bread is very tasty when it's complete. It isn't truly "bread machine" bread, though. Yes, the dough is mixed in the machine. I do this on a regular basis, then bake my loaves in the oven. Just this once, I'd planned to bake the bread in the machine, but didn't notice the part about putting it in the oven until I'd already started adding the ingredients to the pan. Being a "bread machine" recipe, I chose to add the ingredients to the pan as I always do. I followed the ingredients for the most part. I didn't have powdered milk, so I used skim milk in place of water. I also added 4 tsp. of vital wheat gluten to the flour. When the dough was done rising, I realized very quickly it was too much for one bread pan. (Other reviewers have mentioned this as well.) I divided it into two parts and placed each in a 9x5 bread pan. I dampened the top of each loaf and sprinkled on some oats before covering the loaves. After the one-hour rise, the loaves were both well above the tops of the pans. The bread was done baking in 25 minutes and was nice and light, not at all dense. The loaves did sink a little as they cooled. As stated, the bread is very good, but the directions are definitely off. I'm wondering if this is a misprint by the editors or intentional.

I adjusted this recipe for my Oster bread machine by decreasing the water to 1 1/4 cups and used 1 cup white all purpose flour and 2 cups whole wheat flour.  I find bread machines are a great time saver so I let it do all the work!  Not quite sure why some would go to all the trouble of finishing it in the oven but that's just me.

This bread is light, fluffy and delicious. I made the whole thing in the bread maker that I borrowed. It didn't touch the top of the window. Perfection. I followed the recipe exactly.

Great bread!  I did make the whole thing in the breadmaker and while it was a large (and very tall) loaf, it remained contained and cooked properly.  I did not have any powdered milk on hand, so I left it out.  I'm sure that's the reason I had to add a bit more flour during mixing to reduce the stickiness.  Will definitely make this again.

This is a fantastic bread!  I made a few changes based on my personal preference and what I had available in my pantry.  My changes do not reflect the quality of the recipe, however.

So here they are:

I reduced the sugar to 1 Tbsp, reduced the white flour to 2 cups and increased the wheat flour to 2 cups.  I used half water and half milk to proof the yeast in, as I did not have any powdered milk in my pantry.

This does make a huge overflowing loaf in a 9 x 5 pan, so I will use 2/ 9x5 pans next time.

This is the best homemade bread!

I am a complete newbie to bread making and wanted to find an easy recipe to start with.  This recipe is AMAZING! I have now made it twice exactly to the recipe, and each time the bread came out perfectly.  I've even impressed my family and friends!

I have tried many bread machine reipes and this is by far the best I have ever tasted. I made a loaf this morning following the directions exactly and it's already gone.My kids are already begging me to make another loaf. I am going to make another this evening using the bread machine for the whole process. Thanks for sharing.

This bread is moist and delicious!  My whole family oohed and aahed over it!  I made the whole thing in the breadmaker.  My breadmaker can make loaves up to 2.5 pounds and this recipe fit perfectly without a problem.  The only alteration I made to the recipe is that I replaced 1 cup of all purpose flour with 1 cup of bread flour (as I didn't have enough all-purpose).  It turned out great!

This recipe is my family's favorite!
I adjusted the recipe so it'd yield 2lbs, and baked in two smaller baking pans in the oven. I've made this recipe many times, and sometimes I change the oats by Manitoba Harvest Hemp Hearts Natural. I also used demerara sugar every time.

This recipe was great. Definitely scale it back if you want to make it in your bread machine. I imagine it is better to make 2 loaves if making in the oven.  The loaf is very large if you make 1.

This is the best wheat bread recipe I've ever made! Love it! I did swap olive oil for the vegetable oil since we don't use vegetable oil. And I divided it into two pans because of some of the reviews. It was so soft and just the right sweetness! Definitely a keeper! Going to try it w honey instead of the sugar and a bit more wheat flour in place of some of the white to see if I can make a sturdier sandwich bread but as a dinner type bread the way it is is perfect!

I'm so glad I started using my bread machine again! This is the first bread I tried and I hit a home run. My husband and I ate 1/2 the loaf as soon as it cooled down enough to eat. I used the recipe as originally written. I can't see how it could get better than this. Epicurean envoy, thank you for sharing this recipe.

The flavor was good but a tad too sweet for our taste. The worst offense however was the fact that this was waaaay too much dough for one 9x5 pan. It flowed way over the sides making the loaf really wide. I followed the recipe as written and the loaf also squished when cutting the slices making the already wide loaf flattened to boot. I may try again cutting the sugar back to 1 tsp. and dividing the bread into two loaves.

So good! I have made this a few times already. I use the recipe for rolls. They come out plump and and not heavy; large enough to use as a hamburger roll, a little healthier than the store version, and a whole lot tastier. It's also not a fussy recipe (good for beginners) and keeps well the next day or two.

I make bread often, and have tried at least a dozen wheat bread recipes - this one is definitely a keeper. Everyone loved it -- delicious , slightly dense and with just a touch of sweetness. I doubled the recipe, and it yielded two good-sized loaves. Used half white, and half stone ground wheat flour, so added 1 Tblsp. gluten. I don't have (or want) a bread machine, and instead put everything into my Kitchenaid mixing bowl. Because of the heavy consistency of the dough, after about 5 minutes of mixing/kneading, I turned it out onto a lightly floured surface and kneaded by hand to avoid over-taxing the mixer motor - about another 5 minutes. I did give it plenty of time to rise - at least an hour each, before and after putting the dough in loaf pans. The baking time and temp were just right. Thanks for the great recipe!

We loved this bread.  It did not last in my house.  Only reason not to make it is that we will not be able to keep from eating too much of it!  I served this on Thanksgiving for the first time.  I have been making homemade bread for over 25 years, with and without a bread machine.  I followed the recipe exactly as is, with two exceptions.  I added 3/4 cup chopped pecans, and I did not bake the loaf in the bread machine.  I split the dough into 2 greased loaf pans and baked them at 375° F for 25 minutes.  I put the ingredients in,  in the order recommended by my bread machine.  The flour, whole wheat flour, oats and pecans were added at the end with the yeast being added last.  This bread was the best tasting, best texture, and was not dried out.  I will definitely be making it again.

I use the bread maker to knead the dough. i use whole wheat and Bread flour, not all purpose. I feel this makes it more airy and less crumbling. Place some egg wash on the top with a sprinkle of oats just before baking.  makes one big loaf or divide to make 2 smaller loafs.

Very good tasting bread.  I did like others and split it into 2 loaf pans instead of one.  It didn't take 35 to bake.  I followed the recipe exactly as far as measurements but not the parts about mixing this with that and adding this and that.  I just put it in the bread machine as any other recipe.  However, I gave it 4 stars because like some other reviews it seems "crumbly" and I'm not sure I will be able to do sandwiches, which was what I was making bread for....

I loved the flavor of this bread, but . . .it was incredibly crumbly.  As in, it was difficult to eat as toast, spread things on it, or eat as sandwiches.  A tad disappointing, as the flavor was awesome, but it just didn't quite work for me.  I may try this again later with different flour to see if that is the culprit.  As others noted, this makes two loaves, not one, of bread, so keep that in mind.  Thanks for the recipe@

I have only been baking bread for a little over a year, and normally if I even look at my whole wheat flour while baking my loaf turns out like a brick. Followed this recipe to the letter using my "Zoe" machine and it turned out great. Nice crust (used an egg wash) and light and fluffy crumb.

This really IS a dense, heavy bread. I was a little surprised by just how dense! That said, it has a wonderful flavor and is much easier to slice more thinly than most other breads I normally make. It is easier to toast, to make sandwiches etc....I did make a few changes....Rather than vegetable oil I used applesauce, 2 cups AP flour and 2 cups whole wheat, 1 additional tablespoon powdered milk, 1/2 cup orange blossom honey, and eliminated the white sugar. I did make it start to finish in my bread machine and it didnt get squished at all....it was a perfect loaf! My family really likes this a lot...I slice it and let them drizzle the Orange Blossom Honey on it....very, very tasty!

This is my go to recipe for twice weekly bread for my family.  I have a 2lb Zojirushi machine, but the full recipe hits the top and messes up the crust.  It also doesn't fit into sandwich bags at that size. I adjust the servings down to 8, and the loaf is the perfect size.  
I also replace the white sugar with additional honey, and I add a tablespoon of vital wheat gluten to the mix to help combat the heaviness of the oats and wheat.  I love the bread, and my kids have no idea they aren't eating straight white bread.  One loaf lasts us for three days of lunches with two kids.  Perfect!

Did the whole thing in my bread machine that can do up to 2.5lbs but it was too big. Flavor pretty good.
