Delicious!  We used a pizza stone and the crust was fantastic.  Will definitely be making this often!

I have my own recipe for pizza crust from Rose L. B. But these toppings were delicious. Really excited to make it for some friends next time. I made it on a super thin crust. That and the mascarpone made the pizza crisp and creamy at the same time. Loved it.

Awesome!  We used Pillsbury thin pizza crust instead of making the crust (following the instructions on the package).  The toppings were delicious.  We were looking for zucchini recipes because we had a ton of zucchini from our garden and this was one of our favorites!  It will be a keeper for years to come.
