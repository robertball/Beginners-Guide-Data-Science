Wow, pretty darn good Hollandaise, and so simple & fool-proof.  I followed the recipe as-is for use over Eggs Benedict.  The recipe makes enough for 8 to 10 servings (at two eggs per plate and a reasonable amount of sauce).  Instead of a blender, I used a Braun handheld mixer which would allow me to 1/2 the recipe for next time.

One suggestion - use UNsalted butter.

Update: Round 2 - Unsalted butter made a big difference, highly suggest it.  Also, was able to 1/2 the recipe using a Braun hand blender - 1/2 of all ingredients listed (used 2 egg yolks).

I made this last night without the Dijon, which I don't like.  I used 4 egg yolks and 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice, along with the Louisiana hot sauce.  I did the 5 seconds in the blender, then slowly added the melted butter.  It was perfect, and exactly the right amount of lemon!  We used ours for dipping fresh artichokes and got rave reviews.

A very good recipe and it will thicken nicely if the butter is "bubbling " hot when it is added to the running blender in a slow stream.  I have been using this recipe for over 30 years!

Delicious and easy!  Use the full recipe though, as I only used part the first time and it didn't blend well with not enough ingredients in the blender.

This hallandaise sauce was apprarently created by god and given straight to my girlfriend. It is the best hollandaise sauce I have ever had, bar none. If you have not had the extreme pleasure of trying this recipe then I personally recommend you stock up on all the ingredients before 2012 and the end of the world.  If I were stranded on a desert island with one form of substanance it would be this sauce without a question in my mind. The Demi-god that posted this recipe deserves a freak'n metal.

If I could give more stars, I would! This recipe is by far the easiest Hollandaise sauce recipe I have ever made. I like being able to control the spice in it too. I use Rooster Sauce(find it in the asian food section isle) and I like to have extra heat so I add a little more then the recipe calls for. Delicious recipe. I have made this and drizzeled it over steamed asparagus and on top of brussel sprouts as well as eggs benedict. Don't let the simplicity of this recipe fool you, it is absolutely fantastic!

Quick and easy preparation. A nice subtle lemon flavor. I left out the tabasco. I was delicious over grilled steak topped with crab and roasted asparagus, also known as Steak Oscar in most restaurants. Thanks for sharing this simple method of preparation.

This was super easy, quick and a great consistency even though I used only three tablespoons of butter rather than the full amount.  I'm giving it four stars because I thought it was bland so I added much more lemon juice and some dried dill which gave it a great flavour.   With all of the above changes, it was fantastic.

Quick, delicious & easy! If you want to make only a 2 yolk Hollandaise, as I did, these are the measures: 2 yolks; 2 teasp. lemon juice; 2/3 dash Tabasco/hot sauce; between 1/8 & 1/4 teasp. of Dijon. After blending that for 5 seconds, slowly drizzle into blending ingreds. the (bubbling hot) 6 Tblsp. + 2 teasp. butter. Thick & lovely!

It's WAY better without the Dijon or Tobasco! Sharp mustard brings this classic, delicate sauce down several notches into so-so territory. (It's kind of like spoiling a deviled egg with Miracle Whip instead of good mayonnaise, or like killing a good apple pie by drowning it with cinnamon.) . I'm still giving it three stars because the method is still very good.

This couldn't be easier and very tastey.
Use right after making tho, as it tends to cool off even when keeping in hot water. I will use this instead of the tradional way!

Terrific served over poached salmon or eggs benedict. The fact that it is cheap, quick and easy makes it a definite keeper.

I've been following this recipe for years now. I've done the double boiler way, worked in fine dining restaurants all over the U.S. that served their own, and had my share at breakfast places - there is no difference and this is SOOO much easier with no worries!  I don't like to use the blender becuase I feel that I waste sauce or sometimes some ingredients tend to hang out on the bottom and not get blended in, but a hand mixer or even one of those little milk frothers works great!  I don't even bother browsing for alternate recipes - will keep making this one!

Making this blender Hollandaise is analogous to making bread in the bread machine rather than by hand – while it may not be quite as good as the “real deal” done the old-fashioned way, it’s a pretty darned acceptable second. If I didn’t have a bread machine I wouldn’t have fresh, homemade bread as often as I do.  And if it wasn’t for this Blender Hollandaise Sauce recipe, I wouldn’t have Crab Eggs Benedict as often as I now plan to.  I’m really impressed.

The amount of lemon was just right, not too sour like some other sauces I've tried! It was so easy to make too! One tip is to use an egg yolk at room temperature - if it's taken right out of the refrigerator, the hot butter doesn't really cook it enough so the sauce will still end up runny.

This is a great recipe for a quick and fool proof Hollandaise, we have used it often. You can also adapt it to make a quick Bernaise if you add shallot, tarragon vinegar and fresh tarragon, when I do that I omit the lemon juice and hot sauce.

Turned out great! Hint.....make just before you need the sauce. I was silly and thought I would heat it up a bit in the microwave just before serving...the egg cooked and ruined it :( Started over.....it was really good.

This was great!! It won RAVE reviews from my husband when I used this on eggs benedict. 

I did wind up being a little sorry that I used bottled lemon juice, because it didn't have quite enough of a kick. However, a touch of fresh grated lemon zest brought it well up to snuff. I also had a bit of trouble getting it to thicken in the blender, but I believe it's because I didn't get the butter hot enough. I had to finish it off on the stove, but it turned out perfect!  Next time I'll melt the butter on the stove instead of the microwave, and wait until it's really sizzling before pouring it in.

Good overall recipe.  Used salted butter, room temp egg yolks , extra hot sauce, little garlic powder and little salt.  Used 1/2 of butter and 1/4 olive oil to cut the fat.  Added 2 Tablespoons boiling water to blender to thin and had no problems keeping combined.  Nice overall texture.  Thanks!

I have tried it multiple times, w/ heating the butter until bubbly or not, adding the butter more slowly or when it's warmer, using fresh or bottled lemon juice, fresh or older egg yolks, different speeds on my blender. It NEVER thickens, never is more than a lemon-flavored milk drink. If I could give it negative stars, I would.

I've made this recipe several times and it always comes out perfect.  I use more lemon juice than called for because I really love a strong lemon taste to my Hollandaise.  This is one of the easiest ways to make Hollandaise - after you try this method, you'll never want to go back to the old way of whisking the butter in drop by drop.  I made this this morming for Eggs Benedict - we are camping in our motorhome and this was so easy to prepare.  Yes, I keep a blender in the camper - why not? Thank you, Chellebelle for a great recipe.

This is super easy, even without a blender! I made it with my whisk and it was perfect! Just lemony enough, and waaaaaay better than those packets! I'll never hesitate to make my own again! Thanks!

This is a beautiful hollandaise sauce! I only give it 4 points because after tasting the original recipe, I felt that it needed a bit more tang, so I added an additional squirt of lemon juice and about a 1/4 tsp more of mustard. I melted the butter in the microwave until it was liquid but I realized that it wasn't hot enough (more like lukewarm). I didn't want to over heat and have it explode in the microwave (next time I'll try melting the butter at a lower power level). I decided to pour it into the blender anyway and the sauce still thickened up nicely. I wanted the sauce to be hot so I heated it in the microwave and ended up curdling it a bit. To save it, I added 1-2 tbsp of water and stirred vigorously till the mixture was smooth. I had read that somewhere but never had the opportunity to try it till now. Definitely worked like a charm! I used unsalted butter, which is what I normally have on hand, and added himalayan salt for flavouring. I also added freshly chopped chives, which seemed to bring out the butter flavour. I served this over German white asparagus and boiled potatoes. YUM! This recipe seems to be very forgiving. Next time I might melt the butter in a small pot over the stove so it's hot when I pour it into the blender (or if I'm pressed for time, of course, I'll use the microwave). Will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing, chellebelle!

SOOOOOO good!  And sooooo easy!  Loved it!  Thanks for sharing!  Used it for eggs benedict.  They were so yummy!!!
(Just take the center out of the blender lid to pour the butter in while blending to keep from splashing)

I used my hand held braun mixer with a whisk attachment to make half of this recipe.  I used 2 yolks and 1/2 T lemon juice and 2T butter.  I have only had this one other time, but this was pretty good.  The sauce did stay pretty warm in the hot water, I was impressed.

Simple and easy.  I have used this type of blender recipe for decades, and still love it.  I used it for eggs benedict but omitted the mustard and lightened up the lemon juice a bit.

Made Hollandaise this way for years, using a food processor.  Butter must be nearly boiling to thicken the sauce.  Could eat this right out of the processor bowl.

Easy, ingredients are commonly around, and tastes great!!!  I added a bit more mustard, gave a good squeeze to a fresh lemon half, and shook the hot sauce bottle more then once.  Num!!!

I needed a quick easy sauce bearnaise, so I substituted tarragon vinegar for the lemon juice & added 1 tsp. dried tarragon to the egg mixture.  Had a bit of trouble getting the sauce to thicken, so I microwaved it for 15 seconds & whisked briskly.  This turned out very nice...smooth & velvety.  Next time I think I will double the vinegar to tart it up a bit. Thanks,  this will be a keeper.

Wow, easy and delicious! We love having Eggs Benedict on the weekends, and this is my go to hollandaise sauce now. My only tweek is to cut back on the lemon juice, but that's just personal preference. Otherwise, I follow recipe to a T and it comes out perfect every single time with rave reviews from the family! And just a little safety note --  I do buy pasteurized eggs since the eggs aren't really cooked in this recipe. (Yes, you pour hot butter over the yolks, but I doubt it cooks them enough to count as 'cooked yolks'.) This is especially important if you have anyone who has a compromised immune system consuming the sauce.

Made this for breakfast on Christmas morning to have with Eggs Benedict. I was so impressed by how easy this was to make, how it didn't curdle or even look like it would and how devine it tasted. This is a recipe that I will use over and over again to make this tricky sauce. Tricky no longer though!

Our's came out a little thick but I think adding a bit more lemon juice would have done the trick.  It could not have been easier to make!

Yeah, I never realized how easy Hollandaise sauce could be.  It was delicious!  I go to a local restaurant for b-fast sometimes and they have this french skillet with homefries, onions,mushrooms, grilled chicken and eggs and on top is hollandaise sauce.  I never made it at home because I thought I would never get the sauce right.  It was perfect!!!  I am almost scared because I can't imagine how often I am going to come up for excuses to make this (not the calorie-friendly thing I need) but sometimes you just need some delicious comfort food.  I am emailing several friends this recipe cause they love the skillet as well.  Cheers

The consistancy of sauce is perfect. The flavor needs some help. Next time, maybe some dill and another dash of hot sauce. Don't get me wrong. It is a great recipe, but a little bland for my taste.

Made this sauce for eggs benedict.  Next time I will omit the mustard.  It over-powered the flavor of the sauce.  And I immersed the blender in the water that I poached my eggs in, and just added enough hot water to reach the height of the sauce and it warmed it nicely.

This turned out great... much better than the hollandaise packets or the cans you get from the store.  I didn't have dijon mustard, so I used spicy brown (I don't know if there's a difference) and left out the hot sauce.  I think that another reviewer's idea of whisking the ingredients together instead of blending would have worked even better... my end result was very thick and I think it was because it was overbeaten.

Don't Add Salt!!!  Okay, just had to get that out there, I've ruined this delectable sauce by oversalting it two times, we still ate it, but it wasn't as good as it should have been.  Seriously it is a fine line between perfect and then oversalted with this, so it's best to leave the salt out and just let each person add their own.  I used this for eggs benedict (I know, totally obvious) and found it hard to keep it from getting too hard from cooling off, so if at all possible, make all the poached eggs you need at once (egg poachers are useful) and then toast all the english muffins, the oven works good for making multiple muffins,  then start on the sauce, it comes together super duper fast and is soooo good, I could lick spoon.  Tonight I'm putting it on poached salmon, I know it will be amazing!

I was amazed at how true this hollandaise sauce turned out- it really had a great texture and was super easy to make. I think next time I'll use less or a different type of mustard because it was a little much but otherwise a great recipe!

Making Hollandaise sauce, because I rarely make it,  has always been an intimidating experience to me. I was in a rush this morning, making eggs Benedict.   I tried this recipe  in order to get brunch on the table quickly.  I used a Braun hand-blender. Given the simplicity, speed, and taste, this recipe is a no-brainer. The speed that it all comes together is so quick, I would hold off adding the melted butter in preparing the sauce until your dish is fully plated. The taste of it is so good, I will use this as my default recipe even when I’m not rushed.

I followed the recipe minus the mustard, tried it and did not like it.. added the mustard.. and did not like it. I was really excited to try this as we have eggs benedict often and always use the packs for the sauce. it tastes WAYYY different than the packs so if u LOOVE the packets you might be disappointed. Plus the fact that the yolks werent cooked at all was a little disturbing to me.

This was a huge hit at my New Years Day brunch. It was my first time making eggs benny and I was pretty intimidated by the egg poaching and the sauce.  This sauce got rave reviews from my foodies, and I will definitely be doing this more often. I did use the bubbling butter idea. Thank you so much for the recipe and the other reviews that helped lead the way!

Eggs benedict has always been an item we only eat in restaurants--not any more! This hollandaise sauce is so simple--made exactly as presented here it turned out wonderfully. I have also added some seasoned salt and used black pepper with no white pepper on hand. This made it a little bit more flavorful--just doesn't get any easier than this! Thank you!

Thanks for a great recipe!  I used a small food processor and easily made a half recipe.  It didn't thicken up too well, so I warmed it in the microwave.  It thickened unevenly, so I just plopped it all back in the processor and it was fine - thick, smooth, and warm.  My kids (12 and 9) LOVED it!

The first time I made this, the taste and texture turned out great. The second time, I think my butter wasn't hot enough to thicken the mixture so it made my sauce turn out really runny. I highly suggest you make sure your butter is super hot before SLOWLY pouring into egg mixture. Also, I think using the listed amount of lemon is appropriate. Anything less would leave this sauce bland. GREAT over asparagus!

This was my first time making hollandaise sauce and it was so simple to make! The flavors are just the right balance and goes perfectly with savory crepes. I will definitely make this again and find more recipes to go with it!

Very easy and delicious recipe!  The lemon flavor is great over asparagus for dinner, but I reduce the lemon by about half for eggs benedict.  I just don't like that much lemon on my eggs.

This was yum! Though, I must not have gotten the butter hot enough (I read a review that said if it is hot and bubbly enough before adding to the egg mixture, it should thicken up great) because it was still a tad on the thin side. Delish though. We served it over broccoli eggs benedict with a side of homemade English Muffin toast. Mmmm. It does not make a lot though. It was just enough for the two of us (topping each of our English Muffins and two fried eggs).  Definitely not 6 servings!

LOVED this!!!!  We make this all the time now, for eggs benedict on the weekends, or to put over fish or asparagus.  SO EASY.  And delicious.  If it's not thick enough I pop it in the microwave for about 10 seconds, but usually sticking the container in a bath of hot water does the trick (I use a staff mixer, so this works out perfectly).  I've tried it with lime juice, but the ratio of juice to yolk must be lower - the lime is too overpowering.  I also leave out the mustard, add a dash of worchestershire sauce, add cayene, etc. to mix things up.  When my in-laws come over they are mightily impressed with brunch :)

It is the easiest and greatest recipe for what this is.. I tried to change it a bit and not a good idea.. It is a bit lemony but it needs all the lemon to come out like hollandaise sauce.. I will make it again when we are not on a diet haha since we seem to be on one all the time now..

Followed recipe exactly as written. The end result was okay. Its very easy but I thought it was a little too lemony and too runny. At first I didn't like it but it tasted better on the eggs benedict I was making it for.

I honestly don't know why there are so many 5 star reviews. I have had Eggs Benedict many times in restaurants and this one was not to my liking. Not the savory flavor that I'm used to. I followed this recipe to a T and I am just not a fan of it at all.

I have made one similar for years, mine has 4 egg yolks and no mustard, and 2-3 T of lemon juice, salt and pepper, the key for it to thicken is make sure the butter is very hot. I am going to try the addition of mustard. I am surprised with only 1 TB of lemon juice some thought it was too lemony? This is by far the easiest way to make Hollandaise!

This was my first time ever making Hollandaise, my second time ever eating it, and eggs benedict, I think this is my new fave breakfast. I had it at a Rest. last week, and theirs tasted a little more savory, but their sauce was a little broken. 

This sauce was super easy to make and came out super smooth and a little thick. I kept it warm in a measuring cup, in a pan of warm water. It looked great, but the flavor was too lemony (and I don't think I even used a full TBL), couldn't taste any of the hot sauce (I even added an extra dash of Cholula). I also added a pinch of salt to the recipe. Even though it tasted better with the eggs benedict, I think next time I'll use less lemon juice and maybe add a dash of Worcestershire? I made this for our Father's Day breakfast, and Mr. liked it.

This was DELICIOUS! And super easy and quick to make. The reason I only gave it four stars is because it was too thick, but that might be because I used fresh eggs which are a bit denser. I made this for an Easter brunch and everyone was super impressed!

This may not be the best Hollandaise I've ever had, but it's a very, very close second. It's enough for 4 servings where each serving is 1 piece of bread, then ham, then 2 eggs. You might stretch to 6 servings. Exceptionally quick and easy. Make right after you put your eggs in to poach so there's no need to try to keep it warm. Excellent job chellebelle. Thanks so much!

This was good, I've never made or even had hollandaise sauce before. Mine turned out more of a dark yellow (but I think it was b/c I used our fresh chicken eggs). Very easy and simple to make, I used a whisk b/c I cut the recipe in half.

This is a great sauce if for no other reason than its ease of preperatioon. I didn't have dijon mustard so I used spicy brown. It's such a small quanity that I don't think it matters. I also didn't have tabasco on hand so I used ground cayenne pepper to taste and there wasn't a problem either. I would recomend never using anything but fresh lemon juice though. There is a big difference in taste if you don't. I served this sauce with eggs cooked over easy and canadian bacon to make the lazy person's benedict and got rave reviews. If you want to watch your carbs I would not have any kind of bread with it. Recipes like this are why this website is my all time favorite! Next time, I am going to make this with some eggs, asparagus and red bell pepper just to see what happens. Happy cooking!

It was a pretty good recipe, but the blender thing didn't work so well. I added about 1/4 to 1/2 c. milk to give it a better consistency. Also about a pinch or so of dill and a dash of cayenne pepper. A few more dashes of lemon juice were needed as well. I started it in the blender, but ended up putting it on the stove top and whisking it until it was smooth.

I have made this sauce dozens of times slaving over a double boiler, but I needed a faster easier way to make it for a brunch of 14 people. I found another way on the stove top on YouTube and when I went to use the stove top method on the big day I ended up cooking the eggs. SO I broke out the blender and whipped up another batch to perfection. So fast and so much easier. This will be my go to method for Hollandaise  from here on out. Thanks for posting the recipe!

This sauce was amazing. I don't know how using the double boiler method would make it turn out any better. Even my picky teen loved it!  I reminded me of the best tasting Hollandaise sauce I had once at a restaurant in Atlantic City that is no longer there.  Loved this!

Absolutely terrible. My hollandaise never thickened and then separated once I put it on my eggs. 

I'm so furious.

The Dijon addition is not traditional, but I thought it was perfect.  This is silky, rich, easy and delicious Hollandaise.  My son loves broccoli dressed with this sauce.  He calls it "cheesy sauce."  Ha ha!  I keep it warm by placing it in a small bowl over another bowl of hot water until ready to serve dinner.

This is wonderful and will become my go-to hollandaise recipe in the future.  I like a touch more lemon if serving with vegetables, but it's perfect as-is over eggs benedict.  I used it over the eggs benedict casserole instead of the packaged hollandaise, and I'm so glad I did.

OMG.  I spent HOURS in cooking classes making this sauce and this is about 1 million times easier and just as good!  Let the eggs get to room temp before making.  Eggs actually don't need to be put in the fridge, but whatever.  THANK YOU!  Doing a crab cake Benedict tomorrow with this sauce.

Terrific recipe! Tastes just like "the real thing" and WAY better than those horrible little mix packets. I did notice that 3 egg yolks tended to make the consistency a bit too thick, so I've used only 2 each time I made it since; that works best for me. Make sure your butter is HOT. Wait until your eggs are already poached and ready before you run the blender, to keep the consistency pour-able. Enjoy!

Made the recipe as is, except I added a little salt & pepper.  Soo good and easy to make.  It is a keeper!  My family does not like asparagus, but when I drizzled this sauce over it, they loved it!

This did not thicken hardly at all for me. I cook a lot and the directions are straightforward, so I don't know what the deal is. I heated my butter until it was bubbling and poured it in a thin stream while blending as directed, but it was very thin when finished. I enjoyed the flavor, but might cut back just a touch on the lemon juice next time. Oh, and I'll use the old-fashioned double boiler method to get the thickness.

Super yummy and so easy! A great hollandaise sauce you can make in a few minutes. Be careful not to overdo it on the lemon juice tho, otherwise it can taste weird, but a great recipe to keep on hand!

This recipe is perfect! Caution... I tired to keep this warm by putting the sauce in a small pot on very low heat.... it cooked the eggs and made the sauce a little too thick and lumpy. Don't make this mistake! I won't do that again!

I made this again, following the instruction precisely. It was perfect, and thickens a bit when it cools. It is tremendously important that the butter be piping hot when it goes in because that is what is cooking and thickening the eggs. The lemon juice reacts, as well, and helps to thicken the eggs.

It wasn't quite thick enough so I put the mixed hollandaise sauce back into the microwave for 10 seconds on high and stirred. I noticed it began to scramble a bit around the edges where it got hotter, so I put the blender back on and it smoothed it out perfectly.

Next time I will omit the hot sauce and the mustard, only because I would like a more pure tasting hollandaise - eggs, lemon and butter. That is all one really needs for an excellent hollaindaise sauce.

Thanks for the recipe!

I made this and it tasted good but it didn't thicken enough and I'm not sure it got hot enough to kill any microbes in the egg.  I didn't measure the the temperature but if the eggs and lemon etc. are all cold or cool I don't  believe it gets hot enough to be safe.  I usually use the bowl over boiling water method with a good whisk or for a big batch an immersion blender.  I don't plan to use this recipe again.  This is another time that quick and easy is not better.  Luckily nobody got sick.

Had this made for me this a.m. for Mother's Day.  It was very good.  Probably cut back on the mustard next time. That is the first taste you get.  After that you don't notice it much anymore but first bite was very mustardy.  Will definitely make it again.

I've been using this recipe for decades and it always comes out perfect! By far the easiest holladaise ever. You do lose a little bit of the depth of flavor you get using the double boiler method, but if your tight on time and need a good quality sauce right away, you can't lose with this one.

We tried once with a regular blender and it didn't work for us, but we tried again with a hand blender and it changed over immediately.  So delicious and easy!!!

This was great!  It was my first time ever making hollandaise and I'll admit I was nervous, but it was for naught.  Did everything as written, except that I subbed Franks Red Hot for Tabasco.  Definitely will use again.

Good basic recipe easy to execute, but way too lemony.  Didn't taste very much like the Hollandaise sauce I buy in the store.  Will try it again though with less lemon juice.

This was my first attempt at hollandaise at home and it was a success!  For the two of us I used 2 egg yolks, 1 tbsp of dill, 1/4 teaspoon of the mustard, 1 tbsp of ff half and half, a little hot sauce, and 1/4 cup of melted butter.  Seriously, I was so proud!  Thank you :)

The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I followed the directions to a T and served straight away, but the sauce still didn't seem warm enough.  Other than the temp, this was wonderful, my husband couldn't get enough!

My first Hollandaise from scratch and it turned out really well! I didn't have Dijon so I used a small amount of powdered mustard instead. Bright and lemony and very easy to make. Thank you.

Used hard margarine instead of butter and it was effective... but did not provide the same kind of taste.  Needed a bit of salt and lots of pepper.

It was perfect, and it saved me a LOT of time whisking over a double boiler.  I couldn't believe how good it was because it was so simple...I'm never making it any other way again.  And yes, this recipe does make quite a generous amount.

Delicious!  So mush easier and better than using the tradional method.  Very creamy.  Reduced the amount of lemon by about half and would use unsalted butter next time, for my taste.  No more double boilers!

Easy sauce to make. It had been a long time since I last had this sauce...don't remember it being as spicy as mine was. It was probably my measuring....I just eyeball things! Excellent served over a bed of steamed asparagus. Thanks for this recipe!!

Loved the ease of the sauce and the amount of time to make it.  Made it as the recipe suggests and thought it needed to be a thicker.  Good flavor, but next time I will try some of the suggestions that others have made to add a bit more flavor.k

Super easy..  the butter must be VERY hot for it to thicken.  Added about 1/4 teas salt for flavor (I think seasoning salt or Cajun seasoning would work well & will try this next time)  and substituted a pinch of cayenne for the hot pepper sauce because we didn't have any.   Could also sub regular mustard or dry mustard for the Dijon.

I made a 1/2 recipe (using 2 egg yolks) and a hand blender as suggested by previous comments. I needed Hollandaise Sauce in order to make a 1/2 recipe of the the allrecipes "Asparagus & Mushroom Puff Pastry Pie". The Hollandaise Sauce was fast, easy and the best tasting that I have ever made or eaten. I didn't have tabasco, so I used a light sprinkling of Cajun Seasoning. I also used Pasteurized Eggs to avoid salmonella. This is the recipe for no-fail Hollandaise Sauce!

Very quick, very easy. The taste was pretty good too! Be careful that your butter isn't too hot or it can start to curdle the egg yolks.

*huh* I do not know if I may did something wrong but this did not taste at all like the comforting Sauce Hollandaise I know from home (Germany). It was more like a buttery eggsauce and pretty bland.

We make Eggs Benedict for every Mother's day and Father's day and have always used a store bought package to mix our hollandaise.  This year I thought I'd try it from scratch even though I'd been told it's tricky.  Well this was as easy as it gets and it tasted wonderful.  My husband liked it too.  I'll never go back to the packages now that I know how easy this is.  I made mine using a kitchenaid immersion blender. Much easier clean up then a large blender. I also had to use margerine as I forget to get butter and it wasn't a problem.

Easy,quick,excellent! What more can I say ? Fattening with 1/2 c butter? Don't eat Hollandaise sauce then!!!! (And I watch my weight constantly, but 1 or 2 times a year won't kill me!)

Very tasty.I had an upside down blender (one of those bullet type blenders) which I thought would be more efficient since it was a small quantity.  Even with putting things in all at one shot it was very tasty.  I added a dash more Tabasco as a matter of preference and it was delicious!

This is the easiest hollandaise recipe ever, and very tasty.  I have been using this method for hollandaise for years and it always works, as long as your butter is hot enough and you use at least three yolks.  I have had no luck making a smaller amount.  This made our lobster benedict a real treat!!

Not quite like my mom's, but so much easier.  I thought it could have been a bit thicker.  I omitted the mustard and hot sauce and used white wine instead, which I prefer.

I love using this recipe and method.  Usually I change the recipe some and make a beautiful bearnaise sauce.  That is what I prefer on my steak oscar.  Sometimes I leave in the dijon for a different take on bearnaise.

Thank the Lord!! I’ve spent a decade of my marriage attempting to recreate my mother-in-laws Hollandaise for my wife on special occasions. Inevitably I would get my heat wrong with a double boiler. This was easy, quick, 1M times less frustrating.

This was good, and definitely easy, but a tad bit lemony for our taste. Next time I may try 2 tsp instead of one tablespoon of lemon juice. I had the yolks and other ingredients blended and ready, and melted the butter on the stove, as I try to avoid microwaving as much as possible.  At the last minute, I cranked up the heat to get the butter bubbly, and was able to easily time this to be ready the moment the asparagus was. For those who had theirs end up runny, I imagine it had to do with the temperature of the butter. Ours was the perfect consistency and texture. Will definitely make again with a tad less lemon.

This was so easy and it tasted great!  I used a submerging hand held blender which made it easy to make and for easy clean up.  I won't shy away from making Eggs Benedict again with this fool proof recipe.

Super easy preparation, great texture for the result. It was more lemon-y than any other hollandaise I’ve had, so I’m giving it four stars as-is. Next time I’ll just add less, but I like to follow the recipe exactly the first time (shocking, I know). I used a submersible blender because it was more convenient. Thanks for sharing!

We have eggs Benedict every Easter, and make them for a crowd. For years I used the Hollandaise double boiler recipe from The Joy of Cooking. This year we tried blender Hollandaise, which has the same ingredients as Joy of Cooking except for the mustard. We did leave the mustard out of ours due to taste preference. This recipe is quick and easy, and makes a great Hollandaise. I would agree with other reviewers that one batch is probably be too small for a regular blender. I used our hand held blender for one batch, and the regular blender for a double batch. The butter must be almost boiling for the Hollandaise to thicken. Mine was not thick enough, so I poured the Hollandaise from the blender into my double boiler to thicken and keep warm until serving. It was perfect. This recipe cuts down on the cook time and constant whisking needed by traditional cooking methods, with the same results. Five stars!

I have been using almost identical recipe since the 70's. Mine doesn't call for Dijon, and uses 4 egg yolks.  Be sure the butter is HOT or it won't "cook" the yolks and thicken properly.... to reheat any that might be left over, I pour cold sauce into a small-ish bowl and set it in a pan of very warm water (Hot will curdle it). Stir until it warms up to lukewarm.  It only needs to come to about lukewarm if you are going to be pouring over hot food.

Easy Peasy, very good.  Did not use the dijon mustard, it doesn't need it, didn't use the hot sauce, but a dash might not be so bad...or a sprinkle of chili powder.  After blending I did put into a prewarmed small saucepan, and while stirring heat to a warmer temp, it was super smooth and very simple.  It did get thick so next time I might add some water.  The lemon, egg yolks and butter alone made a great sauce the blender made it effortless.

I really did enjoy this hollandaise sauce.  It was super easy to make.  The only change I would make is to add another tablespoon of fresh lemon juice to give a hint more tanginess.  Thank you for sharing.

I have been making Hollandaise like this for years.  One hint - if the butter isn't hot enough and the sauce does not thicken just microwave at 60% power in 5 sec increments until it is the desired consistency.  Don't overdo it this way because it will cook the eggs - you just want to heat it up enough to get it to the thickening point.

Super easy! While the dijon and pepper are not necessary (sauce is delicious without it) I do like those additions. Excellent way to use up egg yolks and can be stored for a longer period of time than completely raw yolks. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this a few nights ago to go with buttered steamed asparagus. When my husband tried it he thought that I had spent a long time making it on the stove top! He even said that it was the best hollandaise sauce he's had. We have eaten at many very nice restaurants in Charleston that specialize in brunch foods, so this was high praise! Will use this recipe often! I used a stick blender to blend it right in the container I was storing it in.
Oh, and we finished it last night, just put the container n some warm/hot water and stir. It thins back into a nice sauce. Although, the chilled sauce was like a really silky spread that was great on ciabatta bread.

This was good, considering it was made in the blender and was so easy, but it didn't really compare to real hollandaise sauce. I used to make hollandaise sauce 3-4 times a week, so it's not that hard, but this was super easy. I made it because I have really bad arthritis and can't stir like I used to, and frankly, I don't trust my husband as a main chef in the kitchen. He's a great sous chef though, don't get me wrong. So I may or may not make this again. I put it on pan fried salmon. It was really good for what it was, though, and for how easy it was.

Easy as can be.  Tastes like the classic recipe it is.  Need the Dijon to make it so.  Great consistency using this method.

Great easy recipe and must for everyone! If you want to add a new twist use fresh lime juice instead of lemon... Then top you eggs Benedict with avocado & chopped cilantro...

Yes, this is a great and easy recipe.  The reviews panned the mustard and the hot sauce.  I used mustard powder and would also use cayenne.  So easy.

There's no real taste to it and the mustard made it worse. I added extra lemon juice and salt to make it taste. The amount is not as advertised. I had enough for one serving. The blender also wastes a lot of sauce and the 3 egg yolk isn't enough liquid to blend in my blender. I do not recommend this recipe for this amount. Yes it thickened just fine.

This is GREAT.  Before I saw this I was so put off by the precision of the original recipe. The only ingredients I used were butter, egg yolks, and salt and doing the hot butter-blender-slow stream method, I had the BEST hollandaise sauce I've ever had.  Thank you for posting this. I'm so excited to be able to have this whenever I want!

Excellent recipe.   Consistency and flavor varies dramatically, however, depending on the butter you use.  For example, if I use the Daily Chef brand of SALTED butter sold by Sams Clubs, I get a very tasty, reasonably thick result that thickens more as it cools.  If I use Countryside Creamery UNsalted butter (Aldi's?) the result is runny like water, stays that way, and has almost no flavor.  

This is a fabulous, quick, go-to recipe.  If you are not happy with your result, try a different brand of butter.  Just sayin'....

I just made this recipe this morning; did not care for it at all.  I knew instantly that my family would not like it, soooooo I doctored it up a bit; I added a dash of granulated garlic powder; onion powder; black pepper and finely grated some Parmesan cheese, Voila, IT WAS THEN VERY DELICIOUS...  Hope this helps out...

Overall I think it is very good.  Very easy to make but make sure the butter is not just melted but hot; otherwise, it doesn't thicken.  Also, the amount of butter has to be 1/2 cup as well.  

The only reason I gave it 4 stars vs. 5 is because we found it too lemony.  Next time, I'll reduce it by 1/2.  I don't have Dijon mustard so I used Ballpark mustard instead and it still tasted fine.  I also added a little salt at the end.

I'll definitely use this recipe again!

This is delicious. I used salted butter, the recipe does not specify but I think it needs the salt. I also prefer a pinch of black pepper rather than hot pepper sauce.

I have been using this recipe for years and find it easy and good.  Use a stick blender for easier clean up.  Use unsalted butter.  If you find that your final product is runny, use four egg yolks next time.  My daughter is a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America and she uses this recipe when she doesn't have the extra time for the "real" thing.

Great Recipe! This turned out delicious. I tweaked the recipe a bit. I used dried mustard instead of regular mustard, omitted the tabasco, and added a half teaspoon of salt.

OMG, this is fabulous!  This is the first time  I've made Hollandaise sauce and it was easy and so good!  I left out the mustard because I wanted a more traditional flavor.  I used a hand blender and it worked out great. Thanks for a great recipe!

Better than store bought by far. I used about a tbsn and a half of lime juice. Easy and delicious. Thanks for the great recipe.  By the wat use a soda bottle to separate the egg yolk.  Just squeeze it and then suck out the yolk.

I tried this recipe using a wand mixer and it turned out way too watery. I was very disappointed. I then tried the recipe for the microwave hollandaise sauce and it worked so much better as far as thickness goes (I always adjust the taste for most recipes anyway).  I'll use that one from now on. It only requires a whisk.  Talk about easy cleanup!

I gave this 4 stars because it's a wonderful base recipe. I did change it to suit my taste: 5 egg yolks, dash Sriracha, 1/4 tsp dried tarragon, dash black pepper. I kept the mustard. I used 3/4 T fresh lemon juice. 

For those feeling unsafe about uncooked eggs -- to kill salmonella, eggs have to reach 160 degrees Fahrenheit, until both yolk and white are firm. The blender method is no less unsafe than making hollandaise sauce the water-bath way; neither will kill salmonella.

I've been making Hollandaise in a blender for years, but was drawn to this recipe because of the Dijon.  Dijon didn't seem to make any difference from the recipe I've always used and I missed the cayenne from a traditional Hollandaise. I had to more than double the lemon juice to get it to the proper flavor. This one did thicken nicely though. I used to use only two yolks but I will increase that to three from now on.  Recipe needs some adjusting for flavor but the technique and texture are spot on.

Easy, easy.  And no double broiler...yes!  I used a smidge of sharp mustard in lieu of the dijon and it was great.  I will make this again for sure!

We really liked it, but next time I will cut back some, on the butter and increase the lemon juice to 2 tablespoons. Didn't have any Tabasco, but it turned out great without it!  I will definitely use this recipe again!

I loved the flavor of this sauce, but it did not thicken for me at all in the blender.  I had to transfer it to a double boiler.  Next time, I'll just start out with a double boiler.  Thanks for the recipe though - I did enjoy the flavor!

Okay, so I attempted to make Hollandaise Sauce and I failed miserably but then I found this recipe and this recipe is a KEEPER.  So, easy to make and will make it again and again.  I say to those of you that have not yet attempted to make Hollandaise Sauce make this before attempting to make it any other way - save your time, yolks, and your sanity.  Thanks for sharing with us!

Excellent and easy.  Be sure you use fresh butter.  Used on "My Crabcakes" with poached eggs and English muffins for Crab Cakes Benedict.  A total winner! Would use again for asparagus, etc. etc.

I've made this one twice now.  First time a 1/2 recipe, and the second time a full recipe.  While the TASTE of this hollandaise is excellent, it's totally runny!  It has the consistency of soup.  I couldn't seem to get it to thicken up no matter how long I blended it.  I guess this one is just too simple to be true!

Very easy Hollandaise Sauce! I just got back from a glorious restaurant inn that made a fantastic sauce, so my review is a little biased. I thought it had a great consistency and flavor, however it didn't have enough kick or spice to it. Also, it just seems like a lot of butter, but I guess that is how the sauce is made anywhere. Next time I'll add more mustard and hot pepper sauce. :D

LOVED this! Turned put perfectly. Make sure the butter is bubbly hot when slowly adding...if not, it may be a little on the runny side. Also, can be on the lemony side so you can adjust to taste if you prefer it thay way. Quick, easy, and oh-so-good!

I have to admit I was a little skeptical of this recipe but it worked out great! I didn't have any fresh lemon juice so I substituted white wine vinegar and that was just fine. I used it to top salmon benedict! Yum!

Very easy to make recipe that turned out great!    Didn't have regular Dijon but substituted Horseradish Dijon and a few pinches of Cayenne.   If you like a unique flavor, try it.

OK. I have always made traditional hollandaise and not often because I was afraid of it not turning out.  Well, never again.  This was so easy and so quick.  I read the reviews and let the butter get very hot and bubbly.  I also used my immersion blender instead of the standard blender. I served it with baked fish and there is plenty left over.  Yum.

Dont't buy those dry mixes!  This is the best!!  I hadn't made homemade hollandaise in a long time till I found this recipe.  It is so easy and absolutely delish.  One tweak--I made it according to the recipe (hot hot butter mixed in) but it was still a little runny.  We didn't eat for a while and I needed to heat up the sauce.  I put it in the microwave for about 30 seconds at low power and when I got it out, I whisked it a little and it was perfect--so thick, creamy, and delicious.  It was definitely the star of the meal.  I served it over steamed broccoli and my husband was licking the plate.

I love this Hollandaise sauce...genius move putting it in a blender or cuisinart to get a really nice texture and consistency. Personally, I chose to leave out the dijon. My secret ingredient is adding a dab of Franks Red Hot in lieu of Tabasco. It gives it a more subtle bite than the tabasco in my opinion. Otherwise, I follow the recipe and directions to the T.

It was a great, easy way to make hollandaise sauce! I did however add one more tablespoon of lemon juice, my boyfriend likes it lemony and this has a very mild lemon flavor.

Happy 2012!
What better way to start the New Year than a Sunday brunch, complete with eggs Benedict?  This recipe made the task really easy, a great Hollandaise sauce you can make in about a minute.  

I doubled the lemon juice and let the yolks come to room temperature, otherwise made the recipe as is.  This recipe is a keeper.  Give it a try!

If you're doing Weight Watchers, the points plus value is 5 per serving and totally worth every point.

Made this this morning with poached eggs for Christmas breakfast and it was soooo simple!  

I did make it without the dijon, which was an accident, not intentional - I wrote the recipe down in a hurry instead of printing it out, and only just now discovered I omitted the mustard! But even without it was wonderful. I nuked the stick of butter for one minute in microwave in a 2 cup Pyrex glass measuring cup, then drizzled it slowly into a tall glass vessel holding the other ingredients, and used an immersion blender for whipping. I think in total this took me about 3 minutes to make! No difference in taste/texture for me from 'traditional' method. Fantastic tasting, super easy to make/clean up from, recipe is definitely a keeper!

Deeeeeeelicious.  I scaled this to 4 servings, served it over roasted asparagus spears, and it came out wonderfully!  I will make this again and again.  It's possibly dangerous for my waistline to know that I'm only 5 minutes away from yummy homemade Hollandaise sauce any time I want.  :D

I am a chef and I have cooked for many years. And this was a very easy way to cook this and tastes great. I just add a pinch of sugar. I know that sound crazy but you have to have balance and if you put just the right amount you will not tasted it. It just gives it a rounder taste.

This makes our Saturday Brunch SO amazing. My husband makes the eggs and I toast the muffins and butter everything and make the sauce.
It's creamy, tangy, and makes me feel like I'm using up my calories in the BEST way possible...

I had lost my grandmothers recipe for hollandaise and this was as close as I could get although I did add a little more hot sauce and white pepper for a little more flavor. My husband fell in love with it I make it at least once a week.... Thank you

Quite tasty.  I used bottled lemon juice so doubled the amount and used 4 yolks.  Heated butter in microwave until popping and sizzling.  Just as good as double boiler method although a little thinner.

Thank heavens I found this - my son asked for Hollandaise sauce and the first few recipes I found looked like a royal pain in the butt with the double boiling and all. Maybe I'll try the longer way for a special occasion, but for a mid week after work artichoke request, this was great. I threw in a clove of garlic just cuz I wanted to, and I'm sure it would be good with any number of tweaks.

I made it "as is" and the dijon gave the sauce an odd flavor that no one liked.  I made it again with 4 eggs and 2 T lemon juice-much better.  I will use this again with the slight adjustments.

MMM-MMM ! This was so tasty and easy to make. The hot sauce gave it an extra zing without being overpowering. I usually use a packaged mix. Thankfully I couldn't find one this year. My asparagus never tasted better!

Absolutely Delicious!  I did not want to take the time for the double boiler and this was wonderful with asparagus.  I cut down on the lemon juice and added some lemon zest and a bunch of dried tarragon.  I could have licked the plate.

I have to say I am very impressed! I attempted to make Hollandaise sauce the old fashioned way (double broiler style) and it turned out an utter failure. Then I ran across this recipe and the video. I was a skeptic, but after the previous failure I decided to try it. I was so surprised when it turned out perfect! I left out the mustard, but still felt like it had enough flavor.

Oh Yeah, that is what I am talking about!  Maybe too easy, because I am thinking I will be making a BUNCH and it is loaded with butter!!!  Maybe I will have to limit myself to one batch a week.  Bummer that.  Had a little left over, so I put it in the fridge and then topped some white rice the next evening.  Have I said YUM??

Very easy but a little bland.   I'm surprised it didn't call for any salt or Worcestershire sauce.   I'll be adding that in next time.

I would give this recipe 5 star, except for one thing the sauce was a bit thick; however, you'll probably never experience the separation you may experience with other Hollandaise recipes. I believe it was the Dijon mustard that made the recipe... I like red pepper to replace the hot sauce, but I'm big fan of red pepper!

When serving right away this is a fantastic and simple way to make Hollandaise.  I put this on left over steak and bread from an upscale dinner the night before and people still rave about it.

Very good, easy to make. The hot sauce just adds a little flavor, not hot at all. Thanks!

Have been doing the low carb thing and was craving Hollandaise, but did not want to cook!  This recipe is excellent - I added a dash of Worcestershire sauce. Yum.  Excellent w/eggs & canadian bacon (eggs benedict w/o eng. muffin!); can't wait to try it on veggies!

I really liked the ease of this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and thought it tasted too buttery for a hollandaise. After it was completed (and tasted), I added about another 1/2 tsp. dijon mustard which actually brought out the lemon flavor.  But it still tasted too buttery.  Next time I will try another reviewer's suggestion and use 4 yolks and may reduce the butter by 2-3 tblsp.  BTW, my husband loved it.

10/24/15 - Made this again...and again I added a bit more Dijon mustard (about 1/2 tsp).  Didn't add the extra yolk since it was being made for 2 servings...still thought it tasted too buttery.  BUT....it is simple and quick.

It has all been said before, but  this is a fast, easy, and great tasting sauce! Served over asparagus with a pork tenderloin. Guest were amazed to see me whip up the sauce so quickly. They really think I'm a great cook now!!

This was my first time making Hollandaise sauce - it was easy and turned out great!  I added about half a teaspoon of dried dill, YUM!!  I put it over steamed asparagus and I'll put it over scrambled eggs for breakfast.  Great recipe!!

The easiest hollandaise!  I have never made a hollandaise before, frankly I was too scared to.  My husband begged me to recreate this cajun breakfast skillet that we had at a hotel.  I used this recipe, using 4 egg yolks as suggested by others, and simply added about 2 tsp. of cajun seasoning and a dash of cayenne.  It was perfect!

I've never used a double boiler either and used a blender when my sauce separated, but Chellebelle's method was a great idea to blend as a default.

I'd never made Hollandaise before and decided to try it on a whim to top steamed broccoli - turned out great. I had a hard time keeping it warm in water, though, and it scrambled a bit. I guess it should be used immediately. Oh, and I used my stand mixer rather than a blender because it's what I have, and it turned out just fine I think! I'll use this recipe again with no other modifications. Thanks, Chellebelle.

Easy and fast! I am a chef and I shunned those that did not do it the old way on a double-boiler and I see I was wrong. You can get the same consistency with this easy recipe. Thank you.

Very simple. Very good. I like mustard, so I used a dash more. It made it very mustardy, so stick to the recipe the first time to see if you like it. I love this sauce on a poached egg white and toast sandwich.

Easy and tasty. I "halved" it for 2 people using 2 yolks, 1/8 tsp dijon, juice from 1/2 a lemon, 5 Tbsp butter, and 1/8 tsp cayenne in place of the hot sauce.

This was really easy to make but the taste was really mellow. A lot like authentic hollandaise? probably what it's supposed to taste like. But I am spoiled by restaurant and packaged hollandaise which have a lot more flavor.

I really can't put a star value on this yet,cuz I made this to what a user said and it turned out way to lemony. I'll put 5 though for great consistency and easiness. Anyways, Do not listen to the reviews to double the lemon, I did and I could barely put it in my mouth, and I love lemon! As for the consistency it turned out great and I just put the ingredients in my magic bullet, mixed, nuked the butter in microwave poured it in the bullet, mixed again, warmed it up for about 15 seconds in microwave and it was fine.

if the rating was based only on ease of preparation, this would definitely get 5 stars however as is, the final result not thick enough for our liking and we did not care for the dijon.  I will absolutely try it again but without the dijon and find a way to get it thicker.  I hate complicating this sauce since the beauty of it is that it doesn't have to be cooked but I think to get a thick sauce I'll have to cook it and add a bit of cornstarch or flour.

Very good as written.  I found the addition of dijon a bit too tangy along with the lemon juice.  I have since used 1 teaspoon of cream in place of the dijon to wonderful results. Very creamy consistency.  I think the amount of lemon juice is adequte, although another 1/2 tablespoon wouldnt hurt.  I also add a dash of kosher salt for more flavor.  I put this sauce on everything - steak, fish, chicken, any vegetable.  Delicious and rich.

I did omit the dijon mustard just because I didn't have any and it still turned out amazing and so so easy.  I will try it with the dijon when I get a chance to get to the store.  Amazing recipe.  I'll never make hollandaise sauce any other way again.

Tastes great and is super easy.  The second time I added a finely diced shallot to the butter as it was melting - added great flavor.

yum! I made mine in a food processor and it was sooo delicious. Came out the perfect consistency. The first time i made it i tried to cut it in half but it didnt thicken right. I assumed it was because there was less hot butter to thicken it. I melted/simmered my butter in a sauce pan then immediately transferred to a liquid measuring cup and used that to add the steady stream of hot butter into food processor. I also added pepper instead of tobasco. Im very hollandaise picky but this recipe is great and its so easy!

I'm picky about Hollandaise, and this recipe worked fantastic the first time! Couldn't be better. I didn't have Dijon, but the "spicy brown mustard" I had was delicious in the recipe. To keep it warm, I kept the blender glass in a pot of hot running water. I used Earth Balance non-dairy vegan butter (because of someone's allergy). The butter blended well.

This recipe saved me at the neighborhood potluck!  A quick steaming of asparagus and zip-zip this recipe in the blender.  DONE!  In less than ten minutes.  If you need to reheat the sauce before serving, don't use a microwave or you will end up with a lemon-flavored omelet.  Just sit the sauce (in a jar) in very hot water and stir to get all parts warm again.

When my mom first got an Osterizer (in the '50s)she began making Hollandaise this way.  It is so light compared to the gloppy stuff they serve in some restaurants.  I once was pressed into making Eggs Benedict for a friend's birthday brunch.  With no recipe but the one in my memory, I was able to reproduce a pretty good facsimile of the blender Hollandaise.  I'm glad to have the actual recipe now.

I'm not normally a fan of hollandaise but this was truly delicious. I made it to go with eggs Benedict and cleaned my plate! I didn't use lemon juice cause I really don't like it and since I didn't have dijon mustard I tried spicy brown mustard instead and the flavor was perfect. I'll make this for my husband for valentines breakfast!

I have made hollandaise over a double boiler, and I probably never will again after trying this recipe. So easy to prepare, nice light flavor, not too overpowering, great consistency-airy and light.  We had over smoked salmon eggs benedict. Best New Years breakfast ever!

This was my first attempt at making my own Hollandaise sauce and it came out very nicely!  I used it over some fresh steamed brussels sprouts, and the taste of this sauce was a nice compliment to them.  I liked the nice tangy flavor, and you can't complain at all about the easy preparation!  I did find that the sauce thickened pretty quickly, and was a little thicker than I'm accustomed to, but all in all I was happy with how it came out.  I'll definately make this again, and experiment with some of my favorite herbs to give it my own twist.  Thank you!

This is super easy to make and tastes so good!  My husband is used to having his hollandaise sauce from the restaurant a bit blander, and was pleasantly surprised to find out how full of flavor this one was.  We really liked it over our breakfast crepes, thanks!

I gave this 2 stars because it didn't have a bad taste, but it just wasn't a hollandaise sauce at all to me.  It wasn't much more than a medium for distributing butter, and not really an effective one at that because it wasn't very thick.  I would have liked butter just as much, with maybe a squirt of lemon while saving myself having to wash the blender parts.

Very very easy and really quick, but I found it a little bland.  I added thyme and rosemary, used tiger sauce instead of hot sauce (it's all I had) and added a drop of lemon extract.  That gave me the flavor the original recipe was missing.

flavor was okay, but what a mess! anytime i tried to open the top of the blender even the teeniest bit to pour the butter, egg yolk spurted everywhere. next time i might try using my kitchen aid and whisk attachment. also, if you use unsalted butter, you'll want to add a little salt for depth of flavor.

wow, i didn't think it would taste as good as the double boiler method but it was perfect!  Just be careful when using lime instead of lemon juice like I did.  Lime is of course more sour so use less.

I have never had Hollandaise Sauce so I have nothing to compare this to. I thought it was good. I served it over a toasted english muffin with poached eggs and ham. Thanks for posting this simple and good recipe.

This was easy and yummy!  I'm not a big fan of super lemony sauces so I cut the lemon juice in half and it was perfect.

Quick and easy.  If you can seperate eggs and run a blender, you can make this.  A little too lemony, but still good.

This is the EASIEST on earth!  I am an experienced cook, but I always shied away from Hollandaise.  But not any more.

We now have Sunday Brunch at our house, and our friends go nuts over my Eggs Benedict!

The only change I would make for this recipe is not quite the full amount of lemon juice...was just a tad on the too lemony side...otherwise, easy, foolproof and just as good as any restaurant!

I didn't follow the recipe procedures, however, I followed the ingredients.  I tried to whisk it instead of blending it.  It turned out thin so I took it to a double boiler and it turned out fine.  I'm sure that if I had used a blender it would have been thick enough. I'm rating it four stars because it lacked the rich flavor that I am used to in Hollandaise.  The lemon flavor was great, but it lacked depth.  Great on artichokes.  This recipe is a keeper.

This was a quick and easy hollandaise sauce.  Although I love hollandaise, I rarely made it before because it was a hassle.  Making it in the blender is much easier.  I'll be making this often.  It's great over steamed asparagus.

Very yummy. Had a Sunday morning craving for Eggs Benedict with smoked salmon and this was the perfect sauce. Too lazy to dig out the blender so I whisked the ingredients the old fashioned way in a stainless steel mixing bowl and it came out great. Kept the sauce warm by placing the bowl over a saucepan I was using to poach the eggs. This kep the sauce warm and creamy. Soo many calories, but soooo worth it!

Quick, easy and delicious! I used white wine in place of the lemon juice and added almost 2 tbsp instead of one. A little salt and pepper and this was smooth and light.

Good recipe, I did the same things just with a whisk in a bowl. A little too much butter for me so I used 1/4 cup of butter instead. Other than that, nice hollandaise!

This "Blender Hollandaise Sauce" recipe is a keeper! The sauce has a wonderful tangy Dijon flavor, and it is super easy to make.  My hot sauce had a lot of vinegar in it, so next time I think I would add heat with cayenne pepper instead for less sourness (better with lemon juice only). Thank you chellebelle for sharing your recipe.

My go to recipe. After heating the butter, I whisk it really well. My hubby works the immersion blender while I pour the butter in a slow and thin stream, which allows the eggs and fat to emulsify and thicken perfectly.

I made this tonight with a few small changes but it turned out amazing. I didn’t have Dijon so i used yellow mustard. I also added a few splashes of Worcestershire. Best hollendaise I’ve ever had.

This recipe is a very good substitute in a pinch! I usually make the McCormick brand hollandaise sauce because I like the taste and it's easy to do. This was equally as easy and when I had my butter already melted on the stove ready for my packet, I realized I misplaced the packet. So I quickly searched for a quick and easy recipe to compensate. I already had the perfect amount of butter. All I added were the egg yokes, dijon, and the lemon to the blender and then poured in my already hot butter! We didnt have any hot sauce, but I liked the way this turned out. 

I think it almost tastes like McDonalds breakfast sauce, which I'm sad that they discontinued. So now I have a great recipe to use in a pinch or when I crave that same taste!

When I make this next time I will add just a little less dijon as it's quite powerful!

Great hollandaise, easy to make, tastes decadent. Will use this recipe for years to come. I did not put hot sauce in mine. Instead, I used a little cayenne pepper.

I made it and it tasted great but I saw no point in the blender, it was extra work and cleaning. Just make it right in the pan on the stove to start with.

I'd give this 1-star for the blender part, I'd give it 5-stars for ease and taste.

I've made this several times now without the blender. I make this for my family of four on weekend mornings. I use 4 egg yolks and just add a bit more of the other ingredients and we have just enough sauce for (4) english muffins, 2 half covered english muffins for Eggs Benedict for each of us. If you like more sauce and are making more than 4 muffins (8 halves) you may need to make a double batch.

It is all a matter of taste, make it how you like it, tweak it until you own it. For us, the mustard and hot sauce make this sauce prefect.

I use a large 4 cup Pyrex container right over a burner on the stove adding a little heat as needed. This saves me the extra mess with the blender. If timing is an issue just add a bit of water to reconstitute the sauce and mix and warm as you go. They are egg yolks after all, they will harden a bit if you let them sit after warming the sauce. a little water seems to have had no effect on the taste, I may try milk next time if needed....

I made it and because I did not have Dijon mustard I used the classic french‘s
And I did not have Tabasco etc I left it out but just used salt and Pepper. We were 2 people and made 2 eggs Benedict each. No sauce left. I‘d double for 4 people..
It was heavenly!

There was some trouble with the egg yolk reaching the blender blades but adding another seemed to solve the issue. Easiest hollindaise you can make for sure. Will certainly make again

SUPER easy and delicious! 

A few tips: if you melt the butter in the microwave, heat it on high for one minute covered with a napkin. Let it cool for a moment, then stir it, and heat it another minute on high covered with a napkin. The butter will be super hot when you pour it into the  blender.

Great recipe! I heat the butter in a pan instead of microwave (my butter always "explodes" in microwaves). Melted until bubbling, put out the fire and added to blender. Perfect!

I had more success with this recipe than the the classic method of making it in a double boiler. The only change I made was to sprinkle in a dash of cayenne instead of the hot sauce. The flavor was good however it was too thin and the sauce was a bit cold even though I used it right away.  I will likely try this again until I get it to my liking.

I often substitute 1-2 pinches of cayenne pepper instead of Tabasco sauce. My BF, who is a poached egg lover, had only previously had Eggs Benny at a chain restaurant and was convinced he didn't like hollandaise sauce. He is now a believer...

Definite five stars for both simplicity and taste. I have tried the double boiler with moderate success in the past but why bother whisking when a blender can do a better job? I found mine thickened perfectly after sitting in a hot bath for a bit and I have no idea why I never thought to hold it like that before. Awesome sauce!

Easy to make as directed. Warming in pan of water worked but better when a little fresher

I made this a year and a half ago and it turned out perfectly. Even those who didn’t like hollandaise sauce, loved this recipe. I’m rating it now because I tried a different recipe on this site today that was beyond disgusting. Giving credit where it is due.

This was so yummy and so easy!! No separation what so ever! My son and I had been looking for an easy one but they all separated until now. Now, I can make eggs Benedict in no time! Can’t wait to try it for more things.

I found this kind of tasteless as written.  It could have been the eggs too though as sometimes store bought eggs  aren't very flavourful.  I had to tweak it with more lemon juice and cracked black pepper.

I've tried a couple of blender recipes before, and this is by far the best in terms of both flavor and texture. I melt the butter on the stovetop and pour it in *very slowly* while still bubbling. This is now my goto for Hollandaise.

Loved this!  So tasty and delicious!  So simple too.  Mine was a bit thick probably due to the large yolks from the large eggs I had.  I wasn't sure of the best way to thin it so I didn't do any experimenting.  We put it on salmon, cauliflower rice and brussel sprouts.  Next time I'll try thinning with more butter, if necessary.

This is my go-to recipe for Hollandaise be it just for myself or a party of 12.  I prefer the tartness in this, and it's the perfect consistency every time.  I don't worry about over cooking it, either.  LOVE IT!!

The flavor was exceptional but the sauce ended up "breaking" in the blender.  I think I will just hand whisk next time.

This is very good Hollandais sauce. Very easy and great texture and loved the buttery taste. I agree with another review that it lacks a little flavour. I did skip the hot sauce and add some Cayenne and I did add an extra tablespoon of lemon juice, but think that it still needs more lemon. I  used a Ninja blender where you cannot add the butter while running, so I added the hot butter a third at a time blending in between and that worked

I made this recipe for Easter morning, to go with our hard boiled eggs.  It set up very runny and the mustard was just too much.  Wouldn't make this again.

Made as the recipe called it.  It was definitely easy, and pretty good.  It seemed thicker than I expected, but tasty and good over Eggs Benedict.

Quick, easy and awesome. I have used this recipe for at least a year, I eliminate the Dijon for eggs benedict, but include it for other uses. I love how easy this is not only to make but clean up to. Thank you

I've used packaged dry mix to make hollandaise in the past. To me, this recipe was about as easy as that! And so much tastier! No weird processed flavor just egg-y, buttery goodness. Careful when keeping warm in hot water bath- ours cooked a little bit further in the bath while waiting for the poached eggs and asparagus to cook.

Yum! I've always been intimidated by Hollandaise sauce, and this worked out GREAT! Granted, I (nor the hubby) has ever actually had the sauce in a restaurant, so we don't know what it's supposed to taste like, but it was darned tasty. I made it using my immersion blender, and once I got the half batch (using two yolks as another reviewer suggested) into a small enough container, it worked very well. I kept it warm by setting the little bowl in a bigger bowl of water I heated for a couple of minutes in the microwave, topped with foil. I wimped out on the poached eggs and just scrambled the half egg I had already had from another recipe and the whites from making the sauce, so it wasn't technically Eggs Benedict, but it was tasty, and the egg whites did not go to waste. I'll definitely make this again.

Great recipe, without any changes.  The only problem was that there wasn't enough liquid to hit the blades in my bullet,  so I ended up shaking it. But it was still delicious!

I made this recipe by the directions. Although there was nothing bad about the recipe, the four of us participating in the taste test found it to be dull and boring. I will try to jazz it up with more lemon juice, hot sauce and dijon mustard. Now I must admit, we are used to NOLA cuisine.

Worked a treat. Used course grain  mustard and blitzed it a bit longer. Didn't use hot sauce as I have a fussy family. After making the sauce, I used a ban marie to keep it warm which thickened it up a little more, stirring every minute or so.  Delicious.

Not perfect but for the time needed and ease, it's pretty darn good. I also omitted the mustard due to taste preferences. I do prefer a slightly thicker texture and tangier flavour but I will just play around with this recipe and see what alterations I can make to better suit my tastes.

I have made (or tried to make) Hollandaise sauce many times, but it always tastes terrible. I just tried this recipe 'as is'.  It was simple and it tastes really good. I will definitely make it again.  The only trouble I had was that it didn't thicken upon adding the butter (even though it was boiling) so I just put it in a sauce pan on the lowest heat for 10-20 seconds and it worked beautifully.

My husband (who used to be a cook) and I had a little competition this morning to see which hollandaise sauce would be better because when I read this recipe to him, he thought it was crazy to attempt in comparison to the more traditional (complicated) methods. So I made this recipe and he prepared hollandaise his way. I have to say I was surprised after he spent so much time preparing his sauce that this recipe was not only the winner in taste, but also in consistency and presentation! I did have to warm my sauce for 15 seconds in the microwave and whisk, even after keeping the blender in a pot of warm water while he spent forever preparing his sauce, but I think the 15 seconds made my sauce even better! Next time I will probably add a little cayenne pepper and salt but other than that, perfect!

It had a little too much lemon/dijon flavor, for my liking.  I will probably remake it with an extra egg yolk & butter.  I think that will even out the flavor more.  That said, this recipe is nearly fool-proof: unlike most hollandaise recipes, it was quick and simple.  Definitely will be making it again.

Very simple to prepare.  I let it sit for a bit longer than expected while my eggs were poaching, and the sauce thickened up.  A quick run through the blender again brought it right back to the perfect consistency.  Also substituted hot sauce with cayenne pepper.

Wonderful!!!  I used a tad more dijon mustard.  Also, used cayenne pepper instead of tabasco, only bc I didn't have any.  Plus a used a hand mixer bc I don't like trying to get my finished product out of a blender.  It was DELISH!!!

I've made this several times exactly per the recipe and it comes out perfectly each time and reheats very well (spooned over whatever and reheated in the microwave or sitting the dish of sauce in warm water--both come out great). This last time, I was out of Dijon mustard so I used a 1/4 tsp of mayo to emulsify and it was just fine. This is my go to recipe for hollandaise.

It basically tasted like what it is.....raw egg whites w/ butter & lemon.  Did not thicken much at all and no flavor.  And slimy.

I think it's a great alternative to making it the conventional way. Personally think the mustard and tabasco were a perfect touch.

The most useful recommendation I have, since the poached eggs are already quite time sensitive too: get your eggs and your dish ready, and then finally finish the hollandaise (ie, the blending of the butter). It's tricky to keep it after it's been made and I think is best fresh.

I like this sauce a lot! I actually followed the directions exactly and I like how it tastes. You can't really point out the hot sauce or mustard. I switched the serving  size to 4 to make for 4 eggs Benedict (2 servings) and it was a little too much sauce ha. I like a lot of sauce so I was fine with it. I think one egg wouldn't make enough sauce so I'll probably stick to what I did before and just refrigerate the extra next time.

We make this recipe every time we make Eggs Benedict.  We use a hand blender and an old pickle jar to mix all the ingredients.  We keep the jar of Hollandaise warm in the middle of the stove (off burner) when we poach the eggs.  The heat from the nearby pan thickens the hollendaise nicely. Makes 3-4 servings (2 eggs each) and the jar is perfect to store any leftovers.  Yum!

ONLY changes I made was 1/3 tbsp of lemon juice (for 6 servings) and instead of liquid mustard, I use dry mustard that you find in the seasonings aisle. I also omitted the hot sauce, and added black pepper.

This is a  simple recipe, and it's great. Thank you to the original cook who posted this. I use this recipe all the time and freeze any that's left over. I add dried tarragon, 1/4 teaspoon of mustard powder (instead of the djon), a pinch of cayenne (instead of the Tabasco) and wait until the butter is really cooled down before adding it. I am afraid hot butter will scramble the egg mixture in the blender. I've read other reviews that rely on hot butter to thicken. Mine always thickens with cool butter (just like homemade mayo which is almost the same recipe only with olive or other oil). Yummy on tenderloin steak, asparagus, salmon or poached eggs!

So simple.  A 4 because it is just a little bland for us so we add more lemon juice this can thin it a bit, but the hotter the butter the thicker the sauce  (and a little more spicey stuff depending on what it's being poured over) be sure to use salt and pepper after you taste for yourself, it does make a difference. Yummy

I love this quick & simple recipe! I always thought this sauce was hard to make & use to buy the pre made packets, not anymore!  I now know not only what hollandaise sauce is suppose to taste like but how to make it too! There is absolutely no excuse not to make this for me as I always have the ingredients on hand & it is so easy to make.

I JUST finished eating and came back to rate and review (and actually create an account because I needed to review this Hollandaise). 
I had all of the ingredients needed for eggs benny - except LEMON - sigh. I DID have fresh limes. I subbed it in for the lemon and, used spicy brown mustard, Tapatio (a couple of drops). It was FANTASTIC! So easy to make and stress free! I cannot wait to make this for people!

Wow!  Couldn't be any easier.  Great recipe.  Unfortunately, I didn't have a fresh lemon so I used juice.  I would cut the lemon in half next time if I were using juice.

Um. This is blender-licking good. I've never made hollandaise before, and I blended the sauce a bit too long (which I'm pretty sure is why it was thicker than it should have been), but it was absolutely fantastic. Zingy and creamy and just overall yas. Will be making again.

I have made this twice and both times the sauce didn't thicken as the recipe says... Can you please help me to find out what I did wrong?  I read somewhere that using unsalted butter would be best... My daughter in law didn't care for it because she said it was raw eggs... Help!!!

Easy and very tasty. The lemon was a brightness. Now I need to perfect the poached eggs which ranged broadly.

I made this as a quick alternative to a tradional Hollandaise sauce, for use on a crab benedict.  The recipe thickens just like it should, but overall, I found the flavor to be bland, and to lack some of the flavor fullness of a traditional sauce. I added more lemon juice, and it did brighten in a bit, but use this for ease, not for flavor. I think I will play with the ingredients some.

I was sort of sceptical at first.. But ended up pleased. I omitted the hot sauce as I figured the Dijon was already something new to any Hollandaise I've made. Mine ended up super thick.
Would make again as I loved the lemon aspect of it... Would omit the Dijon.

I omitted the dijon and put it on top of asparagus,  ham and swiss crepes. 
If no one had been in the kitchen I probably would have sucked the leftovers out of the blender with a straw. 
So simple to make and holy cow! SOOOOOOO GOOD!!

Better than 99% of restaurants Hollandaise sauce and super easy and fast!! I actually use "Anna Maes Smokey Mustard"(Rober Rothschild Farm) instead of Dijon, which makes this 5/5 stars!!

Great recipe!  Really easy, great consistency in the hollandaise.  The only thing I will change for next time is cutting down the lemon juice. I found that amount of lemon juice just overpowered the sauce

Easier/quicker than traditional method.  Tend to like a little less lemon juice in mine, so I cut that back a bit. Would work better if one doubled the recipe so the yolks can blend better...but that's a lot of Hollandaise!  Will use again for sure.

I didn't have any Dijon mustard, but I had read where another reader made it without it.  While it was great, I would definitely use the mustard the next time.  This was my first attempt at making Eggs Benedict and this sauce was awesome!!!

This was the first time I've ever made Hollandaise Sauce.  I used 1/8 tsp of dried Chipotle Chili Pepper powder instead of a liquid hot sauce.  I used the sauce on some roasted asparagus and reserved the rest to drip steamed mussels in.  I posted a photo.  

It had a very nice blend of flavors. 

Here came the egg yolks, fresh squeezed lemon juice, and the butter groovin' up slowly, coming together like a Beatles song - a perfect blend of a smooth and tangy taste that tickled my tongue.

Wow.  I have made Hollandaise Sauce for years using an old Betty Crocker recipe where you slowly cook the eggs by melting cold butter in a saucepan.  It always worked perfectly, but took a long time, so I was reluctant to try this as it sounded too easy.  Wrong.  It IS super easy & it works beautifully.  I didn't have Dijon on hand, so used regular mustard & no hot sauce.  I added extra lemon, but think it could have used more.  Outstanding just the same.

I lost my shortcut Hollandaise Sauce recipe (which does not use a blender). We always have Eggs Benedict for breakfast Christmas morning.  I was scrambling around to find a substitute recipe for this morning.  I found this one and we loved it.  It couldn't be easier.  It came together nicely, was thickened and tasty.  I like the tip by another reviewer saying to use a thermos to keep it hot. Excellent idea!  Next time, I will try it with out the hot sauce and Dijon  and add a touch more lemon.  I don't know if that would make a "6 star" recipe or not.  It is pretty darned good as is!  I am not looking any further for my old recipe.

Made as written with the exception of Dijon as I didn't have any and didn't want to buy for such a small amount. Also didn't use blender, just a whisk, worked out well, had to add a touch of salt as I used unsalted butter. Was enough for the two of us with just a touch left over. Will make again. Note, don't add more lemon as it would overtake the mild buttery flavour - one more thing, I put the glass bowl inside a small frying pan filled with boiling water and kept the burner on low, thickened and heated up beautifully!.

Very good and simple. I heated butter in pan then poured it in, then put it all back in pan to keep warm... Obviously I wasn't thinking cuz it cooked it a little more, but it was still very good. You can get away with adding less butter for sure. The first batch was a bit too buttery even for my husband who loves butter, the second batch I made for my kids and I used less butter, and kept it in the blender, it was perfect! Worth the Calories! :-)

Four egg yolks, green sriracha, and two tablespoons of lemon juice.  Best. Hollandaise. Ever.

We love it. I use 4 egg yolks when I make this. And just add a little more butter. We always have some left over even though it doesn't look like a lot.

Very simple and excellent taste. I had my doubts and was a bit slapdash about trickling the butter in, but I kept the butter hot with quick return trips to the stove top and the result was a thick consistency, warm and just lemony enough. I omitted the Dijon and hot sauce and added a pinch of cayenne pepper. I will definitely be replacing my classic recipe and all its aggravation with this simple recipe and method. Perfect for Christmas morning when you just don't have enough hands or time.

Thank you.  It was delicious and the perfect consistency.  That was the first time I've made hollandaise without it separating.  I highly recommend this method.

Legit. Omitted the mustard (none on hand) and probably added more lemon than listed but it was deliciously tangy, smooth, thick, and creamy. And very very easy.

I found when following the recipe the finished product tasted overwhelmingly citrus.  The second time, I adjusted the lemon juice to half a tbs. which significantly improved the flavor.

Super easy! I've made it the old fashion way before, but this was amazingly fast and no curdling risk!  I suggest using a mason jar instead of a huge blender pitcher if you have a regular blender you can attach the jar to. I like a bit more lemon flavor in mine, so I have to figure out how to get more lemon without making it runny. More yolk?

Super easy! I used a bit more Dijon, and added some paprika for color.  I also added a pinch of smoked salt since I wasn't using any smoked meat in my Eggs Benedict.  Will definitely make again.

I prefer the traditional method, in a pinch it was ok.  I didn't like it with the mustard and tabasco sauce.  I tried it again leaving those ingredients out and adding a pinch of cayenne instead, and a little more lemon.  It was much better.

this was delicious and SUPER easy! I will probably try adding a little warm water to thin it out next time as suggested, but this was great. It's the second blender version I've tried, and my favorite for sure!! 
I melted the butter in a sauce pan over low heat.

Oh My Stars, it was a hit! 
I did add a touch of salt and another teaspoon of lemon for a serving for 8. But my kids couldn't get enough of it.  I made it for both the Chicken Cordon Blue,  and the Asparagus.  But they even put it on the Wild Rice. killer dinner.

I just made this to go over a platter of asparagus for Easter dinner.  It was SO easy, tasted perfect, and looked like I had worked really hard on it!  My husband was in a panic that I was going to serve a sauce that I had never made before to company, but after reading all the other reviews, I knew it would be just right.  And it was!

Bound well, didn't break. The blender is the perfect tool to make fantastic hollandaise!  Followed the recipe to a T (warm tap water a must).  This one's a keeper.

This was super easy to make. Next time I will add a bit more lemon juice. Made the mistake of topping asparagus with it and covering the bowl to keep it warm while finishing the other dishes. Cooked the egg a bit so it wasn't silky and pretty, but still tasted really great. I omitted hot sauce due to allergies but used the mustard. Will make again!

Major food safety issues here! If you are using unpasteurized eggs, you need to add more lemon juice (2 more tablespoons) to kill off the Salmonella. Holding this as is at a warm temperature will potentially cause food poisoning. Use pasteurized eggs (pourable eggs) from the grocery store if you plan to use this recipe.

Awesome. This sauce came out the perfect consistency. I added a little more lemon, some canned chipotles, and a pinch of salt for more zip.  I like an extra flavorful sauce.   Will definitely make again with my poached eggs!

Wow! You're my HERO! I tried to make the double boiler recipe for hollandaise and it ended up breaking and ruining my highly anticipated eggs benedict breakfast! Tried this recipe and it turned out PERFECT. Thank you so so much for this recipe!

I'm never going to waste time with a double boiler again! I used regular mustard instead of dijon. End result was perfect, and method couldn't be easier.

I follow this recipe to-the-letter and I'm never disappointed. I definitely prefer using salted butter.  I first made this with the Honeymoon Eggs Benedict from this site and it was perfect.  It's great with just the asparagus, too.  When I want something quick, I scramble eggs, add parmesan, salt, freshly ground pepper, diced Roma tomatoes and top with this sauce.  Tested it on the family and was very well received.

It did not turn out good for me. I went by the directions but it was too much butter. There are many good ratings. I must have done something wrong.

I added an extra egg yolk, used a pinch of cayenne, and omitted the mustard. It turned out amazing. Easiest hollandaise I've ever made.

I'm an eggs benedict fiend and really, really wanted them today. Alas, I only had 3 eggs in the freezer soI made this recipe work with only 1 egg yolk. Next time I would start with room temperature egg yolks (final sauce wasn't very warm),and decrease the mustard. I've only tried Blender Hollandaise once before and it was a disaster so I was quite happy with this one.

Like many others, I would like to rate this recipe much higher than 5 stars.  I had a family gathering and made 18 servings of eggs benedict.  If I had to hand wisk Hollandaise sauce for 18 the whole gathering could have been a failure - well, I would have been cranky.  Thank you so much for such a great idea.  I did not change a thing and and it was great.  Five different folks asked for the recipe.  What a tribute.

This turned out spectacularly with my steamed asparagus. I decided to split the middle between plain yellow mustard and dijon because I was worried that plain yellow mustard wouldn't give it enough of a kick and dijon would give it too much of a kick. In the end, I went with 2/3 tsp honey dijon, which flavored it so much that I left out the pepper as it was not needed. (That and I'm not a fan of spicy.)

Thanks for the recipe!

This really was good! So fast & simple...I think that next time I would tweak it a bit, but not by much, maybe a bit more lemon, and I have to say that I went light on the hot sauce (I added dill to it) Was fabulous over lightly poached salmon.

This was fantastic.. I would personally use a titch less lemon, but if that's what you're into, by all means it is still delicious. I would also double the batch, as it seemed most of it splattered all over the blender and was a bear to get out. Thanks for the great tip! Even the kids loved it! TeamToroni

This was actually the most disgusting thing I have tried in my life. The colour and texture looked right but it tasted like lemons and sour milk. I followed the recipe to a tee. I had to scrape the sauce off of my meal and tried to choke it down with the sauce that I couldn't get rid of. My brother was the only one that was able to eat it without gaging, but even he thought it was gross and asked me to use a packet from now on. He usually begs me to cook for him.

I tried this recipe to go atop chicken cordon bleu.  I think it uses to much butter. I just cut the butter back and added some honey dijon mustard and it was fab!

This was easy, quick and delicious!  I used a dash of cayenne pepper and French's Deli mustard and actually made it using my magic bullet! (So easy to clean :)  I blended the egg yolks, lemon juice etc first, then added the hot butter and blended it all together.  Thanks for the recipe!

I'm re-reviewing this after making it a few more times. This really is an excellent hollandaise recipe with classic flavor using the blender shortcut. The most important thing to remember is to gradually pour in the hot butter while blending and immediately put the sauce in a pan of hot water until you're ready to use it. I poured mine from the blender into a pyrex measuring cup, then set it in a pan of hot water.

This was amazing. It was so easy too. I was very nervous hoping it would be good for my guests. It did not disappoint me at all. I read the reviews & did not use the mustard or hot sauce. It was delicious, Thank you.

This definitely gets five stars simply for how easy it is to prepare. I made my Hollandaise before everything else and let it sit. I can understand why one user suggested using unsalted butter, but I decided to counterbalance the saltiness with a few other flavors. I added dried rosemary, a little basil, a few extra shakes of hot sauce (Franks, of course), and used a spicy brown mustard instead of Dijon. I think they added a little more complexity to the flavor. Everyone loved it, and I will definitely make it again. Love it!
 
Side note: I attempted to reheat my sauce after everything else was prepared, but once I got it on the stove it began to thicken as if the eggs started to cook. Not good! I took it off the heat immediately, added a little water and stirred until it looked like normal. I would make it last since it's so quick to throw together and then you won't have to worry about keeping it warm. (What I ended up doing: I put my sauce on the eggs literally within a minute that they came out of cooking so they were warm enough to reheat the sauce. No problem!)

My absolutely favorite go-to sauce. it's the easiest to make and taste just wonderful over eggs or asparagus or fish or whatever you desire. Easy, easy, easy. I always add a tad more lemon because we like it stronger, but it's a great sauce.

Very easy and very yummy. Will never buy the "package" stuff again. You can "play" with the receipe and add more dijon, butter, lemon or pepper sauce.

I made this recipe exactly as it is written. I normally make a blender Hollandaise sauce, so I expected it to be easy and perfect, as usual.  However, when I served it it was very bland. I realized that I have recently switched to unsalted butter and this recipe called for no salt. The recipe should instruct the user to use either salted or unsalted butter and to make adjustments as necessary (and I should taste the sauce before serving it to guests!).

I used my food processor instead of a blender as I don't have one but came out perfect! I think I will decrease the lemon a bit just for personal preference & I did omit the dijion mustard since I didn't have on hand. I only added the hot sauce to my hubby's since the kids would't have eaten it with but overall super easy & so velvety! I will never use the package sauce again, I am actually glad the store was out of it or I would have never attempted to make it on my own since the last time I tried I completely failed using a traditional recipe. Thank you so much for posting!

I am going to give this one another try because I'm pretty sure I was the problem. First I made it way to far in advance and kept it in a warm water bath. It got much thicker than hollandaise should be. Next time I may do the Alton Brown trick and put it in a thermos. Second I didn't feel like breaking out the measuring spoons so I eyeballed the mustard and lemon. It was not bad but I am sure done the right way it would be really good. I will say I don't think it made 6 servings it seemed more like 4 to me.

Love this recipe. Followed the directions exactly. Put it in a glass picture and kept it in a warm oven while I prepped the rest of the meal.  It thickened a bit more in the oven. I love hollandaise sauce. So happy to find an easy recipe!

Yes, this is a very easy way to make Hollandaise Sauce. I cooked a lake trout, de-boned it. Placed half a Portuguese bun in a shallow soup bowl, put trout over it and poured the Hollandaise Sauce over top. Yum, Yum! Sandra Gehrman. White Rock, B.C.

Seriously better than most restaurant hollandaise sauce! I think the butter should be boiling though, from the stove. Otherwise it isn't as thick as I'd like it.

I've actually tried many recipes for Hollandaise Sauce, some were pretty good but were also pretty involved. I followed this recipe almost exactly (I measure by site especially for very simple recipes) with the addition of some garlic. Wow, this is my hands down favorite! It is simple & the consistency of the sauce is excellent, no babysitting it on the stove monitoring temp & making sure you don't scorch it. I highly recommend it.

This was fast & easy, but needed at least double the lemon juice and a big dash of hot sauce so it won't be so bland.

So happy that this was Entirely easy, had store bought, and this is by far the least time consuming. Eggs Benedict with this sauce was delightful, without all the store bought additives and preservatives.

I have never tried to make hollandaise sauce before but I have eaten it and loved it. I had been wanting some for a couple of weeks and finally looked up a recipe for it and found this. I made it and it came out PERFECTLY. The consistency and color were perfect. I simply put the butter in a small saucepan on the stove to melt over medium heat while I separated the eggs and added the other ingredients to the blender and blended for a few seconds. Once the butter was bubbling I turned on the blender and poured it in, in a thin stream. Voila! Simple for me and only took max like five minutes. I rated this five stars because it came out so well, however it did tend to be a little too lemony for my tastes, but I understand that that is entirely my personal taste. Next time I will reduce the lemon juice and add a pinch of salt. I think that that would suit me better. Either way I had a lovely breakfast of hard poached eggs with a little cheese and hollandaise. I WILL be making this again! Thanks for the super simple recipe!!!

I'll try this again (way too watery), maybe really heating the margarine or using real butter.

On second attempt, it was better.

It couldn't get much easier or tastier than this! My husband has been lamenting for years that he's lost his Holandaise touch. I recently came across this recipe and now I am now the official Hollandaise maker.

This was incredible. Incredible. Seriously delicious, could be in a 5 star restaurant type recipe. I didn't change a thing and it turned out perfectly. I did not have a blender handy, so I used my food processor, and it worked perfectly fine. 

I'm so excited to know this recipe! Thank you!

Pretty good, but it could use a little more flavor.  I think I'd leave out some of the butter and add more Dijon and lemon juice and maybe even some Worcestershire sauce next time.  Because of this recipe's simplicity, it's a good starting point, though.

No dijon mustard so I used Worchester sauce instead. As I was also using bought lemon juice rather than fresh so needed to add extra to overcome strong taste of free range egg yolks. I prefer a bit more tart but my partner raved about how it did not have the overpowering tang and thickness that most bought varieties have! So looks like I will be making it again in the future :)

I was so happy to find this recipe! It always turns out so well for me and is delicious.  I sprinkle crumbled, crispy bacon over the top of my hollandaise sause over the poached eggs....***If you want to make it spicier, add a little sprinkle of pepper and a dash of chipotle powder!

The consistency was perfect, however,I thought it tasted flat.  I think with an increase in lemon & the addition of salt and pepper it might improve this sauce.  I will try it again as I do prefer doing Hollandaise in a blender now.

This was fast and easy, but I found the flavour was lacking something.  I used Wor sauce, rather than hot sauce, but that was the only change.  I may use again when in a pinch, but I think I will stick to my regular sauce.

I don't care for hollandaise sauce, but I made this for my father on Father's Day... He said it tasted good- like normal hollandaise sauce, but the uncooked eggs made me nervous.

my first time making hollandaise sauce and never thought it would be this simple! I did cut the the butter a bit and like other reviewers said the sauce wasn't hot enough so i gave it a 4. The sauce wasn't thick enough so i'll probably try the double boiler method next time.

It tastes great and is very easy to make, but a little too much lemon flavor and I just can't get past not cooking the eggs.  Seems like the eggs need to be cooked.....that's why so many recipes use a double boiler!  Looking for a new recipe.

The true texture and flavor of this Hollandaise Sauce is amazing! Next time I will add a little less lemon juice and a little more mustard. I used regular, since I was out of dijon, which worked fine. When all said and done, the sauce was barley warm. Trying to short-cut it, I put it in the microwave for 30 seconds at low. I'm not sure this re-heating method works so well, as it had a few lumps in it, but I didn't want to break out the double broiler as half the point of this recipe is ease/little clean-up. I ended up putting the sauce on my eggs and letting the eggs heat it up. I debated giving this three stars for the failure to heat, and five stars for how amazing... truly amazing it would be if it did heat well.

I found I had to throw this in a double boiler (well, my metal bowl over a pot of simmering water) for a few more minutes to be sure the eggs were cooked all the way and it was thick enough. I think my microwave didn't heat the butter quite enough to compete with the coolness of the other ingredients. I could probably skip the boiler if the butter was heated on the stove. (but I'm also pregnant and raw eggs are not recommended, so I decided to err on the side of caution this time around).

Very good and so easy.  I used a dash of worstershire instead of the hot sauce, because we like that taste.  Used for eggs benedict.  Will definitely use this from now on.

This was really good considering I wanted it in a pinch. Used real lemon juice and did the whole thing in a 6" storage container w/my immersion blender. Reheated ok as well. Very thick.  Someone mentioned that they skipped the dijon b/c they didn't like dijon. There's not enough dijon to register a dijon taste.

Superb consistency - so creamy, not too thick - not too thin. I mistakenly tried to "eyeball" the amount of mustard and think I added too much as it had a strong mustard flavor. I'll measure next time. The serving size is true - I used this for 5 servings of eggs benedict and there was leftover sauce on each dish, would've served 6 perfectly.

I made this as is with margarine instead of butter due to allergies. I added cornstarch as it didn`t thicken with the melted margarine but when I zapped it in the microwave to heat up, it got too thick so I think it would have worked fine without the cornstarch. I did add more lemon but I was just so happy it worked with margarine.

Easy and tasty. My only problem was that the egg yolk didn't seem to get incorporated with the butter completely and everything cooled off REALLY quickly. There was egg yolk left in the bottom of the blender. I think the problem was that the hot butter cooled too quickly in my glass blender. Perhaps the blender container could be tempered with warm water before everything is put in? Not too much, or the egg yolk would cook?

this was really quick and easy.  i'm not a fan of hollandaise so i can't comment on the flavor but my wife and mom both seemed to like it on their eggs benedict.  i would use it again. it certainly beats making it over a double boiler with a wisk!

This was unbelievably easy to make. I thought it was plenty thick. My butter was extremely hot when pouring it in. I used the sauce on eggs benedict and it was really good although I am not entirely convinced that I even needed it because it doesn't add a whole lot of flavor to it.

Finally, a hollandaise sauce recipe that turned out excellent! I only wish I had tried this sooner - It was creamy, not too lemony and reheated very well. Thank you!!

So easy to make, and that's the best part of this recipe. To me, it was too buttery and not lemony enough, so I adjusted accordingly.

I like this recipe because it doesn't use two sticks of butter. I don't have a blender so I double boiled and stirred constantly instead. I used unsalted butter so I had to add a little salt and pepper for my taste but it thickened nicely and went over well with the family.

I will never use a different recipe, this is excellent!! Followed the directions to a t - it's better than the stovetop method for sure. next time i might sub pesto for mustard, since i'm not a huge fan of the vinegary-ness of dijon. thanks for submitting!

This was sooooo delicious! i ate half a pound of asparagus by myself because i couldn't stop eating the hollandaise. I had to add a bit of cornstarch to thicken it but besides that it was delicious as written.

We made this tonight for eggs benedict with smoked salmon.  It was easy and delicious.    We put it in the microwave on the warm setting.  It got it nice and settled for us while we cooked the eggs and english muffins.  We've never made hollandaise sauce before because we don't have a double boiler.  This is crazy easy to make.

I made the mistake of not having the butter hot enough the first time, and it was a little runny. The second time was perfect though! The butter just has to be bubbling hot!

This is a wonderful recipe. Due to a mis communication between the griller and the indoor chef (me) I had to keep it for a long time after I made it. Although it got very thick, it still tasted heavenly. I could have just eaten the whole thing with a spoon. Thanks so much!

Very easy, I actually liked the taste and was able to make it work.  Have tried others, which are nearly impossible to keep from seperating.  This one is a no brainer.  A little too much lemon juice, and mustard flavor for me, though otherwise delicious.

This was actually quite bland, compared to other hollandaise sauces that I've made. Even though it was thick and smooth, it lacked enough. I'd definitely add more lemon juice, salt, pepper, andsome chili powder. 
It's possible that double-boiling adds more flavor than simply blending does.

I have made this recipe twice. The first time it came out perfect. The second time the sauce broke, creating a gooeey, unsightly looking mess. I did pretty much everything the same, the only thing I can figure is that the butter was too hot and bubbly the second time. In any case, I made the recipe exactly as is, and would definitely use it again. I think next time I will add a little more tabasco for a bit more zip. Overall, recommended, as it is very easy, especially if you have everything measured out in advance.

Excellent and easy.  This was my first attempt at a hollandaise and it was very simple.   I think I will try the double boiler version to compare but this tasted like anything I've had in a restaurant.
