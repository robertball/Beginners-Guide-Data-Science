This recipe had all of the comforting carb ingredients I was looking for so I gave it a try.  I  skipped the step coating chicken in butter and peppercorns and just put the plain chicken on top of the onions.  I followed all other directions as given.   It was flavorful and comforting - didn't miss the butter or peppercorns at all.  I recommend baking at 350 rather than 325 and uncovering the last 10 minutes to let the stuffing get a little crispy.  At 325 I had to bake longer than directed.

My son (13) and I made this in the kitchen.  It turned out well.  I think that the suggestion to uncover it for the last 10 minutes was good, however I think we went 20 minutes uncovered at 350 for a total of 70 minutes.  However, for a nice crusty top, i think an extra 20 minutes (80 total)  would have been best.

I love casseroles and this is very tasty.   I followed the advice too to allow it to bake uncovered until the dressing is browned and cubed my chicken breasts instead of layering the breasts whole.  Serves many!  First chicken with rice recipe that actually had good flavor.
