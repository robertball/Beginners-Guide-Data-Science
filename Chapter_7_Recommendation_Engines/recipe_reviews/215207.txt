Delicious! This will be a regular for us. I liked using bone-in meat for the flavor. The dried apricots become so soft and juicy after cooking. I added water chestnuts at the end for some crunch.

This is wonderful.  It is a little hot, so the next time I make it I'll use less red pepper flakes.  My wife and I love curry so I increased the curry.  I used whole chicken breasts but the next time I will cut them into bite size pieces.  This is a recipe fit for company.

Great recipe, it was easy and our friends were extremely impressed. Made it twice and held back a bit on the curry.

Wow! So delicious!  Made this according to the recipe (little bit less red pepper since my husbandâ€™s not into spicy hot) and it was perfect.  Served it over some brown rice.  It will be part of our dinner rotation

Made this for dinner but ommited the dried apricot since I didnt have any on hand.  it came out really tender and flavorful. My picky husband loved it! He even  requested it for dinner the very next day.

I didn't have any apricot juice, so I used orange juice, and the chicken was boneless breasts, and this was still delicious!  I can't wait to try it with apricot juice!  I also cut way back on the curry, since we are a wimpy family as far as spice goes.  Thank you, Katherine!
