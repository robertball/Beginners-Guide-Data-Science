Loved this soup.  It was nice and spicy and a "keeper" recipe.

Made this today and the family loves it. I did use potatoes instead of yellow squash to appease one kid and hot Italian sausage since that's what I had on hand. The flavours of the fresh vegetables really comes through with some heat :)

PERFECT soup !    made this on a very cold day when I didn't want yet another bowl of chili but wanted something to warm me up.  The perfect amount of spicy, veggies and meat !    Cut back some on the broth/v8 only because I like my soups thicker then most.   Besides that kept everything else the same. may add more beans next time... and there WILL be a next time!  thank you ~

Wonderful, flavorful and hearty soup. Nice change from chili.  I froze the leftovers and those were delicious, too.

This recipe is outstanding. Its become a staple at my house. I don't use as much stock because I like a thicker soup and I only used 1 red bell pepper instead of the three. The soup turns out hearty and delicious. It also keeps well. I will make it and have the left overs for a few days :)

I made this recipe according to the instructions. My wife and I both enjoyed it! We served along with crackers.
