Very good but I cooked on stovetop.  I cut up 3 chicken breast halves  cut in bite size pieces and sauted in 1/2 stick marg. used only 3c. carrots parboiled,used 1 1/2 tsp. instant boullion with 1 1/2 c. water. I didn't have gingeroot,so I used 1/2 tsp. ginger powder. Increased hot pepper to 1 tsp. Used lg.can pineapple and put 3 T. cornstarch in juice. Cooked for 20 min. Yum!

Great crowd pleaser! I needed to have this ready in less than an hour to feed six. I doubled the recipe and used the pressuer cooker. Twelve minutes later it was ready. I served it as suggest with white rice. This is a keeper.

This is so simple to fix and is delicious!  It is very popular with every group I fixed it for. I shredded my chicken and used 1/2 as much which made it very economical.

I got this from my AllRecipes.com cookbook so I did not read the reviews before now.
I thought it was kind of strange it would take so many hours for the cubed chicken to cook. I was correct, the chicken came out really dry and like another person said it became stringy.
I liked the taste but if I were to make this again I would probably adapt it to more of a stir-fry and totally change things. 
I still wonder if I did something wrong in cooking the chicken since it turned out so dry but I have read over the recipe several times and I made it just like instructed.

This was an odd recipe, and one I won't try again. It really stinks while cooking, and what's with the pineapple? Overall, pretty darn gross.

I think that it would've turned out better if it was stir fried. At least my husband liked it.

I, like some of the other raters was anticipating that this would be a great recipe but I was quite disappointed. It had an odd flavour. I doubled the broth because that had been suggested several times but the taste of the sauce over powered everything else. I would not make this again.

I had high expectations for this because I love pepper/pineapple/soy sauce-type dishes, but I was disappointed.  Flavor was okay but nothing exceptional.  I had to add quite a bit more cornstarch to thicken the sauce. I also had to cook it longer to get the carrots done.  This had too many carrots.

Not bad. I will probably make this again as my bf enjoyed it more than I did. Next time I will add more liquid and maybe some vinegar to give it more of a sweet and sour taste. I'll also increase the amount of ginger. I didn't make it in the slow cooker, just on the stovetop.

I like to serve this as more of a soup, as a stand alone meal.  I don't use the boneless skinless chicken, just boil regular chicken and tear off the meat.  I also add a lot more sugar since I like it very sweet.  It's a great meal.

I personally didn't like the taste of this, but the chicken turned out beautiful. Everything else cooked really well and it looked great but I guess I am not a big fan of ginger. I would also definately suggest using pineapple tidbits instead of chunks. There were quite a bit of carrots in this too.

Although for the most part it's consumable in present recipe, it certainly needs huge tweeking. I would NOT do the chicken in the crock, it comes out dry and stringy (and needs only 2 hours, not anymore). It needs a load more allspice and ginger (I used powder form) and without blanching the peppers you end up with a dish that plates as though it came from the frozen entree section...not very "homemade". I added garlic, for that third "layer" of flavor, and it needs to cut back on the broth. I served with jasmine rice. Omitting the pepper sauce can be done, as it does nothing for the final flavor. I'd stir fry the chix, remove, make a rue, replace chix in pot, add broth and wet ingredients, let simmer a few minutes and add pineapple and green peppers at the last 10 minutes. Let your nose tell you how much spices need to be added. Good luck.

The first time I made this recipe I thought it smelled different... but I served it with brown rice and it was really good!  The next time I made it I doubled the broth and served it over a couple of baked SWEET POTATOES (cut into bite size pieces).  It too was a hit, and a different way to serve the dish.

I'll be making this again with a change of more broth.

It was good but no-one raced to get the leftovers.  The chicken was a bit dry, I think that skipping the pre-browning may be the better way to go.

I made this dish today, instead of leaving chicken in chunks, I shredded it after cooking and served it over rice ...tasted awesome! The peppers and pineapple together with the seasonings made for happy tummies!

This had a nice flavor to it and it was easy to make.  I'm not sure I would put pineapple in it again.  I'm not sure I liked it.  I might try it again with fresh pineapple or maybe with something else instead.

Tried this recipe last night, cooking time was far too long, chicken ended up being a stringy mess and it definitely needed more flavorings.  Will try again but with a few tweeks.

I've tried this several times although I add more vegetables like peaches and cream corn nibblets. I also add all colours of peppers, tomato, and some spice like cayenne for extra kick as I love spicy food. It's a nice combo of sweet yet spicy and healthy with all the veggies. If you don't want to serve with rice, you could add potato to the mix (small diced potatoes) and eat with naan as it's similar to a curry too, without the curry spices. :) Also, I add the chicken a little later because I like CHUNKS not stringy bits (the first time I cooked it it was stringy). Also, closer to the end, if I wanted to adapt again, I added some broccoli and cauliflower, it was really good.

Of course made a few tweaks of my own...we like extra substance in dishes, so I added onions, celery, extra pineapple and garbanzo beans (actually used dry beans, added the juice from the extra pineapple to have enough liquid to cook the beans).  As a final garnish added fresh cilantro, chili garlic sauce and organic lime juice.  So yummy!

This recipe turned out well enough to eat for our dinner, but not enough to bother with again.
