11.1.16   Used Kalamata olives (what I had on hand), and its brine gave this dip a nice little pop of flavor.  Served this with corn chips, but this would be equally good with crackers.  Quick and easy and good!

This was easy, cheesy, creamy, and briny (in the best sense of the word). I made this for a party and it went over well! I'd make this again not just for the ease, but for the taste.
