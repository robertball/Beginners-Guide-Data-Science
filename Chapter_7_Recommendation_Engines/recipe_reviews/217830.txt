I've made lots of curry before and this one is excellent - and VERY easy.  It's very accepting of almost any veggie you'd like to add - my faves are thin carrot strips, fresh green beans, and even potatoes.  Also a great use of a rotisserie chicken from the store.  Easy to make more or less hot and/or spicy according to your family's preferences (I've changed via amounts and types of spices: more or less curry, cumin including toasted cumin seeds, hot pepper flakes, etc). And since I have most of these things in my cupboards all the time anyway - voila!  I did use milk tho cause no 1/2-1/2 in the fridge. My favorite part of curry is the toppings so I always have some combination of the following:  toasted coconut, sliced green onions, banana slices, toasted almond slivers (my favorite), raisins or currents, chutney, or chopped peanuts. My family loves this stuff!!!  EDIT: used coconut milk tonight - makes a really delicious and creamy sauce.

This was awesome!! I didn't have half and half so I used milk, sure the other would have been better but it still turned out great. My daughter is a big Curry fan and she loved it also. I give this recipe five stars.

I was really excited to try this dish, but I didn't love it as much as I had hoped.  I love curry, but this dish seemed a little one dimensional to me - no real depth of flavor other than curry powder.  I did add a few more spices in (garam masala, cumin) but the dish still felt  like it was missing something.  This was good, but I will probably not make it again as there are many other curry dishes I enjoy more.

Overall, this was a good dish. It definitely wasn't as flavorful as I was expecting. The curry was nice, but otherwise was quite bland. Perhaps I've been spoiled by too many amazing Mediterranean restaurants in our area.

I just didn't have the "Wow" factor we were expecting.  It wasn't bad though.  Needs a little something?

Good recipe!  I added a little more cayenne pepper (1/2 tsp.) and 1/2 tsp. of cumin. Otherwise followed recipe ... nice and creamy!  Yum!

So good I wish I was eating it right now. I'd add veggies of some description the next time just to up the veggie quotient a little, but other than that pure heaven in your mouth.

Good, but I will try to make something with more flavor next time.  The curry comes through nicely but is a little gooey.  

I suggest adding red pepper or snap peas for garnish to add to the flavors.

I left out the apple and added peas at the end. It was very good. "The best"? Maybe not of all time but pretty  good. I'm keeping this recipe for sure.

So yummy!  This is a hearty filling dish.  My boyfriend loved it and we had enough left over for two more dinners.  Instead of the brown rice I used when I initially made the dish, I used a quick cooking Acini di pepe pasta to serve the curry chicken over.  De-lish!  I'm going to make this for a dinner party soon!

This was excellent! My first time making curry and my husband's first time trying curry - wonderful experience! I served this with Carrot Rice (also on here) - I can't wait to make this again.

I've made several curry dishes over the last few weeks and this was the over all favorite!  I just cut up some precooked rotisserie chicken for the sauce.  Served over rice.  My family of 6 loved it.

I made this tonight.  It was excellent!  I added some minced garlic, about a half cup of peas, and some extra garlic to kick it up a notch.  This recipe will be added to my regular rotation.

This was surprisingly good! I did add extra curry powder, ginger, cayenne pepper and some cumin since my husband and I like spicy foods. I actually mixed the butter, stock & all the spices into a dish and added it to my chicken. Next time I'll try this with coconut milk (though it was great just with 5% cream).

4.5 stars. This was relatively easy as far as curries go. I added chopped red pepper as a garnish. Made it for friends and they loved it.

Easy to make and the whole family loves it!  Great with rice and naan.  Easy to adjust for heat but have always followed the recipe. Dinner in under an hour! Have also substituted shrimp for the chicken and came out great!

This recipe was fantastic! Very easy to follow, even with several steps to follow. The flavor was spot on with the spiciness from the curry and cayenne, to the sweetness of the apple. I think the only thing that I would do differently next time would be to add another apple instead of only having one. I felt like I only had a taste of apple every few bites or so and had to kind of look for it. No big deal though, and it's easily fixed. For those that don't want the recipe to be as sweet I'm sure one apple would suffice. My seven year old and three year old really loved it, as did my husband and I. Thank you for sharing your recipe with us, Mark!

This was a really good curry. I would recommend using a sweet or sweet tart cooking apple that holds its shape when chopped and cooked. I used a Granny Smith apple and I found it was too tart and it fell apart for this recipe after being cooked for a while.
