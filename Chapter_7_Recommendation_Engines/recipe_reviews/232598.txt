I make this for the diabetics in the family by using sugar free angel food cake, no sugar added crushed pineapple, sugar free pudding and sugar free coolwhip. Since even though it looks awesome with the angel food cake sliced like this, by the time you take out two or three slices out it is a mess so instead I use the trifle bowl and cube up the angel food cake then layer the cake and pudding mix. It is much easier to serve that way and everybody loves it.Huge hit and everybody wants it for the family get togethers.

I have made this many times. I use the sugar-free jello and no sugar added pineapple. It is awesome. I do not make the layered cake anymore it is too messy and not cute after it's sliced. I usually cute the cake then do a dollop of the cool whip topping with sprinkle sliced strawberries.  Yummahhhhh

I liked it  I thought it was great with wildberries, but I thought the whipped topping was too much

Loved this! I brought this to a dinner hosted by a friend and it was a hit with several enjoying second helpings. Very light tasting and, if you use light whipped topping and reduced sugar pudding, it is a sin-free treat!  I'm a trifle fan so I followed the trifle reviewer's suggestions and then layered 1/2 each of the cake cubes, pineapple/pdg/topping mixture, and then strawberries before repeating the layers again. Then to finish it off and make it look fabulous, I used an additional 1 cup of whipped topping and plopped it on top, decorating with halved large strawberries. Delish!!

The first time I had Angel Food cake is with this simple recipe. The topping really makes this cake.  It seems to be a healthy enough cake if you are trying to cutback on sweets.  Angel Food cake seems to easily stick to the pan, not sure what to do to remedy this.  I just couldn't stop eating this!  Will make again & again!

I'm giving it 5 stars because it tastes amazing!! 

If you just cube the angel food cake and put it all in a nice serving bowl, it is much less mess (and a little less work).

This was so good! Nice to have a low calorie dessert. I used fat free cool whip and topped it with strawberries, blueberries and blackberries. Perfect for spring.

I've made this tons of times. It's always a hit. I've even made it less caloric by using sugar free pudding and light whipped topping. That way I can eat an extra piece!

It was good for an easy, quick summer dessert but I wouldn't serve it to guests.  I used a sour cream pudding cake as the store was out of angel food cake.  I think this actually made the cake better than it would have been.  I used strawberries in the middle layer and on top.  The pudding mixture was fine- it was just pudding mix though.

Love this recipe! I also break angel food up in big glass bowl then layer everything. Instead of the one cup whipped topping I used entire 8 oz bowl.  will make this over and over again.

This dessert could not be any simpler to make.  I did take the advice of some and layered it in a trifle bowl rather than on a plate like a cake. I'm glad I did as it tends to pack down as it sits in the fridge. As an alternative to fruit on top, I made a packet of jello, allowed it to set and then gently mashed the jello before piling it on top of the dessert. I like the contrast it added in flavor and texture. Will make again, for sure!

Instead of using a pre-made angel food cake, I made it using a vanilla cake mix and stirred in a can of drained crushed pineapples, 4 eggs, milk and melted butter. I used 3 cake pans. I garnished with strawberries. It was very delicious and received a lot of compliments on this cake. Will definitely make it again.

Super easy, even when making the cake from a package mix rather than buying it.  Super delicious. I agree with those that say this is a perfect light summer dessert, but would still be delicious in the winter. Try it. You’ll like it.

Love this recipe. Like others I don't mess with cutting the cake. I will cube and layer in a bowl or buy the individual sponge shortcakes, make the pineapple mix and serve on those.

A winner!  Definitely worth the extra time it takes to make the angel cake instead of buying a store-made one.   Looks and tastes heavenly!  :)
